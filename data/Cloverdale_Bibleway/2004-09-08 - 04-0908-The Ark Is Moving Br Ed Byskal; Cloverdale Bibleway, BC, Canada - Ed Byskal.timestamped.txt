[17:35] Amen. Well, that's a good report. God bless you. Thank you for your prayers. Uh while we were away
[17:43] in meetings with uh down in Virginia with brother Ron Spencer and uh we had really uh some unusual
[17:53] meetings. I I actually was wondering why it was as unusual as it was and uh I was having such a
[18:01] a liberty and and there was there was a somnity to the meeting but I was having such a liberty and I
[18:07] was wondering why there was such a liberty and uh you know some of the service I thought you know
[18:14] I I don't I don't even know if I'd say that at home and that's a lot of liberty and and then uh
[18:21] then I found out afterwards that uh because I was actually wondering you know I I thought you know
[18:27] the Holy Spirit is definitely leading in such a sensitive way when it was a meeting was over then
[18:35] I found out that they didn't tape the meetings they didn't video the meetings they didn't record
[18:41] them in any way and I said that's just exactly why and they said that's the way we've done it
[18:47] for years we just had it just for our congregation just for our people I thought well God honored
[18:53] that just God bless that. Well, we're really happy to have our brother pastor Ward with us
[18:59] here from Cadillac, Michigan, and brother me who came with him, and we've been having a wonderful
[19:05] time. I wonder if those two brothers will stand up so you'll know who's sitting here in the
[19:09] front. He's a pastor of the Apostolic Church in Cadillac, Michigan. Happy to have you, by the way.
[19:19] And we've got uh also our brother Samuel Dale. Brother Samuel and Sister Dale from
[19:26] the Atlanta. I only identify you with Atlanta, brother Dale. And we're delighted to have them.
[19:32] Brother Dale sponsored the mission convention in Atlanta. And uh he's going to be speaking
[19:38] Sunday night. I'd like to have brother and sister Dale stand so we can welcome them.
[19:45] I'd like to go to Dale.
[19:49] Amen. I see brother Joe Riley here, not a stranger to us. God bless you, brother
[19:54] Riley. Nice to see you. All right. Well, uh, and nice to have Tom and Joanne back. God bless them.
[20:09] You know, it's amazing. I think that people don't perhaps realize they're as missed as much as they
[20:14] are. But I have been missing brother Bill and Sister Marjorie Watkins. And I didn't know I
[20:20] if I didn't know I was in the rapture, I might have thought they got raptured. I hadn't seen
[20:24] them for so long. Couldn't get them off my mind the last few days. And we're happy to have them
[20:29] back after a long time. We appreciate you. God bless you, Brother Bill, Sister Marjorie. Well,
[20:36] uh, we're going to turn to the word in just a moment, but I have a song I'd like to sing
[20:39] if you'd join and sing it with me. It's 2119. Uh, hear the cries. Worthy, worthy. And maybe
[20:48] we can stand as we sing it. Brother Jason, why don't you come and lead us, would you please?
[21:00] Hear
[21:03] the cries of the shackle from the onset of time. For the chains of defeat, there's no king.
[21:19] See the tears of the broken, the cries of the slave. Is there no one worthy to set us free?
[21:36] Then the crying is still and the chlor
[21:47] from their chain.
[21:52] And of fountains of voices are swelling of song. Oh worthy the lamb that was slain. Oh worthy.
[22:12] So worthy.
[22:17] Worthy. The lamb that was slain. Oh Lord, you are worthy.
[22:28] So worthy.
[22:33] Oh worthy. The lamb that was slain.
[22:41] and all the archangels, the saints of all time. Oh, holding their crown in their hands.
[22:57] Oh, fall down before him, joining the song. Oh worthy, worthy the lamb. Oh worthy,
[23:17] so worthy,
[23:21] worthy.
[23:25] I want to say
[23:30] worthy.
[23:33] All worthy.
[23:45] And the people can say hallelujah. Hallelujah. This lamb of God. Oh Lord Jesus.
[23:55] These lips are unworthy. But you are worthy. And oh God, you've made us. You've made us worthy all
[24:04] your own doing. We give you glory this evening. We give you praise for the bloodbought redeemed
[24:12] number that you have purchased with your own blood the very blood of God. Father, how we thank you
[24:20] that we can be gathered in just such a place in such an atmosphere and not only with the visible
[24:26] audience here within the sanctuary, but those that are gathered Lord from other countries by the live
[24:33] internet, Lord, I know some that are tuned in just now. I pray that you'll bless them. Some Lord,
[24:40] that perhaps need to find the reality of this Christ, this glorious message that you've sent
[24:46] us in this time. Let the spirit of revelation be upon them. I pray, oh God, from east to west
[24:52] and north to south. We ask your grace upon the service. Pray that you'll be with me now, Lord,
[24:59] I submit myself as your servant, desiring, oh Lord, just to be a tool. Let the people,
[25:06] oh God, I pray, be under the brooding of the Holy Spirit. And may you hover over us like the lovely
[25:17] dove of God. Bring forth a mind, Lord, that will be under the supreme control and preeminence of
[25:24] the Holy Ghost. And now in Jesus Christ's name, we think of what your prophet spoke so often.
[25:31] Any man with strength can turn the pages of the book, but only God, only you can open its depths
[25:38] and meaning to us. I pray you'll touch us now with the flame of fire, the holy flame in Jesus
[25:45] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Please take your Bibles if you would and turn to the book of Joshua.
[25:55] I wish to read a short portion out of the third chapter.
[26:08] And notice also our brother and sister Clar from Edmonton, Ramona's parents. God bless you. Uh we
[26:16] when I look down and see you, I almost feel as though you're not strangers. You belong here.
[26:21] You're that welcome. God bless you. All right. The third chapter, Joshua, beginning at verse one. And
[26:30] Joshua rose early in the morning, and they removed from Chhatim and came to Jordan. He and all the
[26:38] children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over. And it came to pass after three days
[26:46] that the officers went through the host. And they commanded the people saying, "When you see the ark
[26:53] of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests, the Levites bearing it, then you shall
[27:02] remove from your place and go after it." My, isn't that a glorious scripture? Let me just break that
[27:12] third verse down a wee bit. They commanded the people saying, "Number one, when you see the ark,
[27:23] not everyone sees the word, but when you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, number
[27:30] two, and the priests, the Levites bearing it, not the Christian businessman association, not anyone
[27:42] other than is called of God. to handle the word of God. When you see them bearing it, you lots of
[27:49] others will bear it, but don't pay any attention to it. It's only their ideas. It's only their best
[27:55] thought. It's only their concept. But when you see the priests, the Levites bearing it. Then
[28:03] you shall remove time for action from your place and go after it. God bless you. You may be seated.
[28:18] I'd like to just take a little text tonight. The ark is moving.
[28:26] I don't expect all get through tonight, but the ark is moving. When you see it moving,
[28:35] then you move with it. Amen. Now, as soon as we say the word the ark, it conjures up in your mind
[28:49] uh an image. Words present an image in a person's mind. If I say carpenter, plumber, you don't see
[29:00] a airline pilot walking in to your mind. If I should say uh the tabernacle or the church, if
[29:11] I say church, you don't see a skyscraper, right? Or an apartment building. You instantly have
[29:20] uh a certain image in your mind. And the reason why you have that image is that you have been you
[29:26] have been taught from childhood that that is that is one kind of a building. This is another kind of
[29:33] a building. This is a church. Now, different people might have different uh uh different
[29:39] concepts of what that is. One might see a great beautiful stone structure with stained glass.
[29:44] Another one will see a little white church on the hill with a little steeple. And someone might see
[29:49] uh a twocar garage where they worship. I don't know. But they will see something different.
[29:54] But it will be a church. And that's what they will see. When we say the ark of the covenant,
[30:02] uh some people perhaps don't have any idea what it is, but it was just a a box really
[30:09] uh in which was the tablets of stone and the priests carried it on their shoulders when
[30:18] the camp was moving. And this was in the holy of holies, this ark of the covenant.
[30:25] But now the objective was so that God could be with his people. We've got to have what
[30:33] the objective is. Not just what the object the object itself is, but what is the objective that
[30:39] God has for this object that is there and and why is it there and what is the purpose of it?
[30:47] We actually have to go back just for a moment for for a little bit of background and I will
[30:52] probably touch on this background just a little bit later as well. But God loves fellowship.
[31:02] Brother Brown speaking of Jesus in his prayer in John 17, he said he Jesus in his life really only
[31:08] asked for one thing. He asked for the fellowship of his disciples and where I am there they may be
[31:17] also. I want them with me. He wanted fellowship and that has never changed. God can't change.
[31:25] He's desiring fellowship as much tonight as he did back then or as much as he did in Eden. We
[31:31] have to we have to have that decided in our mind. God loves fellowship. That's why he want a family.
[31:39] That's why he wants sons and daughters. He wants fellowship. We often perhaps come into church,
[31:44] perhaps too often come into church and we expect to sing, you know, some songs and hear some prayer
[31:50] and maybe some specials and hear someone speak and so on, greet one another, have fellowship
[31:54] among ourselves. But we need to be mindful when we come in. Our purpose of coming here is to
[32:00] have fellowship with God. Fellowship with a being that we cannot see. But it is not that we cannot
[32:07] sense him. We cannot be unaware of him. We can be aware of him and we should be aware of him.
[32:13] God wants to touch us and have fellowship with us and that is the purpose. And when that fellowship
[32:22] was broken in Eden as a result of the fall, God immediately set in motion a process by which he
[32:32] could maintain contact Amen. with his children. Yes. And so he had secondary ways and means of
[32:41] doing so. And he would appear. He appeared. I want you to really hang on to that word. He appeared
[32:51] to Abram. He appeared to then after he changed the name appeared to Abraham. And I'll use the
[32:57] word Abraham name. He appeared to him. and the appearance that I want I want to suggest to you
[33:04] tonight that God in his appearing he has different molds different uh avenues different things he
[33:12] used he he used dreams but the objective of the dream was to make contact with the individual
[33:21] and his objective is to have fellowship to develop some relationship with that individual
[33:28] and perhaps through him through many many others That was God's objective. He wants fellowship.
[33:37] He used visions. Spoke in a vision. I've mentioned that before. You know,
[33:44] I'm perhaps throwing out some things that you'll have a hard time really. You don't wrestle with
[33:48] it. Just relax with it. But I don't know how God speaks through a vision, but he he gives
[33:55] a a vision. They they perhaps see something. I don't know what it is. they actually saw. But
[34:01] God spoke through vision and but his objective of speaking was to maintain that communication and
[34:09] develop a a relationship of fellowship with that individual. Amen. Yes sir. So now that that really
[34:19] is the objective and then in order to do that we can we can go back and and just make reference to
[34:30] uh Jacob for example. Jacob when he wrestled with the angel and the scripture says he wrestled with
[34:38] the man right? It was a man to him and he wrestled with the man. didn't know exactly
[34:45] who he was. But when he was done, he recognized he called the name of the place panile. He said,
[34:51] "For I've seen God face to face and his life was changed." And he was a shyster before, but after
[34:58] he wrestled with the angel, the angel of the Lord, he was a changed man. And God had a relationship
[35:05] with him that he didn't have before that time. God wants to touch our lives, individual lives. If he
[35:12] redeemed us at all, he redeemed you for a purpose. If he shed his blood at all, he did it for a
[35:18] certain purpose. And he did it so he can have a an intimate fellowship with us as individuals. I
[35:25] can't believe that it's any different tonight. I'm going to go into this in some in some depth. So,
[35:30] if you'll just bear with me. Now we can see it move up from from Abraham to Moses and he makes
[35:41] himself known to Moses in a pillar of fire. So he Moses is attracted to the pillar of fire. But then
[35:50] God speaks to him. I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He begins a relationship with Moses and
[36:00] folds Moses into his plan into his program until he has a willing servant, a willing prophet and
[36:09] an obedient voice because through him he wants to he wants to have fellowship with a whole nation of
[36:18] people. And he begins to draw out people. people that are going to complain, people that are going
[36:22] to murmur, people that are going to rebel, people that are going to rise up against him.
[36:27] But he draws them out in his compassion anyway. Even today, he brings, look at what happened,
[36:33] what happens at every move of God. So I want you to think of the various moves of God. When the
[36:38] ark is moving, move with it. God has moved down through the centuries. He's moved down through
[36:44] the New Testament era. There are specific times in history that we know of that God moved in a very
[36:53] special way. And my point tonight that I want to dwell on is that when God moved, when he did move,
[37:03] when he moved under Luther, that was a move. He moved under Wesley, that was a move. There was a
[37:10] great move called Pentecost. That was a move of God. There was a move of the restoration of the
[37:16] gifts. That was a move of God. It was a move of God that caught the attention of Professor
[37:22] Harold. I was showing the book to our pastor Ward uh yesterday or today. Uh it it caught
[37:29] his attention when I had opportunity to speak with him when he flew up here and we spent a Saturday
[37:34] together. I asked him about uh you know uh about him writing the book and and uh what he said as a
[37:42] as a professor of history. He said I became aware that that the revival the spiritual sweep revival
[37:52] that took place from 1947 that's what he says in his book from 1947 to 1958. He said, "I know.
[38:02] I recognized it changed the face of America. It was a move of God. But they did not realize what
[38:11] activated and what initiated that move." And many of you here know, but a lot of you don't. And our
[38:17] young people get older year by year. And perhaps you have not heard, but this is a professor of
[38:22] history who's not a believer of this message, but he's interested in in what what affects America as
[38:30] a nation. And he said that as he was uh as he was gathering and massing his material together and
[38:37] going through the lives of or Roberts and Tommy Osbborne, Tommy Hicks and Velmer Gardner and Oel
[38:44] Jaggers and WV Grant and all this host of men and there were all kinds of them. All kinds of them.
[38:50] It was it was just like a spirit fell and it was happening in small places not only amongst great
[38:56] names or men who became wellknown. I went to a meeting I went to a meeting right after we were
[39:02] in brother Brandham's meeting up in up in uh uh Vernon, British Columbia. Just shortly after that,
[39:08] we were down uh down here right on the border in a coast a border town interior of British
[39:14] Columbia. And there were some meetings going on. There was a man from uh he was a minister
[39:19] from California someplace and I still remember his name. His name was Tom Meyers. He was a a big man,
[39:26] black curlyheaded fellow. And I guess his family was there. Uh and he he was praying for the sick,
[39:33] preaching and praying for the sick. I personally saw people came in. They had it outside. There
[39:38] were no place that was big enough, I guess, to hold it. And it wasn't there was thousands of
[39:43] people, but this is a small town. And uh uh I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears three
[39:50] deaf and dumb mutes in two days in two nights meeting uh all of them got their hearing and
[39:57] began to speak right in front of us. This man I never heard of him before never saw him since it
[40:04] was a spirit of God. When God decides to move he just moves. And it isn't anybody that did anything
[40:13] good about it. It isn't anybody who got smarter. It's God, sovereign God, that does the moving.
[40:20] And he says, "When I move, you move." When you see the word moving, then move. Hallelujah. And this
[40:28] is one time, I will say this, this is one time in history that the word of God has literally
[40:34] exploded into a depth of meaning and revelation. And when we see that, that is the time that for
[40:41] us to move and acknowledge it. And that's how we that's how we move on with God. Then I I'd like to
[40:51] introduce this right quickly. And that is that when God moves, when he did as he did say with
[41:00] Moses for example, there was a presence that came with his introducing himself. There was a presence
[41:13] when Moses stood before the bush. I wish I could have. I wish I could have been there. I wish I
[41:19] could have been here on earth when Jesus was here. But I'll tell you, I have to say out of all truth,
[41:26] I'm glad I'm here now because this is when God wanted us to be here. You want to be glad
[41:32] you're here now because God wanted your special reflection of Christ to be shown in this day.
[41:42] He didn't want you in another another time or another season. He wanted you now. But here's
[41:48] my point that when God introduced himself at that particular he had never been in a pillar of
[41:53] fire before. So he used different avenues he used different methods in this process of maintaining
[42:02] fellowship and contact with the people. He comes in different ways. He was in a whirlwind. He he
[42:10] veiled himself in a pillar of fire in a cloud. But all of them all of them hear me in indicated
[42:18] that this God's presence was there. That's the thing. You will learn more in just a moment in
[42:29] God's presence. I guess there was the outstanding thing in the meetings in Virginia and that's what
[42:36] I was amazed at really. There was a a somnity and a holiness, a a presence came down and especially
[42:45] I touched on these things of the angel of the Lord and some things that brother Brandham said about
[42:51] the angels and he started the service. I just started the service introducing to the people
[42:57] and the angels of God are here. They're here with a purpose in mind to draw you into God's presence.
[43:06] And that thing, that presence, that spirit fell over that congregation. We didn't have an altar
[43:12] call, but at the end there were there were uh some young people there. There were a lot of
[43:18] visitors there. And I don't know, only a small percentage of them. And I knew that some were
[43:23] completely unbelievers. And I asked if you I if if you would like to if you have never been
[43:32] introduced if you have never come to this Christ that now you here if there is even the remotest
[43:39] tinkle in your heart I would come I'd respond. I just stopped. I think we started to sing. I I
[43:47] think we started to sing a chorus. Almost that entire congregation got up and surged forward
[43:52] and the aisles were packed all the way back. It it it took me by such surprise. I mean, people,
[43:59] saints had been walking in this message for years just surged forward. I would say there wasn't any
[44:04] more than 10% of the congregation left in the seats. And it was such a holiness and such an
[44:11] atmosphere. And then it was quiet. Nobody was saying anything. So I was encouraging them,
[44:19] you know, just say what's in your heart. Just commune and say what's in your heart. Couldn't
[44:26] hardly get a peep out of the people. I mean, this is the South. This is the Bible belt.
[44:32] Couldn't hardly get a peep out of them. I That wasn't really the way it is, Brother Dale. Not
[44:36] I thought this isn't the way it's supposed to be. And we just waited. We just waited and communion.
[44:43] And those people began to have communion with God. And I'll tell you, before a half an hour went by,
[44:50] it was earsplitting. Those people began to touch God. And God begin to touch them. They begin to
[44:57] have communion and joy. Begin to fill their heart. I tell you what, you'll learn more about God in
[45:03] a few moments in his presence. And you will in all of your study and all of your reading,
[45:07] whatever more in his presence, you'll learn more about him. And that's what he wants. That was the
[45:15] purpose of the move of God. We could say the move of God, the move of God in God's mind is
[45:21] that he wanted to draw near to the people so you could feel his presence. And we no one would deny
[45:30] this has been an era of a mighty move of God. And if we if we say that then the next statement has
[45:36] to follow. He moved for the purpose of bringing me into his presence. Let them build a tabernacle and
[45:46] let them have it and let them build it this way and let them put these certain implements in it
[45:51] and let them have a veil and then behind the veil. Let them have an ark of the covenant and put the
[45:57] stones of my of the of the covenant in there and let them build this tabernacle that I may dwell
[46:05] amongst them. That's the purpose. Hallelujah. This building doesn't mean anything to God. But what
[46:12] does mean something to God is those that come in here can meet God. Hallelujah. What purpose
[46:19] would the message be if the message didn't bring people in contact with God and bring you into that
[46:26] fellowship into that presence of God? What good does it say? Oh, God sent us a mighty prophet and
[46:32] God had all the phenomena and all these miraculous things and what a message and we over a thousand
[46:39] messages and tapes and whatever more. What purpose is it? If it doesn't bring people into contact,
[46:46] into the very presence of God. And I'm here tonight to tell you that is why God moves. He
[46:54] chooses a certain way to move, a certain avenue, a certain channel. And he may use the pillar of fire
[47:00] to veil himself. He may use a pillar of cloud in the day and a pillar of fire at night. He may use
[47:06] the prophets as he did. He came and bodied himself in the fullness of the Godhead, bodily in the body
[47:13] of Jesus Christ. But that there was some that were merged with the presence of God through Christ,
[47:23] but multitudes were not multitudes. Most of them weren't even touched by it. Right? So it
[47:30] tells us here tonight, you can sit here and not be touched at all. Or you can sit here and recognize
[47:37] that what I'm saying is the truth of God's word and say, "I am I am a I I am a I am one I'm one
[47:46] that is open. I'm one that is prepared. I'm a candidate is the word I wanted. I'm a candidate
[47:53] for what you're preaching tonight, Brother Ed. I'm a candidate for his presence, oh God.
[47:59] Hallelujah. Oh God, I'm open. Oh God, send your presence down upon me. My heart is open.
[48:08] My mind is clear. There's no guilt. There's no condemnation. Hallelujah. I've been justified.
[48:14] I've been sanctified. I've been sealed by your spirit. I'm a candidate for your presence.
[48:21] Hallelujah. You'd want to live outside of that presence. Life is too cruel. Life is too harsh.
[48:32] Life is too vile. This generation that we're in is too wicked. We cannot afford to live outside
[48:38] of his presence. Do you hear me? You can't afford it. You can't afford to be outside
[48:43] of his presence. You need that presence. This this world is not only cruel, but it's hard and
[48:51] it makes hard people insensitive. But the Holy Spirit bringing us into his presence gives us a
[48:59] softness and a tenderness and a receptiveness. Oh God, let us not just have church. Let us not just
[49:09] be gathered to a meeting, but may it be a time we're in contact with God. Your presence, oh Lord,
[49:19] little simple things really touch me. And I tell you what, a person doesn't have to preach a big
[49:26] long service to me. I hear a tape and I hear Brother Brandham standing there and and and a
[49:32] woman come up and it just melts me. Just hear him say it just the way he says it. Isn't he lovely?
[49:44] And just silent. Silent when she's standing there. Isn't he lovely? Do you know what that tells me?
[49:51] It's not just those words. Isn't he lovely? Tells me that the servant of God is already in a special
[49:58] place of communion with God before he's even going to try to minister to the people. And many times
[50:05] I I walk out here and I know every minister feels the same. Oh God, we want to have that assurance
[50:10] and that confidence. I want to know that same pillar of fire, that same angel of the Lord
[50:15] that was standing there with him needs to stand here with me and stand here with you. Amen. And
[50:22] that's my sermon tonight. That's really what I want to bring out to you. The appearing of
[50:27] God is not something he didn't just appear and was for an instant for a moment, but he appeared
[50:34] and then he continued to make himself known in in commandments, in statutes, in precepts. The
[50:42] word of the Lord is pure. The word of the Lord is holy. the word of the Lord and the intent of it
[50:49] when God gives it is not so it can be some harsh cut and dried law that people have to cower under
[50:56] and bend under but it's grace to the people in a love relationship and we want to live pleasing in
[51:05] his sight so we can have communion with him and maybe it's been a long time maybe it's been like
[51:11] you say I've gone through a long dry spell you don't need to I'm giving you a good news tonight.
[51:16] You don't have to go through a long dry spell. You can enter into a place of fellowship with
[51:22] him. You can have a relationship. I'm here pulling with everything that's in me to announce to you,
[51:28] you can have a divine relationship with him. That's why he came. That's what the message
[51:36] is all about. That was the move of God that he did in this hour for us. Amen. A move of God.
[51:46] And when you see the ark moving, when you see the word moving, it's been a long time, many years. I
[51:55] was glad I never had a question asked me quite the way brother me posed the question, and I'm sure he
[52:02] won't mind. He He said, "Does the word still open up?" Does the word still open up to you the way it
[52:14] did in the past? And I said, "Oh yes, probably more so in the last 2, three years than at any
[52:22] time in my life." And when the word opens up, the purpose of it, the purpose of it opening up is
[52:29] so that God can draw you in to a relationship with him and make himself known. He wants you
[52:36] to sense and feel his presence. Amen. And the angels of God, the angels of God are standing
[52:45] not merely at their attention, but they are here seeking to make you conscious of their presence
[52:58] because they're commissioned to bring you into the presence of God. They are all assistants to that
[53:08] in the meanest man. That message the meanest man I know
[53:15] brother Brandon was talking about
[53:21] uh a a a woman I believe it was. He said, "Oh,
[53:28] oh, he's talking about the woman that came and touched the hem of his garment, hem of
[53:33] the garment of Jesus." He says, "And she slips up real quick and she stands and the Bible said
[53:38] behind him and she got to thinking, oh, oh, I'm in the presence of God." A strange feeling always
[53:48] comes over you when you come in that attitude. It's talking about the right approach. Now,
[53:54] See the right approach is not you know ho hham I'm here for Wednesday meeting that's not the approach
[54:01] the approach is not even when a guest speaker gets up and said well I wonder what he speaks like I
[54:06] wonder what his style is I wonder what his manner that's not the attitude that's not the approach
[54:12] that's not the thing that will bring the presence of God but when you come in say here I am Lord I'm
[54:18] ready I'm I I'm just I'm here in my pl at my post of duty I'm a member. I'm a part of this body of
[54:26] Christ. I'm here to receive what I have need of. And you may not even know what that is because
[54:31] God knows what's tomorrow. He knows the beginning from the end. He knows what has been and he knows
[54:37] what will be. And so he is he is preparing for you exactly what you need. And you may need it
[54:44] within the first five minutes you step out of the building. You may not need it for a year,
[54:50] but when the time comes, that will be refreshed and brought to your memory,
[54:54] and you'll say, "Thank God, I was prepared for this moment." Can you say, "Amen." Hallelujah.
[55:03] And here's the one under influence. Remember now, influence is the pouring in. It is the
[55:11] introduction of a power into a person's life. influence. It could not only be in a life,
[55:18] it couldn't be in anything else. But but influence, as I'm referring to it tonight,
[55:22] is the is the introduction or the pouring in of power to bring about modifications. Permanent
[55:31] changes. That's what God wants to influence us. Hallelujah. And under the message influence,
[55:40] talked about the little five senses that we live in. That's just a world of our own. He said he
[55:47] said we were only given these so we could contact our earthly home but there are senses beyond that
[55:55] another dimension and this is where you know just because it's another dimension we shouldn't
[56:01] shut it off and close down our mental capacity say well I don't understand it does we don't
[56:08] understand a lot of things I don't understand how rockets go at 25,000 m an hour I don't understand
[56:14] it I sit on an airplane and they tell us how fast they're going. I can't even believe it.
[56:23] You ought to see the luggage that comes off one of those big giants. And I sit on those
[56:29] planes and think about all that luggage that's down in that hole down there. I
[56:33] just can't believe all those suitcase are flying with me. I can't hardly grasp my mind. I try I
[56:40] I actually try I try to get a hold of it and I look I don't know if you've ever done it,
[56:46] but that's just how simple I am. I I look down that plane, look at all those people and think,
[56:51] look at all that weight that's up here flying in the air above these clouds at
[56:58] 550 m an hour and all of their suitcases. You ought to see some of their suitcases.
[57:09] I don't understand that. The ways of God. I don't understand the ways of God. You don't
[57:14] understand it. We don't we don't want to shut down our mind simply because we don't
[57:18] understand it. We start to reach reach some area in the word of God. And the prophet says there's
[57:23] another dimension. There's senses that reach another dimension. And I want to say amen. I
[57:29] want to say may yay God. I'm a candidate for that. I'm here. I'm ready. I'm willing. I'm
[57:36] waiting. Move me into that realm. I'm tired of this dimension. I'm tired of the material. I'm
[57:43] tired of this just our emotions and all the things that we experience within the memory.
[57:50] Who wants to relive in their memory? We want to go on beyond our memory and our conscience. Oh,
[57:57] the conscience. All the conscience that it can have and the affections and all of those things.
[58:01] We want to rise to something else. I can tell you those senses will betray you. Amen. Amen.
[58:13] This may be a little humorous, but I mean I have I have looked at objects when I've
[58:17] been out hunting. I actually I actually stopped two moose that were laying down. I stopped them
[58:27] for I don't know how long cuz they're out in the open. They were laying down and they were laying
[58:34] and the grass was in front of them. I could see him as clear as could be. And I stalked him for
[58:38] about an hour or more. And when I finally got up close enough, it was a burnt log.
[58:47] I couldn't believe it. I was stalking this burnt log. It was just the grass that was in
[58:53] front of it. And I saw them move cuz it was an illusion. If you'd have told me,
[58:58] "Ah, forget it, Dad. That's just an old burnt log." I'd say, "Get down quick.
[59:05] you're going to spook them. And if somebody was up high and looking down on that thing, saw me
[59:17] creeping around getting down, you'd have had a good laugh like you're having right now. You can't
[59:27] trust the eyes. And then you get this one. Do you know what I heard? Soon as you hear that opening
[59:34] phrase, you want to plug these right now. You know what I heard? Yeah. They had a little game. Uh,
[59:44] you know, this is Wednesday night and we're home, but they had a little game when we were
[59:48] young people and they and they' all be in a great big circle and you had to whisper something in the
[59:55] first person's ear. You know what it's all about. And the first one would whisper and the next one
[1:00:00] would whisper what they you had to say exactly what you heard. And by the time it came around,
[1:00:05] the last person had to say the statement. I tell you what, never have I ever heard it come out
[1:00:12] the other end what went in. Not one single time because they didn't hear it just exactly right.
[1:00:19] We We don't want to trust what we hear, what we see. I'm interested in some other senses.
[1:00:25] I'm interested in a six sense. I'm interested in something that can reach up and get a hold
[1:00:29] of faith. I'm interested in something get a hold of the unseen and bring it down into this area
[1:00:35] here. Hallelujah. Are you interested in it, young men? Are you interested in that realm? What about
[1:00:41] you young ladies? Are we interested in it as a congregation? Interested in bringing down a
[1:00:46] power into our lives from another realm? Oh God, it'll make you a different kind of person. You'll
[1:00:55] live different. You'll think different. Your relationship will be different. When that comes
[1:00:59] down, then you'll look at one another and say, "I see God. God is in his people once again." Amen.
[1:01:07] Amen. He says in that message, but there's senses beyond that, another dimension. You know why I
[1:01:14] have such a confidence in in what brother Brandham is saying? Because I know from the hundreds and
[1:01:22] thousands of times they stood before the people that they could not testify anything but the truth
[1:01:29] and that was they were brought into the presence of God. And he said and God is always present.
[1:01:42] We ought to say that. Did you believe what he said? Yes. And God is always present. I
[1:01:50] will say furthermore, God is always here. God is here. You may not be conscious of
[1:01:57] it. You may not be aware of it. But almighty God who flung the stars in space is here in
[1:02:04] this building. Christ is here. The angels of God are here. And we need to come in
[1:02:09] here. We need to come into this building in that atmosphere that they are here.
[1:02:17] And the thing that God wants, the objective of the song service, the objective of the singers,
[1:02:23] the objective of the musicians, the objective of all of you coming together is one objective
[1:02:30] and that is that God may be amongst us and that we can become conscious of his presence. Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] And begin to have fellowship with himself. And the blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin.
[1:02:44] And we have fellowship with one another. And that's sweet. I'll tell you that's a
[1:02:48] trouble-free life. That's a trouble-free life. Hallelujah. I love this. He said,
[1:02:59] "If we could only remember that, God is always present." If we could only remember that. If you
[1:03:08] could only remember that tomorrow. If I could only remember it. I'm preaching to myself. We
[1:03:16] could only remember that. Listen to this closely now. The angels of the Lord are encamped. Oh, I
[1:03:22] know. Soon as we say that word encamp say, "Well, I I know that's the scripture. I've heard it many,
[1:03:27] many times." But in the context of the service tonight, God is always present. The angels of the
[1:03:35] Lord are encamped about them who fear him. In this building tonight, he said, "Stands Jesus Christ."
[1:03:43] I don't know who you think Jesus Christ is, but in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ.
[1:03:52] Regardless of how you feel, regardless of what kind of a day you had in this building,
[1:03:58] tonight stands Jesus Christ. The same one that walked the way to Calvary. The same one, the same
[1:04:06] one that walked along the shores of Galilee. You don't have to get into your memory channel now.
[1:04:11] You have to be in your present channel right now. It's Jesus Christ here now. Present now. And what
[1:04:18] a what a reason we have. We have more evidence and more reason to believe that than any people on the
[1:04:24] face of the earth. The mighty angel intercended with the open book in his hand. Not a closed book
[1:04:29] anymore. Open book in his hand. Hallelujah. And by and by the revelation of his word,
[1:04:37] that is his appearing. He appears. That's how you get sight. That's why I started out by saying
[1:04:45] just in simplicity, I I say, you know, I say carpenter, you don't think of an airplane pilot,
[1:04:51] right? You see, and God, there was things in the scripture, all kinds of things in the scripture.
[1:04:57] They say a certain thing, people have another view. people. You see, and the Apostle Paul sent
[1:05:06] them people abroad and they established elders. Somebody get if you said that to a Catholic,
[1:05:13] he'd probably think of a bishop with a red cap or a cardinal. He'd have an image of something else.
[1:05:22] People, the fact is today, they talk about an evangelist and it's something different.
[1:05:27] They get a different image in their mind than the word image. Talk about a pastor,
[1:05:31] they get a different image in their mind right away. Oh yeah. One of the things when I travel,
[1:05:37] I very rarely tell people I'm a minister. I'm a preacher. I don't like to tell them that because
[1:05:42] right away they get all that artificial gooey gooey gooey gooey religious attitude atmosphere.
[1:05:50] I want them just to be their raw self. You might as well be just exactly what you are and I'll be
[1:05:55] what I am. And then at the appropriate time, if it's necessary, I'll tell you I'm a preacher.
[1:06:02] The one guy I was hunting with, I wasn't hunting with him, but somebody else put him with me. Oh,
[1:06:07] he cussed. His mouth was no good. I just let him go on. So I knew he was walking
[1:06:15] into a horrible trap. And we were walking. I can still picture it. We're walking along. He says,
[1:06:22] "What what is it that you do, Ed?" I said, "I'm a preacher." Oh man, he just about dropped. Oh,
[1:06:31] he said, first thing he said, I've been using some pretty horrible language. I said,
[1:06:36] you might as well be what you are. And that's what I waited for to say be able to say, you might as
[1:06:42] well be what you are. I can tell you he didn't forget that in the next two minutes. He probably
[1:06:47] went home thinking, well, what am I? All of that trash coming out of me, speaking it in front of a
[1:06:53] minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a shame. I hope it shamed him into receiving Christ.
[1:07:03] In this building tonight is Jesus Christ. In this building tonight is host of angels. I haven't got
[1:07:12] the receiving set in my eyes that I could see them and behold them. But I'll tell you what,
[1:07:18] if your eyes were open at this moment, these little feeble eyes and if your ears
[1:07:23] could hear what is happening in another dimension, and if your eyes could see it,
[1:07:27] it would change you forever. But God doesn't want you to see with your eyes, he wants you
[1:07:34] to see it with faith. And when he said it in the word, you believe it. And when you believe it,
[1:07:41] God will make it a reality to you. And the reality is a revelation. And the revelation
[1:07:47] is sight. And with that kind of sight, with that kind of sight, you see his appearing.
[1:07:58] Hallelujah. I will say it this way. Brother Brandham's ministry came for the purpose so
[1:08:05] that people could see Christ in his appearing and in his coming. That is the purpose of the
[1:08:12] ministry. Listen now quickly. I'm going to close fairly soon. God said to Moses,
[1:08:20] and I'm not done this quote, but God said to Moses, let me just get the scripture.
[1:08:35] He said, uh, "My angel
[1:08:42] will go before you." The Lord spoke to Moses,
[1:08:49] "Behold, I send an angel before thee." This is what he's commissioned to do,
[1:08:56] to keep thee in the way. Amen. This angel isn't going along just to, you know, tickle his fancy.
[1:09:06] He's got a purpose. He been commissioned. Could Moses see him? No. He couldn't see him any more
[1:09:13] than you can see him. He couldn't touch him. He had to believe the word that was being spoken to
[1:09:20] him that the angel is there. And he believed it. Amen. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. He believed
[1:09:29] it. A prophet said, "Elijah said to you, a host of angels are in the building tonight." Say, "Oh,
[1:09:38] that was back there." Well, let me just inform you that when God told them that the angel of the Lord
[1:09:45] would go with them and what and and and uh keep them in the way and bring them into the place
[1:09:52] which I have prepared. The angel will bring you into that place. Now I'll read this quote. Listen,
[1:10:00] listen. Now close. And brother Brandham says in this building stands Jesus Christ in this
[1:10:05] building tonight as host of angels thousands of them gathered around. You don't see them but you
[1:10:13] can feel their the influence of them. And he said that you can feel the influence of them telling
[1:10:20] you that they are here. Amen. Amen. So, Brother Bam talked about a a sinner man and he said,
[1:10:29] and you're in a meeting and you got a little funny feeling and you said to yourself, "Oh,
[1:10:38] it it it'll go away. It'll go away. You know, I'm just I'll just get out and get get beside
[1:10:44] myself." And that little funny feeling was the actual spirit of God, the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:10:50] to his heart. trying to bring him from sin into salvation, from hell into heaven. And
[1:10:59] that little funny feeling, just a little funny feeling. Sometime you've been in the service,
[1:11:04] you've sat right here in this service and you feel a little funny feeling. You think, well, you know,
[1:11:10] maybe I I don't know exactly what it is. It's the angels of God trying to tell you, we are here.
[1:11:20] We are here. And our purpose, our purpose is to bring you to bring such an atmosphere. So you'll
[1:11:26] come into a place of fellowship with God who we've been raised and created to worship and you're the
[1:11:34] redeemed. We have a place that they don't have. They're sent as messengers. Be with my people. Be
[1:11:41] with my children. Attend to them. Speak to them. Let them feel your influence and your presence.
[1:11:49] But we're so earthbound. We're so material conscious. We're so timeconcious that God can't
[1:11:56] have a chance to get through to us. I say, "Oh, God, pull back the barriers of this generation."
[1:12:05] I tell you something, friends, that's what I hunger after. And you can you can just say,
[1:12:12] "I'm with you, brother Ed. I'm with you. I hunger after it." And if blessed are you that hunger and
[1:12:19] thirst after righteousness, you shall be filled. This isn't just for a select few. And long after
[1:12:27] the pillar of fire was gone, long after the pillar of cloud was gone, long after Moses was dead,
[1:12:37] and those things long after the prophet was gone, stood a stood Joshua and said, "Now,
[1:12:44] when you see the ark move, I learned this long time ago. When you see the ark move, get out and
[1:12:50] move with it." Hallelujah. because he knew that was the presence of God. He knew that was God in
[1:12:59] the camp. When you see the ark move, move with it. When is the ark moving? When the preacher's
[1:13:05] preaching. Hallelujah. The ark is moving because God is speaking things to you. And you see things
[1:13:13] by revelation. God uses a tool of revelation to get through to his people and appear to you.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah. We should be able to go out of church and say, "What kind of meeting did you have?" I
[1:13:28] saw God. I saw God. How did you see him in the moving of the word? The word moved. He
[1:13:37] hid himself in a pillar of fire. He hid himself in the province. He hid himself in the pillar
[1:13:41] of cloud. He hid himself in the whirlwind. He hid himself in the burning bush. And he hides himself
[1:13:46] now in his word. But he also reveals himself in his word by revelation. And the reasoning won't
[1:13:52] do it. Intellect won't do it. But a humble heart. Hallelujah. A humble heart of faith will do it.
[1:14:06] When will God stop appearing? He won't stop appearing till he stops moving. Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] And this move that angel, he said, "The angel will go before you to bring you into the land."
[1:14:20] And Joshua, he told him, "When you see the ark, move, move, move with it." Cuz they were they
[1:14:26] were progressing in that. When the woman came into his presence and touched the hem of his garment,
[1:14:33] her objective was healing. And that's what she received. In this day, that angel,
[1:14:39] now you may think me a fanatic, that angel of the Lord that stood by that prophet. Amen. The
[1:14:44] reason he stood there was because of what was going to be uttered out of his mouth.
[1:14:50] To watch over what came out of his mouth. And out of his mouth finally came a message. That
[1:14:57] angel will never leave that message because the purpose of that angel is to take the hearers of
[1:15:04] it into a rapture. That's the purpose of it. That's his only purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:15:12] We can say I saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. My brother,
[1:15:18] my sister, that's the purpose of the angel of the Lord, the presence of the angel of
[1:15:23] the Lord. Telling you the host of angels are here to persuade you. We are here. Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] Hallelujah. and the angel of the Lord, which is none other than the angel of the covenant, which
[1:15:36] is none other than the spirit of Jesus Christ, which is none other than the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:15:43] And his purpose, he's been already ordained. Take them.
[1:15:51] Take them into this land. Hallelujah. Take them. They are under commission.
[1:16:00] And you need to understand it tonight that God has commissioned mighty angels
[1:16:05] to guide the people directly into their promised inheritance.
[1:16:12] Oh, don't you want to go? Don't you want to go?
[1:16:23] He said they're trying to tell you that they're here. Amen. Oh God. Oh God. Don't let me have
[1:16:31] such dull ears. Don't let me be in such a stuper. Don't let me be so numb. Brother Brandon talks
[1:16:38] about this generation can make us so numb. As I said to the people as I closed in Virginia,
[1:16:44] I said, you know, we're here and we're here in a meeting tonight. As we were there,
[1:16:50] we were there in some special meetings, but this is a this is a place. This is a retreat. for this
[1:16:56] is a reprieve from the world. But 5 minutes out that door, you are in Satan's hell. You're
[1:17:04] rubbing shoulders with demonpossessed people. And don't forget, they can put on nice clothes
[1:17:10] and be in a suit or be whatever, but don't forget what it is. That world out there is unclean. And
[1:17:18] Satan's objective is to contaminate you. Satan's Satan's objective is to separate you from this
[1:17:26] divine presence. You want to walk out of here and say, "Nothing shall separate me from the presence
[1:17:32] and the love of God." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe it? Is this your determination,
[1:17:41] your resolve? I pray for you as a congregation. I pray, oh God, I've been praying now for some
[1:17:48] time. Give us those times. return us. Oh God, I'm not I'm not looking for something in the past. I'm
[1:17:56] looking for something that is here now. I just want us to break into it. It's for you boys.
[1:18:03] It's for you young people. It's for everybody here from the youngest to the eldest. It's from
[1:18:08] you that's burdened with families. It's you have got problems and financial difficulties. It's you
[1:18:12] that's without work in whatever state you might be in. It's you that may have troubles and burdens.
[1:18:18] Let me tell you, they'll go on. They'll continue to be here. But what I'm talking about tonight is
[1:18:24] something divine and something glorious and it is for you. It is your portion. Don't let that
[1:18:33] enemy rob you of it. Don't let him steal it away from you. I want you to declare right now, it is
[1:18:40] mine. It belongs to me. I claim it in the name of Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, heavenly father,
[1:18:50] oh God, you that have provided us and have given this inheritance, may I pray this people, Lord,
[1:18:58] may we we don't intend to fall short. We don't intend to let the enemy rob it from us. We don't
[1:19:04] intend to stand back and hold back and let him go hob hobnail over our over our inheritance. But
[1:19:12] we stand tonight as a mighty army of the redeemed with the captain of the host of God's army leading
[1:19:19] us onward. Hallelujah. Lead these people, I pray. Lead them, I pray, into a glorious victory. Lord,
[1:19:29] bless our fellowship with you, Lord. Bless our fellowship with one another. Sweet fellowship. Oh,
[1:19:36] fellowship. Wonderful. Lord Jesus, bless the Lord, oh my soul and all that is within me. Bless
[1:19:46] his holy name. Oh Lord, we want to be in sweet fellowship with you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I
[1:19:57] sense him so near friends. Not an emotion but the person of Jesus Christ. Blessed be your name Lord.
[1:20:09] Oh, bless the holy name of God. We enter into sweet fellowship with you. Why don't we take
[1:20:19] and stand if you would please? Oh, this sweet fellowship, oh Lord, how wonderful,
[1:20:29] how glorious you are. Bless the Lord. Let us just sing it. Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:20:37] and all that is within me. If you don't need the words, don't bother looking at it. Just close your
[1:20:43] eyes, and enter into a sweet communion. Let's not stay in contact with this natural material world,
[1:20:51] but let our spirits soar now. Let our souls reach out into this promised land for the believer.
[1:21:03] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy
[1:21:23] name.
[1:21:29] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy
[1:21:47] holy name.
[1:21:53] For he has done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things.
[1:22:10] Bless his holy. He has done great things. He has done great things.
[1:22:23] Oh, he has done great things. He has done great. Bless his holy
[1:22:38] name.
[1:22:42] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:22:46] What a blessed Christ.
[1:22:51] What a lovely Christ.
[1:22:56] I'm reaching out to you, Lord. I'm reaching out to you. My your heart is not. It can reach me, too.
[1:23:20] And as I pray, press my way into your kingdom.
[1:23:31] I know the life, reaching out as a testimony.
[1:23:42] I'm reaching out. Reaching out and reaching out to you. My arm is not
[1:23:56] too short. You can reach me too. And as I pray and press my way into your kingdom.
[1:24:14] I'll grow to be more like you just reaching out. You know, it wouldn't do a person any good to
[1:24:25] press. You could press all you wanted unless he made a way. Unless he gave the invitation
[1:24:31] when he comes near with his presence. That's an invitation. He's inviting you. Brother Brandham
[1:24:38] says, "Every time he's invited, he comes." Amen. Think about that. Every time he's invited,
[1:24:51] he comes. Would you dare put that to the test tonight? Hallelujah. I'm coming on
[1:24:59] the basis of a vindicated word. Every time he's invited, he comes. What do you want? an average
[1:25:07] Wednesday service or do you want to say this is going to be a special time? I'm going to invite
[1:25:12] him. I have an authorative voice. Every time he come and he's invited, he comes.
[1:25:23] Does it take a big prayer? No. Just I invite you. I invite you. There's no barriers. There's
[1:25:31] nothing restraining. I invite you. Why don't why just invite him before we sing it again? Lord,
[1:25:39] we invite you. This congregation of people invite you in whatever situation we find
[1:25:46] ourselves in. We invite you right to where we are. Oh Lord, blessed Jesus,
[1:25:56] Lamb of God, you're worthy of all of our life. All that I am or ever can be,
[1:26:05] you're worthy of it. I owe it to you. Take us, Lord. Take us, Lord. Take this congregation. Take
[1:26:16] the words that have been spoken and especially the motive for speaking it. Lord, oh God, bring,
[1:26:29] I pray, this precious flock of people into your divine presence. Utter things to their soul.
[1:26:42] Utter things, oh God, that will loose the feathers of some that are perhaps yet in bondage tonight.
[1:26:53] You want to be a companion to some. You want to be
[1:26:56] a comforter to others. You want to be an emancipator and a deliverer.
[1:27:03] Oh God, why would anyone remain with shackles on them when they want us here to deliver out
[1:27:12] of prison, out of the bars, out of the hold of the enemy? Oh God, may it be a a complete and
[1:27:23] instant response tonight. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Touch every soul. I'll ask every believer that
[1:27:36] believes in what you've heard tonight to unite in one pull for every last purpose of God to
[1:27:44] be accomplished in this meeting. Every soul is in need of healing, let them be healed.
[1:27:52] Everyone physically that's in need of healing, the presence of God is here now. That divine one,
[1:28:01] reach out. Yes, I accept the full payment and the
[1:28:10] full efficacy of Calvary for my need now. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:28:22] Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] I'm reaching out to you, dear Lord. Reaching out.
[1:28:40] Oh, your arm it's not too short and you can reach. Oh, you have reached us, Lord.
[1:28:53] I press my way into your kingdom.
[1:29:01] I'll grow to be more like Jesus, reaching out. He's the great emancipator.
[1:29:18] Once my heart and soul was
[1:29:26] singing it from your heart by the mighty chain of sing
[1:29:36] but something happened by the great manip.
[1:29:48] Set me free to worship him. Worship him. Oh glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah.
[1:30:06] Blessed be his holy name.
[1:30:15] Oh, he the great man's defeated.
[1:30:23] Oh, give him glory now. The son of the redeemed.
[1:30:34] and lie. I lost lamb. I was
[1:30:48] the Lord.
[1:30:53] How the seeking shepherd found? Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:31:05] to my father's home father's home. Oh, glory,
[1:31:12] glory, glory. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord. Send me his holy name.
[1:31:30] He the great image
[1:31:41] the song of the redee like a lost lamb and like a lost lamb I was free. Yes, I was Lord
[1:32:00] so helpless and alone.
[1:32:07] But the seeking shepherd found he found me led me to father's father. Oh glory, glory, glory.
[1:32:31] Hallelujah. Blessed be holy name. Holy name. I hear the great immigration.
[1:32:52] And that's the song the redeemed once my soul once my soul.
[1:33:09] Oh, so better by the binding change of s.
[1:33:18] Oh, but the seeking shepherd thou found me Lord. Let me worship him. Worship him. Oh,
[1:33:36] glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] Oh, blessing be holy name. I'll drink it in Lord the great
[1:34:04] and that's the song of love just once again. Oh, glory, glory,
[1:34:15] glory, mighty name. Oh, we bless your name, Lord. Oh, we blessed your name,
[1:34:22] Lord. Let me be worship him now. holy name and the great immens
[1:34:41] the song of glory.
[1:34:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] Blessed be that holy name. Glory.
[1:35:04] Oh, what a friend. Oh, what a friend. Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord in the midst
[1:35:16] of your defeat. Praise the Lord in the midst of your need. Hallelujah.
[1:35:25] Oh, hallelujah. He desires to give it more than we even desire to receive it. What a gracious Christ.
[1:35:41] Oh, what a friend.
[1:35:53] to hold my hand
[1:35:59] and save me.
[1:36:04] Save in his arms.
[1:36:10] He always hides me. Oh, what a friend. What a friend he is. Here
[1:36:25] it is for everybody now. Jes
[1:36:41] around
[1:36:46] my way and
[1:36:51] lead me
[1:36:59] empty.
[1:37:02] Oh, what a friend.
[1:37:08] He is
[1:37:16] just in this atmosphere. I tell you what I said just before I left here. I get hungry. I get
[1:37:25] hungry. Brother Brandham say I get hungry just to see that little smile. Brother Cox's face. I
[1:37:32] get hungry. I get hungry for some things that you know the devil like to just rob us of it.
[1:37:42] Don't let him rob you. Brother Daniel Harp.
[1:37:47] I get hungry to hear you sing. I hunger to hear you sing.
[1:37:56] I don't have to speak for everyone else, but I I speak for myself. I get hungry to hear that voice,
[1:38:04] hear him sing. I get hungry for that divine presence of God. And that is why I believe we
[1:38:12] have to preach the word till every demon is bound and cast out everything that is
[1:38:20] out of our midst so that the Holy Spirit is so free to be around us and be amongst us
[1:38:26] and move amongst us. Well, may the will of the Lord be done in every life. My prayer.
[1:38:35] If you haven't got this intimate relationship with this friend, don't let them just be, you know,
[1:38:42] some Jesus of past. The word is moving. I tell you in the authority of God's word,
[1:38:48] the ark is moving. And when you see it moving, when you hear it, you see it on the shoulders of
[1:38:57] the priests and they speak, they're packing the word and God strikes your soul with revelation.
[1:39:04] You have an appearance of Christ. Then you enter into fellowship and God's objective is met.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] You know what we experienced at camp? That's going to continue right on. I have that confidence where
[1:39:28] those meetings going to continue right on. You believe we can just continue to have it?
[1:39:35] Hallelujah. Bless the Lord. I'm just not going to let the devil steal anything
[1:39:43] from me. I'm going to be happy and I'm going to rejoice in my re salvation.
[1:39:51] Hallelujah.
[1:39:54] Let me say this before we close.
[1:39:58] The very thing that troubles you so deeply. If somebody is troubled, the very thing if you just
[1:40:04] drop dead right now, where would that thing be? Where would it be? It'd be where it should be.
[1:40:11] Just passed away. That's where it ought to be right now. Just let it pass away. Hallelujah.
[1:40:20] Just doesn't pay to mull over it and mull over it and chew over it. Just let it die. go on with God.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. That's what I believe. That's what I want to practice with everything that's in me.
[1:40:42] I appreciate you. Appreciate you coming here with the young families with their babies. But
[1:40:49] I'll never be sorry for recommending you to do it. Urging you to do it. Hallelujah. The
[1:40:57] girl at the piano came to her first meeting just days old and we drove,
[1:41:03] but she just went there days old and she's been in it ever since.
[1:41:10] Break them in young. Hallelujah. Let them know that atmosphere.
[1:41:20] Hallelujah. All right. I want a friend
[1:41:30] who walks beside me.
[1:41:36] He knows the way
[1:41:44] I
[1:41:48] in his arms.
[1:41:53] You always
[1:42:04] he
[1:42:10] knows the way
[1:42:16] I know.
[1:42:22] He can see around
[1:42:27] my
[1:42:32] he
[1:42:40] is ending.
[1:42:44] Oh, what a friend
[1:42:50] he is to
[1:42:55] ask brother Tom to come and close us in prayer. Would you please Brother Tom? God bless you.
[1:43:05] Lord, as we've heard your word, we've watered it with praise. We can say that angel is my friend.
[1:43:18] He's led me. He's guided me. He's kept me in the way. And we say, "Praise be to your holy name,
[1:43:25] Lord." And Father, I'm asking now as we go our separate ways that we would put our hand in the
[1:43:32] hand of that man that you see around the wind, the winding way. Lord, you see around the corner
[1:43:40] what's coming down the way. Lord, we're putting our trust in you and we're asking Lord that your
[1:43:47] faithfulness will show us through. And father, we do love your presence. And we can truly say,
[1:43:54] Lord, by that six sense, mine eyes have seen the glory of your presence here this evening. We pray,
[1:44:01] Lord, that you'll go with each and every one of us as we've heard faithful daddies at their posted
[1:44:05] duty tonight. Mothers, Lord, here raising their children under the sound of the gospel. Lord,
[1:44:11] it's pure. It's holy, and we love it. We pray, Lord, that you will go with each and every one
[1:44:17] of us, our pastor, how we love him. And Lord, we just pray that you will guide his way,
[1:44:22] make it fruitful, be his guide, be his protection, Lord, as he will have a time and a season away,
[1:44:29] but not from the presence of God as we heard tonight. Lord,
[1:44:32] would you keep them and bring them back safely? And may God, they come back with renewed vision,
[1:44:39] vigor, and strength. We pray be with your people now in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:44:47] Maybe while you're standing yet not dismissed, my sister wanted prayer. Ann,
[1:44:52] would you like to come to prayer? Let's let's let's just sing. Would you mind?
[1:44:58] Don't mind joining with us in prayer. All things are possible. Only believe.
[1:45:18] All things are
[1:45:24] holy,
[1:45:30] holy,
[1:45:36] holy.
[1:45:42] All things are possible.
[1:46:01] Holy.
[1:46:07] All things are possible. Holy.
[1:46:31] All things are impossible.
[1:47:07] story
[1:47:24] has sinned. shall be healed
[1:47:31] there. Resist it in the name of Jesus Christ. And as we already pray this season, let it wither
[1:47:52] already.
[1:47:58] We know that you've heard them and now we join with them.
[1:48:14] standing to give you glory. I want to thank you praise
[1:48:23] for all the great things you've done. We thank you Lord
[1:48:34] God on our behalf.
[1:48:41] Oh God, let your soul sore.
[1:48:57] Blessed be the name.
[1:49:36] of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:44] You're the one that
[1:49:48] you're the one that defeated the enemy. cast them out for you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:02] living
[1:50:06] history
[1:50:13] now that it's okay.
