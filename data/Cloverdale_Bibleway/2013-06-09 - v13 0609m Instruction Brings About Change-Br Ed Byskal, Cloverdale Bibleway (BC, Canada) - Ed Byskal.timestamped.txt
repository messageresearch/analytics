[9:28] [Music]
[9:32] Oh, we need you, Lord.
[9:36] We need you, Lord,
[9:38] right now.
[9:45] We lift our hands.
[9:48] We bow our knees
[9:51] and worship by your

[10:03] Oh, can we make it personal this
[10:05] morning? Oh, just look to him this

[10:18] this morning. Lord, I need you.
[10:24] I need you.
[10:27] [Music]
[10:29] Standing in the need of prayer this
[10:30] morning. Lord, I lift my hand.
[10:35] I knew
[10:39] you.
[10:44] I need you, Lord.
[10:47] I need you, Lord.
[10:50] Oh, could we stand together this morning
[10:52] as we sing it one more time? Oh, I need
[10:56] you, Lord.

[11:39] Hallelujah.
[11:41] Hallelujah. The cry of our heart this
[11:44] morning, Lord.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Very opposed to an age of Leoa where
[11:49] they're in need of nothing. But we need
[11:50] you this morning, Lord.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; We stand in need, oh God.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, we need a change in the body.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, change our heart this morning.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Needs in our hearts, Lord. Needs in our
[12:04] lives. Jesus, would you step upon the
[12:07] seat this morning?
[12:10] Hallelujah.
[12:12] I need you, Lord. Could we just sing it
[12:14] one more time? I believe it's a truth
[12:17] this morning. We need the Lord to come
[12:20] upon the scene this morning. We need him
[12:22] to do something in our midst this
[12:24] morning.
[12:26] The world is headed for a tribulation,
[12:28] but there's a bride that's getting ready
[12:30] for a rapture. The cry of our heart this
[12:33] morning is, "I need you, Lord." We need
[12:36] the bridegroom this morning to come upon
[12:38] the scene.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, as we just sing it one more time.
[12:43] Just close your eyes. Lift up your hands
[12:45] this morning. If you have a need upon
[12:48] your heart, just place it before him now
[12:50] as we sing it.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord,
[12:55] right now.
[12:57] I need you, Lord.
[13:00] I need you, Lord,
[13:03] right now.
[13:05] Wherever our situation is this morning.
[13:09] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[13:12] I need you, Lord.
[13:15] Right now.
[13:18] I lift my hand.
[13:24] Oh, I b my knees
[13:28] and worship
[13:30] your
[13:34] I need you Lord.
[13:37] I need you Lord right now.
[13:44] Hallelujah.
[13:45] Ask a brother Tim Dodd to come this
[13:47] morning.
[13:50] Lead the congregation in prayer. the
[13:53] deacons would come prepare to receive
[13:56] the morning offering this morning. Want
[13:58] to remember Sister Grace Bey this
[14:00] morning. Pray for Daniel at home,
[14:04] sick, not feeling well. We just want to
[14:07] remember that need this morning. If you
[14:09] have a need upon your heart, maybe you
[14:11] want to just lift it before the Lord as
[14:13] we go to prayer this morning. Brother
[14:14] Tim, if you'd come. Thank you.
[14:21] Oh heavenly father,
[14:24] author of life,
[14:26] you are alone are the giver of every
[14:28] good gift.
[14:30] Everything, oh Lord, that we have need
[14:32] of this morning is in you. And we come
[14:36] unto your throne of grace. We come,
[14:39] Lord, approaching your presence,
[14:41] knowing, Lord, that you're our father.
[14:44] That Lord, if we ask for a fish, you'll
[14:46] not give us a serpent. If we ask for
[14:48] bread, you'll not give us a stone. But
[14:50] Lord, you have promised to give us every
[14:52] good thing that pertains unto life and
[14:55] happiness. We look into your word and we
[14:58] believe those promises this morning. And
[15:00] Lord, no matter how much we need you, we
[15:03] know you're ever present to meet those
[15:04] needs. And Lord, as we stand this
[15:07] morning, the one thing we need is more
[15:09] of you, Lord. More of your love, more of
[15:11] your grace, more of your presence to
[15:14] fill us, oh God. overflow us, oh God, in
[15:16] this service this morning. We want you
[15:18] to take the divine preeminence over
[15:20] every part. Lord, may you anoint the
[15:23] speaker, our brother, our pastor. Lord,
[15:26] as he comes to bring the word, we're
[15:28] desiring, oh Lord, that you'll fill our
[15:29] hungry souls. We're desiring, Lord, that
[15:32] you lift us a little bit higher. Draw us
[15:34] a little bit closer to you. Make us a
[15:36] little bit more like you this morning,
[15:38] Lord. Father, take every need this

[16:44] us.
[16:46] Amen. Where he is, great things are
[16:48] happening. Amen. Disciples were
[16:50] frustrated one day. They were on a boat
[16:53] fishing. Hadn't caught a thing all night
[16:54] pulling into the shore. The Lord Jesus
[16:57] was present. Great things had happened.
[17:00] Amen. He said, "Just drop your net on
[17:01] the wrong on the other side of the
[17:02] boat." Amen. He knew where the fish
[17:04] were. He knows where you are this

[17:08] here this morning that needs a to be
[17:10] caught in the Lord's net. Amen. I
[17:12] believe he's here to cast the net this
[17:14] morning and draw us to himself. Amen.
[17:17] Our pastor is going to be coming in just
[17:19] a moment. We do want to make mention of
[17:22] uh a couple of those that are visiting
[17:25] with us this morning. Maybe we could

[24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Well, we'll have you have your seat and
[24:42] we're going to ask our brother Kyle
[24:44] Morton if he will approach the
[24:50] front here, the podium. We're going to
[24:52] have a ordination service
[24:55] &gt;&gt; for our brother Kyle.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Kyle, we're
[25:08] um indeed privileged to
[25:11] have this time of this service and
[25:14] neither do we want to rush through it.
[25:17] The scripture said
[25:20] Isaiah 6:8 also I heard the voice of the
[25:23] Lord saying
[25:25] whom shall I send and who shall go for
[25:29] us then said I here am I send me and I I
[25:36] would like to have the congregation join
[25:39] us and while we sing a verse or two and
[25:42] brother Derek you'll help help us
[25:46] Uh, hear the word, hear the Lord of the
[25:49] harvest sweetly calling. And the prophet
[25:52] of God sang this often. Who will go and
[25:54] work for me today?
[25:57] Who will bring to me the lost and dying?
[26:01] Who will point them to the narrow way?
[26:04] Speak my Lord. And that's for everybody.
[26:07] Speak my Lord. Lead me. This isn't for
[26:11] one person, but this is for all of us as
[26:13] a congregation
[26:15] and especially for you. When we sing,
[26:18] Brother Kyle, our thoughts will be
[26:20] directed toward you. When the coal of
[26:22] fire touched the prophet,
[26:25] making him as pure as pure can be. When
[26:29] the voice of God said, "Who will go for
[26:31] us?" Then he said, "Here am I, send me."
[26:35] And while we may not be prophets, but we
[26:38] have the message of God's prophet
[26:41] messenger.
[26:42] And in one of the services uh they were
[26:45] having a dedication and a men a man came
[26:48] forward and he wanted to be ordained
[26:52] just spontaneously
[26:54] and brother Brandham said I I don't know
[26:57] if I recognize you. And he said I come
[27:00] here to church.
[27:02] And he said where where are you from? He
[27:04] said, "I'm from the Salvation Army." He
[27:07] said, "Well, they've done a good work
[27:10] and uh we we appreciate that, brother,
[27:13] and we're going to ordain him," he said,
[27:15] "to the ministry." He said, "But but we
[27:19] have a message." And he was very clear,
[27:22] "But we have a message to that God has
[27:24] given us to give out." So, he was
[27:27] letting the brother know that's where he
[27:28] was being ordained to. But we would like
[27:31] to sing together. Why don't you stand
[27:33] one more time, would you, as our brother
[27:36] Kyle stands and then we will continue on
[27:39] with the we're going to just sing the
[27:42] two verses, the first and the second
[27:44] verse.
[27:48] Here the Lord of Harvest is sweetly
[27:51] calling,
[27:54] who will go and work for me today?
[28:00] Who will bring to me the lost and dying?
[28:06] Who will point them to the narrow way?
[28:12] Speak my Lord.
[28:16] Speak my Lord.
[28:20] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[28:26] Speak my Lord.
[28:29] Speak my Lord.
[28:34] Speak and I will answer. Oh Lord, send
[28:39] me.
[28:42] When the coal of fire touch the prophet,
[28:48] making him as pure as pure can be.
[28:53] When the voice of God said, "Who go for
[28:57] us?"
[28:59] Then he answered, "Here I sent me.
[29:05] Speak my Lord.
[29:08] Speak my Lord.
[29:12] Speak and I will wait to answer thee.
[29:18] Speak my Lord.
[29:22] Speak my Lord.
[29:26] Speak and I will answer. Lord,
[29:33] &gt;&gt; congregation may be seated.
[29:38] The scripture speaks, brother Kyle, and
[29:42] to everyone.
[29:45] Ephesians, Paul said, "Wherefore he
[29:47] seth, when he ascended up on high, he
[29:50] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[29:54] unto man."
[29:56] And I've seen this gift in your life,
[29:58] Brother Kyle.
[30:01] Paul said to Timothy, "But continue thou
[30:04] in the things that thou hast learned,
[30:07] and hast been assured of, knowing of
[30:11] whom thou hast learned
[30:14] them.
[30:17] and that from a child thou hast known
[30:21] the holy scriptures which are able to
[30:23] make thee wise unto salvation through
[30:27] faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
[30:30] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[30:34] and is profitable for doctrine, for
[30:36] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[30:40] in righteousness, that the man of God
[30:43] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[30:47] unto all good works.
[30:51] Paul also said in Corinthians he said
[30:54] that now there are diversities of gifts
[30:56] but the same spirit diver differences of
[31:00] administration
[31:02] but the same Lord diversities of
[31:05] operations
[31:06] but it is the same God that workketh all
[31:09] in all and here's one of my foundation
[31:13] scriptures of the foundation in in my
[31:15] life that I have used as guidance
[31:19] but The manifestation,
[31:22] that's verse 7 of 1 Corinthians 12, but
[31:25] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[31:28] to every man to profit with all. And I I
[31:33] have noticed throughout my life, there
[31:36] have been those that have been very uh
[31:40] energetic and happy and enthused about
[31:43] ministering. They wanted to preach and
[31:46] uh and I have seen them and they've had
[31:49] opportunity to stand up and preach. But
[31:52] I found that when they were done, the
[31:54] one that stood behind the pulpit was the
[31:56] only one that really got inspired. They
[31:58] got so excited and just happy and
[32:01] giggling and laughing and having a
[32:02] wonderful time, but the congregation
[32:05] wasn't getting it. I watched when
[32:07] brother Kyle got up and ministered in
[32:10] his unique manner which he has and
[32:15] sometimes would say things that kind of
[32:18] you know make a person think and go
[32:21] sideways and you know have to come from
[32:24] a different direction. Uh but I saw the
[32:27] people were benefited and the last time
[32:29] you spoke uh brother Kyle
[32:32] uh I heard before I got home I already
[32:35] had emails more than one and from uh I
[32:39] would say uh senior people uh that were
[32:42] benefited that disappointments are God's
[32:46] appointments and I can tell you that
[32:49] that is uh that is something that we
[32:51] could all do well to remember and put
[32:54] down in our memory bank disappointments
[32:58] are God's appointments.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; I mean then we exercise the scripture.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; So we have seen that ministry
[33:08] uh in you brother Kyle. So we're not
[33:10] doing this as a mere formality.
[33:14] Brother Kyle and Sister Christina his
[33:17] wife will be leaving uh tomorrow and uh
[33:22] they're going to be going east. They're
[33:25] going to be spending a little time going
[33:27] to go down to Jeffersonville. They want
[33:29] to visit there. Then there, Brother Kyle
[33:33] will be speaking at Bible believers of
[33:36] Lima at brother Craig Boore's church.
[33:40] Brother Craig Boore will be the camp
[33:42] speaker this year. Uh but he has asked,
[33:46] Brother Craig Bour has asked Brother
[33:48] Kyle. He heard him and he felt a need to
[33:52] have that kind of ministry amongst his
[33:55] young people and his people. So he will
[33:58] be going there. I thought it was
[34:03] kind of uh special.
[34:06] I didn't realize it until just the last
[34:09] minute when I was in my study, Brother
[34:11] Kyle. But brother Brham was ordaining uh
[34:15] brother a brother McKenna and I knew
[34:19] him.
[34:21] Uh brother McKenna was the pastor in
[34:23] Lima, Ohio.
[34:25] And here you're going to be probably
[34:27] preaching one of your first services
[34:29] down there and and some of the people
[34:33] that brother McKenna was pastor of will
[34:37] be sitting while you minister. Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And here, brother Brandham
[34:45] ordained brother McKenna and he says
[34:48] he's got a little group in Ohio in Lime,
[34:50] Ohio.
[34:52] And here I am. And I felt honored to
[34:56] have you, Brother Kyle, and to know that
[34:59] in a few days you'll be ministering and
[35:02] speaking to some of the same people that
[35:04] Brother McKenna spoke to and pastored.
[35:08] and he he was hurt very seriously in an
[35:11] auto accident and never really fully
[35:13] recovered.
[35:16] Uh brother Brandham said now these
[35:20] outward expressions
[35:22] and we see brother McKenna who has who
[35:26] has seen the light of the gospel
[35:29] that we see represented and expressed in
[35:33] your life. Brother Kyle, we believe him.
[35:36] A lovely brother, got a nice family, and
[35:40] he's come to us and he's trying to hold
[35:42] a little group together there in Ohio
[35:45] with brother and sister Dao and the rest
[35:49] of the brethren there. And we love him
[35:52] and we believe him to be a man called of
[35:56] God.
[35:57] We bring them before this congregation,
[36:01] giving this testimony
[36:03] as like manner, as you've heard, laying
[36:07] hands on them that we believe that
[36:10] they're called of God and give our
[36:13] sanction to it and ask God's blessing to
[36:17] go with them. And that's what we are
[36:19] going to do now. Uh he said that's
[36:22] exactly the way they did it in the Bible
[36:26] was lay hands upon them in ordination.
[36:30] They laid hands upon the deacons. They
[36:33] and put them in the church. Everything
[36:35] was by laying on of hands. Not signing a
[36:39] bunch of papers and joining a certain
[36:41] creed or something like that. They laid
[36:44] hands on and turned them loose in the
[36:48] Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and let
[36:51] them go. Amen. God led him the way he
[36:55] wants to and that's all that's the way
[36:58] we believe in doing it. Laying on of
[37:01] hands doesn't impart anything to our
[37:04] brother. It is the blessing of God. We
[37:07] are asking the blessing of God and we
[37:09] are recognizing what God has already
[37:11] given.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll ask the brothers to come
[37:15] and we will uh turn and face the
[37:18] congregation if you would brother Kyle
[37:20] with uh other brothers. How many people
[37:23] have been blessed by brother Kyle's
[37:25] ministry? There we have the testimony.
[37:28] We believe him to be a man of God. And
[37:31] we'll just sing once more if we would
[37:33] please. Speak my Lord.
[37:42] Speak my Lord.
[37:47] Speak and I'll be waiting to answer
[37:50] thee.
[37:53] Speak my own.
[37:57] Speak my Lord.
[38:02] Speak and
[38:05] answer.
[38:09] And if everyone now would just bow your
[38:11] heads and we'll pray together as we lay
[38:13] hands upon our brother.
[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[38:20] we're standing here in a holy sacred
[38:23] moment.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; We have seen truly
[38:28] your hand laid upon brother Kyle before
[38:31] we dare lay our hand on him. And we
[38:34] believe that your gift, oh God, when you
[38:37] ascended, you gave gifts unto men. We
[38:41] pray that you will take this gift, that
[38:43] you will cultivate it, that you will
[38:46] mold it, oh God, that your Holy Spirit
[38:49] will guide our brother Kyle, that you'll
[38:53] speak to him things, Father, that he has
[38:55] not thus far known. That it'll be a
[38:59] divine revelation, oh God. that your
[39:02] word will be so clear to him.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask that you'll make him
[39:07] unmovable.
[39:08] I pray that you'll give him boldness,
[39:10] Father. That he'll have no fear of man,
[39:15] but he'll say that which you confirm in
[39:17] his heart, that he'll speak with love
[39:20] and concern for the bride of Jesus
[39:23] Christ. And that he might realize he
[39:26] represents a vindicated message, not
[39:29] something learned in a theological
[39:31] school, but something that you will
[39:33] teach him. For you have said that the
[39:36] Holy Spirit will lead you into all
[39:39] truth. We lay our hands upon our brother
[39:42] Kyle Morton to ordain him, oh God, into
[39:46] this ministry.
[39:48] For that we have a message to tell to
[39:50] the world and a message to preach. I
[39:53] pray you'll bless his wife, Sister
[39:55] Christine. Pray, oh God, that she shall
[39:58] indeed be the encouragement and the
[40:01] helpmate for him. Bless his children, oh
[40:05] God. Let his home and family be an
[40:08] example, an example home, an example
[40:12] ministry, an example wife to the
[40:15] ministry, an example children in the
[40:19] name of Jesus Christ. We loose him, oh
[40:23] God, that the Holy Spirit may take his
[40:28] take him completely and use him. Thank
[40:30] you, Lord Jesus. You'll provide for him,
[40:32] oh God, according to his needs and
[40:35] according to your blessing,
[40:37] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord Jesus.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Kyle.
[40:47] Amen.
[40:49] [Music]
[41:04] Hallelujah.
[41:09] God bless you, brother Simeon and Sister
[41:11] Leah. My night, we missed you last time.
[41:16] Last time we were over there and realize
[41:20] I can't always be everywhere at the same
[41:22] time. God bless you. Happy that you're
[41:24] here. Would you stand with me and we're
[41:28] going to turn to the word right away and
[41:29] thank you.
[41:33] Turn in your Bibles if you would to
[41:35] Deuteronomy the 4th chapter,
[41:39] chapter 4. And we're just going to read
[41:42] three verses there 33-36.
[41:49] And we'll read one verse of Deuteronomy
[41:52] 32 verse 10.
[42:08] Happy to see you all here.
[42:13] Hallelujah. It's important to be here in
[42:16] expectation.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] Out of heaven he made thee to hear his
[42:28] voice, that he might instruct thee. And
[42:32] upon earth he showed thee his great
[42:34] fire. And thou heardest his words out of
[42:38] the midst of the fire. That's verse 36.
[42:42] So we start with verse 33.
[42:46] Did ever people hear the voice of God
[42:49] speaking out of the midst of the fire,
[42:52] as thou hast heard and live? Or hath God
[42:56] said to go and take him a nation from
[43:00] the midst of another nation, by
[43:03] temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
[43:06] and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by
[43:10] a outstretched arm, and by great
[43:13] terrors, according to all that the Lord
[43:17] your God did for you in Egypt before
[43:19] your eyes. Unto thee it was showed that
[43:23] thou mightest know that the Lord he is
[43:25] God. There is none other. There is none
[43:28] else beside him.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Out of heaven he made thee to hear his
[43:32] voice that he might instruct thee. And
[43:35] upon earth he showed thee his great fire
[43:38] that that and thou heardest his voice
[43:42] out of the midst of the heaven. If
[43:45] you'll notice just for a moment, he
[43:47] didn't say that you heard the voice out
[43:49] of Moses. Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Because Moses was not the origin.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; You heard the voice out of heaven.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; We've heard a voice. The voice uh did
[44:01] not did not originate in William Brham.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Uh the voice of God originates in
[44:09] heaven.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; It's come from the throne of God.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; So we say, okay, now how do we know that
[44:15] that is God's voice? It comes first.
[44:20] it'll be vindicated or proven.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; And number two, the greatest vindication
[44:25] is the effect that that voice has upon
[44:28] the people. It doesn't merely make a
[44:30] good church or nice people. It makes
[44:34] people who become unmovable.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; As I said to the people down in
[44:39] Louisiana, just having returned from
[44:42] there, I said, "There are those that
[44:44] would that uh that can't go on and they
[44:47] let go. And there are those who want to
[44:50] let go but can't let go. And I'm glad I
[44:53] can say I'm in that number.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; I'm in that number.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Even when things get going so hard, say,
[44:59] I'd like to let go, but you can't let
[45:01] go.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus said to Peter, "Wilt
[45:07] thou go?" He couldn't go.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; He couldn't let go. Amen. We'll read
[45:12] verse 32, uh verse 10 in chapter 32.
[45:22] He found him in a desert land and in the
[45:26] waste howling wilderness. He led him
[45:29] about. He instructed him. He kept him as
[45:34] the apple of his eye. Amen. And you may
[45:38] have your seats. You may want to keep
[45:40] your Bible handy. And I would like to
[45:43] say to the congregation
[45:46] uh and especially to the young
[45:51] people, senior young people especially,
[45:54] if you have a question,
[45:57] jot it down. If something comes to your
[46:00] mind, jot it down and so that we can
[46:03] come back to it. some of the comments. I
[46:06] have been asked by uh brother Tatch
[46:12] to make some comments at the graduation
[46:15] evening, the formal evening. That's not
[46:17] the dinner, but that's the formal
[46:19] evening I believe on Friday uh Friday
[46:22] night. And so this will be a leadin
[46:28] to that. It will give a foundation also
[46:31] to the comments I would like to make
[46:33] there. This will be coming from a
[46:35] spiritual perspective.
[46:38] Uh the title I would like to speak on is
[46:43] instruction
[46:46] brings change.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Instruction brings about change.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Not all change is is of God. Come on.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Uh you don't have to do anything. If you
[47:00] just drift along and go with the
[47:04] movement or the crowd, you will
[47:07] experience change.
[47:09] I doubt if it'll be a godly change.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Uh but it'll be change
[47:15] &gt;&gt; and you won't end up being exactly the
[47:17] same as you were. And and and
[47:20] furthermore, the change might even be
[47:22] imperceptible. You don't realize that,
[47:25] you know, it's just adjusting here and
[47:27] adjusting there. Maybe adjusting to a
[47:30] neighbor, adjusting to a friend,
[47:31] adjusting to a peer, adjusting to your
[47:34] own age, your own time. And so for the
[47:38] young people and especially the
[47:40] graduates that will be graduating,
[47:43] you've come to a time of of of
[47:46] significant change and I will be
[47:48] speaking about that. But what I have
[47:52] today coming from the scriptures will
[47:55] give you a good groundwork. So I want
[47:57] you to absorb the spiritual side of it
[48:00] today.
[48:03] Uh and the scripture which we read had
[48:06] said out of heaven
[48:11] out of heaven he made thee to hear the
[48:13] voice. It's very very significant that
[48:19] when you come to church that you realize
[48:22] you're not listening just to a minister
[48:25] &gt;&gt; or the man of God that stands behind the
[48:27] pulpit who has waited on God, but you
[48:30] want to say the source of these words
[48:33] &gt;&gt; have come from the throne of God.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And there may be just a sentence or a
[48:39] line, but I will give myself to hear
[48:42] everything that is spoken. So I might
[48:45] absorb that which God is sending me.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And he made thee to hear. Not everyone
[48:53] can hear. He made thee to hear his
[48:56] voice. Number one,
[48:59] that he might instruct thee.
[49:03] That's why he allows us to hear his
[49:06] voice. That we might receive
[49:08] instruction. And this restruction isn't
[49:11] something that's just light and
[49:13] optional.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; This is instruction that God is
[49:16] requiring.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; And in the New Testament, he calls it
[49:20] chastisement.
[49:21] But chastisement doesn't always refer to
[49:24] a whipping. That's not what he's
[49:26] referring to. Words are to form and to
[49:30] change a person's way and mode of
[49:32] living. Yes, sir.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And God imposes that upon. He said, "So
[49:37] I made you to hear. my voice.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And the reason we heard it is so that
[49:42] you can change.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Change doesn't good change doesn't come
[49:47] easy.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Good changes often are very very
[49:52] difficult and it's hard to change old
[49:56] ways and old habits and things that we
[49:59] become so accustomed to. But there are
[50:02] some things that we need to change
[50:05] &gt;&gt; and we need to expect that change. And
[50:07] for those that especially that are uh
[50:10] coming to graduation now, you will you
[50:13] will have received a lot of instruction.
[50:16] And I'll probably repeat that phrase. Uh
[50:19] at the graduation, you have now come to
[50:22] a certain closure. Uh you have spent
[50:25] these years now in school and the
[50:29] prophet spoken leadership that you
[50:31] started out with your mother perhaps at
[50:35] your first step and you received some
[50:37] instruction. You you know your parents
[50:40] taught you what was hot and that you
[50:42] must not touch it or you get burned. And
[50:44] it's amazing how we learn things. I
[50:47] always am amazed when we go overseas and
[50:50] see children just very very young
[50:53] learning to speak and and they speak
[50:56] something I don't understand cuz they
[50:58] speak in another language and it's
[51:01] always been just such a marvel to me and
[51:04] uh uh brother Daniel Cen Bruner he has
[51:07] the cutest little daughter and and
[51:10] she'll she'll speak uh French for a bit
[51:13] and then she'll just cut off and speak
[51:14] in German and And when she when I speak
[51:17] in English, she smiles because she
[51:19] understands it, but she doesn't want to
[51:21] speak it. And and I just think she's so
[51:24] cute. I'd like to kind of steal her and
[51:27] take her away with us sometime. Uh, but
[51:30] I I I'm always so amused with that, the
[51:32] way she just, you know, speak that and
[51:34] then correct her father if he doesn't
[51:36] say it just exactly right cuz her father
[51:39] his mother language is German and her
[51:42] her mother's mother language is French
[51:44] in Switzerland. And uh and so sometimes
[51:47] if the father the brother Daniel was
[51:50] telling me if he doesn't just get exact
[51:52] pronunciation in the French you say no
[51:55] papa you know you need to say it like
[51:58] this and she has it so perfect but it
[52:00] always amazes me is how did they how how
[52:03] did they get it? Well by observation and
[52:06] by instruction and so on. So we've had a
[52:09] lot of instruction along these things.
[52:12] The scripture tells us in Proverbs,
[52:15] he is in the way of life that keepeth
[52:18] instruction.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; You want to remember that he is he is in
[52:25] the way of life that that keepeth
[52:28] instruction.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; But he that refusth repro reproof erth.
[52:36] That's very simple. You want to write
[52:38] that down. Proverbs 10:17.
[52:41] So now we have the opening pages of the
[52:44] scripture, the opening pages of the
[52:48] Bible,
[52:50] we have the fall in Eden.
[52:57] And in the closing pages of the
[53:00] scripture, we have another Eden
[53:03] where there is no effect of the fall.
[53:07] There will be no sin, no heartache, no
[53:10] tears, no death,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; none of that. Do you believe that?
[53:15] &gt;&gt; That means that we are somewhere sitting
[53:18] right here today at this moment. We are
[53:21] somewhere between this Eden and this
[53:24] other Eden.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And we are being instructed so we can
[53:31] get to this Eden.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And God is determined to bring his
[53:38] children to this
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Eden.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said, "You've heard
[53:43] the voice from heaven."
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Not from a man. You've heard it from
[53:47] heaven.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Not from a Bible school. From heaven.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; People want to know what school did you
[53:55] go to? Well, it it it would be better if
[53:57] you didn't have to say that it was to a
[54:00] certain certain uh theological school,
[54:03] but we learn the things in school. We
[54:06] learn things that are essential. We
[54:07] learn learn things that are necessary
[54:10] for this life.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; But the but the prize of this life is
[54:15] that life.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; The prize of being born in this world is
[54:20] to be born again.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] We are somewhere
[54:28] I feel not near only the the
[54:33] garden, the Eden in the end, but I feel
[54:37] we're very near the entrance.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I sincerely believe that.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; You know, just listen how far behind
[54:48] uh uh the the one that is has a
[54:51] forerunner. You have a forerunner and a
[54:53] forerunning message to achieve a certain
[54:56] goal that's never been never been
[54:58] vindicated, never been sent, never been
[55:00] spoken about this Bible like it has been
[55:03] spoken in this message by by this
[55:05] prophet of God. Never in history been
[55:08] spoken like that. And the proof of it is
[55:10] people always want to prove it. The
[55:12] proof of it is is that it actually
[55:14] produces what it says it will produce.
[55:17] And for people who will give themselves
[55:19] to it, it's not really that difficult.
[55:21] You yield yourself to it and it actually
[55:24] produces the life. It produces something
[55:27] the world doesn't produce it.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; There's no corporation out there to
[55:31] produce it. There's no school out there
[55:33] to produce it. There's no church to
[55:36] produce it. It is it is so disheartening
[55:40] and and it's more than disheartening if
[55:43] a person didn't know that you had a hold
[55:45] of something. If you look at what is
[55:47] what is represented as being uh you know
[55:51] Pentecost or that which is considered
[55:54] the the the
[55:56] uh peak you know it's the it's the apex
[56:00] of spirituality out there and some
[56:03] people that are sitting here in this
[56:04] service right now went to see some
[56:06] people that they had known years ago
[56:08] singers went there and could not
[56:11] tolerate what was going on and had to
[56:14] walk out Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; In a big Pentecostal church
[56:17] &gt;&gt; right here, not far from not far from
[56:20] this church. What is it?
[56:23] That's that's they are what they're
[56:26] feeding on. I guess
[56:28] &gt;&gt; they are what they're feeding on.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; But you people and we we must uh uh give
[56:35] reverence and respect and thanksgiving
[56:37] that you know this message didn't
[56:39] originate with us.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong to Cloverdale Bible Way.
[56:43] doesn't belong to any believer's church
[56:45] anywhere in the world. It it came from
[56:47] heaven.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And we have to continue to hold fast
[56:51] that this originated in heaven.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; This message didn't. Anybody who thought
[56:56] it came from Moses, they they had
[56:59] problems.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; They said to Moses, "Are you the only
[57:05] holy one?"
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And and they stumbled over that. and and
[57:09] Moses he even he even uh you know he he
[57:13] intervened and he prevailed upon God
[57:16] don't destroy them
[57:18] &gt;&gt; even when they had sinned against God.
[57:21] So uh we have to keep that in our minds.
[57:25] Now
[57:28] in the in the revelation
[57:30] the prophet said this book that we're
[57:32] studying in the is the actual revelation
[57:36] of Jesus Christ himself.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; In the church and his work in the future
[57:43] ages
[57:45] and I made I abbreviated and made some
[57:47] notes here which I'm going to have come
[57:50] up. It takes the Holy Spirit.
[57:54] Now, this is the prophet's words. It
[57:56] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[57:59] revelation
[58:02] or we will fail to get it.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to take the operation
[58:11] of the Holy Ghost.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; This book can't be revealed to anyone
[58:17] but a special class of people. Now, we
[58:20] didn't make the class of people, and
[58:23] that's not our invention.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That's not God's invention. Jesus said,
[58:28] and we'll read it later, other sheep I
[58:31] have that are not of this fold. Them
[58:33] also I must bring. But he had them.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Other sheep I have.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; They are his sheep.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was very clear. Said, "Why
[58:44] can't you hear me? Why can't you?"
[58:46] Because he said, "You're of your father,
[58:48] the devil." there were another another
[58:50] class.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And so we just accept what he says.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; So this book can't be revealed to anyone
[58:59] but a special class of people. And it
[59:02] will take one with prophetic insight.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; It will require the ability to hear from
[59:12] God.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] It will require supernatural
[59:17] instruction.
[59:19] Here's my message. It will require
[59:22] supernatural instruction.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Not just how to, you know, add two and
[59:28] two or not just how to tie your shoes or
[59:32] not just to learn the basic things of
[59:34] home and not just to learn, you know,
[59:36] how to how to cook or how to sew or how
[59:39] to do these things. But this will
[59:42] require supernatural instruction. Not
[59:45] just a student comparing verse with
[59:47] verse, though that is good.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; But a mystery requires the teaching of
[59:54] the spirit or it never becomes clear.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; People can see it and they can see and
[1:00:00] they can have assumptions about it and
[1:00:03] presume things and miss and hit and so
[1:00:05] on and so forth. But this friends, this
[1:00:08] can only come through a prophetic
[1:00:11] message. That's the only way it can
[1:00:13] come. And you ought to everyone say amen
[1:00:17] to that.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; How we need to hear from God and lay
[1:00:23] ourselves open.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; This is the key now. How we need to hear
[1:00:28] from God. Number one, and two, lay
[1:00:31] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:00:35] spirit to hear and know.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; I thought that was so good I needed to
[1:00:41] put it so you could read it. That'll be
[1:00:44] fine. You can take it off now.
[1:00:48] In speaking to Joshua, God said, "Be
[1:00:51] strong and of a good courage, for unto
[1:00:55] this people shalt thou divide for an
[1:00:58] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:01:01] their fathers to give them." Only be
[1:01:04] thou strong and very courageous, that
[1:01:07] thou mayest observe to do, observe to
[1:01:10] do, not merely now, observe to hear, but
[1:01:13] observe to do according to all the law
[1:01:18] which Moses my servant commanded thee.
[1:01:21] Now, here's God telling them how they're
[1:01:24] to hear it. And turn not from the right
[1:01:27] hand or the left, that thou mayest
[1:01:30] prosper whethersoever thou goest. And I
[1:01:33] think most of us here are interested in
[1:01:35] success. And he goes on to say, "This
[1:01:38] book of the law shall not depart out of
[1:01:41] thy mouth."
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, we don't have flashes of
[1:01:45] spiritual times.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; It's not a flash of a spiritual time.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; God is interested in just plain old,
[1:01:53] rugged, steady, steadfast.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; That's what he plans. That's what he
[1:01:59] teaches.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; I believe in going to church.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; I believe in going to church. Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; We were thinking of it and my wife and I
[1:02:12] were speaking about it and and even if
[1:02:14] we didn't have a message church that
[1:02:17] that had the word at the time in our
[1:02:20] earlier times and we were feeding on the
[1:02:23] message, but we went to church so I
[1:02:26] could maybe get a slice
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; or be an example as well
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; and make a mark
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; in the world. Yes,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:02:35] You want to feel very very uncomfortable
[1:02:38] if you're not in the house of God.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; If you're if it's possible for you to be
[1:02:42] there.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I realize that jobs and things take
[1:02:45] people and so on.
[1:02:48] In the token message, it's all right.
[1:02:50] I'll get preaching after a while.
[1:02:53] In the token message, the prophet said,
[1:02:55] "Full obedience to the word brings God."
[1:02:59] The word
[1:03:02] brings God, the word eternal in you.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; We're interested in that, aren't we?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Full obedience brings God the word into
[1:03:14] you.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; In you. And that is the token.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And when the word is in you, it's Christ
[1:03:24] in you.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] He said further in the token, the token
[1:03:29] is the sign that the purchase has been
[1:03:32] made and been accepted.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Full obedience to the whole word of God
[1:03:38] will in will entitle you to the token.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Full obedience.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Not the part of it as far as your
[1:03:46] denomination goes, but all of it. Full
[1:03:50] obedience to the word which is Christ
[1:03:53] brings you into Christ.
[1:03:57] Whenever God speaks, it's for a divine
[1:04:00] purpose.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; He has an objective.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He has an
[1:04:05] objective and a purpose, and he's going
[1:04:07] to achieve that."
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; We can rest on that. He's going to
[1:04:12] achieve it.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; God deals with his children one way and
[1:04:18] he deals with others another way.
[1:04:23] even those who are of denominational
[1:04:28] uh backgrounds or people who do not go
[1:04:30] to church.
[1:04:32] Brother Brandham says that so this has
[1:04:34] nothing to do with healing as such
[1:04:36] because he says a woman off the street,
[1:04:39] a street woman can come up and maybe
[1:04:41] have uh make contact with God and have
[1:04:44] faith, exercise faith and receive a a
[1:04:47] complete healing while a godly sister
[1:04:49] misses it.
[1:04:51] So it's it's it is the grace of God. And
[1:04:53] then God has certain laws in place. And
[1:04:56] for example, give and it shall be given
[1:04:58] to you. It didn't say give and fast 40
[1:05:01] days or give and go and pray for 2 or 3
[1:05:03] hours. Give. No, it says give and it
[1:05:06] shall be given to you.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; that's that's one of that's a law.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what brother Brandham had to
[1:05:14] deal with when he was with the Full
[1:05:16] Gospel Christian businessmen because
[1:05:18] they felt that that all the prosperity
[1:05:22] that came to them was due to their
[1:05:24] spirituality,
[1:05:26] that they were more spiritual because
[1:05:28] God gave them more. And he had to let
[1:05:30] them know that had nothing to do with
[1:05:32] that.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; They just were exercising the law of
[1:05:35] giving
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; and they gave. And you say, "Well, I I
[1:05:39] can't afford to give." No, no. It's it's
[1:05:41] absolutely opposite. It's the other way
[1:05:43] around. You can af you cannot afford not
[1:05:46] to give
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; because by giving it releases the law of
[1:05:51] God in your life.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know how it is, but
[1:05:56] people have you know they've tried to
[1:05:57] save and tried to uh you know pro
[1:06:00] protect themselves and whatever more and
[1:06:02] and the Bible even speaks of it goes in
[1:06:04] a goes in a bag with holes in it
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; and then it goes and you don't even know
[1:06:08] where it goes.
[1:06:11] And you young people that are launching
[1:06:13] out into from graduation into life and
[1:06:16] so on and so forth. Yeah. The economy
[1:06:19] will be tight and and you'll have
[1:06:21] difficult time maybe uh paying for your
[1:06:24] way and so on. One of the first things
[1:06:26] you want to do, one of the first things
[1:06:28] you want to do is pay your tithe.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; If you're if you haven't started that
[1:06:34] habit, you want to start that habit now.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. one of our deacons here
[1:06:39] and I I see I don't see brother Joe
[1:06:41] Walner just here so I'll just speak to
[1:06:43] him. He came as an electrician from the
[1:06:46] colony in Manitoba and he was a prize
[1:06:50] electrician.
[1:06:52] He was looking after two or three
[1:06:54] colonies but he had no ticket. No
[1:06:57] ticket. no acknowledgment that he was an
[1:07:00] electrician when he come come here just
[1:07:03] pulled up ropes pulled up all the cords
[1:07:05] and came arrived here and uh
[1:07:10] didn't have a job
[1:07:12] and walked right into the little log
[1:07:14] church he and his wife and sister Kathy
[1:07:16] we just talked about because we were
[1:07:17] with Kathy here a few days ago and she
[1:07:20] was just she was 16 and I walked in and
[1:07:24] brother Joe started applying for work
[1:07:27] Well, he they want to know where's his
[1:07:29] ticket. You know, he didn't have a
[1:07:31] ticket. So, I really felt I felt very
[1:07:33] very bad because I would say over this
[1:07:36] pulpit that uh you know, businessmen
[1:07:39] abuse others that don't have the ticket
[1:07:42] and they hired him for just $6 an hour
[1:07:45] or something. It was shameful.
[1:07:48] But one thing that man did is as soon as
[1:07:52] he got his pay, he made out one check
[1:07:55] for tithing and one check for
[1:08:00] uh offering.
[1:08:02] But that's what he did. And and I don't
[1:08:05] know how they made it. It was difficult
[1:08:07] and perhaps and I know that two of them
[1:08:10] and brother Eli yourself and brother Joe
[1:08:13] and Eileen had to have a home together
[1:08:15] etc. and uh manage that way. And people
[1:08:18] go through hardships. Uh that's standard
[1:08:22] life. And uh and I and I know you know I
[1:08:27] know what I'm talking about. I haven't
[1:08:29] said much to this congregation. I spent
[1:08:31] 30 years of my life in hardship.
[1:08:34] 30 years. And that was not easy. And I
[1:08:36] was raising family at the time and
[1:08:38] everything else. My wife went with me
[1:08:40] wherever we went, whether we were in a
[1:08:41] little trailer or wherever we went. Uh,
[1:08:45] wherever we were ministering or wherever
[1:08:47] we were staying, she just was willing to
[1:08:49] go. Never never never once said anything
[1:08:51] to never ever heard her complain about
[1:08:53] it. Just went along. And uh I remember I
[1:08:58] remember this day, you know, because
[1:09:00] sometimes, you know, we are maybe more
[1:09:03] in tune and so on. Here we had brother
[1:09:06] Joe and and brother Henry were both
[1:09:09] looking for work
[1:09:11] and they made a big announcement in the
[1:09:13] newspaper
[1:09:14] and the announcement was that the
[1:09:17] federal government
[1:09:19] froze all hiring. There will be no more
[1:09:25] hiring by the federal government. And
[1:09:28] now here's these uh you know solid
[1:09:31] people and faithful in the church. That
[1:09:34] very day that very day that that
[1:09:38] announcement was made both of them got
[1:09:40] federal
[1:09:42] were hired at positions and brother
[1:09:47] brother Joe David don't tell him I'm
[1:09:49] saying this.
[1:09:52] Brother Joe got he finally got such a
[1:09:54] soft touch job.
[1:09:57] He did say to me, "I'm embarrassed when
[1:09:59] I pick up my check."
[1:10:03] I said, "Why?" "Well, there's nothing,
[1:10:04] you know, there's really nothing to do."
[1:10:07] And so it went on for it went on. This
[1:10:10] is good for you. You know, this what
[1:10:12] this didn't happen the week he arrived.
[1:10:14] This happened a few years down the road.
[1:10:16] But he but I'm just telling you what he
[1:10:18] set his course. He just set his course.
[1:10:21] This is it. This is God's word. I was
[1:10:24] thinking of the message and brother Tom
[1:10:25] was preaching the other night. He says
[1:10:28] uh that we live by every word of God.
[1:10:31] And one of those words is tithing. I I
[1:10:34] don't preach much about tithing, but I
[1:10:36] just thought this was very fitting. One
[1:10:37] of those words is tithing.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And you know, a lot of people actually
[1:10:41] rob themselves because they don't give
[1:10:44] to God. And that's God's money and
[1:10:46] they're down there spending it at the
[1:10:48] mall. or don't give God's money to
[1:10:50] Walmart,
[1:10:53] whatever you do. That's the biggest
[1:10:55] mistake in the world. And so I I asked
[1:10:58] and Brother Joe said, "I'm actually
[1:11:00] embarrassed. I'm embarrassed when I pick
[1:11:02] up my check." And I said, "Well, don't
[1:11:04] be embarrassed. God give it to you. God
[1:11:06] give you this job." And uh yeah. So one
[1:11:10] day about several months later I said
[1:11:14] cuz you know those of you that talk to
[1:11:16] brother Joe Wner
[1:11:19] is you know everything's fixed.
[1:11:23] His face is fixed. His eyes look at you
[1:11:26] and look through you and everything's
[1:11:28] fixed. And when words come out of his
[1:11:30] mouth that's it. It's just
[1:11:33] so I said, "Brother Joe," I said,
[1:11:37] "Please be honest with me." Now,
[1:11:42] if you were working for a commercial
[1:11:44] electrician
[1:11:46] and had to produce the amount of work
[1:11:49] you usually do,
[1:11:52] how much time would it have taken for
[1:11:55] you to do the work you did today?
[1:12:01] He said, "10 minutes."
[1:12:05] I said, "Now I know why you're
[1:12:06] embarrassed when you pick up your
[1:12:07] check."
[1:12:12] But he was a self-trained man and
[1:12:14] received instruction and uh but it
[1:12:16] wasn't accepted by, you know, by others
[1:12:18] by the world. But to instruct here's now
[1:12:22] I want to give you a couple different
[1:12:23] sides of instruction. So those of you
[1:12:26] that will be in the graduation and uh
[1:12:29] you'll remember this please to receive
[1:12:31] instruction
[1:12:33] as I said it is the with the word even
[1:12:36] in the New Testament is to chasen.
[1:12:39] It says uh uh in the scripture blessed
[1:12:43] is the man whom the Lord whom thou
[1:12:46] chastenest.
[1:12:48] We thought, "Oh my goodness." No, but we
[1:12:50] have to understand what is blessed is
[1:12:52] the blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:12:55] instructs.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man who the Lord
[1:12:58] corrects.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man who the Lord loves
[1:13:02] and directs his footsteps
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; in the right way. Can we not agree to
[1:13:07] that?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, and teachest him out of thy
[1:13:11] law.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Teach us. So uh uh in the Hebrew to be
[1:13:17] chasened is to be disciplined
[1:13:20] or to be admonished or to let oneself be
[1:13:25] chasened.
[1:13:26] It's not just to you know I heard of a a
[1:13:30] boy and he he uh 16 17 years old and he
[1:13:35] just thought I'm done with home and I'm
[1:13:37] done with all of this instruction my
[1:13:39] father imposing all this. I'm out of
[1:13:41] here. I'm history. So he went and he
[1:13:44] found out what the real world was like
[1:13:46] and he spent a couple years away from
[1:13:48] home and he asked if he could come home.
[1:13:52] And so parents said, "Yeah, it'll be
[1:13:54] fine." And he said, "Well, I'm looking
[1:13:56] here seeing all these young men here."
[1:13:59] And so they said, "Yeah, it'll be fine."
[1:14:01] And he was home. He was home for a
[1:14:03] little while. And he said he was just
[1:14:05] amazed how much his father had learned
[1:14:07] in two years.
[1:14:16] Sounds true to life, doesn't it? So,
[1:14:19] blessed is the man whom thou chastest,
[1:14:21] oh Lord, and teachest him out of thy
[1:14:24] law.
[1:14:25] In Deuteronomy, which we had read, it
[1:14:27] said this now because now I want to add
[1:14:30] this to my the comments and move on from
[1:14:32] here. He found him in a desert land and
[1:14:35] in a waste howling wilderness. He led
[1:14:38] him about. He instructed him. He kept
[1:14:42] him as the apple of his eye. It It's
[1:14:45] This instruction isn't for and and we've
[1:14:48] all heard it. This is for your benefit.
[1:14:52] This hurts me more than it hurts you.
[1:14:57] Nobody's heard that.
[1:15:01] He instructed him and this is a
[1:15:02] different he's teaching to be discreet
[1:15:06] to be have to have understanding
[1:15:09] to have discernment to be able to
[1:15:11] perceive what is right and what is wrong
[1:15:14] to perceive what is true and uh to
[1:15:19] discern to understand. So in Hebrews it
[1:15:22] says, "If you endure chastening, God
[1:15:26] deal with you as with sons. For what son
[1:15:29] is he whom the father chastineth not?"
[1:15:33] What son? And you know that's the apple
[1:15:35] of his eye. That's the father's the
[1:15:38] father's love and it's his own image and
[1:15:42] his own flesh and blood. So he instructs
[1:15:44] him uh in the way and that chastening is
[1:15:49] not only instruction but it's to nurture
[1:15:53] it is the whole training and the
[1:15:55] education of children which relates to
[1:15:58] the cultivation of mind and morals what
[1:16:02] is right so you can discern what is
[1:16:04] right you can discern that this is going
[1:16:05] to take me the wrong way or it's going
[1:16:08] to be the and it uses it uses for this
[1:16:12] purpose command commandments.
[1:16:15] You cannot go there. I don't want you to
[1:16:18] go there. Or maybe when they get older,
[1:16:21] it it wouldn't be pleasing to me.
[1:16:25] Mother and father would be disappointed
[1:16:27] if you went there. But you think about
[1:16:30] it, you've got to finally make your own
[1:16:32] decision. But all of this teaching in
[1:16:35] the home and so on and teaching in the
[1:16:38] church and teaching at a Christian
[1:16:40] school is to to gain admonition and to
[1:16:44] gain discernment
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; so you can you won't always be there.
[1:16:47] You won't always have that protection.
[1:16:49] You won't always have that onhand
[1:16:52] guidance.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; See, I can't preach like this at the at
[1:16:57] the grad, so I'm taking some liberties
[1:16:59] just now. And so it uses for this
[1:17:02] purpose, for this uh to nurture and to
[1:17:05] instruct, uses for this purpose even
[1:17:08] commands and admonition, reproof, and
[1:17:11] when necessary, punishment.
[1:17:14] And don't get quiet. Now, God punishes.
[1:17:19] And if you're a son and daughter of God,
[1:17:23] I'm sure there's at some point in time
[1:17:25] where you felt smitten
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; because you felt that you've grieved the
[1:17:31] Holy Spirit and maybe didn't recognize
[1:17:34] it until there was some punishment being
[1:17:36] applied and you went through a hard
[1:17:38] time.
[1:17:40] I'll just leave it like that.
[1:17:42] Paul said in Hebrews further, "For whom
[1:17:44] the Lord loveth, he chastneth, and
[1:17:48] scourgeeth every son whom he receiveth."
[1:17:53] That's not God doesn't need that. We're
[1:17:56] the ones that need that.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And what do we start off with? You have
[1:18:03] caused me to hear your voice
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; so that I may instruct you.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; What do you think this message came for?
[1:18:11] This message isn't always I've had
[1:18:13] people say to me, "It took the hide off
[1:18:15] my back."
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Drake used to say that
[1:18:19] all the time. Sister Elner, it took the
[1:18:21] hide off my back, but I love it.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; That's the response.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I see a few smiles. I'll see a
[1:18:29] few more in a little bit.
[1:18:33] The the chastening. I'll just uh give
[1:18:35] you another another because there are
[1:18:37] several words used in the Bible. To
[1:18:40] learn to chasten is to learn. So that's
[1:18:43] so chastening sounds hard but learning
[1:18:45] doesn't sound near. It's to learn or to
[1:18:48] teach, to instruct, to train children to
[1:18:51] be instructed or taught or learn to
[1:18:55] cause one to learn
[1:18:58] or to chastise by words with words
[1:19:01] molding.
[1:19:04] I used to, you don't mind some personal
[1:19:07] things here. I used to chastise mostly
[1:19:09] by words.
[1:19:12] And my daughters said as they got older,
[1:19:15] they said, "Another thing that you do,
[1:19:17] Dad, you'd poke us.
[1:19:20] You'd poke you on a chest. Make sure you
[1:19:22] know I'm talking to you."
[1:19:25] And they did confess. They they said
[1:19:29] that that was so, you know, you just
[1:19:32] were making your point so real. They
[1:19:34] just wish, "Why don't you just spank me
[1:19:37] and get get it over with?" because the
[1:19:41] spanking would have been easier than the
[1:19:43] verbal, you know, not verbal abuse, but
[1:19:46] just verbal instruction because it comes
[1:19:48] down and the spanking would have been
[1:19:50] easier. Well, sometimes I think God just
[1:19:53] gets his finger and I hear see that
[1:19:55] prophet raise his finger and come across
[1:19:57] that pulpit and what what's he doing?
[1:20:00] He's adi there's admonition. It's
[1:20:03] teaching. It's instruction. He's
[1:20:06] imposing something upon us for our
[1:20:08] benefit,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; for our correction, for our direction,
[1:20:12] and for our protection in the future.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] In Psalms, he said, I will instruct thee
[1:20:22] and teach thee in the way that thou
[1:20:24] shalt go, and I will guide thee with
[1:20:27] mine eye.
[1:20:31] I will instruct you is to be wise and to
[1:20:34] understand and to have insight
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; to be given some perception, have
[1:20:39] insight and to give attention to and to
[1:20:42] consider, to comprehend. All of these
[1:20:46] things are part of instruction. He said,
[1:20:49] I will instruct you. But the last would
[1:20:52] which I think we all will like to
[1:20:54] prosper and have success.
[1:20:58] We have to take it to heart
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; to prosper and have success. So in
[1:21:03] instruction that is received or heeded
[1:21:06] brings about change.
[1:21:09] And now I want to take the service off
[1:21:13] to the in another direction.
[1:21:21] Opportunity
[1:21:23] and obedience brings about change. not
[1:21:27] opportunity by itself. There's a lot of
[1:21:29] opportunity which is just a subtle it's
[1:21:32] really a subtle enchantment
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; actually away from a godly change.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And so we have to have discernment not
[1:21:42] all in fact as I can tell you that there
[1:21:44] are many many opportunities that would
[1:21:48] make life easier here but it is not
[1:21:51] taking a person or a family in a godly
[1:21:54] direction. But if we settle it in our
[1:21:57] mind, the godly direction is the
[1:21:59] direction wherever I go in life or to
[1:22:03] further education or to a promotion
[1:22:06] within my business or job or whatever
[1:22:08] more. The godly the godly direction is
[1:22:12] my direction.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Now I want to I want to speak about Ruth
[1:22:21] for about the next 30 minutes or so.
[1:22:28] Ruth. And you need to perhaps read the
[1:22:31] book of Ruth. It's only four chapters
[1:22:33] after this service. And for those of you
[1:22:35] that want swimming water, there's plenty
[1:22:38] in there. And I will throw a little out
[1:22:41] while we're at it.
[1:22:43] Ruth,
[1:22:45] her secret to her success.
[1:22:49] And remember I said in an earlier
[1:22:51] service, she had hardships.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; She endured incredible sorrow.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; She lost her husband as a young woman
[1:23:04] and lost her father-in-law
[1:23:07] and lost her only brother-in-law.
[1:23:10] And there were three widows left in her
[1:23:14] homeland, but it was foreign to them.
[1:23:17] And they got reduced to poverty,
[1:23:20] absolute utter poverty, and were just in
[1:23:24] bitterness.
[1:23:26] And Naomi, when she returned home, said,
[1:23:28] "Don't call me Naomi anymore. Call me
[1:23:31] Mara, for my life has been bitter."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And Ruth had been a part of that. So now
[1:23:40] I I probably would be correct in saying
[1:23:43] that her life was probably more bitter
[1:23:47] than what anyone here has had to
[1:23:49] experience even though we've experienced
[1:23:51] our grave hardships. And that is why
[1:23:54] those of you from Congo and from other
[1:23:57] places in Africa especially, you have
[1:24:00] experienced hardships and difficulties
[1:24:04] that we have perhaps never experienced.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; But it is not for not
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; it is not it is not God even knew that
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; God knew where you'd be born.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; God knew all the hardships you'd go
[1:24:20] through. God knew all the loss that
[1:24:23] you'd go through and the uncertainty
[1:24:26] that you've experienced and and you come
[1:24:29] into another country and and the culture
[1:24:32] is different and the language is
[1:24:34] different and everything is different
[1:24:37] and it's not been an easy road.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; God has seen that. But I want you to
[1:24:42] know that your lives can be and are a
[1:24:45] tremendous blessing.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so don't try to just adopt the
[1:24:50] direction that we go. We may not be
[1:24:52] going exactly the right way. God hasn't
[1:24:55] promised that we just go, you know,
[1:24:57] floating down the uh stream of time with
[1:25:00] ease and so on.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Let let your culture speak to us.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Let your ways that God has blessed speak
[1:25:08] to us.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the prophet spoke
[1:25:11] very very highly of the high morals
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; within the country. And perhaps it's not
[1:25:16] the same now, but I have also observed
[1:25:19] the uh your prayer life and the way that
[1:25:23] you have lived and the respect
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; and the and the respect you have for the
[1:25:28] ministry.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; It is just incredible and and you should
[1:25:32] teach us teach us those lessons.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; They're very valuable and they're
[1:25:36] scriptural lessons.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; So I want you to know you're very much a
[1:25:40] part and uh and a respected part and I
[1:25:45] respect you very very highly, very
[1:25:47] highly.
[1:25:50] But Ruth,
[1:25:52] she had set her course
[1:25:55] before all of these good things began to
[1:25:58] come her way. And she didn't know they
[1:26:00] were good things,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; but she had set her course.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And that's what people and some here
[1:26:07] need to do. And especially those that
[1:26:09] are being cut loose, say, from school
[1:26:12] and perhaps from home. and you're going
[1:26:14] to be venturing on your own, you need to
[1:26:17] set your course.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm going in a godly
[1:26:21] direction."
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know where I'm going, but I'm
[1:26:25] going in a godly direction.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. people even within this
[1:26:28] congregation, we need to set our course
[1:26:31] and say whatever comes,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; hardship or loss or whatever comes, I
[1:26:38] set my life in a godly direction and
[1:26:41] nothing nothing but God himself shall
[1:26:44] move me from this direction.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Where you go, Ruth, is where I go. She
[1:26:51] couldn't even explain why that was
[1:26:54] there. Your God shall be my God.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Your land shall be my land. Where you
[1:27:01] live, and here she's talking to a widow
[1:27:03] who has nothing. Where you live, that's
[1:27:06] where I'm going to live.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And where you die, that's where I'm
[1:27:09] going to die. And your people are going
[1:27:11] to be my people.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And your God will be my God. Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; What kind of God is that that allows the
[1:27:19] all the men of the family to die and to
[1:27:22] have nobody to support you and to be
[1:27:24] reduced to a bitter life? I tell you
[1:27:27] what, that woman had, she spoke faith,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; your God will be my God.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Even though he's allowed us to come into
[1:27:36] to to be reduced to absolutely nothing,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; there's nothing in this world that shall
[1:27:43] move me
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; from this. Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And that is why God could make her the
[1:27:47] mother of kings.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; That's the key, friends, to her success.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; And she said it in a phrase and she said
[1:27:57] this phrase
[1:27:59] speaking to her mother-in-law to Naomi
[1:28:02] because Naomi was giving her
[1:28:05] instruction,
[1:28:06] some very basic instruction about
[1:28:09] gleaning and about her how she shall act
[1:28:12] around Boaz.
[1:28:14] And she and this is what Ruth said. And
[1:28:17] she said unto her, and now I want you to
[1:28:20] memorize memorize this. All that thou
[1:28:24] sayest unto me, I will do.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I spoke to thee
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; with a voice out of heaven.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; This isn't even Naomi. This is God
[1:28:44] Almighty. I've spoken to you. I have
[1:28:47] vindicated the voice so that you might
[1:28:49] know. It's not a man. So I did it in
[1:28:52] such a way so you would know that this
[1:28:54] is a voice from heaven.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And if she could say this to Naomi,
[1:28:59] surely we can say to our heavenly
[1:29:01] father, "All that thou sayest, I will
[1:29:05] do."
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's unqualified. It's not if things go
[1:29:12] good. Not if things get better. Not if I
[1:29:16] have something, you know, nicer,
[1:29:18] whatever more. It's not connected to
[1:29:21] that.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; It's what you say I will do.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll leave the consequences with
[1:29:29] you. I don't even pay attention. People,
[1:29:33] listen, I'm going to be flat. I I don't
[1:29:36] I don't even read Facebook. I heard more
[1:29:39] about things that are I heard more
[1:29:41] things down there that I I didn't know
[1:29:44] anything on about going on in the
[1:29:46] message. Well, I said, "Where'd you get
[1:29:47] it?" Well, the Facebook. I don't read
[1:29:49] Facebook.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; I do not read Facebook.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I have invitations all the time to get
[1:29:56] onto this LinkedIn or whatever it is.
[1:29:59] This one wants you as a friend. That one
[1:30:00] wants you as a friend. So on so forth.
[1:30:02] You already have me as a friend.
[1:30:05] I don't need somebody to be there. Just
[1:30:08] send me a note.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Send me an email or something.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let me get on to that.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I don't need my information to come from
[1:30:21] that channel.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's clear.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's undiluted.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's not going to
[1:30:30] deceive me or disappoint me.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; It'll be good for me. Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Good for all of us.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; But Ruth had experienced these things.
[1:30:41] She said, "All that thou sayest unto me,
[1:30:43] I will do." Now, the Bible tells us, and
[1:30:46] you don't have to turn to it, please,
[1:30:48] but just listen closely because I won't
[1:30:50] have time to go where I want to go. I
[1:30:52] was actually disappointed this morning
[1:30:54] knowing that I wouldn't get where I want
[1:30:56] to probably get.
[1:31:01] And Boaz is speaking to Ruth. Now this
[1:31:03] different kind of instruction. The key
[1:31:05] to her success is that in her utter
[1:31:08] despair
[1:31:10] and poverty and famine. She said,
[1:31:13] "Whatever you say, that's what I'm going
[1:31:16] to do." And now we have a prophet saying
[1:31:18] that was the old Orthodox church. And
[1:31:20] here's a Moabitis
[1:31:22] that has no promise.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; No inheritance.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I hope you could. Now, you senior people
[1:31:29] get this.
[1:31:31] This woman has no inheritance in Israel.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Zero.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; She has no right to anything.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; But she has chosen this land and this
[1:31:45] people
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; and she knew that this is an Israelite.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow this one
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; and their God will be my God.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; That's the choice I'm making. And
[1:31:56] wherever you go, that's where I'm going
[1:31:58] to go. Wherever this message leads me,
[1:32:01] that's where I'm going to go. I want to
[1:32:03] be under the blessing. I want to be
[1:32:05] under the halo light. I want to be under
[1:32:08] the glory of God. Whatever that is,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; however he chooses
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; to glorify himself, that's where I'm
[1:32:16] going to be. And that is why the first
[1:32:18] words of the first words of Boaz was
[1:32:21] don't go in another field.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Don't go in another field.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Don't even look at another field. He
[1:32:28] said,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; "We're not looking for another message.
[1:32:32] We're not looking for some great
[1:32:34] spontaneous thing. Don't even look at
[1:32:36] another field." You say, "Well, that's
[1:32:39] mind control." Absolutely.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And who's controlling it? That's who I
[1:32:44] want to control it.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want some book or some magazine
[1:32:47] or something on the internet or
[1:32:50] something you Googled.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing how how it affects you.
[1:32:57] Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I know I'm speaking truth and I know I'm
[1:33:04] speaking right down to you. And I want
[1:33:06] you to say that. I want you to know in
[1:33:08] your heart this is not coming from
[1:33:09] brother Ed Bisll.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And if this doesn't coordinate with the
[1:33:15] message and with the word of God, then
[1:33:17] don't hear it. But if it is the word of
[1:33:19] God, then hear it.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; It's a voice
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; that I might instruct you. And he's
[1:33:25] giving you hearing so that you can
[1:33:27] actually absorb it
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; and receive it.
[1:33:32] And he said, "Now it is true that I am
[1:33:34] thy near kinsman.
[1:33:37] How be it, there is a kinsman nearer
[1:33:41] than I."
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it was the devil.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And the reason why it was the devil, now
[1:33:50] I need your 100% attention. The reason
[1:33:53] why it was the devil is because your
[1:33:56] first parents,
[1:34:00] your first parents, Eve, the first
[1:34:03] mother, she talked to the serpent before
[1:34:06] she even talked to God.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; She talked to the serpent even before
[1:34:11] she talked to her husband about this
[1:34:13] tree of knowledge.
[1:34:16] And so our first parents
[1:34:19] brought us this life.
[1:34:24] And your prophet said, "You had a sexual
[1:34:26] birth."
[1:34:29] And that birth was by a woman, by a
[1:34:32] mother. It's a blessed thing in God's
[1:34:36] sight. A mother.
[1:34:39] But by that birth, we all will die.
[1:34:44] Right?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; There'll be no one here that will
[1:34:47] survive that birth
[1:34:51] unless you are born again.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And to be born again is not to just come
[1:34:56] to a certain church. It's not just to
[1:34:58] adopt a certain kind of lifestyle. To be
[1:35:01] born again is that the spirit of God
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; comes and takes the seed of God.
[1:35:08] Something you hear. That's why it was so
[1:35:10] important. It said, "I caused you to
[1:35:12] hear." Yes,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; you need to hear what is being spoken.
[1:35:19] And almighty God, his spirit is here in
[1:35:22] this building and and on the internet to
[1:35:25] cause the people to hear.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I've given you ability to hear.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; This isn't you're not just coming to
[1:35:32] church now. You've come here to hear.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And by that hearing will come some
[1:35:40] change. And so he said to her, he said,
[1:35:43] "I'm thy kinsman, but there's a nearer
[1:35:45] kinsman." And because because Adam and
[1:35:49] Eve were raised and created in the image
[1:35:53] of God,
[1:35:55] and before, now follow me close. And God
[1:35:59] had commissioned them, multiply and
[1:36:03] replenish the earth. Multiply what?
[1:36:06] Produce more of yourself.
[1:36:09] Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; You are in the image of God. Produce
[1:36:12] more like you.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; They were not they were not created to
[1:36:16] die.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And God only gave them one one
[1:36:21] commandment. And he said,
[1:36:24] "In the day thou eatest thereof, you
[1:36:26] shall die or you'll be separated from
[1:36:30] me." Or, as the prophet stated very
[1:36:34] clearly, you need to hold this please in
[1:36:36] your heart. You will lose your
[1:36:38] inheritance. You'll lose your life and
[1:36:43] he said in the breach,
[1:36:45] Adam lost his life and his inheritance
[1:36:49] in life.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Now that's very important. Two things.
[1:36:53] You lose your life and your inheritance
[1:36:55] in life.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And so Boaz says there's this nearer
[1:37:03] kinsman.
[1:37:05] And when and when Eve listened and the
[1:37:09] fall came and I won't go into the
[1:37:10] details. The fall came
[1:37:13] and all of us are here now as birthed in
[1:37:18] human life with a human spirit and a
[1:37:22] dying body.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; All of us are in that state. And the
[1:37:27] prophet says in the invisible union of
[1:37:28] the bride that that was our first union.
[1:37:31] Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; You are united by natural birth.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And I will call it because of a union.
[1:37:42] I'll just say a husband.
[1:37:44] Your first husband
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; which came through the fall.
[1:37:51] We were united and Satan took control.
[1:37:54] And this is Satan's Eden.
[1:37:58] This is Satan is the ruler of the
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; of the power of the air.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Is that Are you right with me?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And we're in this world and we can't get
[1:38:07] out and we all have a human nature. We
[1:38:10] all have human attributes and certain
[1:38:13] struggles and all kind always waring and
[1:38:16] we can say with other men and even uh
[1:38:19] the prophet himself the greatest the
[1:38:21] person that has the greatest problem
[1:38:23] with is himself
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; and I think we all can say that
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; that's our number one we don't have to
[1:38:29] point any direction it's number one
[1:38:31] right here
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; and we can never never ever
[1:38:40] We can never better ourselves just with
[1:38:45] by our own what is the word re
[1:38:49] uh
[1:38:52] we can't we can't just improve ourselves
[1:38:56] through some improvement program or or
[1:39:01] some human effort. Listen, there's a
[1:39:06] I'm perhaps saying a lot here, but
[1:39:10] I was just looking uh for a certain
[1:39:12] thing over, you know, the change for
[1:39:15] better and all the rest of it. And I
[1:39:17] read a little clip. It's just recent
[1:39:19] news of last week, this this last week.
[1:39:24] And a man, he's 48 years old, and the
[1:39:28] woman he was living with, they were not
[1:39:30] officially married, but she was 46. And
[1:39:33] they had an hour-long radio show, and
[1:39:37] they were co-hosts of this well-known
[1:39:40] radio show called The Pursuit of
[1:39:43] Happiness.
[1:39:45] and he was well educated and so on and
[1:39:49] she was a psycho uh psychotherapist
[1:39:54] and so and they talking about how to
[1:39:57] have inner strength and how to find
[1:39:59] yourself and how to find all inner
[1:40:01] strength and all that. I know that that
[1:40:03] whole thing is just a bunch of taboo
[1:40:05] because here I am a little preacher
[1:40:07] preaching here but the deeper you look
[1:40:09] in yourself the darker it just becomes
[1:40:11] unless you're born again. Right?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Unless you're truly born again.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; But if you go to the human side and say,
[1:40:17] "Well, I'll try to find my inner
[1:40:19] strength." Happy, happy darkness.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; That's all you're going to find. A just
[1:40:26] a total darkness in there. And human
[1:40:28] ability isn't going to do it.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; And that is Satan's that Satan's tactic
[1:40:34] is so cunning. Those people. Anyway,
[1:40:36] this too. I'll just end it right here.
[1:40:38] It was it just shocked the entire
[1:40:40] nation. It was on CNN and I just I saw
[1:40:43] it on my computer in a news item. I did
[1:40:46] didn't read or didn't see anything. I
[1:40:49] just read the article and they both they
[1:40:51] both put a a bag over their heads,
[1:40:54] plastic bag over their head and fed
[1:40:56] helium in there and died uh committed
[1:40:59] suicide holding hands.
[1:41:02] And here they are telling the whole
[1:41:04] nation and the world how to be happy.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; How bizarre. Do you know what that is?
[1:41:12] That's the epitome of what Satan
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; wants to do.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He wants to lead people to death one way
[1:41:19] or another.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And to them that they thought that was
[1:41:23] the best way out, I suppose. And other
[1:41:25] people, he's got all kinds of other
[1:41:27] things. If you want to, you know, have
[1:41:29] success, he'll give success to you. if
[1:41:31] you want to have nice things or have
[1:41:34] beauty or have this or have that and and
[1:41:36] he'll just keep feeding that human thing
[1:41:39] until a person comes to the realization,
[1:41:42] I'm a scoundrel.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I'm lost.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; I need to be born again.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And so this nearer kinsman, don't let me
[1:41:56] help help me here just so I can stay
[1:41:59] with this. this nearer kinsman. He said
[1:42:02] he's he he's a nearer kinsman than I.
[1:42:06] And then
[1:42:08] he said unto the kinsman, then Boaz went
[1:42:12] to this kinsman, and he said to this
[1:42:13] kinsman, Naomi that is come again out of
[1:42:18] the country of Moab
[1:42:20] sellth a parcel of land. I wanted to
[1:42:23] have this on the up on the screen, but
[1:42:26] you'll have to listen. Exercise your
[1:42:27] mind. She sellth a parcel of land,
[1:42:31] which was her br which was our brother
[1:42:34] IMC her husband.
[1:42:38] And I thought to advertise thee,
[1:42:42] saying, "Buy it for the inhabitants and
[1:42:45] before the elders of the people of my
[1:42:47] people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem
[1:42:52] it the parcel of land.
[1:42:55] But if thou wil not redeem it, then tell
[1:42:58] me that I may know, for there is none to
[1:43:02] redeem it. Now the one is Boaz is the
[1:43:07] perfect type of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; So he's saying to this relative
[1:43:16] and the one that we were connected to
[1:43:19] was none other than the enemy, Satan
[1:43:22] himself. and you would have never heard
[1:43:24] it, but a prophet said that was the
[1:43:26] devil.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And so now there's a negotiation going
[1:43:30] on.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; If you'll redeem it, you redeem it. He
[1:43:34] said, I'll redeem it. The parcel of
[1:43:37] land,
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; redeem it for yourself.
[1:43:42] And and for there is none to redeem it
[1:43:45] beside thee, and I am after thee. And he
[1:43:48] said, I will redeem it. Then said Boaz,
[1:43:54] what day that thou buyest the field
[1:43:58] of the hand of Naomi,
[1:44:01] thou must buy it also of Ruth the
[1:44:05] Moabitis.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Because now this girl through marriage
[1:44:10] had a certain right. She didn't have the
[1:44:13] same right that Naomi had, but she was
[1:44:15] included in the in in in the right of
[1:44:20] ownership. And you must also buy it of
[1:44:23] Ruth the Moabitth, the wife, the wife of
[1:44:27] the dead
[1:44:29] to raise up the name of the dead upon
[1:44:32] his inheritance. This was the problem
[1:44:35] for the nearer kinsmen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And you'll see it in a few moments. You
[1:44:39] want to follow me very very close cuz I
[1:44:42] I this is where I actually wanted to
[1:44:44] preach this morning but I wanted to give
[1:44:46] as much attention as I could to the
[1:44:49] upcoming grad. And and he said that this
[1:44:52] was the the kinsman said I cannot redeem
[1:44:55] it for myself lest I mar my own
[1:45:01] inheritance. Redeem thou my right to
[1:45:04] thyself for I cannot redeem it. Brother
[1:45:07] Brandham said that Satan didn't believe
[1:45:09] that was the son of God at Calvary.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; He actually didn't believe that.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what Judas's what went
[1:45:19] through Judas mind
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; and those that followed him.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; He was only represented by a whole group
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; that came
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; and and came to the garden. He knew
[1:45:29] where the garden was. He knew what
[1:45:32] really the message was about. and he
[1:45:35] went there, but he wasn't able to place
[1:45:36] the value on it.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, the Bible says to us
[1:45:41] that when he finally got to the
[1:45:43] communion table and got to the last
[1:45:45] supper, that they had had communions
[1:45:48] before. They had had Passover before,
[1:45:51] but when they came to this last one and
[1:45:53] then Jesus handed him the sap and that
[1:45:56] was that was like if you did that, that
[1:45:58] was like you were saying something of a
[1:46:00] to a friend. He handed him the sap and
[1:46:02] he says, "What thou doest do quickly and
[1:46:05] he ran out and the Bible says then Satan
[1:46:09] entered him."
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; He actually became a vessel of Satan
[1:46:13] himself.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And that's I'll tell you he was able now
[1:46:16] to go even further. He wasn't just he
[1:46:20] wasn't just a treasure of the group. He
[1:46:22] wasn't just leaving the group. And now
[1:46:25] he was betraying the very thing he said
[1:46:28] he believed.
[1:46:32] Say
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And so now this this is exactly Satan
[1:46:42] himself
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; who went from Lucifer to the serpent and
[1:46:47] spoke to Eve and caused the fall and
[1:46:50] brought listen brought what you and I
[1:46:53] are experiencing. You're not getting
[1:46:55] younger. You're getting older.
[1:47:00] And some I don't want to get on this,
[1:47:03] but
[1:47:05] I trust we'll all go in the rapture.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And I trust I'll be there, too.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; But if not, I could go after the
[1:47:13] service. I do not know. You could go
[1:47:15] after the service.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you could be gone
[1:47:19] before tomorrow.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; We don't know.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And then I ask the songwriter says,
[1:47:25] "What then?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; We want to know. we'll have done our
[1:47:28] best
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And so, uh,
[1:47:35] he's he's dealing with this other this
[1:47:38] other
[1:47:41] near kinsman and he says, "Now this was
[1:47:44] the manner in former time in Israel
[1:47:46] concerning redeeming and concerning
[1:47:49] concerning redeeming
[1:47:53] and concerning changing.
[1:47:59] the two things that I said I would come
[1:48:01] not just a field. So now in life
[1:48:10] is everybody listening.
[1:48:15] Ruth had
[1:48:18] a right by their marriage
[1:48:22] to whatever assets or whatever physical
[1:48:27] uh inheritance there was that was
[1:48:31] already there material physical things
[1:48:35] that was there.
[1:48:38] If a person dies
[1:48:41] and the beneficiaries come to inherit
[1:48:44] that they will inherit whatever it is,
[1:48:50] whatever material assets there is. The
[1:48:53] thing that they don't get to inherit is
[1:48:56] what that individual may have been able
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; to achieve by future life.
[1:49:06] Everything from the future is gone.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; That is where it all changes between the
[1:49:14] nearer kinsmen and Boaz.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Boaz, listen now, I got to start to
[1:49:21] preach. Boaz had the seed of kings in
[1:49:25] him.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; The nearer kinsman did not have Oed in
[1:49:30] him.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Did not have Jesse in him. did not have
[1:49:34] David in him. Obe had that in him.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And so Ruth by getting Boaz would get
[1:49:47] not only what had been lost, but what
[1:49:50] would yet come.
[1:49:53] [Applause]
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And that's where the change was coming.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; She was being exchanged her sorrow for
[1:50:00] the everything that would happen. And
[1:50:03] that's what happens to a believer.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Your sorrow, your past, your darkness,
[1:50:11] all the vile things are gone.
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:16] [Applause]
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; And because this one now, this Christ,
[1:50:23] this second Adam
[1:50:26] removes us from out of the reign of the
[1:50:29] first Adam.
[1:50:32] And the second Adam produces seed, a
[1:50:36] life that the first Adam could not
[1:50:38] produce. He gave it up when he lost his
[1:50:41] inheritance.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; The first Adam could have said, "Move
[1:50:46] this tree." The first Adam could have
[1:50:48] spoke and had children
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that Eve that that
[1:50:54] Eve would have brought forth
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Christ only she was in a hurry.
[1:51:01] and was deceived.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I told you there was swimming water
[1:51:05] here and I've just started
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; and so it was the future aspect.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said instruction
[1:51:17] brings about change.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And the change I'm talking about is the
[1:51:22] change that our nearer command nearer
[1:51:25] kinsmen couldn't bring.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; There was no way. And so Satan in his in
[1:51:32] his words, this nearer kinsman says,
[1:51:34] "But uh I I can't do it." When it came
[1:51:37] to Naomi, when it came to Naomi in a
[1:51:40] parcel of grand, he said, "I'll do it."
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz Naomi was the Orthodox Old Testament
[1:51:47] Jewish church.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And they lived under the blood of bulls
[1:51:53] and goats.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; And they could have gone on slaying
[1:51:56] bulls of goats forever.
[1:51:59] But our future
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; inheritance could never come by the by
[1:52:05] bulls and goats.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; If we're not born again,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; the future's very rugged.
[1:52:21] for not born again.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want this vile, filthy enemy
[1:52:28] called Satan, Lucifer, the serpent, the
[1:52:31] dragon. I wouldn't want him to tamper
[1:52:34] with my life.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And the only hope is to be out of his
[1:52:38] kingdom and out of the kingdom of
[1:52:40] darkness and birth into another kingdom
[1:52:43] of light.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; And you've heard a voice from heaven.
[1:52:49] You've heard a voice with a source from
[1:52:51] heaven.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let the things of this world and
[1:52:55] don't let anybody in the world, I don't
[1:52:57] care who they are, whether they be
[1:52:59] family, friend, peers, associates, or
[1:53:02] who they are, don't let them tamper with
[1:53:05] that soul.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Don't let them tamper with this life.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Keep that commitment absolutely firm.
[1:53:18] Not for my sake.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't think it's for the
[1:53:22] church's sake.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I'd say go and do what you want.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; If you're a son or daughter of God, you
[1:53:32] can't you can't let go.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; You just can't let go.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; So, the second part
[1:53:43] of this redemption, I have mentioned a
[1:53:45] time or two, but never got into it.
[1:53:48] The second part is,
[1:53:52] will you redeem Naomi and the field?
[1:53:54] Yeah, I'll redeem it.
[1:53:58] Be it known to you that when you redeem
[1:54:00] her, you got to also include
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Ruth the Moabitete,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; this gentile girl, she has a part of
[1:54:08] this, and you've got to buy her and
[1:54:11] raise up seed on the head of the dead.
[1:54:16] Jesus Christ the second Adam. Now
[1:54:18] through the first Adam we died
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and through the second Adam he came.
[1:54:23] That's why it was absolutely essential
[1:54:26] that the words of the prophet anchored
[1:54:29] in the womb of Mary. Let it be unto me
[1:54:31] according to thy word. There it was.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit overshadowed her.
[1:54:37] And now she had a sperm that was newly
[1:54:40] created with new blood.
[1:54:44] the blood of God.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; We have not been purchased by the blood
[1:54:48] of goats and animals
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and not not some blood of the
[1:54:52] imagination of the mind seeing Jesus
[1:54:54] suffering way back there. Yes indeed he
[1:54:56] suffered more than that of any man but
[1:54:59] more than his suffering. The thing was
[1:55:01] that there was a bloodline in him
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; that could come no other way
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; but by the originator
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; of creation
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; who created a new blood cell in the womb
[1:55:12] of that woman.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And that is the blood that purchased
[1:55:16] you.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; That is the blood of the kinsman.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; And he raised that seed upon the head of
[1:55:27] the dead.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam, you could never do it. But
[1:55:32] I, the second Adam, I have done it.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm raising up seed on the head of
[1:55:39] the dead. And that's what you are.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; So, number one, give me a few minutes.
[1:55:58] Can I have just a few minutes?
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; So number one, redemption has two parts.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; All the physical estate that was lost.
[1:56:10] You say the physical estate, what was we
[1:56:11] lost? We lost our health.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; People here are sick. You're you're not
[1:56:17] supposed to be sick.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; That belonged to us in this life.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Health
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; that was ours.
[1:56:29] and a normal life.
[1:56:33] I know I speak to people, you probably
[1:56:35] got credit card debt.
[1:56:38] That that isn't what God planned.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Well, the demands of this life. That's
[1:56:44] exactly right. the demands and the
[1:56:48] whatever whatever and the enticements
[1:56:51] and you know have this free and have
[1:56:53] that free and pay nothing for 36 months
[1:56:56] and all this stuff. It's a lie.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; What they're not telling you is you
[1:57:02] don't pay nothing, you know, and all
[1:57:04] that time then we we'll just add it up
[1:57:07] at about 19 or 20%
[1:57:12] interest. It's just part of this whole
[1:57:15] scheme.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; And I I'm not going to preach on one
[1:57:18] thing or the other. I'm just saying that
[1:57:20] was not the life that God had intended.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; That was in this life. That was in this.
[1:57:28] But the other one, the other side,
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; that which was is to come.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; You talk about change. It's an exchange.
[1:57:38] And and and what an exchange took place.
[1:57:41] And now
[1:57:43] now I read something very interesting.
[1:57:46] I want to know because and brother
[1:57:48] Brandham he he speaks about it but he
[1:57:50] doesn't he doesn't interpret it actually
[1:57:52] as such.
[1:57:55] And uh and it says and the scripture
[1:57:57] says now this was the manner in the
[1:57:58] former time in Israel concerning
[1:58:00] redeeming and changing
[1:58:05] because he offered to redeem. But if
[1:58:07] you're going to do that, then you've got
[1:58:09] to take this
[1:58:11] gentile bride. You've got to take this
[1:58:14] Moabitete woman in and and and in in
[1:58:16] this it's all part of this exchange. So
[1:58:18] they were in negotiation.
[1:58:21] And that's what he said he couldn't do.
[1:58:23] He says for to confirm all things to
[1:58:26] confirm all things. In other words, to
[1:58:29] in today we do a handshake. Say is that
[1:58:31] a deal? That's a deal. Okay. We shake
[1:58:34] hands. that symbolizes we have agreed
[1:58:37] and negotiations come to an end. But in
[1:58:41] the in the former time it says to
[1:58:43] confirm all things and this has to do
[1:58:46] with redemption. A man plucked off his
[1:58:49] shoe and gave it to his neighbor and
[1:58:52] this was a testimony in Israel. So, the
[1:58:55] nearer kinsman had to pluck off his shoe
[1:58:58] or his sandal and give it to
[1:59:02] uh Boaz that the deal is done. The
[1:59:07] negotiations are over and the fact you
[1:59:10] have my shoe tells you that the
[1:59:13] negotiations are over and I'm satisfied
[1:59:16] and we're finished and now you can go
[1:59:19] ahead and buy
[1:59:22] this estate.
[1:59:27] I looked at some Hebrew
[1:59:30] Hebrew the Hebrew people have some
[1:59:32] different thoughts about that and rabbis
[1:59:35] and so on and so forth. This is not a
[1:59:36] rabbi but they said that it had a it it
[1:59:42] had a strong symbol
[1:59:44] that because a person's shoe is
[1:59:47] something that you're in. This is the
[1:59:48] way that you're walking. This is the
[1:59:50] direction you're going. In other words,
[1:59:52] your shoe indicates your life.
[1:59:55] You've gone a certain direction. You've
[1:59:56] done done certain things. You've walked
[1:59:59] in your shoe leather and you've done
[2:00:00] certain things. when you take off a
[2:00:03] sandal and give it to another kinsman
[2:00:06] who's buying and there's a formal
[2:00:09] exchange taking place here. It was a
[2:00:12] recognition that there also be a change
[2:00:14] in the family lineage
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; because the other part of the kinsman
[2:00:21] was he was able to raise up children on
[2:00:24] the head of the dead and that's what
[2:00:27] this nearer kinsman could not do. He
[2:00:30] said, "I will mar my Well, mar it of
[2:00:34] course. Do you know why? He's told every
[2:00:36] one of us. Every one of us.
[2:00:40] Well, uh, it'll be, you know, if you
[2:00:43] choose to go this way,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; it'll be harder.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; You'll have this to contend with and you
[2:00:50] have your friends to contend with.
[2:00:52] You'll have your family to contend with.
[2:00:55] You'll have economics to contend with.
[2:00:57] It might not all be bad, of course, but
[2:01:00] you'll have these things. And his job is
[2:01:03] to make his way look better.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; And the way of righteous is to look more
[2:01:09] difficult.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you do that, if I do
[2:01:15] that, it was his opinion that that would
[2:01:18] be a marred life.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I can't do that. I'll mar my
[2:01:24] inheritance.
[2:01:29] And so the Bible says that Boaz took
[2:01:32] Ruth
[2:01:34] and she took he took her to wife. He he
[2:01:38] also had a direction. He didn't have a
[2:01:40] great big party garden party and say,
[2:01:43] "Oh, Naomi, it's so wonderful to have
[2:01:45] you back. I've bought you and I just
[2:01:48] can't I just I I I I just can't imagine
[2:01:52] how wonderful it's going to be to have
[2:01:53] the field back." how much more barley
[2:01:56] we're going to get.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; He wasn't in an interested in barley.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; He was interested in this gentile.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Now stay with me just a moment. I'm not
[2:02:11] I'm not done there. But
[2:02:14] the prophet said, and I have the quote
[2:02:16] here.
[2:02:22] He said that Boaz
[2:02:25] came to the field. Well, perhaps I
[2:02:27] should I should just go back just a just
[2:02:30] a a a pace. The prophet said, "Our
[2:02:34] natural life here that we have is just a
[2:02:37] perversion. Our natural life here is a
[2:02:41] perversion. It really should be the
[2:02:44] right life to begin with." Amen.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; So there I get my point. Because of the
[2:02:51] first Adam, before he could replenish,
[2:02:54] before he could multiply, before he
[2:02:55] could bring forth,
[2:02:57] and if God intended us to come forth, we
[2:03:00] would have come forth.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But before he could bring, sin fell, the
[2:03:06] fall came, thus came.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; And I I had a thought, maybe it'll bless
[2:03:12] somebody. The prophet and I just
[2:03:14] finished speaking. The prophet said that
[2:03:16] Christ was in Adam and Christ was rather
[2:03:19] in Abraham and Christ was in Isaac.
[2:03:21] Christ was in Jacob and he he was coming
[2:03:25] down. I use the word descending cuz he
[2:03:27] was a descendant that came down all the
[2:03:30] way down.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Are you listening real close? Weren't
[2:03:39] you thinking now?
[2:03:42] Everyone
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; that was a type of him. Their whole life
[2:03:47] was a type of him that was coming down
[2:03:51] and through them was actually descending
[2:03:53] in time coming down down down. Every one
[2:03:57] of them was assigned to death.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Every one of them had the sentence of
[2:04:06] death on them.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; You agreeing with me? Yeah.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; And so they were bringing Christ. They
[2:04:13] reflected Christ in all of these things.
[2:04:15] And Boaz and Ruth, what he would buy and
[2:04:18] so on. He comes all the way down. And
[2:04:20] when he's born, he's born. He's They
[2:04:24] didn't bring him down. In other words,
[2:04:26] he descended. They descended.
[2:04:29] They brought him down.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; But their con their their end was death.
[2:04:38] So he had to go to death.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; But he was they were not only sentenced
[2:04:44] to death by their first birth as you and
[2:04:47] I. We were sentenced to hell.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; So he didn't stop his descent at
[2:04:54] Calvary.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; He continued to go down to their
[2:04:59] penalty. That's right.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; And he descended into hell itself.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; And he stripped the keys off of
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; the devil.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; He'd stripped the keys of death, hell,
[2:05:12] and the grave.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; And he rose victorious, the conqueror
[2:05:18] over all of that.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And they brought him down to the
[2:05:23] sentence. They brought him in the
[2:05:25] descent, but he brought them up in his
[2:05:28] ascent.
[2:05:30] Hallelujah.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; They just he brought they brought the
[2:05:34] descent and he brought them up in the
[2:05:36] ascent and he emptied out paradise.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says it so clearly they
[2:05:42] said who is this? Who is they weren't
[2:05:44] even sure what was happening and they
[2:05:46] were certainly were not sure in his
[2:05:48] descending. As I said to you, Joseph
[2:05:50] didn't know it. Ruth didn't know it.
[2:05:53] Do you think that for a moment, friends,
[2:05:55] that Ruth knew or had a clue that she
[2:05:58] would be the mother of of the kings?
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And we do you think that she knew that
[2:06:04] she even had an inkling or a whisper or
[2:06:06] a hint that her name would be in the
[2:06:09] book of life?
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; In the book of the of the book of the
[2:06:13] New Testament, that she'd be in Matthew
[2:06:16] the first chapter. Are you with me,
[2:06:18] friends?
[2:06:20] And I'll say as I've been saying to a
[2:06:22] few other people and you don't know.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; You do not know what your life today is
[2:06:29] meaning in the kingdom of God.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; We do not know it.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; We live like they lived. You say, "Well,
[2:06:36] I know that it gets quiet because
[2:06:38] everybody wants to be hoop h forget it.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; It's just a plain old rugged life. You
[2:06:44] just live and work and pay your bills
[2:06:47] and try to be honest and try to be good
[2:06:50] and it's you're testifying to the Lord
[2:06:53] Jesus Christ.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; But you need to have and have in your
[2:06:57] heart that I have made my resolve. I'm
[2:07:00] headed for the kingdom
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; and nothing shall change that.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; I have heard a word from God. I've heard
[2:07:09] a voice out of heaven. I'm receiving my
[2:07:12] instruction from that source. I'm being
[2:07:15] instructed. I'm being admonished. I'm
[2:07:19] being corrected. I'm receiving all I'm
[2:07:22] being molded. I'm being punished when
[2:07:24] necessary. But it's all good.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; And we need that.
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] The dear hensman, the near kinsman
[2:08:02] didn't have OED in him.
[2:08:04] The name Oed is serving.
[2:08:07] He didn't have serving in him.
[2:08:10] He didn't have Jesse.
[2:08:13] Jesse is I possess.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; You even got that very spirit in you. I
[2:08:22] possess.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; I have existence.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; I have substance.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; They didn't have David in him.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; David the beloved, the beloved of God.
[2:08:39] didn't have it in him. But this one who
[2:08:41] bought you had all of him in him.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Plus,
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; And I'll just leave this with you.
[2:09:09] Brother Pram says that when Boaz came to
[2:09:12] the field,
[2:09:17] you might think I listen, I was I was I
[2:09:19] was almost thinking I'm off in some
[2:09:22] distant place.
[2:09:25] I put so much emphasis on the message,
[2:09:28] not the intricacies of, you know, so
[2:09:31] many things within the message.
[2:09:34] To me, it's what
[2:09:37] I'm simple. I'm a simple man.
[2:09:42] When I see something
[2:09:45] and I see that God and I sense it, I can
[2:09:49] feel it and I see that God is doing
[2:09:52] supernatural thing.
[2:09:55] To this day, if you want to take a
[2:09:57] lesson, if if I depart this world before
[2:10:00] the next service, you'll remember this.
[2:10:05] If I were one of you young men, I would
[2:10:07] just love to be and love to have your
[2:10:09] strength and your youth. And I tell you,
[2:10:12] I would still tear around the world and
[2:10:15] tell people everywhere about what I've
[2:10:18] heard and what I've seen
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; and tell them about this message.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; You may wonder why I've been out going
[2:10:25] out.

[2:11:56] to greet you. Not just a greeting saying
[2:12:00] the echo, friends. The testimony and I
[2:12:03] want to encourage you. I I don't think
[2:12:05] you need encourage. I want it to I want
[2:12:07] it to explode from within the testimony
[2:12:11] that you uphold and sitting here in this
[2:12:14] seat in this service or any other
[2:12:17] service. You are you are testifying
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; of the strength of the message that what
[2:12:23] you believe.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; There's no wavering there. There must be
[2:12:27] no wavering
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; in the true bride of Jesus Christ
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; because the there was no wavering in
[2:12:33] Ruth
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; where did she well you know if things go
[2:12:37] this way and I I don't know I just want
[2:12:39] to check this out. Nonsense.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; She said I'm going with you.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. or find the denominational
[2:12:48] churches went back. And incidentally,
[2:12:51] when people leave this message, there's
[2:12:53] only one place to go.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Back to their gods.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; If you read the scripture now, I'm
[2:13:02] giving you the scripture. They went back
[2:13:04] to their gods.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; They never just leave. They go back to
[2:13:10] their gods. Say, "Well, I know some they
[2:13:12] backslid in the world." That's their
[2:13:15] gods. That's right.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And Orpa, who is the type of the
[2:13:21] denominational church, and the scriptur
[2:13:24] is very clear, she went back to her
[2:13:26] gods.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; And Ruth didn't have any gods.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Whoever is the god of Naomi, your god
[2:13:36] will be my god.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; She wasn't even sure who that god was.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; But that was her. That was her confirmed
[2:13:46] statement.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, that the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:13:49] sitting here this morning will say the
[2:13:51] same thing. The God of Elijah will be my
[2:13:55] God. I don't know where this message is
[2:13:57] going to lead me. The God that brought
[2:13:59] this word shall be my God.
[2:14:03] [Applause]
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I've done this before. I'll do it again
[2:14:14] because I think and I'm just going to
[2:14:16] leave now and close.
[2:14:22] This is God's last will in testament.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to do? This is
[2:14:28] his last will in testament. He's not
[2:14:31] going to change his mind about it.
[2:14:33] Right.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; What you have,
[2:14:38] what you have physically in physical
[2:14:42] natural blessings, that's all fixed.
[2:14:45] He's told about it here.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And what you will get, he hasn't told
[2:14:50] everything.
[2:14:52] But this is a will. And apostle Paul
[2:14:54] says that a test a testament a will is
[2:14:59] not effective sir
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; until the testator dies.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's why he had to come in flesh to
[2:15:08] die.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; And as soon as he died it made the will
[2:15:12] effective.
[2:15:15] As soon as he died, the will is
[2:15:16] effective.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And the will goes into the hands of the
[2:15:20] executive
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; and the executive, he came back so he
[2:15:25] could be executive to his own will.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Because I live."
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about the life along
[2:15:32] the shores of Galilee. Because I live.
[2:15:35] I've gone through death. I've come back
[2:15:36] in the resurrection. Because I live, you
[2:15:39] shall live also.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Now, what's he talking about? He's
[2:15:44] talking about the changing part.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Not just the natural part, but the
[2:15:49] changing part that the nearer kinsman
[2:15:52] couldn't give us
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; because he didn't have the bloodline
[2:15:57] [Applause]
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; and when the testator dies, the will
[2:16:02] becomes effective. And so now I'll just
[2:16:04] bring it down to what you understand.
[2:16:06] Say that someone that has included you
[2:16:08] in their will, they died.
[2:16:12] you you you just have whatever you had
[2:16:15] an hour ago, 10 minutes ago. That that's
[2:16:17] what you have. That's what you own. And
[2:16:20] you're called into a lawyer's office
[2:16:23] and he opens up the will.
[2:16:30] And to my wife, I leave the family home.
[2:16:34] Maybe it's in his name, but by virtue of
[2:16:38] this, now it's hers. Amen.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; What is this? This is just ink on paper.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; What is this?
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Ink on paper.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; But this has been confirmed, vindicated.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; If supernatural God wrote it, so a
[2:16:54] supernatural God came and showed it's me
[2:16:57] that has said these things.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; I'll send a man who's only had a seventh
[2:17:01] grade education. I'll send it to the
[2:17:03] most educated generation of all history.
[2:17:08] And I'll have him speak things that you
[2:17:11] have to believe. And if you turn that
[2:17:13] one down, you're lost.
[2:17:15] [Applause]
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Because God can do no more.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; He confirmed it to the eenth degree.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "And to my son, I'll
[2:17:27] leave the car
[2:17:30] and the farm tractor and the farm.
[2:17:35] and to my daughter, I'll leave the
[2:17:37] condominium or the the cottage at the
[2:17:40] lake. Those people
[2:17:43] came in
[2:17:45] just being who they are,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Without that ownership,
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; And they didn't know what they were
[2:17:53] going to have. They didn't know about
[2:17:55] what father's going to say, I give it
[2:17:56] all to the, you know, uh, Salvation Army
[2:18:01] or some other charity. No, now they
[2:18:05] hear. They hear by a valid voice
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; who reads paper, words on paper
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; that you now own
[2:18:18] a house or a condominium or a cottage.
[2:18:22] You now own it. And when you walk out
[2:18:24] that door, you're the owner of something
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; that you didn't own when you walked in.
[2:18:33] So in the revealing of Jesus Christ,
[2:18:35] when Jesus Christ Jesus Christ himself
[2:18:37] said, and here's my closing words, Jesus
[2:18:40] Christ said to the whole world, when you
[2:18:42] see the days of Lot once again, when you
[2:18:45] see Sodom, when you see
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; just the other day,
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; they unfurled at a Canadian army base,
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; a gay pride flag
[2:19:00] and respect of all of the gates. What
[2:19:03] about the Christian flag?
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; How many Christians are here? I feel
[2:19:12] insulted,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; We don't need a flag to say what our
[2:19:18] sexual orientation is.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; What kind of nonsense? Why does this
[2:19:22] have to come forward? There's a spirit
[2:19:24] behind it driving it
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; because this word says that would
[2:19:28] happen.
[2:19:31] And we don't want to be ignorant. Can
[2:19:32] you say
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Is that happening?
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; And it's pervading everywhere
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; in everything.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And when you see the days of Noah, I'm
[2:19:49] going to come back.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show myself
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; in a spectacular way.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:57] And furthermore, I will have a valid
[2:20:00] voice
[2:20:01] that you can hear with your own ears.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; And in that voice, I will I will confirm
[2:20:08] and I will seal it with a supernatural
[2:20:10] sign so that you'll know that this sign
[2:20:12] cannot be questioned.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; And that sign is saying that this is the
[2:20:17] mouth
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; that is supposed to say the things. And
[2:20:21] those things are concerning the changing
[2:20:24] part. The part that we didn't have in
[2:20:26] natural life.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Understand that's very
[2:20:32] clear.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is all about.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have all the answers, but do you
[2:20:42] mind if I just tell you things that I'm
[2:20:43] wondering about?
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Pluck off your shoe."
[2:20:49] as a symbol that this exchange is taking
[2:20:52] place.
[2:20:55] Moses when he came before the burning
[2:20:57] bush
[2:20:58] and this is the first encounter
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; that a human that's dying
[2:21:05] is having with the eternal God.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; And God is going to tell him, "I'm the
[2:21:14] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Amen.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "He's the God of the
[2:21:20] living, not of the dead."
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; And a man who is dying is standing
[2:21:25] before the pillar of fire. And the
[2:21:27] pillar of fire, the voice, you never saw
[2:21:29] it,
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; but the voice out of the pillar of fire
[2:21:32] says, "Take off your shoes.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; This is holy ground."
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; And not only holy ground, but they were
[2:21:38] negotiating.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send you. I've heard their
[2:21:43] cry. I'm going to send you because there
[2:21:45] was going to be a change of family
[2:21:47] lines.
[2:21:49] [Applause]
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be raised in Egypt
[2:21:53] anymore. I'm taking them out for people
[2:21:56] for myself.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; And in this day, I'll tell you, there
[2:22:03] went on some negotiation between the
[2:22:05] prophet of God and almighty God.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; He he he didn't want to go. I said,
[2:22:10] "I'll I'll give you two signs like I
[2:22:12] gave Moses. I'll give you two signs."
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, friend, this voice
[2:22:17] is so valid. This voice is so
[2:22:19] vindicated. This voice is so come from
[2:22:21] the throne of God.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Because he came with a sign that he's
[2:22:27] going to change our family lines.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; And this prophet said he didn't come
[2:22:32] from Ella and Charlie Brham. And when he
[2:22:35] found out he came from God,
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; when this prophet finally said, "You're
[2:22:40] a gene of almighty God, you came out of
[2:22:43] the very loins of God."
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like you were in your
[2:22:47] grandfather, like you were in your
[2:22:49] father, you came out of the loins of
[2:22:51] God.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that matters.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:02] G.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; And we've heard things in the message
[2:23:04] we've never heard before.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; There's no place there's no message on
[2:23:10] earth that can tell you you never sinned
[2:23:11] in the first place. Why? That's part of
[2:23:14] the negotiation.
[2:23:15] You tell them.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; You tell them they are the spotless,
[2:23:20] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:25] I'm changing the family lines.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; And then the negotiation went on with
[2:23:32] the prophet of God. And he come to the
[2:23:34] end of his ministry and spoke a message
[2:23:37] that the people needed to hear.
[2:23:41] [Applause]
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm over my time.
[2:23:57] What a message.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; What a message we have.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; We don't have to pump it up.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; We don't have to even try to make
[2:24:07] something out of it,
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; We just have to tell the people what it
[2:24:11] is.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Say what it is.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's Let's just stand and
[2:24:17] thank him.
[2:24:19] Oh, we thank you, Lord.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Father.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the day that you've given
[2:24:27] us,
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; for the word that you've given us.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't even know how to
[2:24:32] handle it. Oh, God. Sometime we feel so
[2:24:35] unworthy to take it up. We feel so
[2:24:38] unworthy to even begin to speak about
[2:24:40] it.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; But I hear the people have come.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; They've driven miles. They've heard, oh
[2:24:45] God, and something has spoken to them. I
[2:24:48] pray, oh God, there will be decisions
[2:24:49] and there'll be choices. I pray for that
[2:24:52] you'll bless the graduating class, oh
[2:24:54] God, as they're moving towards their
[2:24:56] ceremonies. I pray, oh God, you'll bless
[2:24:59] brother Tatch and his wife Shelly and
[2:25:02] all the teachers, oh God, and there and
[2:25:05] the staff and the instruction that they
[2:25:07] have given. Oh God, we believe that this
[2:25:10] is an very very significant important
[2:25:12] part of the overall work of God. Father,
[2:25:16] I pray that you'll bless the school.
[2:25:18] Bless the camp, oh God. Brother Derek,
[2:25:20] and those that are there, Father, and
[2:25:23] all the staff, I pray you'll bless them,
[2:25:25] oh God. Brother Jason and Sister Sammy,
[2:25:28] and the sisters that work there, oh God,
[2:25:30] I pray that you'll bless them. Father, I
[2:25:33] ask that you will remember us here as
[2:25:36] we're gathering for service this
[2:25:37] evening. Lord, give us such a glorious
[2:25:40] time in your presence throughout the
[2:25:42] whole afternoon. those that were not
[2:25:44] able to be here. I pray, Father, that
[2:25:46] you will somehow speak to them, oh God,
[2:25:50] and and let their hearts be touched by
[2:25:53] your presence. Lord Jesus, I thank you
[2:25:57] for the one more opportunity
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; to declare,
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; declare those things are so alive and
[2:26:03] vivid in my own soul, oh God. And may
[2:26:08] somehow with this spark and fire and
[2:26:10] flame go out to someone else. Lord, let
[2:26:14] some of these young men rise and as our
[2:26:17] brother Kyle has, oh God, brother John,
[2:26:20] father, how we thank you for young men
[2:26:23] feeling the anointing of the Holy
[2:26:25] Spirit. Raise up ministers, oh God.
[2:26:29] Bless them in Victoria today. Bless them
[2:26:32] in Seattle today. Oh God, in the name of
[2:26:35] Jesus Christ,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; I understand, Lord, our brother Daniel
[2:26:38] is coming to a graduation.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; and he's worked hard and received a lot
[2:26:44] of instruction. Pray that you'll bless
[2:26:46] him, Father.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:56] Could we sing that chorus that we sang
[2:26:59] at the beginning? Have you been to the
[2:27:00] fountain? Yes, I've been to the
[2:27:02] fountain. We're going to close right
[2:27:03] away.
