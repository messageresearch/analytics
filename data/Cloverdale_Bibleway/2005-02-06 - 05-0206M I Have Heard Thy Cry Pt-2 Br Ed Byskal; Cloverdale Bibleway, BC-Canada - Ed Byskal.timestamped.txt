[20:27] rejected and alone like a rose.
[20:33] Trampled on the ground.
[20:38] You took the fall
[20:42] and you thought of me
[20:46] above all.
[21:32] Joseph. Joseph lived a life
[21:37] of hurt and hatred.
[21:44] And even his own family brought him
[21:50] pain.
[21:56] And when his brothers
[21:58] thought that he would surely
[22:04] seek revenge,
[22:07] he said, "I have seen
[22:10] God's purpose now
[22:13] made plain."
[22:16] It was the tender
[22:20] hand
[22:24] of Jehovah.
[22:30] I look back and see
[22:34] he was always leading
[22:38] me.
[22:42] And what was meant for evil,
[22:47] God has used to show me his great love.
[22:54] I now understand
[22:58] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[23:09] Many Jews were killed
[23:14] and saw a sunder.
[23:20] And it seemed that God had lift his very
[23:27] own.
[23:31] Oh, but through it all,
[23:35] God had a plan. And little Jid they know
[23:43] oh that he would lead all of his
[23:47] children all back home.
[23:55] So how can I deny
[24:00] his hand of mercy?
[24:04] Oh,
[24:06] when trles came and they left no reason
[24:12] why.
[24:16] And I just stand and say that everything
[24:23] has worked out for my good.
[24:28] Oh, he has all he has all the answers
[24:32] for my life.
[24:37] It was the tent
[24:44] of Jehovah.
[24:50] I look back and see
[24:54] he was always leading
[24:58] me.
[25:02] And what was
[25:04] glory?
[25:06] Oh, God has used to show me his great
[25:12] love. I now understand
[25:17] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; And what was made for evil, God has used
[25:33] to show
[25:36] me his great love.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; I now understand.
[25:41] I now understand.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; I now understand.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; I now understand.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; I now understand
[25:54] the tender hand
[25:57] of
[25:58] Jehovah.
[26:01] Jehovah.
[26:06] tender
[26:10] Jehovah.

[30:20] prayer. This is your house.
[30:26] This is your house.
[30:31] come anywhere.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; I know that's our desire,
[30:42] everyone's desire that he'll come and
[30:44] dwell.
[30:46] I pray and I want you to join with me in
[30:49] prayer that God will take absolute
[30:53] control
[30:55] of every mind and every thought and
[30:57] every person in the name of Jesus
[31:00] Christ. Amen. That he will have his way
[31:04] and he'll be glorified.
[31:09] Let's just ask the Lord's grace and
[31:12] blessing upon the word as we're about to
[31:15] read it.
[31:19] I know everyone's been welcomed here
[31:21] already
[31:23] and I just need so much the leadership
[31:26] of the Holy Spirit. Father,
[31:29] I so appreciate
[31:32] the congregation that have gathered here
[31:34] today.
[31:36] I see those that have journeyied a long
[31:38] distances
[31:40] to be with us
[31:42] and those that are even much further in
[31:45] other places around the world.
[31:49] Oh God, I pray that you'll bless every
[31:51] home, every room, every building
[31:56] where they are. Your children, members
[32:00] of your body
[32:03] are hearttoheart with us just now
[32:06] saying amen. We can't hear it, but we
[32:09] sense it and we feel it. And here, oh
[32:13] God, in this gathering of people, the
[32:16] building is fallen to capacity. We
[32:19] didn't come here, Lord, to be
[32:22] entertained or just to see one another.
[32:25] Although that is wonderful when we can
[32:28] shake one another's hand, but we're here
[32:31] that we might be your house.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; We're here that we might be vessels of
[32:36] the Holy Ghost.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; We're here, Father, that we might have
[32:42] every joint supply and that we might be
[32:45] compacted by that which every joint does
[32:48] supply. I pray that you'll remove every
[32:50] hindrance. Oh God, remove every
[32:53] restriction, Father. And in the name of
[32:55] Jesus Christ, take absolute control of
[32:59] every person, every mind, every thought,
[33:01] Lord. And I pray, Father, you'll take
[33:04] now uh my being as I stand here at the
[33:07] post of duty. I pray that the words will
[33:10] be chosen by the Holy Spirit and
[33:14] punctuated, sent to the very heart of
[33:18] each individual.
[33:20] May it be suited to their need. Lord, do
[33:23] amongst us, oh God, the great things
[33:24] that we need to have done. There are
[33:26] those that perhaps sick and afflicted in
[33:28] their body. May the very presence of the
[33:31] Lord Jesus Christ deliver them by the
[33:33] virtue of the resurrected Christ. You're
[33:36] not a God of history. You're a God that
[33:38] is here now, have been raised out of
[33:41] history by a message of this hour, Lord.
[33:44] And we believe with all of our hearts
[33:46] and souls, asking now, oh God, that
[33:50] you'll be pleased
[33:53] and that your name will be glorified and
[33:55] you'll be lifted up in Jesus Christ's
[33:58] name. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] Well, greetings
[34:06] on this lovely day.
[34:09] Haven't got sunshine outside, but we
[34:11] have sunshine inside.
[34:14] Nice to see you, brother Mickey. Sister
[34:16] Lily, nice to see brother Kevin,
[34:20] Sister Terry, God bless you, my come and
[34:24] have these surprises. I got a wonderful
[34:26] email. I was going to even read it, but
[34:28] I won't take time. from Brazil, a family
[34:32] down there, and it's one of the main
[34:35] translating families. And they said that
[34:39] we stream, we live streamed the meeting,
[34:42] and uh they're just so blessed. I had
[34:45] didn't know that uh they were doing
[34:48] that, but uh we we just get word from
[34:51] different parts of the world where
[34:52] they're live streaming. They get up at
[34:55] all hours and and stay awake at all
[34:58] hours just to join with you. And I think
[35:00] that we could say God bless you,
[35:02] couldn't we? Of all those. Amen.
[35:04] Hallelujah. I'm going to read from three
[35:07] places in the scripture.
[35:10] Uh I will read from Romans first in the
[35:13] 11th chapter
[35:16] and uh then
[35:18] Matthew 23
[35:21] 23rd chapter and from Hosea
[35:25] the 6th chapter.
[35:28] It's a different service this morning
[35:30] and I would appreciate your prayers
[35:35] and uh your trust.
[35:38] Uh anything that is said I wish to say
[35:42] under the uncction of the Holy Spirit
[35:45] and it's going to be different for me
[35:47] also. I'm I just was playing some of
[35:50] brother Brandham's message uniting sign
[35:52] and time on the way to church and he
[35:54] spent almost the whole time telling how
[35:56] nervous he was
[35:58] and it takes me about 10 15 minutes to
[36:01] drive here. So he spent about 10 minutes
[36:03] telling how nervous he was and I thought
[36:04] well that's very suited for me right now
[36:07] when I when I come to church. Uh
[36:11] we I have a video that brother Michelle
[36:15] has worked very hard to put together.
[36:17] And incidentally, I do want to say uh
[36:20] brother Tony will be speaking tonight
[36:22] and he he spoke with people and met
[36:25] individuals that I did not meet and he
[36:28] has slides and picture shots that he
[36:31] took and he whatever the Lord's laid on
[36:34] his heart and the scripture we haven't
[36:36] spoken together a great deal but um this
[36:40] trip which we just had to Poland
[36:43] uh it's uh I want to take an aspect ect
[36:47] of it from the scriptures today. And I
[36:50] wanted to say how much I appreciated
[36:52] brother Tony and brother Michelle. These
[36:54] brothers worked very very hard, very
[36:57] hard, long hours and cold and without
[37:02] food much of the time and it is poured
[37:04] it all on. So what you are able to sit
[37:07] and see today and participate in I I
[37:12] know that you appreciate it and I think
[37:14] it would be nice if you you know let
[37:17] brother Michelle know let brother Tony
[37:19] know that you appreciate their efforts.
[37:22] We we I certainly appreciated them on
[37:25] this trip. I know brother Michelle been
[37:26] working probably way into the night
[37:29] tonight to have last night to have
[37:32] things ready for you. So, uh, we
[37:35] appreciate brothers like that, don't we?
[37:40] And then I have to, you know, after I
[37:42] show the video because it's about, we
[37:44] tried to make it about 15 minutes, but
[37:46] it's about 30. And uh, and and it's hard
[37:50] to pick up a service after a video. So,
[37:53] after the video's shown, if I come
[37:56] thundering out here, you'll know I don't
[37:58] want you just to die
[38:01] there.
[38:03] you just stay with it.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And yet uh I'll just like to say a word
[38:09] too about the video because this was the
[38:12] uh 60th anniversary of the liberation of
[38:14] Awitz, but there were also other
[38:18] uh events that were taking place which
[38:23] uh are commemorating aspects of of of
[38:27] war. in that there was uh uh soldiers of
[38:31] of of the Polish army and so on so
[38:34] forth. And so we were in Poland and we
[38:36] were part of a delegation of of the
[38:38] Israeli uh delegation. And so then they
[38:42] went to the Israeli uh cemetery as well.
[38:47] And then they went also to the cemetery
[38:50] of uh
[38:52] uh of the unknown soldier. and they he's
[38:56] an unknown soldier, but they wanted to
[38:59] have a commemoration there. And there's
[39:02] actually a a 21 gun salute. So, don't be
[39:06] uh you know, disturbed with it. It's
[39:08] just uh but we we wanted you to
[39:10] experience what we experienced. And we
[39:13] were not in our agenda. We were in their
[39:15] agenda. So, we were just going from
[39:17] place to place knowing that God was
[39:19] having us to meet with who we should
[39:21] meet.
[39:22] So now we will read the scripture out of
[39:26] Romans the 11th chapter.
[39:30] Uh I'm going to read from
[39:34] the uh
[39:36] 15th verse.
[39:39] Uh just some choice verses.
[39:43] For if the casting away of them,
[39:45] speaking of the Jews, for if the casting
[39:48] away of them be the reconciling of the
[39:51] world,
[39:53] what shall the receiving of them be but
[39:55] life from the dead? And if the first
[39:59] fruits be holy, the lump is also holy.
[40:02] And if the root be holy, so are the
[40:04] branches.
[40:06] And if some of the branches be broken
[40:08] off,
[40:10] notice that please. And thou being a
[40:13] wild olive tree, where it grafted in
[40:15] among them, and with them partakest of
[40:18] the root, and fatness of the olive tree,
[40:22] boast not against the branches. But if
[40:26] thou boast, thou beest not the root, but
[40:28] the root thee. Thou would say, then the
[40:32] branches were broken off, that I might
[40:35] be grafted in. Well, because of unbelief
[40:40] they were broken off, and thou standest
[40:43] by faith. Be not high- minded, but fear.
[40:47] For if God spared not the natural
[40:49] branches, take heed, lest ye also spare
[40:54] not thee. Behold therefore the goodness
[40:57] and severity of God on them which fell
[41:02] severity,
[41:04] but toward thee goodness if thou
[41:07] continue in this in his goodness,
[41:10] otherwise thou shalt be cut off. And
[41:13] they also, if they abide not still in
[41:16] unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God
[41:19] is able to graft them in again.
[41:25] I want you to recall, behold therefore
[41:27] the goodness and the severity of God.
[41:32] And then in in uh Matthew the 23rd
[41:35] chapter verse 27.
[41:40] Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that klest
[41:42] the prophets and stoneest them which are
[41:44] sent unto thee, how often would I have
[41:47] gathered thy children together, even as
[41:51] a hen gatherth her chickens under her
[41:54] wings, and you would not. Behold, your
[41:57] house is left unto you desolate. For I
[42:00] say unto you, ye shall not see me
[42:02] henceforth, till ye shall say, blessed
[42:06] is he that cometh in the name of the
[42:08] Lord. And then in Hosea, please the
[42:11] sixth chapter
[42:14] just a couple of verses.
[42:18] Come and let us return unto the Lord,
[42:21] for he hath torn, and he will heal us.
[42:26] He hath smitten and he will bind us up.
[42:31] After two days will he revive us. In the
[42:35] third day he will raise us up and we
[42:39] shall live in his sight. Amen. God bless
[42:42] you. Thank you for remaining standing,
[42:45] being patient.
[42:54] I appreciate your full attention and as
[42:56] little movement as possible.
[43:02] I'd like to draw your attention to
[43:05] broken branches.
[43:09] He hath torn.
[43:12] He hath smitten.
[43:15] And Jesus said, "Your house is left to
[43:17] you desolate."
[43:19] I'm going to continue with the subject
[43:22] before I we were went to Poland. I have
[43:25] heard their cry. When God spoke to Moses
[43:29] and said, I have heard their cry. But my
[43:33] subject today is behold your house is
[43:36] left to you desolate.
[43:40] When I was
[43:42] uh walking on the grounds of Awitz and
[43:46] Burkanau,
[43:48] I thought of this scripture continually.
[43:53] How desolate
[43:55] their house became,
[43:58] how desolate the house of the Jewish
[44:01] people became.
[44:04] And uh
[44:06] when he said that that uh he had torn
[44:10] Now I want to I want to be very careful.
[44:14] I want to emphasize,
[44:17] you know, there are there are things
[44:18] about God and I'm going to make some
[44:20] statements today that
[44:22] perhaps uh may be difficult may be
[44:25] difficult for me to say, may be
[44:27] difficult for some to receive.
[44:30] But you know, uh I I've just determined
[44:34] more and more and more in my own mind
[44:36] that God
[44:38] is beyond our understanding.
[44:41] There's just so little that we can
[44:44] really grasp of this great
[44:48] one that we call our God, our father.
[44:53] And his working and his doing is so far
[44:55] beyond
[44:57] our grasp. And as I move through this
[45:00] subject, that just becomes more and more
[45:03] evident.
[45:07] I don't understand exactly
[45:10] when God smites, when God hath torn,
[45:16] when God spoke through the very lips of
[45:19] Jesus Christ and said, "Your house is
[45:21] left here desolate." I'm going to be
[45:24] moving through that with a lot of
[45:26] detail.
[45:28] And we are here. We're a multi-ultural
[45:32] congregation. We've got people from
[45:35] every country
[45:37] and from Europe and from
[45:42] uh England and the Netherlands and from
[45:45] Germany and from Poland and about 37
[45:50] nations that are here. When we speak
[45:53] about Awitz and we speak about the
[45:56] second war and the armies that fought, I
[46:00] want this congregation to understand
[46:03] clearly and especially those whose
[46:07] homeland has been your birthplace has
[46:10] been in Germany. I want you to
[46:12] understand we are of one nation.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; We are of a heavenly nation, a holy
[46:20] nation. and you are not identified with
[46:24] the things that armies and war has
[46:28] committed and uh just today now you'll
[46:32] understand as I move through the service
[46:35] listen very closely just this last week
[46:39] this nation called Canada Christian
[46:42] nation
[46:44] that is a disgraceful word the fact that
[46:49] we can gather here in freedom and
[46:51] worship. That is just one thing. But
[46:54] when a nation
[46:56] will take their Supreme Court and call
[47:00] it a Christian nation and have this
[47:02] Bible in their courouses
[47:05] and then come and pass pass laws for a
[47:09] same-sex marriage.
[47:12] It is
[47:15] I I don't want to get ahead of myself,
[47:18] but God himself
[47:20] had a crematorium
[47:23] &gt;&gt; for that same sin.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; And our so-called Christian government
[47:32] wants to impose that upon our society.
[47:36] And what I say today could put us into a
[47:39] lot of trouble. Put me into a lot of
[47:42] trouble. And I wouldn't be a bit
[47:44] surprised, friends. I wouldn't be a bit
[47:46] surprised that someday some of us pay
[47:49] with our lives
[47:51] &gt;&gt; for this gospel.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; It's still a gospel dripping with blood.
[47:59] And if some of of elements of society
[48:03] knew in truth
[48:04] &gt;&gt; what you believe in your heart, you
[48:08] wouldn't merely lose your job. You
[48:10] wouldn't merely lose your business. You
[48:12] wouldn't merely be ostracized.
[48:14] You would be persecuted
[48:18] &gt;&gt; very much so. And we'll find out.
[48:23] And I want you to answer be able to
[48:25] answer yourself whether you really
[48:26] believe this message or whether you
[48:30] hitchhike along or whether in fact you
[48:32] actually believe it. You know, we
[48:35] believe it until it doesn't cost us
[48:37] something. But when it starts to really
[48:39] cost us something,
[48:42] &gt;&gt; then you find out whether we're just,
[48:45] you know, riding along or or are we
[48:48] really prepared to pay the whole price.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] It says he hath torn.
[48:58] He He rent them. It was God that did it.
[49:02] Whether God uses Mussolini or Hitler or
[49:05] uses Stalin or who he uses or uses a
[49:09] Pharaoh or uses Nebuchadnezzar,
[49:12] that's none of our business. God raises
[49:14] up and uses whomsoever he uses
[49:20] &gt;&gt; to accomplish the fulfillment of his
[49:23] word. And you will never understand, I
[49:26] will never understand how the great mind
[49:29] of God operates to accomplish his
[49:33] certain uh certain things that he
[49:35] intends to fulfill.
[49:39] He hath torn
[49:43] He has smitten to strike,
[49:47] to be beaten, to attack, and to destroy,
[49:50] to conquer,
[49:52] to ravage,
[49:56] to be slain.
[49:58] He hath smitten.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Just how torn and just how smitten
[50:07] and just how blinded.
[50:10] Paul said they've been blinded.
[50:14] Just how blinded,
[50:16] dreadfully blinded.
[50:19] Just how torn? We will find out. Just
[50:23] how smitten and how desolate.
[50:29] I think that the warnings of Jesus
[50:33] when he said, "Your house is left here
[50:35] desolate."
[50:38] I think that that warning
[50:41] really didn't ring
[50:43] very with very much power with the
[50:48] people. Do you know why
[50:50] everything just kept on going?
[50:53] The next day they did what they did
[50:55] today
[50:57] and this week, next week they did what
[51:00] they did this week and the next month it
[51:03] was the same. And brother Brandham says
[51:06] it just went on.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; He refers to this scripture and making
[51:10] that scripture refer right to this time
[51:12] because even in the rejection of the
[51:14] message of the hour, people just think,
[51:17] well, it just goes on. There's there's
[51:20] really no uh there's no consequence.
[51:26] There's no consequence of rejecting or
[51:28] saying, "Well, I don't believe it. It it
[51:30] just the world just goes on." And the
[51:33] world continued right on as though
[51:36] nothing had happened. And this is in
[51:38] souls that are in prison.
[51:41] Jesus said, "If you'd only known your
[51:45] day, Jerusalem, if you could only
[51:48] recognize."
[51:50] But he said, "Now you're left to your
[51:54] own. If you'd only, oh Jerusalem,
[51:57] Jerusalem, how oft
[51:59] you as a hen her brood from the judgment
[52:04] that is to come. But you didn't know
[52:07] your day. You that stoned the prophets
[52:09] and killed the righteous. If you'd only
[52:12] known your day, if you'd only known and
[52:16] had been uh upon your scriptures to know
[52:20] that my coming was a sign of your end.
[52:23] And now you're blind. Now you've been
[52:26] rebuked. Your time is over. The
[52:29] prophets, that's not He wasn't only
[52:31] making reference back then, but he was
[52:33] speaking it going projecting it from
[52:36] then to the present moment.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; You've rejected it. Your time is over.
[52:41] And and it was. He said, "If they'd only
[52:44] known their time." Look, he says, "When
[52:46] Jesus made that declaration, the world
[52:49] went right on. The world went right on.
[52:53] normally. Why? For they knew not their
[52:55] day or their hour. The world went right
[52:57] on. It didn't mean that there wasn't
[53:00] that the that the statement wasn't
[53:02] potent. It didn't mean that it wasn't
[53:05] powerful. It didn't mean that it wasn't
[53:07] true. And it didn't mean that it wasn't
[53:09] going to be fulfilled. It was fulfilled.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm referring to.
[53:15] You talk about
[53:18] the beginning of their suffering AD.70.
[53:22] We refer back to when Titus the great
[53:25] Roman general besieged the city of
[53:28] Jerusalem and brother Brandham said they
[53:31] ate their children.
[53:34] Now we sit here in a comfortable church
[53:37] but if you had to sit in Jerusalem in a
[53:40] besieged city and see th those events
[53:44] you you you would rather turn pale. I
[53:47] would think
[53:49] &gt;&gt; that is something that most of us
[53:53] scarcely could look upon
[53:55] &gt;&gt; but that was the beginning of their
[53:57] desolation.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; That was the ful starting the
[54:01] fulfillment of the words of Jesus
[54:03] Christ. I want to say Jesus said some
[54:06] things and the fulfillment of those
[54:08] things are not really pleasant.
[54:13] you know, we like to have everything,
[54:14] you know, just pleasant so it's all, you
[54:17] know, palatable and so on. Much of the
[54:19] gospel, it's not that easy to, you can
[54:24] read it, but if you just if you just
[54:26] delegate it to some place in the past,
[54:28] but it's not back there, friends. It's
[54:30] right up here.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And and he said, "And what shall I do
[54:36] with Jesus?" He said, "They ate one
[54:38] another's children.
[54:40] They ate the bark off the trees and the
[54:42] grass off the ground, which isn't new.
[54:45] They ate all the grass. The Polish
[54:47] people and and some of the people we
[54:50] talked to told us that the the people
[54:53] that were prisoners in the camps ate the
[54:56] grass. There was no grass around. They
[54:58] ate the grass and the roots trying to
[55:01] survive.
[55:04] And he said they ate the grass and then
[55:07] Titus rode right in and just tore down
[55:09] the walls and burnt the city and the
[55:12] blood ran out and down the streets like
[55:16] that where where he'd murdered them in
[55:19] there. I was reading where Josephus when
[55:22] the city was besieged and he had a good
[55:25] standing with Titus with this general
[55:29] and Josephus a great Jewish uh historian
[55:33] and he had such a had such a good
[55:35] rapport with Titus. He asked Titus if he
[55:39] could get his family out. And Titus
[55:42] said, "Yes, you may have your family
[55:44] out." And so he gathered his family and
[55:47] got them out. And then he asked if he
[55:50] could have his friends out. And uh Titus
[55:53] said he could have his friends. He could
[55:55] gather his friends together. He gathered
[55:57] about 150 people. And I believe on
[56:00] another occasion he gathered, they had a
[56:02] number of 190. And I don't know if it's
[56:05] 190 plus the 150 or whether that was
[56:08] just an expanded number because there's
[56:11] volumes to really read about the
[56:13] besieged city of Jerusalem. And he was
[56:16] even restricted and hindered by uh
[56:19] others of the of the Roman uh military
[56:22] and he went back to Titus and said
[56:24] they're stopping me from getting these
[56:27] people out. and Titus gave him a gave
[56:30] him uh a a document or whatever was
[56:33] necessary and gave him authority to take
[56:35] those people out and he saved those
[56:37] people out. But that's the only people
[56:39] we know. But a prophet said that the
[56:42] believers who believed on the Lord Jesus
[56:44] Christ, not one of them was caught in
[56:47] there.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Now that was the beginning of their
[56:52] destruction and desolation. And he said,
[56:55] "Before a just God could let a people
[56:59] that he had chosen to come under such a
[57:02] thing as that, there has to be a just
[57:05] reason. He's just. His laws demand his
[57:10] justice. And a law without penalty is
[57:13] not a law." So God's just, and I'm glad
[57:17] that he's just.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that he's just.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Aren't you?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; And God spoke through Moses and he
[57:29] prophesied how and why God would scatter
[57:34] Israel
[57:36] amongst the nations. Now, he said in in
[57:39] Deuteronomy, I'm just going to read it
[57:40] for you, please.
[57:43] He said, "I must die and I must I must
[57:47] not go over Jordan, but you shall go
[57:49] over and possess this good land.
[57:53] Take heed
[57:55] unto yourselves, lest you forget the
[57:57] covenant of the Lord your God, which he
[58:00] made with you, and make you no make a
[58:04] graven
[58:06] uh which he made with you, and make you
[58:08] a graven image, or the likeness of
[58:10] anything which the Lord thy God hath
[58:13] forbidden thee. For the Lord thy God is
[58:16] a consuming fire, even a jealous God,
[58:21] when thou shalt begget children and
[58:23] children's children, and you shall have
[58:25] remained long in the land, and shall
[58:27] corrupt yourselves, and make a graven
[58:30] image or likeness of anything, and shall
[58:33] do the evil in the sight of the Lord thy
[58:35] God, and provoke him to anger. I call
[58:39] heaven and earth to witness against you
[58:42] this day that you shall soon utterly
[58:45] perish from off the land whereto you go
[58:49] over Jordan to possess it. You shall not
[58:52] prolong your days upon it, but shall
[58:55] utterly be destroyed. And he says, "And
[58:58] the Lord, and the Lord shall scatter you
[59:01] among the nations, and you shall be left
[59:04] few in number among the heathen, whether
[59:08] the Lord shall lead you, and there you
[59:11] shall serve gods, the work of men's
[59:14] hands. There you'll prosper. There
[59:17] you'll be in business. There you'll
[59:18] become engaged. There you'll serve the
[59:21] gods of the heathen lands." He said,
[59:24] "You'll do that.
[59:26] and you'll serve the work of men's
[59:28] hands, wood and stone, which neither see
[59:31] nor hear nor eat nor smell. But if from
[59:35] thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God,
[59:39] thou shalt find him. If thou seek him
[59:43] with all thy heart, and with all thy
[59:45] soul, and when thou art in tribulation,
[59:49] all these things, and all these things
[59:53] are come upon thee, even in the latter
[59:56] days,
[59:58] if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and
[1:00:01] shall be obedient unto his voice. For
[1:00:04] the Lord thy God is merciful. He's a
[1:00:07] merciful God. and he will not forsake
[1:00:10] thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget
[1:00:13] the covenant of thy fathers, which he
[1:00:15] swore unto them.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; But he said, I will scatter you, and
[1:00:21] I'll scatter you among all the nations.
[1:00:23] When you forget God, and you forget his
[1:00:25] covenants, I'm going to scatter you, and
[1:00:28] you'll become few in number, and you'll
[1:00:31] serve the gods of the heathens." And
[1:00:33] that they did.
[1:00:38] The scattering amongst the nations was
[1:00:40] part of the desolation.
[1:00:44] You become desolate. It wasn't just
[1:00:47] wasn't just a besieging of the city of
[1:00:50] Jerusalem, but you become desolate.
[1:00:53] And desolate part of that is a very deep
[1:00:57] meaning.
[1:00:59] You'll be shocked before I'm done. Part
[1:01:02] of is it that you'll lose your land. And
[1:01:06] they did.
[1:01:08] Desolate is you lose your abode, your
[1:01:11] permanent place of residence, your home,
[1:01:15] your household.
[1:01:18] And no place is that more profoundly
[1:01:22] true than when you sit and stand in the
[1:01:27] ashes of Awitz where they lost their
[1:01:31] households,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; had lost their country, had lost their
[1:01:36] families, had lost these things. But
[1:01:38] that was just a consummation of it. when
[1:01:41] they had lost their land, they lost
[1:01:45] their flag, they lost their national
[1:01:48] identity. And in the scattering which
[1:01:51] was part of the desolation,
[1:01:53] you know,
[1:01:55] going to surprise you now,
[1:01:58] Satan,
[1:02:00] Satan was successful
[1:02:03] in making the desolation
[1:02:06] not only livable but actually
[1:02:09] pleasurable.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And there was a deception in the
[1:02:15] desolation.
[1:02:16] The desolation was of God and the
[1:02:19] deception was of Satan. And they began
[1:02:22] to feel this isn't so bad.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; We're accepted.
[1:02:30] We're we're living a fairly good life.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; We're, you know, we're part of society
[1:02:39] and we're establishing our families and
[1:02:42] we're all over the world now. We've been
[1:02:45] scattered all over the world, but hey,
[1:02:48] it's not too bad. Satan's Eden
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; made it comfortable.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And I thought of the same thing
[1:02:57] spiritually. I've seen people who've
[1:03:00] lost their inheritance in God.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; They lose their inheritance. They lose
[1:03:05] their land. They lose their home. They
[1:03:08] lose their family. They lose everything.
[1:03:10] But Satan makes it so comfortable
[1:03:13] and they're so uh uh you know the the
[1:03:19] the pleasures of the present life that
[1:03:23] we have,
[1:03:25] the entertainment and the things that
[1:03:28] fill up, you know, the vacancy, they
[1:03:32] they slip away. people even, you know,
[1:03:35] turn their back on the message, walk
[1:03:37] away from Christ, walk away from
[1:03:39] fellowship with God. And and and Satan
[1:03:42] will provide you with something.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He'll provide you with something. Take
[1:03:47] up. Let me give you a word of warning.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; There's a desolation. There's a
[1:03:53] consummation to the desolation. And it's
[1:03:56] going to be worse than Awitz.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; There's another Awitz coming much worse.
[1:04:03] And it's called a tribulation.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And it's not a sign to the believer. But
[1:04:10] I can tell you that a believer can't sit
[1:04:12] back on their laurels and just say,
[1:04:14] "Well, you know, I'm just riding along
[1:04:16] and I'm just going I I'm a just
[1:04:18] attending church and I'm just, you know,
[1:04:20] a member of a congregation." It's
[1:04:23] absolutely imperative that we have an
[1:04:26] individual walk and maintain a walk with
[1:04:29] Christ. Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; The scattering amongst the nation.
[1:04:36] And when Jesus said, "Your house is left
[1:04:39] to you desolate,
[1:04:44] your place of abode,
[1:04:47] and the fact that they were moved out of
[1:04:49] their land."
[1:04:51] And imagine this thing had been promised
[1:04:53] by God to them.
[1:04:56] And now
[1:04:59] uh they found themselves scattered
[1:05:02] throughout the entire earth.
[1:05:05] But it's it's it's a powerful thing.
[1:05:10] And you
[1:05:12] you've experienced you perhaps have
[1:05:15] those that you know and you know they're
[1:05:18] not walking in the light of this word
[1:05:19] anymore.
[1:05:21] They're carrying on in their world and
[1:05:24] they they have embraced worldly things
[1:05:28] and it's not bad. They're living the
[1:05:31] good life. So were the Jews.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; They were living the good life. The
[1:05:36] natural seed was living the good life.
[1:05:40] Jesus gave plenty of warning.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Don't fear him that can
[1:05:47] destroy the body."
[1:05:48] That's what happened in Awitz. But fear
[1:05:51] him who can destroy both body and soul.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus wouldn't have had to say that if
[1:05:57] there was no reason for saying it. There
[1:05:59] was a reason for saying it.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And I am I am really troubled. I'm
[1:06:06] troubled that people can uh claim I've
[1:06:10] seen people live a life that's actually
[1:06:12] disgraceful to the message and say,
[1:06:14] "Well, you believe in prophet." Oh,
[1:06:16] absolutely. I believe brother Brad's a
[1:06:18] prophet of God
[1:06:20] and live that kind of a life. Excuse me.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Uh something isn't something's not
[1:06:29] matching here. Something's not coming
[1:06:31] together. I believe that a real believer
[1:06:34] is a believer.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; A real believer is a believer.
[1:06:43] and you know well yourself our
[1:06:45] inheritance in Christ which is our life
[1:06:48] in the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:50] Don't let Satan tell you a lie that
[1:06:54] everything's just a-ok okay and you you
[1:06:58] you're not living in your inheritance.
[1:07:01] You don't have your inheritance. You
[1:07:02] haven't possessed your inheritance.
[1:07:05] That isn't what God had planned for you.
[1:07:07] Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Now what I'd like to do at this point
[1:07:14] because I wanted just to introduce
[1:07:18] uh your house is left you dazzle and
[1:07:22] then I would like to show this video now
[1:07:26] and uh
[1:07:28] and then I I want you to keep that theme
[1:07:31] as we go through it. So part of it is,
[1:07:34] you know, informative, part of it is
[1:07:36] what we saw,
[1:07:38] but uh there is a number of things I'd
[1:07:42] like you to observe that are symbol
[1:07:46] symbolic. It's it was it was a whole
[1:07:49] event of a great deal of symbolism.
[1:07:52] One of them you'll see lights coming
[1:07:55] like search lights coming from different
[1:07:57] directions and they all end at one
[1:07:59] brilliant light in the sky. It's
[1:08:02] symbolizing that even everything that
[1:08:04] took place there and the atrocities
[1:08:06] against the Jewish people could not
[1:08:10] could not put out the light.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; And then there are towers. You'll see
[1:08:17] towers and there are blocks of burning
[1:08:19] embers in these towers. The towers
[1:08:22] stretched across a large area of land.
[1:08:26] And uh and these blocks are in these
[1:08:28] towers every few feet and they burnt for
[1:08:32] hours and hours and hours and they of
[1:08:35] course symbolized the crematoriums which
[1:08:38] were there and what took place in that
[1:08:40] area. So now if we could just have the
[1:08:43] the video and just remain real prayerful
[1:08:47] if you would please. This is not uh a
[1:08:50] piece of entertainment. This is part of
[1:08:51] my part of my message.
[1:08:54] We'll need the lights down, please.
[1:09:06] Too bad. I'd like to seen it on the big
[1:09:08] screen.
[1:09:27] mightful.
[1:09:48] Yeah,
[1:10:15] you
[1:10:18] Saw
[1:10:49] stand.
[1:11:24] It must be a very special occasion to
[1:11:27] have a mother that was a survivor of the
[1:11:29] Holocaust.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; My dad's also a survivor.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Your dad also
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; My parents are both survivors. Um,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; what would you say in a in a a very
[1:11:36] brief statement how that's affected you
[1:11:38] and what a privilege it's been? I know
[1:11:40] that's somewhat of a stigma too, but
[1:11:42] what would you say?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Um, if anything, it's definitely not a
[1:11:45] stigma. It's a positive thing. I mean, I
[1:11:47] think a lot of second generation
[1:11:49] survivors, be it their parents or
[1:11:51] survivors have had problems throughout
[1:11:53] their life in Indiana. Um, I think if
[1:11:56] anything with my parents attitude,
[1:11:58] particularly my mother's, anything that
[1:12:00] I took from the Holocaust was all
[1:12:01] positive. And so, it's never been a
[1:12:04] hardship, it's never been a burden, it's
[1:12:05] always been a thriv
[1:12:08] can It's always I'm very proud of my
[1:12:12] parents.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Your mother seems to be a very unique
[1:12:19] and special person with a real drive.
[1:12:21] She knows what she wants to do and I see
[1:12:23] you're a part of that also in helping to
[1:12:25] pass on this torch.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; My mom's
[1:12:31] very
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; she knows what she likes and she also
[1:12:34] has a very strong spirit and probably
[1:12:42] The fact that they did it to the Jews,
[1:12:44] but not only the Jews, 10 million people
[1:12:46] were killed. 6 million Jews, 4 million
[1:12:49] Paul's Russians were Russian prisoners.
[1:12:52] So they did not go to they went to
[1:12:55] concentration camp. I was an
[1:12:57] interpreter.
[1:13:00] I spoke to German and I spoke Russian.
[1:13:03] That's how I survived.
[1:13:14] They keep moving.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. They had many marches of
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:20] one 900 900 people.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; If you couldn't walk
[1:13:29] under they shoot you and they wouldn't
[1:13:32] have time to bury it. But then the
[1:13:36] guards were disappear.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; So we arrived with our ship.
[1:14:02] He signed his
[1:14:05] I
[1:14:11] was
[1:14:14] no longer
[1:14:40] Holy
[1:14:50] Splat.
[1:16:21] My dear Brianna.
[1:16:48] He was practicing how to survive.
[1:16:52] because
[1:17:03] we're here on this special day part of a
[1:17:06] delegation of special invited guests to
[1:17:10] uh go and participate in several special
[1:17:14] functions that have been set up for this
[1:17:17] 60th anniversary commemoration. And so
[1:17:19] we're meeting And then we'll be going on
[1:17:22] to other locations, Jewish cemeteries,
[1:17:24] Jewish factories, factories, other
[1:17:28] places, special events that need to be
[1:17:32] commemorated.
[1:18:02] Hey,
[1:18:14] hey, hey.
[1:18:55] members of the British
[1:18:58] who died in the British war
[1:19:08] on the 20th of August 1944.
[1:19:12] We meet here to remember all those who
[1:19:15] died in the camp of
[1:19:18] and all those who survived
[1:19:21] name in body and mind in 1943.
[1:19:31] By the end of that year, 1200 British
[1:19:34] troops in
[1:19:37] overcrowded and primitive barracks.
[1:19:40] rations.
[1:19:45] However,
[1:20:13] So
[1:20:14] he
[1:20:29] Foreign
[1:20:43] speech. Foreign speech.
[1:21:11] Amen.
[1:21:34] Glory.
[1:21:48] This area that we see here
[1:21:52] going back to this building is an area
[1:21:56] where they offloaded
[1:21:58] uh much of the Jewish population from
[1:22:00] all of Europe.
[1:22:03] brought them into this area, had built
[1:22:05] this railway here and
[1:22:11] brought them in uh box cars uh exactly
[1:22:16] as we have here.
[1:22:18] Now, these are the
[1:22:20] railway cars that they loaded the Jews
[1:22:24] from all over Europe.
[1:22:26] Uh this car here will hold about a
[1:22:30] hundred people.
[1:22:33] And uh I understand that they journeyed
[1:22:36] sometimes from seven even as much as 10
[1:22:39] days. They came from as far north as
[1:22:41] Norway and all over Europe. They were
[1:22:44] gathered and then brought here to this
[1:22:48] assembly area. At this point the
[1:22:53] men were separated and they were taken
[1:22:57] off to my right to Awitz itself.
[1:23:02] Some of the weak and aged were actually
[1:23:07] taken in carts down this road
[1:23:10] and about 600 m off to my left is
[1:23:15] Burkano. The women were taken over
[1:23:17] there. Some that were able-bodied were
[1:23:19] able to walk
[1:23:22] and some that were selected for death
[1:23:25] were actually taken down this road
[1:23:28] another short distance. And so this was
[1:23:31] the area where they were selected some
[1:23:34] for work, the men this direction, the
[1:23:37] women off to Burkanau which we were we
[1:23:41] will be seeing uh shortly.
[1:23:45] One can only imagine the thoughts that
[1:23:48] must have gone through the minds of the
[1:23:50] people that were loaded into these cars.
[1:23:54] Railroad cars.
[1:23:58] Here we have a locking device that was
[1:24:01] brought down
[1:24:04] were in winter conditions. Often they
[1:24:06] were in winter conditions.
[1:24:09] Husbands had already been separated from
[1:24:11] wives,
[1:24:13] parents from children,
[1:24:15] and they were left into these horrible
[1:24:20] conditions,
[1:24:21] crammed into these cars and traveling
[1:24:24] for days without water and without food,
[1:24:28] just to
[1:24:30] be alone with their own thoughts,
[1:24:33] wondering what their future held for
[1:24:35] them.
[1:24:37] then brought into this area. There were
[1:24:40] ramps that were constructed so they
[1:24:44] could offload off of these cars. And
[1:24:47] here they were segregated and then sent
[1:24:50] to their various areas.
[1:24:56] This picture here depicts
[1:24:59] the Jews are being queued up for the G
[1:25:03] to go directly to the gas chambers
[1:25:06] on arrival in Awitz. Most Jews were sent
[1:25:10] by the SS for immediate death in the gas
[1:25:13] chambers. However, they were often
[1:25:16] forced to wait their turn in this clump
[1:25:18] of trees if the gas chambers were full
[1:25:23] at the time. We can see here many
[1:25:25] hundreds of people and they're all in
[1:25:27] this wooded area that is all just
[1:25:31] directly behind this monument.
[1:25:34] You can see children, small children,
[1:25:38] mothers and men, men and women
[1:25:42] lined up. And this photo was taken by
[1:25:44] the SS in 1944.
[1:26:32] These are the disinfecting
[1:26:35] ovens.
[1:26:36] I guess you would call them where the
[1:26:39] clothing of all the people all the
[1:26:42] Jewish people were stripped from them
[1:26:45] and put in these disinfecting bottles
[1:26:49] and every piece of clothing was sent
[1:26:52] back and then recycle for the war
[1:26:54] effort.
[1:27:13] Is this a school class? Looks like a
[1:27:16] class.
[1:27:18] This picture here is obviously
[1:27:20] family or relatives, but you'll see that
[1:27:24] the star indicates that they were in
[1:27:27] jail.
[1:27:29] We have another picture
[1:27:34] looks like a father and mother and
[1:27:36] daughter. And you see once again the
[1:27:39] star which indicates that this family
[1:27:42] was in a kiddo. Also
[1:27:50] that this was this monument was
[1:27:52] established here in 1967
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; 1967 and it was to symbolize the various
[1:28:02] uh tombs or cemeteries and the monuments
[1:28:06] in the cemeteries.
[1:28:08] So there are 21 plaques with 21
[1:28:11] languages of all the people
[1:28:14] and uh the various monument which was
[1:28:17] designed and established in
[1:28:18] commemoration of this site
[1:28:22] London. But in autumn 1942 famous
[1:28:27] messenger Polish
[1:28:29] home army and armed forces
[1:28:35] mess were
[1:28:38] artific
[1:29:01] women and children and then men. When
[1:29:03] such was by
[1:29:06] possible to crouch four, five, even
[1:29:08] sometimes 600 prisoners instead of 48
[1:29:11] horses. But what I said this building,
[1:29:14] this construction, these barracks were
[1:29:15] sent here from German already
[1:29:17] prefabricate.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; with with
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; So the timbers and everything were
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; just all cut and assembled in here.
[1:29:34] And
[1:29:36] people
[1:29:42] from 1943 they slept on three levels.
[1:29:46] I will show you later
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; in a room decides how many people would
[1:29:49] sleep in here.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; So this photo was taken several days
[1:29:56] before they were sent to the gas. Look
[1:29:58] on their faces. Look at this face. Look
[1:30:01] at his face. Look at his face. Can you
[1:30:04] find that they knew what was they do?
[1:30:07] What is the destination? Of course no.
[1:30:10] Because
[1:30:21] Saturday.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; So here are the suitcases and all of
[1:30:33] these people
[1:30:35] expected to take their belongings and go
[1:30:38] to a new location.
[1:30:42] born 1942.
[1:30:45] This boy was born March 1942.
[1:31:22] Hey, brother.
[1:31:35] Convention
[1:31:39] Europe.
[1:32:06] his home.
[1:32:09] He was 11 when the Nazis
[1:32:13] and they took him here to they were
[1:32:16] moving him to various other camps.
[1:32:31] He was only for he was for two years but
[1:32:33] generally he was in all of the camps. He
[1:32:36] was from 1941 till the end. So two years
[1:32:40] here and then he was just moved to other
[1:32:43] camps.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:32:55] Amen.
[1:33:25] other
[1:33:36] day.
[1:33:38] contain
[1:33:48] the name of my
[1:34:22] Excellencia
[1:34:46] Marshall, president.
[1:35:20] US,
[1:35:23] President
[1:36:48] How much?
[1:37:18] Jesus.
[1:38:23] your house is left here desolate.
[1:38:31] That's when they begin to realize
[1:38:34] this is very unique, friends. very
[1:38:36] unique
[1:38:39] and
[1:38:42] the greatest paradox that I have ever
[1:38:44] encountered in all my life.
[1:38:51] This was the
[1:38:54] final contraction
[1:38:56] for the birth of a nation.
[1:39:01] Prophet said that that second world war
[1:39:06] said when a birth is going to take place
[1:39:10] said the pain start getting closer and
[1:39:12] harder
[1:39:15] harder and harder.
[1:39:18] He said this one almost
[1:39:20] broke forth to a a new world and he said
[1:39:24] it won't it won't be able to handle
[1:39:25] another one.
[1:39:29] This was the final
[1:39:33] contraction
[1:39:38] that took place
[1:39:40] because now
[1:39:42] whatever people remained
[1:39:45] and we saw a few hundred of them. But
[1:39:48] can you imagine?
[1:39:51] Can you just try to imagine? You
[1:39:53] wouldn't want to face, you know,
[1:39:58] what you're looking at is just uh the
[1:40:02] shell of the evidence of a people that
[1:40:06] were smitten.
[1:40:09] The Bible speaks of Christ when he was
[1:40:12] smitten
[1:40:14] that we turn as it wear our faces from
[1:40:16] him because it was just too tragic
[1:40:21] to look upon.
[1:40:23] There's aspects of this, I said it
[1:40:26] before, but you probably couldn't really
[1:40:27] fully realize it. There's aspects of
[1:40:30] this that are just too difficult to look
[1:40:32] upon.
[1:40:37] and I don't feel would be appropriate in
[1:40:40] church,
[1:40:41] but you talk about smitten
[1:40:44] when you see
[1:40:46] uh piles of human bodies
[1:40:50] and they could not the crematoriums
[1:40:53] couldn't handle them
[1:40:56] sufficiently
[1:40:57] and other means were used to dispose of
[1:41:00] them. And now here's here is the real
[1:41:04] irony of this entire thing. More than
[1:41:07] one, but here's one.
[1:41:10] Hitler himself
[1:41:13] needed these trains. He needed these
[1:41:17] forces. He needed all these resources.
[1:41:21] He needed them desperately towards the
[1:41:24] end of the war. He needed them for his
[1:41:27] war effort. But it became evident and it
[1:41:30] has been said that he his desire to
[1:41:35] destroy the Jews was greater than his
[1:41:39] desire to win the war.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Now it lifts it out of and I want
[1:41:45] everybody to realize this is nothing to
[1:41:47] do with just a human war. This is a
[1:41:49] spiritual war.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing. Not just army
[1:41:54] against army or nation against nation.
[1:41:57] But this was something God spoke it. God
[1:42:01] raises up and allows people to do what
[1:42:06] they need to do, but it will all work
[1:42:09] towards
[1:42:11] God's purpose and his fulfillment.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; You can understand it. I can't
[1:42:17] understand it fully, but that is what
[1:42:20] took place.
[1:42:22] And the irony as I said was whatever was
[1:42:26] possessing him, whatever arc angel of a
[1:42:30] fallen angel, demon spirit that control
[1:42:36] the mind and control the minds of of
[1:42:39] others in leadership
[1:42:42] that they determined to destroy a whole
[1:42:46] nation because that's not the first time
[1:42:50] in Egypt. Slay all the children, the
[1:42:53] male children. But God preserved a
[1:42:56] deliverer.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was born, slay all the
[1:43:01] children,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; two years and under
[1:43:05] and there is a great wailing and a great
[1:43:07] cry. But yet that is what took place
[1:43:10] because there's a great conflict that's
[1:43:13] taking place. And friends, this isn't
[1:43:15] something that happened 60 years ago.
[1:43:17] Those same spirits, those same demons,
[1:43:20] they are in opposition to the life that
[1:43:23] you live and they hate,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; they hate this message
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; and they hate what you stand for. They
[1:43:30] hate holiness. They hate Christ. They
[1:43:33] hate our gospel. And and and the truth
[1:43:37] of the matter is that it's not really
[1:43:40] that widely known. But if what you
[1:43:42] believe was exposed and put out on the
[1:43:46] front of your your chest and you lived
[1:43:49] it, I tell you what, friends, you would
[1:43:52] not be a popular person in your
[1:43:54] community.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; The second irony of this
[1:44:02] is here
[1:44:03] here is uh
[1:44:06] I I I I'm saying this last birth pain.
[1:44:10] This was the last one.
[1:44:13] This birth pain which is bringing forth
[1:44:16] a nation and they they they walked out
[1:44:20] of their
[1:44:22] those that could walk
[1:44:24] making their way back to their homes
[1:44:29] and were rejected right in the homes.
[1:44:32] They couldn't even reclaim their own
[1:44:33] homes
[1:44:36] and they had no home.
[1:44:39] As I said two weeks ago,
[1:44:42] I pray God help me now.
[1:44:49] The real paradox
[1:44:52] is here stood
[1:44:55] the religious leaders
[1:44:58] for the Catholic church, the Orthodox
[1:45:01] church, and I believe they had a Jewish
[1:45:04] rabbi
[1:45:07] and read a letter from the pope
[1:45:11] standing on the ashes of the Jewish
[1:45:15] people
[1:45:18] and with many the blood of the saints
[1:45:23] and the martyrs
[1:45:25] and those that have been destroyed
[1:45:28] under their skirts.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Millions more than six.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Millions more.
[1:45:38] And now the only religious really the
[1:45:42] only religious
[1:45:44] uh
[1:45:46] leaders that were identified were those
[1:45:49] that are responsible for many more and
[1:45:53] they're standing right there. To me it
[1:45:55] was the epitome of of hypocrisy.
[1:46:01] And I stood there and God had already
[1:46:04] talked to my own heart before I arrived
[1:46:08] when I was still in the hotel and going
[1:46:10] there.
[1:46:11] And I thought
[1:46:14] this is the convulsion of the birth
[1:46:16] pain. This is a contraction. This is
[1:46:18] this is what issued this nation forth.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; They had no place to go. So they went
[1:46:24] back and the very nations that are
[1:46:27] represented here resisted them from
[1:46:30] going back to their own home.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; So it goes to show that the that the
[1:46:37] world and the governments of the world
[1:46:39] and the nations of the world are not
[1:46:42] controlled by when I say not controlled
[1:46:46] by the author of this book.
[1:46:50] Otherwise, they would they would want to
[1:46:53] right away
[1:46:54] uh be in in accordance with the promises
[1:46:59] of this book. Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; So they went back
[1:47:04] and trying to find a homeland
[1:47:07] and uh
[1:47:10] what was represented
[1:47:13] there at the at the podium
[1:47:18] was those that have resisted the people
[1:47:21] from from becoming a nation. And
[1:47:24] furthermore, the Bible speaks of
[1:47:28] the Bible speaks a very very unusual
[1:47:31] word
[1:47:33] and it says that in Noah's day that the
[1:47:35] earth was filled with violence.
[1:47:38] But that word violence and this will be
[1:47:42] a complete twist for you. That word
[1:47:44] violence has reference in the scriptures
[1:47:48] to the leaders, spiritual leaders taking
[1:47:52] the word from the people.
[1:47:56] And now we have the very personification
[1:48:01] of those that and the very early stages
[1:48:04] of Christianity,
[1:48:06] the one who claims originality as the
[1:48:09] original church. what they were original
[1:48:11] about is taking the word from the people
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; and they were the ones standing there
[1:48:19] and I thought this if if this isn't
[1:48:21] ironic that the people those who
[1:48:25] represent the leadership of the Vatican
[1:48:28] and the pope and so on who have taken
[1:48:31] the word from the people and in God's in
[1:48:35] God's mind that is a violent act and
[1:48:38] holding it from the people.
[1:48:44] We look at something like this and you
[1:48:47] don't only see but a small part of it.
[1:48:50] It's somber.
[1:48:52] It's a solemn thing.
[1:48:56] But it's only a foretaste. That was just
[1:48:59] one nation. Let me tell you something,
[1:49:01] friends, and I say it again. You talk
[1:49:05] about a holocaust
[1:49:08] and we need to say it. We need to preach
[1:49:10] it. We need to talk about it. We talk
[1:49:13] about us as believers, but we're not
[1:49:15] going to be there. That's that's
[1:49:18] excellent. But Jesus, he preached a a a
[1:49:22] gospel of warning. And we need to preach
[1:49:25] a gospel of warning. It keeps us snugged
[1:49:27] up where we ought to be.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know what holocaust means?
[1:49:35] I'm sure most don't.
[1:49:38] Holocaust
[1:49:39] is a holy burnt sacrifice.
[1:49:45] That's what was taking place.
[1:49:49] A holy completely burnt sacrifice
[1:49:55] holocaust.
[1:49:56] The only thing is with that one, it
[1:50:00] drove a people back to establish a
[1:50:03] nation. And there's going to be there's
[1:50:06] going to be 144,000. How many others
[1:50:08] there are, that's only that's up to God.
[1:50:10] We know nothing about it. But there's
[1:50:13] 144,000
[1:50:15] that God has God has reserved to
[1:50:18] himself. And Elijah when he was here,
[1:50:22] the Bible says that he inter that he he
[1:50:26] in his prayer to God that he said
[1:50:31] uh they have
[1:50:34] in fact is
[1:50:36] says uh
[1:50:39] in his intercession to God against
[1:50:41] Israel. Here's Elijah says,"Lord, they
[1:50:45] have killed thy prophets and digged down
[1:50:47] thine altars, and I'm left alone." This
[1:50:51] is exactly what he thought. "I am left
[1:50:53] alone, and they seek my life. But what
[1:50:57] saith the answer of God to him? I've
[1:50:58] reserved 7,000 that have refused to bow
[1:51:02] their knee to bail."
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Elijah didn't realize it. He thought he
[1:51:07] was the last one that was left alone.
[1:51:10] But God had reserved a uh a group for
[1:51:13] himself. And God has in this time also
[1:51:16] reserved a group. I feel that we have
[1:51:20] some
[1:51:22] responsibility. I don't know. I can't
[1:51:25] tell you all the people we met. uh we
[1:51:29] met a a multitude of people and because
[1:51:33] we were with the Israel delegation as I
[1:51:35] said on the Wednesday night
[1:51:38] uh because we were with them we were
[1:51:41] just circulating and that is the contact
[1:51:43] that we had and and I feel that
[1:51:48] there's one the very least that we will
[1:51:51] do as a congregation
[1:51:54] is that
[1:51:56] we will expose them to a message into a
[1:52:00] life that they have not seen before. And
[1:52:04] there was once again an immediate
[1:52:08] affinity
[1:52:09] with those Jewish leaders and what they
[1:52:13] saw within ourselves and they wanted us
[1:52:15] to be with them. Uh, I was just standing
[1:52:19] as like an observer right at the inner
[1:52:22] circle when they were, you know, saying
[1:52:24] their prayer and and singing their psalm
[1:52:27] at the cemetery there. And that Jewish
[1:52:31] man, he wouldn't let me stand there. He
[1:52:33] just took a hold of me and pulled me
[1:52:35] right into the circle with they were
[1:52:37] going to take pictures because there was
[1:52:40] that feeling, there was that impulse
[1:52:42] that you're you're one of us. And it it
[1:52:44] was it's surprising because they weren't
[1:52:46] pulling any other people in. It was all
[1:52:48] crowded around, but they weren't pulling
[1:52:50] any other people in, but they pulled in,
[1:52:53] you know, those of us that were
[1:52:55] believers. They they wanted to be
[1:52:57] identified or they wanted us identified
[1:52:59] with them. And there's a witness in my
[1:53:01] heart that the very least that we're
[1:53:02] going to do. You know what, friends?
[1:53:05] A prophet screamed out long ago that God
[1:53:07] has turned to the Jews.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; God is done with the Gentiles. I tell
[1:53:13] you right now, and I'm not a pessimist,
[1:53:16] but I don't see very much to save in our
[1:53:20] nation.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; I don't see very much to save in this in
[1:53:25] this world right now. You talk, you talk
[1:53:29] about desolation.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Now, let me be very blunt.
[1:53:35] Our nation,
[1:53:37] our churches, and yes, even within the
[1:53:40] message is filled with all kinds of
[1:53:43] iniquitous things.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; You know it, you might as well admit it.
[1:53:49] And as far as God having something to
[1:53:52] save, there's not much to save. The
[1:53:55] nation's adulterous.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; They glorify
[1:54:00] glorify and glamorize. It's a godless
[1:54:03] godless nation.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Absolutely go God godless.
[1:54:09] If God's if God's not the laws of the
[1:54:12] Old Testament, if the justice of a holy
[1:54:16] God was brought down to bear, there'd be
[1:54:19] very few people alive
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; in North America.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Very few would be alive.
[1:54:30] And the prophet said, "The only thing
[1:54:32] that stands between a righteous God and
[1:54:36] the people is a bumper called the
[1:54:39] blood."
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; And the blood is represented. You cannot
[1:54:46] you cannot change the uh identification
[1:54:49] between the blood and the word. It's a
[1:54:51] bleeding word.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the word and that's what they
[1:54:55] were after.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't him as a person. He was
[1:54:58] popular as a young prophet from
[1:55:01] Nazareth, but as of what he spoke and
[1:55:04] Jesus said this. He said, "The world
[1:55:07] doesn't hate you, but they hate me."
[1:55:12] Now, he's talking to his disciples. He
[1:55:14] says, "They don't hate you, but they
[1:55:16] hate me." And he says, "They hate me
[1:55:19] because I testify that their deeds are
[1:55:23] evil."
[1:55:24] And when it comes to that, you know, we
[1:55:27] can work and have our jobs and, you
[1:55:29] know, witness here and witness there and
[1:55:31] so on so forth. But when it finally
[1:55:33] comes to a place, and I'm sure that at
[1:55:36] some point in time, and maybe sooner
[1:55:38] than later, we'll be confronted with it.
[1:55:41] Is this what you believe? Is this what
[1:55:43] you're teaching? Oh, here goes your
[1:55:45] charitable here. Here goes your
[1:55:47] charitable tax. Uh, you can't issue
[1:55:50] charitable taxes. We won't recognize you
[1:55:52] as a charitable organization anymore.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Then are we going to tithe?
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Then are we still going to give?
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, is this what you believe? If you
[1:56:10] believe that,
[1:56:12] you don't have your job anymore. You
[1:56:14] can't believe that and have your job.
[1:56:17] I tell you what, we're going to have to
[1:56:18] believe in a God that can send mana from
[1:56:20] heaven.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to believe in a God
[1:56:23] that do the supernatural and does the
[1:56:25] supernatural.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And you talk about a squeeze. The
[1:56:29] prophet talked about a squeeze, but I
[1:56:31] can actually see the thing in the making
[1:56:34] anymore. And you know, we talked about
[1:56:38] building another church. We may need
[1:56:39] another church when we may not need
[1:56:42] another church. Might be a whole smaller
[1:56:44] crowd.
[1:56:46] than we even imagined.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; When that time comes, do you think it's
[1:56:51] far away, Brother Ed? I don't think it's
[1:56:53] very far away. I don't think it can. It
[1:56:55] can happen so quickly. And I got
[1:56:57] thinking and here here's the
[1:56:58] realization. We're talking about the
[1:57:00] Jews. These were just this was the
[1:57:02] natural lineage of Abraham. And now we
[1:57:06] sit here and if I asked you
[1:57:07] individually, do you believe you're of
[1:57:08] the spiritual lineage of the royal seed
[1:57:12] of Abraham? You'd say, yes, I do. Yes,
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; they had an ordinary life. They were
[1:57:17] working. They were in business. They
[1:57:19] were just doing things. The kids were
[1:57:20] going to school. They were going to
[1:57:21] college. They were they had their
[1:57:23] ordinary life. Everything was going
[1:57:24] along fine till knock came in the door
[1:57:26] one day.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; They just had the wrong identification.
[1:57:30] Say, "We put a star on you, buddy.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; And you're and and they constantly
[1:57:35] thought they were like sheep." And they
[1:57:38] say it themselves, the Jewish people,
[1:57:41] like sheep going to a slaughter. And
[1:57:44] they always thought, you know, you saw
[1:57:45] that I was going to make some comments,
[1:57:47] but I thought better not let's leave it
[1:57:48] silent. You saw a great big room. It was
[1:57:51] full of pots and pans of every kind and
[1:57:54] description and it's all the suitcases
[1:57:56] because the people they expected to set
[1:57:59] up housekeeping
[1:58:01] and when and and the and the curator of
[1:58:03] the museum was saying, "Look at their
[1:58:05] faces. They're just they're just
[1:58:06] wondering what's next." You know, where
[1:58:08] do we go now?
[1:58:10] the the they they just had a knock on
[1:58:12] the door one day and they were as normal
[1:58:14] as you are right now. Their home was
[1:58:17] just as normal as your home is that
[1:58:19] you'd left this morning and closed the
[1:58:21] door. Just as normal as that. And one
[1:58:24] day uh the knock came on the door and
[1:58:27] just said you have to move out of here.
[1:58:29] So they took their belongings and things
[1:58:32] and well, you know, there's a war on and
[1:58:34] everything else and we're going to be
[1:58:36] displaced. We got to we got to go
[1:58:38] someplace. and they were assembled in
[1:58:40] certain places. You got to be left here
[1:58:43] and now this kind of pressure and that
[1:58:45] kind of pressure and so on. Regulations
[1:58:48] and more regulations and more. It's all
[1:58:50] called all government
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; and you just have to roll with it.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of regulations and
[1:58:56] restrictions and security and whatever
[1:58:58] more. They just go with it. Now you got
[1:59:00] to be moved and you got to go in this
[1:59:02] cattle car or you got to go in this
[1:59:04] train car and and you're being just when
[1:59:06] they arrived there, they thought they
[1:59:07] were going to set up housekeeping.
[1:59:10] That's why they had the pots and pans.
[1:59:12] That's why they had their suitcases and
[1:59:14] carried whatever they could because they
[1:59:16] fully expected that, you know, we we're
[1:59:18] we're going to the the the women and the
[1:59:20] mothers thought we're going to have to
[1:59:21] start cooking for our family again.
[1:59:27] That was their full expectation
[1:59:30] and it just tightened down and tightened
[1:59:32] down because the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:35] Christ, the words of the prophet Moses,
[1:59:38] I'm going to scatter you. The words of
[1:59:40] the prophet Hosea, you'll be torn.
[1:59:43] You'll be smitten.
[1:59:46] But he who tore can heal,
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; and he who smites can raise back up
[1:59:51] again.
[1:59:52] and uh and and Apostle Paul, the Apostle
[1:59:56] Paul, he said, "Can I just have a few
[1:59:57] more minutes? I I had wanted to actually
[2:00:00] get into preaching even more than I did,
[2:00:02] but the the
[2:00:05] I I thought that you needed to see the
[2:00:07] video." He said, he says, "Hath God cast
[2:00:10] away his people?" He says he said that
[2:00:13] there was an election. He said, "The
[2:00:15] election hath obtained and the rest were
[2:00:18] blinded." This is the blindness. They
[2:00:22] were blinded. They were dispersed, but
[2:00:26] everything seemed quite normal. And we
[2:00:30] happen to be in that time. But as far as
[2:00:33] God is concerned, as far as God's word
[2:00:36] is concerned, listen friends, there's
[2:00:38] only there's only one way out of
[2:00:43] the situation that we're in right now.
[2:00:46] There isn't a whole lot of ways. There's
[2:00:48] only one way that that for deliverance
[2:00:52] out of out of this generation that we're
[2:00:54] in. And as far as I know, the gospel,
[2:00:58] the message of the hour is the only way
[2:01:00] out of it. I see I see Pentecost. I see
[2:01:03] every organization and they go down. You
[2:01:07] talk about desolation. They go the way
[2:01:09] of the world. They go right into the
[2:01:12] depths of it. And still it's okay. You
[2:01:14] know, we still have our restaurant. we
[2:01:17] still have our, you know, our our our
[2:01:19] our coffee shops and and life still goes
[2:01:21] on. The kids are still in school and
[2:01:23] we're getting our education and and
[2:01:25] we've got our job and we're paying our
[2:01:26] bills and we got our car and everything
[2:01:28] else. But as far as God is concerned,
[2:01:30] it's a total desolation. And you talk
[2:01:33] about a desolation. I think it's a
[2:01:35] dreadful desolation when people lose
[2:01:37] their inheritance, lose their position,
[2:01:40] lose their identity as as a believer and
[2:01:43] still think everything's fine.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Everything's fine. You You know what's
[2:01:47] happened is Satan has brought in what I
[2:01:50] call the personification of deception.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; When people are in the midst of
[2:01:56] desolation and still believe that
[2:01:58] everything's fine,
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; actually believe I'm still a Christian.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; I'm still born again.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's the ultimate deception.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Deception by in in in the midst of
[2:02:11] desolation. Absolutely desolate. Nothing
[2:02:14] inside. no victory, no power, no word,
[2:02:18] no revelation, no light upon their soul.
[2:02:21] I'm still uh you know mentally uh you
[2:02:24] know uh I I believe the message, I
[2:02:26] believe the prophet, etc., etc. I I
[2:02:28] believe the word of God. I'm still a
[2:02:29] Christian and so on so forth.
[2:02:32] That needs to be
[2:02:35] needs to be blasted out. Needs to be
[2:02:37] cried out. Are they good people? There's
[2:02:41] a lot of good people, a lot of nice
[2:02:43] people. And I tell you what, friends, in
[2:02:46] all honesty, a lot of good people going
[2:02:48] to hell.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; A lot of good people going to hell. A
[2:02:53] lot of sincere people going to hell.
[2:02:58] Absolutely.
[2:03:00] And I think this is a real solemn
[2:03:02] warning for us at this time because this
[2:03:05] people now
[2:03:07] I said they lost their flag, they lost
[2:03:09] their money, they lost their land, they
[2:03:11] lost their identity, they lost their
[2:03:12] army, they lost their they lost their
[2:03:16] identification in the world community as
[2:03:18] being as being even a recognizable
[2:03:21] nation. They're just a scattered people
[2:03:24] according to the word of God. Utterly
[2:03:26] scattered throughout all the earth. And
[2:03:29] that was part of the desolation
[2:03:32] being made absolutely desolate. And how
[2:03:35] can you lose all that and still be and
[2:03:37] people today I see them lose their
[2:03:39] family,
[2:03:42] lose it to the world,
[2:03:45] lose their own life, become enslaved to
[2:03:47] the world,
[2:03:50] partake of of the dregs of the world.
[2:03:53] Still okay. I tell you what, not okay.
[2:03:58] deceived
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; deceived.
[2:04:02] Don't let Satan
[2:04:05] just deceive you. Don't allow him that.
[2:04:09] I tell you, if there ever was a time
[2:04:12] that we need to stand up and be
[2:04:13] identified and declare and stand for
[2:04:16] every word that God even tingles in your
[2:04:19] heart as truth, it is today.
[2:04:35] I'm closing in just a few moments.
[2:04:43] He said the world
[2:04:46] has to give way to it to the birth of a
[2:04:49] new world.
[2:04:52] And he said, "Brother Brandon was
[2:04:54] talking in 1965
[2:04:58] in Phoenix, and he said, "Let's examine
[2:05:00] some of the birth pains we're having on
[2:05:03] the earth."
[2:05:06] Let's see some of the birth pains we're
[2:05:08] having on the earth. And then we'll see
[2:05:11] about what day and just about how far
[2:05:14] she is along in her labor. And the first
[2:05:18] birth pain, he said, "We have the first
[2:05:20] world war, a great birth pain." And it
[2:05:24] shows one of the first birth painans of
[2:05:27] her going into labor because of that.
[2:05:30] Think of it, friends. You would never
[2:05:33] know. You would never have this key if a
[2:05:35] prophet had not given that key to the
[2:05:38] bride. You wouldn't know. Hasn't been
[2:05:40] anybody. You've never ever heard it
[2:05:42] identified as a birth pain. And he now
[2:05:45] comes with such insight to make a people
[2:05:48] ready. When that first war broke on and
[2:05:52] and gas was spewed and death came and
[2:05:55] nations were involved, we thought it was
[2:05:58] just nation against nation. Here comes
[2:06:00] Elijah crying out. It's a birth pain.
[2:06:03] The whole earth is coming into a birth
[2:06:05] pain. And he and he said that she
[2:06:08] brought forth bombs and we had machine
[2:06:11] guns and poisonous gas. He said now he
[2:06:16] said now she knows that her time of
[2:06:18] deliverance is at hand
[2:06:22] and there's a reason she's so nervous
[2:06:24] and frustrated. She is because there is
[2:06:27] a hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air.
[2:06:31] Let me let me just say something
[2:06:33] friends. You can you can ask me to
[2:06:35] resign if you want after this service,
[2:06:37] but I tell you, we talk about a we talk
[2:06:40] about a a Mussolini, a Hitler, a Stalin
[2:06:43] being a mad man.
[2:06:47] We're not rid of them all yet.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You can be well sure there's another one
[2:06:52] around the corner. Amen.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; You can be well sure that those things
[2:06:59] those things that have been prepared and
[2:07:01] these these instruments of war that have
[2:07:04] been prepared, you can you just want to
[2:07:07] go out of this building today with a
[2:07:10] full knowledge. This world isn't done
[2:07:13] producing
[2:07:14] some vessel for some hierarchy of some
[2:07:18] demon force. And the thing that they
[2:07:21] hate more than anything is what you
[2:07:23] stand for.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; They hate this gospel.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely they do.
[2:07:35] And he says she knows her deliverance is
[2:07:37] at hand.
[2:07:40] He said there are missiles
[2:07:43] of the air that can destroy the whole
[2:07:45] world and one nation
[2:07:49] scare the other no matter listen to this
[2:07:52] way back then when there was just some
[2:07:55] superpowers said no matter how little it
[2:07:58] is. And right now the concern of the
[2:08:02] great powers is the little nations that
[2:08:05] get a hold of this power and nuclear
[2:08:08] power don't know how to handle it. I'm
[2:08:11] not preaching fear to you friends. I'm
[2:08:13] letting you know. You want to know that
[2:08:15] your anchor is holding. You want to know
[2:08:17] that you have cast your anchor and that
[2:08:20] your feet are upon the solid rock, Jesus
[2:08:22] Christ, and nothing else. And don't let
[2:08:24] these things in this world move you.
[2:08:28] They're not worth it.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[2:08:47] Abraham looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:08:52] and toward the land of the plain.
[2:08:55] And behold, and lo, a smoke of the
[2:09:00] country went up as the smoke of a
[2:09:05] furnace.
[2:09:08] That was the first one.
[2:09:13] God destroyed it by fire.
[2:09:17] Brother Brandham says
[2:09:22] they failed to see
[2:09:24] the judgments of God hanging in the sky.
[2:09:30] It was water one time. They made fun of
[2:09:33] Noah.
[2:09:35] Well, this will never happen. But it
[2:09:37] did.
[2:09:39] It did happen.
[2:09:42] And it won't be water this time. There
[2:09:43] will be fire and judgment. The judgment
[2:09:47] of God hangs on this earth. And the
[2:09:50] scripture says
[2:09:52] that that the very elements will melt
[2:09:58] with fervent heat. And the Bible says
[2:10:01] the heavens will be on fire.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; And a prophet says God is going to purge
[2:10:09] this world. So, a bride will walk out on
[2:10:12] the what?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Ashes. Say it again.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Ashes.
[2:10:19] God's going to destroy it. God's going
[2:10:21] to purge it. God's going to purify it.
[2:10:24] How? I do not know. But I can tell you
[2:10:27] that humans, men like you and I,
[2:10:33] there's sufficient power. There's
[2:10:35] sufficient nuclear power right now on
[2:10:38] the earth to destroy all of mankind.
[2:10:42] God doesn't have to do it. Man could do
[2:10:44] it himself.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; It's already there. It already lays
[2:10:47] there. It's absolutely you. You look at
[2:10:49] something like this or you went to
[2:10:51] Awitz. I just want to say to you, I'll
[2:10:53] switch it just kindergarten stuff.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; It's just kindergarten stuff to what's
[2:10:59] in the oceans,
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; what's in our submarines, what's in the
[2:11:04] silos, what's hanging in the aircraft,
[2:11:07] in the airplanes, what's flying above
[2:11:09] our head right now.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; What has already been programmed,
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; the cities that have already been
[2:11:16] identified. I can assure you Seattle's
[2:11:19] been identified. I can assure you
[2:11:22] they're uh they they haven't missed that
[2:11:24] Boeing plant. I can assure you they
[2:11:27] haven't missed the Poseidon missile base
[2:11:29] down in Tacoma. I can assure you they
[2:11:31] haven't missed Vancouver as one of their
[2:11:33] targets. I can assure you that's on
[2:11:36] their screen already someplace. I can
[2:11:39] assure you that's absolutely correct.
[2:11:43] And I can assure you the last madman
[2:11:46] hasn't come across the face of the earth
[2:11:48] yet. You want to know that your anchor
[2:11:51] holds. You want to know that you're
[2:11:53] standing on a solid rock. You want to
[2:11:56] know there isn't a question left in your
[2:11:58] mind that your heart and soul is right
[2:12:01] with God.
[2:12:09] But the heavens
[2:12:11] and the earth which are now by the same
[2:12:16] word,
[2:12:17] the same word that said your house,
[2:12:21] talking to a people, your house has left
[2:12:23] you desolate.
[2:12:28] They went to work the next day like
[2:12:30] you're going to.
[2:12:33] They went to the temple. They went to
[2:12:34] the synagogue. They said, "Nothing's
[2:12:37] changed." That fanatic down there,
[2:12:41] that fanatic and that little group of
[2:12:42] people yelling that our house is left to
[2:12:45] us desolate,
[2:12:49] that if we don't receive this that he's
[2:12:51] talking about
[2:12:55] that we're in trouble, a judgment's
[2:12:57] going to come. Ah, brother Brandham said
[2:13:00] they said to Noah, they said in Sodom's
[2:13:02] time, no, I don't believe that stuff.
[2:13:06] We don't believe that.
[2:13:09] But it came
[2:13:11] every time it came. And I don't care
[2:13:13] whether it's 70 years or 700 years. It
[2:13:16] doesn't make any difference. You're not
[2:13:17] going to live that long anyway.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Even if you live out your full natural
[2:13:21] life and when you come to the end of the
[2:13:23] road, you want to know you're ready to
[2:13:25] cross Jordan.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I want to know that. myself. I tell you
[2:13:29] what, friends, I've done some deep deep
[2:13:32] considering and thinking in the last
[2:13:35] last few years. I've really done some
[2:13:39] deep thinking. I want to make absolutely
[2:13:41] sure that everything is not only
[2:13:45] everything is right, but that I I want
[2:13:48] to know him and whom I have believed
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; and and though he's revealed himself, I
[2:13:53] don't want to just be satisfied with
[2:13:55] something that's superficial.
[2:13:58] And some of you that are sitting here up
[2:14:00] and down and in and out,
[2:14:03] that's not permitted to a real believer.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; You get on your road and stay on the
[2:14:09] road. You don't turn to the right. You
[2:14:11] don't turn to the left. There's
[2:14:13] absolutely no excuse.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; No excuse.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that is a hard gospel."
[2:14:21] Well, I'll tell you what. We need to
[2:14:23] have it preached hard and straight right
[2:14:26] from the shoulder.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; It's not a soft glove. It's not a kid
[2:14:29] glove. It's not to be pussy-footing
[2:14:32] around. It's time for us to really light
[2:14:35] up with the word of God and not not with
[2:14:38] the preaching so much as what God has
[2:14:40] witnessed in your own heart.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Just listen to your own heart. Listen to
[2:14:44] your own heart. Listen to the witness
[2:14:46] inside
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and it'll lead you right. The Holy
[2:14:50] Spirit will lead you right.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the earth and the
[2:14:54] heavens, as I close now, by the same
[2:14:57] word are kept in store.
[2:15:02] Everything you see around,
[2:15:04] if this little preacher's voice of
[2:15:06] silence this afternoon, don't let this
[2:15:08] ever escape your ears and your heart.
[2:15:12] This earth that is now, this world that
[2:15:16] is now is being held by the same word
[2:15:19] that was spoken, held in store, reserved
[2:15:23] under fire
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; against the judgment and predition of
[2:15:30] ungodly men.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And church is on every corner. Oh my
[2:15:37] God, what a burden is it burning in my
[2:15:39] soul. churches on every corner
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; and refuse to preach the truth of God's
[2:15:47] word even when they know it.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That's the
[2:15:51] violence.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Violently have taken the truth from the
[2:15:56] word of God. And the earth was filled
[2:15:58] with violence.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; The violence is coming from the pulpit.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; They refuse to tell the people the
[2:16:07] truth.
[2:16:09] and her young people. And you know what
[2:16:11] a prophet says? You know what a prophet
[2:16:13] says? He describes Awitz
[2:16:16] perfectly. He describes those pictures I
[2:16:19] stood in front of perfectly. Only he was
[2:16:22] talking about nice people. He's talking
[2:16:24] about uh full gospel people talking
[2:16:27] about Pentecostal and tonguespeaking
[2:16:30] people rejecting the word of God.
[2:16:33] Refusing they say the name of Jesus
[2:16:36] Christ. We love Jesus, but refusing his
[2:16:38] name to go to the water and be baptized
[2:16:41] and buried in his death in his name.
[2:16:44] Refusing it and still expecting to be
[2:16:47] welcomed at the gates.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? It's violence.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; The earth was filled with violence.
[2:16:58] Voices. multitudes of voices deceiving
[2:17:01] the people, making them making them to
[2:17:05] feel all right. You're all right. And
[2:17:08] pumping them up and entertaining them
[2:17:11] and putting them into a spirit into
[2:17:12] emotional realm and tears can flow from
[2:17:15] their eyes and they can feel rejoicing
[2:17:17] and so on and yet be deceived.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; And here's what a prophet said. They're
[2:17:24] going to a slaughter.
[2:17:29] You know what? He ties it to this great
[2:17:32] ecumenical
[2:17:34] this great ecumenical movement. All a
[2:17:36] gathering of the churches said was for a
[2:17:41] purpose and that purpose was a
[2:17:43] slaughter.
[2:17:45] Now friends,
[2:17:47] you can't see that with the eyes that
[2:17:50] you have here and you can't even perhaps
[2:17:53] feel that. Perhaps there's a some kind
[2:17:55] of a an awareness that has come as a
[2:17:58] result of the service this morning. Very
[2:18:00] strange service.
[2:18:02] But through the eyes of the word of God
[2:18:06] and through the eyes of the message,
[2:18:09] through the eyes of the word, I tell you
[2:18:12] what, friends, this world
[2:18:16] is under the judgments of almighty
[2:18:20] God. It isn't judgment has to come. It's
[2:18:22] already on it. It's we're all already
[2:18:24] under the judgment of God. And don't
[2:18:27] don't whatever you do put any trust or
[2:18:30] confidence in the things that are around
[2:18:32] you because they are passing away. This
[2:18:35] world as it is now is held and reserved
[2:18:39] against the fire of God and the
[2:18:42] judgments wherein the heavens will be on
[2:18:45] fire. And let me tell you something,
[2:18:48] there's a lot of people that have called
[2:18:49] on God. I'm going to call on him on the
[2:18:52] last minute. I say to you, you won't be
[2:18:54] heard.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; You might say, I have no right to say
[2:18:57] that. I'm saying it to you as a warning.
[2:18:59] That's my belief.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; I do not believe. I do not believe. I'm
[2:19:04] happy if a person could in their last
[2:19:06] moment make a declaration of Christ.
[2:19:09] That's fine. That's between them. And
[2:19:11] but that's not what that's not what the
[2:19:13] Bible teaches. The Bible teaches when
[2:19:15] you hear it, that's when you receive it.
[2:19:17] When you hear the warning, that's when
[2:19:19] you respond. And God is pleased with a
[2:19:22] quick response.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Looking for and hastening unto the
[2:19:30] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[2:19:33] heavens being on fire shall be
[2:19:36] dissolved, and the elements shall melt
[2:19:41] with fervent heat.
[2:19:45] And that's what's going to take place.
[2:19:48] I could take a whole new direction which
[2:19:50] I won't even bother now.
[2:19:55] But because it it's a an appropriate
[2:19:57] moment,
[2:19:58] the last thing that we're closing and
[2:20:01] getting ready to leave
[2:20:04] and we see what the world the world
[2:20:08] body, the world community had up there
[2:20:12] as the religious to identify the
[2:20:16] religious sector of the world
[2:20:21] was what this word says
[2:20:24] is the synagogue of Satan.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; And the synagogue of Satan, Brother
[2:20:32] Ernie, the representatives
[2:20:34] and the Holy Spirit in my own heart even
[2:20:36] before I got there says this is
[2:20:41] this represents the last contraction
[2:20:45] that brought a nation to birth. And the
[2:20:48] one that is there, the one that is there
[2:20:51] representing the religious order of the
[2:20:54] Vatican are responsible for more
[2:20:57] millions than they're standing upon.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; At that very sight and it's under their
[2:21:03] skirts, the blood of the the blood of
[2:21:06] the saints and the blood of the martyrs.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, listen closely. My last
[2:21:12] statement
[2:21:15] says the very office
[2:21:17] of the antichrist
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; is being is being received. The very
[2:21:24] office of the antichrist and the leaders
[2:21:27] of the world. I tell you what, friends,
[2:21:30] it's already gone.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; It's already signed, sealed, and
[2:21:34] finished.
[2:21:38] We're quite a few people here, but
[2:21:40] you're just a little crowd. I say, "Fear
[2:21:43] not, little flock."
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; It's the father's good pleasure to give
[2:21:48] you the kingdom.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; We need to hear these kind of words.
[2:21:54] I'm going to sing a song that I have in
[2:21:57] mind for the closing of this meeting.
[2:22:01] It's a simple song,
[2:22:04] but it's a true song.
[2:22:07] This gospel is dripping with blood.
[2:22:11] Dripping with blood.
[2:22:15] Let's pray before we sing.
[2:22:19] Father,
[2:22:22] how
[2:22:25] constrained I have felt within.
[2:22:28] How moved.
[2:22:32] cannot describe
[2:22:35] how your Holy Spirit has been dealing
[2:22:37] with my own heart,
[2:22:40] seeking to convey, oh God, to people
[2:22:42] that I love.
[2:22:44] Lord,
[2:22:47] the environment, the very age that we're
[2:22:50] in,
[2:22:53] the very environment that we move about
[2:22:55] from day to day
[2:22:58] seems to have an effect and an influence
[2:23:02] on us that we don't have to really press
[2:23:05] hard. We can kind of go along and things
[2:23:09] will be the same next week and next
[2:23:12] month and next year.
[2:23:15] Oh God, I feel that I need to warn these
[2:23:18] people that they do not give their ear
[2:23:22] to the lie of Satan because a prophet
[2:23:25] has already said it will go on and on
[2:23:28] and they had no they had no awareness of
[2:23:32] what was taking place and they were not
[2:23:35] as concerned as they should have been.
[2:23:38] Lord, we've heard too much.
[2:23:41] We've heard
[2:23:43] so much. Lord, I pray that you will now
[2:23:47] take these words that have been spoken
[2:23:50] and superimpose them upon the hearts. I
[2:23:53] pray you'll brand our hearts. I pray
[2:23:55] that you'll take young people I was
[2:23:57] especially burdened for while I was with
[2:23:59] they know nothing of these things.
[2:24:01] Perhaps this isn't part of their history
[2:24:03] lessons,
[2:24:05] but it is part of the spiritual
[2:24:08] history. It's part of the spiritual
[2:24:11] present as well. And I pray, oh God, by
[2:24:14] the Holy Spirit that you'll make these
[2:24:16] things a reality.
[2:24:20] And father, I ask expressly a request
[2:24:26] that you will take and now lay a hand
[2:24:31] upon that one those man, woman, young
[2:24:36] people that are not prepared, not ready,
[2:24:41] have not made a firm decision.
[2:24:45] You have dealt with them. They can only
[2:24:48] come if you call them. But some perhaps
[2:24:50] have been hearing your voice, have been
[2:24:52] putting it off, putting it off. They
[2:24:54] have an answer. They have an excuse. But
[2:24:56] today, I pray there'll be a mighty
[2:24:58] awakening within them.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hold them over the flames of hell. If
[2:25:03] you need to, Lord, let them know that
[2:25:05] their life is brief.
[2:25:07] And our passage here on earth is just
[2:25:10] but for a moment. And their life, as
[2:25:13] your word is spoken in James, is but a
[2:25:15] vapor.
[2:25:17] It appears for a little while and then
[2:25:18] it's gone. Lord, I ask that you'll deal
[2:25:22] with them and don't let them leave the
[2:25:24] sanctuary till they found a place
[2:25:27] whether here at the front or whether in
[2:25:29] their seat or in their car. I care not.
[2:25:32] But oh God, before they enter these
[2:25:34] doors again, I pray they will have made
[2:25:36] their peace with God and they have
[2:25:39] surrendered their life, oh Lord, in the
[2:25:41] name of Jesus Christ. word will not be
[2:25:44] easier tomorrow than it is right today.
[2:25:47] In your name I ask it. Amen.
[2:25:52] Amen.
[2:25:57] Would you like to stand?
[2:26:05] The first one to die for
[2:26:10] this Holy Ghost plan
[2:26:14] was John the Baptist.
[2:26:18] He died like a man.
[2:26:22] Then came the Lord Jesus.
[2:26:26] They crucified him.
[2:26:30] He taught that the spirit
[2:26:34] would save man from sin.
[2:26:38] Dripping with blood. Yes,
[2:26:42] it's dripping with blood.
[2:26:46] This Holy Ghost goel
[2:26:50] is dripping with blood.
[2:26:54] The blood of disciples
[2:26:58] who died for the truth.
[2:27:02] This Holy Ghost goel
[2:27:06] is dripping with blood.
[2:27:10] There's Peter and Paul.
[2:27:14] John the divine.
[2:27:18] They gave up their lives so
[2:27:21] this gospel could shine.
[2:27:25] They mingled their blood.
[2:27:29] Like the prophets are
[2:27:33] so the true word of God
[2:27:38] be told.
[2:27:41] It's dripping with blood.
[2:27:45] It's dripping with blood.
[2:27:49] This Holy Ghost goel
[2:27:52] is dripping with blood.
[2:27:56] The blood of
[2:28:01] the truth
[2:28:04] is
[2:28:09] blood.
[2:28:11] Now I want to go to the last verse
[2:28:14] and have the words on the screen for
[2:28:18] you. There's souls under the altar
[2:28:22] crying how long for the Lord to punish
[2:28:27] those who've done wrong.
[2:28:31] I made some comments right at the very
[2:28:33] beginning of the service.
[2:28:35] I said, "We're of another nation. I
[2:28:39] don't care what nation you came from.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what nation you came from.
[2:28:45] And I sing to love some of my most
[2:28:46] dearest friends in this audience from
[2:28:49] the land of Germany. Let me tell you
[2:28:51] something.
[2:28:53] Let me tell you something.
[2:28:55] When those people,
[2:28:58] those Jews are on their way to the gas
[2:29:00] chamber, the scripture that Isaiah said,
[2:29:04] there's no weapon formed against thee
[2:29:07] that shall prosper.
[2:29:10] Not even a crematorium.
[2:29:12] You say, "How horrific, how tragic,
[2:29:15] how incredible."
[2:29:18] Let me tell you something.
[2:29:20] For one reason, for one reason alone, my
[2:29:24] guide says to me, this curator said, if
[2:29:26] you were Polish,
[2:29:29] if you're Russian, or if you were
[2:29:32] something else,
[2:29:35] there was a there was
[2:29:38] a possibility. He said there was a
[2:29:40] possibility.
[2:29:42] But if you were a Jew,
[2:29:44] there was no possibility.
[2:29:48] And that group I stand up in front of
[2:29:50] and had my finger pointing at them. He
[2:29:53] said in the next 30 to 45 minutes
[2:29:55] they're all ready in the crematorium.
[2:30:01] People are ready to set up home.
[2:30:04] But you know what? Listen friends, you
[2:30:08] would never know oh how you need the
[2:30:11] keys of this message. You had never
[2:30:13] known. You've never heard it from anyone
[2:30:15] else because for the testimony, not for
[2:30:18] the testimony of Christ, for the
[2:30:19] testimony of the word of God. Because
[2:30:21] this Bible came to us by the Jews.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; And because of this, they're hated.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Because they are Jews. They're hated.
[2:30:31] And they walk to the crematorium and
[2:30:33] come out of there with a white robe.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; There is no weapon formed against them
[2:30:40] that could prosper. No weapon formed
[2:30:42] against you that can prosper. None.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; None. No mad man can take your crown.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; No demon-possessed
[2:30:53] leader can take your victory or take
[2:30:56] your crown.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; You've never heard me say this before
[2:31:03] and you forgive me if it doesn't sit
[2:31:05] right with you, but Hitler did him a
[2:31:07] favor.
[2:31:10] I'm sorry
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; if you don't understand that. Just like
[2:31:13] Cain did Abel a favor.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Made him a type of Christ. The Roman
[2:31:20] soldier who stabbed Christ and water and
[2:31:23] blood came out. Did you a favor? Gave us
[2:31:25] a savior.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; They thought they were killing him. They
[2:31:28] gave you a savior.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; He thought he was destroying a nation.
[2:31:33] All he was doing was giving them white
[2:31:35] robes.
[2:31:37] put them in a place where they could get
[2:31:39] a white robe.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Thank God for this message.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't know that if you didn't
[2:31:47] have this message.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; You'd read it in the word, but you don't
[2:31:50] have the key to open up the word.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; We got a key.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; We got a prophet key.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; You talk about being stirred up. I am
[2:32:03] stirred up. I'm stirred right to the
[2:32:06] bottom of my bootstraps, friends.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; What a gospel we have. What a message we
[2:32:10] have.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; And the world, they're saying, the
[2:32:18] leaders got there and I spoke with
[2:32:21] brother Tony because it just come once
[2:32:22] again from the message. They got keys in
[2:32:24] the message. They said never again. The
[2:32:28] next leader got up and said never again.
[2:32:31] this this is happening here and all this
[2:32:33] symbolism of the crematoriums and all of
[2:32:35] this death these death camps we are as
[2:32:38] leaders are saying never again and they
[2:32:41] represented nations who wouldn't say
[2:32:42] anything when it was happening
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; and religious leaders saying never again
[2:32:49] and the prophet said we had a first war
[2:32:51] and then they had a league of nations
[2:32:52] and the league of nations they said
[2:32:54] we'll have a league of nations because
[2:32:55] we're saying never again but there was
[2:32:57] another one
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; there had to be another birth pain.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; And it was a harder birth pain.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; You talk about incinerating. United
[2:33:08] States dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,
[2:33:10] incinerated 90,000 in just seconds.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; 90,000. And the fire wasn't on the
[2:33:15] earth. The fire came from heaven.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; It blew up at about 30,000 ft in the air
[2:33:21] and just caused a firestorm to come down
[2:33:23] and leveled the buildings, incinerated
[2:33:25] the people, and according to the
[2:33:27] scriptures, their flesh melted on them.
[2:33:29] Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; The heavens are full of it.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; I may not live to say it. And no
[2:33:37] believer will live to say it. Says
[2:33:39] before the first bomb drops, but a bomb
[2:33:42] will drop.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; But before the first bomb drops, the
[2:33:45] bride of Jesus Christ is gone.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Say, how are we going to be gone?
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if man can take life
[2:33:53] from off the earth, God can certainly
[2:33:55] take his bride from off the earth.
[2:33:59] Hallelujah.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Their souls under the altar.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Crying how long?
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; He says they're crying for vengeance.
[2:34:12] They're not bride. He said not bride
[2:34:14] material. She's not crying for
[2:34:15] vengeance. These are calling for
[2:34:17] vengeance. When are we going to get
[2:34:20] vengeance for the evil that's been done
[2:34:22] to us? But because they were held the
[2:34:26] testimony of the word of God, they
[2:34:28] didn't even know.
[2:34:34] God gave them white robes. That's God's
[2:34:37] business.
[2:34:39] Hallelujah.
[2:34:40] And there may be more yet.
[2:34:44] Are you ready to pledge allegiance to
[2:34:45] the Lamb?
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; If you need prayer, we'll be happy to
[2:34:51] pray with you.
[2:34:54] their souls under the altar
[2:34:59] crying how long
[2:35:02] for the Lord to punish
[2:35:06] those who done wrong
[2:35:14] who give their life's blood
[2:35:17] for this Holy Ghost goel
[2:35:21] and his crimson and blood.
[2:35:25] It's dripping with blood. Yes,
[2:35:29] it's dripping with blood.
[2:35:33] This Holy Ghost goel
[2:35:36] is dripping with blood.
[2:35:40] The blood of disciples
[2:35:44] died for the truth.
[2:35:48] This Holy Ghostel
[2:35:51] is dripping with blood.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; It's dripping with blood. Yes,
[2:35:59] it's dripping with blood.
[2:36:03] This Holy Ghost goel
[2:36:08] dripping with blood
[2:36:16] for the truth.
[2:36:29] Oh God,
[2:36:31] our father,
[2:36:33] my father,
[2:36:36] how this morning,
[2:36:39] early as I pondered these things,
[2:36:43] I thought of these
[2:36:46] that went to their death and for what
[2:36:48] cause? They did not know. But we have a
[2:36:52] cause. We have a purpose.
[2:36:56] We have a real privilege to live a life.
[2:37:01] Oh God,
[2:37:03] we're living in strange times. We're
[2:37:05] also living in treacherous times.
[2:37:08] We're living in the most deceived time,
[2:37:10] the most deceiving of all ages. Don't
[2:37:14] let any of that deception, Lord,
[2:37:16] influence or affect any life that's
[2:37:19] represented here. Lord, I poured out my
[2:37:21] heart. Pour out my soul. Pour out the
[2:37:24] burden of the word of the Lord. Let men
[2:37:26] and women take seriously
[2:37:29] their spiritual life. I pray in the name
[2:37:32] of Jesus Christ that the conviction of
[2:37:34] the Holy Spirit
[2:37:36] will be upon oh God those that need to
[2:37:39] make a stand and need to make a step
[2:37:41] that need to make a confession.
[2:37:44] Oh God I pray for every person that's
[2:37:48] been under the sound of my voice today.
[2:37:51] Ask that you will impress them
[2:37:54] indelibly. Lord, let some suited word by
[2:37:59] the Holy Spirit be anchored into their
[2:38:01] heart. Father, I ask that you will draw
[2:38:05] us all into that place that you have
[2:38:08] ordained for us. And I pray, oh God,
[2:38:13] you'll dismiss us and just prepare us
[2:38:14] for this evening.
[2:38:17] Let this be a day of contemplation.
[2:38:20] and how my desire is Lord and I pray
[2:38:23] before these people that I may live
[2:38:28] father as it would be pleasing in your
[2:38:31] sight in Jesus Christ's name amen
[2:38:38] going to dismiss you quietly ask you not
[2:38:41] to visit
[2:38:43] there may be those who
[2:38:46] who feel as though they
[2:38:49] need to ponder these things. We need to
[2:38:51] pray about them. We're living in real
[2:38:52] serious times, friend. I I just don't
[2:38:55] mean to mince any words.
[2:38:58] I don't want to see the things in the
[2:39:00] message
[2:39:01] go just the way,
[2:39:05] you know, if we didn't hold a restraint,
[2:39:07] it just go, you know, anyway. And that's
[2:39:11] not what we're here for.
[2:39:13] And everybody,
[2:39:15] I want you to be in prayer and be
[2:39:17] supportive and pray for those that you
[2:39:20] know that are in need. Oh God, let's
[2:39:23] live according to this word. You can you
[2:39:27] say amen for us? Amen. God bless you.
[2:39:31] You're dismissed in the name of Jesus
[2:39:32] Christ.
