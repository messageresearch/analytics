And believe he shall receive and believe he shall receive and believe he shall receive his own. Stand. &gt;&gt; Hear somebody say &gt;&gt; you stand. Some of you are going to be singing with brother Sam Adam. So I don't know some of you are sitting down are going to sing with him. But brother Sam, why don't you come and those who are going to be singing with you come and get ready. Let's sing. Know ye not. Know ye not. You are a temple. When I wake up in the morning and think of the great things God has done for me in my heart there, That's rejoicing to think that a new day has dawn on me. For the glorious mysteries in God's word that he has allowed me to share. It's only an indication of his great love. How much he cares. I feel down in this day on me. There's only things that were days that are that day. things that ought to be. What has been made from the eyes of the wise and the prudent he has revealed onto his own. Well, it's a message of preparation to take us to God eternal life praise. Yeah. Heat. See all her standing borders to swallow up humanity. I think that I'm one in a million chosen by God to send in this evil day. It's only an indication of his great love, how much he cares. Heat. Heat. I feel like you feel like this. Yeah. Heat. Well, God bless you. It's one thing to praise him with our lips, praise him with our lives, praise him with our giving. &gt;&gt; We announced that we would be receiving a a missionary offering tonight for missions. We had a expense offering. I don't know what it was last night, but the night before was about 1,100 US and about 1,4500 Canadian. And we're very very thankful to you uh for that. Uh we certainly we're trying to give the people here and especially the young people. It's going to be a full seven days. Yeah. Seven and a half days. It gets almost eight days, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Seven days. Seven days, eight nights. And we have we have a little technicality here because we we signed an agreement for seven days, but it didn't say eight nights. So, uh anyhow, we had to pay a little bit extra. But we don't mind paying a little bit extra because we feel as though it's important to give God's people and to give God uh the best that we have. &gt;&gt; And we are thankful for this camp. I I'm going to ask the young people, how are you enjoying the food? I've been at quite a number of camps now uh over the last 20 years and I found that in some of the camps we had when our people when our sisters weren't cooking, our brothers, uh they they would miss the odd meal. I haven't seen anybody missing any of the meals here. And right from the dessert to the salad to the main course, it has just been really something special. Uh where we have the tent set up, everything seems to be just very, very fine. The facility is real fine. We're thankful that God made this possible for us. And you know that we signed it for five years if the Lord carries. But the way the camp's going, uh I doubt if we even have five years. This is the second one. We only have three more after this one on this site. But the way the camp's been going and the way the word has been coming, the literally the way it's been preached, I I I would I'd be surprised. I was after midnight. I left here last night and there's probably 200 people yet here in the tent. And I was leaving at 11:00 and they said there's a young man praying and I there was still uh there was two or three that were had been here and they'd been they had already been on the floor praying for an hour before God. God doing something. It wasn't some emotional thing. It was quiet. They were just &gt;&gt; uh God dealing with them and and God had already dealt with them in the past, but they were it was just something more that was happening. I believe in it, friends. &gt;&gt; I believe in it. I don't believe there's a in fact is I can assure you there's not one person here that has as much of God as they need. We all need more. And we we we need to make that confession and need to come with the expectation. I need it. He has it. And this is the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what we have and what we enjoy, we seek to allow others in other parts of the country that are real needy. And there are real needy people that number one don't have the message, don't have it available to them, maybe don't have the tapes or the discs or whatever more. Perhaps they don't have ministry. And there's just a wide range of of things that we uh uh not attempt to, but by God's grace and by the generosity of the people, God has always provided. And I know that he will. I would like the congregation, if you would here tonight, there's a good audience. We could give a real generous uh uh offering. And when you give tonight, I want you to think of somebody who doesn't have camp like this. Listen, there's been believers in Serbia for 20 years, and we, Brother Milco and myself, went in there 20 years ago and brought the message into the former Yugoslavia. They've had civil war. We've got brothers sitting here in this congregation that had to fight. They were in the some of them in the army for four years. They know what I'm talking about. And God led them to himself and they came to know about Jesus Christ and his saving power. And it doesn't come by military might. It comes by Holy Ghost might. And there's been and they know how to appreciate what I'm saying. And this year was the first year they were able to have a gathering, a convention. They were so delighted. It was like they were in the millennium. They could FOR THE FIRST TIME they could get together. What would it be if uh brother and sister Haley down in in Boisee and some maybe down the Tri Cities, the Perkins and some up from Edmonton and whatever more and they they'd have their own little gatherings. But then uh finally an opportunity comes and we've been looking for it for 20 years. We've been having it every year for 20 years. They've never had it and now for the first time they were been looking forward to it and have it 20 years to contribute a little bit to help them and we're helping them right now print print some messages they haven't been getting them. I think it's a worthy cause. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what friends, I'll never never I'll never never worry about that. I hold a message in my hand. And when I hold that message in my hand and realize THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PUT THIS MESSAGE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND THAT otherwise couldn't get it, to me it's a most worthy thing. That's a lot. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; And that's what we'll be giving tonight. You might say, "Well, I haven't got my checkbook and I haven't got I didn't come prepared. Put an IOU in it." But don't forget to sign your name so we know who that I owe you belongs to. But you might not. That's fine. We we I've got a couple already. I It's just great. I sooner have an I owe you than I don't owe you anything. &gt;&gt; You might say, "I never heard brother Bisll take up an offering like this." We up here in the north, we don't know how to take up offerings. But I've been in the south long enough to been with brother Dan Dasley and a few of those folks, brother Tony down there, and I saw how they took up offering. I thought that works. That was almost a downer here. I said, "That really works." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I know God's people believe in giving. I just want to read these scriptures while the brothers, while the deacons come forward, would you please? Wherefore, this is 1 Chronicles 29. Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation. And David said, "Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel, our father, forever and ever." Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty. For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all, both riches and honor come of thee. And thou reignest over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Listen to this. It is thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all. Now therefore, oh God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him. And then this 14th verse, but who am I? And what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of thee. The breath you're breathing is not your own. The sun shone on you today free of charge. The air that you breathed didn't cost you a thing. The food that we've eaten and all of this so on. Well, it yes, it cost a little bit, a little bit of energy, a little bit of strength and so on so forth. But the salvation and the blessings, how many here, I just want you to raise your hand, were here last night and were immensely blessed. &gt;&gt; It comes from him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then now what you have in your hand or what you have of your resources, what David said, it has come from you. &gt;&gt; That's what we ought to remember. It has come from him. And now we're going to ask God's blessing upon the giving. Heavenly Father, without any shame or apology, we come at this moment to be able to give. And it is indeed a great honor and privilege that we can share something of the uh of the generosity that you have shown to us and now that we would be able to share it with someone in Africa or in China, in Yugoslavia, in India or in Brazil or in Mosmbique that has had such a a dirt FOR THE MESSAGE. OH GOD. AND I SEE THOSE EYES HOW THEY WILL glisten when they have a little packet of messages that are put into their hands. Oh God. AND SOME MINISTER WHO WHO IS SO EARNESTLY DESIRING TO bring something to his PEOPLE AND HE'S HEARD IT perhaps by his ear, but now he would be able to have it in his hand and to study. And what good reports we have heard when the men of God have got the word of God into their hands. How the how the how the scriptures have opened up to them. And now, Father, I pray you will anoint the people in their giving. That you'll bless them in their giving. And these young people, oh God, I pray that you will teach them this great glorious principle that IT'S MORE BLESSED TO give than it is to receive. We have received, but now we GIVE WITH THE LIBERALITY OF THE HOLY Spirit in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you and bless you brothers as you give. I'm going to ask brother Jason if you'll come and I'd like to sing. God is in his people once again. The God that gave his son to die freely for us. That God is in his people once again. Hallelujah. God is in his people once again fulfilling all his promises he has been through the work of life to manifest the wonders of his glory again preparing for the day when we see no longer to this last self made his people once again so trusting faithful to the end. For God is in his peaceful once again, fulfilling all the promises he has sent. The truth, the word, the life manifest. The wonders of the glory getting blessed, preparing for the day when we see. No longer do this self. God is in his people once again. So we must be faithful to the end. Let's sing the first verse. First verse. There we go. These are troubled times, my friend. And so we must be faithful to the end, keeping perfect peace with our Lord and satisfying all his commands. striving till we reach our reward through the awesome power of his word. Oh, he's a troubled time, my friend. But God is in his people once again. Oh, God is in his people once again, fulfilling all the promises he has left. The truth the word the lie manifest the wonders of his glory again and bless caring for the day when we see no longer through this glass of self dark. God is in his people once again. So we must be faithful to the end. Amen. Well, I'm going to we're going to get ready to turn into tune to to the word right now. Uh I was at at home earlier or later before we just came to service and plugged in a CD that my wife had in the CD player and uh Sister Margaret sings that song, Speak to the Storm, Speak to the Rain. I've asked her if she could come and and sing it for us tonight. It's it's not only the course, but it's the verses that uh I think mean a lot of what we've been hearing from Brother Ron Spencer. Sister Margaret, if you'd come and get ready and brother John, if you can give her a little power above the music so they can hear those verses there. They're perfect. Why don't we sing as she comes and gets ready? Our Lord is so good. Our Lord is so good. Amen. Speak to Speak to the storm. Speak to the rain. You have the power to bring about a change. God has come in you. Now he speaks through you. Don't cry, my brother. Just speak in his name. Speak to the storm. Speak to the rain. You have the power to bring about a change. God has come in you now. He speaks through you. Don't cry, my sister. Just speak in his name. We're in a new season now. You have authority. God commands the devil to set your loved ones free. The third pole is here now. It can't be imitated. The power that's in the bride cannot be duplicated. Speak to the storm. Speak to the rain. You have the power to bring about a change. God has peace in you. Now he speaks through you. Don't cry, my brother. Just speak in his name. Satan's coming at you like a mighty lion's roar. But you don't have to take what he's doing anymore. Put on your fighting armor. Be confident and sure. There's no need to fear him. Tell him who you're standing for. Now speak to the storm. Speak to the rain. You have the power to bring about a change. God has come in you now. He speaks through you. Don't cry, my brother. Just speak in his name. Speak to the storm. Speak to the rain. You have the power to bring about a change. God has come in you. Now he speaks through you. Don't cry, my brother. Don't cry, my brother. Don't cry, my sister. Just speak in his name. Let's stand. We're going to receive our brother Ron Spencer. Not receive only the person uh the vessel, but now the Christ. You believe that Christ is here now? &gt;&gt; He is here indeed. We'll sing only believe only believe as our brother Ron Spencer comes and as you prepare your heart for expectation. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Holy meet. All things are possible. Glory. &gt;&gt; Everyone look this way and let us sing. Jesus is here. If you wish to close your eyes, raise your hands. Do that if you wish. But sing it &gt;&gt; as your confession. I am believing &gt;&gt; with everything that's in me. I may not see it. I may not even feel it, but I say it because he said it. &gt;&gt; And our brother spoke last night. Draw the sword out. &gt;&gt; Draw that one out. &gt;&gt; I'll draw one out. Where two or three Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; are gathered IN HIS NAME, &gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. &gt;&gt; How's that? &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; You young people with your voices lift it up. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Here now. Jesus is here. All things are possible because Jesus is here. Jesus is here. I believe it. Lord Jesus is here. Jesus is &gt;&gt; one more time tonight. Jesus. Jesus is here. All things are Jesus. Jesus is Jesus. All things are possible. Jesus is here. Let us bow our heads to the Lord this evening. How many has a need yet tonight? Amen. Amen. I believe he's here to confirm his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, we bow our heads before you tonight and we thank you for what you have done. And Lord, we thank you tonight that we're aware that you're here. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just ask you that you would just come and anoint Clay tonight. &gt;&gt; May you anoint our lips, &gt;&gt; anoint our mind. Lord, I pray that the greatest gift that we can have tonight, both as hearer and speaker, is to get ourselves out of the way. &gt;&gt; And I pray that there would be a conference set here tonight. A conference between God and his wife. May you come in this building tonight, Father, under this tent. May you speak to our hearts. And Lord, may we reach beyond the veil tonight, beyond flesh. And I ask you that you would speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus, in a special way. In Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. Had a good day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me this afternoon to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 to the bride of Jesus Christ. This is a very familiar portion of scripture and then we will look at Hebrews chapter 11 this evening. Paul is speaking to us. He says, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice of the archangel and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Hebrews chapter 11. Verse 33. who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire. He escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weaknesses were made strong, waxed valiant and fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay, moreover, of bondences and imprisonments. They were stoned. They were swn aunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, and tormented. of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth. And these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Two more verses. And wherefore seeing we are comp also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us. And let us run with patience the race that is set before us. looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy was set before him, endured the cross, despising the same, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this and what thank you of Christ. He is preaching in Chicago and he says HE SAYS CHICAGO I ASK you this afternoon. What thank ye of Christ? Whose son is he? In his resurrection power when he walked here on the earth he saw visions. HE'S DONE MIRACLES, performed things, and he said, "These things that I do, shall you do also nightly." You see those things performed right here in this church. What's your opinion OF JESUS CHRIST? &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, ISN'T HE? &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, I COULD ASK TODAY, DWIGHT MOODY, what do you think of Jesus Christ? HE SAYS WHEN HE WAS DYING THERE HE ASKED THAT QUESTION. I believe when he was dying AND HE SAID IS THIS DEATH HE SAID THIS IS MY CORONATION DAY. &gt;&gt; HE SAID I TELL YOU LIVES OF GREAT men all remind us we can make our life sublime with partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time. footprints that perhaps another he says SAIL IN AFTERLIFE SOLEMN MAN for for long and shipwreck brother sin shall take heart again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like to look this evening at screams from the sands of time. Brother Brandham makes a couple of statements and I just want to take a couple of things from this and and and you'll catch it quickly where I'm headed. He in in taking sides with Jesus, he says, I want you, he says, I notice that how that the churches that evangelism scattering out everywhere. He says, then we'll take for instance Paul becoming a great missionary to find our people. We find out THAT HE WENT WHEREVER the Lord led him and he established his church and it has a new faith and the churches of all those days like it was in Asia Minor and throughout Europe they didn't believe the message and when he preached the message and many was converted to it then there was no one if they left the people in that condition they were under right back into their pagan gods into the countries HE SAID EACH ONE OF THESE CHURCHES HE LEFT SOMEONE WHO WAS in order, a man that was trustworthy, a man that was known as a pastor, a shepherd. He says, HE SAYS, "THEN AFTER THAT, THE CHURCH become little churches come after that. Young men, old men raised up and become churches after that." He said, "The man that was THAT WAS OVER THE first church was called the bishop, THEN WENT OUT AFTER THIS, AND HIS CHILDREN CALLED SHEPHERDS and pastors, and then a group of little churches WOULD COME BACK." HE SAYS LIKE BACK IN THE TIME OF IREANIUS, HE CARRIED on the same thing. Martin carried on the same thing. Polycarp carried on the same thing right DOWN THROUGH THE AGES LIKE THAT. HE SAYS WHEN THE HE SAYS THE APOSTLE of the church, he said that was Paul. AND WHEN PAUL LEFT, JOHN TOOK OVER THE CHURCH. AND WHEN JOHN LEFT, POLYCARP TOOK OVER. HE SAYS WHEN POLYCARP LEFT, IREANIUS took over. He says, "MARTIN AND SO FORTH." IT JUST KEPT GOING ON AND ON UNTIL THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH BROKE THE WHOLE THING to pieces and BURNED THEM AND SCATTERED THEM AND THE PLUMBER worm eat this and and the cankerworm eat that and so forth and eat that. AND HE SAYS IT PLUM ON DOWN TO THE STALK. HE SAID, "BUT GOD HAS PROMISED &gt;&gt; TO RESTORE that same thing." And I do BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT WE'RE LIVING IN THE LAST DAYS. I believe there's NOT TOO MUCH THAT WOULD BREAK THIS ANYTHING. AND MY INTERPRETATION may be wrong of the scriptures that Jesus HE SAYS COULD NOT COME TONIGHT. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S LE LITTLE that's left to be fulfilled could BE FULFILLED BEFORE THE DAYLIGHT OF THE MORNING. HE SAYS, "I may be wrong on the TIME OF THAT FULFILLING." HE SAYS, "BUT IT'S AT HAND. &gt;&gt; I believe." AND HE SAYS, "REMEMBER, NOTICE THIS. AND REMEMBER, PAUL BELIEVED THAT, &gt;&gt; JOHN BELIEVED THAT, &gt;&gt; POLYCART BELIEVED THAT, IREANIUS BELIEVED THAT, MARTIN BELIEVED THAT, AND ALL OF THE REST OF THEM BELIEVED THAT." &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHAT IF GOD WOULD HAVE TOLD JOHN THE REVELATOR?" NOW, IT'S GOING TO BE 2,000 YEARS BEFORE MY COMING. JOHN WOULD HAVE COME BACK AND TOLD THE CHURCH, "WELL, I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL GO OUT AND EAT, DRINK, and be merry." HE SAYS, "CONS THERE'S GOING TO BE GENERATIONS, many generations." JESUS ISN'T GOING TO COME FOR 2,000 YEARS. HE SAID, "THE CHURCH WOULD have been loose. THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO ON THE MARK. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAITING. AFTER ALL, IT'S YOUR ANTICIPATION. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "CUZ IT AIN'T GOING TO HINDER ONE THING. YOU'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT ON TIME ANYHOW." SEE WHAT I MEAN? HE SAYS, "NOW, WHEN ST. MARTIN AWAKES IN THE RESURRECTION, ST. PAUL AND ALL OF THE REST OF THEM. IT'LL BE JUST AS FRESH, &gt;&gt; JUST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN RIGHT IN THE BATTLE, BATTLING RIGHT AWAY. HE SAYS, "CUZ THEY WENT RIGHT DOWN UNDER THE SAME ANTICIPATIONS LOOKING FOR HIS COMING AND THERE'LL BE A SCREAM COME UP AND WILL COME TO THE WHOLE CHURCH. YOU SEE WHAT IT TO BE. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER. SO WE'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS EVEN IF WE DON'T KNOW IT COULD POSSIBLY BE. IT COULD BE A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. IT COULD BE 500 YEARS FROM NOW, A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW. I DON'T KNOW. NOBODY KNOWS. HE SAYS FOR INSTANCE IF THAT IF WE LIVE EACH DAY THAT WE THAT HE WAS COMING THAT DAY IF WE LIVE LIKE THAT HE'S COMING THIS DAY WHEN WE AWAKE HE SAYS AND WE AWAKEN THE RESURRECTION IT'LL BE JUST AS FRESH AS IF WE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND JUST WOKE UP THAT TRUMPET WILL SOUND AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE FIRST AND THEN WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. NOW, you know, there's some things that we see and some we don't see. Brother Brandham says this, and I'm just going to drop this here, and it may seem odd that I would drop it in this spot, but brother Brandham said that when Amra and Jose was was getting ready to put the baby Moses into the bull rush, HE SAID, GOD CALLED FOR GABRIEL &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, GABRIEL, I WANT YOU TO COME &gt;&gt; AND SIT ON THE TOP OF THIS LITTLE BASKET. &gt;&gt; I AM SURE THAT AMRA DID NOT SEE IT. I AM SURE THAT HIS MOTHER DID NOT SEE IT. BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY PROOF POSITIVE THAT EVERY DEMON IN HELL. &gt;&gt; EVERY DEMON IN HELL SAW GABRIEL TAKE HIS POSITION. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "NOW YOU LINE UP THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF ANGELS ALL UP AND DOWN THIS CROCODILE INFESTED WATERS." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT IF A CROCODILE COMES AND PUTS A NOSE AGAINST THAT BASKET, AGAINST THAT ASPHALT, YOU MAKE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T GET IT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SAID THEN WHEN HE GOES DOWN THAT RIVER AND HE GETS INTO THE WHIRLPOOLS OF LIFE, WHICH HE WILL. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU SEE TO IT THAT HE WILL GET OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; SAYING ALL OF THAT TO SAY THIS, WE ARE NOT ALONE UNDER THIS TENT TONIGHT. GATHERING IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; A CLOUD OF WITNESSES THAT ARE UNDER THE SAME ANTICIPATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, remember this, brother Brandham talks about in Revelations chapter 1, he begins to talk ABOUT SEVEN STARS. CHRIST STANDING THERE WITH THOSE seven stars in his hands and those seven lampstands and th that seven THAT SEVEN LAMPSTICKS AS THEY'RE standing there. Being message believers, WE UNDERSTAND. I'VE asked theologians just for just for seeing HOW THEY FEEL. I'VE ASKED THEM WHAT THOSE SCRIPTURES MEANT. And of course, they would stand there and give me a lot of their their UH SYNOPSISES THAT YOU MIGHT SAY and stagger AROUND IN DARKNESS. AND THEY JUST HAD DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD STOOD THERE &gt;&gt; AND TIED THE LOOSE ENDS FOR THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WAS CHRIST COMING ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THOSE DISPENSATIONS THROUGH EVERY CHURCH AGE. WHEN THE APOSTLE PAUL WAS STANDING THERE AND HE SAID, "I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST WRITING 14 BOOKS OF THE BIBLE." HE SAID, "I COME NOT WITH POWER." HE SAYS, "I COME TO YOU NOT WITH YOU TO YOU WITH ENTICING WORDS OF MAN'S WISDOM, BUT I COME TO YOU IN POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; SPAWNED FROM UNDER HIS MINISTRY WHERE MEN, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT WAS UNDER THE SAME WICK, UNDER THE SAME ANOINTING. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR WICKS WERE DIPPED IN THE SAME OIL. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, HE SAYS, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT. HE SAYS, "BUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE LAND, EVERY ONE OF THOSE CANDLESTICKS WERE LIT BY THE SAME FIRE." HE SAID, "IT WAS CHRIST COMING DOWN THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES." NOW, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THESE ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN AND THE GREATEST WOMEN THAT EVER LIVED. &gt;&gt; These are not 10-centent people. &gt;&gt; We would say to by today's standards that they're astronauts of their ages. &gt;&gt; Brother Random simply puts it like this and he said, "Here's the plan of it. The first thing that happens, an announcement in heaven's first, &gt;&gt; a seal opens. &gt;&gt; He said a mystery is unfolded. And when THAT MYSTERY IS UNFOLDED, THEN A TRUMPET sounds and it declares a war &gt;&gt; or a plague falls AND THE CHURCH AGES OPEN. HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THE WAR PART?" THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH CATCHES THE MYSTERY OF GOD, NOT FULLY YET REVEALED. BUT WHEN HE DOES, HE CATCHES THE MYSTERY OF GOD. AND HE GOES FORTH TO THE PEOPLE. AND AFTER THE MYSTERY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HIM, HE GOES FORTH TO THE PEOPLE. WHAT DOES HE DO OUT THERE? HE BEGINS TO PROCLAIM THE MESSAGE. AND WHAT DOES IT START? A WAR. &gt;&gt; A SPIRITUAL WAR. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. HE SAYS THIS IN THE PATMAS VISION. HE SAID, "NOW THE LAMP STEMS ALL FIT INTO ONE GREAT BIG BOWL, ONE GREAT BIG HOLDER." HE SAYS, "SEVEN DIFFERENT LAMP HOLDERS COME OUT OF IT." HE SAYS, "AND WHEN THEY DID THAT, EACH ONE OF THOSE LIGHTS WAS DRAWING FROM THE MAIN RESOURCE OF ITS LIGHT." AND HE SAID, "IT'S THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT HAD THE CANDLE DIPPED INTO THE HE SAYS INTO THE MAIN BARREL." HE SAID, "WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF ONE OF THOSE SEVEN STARS THAT REPRESENTED THERE WITH THIS LIFE OF THE FIRE WITH THE HOLY GHOST." HERE, HE SAYS, "BY FAITH, IT'S BURNING WITH THE HOLY GHOST," HE SAYS THAT CANDLE, HE SAYS. HE SAID, "BUT THE WICK THAT'S DRIPPING BY THE HOLY GHOST," HE SAID, "THE HOLY SPIRIT THROUGH THAT WICK, HE'S DRAWING THE LIFE OF GOD OUT TO GIVE IT LIGHT TO HIS CHURCH." WHAT A PICTURE OF THE TRUE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT A WHAT KIND OF A LIGHT HE GIVEN." HE SAID, "THE SAME KIND OF LIGHT THAT HE WAS IN THE FIRST CANDLE THAT WAS LIT." &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "WATCH THIS." AND I WANT TO JUST DROP BACK AND GIVE YOU ONE MORE. SORRY TO lay a foundation here just FOR A FEW MOMENTS. HE SAYS, "BUT HE SAYS, NOW LET'S JUST STOP HERE JUST FOR A MOMENT CUZ WE'LL LEAVE THE PICTURE." HE SAID, "LOOK AT THESE candlesticks standing there." NOW HE SAYS WE FIND THEM SEVEN CHURCH AGES. EPHESUS, PERGAMUS, PHILADELPHIAIAN, LEODYSIAN, CHILDREN, SEVEN CHURCH AGES. HE SAID AND EACH ONE OF THESE CANDLESTICKS HAD A LITTLE CRUISE of oil setting there. And this all burned ON THIS CANDLE. AND ONE CANDLE WAS LIT BY THE FIRE OF GOD. THEY TAKEN THAT CANDLE, LIT THE OTHER ONE, THEN SET IT DOWN AND LIT THE OTHER ONE, THEN LIT THE OTHER ONE, AND THEN LIT THE OTHER ONE. ONE OFF OF ANOTHER TILL THAT LAST CANDLE AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT LAST CANDLE IS LIT BY THE SAME OIL. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now the trouble of IT IS WE BAPTISTS, WE METHODISTS," HE SAID, "WE'RE WAY BACK UP HERE TRYING TO TAKE SOME HISTORICAL THING AND HERE GOES THE CHURCH DOWN THROUGH HERE." HE SAYS, "WE'RE LEFT BEHIND." EVERY CHURCH WHEN IT STARTED, HE SAYS, "THEY'RE LEFT BEHIND." HE SAID, "LOOK AT LUTHER IN HIS FIRST REFORMATION. WHAT A REVIVAL." HE SAID, "I'VE GOT HIS TEXTBOOK AT HOME. HOW THAT MAN HEALING, ACCEPTING IT HIMSELF, BELIEVED THE POWER OF GOD EVEN IN SO MUCH THAT HE SPOKE IN TONGUES." MARTIN LUTHER, he said, Martin Luther spoke in tongues. He said, "THEN THE NEXT STAGE COME OUT." JOHN WESLEY, JOHN WESLEY DONE THE SAME THING. AND WHEN HE WAS PREACHING, HE SAID, "WHAT ARE THESE WORDS THAT I MOTHER UNKNOWN TO MYSELF?" HE SAID, "SPEAKING IN TONGUES, BELIEVED IN DIVINE HEALING." AND HE COME TO AMERICA AND THE CHURCHES TREATED HIM LIKE HE WAS A HOLY ROLLER AND THEY PUT HIM OUT OF THE CHURCH AND THEY PREACHED THE GOSPEL OUT THERE AND FELL UNDER THE POWER OF GOD UNTIL THEY LAID IN THE FLOOR ALL NIGHT AT THAT TIME HE SAID IN JOHN WESLEY'S OLD TEXTBOOK WHEN I GOT IT AT HOME NOW WHERE HE WAS RIDING A HORSE ONE DAY AND PRAYED FOR A WOMAN THAT WAS SICK AND THE HORSE FELL AND BROKE ITS LEG AND GOT OFF OF THE HORSE AND TOOK A CRUISE OF ALL AND ANOINTED IN THAT HORSE WITH ALL GOT RIGHT BACK ON IT AND RODE RIGHT BACK AWAY. &gt;&gt; Now I I want to I WANT TO JUST KIND OF TOUCH A COUPLE OF THINGS RIGHT HERE. NOW UNDERSTAND THESE MEN SPIT THESE MEN AND WOMEN SPENT EVERY BIT of energy that they could possibly spend &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S AN ANTICIPATION FROM WITHIN THEM &gt;&gt; FOR THE COMING OF THE Lord &gt;&gt; and IF GIVEN A CHOICE THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED OUR DAY &gt;&gt; HAD THEY BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD PITCH YOUR PEW TO SET IN HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF BEEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, WHAT AGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE LIVED IN? &gt;&gt; WHAT AGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN, PETER? &gt;&gt; NOW, I AM SURE IF PETER COULD STAND HERE TONIGHT AND GIVE US A TESTIMONY SERVICE. I'm just going to relax tonight because I was just started getting nervous a little while ago. I'm just going to shake that thing. NOW, PETER, IF HE COULD STAND HERE TONIGHT AND HE COULD SPEAK TO THIS CONGREGATION, I'M SURE THAT HE COULD BEGIN TO TELL US SOME WORDS. AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO ONCE IN A WHILE BUILD A MEMORIAL. &gt;&gt; We need to ONCE IN A WHILE REVISIT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE VERY COMMON TO US. AND IF PETER COULD COME AND STAND IN MY PLACE TONIGHT AND HE COULD STAND, HE SAID, "I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO KNOW I WAS WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; I WAS WITH HIM AND I SAW ALL THE MIRACLES AND THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS. I SAW LAZARUS COME FORTH OUT OF THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WITH THE FOUR AND 5,000 THAT GOT FED. I WAS THERE THAT HELPED TAKE UP THE LOGS AND TAKE UP THE FISH. I WAS THERE WHEN I SAW THE MIRACLES TAKE PLACE. I WAS THERE WHEN HE WEPT AT THE TOMB. I WAS THERE AND WATCHED HIM TALK TO MARY AND TALK TO MARTHA AND SAY, "I AM GLAD FOR YOUR SAKES." &gt;&gt; THAT I WAS NOT HERE. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN I HEARD HIM LIFT HIS VOICE AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; AND HE SCREAMED, "LAZARUS, COME FORTH. AND A MAN WHO WAS SICK, A MAN THAT WAS ALREADY ROTTING IN THE GRAVE, STEPPED FORTH FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION AND STEPPED OUT. &gt;&gt; I was there when he gave me the keys to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN ALL THE REST OF THEM COULDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHO IS THE CHRIST? &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I, THE SON OF MAN, AM? AND OTHERS SAID, "THOU ART JEREMIAH OR EZEKIEL OR ONE OF THE PROPHETS." BUT SOMETHING MOVED WITHIN ME. A DEEP MOVED INSIDE OF ME. I DIDN'T EVEN HARDLY KNOW WHAT I WAS SAYING, BUT I SAID, "THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD." AND JESUS TURNED TO ME AND SAID, "FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS UNTO THEE, BUT MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN." AND THERE HE CHANGED MY NAME FROM SIMON UNTO PETER. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that's familiar. Well, we're coming. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS I WAS STANDING THERE WITH HIM AND HE TOLD ME LIP TO EAR. AND HE SAID, "SIMON," HE SAID, "SIMON, SIMON, SATAN DESIRES TO SIFT YOU LIKE WEIGHT." &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I HAD THE MESSAGE. I THOUGHT I KNEW WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL ABOUT THE WORD. BUT HE TOLD ME IN JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF SENTENCES THAT I NEEDED MORE. &gt;&gt; I had BEEN RAISED IN A GOOD HOME. I'D BEEN RAISED ANTICIPATING THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH. AND AS I GREW UP, I WAS ANTICIPATING SEEING HIM. &gt;&gt; AND I HAD ENJOYED, LISTEN, I'D LAID JUST JUST A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HIM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. I'D WATCHED HIM HOLD HIS HEAD WITH A HEADACHE. I'D WATCHED HIM GET TIRED FROM PREACHING. I'D WATCHED HIM LAY IN THE BOAT. OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SPOKE TO ME AND HE TOLD ME, "GET BEHIND ME." &gt;&gt; HE EVEN CALLED ME A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS IN AN UNCONVERTED STATE. &gt;&gt; I NEEDED TO DO MORE THAN JUST BELIEVE ON JESUS. &gt;&gt; I needed TO DO MORE THAN JUST HAVE MY FAVORITE QUOTE BOOK. I NEED IT TO BE MORE THAN JUST SEE A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; I NEED IT FOR THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST TO LIVE INSIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; Skipping a forward. He said he told us to carry in the upper room. We did not know what we were waiting for. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were waiting there and WE'D WAITED DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE BRIDE OF THAT DAY. THEY WERE COMING IN ONE ACCORD. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; 380 PEOPLE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS 120 OF US THAT COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT MORE OF HIM. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S GOT TO BE A DETERMINATION IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE 380 PEOPLE SEEING THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST AND HIM TELLING THEM GO TO THE UPPER ROOM AND THEY STILL MISS IT? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL SEE THE MESSAGE SAID IN OUR CHURCHES AND STILL MISS IT? COME RIGHT UP TO THE RAPTURE AND STILL MISS IT. GOD HELP US. &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US. It was a special day. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; It was a special day. We were in such a presence. We were waiting. We were waiting for something. He told us, "I'LL NOT LEAVE YOU COMFORTLESS, &gt;&gt; BUT I WILL COME &gt;&gt; AND DWELL INSIDE OF YOU." &gt;&gt; HE HAD TOLD US THAT THE KINGDOM IS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TOLD US, "LET YOUR LIGHT SO SHINE BEFORE MEN." &gt;&gt; BUT WE WERE COWARDS. WE WERE FISHERMEN. &gt;&gt; I HAD RUN. I HAD DENIED THE LORD. AND I NEEDED SOMETHING MORE. MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING HERE TONIGHT AND YOU'VE SAT IN A PEW OVER AND OVER AND OVER FOR YEARS &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN FOOL THE PREACHER. YOU CAN FOOL YOUR NEIGHBOR. YOU CAN FOOL EVERYBODY AROUND YOU. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING LACKING INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. BROTHER BRENHAM SAID INSIDE OF THAT PILLAR OF FIRE IN THAT BURNING BUSH IT HAD WHAT MOSES WAS LACKING. &gt;&gt; Come on church. YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER RON, THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS THAT I CAN'T OVERCOME." I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE A PREACHER'S DAUGHTER OR A PREACHER'S SON OR A DEACON'S DAUGHTER OR A DEACON'S SON. &gt;&gt; You don't KNOW WHO I AM, BROTHER RON. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. WITHOUT JESUS CHRIST AND WITHOUT THEIR REAL EXPERIENCE, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE TONIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN TROUBLESOME TIMES. WE'RE LIVING IN DIFFICULT HOURS. AND YOU NEED HIM MORE TODAY THAN YOU'VE EVER NEEDED HIM IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; Something came. The season came. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN. &gt;&gt; That's right. BUT HE FILLED ALL THE HOUSE WHERE WE WERE SITTING. &gt;&gt; AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE CAME AND DIVIDED 120 OF US ALL RECEIVED THE SAME BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, I HAD WITNESSED ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, BUT I TELL YOU THAT DAY SOMETHING SPOKE WITHIN ME. WHEN THEY WANTED TO HEAR A SPEAKER, I'M NOT TOO MUCH OF A SPEAKER. HE SAID, "BUT WHEN I WANTED TO, IF THEY WANTED TO HEAR A SPEAKER, SOMETHING BELLOWED OUT OF ME AND SAID, "THIS IS THAT &gt;&gt; I IDENTIFIED THE AGE THAT I WAS LIVING IN. THIS IS THAT &gt;&gt; THAT THE PROPHET JOEL TALKS about &gt;&gt; within our church. We were so moved by the Holy Ghost. Forgive me for just going this way for a little while, &gt;&gt; but we were on our way to prayer. And there was a man that Jesus must have left. He was laying AND WE PASSED BY HIM AND HE ASKED US FOR ARMS. YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS AGO, WE WERE POWERLESS. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETHING MOVED INSIDE OF US &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE, BUT SUCH AS I HAVE GIVE I THEE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. RISE UP AND WALK." I TELL YOU THAT MAN LIMP AND AND STRENGTH CAME INTO HIS ANKLE BONES AND HE RAN INTO THE CITY &gt;&gt; AND CAUSED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRANDON SAID IN ACTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, HE SAID, HE SAID ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, HE SAID SATAN JUST SAT BACK AND WAITED. HE SAID, "BUT WHEN PETER, JAMES, AND JOHN WENT UP TO THAT MAN THAT WAS AT THE GATE AND SAID, WHEN THEY PROVED THAT THEY HAD WHAT THEY SAID THEY HAD, &gt;&gt; I want TO SAY THIS TO YOU. WHEN YOU PROVE THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE, WHEN IT COMES OFF OF THIS PAPER AND IT BECOMES A LIVING REALITY INSIDE OF YOU, THE DEVIL IS NOT SCARED OF QUOTES. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HE CARRIES ONE OF THESE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARMS REGULARLY. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THIS WORD AND YOU MAKE THIS WORD LIVE, &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL, &gt;&gt; EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL CAME AGAINST THEM." &gt;&gt; WELL, you say, "Well, Brother Ron, it was probably just for a select group." Well, there was a young man, his name was Steven. Not going to spend a lot of time here. He says, "But dear, Steven. He was a young man that had the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I'm a young man. I I'm not very old." I want you TO KNOW THIS AS WE SAID IT last night AND THE NIGHT BEFORE. WHAT GOD'S STRATEGY IS IS TO TAKE you and empty you out and fill you with THE HOLY GHOST AND THEN SHAKE THE WORLD WITH YOU. What world, BROTHER RON? YOUR WORLD. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL, WHERE YOU WHERE YOU LIVE AT, IN YOUR HOME, THERE SHOULD BE AN ATMOSPHERE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. TELL THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE SALTY. AND SOMEBODY WHEN THEY WALK INTO YOUR PRESENCE, THEY WANT WHAT YOU'VE GOT. OH, &gt;&gt; now in our church, I want to just kind of bring it up. In our church, there was a young lady that came to our church. She's actually my niece. She came and and she came to our vicinity and up up to to to she wasn't as close to the Lord as she needed to be. And so she came and she was dating a college boy in the town where I was living. And she was sitting across the table from me one day and and I spoke to her and I SAID, YOU KNOW, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT BOY COULD HAVE ANY GIRL, but I SAID, HE'S LOOKING FOR CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; And you don't HAVE TO LESSEN YOUR VALUES DOWN if he's looking for character. &gt;&gt; And if you get a REAL EXPERIENCE FOR YOURSELF, IF HE'S LOOKING FOR CHRIST, HE WILL COME TO THAT. COME ON. WE DON'T HAVE TO DIMINISH OUR VALUES. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO LOWER OUR STANDARDS. WE DON'T HAVE TO POLISH THIS THING UP FOR THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; IT'LL LIVE ON ITS OWN. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU THAT'S EXACTLY WE PRAYED WITH THAT YOUNG LADY AND THE LORD DEALT A REAL MOVE OF THE SUPERNATURAL IN her life. That young man came TO OUR HOUSE ONE NIGHT AND HE WAS TALKING TO ME TO ME ONE DAY AND HE SAYS, "WELL, YOU KNOW," HE SAID, "I WANT TO TRY TO HELP GET THIS young lady out of this cult." I said, "Good. I think that's good. You ought to do that. &gt;&gt; If you care for her at all, that's something you ought to do." And he was A BRETHREN BOY. HIS PARENTS WERE HAD BEEN BRETHREN. His grandparents had been brethren FOR 400 YEARS. THEY HAD BEEN BRETHREN. AND SO HE HE PICKED UP THAT WE HAD had preached serpency. That brother Brandham HAD PREACHED SERPENCY. OH, HOW HE SEEMED SO ARMED TO FIGHT IT. &gt;&gt; I thought it was a good thing. YES. &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN I SAT HIM DOWN, I TOOK HIM RIGHT THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES AND I SHOWED THAT YOUNG MAN ABOUT WHERE IT STARTED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK HIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS AND HE HAD CAME TO SEE HER. BUT BY 1:00 IN THE MORNING, IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED ME THE NEXT MORNING. HE SAID, "I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT LONG." HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW I HAVE FOUGHT IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN ME, BUT I SEE IT." &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND HERE'S A PICTURE I WANT TO TELL YOU. 400 YEARS AGO, HE HAD A GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDDADDY. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS HANS LANDIS. AND HE WAS A PART OF A MOVEMENT THAT MOVED OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THEY BELIEVED IN WATER BAPTISM IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVED IN ONE GOD. THEY BELIEVED SERPENT seat &gt;&gt; over 400 years ago. AND HE AND HE WAS STANDING THERE AND YOU CAN GO BACK AND READ IT IN THE MARTYR'S MIRROR. AND HE'S STANDING THERE BEFORE HIS EXECUTIONER. AND HE WAS STANDING THERE AND HIS EXECUTIONER SAYS, "DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO SAY?" HE SAID, "I PREACHED THIS WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN ME. I'VE SPENT ALL OF MY ENERGY, MY WHOLE LIFE BELIEVING WHAT I BELIEVE. I AM PROUD TO DIE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS TO YOU. GOD RECOGNIZED THAT LIFE, HE WOULDN'T LET IT DIE. &gt;&gt; The executioner WAS SO CONVICTED BY THE POWER OF GOD, he turned to HIM AND HE SAID, "I ASK YOU." HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO RUN. I'M GOING TO LAY MY AXE DOWN. I WANT YOU TO RUN AND I WILL NOT FOLLOW YOU. HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT. PETER DIED FOR THIS. PAUL DIED FOR THIS. IREANIUS DIED FOR THIS. POLYCARP DIED FOR THIS. AND I AM READY TO DIE FOR THIS. THAT EXECUTIONER DID HIS JOB. AND WHEN HE FINISHED, HE PICKED UP HIS BIBLE AND SAID, "SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO TAKE HIS PLACE. IT MAY AS WELL BE ME." &gt;&gt; NOW, &gt;&gt; now his father came to OUR CHURCH AND HE WAS KIND OF CONCERNED about this message. AND SO HE GOT TO PRAYING ABOUT THE WORD AND YOU KNOW WAS THIS FOR HIM. SO HE GOT REAL DILIGENT BEFORE THE LORD. HE AND HE JUST PICKED A CERTAIN DAY. GOD, I WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO ME TODAY. I want to MEET A MAN THAT HAS MET WILLIAM BRHAM. Tall order. tall order runs a heating and air business. HE WAS SITTING IN HIS OFFICE JUST REALLY CONTEMPLATING THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND AS HE WAS SITTING THERE, THERE WAS A preacher that was THAT HAD A A PROBLEM WITH HIS AIR CONDITION. SO HE STORMS IN HIS OFFICE AND HE SAYS, "I HAVE A PROBLEM." AND BOB SAYS, "SO DO I." HE SAID, "MY PROBLEM IS," HE SAYS, "WITH MY HEATING AND AIR." HE SAID, "IT'S NOT WORKING." HE SAYS, "I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS MAN NAMED WILLIAM BROWN." EVER HEARD OF HIM? HE SAID, "SURE." I STOOD IN THE PRAYER LINE. HE SAID, "I STOOD THERE AND HE SAID, THERE'S A TAPE OF ME STANDING THERE IN DEEP CALLETH TO THE DEEP." HE SAID, "I'M THE LAST MAN IN THE PRAYER LINE." HE SAID, "BROTHER RAM TOLD ME, I'M NOT THERE FOR MYSELF. I'M THERE FOR REVIVAL IN MY CHURCH." OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'S THE ONLY REVIVAL WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR CHURCH &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SUPERNATURAL WAS THAT ONE REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; WELL, BOB SAYS, HE SAYS, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. THEY SAY AN ANGEL WAS WITH HIM. HE SAID, ABSOLUTELY COMMON KNOWLEDGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAW THE ANGEL. HE SAID, "BUT THAT'S NOT FIXING MY HEAT AND AIR." HE SAID, "BUT YOU JUST FIXED MY PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; 400 YEARS GOD DID NOT FORGET." &gt;&gt; 400 YEARS. GOD DID NOT FORGET. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM MENTIONS MEN LIKE PETER CARTWRIGHT. HE MENTIONS MEN LIKE JONATHAN GFORD. &gt;&gt; He mentions, YOU KNOW, IN OUR OUR LOCAL AREA, THERE WAS A MAN LIKE ROBERT SHEFFY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF HIM, BUT ROBERT SHEFFREY CAUGHT THE ANOINTING of John Wesley. &gt;&gt; You see, THAT WICK WAS CHRIST. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THESE MEN NEVER MET THE MESSENGER, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WIT, THAT ANOINTING POURED DOWN INTO THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AND THAT ANOINTING POURED OVER INTO THEIR LIVES AND THEY CAUGHT THE REVELATION OF THE HOUR. SIR, &gt;&gt; I'M BUILDING. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I know you're going to enjoy this. &gt;&gt; HE MAY HAVE NEVER MET JOHN WESLEY. HE MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ROCKED JOHN WESLEY AND HE SAID, "TODAY I WAS STONED AND LEFT FOR DEAD. TODAY I PREACHED TO 10,000 PEOPLE AND A HAIL STORM CAME, BUT THE HOLY GHOST WAS SO GREAT. THOUSANDS OF THEM FELL UNDER THE DYNAMICS OF THE HOLY GHOST. I TRIED TO GET THEM TO GO HOME, BUT THEY WERE SO INSPIRED BY THE WORD." HE MAY HAVE NEVER MET THAT MAN, BUT I'LL TELL YOU, THE HOLY GHOST WAS SO REAL IN HIS LIFE &gt;&gt; TILL HE SHOOK THE AREA WHERE I LIVE AND THE SURROUNDING STATES WITH THE DYNAMICS OF THE HOLY GHOST. I WANT TO JUST TELL you it was during the days of prohibition and he asked God at many a steel THAT GOD WOULD SEND A MIGHTY oak tree OFF OF THE SIDES OF THOSE mountains and ROLL OFF OF THOSE MOUNTAINS AND CRUSH THAT STEEL IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. NOT ONE TIME, BUT A RECORDED 10 TIMES THAT IT TOOK PLACE THAT GOD WOULD SEND A LIGHTNING BOLT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND CRUSH THAT DEMONIC STEEL. &gt;&gt; AND MANY OF THOSE GUYS THAT WERE MAKING THAT LIQUOR BECAME PREACHERS WHEN THEY SAW THE ANOINTING OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. WELL, you say, "Well, brother, that was that was John Wesley's day. That was under that was under Luther's day. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER THE MESSENGER OF YOUR DAY? &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you. Is this all right? &gt;&gt; You've been a kind congregation to me. I'm sure I didn't ask brother Eddie before this service, but I'm just going to go this way and he can get mad at me and toss me out if he wants to. I'm sure there were a LOT OF PREACHERS SITTING ON THE PLATFORM THAT REALLY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD THIS STUFF &gt;&gt; THAT THOUGHT THEY WERE THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE WORLD. AND HERE STANDS A LITTLE MAN BEHIND THE PULL PIT SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HE BEGINS TO EXPLAIN HOW THAT GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE THEY WERE THINKING THERE JUST FOR A MOMENT. AND HE STEPS BACK AND HE SAYS, "I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW THAT GOD ROLLED THE SOLAR SYSTEM INTO EXISTENCE." &gt;&gt; I'm sure they punched one another said, "This is going to be good. And he begins to go, a tiny little white light came, a halo of light. And he spoke from out of that halo of light. AND HE SAID, "LET there be a sun." AND HE SAID, "THAT SUN CAME INTO EXISTENCE." AND HE SAID, "THEN FROM THAT," HE SAID, "GOD ALLOWED A CLINKER TO FALL OFF OF THAT SUN." &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID IT ALLOWED IT TO FALL FROM MILLIONS OF YEARS. &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD WAS WRITING HIS FIRST BIBLE. YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LIKED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRAB THE HOLD OF THE, YOU KNOW, HIM AND SAY, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU TEACH US ALGEBRA AND HE'S TELLING THEM, YOU CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND YOUR ABCS. &gt;&gt; HE'S THEY'RE WANTING TO KNOW THE DEEP MYSTERIES OF GOD. AND HERE HE'S STANDING THERE IN IN IN SERMONS AND WHO IS JESUS? AND HE BEGINS TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT A MAN NAMED ZAKIUS. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOME OF THE GREATEST BUSINESSMEN AND PREACHERS ON THE SCENE. AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT A MAN NAMED ZAKIUS &gt;&gt; WITH TRASH ALL OVER HIM. &gt;&gt; SITTING THERE totally embarrassed. &gt;&gt; AND THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT JESUS WAS BEING MADE FLESH &gt;&gt; AND UNVEILING HIMSELF STANDING BEFORE THEM. NOT IN THE MAN WAY OF BRUM, BUT IN THE WORD. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS UNFOLDING HIMSELF TO THEM, BUT THEY DIDN'T CATCH IT. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; But God don't leave his earth without a witness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I went back and listened to it several places. Brother Brandham would say, "We have a young boy here, young man here that's a missionary to the Indians." Where you at, brother Eddie? &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get points for brother Eddie. &gt;&gt; I'm getting here to get points with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And there all those preachers SITTING AROUND WHO IS THIS GUY? &gt;&gt; Who is this guy? &gt;&gt; Who is this boy? &gt;&gt; Who is this guy coming on the scene? &gt;&gt; COME UP HERE AND SIT ON THE PLATFORM. YOU'RE BACK IN THE AMEN CORNER. COME UP HERE. AND I'M SURE PROBABLY AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO HERE. PROBABLY SOME OF THEM ARE THINKING, "WHY DIDN'T HE CALL MY NAME? &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; I'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS, BUT GOD KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH." &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD HAVE YOUNG MEN TO CATCH THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. LISTEN, WE DON'T NEED PERSONALITIES OF MEN. THEY WOULD PUT THIS WORD FIRST. THE REVEALING OF JESUS CHRIST FIRST. IT WOULD BE FIRST PLACE IN THEIR LIVES. THEY WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS CHRIST. LISTEN, IF WE COULD HEAR THEM SCREAMING FROM THE ANTICIPATION FROM ANOTHER REALM TONIGHT, THEY WENT TO THEIR GRAVES. THEY WENT TO THEIR GRAVE SCREAMING, LOOKING FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. IF WE COULD HEAR THEM TONIGHT, THEY'RE SCREAMING TO US, "PRESS ON. &gt;&gt; We have a mandate from GOD AS MEN OF GOD &gt;&gt; TO KEEP THIS message pure, &gt;&gt; TO KEEP THIS MESSAGE HOLY." BROTHER RON, YOU GUYS PREACH THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER. YES, &gt;&gt; WE'RE GUILTY. WE JUST COME FROM IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES. WE TURN THE DIAMOND AROUND AND TURN THE DIAMOND AROUND AND TURN THE DIAMOND AROUND. AND GOD SENDS THE DIFFERENT GIFTS AND THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. AND HE HAS TEACHERS AND HE HAS EVANGELISTS. HE HAS PASTORS. EVERY ONE OF THEM WITH THE CAPACITY OF A GIFT INSIDE OF THEIR LIFE TO SAY IT MAYBE IN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT WAY. &gt;&gt; MAYBE TO COOK YOUR PATO JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OR TO COOK YOUR STEAK JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT SOMEWHERE GOD IS GOING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. And brother RANDOM SAID, HE SAID THAT MICHELANGELO, &gt;&gt; HE SAID MICHELANGELO SPENT 44 YEARS, 44 YEARS WORKING ON THE SAME PIECE OF ROCK. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A VISION THAT WAS WITHIN HIS MIND. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BUILDING AND HE WAS WORKING. &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THERE WERE NOT DAYS THAT HE FELT LIKE QUITTING? DO YOU THINK THERE WERE DAYS THAT HE LAID THAT HAMMER DOWN AND SAID, "I'LL NEVER PICK IT UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I'M SO TIRED. I'M SO WORE OUT. I'VE LOOKED AT THAT ROCK. I'VE LOOKED AT THAT EXCESS. I'VE LOOKED AT HIS BEARD. I'VE LOOKED IN HIS EYES." &gt;&gt; You think HE DIDN'T GET TIRED? HE DIDN'T GET WORE OUT. OH, YES, HE DID. &gt;&gt; BUT ONE DAY HE WAS STANDING THERE. ONE DAY HE WAS STANDING THERE AND THE VISION BECAME A REALITY. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND ALL OF THOSE YEARS. WHAT HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALL OF THOSE YEARS WAS SITTING BEFORE HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS DOWN INSIDE OF HIM. LISTEN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE STRIKE ON THE KNEE IS WHAT MADE IT A MASTERPIECE TO HIM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING AT IT FROM MORE THAN JUST AN artist point of view. &gt;&gt; God has been working on a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; WHAT PAUL LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON A CHOP BLOCK FOR. &gt;&gt; WHAT PETER WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN ON A CROSS FOR. &gt;&gt; WHAT MEN DIED. WHAT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WERE BURNT FOR, WHAT THEY WERE EAT BY LIONS FOR. &gt;&gt; They didn't do IT IN SOME CHICKEN-HEARTED WAY, BROTHER ERNIE. &gt;&gt; They did it with every bit of energy, &gt;&gt; with every BIT OF DETERMINATION. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WILLING. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THEY WASN'T CONCERNED THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T SHAKE THEIR HAND. THEY WASN'T CONCERNED IF THEY WASN'T THE FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WHOLE CHURCH. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ANCHORED IN THEIR HEART. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. THEY WERE AT WAR WITH THOSE HORSE RIDERS. THEY WAS AT WAR WITH THOSE DEMON SPIRITS. AND IT WAS SOMETHING INSIDE OF THEM THAT THEY WOULD OVERCOME. Brother Am says THIS, "A MOMENTARY CONSIDERATION OF CHURCH HISTORY WILL prove how accurate the thought is. In the dark ages, the word WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY LOST TO THE PEOPLE. BUT GOD SENT LUTHER WITH THE WORD AND THE LUTHERAN SPOKE FOR GOD AT THAT TIME. BUT THEY ORGANIZED AND AGAIN THE PURE WORD WAS LOST FOR ORGANIZATION AND IT TENDS TOWARDS DOGMAS AND CREEDS AND NOT A SIMPLE WORD AND THEY NO LONGER COULD NO LONGER SPEAK FOR GOD. THEN GOD SENT WESLEY AND HE WAS THE VOICE FOR THIS DAY OF THE WORD FOR HIS DAY. AND THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK HIS REVELATION FROM GOD BEGIN TO BEGIN TO BECAME LIVING EPISTLES READY AND KNOWN. &gt;&gt; LIVING EPISTLES READ AND KNOWN. Their name may NOT BE FOUND IN OUR BOOK, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY'RE STANDING THERE. &gt;&gt; He says, "When the Methodist FAILED, GOD RAISED UP OTHERS ALSO. And so it has gone THROUGH THE YEARS UNTIL THIS LAST DAY. AND THERE IS AGAIN another people &gt;&gt; in the land &gt;&gt; who under their messengers &gt;&gt; WILL BE &gt;&gt; THE FINAL VOICE &gt;&gt; TO THE FINAL EDGE. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE? &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. I'M SO GLAD THAT I CAN SAY I'M ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; There was a first CHIEF WAVE THAT CAME UP FROM ALL THE PROPHETS, which was the son of God, THE KING OF ALL THE PROPHETS. There has been churches, CHURCHES, AND BRIDES, BRIDES, &gt;&gt; CHURCHES, BRIDES, BRIDES. BUT THERE HAS GOT TO COME ONE. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WAITING ON YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I can't HARDLY WAIT FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. YOU THINK YOU CAN'T WAIT. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE EXCITED TONIGHT ABOUT THE COMING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS BEEN WAITING ON &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT THE ETERNITIES HE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; 6,000 YEARS HE'S FOUGHT. HE HAS BEEN DETERMINED. HE HAS NOT QUIT. &gt;&gt; HE PRE-PLANNED YOU. HE LAID YOU OUT LIKE A WHAT A CONTRACTOR WOULD DO. HE KNEW WHAT AGE THAT YOU WOULD BE BORN HERE. &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, GOD DON'T CARE ABOUT ME." I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT. HE LOVED YOU. ROMANS 5 SAID HE LOVED YOU WHILE YOU WERE YET A SINNER. &gt;&gt; HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WAS UNLOVABLE. HE LOVED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M THIS AND I'M THAT." LISTEN, HE KNEW WHAT HAIR COLOR YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT EYES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT BILL THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT NATURE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHAT PROBLEMS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT OBSTACLES YOU WOULD HAVE. AND IN SPITE OF ALL OF THAT, HE STILL CALLED YOU. BROTHER RON, I've never seen a miracle. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I'm redheaded. Yep. I'M 5'5. YEP. I'M TOO SHORT. I LOOK AT THIS FELL STANDING UP OVER HERE WHEN HE RAISES HIS HANDS LIKE THAT AND I SAY, "LORD, DON'T MAKE HIM FIGHT ME." &gt;&gt; BUT GOD KNEW HOW TALL I'D BE. &gt;&gt; BACK THROUGH THE GENERATIONS OF TIME, HE WATCHED OVER MY FOREFATHERS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRYING MY SEEDS. MAYBE THEY WERE FIGHTING IN WARS. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I just want to preach. &gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY WERE STANDING IN A WAR AND A SWORD GOES RIGHT BY THEIR SIDE AND GOD STOPPED THAT SWORD. &gt;&gt; MAYBE THERE WAS A BULLET WHO WENT OVER THEIR HEAD AND GOD TOOK THAT BULLET, MADE IT THIS GO LIKE THAT. CUZ THEY WERE CARRYING MY NATURAL STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD THIS ONE TO MARRY THAT ONE AND THIS ONE TO MARRY THIS ONE AND THIS ONE TO MARRY THIS ONE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY." ABSOLUTELY. YOU'RE ONE IN A MILLION. GOD DON'T NEED 10,000 TO IDENTIFY THAT YOU'RE THE ONE. &gt;&gt; ONE WOMAN NAMED MARY &gt;&gt; WAS STANDING THERE AND THE ANGEL SAID, "THOU ART BLESSED." &gt;&gt; GOD WAS WAITING ON HER WOMB TO ARRIVE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram, sit out there in that dark chaos of night. He said, "I see little lights." &gt;&gt; God knew you were coming. &gt;&gt; Some of you were drug addicts. &gt;&gt; Some of you were laying in beds of prostitution. &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU WERE DEEP ENTRENCHED IN DENOMINATIONALISM. &gt;&gt; Some of YOU WERE FETTERED IN DARKNESS OF SIN. BUT GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY, &gt;&gt; GOD BE TO SEND AN EAGLE OVER YOUR NEST AND HE BE TO SCREAM TO YOU AND YOU knew this JUST WASN'T ANOTHER PREACHER. THIS WASN'T JUST ANOTHER VOICE, BUT THERE WAS A VOICE THAT WAS BEHIND THE VOICE AND YOU HAD THIRSTED FOR SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE. MAYBE YOU CHANGED YOUR JOB 42 TIMES AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. BUT ONE DAY, GOD SPOKE TO YOUR HEART AND HE GAVE YOU TRUE DIRECTION. HE GAVE YOU TRUE HOPE. HE GAVE YOU TRUE UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH MICHELANGELO? YOU'RE PART of the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; There's got to come one. HE SAID THAT HAS THERE'S GOT TO COME A REAL BRIDE. There must be one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it. &gt;&gt; He said that makes the church live &gt;&gt; and move in the power of HIS RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE COME TO THAT PLACE, HE SAYS UNTIL WE FIND THAT PLACE, WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO POLISH THE HUMPS? WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO GIVE HER A FACEELIFT OR A SIMON'S JAW WHEN THERE'S NO DYNAMICS IN IT? THERE'S NO MATTER HOW MUCH MECHANICS YOU PROVE TO BE RIGHT. THERE'S GOT TO BE DYNAMICS TO MAKE IT WORK. HE SAID THAT'S WHAT HE PROVED. THAT'S WHAT EASTER PROVED. HE WASN'T ONLY THE WORD, BUT HE WAS GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THE DYNAMICS IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT MADE THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST COLD, STIFF, DEAD IN THE GRAVE, SHAKEN TO LIFE AND RISE AGAIN AND ROLL AWAY THE STONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Watch what HE SAYS. HE SAID HE WAS THE DYNAMIST TO PROVE IT. AND IF HE BEING THE GROOM, THE BRIDE HAS TO COME forth &gt;&gt; cuz it's PART OF HIM. &gt;&gt; IT CAN ONLY BE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FULFILLING OF ALL THE REVELATIONS AND OTHERS THAT SPOKE OF THE BRIDE. AND IT CAN ONLY MANIFEST. AND IF IT DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE GROOM, IT ISN'T THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S FLESH OF HIS FLESH, BONE OF HIS BONE, LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER. She is him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, I you just forgive me." But, you know, I've sat around church and I've never seen anything too blatantly miracle wise. Okay. Well, let me just stop here just for a moment and just give you a testimony. I grew up in a home that believed this message. My dad preached this message. And not only did he preach it, Brother Ernie, he lived it. &gt;&gt; We worked together in 1995 as chimney sweeps. I told you the other night how the Lord brought me into the chimney sweep business. And one day I was working and and he was away on another job and I was working and I slipped. I fell 40 feet. I landed on concrete. I didn't see no angels. I didn't hear no voices. I felt that concrete crush my back. IT CRUSHED MY BACK FROM THE UP HERE UP INTO MY RIGHT HERE NEXT TO MY SKULL all the way down. THEY TOOK ME TO A TRAUMA CENTER. THEY BEGIN TO X-RAY IT AND MRI IT AND DO ALL THE WORKS. AND THE DOCTOR CAME IN AND HE SPOKE TO ME and he said, "Mr. Spencer, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING." HE SAID, "YOUR BACK, EVERY VERTEBRAE IN YOUR back is broke. Four of them are completely crushed." You will AND AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND that if you can quickly realize this AND THE QUICKER YOU REALIZE IT AND COME TO TERMS WITH IT, THAT YOU WILL NEVER walk again. ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING SPOKE OUT OF MY HEART, BROTHER EDDIE. SO, I JUST SPOKE NOT WITH MY OWN POWER, BUT SOMETHING SPOKE TO THAT DOCTOR. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO. YOU'RE SITTING HERE TONIGHT AND YOU'RE SAYING, "BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T KNOW MY PROBLEMS." BUT IF YOU WOULD ONLY REALIZE WHO YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; IF YOU'D ONLY REALIZE IN ANOTHER DIMENSION THERE ARE PEOPLE SCREAMING &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO COME TO YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY THIS WEARY CAMP ABOUT WITH SO GREAT A CLOUD OF WITNESSES. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A BRIDE. LORD, MAY IT BE THIS CAMP THAT YOU DECIDE IN YOURSELF, IN YOUR OWN SELF. AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER RON, BUT I SEE THIS IS WRONG AND THAT IS WRONG AND THIS IS WRONG AND THIS IS WRONG WITH THAT PERSON AND THIS IS WRONG WITH THAT PREACHER." BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? GET THAT OUT OF YOU AND GOD WILL MAKE EVERYTHING WORK OUT FOR YOU, &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON. WE NEED A REVIVAL IN OUR CHURCH. LET IT START WITH YOU. JOHN SMITH PRAYED SO HARD FOR REVIVAL IN THAT CHURCH UNTIL HIS EYES SWELL SHUT. HIS WIFE WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE TO THE TABLE AND FEED HIM. BUT THERE WAS A LONGING IN HIS HEART FOR A REAL MOVE OF A REVIVAL IN THAT BAPTIST CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN THIRST, HE SAID MAYBE NOBODY IN THAT CHURCH IS LOOKING FOR REVIVAL. HE SAID, "LET IT BREAK OUT IN YOU." &gt;&gt; My little dad came in. Forgive me for saying it like this, but I didn't need somebody to pray some pretty words. I needed somebody &gt;&gt; that to pray some faith &gt;&gt; when I couldn't pray it for myself. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETIMES YOU GET TO A SPOT IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN'T DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO PRAY EVEN FOR YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. BROTHER RON, I DON'T NEED A PASTOR. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. YOU NEED ONE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED ONE. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; God ordained THAT MAN TO SEE YOU THROUGH. &gt;&gt; He can stand there and WEIGH THE THINGS OUT. WHEN ALL HELL'S AGAINST YOU, HE'LL BE AT YOUR SIDE. WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GIVE UP ON YOU, HE'LL STAND THERE WITH YOU BECAUSE OF THAT GIFT THAT'S LAYING INSIDE OF HIS LIFE. WHEN NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS, HE UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE IT'S CHRIST INSIDE OF HIM THAT'S WATCHING OUT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; My daddy walked in there and they HAD ME WRAPPED UP LIKE A MUMMY. I WAS LAYING ON THAT BED and pain FROM MY RIB CAGE UP WAS UNBEARABLE. I TELL YOU WHAT, MY DAD WALKED IN AND I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS PRAYER AS HE BE TO PRAY. HE SAID, "GOD, &gt;&gt; I AM YOUR SON. &gt;&gt; I AM YOUR SON AND THIS IS MY SON &gt;&gt; AND YOU COMMISSION ME TO LAY HANDS ON THE SICK." COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; IT COMES TO YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PREACHER'S NOT AROUND AND THE DEACONS IS NOT AROUND, MAMA, YOU CAN LAY YOUR HANDS ON THOSE CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON HER, WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH, I'll tell you what, within an hour, &gt;&gt; that doctor came in there and I felt pain go all the way TO MY FEET. WITHIN AN HOUR, THE SAME MAN THAT TOLD ME I'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN, HE SAID, "WE HAVE WITNESSED a miracle. And every DAY I PUT MY FEET ON THE FLOOR, I SAID, "DEVIL, &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL WALK. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM STILL AFTER YOU. &gt;&gt; I AM STILL YOUR WORST ENEMY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT THIS THING BACKWARDS. WE SIT HERE AND SAY, "OH, THE DEVIL'S TORMENTING ME. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S WORRYING ME." I'VE GOT NEWS for you. &gt;&gt; I WAS SENT HERE TO TORMENT HIM. Brother Ron, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO WALK ON STREETS OF GOLD. YES, I'M I'M GLAD FOR THAT, TOO, &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE BODY CHANGE. I I AGREE WITH THAT, TOO. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW BETWEEN HERE AND THEN &gt;&gt; BETWEEN HERE AND THEN. YEAH, &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HATE HIM &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO HATE ME. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN PAPER. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN JUST POETRY AND GOOD SERMONS PUT TOGETHER. BUT I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST TO THIS GENERATION. AND I BELIEVE IT LIVES. AND I BELIEVE THIS B IS BORN. LIFE OF HIS LIFE. POWER OF HIS POWER. I BELIEVE IT LIVES IN ME. I BELIEVE IT LIVES IN YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Anything I hate to see is a spineless person that calls himself a Christian. GOD WANTS SOMEBODY WITH GRIT AND BACKBONE. &gt;&gt; LIKE OLD BUDDY ROBINSON SAID, "LORD, GIVE ME THE BACKBONE THE SIZE OF A SAW. PUT PLENTY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE GABLE END OF MY SOUL." HE SAYS, "LET ME FIGHT THE DEVIL TILL THE AS LONG AS I'VE GOT A TOOTH AND AND THEN I'LL GUM HIM TO DEATH UNTIL I DIE. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HE PREACHED IT TO ME IN 1983. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Your fault. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. HE'S GETTING GRAYHEADED. I TELL YOU WHAT, HE'S PREACHING BETTER NOW THAN WHAT HE DID IN ' 83. Let me TELL YOU ONE REASON WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HERE PULLING ON THAT GIFT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, WHY IS THIS CAMP MEETING BETTER? BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY ARE YOU HERE, HE'S HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER RON, I WISH I COULD SEE HIM. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. HE'S HERE. HE WAS HERE BEFORE YOU EVER WALKED IN THE TENT. HE WAS INVITED EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND HE HAS NOT LEFT THE BUILDING. BOY, I was wore out this morning. &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING. THERE'S SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; I was laying in that hospital in May. And on that night, I'LL JUST TELL YOU FOR THOSE THAT haven't been here, I had a stroke in May. I was walking through the yard. I didn't know what happened to me, but I had a stroke. Long of it all, ABOUT THE FOURTH DAY IN THE HOSPITAL. I was laying there with MY LEFT SIDE VERY WEAKENED. I WAS SICK. EVERY TIME I'D ROLL MY HEAD OVER, I THROW UP. Somewhere around the fourth night, I was praying. There was a special presence came into the room. &gt;&gt; Not concerned whether you believe that or not, &gt;&gt; but he came in the room. I'm not trying TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF MYSELF. Cuz listen, I PUT MY FINGER IN A BUCKET OF WATER, PULL IT OUT, AND FIND A HOLE. THAT'S HOW THAT'S WHAT I AM. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I'LL LEAVE THIS MEETING. I'LL GO BACK TO A LITTLE CABIN THAT'S A MILE OFF OF THE ROAD. HARDLY NOBODY KNOWS MY NAME, &gt;&gt; BUT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; BUT I WAS LAYING THERE AND I AM HIS SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS I WAS LAYING THERE AND I WAS PRAYING, I FELT THAT PRESENCE OF THE LORD COME IN. DON'T YOU THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THE DEVIL HADN'T TRIED TO FILL ME WITH DOUBT AND FILL ME WITH FEAR AND TELL ME THAT THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE HAD STROKES THAT NEVER GOT BACK OUT OF THE BED, NEVER GOT THEIR STRENGTH BACK, NEVER GOT THEIR THEIR VOCAL CORDS BACK IN THE RIGHT ORDER, &gt;&gt; NEVER GOT THEIR EYES BACK THE RIGHT WAY. AND THAT DEVIL WAS WHISPERING IN MY EAR THE VERY SAME WORDS. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, ON THAT SPECIAL NIGHT, GOD CAME INTO THAT ROOM. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU HOW STRONG IT WAS. THERE WAS A NURSE. IT WAS HER FIRST NIGHT ON DUTY. OTHER NURSES KNEW THAT I WAS A MINISTER. THEY HAD SEEN THE PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT, IN AND OUT, AND SHE WAS WORKING ONLY A THREE-HOUR SHIFT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND SHE WALKS IN WITH A FLASHLIGHT CUZ I'M LIGHT SENSITIVE. AND SHE WALKS IN WITH A FLASHLIGHT TO CHECK ALL OF MY MY VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK MY STRENGTH IN MY left side. AND AS SHE WAS WORKING, SHE SAID, "MR. SPENCER." And I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said, "Have you been praying?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said, "I'm not a Christian." She said, "BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED to be." &gt;&gt; She said, "They told me that you're a preacher, AND WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR, I FELT SOMETHING." THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU, BRAD. THERE'S A LIFE THAT JUST FLOWS OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Right there, SHE GOT TO THE SIDE OF HER BED. SHE GOT DOWN ON HER KNEES AND SHE BE TO CALL ON THE LORD, "FATHER, FORGIVE ME." I HEARD HER SNIFFLING EVEN BEFORE THAT SHE EVEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AWAKE. THE PRESENCE OF GOD WAS ALREADY WORKING ON HER LIFE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he's real. &gt;&gt; I QUOTED TO YOU EARLIER THAT GABRIEL SIT ON MOSES'S ARK. &gt;&gt; AND I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. ANGELS ARE WATCHING OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THE SAINTS OF ALL THE AGES STAND &gt;&gt; JUST ANTICIPATING WHAT COULD GO ON in a meeting like this. You say, "Oh, brother Ron, but the scripture says greater works &gt;&gt; shall you do." &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALREADY SAW THAT THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT. &gt;&gt; Lives have been eternally changed. He said, "THERE'S THE BODY OF CHRIST LIVING, STANDING, REDEEMED, justified in his sight." WHY ARE WE JUSTIFIED? WE ARE HIS VICTORY. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE CHRIST'S VICTORY? RUB YOUR SHOULDERS. WHAT DID HE OVERCOME IN THIS DAY? DRUGS, &gt;&gt; ALCOHOL, DENOMINATIONALISM. &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS HIS VICTORY. WE COME FORTH IN THESE LAST DAYS WITH THIS GLORIOUS GOSPEL SHOWING HIS VICTORY. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST OUR VICTORY, HIS VICTORY. Can I read you one more quote? &gt;&gt; Boy, it's hot up here. Brother Brandham is praying. Heavenly Father, as we read of the Bible of what you said about sin and those who do it and not confess, we realize what it means to die without knowing God. Do we know that by an experience of others that we sing goal, those who intended and not possessed and said and had not possessed what they said they had. THOSE WHO ACTED LIKE Christians yet never was a Christian, their life proved it and their death made it manifest. Now, Father, I pray that you'll speak to every heart here tonight and myself, Lord, for being dilatory for many things that I could have done and did not do. I confess my wrong. I confess the wrongs of this people. I confess the wrongs of this nation. I ask you to have mercy. &gt;&gt; I've got three children to raise. We're living here in a hot spot, God. There's no need of running. We know about it, God. I know. I want to be right with you. &gt;&gt; Someday if the atomic bomb don't get us, a wreck will. If a rat don't get us, some disease, WELL, SOMETHING HAS got to take us. But we're so happy TO KNOW THERE IS A WAY OF ESCAPE. &gt;&gt; The name of the LORD IS A STRONG TOWER AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN into &gt;&gt; and are safe. &gt;&gt; God, MAY EVERY SINNER FRIEND TONIGHT, BOY, GIRL, MAN, WOMAN, SEE THE OPEN DOOR, THE OPPORTUNITY, AND RUN TO CHRIST THIS HOUR. HE SAID, "While we HAVE OUR HEADS BOWED, IS THERE SOME OF that would like to say an UPLIFTED HAND TO GOD, I'M ASHAMED OF my life? I want to CONFESS MY WRONGS BEFORE GOD AND ASK GOD FOR MERCY." SO, Brother Ron, why are you doing this? He's going to preach a sermon. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. There's many of you. There's many of you here tonight. God bless you. Many of you who've professed Christianity for a long time and know that you have failed to tow the line with God. &gt;&gt; I pray that this is more than a quote to some of you. &gt;&gt; Know that YOU'RE DOING THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO do and you're going to confess unconfessing them. just loosely floating along with the tide looking at a kind of programs that you should not look at looking at the kind of magazines and reading literature that you should not read. &gt;&gt; That's not becoming TO CHRISTIANS LISTENING TO THE JOKES foul foul dirt smut that you shouldn't do. &gt;&gt; Both men AND WOMEN YOU KNOW THE PLACES THAT YOU SPOKE AND DID NOT DO it &gt;&gt; and you're guilty of the sin OF OMISSION. AND I WONDER IF YOU'D RAISE YOUR HAND TO HAVE CHRIST'S MERCY UPON YOU and forgive you. HE SAID, AS THE WOMAN WALKS OUT TO COME TO THE ALTAR TO CONFESS your her sins, he says, RAISE YOUR HANDS TO GOD, BUD. GOD BLESS YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right, MISTER. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD BLESS YOU. RAISE your hands. YOU KNOW YOU'VE done wrong. &gt;&gt; I wonder if YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TONIGHT TO MEET AT THE ALTAR AND KNEEL DOWN HERE AND SAY, "GOD, BE MERCIFUL TO US. WE'RE IN NEED OF YOU. TO SEE THESE YOUNG WOMEN COMING weeping life before them. They're at a crossroad. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE, OH MEN, THAT WE WERE ONCE BOYS? &gt;&gt; OUR BOYS HAS GOT 10 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT WE HAD. SISTER, DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR DAUGHTER HAS 10 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOU HAVE? &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD HER DAUGHTER HAVE? LOOK AT THE PICTURES THE DEVIL'S PAINTING. &gt;&gt; OH, HOW WE NEED TO PRAY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, DO YOU REALIZE WE DON'T PRAY HALF AS MUCH AS YOUR FATHERS DID? &gt;&gt; PASTOR, DO YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T PRAY PUT AS MUCH TIME ON OUR KNEES AS THE PASTORS BEFORE US DID? WOMEN, DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T INSTRUCT YOUR DAUGHTER AND PRAY AT NIGHT LIKE YOUR MOTHER DID YOU? &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT ABOUT IT? WHO'S GUILTY? &gt;&gt; WE'RE GUILTY. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT. WE'RE GUILTY. I'M GUILTY. &gt;&gt; I'M GUILTY OF NOT DOING THE JOB LIKE GOD LIKE I SHOULD DO. I'M CONFESSING IT THAT I'M WRONG. I'M ASKING GOD TO BE MERCIFUL ME TO ME. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER ROWAN, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CANDLESTICKS? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE REVELATIONS ONE? IT'S YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; THEY RUN THE RACE. THEY DID IT WITH ALL THEIR ENERGY. NOW IT'S OUR TURN. LET US LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT, EVERY SIN WHICH DOES SO EASILY BESET US. LET US RUN THIS RACE WITH PATIENCE. THE RACE THAT IS SET BEFORE US. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT 10 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT I HAD. &gt;&gt; 100 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD. A THOUSAND TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD. &gt;&gt; 10,000 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD. &gt;&gt; God help us tonight. &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TONIGHT. OH MY, BROTHER. GOD'S MOVED THE LAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE SPOKE TO YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU CAN'T BLAME NOBODY ELSE FOR YOUR PROBLEMS. BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH AS A CHILD. LET ME JUST SAY WE'VE ALL HAD PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALL WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALL WENT THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE TEMPTATION. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PUT US ALL THROUGH THE GRINDING MILL. &gt;&gt; HE'S GROUND US. &gt;&gt; HE'S MOLDED US. ME, YOU. &gt;&gt; He left Jesus alone in the garden of Eden, Garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO FATHER OR MOTHER, NO SISTERS OR BROTHERS, NO POWER, NO PASTOR AROUND. &gt;&gt; HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR YOU TO WORK IT OUT WITH GOD, &gt;&gt; TO COME TO THAT PLACE WITH GOD. I PRAY TO GOD THAT GOD SO SHAKES OUR WORLD TONIGHT. SO SHAKES OUR WORLD. LIKE JOHN SAID, "LET THE AXE BE LAID TO THE ROOT OF THE TREE." &gt;&gt; I PRAY OUR TREE GETS SO SHOOK TONIGHT &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE FIND OURSELVES. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, WHY ARE YOU PREACHING like this? I'm trying to close, but something's not letting me. We've had too much Hollywood evangelism. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE BEST SINGERS IN THE WORLD. THANK GOD FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TALENT THAT THE WORLD KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE BEST PREACHERS THAT EVER PUT THEIR PRETTY FEET DOWN INSIDE A SHOE LEATHER. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN ALL OF THAT. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU GETTING ALONG WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; The devil's not scared of our singing. &gt;&gt; He's not scared of our our music. Brother John, &gt;&gt; he's not even scared of our preaching. cuz he transforms himself as an angel of light. &gt;&gt; Listen, Methodists don't deceive us. &gt;&gt; Baptists don't deceive us. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DECEASES IS WHEN THOSE LITTLE FOXES CLIMB RIGHT UP INTO OUR CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AND WE GET COMFORTABLE SITTING ON OUR PEW AND FORGET THAT WE'VE GOT MORE MORE DEMONS, MORE TEMPTATION. OUR CHILDREN, WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR THEM. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE TONIGHT. I'M NOT ONLY FIGHTING FOR THE CHILDREN, BUT I'M FIGHTING FOR SOME HOMES. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M SO BUSY WORKING." LET ME JUST SAY, YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN TAKE DAYS OFF AND GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE TELL GOD, "GOD, I NEED A VACATION." AND WE'LL TAKE A VACATION FROM CHURCH. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, TAKE VACATIONS FROM WORK. TAKE VACATIONS FROM YOUR PART-TIME JOB, BUT DON'T TAKE VACATIONS FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I need a LITTLE TIME OFF. IT'S BECAUSE HE SO PUT IT AGAINST US. AND WE'LL TAKE TIME OFF AND WE'LL GO STAND IN THE LINE WITH 14,000 OTHER PEOPLE &gt;&gt; looking for the same spot. &gt;&gt; Listen, there is a refuge. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A PLACE THAT WE CAN RUN TO. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE'S A VERY GOOD PLACE. A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND A RENEWAL, &gt;&gt; A RE-ENERGIZING. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, IF I WALK TO THE ALTAR, PEOPLE THINK I'M BACKSLID. OH, NO. YOU JUST COME WANTING MORE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I look out here and see the opportunities I've missed because of petty things. &gt;&gt; Imagine that rich young ruler could say that tonight. I preach funerals and look in the casket and I think of the petty things that caused them not to be Christians. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was a habit that they put in their pocket. &gt;&gt; Maybe it WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY DRANK THROUGH A BOTTLE. Maybe it was a woman. &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT WAS A MAN. &gt;&gt; Lock could also give us a testimony service tonight. &gt;&gt; HOWARD HUGHES COULD ALSO GIVE US A TESTIMONY service tonight. THE RICH YOUNG RULER COULD GIVE US A TESTIMONY service tonight. &gt;&gt; That's right. Elvis Presley stood in his granddaddy's tent, probably something like this and played music as his granddaddy would preach and confess that he was filled with the Holy Ghost. But he sold it out. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's the little foxes that get the vine. &gt;&gt; Something just slipped up. I don't even know why I'm going this way tonight, but maybe something's pulling. &gt;&gt; I intended to go a complete different direction. I prayed I prayed for weeks at this sermon, but something's pulled me in this direction tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If Elvis Presley could stand here tonight, &gt;&gt; Cadillacs wouldn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; BEING THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL WOULD NOT MEAN ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; I SAY YOU TONIGHT, BEING THE CEO OF A COMPANY DON'T MEAN MUCH. &gt;&gt; HAVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DON'T MEAN MUCH. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LO IF YOU GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOSE YOUR SOUL, BROTHER RON, BUT MY FRIENDS WILL LEAVE ME. IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE LEADING YOU TO HELL AND THEY'RE THE WRONG INFLUENCE, THEY'RE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; BUT, Brother Ryan, I'M AFTER A BOY. I'M AFTER A GIRL. AND IF I REALLY DEDICATE MY HEART TO GOD, I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. GOD WILL GIVE YOU A BOY, HE'LL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT KIND OF A GIRL. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOUR CHARACTER IS PULLING YOU AFTER THE WRONG KIND OF A GIRL, YOU NEED TO RECHECK YOUR CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; IF IF IF WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART TICK, &gt;&gt; IF A SERVICE LIKE THIS DON'T MAKE YOUR HEART TICK, YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY MAKES YOUR HEART TICK. IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THE WORLD OR SOMETHING LACKING, &gt;&gt; I'm a hunter, but I don't let hunting come between me and God. &gt;&gt; I've made good money in life, BUT I'VE NEVER LET MONEY COME BETWEEN ME AND GOD. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. It's nice to HAVE A GOOD HOME, &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET A GOOD HOME BECOME BETWEEN YOU AND GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE ASHES IN A FEW DAYS. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, BUT I'M GAINING POPULARITY. LISTEN, Satan would like to sell you all kind of possibilities. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you have time? I have sat with men and women. I've sat with men and women. I'm not going to tell you what party, but I've sat with them and they made me proposition. Ron, BECAUSE OF YOUR BUSINESS, BECAUSE OF YOUR PERSONALITY, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT YOU DO BUSINESS, WE'D LIKE TO PUT YOU ON COURSE TO BE AN ESTATE SENATOR. &gt;&gt; WE'D LIKE TO GET YOU INTO GOVERNMENT. WE NEED SOMEBODY LIKE YOU. &gt;&gt; AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WIN. ALLURING, &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO STEP DOWN? WHY WOULD I WANT TO STEP DOWN FROM HAVING THE GREATEST POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE &gt;&gt; TALKING TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN &gt;&gt; TO HAVING A DIRTY ROTTEN POLITICS JOB? Come on, CHURCH. HE'LL COME ALONG AND HE'LL OFFER YOU THE WORLD. AND LOT SAW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES &gt;&gt; AND HE PITCHED HIS TENT TOWARDS SODOM. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY FOOLISH VIRGINS &gt;&gt; SIT RIGHT HERE? AND LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY IS AROUND. &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I'LL BE A FANATIC. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT ENOUGH ALL FOR A WHILE. I JUST WANT JUST ENOUGH MESSAGE TO HANG ON TO. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE. I look out here and see all the opportunities as I've missed because of petty things, little insignificant things that didn't mean nothing. I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel preacher minister before you. I repent before God and I ask you to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being dilatory about the work of God. And brother Renham felt that way &gt;&gt; by the grace of God and the help of God. Everyone trying to tell you something to do. They got a program. They got something for you to do. I know God's program. &gt;&gt; It's written out here in the Bible. I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF AS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. One million souls won. I ought to have won 10 million souls. I'M WAY BEHIND. WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SOULS HAVE YOU WON SINCE YOU'VE BEEN TO CHRIST? &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY GOES FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY SOULS HAVE YOU WON SINCE YOU'VE BEEN A CHRISTIAN? &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT WINNING SOULS, YOU'RE GUILTY, BARREN, &gt;&gt; BROUGHT SHAME TO THE CHURCH AND THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I have fought and fought and fought not to have to read this tonight. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know this is real. &gt;&gt; He says, u be ashamed of yourself before Christ. Guilty. our place at the altar. HE SAYS, "I INVITE YOU TO COME AND WITH ME for repentance. &gt;&gt; I invite you to come with me &gt;&gt; for repentance. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many more days we have left. I don't know how many hours we got left, but every hour of every day, I want to spend as much energy as I've got. &gt;&gt; Everything that is within me, &gt;&gt; you forgive me for being simple tonight, &gt;&gt; but I want to challenge you tonight. WHATEVER TIME THAT WE'VE GOT LEFT ON THIS EARTH, &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU, &gt;&gt; MOM, DAD, SISTER, BROTHER, &gt;&gt; MINISTER, &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CHALLENGE US TONIGHT. WHAT ARE WE DOING? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE SPENDING OUR ENERGIES? HOW ARE WE SPENDING OUR TIME? &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE SAME 24 HOURS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GOT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M POOR. I'M SURE THE WOMAN IN MEMPHIS WAS POOR, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNOW HOW TO GO ON HER KNEES AND SAY, "WHERE IS MY ELIJAH AT?" &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT THE MESSAGE. I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T EITHER. BUT SHE CALLED ON HER ELIJAH. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED ON GOD. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, when he walked into that home, he said, "I could tell she had been talking to God." &gt;&gt; I like it when I PICK UP THE PHONE AND A MAMA OR A DADDY'S TALKING ON THE OTHER END OF THAT PHONE. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN ALREADY FEEL THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALREADY FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. THE SENSE OF URGENCY COMING THROUGH THE PHONE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SENSE THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF GOD. BROTHER RON, I'M WAITING ON SOMEBODY ELSE. IT'S YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; Song leaders can't do it all for you. &gt;&gt; MUSICIANS CAN'T DO IT ALL for you. &gt;&gt; Ministers can't do it all FOR YOU. I CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. LET CHRIST HAVE HIS WAY IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; RAISE YOUR FLAG TONIGHT &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO USE ME. LORD, &gt;&gt; if he took A PICTURE OF ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, I WANT HIM TO USE ME. IF HE PRE-PLANNED A JOB FOR ME TO DO, I WANT HIM TO USE ME. I PRAY CONVICTION FALLS IN THIS BUILDING LIKE IT'S NEVER FELL BEFORE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I PRAY A BURDEN FOR MORE LOST SOULS. I PRAY A BURDEN FOR A DEEPER WALK WITH GOD. I PRAY A A BURDEN A BURDEN FOR COMING TO CHURCH WITH A REAL BURDEN ON YOUR HEART.

FATHER, THERE'S A BURDEN LIKE JOSHUA HAD. SOME HASN'T TAKEN their land. SOME HASN'T POSSESSED THEIR LAND. SOME HASN'T CLAIMED THEIR INHERITANCE TONIGHT. PAUL'S WAITING ON THEM. PETER'S WAITING ON THEM. JAMES IS WAITING ON THEM. THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE AGES IS WAITING ON THEM. AND GOD IS DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK OUR PICTURE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE HAS CALLED US. HE HAS ELECTED US. HE HAS CHOSEN US. HE HAS PREDESTINATED US. HE HAS JUSTIFIED US. AND HE'S ALREADY GLORIFIED US TONIGHT. OH GOD, I PRAY TONIGHT WE INVITE YOU TO OUR PEW. WE INVITE YOU TO OUR SAKE. LORD, YOU SEE OUR HUNGERING HEART. LORD, WE WANT MORE OF YOU TONIGHT. I PRAY THAT YOU WILL SPEAK TO OUR HEARTS, SPEAK TO OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; What are we GOING TO DO WITH THIS JESUS CALLED CHRIST? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? LORD, IT'S NOT OUR INTENTIONS. IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IT. YESTERDAY'S EXPERIENCE WON'T WORK FOR TODAY. OH GOD, SEND YOUR WORD. SEND YOUR WORD AMONG US TONIGHT. I PRAY THAT YOU WE CAN REACH OUT LORD JESUS AS YOU PASS BY TONIGHT. TOUCH OUR HEARTS. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; there might be one in the building &gt;&gt; who has shook off &gt;&gt; and shook off the spirit of the Lord over and over and over again, &gt;&gt; Lord. Maybe they've come to THESE MEETINGS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEY'VE CYCLED THROUGH THIS camp and in two or three weeks they're the same condition. I pray tonight &gt;&gt; that that thing is shook. &gt;&gt; That weight THAT IS SO HOLDING US BACK, THE SIN WHICH IS SO EASILY BESET US, THE WEAKNESS THAT IS IN OUR BODY, THE WEAKNESS THAT IS IN OUR FLESH THAT KEEPS PULLING US BACK TO THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. I PRAY THAT THING IS DEFEATED tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. WE RAISE OUR WHITE FLAG TONIGHT TO YOU, FATHER, IN A TOTAL SURRENDER, FATHER. LORD, BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE, THE MIGHTY ANGEL OF THE LORD IS IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT. AND I PRAY THAT, FATHER, THAT YOU WILL COME TO OUR HUNGRY HEARTS. OH GOD, &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ALTAR. &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, MAYBE BROTHER BROWN'S VOICE HAS BECOME A STRANGER IN OUR HOME. MAYBE OUR PRAYER LIFE HAS VANISHED, LORD, WITH CONVICTION IN OUR HEART TONIGHT. LORD, YOU WON'T ALWAYS DEAL LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE WILL COME A TIME THAT YOU WON'T DEAL ANYMORE. THERE WILL COME A TIME TO WORD THAT THERE WON'T BE NOBODY FEEL THE PULL. BUT LORD, WHILE YOU'RE PULLING TONIGHT, WE ANSWER THE CALL TONIGHT. LORD, WE ANSWER THE CALL. WE ANSWER THE BROODING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. LORD, COME TO OUR HEARTS. COME TO OUR LIVES TONIGHT, LORD JESUS.

Oh God, &gt;&gt; weaknesses of sugar diabetes, A BRUISED SAIL CALLED CANCER GR. &gt;&gt; LORD, THERE'S ENOUGH POWER IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. LORD, I believe just as MUCH AS YOU HEAL MY BACK. &gt;&gt; LORD, THAT YOU PUT BACK TO EVERY VERTEBRAE. YOU HEAL ME OF THAT STROKE THE OTHER DAY. LORD, THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE. LORD, AS WE RAISE OUR HANDS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT, I DEFY THE ARMIES OF HELL IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. SATAN CAN TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S CHILDREN AND MAY YOU deliver them and may you set them free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're free. We're free. We're free AT THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. We applied the token. &gt;&gt; Our children slipped away. God. Lord, I CALL FOR REDEMPTION TONIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.

Satan don't EVEN HAVE THE KEYS TO HIS OWN HOUSE. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET HIM BLUFF YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'VE BEEN TO THAT ALTAR TWICE AND I HAVEN'T STILL GOT WHAT I NEED." I COME TO THIS ALTAR TONIGHT. I PRESS MY THROUGH WAY THROUGH. I SAY, "GOD, I'M HERE. I NEED YOU. I NEED THAT ETERNAL PART OF MY HEART. Brother Ron, you seem like you're bold tonight. I FEEL SOMETHING HERE. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't DO THIS UNLESS I FELT SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I've came to camp after camp and I go back the same way. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of that kind of experience. My mom and dad, THEY'RE THIS WAY AND THAT way and I struggle. I WANT YOU TO COME TONIGHT. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO OVERCOME. LET IT BE YOU. There won't be services like this always. &gt;&gt; This meeting is slipping away already. &gt;&gt; ONE MORNING BETWEEN 6 AND 9, WE WISH WE'D HAVE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; It's like standing AT AN AUCTION WANTING TO BUY A PIECE OF PRODUCT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BUY IT AFTER THAT PRODUCT IS GONE. ONE DAY OUR VOICES WON'T SOUND NO MORE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, HOW WE NEED IN JEFFERSONVILLE TONIGHT. THOUSANDS OF LIVED VOICES. &gt;&gt; MOM AND DAD, YOU FELT COLD AND INDIFFERENT WITH GOD.

But when the spirit of God falls, saints of God, we want to move. When the spirit of God moves, &gt;&gt; we do. &gt;&gt; When that angel troubled the water, it was the first one in. I want you to know if I lived that time, you'd have to be behind me. &gt;&gt; Or we'd all be diving in at one time. I say, "LET'S ALL DIVE IN AT ONE TIME." AMEN. THAT WE CAN ALL GET THAT HEALING.

Amen. And I feel that new body materializing around me. I don't know about you, SAINTS OF GOD, BUT I'VE BEEN IN A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE for the last few months. I'M GOING TO GET CARRIED AWAY WHEN I GET CARRIED AWAY. You say, "Oh, this is just nothing but hypen all." You know, you're just jealous. &gt;&gt; You know, YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS. JUST GET THAT JEALOUS SPIRIT OUT OF HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I had to break it a few years ago myself. I was a bunch of headnters myself. Uh-huh. But all of a sudden, when I saw somebody else get in a honey bucket, I said, "I want that honey bucket also." PUT MY HAND IN THAT HONEY BUCKET AND I WON'T LET GO. I WON'T LET GO. THIS IS HONEY IN THE ROCK, MY BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. HOW ABOUT YOU HERE TONIGHT? Victory is yours. &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL SPEAK IT. &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS IT. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. Oh, I told him. Oh, victory today. WHEN I WALK THIS MORNING, when I walk this morning, I got I got the Lord SAY THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. DOWN. YES, SIR. I'm singing shouting every mine. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. Oh, I choose WHERE victory today is first. Joy is mine. WHY? &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL BE HAPPY. HAPPINESS. Happiness is mine. Happiness is mine. Happiness. GLORY. WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING, when I woke this to get Anna, hour and a half to get back. You saints are doing that all the time in the American folks. I think we just need to pray a special blessing upon all the saints that live around that 49th parallel. They've endured for many years to make the church what it is today. And I say, God bless the saints that live on the south side. I am humbled every time I'm in your homes. We sit at your table. We break bread. I'm humbled every time because I see you have a love for the word. You endure those borders. You have children. I know what it is to have babies in in car seats crying. Mommy's stressed out. I know what it is. But I want you to say, I know one thing and say it's worth it all. &gt;&gt; It is worth every minute of it because here they are tonight. Here they are standing by the grace of God. So we are going to close be prompt tomorrow morning 10:30 the service starts. It'll be our last service. We are going to need at least 20 brothers. We asked for 20 I think to put up the 10, was it? And we got 60. That's my kind of mathematics. But we're going to need 20. You know, it's all fine and dandy now. We've enjoyed all this, but it's not over &gt;&gt; till it's all packed away. &gt;&gt; And many hands, mate, like work. &gt;&gt; So, we need 20 brothers after the service. However you arrange it with your wives, if you're single, that's even better. Let the brothers that got wives and children, not that that is better, but got wives and children, they can get away and you've got the time. Be willing to help the brothers pull down the tent, pull the wires, get the chairs ready. Could you do that? And then we'll need eight brothers then to unload the tent where it's being stored. And that would be wonderful. campers, if you wouldn't mind, immediately uh after you've greeted, just shooken hands, please go immediately to the dining hall. We have a little meeting in there we'd like to have. And those that have visited us tonight, God bless you again. Make your way off the grounds as quickly as possible. Of course, greet one another, but just make your way. And that would help us out a lot. So, let's just pray, have a word of prayer. Father, we've enjoyed the ministry of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, to see lives touched by the word thrills my soul. I'm sure it thrills everyone that's standing here. Lord, Satan has fought service after service, and we've had some tremendous encounters with God. Lord, you've been so faithful. And yet tonight, Lord, YOU'VE COME AGAIN AND MOVED UPON US AND YOU SWEPT UPON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU SWEPT UPON PARENTS. LORD, I SAY TO GOD BE THE GLORY. GREAT THINGS HE has done. We thank you for this time. We pray, Father, that tomorrow morning that it will be the capstone message that you'd come down in a supernatural way. There was 120 in the upper room. There's a lot MORE HERE TONIGHT. LET THE HOLY GHOST fall &gt;&gt; and Father move us into channels and depths we have not even tasted. We pray watch everyone on the road Lord. Just help the mothers with their babies. Lord, long services, but these are blessed times. Watch over our children and the daddies as they drive home. And Lord, if we shall return, if you should give us a Sunday morning, bless the meeting. Strengthen our dear brother Ron, Lord. Weary, weak, he's poured out, Lord. And he's poured out. And he's poured out. We believe it was supernatural even for him to be speaking yet THIS EVENING. LORD, LET THE ANGEL COME BY HIS WAY. STRENGTHEN HIM LIKE ELIJAH WAS STRENGTHENED. LORD, MAY HE WAKE UP REFRESHED IN THE MORNING. MAY HE BE RENEWED. THE SAME ONE, LORD, THAT HAS TOUCHED HIM, TOUCH HIM AGAIN. We've appreciated his ministry, his life. We just pray you'll use him again in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God be with you. And young people, if you could make it towards to the kitchen, that would be great. God bless you all. You're Smith in Jesus name. Don't worry. Heat. Heat.
