[0:00] yes Isaiah confessed his sins and was
[0:03] cleansed after Jacob had wrestled all
[0:06] night in confessing his sins you know
[0:10] the place you was is called penl p n i t
[0:13] e l
[0:15] penl the word penl in the Hebrew means
[0:18] the face of almighty
[0:22] God Jacob the little
[0:25] Shyer had run all his name of Jacob
[0:28] which means supp planter that deceiver
[0:31] had run all of his life away from God
[0:34] but when he got one time in the presence
[0:36] of God at Temple in the face of God he
[0:39] got a hold of God and wouldn't turn him
[0:42] loose God we need more
[0:44] Jacobs he held on to the face of God in
[0:49] the presence of God he stayed until it
[0:53] was Sun up God said let me go because
[0:57] the sun's arising and he stayed in the
[1:00] face of God until son up but he went
[1:02] away Justified and
[1:04] saved praise the Lord oh what a great
[1:06] thing it was now to know that he had
[1:10] wrestled through that's he had seen
[1:12] signs of God he' had dreams about God
[1:15] but this is one time he was in the face
[1:18] of God in the presence of God in the
[1:21] presence of God a man's changed Jacob
[1:24] was changed now he could walk with God
[1:28] yes he was a different man than what he
[1:29] was was when he went up there the battle
[1:31] was now over yes sir and he begin to
[1:34] build an altar he hadn't been used to
[1:36] building altar you know but I tell you
[1:40] when you come in the presence of God you
[1:41] want to build an altar somewhere you
[1:43] want to find somewhere where you can
[1:45] pray he built an altar he was cleansed
[1:48] and God had won and Jacob was changed
[1:53] from Jacob's supp planter to Israel a
[1:57] prince having power with God
[2:00] that's what happened to Jacob the
[2:02] supplanter the deceiver the unrighteous
[2:06] the Unholy the deceiver deceived his
[2:10] brother stole the birri as it was from
[2:13] his brother took a little dirty way of
[2:16] doing it such a deceiver he deceived his
[2:18] father-in-law put popper sticks and made
[2:21] speckled Cales when the cow's been
[2:23] pregnant he come there look at the Sheep
[2:25] but see that speckled stick make
[2:26] speckled cattle give them birth marks
[2:29] deceiver deceiving his own father-in-law
[2:32] deceived his mother deceived his daddy
[2:35] deceived his brother but when he once
[2:37] got in the he was a Shyer he was running
[2:39] everywhere he went always on the run
[2:41] from God he's on the run from his
[2:43] brother but when he come into the
[2:45] presence of God he recognized he was a
[2:47] sinner
[2:49] amen what did he do what did he do he
[2:52] seen his opportunity he had met
[2:55] something that he didn't even think
[2:56] about before and he stayed there until
[2:59] all sins was gone oh my God got him in
[3:03] his own presence God manages a way to
[3:06] get man in their presence then they make
[3:07] their decision some of them run from him
[3:10] some run to him if they're predestinated
[3:12] to life they believe it they hang on to
[3:14] it if they're not they try to get away
[3:16] and says nothing to it see and that's
[3:18] the guy that's lost the guy that
[3:20] confesses his sin shall have pardon if
[3:22] you hide your sin you'll not Prosper no
[3:25] so Jacob when he the next day he met ES
[3:29] saw his brother he didn't need no help
[3:32] from him there he didn't need his armies
[3:35] he is business building
[3:37] ARS
[3:39] am God he wasn't afraid of Esau no more
[3:43] but in the days of the voice of the
[3:44] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[3:46] sound the mystery of God should be
[3:48] finished as he hath declared to his
[3:51] servants the prophets
