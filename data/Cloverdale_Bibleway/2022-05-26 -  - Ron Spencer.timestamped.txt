[33:38] and then thank you brother victor mr
[33:40] victoria
[33:41] when i think of a video clip you have a
[33:42] video clip ready brother joe all right
[33:44] i'll if you could just have that queued
[33:46] up
[33:47] it's a
[33:48] testimony that we wanted to share with
[33:50] you some of you are a little bit
[33:52] familiar but
[33:54] i think this will be special for a few
[33:55] of you but
[33:57] uh since 2019 my wife and i uh
[34:00] sister elaine sister elena and myself
[34:03] uh had
[34:04] miscarriage after miscarriage not very
[34:06] many people really knew about it they
[34:08] were all
[34:09] in the first trimester and uh
[34:12] some early on so it's it's sometimes
[34:14] just a part of life and so you move on
[34:16] but it kept happening
[34:17] and there's you know we're very blessed
[34:19] to have the son and daughter that we
[34:20] have but there was a desire in our heart
[34:22] you know for
[34:23] another child and um in
[34:27] i believe it was late 2019 or early 2020
[34:30] she had a miscarriage that was really
[34:31] quite hard on her body
[34:33] and um
[34:35] and so it became kind of a real fearful
[34:37] thing for her and
[34:39] um fast forward now till
[34:41] 2021 and in august late july and august
[34:44] of just last year
[34:46] um we found out she was expecting again
[34:49] and so we're excited but there's that
[34:51] that fear now because now there's been a
[34:53] bit of a pattern for a couple years
[34:55] and um
[34:57] uh she
[34:59] had another miscarriage and lost the
[35:00] baby and this one was was quite severe
[35:02] and there came a point where
[35:05] she finally called her doctor and the
[35:07] doctor said you should go to the
[35:08] emergency room just because of how how
[35:10] much of the hemorrhaging that was taking
[35:11] place
[35:12] and elena was just so weak she's like i
[35:14] don't want to go to the hospital so we
[35:16] had prayer and the lord stopped the
[35:17] bleeding and
[35:19] she was out for
[35:21] eight to ten days about ten days she
[35:23] couldn't really do anything and so i was
[35:25] in full-time school working trying to
[35:27] take care of the kids it was a
[35:28] challenging couple weeks you know and
[35:30] she feels
[35:31] um
[35:32] you know like she's not able to do
[35:33] anything it's very hard for a mother but
[35:35] she was just really weak and really
[35:36] discouraged and there's all the physical
[35:38] things happening as well it's a very
[35:40] challenging time and that took us right
[35:42] up to camp in fact when we came to
[35:43] summer camp it was right out of that and
[35:46] i i'd messaged brother michael it's like
[35:48] if i don't seem very excited about all
[35:50] the camped prep it's because i am so
[35:52] tired and like this is where we are and
[35:54] i told brother michael what was going on
[35:55] just so he had a heads up like this is
[35:57] what we've been going through the last
[35:58] couple weeks it was the ten days before
[35:59] camp
[36:00] and uh poor elena was just so tired and
[36:03] and just her body recovering and uh all
[36:05] the emotional side of it as well so we
[36:07] came into camp very tired
[36:09] and uh just you know still trusting the
[36:11] lord but just disappointed again and
[36:13] having this was our fourth or fifth at
[36:15] this point
[36:16] and um
[36:18] at the very end of camp brother wayne
[36:20] lawson this will be special brother luis
[36:21] and sister grace as well
[36:23] at the very end of camp on his sunday
[36:25] morning he proceeds to share a bunch of
[36:27] testimonies i'm sure a number of you
[36:28] remember he told testimony after
[36:30] testimony told the testimony of the
[36:31] sister who was crippled and she came up
[36:33] to give a testimony when she reached for
[36:35] the microphone he said and with these
[36:36] eyes i saw her hand straighten out
[36:38] and then after that the last two
[36:40] testimonies that he shares
[36:42] were about the lord granting children to
[36:44] people who had not been able to have
[36:45] children previously
[36:47] and so i have that testimony clip it's
[36:49] about five or sorry uh yeah testimony
[36:51] that's about five minutes but i thought
[36:52] it would be important so we're going to
[36:53] share it with you
[36:55] share a little bit of the testimony with
[36:57] you we could queue that up brother
[37:00] right in my house my
[37:02] my son zechariah got married to a lovely
[37:04] young lady named hannah anna carter from
[37:06] brother paula fontaine some of you might
[37:07] know her
[37:10] wasn't long after they were married they
[37:11] decided they want to have a child which
[37:13] would be my first grandchild
[37:15] and i was happy for them
[37:18] my my goal in life is to have a pile of
[37:22] grandkids hanging around the house
[37:23] that's like my ultimate goal
[37:26] seriously
[37:27] so i was so happy to hear the news
[37:30] and then she
[37:31] expected we always rejoicing lost the
[37:34] baby
[37:35] that was a birthday
[37:37] a little while later they
[37:38] worked up the nerve to try again
[37:41] she got expected lost the baby
[37:44] went to the doctors they said well we're
[37:45] not sure what's really wrong
[37:47] some of her people around her begin to
[37:49] say well there's a there's a lineage
[37:51] that we're from and some of them is not
[37:53] able to bear children because of certain
[37:54] diseases strike their body and they they
[37:56] they they're not going to be able to
[37:58] have them
[37:59] so her and zachariah were
[38:01] we're in labor wandering praying asking
[38:03] god
[38:04] well about this same season brother
[38:06] erickson had ron spencer to come for our
[38:09] total meetings and it may have been may
[38:11] i don't remember we had him twice that
[38:12] year
[38:13] and in the end of the service we were
[38:15] having a prayer line
[38:17] and when brother ron started praying he
[38:19] asked me to join him and i come and
[38:20] stood there with him and while we were
[38:22] praying for people all of a sudden
[38:24] zechariah and anna come on my heart
[38:27] and i said lord i want to see him have
[38:28] that baby

[38:32] you just let them come
[38:33] in this prayer line it give me a little
[38:35] comfort

[38:38] in that same moment zachariah pops up
[38:41] gets anna comes right down there
[38:43] stands into the prayer line
[38:45] brother ron goes to pray for him puts
[38:47] his hand on and begins to pray and steps
[38:49] back and looks at her
[38:52] he said in the name of the lord jesus

[41:20] [Music]
[41:25] it's about wait what are you doing i'm
[41:26] showing you
[41:27] that this message is real
[41:31] i was preaching in a meeting one time
[41:32] over in david versus and the young man's
[41:35] a pastor now he meant his wife sister
[41:37] stephanie they were sitting in the
[41:39] meeting and i was preaching right along
[41:41] and i was preaching all of a sudden that
[41:43] inspiration comes on me and i point out
[41:45] at sister stephanie and i said listen
[41:47] god change your body if he needs to
[41:50] god changed mary god changed hannah god
[41:53] gave those babies god's able to do
[41:55] whatever to cause something to happen
[41:57] hey man you can have that baby if you
[41:59] can believe it i didn't even know she's
[42:00] praying for a baby
[42:02] ten months later she comes to arkansas
[42:04] walks in the church she said here
[42:06] brother wayne's that baby i said i
[42:08] didn't even know you were wanting to
[42:10] baby she said do you not remember
[42:12] pointing me out and telling me that god
[42:14] would give me the desires of my heart if
[42:16] i could i said no i don't even remember
[42:18] it because see god can speak to a man
[42:21] god can speak to a woman when the
[42:23] speaker don't even know what is being
[42:26] asked for but god remains to be god let
[42:30] me tell you something he's still god

[42:42] awkward because there's a mess of
[42:44] emotions going on there i'm like this
[42:45] man has no idea what we've just come

[59:44] i'd like to if i could just have a
[59:46] couple of moments and i'm going to take
[59:48] them
[59:50] but i'd like to put my
[59:52] my thoughts
[59:54] and i have a lot of emotions that goes
[59:56] with this but
[59:59] your 50 years has been so special to us
[1:00:02] and as many as all around the world
[1:00:06] and the ministry of brother ed muscle
[1:00:09] has touched
[1:00:10] hundreds of thousands of lives
[1:00:13] i just happened to be one of them and
[1:00:17] it was when i was a little boy
[1:00:19] we would go home from church and
[1:00:22] and on on sunday evening
[1:00:25] william west virginia was the radio
[1:00:27] broadcast
[1:00:28] and we would listen to brother tom
[1:00:30] as he would introduce
[1:00:32] and then brother branham preach
[1:00:35] and uh
[1:00:37] and that kind of gave us a touch we
[1:00:39] didn't have we didn't have all the tapes
[1:00:41] that we needed and
[1:00:43] and my dad it was like sacred event when
[1:00:45] that's when that came on nobody talked
[1:00:49] you just listened to that and it was
[1:00:50] just so wonderful
[1:00:52] in 1978 i got the opportunity to to
[1:00:56] listen to brother ed for the first time
[1:00:58] i i don't know exactly how old i was i
[1:01:01] didn't stop and figure it out but i was
[1:01:02] a teenager at that time
[1:01:06] and i'd heard a lot of speakers so
[1:01:08] because i was born and raised in church
[1:01:10] in the message
[1:01:12] and i heard a lot of speakers but i
[1:01:13] never heard one like that
[1:01:16] because he made it real
[1:01:19] as a young man it connected
[1:01:22] i got married i i was saved in 1983.
[1:01:27] the lord dealt with my heart
[1:01:29] and dad asked me one day he said
[1:01:32] who was your favorite speaker as you
[1:01:34] came through your teenage years who was
[1:01:37] your favorite speaker and i said well it
[1:01:38] was a man that came and spoke on
[1:01:41] experiences and he said that's brother
[1:01:43] biscuit
[1:01:44] he said he's going to be in in north
[1:01:46] carolina in a few weeks would you like
[1:01:49] to go
[1:01:50] and so i said absolutely i'd like to go
[1:01:53] so we drove four or five hours to be
[1:01:55] there and
[1:01:56] and it was a church that was a unique
[1:01:58] way that they did business and connie
[1:02:00] and i had just got married
[1:02:02] and so they separated the girls from the
[1:02:05] guys they thought she was too young to
[1:02:06] sit with me and
[1:02:10] they took her off to sunday school
[1:02:19] i was expecting an older gray-headed man
[1:02:22] to step out and preach and
[1:02:24] here come a bouncing athlete
[1:02:27] and brother biscuit stepped out and i
[1:02:29] was on the fourth row i was about where
[1:02:31] you're sitting
[1:02:33] and brother biscuit preached on the
[1:02:36] breach and you must cross over
[1:02:39] and
[1:02:40] what a powerful sermon that it was
[1:02:44] it would be a couple of years later that
[1:02:46] he would be at the north carolina camp
[1:02:48] at brother henry greene's
[1:02:50] and he would speak a sermon called let
[1:02:51] us run
[1:02:54] i was a young man there
[1:02:56] and as a young man i was sitting and i
[1:02:58] was a young preacher at that time
[1:03:02] you know i
[1:03:03] i didn't have a lot of direction
[1:03:07] i went back and listened to that sermon
[1:03:09] this morning
[1:03:14] brother bisical spoke he spoke on many
[1:03:17] people though down through the ages
[1:03:20] and he took different ones like peter
[1:03:22] cartwright and he he took men of the
[1:03:25] ages john wesley
[1:03:28] and he took and he took portions of
[1:03:29] their lives and showed what god did with
[1:03:32] them in the works
[1:03:34] spoke about john wesley speaking 88 000
[1:03:37] sermons
[1:03:39] spoke about how this one produced
[1:03:42] all the books that they did and
[1:03:44] translated sometimes 42 different bibles
[1:03:49] and as he began to to speak those things
[1:03:53] he began to talk about that last seed
[1:03:56] and that last seed would be the most
[1:03:58] costly
[1:04:00] and we must be driven to get that last
[1:04:02] seed
[1:04:04] what he was doing in that camp meeting
[1:04:06] service was explaining
[1:04:08] god was allowing him to explain my life
[1:04:14] and brother biscuit was standing and
[1:04:16] explaining his life and his life was not
[1:04:19] just himself but it was his wife
[1:04:22] because behind every great man is a
[1:04:24] great woman a great family
[1:04:27] and then a great church
[1:04:30] and none of it's possible without a
[1:04:32] great god
[1:04:35] we don't lift up a gr the men because
[1:04:38] of their humanity
[1:04:40] but if somebody don't go
[1:04:46] many of you wouldn't be here
[1:04:48] without brother bischo having went
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:58] we've all got our critics
[1:05:01] but our critics actually make us the
[1:05:03] masterpiece
[1:05:06] they actually testify
[1:05:09] that we are the masterpiece
[1:05:21] i would be given the opportunity
[1:05:23] my father and mother would go to brother
[1:05:26] billy andrews
[1:05:28] for 19 years
[1:05:30] to hear brother biskell speak
[1:05:33] it was their anniversary
[1:05:36] and they loved it
[1:05:38] they didn't want to go away to the
[1:05:39] mountains or to the beach they wanted to
[1:05:42] go hear brother biscuit preach
[1:05:48] brother bischo my father passed away the
[1:05:50] other day

[1:12:44] office
[1:12:46] with the doctor
[1:12:48] and they had told me that i was terminal
[1:12:51] and so i figured since god showed me a
[1:12:54] vision that you would have a baby

[1:12:59] would be well

[1:13:58] pruitt
[1:13:59] takes it all back apart and puts it all
[1:14:01] back together again

[1:25:54] isaiah 53 and verse 5
[1:25:59] one scripture
[1:26:02] and it's still as powerful today it's
[1:26:04] the moment that it was written

[1:26:13] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:26:17] the chastisement of our peace what's
[1:26:20] upon him
[1:26:21] and with his stripes

[1:26:31] and read it with passion
[1:26:33] but he was wounded for our
[1:26:35] transgressions

[1:26:41] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:26:44] him and with his stripes

[1:27:30] of a saint of god

[1:29:54] the son of the living god
[1:29:57] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:30:00] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:30:03] and blood hath not revealed
[1:30:06] it unto you but my father
[1:30:08] which is in heaven

[1:35:23] predestinate them he also called and
[1:35:26] whom he called them he also justified
[1:35:29] and whom he justified them he also
[1:35:31] glorified
[1:35:32] it's rigged
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:38] it's rigged
[1:35:40] it's a rigged court
[1:35:45] it's a red car
[1:35:46] you were one out of a million
[1:35:48] [Applause]
[1:35:52] but god predestinated your seat
[1:35:56] to life
[1:35:59] and if god watched over the natural sea
[1:36:02] how much more will he watch over you
[1:36:17] hallelujah
[1:36:20] hallelujah
[1:36:22] so no matter what trial that you go
[1:36:24] through
[1:36:26] what situation that you go through
[1:36:29] god's watched over you he's protected
[1:36:32] your sin
[1:36:34] and your fathers in times past were in
[1:36:36] wars and in plagues
[1:36:39] and in horrendous situations
[1:36:44] and god watched over them in battles
[1:36:48] and and literally angels stood and
[1:36:50] stopped shells
[1:36:53] he stopped ships from turning upside
[1:36:56] down
[1:36:58] he stopped car wrecks
[1:37:01] because he was watching over your seat
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:09] hallelujah
[1:37:11] hallelujah when you get a grip of that
[1:37:14] that god was watching over your natural
[1:37:17] seed since adam
[1:37:19] because you were here when jesus was
[1:37:21] here
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] hallelujah you're a pedigree christian
[1:37:30] you were in the lion's book before the
[1:37:32] foundation you're a thought
[1:37:37] brother ron i don't believe so much in
[1:37:38] visions
[1:37:41] well god had a vision of you
[1:37:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:46] he thought of you he knew how tall you'd
[1:37:48] be what color hair that should be what
[1:37:51] color eyes that you'd be how tall
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:56] you're even your attributes everything
[1:37:58] about you
[1:38:01] and through all of that here you are
[1:38:04] fully manifested
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:10] and he predecimated you
[1:38:13] to hear this word
[1:38:16] when a million turned it down what eve
[1:38:19] turned down you believe
[1:38:22] you have accepted
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:26] it's like breath to you it's your life
[1:38:30] it's your passion
[1:38:33] it's your jubilee
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:43] it set you free from denominational
[1:38:45] thinking
[1:38:46] it sets you free from sin
[1:38:49] it sets you free from habits and all
[1:38:51] different kind of things in your life
[1:38:55] and then when they try to come back in
[1:38:58] the power of the blood of jesus christ
[1:39:01] and the seal of the holy ghost
[1:39:04] stopped it
[1:39:05] because you're sealed in
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:24] i want you to think about this
[1:39:27] at every meeting jesus conducted
[1:39:30] satan was there
[1:39:34] he was critical at every meeting
[1:39:37] that he conducted
[1:39:39] he had questions
[1:39:41] he made fun of him he called him every
[1:39:43] day
[1:39:49] and jesus told them just days before
[1:39:52] of what was going to happen
[1:39:56] now remember
[1:39:59] god
[1:40:00] created his own enemy
[1:40:10] and he had a beginning
[1:40:12] and he'll have an end
[1:40:26] he said let there be light
[1:40:30] there was darkness
[1:40:32] there was love
[1:40:33] and there was
[1:40:34] hate satan was the anti-type
[1:40:39] to actually show how great god was
[1:40:43] maybe you're looking at the picture
[1:40:45] wrong
[1:40:48] but god created his own critic
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:59] hope you're listening satan
[1:41:02] hope you're listening
[1:41:04] it was god that created you you may have
[1:41:06] forgot
[1:41:07] but it was god that created you
[1:41:12] and so
[1:41:14] so now
[1:41:16] all the way down
[1:41:20] god has been descending through the old
[1:41:22] testament
[1:41:25] and you could see god in moses
[1:41:29] sometimes you have to look strong
[1:41:32] you could see god in joseph
[1:41:37] disappointing to be in a dungeon
[1:41:40] you could see god in jonah
[1:41:45] they maybe didn't understand that they
[1:41:47] were displaying god
[1:41:49] but god was making his way
[1:41:51] toward his own vessel of himself
[1:41:53] becoming flesh
[1:41:59] now
[1:42:00] satan had 4 thousand years to stop it
[1:42:03] because he was watching
[1:42:05] he faced every one of those prophets
[1:42:07] but he couldn't stop redemption from
[1:42:09] happening
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:13] he couldn't stop redemption from
[1:42:15] happening
[1:42:16] he couldn't interrupt god's plan
[1:42:18] [Applause]
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:21] [Applause]
[1:42:23] he couldn't interrupt it he couldn't
[1:42:24] stop it
[1:42:28] he had all of these demons and imps at
[1:42:30] his disposal
[1:42:32] and in every
[1:42:33] junction
[1:42:35] he couldn't stop the word
[1:42:39] and time from interception and prophecy
[1:42:43] being fulfilled he couldn't stop
[1:42:48] behold the virgin shall conceive
[1:42:51] satan had to watch the angel come to
[1:42:55] mary
[1:42:56] [Applause]
[1:42:57] in that other dimension he had to watch
[1:43:00] that angel come to that girl
[1:43:04] and knowing the scriptures
[1:43:08] he never went to a girl before
[1:43:11] but now he goes to a girl
[1:43:17] so he goes back to hell and says we got
[1:43:19] to make up a story
[1:43:23] we gotta make up a story we gotta
[1:43:25] we gotta have some fake news
[1:43:32] that she has an affair with a soldier
[1:43:37] but she steps into the vision and says
[1:43:40] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:54] shepherds came
[1:43:56] kings came
[1:43:58] every meeting satan tried to disqualify
[1:44:02] 50 years satan's tried to disqualify you
[1:44:10] 50 years
[1:44:12] 50 years boy he's been hard at work
[1:44:15] we celebrate 50 years here
[1:44:18] he's been here every service
[1:44:23] every service you've thrown him out
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:27] you've cast out demons
[1:44:29] you've worshipped the lord
[1:44:32] you've all you've you've sent this a
[1:44:34] message around the world and satan just
[1:44:37] keeps coming back
[1:44:40] just like the fellow that's standing in
[1:44:42] the pulpit
[1:44:44] he would have killed
[1:44:46] that fella
[1:44:48] if he'd have had the power
[1:44:53] he'd have killed me a long time ago if
[1:44:55] he had the power
[1:44:57] [Applause]
[1:44:59] because we've done his his kingdom much
[1:45:01] damage
[1:45:03] in the last two years we've done his
[1:45:05] kingdom a lot of damage
[1:45:08] you've done the kingdom of hell
[1:45:10] much damage in 50 years
[1:45:14] that's to be celebrated
[1:45:17] [Applause]
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:42] jesus says that it's finished
[1:45:49] they take his body
[1:45:52] they put it in a tomb
[1:45:59] sometimes what you don't see what's
[1:46:01] going on is
[1:46:03] jesus was on a mission
[1:46:06] god
[1:46:07] sent jesus to hell
[1:46:10] so you wouldn't have to go
[1:46:18] he just didn't come to heal you and
[1:46:21] and to lift your spirits
[1:46:23] but he has prevented you from ever
[1:46:27] tasting hell
[1:46:36] now this is something you need to
[1:46:37] celebrate
[1:46:39] this mortal realm
[1:46:41] is as close to hell as you'll ever go
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:53] for the sinner
[1:46:57] this border realm is as close to heaven
[1:47:01] as they'll ever
[1:47:07] it's get a thought isn't it
[1:47:11] so jesus goes to hell
[1:47:15] and while he's there he takes the keys
[1:47:18] of death hell and the grave
[1:47:22] he does something that no mortal man
[1:47:27] has ever been able to do
[1:47:30] because when he was standing in flesh
[1:47:34] he said i have power to lay my life down
[1:47:39] and the power to take it up again
[1:47:43] he warns satan
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:47:51] he warned satan
[1:47:53] he told him the prince of this world is
[1:47:56] judged
[1:47:58] he warned him
[1:48:01] and in all of that wording
[1:48:03] satan
[1:48:04] with all of his power
[1:48:07] with all of his thoughts of all of his
[1:48:10] perversion
[1:48:12] couldn't stop him
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:21] [Applause]
[1:48:27] i want you to stink
[1:48:30] jesus tells a woman
[1:48:32] to come
[1:48:33] to put spices on his body
[1:48:37] knowing
[1:48:39] they wasn't going to find him in the
[1:48:40] tomb i believe it was you that said
[1:48:44] brother david you said that the tomb was
[1:48:46] open because he could have walked
[1:48:48] through the door i thought that was
[1:48:49] awesome
[1:48:50] i would have said it if i thought of it
[1:48:54] but they needed to see that there was an
[1:48:56] empty
[1:48:58] tomb
[1:48:59] [Applause]
[1:49:01] but i want you to just think about this
[1:49:04] you're sitting here you believe the
[1:49:06] message and sometimes you feel like
[1:49:09] how did i get worthy to be able to sit
[1:49:12] here
[1:49:12] and hear what i hear
[1:49:14] and see what i see
[1:49:20] of all the people living on the earth
[1:49:25] kings
[1:49:26] ambassadors incredible people of all of
[1:49:30] the people
[1:49:31] living on the earth
[1:49:33] he invites them
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:39] oh i feel like
[1:49:40] running he invites them
[1:49:43] to come and see him in another room
[1:49:47] [Applause]
[1:49:51] now satan you can amen from that
[1:49:53] dimension if you want to
[1:49:55] he told them touch me not
[1:49:58] i'm not ascended
[1:50:05] but not only could they not touch him
[1:50:08] satan couldn't touch it
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:15] hallelujah
[1:50:17] can i just say this to you just now
[1:50:19] whether you realize it or not
[1:50:22] that seed that is sealed in
[1:50:27] satan can touch your flesh
[1:50:30] he can contaminate your spirit
[1:50:33] but his cold dirty hands can't touch
[1:50:36] that sea
[1:50:42] and you can't stop that seed from coming
[1:50:44] to life
[1:50:46] and manifesting rapture conditions
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:51:00] that must make him so mad
[1:51:09] did you kill him yet
[1:51:11] guy god just preached another sermon
[1:51:21] you know what happened to me the other
[1:51:22] day when i got here at your fellowship
[1:51:26] all day i'd felt discomfort
[1:51:30] and i take a pain pill in the morning
[1:51:32] and take a pain pill in the afternoon
[1:51:34] then we came to the meeting
[1:51:37] and the boys took me back to the hotel
[1:51:40] i felt really uncomfortable
[1:51:43] so i took another one
[1:51:46] i've never did that
[1:51:48] about 12 o'clock
[1:51:51] i got up and gave birth to a baby boy
[1:51:54] and had a kidney stone
[1:51:59] stupid devil
[1:52:16] so don't you know you don't need to have
[1:52:17] a pity party
[1:52:22] because greater is he that is in you
[1:52:25] [Applause]
[1:52:29] greater is he that is in you
[1:52:32] than he that is in the world
[1:52:36] brother abraham was standing over that
[1:52:38] little boy that was finland from finland
[1:52:40] and brother brandon makes this statement
[1:52:42] he says you don't know how it feels
[1:52:47] and know where you're at then
[1:52:49] all the devil's out of hell
[1:52:52] if he'd line up everything that there
[1:52:55] was in hell around
[1:52:57] it never stopped it
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:01] the next time you have a critic talk to
[1:53:03] you about that finnish boy
[1:53:06] why don't you just give them this quote
[1:53:11] brother baby said every devil out of
[1:53:12] hell
[1:53:14] strongness to the weakest
[1:53:16] you got to line them all up every
[1:53:18] preacher ought to be shouting all over
[1:53:19] this building you got to line them all
[1:53:22] up
[1:53:23] and you couldn't have stopped it
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:28] [Applause]
[1:53:30] this quote is more than just a 50 year
[1:53:32] old quote
[1:53:34] you could line up every devil out of him
[1:53:37] and you can't stop this rapture
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:51] this very moment has been preserved
[1:53:56] like your gene seed has been preserved
[1:53:59] this 50-year jubilee has been preserved
[1:54:03] angels have stood here night after night
[1:54:06] and watched you worship hear you amen
[1:54:09] knowing there were demon forces trying
[1:54:11] to destroy
[1:54:13] but if god is fool you
[1:54:16] who can be against you
[1:54:26] he is here to see this message through
[1:54:31] more than the personality of frail men
[1:54:34] but god himself is here
[1:54:37] [Applause]
[1:54:40] around the world
[1:54:42] to see this word through
[1:54:46] and satan i want to say it without
[1:54:49] being too redundant you can't stop it
[1:55:09] your pastor was called to come up
[1:55:12] and set that's not the amen corner
[1:55:20] he's not here so i'll just say it
[1:55:24] he could have been the prime minister
[1:55:25] he'd have made a good one
[1:55:31] he could have been one of the richest
[1:55:32] businessmen in the world
[1:55:37] he was gifted
[1:55:40] god was with him
[1:55:43] god raised him up
[1:55:45] but to be more
[1:55:48] than a prime minister
[1:55:51] why would he want to stoop
[1:55:53] from this pulpit
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:55:56] and take trudeau's job
[1:56:01] [Applause]
[1:56:03] when eternal gene seeds are setting just
[1:56:06] feet away
[1:56:08] and they're to be encouraged they're to
[1:56:10] be enlightened they're to be
[1:56:12] strengthened they're to be anointed by
[1:56:16] the mighty angel himself
[1:56:18] [Applause]
[1:56:23] because it was more than
[1:56:26] more than quotes in a book
[1:56:29] more than quotes on a on a tape
[1:56:32] it was a vision of god and god knew
[1:56:35] you'd be sitting here
[1:56:38] but god's not finished with this yet
[1:56:42] he's not finished with this message yet
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:48] there will be a marriage supper
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:03] you're sitting here and you haven't been
[1:57:05] touched

[1:57:08] every generation
[1:57:11] he got a taste of what you've got
[1:57:12] brother joel and that changed your life
[1:57:16] [Applause]

[1:57:55] you gave me your daughter's bedroom
[1:57:58] and i prayed that your daughter would
[1:58:00] get saved
[1:58:04] and when you at

[1:58:11] daughter
[1:58:12] god dealt with her during the night

[1:58:25] god hadn't forgotten
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:30] amen amen
[1:58:33] [Music]

[1:58:38] you came to wednesday night service
[1:58:40] declaring i'll never
[1:58:43] i'll never go back to church
[1:58:46] and your dad
[1:58:49] said ben ron spencer's preaching
[1:58:53] he didn't want no more church
[1:58:56] and i wasn't even supposed to be there i
[1:58:58] was going to your place brother tim
[1:59:00] and brother harold that just passed
[1:59:03] called me and said won't you stop at
[1:59:04] wins on wednesday night here
[1:59:07] two months before god spoke to him he
[1:59:09] said the sermon you're studying you'll
[1:59:11] preach at harold's
[1:59:14] and i actually sat at my desk and i said
[1:59:16] lord i have no plans to be at harrels
[1:59:19] god has plans
[1:59:27] and so i stopped and i preached
[1:59:30] wednesday night
[1:59:31] and you were sitting near a post
[1:59:35] your plans were
[1:59:37] this will be my last service
[1:59:40] and you didn't realize that was only the
[1:59:41] start
[1:59:44] [Applause]

[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:19] [Applause]

[2:00:30] will never accomplish nothing in life
[2:00:34] she gets permission from her father to
[2:00:36] call me now and then
[2:00:38] she doesn't realize that it's some of my
[2:00:40] most difficult days that she calls me
[2:00:44] and i hear a girl that's rolled around
[2:00:46] on the floor and she's had incredible
[2:00:49] horrible days
[2:00:51] and she could probably out preach most
[2:00:53] preachers
[2:00:56] god nature of an angel
[2:00:58] [Applause]
[2:01:00] that stupid devil
[2:01:01] [Applause]

[2:01:43] one of them
[2:01:45] she stumbles through the door

[2:01:51] she said you don't know it
[2:01:53] but it's conditions like this
[2:01:56] that drive us
[2:01:58] when the enemy says we can't

[2:02:46] i know i'm on sacred ground
[2:02:48] i got a thick skin
[2:02:50] i can handle it
[2:02:54] but i just see things as in an eternal
[2:02:57] realm
[2:03:05] and his father told him he'd be a
[2:03:07] forever child
[2:03:10] he would never amount to nothing
[2:03:18] there's a jubilee
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:21] there's a jubilee
[2:03:25] he watched his son
[2:03:27] stand in the pulpit this morning
[2:03:33] he may not have been able to play with
[2:03:34] the boys and run with the boys and do
[2:03:36] all the games with the boys but that
[2:03:39] condition drove him
[2:03:43] what a stupid devil
[2:03:46] [Applause]
[2:03:54] you know none of us see the condition of
[2:03:57] job where an interview takes place

[2:04:01] and god has so much confidence in
[2:04:03] trusting you
[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:09] he has so much confidence in you
[2:04:13] that you'll trust him
[2:04:16] regardless of the circumstances
[2:04:19] you won't give up you won't turn around
[2:04:21] you won't go back
[2:04:24] because god himself has had fellowship
[2:04:27] with you
[2:04:27] [Applause]
[2:04:30] and he asked satan you considered my
[2:04:32] cervix

[2:05:56] years why should i believe him now
[2:06:18] brother branham said god's strategy
[2:06:21] god's strategy is to take empty human
[2:06:24] vessels
[2:06:31] and shake the world with them
[2:06:38] like a pentecost
[2:06:40] at pentecost what did he do
[2:06:43] he'd taken them 10 days and got it all
[2:06:45] emptied up
[2:06:47] but they was all standing there with
[2:06:49] their vessels turned up and god took
[2:06:51] himself and
[2:06:52] filled them up
[2:06:54] that's all
[2:06:56] and they shook
[2:06:59] the world

[3:59:03] just wait just wait just as i was
[3:59:05] thinking there i got to inject this this
[3:59:07] thought brother david when he spoke on
[3:59:09] the first night he spoke about the seals
[3:59:12] on the tomb
[3:59:13] they were there burst forth and it
[3:59:14] wasn't to let christ out
[3:59:16] oh my i loved that it wasn't to let
[3:59:19] christ out it was to prove
[3:59:21] to prove that he'd resurrected
[3:59:24] oh my goodness he broke the seals
[3:59:27] to prove that he was still the same god
[3:59:30] yesterday today and forever in this day
[3:59:32] to say i still am alive forevermore oh i
[3:59:36] love that oh i just love that we are

[4:01:12] [Music]
[4:01:15] one of the brothers was preaching there
[4:01:17] the last couple services somebody was
[4:01:19] talking about just the resurrected
[4:01:21] saints
[4:01:23] and they just mentioned something maybe
[4:01:24] them coming up the aisle
[4:01:26] my goodness i can't imagine
[4:01:28] yeah you were saying if you
[4:01:30] those with christ of course they'll see
[4:01:32] it
[4:01:33] those that don't they wouldn't even see
[4:01:35] it but i just was thinking what a moment
[4:01:37] that would be
[4:01:39] i'll change that statement
[4:01:41] what a moment that will be
[4:01:44] and i can tell you whatsapp servers will
[4:01:47] overload
[4:01:48] they won't quite understand why
