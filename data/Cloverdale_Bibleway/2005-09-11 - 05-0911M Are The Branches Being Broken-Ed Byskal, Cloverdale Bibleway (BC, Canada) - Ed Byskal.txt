Let's just approach him together with our hearts lifted up. Father, before we speak about our needs, we want to thank you, Lord. We want to open up our mouths, we want to give you glory. You are everything to us. We speak about grace, Lord. We have received your grace. It was unmmerited favor. We don't deserve it. We are still unworthy of it, but we receive it. We lift up our hands. We lift up our hearts. Thank you, wonderful Savior. Thank you for redemption, Lord. WE'RE HERE TO CELEBRATE YOUR LIFE THIS MORNING. IT IS NOT US. IT IS YOU. THIS IS NOT OUR WORK. THIS IS YOUR WORK. This is not anything that we've done. WE JUST SURRENDER. WE JUST YIELD. We just let you have your way. BUT WE DO WANT YOU TO HAVE YOUR WAY. We do want YOU TO HAVE YOUR WORK among us. We're all speaking to you together as a body individually. Have your way this morning. be glorified in the sanctuary. Jesus, we honor your name and we praise you, Father. We speak to you FROM OUR HEARTS. WE LOVE YOUR APPEARING. We love what YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST. We love what you're doing today. WE LOOK FORWARD to the future, Father. But Lord, we just want to be in your spirit right now. [music] Many have come this morning. Our hearts have been looking forward to this day. Communion, footwashing, many coming up from Seattle and Tacoma in the areas and our hearts are waiting before you for communion. Us speaking to you and you speaking back. There's needs among us, Father. This is the house of prayer. This is the house of deliverance. This is a house of healing. This is the place where miracles happen. This is the place where your word is lifted up. This is the place where your thoughts are lifted up beyond our own thoughts. Man is not GLORIFIED HERE. YOU ARE GLORIFIED. So would you receive victory by touching lives, breaking down walls, delivering lives that are bound, filling us with the Holy Spirit, even myself. FATHER, WE DESIRE a fresh baptism today. Your spirit to come among us. Move out across the lines to our sister MARGE MILLER. SHE'S CALLED IN. SHE BELIEVES. We believe with her. May the Holy Spirit come into the room. MAY THE POWER OF GOD DESCEND THROUGH OUR SISTER'S BODY. ALLOW her to take in food and be strengthened. Oh God, TOUCH HER. LORD JESUS, WE believe you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. You haven't changed. Times have changed. LEODYSIA WANTS US TO CHANGE, BUT WE WILL NOT CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR WORD. WE WILL DIE BELIEVING YOUR WORD IS TRUE. IT IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. Let our hearts BE FULL OF FAITH THIS morning that you're moving beyond what we can see. There's a realm that you're moving in. There's a realm, there's a dimension that we need TO OUR FAITH TO COME UP INTO. Forgive us of our sins, Lord. Forgive us of our iniquities. We're asking for grace this morning. We're asking for mercy. [music] We're asking for your hand to be upon each life, tenderizing us. Father, let us be lost in your SPIRIT TODAY. OUR PASTORS coming to bring the word. We're getting ready to step into another dimension. THESE TIMES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TIMES OF OUR LIVES. WE WANT TO enter in with the right attitude. Our hearts humble, God, to you and TO ONE ANOTHER. WE'RE NOT looking around. We're not looking to others. We need you this morning. We pray for our brother Terry John Tatch and this test that he's about TO ENTER INTO. WHAT YOU'VE done for brother Rod, WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HIS SONS. May our brother John, may he be rested. Let his mind be refreshed. Let him be ready. And may he do his part and may you come and do your part. MAY THERE BE A TESTIMONY, LORD, THAT YOU MOVED ON his behalf. You heard the prayers of the body. We believe with him. Lord, our sister Patty's mother might not make it through this day. Lord, you've been speaking to her family. Sister Patty's been a testimony. I pray right now the Holy Spirit would come inside of the room. Her mother's made her heart right with you. She's ready to go. I pray for the family, our sister Patty, Sister Kayla, that the comforting spirit of your presence would move into their hearts. May the peace of God that passes even our understanding be their portion. [music] and for other needs. Jesus, unspoken requests, hands were lifted up, hearts are waiting on you for direction and leadership. Our counsel comes from your word and what you say, we want it to be brought to pass in our lives. We give you this day, Lord. [music] We love you and we desire to love you more. So, just come by this place, this sacred place, and meet with us. We invite you now. And those on the internet, those on the phone hook up maybe needy in their body need a touch from you. Would you minister to them also in Jesus name? Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated. I want to welcome welcome everyone who's visiting with us today. Brother Jeremy, brother Aaron, and brother uh John have a special force. Why don't you come at this time? Get ready. Um well, we welcome uh everyone. And if you're here and and are visiting, we're just real happy to have you here with us. Um, we want to uh I got a note here from Brother Randy Snow and uh we want to officially welcome them into the church. He says he wanted to pass on thanks to everyone that helped uh to move their stuff. Um, and maybe we get Brother Randy, Sister Lori, Amanda, Jessica, Melissa, and Ryan to stand up wherever you're hiding. There they are. and they're uh they're officially here in the church now. So, I want to make sure everyone makes them real welcome. Randy is uh got the same kind of philosophy of life I had. You know, when I was a couple years ago, uh I think I was 47 or 48. My wife gave me a little plaque and said, "If you don't grow up by the time you reach age 50, you don't have to." And I hit 50 and I haven't yet. So, uh and Ry's kind of got the same philosophy as me. And uh so if you see, you know, me getting in trouble, it's probably Ry's fault. Um we want to be like little children, don't we? Did Jesus say we're supposed to be like little children? Amen. And uh we appreciate having Brother Randy and Sister Lori and the family here at the church, brothers. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I was oppressed [music] with the load that I [music and singing] carried. I needed something [music] to ease my troubled mind. [music] Then I [singing] met Jesus and all the change in [music] me. He gave me peace that I never thought could [music] be. [singing] I'm free. [music] I'm free. [music] Jesus blood [music] now [singing] covers me from [music and singing] the load of sin that so long I carry. [music and singing] I'm free. I'm free. [music] Thank God I'm free. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; How I can't explain it. This joy that now failed me. [music] Just knowing that my sins have all been washed away. I'm clean [music] and made whole. [singing] I have been redeemed. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus has given my soul liberty. [music] I'm free. [music] I'm free. Jesus [music] blood now covers me [music] from the load of sins that so [music] long I carry. I'm [singing] free. I'm [music] free. Thank God I'm free. [music] from the Lord [music] of sin that so long I carry. [singing] [music] I'm free. I'm free. [music] Jesus blood now [singing] covers me from the [music] load of sin that [singing] so long I carry. [music] I'm free. [music] I'm free. Thank [singing] God I'm [music] free. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brothers. You glad you're free. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. We want to uh remind everyone there's no Wednesday night service this week. There will be a Friday night service with our brother Derek Donaldson from down in New Zealand. And uh we're always uh look forward to having brother Derek with us. So uh remember no Wednesday night service, but there will be one on Friday night. Uh let's stand and sing together. We place you in the highest place. As brother Biscll is going to come now and bring the word. Let's be praying for our pastor. God would just give him complete liberty this morning to speak what's on the mind of God this morning to us. Amen. [music] We place you [singing] in the highest place. [music] for [singing] you. [music] How great you [music] I am. [singing] Oh, Lord. [singing] And we come [music] to you and we worship you. We worship you, Lord. [music and singing] We worship at your feet, Lord. [music] And we praise you. We praise you, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; For you and you alone. [singing] You are the prayer and please [music and singing] Lord. We praise you. [music] [singing] [music and singing] And we come [music] to you and we worship. We worship at your feet. [music and singing] Let's lift it up to [music] him. We we praise you in the highest place [music] for you. are the great I [music] am [music] forever [music] and we love you and worship [music] Father. [music] Amen. We're here to worship at his feet. Want to welcome you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as you have already been welcomed. And we're going to go quickly to the word, but I like you to be very mindful that I believe it's been announced already. When I say I believe, it's because our our our sound is not we're doing work up here and our sound is not coming through to the minister study. So, uh I I can only take it from the uh from the monitor and then I guess what's happening. Uh but uh this Wednesday is uh there's no service Wednesday and it's been put off till Friday because we have our brother Derek Donaldson from Auckland, New Zealand. Brother Donaldson, those of you that have heard our brother Donaldson before, we've been so blessed by his ministry each time he has been able to visit us. And he's a man I have a great deal of confidence in. Great deal of confidence. I've known him for a lot of years and he speaks from the very depth of his heart. He has a great burden and vision for other countries and the missions and God has used him. Uh we really respect him. Uh that's sister Anne Zeller's father and uh I believe sister uh sister Donaldson is here also. So, we just want to welcome them and welcome our brother Donaldson to the pulpit. He'll be speaking Friday and both services on next Sunday. I just want him to speak. You know what I do is I see how God is moving another part of the world and I know it's very very God is doing the same thing all over. Amen. We just want to be a part of everything that he's doing. Uh I'm going to have you turn in your Bibles to uh John the 15th chapter and then we're going to read from Romans 11. So uh if you'll just turn to John 15. And before we read, I would like to just have a word of prayer. Join with me in prayer. And we want to remember our brother Madden, uh, Brother Madden's father. He's still in the hospital in intensive care. And that's our brother Jedamir's father-in-law, his wife's dad, and brother and and sister uh uh sister Dena, her father. Our dear Lord Jesus, we are coming to you in that name that's above every name. That name at which our hearts even now bow in respect. Oh God, our heads are bowed to the soil from when once we have come. We realize that we are so helpless at times of great need. And we know that all life really truly rests in your hand. And so before we even turn to the word, we'd like to remember, oh God, that brother Madden's dad, his sister's father as well. And I pray, oh God, and for his mother that you will cause faith, that perfect faith to be in their hearts now. And that you shall raise our brother up, oh God. Stabilize his heart. Speak to his heart, oh God. And may his heart not be troubled anymore. I pray. I pray that it'll stabilize and he'll be strengthened. and we ask for it in the name of Jesus Christ. May the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus be his portion today. Oh God, I ask Father you'll bless us especially now as we just turn to your word. Anoint our eyes as we read our hearts and minds to receive. And above all things, may the Holy Spirit reveal the context and the content. bless the people, Lord, each one in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I'm going to read from uh the first verse uh just down through verse two and three, I believe it is. I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. Turn also please to Romans the 11th chapter. Now Jesus is speaking here individually of the branches dwelling in the vine. Paul now is speaking about the whole nation of Israel and the Gentiles. and he has them likened to uh a vine. The vine the original vine being Israel and the branches that have been grafted in as the Gentiles. So just to keep that in your mind now um we'll start at verse 13 of 11 of Romans. For I speak to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office, if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. For if the casting away of them, that's the Jews, be the reconciling of the world, because the gospel went to the Gentiles, what shall the receiving of them be, or the gathering back of them, but life from the dead, which can be nothing other than the resurrection? For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy. And if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou the Gentiles, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root, and the fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou beest not the root, but the root thee. Thou will say then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well, because of unbelief, they were broken off, and thou standest by faith, be not high minded, but fear. [clears throat] For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he also spare thee not. Behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again. Uh, for if thou w cut off, I'm sorry, for if thou w cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how shall how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. We are certainly in uh remarkable time that we're living in right now and fullness of the Gentiles. I tell you when we have received the last messenger uh to the gentile age we are are certainly there we've certainly arrived there now I would like to just set in motion the service set your thoughts in in line if you can stay with me now Paul the apostle and brother Brandham as a last messenger they both spoke on a national and international level and also individually. They would speak to the individual but they spoke on the a national level and so uh they would speak and say certain thing not being specific but this kind of condition will exist this kind of thing will happen but not come down to specific details of how that may take place. You know, we can say, well, until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. Fine. But how what will take place? What kind of events will happen so that we would know that the fullness of the Gentiles has come in? When is that going to arrive? What will be the climactic event? What will be the events that will lead up to it? You see, and uh so there's there's all kinds of perhaps background. Now, here we are. We're living day to day and we see the news and hear the things that are taking place and see the conditions that are around us and naturally uh we we we you know we we we're just all taken up with what we are facing with day by day by day but I find that a messenger will uh he will get to give one encompassing statement and it involves a whole lot of smaller things and we may get lost in the details. We may get so lost in the details that we don't really see what is happening. Now, uh Jesus was speaking about the nature of the life in the vine. And so, I'd like to speak on an individual basis here for a few moments on an individual uh the life that was in the vine. and uh uh and how uh Paul is speaking of how God's dealings with Israel was. Uh Jesus said, "I am the vine and you're the branches." Brother Brandham refers to that and says, "And the life that's in the vine goes into the branch to bear the fruit, fruit bearers, and every limb that doesn't bring forth good fruit is heed off in the token." And I'll be referring to some of the things he said in the token. He said, "If that first branch came forth, that branch out of that vine that wrote a book of Acts behind it, if that vine ever puts forth another branch, they'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life." And that's the significant statement because it's the same life in the confirmation of the commission in that message. He said he doesn't bear the fruit. That is Jesus doesn't bear the fruit. He said but he energizes you and I. We're the fruit bearers. You are the fruit bearers. We receive the Holy Spirit so we can be fruit bearers. It's not God that bears the fruit. He energizes us and we bear the fruit. He says, and he says, "And he energizes you and I that we could understand one another and through voices that he speaks to us." He's referring to his own ministry there. And does his work to confirm the commission that we're sent to do because he was speaking about confirmation of his commission. Other branches can be grafted in. I'm just my own notes now. But will only produce their own fruit. You can take an orange or a citrus plant. And he says you can take a citrus tree like an orange and you can take a limb off of a grapefruit and uh split a little place in the orange tree and put in a grapefruit. It'll grow. It'll grow grapefruits. my uncle down in Seattle who's passed away now and he had a pear tree and he had several varieties of pears growing on that tree and each branch was bearing its own special type of pear and it was just so remarkable. I hadn't actually seen it. Brother Brandon was talking about having seen it and as long as they're like in the same line a citrus fruit, it would grow tangelos and grapefruits and lemons and so on. But it's thriving on the real vine. But now, Apostle Paul is talking about an olive uh a natural olive and then the wild olive being grafted into it and receiving of that same life that's in in the vine. Now I want to just draw your attention to the nature. The nature I'd like to dwell on that for it'll be more or less the kind of the theme and and the subject this morning is really quite broad. And so I pray that God will give you understanding and give me the uh ability to bring it to you as he has brought it to me. The nature of the branch and the word that is used for nature in the scripture is not only the nature of things but the force and the laws the order of nature. Now I want to quickly because of the move of God that's been happening amongst our young people. I want them to especially listen because you were born and came into the world by natural birth and you have a natural you have a nature. Now that nature needs to be developed and that is the task of our parents as parents and that is why it's so important to have godly parents. So godly parents can develop that nature. But there's something else. We all have something in our natures. Every person has something in their nature that they wish they didn't have. We'd like to rid ourselves of certain things in our nature. And I won't I won't uh belabor that point, but that is so I believe that is so. I've never met anybody but what saw some flaw or weakness or something in their nature and they just wish they didn't have it. Well, there is another nature and that's called the divine nature. And the scriptures very specific and very powerfully state that by the promises of God, we become partakers of the divine nature of God. That nature is in it is infinitely more powerful than the nature which you received by your natural birth. in fact is it over not only overpowers that nature but it it can it takes some qual it takes some things I would need to qualify that statement we must be yielded people we must yield to the Holy Spirit because God's not going to force it on us as we partake of the word of God as we believe it and as we believe it we become uh recipients of the divine nature And if we will just yield and remain in that atmosphere of God. That's why brother Brandham speaks about the prophets that went out into the wilderness. He said they stayed SO LONG IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TILL I mean they were they were they came back with the word of God &gt;&gt; and they were called gods because they received the word of God and they remained so long in the presence of God that they were they were godlike people. And I can tell you if you and I remain in the presence of God and that Holy Spirit just keeps infusing us, you will go out into the world and you'll be you'll be a a a God person. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And that nature will find its place in you. Even the spiritual nature needs to be developed. And we can either give ourselves to our natural nature or give ourselves to the spiritual nature. Now our natural nature will work against the uh principles of God's word very often. There are some people and we're all made so very very different. There's some people that seem more adapted to spiritual things and others are you know almost like renegades or whatever more and have a harsh nature whatever more. But but you take the Apostle Paul and brother Brandham talks about James and such a prayer warrior and and Peter, you know, he's a uh he he just impetuous type of person and and Apostle Paul, he was scholarly, but he was almost you can see almost harsh in that sense. BUT GOD HE GOD didn't eradicate them. He didn't eradicate those things out of them. He took control of those things and used them to his glory. He brought that nature subject to the divine nature. Can you say amen? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And so this nature that this word that is used is not only the nature of things but it is the force. It is law. It is a law. The nature is a law. the order of nature and uh it has to do with the very life that comes from God by the Holy Spirit. Now, now our nature by our natural birth, it did not come to it didn't manifest immediately. Little by little, the infant that's born, you don't see much of a nature there. But as time goes on, it begins to express itself. It may be real quiet and passive. And there can be there can be more than one child. It's be perhaps born in a family. And you'll just wonder how in the world these children with such a vastly different nature. How do they come from the same parents? You know, one is just so passive and quiet and the next one is so active you can't hardly get your hands on them. And that's the way they are. We are that way. Then that nature needs to be needs to be developed. But it doesn't manifest right away. Now when a child is a stillborn child, say just still born and doesn't come and that breath of life doesn't come into it. It's the conception may be perfect. The birth may be flawless. Everything happens just great. But it doesn't take that breath of life into it. You never know. No one will ever know what kind of a child that was going to be. Might have been a gifted child, might have been a talented child, might have been who knows what. But the life that was in it, there was nothing to animate that nature that it may have had. And so we don't know what kind of a child it was going to be in a stillborn. And we have all kinds of people today in the religious world that they have the seed of God and they can have all kinds of things in order. But if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and acknowledge that that is indeed his word, his truth, his message for the hour, that church or whoever they are will never manifest. &gt;&gt; It's nothing more than a a religious stillborn. &gt;&gt; Might sound harsh, but that's what I believe it is. Now, [clears throat] uh Solomon said in Proverbs, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he will not depart from it." And to train up does not speak of a profession, but rather of moral character. Train up a child in his in his moral character, and he'll when he's old, he will not depart from it. Now, the very nature and character of Jesus Christ is available to us all by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We do need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And for those of you that have been baptized in water, I want you to know that the Holy Spirit is waiting and perhaps has already taken up his residency, but he is waiting for full residency to abide in you because he's going to bring the life of Jesus Christ into you. And that divine nature is going to control your natural nature. The desires that you have had, they're going to become subjected to the very life of Jesus Christ. And the things that you once loved, you'll find them e away. And as apostle Paul said, the things I once loved, I now hate. And the things I once hated, I now love. What brought that reversal because initially he was going by his own nature and he had his character and he had developed it and all right and his perhaps his mother and father maybe sent him. I don't know who got him to the feet of Galo, but he was a great student and he had a he he he was talented and gifted. You can see that in all of his letters. But now what happened when the things and he said those things I learned I counted as dung that I might win Christ. &gt;&gt; What is it? Another life came into him. Another nature came into him that that brought the nature the human person BROUGHT IT INTO SUBJECTION. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. He still had all his mental capacity, still had all of his retention, still had all of those things, but now it was brought subject to the spirit and word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the nature is the nature, the divine nature. Now, in the token, we're going to be having the Lord's table tonight, communion, and foot washing. Brother Lance will be speaking this evening and we're going to have a great time. Now, a lot of a lot of you young people, I want to announce to you that you may have participated, some may not have participated in communion, footwashing, never never feeling that they were ready for it. Others perhaps have taken it, but I'd like to say that I believe there's a good number of you that have never participated in communion and footwashing at the level that you will tonight. I want you to come with expectation because you'll say, "I took some major steps. I made some decisions. God honored those decisions. The Holy Spirit moved on me. And if he moved on me, uh, he didn't move on me just for some idle purpose. He moved on me with a divine plan in his mind. And I'm here tonight to move on and to take another step and to take this blessed communion and remember the Lord's death and his resurrection and to do the foot washing with my brother and my sister and at a different level. I've never done this before at this level. Amen. Now he said the animal life, see the animal life could not come back upon the human being because it was an animal. It couldn't come back upon the human being. When the blood was shed, the life went out. He said because it was a unit. But when the life's blood was gone from it, the life being different from the blood because he says there is a blood. There's the life in the blood and there's a soul in the life or the soul is the nature of the life. So there's the blood which is just a chemistry and there's a life in the blood for he said the life is in the blood but within that life is the soul and the soul is the nature of the life. Now the animal didn't have a soul. So when it died and as a sacrifice as a substitute all there was was the chemistry of the blood and the life which departed the body of the animal but that life could not come back onto the believer. So the man or the man for his household take the Passover lamb or as a sin sacrifice. He would take the animal, take it to the priest, lay his hand upon the head, thus identifying himself. This innocent animal is dying for my transgression and I am identifying myself with it. So I put my hand upon it and the priest begins to slay this animal. Of course, it doesn't want to die. It flails around and blood sprinkles over the transgressor and and and the life departs the animal and the blood goes to the to to the earth. The blood goes one direction, the life goes another direction, but the life can't come back on the on the transgressor and he goes out with the same nature. He's sorry when he comes in. He's gone to his flock. He's brought the he's brought the animal according to the word of God. He wants to be forgiven. He wants to find mercy. AND THAT HE does in that his sins are covered but not gone. &gt;&gt; His nature remains the same. So he goes there and the animal dies, the life goes, the blood goes, and they're separated and uh and the man walks out with the same nature &gt;&gt; that he had when he walked in. Right. &gt;&gt; But now we have the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in Isaiah 53, if you care to read it, I may come to a little later, says he poured out his soul onto death. He he actually dispensed with the very divine nature of God. And the one who could carry that would be the Holy Spirit of God. So the spirit of God has to take that nature that was released by God at Calvary WHEN THAT SACRIFICE DIED AND THAT nature literally literally comes. It's not in the mind. THIS IS THIS IS AN ACTUAL EVENT. IT ACTUALLY COMES INTO THE INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; How did your spirit come into you? You don't know. You have a human spirit. You don't know how it came into you. You took a BREATH AT YOUR BIRTH. YOU WEREN'T even aware of it. The doctor perhaps gave you a spank or whatever more and you began to cry and out and the spirit entered your body. And when you take your last breath, when you take your last breath exhale, that spirit will actually leave you and you'll be nothing more than clay. &gt;&gt; That's all you are. And the dust will go back to dust and ashes. And the spirit will depart your body. You don't know how that spirit came into you, but it was a real event &gt;&gt; and you made some noise when it happened. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes into you, &gt;&gt; you want you young people and all others, if you have not received it, you want to know that this is a promise of God THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD HAS SENT WITH A COMPLETE with a mission. He's sent with a mission TO BRING THE DIVINE NATURE INTO THIS BRANCH SO THAT THIS BRANCH can bring forth fruit of the same kind. That's the plan of God. And that's how it happens. And I say, "Oh God, LET THAT SPIRIT OF GOD FLOW like a fountain, like a river, like a LIKE A RAIN UPON the people of God." Maybe even during this service, throughout this day, tonight, say, "Oh God, fill me. Fill me with the Holy Ghost. Seal me with your divine spirit and let the very divine nature of God. That spirit can only believe and agree with this word. &gt;&gt; And it's by believing it that the divine nature begins to function and operate in an individual believing every word of God. Satan is such a subtle &gt;&gt; creature and how he will get a a a family or a couple or an individual and and you know in your own heart there gets a twinge down there just a slight little twinge. This isn't exactly the way the word of God calls for it to be. And I I don't really feel good about it but I'm SO PRESSED. AND SATAN USES ALL KINDS of things. HE'LL USE A educational program. Oh, he'll use the jobs that we have. He'll use every kind. He'll use friends. He'll use all kinds of things. He'll use family obligations. He'll use all kinds of things to get a person to start moving outside of the sphere of the promise of God. And once he gets a person out there, then the Holy Spirit cannot function and operate the way that the way that God desires it to be. And that person will find themselves reverting to their own nature. &gt;&gt; You follow that? &gt;&gt; They'll find themselves reverting to their own nature. But when you're when you're under under the influence of the Holy Spirit, when you're in the company of believers, you are affected. You are affected. When you're under the sound of the gospel, when you're under the constant uh sound of the message of the hour, when you're absorbing it and taking it in, I can tell you even when you may not realize it, there's that move, that twinge, that that voice that's speaking, it's guiding, it's influencing you, it's affecting you, it's it's bringing a godly conscience to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. the animal life. It's been some years and I just went through and kind of detailed how when the lamb came and the body in the Passover lamb, the body was taken and eaten and the blood went to the doorpost and the lentil of the door and the life went back to the creator who gave it. and it could never come back together again. But when Jesus died, the body went to the tomb. The spirit ascended and then came back into the believer. The blood, the chemistry actually went and stained the earth to claim it in redemption. But now, &gt;&gt; it all began to come back. &gt;&gt; This land began to come together again. Hallelujah. was the only one that could come together again. &gt;&gt; Amen. All a unit came back together and we're part of that unit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit came back down into us. And the prophet says the word the bleeding word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The content of of the the blood, the efficacy of it. And then brother Brandon goes on in the token. And he says, "Because it could not come upon a human being, because the animal life doesn't have a soul." And the animal, notice what his next sentence is. It's it's rather strange, but it's in certainly in the correct place. The animal doesn't know that he's naked and he doesn't realize sin. The animal doesn't have a soul and because he doesn't have a soul, he doesn't realize he's naked. Makes me wonder how far people have gone from their soul today when we see what's around us in the cities and the streets and so on. &gt;&gt; Naked and don't know it. From the from the nature of the life in the soul comes the knowledge of nakedness. So I I'm just making that statement because I'm going to be coming back to it. From the nature of the life in the soul comes a knowledge of nakedness. And so now if there is no God conscience within a individual they can stoop to nakedness and not know it. And what is that? It's an animal nature. That's not the God nature. It's just the animal nature. He said, "Now there's a life, a blood, and a soul in the life." Which I said, and he said, "The soul is the nature of the life." He said, "Now therefore, the blood, the just the blood, the chemistry stood, it stood for a token. A token, a token is just a sign." So you have the sign that a life was given. &gt;&gt; But there's a difference between the blood and the life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to make these statements now. The token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So now the token is a sign the Holy Ghost in an individual is a sign that a life was given for you. &gt;&gt; And now the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost that life comes into the individual. And he goes on to say in the same now we are living in the shadows. I have a specific reason for saying these things. Now we are living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike. And God's requiring a token that you yourself have received his token, the Holy Ghost. It's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass. Said, "I'll pass over you." But he said that's the only sign he'll ever pass over because it is the literal notice not the imagination but the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer. Oh we feel so unworthy. We feel so what shall I say so much shortcoming of the life of Christ. But yet it's essential, absolutely essential that every believer confesses what the word of God has said. And you need to say, "I have received and I am the recipient of the life of Jesus Christ, not in my mind, but the very literal life of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit." Because thus saith the word of God, not thus sayeth how I feel this morning, thus saith the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel the very weakest when you're in a time of need, but that's the time you need to trust what the word of God has said about it. He poured out his soul unto death. If you want the verse, it's Isaiah 53:12. Therefore, I will divide him a portion with the great, speaking of Jesus. and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death. And he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of ma of many and made intercession for the transgressors. Now you see when Adam sinned Adam and Eve and God said in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now he didn't die immediately but what he did was he lost his god nature. &gt;&gt; He lost his way. And the scripture says that the cherubams protected the way of the tree of life. It isn't they protected the way of life which was the tree of life. They didn't have to protect the tree of life. They protected the way of the tree of life. and the way he lost he lost his his god uh uh wisdom he lost his god knowledge he lost his god consciousness and it finally ebbed away and that is why it wasn't very long before people were very very deep into their transgression now it is Peter that has said and I'd like now to refer to the nature of the life of Christ also also needs to be nurtured Ed, we can't just, you know, come to church and say, "Well, here I am. Now I'm here to hear a few things." And go out and forget, not only forget perhaps the things that we've heard, but uh we're just completely occupied with all kinds of other things. Brother John Andy spoke to the uh all the young people. We had a marvelous crowd. Had a just an incredible time together on Friday night. and he spoke to them and had a PowerPoint uh presentation on uh prayer, on study, on reading, on witnessing and the various aspects of the practical side of living a life for Christ. And we need those things instilled within us. And you might say, now why are we doing that? That sounds almost like a uh like a school lesson. Well, that is how we have our natural nature developed our by our natural birth. And the spiritual birth certainly requires the same things. We need to have a diligent time when we take time to pray, when we take time to study, when we take time to witness, when we take time to live it. Because what we're doing is we're developing that nature. We we we can't earn that nature. We can't buy that nature. We receive that nature, but it needs to be developed. &gt;&gt; Whereby are given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. So faith believing the promises will produce the divine nature. And faith believing the promises will cause you and I to live differently, &gt;&gt; to respond differently. &gt;&gt; We will react differently. &gt;&gt; We will be the a different kind of a brother or sister. Our relationships will be different. Our appetites will be different. Our words coming out of our mouth will be different because they'll be guided by the scripture. And when we when we bring ourselves into subjection by the Holy Spirit to the word of God, believing the word of God, then God acts upon that. The Holy Spirit, even the the high priest acts upon that. And it may be a time of sickness or whatever more. The high priest acts upon that. But then when it comes to a time and we all en encounter these times we say oh you know uh my natural my natural life would respond in a certain way I I I I feel like just giving him a piece of my mind but there's another nature &gt;&gt; that is within you and it's overriding that nature and uh you know it's not just your self self-control it's not self-control. I call it God control. And in a congregation of people in our homes, in our jobs, we need that kind of practical living. And it comes by the Holy Spirit. And so I want all the young people especially who have received a special touch from God say, "God, I know that that's not the end of it. This is just the very beginning." And some people they may even go for some years and never really receive that infusion of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Colossians, Paul goes on in Colossians and he says, "Rooted and built up in him." Rooted. We haven't only come into Christ, but we're rooted and built up in him and established in the faith. In in first Peter, Peter goes on to say, "And you also as lively stones are built up." A spiritual house. It's not enough just to be a lively stone, but a lively stone that needs to be built up. The ministry is involved in this. And you are involved in this. You make yourself available. You you create an atmosphere. You come into the house of God. You don't just come in to, you know, to put in a couple of hours of a Sunday morning or a Sunday night. That's not the purpose. You come in, you're in anticipation. You're in expectation. This is my family. God is my father. His spirit is present. His word is present. And I am present. And I'm believing his word. I know that THAT COMBINATION IS A POWERFUL COMBINATION. AND I WILL RECEIVE SOMETHING FROM GOD. AND THEN WHEN I RECEIVE IT, I WILL BE A BENEFIT TO SOMEONE WHO'S BESIDE ME OR SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY. I WON'T BE A DETRIMENT. I WILL BE A BLESSING TO THEM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's God's program built up, developed &gt;&gt; in the divine nature. And so the preaching of Apostle Paul was often taken in a negative way. He even said, "Have I become your enemy because I told you the truth." &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the apostle Paul was for edification, for building up, and not for destruction. &gt;&gt; He said in 2 Corinthians 10:8, "For though I should boast somewhat more than more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, not for your destruction." He said, "I should not be ashamed." So he said, "Though I boast, though I should boast," he didn't say that he did boast, but he said, "Though I should boast, uh, somewhat more of our authority which the Lord hath given us for edification." It's for building up the instruction or the counsel that we receive from God. Sometimes it's not really what we want to hear, but that kind of edi edification and counsel is to build you up. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's to develop that nature that God has made available to you. And the Holy Spirit is in you and he wants to he wants to express that nature. Oh beloved nature of Jesus Christ. The one who God looked upon and said, "I'm pleased with that life." That's the life I I'm sure I can speak on your behalf. That's the life we want to express. Now [clears throat] I'm going to go off on a different angle just so you can put it together. Now I want to go on a national level and I want to speak about the nation of Israel because Apostle Paul and this probably will be maybe a little bit of a surprise to you but and I just hope that you can I wrestled with it a bit while I was studying and waiting on God for this service and I've been on this for some time. A lot of a lot of you people like to erase something that I think is they think, well, I I study on Saturday. That's a day I try to take a little time off, but I haven't been successful yet. But any minister, he doesn't study on Saturday. He's studying for maybe a week or two weeks on a subject, and I have been on this subject probably for two weeks and a good part of this week on it. Israel as a nation was planted. God said as a noble vine. He said, "And I will dwell," he said to Moses, "I will dwell among the people, the children of Israel, and will be their God." Isn't that marvelous? I will dwell among them through the first prophet that was on the earth, Moses. I will dwell among them and I will be their God. I God will dwell among them. The supernatural God. I'm going to dwell among you. Wouldn't it be marvelous? You just hear that this morning from an authorative voice. I'm going to dwell among you. You're not asking you. You are you inviting me. Said I'm going to dwell among you and I'm going to be your God. I'd say even so, Lord. HALLELUJAH. EVEN SO. I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING better this morning. And even though that was God's intent and that's what he was referring to when he went back uh to Jeremiah and that is many many years later centuries later. So now initially God planted them as a noble vine and I will dwell among them and Israel was taught nurtured under the best that God could send them his holy prophets and godly kings. They had many wicked ones also. But they were nurtured and they were tutored by their prophets. They were blessed as they heard the word and they were cursed when they refused it. &gt;&gt; And so God now cries through Jeremiah. Jeremiah is called the weeping prophet. He says, "Yet I planted thee a noble vine holy, wholy," not hy, but completely holy. A right seed. I planted you a noble vine and completely a right seed. And he ASKED THE QUESTION, HOW THEN? &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; ART thou turned into a degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? And the strange vine if you take those words and and I have taken them in detail. The strange vine like he SAYS HOW DID YOU BECOME A STRANGE WOMAN TO ME? AND THE PROPHET said Israel was Jehovah's wife. &gt;&gt; He says how you become a strange WOMAN TO ME. IN FACT IS IT COMES BACK FURTHER down and it says how you become a harlot to me. &gt;&gt; How you become a strange how you become a degenerate. I planted you as a holy vine, a noble vine. And then how did this happen? Although they had the glory as Paul said in Romans 9, who are Israelites? Paul, he was gripped with a compassion and burden for his people. He said, "Who are Israelites to whom pertainth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises?" YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN ALL OF THIS. And who are whose are the fathers and of whom are as concerning the flesh Christ came who is overall God blessed forever. They're Israelites and all of these things pertain to them. The adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises. And that's what that that's what God was saying. I've given you all these things and I planted you a noble vine. How did then you become a degenerate plant and a stranger to me? God spoke and I'm going to just give some detail now how it happened. God spoke to in Exodus. He says as instruction, "Thou shalt not dwell in thy land. They rather I'm sorry they and he was just speaking of some other nations. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me. For if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. And Satan has not ceased. He's changed the scenery. Right? &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't have little gods, idol gods like so of gold and whatever more. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a there's a family and I think they're probably listening to me right now and they were given a a a gold object, solid pure gold object of a figure and it was just given them. They didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it. And uh then they begin to look into it. They I think whether someone told them or they discovered it was really a very valuable object and they found out it find found out later it was extremely valuable worth many many thousands of dollars. And then they discovered that it was a a god. It had been made a god. No doubt people worshiped it. And it came way down from Central America. And you know what they did? They took that and melted it down to nothing and took it out to their driveway out next to the highway and poured it in the ground. Let it go back. Now, none of you come and ask me which driveway that is. I'm not going to tell you. I know the driveway, too. But I never went there with my shovel. That thing's gone down there. They said, "If this is a god, it only deserves to go to the fire and goes to the fire and it'll just pour it out in the ground and forget we ever had the thing." I SAY, "GOD BLESS THEM." And they're probably listening right now and they know exactly what I'm talking about. So I say, "God bless them." But they God is saying to Moses, you know, there's all kinds of gods that became a God. We have gods and goddesses and everything else. As far as I'm concern concerned, all the stardom of Hollywood of sports &gt;&gt; of singers and entertainers is nothing but idolatry in the highest sense of the word. It's idolatry. And people give themselves over, not merely listen to it, but they emulate them. Emulate them in their movements. Emulate them in their hairstyles. Emulate them in their dress. Whatever more I say it's idolatry. &gt;&gt; Do you support that? &gt;&gt; And don't give them any room in YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WILL BE A SNARE UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's a snare. AND SATAN WILL TRY TO UH SQUEEZE OUT and to squaltch the work of the Holy Spirit IN YOUR LIFE BY THOSE THINGS, BUT THEY'RE SO INNOCENT. IT'S JUST SO INNOCENT. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A spirit it packs. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just a magazine, is it? &gt;&gt; It's just some true love story. True. &gt;&gt; Probably the most false thing you'd have in your home. I trust you don't have it in your home. I'd rid myself of that stuff. &gt;&gt; Those things that come from that that that kind of element and uh the whole world is given over to it. I personally think that the people will go mad into insanity when when California sanks. not over financial loss perhaps so much as over the loss of their idols &gt;&gt; and I don't see them on television tomorrow I don't see them in the movie tomorrow or whatever more the loss of their gods and their goddesses and the prophet brother Brandham declared very very clearly that America had made woman their god goddess that's been said &gt;&gt; and that's been declared. &gt;&gt; And so, and then God spoke through Jeremiah and he said that the people would say to a stalk or just to a piece of wood, "Thou art my father and to a stone, thou hast brought me forth. For they have turned their back unto me and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us. So in the time THIS IS SO SUCH A WEAKNESS HUMAN weakness that they'll go in their own direction but then suddenly in A TIME OF TROUBLE OH SAVE US SAVE US. YOU NEVER HEAR them say oh devil come to me GOD. GOD SAVE US. WHERE ARE YOU GOD HELP ME NOW? WHY DON'T YOU SAY THAT? And why don't they say that when they're in good health and when they got a body to serve God? That's the time to give themselves to that. serve him with all of YOUR STRENGTH AND ALL OF YOUR MIND AND ALL OF your youth and all of the all of your energy. I believe that's what would be pleasing to him. And then he said also in Jeremiah 32:33, "And they have turned unto me that back and not the face, though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them." SO THEY HAD THE opportunity to be nurtured in the in the things of God, in the ways of God. But he said he taught them and he rising up early, teaching them, and yet they've not hearkened to receive instruction. So you see, uh, people, it comes down to very, very practical living. &gt;&gt; That's really what it boils down to. It's a very, VERY PRACTICAL LIFE. IT'S wonderful to come into the house of God and be all enthused. I want to see that. It's wonderful to, you know, clap our hands when the when the songs are being sung and worship God. That's just marvelous. I love that. I love to hear that. I'm glad we have that kind of that kind of freedom and and it's uh the exuberance of serving God. It's marvelous. But on the other hand, when the Monday morning comes, as we said, brother DJI spoke about when the Monday morning comes after the camp or after the meeting or tomorrow morning comes, we want to see that our course is still set and we are unmovable. This is the order of my life. This is the way I conduct it. This is the way my life is. This is the way our home is. This is the way we serve God. And we will NOT BE DETERRED from that. That's what God honors. That's what God honors. We're not one thing here and another thing tomorrow. We're the same thing. And I can tell you that the when God knows it, the devil also knows it. &gt;&gt; And he knows he can't do anything with that kind of uh dedication and consecration. And that's what God honors. Now, Israel as a nation, they didn't only turn their back and, you know, they went into bondage and so on and so forth. They ultimately ultimately I would say committed the greatest of sin. They rejected the very word himself. As a nation they don't believe it yet. That's 2,000 over 2,000 years ago or thereabouts that they rejected the word of God their God. But they do not believe that to this day. They have not been convinced in 2,000 years. Even with everything that they've gone through, they are not convinced that they have rejected the word of God. But they rejected the very word himself. And they cried out, "Let his blood be on us and on our children." And I will say now the branches were broken off the vine and that life was no longer flowing there. And over many years and centuries I can say that the consequences of that decision that they took and crucified the Lord Jesus Christ, the nation has paid a most horrific price. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we've moved along that far. Now I take a a quote and it's in Jezebel religion and the prophet said it is striking to see the parallel between Israel of the Old Testament and America now. Both of them were great nations. Both of them had been founded and [clears throat] their people had come there because excuse me of religious persecutions. Said it's striking the parallel. Now we've just come 2 3,000 years and we've come right forward. See things really haven't changed a whole lot. The scenery has changed, but as far as man and woman is concerned, as far as nations, as far as government, as far as all those things, that really hasn't changed a whole lot. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Israel had been persecuted by Pharaoh and had been in bondage for hundreds of years where they were deprived of worshiping the true and living God and had been deprived of their privilege and they become slaves. But God had made them a promise in his Bible or in his word and by his prophets that he'd give them a land and they'd come into this land and drove back the occupants of that land and he possessed their inheritance and had to possess their inheritance inheritance. For God had a purpose in doing that. He had a purpose in doing that. So they came into their land, drove back their the occupants. He said that's exactly America was established on exactly the same principles came came here for the purpose of freedom of worship and they wanted to escape the persecution of the hierarchy of the church that they had been so subjected to and persecuted severely. Christians have been s persecuted enormously by the Roman Empire and that power in the message hear ye him said the Holy Spirit when you receive it in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ dwelling in you and Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them. The fruit that the branch bears tells what the vine is. And so now the vine Israel moved out wanted freedom to worship their God. America was founded on those same exact principles. [clears throat] I will say the vine that God planted in a land that would be called America. And I I do not put any difference between United States and Canada for the balance of this message. None whatsoever. In fact, as brother Brandham said, we'd we'd be exactly the same. And we are in tested. Now, just stay with me a few moments here. In tested faith produces goods. Uh uh don't know exactly. It's all abbreviated. He said, "New England, excuse me, here's where our forefathers landed for this freedom of religion on Plymouth Rock. It's from these sacred soils here that praying men and women went forth to establish this great spiritual economy." Amen. &gt;&gt; I WONDER HOW comfortable &gt;&gt; those brethren who landed at Plymouth Rock WOULD BE TODAY. &gt;&gt; HOW COMFORTABLE would they be to walk the streets of any one of our cities. &gt;&gt; I believe that they would BE SHOCKED. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SHAMED. I BELIEVE that they would wonder what it was they actually participated in in in founding. I believe they would WONDER AND SAY, "HOW DID THIS TURN INTO SUCH A DEGENERATE PLANT? &gt;&gt; HOW DID THIS BECOME SO DEGENERATED?" &gt;&gt; And they may wonder what some of us wonder from time to time. Is there anything to save? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said, "No American could be ashamed of their forefathers who landed in this country and went to church packing their guns, who came here for freedom of religion and went on horseback and covered in old WAGONS AND FOUGHT AND SO FORTH. fought the Indians and so forth to get to go to church and their blood bathed the soil. NOW THIS IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH OF THE MESSAGE AS the seals is. &gt;&gt; This is the message. He said in the South Africa testimony, I think of Plymouth Rock and how our forefathers fought for this freedom of religion. And today I see what would they do? these old ministers back in those days to see the way things are going that we need a real good old-fashioned nationwide Holy Ghost sent revival to shake this nation. He said, "We really do. And without that, I'm afraid we're going to perish." Friends, talked about godly leaders, the parallel, the striking parallel between Israel and America. and America upon the bases of our forefathers who came here for religious freedoms. He said we had godly men in them days as leaders. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, men of renowned character, men of God. America was America in those days. George Washington here at Valley Forge before he crossed the Delaware praying all night until he was wet plum to his waist, kneeling in snow. And the next morning when the Americans started across, there's only about 20% of them that had shoes to wear, the American army, and they had a principle. They had something that they had to fight for. They didn't care what came or went. The farmers came in and stomped his plow AND TOOK OUT HIS OX and got his rifle AND WENT TO FIGHT for what he knew was freedom. And that day he said, I believe it was four or five bullet holes, musket uh bullets went through his coat and never touched him. He goes on to to speak about how it was founded, &gt;&gt; how the vine, what kind of vine was planted, &gt;&gt; not 4,000 years ago, but even just A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, &gt;&gt; I will say all the world powers that involve themselves with Israel and the affairs of Israel. come under the direct effect of the hand of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; And all world POWERS HAVE FOUND it and made it their business to tamper with Israel. And when they did, they always conducted their affairs and their influence in a way that was CONTRARY TO THE PROMISE OF GOD AND THEN CAME under a negative or I to say uh came under the severity of God. &gt;&gt; All world powers, Egypt used them as slaves. Nebuchadnezzar had them exiled for 70 years in Babylon. And where are they today? Where's the pharaohs? Where's Egypt? They're gone. Blown away. Where's Nebuchadnezzar? Where's a Where's a beautiful Babylon? It's gone. &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT REASON? NOT BECAUSE ANOTHER nation rose up that was more powerful than them. BECAUSE THEY TAMPERED WITH ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; That's the reason. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of this word is the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; And I know that you believe that. &gt;&gt; And then David said, "By the rivers of Babylon, THERE WE SAT DOWN. YAY, we wept. We were we remembered Zion." They remembered Zion. And here they are in A FOREIGN COUNTRY. HOW CAN WE sing here in this kind of condition? And then they come under the cruel Roman rule which was there when Jesus was there. And God allowed these world powers of time to revel in their glory until their glory faded and their power diminished and they became morally corrupt from within. &gt;&gt; I don't know if any of you have had an opportunity such as I have. My wife and I, we were taken to Pompei. And the prophet says that when the sinking of Los Angeles happens, it'll be worse than the days of Pompei. But in Pompei, IT IS SO VILE AND SO PERVERTED. AND THE figures that are are are the the figures of the persons THAT WERE CAUGHT IN THE ashes from that great eruption that took place, IT TOOK THEM SO SUDDENLY. BUT POMPEI, IF YOU SEE IT, IT'S RAISED UP HIGH OVER THE over the ocean. You look down on the ocean AND OH, IT'S JUST SUNBATHED. It's such a beautiful place. And the climate is so uh marvelous. Just a wonderful climate. and and the people, the Roman officers, and we hear that hierarchy of the Roman government AFTER THEY CRUSHED ISRAEL AND burned Jerusalem were HAVING A BIG PARTY CELEBRATING THEIR VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Comes that eruption &gt;&gt; and the ash that came down on them. I see them. I see them right in the floor of their homes and they're and and and they're reaching out. Their hands are out. You see their fingers. You can see every part of the body. You can even see their teeth. AND IT CAUGHT them just like that and suffocated them. They're on their floor and the figures and they haven't moved them. Many of them are many of them are there. And you go into places and their houses of prostitution and brothel and the perversion and the homosexuality and all of these things. And they were and they WERE GLORIFYING THOSE THINGS. AND GOD DESTROYED THEM AND DESTROYED THE NATION AND DESTROYED THE EMPIRE BECAUSE THEY TAMPERED WITH HIS PEOPLE. The prophet says it's not the robin that pecks on the outside of the apple. It's the worm that's inside at the core. And he says it's the worm at the core that kills the apple. And he said, "And that's all of our own rottness among us. What it is, what's killing us is the moral decline that we have." Now the scripture which I read in the beginning uh but prior to that in Romans 1 says wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever. ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature. And likewise also men leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another. men with men, working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error, which was meat. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient. They worshiped the creature more than the creator. And the in the mark of the beast, the prophet said, "What did they do?" Do you mind me reading? He said they refuse to drink from the fountain of living water. What makes all these things in the world today? He said, "What makes these ladies wear little shorts? What makes them wear those blouses that you can see uh their clothes through?" What is it? It's hungry children. That's right. Thirsty. Blessed are you when you thirst and hunger after righteousness. Jesus said, "You will not come to me." That's what he said. They will not come. He said, "Listen, the reason they do it is because they have rejected the fountains of living water and have drunk from a Hollywood broken sister." &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to scream, "Amen." Because these things have never been so true as they are today. &gt;&gt; And the thing is, it isn't just that I'm speaking these things to this congregation. I'm speaking these things to this congregation because of the environment that we live in and we must not become accustomed to it. &gt;&gt; We must not say, "Well, I see so much of it. It must be okay." &gt;&gt; That doesn't make it okay simply because we see a lot of it. Or even if we see it amongst so-called believers as such, that still doesn't make it okay. It's not all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would sooner be more straight than more loose. &gt;&gt; I would sooner have the standard higher than lower. &gt;&gt; AND SO I MIGHT SAY AS I PONDERED this this morning, the prophet was speaking about the churches. He said, and they would say, "HOW DO THESE THINGS come in?" And the question is, not how did the sheep get out? How did the sheep get out? It wasn't that so much. How did the goats get in? Is because they lowered the standard and the goats began to feel very comfortable amongst the sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said because they've rejected the fountain of living water and have drunk from Hollywood broken sistns. Listen. He says then and I have this underlined. America has refused Christ as their God. &gt;&gt; And received a woman as their God. &gt;&gt; I say that is a thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have refused God, Christ as their God and received a woman as their God or women as their God. What have they done? He said they stripped their clothes. Oh, he said it's a disgrace for a decent person to walk the streets in any city. What does it show? You know how long this is? 1956. Because he says, God, America rejected &gt;&gt; their day in 1956. And he says there's no redemption for him. Years later, I heard Billy Graham ask the same question. Brother Brandham doesn't ask it. He states it. He said, ' And that shows just exactly what's in a woman's heart. Jesus said, "By their fruit, you shall know them. I'm still on the subject of the vine." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes from an individual on the street to the nature of the WHOLE NATION. I PLANTED you as a noble vine. America was planted as a godly noble vine. And I'm sure that in the heart OF GOD HE IS SAYING HOW DID IT BECOME SUCH A DEGENERATE PLANT. HOW AND WHERE DID THESE THINGS come from? I would say somewhere between Plymouth Rock and September of 205 the bars have come way down. And how the sheep got out is because the goats were let in. Influences were led in. vile influences were allowed to come in INTO THE POLITICS AND into the schools into the whole education system. And I think for my part, brother, sister, I think the further we can live from it, the better. even though we're in the midst OF IT TO SEPARATE ourselves from it. &gt;&gt; Said you become a strange plant. Now, I didn't give you the title to this message, but I did give a title to it. It might not be the best of grammar, but it's a question. Are the branches being broken off? There are some things that may and I'll be about another 10 minutes. There are some things as I said at the very beginning of the service that may be difficult to connect or you may wonder how they connect. I it's just myself now, brother Ed Bisll. I feel that it's more than a coincidence that under the powerful persuasion of America in her present state, not the brothers from the Plymouth Rock when they arrived, but where America is today, that their mentality and their mindset. And the scripture says Paul saying to the Gentiles, "Boast not thyself against the branches, the original branch, &gt;&gt; which was Israel. Don't boast thyself against the original branch, as if you do that, lest thou also be broken off." Right. &gt;&gt; And the word in and I was away. And while I was away, that be to actually speak to me. I almost became troubled over. I I need to find out exactly what Apostle Paul is saying. And the word boast in the Greek that he uses is that DON'T LIFT YOURSELF up to the injury of another. SO DON'T LIFT YOURSELF UP AGAINST ISRAEL, which is the vine, because you're JUST A BRANCH THAT'S BEEN GRAFTED IN. AND THE BLESSINGS YOU HAVE, AND THE FATNESS THEREOF IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND THE COVENANTS CAME BY THE WORD OF GOD. THE COVENANTS CAME BY ISRAEL. AND THE PROMISES CAME BY ISRAEL. AND THE FATNESS IN FACT IS IF YOU TAKE EVEN EVEN ALL OF THE uh uh many OF OUR LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COURTS COME OUT OF THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE. THEY'RE PART OF THE COVENANTS. EVEN THE THINGS THAT UH MANY OF THE UNIONS and for THE BETTERMENT OF THE SOCIAL STATUS AND THE SOCIAL NET TO CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND ALL OF THOSE MATTERS COME OUT OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND THIS THIS IS THE ROOT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ROOT AND US GENTILES HAVE ONLY BEEN GRAFTED IN AND WE'VE BEEN SAPPING. AND APOSTLE PAUL, THE FIRST MESSENGER SAYS, "DON'T BOAST YOURSELF AGAINST THE BRANCHES. DON'T LIFT YOURSELF UP TO THEIR INJURY." &gt;&gt; AND THE GENTILES, THE LAST GREAT NATION, THE PROPHET SAID, THE GREATEST NATION THAT'S EVER BEEN HAS BEEN AMERICA. HER GREATNESS COMES BECAUSE HER SHE WAS GRAFTED IN TO THIS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; AND HER FOREFATHERS CAME TO THIS LAND TO GET FREEDOM TO WORSHIP GOD ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD AND TO SHAKE OFF ALL THE BONDAGE OF ROME. LET THE PEOPLE SAY AMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND? I'VE BEEN BUILDING FOR OVER AN HOUR TO COME TO THIS POINT. BOAST NOT THYSELF AGAINST THE BRANCHES. DON'T LIFT YOURSELF UP TO THEIR INJURY. AND RIGHT AT THIS TIME, AT THIS VERY TIME HERE, A A NATION BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER, BECAUSE OF THEIR WEALTH, BECAUSE OF THEIR MILITARY STRENGTH, THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL, BECAUSE THEY'RE LISTENED TO BY ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD. AND SO THE LEADERS CAN SAY TO ISRAEL, "WE HAVE THE ROAD MAP TO YOUR PEACE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE ROAD MAP FOR PEACE." GOD HATES THAT STATEMENT. THIS IS THE ROAD MAP FOR PEACE. AND THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD MAP. THIS IS THE ROAD MAP. AND BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE THAT'S PUT UPON THAT NATION AGAINST THE ORIGINAL VINE, THE PRESSURE THAT'S PUT ON THAT ORIGINAL VINE, THEY PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON IT UNTIL THEY SUCCUMB TO IT AND THEY BEGIN TO DRAG OFF DRAG OFF THEIR OWN RESIDENCE OFF OF THEIR INHERITANCE. IT WOULD BE LIKE ME SAYING, "AH, I HAVE A GREAT SPIRITUAL HERITAGE." AND SEE YOU YOUNG FELLAS AND YOU YOUNG LADIES STARTING TO REACH OUT INTO THE SPIRITUAL THING. AND I WOULD DRAW YOU BACK AND PULL YOU FROM THAT AND PUT PRESSURE ON YOU TO NOT NOT ATTAIN THOSE SPIRITUAL THINGS. COME BACK. YOU CAN LIVE AN EASIER LIFE IN THE WORLD. THERE'S AN EASIER LIFE FOR YOU. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT SO SERIOUS. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UH EVERYTHING THAT THE PROPHETS OF GOD HAVE SAID. I'D BE DRAGGING. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE LEADERS IN ISRAEL ARE DOING. BUT THEY'RE BEING PRESSURED PRESSURED BY THE RICHEST AND THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH WHO HAD WHO WAS PLANTED A NOBLE VINE IN THE BEGINNING BUT HAS BECOME A DEGENERATE PLANT. &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT WHILE THE ACTION IS TAKING PLACE, IT MIGHT MEAN NOTHING TO NO ONE HERE, BUT IT MEANS A PROFOUND THINGS TO ME. RIGHT. WHILE THEY'RE PHYSICALLY JEW, PULLING JEW OFF OF THEIR INHERITANCE, RIGHT OFF THEIR LAND, &gt;&gt; a city of this degenerate plant, BECOMES DESECRATED BY A GREAT FORCE THAT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, BUILDS OUT OVER THE GULF, AND IT COMES WITH A GREAT FORCE AND BEGINS TO DESTROY WHAT the the the THE PLACE OF THAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST VILE &gt;&gt; IN AMERICA. &gt;&gt; I'm just starting, friends. &gt;&gt; BOAST NOT THYSELF, &gt;&gt; LEST YOU ALSO BE BROKEN OFF. AND I ASK A QUESTION. IS IT AN ACCIDENT? OR IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT WHILE ISRAEL BY THE PRESSURE OF THIS GREAT POWER IS PULLING THEIR PEOPLE OFF OF THE INHERITANCE OF THE WORD OF GOD WHICH IS DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THIS WORD? AND WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING, HERE COMES A STORM AND COMES TO A A WICKED, VILE CITY. A CITY THAT IS PREPARING TO HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A CELEBRATION OF DECADENCE &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TO HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME HURRICANE KATRINA CAME UPON THE CITY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING WHAT THEY CALL THE 34TH ANNUAL CELEBRATION OF DECADENCE AND THEY WERE EXPECTING 125,000 PLUS BECAUSE THEY HAD 125,000 LAST YEAR. AND THESE ARE HOMOSEXUAL AND UH AND LESBIAN TYPE OF PEOPLE AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO WHO CONDONES IT AND MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS IN THEIR ABSOLUTE DEBAUCHERY AND NAKEDNESS AND GOD JUST DECIDED IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. It's not going to happen AND IT WON'T HAPPEN &gt;&gt; PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME. AND I TRUST IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT STORM? I'M NOT SAYING WHAT IT WAS OR HOW IT WAS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN NOW, EVEN TODAY, AS OF THIS MORNING, THEY'RE STILL SAYING WHAT WENT WRONG. WE HAD A WHOLE AIRBORNE DIVISION OF AMERICAN PILOTS AND AIRPLANES TO CARRY PEOPLE AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR A CALL. NEVER GOT THE CALL. THE AMTRAK TRAIN WAS SITTING WAITING TO TAKE OUT EVACUEES AND NEVER GOT A CALL. NEVER HAULED ANYBODY OUT. A HOSPITAL SHIP WAITED OFF TO GET A CALL. IT WAS A 300 BED HOSPITAL SHIP NEVER GOT A CALL. While 90 miles of the Gulf Coast was decimated, they said GUSTS OF THE HURRICANE flung water into the streets in storm surges as high as 25 ft. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON this because you've been probably overdone with it already. They said it was like HOUSES WERE PLAYING BUMPER cars around here. One observer said coffins out of the out of the graveyard came floating down the beach. BOATS WERE PERCHED UP IN THE TREES. The levies then ruptured after this flooding 80% of the city. AND NOT ONLY THAT, WHEN THE STORM WENT BY, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST VILE DISTRICTS, WHICH WAS THE FRENCH DISTRICT, THEY BEGAN TO REJOICE THAT THEY HAD MISSED it when the levies broke loose and the water poured IN AND FLOODING 80% OF the entire city, leaving a 100,000 people stranded as the temperature soared. One writer said, commentator, he said, "The temperature rose and the whole city was poached in a vile stew of melted landfill, chemicals, corpses, gasoline, snakes, and canal rats." Out of the Time magazine, "The sick in hospitals without power, medication soon ran out, and evacuation was all but impossible." They said hundreds of thousands were without food and water or shelter of any kind. Families separated and moved to different states and still remain separated and children who will never see the the school they ever went to and separated from their families and uh uh different organizations now are trying to put the families together. Businesses and jobs and schools and even personal identity was gone. As one man says, I don't even have an address. I'm an I I'm I'm just a no one. I'm a nobody. I don't have an address. And of all things, I thought, how how I I read considerable about it and I I because I this was on my mind are the branches being broken off. &gt;&gt; And for my part, I say we had a prophet. He already declared it. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE IMMORALITY. HE ZEROED in to the various places where IT WAS SO INIQUITOUS. WE USED TO IMPORT IT FROM PARIS AND NOW WE EXPORT IT BACK TO PARIS. I TELL YOU WHAT, MY BROTHER, my sister, the messenger spoke in general terms, but we're seeing very vividly before OUR EYES IN DETAIL HOW THAT REALLY MEANT. PAUL SAID, THE BRANCH HAS BEEN BORE BROKEN OFF. AND I SAID, THAT IS TRUE. &gt;&gt; APOSTLE PAUL, GOD BLESS YOU. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PROPHET THAT YOU BELIEVE IN SAYS IN 1956 THEY TURNED AWAY FROM GOD. THAT MAY SOUND A LONG TIME AGO. SOME OF YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN, BUT YOU'RE LIVING TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; You think it's going to come back? Never. &gt;&gt; Never. You think a MORAL CONDITION IS GOING TO COME BACK? AND I have read volumes of of things that happened and statements of leaders and all the rest of it to SAY IF THERE'S ONE PLACE WAS THERE ONE PERSON WAS THERE ONE RECORD of anyone saying we need to repent doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist. THERE'S NO CALL FOR PRAYER. NO CALL THAT PEOPLE PERHAPS THIS IS GOD TRYING TO SPEAK TO US. NO CALL. WHY? BECAUSE THE MINDS HAVE BE ALREADY BECOME SEARED ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURE AND REPENTANCE IS AN INNER HEART. THEY SHOWED ONE woman and and it just just that was as of this morning just showed one woman laying beside the corpse of her and so they said common law husband livein husband perhaps my wife said perhaps they couldn't find a married couple I don't know that perhaps extreme but I tell you what today friends you and I better wake upmen It's not something that's coming. It's something that's already here. &gt;&gt; They said an estimated 10,000 workers who lost their jobs because of the hurricane filed for unemployment last week. In one week, 10,000 for unemployment. They've got to find the the whole economy is completely devastated. you know, will it build up? Sure, probably will. I don't know whether we'll see it or not, but I can tell you that the news reporters probably gave all kinds of details about what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; They weren't really touched. Maybe they were in the other end of the country. All they did was see the smoke rise. There may be some that all they did is said I've talked to some said all we got was it got cooler where we are. We actually were happy it got cool because of the hurricane Katrina. It was it cooled off our area. So people can have all kinds of you know what went wrong and and all kinds of analyses about what happened and and and so on and so forth. But on the big screen I'm trying to get you to come up from a different perspective today. and say because I can assure you there has never been a world power that tampered with Israel that remained a world power. You and I are seeing a demise &gt;&gt; of the strongest and richest of nations on earth. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SEEING IT IN ITS DEATH THROWS. &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT SAYING THE ECONOMY COLLAPSE IT. IT MAY GO WILDER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE, BUT IT'S IT'S STILL A IT'S A FACADE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE DEBT AS OF THIS MORNING, THE NATIONAL DEBT IS 7 TRILLION 782 billion816 MILLION546,362 and it amounted to $26,000. Every American person is indeent. Every baby, child, and person is indebted 26,000 more than we thought we were. That's as of this morning. The nations of the world don't have a lot of confidence. And you might not realize that one nation can just take a little step. And it was President de Gaul of France in the 1960s. He decided that he wanted to call he wanted to America to recall all of their paper. They said, "Give us gold. All these hundreds of millions of dollars we're holding IN AMERICAN PAPER. WE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT ANYMORE. TAKE IT BACK and give us gold." Gold was at $35 an ounce and just in a short time it was up over $700 an ounce. And the gold has never been the same since. &gt;&gt; It shook the whole economy for the time. And of course they said within the senators within America said, "Why don't we call on them to pay their war debt, which is about the same amount as our paper that's in their country." For myself, I would said that's what they should have done. They should have made them pay their war debt that they owe America. But America's generous. America isn't only prosperous, they're generous &gt;&gt; and they've befriended, they've purchased friends by protecting them. &gt;&gt; But also, friends, they have received the greatest voice &gt;&gt; that has ever sounded. &gt;&gt; As far AS I'M CONCERNED, OUTSIDE OF JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN NO VOICE THAT HAS HAD SUCH AN EFFECT. AND IT'S AN INCREASING EFFECT. &gt;&gt; IT'S IN A VOICE OF TRUTH. &gt;&gt; So just days, just days. And right while you must say it right while their foreign representatives is this all right &gt;&gt; and condies of rice foreign ministers and you must understand don't ever forget that when anyone begins to tamper with Israel They're playing right into the hand of God. &gt;&gt; And I believe that America's been blessed to this point because they've been a friend of America. I mean, they've been a friend of Israel. &gt;&gt; And Israel, their forefather, is Abraham, who is a friend of God. &gt;&gt; You heard me speak. They're a friend of the friend of God. And that's why God has blessed them. There's never been a nation that's ever risen to where they've risen to. But are the branches being broken off? And so, right, while they are in not only in full agreement, I've used up my time now. Not only in full agreement, but they have also, listen, just give me a couple more minutes. And the 1967 war, which you know and I know in Israel is nothing short of a supernatural war, was fought in five or six days. And it's the only war in history that was paid for before it was finished. &gt;&gt; They had actually paid for it. The Jews came from all over the world and gave gave their funds and had the war paid for before it was done. And it was done. It took everybody by surprise. And then the the Sinai desert became the buffer between Egypt and Israel. God through that little nation fought against tens of millions. &gt;&gt; The odds ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. I'VE GOT THE PICTURES. I HAPPEN TO have the pictures where Egypt had prepared for this war and they had dummy bomber planes on the ground and they'd have a dummy plane and a real one and maybe two dummies and a real one and then a and then another dummy and a real one and um and the Israeli Air Force flew in AND SO SUDDENLY THAT MORNING AND I'VE GOT THE PICTURES OF THE AIR STRIPS AND THEY BOMBED AND WHEN THEY BOMBED THEY HIT the real ones and left the dummies. I TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, OUR GOD IS GOD. &gt;&gt; I read a reporter, a woman reporter that was in a was IN A JEEP IN A CONVOY THAT WAS THAT WAS SHOOTING DOWN THROUGH THE SINAI DESERT AND SHE SAID THAT THAT SUDDENLY the the the jeep that was in THE LEAD JUST SWERVED and went off into the off the road because there's no ditches or anything. It just desert swerved and went off the ROAD AND ALL THE OTHERS FOLLOWED. AND THE last jeep was quite a ways behind and went straight through and was blew up because there was a there was some landmines that were there and a man or two whatever was in the last jeep was was killed. But the but the the convoy itself was preserved and got on and they she got to the leader and said, "Why did you swerve and go off?" HE SAID, "I SAW A BIG BALL OF FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF the road and I turned off." HALLELUJAH. IT'S THE SAME GOD. I could tell you on and on and on. I knew two WOMEN THAT HAD GONE there in the 1940s and 50s as missionaries. And in one of the wars in 1956, I believe it was. And one of my friends was living in Israel. HE SAID, "WE ONLY HAD BROOMSTICKS TO PROTECT OURSELVES." AND EVERY MAN MADE HIS MADE HIS HOLE MADE his uh foxhole in HIS OWN PROPERTY ON HIS OWN LOT AND SAYS WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO GO. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LOSING A WAR. WE DON'T HAVE A LAND. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDENTITY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO GO. WE MUST PROTECT THIS. And they stood THERE AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS. and in the ingenuity of their mind because God gave them that kind of ingenuity. They took drums, EMPTY 45GALLON DRUMS AND PUT ALL KINDS OF STONES AND ROCKS IN THEM AND THEY HAD THEM UP ON TOP OF THIS HILL AND AND WHEN THE SYRIANS BEGAN TO COME AND INVADE, they they took AND THEY IN THE NIGHTTIME THEY STARTED THESE DRUMS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE. AND AS THOSE THINGS JUST RUMBLED DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN SIDE, ALL THOSE ROCKS MAKING ALL THAT NOISE AND THE SYRIANS FLED BECAUSE THEY SAID THE AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN THEM TANKS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I I TELL YOU WHAT, I REJOICE OVER THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And God knows how to bring things on. He knows how to do things. And when you begin to tamper with them, and this is from Philadelphia just days before, it wasn't celebration of decadence. They called it southern decadence. An annual homosexual celebration attracting tens of thousands of people to the French Quarters section of New Orleans. An act of God destroys the city. Southern Decadence has a history of filling the French Quarter section of the city with drunken homosexuals engaging in sex acts in public streets and bars. And last year, just last year, they had 125,000. Listen now. A local pastor in New Orleans sent a video footage of sex acts being performed in front of POLICEMEN AND HE SENT IT TO THE MAYOR of the city AND THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE MEDIA. And the city officials simply ignored the footage and continued to welcome and praise the week-long celebration as being an exciting event. However, Hurricane Katrina has put an end to the annual celebration of Sam, the past three mayors of New Orleans, including City Bartholomew, Mark H. Mor Moral, and C. Ray Negan, who's been very much in the papers these days, they issued and I read Mayor Negan's letter. I read his letter of of inviting this celebration to this city and they issued official proclamations welcoming visitors to southern decadence. Additionally, New Orleans City Council made other proclamations recognizing the annual homosexual celebration. And while the mayors accepted it and invited it, God saw fit. And it wasn't just a storm, friends. It's not just that. Listen, not that they will come and go. I'm saying this is a sign to us because I've laid out in detail very much scripture and very many quotes from the prophet of God so that you would sit here this morning and KNOW THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE. THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENT AND THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER STORM. GOD IS SAYING YOU'RE TAMPERING WITH THE VINE AND I'M GOING TO BREAK YOU OFF. Brother Brandham had a vision. And listen close now as I close is after he lost his wife and his baby. This was quite early and he didn't know whether it was real or whether he was in a dream or whether he was in a vision or he didn't know if he was actually there. body. He sees a a covered wagon, a western covered wagon. He said it always wanted to be out west. Sees this covered wagon and the wheel is broken and it can't go where it was supposed to go or where it was determined to go. And he said, "That covered wagon is my family." He knew it was his family because his family was broken by the death of his wife and his baby. But while he was there, he said, and here came a lovely young lady. She says, "Hi, Dad." He said, "Excuse me, how can you call me dad?" She says, "Don't you know me? I'm Sharon Rose." and and mother's waiting for you and you have a mansion. That's not possible. He says, "We're Brams. We're poor people. I don't have any mansion." And she begins to talk to him and he begins to talk to her and finally meets his wife and she says to him, "I don't want to go all into it." She said, "Don't worry. I don't want you to worry anymore." And he begins to break up. He's in life story and he begins to break up and the whole thing is such a reality that he can't even continue his sermon. He breaks up and he he le he leaves the pulpit weeping so hard he can't go on because it was such a reality. You might think how this connects. I'll tell you how it connects. That is a family unit. I talked about individuals. I talked about a nation. Talked about Israel. talked about America and now I come to the only prophet that I know of, a messenger that America produced. He came out of the soil of that nation. And God also allowed that his life, his home become a broken wagon. The wheel broke and he couldn't go any place. But I'm going to tell you something. It was settled in his heart by I'd say divine inspiration that he would not change his course. He would continue on. That's what I'm saying to you young people. You must not change your course. I don't care what happens tomorrow. I don't care what happens with your job. I don't care what happens in your family. There's not sufficient reason to change your course. &gt;&gt; You may be here and your home may be broken up and the wagon wheel is broken, but don't miss the spot that he got to. He got on the other side. And I tell you, it is real. It's more real than you sitting here this morning. It's just a it's just a breath away. And with all of these things and all of these events and all this, you're going to you're going to face more. Don't change your course. &gt;&gt; The life that was in that prophet messenger, if brother Brandon was here, it'd be a very ordinary person. He'd just like to go with you and have lunch with you today. &gt;&gt; But the life that was in him, THE LIFE THAT was in that branch would not change. &gt;&gt; He continued to believe the same word. He always believed and CONTINUED TO PREACH IT. AND IT ONLY GOT RICHER and deeper and more glorious. And now HERE WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT FAITHFULNESS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And you don't know who you're going to affect. You're going to affect somebody. I said to the young people the other day, Friday night, just a few comments before Brother John started and I said, "Brother Brandon said, there'll be a sweep." And I believe we're seeing it. I believe with all my heart and soul and I want every parent and every person that's an adult within this church. I want you to be just as as not only enthused but supportive and behind it and do whatever I can do in your prayer and in in every way that you possibly can. We we intend to build upon these things the kind of sweep that I talked about. I said here's the sweep that I'm seeing. I didn't know that brother Jess and Sister Lynn Barios would be there. But I said, I I remember Sister Lynn Barios. She yearned to be up here in Washington, be able to come to this church. I didn't even know her. And they moved up. She finally persuaded brother Jess. He wasn't, you know, he's a bread earner. He has to have a job. And he didn't want to just pull up stakes. But they were in California. And they also wanted to leave California. and and and because of Sister Lynn Barios, Brother Lynn, Brother Jess came and they they hear, "Brother Jess gets a job in a plant and he's working next to Brother Joe Graham and he witnesses to him." Brother Joe Graham and I sit down in Denny's restaurant and brother Jess said, "I couldn't take him any further. Has he called you yet?" I said, "No." But we finally made contact and brother Joe Graeme and I are talking and brother Joe looks over my head looks out the window. He says sister Bobby was managerous of two high fashion ladies wares and had promise to go higher and further and and and in that in that position of course she dressed very fashionable and all the rest of not that she doesn't today but it was the world and he looked over my head. He said, "This will probably cost my home. This will probably cost me my wife, but I'm prepared for that, too." And he was going to be baptized and went from Brother Joe to Sister Bobby. And soon she was in the tank. And then come a funeral to take place and brother Chris Peterson, he comes up. He's cousin to brother Joe and he has to get him out of this false cult. and he gets to reading a church age book and a few other books and before long he was in the tank and I knew that he he figured that probably sister cigarette would never make it. vice president of a big corporation, all the rest of it, down in San Francisco. And how is she going to, you know, what are we going to do here at this little place up here in the Boondocks of Washington and Northwest and how in the world is that going to happen soon? She was in the tank. THAT'S THE KIND OF SWEEP I'M TALKING ABOUT. [applause] few young people. Joanne isn't here today, but she was at high school and she brought a girl over from high school cuz we're just across the street. She brings a girl over from high school and sits at our table as Sister Karen Ashdown. She's sitting there in a pair, you won't mind me, Sister Karen sitting there in a pair of blue jeans. All I saw was a girl that had a heart for God. And I began to speak to her and told her about the serpent seed. Here's sister Cindy Bergen right here. And from Citra Karen, from Joanne to Sister Karen and Sister Jerry Goce, Sister Cindy Bergen was a girl about eight or nine years old and her mom and daddy are good friends of ours. And I flew from Toronto. I was waiting to go with brother Brandham and actually to work with his tape ministry which he asked me to do and I was in Toronto just waiting for that to happen and I flew from Toronto to Dawson Creek to dedicate the church and went out from there to Grandpa Haney's place man that we called grandpa he was an elder in the church and her mom and dad Cindy's mom and dad sitting around the table and her uncle and her aunt and grandpa Haney and his wife and myself were all sitting around the table and I'm pouring out my heart and soul these people I love like my own family and I'm just speaking to them about and I and I got into the serpent seed to me it's a foundation doctrine I began to speak about the serpent seed I didn't see any fruits from it years went by finished in Toronto came back out here was out here and here starts a little group and we're in a little house and Linda and Cindy about the same age says, "I want to fly up and see Cindy." Cindy is a lab technician and a medical lab technician. A young lady now. All these years have gone by. 10 years have gone by. I'm talking about a sweep of the Holy Spirit. And then Cindy came down and visited us. I don't know how it happened. We were sitting in the front room. I'm sitting right across just like you fellas are from me. Now, here's this young young lovely girl just launched out into the workforce and Linda and the kids are gone and my wife's in the kitchen and I begin to speak to Cindy and I speak to her and I come to the serpent's seed. I don't know what else to say. Just she had to know this message is different. This message is the truth of God's word. And I just began to lay it out from the scripture. And she says to me, "Do you remember when you spoke to mom and dad about this at Grandpa Haney's farm?" I said, "Yes, I certainly do. I remember sitting around the dining room table." She said, "Did you see me standing there?" I said, "No." I said, "I all I heard all you kids outside playing. I didn't see you. I didn't know any of the were inside. She says, I was standing at the table listening to you and I've wanted to hear this ever since. And since today, Brother Rod's wife and their family and children here, that's the kind of sweep. And I'm telling you young people, that's the kind of influence that's what God has done in your hearts and in your lives. And you may come your life may experience some things that you it might might be like a broken wheel in your home or your family or your life or whatever more. Don't under any condition let that change your course. &gt;&gt; You stay the course. Apostle Paul stayed the course. Brother Brown stayed the course. I've done my best to stay the course. And my life was not easy. I wouldn't wish it upon any of you. But even though if God never showed my my home and my life is being a broken wagon, but it didn't go. I just counted yesterday or the day before yesterday. I lost 50 years of mother and dad. 50 years of life of being able to be with them cuz mom went so young. I lost 50 years. My mother never able to see my children, never able to see her grandchildren, never able. But there's a landlord. &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I need you to help me. Second, there's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. We've got sick people. I might as well be honest. There's people that's close to death from our congregation. And before next Sunday, they might be gone. Before Brother Donaldson preaches, they might be gone. But whoever you are that's connected to them, do not change the course. Nothing can change. And what am I talking about? I'm talking about that life that's in the vine. Just keep giving yourself, surrender yourself to that blessed, blessed divine nature of God and never want to change it. Are you with me? I'm so glad that nothing changed. I was so glad after I got to be with brother Brandham that all that power and all that people and popularity and everything never changed and he just remembered remained a humble servant of Christ. And it's had a profound effect upon my life. And I the little testimonies I gave you, there's just all kinds of them here in this whole congregation. just all kinds of them. And I say to you in the name of Jesus Christ, stay the course. Stay the course. Don't let anything change you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Rod. Do we have the words to that? Sorry, I went half an hour over. [music] There's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. And we only reach that shore by faith's decree. [music] One by one will gain the portals there to dwell with thee immortals when they ring the golden bells for you and me. Sing it sweetly. Don't you hear the bells [singing] now ringing? Don't you hear the angels singing to the glory hallelu Jubilee [singing] in that far sweet forever just beyond the shining river when they ring the golden bells for you and me. [music] We shall know no sin nor sorrow in that haven of tomorrow when our part shall sail beyond the silver sea. [music] We shall only know the blessing of our father's sweet caressing when they ring the golden bells for you and me. [music] &gt;&gt; Don't you hear the bells now ringing? Don't you hear the [singing] angels singing? [music] is the glory. Hallelujah. Jupy [music and singing] in that far off sweet forever. [music] Just beyond the shining river when they ring the golden [music] bells for you and me. [music] When our days shall know their number. When death we [music] sweetly slumber, when the king commands the spirit to be [music] free, never more with anguish lab. When shall we [music] ring the golden bells for you and me? [music] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Don't you hear the bell now ringing? Don't you hear the angels singing? [music] Give the glory hallelujah to believe [singing] [music] in that far sweet forever just beyond the shining river. and ring those [singing] bells for you and me. The chorus once again, please. [music] Oh, don't you hear the bells now ringing? Don't you hear the angels [music] sing to the glory [singing] hallelujah to the [music] glory in that star of sweet forever just beyond the shining river when they bring the gold for you and me. [music] I wonder how many here want to be included in the prayer and say, "Brother Ed, I want to be I want to stay the course. I want to remain steadfast. I want to be an influence." &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, as we've lingered on a time this morning, but sensing your sweet presence and your spirit, and I know, oh God, that you're laying down and building, Father, I'm just seeking to edify the people and all who are within the sound of my voice today. that the Holy Spirit, oh God, will be the speaker and that you will convey, oh God, deeper than the ears, as our brother Lance prayed in the study this morning, that it would go deeper, oh God, than just the hearing of the ears, but down into the regions of the soul and the inner man. May the Holy Spirit find an entrance and come and possess with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I pray, oh God, a great sealing work amongst your people. These children that you love, they are your children. I pray, Father, that you'll make them an unmovable force. Make they be the life of May the life of the of the vine dwell in these branches. I pray, oh God, that they will unairringly move forward. And until that day, for surely we will gather at another time, in another meeting place, and there forever, forever and ever to be in your presence. Oh God, I'm so thankful, Lord, that you came down while we could not lift ourselves up. You've come down and have received us up into yourself. And today, we've sat in heavenly places. I'm asking a great marvelous time this evening. Bless us with the word, Lord. I'm so desirous to hear what you have to tell us through your servant. Oh God, as brother Lance comes to the pulpit, Lord, and the and the time to gather the Lord's table and the foot washing, may it be a blessed royal time for the royal seed. And if anyone here, Lord, to this morning is despondent or discouraged, I stand against any spirit that would be contrary to the Holy Spirit. FOR YOU HAVE EMPOWERED US TO DO SO, and we resist every enemy that would try to rob the people of the grace and the preciousness of this moment. Now, Lord, I pray that you'll go with us as we depart this place shortly. Go with each one. May this afternoon be just a glorious and wonderful sacred time. [music] In Jesus Christ's name, I bless these people and for your glory. Amen. Amen. We'll sing as before we go. The ship is battered. The sail though the sails are torn. The anchor holes. [music] The anchor holes. How many believe the anchor holes? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, the sh. [music] Oh, [singing] [music] the anor. [music] [singing] [music] I am all [singing] my [music] gra. [music] [singing] Oh hallelujah. It's like a storm. But once again, you made our voices. [music] We have no [singing] [music] [music] sail. [music and singing] I have [music] all my knees and my face the [music] raing sever [music] inside of the stor. [music] Why don't you turn around and shake hands with someone else who's got a an anchor that is holding? That'll make two. [music] God bless you. Thanks, brother. I appreciate. Thank you, [music] brother. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]
