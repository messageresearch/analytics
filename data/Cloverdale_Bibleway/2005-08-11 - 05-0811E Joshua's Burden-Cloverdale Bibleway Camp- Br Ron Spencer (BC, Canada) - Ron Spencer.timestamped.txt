[2:42] Hallelujah.
[2:43] I am blessed.
[2:47] Amen. Are you blessed people tonight?
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You enjoying camp, young people.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; I can legitly say young people because
[2:54] I'm over 30. Well, I am 30. So, it's
[2:58] good to see everybody in the house of
[3:00] God tonight. I just uh thinking back,
[3:03] it's been 20 years. I guess I just asked
[3:05] Brother Tom, 20 years when camp first
[3:07] started. That takes me back when I was
[3:08] 10 years old. That's when brother Tony
[3:10] lost his hair and brother Tom turned
[3:12] white.
[3:16] For sure. For sure. Well, it's good to
[3:18] see everybody out this evening. Why
[3:20] don't we all stand?
[3:22] God bless you, brother Tom.
[3:28] Let's sing. I'm going to let the glory
[3:29] roll when the roll is called in glory.
[3:31] And brother John, if I can get more
[3:32] sister Linda through my monitor, that'd
[3:33] be good.
[3:35] I'm going to let the glory roll when the
[3:38] roll is called in glory.
[3:42] I'm going to get beside of myself when I
[3:44] get to Simon King. That day I'm going to
[3:49] have a time of my life. When the time of
[3:51] my life is over,
[3:54] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[3:57] get carried away, let's sing it again.
[4:00] Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll.
[4:02] When the roll is falling glory,
[4:06] oh, I'm going to get the side of myself.
[4:09] When I get inside the king, that day I'm
[4:13] going to have a time of my life. When
[4:15] the time of my life is over,
[4:19] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[4:22] get carried away, let's sing the first
[4:24] verse. Well, I don't know why, but I
[4:27] can't be shy when I get around all God's
[4:30] people. Well, I get so sad that I'm just
[4:34] on fire and lose all control. Well, the
[4:38] word of God is consuming my feet in my
[4:43] bosom. And one of these days, I'm going
[4:46] to shout and sing in the presence of my
[4:49] king.
[4:51] Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll.
[4:54] Roll his call in glory.
[4:57] I'm going to get beside of myself. When
[5:00] I get beside the king that day, I'm
[5:04] going to have a time of my life. Time of
[5:06] my life is over.
[5:10] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[5:13] get carried away,
[5:16] well, I wondered around with a great big
[5:19] crown. Found my condemnation.
[5:23] Then the pill of fire came across my
[5:25] path and show me my salvation.
[5:29] Where there's God, there's peace and joy
[5:32] and happiness and gladness.
[5:35] And I thank Jesus. Every day
[5:39] weigh my sadness.
[5:42] I'm going to let glory roll. Roll is
[5:45] rolling glory.
[5:48] Oh, I'm going to get inside of myself.
[5:51] When I get beside
[5:53] that day, I'm going to have time. My
[5:56] life, the time of my life is over.
[6:01] I'm going to get carried away.
[6:04] Carried away.
[6:07] Now the song I sung is for nothing I've
[6:10] done. But God has showed me mercy. And I
[6:14] tell this story for the good Lord's
[6:17] glory
[6:18] by his name.
[6:21] Now you first let's stay with the word
[6:23] and praise revelation
[6:27] and through the power of the word of the
[6:29] hour Lord tempation.
[6:33] I'm going to let glory roll. Roll this
[6:37] fall in glory.
[6:39] Oh, I'm going inside of myself inside
[6:43] the king. That day I'm going to have a
[6:47] time of my life. Time my life is over.
[6:52] Oh, I'm going to get carried away. When
[6:55] I get caring that last verse again,
[6:58] well,
[7:00] my song is nothing I've done. But it's
[7:02] God has showed me mercy and I fill the
[7:06] store for the good Lord's glory. Magnify
[7:10] his name. Lord you first stand at the
[7:14] word for revelation
[7:18] and through the power of the word of the
[7:20] hour Lord tempation.
[7:24] Well I'm going to let the glory roll all
[7:27] his holy glory.
[7:30] I'm going inside of myself. Get inside
[7:34] the king. That day I'm going my life. My
[7:40] life is over.
[7:43] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[7:46] get carried away.
[7:51] Amen. Why don't we worship? Worship him.
[7:53] Let's lift our hands. Let's open camp
[7:56] and just give him a praise offering.
[7:58] Hallelujah, Lord. Oh God, Father, we
[8:01] just worship you this evening. Oh God,
[8:04] knowing Lord that you're coming down,
[8:06] you're meeting us this evening, oh God.
[8:08] Lord, we know that you have changed
[8:10] lives. Lord, you're doing great things
[8:13] amongst us, oh God. You are worthy, oh
[8:15] God. You're worthy of our praise and our
[8:18] thanksgiving, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[8:21] Hallelujah. Lord, we're expecting great
[8:23] things tonight, Lord. Hallelujah.
[8:26] Hallelujah. We worship you, oh God. We

[8:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[8:35] Praise the Lord. If you've come
[8:36] expecting, you're going to have what
[8:37] you've asked for.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing number 203?
[8:44] If I have a little more of me through
[8:45] the monitor, it feels like I'm screaming
[8:47] up here. No, I can't do it. I'll scream.
[8:49] All right. We'll sing There's Going to
[8:51] Be a Meeting in the Air. Let's start
[8:52] with the chorus.
[8:57] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[9:02] the air in that sweet, sweet by and by.
[9:08] Well, I am going to meet you. I'll meet
[9:12] you over there in that home beyond the
[9:17] sky.
[9:19] Such singing you will hear. never hurt
[9:23] by mortal. It will be glorious. I do
[9:28] declare
[9:30] and God's own son will be one at that
[9:36] meeting in the air. First verse. Well,
[9:41] you have heard of little Moses in the
[9:44] bull run. And you have heard of Phillis
[9:48] David and his sling.
[9:52] You have heard the story told of dreamy
[9:55] Joseph
[9:57] and of Jonah and the well you often say.
[10:02] For there are many many others in the
[10:06] Bible.
[10:08] I should like to meet them all. I do
[10:11] declare
[10:14] by and by the Lord will surely let us be
[10:18] there. Oh, and that meeting in the air

[10:39] you over there in that home beyond the
[10:45] sky.

[10:51] mortality. It will be glorious, I do
[10:55] declare.
[10:58] And God's own son will be the leading
[11:03] one at that meeting
[11:06] in the air.
[11:09] Many things will there be missing at
[11:12] that meeting.
[11:14] For the mortar's bench will have no
[11:17] place at all.
[11:20] There will never be a sermon preached to
[11:23] sinners
[11:25] for the sinner had refused to hear the
[11:29] call.
[11:31] There will be no morning or wwarded
[11:34] loved ones. And there will be no lonely
[11:38] nights of pleading prayer.
[11:42] For all our burdens and our anguish will
[11:45] be lifted.
[11:47] Oh, at that meeting
[11:50] in the air. Well, there is going to be a
[11:56] coming in the air in that sweet sweet by
[12:01] and by
[12:06] to meet you. I'll meet you over there in
[12:10] that home beyond the sky.
[12:15] of singing you will hear never heard by
[12:19] mortal. It will be glorious, I too
[12:23] declare.
[12:26] And God's own son will be the leading
[12:30] one at that meeting
[12:34] in the air.
[12:37] There the doubters will be missing all
[12:40] together.
[12:42] All the skeptics will be absent on that
[12:46] day.
[12:48] There will be no grumblers present to
[12:51] disturb us.
[12:53] And the angels will be busy far away.
[12:59] Every sense will have his seal upon his
[13:02] forehead.
[13:04] Dressed in rain and not ransom ones can
[13:08] wear.
[13:10] All who have the wedding garments will
[13:13] be present.
[13:15] Oh, at that meeting
[13:18] in the air. Well, there is going to be a
[13:24] meeting in the end in that sweet, sweet
[13:29] by and by.

[13:36] over there,
[13:39] beyond the sky.

[13:47] by mortal. It will be glorious, I do
[13:52] declare.
[13:54] And God's own son will be the leading
[13:59] one at that meeting
[14:02] in the air.
[14:07] Amen.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Sam
[14:12] Adamore, brother Sam, if you come open
[14:13] the service in a word of prayer. I've
[14:15] got just a little email that came from
[14:18] South Africa from brother Harold
[14:20] Beckett. says here, "Sister Ernestine as
[14:23] well, and thanks you all for your
[14:25] prayers. Although she didn't feel up to
[14:28] par when she was discharged from the
[14:29] hospital, she was trusting in the Lord."
[14:31] And then uh one early morning
[14:35] uh sorry, she says uh one one night at
[14:37] about 300 p.m. she woke and uh and she
[14:41] woke up and knew for certain that she
[14:43] was completely healed from the past
[14:45] elements and the stomach problems. She
[14:47] just says here, "Praise to his wonderful
[14:49] name. Not only does he declare himself
[14:52] to be her all, but testifies that he is
[14:54] her healer and only and only healer of
[14:57] her body. And she says, "Thanks again
[14:58] for your prayers." And that's from our
[15:00] brother Harold Beckett. So we want to
[15:01] thank the Lord for that.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Becket's wife. Okay. Thanks,
[15:06] brother Red. Amen. So we want to
[15:09] continue to hold her up in prayer.
[15:11] Father Sam, why don't you come just open
[15:13] the service in a word of prayer.
[15:19] God's not dead.
[15:21] Let's bow our heads in faith and go to a
[15:24] prayer.
[15:25] Dear heavenly father, we come before you
[15:28] today, Lord. We just want to thank you

[15:39] meeting, Lord, through the skits that
[15:42] you've granted strength for
[15:45] the people to perform. Lord, it wasn't
[15:47] just for entertainment, Lord. It touched
[15:49] my heart, Lord. We are just giving all
[15:53] my all back to you, Lord Jesus.

[15:58] pray. Come and touch our souls once
[16:01] more. We pray, Lord God. Please him,
[16:04] Father. We need you, Lord. So, we just

[17:29] let's uh let's sing I'm bound. I'm bound

[17:34] screen.
[17:39] I'm bound. I'm bound for higher ground.
[17:44] Ain't no devil's going to pull me down.
[17:48] I'm glad you say I'm on my way. I'm
[17:53] bound for higher ground. Yes, I'm bound.
[17:58] I'm bound. Higher ground. Ain't no
[18:02] devil's going to pull me down. Well, I'm
[18:06] glad to say I'm on my way. I'm bound for
[18:11] higher ground. Yes, I'm bound. I'm
[18:15] bound. Higher ground.
[18:19] Ain't no devil's going to pull me down.
[18:23] Glad to say I am on my way. I'm bound
[18:28] for higher ground.
[18:42] Good evening.
[18:44] This song comes from a little story that
[18:46] Brother Brandham told. I'm sure most of
[18:49] you all recognize it. I pray it's a
[18:52] blessing to y'all.
[19:17] A cattle ranch in the old southwest of
[19:20] the name are more and swift. More cattle
[19:23] than the sage brush on the plane.
[19:28] The foreman had four daughters, fine as
[19:31] a china tea set, and one little orphan
[19:35] cousin who was plain.
[19:47] Telegram from Chicago hit the place like
[19:50] a tornado. The owner's son was coming on
[19:54] a train.
[19:57] girls.
[20:05] The girls put on their war paint for a
[20:08] weekend dance to celebrate. Maybe catch
[20:11] the eye of the fortune's air.
[20:15] He said, "Is there a bride
[20:18] somewhere for me?" The girls in Chicago,
[20:23] they're vain and unruly.
[20:26] I've got a mansion, an inheritance to
[20:29] share.
[20:31] But who can I trust to just love me?
[20:56] The orphan girl in a tattered dress
[20:59] cooked and served and cleaned the mess
[21:01] while the party carried on for several
[21:03] days.
[21:07] Out back with the dish pan, suddenly she
[21:10] saw a man, the armor boy, with his hat
[21:13] held in his hands.
[21:16] His
[21:19] eyes were deep and honest, and she was
[21:22] so embarrassed, but his kind and gentle
[21:25] voice said, "Evening, ma'am."
[21:29] He said, "What you heard is true. I come
[21:32] out here to find a wife.
[21:37] And everything I want, I see in you."
[21:41] He said, "You are the one
[21:44] perfect for me." The girls on the ranch,
[21:49] they're vain and unruly.
[21:52] I've got a mansion, an inheritance to
[21:55] share.
[21:57] Please, won't you marry
[22:01] me?
[22:17] For many days she scrimped and saved,
[22:19] bought a dress and packed her things.
[22:22] The time of his return was drawing nigh.
[22:27] The foreman's girls they teased her,
[22:29] mocked her and abused her. Said he was
[22:32] only sporting you, you silly child.
[22:39] Then they heard the wheels are rolling,
[22:42] the horses hooves are beating, the
[22:44] grinding of the sand under the bug
[22:47] board.
[22:49] She ran out through the trellis and up
[22:52] into his carriage. A new life in
[22:55] Chicago, her reward.
[22:59] He said you were the one
[23:02] waiting for me. The girls of this age
[23:06] are vain and unruly.
[23:09] I've got a mansion, an inheritance to
[23:13] share. I'm glad that you prepared
[23:16] yourself to leave.
[23:24] And he said, "Is there a bride
[23:27] waiting for me? The church of this age
[23:32] is vain and unruly.
[23:35] I've got a mansion, an inheritance to
[23:38] share,
[23:40] but will she have prepared herself to
[23:43] leave?
[23:45] Oh, will she have prepared
[23:49] herself
[23:51] to leave?
[24:20] And thank you, brothers.
[24:23] Why don't we sing a little chorus? We
[24:25] place you in the highest place
[24:29] for you are great high priest.
[24:34] We place you
[24:38] in the highest place
[24:43] for you
[24:47] are the great high priest.
[24:52] replace you.
[24:56] I above
[24:59] all
[25:00] else,
[25:04] all else.
[25:07] And we come to you
[25:12] to worship
[25:14] at your feet.
[25:22] Oh, we place you
[25:26] in the highest place.
[25:31] For you
[25:34] are the great high priest.
[25:39] We place you
[25:43] high above
[25:45] all
[25:47] else. else
[25:51] all
[25:54] and we come to you Lord to worship
[26:01] at your feet. Let's sing it one more
[26:05] time.
[26:09] We place you
[26:13] in the highest place.
[26:17] For you
[26:20] are the great high priest.
[26:25] We place you
[26:29] high above
[26:32] all
[26:33] else.
[26:37] all else.
[26:40] And we come to you
[26:44] to worship
[26:47] at your feet.
[26:54] Indeed, we are here to worship him. We
[26:57] are welcoming you all in the name of the
[27:00] Lord Jesus Christ to this 205 camp
[27:04] meeting. The Lord loves it. The Lord is
[27:07] very much uh uh he's very very much
[27:11] attracted to I believe this campground,
[27:14] this place at this time. And I can tell
[27:17] you that uh Satan and the powers of
[27:20] darkness are very opposed to it. They
[27:23] they are uh all the powers of hell,
[27:26] demons that are as real or more real
[27:28] than we are, they're very opposed to
[27:31] what's happening here. But but the power
[27:33] of God, the scripture tells us, greater
[27:37] greater is he that is in you
[27:41] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. And we
[27:44] don't only say that as a saying or as a
[27:47] scripture quoted, but we believe that
[27:50] with all that is in us, there is nothing
[27:52] that will succeed against the truth or
[27:55] prevail against it. We have our
[27:57] obstacles. We've had them already. had
[28:00] people here uh in in official position.
[28:03] They cannot even uh stand to be here.
[28:06] They have actually vacated the property
[28:09] and gone because they they they see
[28:12] something in the people that just is too
[28:15] overpowering and it is oppressive to
[28:18] them but delivering to us and we say
[28:21] praise be to God.
[28:24] That's the truth friends. That's
[28:26] absolutely the truth. started right the
[28:28] very first day and you many of you don't
[28:31] know anything about these things. What
[28:33] you see here is the tip of the iceberg.
[28:36] But just beyond that is hosts of angels
[28:40] around encamped. We're camp but they're
[28:42] encamped around us and they're here the
[28:45] prophet said to energize your faith.
[28:49] Every one of you young people and every
[28:51] person who's come on the campgrounds,
[28:53] the angels of God are here to energize
[28:56] your faith and lift you up higher in
[28:59] your faith. How many want that?
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Well, I every hand ought been up at that
[29:06] time. I tell you what, I want my faith
[29:08] energized.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Already I stood at this
[29:12] altar myself, dedicating myself, saying,
[29:15] "God, we may not even know the way." If
[29:17] you'd have seen the presentation last
[29:19] night and seen the rich young ruler in
[29:22] hell, he lifted up his eyes and cried
[29:26] out, "Father Abraham, let Lazarus come
[29:30] and dip his finger in water and cool my
[29:33] tongue." Uh, for I am tormented. And uh
[29:37] we have people that try to lessen the
[29:39] effect of that and say, "Well, that's
[29:40] just a story. That's just a parable."
[29:43] Jesus said, "There was a certain rich
[29:46] man." There was a certain man he told a
[29:49] story about and the prophet came and
[29:51] took him all through the scripture three
[29:54] times. He he he stepped through his life
[29:56] three times. And the last time he was
[29:58] tearing down his barns, I've been so
[29:59] blessed. We saw it last night. It was so
[30:02] vivid. and uh and Lazarus uh sitting
[30:06] beside Abraham. I can tell you some say,
[30:09] "Well, it is so vivid. It is a it is uh
[30:13] it it makes it so uh so real. It it can
[30:16] it it can almost have a a negative
[30:18] effect." I can tell you what it's not
[30:21] it's not it can never be portrayed as
[30:23] real as it actually is.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Actually is. And I can tell you one
[30:28] thing in hell when he lifted up his
[30:30] eyes, there's no turning around then.
[30:32] There's no altar to come to. And as
[30:34] brother Tom has been saying, and I was
[30:36] so impacted by it as well, taking the
[30:38] words of brother Brandham said, he cried
[30:40] out, not this rich young ruler, but he
[30:42] said in hell, he said he called out for
[30:44] mama and there was no mama there. He
[30:46] cried out for his dad and there was no
[30:49] father there. He cried out and there's
[30:51] nothing there. You're alone.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THIS IS THE DAY OF
[30:55] SALVATION.
[30:57] This is the time that God has given you
[31:00] and you'll never live it again. You'll
[31:02] never come by this way again.
[31:04] Our brother Ron Peterson has come and
[31:07] even Satan is trying to attack him.
[31:09] Young people, he was here and spoke to
[31:10] you this morning. And Satan is trying to
[31:13] attack him and give him pain in his
[31:15] arms. And you know, he's just he told
[31:17] you this morning he just spent seven
[31:18] days in the hospital with a type of a
[31:21] stroke. And he been he was unconscious
[31:23] on the ground for about
[31:25] a half an hour. And we we want to be in
[31:28] prayer tonight. Satan is defeated. He's
[31:31] trying to attack everybody trying to
[31:33] attack the servant of God. And I declare
[31:36] he's a defeated foe. He's a real foe,
[31:40] but he's a defeated foe. He has some
[31:42] strength, but he's a bluff. He has no
[31:45] strength against the believer. And we
[31:47] need to believe tonight. Amen. I said at
[31:51] the church, we're going to take up
[31:52] offering each night. tonight and
[31:54] tomorrow night is for the expenses of
[31:56] the of the campgrounds and we've taken
[31:59] on some additional expenses. There's a
[32:01] hostel right here and they usually have
[32:03] people in that hostel have drug addicts
[32:06] and alcoholics and all kinds of thing.
[32:08] Last year they wouldn't let us have it
[32:10] and we put a lot of pressure on to get
[32:12] it and they they they charge us the top
[32:15] price for every room even though they
[32:17] never have all their rooms full. They
[32:19] told us themselves only have up to eight
[32:21] people in that whole hostel, but they
[32:24] charge us for every room. And we paid
[32:26] it. We paid $4,500
[32:29] just to have that place uh solely to the
[32:32] benefit of the believers. And I believe
[32:34] it's a good investment. We don't want
[32:37] spirits hanging around. Hallelujah. In
[32:39] the tent or out of the tent.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Do you support that?
[32:44] &gt;&gt; We felt that was a a wise thing to do.
[32:46] We got precious young people and
[32:48] children around here that we want to
[32:50] have in a pure atmosphere. And it's your
[32:53] children, mothers and fathers, that
[32:55] we're doing all of this effort for the
[32:57] kitchen staff. It's just unbelievable.
[33:00] All the people on the grounds and the
[33:02] people who worked for the sound and who
[33:04] put up the tent and all of these things.
[33:06] We're just so appreciative. If we had to
[33:08] pay for all of that, we couldn't even
[33:10] afford it. We just so thank God for
[33:12] burdened people. Hallelujah. the
[33:15] musicians and the singers and the
[33:16] counselors and everybody. Can't even
[33:18] name them all. But we just want you to
[33:20] open your hearts and give as God will
[33:22] lead you. On Saturday night, we want to
[33:24] take up a missionary offering. And so
[33:26] you can be prepared and there isn't a
[33:29] person here, not not even a young
[33:31] person. You can go to McDonald's. I'll
[33:34] tell you what, sacrifice a McDonald's
[33:36] and send some books or tapes or
[33:38] something to some person overseas.
[33:40] That's the best investment that you'd
[33:42] have. And so we'd like everybody to come
[33:44] prepared Saturday night to give and then
[33:46] Sunday of course will be our tithes and
[33:47] offerings. And so I wonder if you would
[33:50] uh just stand while we have a word of
[33:51] prayer and the deacons would come
[33:52] forward please. We're going to have a
[33:54] word of prayer.
[34:01] Amen.
[34:03] Praise the Lord.
[34:07] It is more blessed
[34:10] to
[34:13] Let's have everyone say it. It is more
[34:15] blessed to give than it is to receive.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Have you received?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; It's more blessed to give. Amen. Brother
[34:26] Gary, would you just ask God's blessing,
[34:27] please, upon the giving?
[34:30] Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Bless God.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you in your
[34:51] giving, brother.
[35:04] 3:14
[35:06] on the screen. In my life, Lord, be
[35:09] glorified.
[35:10] Be glorified
[35:14] in
[35:15] my
[35:17] life.
[35:19] Lord,
[35:21] be glorified.
[35:25] be glorified
[35:28] in
[35:32] his life.
[35:33] Lord
[35:36] be glorified
[35:39] today. Let's sing it again.
[35:42] Oh, in
[35:44] my
[35:46] life, oh Lord, be glorified.
[35:53] Be glorified
[35:58] by
[36:00] God.
[36:01] Oh,

[36:20] Be glorified.
[36:24] in everything that I say and you
[36:30] be glorified
[36:34] today.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And before we sing that course again,
[36:39] our sister Elizabeth Charity Gran I have
[36:42] a song for us as they come and get ready
[36:43] at this time as we sing this a couple
[36:46] more times. In my life, Lord be
[36:47] glorified.
[36:49] in
[36:51] my
[36:53] life.
[36:54] Oh Lord,
[36:56] be glorified.
[37:00] Be glorified
[37:03] in
[37:05] my
[37:06] life. Oh Lord, be glorified
[37:13] today. Let's sing it again.
[37:16] Oh
[37:18] my
[37:20] God. Oh Lord,
[37:23] be glorified.
[37:26] Be glorified
[37:30] in
[37:32] my
[37:33] life. Oh Lord,
[37:37] be glorified
[37:40] today.
[38:28] I've heard the words before.
[38:34] of how you came to die.
[38:40] A crown of thorns,
[38:44] nails in your hands,
[38:47] wounds
[38:49] in your side.
[38:54] People turned against you,
[39:00] even close
[39:03] friends.
[39:05] Yet you gave
[39:08] selflessly
[39:10] love that
[39:12] end.
[39:18] May I not forget
[39:24] all you've done for me.
[39:30] Dying for my sin on a hill called
[39:36] Calary.
[39:42] May I not forget
[39:48] the story ever true.
[39:54] Help my heart to remember.
[40:00] May I not forget
[40:03] you.
[40:18] New eyes
[40:23] you made.
[40:27] No one took your life. True love you
[40:35] gave.
[40:38] So when my heart betrays you,
[40:44] when I lose my way,
[40:49] lead me back to the cross and the price
[40:54] you paid.
[41:01] May I not forget
[41:06] all you've done for me.
[41:12] Dying for my sin on a hill called
[41:17] Calary.
[41:23] May I not forget
[41:28] the story ever true.
[41:34] Help my heart to remember.
[41:39] May I not forget
[41:43] you.
[41:48] May I not forget
[41:54] all you've done for me.
[41:59] Dying for my sin on a hill called
[42:05] Calary.
[42:10] May I not forget
[42:16] the story ever true.
[42:21] Help my heart to remember.
[42:27] May I not forget
[42:30] you.
[42:33] Help my heart to remember.
[42:39] May I not forget
[42:43] you.
[43:08] We're we're going to be going directly
[43:09] to the word now. We thank you
[43:13] young people for the song. Last night I
[43:17] left the tent after midnight and there
[43:21] were still people in here last night.
[43:25] When the presentation was over, I don't
[43:28] think there was
[43:30] anybody moved or anybody left. And then
[43:34] they began to pray and began to give
[43:37] themselves.
[43:38] That's the way the meeting started last
[43:41] night, the way most camp meetings end.
[43:45] It was outstanding. And I don't have the
[43:48] time to tell you that Sunday morning
[43:53] when God laid a certain text on my heart
[43:57] and changed the text between late
[44:00] Saturday night and Sunday morning and
[44:02] directed me and said, "Go to Mark the
[44:05] 10th chapter and make that your main
[44:08] text." And I went to Mark the 10th
[44:11] chapter. Brother Tom Ray, Sister
[44:14] Cororeen, and some of the others that
[44:16] were leading in their presentation have
[44:18] had in mind for months. This brother Tom
[44:22] had it on his heart, felt led to the
[44:24] Holy Spirit, the rich young ruler.
[44:28] And uh I was in the last four services
[44:31] not knowing that the last message that
[44:34] brother Brandham preached leadership was
[44:37] out of Mark 10 and not knowing that I'd
[44:40] be directed to that. And I had my text
[44:43] down as John 14 1 and regarding us
[44:48] following Christ. And then the Holy
[44:53] Spirit just turned it like that and said
[44:55] Mark 10. I went to Mark 10 and some of
[44:58] our people, brother Tom, Sister Joanne,
[45:02] Sister Corine, and two or three others,
[45:04] they told me that almost fell out of
[45:07] their chair. I begin to dramatize. I was
[45:10] standing to the right side of the pull
[45:12] pit dramatizing what the young ruler was
[45:16] going through, how he was so raised
[45:18] right by his parents. He had followed a
[45:20] mother. He had followed his school
[45:22] teacher. And I thought and while I was
[45:25] uh while I was in the last moments
[45:26] getting ready, the Holy Spirit said to
[45:28] me, this rich young ruler, those like
[45:31] the rich young ruler sitting in the
[45:32] church that oh God
[45:35] &gt;&gt; and I was so gripped and so anointed
[45:37] Sunday morning that I actually my human
[45:40] mind separated from my from the
[45:43] spiritual activity of the Holy Spirit.
[45:46] And while I would continue to preach, I
[45:48] had my own thoughts. My own mind was
[45:50] saying I I could take you right where I
[45:52] was standing standing at the right hand
[45:54] of the pulpit and my own mind was saying
[45:57] I was saying to myself why am I
[45:59] dramatizing and while I was thinking
[46:01] that and thinking it over for a few
[46:03] moments I continued to preach to the
[46:06] people and I knew there was such an
[46:07] atmosphere and I was thinking within
[46:10] myself why am I dramatizing this rich
[46:13] young ruler and didn't know that last
[46:16] night and the night before they were
[46:18] going to have it right here at camp and
[46:20] brother Tom had given those exact
[46:22] instructions to the others that were
[46:24] that were uh having to do with it. I can
[46:27] tell you friends, God has a mind.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; God has a plan.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; God has a thought for this service. And
[46:36] what you want to hear now, just be
[46:38] ready. There's a servant of God is going
[46:41] to come and open up this book. And God
[46:44] has a has expressed thought for the
[46:47] meeting now. and it's going to continue
[46:49] right on. There's something he's going
[46:51] to do. I don't know, but you be ready
[46:53] for it. We're going to sing Amazing
[46:55] Grace as our brother Ron Spencer from uh
[46:58] Virginia is going to come and minister
[47:01] to us now. Let's stand as we receive
[47:04] him.
[47:06] Amazing.
[47:09] Lift it up to him now. How sweet
[47:13] the sound
[47:15] that say
[47:19] a rest
[47:21] like me.
[47:25] I once
[47:28] was lost
[47:30] but now
[47:33] I'm found.
[47:35] I was blind,
[47:37] but now
[47:40] I see. When we've been there 10,000
[47:43] years. And we've
[47:47] been there
[47:49] 10,000
[47:52] years.
[47:54] Bright shining
[47:57] as
[47:58] the sun
[48:03] we blow
[48:06] less days
[48:08] to sing.
[48:10] Oh his praise. Let's sing it now. And
[48:13] when
[48:15] we first
[48:17] be God, everyone who has breath in their
[48:20] lungs, let's sing. Praise God. Praise
[48:23] God.
[48:24] Praise God.
[48:27] Praise God.
[48:29] Praise God.
[48:32] Praise God.
[48:34] Praise God.
[48:36] Praise God.
[48:41] Praise God.
[48:43] Praise God.
[48:46] Praise God.
[48:48] Praise God.
[48:50] Praise God.
[48:53] Praise God.
[48:55] Praise God.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; May we just bow our heads this evening.
[49:03] How many has come under expectation?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:09] We have been taught by the prophet of
[49:11] God that we get
[49:13] &gt;&gt; what we expect.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the father with that.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; you are the mighty one.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; We're very aware of your presence here
[49:33] even now.
[49:36] And we know that you are moving among
[49:38] us.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; We're your children.
[49:44] And Lord Jesus, we just ask you that
[49:47] father to this afternoon
[49:50] that Lord as we have spent time to
[49:55] &gt;&gt; prepare
[49:58] to follow the channel of the Lord.
[50:02] Lord, may even now all of our hearts
[50:05] both as speaker and as hearer
[50:08] step into that channel tonight, Father.
[50:12] that we might see ourselves
[50:15] &gt;&gt; in this up to-date moment of where we're
[50:18] at in our lives. God,
[50:20] &gt;&gt; may you move in this meeting, God.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the potential. This could
[50:27] be the greatest service we've ever been
[50:29] in our lives.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, because you're here,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; not a man is here. Not some personality
[50:37] is here. You're here.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that. And Lord,
[50:42] we're under expectation that you would
[50:44] speak to our hearts, that you would heal
[50:47] our bodies, THAT YOU WOULD DRIVE BACK
[50:50] THE DEMON POWERS OF HELL. LORD, you said
[50:54] whatever we BIND ON EARTH, YOU'D BIND IN
[50:56] HEAVEN. Whatever we'd loose on earth,
[50:59] you'd loose in heaven. And we're YOUR
[51:02] CHILDREN, AMBASSADORS OF GOD. And we ask
[51:05] you that you would move in a mighty way.
[51:08] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[51:11] pray.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Speak to our hearts.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for it in Jesus
[51:18] Christ's name. Let's just sing it one
[51:21] more time. Praise God. Praise God. Oh,
[51:25] praise God.
[51:28] Praise God.
[51:31] Praise God.
[51:33] Praise God.
[51:36] Praise God.
[51:38] Praise God.
[51:41] Praise God.
[51:46] Praise God.
[51:48] Praise God.
[51:51] Praise God.
[51:54] Praise God.
[51:56] Praise God.
[51:59] Praise God.
[52:01] Praise God.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] Amen. I would like to say it's an honor
[52:09] to be here this afternoon.
[52:11] I certainly appreciate brother Ed and
[52:14] brother Tom and all
[52:16] having the confidence to invite me to
[52:18] come and I certainly do appreciate this
[52:22] opportunity.
[52:24] May we turn into our scriptures this
[52:26] afternoon to Joshua chapter 23.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:43] I'd like to bring you greetings from
[52:45] home, the Shannondoa Valley.
[52:48] And uh
[52:50] we certainly
[52:52] do want to say that you have a sister
[52:54] church there that loves the Lord
[52:57] &gt;&gt; with all of their hearts. And so,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days there's going to
[53:02] be a meeting in the air.
[53:04] They'll live just down the street from
[53:06] you. Amen. Amen. Joshua chapter 23.
[53:14] I want to look this evening at Joshua's
[53:17] burden.
[53:20] And it came to pass a long time after
[53:24] the Lord had given rest unto Israel from
[53:28] all their enemies round about that
[53:32] Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.
[53:35] And Joshua called for all Israel, and
[53:39] for their elders, and for their heads,
[53:42] and for their judges, and for their
[53:45] officers, and said unto them, I am old
[53:48] and stricken in age. And ye have seen
[53:52] all that the Lord hath your God hath
[53:54] done unto all these nations
[53:57] because of you.
[53:59] For the Lord your God is he
[54:03] that hath fought for you.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Behold, I have divided unto you by of
[54:10] the lot of these nations that remain to
[54:14] be an inheritance for your tribes from
[54:17] Jordan with all the nations that I have
[54:20] cut off even to the great sea westward.
[54:24] And the Lord your God, he shall expel
[54:26] them from before you, and drive them
[54:29] from out of your sight, and he shall
[54:32] possess their land, and ye shall possess
[54:35] their land, as the Lord your God hath
[54:38] promised unto you.
[54:40] Be ye therefore very courageous to keep
[54:44] and to do all that is written in the
[54:48] book of the law of Moses, that ye turn
[54:51] not aside there from to the right hand
[54:56] or to the left, that ye come not among
[55:01] these nations, these that remain among
[55:04] you, neither make mention of the name of
[55:07] your their gods, nor cause to swear by
[55:11] them, neither to serve them, nor bow
[55:14] yourselves unto them, but cleave unto
[55:17] the Lord your God, as you have done unto
[55:22] this day.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless his word, and
[55:26] you may be seated this afternoon.
[55:38] Basically, the message believers, if you
[55:40] have been around the message for a few
[55:42] years,
[55:44] you're almost miniature theologians.
[55:49] So, I'm going to preach to you just like
[55:52] that. You've never heard anything like
[55:53] this before.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And so, as I do that, that way I won't
[55:59] feel intimidated by you. and uh and you
[56:04] won't feel intimidated by me. So that
[56:06] will be good. Brother Brandham makes
[56:10] some statements and I just want to just
[56:11] as we begin to to go into this subject
[56:14] this evening, maybe laying for just a
[56:17] little bit of a foundation.
[56:19] Brother Brandham calls Joshua the
[56:22] greatest general.
[56:24] He says that Joshua stood with Moses and
[56:28] and as he was there and and and if
[56:31] you'll understand he was there quite a
[56:33] quite a number of years through the
[56:36] journey through a lot of phases. That's
[56:38] right.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And as he begins to get towards the end
[56:41] of his age, there's something about when
[56:44] we get towards a certain spot in our age
[56:47] and we begin to notice that there's
[56:49] certain things beginning to go on, not
[56:52] just in our age, but as we get toward a
[56:55] certain spot in a dispensation when we
[56:59] know that we don't have very much
[57:00] longer, there's a certain urgency that
[57:04] hits our lives.
[57:07] I pray that you and I feel that urgency
[57:10] as we're coming to the nearness of the
[57:13] coming of the Lord.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; That we do not allow the promises of the
[57:17] covenant of the word that we are in.
[57:20] That is a part of our life to allow us
[57:23] TO BE COMMON AND FAMILIAR to us.
[57:27] Joshua was saying that his days are
[57:29] beginning to be numbered and as he's
[57:31] beginning to get a little older and as
[57:33] he's beginning to to to his his limbs
[57:36] and everything and his abilities are
[57:38] beginning to shrink from him. If you'll
[57:41] understand, he's had a special position
[57:44] in this great journey. He has been there
[57:48] as a leader. As a great leader, first of
[57:50] all, a great leader must be led.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; And he has to have a real leadership,
[57:56] something about him. And there's got to
[57:59] be something about us. We have to be led
[58:02] by the Holy Spirit
[58:04] &gt;&gt; and be SENSITIVE TO THE JUNCTIONS OF THE
[58:07] HOUR. As the sheep music as it begins to
[58:10] change in certain junctions, AS IT TAKES
[58:13] CERTAIN PHASES AND WE TURN CERTAIN
[58:15] CORNERS, WE MUST BE AWARE. YES, WE'RE
[58:18] GOING TO THE SAME JOBS. YES, WE'RE
[58:20] LIVING IN THE SAME HOMES. YES, THE
[58:23] governments are corrupt. Yes, SIN IS
[58:26] GETTING WORSE. BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER
[58:28] TO THE RAPTURE OF THE HOUR.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And we can SENSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT
[58:34] ARE MOVING and moving very rapidly.
[58:37] Right.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; JOSHUA SAYS, "AND AS I WAS WITH MOSES,"
[58:42] he said, "WE FIND ALSO THAT JOSHUA
[58:45] KNOWING THIS COMMISSION,
[58:48] knowing that it laid in his hand, that
[58:51] God had called him for a duty that he
[58:55] must not fail."
[58:58] &gt;&gt; He walked softly before the Lord. And
[59:02] when he CALLED THE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND
[59:04] TOLD THEM THAT GOD HAD COMMISSIONED HIM,
[59:08] watch the request of the people, HE
[59:11] SAYS, "WE'LL FOLLOW YOU AS WE DID
[59:12] MOSES."
[59:13] &gt;&gt; If we can see THE SAME THING THAT
[59:16] FOLLOWED MOSES following you,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; only be strong and courageous, THAT
[59:21] OUGHT TO BE REQUIRED OF EVERY BORNAGAIN
[59:26] PERSON TODAY.
[59:28] IF WE'RE REQUESTED TO FOLLOW, HE SAID,
[59:31] "LET'S SEE THE SIGNS, THE BELIEVER THAT
[59:34] FOLLOWS THAT BELIEVER AS JESUS SAID,
[59:36] "THE THINGS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO
[59:39] ALSO."
[59:41] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID,
[59:44] HE SAID IN SAMIAN CHURCH AGE, he said
[59:47] they WERE LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
[59:49] WHO CAME OUT OF EGYPT. HE SAID THEY
[59:52] STOPPED SHORT OF THE PROMISED LAND.
[59:54] TALKING ABOUT KADESH Marnea which I'll
[59:56] go to in just a moment. He said those
[59:58] children of Israel LEFT EGYPT ABOUT 2
[1:00:01] MILLION STRONG as they JOURNEYED
[1:00:03] TOGETHER. ALL SAME SAW THE SAME MIRACLES
[1:00:07] OF GOD. ALL PARTAKE of the same mana of
[1:00:11] the mana and the water from the smitten
[1:00:13] rock. All followed THE SAME CLOUD BY
[1:00:16] DAY, PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT, BUT ONLY
[1:00:20] two reached the promised land. Only two
[1:00:23] were real believers. COME ON.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S WHAT THAT IS CORRECT
[1:00:28] BECAUSE THE WORD TELLS US THAT THE REST
[1:00:31] OF THE OF THEM DIED BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF.
[1:00:34] HE SAID THEN SINCE THAT IS SO AND ONLY
[1:00:38] TWO ENTERED IN THEN THE REST WERE NOT
[1:00:40] TRUE BELIEVERS. HE SAID WHAT MADE THE
[1:00:43] DIFFERENCE? TWO stayed with the word.
[1:00:50] Brother Brandon makes this statement as
[1:00:52] as we begin to go and he says he as he
[1:00:56] comes to this. He said talking about
[1:00:58] Kadis Barnea again. He said, "Way before
[1:01:01] it happened, when they come there with
[1:01:04] Caleb and those other spies and they
[1:01:07] seen the great opposition, the
[1:01:09] Amalocites and the Persites and the
[1:01:12] Hitites and SO FORTH ALL FENCED IN there
[1:01:15] at Jericho could run a chariot race on
[1:01:19] the top of that place. Great strong men
[1:01:22] unbelieving among them." HE SAYS, "WHY
[1:01:25] WE LOOK LIKE GRASSHOPPERS
[1:01:28] IN THE SIGHT of them?" I WANT YOU TO DO
[1:01:31] THIS TO UNDERSTAND. GOD KNEW THAT ALL OF
[1:01:34] THOSE people were there.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT NEED A CRISIS MEETING TO
[1:01:40] HEAR THOSE 10 MEN COME BACK WITH THAT
[1:01:43] REPORT.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; NOW, UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY, THESE WERE
[1:01:48] ALL ISRAEL'S REPRESENTATIVES.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; THEY ALL CAME OUT OF EGYPT. THEY ALL WAS
[1:01:54] GOING THROUGH THE WILDERNESS. THEY ALL
[1:01:56] SAW THE SANCTUARIANS AND ALL THEY THEY
[1:01:59] SAW THE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THEY
[1:02:02] WERE IN THE UPTO-DATE EXPERIENCE.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And they WERE RENOWNED MEN AS THEY WENT
[1:02:09] ACROSS AND THEY WENT TO THEIR CHOSEN
[1:02:12] INHERITANCE, THEIR PLACE THAT THEY
[1:02:14] SHOULD HAVE WENT TO.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGIN TO LOOK, IS THIS FOR ME?
[1:02:20] AND THEY CAME BACK WITH THE REPORT. YES,
[1:02:22] IT'S A GOOD LAND. YES, IT'S A GOOD
[1:02:25] MESSAGE.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS FULL OF OF OF MILK AND
[1:02:32] HONEY, AND IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL TRUTH,
[1:02:35] BUT THERE'S GREAT MYSTERIES THERE.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:42] BUT WE FOUND SOME THINGS OVER THERE.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; They begin to go with a report
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MESSAGE HAD NOT BECOME REAL
[1:02:54] to them.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD TOLD THEM, "I'M GOING TO
[1:03:00] SEND HORNETS BEFORE YOU."
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD THEM, "IT IS YOUR LAND."
[1:03:06] IT CANNOT GET ANY MORE PLAIN
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; TO THE GROUP OF PEOPLE. I WILL DO THE
[1:03:12] FIGHTING FOR YOU.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; JUST GO. I'LL DO THE FIGHTING FOR YOU.
[1:03:20] IT'S A GOOD LAND. IT'S YOUR POSSESSED
[1:03:22] LAND.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, UNDERSTAND THIS WASN'T JUST A A
[1:03:27] COUPLE OF DAY FLY BY NIGHT JOURNEY.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Abraham had met Mechazedc.
[1:03:35] AND WHEN MELAZDC COULD SWEAR BY NO
[1:03:38] GREATER, HE SWORE BY HIMSELF AND HE GAVE
[1:03:42] HIM A COVENANT
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; THAT THY CITY SHALL POSSESS THE GATES OF
[1:03:47] THEIR ENEMY.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; NOW, SURE THEY WERE ALL ISRAEL. SURE,
[1:03:53] THEY HAD ENJOYED GION. SURE, THEY HAD
[1:03:56] ENJOYED THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS AND
[1:03:58] THE MIRACLES. AND THEY HAD COME ACROSS
[1:04:00] AND THEY HAD DANCED AT THE RED SEA. AND
[1:04:02] THEY'D WATCHED THEIR GREAT ENEMY. WHO
[1:04:05] COULDN'T DANCE?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; WHO COULDN'T DANCE THAT DAY?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE GREATEST ARMY THAT THERE HAD
[1:04:14] EVER BEEN ON THE EARTH TO THAT POINT WAS
[1:04:16] DROWNING BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES.
[1:04:21] BROTHER RAM SAID JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:04:23] OF THAT OF THAT OF THAT RED SEA, HE SAID
[1:04:26] THERE THEY STOOD SAID IT LOOKED LIKE
[1:04:29] EVEN NATURE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING
[1:04:31] TO BE THE BLOODIEST MASSACRE THAT THERE
[1:04:34] EVER BEEN.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID SOMETIMES GOD'S PATH LEADS US
[1:04:40] RIGHT INTO A SPOT LIKE THAT.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T
[1:04:43] UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:04:46] MY SITUATION." GOD'S PATH LED YOU RIGHT
[1:04:49] THERE.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Ron, I MADE SOME BAD
[1:04:55] CHOICES. SO DID JONAH.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; I talked to a biologist the other day
[1:05:07] and I asked him, I SAID, "I WANT TO ASK
[1:05:09] YOU A QUESTION.
[1:05:12] How long DID THAT FISH HAVE TO GROW TO
[1:05:14] BE THE SIZE THAT IT HAD TO BE?
[1:05:19] TO WHERE IT COULD swallow
[1:05:21] a man like Jonah.
[1:05:24] He said that fish had to swim for
[1:05:26] hundred years
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; to be in that position.
[1:05:31] God knew
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN EVEN CAME ON the earth.
[1:05:38] That's it.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; ROMANS 5 SAID HE LOVED YOU WHILE YOU
[1:05:46] WERE YET A sinner
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; when you WERE UNLOVABLE.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WERE IN A CONDITIONAL STATE OF
[1:05:55] LOOKING LIKE NO WAY THAT YOU COULD
[1:05:57] OBTAIN MERCY. GOD LOVED YOU.
[1:06:01] AND LET ME JUST SAY, GOD SIGNED A
[1:06:03] COVENANT
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH FOR YOU.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:06:13] COURAGEOUS, THESE MEN,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY, LET ME JUST PUT IT LIKE
[1:06:18] THIS. THESE LEADERS, THESE ELDERS OF THE
[1:06:21] CHURCH,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; THE ELDERS OF THE TRIBE SHOULD HAVE CAME
[1:06:25] BACK WITH THE COVENANT IN THEIR HANDS.
[1:06:28] THAT'S RIGHT. WITH THE EVIDENCE IN THEIR
[1:06:30] HAND AND LET'S HAVE A CHEERLEADING
[1:06:33] SESSION. LET'S GO GET THE LAND.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ONLY JUST AND I JUST WANT TO
[1:06:42] JUST CAPTIVATE THIS AND I MAY HAVE WENT
[1:06:43] AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO GET YOU WHERE I
[1:06:45] WANT YOU TO GO, BUT I WANT YOU JUST TO
[1:06:47] UNDERSTAND JOSHUA'S BURDEN JUST ISN'T AT
[1:06:49] THE END OF HIS JOURNEY, BUT HE'S WATCHED
[1:06:52] THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WONDER
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; WITH THE COVENANT RIGHT IN THEIR HANDS.
[1:06:58] AND IT'S THEIRS.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; WATCH.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I feel better now.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; He said, but he said, HE SAID, "THIS
[1:07:21] CHURCH IS IN ITS DELIVERANCE.
[1:07:24] IS A PERFECT TYPE OF Israel in their
[1:07:27] deliverance.
[1:07:29] WHEN ISRAEL TOOK ITS STAND UPON THE
[1:07:31] PURE, HOLY, UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD,
[1:07:36] IT WAS GOING TO TAKE ITS STAND AND TAKE
[1:07:39] ITS MARCH. Moses led the children of
[1:07:42] Israel with the little bread, KNEADED
[1:07:44] BREAD ON THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD, KOSHER,
[1:07:47] AND THEY MARCHED TO THE RED SEA. HE SAID
[1:07:50] GOD'S PATH LED THEM RIGHT UP TO THE RED
[1:07:52] SEA. AND WELL SAID NOW HOW ARE WE GOING
[1:07:55] TO GET ACROSS SOMEBODY LOOKED BACK AND
[1:07:57] SAID LOOK COMING YONDER THE DUSTES ARE
[1:08:00] BLOWING THERE'S THOUSANDS TIMES
[1:08:02] THOUSANDS OF PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS RIGHT
[1:08:04] BEHIND THEM THAT MIXED MULTITUDE THAT
[1:08:07] WENT RIGHT WITH THEM BEGIN TO QUIVER AND
[1:08:10] SHAKE
[1:08:12] WHICH FOLLOWED FINALLY PERISHED WITH THE
[1:08:16] GANG SAYING OF KORA NO DOUBT BUT WHAT
[1:08:19] THE VERY NATURE OF THE HILL SHOOK
[1:08:22] GOING TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST BLOODIEST
[1:08:25] MASSACRES THAT HAD EVER BEEN EVER SEEN.
[1:08:27] A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BUNCH OF PEOPLE
[1:08:30] STANDING THERE BY THE SIDE OF THE SEA.
[1:08:32] HE SAID, "LITTLE CHILDREN BACKED UP
[1:08:34] AGAINST MAMA HOLDING HER DRESS. POOR OLD
[1:08:37] DAD LEANING AGAINST THEIR BOY CRYING
[1:08:40] SAYING, "SON, I'VE LIVED MY DAYS, BUT I
[1:08:42] HATE TO SEE YOU GOING. LOOK COMING
[1:08:44] YONDER. ALL NATURE WHO DREADS DEATH.
[1:08:47] EVEN THE FLOWERS AND THE TREES AND
[1:08:49] EVERYTHING ELSE IS AFRAID OF DEATH.
[1:08:51] NATURE QUIVERED AND GROANED AND SHOOK
[1:08:53] UNDER THEIR FEET WHEN THEY SEEN THAT
[1:08:56] BLOODY MASSACRE COMING. HE SAID, "WHAT
[1:08:59] WAS GOD DOING?" HE SAID, "WHAT A TIE."
[1:09:02] HE SAID, "THEY FAILED TO REALIZE HANGING
[1:09:05] RIGHT YONDER STOOD A SUPERNATURAL POWER,
[1:09:08] THE HALO OF GOD, A PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:09:11] HANGING THERE THAT WOULD STAND BETWEEN
[1:09:13] THEM AND THE ENEMY. WHEN IT COME TIME TO
[1:09:16] STAND, NATURE QUIVERING, THE SEA BEGIN
[1:09:19] TO GET NERVOUS. THE MOON LOOKING DOWN
[1:09:21] QUIVERING. THE BIRDS FLEW FROM THE
[1:09:24] SCENE. ANIMALS RUN BACK. OH, WHAT AN
[1:09:27] ENDLESS MURDERING OF MILLIONS ARE GOING
[1:09:29] TO DIE IN A FEW MINUTES. AND THEY ARE
[1:09:31] ALL GROANING. BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING?
[1:09:34] THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE PATH OF GOD.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; OH, I like that. Don't you?
[1:09:45] He said there's hanging bombs,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; cobalt bombs,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; a proclamation rising up to stop now all
[1:09:53] the inter denomination and consolidate
[1:09:55] to to one great big evangelical
[1:09:59] group church of the Protestants which
[1:10:02] will cooperate and join with Catholicism
[1:10:05] and combat communism. It's the work of
[1:10:07] the devil.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, sir. God never did
[1:10:11] associate saint and the world and and
[1:10:13] and Satan's church together. God leads
[1:10:16] his church
[1:10:18] and he don't don't expect political
[1:10:21] powers to lead them. Not even the church
[1:10:24] politics. Every man that is born of THE
[1:10:28] SPIRIT OF GOD is free. Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT WOULD TAKEN PLACE IN THE
[1:10:37] RIVER OF JORDAN 2,000 YEARS AGO WHEN THE
[1:10:41] WORLD HAD BEEN IN CHAOS FOR A LONG TIME.
[1:10:44] ISRAEL HAD REJECTED GOD, REJECTED THE
[1:10:47] LAWS, REJECTED HIS STATUTES, HIS
[1:10:49] ORDINANCE, AND HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY.
[1:10:51] And and never was Israel ever harmed as
[1:10:55] long as THEY STAYED IN A HARMONY WITH
[1:10:57] GOD'S COMMAND. AND HE SAID, "AND NEVER
[1:11:00] WILL A CHURCH FAIL.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; NEVER WILL A PROGRAM FAIL AS LONG AS
[1:11:06] THOSE ARE IN CHARGE STAY IN THE CENTER
[1:11:09] OF GOD'S WILL."
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GOD'S WILL IS PERFECT."
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, THAT DIDN'T LOOK PERFECT,
[1:11:18] BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "AND
[1:11:23] EVERYTHING WILL FALL RIGHT INTO ITS
[1:11:25] PLACE. YOU STAY IN GOD'S WILL. HE SAYS,
[1:11:28] "BUT GET OUT OF GOD'S WILL." HE SAYS,
[1:11:31] "HERE, IT THROWS THE WHOLE PROGRAM OUT."
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IN THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE
[1:11:36] LIVING," HE SAID, "THIS GREAT CHAOS THAT
[1:11:38] WE'RE IN NOW, IT'S THE DARKEST HOUR
[1:11:41] THAT'S EVER SEEN. WHERE IS THE HOPE?
[1:11:44] SPUTNIKS IN THE SKIES, ATOMIC BOMBS,
[1:11:47] CONTROL MISSILES ANY NO NATION CAN
[1:11:50] DESTROY IN ONE HOUR.
[1:11:54] RIGHT.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT OUGHT THE CHURCH TO DO TONIGHT?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THOUGH IN A BLINDED WORLD OF
[1:12:01] SIN AND CHAOS, WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT
[1:12:03] OURSELVES AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID, "WHAT KIND OF
[1:12:13] PEOPLE SHOULD WE BE IF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:12:16] HAS YOU SO EMBODIED OR EMPOWERED THAT
[1:12:19] YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN THOUGHTS?
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN MIND, YOU DON'T
[1:12:25] USE YOUR OWN OPINION, BUT THE HOLY
[1:12:27] SPIRIT HAS YOU SO BUILT
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR BEING. IT'S
[1:12:34] GOD'S SPIRIT EXPRESSING ITSELF THROUGH
[1:12:37] YOU." AND WHAT KIND OF A CHURCH
[1:12:42] I CAN JUST SEE I CAN JUST SEE AND I JUST
[1:12:45] WANT TO TIE THIS RIGHT BACK TOGETHER. I
[1:12:47] CAN JUST SEE THE SPIRIT OF JOSHUA AND
[1:12:50] CALEB.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; YES. THERE WERE MEN
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; THAT COME BACK WITH AN EVIL REPORT.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; YES, THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE DRAWING
[1:13:00] BACK. BUT THEY TOOK THE COVENANT OF THE
[1:13:03] WORD
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:13:08] AMEN.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR AS THE TESTIMONY SERVICES
[1:13:12] GOING ON THAT EVENING. MAYBE IT WAS
[1:13:14] GOING LONG THAT DAY AND 10 HAD GIVE
[1:13:17] THEIR REPORTS.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THEY'RE JUST HOLDING
[1:13:20] THEMSELVES, MAYBE GRINNING THEIR TEETH
[1:13:22] AND MAYBE CHEWING THEIR GUM A LITTLE BIT
[1:13:25] BECAUSE THAT REVELATION IS DROPPED IN
[1:13:28] THEIR HEART.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[1:13:35] THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST HANGING TO
[1:13:37] THAT COVENANT.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE HANGING TO EVERY WORD THAT
[1:13:43] MOSES, THAT MIGHTY MESSENGER OF GOD, HAS
[1:13:47] SPOKE TO THEM.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; EVERY QUOTE THEY'RE BELIEVING HAS COME
[1:13:51] RIGHT STRAIGHT FROM THE MIND OF GOD.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE BELIEVING IT SAYS THAT
[1:13:58] ABOUT THEM.
[1:14:01] THEY HAVE TAKEN IT PERSONAL.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE TAKEN IT PERSONAL. NOW, I'M
[1:14:08] GLAD FOR UNCLES AND AUNTS AND AND ALL
[1:14:11] THOSE OTHERS, BUT IT HAS TO BE A
[1:14:13] PERSONAL REVELATION FOR YOU.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; TWO IN THE BED, ONE TO BE TAKEN, ONE TO
[1:14:20] BE LEFT. TWO IN THE FIELD. I WANT YOU TO
[1:14:22] KNOW IF THERE'S ONE GOING IN VIRGINIA,
[1:14:24] YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT ONE.
[1:14:30] COME ON, CHURCH. THAT REVELATION HAS TO
[1:14:33] DROP IN YOUR HEART.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M WAITING ON THIS AND I'M
[1:14:36] WAITING ON THAT. LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE
[1:14:38] WEIGHT IN MY MIND. I WANT TO ANCHOR
[1:14:41] MYSELF IN THAT WORD.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; GOD WROTE A COVENANT WITH THE FAMILIES
[1:14:47] OF THE EARTH. I'M A PART OF THAT
[1:14:49] COVENANT.
[1:14:55] YES.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE CHURCH IS ON ITS road that
[1:15:00] WHEN THE CHURCH WILL BE SO WRAPPED IN
[1:15:03] CHRIST
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT, MANKIND,
[1:15:07] SO AWAY FROM THEMSELVES
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES.
[1:15:14] THEY DON'T HAVE NO THOUGHTS BUT TO SERVE
[1:15:18] GOD. AMEN.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT REALLY SERVING GOD
[1:15:22] FIRST PLACE IN THEIR LIVES.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, BUT I'VE GOT THIS TO DO
[1:15:26] AND I'VE GOT THAT TO DO. AND I'M SO, LET
[1:15:28] ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. DON'T LET THOSE
[1:15:30] THINGS DISTRACT YOU. AS I USED IT THIS
[1:15:33] MORNING, MAKE SURE AS MOSES DID, HE
[1:15:36] FOCUSED HIMSELF ON THE WORD. SURE, there
[1:15:40] were A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON
[1:15:42] AROUND HIM, BUT HE KEPT HIMSELF
[1:15:44] DISCIPLINED AND FOCUSED ON WHAT GOD HAD
[1:15:47] HIM TO DO.
[1:15:58] They that are the sons of God are led by
[1:16:00] the spirit of God.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He said when the human element goes out
[1:16:04] and the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:16:08] where you empty yourself
[1:16:11] then will be the church in its power.
[1:16:15] Brother Ron, who's he talking about?
[1:16:18] You're rubbing shoulders with them.
[1:16:28] You know, many times we come to camps,
[1:16:32] if we're not careful, we'll get in the
[1:16:33] camp atmosphere
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; and we'll get in the cycle
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; to where that we get energized
[1:16:45] by the element of the atmosphere.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. AND WE FALL RIGHT back
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; into the Mount Horb experience
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; in a few weeks.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Right back into the desert,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; right back into worldly
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS SATAN'S DESIRE THAT HE
[1:17:07] COULD SIFT YOU
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE KNOWS WHAT THE WORD
[1:17:12] SAYS ABOUT YOU. HE CAN READ THE BOOK,
[1:17:14] TOO.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
[1:17:16] HE CAN READ THE QUOTES AS WELL.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS HE COULD READ DEUTERONOMY
[1:17:22] 28, WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT BEING BLESSED,
[1:17:25] I'LL MAKE YOU THE HEAD AND NOT THE TAIL.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; HE JUST HE COULD READ ALL THE COVENANT
[1:17:31] OF WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF
[1:17:33] ISRAEL, HOW THAT HE'S GOING TO GIVE THEM
[1:17:36] THE LAND, BUT HE WAS CONSTANTLY IN THEIR
[1:17:38] EARS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET
[1:17:40] IT. THERE'S GIANTS OVER THERE. THE
[1:17:43] CITIES ARE WALLED. THEY'RE INCREDIBLE
[1:17:46] ARMIES THERE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU
[1:17:48] CAN GO. LOOK HOW SMALL YOU ARE.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO INTELLECTUAL ABILITY ON YOUR
[1:17:53] OWN.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; As long as he intimidates you, you're
[1:17:57] not going to do anything.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, Brother Ron, I'm just A
[1:18:02] YOUNG PERSON." I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[1:18:04] WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M 9 YEARS OLD AND SATAN
[1:18:12] IS TERRIFIED OF YOU.
[1:18:14] WHEN YOU ROLL OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
[1:18:17] AND YOU PUT YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; AND YOU GO ON YOUR KNEES, THE KINGDOM OF
[1:18:23] HELL SHAKES
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF
[1:18:30] GOD.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS SIGNED A COVENANT WITH YOU.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, DO I HAVE TO WAIT TILL I GET A
[1:18:40] CERTAIN AGE? YOU'RE YOU'RE WHEN YOU
[1:18:43] UNDERSTAND THAT WORD OF GOD AND WHAT IT
[1:18:45] SAYS ABOUT YOU.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; PULL YOUR SWORD.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; SURE THERE'S DEMON POWERS EVERYWHERE,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; BUT WE WERE DESIGNED TO LIVE HERE.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; WE WERE BUILT TO LIVE HERE IN this
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; s.
[1:19:09] Oh, don't you love the Lord?
[1:19:14] He says this
[1:19:22] 13 in numbers 13 verse 26 and they went
[1:19:26] and they came to Moses and Aaron to all
[1:19:28] the children the congregation of the
[1:19:30] children of Israel under the wilderness
[1:19:32] of Pan and Kish brought back the word
[1:19:35] unto them unto all the the congregation
[1:19:37] and showed them the fruit of the land
[1:19:39] and they told him and said, "We came
[1:19:41] unto the land which weather thou sent
[1:19:43] us,
[1:19:45] and surely it flowth with milk and
[1:19:48] honey.
[1:19:50] This is the fruit of it."
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But this message is too straight to
[1:19:56] live.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; There's too much legalism.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; It's too hard.
[1:20:10] We need entertainment.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; We need to mix a little bit with it.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO TO BRING PERSONALITIES IN.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO INVOLVE A LITTLE WHIRLISM IN
[1:20:29] IT.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; A LITTLE DENOMINATIONAL CARRYOVER IN IT.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF
[1:20:35] ITSELF.
[1:20:38] NOAH PREACHED 120 YEARS, SAME MESSAGE.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE IF YOU WERE A REGULAR ATTENDER
[1:20:51] OF HIS CHURCH, YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT, YOU
[1:20:53] KNOW, I WISH HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS SUBJECT
[1:20:56] MATTER.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; BUT NO MATTER WHERE HE STARTED, HE WOUND
[1:21:01] UP
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; WITH GOD HAS SPOKEN TO ME.
[1:21:07] AND HE'S GOING TO DESTROY THIS EARTH
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; WITH WATER.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE ONLY ARK OF SAFETY. YOU
[1:21:17] MUST, THERE'S NOT A QUESTION. YOU MUST
[1:21:20] GET ON THIS ARC.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PROVISION.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; AND NO DOUBT THEY WANTED TO HEAR
[1:21:27] SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear something else.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I LIKE AN ADDITION TO IT. I'D LIKE SOME
[1:21:35] ENTERTAINMENT WITH IT.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE
[1:21:38] MIXED WITH IT. BUT NOAH SAID, "THIS IS
[1:21:41] THE WORD FOR THIS DAY."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE MESSAGE WILL STAND ON ITS
[1:21:45] OWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADD NOTHING TO
[1:21:47] IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROFIT UP.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; THE COVENANT SAID, "IT'S YOUR LAND.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; GO GET IT.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; GO GET IT. I'LL SEND THE FOR YOU.
[1:22:02] AMEN.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I imagine as the day went on, as he as
[1:22:08] they heard these men talking about, we
[1:22:11] are like grasshoppers.
[1:22:14] No way that we CAN ATTAIN. NO WAY THAT
[1:22:17] WE CAN ATTAIN. OH, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
[1:22:20] AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
[1:22:23] THIS AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THAT.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE SEEMS TOO HIGH, TOO ALOOF.
[1:22:32] We're too busy.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Joshua looked
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; burden in his heart. Caleb,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; he just couldn't stand it no more.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; The scripture says he steal the people.
[1:22:54] Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine the the strength in
[1:23:01] his voice.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE THE BROTHER TOM. I DON'T
[1:23:05] HAVE THE STRENGTH OF MY VOICE TO EVEN GO
[1:23:07] DOWN THE SAME PATH THAT HE WENT.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE DIDN'T GIVE UP AND GIVE SOME
[1:23:11] WHISPERING SERMON THAT DAY.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE DIDN'T STAND BEHIND THE
[1:23:18] PULLPIT AND AND AND SPEAK LATIN FOR A
[1:23:21] WHILE.
[1:23:24] That's right.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE WASN'T QUITE AS ELOQUENT AS
[1:23:27] SOME OF THEM WANTED TO HEAR,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; YES, THERE'S DEMONS. YES, THERE'S PEOPLE
[1:23:38] THAT'S ON THE PROPERTY.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID we expect?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO BE MOLDED BY CHARACTER.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO FIGHT SOME OBSTACLES.
[1:23:51] WE'RE HERE TO PROVE THE WORD OF GOD IS
[1:23:54] REAL.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PATH THAT HE'S BROUGHT US
[1:23:59] THROUGH. HE'S BROUGHT US THIS FAR. HE'S
[1:24:02] MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; HE'S more than able.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT IT WAY OUT SOMEWHERE ANOTHER.
[1:24:13] OH, WAY WAY WAY OUT YONDER. THAT VISION
[1:24:17] OUGHT TO BE AN EXPECTANCY. IT COULD
[1:24:19] HAPPEN TONIGHT.
[1:24:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; OUR ENERGIES SHOULD BE SO RIVETED AROUND
[1:24:28] THIS MESSAGE.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS MESSAGE WAS NOT A KAKIAN'S
[1:24:32] MESSAGE. THIS WAS A VOICE BEHIND A VOICE
[1:24:36] THAT WAS SPEAKING TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:24:38] CHRIST. AND WE'RE COMMISSIONED LIKE AN
[1:24:41] ARMY
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; TO STICK TO THE WORD, TO STICK TO OUR
[1:24:46] PART OF THE SCRIPT LIKE CALEB DID AND
[1:24:48] SAY WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand says when God gets ready
[1:25:01] to do something, he always has a witness
[1:25:04] of it.
[1:25:05] I'M SO GLAD THAT WE CAN LOOK AROUND
[1:25:07] before the coming of the Lord and see
[1:25:09] the witnesses of his appearing. Seeing
[1:25:12] the signs of the church and the near
[1:25:14] approaching of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:25:17] seeing it see word by word fulfilled.
[1:25:20] EVEN THE LAST SIGN TO BE GIVEN TO THE
[1:25:23] CHURCH BEFORE THE APPEARING OF THE LORD
[1:25:24] JESUS, IT'S WORKING IN THE CHURCH RIGHT
[1:25:27] NOW. THE LAST thing remember HE SAID AS
[1:25:31] IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM SO SHALL IT
[1:25:34] BE IN THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN. HE
[1:25:36] SAYS LOOK WHAT THE SINNERS WAS DOING IN
[1:25:39] SODOM. LOOK WHAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:25:41] DID WHEN HE COME DOWN to bear RECORD OF
[1:25:43] IT. WATCH THIS. WHAT THE THREE WHAT THE
[1:25:45] THREE ANGELS DID ALL THREE OF THEM. HE
[1:25:47] SAYS LOOK AT THE WORLD TODAY AND IT SIN.
[1:25:50] LOOK AT THE CHURCH TODAY LIKE LOT. LOOK
[1:25:53] LIKE LOOK AT LOOK AT ALL THE CHURCH ALL
[1:25:56] THE CALLED OUT CHURCH HAVING TO HAVING A
[1:25:59] STRUGGLE LIKE ABRAHAM WAS. THE MAN OF or
[1:26:03] the man OR WOMAN TODAY THAT TRIES TO
[1:26:06] LIVE FOR GOD HAS A STRUGGLE
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; TO KEEP ON GOING.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I HAVE A HARD TIME. YES.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:26:23] BUT WE'RE BUILT FOR THIS.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "YOU HAVE TO PRESS
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD."
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS ISN'T A SECONDHANDED
[1:26:38] RELIGION. THIS CAN'T BE HANDED DOWN FROM
[1:26:40] GENERATION TO GENERATION.
[1:26:44] JOSHUA SAW THOSE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND
[1:26:46] GOD SPOKE TO HIM TO STOP THE WHOLE THING
[1:26:49] ONE DAY. AND HE SAID, "THERE'S SOME THAT
[1:26:51] HAS GREW UP AMONG YOU."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THE OLD FIGHTERS HAVE DIED
[1:26:56] OFF." AND HE SAID, HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU
[1:26:58] TO CIRCUMCISE AGAIN."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I WANT YOU TO
[1:27:04] CIRCUMCISE AGAIN. THOSE YOUNG MEN THAT
[1:27:07] HAVE GREW UP IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR,
[1:27:10] THEY NEED THE HOLY GHOST FOR THEMSELVES.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; THEY NEED THAT LEADERSHIP. THEY NEED
[1:27:17] THAT SEAL OF CIRCUMCISION FOR
[1:27:19] THEMSELVES.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE.
[1:27:23] BROTHER RON, I WALKED TO THE ALTAR. I
[1:27:25] WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; FOR YOURSELF.
[1:27:34] We're not careful, we'll have it as a
[1:27:35] Baptist.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Just believe a quote.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; The devil does that.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Just go to church. I WANT YOU TO KNOW AT
[1:27:47] MY CHURCH, HE'S THE BEST ATTENDER I
[1:27:48] HAVE.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And he believes BROTHER BRANDON WAS A
[1:27:54] PROPHET.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. BY HIM BELIEVES THAT.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. That's right.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT
[1:28:05] DOESN'T MAKE HIM RAPTURE MATERIAL.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT THE DEVIL HATES IS TO SEE THAT
[1:28:12] LIFE COME ON THE BELIEVER.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S NO MORE THE LIFE OF YOU TRYING
[1:28:19] TO LIVE IT,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; BUT HE COMES AND LIVES INSIDE OF you
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and he BECOMES THE PULSATION
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; AND HE BECOMES THE COMFORTER IN YOUR
[1:28:29] HEART.
[1:28:36] He said Jehovah Gyra, we which are alive
[1:28:41] and remain to the coming of the Lord
[1:28:44] shall not prevent them which are asleep.
[1:28:48] For the trumpet shall sound, AND THE
[1:28:50] DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE, and we shall
[1:28:53] be changed in a moment, and in a
[1:28:56] twinkling of an eye, AND BE CAUGHT UP
[1:28:59] TOGETHER TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR
[1:29:01] forever to be with the Lord, THAT THAT
[1:29:04] GREAT SON THAT'S COMING. HE SAID, SEE
[1:29:08] HIM GETTING HIS CHURCH READY. WHAT'S HE
[1:29:11] DOING? HE'S SHOWING THEM HIS LAST SIGN.
[1:29:14] AND THE NEXT THING IS WHAT? THE RAPTURE.
[1:29:16] THE RAPTURE. THE SON APPEARS AND WE'RE
[1:29:20] CHANGED. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "WE CAN'T GO.
[1:29:23] WE CAN'T GO GET HIM IN THE AIR. HE'S TOO
[1:29:26] HIGH FOR US. BUT WE'LL BE CHANGED LIKE
[1:29:28] ABRAHAM THE FATHER WAS IN A MOMENT AND
[1:29:31] THE TWINKLE OF AN EYE AND BE CAUGHT UP
[1:29:34] TOGETHER TO MEET HIM IN THE AIR." YOU
[1:29:36] SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'VE HEARD THAT OVER
[1:29:38] AND OVER AND OVER." WELL, THERE WAS A
[1:29:41] LITTLE GIRL ONE TIME THAT MET A MAN FROM
[1:29:43] THE ARMOR IN COMPANY.
[1:29:50] AND SHE WAS THROWING OUT SOME DISHWATER.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THE 10 OTHER GIRLS, WE'LL SAY
[1:29:59] IT tonight
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; for the for OUR TYPE OF DRAMATIZATION.
[1:30:04] THE 10 OTHER GIRLS
[1:30:07] WITH THEIR DENOMINATIONAL FROLIC
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR PARTY THAT WAS GOING ON
[1:30:13] THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE THE ONE.
[1:30:15] OH YEAH.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS DOING HER DUTY.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS SIMPLY GOING ABOUT DOING
[1:30:24] WHAT SHE KNEW TO BE RIGHT.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; AND AS SHE WAS THROWING OUT THE WATER,
[1:30:30] SHE HAD A VISITOR.
[1:30:36] You say, "OH, BROTHER RON, BUT I CAN'T
[1:30:37] PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT I I JUST, YOU
[1:30:40] KNOW, I I I SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,
[1:30:43] SOMETIMES, BROTHER RON, YOU KNOW, I JUST
[1:30:45] I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW
[1:30:47] PEOPLE THAT HE LIVES INSIDE OF MY
[1:30:49] HEART." SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHOW
[1:30:51] THEM A RING.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHOW THEM A
[1:30:57] PIECE OF PAPER.
[1:31:00] BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING A COVENANT THAT
[1:31:02] WAS SAID IN HIS WORDS.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU. AND JUST AS
[1:31:16] MUCH AS HE TOLD CALEB AND JOSHUA, "GO
[1:31:19] GET YOUR LAMP."
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; JUST AS MUCH AS HE TOLD THAT LITTLE
[1:31:23] GIRL, "I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU." OH
[1:31:26] YEAH.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; SHE BE TO GET BUSY ABOUT DOING HER
[1:31:29] CHORES. THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT
[1:31:32] SHALL WE DO? GO SIT UNDER A TENT
[1:31:35] SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. SIT AROUND AND DO
[1:31:37] NOTHING. NO, THAT WORD IS LIKE AN ATOMIC
[1:31:41] BOMB.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP EATING ON THAT WORD.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF
[1:31:49] MAN. WORD UPON WORD UPON WORD UPON WORD
[1:31:54] BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; NOT THE PERSONALITY OF A MAN BUT THE
[1:32:01] WORD ITSELF.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; She kept washing dishes.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You just keep going to work.
[1:32:13] Yes, sir.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; She just kept doing the things that she
[1:32:18] she normally did.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; She washed her dirty clothes.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; She fixed their eggs.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; She fixed her cereal.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; She did whatever SHE HAD TO DO.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; But now she had a testimony.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; HER STEP WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
[1:32:39] SAME CHORES,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; BUT JUST HER STEPS ARE A LITTLE BIT
[1:32:42] LIGHTER.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; I'M IN THIS WORLD, BUT I'M NOT OF THIS
[1:32:48] WORLD.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.
[1:32:53] AND WHILE I'M HERE,
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GET READY.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Make use of your time. AMEN.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, LET'S GO LAY ON A SHADE
[1:33:08] TREE AND LET'S DO THIS AND LET'S DO
[1:33:10] THAT. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. WE'RE BUSY.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WORK. USE
[1:33:15] EVERY BIT OF YOUR ENERGY FOR THE KINGDOM
[1:33:18] OF GOD'S SAKE.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER THIS MEETING?
[1:33:22] WHAT SHOULD I DO TO LISTEN, FIND
[1:33:25] SOMETHING FOR GOD TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR. TALK TO YOUR
[1:33:31] FRIENDS.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:35] BROTHER, I may not WIN NONE OF THEM, BUT
[1:33:38] your life
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; just keep watering.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Keep watering that experience.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; There was something different about her.
[1:33:54] Maybe the first couple of days she
[1:33:56] didn't tell them.
[1:33:58] You know, some things you just want to
[1:33:59] ponder in your heart.
[1:34:03] Some things are just too good to tell.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; They're not going to believe it. No way.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; She got to thinking,
[1:34:19] no doubt,
[1:34:21] in a few months
[1:34:23] and a few days, I won't do this no more.
[1:34:26] Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Now, as a time begin to grow near,
[1:34:38] her expectation begin to build.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; She looked in the mirror.
[1:34:48] She worked on her dress. Maybe she she
[1:34:51] she just did things a certain way to get
[1:34:56] herself prepared because now she's going
[1:34:58] to be a
[1:35:01] queen of the house
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; from bottom servant to the queen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; There's been churches, churches, and
[1:35:16] brides brides.
[1:35:19] Hallelujah.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And she's thinking as she washes those
[1:35:25] filthy dishes maybe the last few days.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about
[1:35:31] that last time.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; You know, there's just SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:35:40] THAT LAST TIME. You guys know something
[1:35:42] about the last day of school.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:35:47] YOU KNOW THAT LAST DAY OF SCHOOL, THE
[1:35:49] TEACHER COULD TELL YOU TO GO TO THE
[1:35:50] MOON.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; She don't have you but just a few more
[1:35:56] hours.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You're free
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; at least for the summer.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You know, THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:36:09] IT
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; AS YOU COME TO THAT SPOT. Few more days.
[1:36:14] Never forget as a boy. Maybe I shouldn't
[1:36:16] confess this.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I'll blame you.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; AS A LITTLE BOY, I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
[1:36:29] LIKE THAT LAST DAY OF school
[1:36:36] to carry a water gun.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; What are they going to do?
[1:36:49] Some little boys never grow up,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; you know, AND I JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
[1:36:57] YOU KNOW, THAT LAST DAY, LAST PERIOD
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE THINKING,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, 45 MORE MINUTES,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; WATER GUN TIME.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; And you know YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
[1:37:17] THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS THINKING IN HER
[1:37:19] LAST MORNING. SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER
[1:37:21] DRESS on
[1:37:23] different today.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; She tied her APRON ON TO COOK BREAKFAST
[1:37:29] THIS MORNING. MAYBE AT 5:00 last time.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; She put the wood IN THE STOVE. LAST time
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; she CRACKED THE EGGS. LAST TIME
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; SHE HEARD THEIR BELLY ACHING. LAST TIME
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; SHE CLEANED THEIR FLOORS AND SHE CLEANED
[1:38:01] THEIR BEDS THE LAST TIME.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND MAYBE AS IT GOT TOWARD
[1:38:09] THE END OF THE DAY, MAYBE THERE WAS SOME
[1:38:11] CHORES
[1:38:12] THAT WERE STILL ON HER LIST, BUT IT'S
[1:38:15] TIME.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; I CAN just Oh, I feel the Lord.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; I CAN JUST SEE HER. SHE PULLS THAT
[1:38:25] LITTLE APRON OFF AND HANGS IT ON THAT
[1:38:27] NAIL LAST TIME.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; SATAN TRIES TO DESTROY YOU. ONE OF THESE
[1:38:37] DAYS HE'LL DO IT THE LAST TIME.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. I'M JUST A
[1:39:01] PASSING THROUGH.
[1:39:05] SHE WAS UNDER SUCH ANTICIPATION, SUCH
[1:39:08] EXPECTATION. SHE DID HER HER HAIR A
[1:39:10] CERTAIN WAY. SHE DID HER DRESS A CERTAIN
[1:39:14] WAY. SHE WALKED OUT OF THAT BEDROOM THE
[1:39:16] LAST TIME.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; SHE WALKED OUT ACROSS THAT PORCH. LAST
[1:39:23] TIME,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; SHE LISTENED AS THOSE GIRLS STOOD THERE
[1:39:28] ON THAT PORCH AND LAUGHED AT HER.
[1:39:33] AND SHE STOOD THERE UNDER THEIR
[1:39:35] PERSECUTION.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I CAN ONLY HEAR HER IN HER IN HER
[1:39:40] PONDERING HEART.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; DO YOUR BEST.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; DO YOUR BEST.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:50] AMEN.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; As I got sick this afternoon, I told the
[1:39:54] devil on MY KNEES, I SAID, "TRY YOUR
[1:39:57] BEST
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; CUZ GREATER IS HATE than
[1:40:03] that one."
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, BUT I FEEL SO
[1:40:14] ALONE." DO YOU THINK BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:40:16] DIDN'T FEEL ALONE?
[1:40:19] YES, SIR.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE STEPPED TO THE PULL PIT KNOWING
[1:40:21] 10,000 OF HIS FRIENDS IS GOING TO LEAVE
[1:40:23] HIM. WHEN HE PREACHES SERPENT SHADE,
[1:40:26] WHEN HE PREACHES LYING AGAINST
[1:40:28] DENOMINATIONALISM,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE PREACHES SATAN'S EATING,
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; SOULS NOW IN PRISON,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; THE DEEPER THE WORD, THE MORE FRIENDS
[1:40:41] TRICKLING OFF,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; THE MORE THE MURMURING WENT ON BEHIND
[1:40:46] THEM.
[1:40:47] BUT THEY'RE GREATER.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; THE GREATER THE INSPIRATION.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, BUT MY BATTLE'S
[1:40:58] GETTING HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER."
[1:41:01] THAT'S GREAT.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WONDERFUL.
[1:41:10] BECAUSE AS THAT DARKNESS CONGEALS
[1:41:12] TOGETHER, IT IS ANNOUNCING THERE'S A NEW
[1:41:14] DAY GETTING READY TO APPROACH.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT LIGHT AS
[1:41:23] IT'S COMING
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; PRESSES THAT DARKNESS TOGETHER,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; WHO'S GOING TO FILL THE DARKNESS? THAT
[1:41:32] WHICH IS THE CLOSEST TO IT.
[1:41:38] THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And you are the last line of defense.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; You stand like a mighty
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and death comes right up to you.
[1:41:52] comes right against you and you feel
[1:41:55] it's cold clammy hands trying to destroy
[1:41:58] your prayer LIFE TRYING TO DESTROY YOU
[1:42:00] GOING TO CHURCH TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR
[1:42:03] FAMILY
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO STEAL YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF
[1:42:07] YOUR HOME
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT IN THE WORLD YOU
[1:42:11] APPLIED THE TOKEN
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD OF GOD YOU HAVE A covenant
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; you SAY OH BROTHER RON WHAT CAN I DO I'M
[1:42:21] JUST I'M A MERE MORTAL BEING. I GOT NEWS
[1:42:23] FOR YOU. YOU'RE A SON AND YOU'RE A
[1:42:26] DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; She stood there at that gate.
[1:42:40] She stood there, listen, WITH NOT A
[1:42:44] SPECK OF DOUBT.
[1:42:51] I think I better go back in and take
[1:42:53] these clothes off.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You may have to stand alone like she
[1:43:04] did.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You may have to stand like Caleb did.
[1:43:08] What in the world are you guys thinking?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; We have been caught for this.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And when I went over there,
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; I saw a mountain.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; MY NAME PROCLAIMS THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO
[1:43:29] BE POSSESSORS OF THAT MOUNTAIN.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; THIS WORD SAYS THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
[1:43:36] A CHARACTER THAT RESEMBLES JESUS CHRIST.
[1:43:39] AND IT'S A PERFECT REFLECTION.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD SAYS THAT ABOUT ME. LISTEN,
[1:43:44] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:43:47] WILL GO WITH ME AND DRIVE OUT THE ENEMY
[1:43:50] AND BE LIKE A HORNET. AND YES, THERE'S
[1:43:52] ENEMIES THERE, BUT WHEN I GET THERE,
[1:43:55] HE'LL DRIVE THEM OUT.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; WHOSE HANDS IS HE GOING TO USE? THESE
[1:44:03] HANDS.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; WHOSE FEET IS HE GOING TO USE? THESE
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; THINGS.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; WHO YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; YOU YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; OH, Brother Ron, but we we sat around
[1:44:20] this message a long time. Yeah.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE GOING TO BELIEVE IT
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS.
[1:44:36] Many years ago when I was first born
[1:44:39] again,
[1:44:41] first saved,
[1:44:44] we say it like that anyway.
[1:44:47] I went to a camp meeting much like this.
[1:44:51] I was sitting in your place.
[1:44:55] Your pastor
[1:44:57] STOOD TO HIS FEET THAT night
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; and begin to preach,
[1:45:03] let us run.
[1:45:07] Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; And he BEGAN TO GO DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:45:11] patriarchs
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; of the ages
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; and be TO TELL ALL OF THOSE MEN WHAT
[1:45:21] THEY DID
[1:45:23] AND WHAT THEY POSSESSED OF THEIR LAND.
[1:45:27] AND THEN I FELT THE PERSONAL challenge
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; at THE END OF THAT SERMON. IT'S NOW OUR
[1:45:36] TURN TO RUN.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T RUN BECAUSE THEIR RACE IS
[1:45:43] OVER.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; NOW IT'S OUR TURN
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; TO RUN.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; SITTING IN THAT POSITION THERE.
[1:45:53] SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY 5'5. I DON'T HAVE THE
[1:46:00] EDUCATION. MAYBE MANY OF YOU HAVE, BUT
[1:46:03] SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; WE'RE BUILT TO LIVE IN THIS PLACE.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; WE'RE A SUPER RACE, A SUPER CHURCH.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I've heard those quotes A
[1:46:19] MILLION TIMES. ONE MORE TIME.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS JUST BROTHER
[1:46:24] BRANDHAM WITH HIS EDUCATION JUST
[1:46:27] TWIRLING A FEW WORDS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL
[1:46:30] GOOD.
[1:46:32] I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FORECAST OF THE
[1:46:35] POTENTIAL OF THE MIND OF GOD OF WHAT HE
[1:46:38] HAD IN HIS MIND.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT JOSHUA'S BURDEN
[1:46:43] WAS THAT THE PEOPLE AS THEY WERE
[1:46:46] STANDING THERE THAT THEY NOT ONLY HEAR
[1:46:48] THE MESSAGE BUT THEY BECOME THE MESSAGE.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING THERE TONIGHT
[1:47:00] AND WE'LL START OUT WITH THIS VERY
[1:47:02] simple text. BUT MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING
[1:47:05] THERE TONIGHT AND YOU'RE WHERE I WAS IN
[1:47:07] 1983
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; and YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, BUT I FEEL SO
[1:47:11] INSIGNIFICANT.
[1:47:14] I FEEL LIKE I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T DO
[1:47:16] ANYTHING." LISTEN, you may NOT BE A
[1:47:19] PREACHER. YOU MAY NOT BE A SINGER,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; but God's strategy
[1:47:29] is to take an empty human vessel.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; An empty human vessel.
[1:47:44] So that means there's some emptying out
[1:47:46] we've got to do.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; There's some opinions and some thoughts
[1:47:52] and
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; some things we NEED TO GET RID OF.
[1:47:57] SHAKE THOSE THINGS AWAY FROM US.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD FILLS IT WITH THE HOLY
[1:48:03] GHOST,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE LIFE OF GOD.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT 10 MILLION MILES AWAY.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO LIVE AT THE CONTROL TOWER
[1:48:18] OF YOUR HEART,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER.
[1:48:28] SAY, "OH, Brother Ron, but Brother
[1:48:29] Biscll says this and you say this and
[1:48:31] Brother John SAYS THAT." BUT WHAT DO YOU
[1:48:34] SAY WITH THE WORD?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You take the word and cut the enemy's
[1:48:40] head off.
[1:48:47] Fill that vessel with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; which is the VERY LIFE OF GOD,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; THE VERY ZOEY of God, the very mind of
[1:48:56] God
[1:48:58] and then shake the world with it.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; What world you talking about, brother
[1:49:04] Ron? Your world.
[1:49:10] where you go to school.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You're home.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; I've had ministers call me and say,
[1:49:21] "What did you do to those young people
[1:49:23] in Louisiana? You worked them up." I
[1:49:26] said, "What happened?" They come home
[1:49:28] and tried to start a revival in our
[1:49:30] church.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; I said, "GOOD.
[1:49:37] I PRAY THAT THEY START A REVIVAL IN
[1:49:39] THEIR HOMES.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; CUZ IF THAT REVIVAL STARTS IN THE HOME,
[1:49:47] IT'LL START IN THE CHURCH.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He said, "OH
[1:49:57] MY, LET'S GO." I'M FEELING ALMOST TOO
[1:49:58] GOOD NOW. HE SAID, "ALMIGHT, LET'S GO
[1:50:00] FORWARD. IF WE ONLY PREACH THE THE
[1:50:04] CHURCH JUSTIFICATION, LET'S TAKE THEM A
[1:50:07] LITTLE FURTHER THAN WE THAN THAT. NOW,
[1:50:09] HE SAYS, "GO A LITTLE HIGHER AND IF WE
[1:50:11] CAN GET INTO THAT, GOD BEGINS TO FILL
[1:50:13] WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT." AND HE SAID,
[1:50:15] "THEN LET'S GO INTO DIVINE HEALING AND
[1:50:17] LET'S SEARCH THAT OUT." HE SAID, "THE
[1:50:19] HOLY GHOST IS LIKE A GREAT BIG APARTMENT
[1:50:22] STORE." HE SAID, "THE PEOPLE THAT'S
[1:50:24] BECOME CHRISTIANS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY
[1:50:27] OWN." COULD
[1:50:29] YOU IMAGINE ME BUYING A HOUSE WITHOUT
[1:50:31] LOOKING IT OVER FIRST? COULD HE SAYS HE
[1:50:34] SAYS COULD YOU IMAGINE ME OWNING A PLACE
[1:50:36] LIKE SOMEBODY GIVE ME A GREAT BIG ARCADE
[1:50:39] AND HE SAID GREAT BIG PLACE WHERE
[1:50:40] EVERYTHING HE SAYS JUST EVERYWHERE. HE
[1:50:43] SAID IT'S ALL MINE.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID WELL THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WHEN
[1:50:48] YOU BECOME TO CHRIST EVERYTHING. YEAH.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING BELONGS TO YOU.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; You guys are just you you just say it in
[1:51:09] a certain way. We're sons of God.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; We're daughters of God. Amen.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; The other day when the doctor walked in
[1:51:20] and looked at me and he put his feet on
[1:51:22] the floor up on my bed and he put his
[1:51:24] hands behind my head.
[1:51:27] He said, "You know, this room," he said,
[1:51:29] "generally goes because it was a nice
[1:51:32] room that overlooked the city." He said,
[1:51:34] "Generally, they save this room for kind
[1:51:36] of the celebrities of the city.
[1:51:50] And he said, "Uh, how did you get this
[1:51:52] wrong?" I said, "Because of who I am."
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ask for it?" And I
[1:52:07] said, "No, I didn't ask for it.
[1:52:11] He said, "Uh,
[1:52:13] why are you saying that?" I said,
[1:52:14] "Because of who I am." He said, "Well,
[1:52:17] who are you?"
[1:52:20] I said, "I AM A SON OF GOD."
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; And I may not LOOK LIKE IT LAYING HERE,
[1:52:29] BUT I'M A SON OF GOD.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWNS BELONGS
[1:52:36] TO ME.
[1:52:39] HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; We're his kids.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HIS KIDS. LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:52:50] TO WALK INTO THAT ARCADE STORE AND JUST
[1:52:52] STAND IN THE LOBBY. IT'S ALL YOURS.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID, "IF SOMETHING'S TOO HIGH
[1:52:58] FOR YOU, GET A LADDER, CLIMB UP, LOOK
[1:53:01] WHAT'S ON THE TOP OF THE SHELF.
[1:53:10] Never let yourself come to a stage of
[1:53:12] satisfaction.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Let me just read one more quote about
[1:53:16] yourself.
[1:53:18] You like to hear about yourself.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; You know, I like to hear about Joshua,
[1:53:24] but I like to hear about me.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I'm a little bit selfish, Brother Tom.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I like to hear about you.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like to see you believe it about
[1:53:35] you.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; That's what JOSHUA'S BURDEN WAS. HE
[1:53:38] WANTED TO SEE THE PEOPLE BELIEVE IT.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; NOW, understand very clearly, and we'll
[1:53:43] get to this a little bit later, maybe
[1:53:45] tomorrow, but Joshua COULDN'T GO DO THE
[1:53:47] FIGHTING for them.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; So, it had to be anchored in their
[1:53:52] hearts.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't do it for you.
[1:53:56] Yes,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; you have to take the message
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; and believe it for yourself.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "All right, here is what I'm
[1:54:13] trying to say to you.
[1:54:15] Law of reproduction
[1:54:17] brings forth of its kind.
[1:54:21] These last days, the true church bride
[1:54:24] comes to the headstone.
[1:54:27] Will be the super church, a super race.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Just like you've never heard it before.
[1:54:37] I believe he's talking about you.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Is this working?
[1:54:57] TDJs can say something in the denom in
[1:55:00] the denominational world.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; And tell them something that pumps them
[1:55:04] up and they shout for a half an hour.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; No reality to it.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; John Haggy AND I'M I'M RESPECTFUL OF
[1:55:16] THESE MEN. JOHN HAGEN CAN SAY SOMETHING
[1:55:18] AND THEY APPLAUD FOR 10 MINUTES.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; BILL CLINTON, AS ROTTEN AS HE IS, IS ONE
[1:55:26] OF THE MOST HIGHEST PAID SPEAKERS THERE
[1:55:28] IS IN THE WORLD.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE SIT WITH ATOMIC WORTH.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY SAID IT.
[1:55:47] ED BISCLL DIDN'T SAY THIS.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; RON SPENCER DIDN'T SAY THIS.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,
[1:55:55] THIS WASN'T EVEN WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S
[1:55:57] THOUGHTS.
[1:56:21] YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER RON, HOW SURE IS
[1:56:23] THAT?"
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; I MADE THIS QUOTATION. IT'S GOOD FOR
[1:56:25] TONIGHT. IF GOD WOULD HAVE WANTED THE
[1:56:28] MOON TO HAVE BEEN GREEN CHEESE WHEN NEIL
[1:56:30] ARMSTRONG LANDED ON THE MOON, HE WOULD
[1:56:33] HAVE LANDED AND WOULD HAVE PUT HIS FOOT
[1:56:35] ALL THE WAY TO HIS KNEE IN GREEN CHEESE.
[1:56:39] IF HE'D HAVE WANTED A HORSE TO HAVE TWO
[1:56:41] HEADS ON IT, THAT HORSE THAT I'VE GOT IN
[1:56:44] MY LAWN OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE A
[1:56:46] HEAD ON THIS END AND A HEAD ON THIS END.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; IF HE WANTED A CAMEL TO HAVE 42 HUMPS ON
[1:56:53] IT, IT HAVE 42 HUMPS ON IT.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF HE WANTED A CARIBOU TO HAVE A
[1:57:00] 42IN HORN,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT CARIBOU
[1:57:15] AND IF GOD WANTS YOU TO BE A SUPER
[1:57:18] CHURCH,
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:57:32] Thank you.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, THE PENTECOSTALS COULDN'T HANDLE
[1:57:41] THIS.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; This is not FOR THE METHODISTS. THIS IS
[1:57:44] NOT FOR THE BAPTIST.
[1:57:47] AND I'M SORRY THIS IS NOT FOR A LOT OF
[1:57:49] MESSAGE people
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; but this IS FOR THE CALEB AND THE Joshua
[1:57:55] of the message OF
[1:58:02] OH BROTHER I SEE A MESS. I SEE THIS AND
[1:58:04] I SEE THAT. LISTEN I CAN'T SEE NOTHING
[1:58:06] BUT A SUPER RICH A SUPER CHURCH. A CRY
[1:58:12] MING HERSELF.
[1:58:20] HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; He said as they near that great
[1:58:26] headstone, THEY WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE
[1:58:30] HIM.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Even they will be in HIS VERY IMAGE IN
[1:58:34] ORDER TO BE UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL
[1:58:37] BE WHAT?
[1:58:41] THEY WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION
[1:58:44] OF THE WORD OF the living God.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; DENOMINATIONS CAN NEVER
[1:58:52] CAN NEVER CAN NEVER
[1:58:56] produce this.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE SAID YOU'LL BE BONE OF HIS
[1:59:01] BONE, LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS
[1:59:04] POWER, SPIRIT OF HIS SPIRIT.
[1:59:07] THAT'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE BRIDE OF
[1:59:09] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; ONE IN THE BED, ONE AT THE MEAL. ARE YOU
[1:59:14] WITH ME?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; GORD.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID DENOMINATIONS. HE SAID THEY WILL
[1:59:24] PRODUCE CREEDS, ENDOLMENTS MIXED WITH
[1:59:26] THE WORD. IT BRINGS FORTH A HYBRID
[1:59:28] PRODUCT. HE SAID THE FIRST SON WAS THE
[1:59:31] SPOKEN SEA WORD OF GOD AND IT HAS IT WAS
[1:59:34] GIVEN A BRIDE.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE SAID I'M JUST REVIEWING THE
[1:59:38] SPIRIT. HE SAID I WAS SPEAKING UP WHAT I
[1:59:40] SAID. HE SAID A BRIDE PRODUCED TO
[1:59:44] PRODUCE HIMSELF.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; SHE FELL AND THAT'S WHAT THE BRIDE WAS
[1:59:48] GIVEN TO PRODUCE HIMSELF. AGAIN ANOTHER
[1:59:52] SON OF GOD BUT SHE FELL BY HYPEREATING.
[1:59:55] PRODUCED HIMSELF BUT SHE FELL CAUSED HIM
[1:59:58] TO DIE. THE SECOND SON, a spoken seed
[2:00:04] word of God,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; WAS GIVEN A BRIDE LIKE ADAM.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE COULD MARRY HER, SHE HAD
[2:00:13] FALLEN ALSO.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; FOR SHE WAS PUT TO FREE MORAL AGENCY
[2:00:18] LIKE ADAM'S WIFE WAS TO BELIEVE GOD'S
[2:00:20] WORD AND TO LIVE OR DOUBT IT AND DIE.
[2:00:23] AND SHE DID. RIGHT.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEN FROM a little group
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; of the true seed of the word,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST,
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; A BELOVED BRIDE,
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; A VIRGIN, A VIRGIN OF HIS WORD,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THEM AND BY THEM WILL BE
[2:00:49] FULFILLED ALL THAT HAS BEEN PROMISED FOR
[2:00:52] HIS WORD. THE VIRGIN WHO KNOWS NO NO NO
[2:00:55] MAN-MADE CRAVES OR DOGMAS.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; SHE KEEPS HERSELF FOCUSED.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT
[2:01:04] WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE MANIFEST
[2:01:07] WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WORD OF
[2:01:10] PROMISE. SO TO FULFILL ALL THAT HAS BEEN
[2:01:13] WRITTEN OF HIM. AND AS HE DID WHEN HE
[2:01:16] CAME FROM THE VIRGIN WOMB, TYPE OF TYPE
[2:01:19] OF THE SPIRIT WOMB NOW SO WILL THE
[2:01:21] VIRGIN ACCEPTING HIS word be it UNTO ME
[2:01:25] AS THOU HAS SAID THOUGH IT WAS SAID BY
[2:01:28] AN ANGEL YET IT WAS WRITTEN WITH A
[2:01:31] WRITTEN WORD ISAIAH 96 THEY WILL LOVE
[2:01:34] HIM.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT THEY BROTHER RON? THEY'RE
[2:01:39] HERE,
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. BUT I SO WANT THE HOLY GHOST. I
[2:01:46] SO NEED THIS AND I SO NEED THAT. LISTEN,
[2:01:49] OUR LORD JESUS WAS IN THIS BUILDING
[2:01:51] BEFORE YOU WAS.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO WORSHIP TONIGHT BEFORE YOU
[2:01:58] EVEN ARRIVED.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG GOD FOR SOMETHING.
[2:02:03] HE'S HERE TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
[2:02:07] YOU'RE HIS WIFE
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; SAID THEY WILL LOVE HIM
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; AND WILL HAVE HIS POTENTIALS FOR HE IS
[2:02:20] THEIR HEAD AND THEY ARE HIS SUBJECTS
[2:02:23] SUBJECT TO THE HEAD HIS HEADSHIP OF
[2:02:26] CHRIST THAT WAS HIS
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; notice
[2:02:30] he said what harmony
[2:02:33] Jesus never did anything until he seen
[2:02:36] the father or the father showed him
[2:02:39] first.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother Ron, that's a long quote,
[2:02:42] but I'm reading about you."
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; John 5:19.
[2:02:51] He said, "So will the bride."
[2:02:54] And he shows her his word of life.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; He shows her.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; SHE RECEIVES IT.
[2:03:06] SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S SHE DOING AT THE END OF THE
[2:03:13] FENCE? SHE'S NOT DOUBTING IT.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE TONIGHT? YOU'RE
[2:03:18] NOT DOUBTING IT.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. HE SAID NOTHING CAN
[2:03:30] HARM HER. AMEN.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN DEATH.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; FOR IF THE SEED BE PLANTED, THE WATER
[2:03:38] WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "HERE IS THE SECRET. THE WORD
[2:03:43] IS IN the bride."
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; THE WORD WAS SO PLANTED IN CALEB,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; SO ANCHORED IN HIM. HE HAD HEARD IT. HE
[2:03:54] HAD HEARD IT. HE HAD HEARD IT. AND HE
[2:03:57] BELIEVED IT. HE RECEIVED IT.
[2:04:03] AND WHEN HE WENT ACROSS THERE, THERE WAS
[2:04:05] NO WAY HE COULD COME BACK WITH AN EVIL
[2:04:07] REPORT.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN MISS THE RAPTURE.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; No way.
[2:04:25] You say, "BROTHER RON, I'M SO AFRAID I'M
[2:04:27] GOING TO MISS IT." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[2:04:29] THE RAPTURE IS IN ME.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; IT IS IN PROCESS EVEN AS WE SPEAK NOW.
[2:04:37] CHANGING THIS BODY.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; One of THESE MORNINGS WE'LL GET THAT
[2:04:45] LAST CHANGE and we'll GO MEET OUR LORD
[2:04:48] IN THE AIR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BELIEVERS
[2:04:51] BELIEVE.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; She stood there and heard it in her
[2:04:59] ears.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Let them say what they want to say about
[2:05:06] my dress.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT
[2:05:11] MY HAIR.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT
[2:05:16] MY BRIDEGROOM.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT
[2:05:21] MY CHURCH AND MY PASTOR.
[2:05:26] GOT A FEW MORE MINUTES.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; In a few more minutes,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; you won't have nobody to pick on.
[2:06:07] I'm going to finish with this tonight.
[2:06:09] I'm going quit.
[2:06:13] Can you imagine
[2:06:19] before even time you start assembling an
[2:06:21] army of demons,
[2:06:26] you're cast into the earth.
[2:06:29] You spend 6,000 years banding and
[2:06:33] training and
[2:06:36] talking about warfare and positioning.
[2:06:41] anchoring against the bride.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Stay right there.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE SEALS ARE RELEASED AND YOU
[2:06:54] GET 200,000 MORE
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; AT your disposal.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; LOOSE FROM THE RIVER EUPHRATES.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; AND ALL HELL
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; IS TURNED AGAINST THAT GROUND.
[2:07:11] DO YOU REALIZE HOW TERRIFIED
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; HE IS of you?
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; MEN STAND 7 FOOT TALL, DRIBBLE A BALL,
[2:07:36] PUT IN A BASKET.
[2:07:38] Come on.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; MEN LIFT WEIGHTS A,000 LBS OVER THEIR
[2:07:44] HEAD.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; That don't scare the devil.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; MEN HAVE 20 YEARS OF EDUCATION.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; CONFOUND THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND CAN'T
[2:07:57] FIND THEIR WAY ACROSS THE STREET.
[2:08:02] EINSTEIN GOT TOTALLY LOST ONE DAY AND HE
[2:08:05] CALLED HIS SECRETARY AND HE SAID, "CAN
[2:08:07] YOU TELL ME WHERE MR. EINSTEIN LIVES?"
[2:08:10] SHE SAID, "I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT
[2:08:11] INFORMATION." HE SAID, "THIS IS HIM."
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT DON'T SCARE THE DEVIL.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT SCARES THE
[2:08:20] DEVIL.
[2:08:23] I GOT THIS TRUCK.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THIS LITTLE GUY RIGHT HERE
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; is armed
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; WITH ATOMIC POWER.
[2:08:54] AND HE KNOWS THAT JUST ANYTIME HE COULD
[2:08:57] DROP A BOTTLE.
[2:09:22] How tall are you?
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Short.
[2:09:31] Shaquille O'Neal was not intimidated by
[2:09:33] him. That's right.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; His physique.
[2:09:39] The great weightlifterss of the world
[2:09:42] pick them up and carry him around.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; But the classiest demons of hell
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; watch him when his little eyelids go
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; AND THEY GO, "HE'S AWAKE.
[2:10:24] HE GO MAY GO DOWN THE HALL AND he starts
[2:10:26] singing, "This is the day.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; This is the day
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; that the Lord has made."
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; That the Lord has made.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I get excited.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; We shall rejoice.
[2:10:43] We shall rejoice and be glad in it.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; And be glad in it.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is a day that the Lord has
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; and demons in another dimension start
[2:10:56] shaking.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; WHY, BROTHER RON? HE HAS AUTHORITY.
[2:11:07] THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE HAS ATOMIC
[2:11:09] POWER.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Right in his vocal cords.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're nuts. I got kids in
[2:11:23] the kindergarten
[2:11:25] that stand up and says a teacher one day
[2:11:28] as says
[2:11:30] he said he said uh he he asked him some
[2:11:33] question like DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST
[2:11:35] SIN WAS? HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES.
[2:11:42] He said it was sex.
[2:11:48] NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.
[2:11:56] LISTEN, THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
[2:11:58] TILL THEY GET OLD.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ANCHORED IN
[2:12:02] THEIR HEARTS.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIS AGE
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; TO FULL MATURITY.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; I know it's unfair. You won't get your
[2:12:16] driver's license, but you won't need it.
[2:12:27] MY BROTHER
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Satan scared to death. That little guy.
[2:12:51] laying inside of him's potential.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that'll make him strut.
[2:12:58] He's something special. He is.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; He is something special.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; So are you.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; So are you.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; SO ARE YOU.
[2:13:18] HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; THEY LOVE HIM
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; FOR THEY HAVE HIS POTENTIAL.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; THEY receive it.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; And they never
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; NEVER
[2:13:29] NEVER
[2:13:31] DOUBT IT.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Never doubt it.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight.
[2:13:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:14:02] Heat.
[2:14:14] Heat.

[2:14:56] voice. We give you praise. WE GIVE YOU
[2:15:00] THANKSGIVING. OH GOD, THE DEVIL IS
[2:15:03] CERTAINLY DEFEATED, LORD. And you are

[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; We want to give you thanksgiving
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; for the things that we have heard.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; How glorious they are.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; How marvelous to our ears.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; MORE THAN WE CAN EXPRESS. Oh God, our
[2:16:06] words, our lips. So we would say to the
[2:16:08] songwriter, oh for a THOUSAND TONGUES
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT now to sing your praise.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God, the angels cannot enjoy what we
[2:16:20] are enjoying now.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; The lost cannot enjoy it.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Your children do.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for strengthening
[2:16:28] brother Ron Spencer.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; We thank you for strengthening.
[2:16:34] We thank you for your healing.
[2:16:36] We give you praise for him.
[2:16:49] Oh God,
[2:16:55] you made a provision even for this
[2:16:56] service.
[2:16:58] Lord, when you allow the Roman cruel
[2:17:01] scourge to come across the body of our
[2:17:04] Lord Jesus Christ, you are laying
[2:17:06] healing power,
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; making it available to us, making it
[2:17:10] available to our brother Ron tonight.
[2:17:12] Lord, making it available to every sick
[2:17:15] and afflicted person that might be in
[2:17:17] this audience in the name of Jesus
[2:17:19] Christ. Satan, you are defeated. You by
[2:17:22] his stripes we are healed.
[2:17:30] Lord, we pray that you will just guide
[2:17:31] us
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; and we'll be sensitive to your voice.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:17:38] Let's say tonight, thank you, Lord
[2:17:40] Jesus.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; We freely clap our hands. Make sure when
[2:17:48] you clap your hands, you also open your
[2:17:50] mouth
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:56] We open our mouth and we praise your
[2:17:58] name.
[2:18:01] Glory,
[2:18:02] glory, glory, glory, glory.
[2:18:08] Amen.
[2:18:16] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:18:24] May it be that this area, Birch Bay,
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Bellingham, and Blaine and all this
[2:18:29] area, may it be they've never heard a
[2:18:31] sound like will come from this
[2:18:33] campground.
[2:18:37] Brother Ron spoke to the young people
[2:18:39] this morning and brother Tom felt led to
[2:18:43] do that because uh
[2:18:49] said it gives the minister an
[2:18:51] opportunity and gives the people an
[2:18:53] opportunity to just become a little bit
[2:18:57] more acquainted. Brother Ron, I invited
[2:19:00] him to come up and his wife Sister
[2:19:02] Connie who's here. We're so happy
[2:19:04] they're both able to be here. Hard for
[2:19:07] her mother, especially to leave the
[2:19:09] family and leave the children. Uh this
[2:19:12] is the second trip in just a short time.
[2:19:15] Uh but our brother Ron was speaking to
[2:19:18] the young people and he told them this
[2:19:20] morning, I thought I just he can relate
[2:19:23] it a lot better than I can, but I
[2:19:25] thought it was appropriate just now
[2:19:28] while you're standing.
[2:19:30] He was in the hospital and he entered
[2:19:32] into prayer.
[2:19:36] He couldn't have any light on because
[2:19:38] his his body and the eyes and everything
[2:19:40] was light sensitive
[2:19:42] because of the stroke and what he had
[2:19:44] experienced. And so the room was dark
[2:19:48] and the nurses had to when they came in
[2:19:50] the room just had a little light to do
[2:19:53] their duties.
[2:19:55] and a new nurse came in that hadn't been
[2:19:58] there and she was new I believe with the
[2:20:01] hospital but anyway she came into the
[2:20:04] room but he had just been praying and a
[2:20:06] presence
[2:20:08] I have a reason to say this a presence
[2:20:10] just came into that room prior to the
[2:20:13] nurse entering and when she came in she
[2:20:17] began to speak to him and asked him
[2:20:20] about
[2:20:22] he his prayer about him praying praying
[2:20:25] and what had happened. And she said that
[2:20:29] what he had she wanted.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; And she knelt at his bed in the
[2:20:36] darkness. He began to hear her before
[2:20:39] before she began to talk to him. He
[2:20:41] heard her begin to sniffle.
[2:20:44] And and then she was already under the
[2:20:48] effect
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; of that presence.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; She didn't know who it was. She didn't
[2:20:53] know what this man was.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Knew a little bit about him, but before
[2:20:58] a few minutes, she's on her knees.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said something in the
[2:21:03] in the message, his last message to the
[2:21:05] world. And I will say it was the Lord
[2:21:08] Jesus Christ giving us, you
[2:21:13] are people of books. You study, you've
[2:21:17] come home. I've seen some of you walking
[2:21:19] on the street. You have sackloads of
[2:21:22] books. You've studied them. You've been
[2:21:24] diligent. And I don't want to shame you,
[2:21:27] but you've been more diligent with those
[2:21:29] books than you've been with the message.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; And that ought not to be.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; You ought to, if you can pack school
[2:21:37] books around, you ought to be able to
[2:21:39] pack message books around. You can pack
[2:21:41] those books around, you ought to pack
[2:21:43] your Bible around. One's got eternal
[2:21:46] life and the other one will only stand
[2:21:47] you good for a little while in this
[2:21:49] life.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; And when this life's over, what you
[2:21:52] learned in those books will do you no
[2:21:54] good at all. But what you learned in the
[2:21:56] books that God sent will give you will
[2:21:59] give you a good standing on the other
[2:22:01] side.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; And that message
[2:22:06] leadership he said every person you are
[2:22:10] led. There isn't one of you standing
[2:22:13] here, young or old, that is not being
[2:22:16] led. You're being led by something and
[2:22:19] by somebody.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; So, we just settled that you are being
[2:22:25] led.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; But he made a strange statement. I
[2:22:29] thought I would be preaching on it and I
[2:22:31] might yet, but I I I believe that it's
[2:22:34] in order at the closing of this service
[2:22:40] when the young rich ruler came running
[2:22:44] to Jesus
[2:22:47] and he said, "Good master, what must I
[2:22:50] do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus
[2:22:53] told him finally what to do. And he
[2:22:56] said, "This is a hard saying. He
[2:22:57] couldn't do it." and he walked away sad
[2:23:01] because he couldn't sell all that he had
[2:23:03] and give it to the poor. Brother Brandon
[2:23:06] makes this very strange statement. He
[2:23:08] said he was confronted with
[2:23:12] eternal life. He come running to a man.
[2:23:15] He thought it was a man. He thought I
[2:23:17] this is Jesus of Nazareth. This is a
[2:23:19] man. They call him a prophet. I'm going
[2:23:21] to go and hear what he says.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; But a prophet now in this day said he
[2:23:25] wasn't confronted with a man.
[2:23:27] He didn't say he was confronted with a
[2:23:29] man.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. He was confronted with
[2:23:32] Jesus.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in him was life.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; And this man was confronted with eternal
[2:23:40] life.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Here it is. You came. Oh yeah.
[2:23:47] This Cloverdale Bible way camp. Oh, we
[2:23:49] have it every year. Some of you have
[2:23:52] been here year after year after year.
[2:23:53] We've come to this camp.
[2:23:56] We have a new speaker,
[2:23:58] a brother Spencer. He hasn't come here
[2:24:00] before.
[2:24:02] We have him this year. And you you came
[2:24:05] and you say, "Well, I
[2:24:07] you don't call this a confrontation."
[2:24:11] Confrontations, we don't like
[2:24:12] confrontations, but some of them are
[2:24:14] necessary.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Some of them are necessary.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a confrontation is necessary
[2:24:21] when the truth needs to be spoken and
[2:24:23] established.
[2:24:27] You didn't expect to be confronted,
[2:24:30] but you said this, Brother Ron Spencer.
[2:24:34] Well, I'll just tell you, just beneath
[2:24:35] that skin
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ came and just used him
[2:24:44] tonight
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; and came right to your face
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; and confronted you with eternal life.
[2:24:50] And you're standing here right now
[2:24:52] deciding what you're going to do with
[2:24:55] Jesus Christ.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; That's what happened tonight.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And the rest of this congregation ought
[2:25:04] to give me 110% support.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; That's what happened with your young
[2:25:10] people.
[2:25:16] And for SOME OF YOU, FOR SOME OF YOU,
[2:25:20] this is a very critical moment.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Ron Spencer. It's not
[2:25:29] brother Tom Ray. It's not brother Ed
[2:25:32] Biscll. It's not YOUR PASTOR. IT'S NOT
[2:25:35] THAT. GOD CAME.
[2:25:39] JESUS CHRIST
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; THROUGH MAN AND HAS CONFRONTED YOU WITH
[2:25:44] ETERNAL LIFE. AND YOUR PROPHET SAID HE
[2:25:47] WAS CONFRONTED WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND HE
[2:25:51] TURNED ETERNAL LIFE DOWN.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. That's right.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Tonight, I'm smitten
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; at the very prospects
[2:26:05] that anybody could turn Jesus Christ
[2:26:09] down.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; THAT ANYBODY COULD LOOK AT eternal life.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; IN HIM WAS LIFE.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST JESUS OF
[2:26:20] NAZARETH,
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:26:24] AND FOR some riches and for some and
[2:26:27] what what what is your excuse?
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOURS?
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; SOME FRIEND SO-CALLED, SOME LITTLE HABIT
[2:26:36] YOU HAVE, SOME DESIRE YOU HAVE, SOME
[2:26:38] LUST YOU HAVE, SOME STRONG DESIRE YOU
[2:26:40] HAVE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN DOWN
[2:26:42] ETERNAL LIFE FOR THAT. WELL, I GOT SOME
[2:26:45] CHIP ON MY SHOULDER. I SAY SHAME on you.
[2:26:49] And with THIS KIND OF SUPPORT AND THIS
[2:26:51] KIND OF LOVE AND THIS KIND OF PREVAILING
[2:26:54] IN FACT IS I'M GOING TO DROP ANOTHER
[2:26:55] BOMB. I'm not EVEN GOING TO INVITE YOU.
[2:26:59] If you want it bad enough, you plow
[2:27:02] through ALL OF YOUR ALL of your context
[2:27:06] in your mind. You plow through it
[2:27:08] because THIS JESUS ALSO SAID YOU CAN'T
[2:27:11] EVEN COME UNLESS THE HOLY GHOST draws
[2:27:14] you.
[2:27:18] AND YOU GOT TO DECIDE NOW.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO DECIDE WHILE YOU'RE STANDING
[2:27:23] HERE. THIS IS GOD CALLING ME.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; AND IF IT'S NOT GOD CALLING YOU, I
[2:27:29] WOULDN'T WANT YOU RESPONDING. I WOULDN'T
[2:27:31] WANT YOU STANDING HERE. I WOULDN'T EVEN
[2:27:33] WANT necessarily for you to RAISE YOUR
[2:27:34] HAND. UNLESS YOU HAVE A DESPERATION IN
[2:27:36] YOUR HEART, SAY, "OH, GOD, SPEAK TO ME.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Call me.
[2:27:42] Let me hear your voice so I can respond.
[2:27:47] We're not trying to win any medals. We
[2:27:50] don't need numbers. WE NEED THOSE THAT
[2:27:52] GOD HAS CALLED, THAT GOD IS TALKING TO,
[2:27:56] THAT JESUS CONFRONTED TONIGHT. AND IF HE
[2:27:58] HAS CONFRONTED TO YOU, IF HE'S
[2:28:00] CONFRONTED YOU, I SAY BY ALL MEANS COME,
[2:28:04] BY ALL MEANS GIVE YOURSELF. THE APOSTLE
[2:28:07] PAUL SAID TO King Aria AND KING ARIA
[2:28:10] SAID UH PAUL PAUL
[2:28:14] UH ALMOST THOU PERSUADEEST ME TO BECOME
[2:28:17] A CHRISTIAN AND APOSTLE PAUL KNEW THAT
[2:28:20] IT WAS JESUS CHRIST IN HIM CONFRONTING
[2:28:23] THAT KING. AND WHEN HE CONFRONTED THAT
[2:28:25] KING THAT'S WHY APOSTLE PAUL SAID I
[2:28:28] WOULD THAT YOU ARE NOT ALMOST BUT
[2:28:31] ALTOGETHER PERSUADED. AND THERE'S SOME
[2:28:34] YOUNG PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. I WOULD SAY
[2:28:36] TO YOU, I WOULD THAT YOU WERE NOT ALL
[2:28:38] LOST. I WOULD THAT YOU WERE NOT ON THE
[2:28:41] EDGE, BUT I WOULD THAT YOU WERE ALL
[2:28:43] TOGETHER PERSUADED.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:53] JUST AS I AM,
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT ONE PLEA,
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; JUST WHAT I AM, JUST WHAT I HAVE,
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; I GIVE MYSELF
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; completely
[2:29:06] over to Christ.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; If you feel that pull, IF YOU'VE HEARD
[2:29:12] THAT VOICE, THEN YOU CAN COME. IF YOU
[2:29:15] HAVEN'T HEARD IT, YOU CANNOT COME. BUT
[2:29:19] IF YOU HAVE HEARD IT, I SAY IN THE NAME
[2:29:21] OF JESUS CHRIST, DON'T YOU DARE TURN HIM
[2:29:24] DOWN. IF you do, IT MIGHT BE YOUR VERY
[2:29:27] LAST TIME. You say, "Oh, I've heard that
[2:29:29] before." YOU'LL ALSO HEAR THAT for the
[2:29:31] last time.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Our brother Ron Spencer, there's one
[2:29:35] other last one that he didn't mention
[2:29:38] that I know he wants to mention and the
[2:29:41] prophet MENTIONED IT AND I'M looking
[2:29:44] forward. HE SAID, "WE'LL PREACH."
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. FOR THE LAST TIME.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; WE'LL PUT OUR BIBLE UP. WE'LL PUT THE
[2:29:53] SWORD IN THE SHEATH AND IT'LL NEVER COME
[2:29:56] OUT AGAIN. AND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR
[2:29:58] ANOTHER SERMON LIKE THIS AFTER THAT
[2:30:01] TIME. THERE'LL BE PEOPLE PREACHING, BUT
[2:30:04] NOT THE KIND OF MESSAGES YOU'RE HEARING.
[2:30:07] GOD IS GOING TO SILENCE THEM AS HE
[2:30:08] SILENCED THE PROPHET'S LIPS. HE SILENCED
[2:30:10] THE LIPS OF THE LORD JESUS. He's going
[2:30:12] to silence the lips of the bride. And
[2:30:15] you won't hear this kind of preaching
[2:30:17] anymore.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; You haven't heard me speak like this
[2:30:20] ever before in a camp. But I'm speaking
[2:30:22] to you now. And if you're almost
[2:30:25] persuaded and you know that you're not
[2:30:27] right with God and you know that you've
[2:30:29] not surrendered your life, I can tell
[2:30:31] you right now, tonight's the night.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; And if God's not speaking to you, you
[2:30:36] can't even come. And if God's not
[2:30:38] speaking to you, I'm not inviting you.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "That's a hard thing. Jesus said it
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; and he said it a lot harder.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; And he saw them all leave.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to vacate this place
[2:30:52] tonight, but you won't vacate it like
[2:30:55] those that left Jesus. And he saw them
[2:30:58] leave him and being offended. WE DON'T
[2:31:01] LIKE WHAT HE'S SAYING. We don't like the
[2:31:03] way he's saying it. And Jesus let them
[2:31:06] go. And he never ran after them. He
[2:31:08] didn't send his disciples after them. He
[2:31:10] didn't have a visitation COMMITTEE. HE
[2:31:12] LET THEM GO.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go that way. But if
[2:31:18] you do, so be it.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; BUT IF GOD'S TALKING TO YOU, you better
[2:31:23] surrender your life. And you need to
[2:31:25] surrender it now.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been weighing it out.
[2:31:29] And I've been calling your name before
[2:31:31] God's throne.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Last night
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; and before and tonight. Some that are
[2:31:38] here and some that aren't here. I've
[2:31:40] been calling your name before God's
[2:31:42] throne. I've been calling it because you
[2:31:44] need it. YOU NEED SOMEBODY PRAYING FOR
[2:31:46] YOU. AND I'VE BEEN PRAYING, OH GOD,
[2:31:48] BREAK THE SHACKLES OF THEIR MIND. BREAK
[2:31:51] IT, OH GOD. AND DON'T LET THEM BE
[2:31:54] ALMOST, BUT LET THEM BE COMPLETELY
[2:31:55] PERSUADED
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; to come.
[2:32:00] I give you this one invitation. And
[2:32:03] we're going to sing this c this psalm
[2:32:05] just as I am without one plea. And
[2:32:07] there's ministers here to come and pray
[2:32:09] with you. Come right up boldly if you
[2:32:11] wish. If you wish. And we're and this is
[2:32:13] the only invitation we're going to have.
[2:32:15] Then we're going to close. Just as
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:32:23] without
[2:32:25] one me,
[2:32:28] but that
[2:32:30] thy blood
[2:32:33] was shed
[2:32:35] for me
[2:32:38] and that
[2:32:41] th
[2:32:43] come
[2:32:46] to thee.
[2:32:48] Oh lamb
[2:32:51] of God
[2:32:54] I come
[2:32:59] and waiting not
[2:33:03] just as
[2:33:06] I am
[2:33:08] and wait I'm not going to wait Lord you
[2:33:12] spoken I'm going to come to rid to rid
[2:33:16] my soul Oh,
[2:33:20] dark blood. Oh, so dark is the blood to
[2:33:24] thee whose blood
[2:33:28] can cleanse
[2:33:30] each.
[2:33:34] Why don't counselors and ministers and
[2:33:36] parents
[2:33:44] come just as
[2:33:48] I am
[2:33:50] without
[2:33:52] one plea
[2:33:55] but that
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; and those that come
[2:34:02] only you can call out upon him.
[2:34:06] I urge you to open your heart and your
[2:34:09] mouth. I would instruct you in prayer.
[2:34:13] Call upon the name of the Lord and thou
[2:34:15] shalt be saved.
[2:34:18] Oh God,
[2:34:21] I come.
[2:34:24] I
[2:34:26] come.
[2:34:31] Oh God.
[2:34:35] Oh God. Let them not be almost but
[2:34:38] altogether persuaded.
[2:34:42] Oh sweep oh God upon
[2:34:45] by your spirit upon this audience of
[2:34:48] people.
[2:34:50] Let it be something divine from sent
[2:34:53] from heaven. Heaven sent.
[2:34:56] Oh God, may there be a mighty
[2:34:59] deliverance,
[2:35:00] a mighty deliverance. May sin shackles
[2:35:04] be broken. May unbelief, oh God, be
[2:35:07] scattered. May the cloud, oh God, of
[2:35:10] darkness that engulfs the mind of of
[2:35:14] some of these young people, oh God, may
[2:35:17] it be broken aunder by the shining of
[2:35:20] the sun of God. SHINE ON US, LORD. SHINE
[2:35:24] ON US, OH GOD.
[2:35:26] SHINE ON US, OH LIGHT OF GOD.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; We enter into the land that you've given
[2:35:34] us. We take this mountain. We take this
[2:35:37] mountain, oh God. We will not be denied.
[2:35:43] Let the young women dedicate their
[2:35:45] bodies to you, oh God. Let the young men
[2:35:48] dedicate their strength to you now, oh
[2:35:50] God.
[2:35:52] Oh God,
[2:35:54] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:35:59] Oh God, let us be in prayer. And you
[2:36:03] that are
[2:36:05] giving your life surrendering wherever
[2:36:07] you are in the in the area,
[2:36:13] give vent to how God is speaking to you.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Speak to him.
[2:36:22] Let him hear your voice.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Let him hear your response
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; just now. Oh God,
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; just now, oh God,
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; just now he come.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Hear the cry of the shackle. Those
[2:36:54] of you that have come to pray, you pray.
[2:36:56] You pray.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; You pray.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You open your mouth.
[2:37:03] Say, "Oh, God, you know why I'm here.
[2:37:06] You're the one that spoke to me. You're
[2:37:08] the one that called. I'm here now
[2:37:11] because you've called me.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; That's how you get things.
[2:37:16] Oh, God, hear the cry.
[2:37:20] of the shackle
[2:37:23] from the set of time
[2:37:28] for the chains
[2:37:30] on their feet. There's no
[2:37:37] see the tears
[2:37:40] of the broken.
[2:37:47] No one
[2:37:51] to set us free.
[2:38:01] Glory
[2:38:35] Worthy.
[2:38:38] So worthy.
[2:38:44] Worthy.
[2:38:46] The lamb
[2:38:48] that was slain.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; First worthy.
[2:38:58] So worthy,
[2:39:02] oh worthy,
[2:39:06] the lamb
[2:39:08] that was slain.
[2:39:12] Hear the cries
[2:39:15] of the shackle
[2:39:17] from the onset
[2:39:20] time.
[2:39:22] For the chains of defeat, there's no
[2:39:27] king.
[2:39:31] See the tears
[2:39:33] of the broken,
[2:39:36] the cries
[2:39:38] of the slave. Oh, is there no one
[2:39:43] worthy
[2:39:45] set us free?
[2:39:48] Here it is when the cry
[2:39:52] is
[2:39:54] for as a chorus
[2:39:57] down for the shackle
[2:40:02] release from their ches.
[2:40:10] There are voices
[2:40:13] for swelling
[2:40:16] her song.
[2:40:18] Oh, worthy
[2:40:20] the lamb that was made.
[2:40:26] Hallelujah.
[2:40:28] Worthy.
[2:40:31] Oh, so worthy.
[2:40:36] Oh worthy.
[2:40:39] The lamb
[2:40:41] that was slain. Oh tonight. So worthy.

[2:44:20] defy those chains
[2:44:26] and they will fall

[2:44:41] Oh, I will bless I bless your name.
[2:44:45] Hallelujah. Lord, I give you.

[2:45:36] life.

[2:45:42] Yes, it is Jesus.
[2:45:53] I pledge
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; allegiance to the lamb.
[2:45:58] &gt;&gt; We'll close
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; and we'll send you with that confession
[2:46:03] coming off of your lips.
[2:46:06] I'd ask you only to sing it if you mean
[2:46:09] it. If you intend to make it that way, I
[2:46:13] have done so tonight. And especially
[2:46:15] those of you
[2:46:17] that have made a move and
[2:46:20] not only those that have come forward,
[2:46:21] but
[2:46:23] you've come to a resolve
[2:46:26] standing right where you are.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; As our brother Ron spoke, I never knew
[2:46:34] till tonight
[2:46:36] that that message touched his that boy's
[2:46:40] heart, that young man's heart. I never
[2:46:42] knew it till tonight. I remember the
[2:46:45] service.
[2:46:48] I remember preaching it.
[2:46:51] I remember coming to the end of the
[2:46:53] service
[2:46:54] saying, "We are the ones that are chosen
[2:46:58] to run the last lap." And now the now
[2:47:02] the baton has been handed to you
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; and you've been ordered run
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; run
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; this race.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; You always save in a relay the best
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; and THE FASTEST
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; TO THE LAST.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; And the Lord knew what he was doing when
[2:47:24] he brought you on the SCENE TO RUN IN
[2:47:27] THIS DARK AGE.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND LAY ON THE SAIL HAVE NO
[2:47:33] EFFECT UPON THE BRIDE OF JESUS Christ
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; and WE'LL CROSS THE FINISH LINE
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; TO BE RECEIVED
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; BY THE SAINTS OF ALL THE AGES.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, MY SISTER, PUT SOME
[2:47:50] ENERGY INTO YOUR GOSPEL. PUT SOME ENERGY
[2:47:53] INTO YOUR FAITH.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; Live valiantly.
[2:48:00] Hallelujah.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; Be faithful to Christ, faithful to the
[2:48:06] call. And we look forward to seeing you
[2:48:09] tomorrow, tomorrow evening. All the
[2:48:11] campers in the day. And if you have
[2:48:12] something to say 7:00 tomorrow night, 7
[2:48:16] like to have you here, Lord willing. We
[2:48:20] thank you for being here. All right.
[2:48:22] We'll sing this. And if you have an
[2:48:24] announcement, Brother Tom announcement,
[2:48:26] I'll let you close.
[2:48:28] All right.
[2:48:31] I have heard how Christians
[2:48:35] long ago
[2:48:38] were brought before
[2:48:42] a tyrant ro. They were told that we
[2:48:49] would spare
[2:48:53] if they were reounce
[2:48:58] the price.
[2:49:00] But one by one they chose to die
[2:49:07] the son of God.
[2:49:11] They would not deny
[2:49:14] my good praise telling
[2:49:18] why you sing. I can almost hear
[2:49:25] their voice.
[2:49:29] I
[2:49:31] also
[2:49:57] to the lamb.
[2:50:01] To the lamb of God
[2:50:05] who bore my pain,
[2:50:08] who took my place
[2:50:12] and bore my shame. I will sing
[2:50:17] to honor
[2:50:19] his coming. Hallelujah.
[2:50:24] Angel
[2:50:26] to
[2:50:30] the land.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[2:50:40] Bless your name.
[2:50:42] Bless your name. We bless your name.
[2:50:46] Hallelujah.
[2:50:48] Hallelujah.
[2:50:52] Hallelujah.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; How do you close a meeting like this?
[2:50:57] How do you close it, saints? From just
[2:50:59] seems like service after service. How do
[2:51:01] you close it? We must be breaking into
[2:51:04] that one eternal day.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what that's becoming a
[2:51:08] reality, saints.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; It's becoming a reality. As I saying to
[2:51:12] the young people this afternoon, the gap
[2:51:15] is getting greater. The gap is getting
[2:51:17] greater. The saints are going higher.
[2:51:20] And those that want to come, they're
[2:51:21] going lower. But I say, come and go with
[2:51:24] me to my father's house. COME AND GO
[2:51:27] WITH US. WE'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP AND
[2:51:29] we're getting carried away.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. You that have come
[2:51:38] to
[2:51:39] this evening service and have to go your
[2:51:41] way. If you wouldn't mind just making
[2:51:45] your way out the tent, greet one
[2:51:47] another, shake one another's hand, but
[2:51:49] keep riding on.
[2:51:52] And that'll help us
[2:51:55] just direct the young people here for
[2:51:57] the various things that we have for
[2:51:58] them. We appreciate that. We appreciate
[2:52:01] all you're doing and your support, your
[2:52:04] prayers to make these meetings such as
[2:52:06] they are.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to take that
[2:52:09] handshake. So, we've been praying for
[2:52:11] your meetings. We've been praying for
[2:52:12] the young people. You don't know what
[2:52:14] that does for me because I know that God
[2:52:16] has heard the prayers of his people. So,
[2:52:19] God bless you. As you make your way out,
[2:52:21] we'll have a word of prayer.
[2:52:28] Lord, we
[2:52:30] feel that the spirit of God is
[2:52:32] beckoning, pulling, calling,
[2:52:36] and Father, there's those that are
[2:52:38] responding.
[2:52:39] And so we just say, Lord, would you do
[2:52:42] this work within their lives that their
[2:52:43] hearts are calling for a victorious life
[2:52:46] in the Holy Ghost to stand as the
[2:52:49] redeemed, Lord, throughout the ages,
[2:52:52] Lord, they're willing to be identified
[2:52:53] for what they've heard this evening. And
[2:52:57] so, Father, we're asking that you will
[2:52:58] go with your children. May this presence
[2:53:01] that is here go with each and every one,
[2:53:03] whether it be in their cabin, whether it
[2:53:05] be in their car. Lord, may your nearness
[2:53:08] so ignite this expectation within their
[2:53:12] souls, realizing who they are in Christ.
[2:53:15] We're praying, Father, that you will
[2:53:17] protect those that are on the road. Keep
[2:53:19] them safe and watch over the remainder
[2:53:21] of the camp. Lord, you've blessed us
[2:53:23] with this fine weather. You've blessed
[2:53:25] us with this presence, Lord. This sen of
[2:53:28] God, we just pray it'll continue on
[2:53:30] tomorrow morning and tomorrow evening.
[2:53:32] Father, may you just come in in a
[2:53:34] special way. We ask these things now in
[2:53:38] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed. God bless you.
[2:54:23] Christmas.
[2:54:32] Hallelujah.
[2:54:58] Heat. Heat.
[2:55:36] away.
[2:55:51] Yeah.
[2:56:02] of Christ,
[2:56:04] the garment of your
[2:56:29] Let the word
[2:56:32] of the lamb
[2:56:44] have gone.
[2:56:48] Lord, the word of God said, "I have come
[2:56:50] to give you life and life more."
[2:56:53] So Lord, let him reach to that promise
[2:56:56] that says the lamb of God has come by
[2:56:57] his way tonight. The word of God that's
[2:57:01] back in the song.
[2:57:17] You're here by the grace of almighty
[2:57:20] God.
[2:57:24] Would you anchor that deep within his
[2:57:26] heart? Make him a man, Lord, that can
[2:57:29] stand up, say, "Oh Lord,
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; turn his life around for the glory of
[2:57:35] God."
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; And let him stand, Lord, under the man,
[2:57:39] the blood washed.
[2:57:46] willing to say, "Lord, forgive me of my
[2:57:49] sins. Forgive me of my
[2:57:54] willing to surrenus.
[2:58:37] He left his wet
[2:58:41] cry out.
[2:58:50] Don't let it die down. Don't let the
[2:58:52] flame, oh God, but let it burst into
[2:58:59] let
[2:59:04] in the name of Jesus.
[2:59:12] today.
