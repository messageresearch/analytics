[13:57] [Music]
[14:03] Father, we come before your throne of
[14:05] grace this morning,
[14:07] thankful for this revelation of grace
[14:11] that you have given to us, Lord, that
[14:13] there are a people on the earth that
[14:16] have been called, chosen, predestinated
[14:20] before the foundation of the world to
[14:23] live an overcoming life to be able to
[14:26] shine as as lights in a in a darkened
[14:29] world, oh God, to show that Jesus Christ
[14:32] is alive. The word has been resurrected
[14:35] and is living
[14:37] in his bride. Lord, we thank you that we

[14:42] God, we want to know and we want to be
[14:45] that that that perfect person. We want
[14:47] to rise up, oh God, into that stature
[14:50] that your your prophet of God has has

[14:57] prayer requests that we have heard this

[15:03] passing of our precious brother Richard
[15:06] Cobb, Lord, I pray that you would bless
[15:08] their family, oh God. Pray that you'd
[15:10] bring comfort to them. I pray Lord the

[15:44] hand and let it be a message. Let it be
[15:48] a message to them, oh God, that that
[15:50] that you are still

[16:32] supernatural touch of a healing God
[16:36] reach down and let his faith oh God

[16:43] that he is healed in the name of Jesus
[16:46] Christ. Lord for Sister Christa Bondi,

[17:00] has not been shortened. Oh God, you are

[17:08] request, Lord, you know the need. It's

[24:21] And even his

[24:48] God's purpose now
[24:51] made plain."
[24:53] [Music]

[26:05] very own.
[26:12] And through it all,
[26:15] God had a plan,
[26:19] little did they know,
[26:23] oh that he would lead all of his
[26:27] children
[26:29] back home.
[26:32] [Music]
[26:35] So how can I deny
[26:40] his hand of mercy?
[26:44] Oh,
[26:46] and trles they came and they left. No
[26:51] reason why.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; No reason why.
[26:57] I just stand and say that everything
[27:03] has worked out for my good.
[27:08] Oh, he has all he has all the answers
[27:13] for my life.
[27:18] It was the tater
[27:21] hand.
[27:24] [Music]
[27:25] Lord Jehovah.
[27:31] I look back and see
[27:35] he was always leading
[27:39] me.
[27:42] And what was made for him
[27:48] used to show me his great love. I now
[27:55] understand
[27:58] the tender hand of Jehovah
[28:06] and what was made for me
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] to show
[28:15] me his great love. I now understand.

[32:30] [Music]
[32:34] Amen.
[32:36] Well,
[32:38] we have some fill our cup and I believe
[32:42] we need to
[32:44] expect it.
[32:46] say, "I I've come with an empty cup and
[32:48] now I want to have it filled up.
[32:51] I believe our Lord is here to do that
[32:54] for us."
[32:57] Brother Ernie, I appreciated the prayer.
[33:01] I listen to what the brothers pray. And
[33:05] I feel that the Holy Spirit is present
[33:08] and that he has a thought. He has a
[33:10] mind.
[33:11] He has a direction. And we want that
[33:14] direction. I believe we've had that
[33:16] direction before camp, during camp, and
[33:22] now we're in post camp time.
[33:25] Nothing hinges on camp,
[33:28] but it is a time. It's a special time
[33:30] when we set ourselves aside. And to me,
[33:32] that's really special.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Just set ourselves aside and shut the
[33:38] door on so many of our activities or all
[33:41] the activities that we possibly can. And
[33:44] uh
[33:46] parents are away from, you know, the
[33:48] dayto-day grind.
[33:51] Children don't have school. They're not
[33:53] thinking about their studies. And it's
[33:56] really nice to shut out the world, isn't
[33:57] it?
[33:58] as much as possible. Wish we could do it
[34:01] more more often. So, I appreciate that
[34:04] prayer and certainly appreciate the song
[34:08] that was sung, the tender hand of
[34:10] Jehovah. We certainly need that.
[34:14] And uh
[34:17] there's a family we want to be
[34:18] remembering today uh that really need
[34:21] the tender hand of Jehovah, and it's the
[34:23] Cobb family. Pastor Richard Cobb passed
[34:26] away yesterday morning and it was rather
[34:30] sudden.
[34:31] I had gotten a a note an email during
[34:35] camp, excuse me,
[34:39] that brother Cobb was not well, but uh
[34:42] he had been he had had spells of illness
[34:45] over the last years. And so I didn't
[34:48] take it to be real real serious. and
[34:51] then just yesterday morning have re
[34:55] received news that he had passed away.
[34:58] So we want to be remembering our sister
[35:00] Cobb
[35:02] uh and Richard his son who's taking uh
[35:06] good part of the responsibility there at
[35:08] the church in Salem, Oregon.
[35:11] Also brother Jeff Jenkins wife, Sister
[35:14] Debbie, that's her daddy. And so I spoke
[35:18] with brother Jeff as soon as I had heard
[35:21] and uh there is no service that has been
[35:24] announced. Uh I believe they're going to
[35:26] have a maybe some private time with the
[35:29] family at graveside and then perhaps a
[35:32] memorial service later but we don't have
[35:34] any date so we I can't give you any
[35:37] time. But the one thing that we can do,
[35:40] we can remember the Cobb family and uh
[35:44] and the church. When a pastor is taken
[35:48] like that, you can imagine how the
[35:50] church feels. And so it has a
[35:53] far-reaching effect and we want to
[35:55] remember them. It's been quite a few
[35:57] years since brother Cobb was up here,
[35:59] even though we did try to have him come
[36:02] up at different times and it just didn't
[36:04] work out. Um, so we want to remember
[36:08] them.
[36:11] Uh,
[36:13] I'll have you stand and before we read
[36:16] the scripture, I would like to sing,
[36:18] brother Ryan, more of you because I
[36:24] don't know, I can't speak for you, but I
[36:26] can speak for myself. I want to have
[36:29] more of him when I leave this service
[36:33] than when I came to church this morning.
[36:36] And if I have a if we have a united
[36:41] uh spirit of feeling of that, then the
[36:45] service will take its proper course. And
[36:48] do you desire that more of him? We're
[36:51] not satisfied with what we have. We just
[36:53] want more of him. Let's just join our
[36:56] hearts together as we sing that please.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:14] I
[37:18] might
[37:22] you
[37:27] all
[37:28] my
[37:33] but
[37:35] I
[37:37] still
[37:40] Empty and
[37:43] Lord hear my prayer
[37:46] [Music]
[37:52] prayerfully now.
[37:58] Oh God, we can do
[38:02] his lovely power. Pour out your spirit.
[38:08] All
[38:10] I need is for
[38:14] you.
[38:18] All things I
[38:22] do.
[38:26] Yeah.
[38:31] [Music]
[38:36] I pray for
[38:40] you.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Empty and bare.
[38:47] Lord, hear my prayer for all.
[38:55] Once again, so empty and rare.
[39:00] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[39:11] With our heads bowed, heavenly father,
[39:13] we are not coming offering anything of
[39:15] ourselves, for we have nothing to offer.
[39:20] All we are and all we ever can be is
[39:22] what you have given already. All things
[39:25] have come from the father of lights, the
[39:29] giver of every good gift. And Lord, even
[39:32] our fellowship here this morning is a
[39:35] gift that has come from you. the
[39:37] redemption that we have experienced, the
[39:40] deliverance from condemnation and our
[39:43] sins to know that they are annihilated
[39:47] in the sea of your forgetfulness. Oh,
[39:50] what a joy, what a gift, oh God.
[39:53] Everything has come from you. And the
[39:54] fact we have the strength to even open
[39:57] our lips and open our mouths and to
[40:00] proclaim your praise is something that's
[40:03] a gift from you. And so we offer you
[40:05] what you've given us and we offer it
[40:07] back to you. Oh God, receive our
[40:10] thanksgiving, the service, Lord, the
[40:13] worship, the songs, and now the prayer
[40:16] and the ministry of your word. Father,
[40:18] we're asking especially you'll be with
[40:21] the Cobb family. Oh God, our sister
[40:24] Cobb, uh, Brother Richard, his wife,
[40:26] Charity, Lord, and sister Debbie, and
[40:29] her husband, Brother Jeff Jenkins. Pray,
[40:32] Father, in a special way you'll be in
[40:34] attendance near them. For you are the
[40:37] comforter, oh God. You're that special
[40:40] friend in time of need. And Lord, if we
[40:43] were in that need, we would appreciate
[40:46] praying for people praying for us. And
[40:48] so, as a congregation, we're praying for
[40:50] them. As an individual, I am praying for
[40:53] them. And all of these people, Lord, are
[40:56] something of prayer is being whispered
[40:58] in their hearts. God touch their lives.
[41:02] And I pray that you will help the
[41:04] assembly, Father, in the name of Jesus
[41:06] Christ. Praying also, Lord, for
[41:09] brothers, sisters Drews Barry and their
[41:11] church having the loss of their church
[41:14] by fire. Pray, oh God, that there'll be
[41:17] a holy fire in the very in the hearts of
[41:20] the people. And we see already a great
[41:23] strength is there, Lord. We do not know
[41:25] who or what is responsible for this
[41:28] tragedy, but you will be glorified in it
[41:31] all. You have never never lost a battle.
[41:34] And so we're so grateful this morning,
[41:36] Lord. We serve the mighty conqueror. We
[41:39] thank you, Lord, for each person that is
[41:42] here and pray that you'll be with us now
[41:44] that we might receive what we should
[41:45] receive. I pray you'll touch me, Lord,
[41:48] and anoint me, anoint the people to
[41:50] hear. And may the inspiration of your
[41:53] word continue, Lord, in the hearts of
[41:55] the people. Reveal to us what needs to
[41:58] be known in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[42:05] Nice to see our brother Hines Lancov.
[42:08] God bless you. Our brother Brian and
[42:11] Sister Jenny Jones are in their last
[42:13] service with us right now. And and uh
[42:16] oh, how we've enjoyed them. They've been
[42:18] staying with us in our home and we just
[42:21] uh love to have them. They're just uh
[42:23] just that I I trust they've been at
[42:25] home. We felt at home with them. And how
[42:28] many would like to see our brother Brian
[42:29] come back someday? Sister Janney.
[42:34] Amen.
[42:36] Someone said, "If the Lord's willing,"
[42:38] and uh and the preacher said, "He's
[42:40] willing. He's willing."
[42:42] He he knew what the will mind of the
[42:44] Lord was. At least that's what he was
[42:46] declaring. You can open your Bibles
[42:48] please to Genesis the 39th chapter.
[42:52] And uh my the uh the presentation at the
[42:57] camp was something so wonderful and the
[43:00] meetings our brother Ron Spencer
[43:03] preached on Joseph were so
[43:06] uh so inspiring and so fitting. And I
[43:10] announced there at the last service of
[43:13] the camp that I felt I would speak on on
[43:17] Joseph as well. Uh I want to speak on
[43:20] Joseph as the son of prosperity.
[43:25] And that will be uh my subject this
[43:28] morning. I'm going to read from the 39th
[43:31] chapter starting with verse one down
[43:34] through verse 6 and then verse 23.
[43:40] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
[43:43] And Piper, an officer of Pharaoh,
[43:46] captain of the guard, an Egyptian,
[43:49] bought him of the hands of the
[43:50] IshRaelites,
[43:52] which had brought him down thither. And
[43:55] the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a
[43:58] prosperous man, and he was in the house
[44:01] of his master, the Egyptian. And his
[44:04] master saw that the Lord was with him,
[44:07] and that the Lord made all that he did
[44:09] to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found
[44:13] grace in his sight. And he served him,
[44:17] and made him overseer over his house.
[44:20] And all that he had, he put into his
[44:23] hand.
[44:24] And it came to pass from the time that
[44:28] he had made him overseayer in his house,
[44:31] and over all that he had, that the Lord
[44:34] blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's
[44:37] sake. And the blessing of the Lord was
[44:40] upon all that he had in the house and in
[44:44] the field. And he left all that he had
[44:47] in Joseph's hand. and he knew not ought
[44:51] he had save the bread which he did eat.
[44:55] And Joseph was a goodly person and well
[44:59] favored. From the time of this verse,
[45:03] Piper's beautiful wife attempts to
[45:06] seduce Joseph.
[45:08] Joseph resists her her approach. He is
[45:12] falsely accused.
[45:14] He's cast into prison.
[45:17] in prison. He's blessed and uh he's put
[45:21] in charge and then the dream of the
[45:26] baker and the butler and the release of
[45:29] the butler and then recalling the dream
[45:34] of Joseph. And the Bible says in verse
[45:37] 23, "The keeper of the prison looked not
[45:41] on anything that was under his hand
[45:44] because the Lord was with him and that
[45:47] which he did, the Lord made it to
[45:50] prosper."
[45:52] Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Son of prosperity, you may be seated.
[46:02] I need to establish two things right at
[46:04] the beginning of the service this
[46:06] morning. And I I trust that your minds
[46:11] will capture
[46:13] and retain this thought throughout the
[46:17] service.
[46:20] First the the term prosper
[46:25] in the Hebrew and in reference to uh
[46:29] Joseph, it does not have the same uh the
[46:34] same reference as we have in our daily
[46:36] language today to prosper materially.
[46:40] That would be more to to have wealth or
[46:43] riches. But to prosper in the Hebrew
[46:46] here the first meaning is to rush or it
[46:51] is to advance
[46:54] or make progress. He was prosperous. He
[46:58] advanced. He made progress.
[47:02] And also to succeed.
[47:05] It also means to be profitable.
[47:08] But it is to bring to successful issue.
[47:13] It is to show the demonstration or the
[47:16] manifestation to show
[47:19] experience and to show
[47:22] prosperity.
[47:25] This is what the uh the Hebrew word in
[47:28] fact is the first occurrence of this
[47:32] word prosperity or to prosper or
[47:35] prosperous in the Bible is when it it
[47:39] speaks of Ezer
[47:42] will prosper. He said God has prospered
[47:46] my journey. He's prospered my way. And
[47:50] and what he's making reference to is I
[47:54] am achieving my goal.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; I have advanced. I have moved forward. I
[48:01] have followed the word that has been
[48:04] given me. I have followed the
[48:06] instruction. I've been told by my
[48:08] master, go and get a bride. And I prayed
[48:12] a certain prayer that the woman that
[48:15] would offer drink to my camels would be
[48:18] the woman. and God has prospered my way.
[48:21] I have achieved the goal.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what the word prosper really
[48:27] has reference to. That's its first
[48:29] meaning in the Hebrew. And that's what
[48:31] we want to stay with. That's what we
[48:34] want to put at least our emphasis on.
[48:38] And the second thing that I really need
[48:41] even more than and than what I just made
[48:44] reference to is that
[48:49] Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus Christ
[48:54] &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ is the word. And so
[48:59] when I make references to Joseph, when I
[49:03] make references to him, I would like you
[49:06] to be able to tie it immediately
[49:09] to the word.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Joseph prospered. The word prospered.
[49:15] Joseph reached his goals. He achieved
[49:20] certain goals. The word will achieve its
[49:24] goal where unto it has been sent
[49:28] according to Isaiah in the 55th chapter
[49:31] and we'll read that verse a little later
[49:33] on. So, Joseph is a perfect type of
[49:37] Jesus Christ. These references that we
[49:41] will look on today from at in Joseph's
[49:45] life and the characteristics of his
[49:47] life, we can take and turn it right
[49:50] around and bring it to this day and
[49:52] apply it right to the message.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Absolute make the same application.
[50:00] Now, this is just personally I I thought
[50:03] I was blessed by it. The Bible says that
[50:06] God loved that Israel loved Joseph more
[50:10] than all of his children because he was
[50:15] the son of his old age.
[50:18] And I was thinking in terms of Luke
[50:21] 17:30,
[50:22] the revelation of the son of man, the
[50:26] revelation of Jesus Christ in the end
[50:29] time, in the latter times, in the time
[50:32] of his old age. Now, God doesn't get
[50:35] old, but this is in the latter time that
[50:39] God has assigned to mankind upon the
[50:42] earth. And in the latter time, it seems
[50:44] that there is a like a a greater
[50:47] demonstration of the love of God to us
[50:50] who have come out of Leodysia who have
[50:53] been delivered out of the depths of the
[50:56] iniquity of this generation. It seems to
[50:59] me that's a greater demonstration of
[51:01] God's love.
[51:03] Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So we are going to view this part of
[51:07] Joseph's life through the prism of Luke
[51:11] 17:30.
[51:12] In the day when the son of man in the
[51:15] days of Noah, in the days of Sodom, even
[51:19] in that day will the son of man be
[51:21] revealed. And that son of man, that son
[51:25] has been revealed. He's the son. And
[51:28] that son is none other than the word of
[51:32] God made manifest, vindicated,
[51:35] confirmed. And God has loved this son
[51:39] because it's coming to its fulfillment.
[51:42] And I I trust you'll be able to with me
[51:44] be with me. I've said here, and I just
[51:47] want to follow these notes quite
[51:48] carefully because I've pondered them
[51:50] very very deeply over these last days.
[51:53] Joseph, the perfect type of Jesus
[51:56] Christ. He and he is the word and that
[52:01] word is living in his bride body.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Then some of those characteristics of
[52:10] the life of Joseph has direct reference
[52:14] to us. We could say Joseph perfect type
[52:17] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Fine. And Jesus
[52:20] Christ is the word. Say amen. That's
[52:22] great. Hallelujah. And that word uh that
[52:25] word is the message of the hour. It's
[52:27] the revealed word of the day. We say
[52:29] amen. Amen. Now we want to say and that
[52:31] word lives in me.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; That word lives now. It is a living
[52:37] word. I have received it in a heart of
[52:40] faith. I have received it in spite of
[52:43] any opposition. I've received it and it
[52:45] now lives in me. Then that means the
[52:48] characteristics and the description, the
[52:51] relationship of God to Joseph has a
[52:54] direct reference to the same God that's
[52:58] dwelling in you by virtue of how he
[53:00] transferred himself
[53:02] &gt;&gt; into you by making it a spoken word, a
[53:05] confirmed word, a vindicated word. And
[53:08] you believed it
[53:10] &gt;&gt; in spite of all obstacles. You believed
[53:12] it. You received it. Then then God's
[53:15] relationship to Joseph as a man and and
[53:18] how he dealt with him has direct
[53:21] relationship to you as an individual.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Have I made the connection?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; It's essential that we see
[53:30] that Joseph had to prosper
[53:34] because he's a perfect type of Jesus
[53:36] Christ. Because he's a perfect type of
[53:39] the word. He had to prosper. Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; The living word in its season will
[53:48] prosper.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; It has to prosper.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It has to achieve its goal.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; It cannot fail.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; How can God fail? How can this word
[53:58] fail? If it's word in you, how can you
[54:00] fail?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I guess the question is to how do we
[54:06] judge prosperity? How would you judge
[54:09] prosperity? Prosperity and riches in the
[54:13] Bible, as I said a moment ago, are two
[54:16] quite different things. The Leodysian
[54:18] church said,
[54:21] "I'm rich and increased with goods." And
[54:23] brother Brandham's very quick to point
[54:25] out that was her own self-estimation
[54:28] of what she was. That wasn't God's
[54:31] estimation. That was her own self
[54:33] estimation of what she was. That she was
[54:36] rich and increased with goods. But this
[54:38] is not prosperity
[54:40] because prosperity is reaching the goal.
[54:43] And the Leodysian age was not reaching
[54:46] their goal. They were not achieving
[54:49] God's plan for them. For even Christ was
[54:52] outside of the church knocking trying to
[54:54] get in. And in the Leodysian church age,
[54:57] in the church age book,
[55:00] brother Brandham says, "The Leodysian
[55:02] church is saying, I am rich and
[55:05] increased with goods and have need of
[55:07] nothing." That was her, that was her
[55:10] self-estimate.
[55:12] She looked at herself and that was what
[55:14] she saw. She said, "I'm rich." Which
[55:17] means she's wealthy in the things of the
[55:20] world. But she was not prosperous.
[55:24] She was not prosperous. It is virtually
[55:27] impossible
[55:29] to live by every word of God and fail.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; It's impossible to live by every word of
[55:39] God and fail. I'll put it another way.
[55:43] It's impossible to live by every word of
[55:45] God and not be prosperous
[55:52] &gt;&gt; in the sense of making progress and
[55:54] succeeding.
[56:00] Isaiah, God speaking through Isaiah
[56:03] says this, "So shall my word be that
[56:07] goeth forth out of my mouth." Now,
[56:10] when you go home this afternoon, I
[56:12] suggest you read Isaiah 55, the the
[56:16] chapter, the the whole chapter. It's not
[56:19] a long chapter, but and if you would
[56:22] please note when you're reading the
[56:25] verses that precede the 11th verse
[56:29] because you're going to find it starts
[56:31] out, whole everyone that thirsteth.
[56:35] There are certain conditions as you move
[56:38] along in the chapter you'll find uh the
[56:42] the word of God through Isaiah is
[56:46] identifying
[56:47] oh alas anyone that thirsteth
[56:51] let him come to the waters and he that
[56:53] hath no money goes on to describe it and
[56:56] wherefore do you spend money for bread
[56:58] that and and labor for that which
[57:00] doesn't satisfy and then the third verse
[57:02] says incline your ear so He that
[57:05] thirsteth, incline your ear. And you'll
[57:08] find those phrases on through. And then
[57:10] when you get to the 11th verse, it says
[57:13] this. Maybe I'll read the 10th verse
[57:16] also.
[57:18] For as the rain cometh down, and the
[57:21] snow from heaven,
[57:23] and re and returnneeth not, but waterth
[57:26] the earth, and maketh it bring forth the
[57:30] bud, that it might give seed to the
[57:32] sewer, and bread to the eater. The rain
[57:35] comes down and it doesn't return. It
[57:37] comes down to the earth and maketh
[57:39] maketh it to bud. The seed to bud. It
[57:43] says, "So shall my word be." God is
[57:46] likening it now. So shall my word be
[57:50] that goeth forth out of my mouth like
[57:52] rain that falls from heaven.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; It doesn't return back in the form of
[57:57] rain.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; But it brings forth something else. It
[58:01] produces a lifegiving seed. It produces
[58:05] conditions for life. So shall my word be
[58:09] that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[58:12] shall not return void,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish.
[58:20] It shall accomplish that which I please,
[58:23] that which I have pleasure in, and it
[58:25] shall prosper in the thing where unto I
[58:29] sent it. it shall achieve its purpose
[58:32] and its goal.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Now friends, if that word dwells in us
[58:39] richly and we give it full, we yield to
[58:42] it. That's why it's so important. We
[58:44] yield to it under its mighty uh power
[58:48] and persuasion of the Holy Spirit. We
[58:50] yield to it. We just dwell in that and
[58:54] the very atmosphere of it. You will
[58:56] succeed. Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; You will reach your goal.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; You will achieve your fulfillment and
[59:03] you will do God's purpose.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; It's impossible to do any otherwise.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It says the word that goeth forth out of
[59:12] my mouth and this going forth
[59:17] is to proceed towards something
[59:21] to go forth with a purpose and for a
[59:24] result.
[59:26] it. This word that goeth forth out of
[59:29] his mouth is to cause, to cause, to
[59:32] bring out or to lead out or to deliver.
[59:38] And it is also to accomplish or to
[59:41] fashion, to make or produce. The word of
[59:44] God shall produce what has been sent to
[59:47] produce. Hallelujah. And I want to look
[59:50] upon a congregation as I do this
[59:52] morning. And I I say in my heart, man
[59:55] has not produced this.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Man cannot do this.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Man has not sent this message around the
[1:00:04] globe.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Man has not directed this to the hearts
[1:00:08] of individuals. Hither and yawn. Who are
[1:00:11] we? We are total strangers in the world.
[1:00:14] Our what our paths had ever crossed. It
[1:00:17] was the prosperity of the word of God
[1:00:20] that has caused even you and I and the
[1:00:23] person sitting next to you to even know
[1:00:25] one another as brothers and sisters in
[1:00:27] Christ. You would have been hither and
[1:00:29] yawn. You would have been someplace else
[1:00:31] in the world. Some of you would have
[1:00:33] been gone and under the earth already.
[1:00:35] But God in his mercy
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; has united the body of Christ together
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; and causes one member to be with another
[1:00:47] member so that we can be uh uh benefited
[1:00:51] by that which every joint supply.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I'm a firm believer in the friends and
[1:00:58] God give me strength this morning. I
[1:01:00] have a I have a halo
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I want to drop on you.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to achieve it. It's already
[1:01:10] commissioned to achieve it.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for it to fail. It's not
[1:01:15] you that's prosperous. It's the word
[1:01:17] that's prosperous.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; You aren't going to reach your goal on
[1:01:22] your own steam and energy. And those
[1:01:25] that deprive themselves of the word,
[1:01:28] they deprive themselves. They simply
[1:01:30] make their journey harder and longer and
[1:01:34] become weary and unhappy and are do not
[1:01:38] achieve their goal in full fully in life
[1:01:41] like they could have
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; if they allowed the word of God first
[1:01:45] place in their life.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; That's why I don't believe we should go
[1:01:48] along like hitchhikers.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't go along and uh try to get
[1:01:52] by on easy street in the message. Say
[1:01:55] I'm baptized into this word. I'm
[1:01:58] baptized into this thing. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] I'm swallowed up in it. I'm consumed by
[1:02:03] it.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where's something I can do
[1:02:07] for God? Just show me the way. Point me
[1:02:10] in that direction. I want to use my
[1:02:12] life. I want to use my energy for the
[1:02:15] kingdom of God. Can you say amen?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:02:21] Now, I want to take several subjects,
[1:02:24] several parts. I want to speak on
[1:02:28] Joseph in respect to prosperity and
[1:02:32] advancement.
[1:02:34] Advancement as the favored of the
[1:02:36] father.
[1:02:38] Prosperity
[1:02:42] as a child favored of the father.
[1:02:47] The favored child
[1:02:50] is not often the one that really does
[1:02:53] well
[1:02:55] in the world.
[1:02:57] In the worldly sense, you find the
[1:02:59] favored child highly favored generally
[1:03:01] ends up highly spoiled.
[1:03:07] And some young men and women that I
[1:03:10] know, even in this city of Vancouver,
[1:03:13] that really were born with a golden
[1:03:16] spoon, not silver, but golden spoon in
[1:03:18] their hand and delivered to them on a
[1:03:21] golden platter and had all the wealth
[1:03:24] and the opportunity and every any school
[1:03:27] was open to them anywhere in the world
[1:03:29] or college, university or whatever more.
[1:03:31] They had they had it all. But they ended
[1:03:35] up as drug addicts, ended up as hopeless
[1:03:38] cases and were ashamed to to the
[1:03:42] community. That's what they ended up as.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's not so with the favored child.
[1:03:51] Joseph was a favored child. And the
[1:03:55] scripture says Israel loved Joseph more
[1:03:58] than all his children. God loved Joseph
[1:04:04] more than all of his children.
[1:04:08] One of the things that I encounter when
[1:04:10] people first come to the knowledge of
[1:04:12] the Christ in the light of this message
[1:04:16] because a lot of people come to altars
[1:04:18] and and receive Christ and various uh uh
[1:04:21] you know churches and whatever more but
[1:04:24] one of the strong elements of this
[1:04:26] message is election
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; predestination
[1:04:31] and that's what I caught in brother
[1:04:34] Ernie's prayer as he began his prayer.
[1:04:38] called,
[1:04:40] elected,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; predestinated. He said, and I said,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And one of the things, and some people
[1:04:49] have a long time getting over it, say,
[1:04:52] "Why me?
[1:04:54] Why not somebody else? What about all
[1:04:57] these good people? What about the rest
[1:05:00] of my family? Why me? I don't feel
[1:05:02] worthy of it." But you never find Joseph
[1:05:05] saying that.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; You never find Jesus saying that.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Why me?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Why wasn't somebody else?
[1:05:15] That's something that's not to be part
[1:05:16] of our vocabulary.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; We leave it up to God.
[1:05:29] Knowing brethren,
[1:05:32] beloved,
[1:05:35] your election of God,
[1:05:40] your choosing
[1:05:42] that God,
[1:05:45] he's the one who made the choice.
[1:05:48] Peter said, "Elect
[1:05:50] according to the fornowledge of God the
[1:05:53] Father through sanctification of the
[1:05:55] Spirit under obedience and sprinkling of
[1:05:58] the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto
[1:06:00] you and peace be multiplied."
[1:06:05] John said, "And we know, we know that we
[1:06:09] are of God." I have read those years ago
[1:06:13] and I thought how can John be so
[1:06:17] confident and speak
[1:06:20] uh and so isolate as it was the handful
[1:06:23] of people we know we are of God
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; and the whole world lith in wickedness.
[1:06:32] That's powerful statement even today.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; But we need to be able to make that same
[1:06:37] statement.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; We know we are of God.
[1:06:41] What about the others? That's up to God.
[1:06:43] But we know we are of God
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; and the whole world lith in wickedness.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It's not easy, especially for us in this
[1:06:54] Leodysian age to assign the world into a
[1:07:00] uh
[1:07:02] to assign him as being
[1:07:06] laying in wickedness. But that's what
[1:07:09] the scripture says.
[1:07:13] Listen friends,
[1:07:16] you know this isn't there are aspects
[1:07:20] of the word of God
[1:07:22] that are
[1:07:24] seem to be so confining.
[1:07:28] There's aspects of the word of God
[1:07:31] that seem to be harsh
[1:07:34] because they're not in the emotional
[1:07:36] realm.
[1:07:39] There are aspects of the message which
[1:07:42] are very very strong statements. One of
[1:07:44] them being
[1:07:46] that which is out there is just so much
[1:07:50] atomic
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; fodder
[1:07:55] because we see the living and we see
[1:07:59] people for you know what they are in
[1:08:02] life and so on. But go and stand at the
[1:08:05] at the cemetery.
[1:08:08] Go and stand at a cemetery and see all
[1:08:10] of those tombstones and and and all the
[1:08:13] flowers and everything. And everybody
[1:08:15] has some loved one and they're
[1:08:17] remembering that and they're putting
[1:08:18] flowers and they go back there every
[1:08:20] once in a while. But when you stand
[1:08:21] there, it's a and I have done it. I've
[1:08:24] passed by. I said, I wondered how many
[1:08:27] of those people died loving God with all
[1:08:30] their heart and soul and living for the
[1:08:33] word of God and wanting to be every bit
[1:08:36] of follower and disciple of Jesus
[1:08:38] Christ. Not very many.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say. Not very
[1:08:44] many.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And so if you just trans transfer that
[1:08:49] percentage to the living percentage, you
[1:08:52] got about the same thing.
[1:08:55] and few there be
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; that enter in
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; few there be
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; we're here as quite a number this
[1:09:06] morning
[1:09:08] and I hope we all reach the other side
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; but I can tell you one thing
[1:09:14] you need to re be resolved in your heart
[1:09:17] that you're going to live by every word
[1:09:19] of God this present word that's been
[1:09:22] revealed you need to resolve
[1:09:24] God has no favorites.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; God is no respector of persons. God does
[1:09:32] not say whoever joins that church or
[1:09:34] Cloverdale Bible way, they have some
[1:09:36] special place. No, that's not so. It's
[1:09:39] not sufficient to walk into this church
[1:09:41] or any other church.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that will bring
[1:09:45] you sufficiency in Christ, and that is
[1:09:47] that you have had an encounter with
[1:09:50] Jesus Christ, the word. Not Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] some figment of your imagination.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; People today are absorbed and know I
[1:09:59] love Jesus. Which Jesus? Who is Jesus?
[1:10:03] Jesus is this word in all of its
[1:10:05] capacity, in all of its beauty
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and even when it's harsh.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He that doesn't take up his
[1:10:13] cross and follow follow me cannot be my
[1:10:16] disciple." Is that what he said?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Who is me? Who is he? He's the word.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He's the living word.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And we know that the son of God is come,
[1:10:33] John said, and hath given us an
[1:10:36] understanding
[1:10:38] that we may know him that is truth.
[1:10:42] These verses are so potent,
[1:10:45] so powerful, pregnant with life.
[1:10:48] And we know that the son of god has
[1:10:52] come. Who in the world can realize that
[1:10:56] the son of god has come as he has come
[1:11:00] in his word coming? And the prophet says
[1:11:02] his word coming.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; How many know?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; How many how many have had that kind of
[1:11:12] an understanding? And that is what we
[1:11:15] have an un what does that mean to a
[1:11:17] person? Is it just uh uh an expansion of
[1:11:20] our knowledge? Is it just some kind of
[1:11:23] catechism? Is it just something that we
[1:11:26] teach at the church? What is it? Or is
[1:11:28] it an experience? I met him.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I had an encounter with him.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; I walk with him on a dayto-day basis. He
[1:11:38] speaks to me
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and I understand him and I speak to him
[1:11:43] and he understands me. I ask and he
[1:11:46] gives.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I ask and he says no
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; and it's still God.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that the kind of God we
[1:11:54] have?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Not some not some figment of
[1:11:57] imagination. Not something that's been
[1:11:59] projected from history till now. We know
[1:12:02] about the cross. We know about the
[1:12:04] resurrection. We understand that. We
[1:12:07] believe that. But all of that, all of
[1:12:09] that becomes meaningless if we fail to
[1:12:12] recognize him now here in this day.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; One that has been raised from history
[1:12:20] through a prophet's ministry. One that's
[1:12:23] been raised from the tomb. And he said,
[1:12:25] "My ministry is to prove he's
[1:12:27] resurrected.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; He's not dead.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; He's not a history.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; He's not some cold tradition. He's a
[1:12:35] living God now.
[1:12:38] and that he is deity.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are revealed.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; We're not floundering around wondering
[1:12:47] about the godhead or the baptism or
[1:12:50] about the original sin.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Thank God
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; those things have been made clear.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Thank God that the seals have been
[1:13:01] opened,
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; those mysteries have been revealed.
[1:13:06] And we know that the son of God has come
[1:13:09] and hath given us an understanding.
[1:13:11] That's why he came to give us an
[1:13:13] understanding that we may know him. That
[1:13:16] is true. That's the reason for the
[1:13:19] understanding. That we may know him and
[1:13:21] that we are in him.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That is true. Even in his son Jesus
[1:13:27] Christ that is the true God and eternal
[1:13:30] life.
[1:13:33] In the message, the war great warrior
[1:13:35] David,
[1:13:38] brother Bram said, David
[1:13:40] was called by election.
[1:13:43] And I just like this so we can make it a
[1:13:44] personal reference. He was elected,
[1:13:47] called, anointed, and placed.
[1:13:51] Elected by God, called from sheep
[1:13:53] hurting to be king. Anointed and
[1:13:55] positionally placed.
[1:13:59] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
[1:14:02] Abraham, election, Isaac, justification,
[1:14:06] Jacob, grace, and Joseph, perfection.
[1:14:09] That's the foundation of the
[1:14:10] masterpiece.
[1:14:15] He said, "How many Christians here
[1:14:19] raise up your hand?
[1:14:21] You're not a Christian by your desire.
[1:14:25] You're a Christian by God's desire." Oh,
[1:14:28] I hungered after God. Wonderful. But God
[1:14:31] hungered after you more than you
[1:14:33] hungered after him. You're not a
[1:14:36] Christian by your desire. You're a
[1:14:39] Christian by his desire. It's election.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And then he poured his oil upon you.
[1:14:47] Said he poured his oil upon David. Just
[1:14:51] went all over him. A horn, a whole horn
[1:14:54] of full of it. Not sparingly. And that's
[1:14:57] the way God pours the Holy Ghost on a
[1:14:59] man.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Not sparingly, just baptizes him into
[1:15:04] it.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Anointing him with the spirit.
[1:15:08] He said, "Right then, when that
[1:15:11] anointing," listen to this closely now.
[1:15:14] When that anointing struck him or struck
[1:15:16] you,
[1:15:18] you are positionally placed as David was
[1:15:22] positionally placed as a king. You are
[1:15:25] pos placed positionally in Christ Jesus
[1:15:28] as kings and priests. And the moment you
[1:15:32] receive the Holy Spirit, God places you
[1:15:35] in the kingdom and air. What a beautiful
[1:15:38] picture. And there you are. I say there
[1:15:41] you are this morning. That's where you
[1:15:44] are.
[1:15:45] Joseph was given a coat of
[1:15:49] many colors.
[1:15:52] I love very much
[1:15:56] how brother Brandham
[1:15:58] interprets that Joseph the younger son
[1:16:01] he said rejected of his brethren Christ
[1:16:04] rejected of his brethren he wore a coat
[1:16:07] of seven colors Joseph and the seven
[1:16:10] colors of course represented seven
[1:16:12] colors of the rainbow which was a
[1:16:16] covenant
[1:16:17] Joseph
[1:16:19] perfect type of Christ completely
[1:16:22] covered
[1:16:24] with the covenant of God.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[1:16:29] And no wonder in Revelation chapter 10,
[1:16:34] he saw one sitting upon the throne
[1:16:39] and over his head
[1:16:41] was a rainbow.
[1:16:47] And another mighty angel came down from
[1:16:50] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:16:53] rainbow was upon his head. Why? Because
[1:16:56] he's the covenant angel.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the covenant angel.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Joseph was covered with a covenant.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; He was the covenant child.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the covenant son
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; and we are his covenant bride.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're robed in his
[1:17:13] righteousness. Yeah.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And the robe that robes you is much more
[1:17:18] wonderful than the cloth that robed
[1:17:21] Joseph,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Jacob's son,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; the robe that you have this morning is
[1:17:27] much more beautiful than that robe.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; God always has his covenant people. And
[1:17:42] then this young Joseph was killed
[1:17:45] supposedingly
[1:17:46] by his brethren and his coat was to be
[1:17:49] returned to his father.
[1:17:52] Oh my. Oh my. How the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:58] after his death and his resurrection
[1:18:01] with that covenant blood ascended up.
[1:18:04] The Bible says into the holiest of all
[1:18:07] in the presence of God says it's
[1:18:09] finished. Father it's done. Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] The price has been paid. Your your
[1:18:16] covenant has been kept.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you're feeling, but I'm
[1:18:22] feeling religious when I get to that.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "I want you to see another
[1:18:29] thing. He was thrown into a ditch and
[1:18:31] was supposedly to be dead, but was taken
[1:18:34] up from the ditch and was taken into the
[1:18:37] greatest commercial city of the world
[1:18:39] and was made a right-hand man. Not no
[1:18:44] man could enter into the gates or come
[1:18:46] into the courts without first coming
[1:18:48] through Joseph a perfect type of Christ.
[1:18:51] in the message Israel in Egypt. He said
[1:18:54] while he was in prison there were two
[1:18:56] men a butler and a baker and one of them
[1:18:58] was lost and the other one was saved.
[1:19:01] Never forget when brother Brandham said
[1:19:02] to me a lot of people think that three
[1:19:04] died at Calvary said there was four.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the son of God and he took
[1:19:10] one to heaven and Judas the son of
[1:19:14] predition and he took one to hell.
[1:19:19] was four that went at the time of
[1:19:22] Calvary. And Judas was the son of
[1:19:24] predition.
[1:19:30] And while Joseph was in his prison,
[1:19:35] one was delivered and restored back to
[1:19:37] his original place and the other one
[1:19:42] uh was destroyed.
[1:19:48] Joseph of perfect type. Israel and Egypt
[1:19:51] message. Joseph a perfect type. I just
[1:19:54] want to get these few quotes here. And
[1:19:56] this is the last one just now. He says,
[1:19:58] "Standing there like the Jews returning
[1:20:01] in the last days and how we our
[1:20:03] newscasts are filled with what is
[1:20:06] happening in Israel right now. Joseph a
[1:20:09] perfect type standing there like the
[1:20:11] Jews returning in the last days at the
[1:20:14] end coming to the millennium when the
[1:20:16] Jews will be saved again." And Joseph,
[1:20:20] you know how he was sent down there, how
[1:20:23] how the Israel sent down his children.
[1:20:26] That's Jacob. And they got a little
[1:20:29] corn. They were starving to death. And
[1:20:32] Joseph had interpreted the king's dream
[1:20:36] and how he had put up the corn
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and the only place in the world that had
[1:20:42] food.
[1:20:43] Now, if you will keep the initial
[1:20:45] thought from the beginning when we speak
[1:20:48] of Joseph, we come right through Christ
[1:20:51] through the revealing of Jesus Christ in
[1:20:53] the end time and that he came not only
[1:20:56] to heal the sick and all those things,
[1:20:57] but he came and poured himself into a
[1:21:00] word so that a people of that season
[1:21:03] could believe that word and the word
[1:21:05] could continue its course and be poured
[1:21:08] into the people so the word could become
[1:21:11] flesh once gain
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; and the scripture says the brother
[1:21:16] Brandham drawing from the scriptures is
[1:21:18] that was the only place there was corn.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; It's not the only place there may be
[1:21:26] entertainment or the only place there
[1:21:29] may be church or the only place there
[1:21:31] may be religion but it's the only place
[1:21:34] there's corn.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; They might have had dancing. They might
[1:21:38] have had whatever they had in the rest
[1:21:40] of Egypt, but there was and the rest of
[1:21:43] the nations, but there was only one
[1:21:45] place there was corn.
[1:21:57] He said the only place in the world that
[1:21:59] they had food perfect of the church
[1:22:02] today, the only place spiritual food is
[1:22:07] given out is in the kingdom of Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of psychology.
[1:22:15] You can have all kinds of messages of
[1:22:18] every kind. You can have positive
[1:22:20] teaching. You can have faithbuilding
[1:22:23] sermons. You can have all kinds of
[1:22:25] things. You can be moved. You can be
[1:22:27] anointed. But I'm not interested merely
[1:22:30] in an anointing. I'm interested in the
[1:22:32] truth
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; of God's word.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You can go to some old church creed and
[1:22:45] recite a few apostles creeds and
[1:22:47] whatever you want to. But brother, the
[1:22:50] spirit lays in the bornagain church of
[1:22:53] the living God is the only where there's
[1:22:56] food. And those Jews are going to
[1:22:59] recognize that one of these days and
[1:23:02] they're coming. This was way back when
[1:23:04] he was preaching these messages. And the
[1:23:06] Jews and here they are. And we've come
[1:23:07] all of these years. Friends, I I keep
[1:23:10] watching Israel, God's time piece. I
[1:23:13] keep watching it very very carefully,
[1:23:15] but I cannot interpret everything that
[1:23:17] is happening. And I see Jew fighting
[1:23:20] with Jew and Jew, hauling Jew off of his
[1:23:24] own land and see all these kind of
[1:23:26] things taking place. May not be able to
[1:23:28] interpret everything, but I can I can
[1:23:31] see more clearly the distinction between
[1:23:35] those that are of the 144,000
[1:23:39] faith of the 144,000.
[1:23:42] There is an elect group in Israel that
[1:23:46] are believing God's word. They're not
[1:23:49] interested in politics. They're not
[1:23:52] interested in compromise. They're not
[1:23:54] interested in in any other solution.
[1:23:57] They want God's solution.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And I say,
[1:24:05] the word that goeth forth
[1:24:08] out of his mouth shall not return unto
[1:24:12] him void,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that for which
[1:24:16] it has been sent.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And it will please God when he sees the
[1:24:21] fulfillment of it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You know friends, don't get taken up.
[1:24:28] Please don't become affected and
[1:24:31] afflicted with the mentality of this
[1:24:34] generation.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Don't get afflicted with the mentality
[1:24:38] of Leodya that you know somehow
[1:24:41] everything's going to work out.
[1:24:42] Everybody's okay. Everybody has their
[1:24:44] own rights to their own opinion. Da da
[1:24:45] da da da da. This is the only opinion
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; and this is the only word that's going
[1:24:51] to be fulfilled.
[1:24:55] And do you know that when God's purpose
[1:24:57] is is is finally fulfilled upon Israel,
[1:25:02] do you know a lot of people are going to
[1:25:03] perish?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Do you know that a lot of nice people
[1:25:06] are going to perish?
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know that a lot of babies are
[1:25:09] going to perish
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; and already have
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; and that we do not we do not feel good
[1:25:16] about that?
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I don't feel good about innocent people
[1:25:19] suffering.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; But it happens.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; It does happen and it will happen. Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And before God's word is fulfilled,
[1:25:28] there's going to be a lot more
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; in the end. Let me tell you friends,
[1:25:36] don't listen to all this preaching and
[1:25:38] be caught in the tribulation.
[1:25:44] I will say to you that come to Bible
[1:25:45] way,
[1:25:48] whatever you do, don't be caught in a
[1:25:53] time of tribulation. I don't believe you
[1:25:55] need to.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; I don't believe you need to sit here and
[1:25:58] say, "Well, am I predestinated to it or
[1:26:00] am I not?" This world is headed for a
[1:26:04] horrible destruction.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And that also is in the word of God. And
[1:26:10] this word of God shall prosper. It shall
[1:26:13] prosper. It shall accomplish what it's
[1:26:16] been sent to do.
[1:26:26] And he says this in closing with this
[1:26:28] part.
[1:26:32] And those Jews
[1:26:34] are going to recognize that one of these
[1:26:36] days
[1:26:38] and they're coming. That's why they're
[1:26:39] there. They're going to recognize it one
[1:26:41] of these days.
[1:26:43] Now, the grace of God is upon this
[1:26:45] message.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; The grace of God is upon this word.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; The child grew and waxed strong. It says
[1:26:54] of Jesus,
[1:26:56] he waxed strong in spirit,
[1:26:59] filled with wisdom, and the grace of God
[1:27:03] was upon him. the grace,
[1:27:08] the favor, unmmerited favor,
[1:27:12] the loving kindness. And he loved Jacob.
[1:27:15] He loved Jacob loved Joseph more than
[1:27:18] all the children.
[1:27:22] There's a special favor
[1:27:25] upon
[1:27:26] this message,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; There's a special favor upon it. Now,
[1:27:31] some of you and the young people you've
[1:27:33] been born and raised in it, you might
[1:27:35] not have anything to relate to,
[1:27:38] but I hope that before the service is
[1:27:40] over, you'll be able to have a better a
[1:27:44] better understanding of it. Brother
[1:27:46] Brandham says,
[1:27:48] and it's absolutely true,
[1:27:51] giving all the glory to the Lord Jesus,
[1:27:54] he said he did he's done more in
[1:27:56] Jeffersonville
[1:27:59] than he done in did in in his own
[1:28:01] ministry
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; in Palestine.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; What What do I call that? I call that
[1:28:08] more favor.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; More favored in the end time.
[1:28:14] And I'll tell you why
[1:28:16] Jesus did what he did. And he even said
[1:28:19] to his disciples, "Don't go to the
[1:28:22] Gentiles. Just go to the lost sheep of
[1:28:25] the house of Israel."
[1:28:27] Because they were the ones that were
[1:28:30] going to be judged. And it was Jerusalem
[1:28:33] that suffered incredible suffering
[1:28:38] when Titus came and destroyed it. And
[1:28:41] Israel has suffered. The Jew has
[1:28:44] suffered enormous,
[1:28:47] enormous tragedies,
[1:28:50] just horrific things
[1:28:53] over the centuries because they rejected
[1:28:55] Christ.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And that is the one thing that the Roman
[1:29:00] Catholic Church and the Jewish people
[1:29:02] today try to settle on that because one
[1:29:05] blames the other and the other blame the
[1:29:07] other. And finally at the at the end
[1:29:09] time and it's so Leodysian. It's so
[1:29:12] modern to be able to say, "Well, let's
[1:29:14] let's bury the hatchet.
[1:29:16] We won't blame you any longer and you
[1:29:18] don't blame us." And that's really what
[1:29:21] they've come to.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's been the big dividing point
[1:29:24] between what so-called Christianity and
[1:29:27] Judaism. You blamed us for the death of
[1:29:30] Jesus Christ and and we and and we say
[1:29:32] it's your fault. You people did it. And
[1:29:34] so now we'll bury the hatchet.
[1:29:38] And somehow that seems to be, you know,
[1:29:40] very civilized.
[1:29:42] That's very appropriate. And suddenly
[1:29:44] nobody's responsible for it. It's just
[1:29:46] something that happened.
[1:29:49] No,
[1:29:54] I believe that the message has been
[1:29:58] highly highly favored of God.
[1:30:04] To have the grace of God
[1:30:07] is to be the recipient.
[1:30:11] This is my language, my terms now. To be
[1:30:13] the recipient of merciful kindness.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Undeserving.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; No one can say I'm deserving.
[1:30:25] Undeserving.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Though we were, yet we have been the
[1:30:29] recipient by election,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; by choosing.
[1:30:33] of merciful kindness upon our lives.
[1:30:39] The Bible says also in John 1:14, "And
[1:30:43] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:30:46] us, and we beheld his glory, the glory
[1:30:48] as of the as of the only begotten of the
[1:30:51] father, full of grace and truth." The
[1:30:54] only only begotten of the father, full
[1:30:57] of grace and truth.
[1:31:00] Now I know if I say, "How many believe
[1:31:03] that that was Jesus Christ?" You say,
[1:31:05] "Yeah, amen. I believe it." But now if
[1:31:10] that was only of Jesus Christ back 2,000
[1:31:13] years ago, then somehow God's
[1:31:17] uh the continuity
[1:31:20] of God's program would be broken because
[1:31:24] Jesus said, "I
[1:31:26] will be in you. I am in the father and
[1:31:29] the father in me and I in you and you
[1:31:32] and me. That is unbroken continuity of
[1:31:36] the scripture. And then if we're only
[1:31:38] going to take if we're only going to
[1:31:40] take it on the on the basis that uh
[1:31:43] there are certain laws and certain
[1:31:46] principles of the scripture and I accept
[1:31:49] those I receive those I receive that as
[1:31:52] receiving Jesus Christ and I implement
[1:31:55] those certain uh attributes or those
[1:31:57] certain characteristics of the scripture
[1:31:59] and those certain laws and then I
[1:32:01] benefit from them. That's not what the
[1:32:03] gospel is all about. What the gospel is
[1:32:06] all about is that the whole sum and
[1:32:10] substance, the characteristics, the very
[1:32:13] nature of the the son of God is revealed
[1:32:16] once again in his people.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And God looks upon it and he's glorified
[1:32:23] and and there isn't two. There's only
[1:32:25] one. Right.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Actually, believe it or not, I've just
[1:32:33] been laying a foundation all this time.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And he's full.
[1:32:42] Full
[1:32:43] f u l full. He's the only begotten of
[1:32:49] the father. I say Luke 17:30 when the
[1:32:52] son of man will again be revealed.
[1:32:55] That's the only son.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And God did not send a handful of
[1:33:00] prophets to reveal him.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; God did not send a bunch of dignitaries
[1:33:04] to reveal him. God sent Malachi 4, one
[1:33:08] man, a prophet to reveal him.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And that son of man was revealed. He's
[1:33:14] the only son.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And that's the only word. And that word
[1:33:20] is full
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; of grace
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; and truth
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; do you people believe that?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] I'm waring against the spirit of
[1:33:39] Leodysia because we have to war war
[1:33:42] against it because we become so almost
[1:33:46] contaminated and it and and Satan is so
[1:33:49] persistent to keep bombarding our minds
[1:33:52] with you know these are nice people and
[1:33:55] we accept this and accept that and
[1:33:56] accept something else and I say no he's
[1:34:00] the only son
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:34:05] people resent that.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; They resent that
[1:34:11] singling out and identifying.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; But if it isn't that if it isn't that,
[1:34:18] friends, then then we're we're lost on
[1:34:21] an on a sea of
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; of just opinion.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; We've got to have an absolute.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And that is the absolute. Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm narrowing it down. There's only
[1:34:34] one Jesus Christ. There's only one
[1:34:37] revealed word. There's only one Bible.
[1:34:40] And this is the Bible that God has
[1:34:42] written. It's not good news for man. And
[1:34:45] some of this other stuff that's been uh
[1:34:47] interpreted and translated. And you can
[1:34:49] see all kinds of Bibles in the
[1:34:51] bookstore. But I want a Bible that a
[1:34:53] prophet of God could read and say that
[1:34:56] that's the word of God. That's how it
[1:34:59] came down in our time. And the reason I
[1:35:02] say that is because after he would read
[1:35:04] it, after he would preach it and say,
[1:35:06] "If that God, the author of this word,
[1:35:09] doesn't come now and and prove himself
[1:35:12] and vindicate that what I've said is the
[1:35:14] truth. I'm a false prophet." And then
[1:35:16] see God come down and begin to reveal
[1:35:19] the secret of the heart and telling the
[1:35:22] people uh things that they didn't
[1:35:24] understand and had questions about.
[1:35:26] That's the God I'm talking about.
[1:35:30] I want that God to be my God.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; You can do what you wish with it.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; The word I'll say today, the word in
[1:35:41] this flesh is full of grace and truth.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; unmmerited favor of God.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; We say yes, completely unworthy we are.
[1:35:56] But nevertheless,
[1:35:57] God
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; had a desire
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; and it's up to him who he chooses.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say I want to be
[1:36:05] chosen. I think he chose me. That's not
[1:36:08] good enough. I know that he has chosen
[1:36:11] me to be a son of God. I fail him, but
[1:36:15] still that doesn't change me from being
[1:36:17] a son of God.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I perhaps have done things perhaps in my
[1:36:24] life that my parents, God bless, their
[1:36:28] gallant souls. They may have been very
[1:36:31] disappointed to have seen and thought
[1:36:34] that maybe I could have made a better
[1:36:36] choice.
[1:36:39] But that doesn't change my birth.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I was born in my household. I was born a
[1:36:46] biscal. and I will be that to my dying
[1:36:49] breath or till I'm translated or
[1:36:52] raptured.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; This message that God has so vindicated
[1:37:00] is clearly the favored child
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; of this latter day.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Clearly the favored child. Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Now folks,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; just listen.
[1:37:17] You that have lived this message, you've
[1:37:19] all experienced this.
[1:37:22] As it was in Jesus' time, as it was in
[1:37:25] the prophet's ministry, even so is it
[1:37:28] right now.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; People look back,
[1:37:33] they're captivated.
[1:37:35] Some
[1:37:38] they're aruck
[1:37:41] trying to figure you out.
[1:37:45] There's millions of people out there,
[1:37:47] but they're trying to figure you out.
[1:37:49] It's kind of,
[1:37:51] are you for real?
[1:37:56] They're mesmerized.
[1:37:59] Even some become gripped.
[1:38:02] I've got to find out a little bit more
[1:38:04] about this.
[1:38:07] And some are spellbound
[1:38:10] as they were in Jesus' time, as they
[1:38:13] were in the prophets time. They sat
[1:38:15] there
[1:38:17] just completely spellbound,
[1:38:20] gripped, mesmerized,
[1:38:22] aruck,
[1:38:24] and yet could not find the inner faith
[1:38:29] to accept him.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; They see it.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; They see it in your face.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the word of God
[1:38:40] prospering.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God doing what it was
[1:38:44] sent to do.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; It was sent to change you. It was sent
[1:38:49] to transform you. It was sent to make
[1:38:52] you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Not
[1:38:54] just quit drinking, smoking. That stuff
[1:38:56] there. That's that's not even in the
[1:38:58] books.
[1:39:01] Oh, I quit drinking. I quit. But those
[1:39:02] are attributes.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But it turned you into a lover of
[1:39:07] Christ,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; a lover of the word, a lover of the
[1:39:10] message,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and it turned you into a new creature, a
[1:39:14] different kind of a person with a
[1:39:15] different kind of attribute, different
[1:39:17] kind of appetites,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; and people looked on that,
[1:39:22] I'd like to be like you.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Deep in their heart. They don't want
[1:39:26] they don't say it, but they but they're
[1:39:28] caught by it. Something's gripped them.
[1:39:31] And it's the word of God prospering,
[1:39:34] taking you. It has achieved bringing you
[1:39:38] to this point.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; unto me
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Is that what the
[1:39:48] scripture says? And that's what you're
[1:39:49] doing right there. Even though you you
[1:39:52] don't have to get there and do a whole
[1:39:53] lot of things and try and convert them,
[1:39:55] the word is already there achieving its
[1:39:58] goal
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; and you're there as a testimony. You're
[1:40:02] there as a witness. You walk with the
[1:40:04] glory glory of God on your face.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot more than a long dress
[1:40:10] and long hair.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot more than just saying
[1:40:14] the right thing because you can say one
[1:40:16] thing and live another. But it's a life.
[1:40:23] I had a man say to me just this last
[1:40:24] week, "I haven't known you very long."
[1:40:27] He said, "But I've come to respect you.
[1:40:30] I respect you." And he's even wondering
[1:40:33] why he does that. There's just something
[1:40:36] the way maybe the way you conduct
[1:40:38] yourself or the way you handle yourself
[1:40:41] or the way you look at things or the way
[1:40:43] you respond to situations and they they
[1:40:46] admire it,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:48] Who is this person? What makes him that
[1:40:51] way? There's something there I admire,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; but to find the inner faith to say, "I
[1:40:57] want it."
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I think every once in a while of our
[1:41:01] brother Frank Fletcher here when the man
[1:41:04] who was designing supposed to design
[1:41:06] this church and the architect and he had
[1:41:10] such grand schemes and grand ideas, he
[1:41:13] had half the amount we committed to the
[1:41:15] whole church just committed to the roof.
[1:41:20] So
[1:41:22] we fired him
[1:41:25] and uh he ended up in Brother Frank
[1:41:28] Fletcher's shoe store way down towards
[1:41:32] university. Was it on Fourth Avenue,
[1:41:33] Brother Frank? Yeah, Fourth Avenue. Way
[1:41:36] down to university, 25 or 30 miles from
[1:41:38] here. He's He's just going in to buy a
[1:41:40] pair of shoes.
[1:41:42] Isn't that marvelous? Isn't that a
[1:41:44] miracle in the making?
[1:41:46] It is. It was.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Because of because of this fellow, a
[1:41:50] fired architect of this church going in
[1:41:52] to buy a pair of shoes down towards the
[1:41:54] university grounds 2530 mi from here
[1:41:57] where brother Frank's sitting there
[1:41:59] selling shoes. And he's religious right
[1:42:01] up to his eyebrows.
[1:42:05] And he kept talking some about, you
[1:42:07] know, where the where I can find the
[1:42:08] truth. And brother Frank asks him a
[1:42:11] question somebody. You know where where
[1:42:12] can a person find the truth and find
[1:42:14] real Christians.
[1:42:18] Well fell says well he says I know some
[1:42:21] place. He said I know one place. He said
[1:42:24] it might be all right for you but he
[1:42:25] said it's it's too much for me.
[1:42:29] Think of that. Hundreds of churches.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hundreds of churches all around the
[1:42:33] country. and uh and and when he gets
[1:42:35] asked that kind of a question because
[1:42:37] there was something in brother Frank
[1:42:39] calling out.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't calling for another church. He
[1:42:43] had he's gone to church. He has all
[1:42:45] kinds of things.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; And the religion religion is cruel.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Religion costs a lot of lives.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And may I say this and brother Frank
[1:42:58] will forgive me. Religion has cost him
[1:43:00] his wife.
[1:43:02] tore his wife away from him and his
[1:43:04] children.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Religion,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; cruel, cruel religion.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Religion that's been inspired by Satan.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And he's lived alone all these years. An
[1:43:21] aspired architect saying, "Might be it
[1:43:24] for you, but it's not for me."
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; But that's the only place he thought of.
[1:43:29] And brother Frank ends up coming in
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; and the rest is history.
[1:43:39] No,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; the life of this son of man
[1:43:46] living in you
[1:43:49] is admired
[1:43:52] and respected
[1:43:54] and on the other hand it's despised and
[1:43:58] hated.
[1:44:00] It's such a
[1:44:03] to me it's it's such a strange it's
[1:44:07] something you can't reconcile. They'll
[1:44:09] admire it. They know it's truth but they
[1:44:13] will not accept it.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And now I'm talking about not just that
[1:44:18] they don't have the inner strength to
[1:44:19] believe it but refuse it and reject it.
[1:44:23] And yet deep down in their heart of
[1:44:25] hearts, there's something witnessing
[1:44:28] saying it's the truth.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I see something that I admire. Listen
[1:44:34] friends, I'm saying all that not to pump
[1:44:37] you up. Not to make you feel great. I
[1:44:40] just want to say this and I'm a long
[1:44:42] ways from being over and I'll try to
[1:44:43] make it short because I'll come back to
[1:44:45] this subject. It's not you.
[1:44:50] It is the word
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; that is in you
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; that is prospering.
[1:44:56] [Applause]
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; To receive it is to be in God's favor.
[1:45:07] And to turn away from it is to be
[1:45:10] removed from God's favor.
[1:45:15] Now, I'm going to try to watch my time,
[1:45:19] but yet will you give me a little bit
[1:45:21] more time?
[1:45:26] And especially to you young people just
[1:45:28] out of camp.
[1:45:30] I've seen people
[1:45:32] in their walk, in their Christian walk,
[1:45:35] I'm talking about in this church, in
[1:45:37] this message, and other places where
[1:45:39] I've been,
[1:45:42] and they're real fervent
[1:45:45] for what they want to be fervent for,
[1:45:49] and then there gets to be other areas
[1:45:51] when doesn't fit them just exactly
[1:45:53] right. And so, they kind of exclude that
[1:45:55] out of their their life.
[1:45:58] And it kind of moved from that. At that
[1:46:01] point, that individual, whoever it might
[1:46:05] be, me, my wife, my family, or anyone
[1:46:09] here, you will start to suffer
[1:46:13] immediately
[1:46:14] from not following every word. Be not
[1:46:18] because you as an individual, but the
[1:46:22] word that you're not allowing to work in
[1:46:25] you cannot prosper. It's the word that
[1:46:29] prospers.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the word that
[1:46:34] prospers. As a person allows the life
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; of the message and they receive it and
[1:46:40] they receive it and this one is will say
[1:46:44] this one is so compatible with you. But
[1:46:46] the next one is much more difficult.
[1:46:49] uh you know
[1:46:52] it might be for the wife, it might be
[1:46:54] for the husband, might have to do with
[1:46:56] the husband's responsibility and his
[1:46:59] spiritual headship and maybe he hasn't
[1:47:01] really taken that. I tell you what,
[1:47:05] do what you want. I'm a pastor, but I
[1:47:08] sit there and I I see the home suffer. I
[1:47:11] see the kids suffer. And then you see
[1:47:14] another home and you see the husband and
[1:47:17] he takes his place and takes his role
[1:47:19] and is a provider and he cares over the
[1:47:22] family. Maybe he's no great hero. Maybe
[1:47:25] he's not visible in the church. May
[1:47:27] maybe he's not someone who's who's up
[1:47:29] singing or playing an instrument or
[1:47:31] whatever more, but he just does his he
[1:47:33] plows along and he lives by every word
[1:47:37] and he loves that message with all of
[1:47:39] his heart. I tell you one thing, he is
[1:47:41] going to prosper. Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; His children will prosper.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; His family will prosper.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not him that fell
[1:47:51] under such wonderful favor. It's the
[1:47:54] word, the son of God that is favored of
[1:47:58] the father and love of the father. And
[1:48:01] you that embrace him, you will fall
[1:48:06] under the same favor.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Am I being clear? Amen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; It's the word that's favored.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; So prosperity
[1:48:26] in the Old Testament
[1:48:28] referred to the realization of goals. As
[1:48:31] I said at the very beginning of the
[1:48:33] message, I'm going to be 10 minutes and
[1:48:35] then I'm going to close.
[1:48:38] The most important now here hear this
[1:48:40] closely. The most important to the
[1:48:42] Hebrews regarding prosperity was the
[1:48:46] spiritual dimension of prosperity. The
[1:48:49] spiritual aspect of prosperity.
[1:48:52] Eleazar's journey was made prosperous as
[1:48:57] he acted upon the word of Abraham and
[1:49:00] fulfilled his commission to bring a
[1:49:03] bride to Isaac. Eleazar was none other
[1:49:07] than the servant of this end time gone
[1:49:10] to get a bride. Now listen in in gen
[1:49:13] these are just selected verses. And the
[1:49:16] man Elazar sitting at the well wandering
[1:49:19] at her held his peace. He didn't say
[1:49:22] anything to whether the Lord had made
[1:49:25] his journey prosperous or not. He
[1:49:27] already had prayed. And here comes a
[1:49:30] young beautiful Rebecca and he's looking
[1:49:32] and he's wondering has God made his
[1:49:36] journey prosperous had nothing to do
[1:49:38] with material wealth their collection
[1:49:40] had to do with had he had he achieved
[1:49:42] his goal
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says in uh 20 40th verse
[1:49:47] of that 24th chapter and he said unto me
[1:49:50] he's relating it now and the lord before
[1:49:53] whom I walk will send his angel with
[1:49:55] thee and prosper thee prosper thy way,
[1:49:59] and thou shalt take a wife for my son of
[1:50:02] the kindred of my father's house." In
[1:50:04] the 42nd verse, and I came this day unto
[1:50:07] the well, and I said, Oh Lord, God of my
[1:50:09] master Abraham, if now thou will do
[1:50:13] prosper my way, if thou if now thou do
[1:50:17] prosper my way which I go,
[1:50:24] and then when they wanted him to remain,
[1:50:26] Eleazar said to them, "Hinder me not,
[1:50:29] seeing the Lord hath prospered." Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; He was looking for it
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; when he began to see the bride. I can
[1:50:37] tell you friends, I haven't got enough
[1:50:39] time this morning when brother Brandon
[1:50:40] preaching to the thousands, but he knew
[1:50:43] his message and his ministry was to call
[1:50:46] out a bride. And then as things began to
[1:50:48] change and and and and be he began to
[1:50:52] sense different things happening, he was
[1:50:54] looking and he began to wonder, now
[1:50:56] maybe is the time.
[1:50:59] Now perhaps this is the this is the time
[1:51:17] in Zurich, Switzerland.
[1:51:22] Brother Brandham said to the people
[1:51:24] in my own nation,
[1:51:27] in my office the other day, there were
[1:51:30] 400 major cities calling Africa and all
[1:51:35] over the world. A time of open doors, a
[1:51:40] time of of I will say a prosperous
[1:51:45] ministry as far as the world would would
[1:51:49] uh uh consider it. And in the in the
[1:51:52] message, faithful Abraham, he said, I've
[1:51:55] come at the invitation of this fine
[1:51:57] group of men, ministers of the city and
[1:52:00] all around because I felt led to come
[1:52:03] here. He said, there's places waiting
[1:52:07] that's got tens of thousands of people
[1:52:11] gather
[1:52:12] all overseas, hundreds of places
[1:52:15] overseas, major cities in America and
[1:52:19] around. One was 1955
[1:52:22] and this one was 1961
[1:52:25] 1963
[1:52:27] said Reverend Roy Borders takes care of
[1:52:29] the invitations and since Christmas the
[1:52:32] first of the year there's been over a
[1:52:34] thousand invitations around the world. A
[1:52:37] thousand invitations has come back
[1:52:41] there. So the Lord has to direct me then
[1:52:45] also in the in in just 1962. I'm just
[1:52:48] backing up. And the spoken word is the
[1:52:50] original seed. And for those of you that
[1:52:52] know that very lengthy message, it's
[1:52:54] it's it's very different. He says, and
[1:52:56] he says this, we believe that we're in
[1:52:58] the end time, do we?
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Do we do you believe that before you
[1:53:04] have a crop, now you have to plant a
[1:53:06] seed. He asked those two questions. He
[1:53:09] said, "You see why I've let churches
[1:53:12] turn me out.
[1:53:14] Tell me everything.
[1:53:16] call me all kinds of names and
[1:53:18] everything else and just stay right with
[1:53:23] the word.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; In investments then in 63
[1:53:29] he said we find all the other church
[1:53:33] ages Jesus was still in the church. All
[1:53:37] the six church ages Jesus was in the
[1:53:40] church. What's he doing is identifying
[1:53:43] his own ministry.
[1:53:46] Jesus was in the church but on the
[1:53:48] Leodysian age he was on the outside
[1:53:52] knocking trying to get in. This is the
[1:53:56] age
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; when the manifestation of Christ come so
[1:54:00] perfect in the image of Christ in his
[1:54:04] church until the churches as a brother
[1:54:07] said a while ago is closing the doors
[1:54:10] and yet he stands in love with love
[1:54:12] knocking. If any man hunger or thirst,
[1:54:16] he says, asks the people, do you
[1:54:18] understand? And he said, we expect
[1:54:22] a closed door.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; It's the Leodysian age, and the Bible
[1:54:28] said it would be that way.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning, friends?
[1:54:36] I said back in Joseph in Jesus life and
[1:54:40] his visit on earth and the manifestation
[1:54:42] of Jesus Christ according Luke 17:30
[1:54:46] and here here the prophet manifesting
[1:54:49] that goes to the scripture and
[1:54:52] translates it in what's happening in
[1:54:55] front of him and he says there's
[1:54:57] thousands uh hundreds of churches 400 a
[1:55:01] thousand invitation doors are open they
[1:55:04] wear in Jesus time everybody wanted this
[1:55:06] young prophet from Nazareth. But in his
[1:55:09] life as he began to bring the word now
[1:55:12] the prophet goes to Leodysian church age
[1:55:14] and says in all six he was inside the
[1:55:17] church. In the seventh he was outside
[1:55:19] the church. He said the doors are
[1:55:21] closing. I expect that.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; You know this isn't
[1:55:31] this isn't just watered down milk. Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; We expect that.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; What do we expect? Exactly the same
[1:55:41] thing.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; We don't expect to become more accepted.
[1:55:44] Don't expect to become more popular.
[1:55:47] Don't don't expect that the world will
[1:55:48] become uh uh more more palatable to us.
[1:55:52] Not at all. And we're not going to
[1:55:54] design the services just so they become
[1:55:56] palatable to the world. We're not
[1:55:58] interested in the world. We're
[1:55:59] interested in what the word says is to
[1:56:01] happen in our time.
[1:56:04] and happen in our life.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And what we are to manifest me for my
[1:56:09] part, this is the only son of God.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; There is none other. This revealed word
[1:56:14] is Jesus Christ.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's going to be loved
[1:56:18] by some, hated by others. It's going to
[1:56:21] be held in awe, going to be respected,
[1:56:24] and yet the people who respect him won't
[1:56:26] be able to receive him. And because he's
[1:56:28] living in you, in your flesh, you are
[1:56:31] going to experience these things.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; And we must not under any conditions be
[1:56:38] shocked when that happens. And it does
[1:56:40] happen on a regular basis.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely dumbfounded. People
[1:56:45] respect it to such a to such a degree.
[1:56:48] They they they see your home or see your
[1:56:51] family or see whatever. I said, "What is
[1:56:53] the matter with your mind?
[1:56:56] Why would you go in utter destruction?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Why do you go the way that you go and
[1:57:01] let Satan destroy you?
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Tell me people,
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; why would anyone want to do that?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help me.
[1:57:20] He gets to the seventh seal.
[1:57:24] Hey friends, I had I didn't dream this
[1:57:26] sermon up. It's come come come over a
[1:57:31] lot of days and a lot of thought, a lot
[1:57:33] of preparation. He gets to the seventh
[1:57:35] seal and he begins to speak things would
[1:57:38] be absolute mysteries to people and
[1:57:41] those that know the message and have
[1:57:43] received it, then you you can you can
[1:57:45] love. And he says, "Now, when this gets
[1:57:48] on tape," and you should do what I do,
[1:57:51] just read whatever came before that.
[1:57:54] This this is paragraph 325,
[1:58:00] I think, paragraph 567 or page 567, I'm
[1:58:04] sorry, paragraph 3. When this gets on
[1:58:06] tape, which it is, that'll probably send
[1:58:11] 10,000
[1:58:12] of my friends away from me. And they're
[1:58:17] going to say that brother Brandham's
[1:58:20] trying to make himself and make himself
[1:58:23] a servant or a prophet or something
[1:58:25] before God. And let me tell you, my
[1:58:27] brethren, that's an error.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the first part of it they did
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; he lost tens of thousands of his friends
[1:58:44] but they won't come down to the next
[1:58:46] part when he says that's an error.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to I wish that people
[1:58:52] would be honest at least I wish that
[1:58:54] they would give a man his day in court.
[1:58:56] All right.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I've had leaders, Pentecostal leaders in
[1:59:02] this office right here and hand me say,
[1:59:07] "Have you read this?" I looked at I
[1:59:09] said, "No." "What about this?" Look,
[1:59:12] they had all highlighted stuff. I said,
[1:59:14] "No, don't believe I've seen that
[1:59:16] either." "What about this?" "No, I don't
[1:59:19] think I've seen that one." "And this?"
[1:59:22] "Yeah, I've seen that one. I've read
[1:59:24] that." Oh. He said, "Do you know that
[1:59:29] you have the same understanding, the
[1:59:31] same belief of the Godhead that the
[1:59:33] Jehovah's Witnesses do?" I said, "No, I
[1:59:36] don't think so."
[1:59:38] He said, "You people believe that Jesus
[1:59:40] was that Jesus was created?" Well, I
[1:59:43] says, "The seed that he came from was
[1:59:45] Oh," he says, "Come on now." He said, I
[1:59:48] said, "Well, who was Jesus?" Jesus was
[1:59:50] God.
[1:59:52] I said, "I believe that.
[1:59:55] I believe that. I said,
[1:59:58] "Did your God come out of a woman's
[2:00:01] womb?"
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And did your God Did your God actually
[2:00:08] gasp? Your God, that's all that just
[2:00:11] God. Did he gasp his last breath on the
[2:00:15] cross and actually die? He died. Did
[2:00:18] your God go? Did Did your God die?
[2:00:21] And he stopped me silent. I said, 'You
[2:00:23] don't even know what you believe,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Said he was the manifestation
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; of God in the flesh.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; He was God's very God.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; And before Abraham was, I am.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "There's a man, one of
[2:00:44] our ministers downtown in Broadway
[2:00:46] Tabernacle. He really understands that
[2:00:48] Godhead." He says, "Would you meet him?"
[2:00:49] I said, 'Absolutely.
[2:00:51] happy to meet him. And the meeting was
[2:00:54] set up and somebody forgot it or
[2:00:56] canceled it. It wasn't me and it never
[2:00:58] happened.
[2:01:03] Then I said, "Have you got a minute?"
[2:01:07] I said, "I want to read a scripture to
[2:01:09] you." I said, "Have you ever heard of
[2:01:11] the serpent seed?"
[2:01:13] "No."
[2:01:14] I said, "I want to read Corinthians 11
[2:01:18] for you. Bear with me in my folly and
[2:01:21] indeed bear with me. Apostle Paul
[2:01:23] says,"For I'm jealous over you with a
[2:01:25] godly jealousy. For I have espoused you
[2:01:28] to one husband, even Christ, that you
[2:01:32] might be chasteed virgin to Christ." I
[2:01:35] said he's talking about virginity. He's
[2:01:37] talking about chastity. But I fear lest
[2:01:40] as the serpent, exactly as the serpent
[2:01:43] beguiled Eve. So your mind shall be
[2:01:46] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[2:01:48] Jesus that is in Christ. I says the
[2:01:51] original sin was a sexual sin. And he
[2:01:54] made about three four pages. He said,
[2:01:56] "Never heard of it in my life." I said,
[2:01:58] "Well, there's something for you to
[2:02:00] study." I said, "And if you don't
[2:02:02] believe that, you interpret those verses
[2:02:04] for me.
[2:02:06] You tell me
[2:02:10] what happened." I said, "Never heard of
[2:02:13] it.
[2:02:17] See friends,
[2:02:20] there is a power and a strength that
[2:02:23] maybe you don't realize and you really
[2:02:24] need to give a lot of thought to it.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; So I want to I want this word to live in
[2:02:29] me richly.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; You won't expect open doors all of the
[2:02:37] time. Doors are closing.
[2:02:45] The Bible tells us
[2:02:49] that even after Moses
[2:02:52] had met with God
[2:02:54] and God spoke to him from the burning
[2:02:57] bush, yet God allowed him hard times to
[2:03:01] buffet him and to knock him down and to
[2:03:04] have difficulty. And so I would take two
[2:03:08] parts. I said God
[2:03:11] prosperity
[2:03:14] as a favored son,
[2:03:17] prosperity
[2:03:19] in adversity.
[2:03:25] And God allowed Moses even after he had
[2:03:28] met God in such a reality knocked him
[2:03:31] down. The prophet said buffeted him,
[2:03:35] knocked him down and turned him around.
[2:03:38] And he got right up and said, "I know
[2:03:40] it's right. I met God, and I'm going to
[2:03:43] take I'm going to take them out yonder."
[2:03:46] Even because he had he had the I would
[2:03:49] say Moses prospered in that he was
[2:03:52] determined to achieve the commission
[2:03:55] that God had given him.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to ask yourself, I've come to
[2:04:01] the end here. I'm running out of time,
[2:04:02] but I want you to ask yourself, what did
[2:04:04] God elect me for?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; What did God choose me for?
[2:04:11] What is my calling in life?
[2:04:14] I will say for the most part, wherever
[2:04:18] you are, your calling in life is to be a
[2:04:21] vibrant
[2:04:24] manifestation
[2:04:27] of the word, the message.
[2:04:30] And you cannot do that unless you are a
[2:04:33] hearer of it
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; and a believer of it.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; I've got to take a few more minutes.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; It's only one service today.
[2:04:52] The price of our redemption
[2:04:55] required the bruising,
[2:04:58] the crushing of the rose of Sharon. And
[2:05:01] Isaiah describes it this way.
[2:05:04] He describes the bruising of Jesus
[2:05:07] Christ in a strange language. Listen
[2:05:09] very, very close.
[2:05:12] Yet it pleased the Lord
[2:05:16] to bruise him.
[2:05:18] It pleased the Lord. It is not that God
[2:05:21] stood back and while Jesus was suffering
[2:05:24] the ignaminious death on Calvary that
[2:05:27] God was uh you know rubbing his hands
[2:05:30] with glee and delight and saying I'm so
[2:05:33] pleased with that. That's not what it
[2:05:36] was. God
[2:05:39] without knowing a beginning or an ending
[2:05:42] could see beyond the price,
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; beyond the suffering,
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; beyond the pain and the agony, he could
[2:05:51] see beyond it. And when he when he could
[2:05:53] see what it was going to accomplish,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; listen friends,
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; I'm bring it down to you. Your many
[2:06:03] times things happen in your life and my
[2:06:06] life in our home and in our in our
[2:06:11] journey through life. Things happen and
[2:06:14] we say, "Why is this happening?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Why do I have to go through this?" But
[2:06:21] if you could see what is beyond that,
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; then you could even rejoice in the
[2:06:28] difficulty,
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; you could say, I know that my God is in
[2:06:34] control of my life,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; and I don't know what this is doing, but
[2:06:39] I have confidence that the word
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; that I have embraced
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; and that I love
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; will come to its accomplishment.
[2:06:51] Because that word is ordained to
[2:06:54] prosper.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; You may have nothing in the world
[2:06:59] materially or you may have much in the
[2:07:02] world materially. It's completely
[2:07:04] irrelevant.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; One might be a a person doesn't know
[2:07:09] where their next meal is coming from.
[2:07:12] One person may be healthy and the next
[2:07:14] person is sickly. That is irrelevant.
[2:07:19] whatever we're going but it is what is
[2:07:21] the condition of the word in your life.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you
[2:07:29] the word of God is ordained to prosper.
[2:07:35] Amen.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; I know this will be misunderstood,
[2:07:45] but when I was under the
[2:07:49] influence
[2:07:52] and people had given me a very very
[2:07:55] negative
[2:07:58] report concerning brother William
[2:08:00] Brandham.
[2:08:02] And I was a young minister of 27,
[2:08:07] 26 when I wrote the letter
[2:08:10] and invited him to come up to the north
[2:08:13] country where I was still living. And
[2:08:14] then I left and brother Brett and an
[2:08:17] became the pastor of that church.
[2:08:20] And I came down here and I was just
[2:08:22] three weeks in Victoria and I got the
[2:08:24] letter. After 18 months, I got a
[2:08:28] response. Had he'd like to come up and
[2:08:30] maybe hunt if we could arrange the hunt.
[2:08:34] In my heart
[2:08:36] were huge. I can say three questions.
[2:08:38] Listen friends, they were like lead
[2:08:41] weights in my heart.
[2:08:44] And the only thing I knew, I'd seen
[2:08:46] something in this man's ministry.
[2:08:49] And I did believe that the angel of the
[2:08:52] Lord who I didn't know at that time was
[2:08:54] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:08:57] I knew that an angel I could not escape
[2:09:00] the blind girl being healed. Could never
[2:09:03] escape. And I couldn't escape the
[2:09:05] presence that I sensed in those
[2:09:07] meetings.
[2:09:09] And I was around other ministers. I
[2:09:11] think the best in the country.
[2:09:14] And we were just going out to the pulpit
[2:09:16] in one service and two ministers got
[2:09:19] into a row.
[2:09:21] They got into a bitter dispute about
[2:09:23] something. I don't remember what it is.
[2:09:25] And that dispute was so sharp and I was
[2:09:29] so wounded that I broke into sobs and
[2:09:33] tears. There just the three of us in the
[2:09:35] office.
[2:09:37] I just was so broken I couldn't hardly
[2:09:40] go out into the service. And I thought I
[2:09:44] is is this and these men are now going
[2:09:46] to go out in the platform before the
[2:09:49] people and this is the atmosphere
[2:09:51] they've just come out of. And I was I
[2:09:55] was like a child. I was just I'm on the
[2:09:57] verge of tears now. I remember it so
[2:09:58] well. I was just so broken. And then
[2:10:01] I've been around other ministers and
[2:10:04] heard them, you know, tell stories and
[2:10:05] tell jokes and so on and hehaw and laugh
[2:10:08] and some of them were kind of colored.
[2:10:11] I've walked out
[2:10:15] of places where so-called Christians
[2:10:18] were when off-colored stories were told
[2:10:21] by ministers.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; I got my family up and walked out. Tell
[2:10:26] you friends, those things register very
[2:10:29] very deep on my heart. And that's the
[2:10:31] state I was in.
[2:10:33] That's the condition I was in when I
[2:10:36] finally met brother Brandon personally.
[2:10:38] And to me, he was not one that I was
[2:10:40] going to have interpret the word to me.
[2:10:42] And I said in my young heart,
[2:10:47] if he tries to circumvent the word of
[2:10:50] God,
[2:10:52] our friendship is over.
[2:10:58] That's how serious it was to me.
[2:11:06] And looking back,
[2:11:08] listen close. I'm not just telling a
[2:11:10] story.
[2:11:14] Here is how here's the summary. And I
[2:11:18] hope you understand this.
[2:11:20] I regarded brother Brandham as a man of
[2:11:24] God
[2:11:26] with beliefs and doctrines that I did
[2:11:28] not understand.
[2:11:31] And furthermore, I didn't believe that
[2:11:33] the stories have been told me was
[2:11:34] correct.
[2:11:37] So, I put them aside. I said, "He's a
[2:11:39] man of God,
[2:11:41] and I know that he's got people pulling
[2:11:43] at him from all over.
[2:11:46] I just want to give him a rest.
[2:11:50] That's all I want to do. I want to give
[2:11:52] him a rest. And I will not trouble him.
[2:11:55] I will not ask him a bunch of questions
[2:11:57] that I did not." And he came to Grand
[2:12:00] Prairie and he came to Dawson Creek. and
[2:12:03] brother brother Ba actually you'll hear
[2:12:05] his voice leading the song service
[2:12:09] in that Dawson Creek series
[2:12:12] and we get in the car and we'd be
[2:12:14] starting to travel but as the people
[2:12:16] walked past people from my own church
[2:12:19] walked past and he told them they told
[2:12:22] sister Clint something told this sister
[2:12:24] something and this other sister and
[2:12:26] different people and and and and brother
[2:12:29] Paul Corny standing right beside me and
[2:12:31] a whole line of people around the church
[2:12:33] like that coming up for prayer and
[2:12:35] brother Brandham's becoming weak and and
[2:12:38] he may most of you have never heard this
[2:12:41] and he's getting weak and he's just
[2:12:43] weaving a wee bit and he's speaking to
[2:12:46] people and I I just don't know about the
[2:12:49] doctrine. I don't know what he what he
[2:12:51] teaches. All I know is what he's saying
[2:12:52] to these people is true because I know
[2:12:54] those people.
[2:12:56] And then he says, "The boy will be all
[2:12:58] right." And just keeps and turns right
[2:13:01] around, keeps talking to the person in
[2:13:03] front of him. And it was, believe me
[2:13:05] now, there's no imagination, a force
[2:13:10] went past like that. Brother Paul
[2:13:12] Cornish is a tall, dignified theologian,
[2:13:15] Bible school teacher. And he just went
[2:13:18] like this. He was standing right here
[2:13:19] beside me. He just went like this.
[2:13:23] And he was sobbing, sobbing. And I
[2:13:26] thought, "What? What's happening?" I
[2:13:28] felt it. It just went past me. And here
[2:13:31] he is. Here they yelled. I had to even
[2:13:33] think what it was. The boy will be all
[2:13:35] right. Now, who's he talking about?
[2:13:36] Who's the boy? Why is this pastor like
[2:13:39] that? And after a few minutes, and
[2:13:41] brother Brandham carries right on like
[2:13:42] nothing happened. And after a few
[2:13:45] minutes or a few moments, Brother
[2:13:47] Cornish stands up, pokes me on the arm.
[2:13:50] He said, "Brother Eddie, you see that
[2:13:54] boy down the end of the line? I think he
[2:13:56] was third from the end or something like
[2:13:57] that. Just from the end, that boy
[2:14:00] teenager." I said, "Yes." He said,
[2:14:02] "That's my son." He said, "He's up for
[2:14:05] an operation this next week." And that
[2:14:09] was what he re I thought, "What? What is
[2:14:10] that? What realm is that? What dimension
[2:14:13] is that man in? Where is he?"
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Just standing there and hear a boy down
[2:14:17] there. The boy will be all right. And
[2:14:18] the man is collapsing and convulsing
[2:14:20] with tears and he carries on. What kind
[2:14:22] of dimension is that in?
[2:14:28] And we had the next day were on the on
[2:14:31] the trip. And you that have heard my How
[2:14:33] many here have not heard I'm a witness?
[2:14:37] You've not heard I'm a witness that
[2:14:39] testimony. My testimony.
[2:14:41] Okay. Most all have. God bless you.
[2:14:45] on there. The next day, we're driving
[2:14:47] past Brother Brett and Sister Anne's
[2:14:50] hometown where they had lived and
[2:14:51] farmed.
[2:14:53] And we're just driving past and the
[2:14:56] first the first exit into the town is
[2:14:58] here. Brother Brand was driving. He's
[2:15:00] slowing down. Said there was a woman
[2:15:05] uh in the prayer line yesterday.
[2:15:08] He said, I believe she was from Fort St.
[2:15:10] John. She was praying for a man from
[2:15:12] Fort St. John. Oh, I said, "Brother
[2:15:15] Brandham," I said, "That happens to be
[2:15:17] an old family friend of my mother and
[2:15:19] dad." And I said, "She's uh yeah, I know
[2:15:22] her real well." And he said, "She's
[2:15:25] praying for a man dying with cancer."
[2:15:27] And he's just driving slowly now because
[2:15:29] there's a speed limit. Driving slowly.
[2:15:31] Old farmhouse amongst the service
[2:15:33] stations and motel. Old farmhouse where
[2:15:36] the US Army caught a highway straight
[2:15:38] through the farm and that big old white
[2:15:40] house sat there and knew it ever since I
[2:15:41] was a little boy. And we're just driving
[2:15:44] past and he says he he he just goes like
[2:15:47] this like he's in another realm and he
[2:15:49] throws his arm behind my head now. But
[2:15:51] he says the man's in that house
[2:15:55] in that same presence
[2:15:59] and the devil is always right there. You
[2:16:02] know the devil is just as real and he's
[2:16:05] just as active. And as soon as I Brother
[2:16:09] Brandham said that, a voice said to me,
[2:16:12] "How do you know he's in that house?"
[2:16:16] So, would you doubt that? Oh, tell you
[2:16:19] what, there's doubts are always around.
[2:16:21] And I got up 375 miles up the Alaskan
[2:16:26] Highway and I'm talking to brother Bud
[2:16:28] Southwick, 375 miles up the highway. And
[2:16:31] I start to tell brother Southwick about
[2:16:33] Brother Brand. I'm pointing to that
[2:16:34] house. And Bud says, "Well, that's true.
[2:16:38] I know the man. I've known him ever
[2:16:40] since I've been a child. And I also know
[2:16:42] that he's dying with cancer." So, I had
[2:16:45] it on the platform, had it driving past
[2:16:47] the man's house, and now had it
[2:16:51] up up there in Brother Southwick's
[2:16:54] little trailer.
[2:16:57] And I'll say this, this is where I
[2:16:59] wanted to come to. And I hope you have
[2:17:01] time.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:03] I can say all I wanted to do was to be
[2:17:06] good to the servant of God. That's all I
[2:17:10] wanted to do. And I can tell you
[2:17:14] from that time
[2:17:17] as I gave myself to the word
[2:17:21] and soon as we had the little house
[2:17:24] and there's brother Don Alexander and a
[2:17:26] few that are here and sister Gerta were
[2:17:28] in that house
[2:17:31] and the first thing I wanted to do and
[2:17:33] the young people come in. I said just
[2:17:36] get those tapes and listen to those
[2:17:37] tapes. I knew those tapes had something
[2:17:39] I couldn't give them. Let's get those
[2:17:41] tapes. And I just saw young men, young
[2:17:43] women delivered and changed and coming
[2:17:46] off the streets and coming out of the
[2:17:48] flames of hell. What was it, friends?
[2:17:51] And people said, and then I had the
[2:17:52] Anglican minister and they they were
[2:17:54] hoping and other churches in the
[2:17:56] community hoping that I would just sift
[2:17:57] somehow these young people into their
[2:17:59] churches because they could see they
[2:18:01] could see there was a life. They could
[2:18:04] see there was a power. You know what the
[2:18:05] Anglican minister came over to my house?
[2:18:07] You know what he said to me? He said,
[2:18:08] "We have a coffee house in the
[2:18:10] basement." when he says they're they're
[2:18:11] right out they're out and under the
[2:18:13] trees. He said having drugs and sex and
[2:18:17] he was sick and what is it that you
[2:18:20] have? And he was hoping that our young
[2:18:21] people kind of help their young people.
[2:18:25] No, that's not what it's all about.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; And it took me some time to realize this
[2:18:31] has nothing to do with me.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with me. And I
[2:18:36] saw the place pack out. Saw the log
[2:18:38] church built. Saw how it was built. I
[2:18:41] could write books about it. Saw how it
[2:18:43] became packed out. How the people were
[2:18:46] children sleeping on the floor. Couldn't
[2:18:48] even move. Couldn't even get out of the
[2:18:50] foyer. Couldn't hardly move. And saw
[2:18:53] that happen. Saw this place happen. And
[2:18:56] what is happening today? I remember the
[2:18:57] first day I walked out here. Saw the
[2:18:59] people that were sitting here. I thought
[2:19:02] we're going to be raptured. This place
[2:19:03] is going to be empty.
[2:19:06] And I'll tell you what, friends,
[2:19:09] I'm going to make an announcement right
[2:19:10] now. This has nothing to do with brother
[2:19:14] Ed Biscll's ministry.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; This has something to do with the
[2:19:18] prosperity of the word of God.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; And God is not going to allow that word
[2:19:25] to fail. It shall accomplish what it has
[2:19:30] been sent to do because it is the word
[2:19:34] that is prospering. No man's ministry is
[2:19:37] prospering. The word is prospering. And
[2:19:40] I say that to you, you brothers, you
[2:19:42] husbands, you families, God's word is
[2:19:45] ordained to prosper. You live by it. You
[2:19:48] embrace it. You hold to it. And whatever
[2:19:51] happens in life, say, "Thank God."
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; However he leads me.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Gives me much, gives me nothing. Just
[2:19:59] live for him. Live for this word. Put
[2:20:02] this word out before you and be good to
[2:20:05] it.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sisters,
[2:20:09] there's a lot of things I can't promise
[2:20:11] be. I can tell you one thing. Your life
[2:20:13] will be fulfilled. You'll have such a
[2:20:16] feeling. And if God should call me off
[2:20:17] the scene, I can tell you one thing. I
[2:20:20] go a happy man.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; I thank God. I thank God for the family
[2:20:25] of God. I thank God that God's allowed
[2:20:27] me to walk with you. I'm glad that you
[2:20:31] are here. I'm glad for the atmosphere of
[2:20:34] the congregation. And you that have
[2:20:37] recently come, we receive you in the
[2:20:39] name of Jesus Christ. And if God ever
[2:20:41] calls you to go elsewhere, I say God
[2:20:43] bless you. But go wherever the word is
[2:20:46] put forth
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; first. Amen.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; And there is no big eyes in the
[2:20:52] ministry.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; There is no big ministries in this
[2:20:55] message.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you, great men and great women
[2:21:01] are those that put the word forth first.
[2:21:04] [Applause]
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; I appreciate what God has done in your
[2:21:11] lives. I appreciate the testimony of God
[2:21:14] in the supernatural in your lives. And I
[2:21:18] pray God will ever ever bless you and
[2:21:21] that you shall prosper as you put
[2:21:22] forward forth and and put put the word
[2:21:25] first in everything. Amen.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I've been much longer than I wanted to
[2:21:29] be. We have a baptismal and perhaps the
[2:21:32] sister can just get ready now. And I
[2:21:35] would like to sing once again
[2:21:37] if they would come please. Uh I'd like
[2:21:41] to sing more of you once again. Then I
[2:21:43] want to sing I'm a new creation. I'm a
[2:21:46] brand new man. Old things have passed
[2:21:48] away. I've been born again. You
[2:21:51] understand, friends?
[2:21:52] [Music]
[2:21:55] I have much more that I want to say. And
[2:21:56] I could have come here and blow it all
[2:21:58] out at once, but I feel it's important I
[2:22:01] lay some of these principles down and
[2:22:04] tell you from my heart to your heart.
[2:22:08] Live by every word of God that he makes
[2:22:12] known, makes real to you. Let's bow our
[2:22:14] heads in prayer, please. and we shall
[2:22:17] stand. Change your position.
[2:22:21] Dear Father,
[2:22:23] we've attempted
[2:22:26] by the Holy Ghost
[2:22:28] to speak those things that you've made.
[2:22:31] So real. I've declared today, Lord, that
[2:22:34] your word, your word has been sent to
[2:22:37] prosper,
[2:22:39] and it shall prosper. It shall
[2:22:41] accomplish.
[2:22:42] It is full. It is rich with mercy and
[2:22:45] grace.
[2:22:47] And in a congregation of this size and
[2:22:50] the congregation that is on the
[2:22:51] internet, it's not possible. But what
[2:22:54] there is great needs and serious needs
[2:22:59] and the people have come. Lord, they've
[2:23:01] gathered. I pray they will not have to
[2:23:03] go out with the same need, but that your
[2:23:06] word will go and minister to them now.
[2:23:09] Send your word and heal them, Lord. Heal
[2:23:13] the home, heal the life.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Heal, oh God, not only physically but
[2:23:19] spiritually. And I pray that you will
[2:23:22] instill a determination
[2:23:25] within men and women, oh God, of all
[2:23:28] ages, that they will give themselves
[2:23:31] unreservedly
[2:23:33] to the word that you have made alive and
[2:23:36] living and real in this day.
[2:23:39] Oh God, allow this people, I pray, to be
[2:23:43] in full support of what they hear. Lord,
[2:23:46] I pray that they will be in full support
[2:23:48] of what you are doing. And we're so
[2:23:50] thankful that a young sister is being
[2:23:52] baptized today. You've moved upon her
[2:23:55] heart and the waters here and she will
[2:23:58] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:24:00] Jesus Christ. Pray you'll move on
[2:24:02] others, oh God, throughout the
[2:24:04] congregation, Lord. whatever their need
[2:24:06] is, may their confession change from a
[2:24:09] negative to a positive confession in
[2:24:11] Jesus Christ's name. I commit the word
[2:24:14] spoken to you now. And Lord, you confirm
[2:24:16] it. If it is the truth, then you will
[2:24:19] confirm it. It is your word. We thank
[2:24:22] you, Lord Jesus. We love you. We want
[2:24:26] more of you.
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:45] Lord,
[2:24:47] you
[2:24:52] I
[2:24:56] might
[2:24:59] Are
[2:25:01] you
[2:25:04] [Music]
[2:25:10] my
[2:25:13] but
[2:25:15] I
[2:25:17] [Music]
[2:25:25] Lord hear my
[2:25:28] I
[2:25:30] you
[2:25:37] are you
[2:25:44] are you
[2:25:54] I
[2:25:57] for
[2:25:59] you.
[2:26:04] All things I have my
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:13] heart
[2:26:16] [Music]
[2:26:19] and
[2:26:22] Lord hear my prayer
[2:26:25] for
[2:26:27] you.
[2:26:30] It might be that you would like to blend
[2:26:33] a prayer with me. Say, "Lord, let me
[2:26:36] thirst after you until it is exactly, as
[2:26:40] the prophet of God has said, a painful
[2:26:42] experience. I want to thirst after you."
[2:26:45] For you said, "Blessed are they that
[2:26:47] hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[2:26:50] What does it say? They shall be filled.
[2:26:56] Oh God. Oh God.
[2:27:00] What a glorious thing that we can hunger
[2:27:04] and thirst. Doesn't have to be some big
[2:27:07] excitement. I just hunger after you, oh
[2:27:09] God. There's something that I need from
[2:27:12] you. Would you come now and provide
[2:27:15] that? I'm praying more
[2:27:19] of you.
[2:27:21] This is our prayer, Lord.
[2:27:25] More
[2:27:27] of you.
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:33] I have all
[2:27:37] I
[2:27:38] need
[2:27:40] is for
[2:27:42] you.
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:48] All things I am
[2:27:51] [Music]
[2:28:06] Lord hear my prayer
[2:28:09] for
[2:28:12] you.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man.
[2:28:20] I'm a new creation.
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:26] [Applause]
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:36] for
[2:28:44] that's why I am
[2:28:48] a new creation.
[2:28:53] I'm a brand new man.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; I want to know if the congregation got a
[2:28:59] hold of the theme of the service this
[2:29:01] morning.
[2:29:03] God's word.
[2:29:05] God has sent forth this word and it is
[2:29:08] ordained. I declare with my last breath
[2:29:12] on earth if needs be. It is ordained to
[2:29:16] prosper.
[2:29:18] It shall accomplish what has been sent
[2:29:20] to do. And as you receive it within your
[2:29:24] own being and let it work out throughout
[2:29:26] your your uh uh your enablement or your
[2:29:30] facility, the body that God gave you,
[2:29:34] you shall prosper. Your home shall
[2:29:37] prosper. Hallelujah. Your family shall
[2:29:41] prosper. Glory to God. And in the face
[2:29:45] of defeat, in the face of adversity, in
[2:29:48] the midst of your prison, you shall
[2:29:50] prosper.
[2:29:53] because it's the word that's ordained to
[2:29:55] come to its conclusion. Amen.
[2:29:59] Hallelujah.
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:02] All things have passed away
[2:30:07] and born again.
[2:30:09] I wish him for
[2:30:28] the people said hallelujah.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Natalie Fzen standing here
[2:30:38] this morning because God has dealt with
[2:30:40] her.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe the sun of prosperity
[2:30:45] is shining upon the freezing home.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said this in Matthew
[2:30:55] 3 verse 11 says, "I indeed baptize you
[2:30:59] with water into repentance,
[2:31:02] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[2:31:04] than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[2:31:07] bear.
[2:31:09] He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[2:31:12] and with fire."
[2:31:14] It's a tremendous thing to understand
[2:31:17] what God is doing in people's lives.
[2:31:20] There was a whole Chicago set of
[2:31:22] meetings. Brother Bram talked about
[2:31:23] having a revival
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; and we just had camp and brother Bram
[2:31:29] said they had a revival in Chicago and
[2:31:32] that revival was one little girl
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; gave her heart to Christ
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; and walked on with God. And I believe
[2:31:40] Natalie, you're our little revival.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost and fire come down
[2:31:45] and burn your life.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You tell the people what you told
[2:31:50] me. You said that the Lord dealt with
[2:31:52] you and you felt what kind of pull. When
[2:31:56] did that happen?
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Last year at camp.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Last year at camp. I asked Natalie. I
[2:32:02] said, "Natalie, do you know that the
[2:32:04] Lord's come to your life?" She said, "I
[2:32:05] do. He came to my life last year at
[2:32:08] camp." And I said, 'Well, how come you
[2:32:10] weren't baptized until now? She says,
[2:32:12] 'It's now I feel the pull.'
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; And I say, 'May God so pull you into the
[2:32:19] kingdom of God, Natalie. So baptize you
[2:32:22] with the Holy Ghost and fire. And may
[2:32:24] God ever be present leading your life.
[2:32:26] Let's pray.
[2:32:29] Put your hands together.
[2:32:34] Lord, a great joy this morning. Sister
[2:32:38] Reena, Brother A can rejoice and truly
[2:32:42] say the sun of prosperity has arisen and
[2:32:46] shone upon their home this day. Natalie
[2:32:50] stands here, Lord, because she has felt
[2:32:53] the pull of God. She desires that the
[2:32:56] fire would fall, that the Holy Ghost
[2:32:59] would so fill her soul. Lord, she's
[2:33:02] committed her life to you. Wants to be a
[2:33:06] light for you. Desires, Lord, that your
[2:33:09] glory would fill her temple and be led
[2:33:13] by your spirit. Father, I commit this
[2:33:16] soul into your divine care. Lord, lead
[2:33:20] her faithfully. We pray for when the
[2:33:23] spirit of truth has come, you shall lead
[2:33:25] her, Lord, into all truth. Great
[2:33:28] baptizer, baptize her now. We pray in
[2:33:32] Jesus name. And sister Natalie, by your
[2:33:35] confession that Jesus Christ is your
[2:33:37] savior, I baptize you in the name of our
[2:33:40] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:33:44] [Music]
[2:33:51] [Applause]
[2:33:57] Well, last year after camp, I think it
[2:33:59] was about 36
[2:34:01] someone's baptized. I guess they all got
[2:34:03] baptized last year. Oh, they come up.
[2:34:06] I'm
[2:34:08] I tell you what, it's uh just such a joy
[2:34:12] to see
[2:34:14] those that are coming. And last year, a
[2:34:17] year ago, it was just such a different
[2:34:20] atmosphere. and everybody noticed it.
[2:34:23] But I said, "Well, what's happened?" Of
[2:34:25] course, those that came in just there
[2:34:28] were a lot of new ones, just beginners,
[2:34:30] you know, they just can't got up into
[2:34:32] into the senior camp a year ago and now
[2:34:36] they're a year older and they've
[2:34:37] experienced a lot of things and it was
[2:34:39] really wonderful. And I've had others
[2:34:42] I've said I've had visitors say to me,
[2:34:44] "It's so marvelous just to see young men
[2:34:48] and young women rising up and taking
[2:34:51] their place." And uh it's so wonderful.
[2:34:55] Hallelujah.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm I'm just so tickled
[2:34:59] about it. So pleased with it. Amen. Uh
[2:35:06] I'm going to sing a song or have you
[2:35:08] sing a song. faith of our fathers living
[2:35:10] still. And I don't know if Matthew would
[2:35:14] like to or could sing with that uh group
[2:35:17] that sang when they sing a song like
[2:35:19] that. I think hearing it twice is if I
[2:35:22] heard it on a CD or something, I'd want
[2:35:24] to hear it again. And maybe they could
[2:35:26] get ready and just sing it again for us.
[2:35:28] I I think it's marvelous. If the group
[2:35:30] could come and sing it if it's possible,
[2:35:32] fine. And if it's not possible, that's
[2:35:35] fine also. But we'll sing uh faith of
[2:35:37] our fathers living still. Why don't we
[2:35:40] stand as we sing? And we can't sing this
[2:35:42] song sitting down.
[2:35:50] of our father
[2:35:54] living
[2:35:55] still
[2:35:57] his
[2:36:01] fire
[2:36:08] [Music]
[2:36:10] with
[2:36:16] that glorious
[2:36:19] Earth.
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:29] We will be true to the children.
[2:36:37] Our father changing
[2:36:41] praise and dark
[2:36:49] and
[2:36:51] free.
[2:36:54] How sweet would be their children
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:18] we will be
[2:37:21] to thee. We
[2:37:26] faith on our
[2:37:31] We will
[2:37:37] fall
[2:37:38] in
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:47] love
[2:37:51] by kindly words
[2:37:54] and
[2:37:58] Oh,
[2:38:07] we will be true to Jesus.
[2:38:14] [Applause]
[2:38:17] This last week, we took our brother
[2:38:21] Brian and sister Jenny over to Vancouver
[2:38:24] Island.
[2:38:26] And uh
[2:38:28] in Victoria, for those of you that have
[2:38:30] been there, you know they have all kinds
[2:38:32] of people
[2:38:34] selling their wares and doing their
[2:38:36] things right on the inner harbor.
[2:38:39] And at the end, right in front of the
[2:38:40] parliament buildings, they always have
[2:38:42] native Indian people that are there and
[2:38:46] they're doing the different things, bead
[2:38:47] work, etc., etc.
[2:38:50] And my wife says, "I always like to know
[2:38:52] where people are from." And
[2:38:55] I try to urge her to stop asking people
[2:39:00] questions because we get into big
[2:39:02] conversations and I'm I'm the I'm the
[2:39:06] impatient one in the family. I want to
[2:39:07] keep moving.
[2:39:09] says, "I just love to know where this
[2:39:12] these young fellas are from."
[2:39:15] Uh, so anyway, she steps up,
[2:39:20] starts talking, and so I step up. Both
[2:39:23] of them are sitting there. One has got a
[2:39:25] face that he's been through. Terrible,
[2:39:27] terrible life. So, beaten, broken. You
[2:39:30] can see his face has been broken and
[2:39:31] disfigured.
[2:39:33] And uh, I've seen that scene many times.
[2:39:36] And so she's talking to this one fellow
[2:39:38] and she asked him
[2:39:41] where are you from? Oh, he said just a
[2:39:44] little place up, you know, up at the
[2:39:46] island.
[2:39:48] But but what what village? He said.
[2:39:52] Oh, she said we've been to Clue many
[2:39:55] times. And then I stepped closer
[2:39:57] and she said, "Do you know Jack
[2:40:00] Patrick?" Because Jack Patrick was the
[2:40:01] chief and the pastor.
[2:40:04] said, ' Do you know Jack Patrick? He
[2:40:06] said, ' It's my grandfather.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; And so then I stepped up. I said, cuz
[2:40:13] Pinky was one of his sons. I said, "Do
[2:40:17] you know Pinky?" He said, "He's my dad."
[2:40:22] I said, "Your dad when he was 18 carved
[2:40:25] me a totem pole, which I still have."
[2:40:31] Oh. And then they began to and this
[2:40:33] other fellow was wanting to kind of turn
[2:40:34] away, you know, and he'd look at us for
[2:40:36] a bit and then they were sitting right
[2:40:38] together.
[2:40:40] So, um, I said, "We've been to your
[2:40:43] place many times. We stayed in your
[2:40:45] house, in your grandfather's house. We
[2:40:48] slept there and stayed there."
[2:40:51] And I said, uh,
[2:40:53] it was his father that we walked
[2:40:57] together after a series of meetings when
[2:40:59] I preached there. And he went walking
[2:41:01] with me out on the ocean, climbing over
[2:41:04] the big rocks. And he was picking and I
[2:41:06] was helping him pick the sea urchins and
[2:41:09] he'd crack them open and eat that egg
[2:41:11] that's in there, you know, that big
[2:41:12] purple sea urchin. And uh, I ate most
[2:41:15] everything. I couldn't get to that.
[2:41:18] And then the big sea slugs, they would
[2:41:20] get those big sea slugs and boil them.
[2:41:22] They'd turn orange and eat the inside of
[2:41:23] that. And and I never got that victory
[2:41:26] either.
[2:41:28] So I it was his dad and I was just
[2:41:31] leaving the last time I remember. I was
[2:41:34] just leaving
[2:41:36] and there you know the Indian people
[2:41:38] don't have many words and he just said
[2:41:41] I'm going to miss you and that just like
[2:41:44] stabbed my heart. That was my last
[2:41:45] memory of his dad. He said, "My dad's
[2:41:48] living in a hotel over here." And then I
[2:41:51] said, "Well, we've been different, you
[2:41:53] know, the Nitnet Bamfield and different
[2:41:56] house it over to Al Bernie." I said, "We
[2:41:59] know the the Dick family, Allan." And uh
[2:42:04] just forget their name now. His mother,
[2:42:05] his his wife, brother and sister Dick.
[2:42:08] He said, "That's" and then this fellow
[2:42:10] was all twisted up. He says, "That's my
[2:42:12] grandparents.
[2:42:14] Oh, I said, 'Well, we were to Agnes
[2:42:16] Dick's funeral. He said, "Yeah." He
[2:42:19] said, "When you stepped up here, I
[2:42:20] recognized you." He said, "I remember
[2:42:23] you being at her funeral." They said,
[2:42:25] "Our girls sang at the funeral." She He
[2:42:27] said, "Yeah, I remember that, too." And
[2:42:29] there we were just out of the masses of
[2:42:32] people, two two grandsons of people that
[2:42:38] we both ministered to all their for all
[2:42:42] that time and their parents were in
[2:42:45] brother Bram's meetings and I thought
[2:42:48] that was a great joy.
[2:42:51] Amen. You may be seated
[2:42:54] with Matthew.
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:28] Hallelujah.
[2:43:34] [Music]
[2:43:39] Joseph
[2:43:40] lived a life
[2:43:44] of hurt and hatred.
[2:43:51] And even his own family brought him
[2:43:58] pain.
[2:44:04] And when his brothers
[2:44:08] thought that he would surely
[2:44:12] seek revenge,
[2:44:16] he said, "I have seen
[2:44:19] God's purpose now
[2:44:22] [Music]
[2:44:23] made plain."
[2:44:26] It was the tender
[2:44:29] hand
[2:44:33] [Music]
[2:44:35] over.
[2:44:40] I look back and see.
[2:44:44] He was always
[2:44:47] leading
[2:44:48] me.
[2:44:50] [Music]
[2:44:52] The word was meant for me. Oh, God has
[2:44:59] used to show me his great love. I now
[2:45:06] understand
[2:45:09] the tender hand of
[2:45:13] Jehovah.
[2:45:16] [Music]
[2:45:19] Many Jews were killed
[2:45:24] and saw us under.
[2:45:27] [Music]
[2:45:30] And
[2:45:31] it seemed that God had left his very
[2:45:38] own.
[2:45:39] [Music]
[2:45:42] Oh, but through it all,
[2:45:46] God had a plan.
[2:45:50] Little did they know,
[2:45:55] oh, that he would lead all of his
[2:45:58] children
[2:46:01] back home.
[2:46:03] [Music]
[2:46:07] So how can I deny
[2:46:12] his great hand of mercy?
[2:46:16] Oh
[2:46:19] trles they came and they left no reason
[2:46:24] why
[2:46:27] [Applause]
[2:46:31] and say
[2:46:33] that everything
[2:46:36] has worked out for my go.
[2:46:41] Oh, he has all he has the answers for my
[2:46:48] life.
[2:46:51] It was the table.
[2:46:55] [Music]
[2:47:04] I look back and see
[2:47:08] he was always leading
[2:47:12] me
[2:47:16] and what was made for me. Oh God has
[2:47:22] used to show me his love. I now
[2:47:28] understand
[2:47:32] the hand of Jehovah
[2:47:40] was made for me
[2:47:46] to show
[2:47:49] his love. I now understand.
[2:47:57] I now understand.
[2:48:02] [Music]
[2:48:02] [Applause]
[2:48:07] [Music]
[2:48:14] Your hand
[2:48:16] [Applause]
[2:48:18] tender hand.
[2:48:21] Oh,
[2:48:28] [Music]
[2:48:32] [Applause]
[2:48:37] sometimes it takes a while before we
[2:48:39] understand that tender hand of Jehovah.
[2:48:42] Brother Tony, would you come and dismiss
[2:48:44] us in prayer? Let's rise to our feet.
