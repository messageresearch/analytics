[17:13] open the service
[17:16] in a word of prayer.
[17:20] Amen. Do you feel his presence? I
[17:22] believe he's here. It doesn't matter
[17:23] what what you may be struggling with,
[17:28] whatever sickness you may have.
[17:31] I don't know about you, but I know a God
[17:35] &gt;&gt; that can meet all of our needs.

[17:43] I'm just so thankful that you chose to
[17:45] come meet with us this morning.
[17:48] Hallelujah.

[17:51] requests.
[17:55] Brother Milco has quest here. We want to
[17:59] pray for brother Darko and and his
[18:01] family
[18:03] in Ziggbette. They are in a great
[18:06] spiritual need and they've asked the
[18:08] church to pray for them. Also, brother
[18:10] Don Alexander has
[18:13] just written our prayer. We want to
[18:15] remember Dave Daniels as he has a severe
[18:19] head and chest cold. So we want to
[18:21] remember him in prayer. If you have a
[18:22] need on your heart, just raise your hand
[18:25] as we go to prayer. Amen. Brother
[18:27] Burkart, if you would if you would come.
[18:37] Let's bow our hearts and our heads.
[18:42] Dear God, Father,

[18:48] what a atmosphere we are in, Lord. You
[18:52] have come down and
[18:54] to fellowship with us, Lord. You have
[18:57] chosen a vessel this morning, a
[19:00] ministering angel, Father, where you
[19:02] come through and speak to our hearts,
[19:04] Lord.
[19:06] Father, we lay ourselves on the altar of
[19:09] sacrifice, Father, and may your Holy
[19:12] Spirit consume us with fire and burn all
[19:16] the tr out of us, Father. We know we are
[19:18] living at the very last time, Father.
[19:21] And we don't want to slack behind. We
[19:24] want to receive every word, Father.
[19:27] Obedient to every word that titles us to
[19:29] the token, and we claim it. We apply the
[19:33] token to our families and to our loved
[19:35] ones, Lord. Father, that the last ones
[19:39] can come in, Lord. This is the very
[19:42] moment, Lord. You restored the bright
[19:44] tree. You restored us, Lord. And the
[19:47] fullness of the word has come, Father.
[19:52] It shines so bright, Father. And burn
[19:55] everything out of us, Lord. And reveal
[19:59] yourself more closely, Lord. We desire
[20:01] more of you. That's what we are here
[20:03] for. Not to be seen, but to fellowship
[20:07] with you, Lord. Father, we commit this
[20:11] morning into your hand all our songs.
[20:14] May they be pleasing to you. The music

[20:38] been a few requests read this morning,
[20:41] Lord, you know them, Father.
[20:44] Lord, and we believe you have already
[20:46] done the healing work, Father. We
[20:51] believe it's all in the word, Lord, in
[20:54] the body, Lord. And we believe those are
[20:58] healed by your stripes. I lay my hands
[21:00] on them and thank you for healing them.

[22:33] Amen. You may have your seats.
[22:37] Apologize for having you stand for so
[22:39] long. Sometimes just hard to worship our
[22:41] Lord sitting down.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, I want to welcome
[22:45] everyone who's visiting with us. It's
[22:47] good, really good to have you. If you're
[22:49] on the telephone hookup or on the
[22:50] internet, we want to say uh God bless
[22:53] you to you as well. I'm glad you could
[22:54] join with us. And we have a baby
[22:57] dedication this morning. Those having
[22:59] their baby dedicated, why don't you come
[23:01] and get ready? Why don't we sing uh
[23:04] We'll not leave our little ones behind.
[23:06] for our father has.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; We'll not leave our little ones behind.
[23:16] For our father have them in mind.
[23:23] Oh, some are weak and some are feeble.
[23:27] Others may not feel their will not leave
[23:32] a single one behind.
[23:37] Oh, will God leave our little ones
[23:40] behind
[23:44] for our father.
[23:51] Some are weak and some are feeble.
[23:54] Others may not feel their
[23:59] single one behind. Let's sing it one
[24:02] more time. Oh, we'll not leave our
[24:06] little ones behind
[24:11] for our father.
[24:13] [Music]
[24:17] Some are some people.
[24:22] [Music]
[24:31] God bless you.
[24:33] God bless you. Amen.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of God.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Full of expectation.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful also to be adding members
[24:49] not to the church but to the body of
[24:51] Christ.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:55] Uh
[24:56] our brother Nikolai and sister Tanya are
[25:00] bringing their little one
[25:03] and uh she is named Alexis Victoria.
[25:08] Alexis's defender
[25:12] and Victoria of course is Victorious.
[25:17] The grandparents of uh Alexis are also
[25:20] here on both sides of the family. Is
[25:21] that correct? I wonder if we could have
[25:24] the grandparents stand. That's uh
[25:27] Wilheim and Maria Shon House and from
[25:31] Manitoba
[25:33] and also Wasili and Greta Agafonov. I
[25:38] wonder if we can have them stand.
[25:43] God bless you.
[25:47] Thank you. God bless you.
[25:50] I think it's uh important to recognize
[25:52] the grandparents. I'm a grandparent
[25:57] and I think all grandparents can say
[25:58] amen. And those of you that aren't
[26:01] grandparents, just wait a little while
[26:02] and you will be
[26:07] because young people such as uh we have
[26:11] here
[26:12] in this these parents that God has given
[26:17] to Alexis.
[26:19] They do not come by accident. And I know
[26:21] that the parents have a great and strong
[26:24] faith and have brought their children up
[26:28] to serve Christ. And their desire is
[26:32] that not only their children, but that
[26:36] their grandchildren and their children
[26:39] will come to know this Christ.
[26:43] Amen. In the power of his resurrection.
[26:48] The Bible says, "And they brought young
[26:50] children
[26:52] and uh Nikolai and Tanya, you have
[26:56] brought
[26:57] not to me, but you have brought it to
[27:00] Christ." That's the that's their desire.
[27:05] And then the disciples didn't understand
[27:08] and the people didn't understand why the
[27:10] parents were bringing the children to
[27:13] Jesus and they would want to have put
[27:17] them aside and to hold it back. They
[27:20] didn't think it was important. But Jesus
[27:22] said, "Forbid them not bring them." This
[27:25] is an important part.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; This is not a little ceremony. This is
[27:29] important part. We're not bringing this
[27:31] little one, Alexis, to some ceremony.
[27:34] We're bring it to Christ and Christ is
[27:37] here seeing this and viewing this
[27:40] beautiful little child. And then I
[27:43] wanted to say there's something
[27:46] there's a mystery, a secret with
[27:49] children that we probably would not
[27:52] grasp, but Jesus taught it. This mystery
[27:56] that's with children. And he said,
[27:58] "Verily I say unto you, except you be
[28:01] converted."
[28:03] Speaking to us adults now, and converted
[28:06] is not just repenting from sin. Except
[28:08] we be converted, that is have a change
[28:11] of mind. You know, when we become
[28:13] adults, we get ideas.
[28:17] And Jesus saying, you got to change some
[28:20] of those ideas and become like a little
[28:22] child again
[28:24] &gt;&gt; in simplicity
[28:26] and in faith. And it and there's a
[28:28] secret in these children except you
[28:30] become converted and become as little
[28:33] children.
[28:35] You shall not enter the kingdom of
[28:36] heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble
[28:39] himself as a little child. See, she's
[28:44] got her conversation. She's got the
[28:45] things that she's got to say. And she's
[28:48] not worried about me or about you or
[28:49] anybody else. And really, that's the way
[28:52] you ought to be.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to say, "Thank you,
[28:55] Lord. I don't care who's around me. I'm
[28:58] glad for salvation. I'm glad for the
[29:00] blood. I'm glad for the resurrection.
[29:02] And you should have your thing to say
[29:04] like Alexis does.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Become converted and become like little
[29:10] children. We're going to thank our Lord
[29:12] for Alexis.
[29:15] We're going to thank God that he's given
[29:18] her to Nikolai and Tanya.
[29:24] We're going to give thanks that God has
[29:26] given her. And we're going to pray that
[29:29] God will not only bless her, but make
[29:30] her a blessing in this home.
[29:34] You think she'll come to me?
[29:37] &gt;&gt; You want to come to me or no? No. She
[29:40] says, "I trust my daddy more."
[29:42] All right. Well, we'll just pray for her
[29:44] and we'll bless her. Father, how we love
[29:48] this little child being held by her
[29:51] father. You have given her such
[29:53] wonderful parents and grandparents that
[29:56] are here to witness this moment when we
[29:59] pray the blessing of almighty God upon
[30:01] her. I pray, Father, that she will be
[30:03] kept in good health. I pray that as she
[30:06] hears her mother and father speak of
[30:09] Jesus Christ. You will give her
[30:12] understanding. May she be a child of
[30:14] faith. May she be a happy child. May she
[30:18] bring joy to this home. And Lord, I pray
[30:21] now that you will receive her as you
[30:24] have given her. I pray, Father, now
[30:26] you'll receive my prayer as I dedicate
[30:29] her to you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[30:32] And may the blessings of Jesus Christ be
[30:34] upon her for your glory. Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Alexis.
[30:42] God bless you, Tanya. Bless you,
[30:45] Nikolai. Amen.
[30:47] Amen. Amen.
[30:53] Our sister Les Leanne and her group have
[30:55] a song if you want to come and get ready
[30:56] at this time. Why don't we sing number
[30:58] uh 3:21?
[31:00] Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary.
[31:06] Lord, prepare me
[31:11] to be a sanctuary,

[32:30] darkness.

[33:02] A little more than a little more,
[33:06] then a little more sunlight than before.
[33:11] But at the breaking of a brand new dawn,
[33:15] I saw the fullness.
[33:19] I remembered what God had done for me
[33:24] when he took my sary.
[33:27] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for faithful
[33:31] resurrection, Lord.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessed consolation.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; When I found nothing of worth in me,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; you broke the seals at Calvary. Thank
[33:46] you, Lord.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace, how sweet the Lord.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; We were lost, but now we're found.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And there is nothing
[33:59] wrong. Thank you Lord
[34:03] for the rising of the sun.

[34:24] before Paul left at Ephesus.
[34:29] He said there appear grievous wolves.
[34:33] The serpent found a way to break the
[34:37] son's influence.
[34:42] He preached his doctrines of life. eyes.
[34:47] So down and down the gospel went. He
[34:51] showed a little light in Sam,
[34:55] but many saw him at Pogamos,
[35:00] but the less light in Thotyra age
[35:04] and Lut saw him in Sadd.
[35:09] And it was 1750.
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] A man by the name John Wesley.

[35:44] Thanks for revelation 107.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; That man called William Brham.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He took this mystery of this risen son

[36:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace how sweet the sound. They
[36:06] that were lost, then they were found.

[36:28] Shalom. It's now the bright age. to his
[36:33] elect. It's the brightest day.
[36:37] We see light in this evening time. Our
[36:41] pathway to glory we have found. We know
[36:46] it's no longer a oneman ministry.
[36:50] The sun has risen in you and me.
[36:53] Revelation 108 to 11
[36:58] upon us. This gospel has risen.
[37:03] And at the breaking of the brand new
[37:06] dawn, we were called out by this risen
[37:10] son.
[37:11] We have the sun in reality.
[37:16] We have our own testimony.
[37:20] We'll slip from time into eternity.
[37:25] From this mortal to immortality.
[37:27] [Music]
[37:29] Walk on streets in pure white.
[37:33] There the lamb will be the light.
[37:38] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[37:42] We that were lost. Now we are found.
[37:46] He broke the bondage from all our lives
[37:51] and presented at the lamb's wife.
[37:54] Amazing
[37:56] grace, how sweet the sound. We were
[38:00] lost, but now we're found.
[38:03] He broke the seals from all the lies
[38:08] and present us at the land.
[38:14] Oh, we thank you, Lord.
[38:19] You rose from the dead. You fill us with
[38:22] your Holy Ghost. And we thank you, Lord.
[38:28] We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[38:32] You brought the seals. You called us.
[38:36] Oh, we thank you, Lord. We thank you,
[38:39] Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[38:42] [Music]
[39:02] the song that Leah sang all I want to
[39:04] see.
[39:10] Amen.
[39:12] There's been a song that's been on my uh
[39:15] mind too that I would like to
[39:18] just lead into the
[39:20] service and I have a few comments to
[39:23] make before we come to the word this
[39:25] morning. So I hope you're not in a big
[39:26] hurry. Uh this is an important Sunday,
[39:30] &gt;&gt; important time remembering
[39:33] the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[39:34] Christ. If it wasn't for that, we
[39:36] wouldn't be here.
[39:38] we wouldn't have anything to sing about
[39:40] or worship about or to preach about.
[39:45] Uh some time ago, uh brother John Lee, I
[39:50] think and Joanna sang a song, All I Want
[39:52] to See Is Jesus. And uh it's 10:41 in
[39:57] the in the book, but those of you that
[39:59] know it, I wonder if you could sing it
[40:01] with me. And I just going to sing a a
[40:04] chorus or maybe if you know the verse,
[40:05] we could sing it. And then I have some
[40:08] comments and then I want to sing the
[40:09] chorus again. Brother Jason, would you
[40:11] stand with me and help me sing that?
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Do you want to sing the first verse?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; All I want to see is Jesus. That's a
[40:22] chorus. Just a chorus.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; All I want to see
[40:28] is Jesus.
[40:30] [Music]
[40:33] All I want to see
[40:36] is
[40:40] all I want to see is Jesus
[40:47] shining
[40:50] through.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Why don't everyone stand as we sing
[40:53] that?
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see
[40:57] Jesus.
[41:01] All I want to see
[41:04] is the baby.
[41:07] Oh, I want to see
[41:11] Jesus
[41:14] shine
[41:17] through.
[41:20] Oh, what I want to see is Jesus.
[41:26] Yes, I want to see his name.
[41:33] It's all I want to see. Is Jesus
[41:40] shining
[41:43] through thee?
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer?
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Is that your yearning desire?
[41:52] All I want to see is Jesus shining
[41:56] through me.
[41:58] We'll just have a word of prayer.
[42:01] Heavenly Father,
[42:03] as we stand here today, each of us
[42:07] having our own re relationship with you,
[42:11] we want to enter into a a closer
[42:14] relationship.
[42:16] We want to be drawn closer to you, Lord.
[42:20] We want you to speak secrets to your
[42:22] bride. Speak secrets, Lord, to each one
[42:26] of us. Tell us, oh God, the things that
[42:29] you'd want us to hear. Speak to us this
[42:32] morning, Father, out of your word and
[42:35] out of the things that are taking place
[42:37] around us. Move us, I pray, to another
[42:41] realm, another place, another dimension
[42:43] in Christ. Lord, you see our desires,
[42:46] our hearts craving. I pray today you'll
[42:50] give utterance to your word. I pray
[42:52] father in the name of Jesus you'll give
[42:54] good ground for the seed to fall into. I
[42:58] pray father you will empower us now as
[43:00] we speak in the name of Jesus and bind
[43:03] every evil power. We bind, oh God, every
[43:06] restrictive, every restriction,
[43:09] everything that the enemy would try to
[43:11] do and bring into captivity every
[43:14] thought to the mind of Christ in the
[43:17] name of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit.
[43:20] Deliver your word, I pray. Father, I
[43:22] submit and surrender myself to you. I
[43:25] pray that you'll be glorified in you
[43:27] alone. No flesh shall glory in your
[43:31] presence. We will simply glorify the
[43:34] name of Jesus Christ and say we desire
[43:37] that you live in us Lord. Live in us I
[43:40] pray and have the preeminence for your
[43:43] glory in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you.
[43:51] Do you mind standing just a moment
[43:52] before we read the scripture? I want to
[43:56] uh just say a few words about the events
[44:00] of this last week. Uh
[44:03] perhaps I will have you sit down. This
[44:05] may take a little longer than I thought.
[44:10] There are times when God seems to
[44:15] uh set us on the sidelines
[44:19] and he takes absolute control of a
[44:22] situation or of events
[44:25] and you can all you can do is stand back
[44:28] and watch it happen. All you can do is
[44:31] stand back and confess
[44:34] we don't have anything to do with this.
[44:37] You've all experienced that. Sometimes
[44:38] something takes place in your life and
[44:41] you just simply don't have any control
[44:44] of it. It's God and God alone that's
[44:46] directing the affairs. This last week
[44:50] has been one of those times.
[44:53] I thought I should tell this
[44:55] congregation and those that are
[44:56] streaming and all that may hear this
[44:58] service
[45:00] how the connection took place.
[45:04] And I I ask God to give added grace to
[45:08] the O'Brien family, uh, and those that
[45:12] are here,
[45:14] the Douly family, the Stevens, because I
[45:17] have just a few comments, and I feel
[45:19] that I I feel I need to make these
[45:21] comments.
[45:25] After the accident took place, my wife
[45:28] and I went to spend time with the
[45:32] O'Brien family early in the morning and
[45:34] we spent about an hour
[45:37] and then it was very early and then we
[45:40] made our way home and were going to have
[45:44] some breakfast. My wife started to
[45:45] prepare breakfast
[45:48] and I became very very unsettled and
[45:51] uneasy within myself
[45:54] and I I felt compelled.
[45:57] I must go up to the site. I must go up.
[46:01] Uh and yet I knew because we had heard
[46:04] on the news already that it's completely
[46:07] sealed off. 16th Avenue was completely
[46:10] sealed off from 256th Street to 200 uh
[46:16] to to 264th Street and the accident took
[46:20] place at 258th Street. So I knew it was
[46:24] a a sealed accident scene and there was
[46:27] no access whatsoever to get there. I
[46:30] knew that. But yet I was so and I began
[46:33] to pace back and forth while my wife is
[46:36] preparing breakfast and I'm pacing. I am
[46:39] being so compelled. I must I must uh I I
[46:43] must get up there and I didn't know why.
[46:46] And my mind was saying there's no use
[46:49] because you can't get anywhere near it
[46:51] anyway. So I didn't know in my mind I
[46:54] didn't know why I was having this uh
[46:58] urge and it was an urge I could not put
[47:01] down
[47:03] and so we sat at breakfast and I can
[47:05] actually say I I I ate with hur so
[47:09] hurriedly and I thought this is you know
[47:12] why am I doing this but I was being and
[47:15] I knew it was something spiritual that
[47:17] was going on but I had no clue what what
[47:19] it was whatsoever. ever. And and I just
[47:22] told my wife, I have to go. Do you care
[47:25] to come? She said, "Yes, well, I'll go
[47:27] with you." So, we drove up and as we
[47:31] arrived to where the first initial
[47:34] police car was, and I could see further
[47:37] up the road, there were other crew uh
[47:39] police cruisers and some activity maybe
[47:42] 400 meters, 400 yards up the road.
[47:47] And then I noticed as I was coming up to
[47:50] where the barricades were, I saw that
[47:52] there was a small group of people that
[47:54] were gathered. And I thought, well,
[47:56] maybe just residents or people that are
[47:58] coming along on the road. And you know,
[48:00] something like this attracts people. And
[48:03] so I I came up and and then I started to
[48:06] turn because there were several cars
[48:07] parked and I had to turn down a street
[48:10] down 256th Street to park my car. And as
[48:13] I was just turning slowly, I saw then
[48:16] some of these people had cameras and uh
[48:19] oh, I thought that was the first time
[48:20] entered my mind. Excuse me. Thought, oh
[48:24] uh yeah, I guess there's some reporters
[48:26] here probably waiting. I saw their big
[48:28] lens cameras and they were just mingling
[48:31] and talking to each other. And I
[48:33] thought, okay, yeah, I I guess of course
[48:35] they'd be interested in taking some
[48:39] uh uh making some report of this
[48:42] accident. maybe they're waiting for a,
[48:44] you know, a toll truck or who knows what
[48:47] to happen and they're just sitting there
[48:49] mingling around each other. And so, uh,
[48:52] I said to my wife, I'm just going to go
[48:54] and speak to the police officer that's
[48:57] in the car. And so I just made my way
[48:59] and I just these people were all just
[49:01] talking amongst themselves and so and I
[49:02] just made my way through them and
[49:04] through the barricade uh which had an
[49:07] opening and came up to the police
[49:08] cruiser parked a few meters inside and
[49:12] uh it was a woman officer and she put
[49:14] her cap on and stepped out of the car
[49:15] and said can I help you? And I just told
[49:19] her, I said, "I'm the pastor of the
[49:21] three young men that were in the in this
[49:23] truck, and I'd like I said, I am
[49:26] familiar with the process, but I thought
[49:30] perhaps I might be able to get up and
[49:32] take some pictures of of the scene, and
[49:35] for the family's sake, so the family
[49:37] could have that if they wished." She
[49:39] said, "I can't let you go up there. I'm
[49:41] sorry." And I said, 'I realize, you
[49:44] know, I realize there's an investigation
[49:47] uh underway and I'm well aware of that,
[49:51] but I said, I thought maybe you could
[49:52] let me go up there. And she said, "No, I
[49:55] I wish I could." She's very nice. I I
[49:58] wish I could, but I just can't. And I
[50:00] said, "Okay, I I understand." And we
[50:03] just talked for a few more moments. I
[50:05] was probably with her five 10 minutes.
[50:09] And as I turned around and began to go
[50:12] back to my car,
[50:14] uh the reporters and the cameras, they
[50:18] they formed I just faced a complete
[50:20] wall, a horseshoe, a horseshoe wall of
[50:24] reporters. So, and they were right at
[50:26] the barricade where I could only go out.
[50:28] So, I I just stepped out and I just
[50:30] faced these and they said, "Are you a
[50:33] resident in the area?" because they
[50:35] didn't know why I would be speaking to
[50:37] the police officer. I said, "No, I'm not
[50:40] a resident. I'm I'm the pastor of these
[50:43] three young men." Well, it was just like
[50:46] you ignited
[50:48] uh lit a match to the gasoline and they
[50:51] were just questions flew from every
[50:53] direction and the cameras were rolling
[50:55] and everything and uh they said, "Well,
[50:58] do you know the family?" And I said,
[50:59] "Yes." "And have you been with the
[51:01] family?" "Yes." and you know and and all
[51:05] I want to say I just want to tell you
[51:06] that that's where the connection was
[51:09] made and they said well can we contact
[51:11] the family and I said no you mustn't
[51:14] contact the family and uh can we call
[51:18] you I said well yes you can call me if
[51:20] you wish uh I said you know here's my
[51:24] numbers and then I I left them well
[51:27] there was questions for a few minutes
[51:29] probably another 10 minutes
[51:32] and then I I excused myself and we left.
[51:35] Well, by the time I got here to the
[51:37] church, I drove then to the church to
[51:39] the church office and the phones were
[51:41] literally ringing off the wall and there
[51:45] was already uh four reporters had
[51:47] called. And while I was talking to one
[51:49] of those, another two reporters called
[51:51] and this was just within within 30
[51:54] minutes, I suppose, of that time. and
[51:56] and I saw them on the phones and they
[51:58] were already on their cell phones making
[52:01] sending in their stories. And so when I
[52:05] look back and when we look back, I
[52:06] thought I just wanted to tell the
[52:08] congregation this because
[52:11] what was to become a media event
[52:15] actually became a mar a message event.
[52:18] Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And I want you to you can put that
[52:25] phrase and tuck it away in your heart if
[52:27] you wish.
[52:30] God ordained, I believe, that original
[52:32] contact because he wanted to swing it,
[52:37] index it from the actual tragedy to
[52:42] something that had a spiritual impact.
[52:45] And I want to say to the congregation,
[52:47] you and I on this side of eternity will
[52:50] never be able to weigh the impact that
[52:54] it has had. In fact, is I spoke with
[52:57] more than one reporter, but one in
[52:59] particular of the main uh one of the
[53:01] main national
[53:03] uh media connections and he said to me,
[53:06] he said, "We're" and he went with with
[53:08] his hand this way. He said, "We're
[53:10] caught in this."
[53:13] literally caught in it.
[53:17] Also, another reporter said, "This is
[53:19] the only thing that we're talking
[53:20] about." And this is several days later,
[53:23] two, three days later.
[53:25] And they were somewhat, I will, I guess
[53:29] I could use a few words because I was
[53:31] trying to describe it as it be to take
[53:34] place, unfold. They were captivated.
[53:38] Then when they began to see the
[53:40] incredible strength,
[53:43] spiritual strength that was in the
[53:46] family
[53:47] and all that were involved.
[53:51] Then they wanted to come to Sunday
[53:52] morning service
[53:55] and I told them we have a very long
[53:57] service. I don't know if you want to set
[53:59] up. Well, yeah, they thought that they
[54:01] would, but the lady who was in charge of
[54:04] the whole thing for Canadian
[54:07] Broadcasting Corporation said, "Well,
[54:10] I'll talk to them to see because it took
[54:12] about three, four people with the truck
[54:14] and everything." And I said, "You know,"
[54:17] she said, "Well, you don't want the
[54:18] meeting disturbed." I said, "Absolutely
[54:20] not. If they come here and set up a
[54:23] camera, they need to be here for the
[54:25] whole service." And uh so she said,
[54:28] "Well, I'll talk to them." So then I
[54:30] wrote it off. I said they're they're not
[54:32] going to come here and and you know put
[54:36] the whole service and even if they tape
[54:38] it, even if they put five minutes or use
[54:40] five minutes, they need to see what five
[54:42] minutes they want. So they're going to
[54:44] tape. They have to sit here for the
[54:45] whole thing. And I wrote it off. It
[54:47] wasn't until Sunday morning I learned
[54:50] early. They're going to be there.
[54:51] They're going to have the truck here and
[54:53] the camera people are going to be here
[54:55] and Canadian Broadcasting is going to
[54:57] going to be in the morning service
[55:01] and
[55:03] God was here.
[55:06] You know, God was here and I know God
[55:08] was here and God took over that service.
[55:13] They became captivated.
[55:17] They became fascinated.
[55:20] They became mesmerized.
[55:23] They became intrigued.
[55:27] What is it that these people possess?
[55:31] And doors
[55:33] blew open from every direction.
[55:36] And I can say about the media if they
[55:39] are listening or will hear this I want
[55:41] to commend them because I hear people
[55:46] you know almost with antagonistic
[55:48] against the media because they said they
[55:50] can't get anything right.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to the media this time
[55:54] they didn't get anything wrong.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; They quoted the they quoted the
[55:58] speakers. They quoted the family. They
[56:01] quoted myself and they quoted it
[56:04] accurately and graciously
[56:06] and uh in fact is uh the one national
[56:11] television
[56:13] uh broadcast
[56:15] used these words concerning the service.
[56:19] The aura of strong faith in the face of
[56:23] terrible tragedy permeated the entire
[56:26] service that was marked not by
[56:29] uncontrollable weeping and crushing
[56:31] grief but by soaring hymns, articulate
[56:36] speakers, an unshakable feeling that
[56:39] Silas O'Brien was in a better place.
[56:42] Michelle O'Brien sang a mother's prayer
[56:45] with inspirational lyrics that seemed to
[56:47] have the congregation spellbound not
[56:50] only by her voice and the strength of
[56:52] the lyrics but also by an appropriate
[56:56] admiration for her courage as a that's a
[57:00] national television broadcast reporting
[57:03] on it and it's a it's a long it's a long
[57:06] thing. Brother Joe Walner
[57:10] uh heard from part of the family that's
[57:12] in Hawaii. They said they they they saw
[57:15] it on television. I didn't know that,
[57:18] but they said almost the entire service
[57:20] was on television with just they just
[57:22] took a little clip out of one or two of
[57:24] the brothers that were saying some words
[57:27] and showed the entire one another
[57:29] another sister, a woman called from Los
[57:32] Angeles up here to a relative and said,
[57:34] "I'm watching it on television right
[57:36] now." Wesley Ordeal called from Atlanta,
[57:40] Georgia and said this this very article
[57:42] is in the newspaper down there.
[57:47] I want to say to Sister Michelle
[57:51] that she she actually sang her song to a
[57:55] nation
[58:00] and images of the family members in
[58:02] prayer.
[58:05] The young men with their arms around
[58:07] each other in prayer and dedication and
[58:10] comfort, comforting one another was
[58:14] viewed not by hundreds of thousands but
[58:16] even by millions of people.
[58:21] It was carried in a national newspaper
[58:25] Globe and Mail which is the same as USA
[58:27] Today on the state side.
[58:33] Silas's baptism.
[58:37] One of the reporters said that that was
[58:39] like that was the epitome. That was the
[58:43] highlight.
[58:45] And they recorded him giving his
[58:48] testimony.
[58:50] And I thought, how remarkable right at
[58:53] Easter time, God has put the bride on
[58:56] display
[58:58] and actually didn't only hear the words,
[59:01] I baptize you in true baptism in the
[59:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and send
[59:08] that out to the multitudes and
[59:10] reestablish at the very same time that a
[59:14] pope is pouring holy water on a Muslim
[59:17] to give him a baptism in the titles. and
[59:20] hear God through a message, through a
[59:22] prophet's message is restoring the
[59:25] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:27] Christ and causing them to say it.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And causing them to regard it.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; God put it on display.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; You didn't do that.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't do that.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; So, I go back to that original
[59:40] connection and then I knew why that Holy
[59:44] Spirit was bringing such a compulsion
[59:46] upon me. I couldn't I couldn't even
[59:48] hardly eat my breakfast. I must get
[59:50] there. Didn't even come to my mind.
[59:53] Never even dreamed my wildest dreams
[59:55] there was anybody out there. I thought I
[59:58] just have to go. I don't know why I have
[59:59] to go. And then from then on, I wonder
[1:00:03] how many there are here that had an
[1:00:05] opportunity has witnessed to somebody
[1:00:08] because of this. May I see your hands?
[1:00:13] Incredible.
[1:00:15] Just incredible. Something else I want
[1:00:17] to say to the congregation.
[1:00:19] There were details.
[1:00:21] It seemed that every detail of this
[1:00:24] entire event tied back somehow to the
[1:00:29] congregation, the people in the church.
[1:00:33] Our brother Randy and sister Sharon
[1:00:35] Timberman's living out in Chilowak
[1:00:39] were have some contact and speaking to
[1:00:41] their neighbor
[1:00:43] and the subject came up because it just
[1:00:45] happened and their neighbor said, "I am
[1:00:49] the paramedic. I'm the ambulance driver
[1:00:52] that was first at the site."
[1:00:56] Brother Tom Ray's mother walked into a
[1:01:00] business place in White Rock
[1:01:04] and she knows the owners of this
[1:01:07] business
[1:01:09] and the subject came up because it's in
[1:01:12] all of the leading newspapers, front
[1:01:14] page, front page stories, front page
[1:01:17] pictures and as everybody speaking so
[1:01:20] they started speaking about it. Tom's
[1:01:22] mother said, "Well, actually," she said,
[1:01:26] "we do have I personally have a
[1:01:28] connection. My son is one of the
[1:01:31] associate ministers at the church where
[1:01:34] the young men go." And the lady said, "I
[1:01:38] and my husband are the two people in the
[1:01:41] silver Honda that stopped when they had
[1:01:44] just gone in the ditch and came and
[1:01:46] stood on the road.
[1:01:49] We're the two people that stopped and
[1:01:51] asked them if we could help and they
[1:01:53] says we're all right. And they said we
[1:01:55] just went down the road and about a
[1:01:57] moment later we saw we saw the
[1:01:59] headlights of the other pickup that came
[1:02:01] by.
[1:02:03] Every detail
[1:02:06] and you realize
[1:02:08] we don't have any control of this. This
[1:02:11] is God's in control and he wants to send
[1:02:16] uh a testimony out. I thought it's
[1:02:19] remarkable the family that the family
[1:02:22] that participated.
[1:02:24] Jake giving the eulogy. It they picked
[1:02:28] up on it and they were so impressed and
[1:02:31] they they're fascinated. They're they're
[1:02:34] somehow reaching out. What is this
[1:02:37] strength?
[1:02:39] What is this peace?
[1:02:42] Where does it come from? And all of you
[1:02:46] gave testimony to it. All of you in one
[1:02:49] way or another in your singing, in the
[1:02:52] soaring anthems, as it were, the songs,
[1:02:56] it is well with my soul, I tell you. You
[1:02:59] maybe thought you were just singing it,
[1:03:01] but it was penetrating.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Penetrating men and women.
[1:03:07] not only here but far abroad. And I say
[1:03:11] to the bride's been on display.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Not something in the future. She's been
[1:03:18] on display. And you will never know till
[1:03:21] eternity where it's gone and who it's
[1:03:24] affected. I want to say thank you from
[1:03:27] the depths of my heart to every person
[1:03:31] that was present, every believer for the
[1:03:35] expression of Jesus Christ, for the
[1:03:37] sisters that
[1:03:40] came so instantly and willingly
[1:03:45] and prepared food and things like that.
[1:03:48] the musicians and the songs
[1:03:51] and the singing and the people that were
[1:03:55] uh tending to the sound and to the video
[1:03:57] and to everything and streaming the
[1:03:59] service of people in Scotland,
[1:04:03] in Norway, in New Zealand, in
[1:04:07] Switzerland. I had contact with all of
[1:04:10] them just very shortly where they were
[1:04:13] being part of the whole service. And I
[1:04:17] all I can say is this is the Lord's
[1:04:19] doing
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; and it's glorious in our eyes.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And we say whatever his will is, we say
[1:04:26] so be it.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Would
[1:04:30] you stand with me now and we'll read
[1:04:32] some scripture.
[1:04:34] Can you turn please to 1 Corinthians the
[1:04:37] 15th chapter and we're going to begin
[1:04:39] reading at the 12th verse. 1 Corinthians
[1:04:42] 15 verse 12.
[1:04:50] Now if Christ be preached that he rose
[1:04:52] from the dead, how say some among you
[1:04:56] that there is no resurrection of the
[1:04:57] dead? But if there be no resurrection of
[1:05:00] the dead, then is Christ not risen? And
[1:05:03] if Christ be not risen, then is our
[1:05:05] preaching vain. Your faith is also vain.
[1:05:09] Yay. And we are found false witnesses of
[1:05:12] God, because we have testified of God,
[1:05:15] that he raised up Christ, whom he raised
[1:05:18] not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
[1:05:21] For if the dead rise not, then is not
[1:05:24] Christ raised. And if Christ be not
[1:05:27] raised, your faith is vain. Ye are yet
[1:05:30] in your sins. Then they also which are
[1:05:33] fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If
[1:05:37] in this life only we have hope in
[1:05:39] Christ, we are are of all men most
[1:05:43] miserable, but now is Christ risen from
[1:05:47] the dead. Can we say amen?
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And become the first fruits of them that
[1:05:51] slept. For since by man came death, by
[1:05:55] man came also the resurrection of the
[1:05:58] dead. Thank God he became a kinsman
[1:06:01] redeemer.
[1:06:02] For also, for as in Adam all die, even
[1:06:06] so in Christ shall all be made alive.
[1:06:10] But every man in his own order, Christ
[1:06:13] the first fruits, afterward, they that
[1:06:15] are Christ at his coming. May God bless
[1:06:19] his word to us as you have your seats.
[1:06:24] Now, just follow me closely, please. I'm
[1:06:26] going to go as quickly as possible, but
[1:06:28] I don't want to uh I don't want to miss
[1:06:31] out on what the Holy Spirit would have
[1:06:33] for us this morning. If I may just have
[1:06:35] your full attention when Jesus Christ
[1:06:39] came,
[1:06:40] the revealing, we can say the revealing
[1:06:42] of Christ when he came and was here on
[1:06:45] earth in his short short visitation. We
[1:06:48] could we could say that his life was
[1:06:51] actually his whole life, his whole
[1:06:53] ministry
[1:06:55] as the God prophet. He wasn't a prophet
[1:06:58] of God. He was the God prophet. But he
[1:07:01] was in a son of man ministry. Son of
[1:07:04] man, which is prophet office. While he
[1:07:07] was in that office, it was a very brief
[1:07:10] ministry. He was only ministered for
[1:07:12] like about three and a half years old.
[1:07:15] Although he lived you know that 33 33
[1:07:18] and 1/2 years yet it was that ministry
[1:07:22] that was a sign I will I want to call it
[1:07:25] a the sign of the resurrection and
[1:07:28] that's the title of the message I want
[1:07:30] to leave with you this morning the sign
[1:07:33] of the resurrection so I wish to tie
[1:07:35] together the very life and ministry of
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ in a son of man prophetic
[1:07:43] ministry was the sign of the
[1:07:46] resurrection because he wasn't going to
[1:07:48] minister that long before he would have
[1:07:51] his death, burial, and resurrection. And
[1:07:54] as Apostle Paul said, if he didn't rise,
[1:07:57] then everything's lost.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't rise, if there's no
[1:08:01] resurrection, we're of all men most
[1:08:04] miserable. If we only in this life have
[1:08:06] hope, then I say, what are we doing
[1:08:08] here? We have not merely hope but our
[1:08:12] faith is anchored in the promise of God
[1:08:15] that there is a resurrection of the
[1:08:17] dead. But now I need to make a very very
[1:08:20] strong point. It is the the the ministry
[1:08:23] of Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] in revealing himself in a prophetic
[1:08:29] ministry is the sign of the
[1:08:31] resurrection.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; So I want you to mark that down. And
[1:08:36] according to his own words, the words of
[1:08:39] Jesus, he said himself that when he
[1:08:42] would reveal himself again, as the son
[1:08:45] of man, in other words, a prophet's
[1:08:47] office, he said in Luke's gospel 17
[1:08:51] and30, which you're so acquainted with
[1:08:54] here in this church, but don't let it
[1:08:56] just uh brush off because I need to I
[1:08:59] need you to tie it together in the whole
[1:09:02] context of the message this morning.
[1:09:05] Even thus shall it be when he's
[1:09:08] describing the days of Noah and the days
[1:09:10] of Lot. And he described those days they
[1:09:13] did eat,
[1:09:15] they drank,
[1:09:18] they married wives,
[1:09:20] they were given in marriage, they
[1:09:23] bought,
[1:09:24] they sold, they planted, they builded.
[1:09:29] And there isn't one of those
[1:09:30] descriptions that doesn't fit this age.
[1:09:33] Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Not happening on a local little basis in
[1:09:37] some town, some city, some place, but
[1:09:40] it's happening throughout the world,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; throughout the earth. They're marrying,
[1:09:45] giving in marriage, taking wives, not
[1:09:48] even being married, and they're they're
[1:09:50] buying and they're selling a global h a
[1:09:54] global economy. They're planting. And
[1:09:57] with plant, they want to be able to
[1:09:59] market it someplace and sell it
[1:10:00] someplace. And the whole thing is a just
[1:10:03] a great great kind of economy that's
[1:10:06] caught the people. And it was in that
[1:10:08] atmosphere that that God said that when
[1:10:11] that would come, that's when the son of
[1:10:14] man would be revealed again. And that
[1:10:17] has taken place in the prophet's
[1:10:19] ministry and he that's why he said
[1:10:21] hundreds of times it is the sign of the
[1:10:25] resurrection.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; That very ministry is indicative. It is
[1:10:30] God speaking because God is doing
[1:10:33] something that a man can't do.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Even listening last night, Brother
[1:10:38] Brandham saying to to to a woman
[1:10:40] standing there, of course you're feeling
[1:10:43] strange. You're feeling that's not me.
[1:10:46] That's not my presence. That's him.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And this is a testimony or a sign of the
[1:10:53] resurrection. He even told people
[1:10:56] clearly, you will see the sign of the
[1:10:58] resurrection because the whole ministry
[1:11:01] itself was an evidence to the
[1:11:03] resurrection. He said this this this
[1:11:06] healing healing itself of the body.
[1:11:08] Well, we believe in praying for the
[1:11:10] sick, laying hands upon them, whatever,
[1:11:12] or just preaching the word and you
[1:11:13] receive the promise. Believe it and you
[1:11:15] can be healed. But that's a minor that's
[1:11:18] a minor thing because you can be healed
[1:11:21] every day, but you'll you'll die
[1:11:22] sometime. But uh the the resurrection
[1:11:25] came to to give testimony to eternal
[1:11:28] life.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; But he said that that resurrection life,
[1:11:32] the sign of the resurrection, what is
[1:11:34] happening and that healing is a only a
[1:11:38] token evidence of the resurrection.
[1:11:42] That's what healing is. When you're
[1:11:44] healed, a part of your body is made
[1:11:46] well. That's evidence, a token evidence
[1:11:49] of the resurrection. And if you were
[1:11:52] healed perfectly every day, every day,
[1:11:54] every day, you wouldn't die.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing would go wrong with you.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And so it's just a token evidence of the
[1:12:01] resurrection. But then when God comes in
[1:12:05] uh in that kind of a ministry and then
[1:12:08] uh reveals the secrets of the hearts of
[1:12:10] the people uh by the hundreds and
[1:12:14] thousands and tens of thousands of
[1:12:16] people speaking the truth to the to the
[1:12:21] revealing the secret of the heart and
[1:12:23] the people they're caught up in what's
[1:12:25] happening but you know largely missed it
[1:12:29] because what God was doing he was trying
[1:12:32] to get the people to recognize this is a
[1:12:37] sign of the oncoming resurrection.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And when you see a sign, I'll come to it
[1:12:44] in a few moments. A sign is something
[1:12:47] that points to something else.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And that was what that ministry was all
[1:12:53] about. But the people got caught up with
[1:12:55] the sign and didn't see where it was
[1:12:57] pointing to.
[1:12:59] And I'm here today to talk about what
[1:13:01] it's pointing to.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Now, in the message presence of God
[1:13:07] unrecognized,
[1:13:09] notice the title of it, unrecognized,
[1:13:12] he refers to the scripture, a wicked and
[1:13:15] adulterous generation seek after a sign.
[1:13:19] Notice he says they will receive a sign.
[1:13:22] what this generation for as Jonah was in
[1:13:26] the belly of the whale three days and
[1:13:28] nights. The son of man must be in the
[1:13:31] heart of the earth three days and
[1:13:33] nights. What sign will that wicked and
[1:13:36] adulterous generation receive? It was
[1:13:38] the very one he was talking in revealing
[1:13:41] himself as a son of man as the God
[1:13:43] prophet fulfilling the scripture. And he
[1:13:46] said this sign what what sign will they
[1:13:48] receive? the sign of the resurrection.
[1:13:52] That's the sign they received. And then
[1:13:54] he says, "And today,
[1:13:56] after 2,000 years, we still see Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ in the power of his
[1:14:03] resurrection."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; This wasn't just another ministry. This
[1:14:09] was a sign that God sent
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; because we're in the end time. The days
[1:14:16] of Noah were here are here. The days of
[1:14:19] Lot are here. Anybody would want to deny
[1:14:22] that? I say you're you you're out of
[1:14:24] touch with reality. The days of Sodom
[1:14:26] are here
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; worldwide
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; on a global basis. The days of Lot are
[1:14:32] here. And the days of Noah are here.
[1:14:35] We've had it for some time. And really,
[1:14:38] it's only probably since the Second
[1:14:40] World War that everything has has been
[1:14:43] uh so ignited. It's like an explosion of
[1:14:46] inventions. an explosion of of of
[1:14:50] pleasure mad people.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Whether they're poor or whether they're
[1:14:56] rich, it's a pleasure mad throne.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; They'll spend their last dollar going to
[1:15:03] get some kind of of an entertainment,
[1:15:06] whatever. I I've been I was a missionary
[1:15:09] amongst the native Indian people. I went
[1:15:11] back there after many years. When I went
[1:15:13] there the first time, they didn't have a
[1:15:16] road. They didn't have any cars, maybe
[1:15:19] one or two amongst the whole tribe.
[1:15:22] They didn't have any televisions. They
[1:15:24] lived in little poor places. But when
[1:15:26] you'd have a service, a meeting, they
[1:15:29] packed the church every night, standing
[1:15:32] around the walls. It could be raining
[1:15:34] with a 100 mile hour wind one night. 100
[1:15:37] mph wind driving the rain right through
[1:15:41] the boards of cracks and running across
[1:15:43] the floor in little rivlets of of water.
[1:15:47] They didn't pay a bit of attention to
[1:15:48] it. They were hungry for God. They
[1:15:51] wanted to hear the gospel and they would
[1:15:53] pack the place and line along the walls.
[1:15:56] Didn't care what kind of weather. I went
[1:15:58] back there many years later to show even
[1:16:00] the video deep called the deep. couldn't
[1:16:02] do. We got a nice audience, a nice crowd
[1:16:05] out, but we went to see the fell who had
[1:16:07] the key for the hall for the church.
[1:16:09] He's laying there on a sofa. Never even
[1:16:12] had enough time to get up. Laying there
[1:16:15] watching some football game or
[1:16:17] something. Now they got a road into the
[1:16:20] reserve. Now they got cars. Now they got
[1:16:23] televisions. And the television was
[1:16:25] worth more than the shack he was living
[1:16:27] in.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:16:33] What happened? Got perverted.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; The whole thing got perverted. The whole
[1:16:37] thing got twisted. The mind got didn't
[1:16:40] get converted towards holiness and
[1:16:42] righteousness. Got converted the other
[1:16:44] way.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Not converted, but perverted.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen. I'm going to
[1:16:50] preach.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; It changed. Everything changed. I walked
[1:16:55] out of there sad. I thought, how
[1:16:57] different in just a few years, just
[1:17:00] swallowed up with pleasure and ease and
[1:17:03] whatever more. How different. How glad I
[1:17:06] am that God found some people, found
[1:17:09] some young people. They've been through
[1:17:11] all the religion. They've been through
[1:17:13] all kinds of churches. They've been
[1:17:14] through all kinds of programs. They're
[1:17:16] not interested in programs anymore. They
[1:17:19] want a God that's a living God.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; They want a holy God.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; They want a God of the word. Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; They don't want some ceremony.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; They don't want some program. Oh, we got
[1:17:33] a program for the young people. The
[1:17:35] program we have for you young people is
[1:17:37] hearing the preaching of the word of
[1:17:39] God, having experience with God. That's
[1:17:42] the program.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Putting you in contact with God. That's
[1:17:46] the program.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Until you have an individual experience,
[1:17:50] that's the program.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; It's not the world. It's not just some
[1:17:55] excitement. It's not some emotionalism.
[1:17:57] It's putting you in contact with God and
[1:18:00] giving you a hunger till you know this
[1:18:02] is a reality.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; And no man gave it to you and no man can
[1:18:07] take it away. It's the same program
[1:18:10] Apostle Paul had or Peter had or James
[1:18:13] had or Steven had or any of the young
[1:18:15] men that we have today or any fathers or
[1:18:18] deacons have or whatever more. That's
[1:18:20] the program.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; That's the only one that's for your
[1:18:25] families.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; We've received a sign of the
[1:18:32] resurrection.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; It's a God sign. God sent.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing that man could do.
[1:18:40] And Corinthians says this, which I used
[1:18:43] in the service and throughout this week.
[1:18:45] While we look not at the things which
[1:18:51] are seen,
[1:18:53] but at the things which are not seen.
[1:18:57] For the things which are seen are
[1:18:59] temporal.
[1:19:01] And the things that are not seen are
[1:19:03] eternal.
[1:19:05] And I just say to this congregation and
[1:19:07] all that are streaming the service, what
[1:19:10] are we looking at?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, and I'm speaking
[1:19:16] especially to the you young men and
[1:19:19] women that have been touched very deeply
[1:19:21] throughout this week, Paul so
[1:19:24] marvelously worded it, while
[1:19:29] while we look, and I was amazed with
[1:19:31] that word. and thought, "How long? How
[1:19:33] long are we going to be moved? How long
[1:19:36] are we going to be affected?" You know
[1:19:38] how long you'll be affected by this last
[1:19:39] week's events? Depending how long you
[1:19:42] look at the things that are not seen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's how long.
[1:19:51] Other than that, if you're if you get
[1:19:53] refocused back on just a natural my job
[1:19:56] and my vehicle and my car and my, you
[1:20:00] know, my future and my education and
[1:20:03] where I'm going in the world. If you
[1:20:05] stay focused on that, I'm quite
[1:20:07] convinced that there's another part of
[1:20:09] the prophet's words that said it'll pass
[1:20:11] by and you'll say, "Wasn't Elijah
[1:20:14] supposed to come?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Wasn't there supposed to be a rapture?"
[1:20:18] And he'll say, "It will have already
[1:20:19] happened."
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "How did I miss that?"
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Because you're focused on what you can
[1:20:26] see.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Well, there's my there's my home and
[1:20:30] there's my car and there's my job. This
[1:20:32] is my future. There's my wife. There's
[1:20:34] my family. And we're just focused on
[1:20:36] what we're doing here.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; I have to say to you, you'll miss it.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Not me. The prophet said you'll miss it.
[1:20:46] You say, "Oh, was it supposed to
[1:20:49] happen?" You say, "How can we say the
[1:20:51] things that are
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; unseen?" The Bible's full of it.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You'll know something more about it when
[1:20:57] this service is over. There is an unseen
[1:20:59] realm.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; What does the prophet messenger say
[1:21:03] according to Apostle Paul? If this body
[1:21:05] be dissolved, we have another
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; said it's only 20 25 ft from his body
[1:21:10] and there's millions of people.
[1:21:14] He says
[1:21:16] television
[1:21:18] a theophony. He said a theophony because
[1:21:21] Apostle Paul is saying we have another
[1:21:23] body
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and we go from this body right to that
[1:21:26] body. We take one step at a time and
[1:21:28] step into the unknown realm, eternal
[1:21:31] realm. And we're in another body. the
[1:21:33] one that God had ordained for you
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; when he made man in the first place
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; in the image of God made he man in the
[1:21:43] image of God and he took then chapter
[1:21:46] two of Genesis took out of the earth and
[1:21:48] formed him a body and breathed into him
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; that spirit man
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; because this body here this is not the
[1:21:56] image of God that man that's inside
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; that person that's inside of you
[1:22:03] Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's the unseen one.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks about the outward
[1:22:08] man and the inner man.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; It's two people.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; You have an inner person. It's not this
[1:22:14] flesh that it's not my fingers or my
[1:22:17] ears or my nose that craves for God.
[1:22:19] It's my soul.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; It's the inner man that craves for God.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; No part of my body desired to be holy
[1:22:28] and desired after God and be pure, but
[1:22:30] the inner man did. And that's a man you
[1:22:33] have to look at.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's a man you have to be concerned
[1:22:36] with.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're feeding the inner
[1:22:39] man.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That you're listening to the desires of
[1:22:43] the inner man
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; that God speaks to.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; So he said it's like a a theophony can
[1:22:50] be here right now, but you can't see it
[1:22:53] because these eyes weren't made. These
[1:22:55] eyes are made to see material things,
[1:22:57] this life.
[1:22:59] But as as we sit here this moment,
[1:23:02] voices are going through this room.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Bodies.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; If we had a television camera here, we
[1:23:12] wouldn't only pick up your p picture,
[1:23:15] but they'll have a picture of somebody
[1:23:16] that's sitting over in in Moscow
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; or in Rome
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; or someplace else, and they'll pick up
[1:23:24] their picture and send it right here.
[1:23:25] The image of that person would be seen
[1:23:27] here.
[1:23:29] with the birth marks and the clothes and
[1:23:31] the color. So, colors are going through
[1:23:34] the room.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; The camera doesn't invent it. It only
[1:23:37] picks up what's there
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; and transmits it by a certain channel.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And that's the channel that God wants us
[1:23:46] to be in.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Not a television channel, but a channel
[1:23:50] of the Holy Spirit, which is the sixth
[1:23:53] sense.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense, which is a sense, and
[1:23:56] that's faith.
[1:23:58] You've got your feeling, your taste,
[1:24:00] your smell, your hearing, your sight.
[1:24:02] You've got those five senses. But the
[1:24:04] prophet says you have a sixth sense.
[1:24:06] It's faith.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And faith claims the promise of God and
[1:24:12] calls it finished.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Faith sees things that these eyes can
[1:24:17] never see.
[1:24:22] There's voices,
[1:24:25] there are sounds, there are sights,
[1:24:27] there are colors, there's forms of
[1:24:29] bodies going through the room. And it
[1:24:33] goes on to say that was here
[1:24:37] that was here in ancient times.
[1:24:40] Television was here when Adam was here.
[1:24:45] When Moses was here, when Elijah was
[1:24:48] here, when Jesus was here, and all
[1:24:52] through last 2,000 years, it was here.
[1:24:54] But they only discovered it in this
[1:24:56] time. Not because they weren't smart
[1:24:58] back then, but it wasn't for that
[1:25:01] season. But why did God allow that
[1:25:04] technology to be discovered now to
[1:25:08] present to the people and make them
[1:25:10] ready for a prophet's message that could
[1:25:12] make reference to that and say now in
[1:25:15] conclusion, listen very closely, so is
[1:25:19] Christ here.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; So are the angels here.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; So is the unseen world here.
[1:25:33] And if you live just for this life,
[1:25:35] you're going to miss that one.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You'll miss that one.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And in the millennium,
[1:25:42] it will only be more real."
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; That which even science has picked has
[1:25:50] picked up on will only become more real
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; in the millennium.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And Christ is here. Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what why God raised
[1:26:03] that ministry up in a prophet's office.
[1:26:07] Oh, many tried to duplicate it. They
[1:26:09] fell flat in their face.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I happen to know many tried to duplicate
[1:26:16] it. It's a shame and a sham.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; There was none that raised up
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; and said one after the other, reveal a
[1:26:26] secret of the heart. one after the other
[1:26:28] after the other after the other for over
[1:26:30] 30 years
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; and asked him is that the truth and it
[1:26:34] was the truth every time.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; When that kind of a ministry is sent
[1:26:38] then you want to know what that person
[1:26:41] speaks concerning this word is truth
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; wasn't 50% is truth
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:52] Christ is the only way it ever happened
[1:26:55] in the Bible.
[1:26:57] Glory.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You took a chance on something else. If
[1:27:01] you haven't been baptized that way, you
[1:27:02] need to be because you're being baptized
[1:27:05] into the word.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Not just into water, into the word
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; and in the resurrection.
[1:27:18] Oh, well, we'll get into it a moment.
[1:27:21] But what the the resurrection, you know,
[1:27:24] the resurrection could have happened
[1:27:25] this morning and if it wasn't for the
[1:27:28] grace of God. If it's not for the grace
[1:27:30] of God, you wouldn't even know it
[1:27:32] happened.
[1:27:35] The resurrection took place and the
[1:27:37] women ran to anoint the bodies
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ found the tomb
[1:27:43] empty. And a young man sitting there in
[1:27:46] a white robe said he's not here.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Go and tell his disciples. And they run
[1:27:52] out. Mary lingers behind sees a young
[1:27:56] man that looks like a gardener.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe someone like
[1:28:04] Brother Gary St. John
[1:28:08] or one of brother Don Alexander's
[1:28:10] workers
[1:28:12] or one of Vile's workers a young man in
[1:28:16] the landscaping he's a gardener
[1:28:20] says sir
[1:28:22] where have you taken him
[1:28:26] talking to the resurrected Christ
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and had no idea no concept that it was
[1:28:33] him
[1:28:36] Where have you taken him that I might go
[1:28:38] to him?
[1:28:41] Then just a little simple familiar
[1:28:44] thing. Mary
[1:28:51] Bonai.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; You want to be that kind of a person
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; say where have they taken him? Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I'm following in his footsteps. I'm I
[1:29:04] I'm interested in this group of people.
[1:29:06] I want to be in the fellowship of the
[1:29:09] saints.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Go and tell my disciples.
[1:29:18] And then two, walking on the way to
[1:29:20] Emmas. And listen friends, that happens
[1:29:22] to be one of brother Brandham's last
[1:29:23] services.
[1:29:26] Modern events made clear. You've heard
[1:29:28] me speaking it so many times. I hope you
[1:29:30] never get tired of it.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; To me, it's one of the most remarkable
[1:29:33] things that this ministry that God sent
[1:29:36] as a sign of the resurrection would end
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; with a resurrection message
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; in December.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; When people are thinking about
[1:29:49] Christmas, he's speaking about
[1:29:50] resurrection. Why? Because that was his
[1:29:53] ministry,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; the sign of the resurrection.
[1:29:57] And there were two men on the way to
[1:29:58] Emmas,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Cleopus and his friend. And they're
[1:30:02] going along. They're not talking about,
[1:30:04] "Hey, Cleopus, what did you get a raise
[1:30:06] this week?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Have you got your money invested in the
[1:30:11] right place?
[1:30:13] How's things doing at school?
[1:30:16] Did you finish the courses?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; How's that house coming?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; How's the building happening?
[1:30:27] Oh, what's happening down the church?
[1:30:30] Da da da da da da
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with that.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; They were talking about the events that
[1:30:36] had just happened.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; You hear me speaking this morning about
[1:30:40] the events of the last week. I look on
[1:30:43] those not merely as a tragedy to us and
[1:30:45] a loss to us, but as something that God
[1:30:47] did.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking at that and saying now,
[1:30:51] what is the purpose of God behind this?
[1:30:54] And they were troubled. We become
[1:30:56] troubled. They couldn't explain it. We
[1:30:58] can't explain it.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I want to I have something special to
[1:31:05] say to you young men.
[1:31:09] You all knew
[1:31:12] Silas at different levels.
[1:31:14] Some of you were very close. Some of you
[1:31:16] only knew him by name. Some of you only
[1:31:18] knew him. We went to church. We were at
[1:31:20] camp together. We were in the same cabin
[1:31:21] together.
[1:31:23] Somebody said, "Well, we're buddies.
[1:31:25] We're with with each other all the
[1:31:27] time." And maybe as buddies, you went
[1:31:30] places and did things and so on so
[1:31:32] forth, and it would be, you say, "Well,
[1:31:34] these Christian people, these people,
[1:31:36] they don't know what we did. They don't
[1:31:37] know where we Let me tell you something.
[1:31:41] I could take you all through the
[1:31:42] scriptures and God would take certain He
[1:31:46] would just pick one. He'd take a hold of
[1:31:48] a person and let a certain event
[1:31:50] happen."
[1:31:52] What God does is not based on what he
[1:31:55] was living.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; God takes a person. He can take an
[1:31:59] individual. He can take an individual.
[1:32:02] It just so happened that God began to
[1:32:04] stir his life just before he was taken
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; in a very deep way. But God has taken
[1:32:10] and they're written in the scripture.
[1:32:12] People that weren't even living for him.
[1:32:15] People had all kinds of other other
[1:32:18] ideas, other plans, other programs. and
[1:32:20] God raised it up as an example and left
[1:32:22] it in the scripture and the whole
[1:32:24] scripture is Christ.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Now that's hard for a person to
[1:32:30] understand but that's a revelation you
[1:32:32] need to get. God can take I I'll show
[1:32:34] you an extreme and this is no reference
[1:32:36] to brother Silas. I'll show you an
[1:32:37] extreme.
[1:32:39] Abselum,
[1:32:42] a beloved son of King David,
[1:32:46] who tried to take the throne from his
[1:32:49] father
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; by treachery
[1:32:53] and to win the hearts. And he had people
[1:32:55] around him that were saying, "You can do
[1:32:57] it, Abselum. You can do it. You've got
[1:32:59] the hearts of the people." And he became
[1:33:02] uh convinced and he's going to take the
[1:33:05] throne from his father. And then as the
[1:33:08] events happen,
[1:33:10] he's riding on his mule swiftly and his
[1:33:12] head is caught
[1:33:14] in a
[1:33:16] oak tree
[1:33:18] and he dies.
[1:33:22] Nothing spiritual about the man that we
[1:33:24] can see at all. But God takes the event
[1:33:29] and he uses the event and raises it up
[1:33:31] before the people. And we hear one of
[1:33:33] the most uh marvelous prayers that's
[1:33:36] issued in the scripture. Abselum, my
[1:33:39] son, Abselum, Abselum, my son.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; God taking right out of the bosom and
[1:33:46] soul of David the king, showing the
[1:33:50] spirit of Christ, no matter what was
[1:33:52] done against him, he would not hold it.
[1:33:55] His love was pure. And God used it in
[1:33:58] the scripture. Even though it even
[1:34:00] though the young man someone said,
[1:34:02] "Well, I I I contrived. I I spoke to
[1:34:05] Abselum. I worked with Abselum. We were
[1:34:08] working against David, which is working
[1:34:11] against God."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yet God used that event and it happens
[1:34:15] to be in the Bible. And the whole Bible
[1:34:17] from cover to cover is Christ.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't understand that." I'm
[1:34:23] glad you don't understand it. All right.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Because if God could only work within
[1:34:27] our understanding, he'd be a very small
[1:34:30] God.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; God works in his own mysterious ways,
[1:34:34] his glories and his glory and his power
[1:34:37] to demonstrate.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And I felt urgent upon myself today to
[1:34:44] especially address the young men. You
[1:34:47] young men, whatever time, whatever
[1:34:50] future we may have, a lot of
[1:34:53] responsibility rests upon your
[1:34:54] shoulders.
[1:34:56] Not to just sit and listen, but you must
[1:34:59] say, "What does the call of God on my
[1:35:01] life for? What am I to become? Am I
[1:35:04] going to become a deacon? Am I going to
[1:35:06] become a trustee? Am I going to am I to
[1:35:09] become a witness for Christ? Am I to
[1:35:11] become a minister of this gospel? Oh
[1:35:14] God, take me and use me and make me
[1:35:16] fruitful.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live just for things.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be consumed just with
[1:35:26] things.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be taken up just with
[1:35:29] what I see.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; It shall surely pass away.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; But the things that are unseen
[1:35:37] are eternal.
[1:35:48] this resurrection
[1:35:50] of Jesus and many sermons will be spoken
[1:35:53] today and they'll talk about it as a
[1:35:55] messenger also did the greatest week in
[1:35:57] all of history but they'll be talking
[1:35:59] about history I'm talking about the
[1:36:01] greatest generation that has ever come
[1:36:03] upon the face of the earth is this
[1:36:05] golden age
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; and that you and I
[1:36:11] I've got a lot lot of years on me. Not
[1:36:13] as many as some folks here, but I have a
[1:36:16] lot more years than you young people
[1:36:18] that fill these seats. And how glad I
[1:36:20] am. You're the ones. You have every
[1:36:23] possibility to enter in and see the
[1:36:26] resurrection. And don't forget what
[1:36:28] brother Biscll is saying to you. If
[1:36:29] you're consumed with just the physical,
[1:36:32] the material, what I see, what I taste,
[1:36:34] what I hear, and this life, you'll miss
[1:36:36] that.
[1:36:38] That's right.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; You'll miss it.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; You need to turn your focus and say,
[1:36:42] "Why did God send a messenger? What is
[1:36:45] this message all about? What is my
[1:36:46] pastor preaching about? Oh, God.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; From the depths of my soul, give me eyes
[1:36:54] to see into the unseen realm.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Let my faith reach there and touch God.
[1:37:05] Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I just need a few more minutes. I'm
[1:37:13] not going to be long this morning. I
[1:37:15] feel so
[1:37:18] pressed in my spirit.
[1:37:24] When Jesus came, just follow this
[1:37:26] closely. When Jesus came,
[1:37:30] the word, the very thoughts that had
[1:37:32] become word and God spoke them through
[1:37:36] the prophets in the Old Testament and
[1:37:38] they became the word of God.
[1:37:42] Then those words were merged
[1:37:45] into human form
[1:37:50] in the body of Jesus Christ. The word
[1:37:54] became flesh.
[1:37:57] It merged.
[1:37:59] That which is conceived in thee is of
[1:38:02] the Holy Ghost. And God commenced a new
[1:38:06] creation
[1:38:07] by his word. That which is conceived in
[1:38:11] thee is of the Holy Ghost. That holy
[1:38:13] thing shall be called the son of God.
[1:38:17] God gave origin to Jesus Christ. And
[1:38:22] Jesus Christ came forth in the world.
[1:38:25] And now the word there was no no body
[1:38:29] like that prior. Now the word became
[1:38:32] flesh.
[1:38:34] He lived a very short time and came now
[1:38:38] to the crucifixion because the word said
[1:38:41] he must be bruised. The word said he
[1:38:44] must be beaten. The word said he must be
[1:38:46] wounded for our transgressions. The word
[1:38:49] said and he be rejected. And he had to
[1:38:51] live all of that. And now he comes to
[1:38:53] the cross and death comes and a and a
[1:38:58] spear on his side and he gives up. No
[1:39:01] man take my life from me. I lay it down
[1:39:04] and I
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; will take it off again.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:39:15] the spirit the spirit was was taken from
[1:39:20] him. the spirit. He He released the
[1:39:22] spirit. And now the spirit which had
[1:39:26] been which was left the body. The body
[1:39:30] the word that was made flesh. Now the
[1:39:32] spirit the word is forming the spirit
[1:39:35] and the holy spirit of God comes down
[1:39:38] into into the individuals. The church is
[1:39:42] born.
[1:39:44] And 2,000 years has gone by. Over 2,000
[1:39:48] years or thereabouts. and the Holy
[1:39:50] Spirit has been in the church. But now
[1:39:53] there had to come a time when the the
[1:39:56] spirit and the word would become so
[1:39:59] perfectly formed in a people until that
[1:40:03] people could be identified as the bride
[1:40:06] of Jesus Christ so that the word once
[1:40:10] again now is in a in a form of human
[1:40:12] flesh. But it's another form.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It's a woman form. It's a it's a
[1:40:17] feminine it's a feminine spirit as Eve
[1:40:20] was taken from Adam. So we have been
[1:40:22] actually taken from Christ.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And we have his life not another life.
[1:40:31] And so in this time to achieve that
[1:40:37] getting into some swimming water
[1:40:40] to achieve that
[1:40:43] is that God had to come and personify
[1:40:46] himself. Brother Brandham makes a
[1:40:49] statement. Uh I just want you to hear
[1:40:52] this statement and then you'll get
[1:40:54] you'll get my picture and I'll show it
[1:40:58] to you in the scripture.
[1:41:02] talks about the dark ages
[1:41:04] and the reformation breaking forth.
[1:41:08] Talking about how the church as Christ
[1:41:11] died, the church went through martyrdom,
[1:41:13] went through the dark ages, and the seed
[1:41:15] had to die.
[1:41:17] And it says it came forth, it had to die
[1:41:20] so it could come forth in the
[1:41:23] reformation. Again, listen very closely.
[1:41:27] That seed as Jesus said, except except a
[1:41:31] seed die is buried,
[1:41:34] it abideth alone.
[1:41:37] But if it die, it brings forth.
[1:41:41] And he said the seed had to be buried
[1:41:43] like all seeds does. It had to die so it
[1:41:45] could come forth in the reformation
[1:41:47] again. And here it is. It came forth in
[1:41:52] the person of the reformation
[1:41:56] Martin Luther.
[1:41:58] The reformation
[1:42:00] came forth
[1:42:02] in the person of
[1:42:06] the reformation
[1:42:08] Martin Luther.
[1:42:10] The reformation came. That's how it
[1:42:12] came.
[1:42:15] God ordained that that person would be
[1:42:19] the one that would carry present and God
[1:42:23] through him would present the age of the
[1:42:26] reformation to the people and the people
[1:42:29] then could enter into it.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me yet?
[1:42:37] And so it was also when the second work
[1:42:41] of grace
[1:42:44] that second work of grace,
[1:42:46] sanctification
[1:42:47] came about through the person of
[1:42:51] sanctification or we say the message of
[1:42:54] sanctification through the person
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; of Wesley.
[1:43:00] And now we come to where the world and
[1:43:04] Christian world knows that there's to be
[1:43:07] a resurrection and there are to be some
[1:43:10] signs.
[1:43:11] Now you know
[1:43:15] stop for a moment.
[1:43:18] You can have a sign. We've got signs
[1:43:21] here. There's an exit sign here. An exit
[1:43:23] sign there. Exit sign over there. Well,
[1:43:26] you don't come into church on Sunday
[1:43:28] morning and say, "Oh, wonderful. That
[1:43:31] exit sign is still there." You don't pay
[1:43:33] any attention to it.
[1:43:36] You drive down the street and it says
[1:43:39] 184th Street or 186th Street, you don't
[1:43:42] pay any attention to it. You've gone
[1:43:44] there so many times, you just
[1:43:46] automatically turn. You're not
[1:43:47] interested in what the sign says. But if
[1:43:49] you don't know where you're going
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and you're going there for the first
[1:43:53] time and somebody has said you go down
[1:43:56] this 60th Avenue and then you'll see a
[1:43:59] sign and it'll say it'll say 186th
[1:44:02] Street and look hard on the right and
[1:44:05] you'll see Cloverdale Bible Way. That's
[1:44:07] the place where we're meeting
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; and you're watching the map and you're
[1:44:11] watching every little point. But now,
[1:44:15] now the fact you don't read this sign,
[1:44:17] you don't read the street sign, it
[1:44:19] doesn't mean they're not important.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; It just means at that moment perhaps you
[1:44:24] don't need them as bad.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And so we have spiritual signs and the
[1:44:29] prophet speaks of national signs and he
[1:44:32] refers to Israel. Oh yeah. Well, a lot
[1:44:35] of you been born since 1950, since 1960,
[1:44:40] since 1970, since 1948 when Israel was
[1:44:43] made a nation say, "Oh, that's old
[1:44:45] history." Oh, no, no, no. That's not old
[1:44:48] history. And furthermore, it's a sign.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And just because you've heard it and
[1:44:53] heard it and heard it doesn't mean that
[1:44:55] it's not a sign anymore.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; It's still a sign.
[1:45:00] And when fire breaks loose and fire and
[1:45:03] somebody's screaming out there's fire,
[1:45:04] the place is going, you say, "Where's
[1:45:06] the exit?"
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And then you're really glad the sign is
[1:45:10] there.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; And so you hear Israel is Israel's been
[1:45:15] born a nation.
[1:45:18] The the flag of David is is flying again
[1:45:22] over Jerusalem.
[1:45:24] And this is happening. And that's
[1:45:25] happening. And the other signs have been
[1:45:27] happening. And you heard it. And you
[1:45:29] heard it. You heard it. Don't fail to
[1:45:31] get this. Don't forget it's still a
[1:45:34] sign.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; You maybe have heard it so often that it
[1:45:38] doesn't have the same impact, but it's
[1:45:41] still a sign.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, God said, "I posted the
[1:45:44] sign. I showed the sign.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; I let a sign come." And then come and
[1:45:50] say, "Oh, we've heard all about the
[1:45:51] prophet ministry, etc., etc., And we've
[1:45:54] heard it so many times and how he called
[1:45:56] the people forward and so on. But you
[1:45:58] want to go back and say, "Lord, give me
[1:46:00] eyes to look into the unseen realm." And
[1:46:03] when you hear him say, "This is a sign
[1:46:05] of the resurrection."
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; I would stop.
[1:46:13] Resurrection.
[1:46:15] Oh, the resurrection morning. Oh, the
[1:46:18] resurrection morning.
[1:46:21] Oh, God. Oh God, let me be in tune.
[1:46:25] You've already posted this sign. The
[1:46:28] sign went across the nations and you
[1:46:31] called me.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Don't let me be out of tune.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Let me keep in focus.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; I want to stay in focus. And then God
[1:46:41] causes an event such as you've had in
[1:46:43] the last few days to startle you, to
[1:46:47] awaken you.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you why. because it says
[1:46:52] while we look
[1:46:54] and I noticed in the last week you're
[1:46:57] here praying you're here refocused
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and your jobs mean a whole lot less
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; and your future is put on the back
[1:47:07] burner and it needs to stay on the back
[1:47:09] burner.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; You need to move the f the the
[1:47:13] resurrection to the front burner. You
[1:47:16] need to move the message to the front
[1:47:17] burner. You need to move. You need to
[1:47:19] say, "What's God's will in my life?"
[1:47:22] That needs to be on the front burner,
[1:47:24] and it needs to stay there.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You have received the sign of the
[1:47:35] resurrection. And that's why you're
[1:47:36] here. This message is a sign of the
[1:47:39] resurrection.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Not a resurrection of the past. one
[1:47:43] that's coming.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; One that might be here.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; One that could have taken place this
[1:47:48] morning.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; You know how real that will be?
[1:47:59] Some of you folks might be in the
[1:48:00] street.
[1:48:02] You might be in a mall.
[1:48:09] You might be in a restaurant.
[1:48:14] Some young man or some young woman
[1:48:17] walk up to you one day
[1:48:20] say, "How do you do?"
[1:48:23] So, how do you do? Do I know you? Well,
[1:48:26] perhaps not.
[1:48:30] You go to a certain certain place of
[1:48:33] worship.
[1:48:34] Yeah, that's right.
[1:48:37] And they speak often
[1:48:40] of the rapture and the resurrection.
[1:48:42] Well, we do.
[1:48:45] And you know that they're going to come
[1:48:47] and perhaps be with the believers as it
[1:48:50] was with Jesus if it repeats maybe maybe
[1:48:53] a month, 30, 40 days and mingle.
[1:48:58] Or you remember that the scripture says,
[1:49:01] "And the graves were opened and many
[1:49:04] bodies were seen in the streets of
[1:49:06] Jerusalem."
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; I suggest to you, I ask you, who saw
[1:49:10] them?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Herod didn't see them. Caiaphas didn't
[1:49:14] see them. The leaders didn't see them.
[1:49:17] They didn't go to the synagogue.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; It's not that you're going to come in
[1:49:22] say, "Oh, I go to Cloverdale Bible Way
[1:49:24] and I'm going to meet them there." Don't
[1:49:26] count on it.
[1:49:30] You want to be in harmony with God.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You want to be in fellowship with the
[1:49:34] Holy Spirit.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And this, my friends, is what's going to
[1:49:40] happen. And they will say to you, you
[1:49:44] have a certain expectation. You know
[1:49:46] that the dead in Christ are going to
[1:49:48] rise.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, our pastors told us about that.
[1:49:55] I'm one of them. Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; You are.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I'm one.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; That's exactly. You say, "Why would I
[1:50:07] say that?" Because that's exactly what
[1:50:08] the Bible teaches. That's that's how it
[1:50:12] happened.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, dirt's going to fly
[1:50:18] up out of the graves." There's no place
[1:50:20] in the Bible that says that dirt fell up
[1:50:23] out of the graves.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; It says that they rose from the dead.
[1:50:26] God changed them in their atoms
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; and they came forth in the picture that
[1:50:31] God had for them.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; That's going to be unseen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Your buddies Jeremy, Joel, Nathaniel,
[1:50:46] Nathan,
[1:50:48] sorry,
[1:50:49] your buddies
[1:50:53] may not see this.
[1:50:56] You want to be sure you see it.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; People are saying, "Well, I wonder if
[1:51:02] I'll have enough faith for the
[1:51:04] resurrection." Let me end with this. I
[1:51:06] wonder if I'll have enough faith because
[1:51:08] brother Brandham says we haven't if we
[1:51:10] haven't got enough faith for healing. We
[1:51:12] scarcely have enough faith for healing.
[1:51:13] How are we going to have enough faith
[1:51:14] for the rapture?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; It's not faith that's going to just drop
[1:51:18] in at the moment you're raptured. It is
[1:51:20] this that a person has their focus while
[1:51:23] we look at things that are unseen. So
[1:51:26] I'm looking at the unseen. I'm looking
[1:51:29] at the promises of God. I'm looking at
[1:51:31] the message that God has sent. I'm
[1:51:33] looking at the sign of the resurrection.
[1:51:35] I'm looking at it today, tomorrow, this
[1:51:38] week, next week.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And it's that person that's going to
[1:51:43] have that experience. And if you have
[1:51:46] that experience, you meet someone that's
[1:51:48] resurrected.
[1:51:50] You don't find you don't find Mary the
[1:51:54] disciples after they identified they had
[1:51:57] trouble identifying him.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Imagine the resurrected word himself
[1:52:05] walking with you. Put yourself there.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Say I'm Cleopus's friend.
[1:52:11] I'm the young man Cleopus.
[1:52:15] Heavy-hearted.
[1:52:17] Why? because all he had seen was what
[1:52:20] had happened.
[1:52:22] Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet. We
[1:52:25] expected great things. We thought
[1:52:27] greater things were going to happen. Our
[1:52:29] hopes were anchored in him. We were
[1:52:31] going to have more great meetings. We
[1:52:32] were going to have more things happened.
[1:52:34] And it didn't happen. And now our whole
[1:52:36] world fell apart.
[1:52:39] And the word
[1:52:42] began
[1:52:43] to take the word
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; and speak the word. to those that were
[1:52:48] believers of the word.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; They knew what he was talking about. And
[1:52:53] they said, "Are you a stranger?" Says,
[1:52:55] "What are you sad about? What are you
[1:52:56] reasoning about?"
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Said, "Are you a stranger here? You
[1:53:01] don't know what has taken place just
[1:53:03] these last days in Jerusalem. Here he
[1:53:06] is, the person that had it all,
[1:53:07] experienced it all." He said, "What
[1:53:08] things?"
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; You know why he said that? He wanted to
[1:53:11] know what was in your heart.
[1:53:18] If it all happened now, let's say the
[1:53:20] resurrection happened now.
[1:53:23] I'm really bringing this down.
[1:53:27] Let's say the resurrection happened
[1:53:31] and those that had been asleep in Christ
[1:53:33] began to mingle with believers
[1:53:36] that have received the sign of the
[1:53:38] resurrection and have been brought into
[1:53:39] sharp focus with the events of this age.
[1:53:45] And you begin to have a meeting and a
[1:53:47] discussion with them. Say what? What was
[1:53:53] you look very sad? What's happened?
[1:53:59] The families have to forgive me because
[1:54:01] I'm becoming very personal.
[1:54:03] Say, well, we've been very heavy-hearted
[1:54:06] the last few days. Been very
[1:54:09] heavy-hearted le recently.
[1:54:16] What happened?
[1:54:18] Well,
[1:54:20] very close friend, very close associate,
[1:54:23] someone we sat in church with, someone I
[1:54:25] saw baptized, someone I went to camp
[1:54:27] with
[1:54:29] was taken tragically and suddenly from
[1:54:32] us.
[1:54:34] Is that right?
[1:54:36] And what effect did it have on you?
[1:54:41] Well, frankly,
[1:54:43] it had a very serious effect on me.
[1:54:47] It's caused me to refocus my life. I've
[1:54:49] had a complete transformation. I I see
[1:54:52] things totally differently now. I heard
[1:54:55] him speak. I heard his brother speak
[1:54:58] about when he got right up and achieved
[1:55:00] a great height in his his climbing of
[1:55:04] this mountain.
[1:55:06] His the effect on him was this must be
[1:55:09] like heaven.
[1:55:12] It's had an effect on me and my focus is
[1:55:15] on the unseen things. Then our pastor
[1:55:17] got up and just preached and pounded it
[1:55:20] home and it reverberated inside my soul
[1:55:24] and I'm determined to see the things
[1:55:27] that are unseen. That's my thirst.
[1:55:29] That's my yearning. That's my craving.
[1:55:32] I'm looking to the unseen.
[1:55:36] Then you have that individual say,
[1:55:38] "You're looking at it.
[1:55:41] You are seeing the unseen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; The resurrection you've longed for and
[1:55:47] yearned for has happened.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; You think I'm crazy? That's how it's
[1:55:56] going to happen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; According to the word of God, that's how
[1:55:59] it's going to take place.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And they're going to be multitudes and
[1:56:03] multitudes that miss it. Right.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; And as a messenger said to be coming to
[1:56:08] church the following Sunday
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; and having an altar call and thinking
[1:56:14] they're getting saved when the
[1:56:16] resurrection's already history.
[1:56:21] I said to you as a congregation as I
[1:56:22] close now
[1:56:28] this revealing
[1:56:32] and I don't want to get in trouble over
[1:56:33] this but this revealing of the son of
[1:56:35] man
[1:56:37] came in the person of the messenger
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; right
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther for the re for the
[1:56:42] reformation William Brham the revealing
[1:56:46] of the son of man came in that messenger
[1:56:49] in the person of that messenger and
[1:56:51] because he was faithful to the ministry
[1:56:53] and the word, we've been able to enter
[1:56:55] into it and thus we're here.
[1:57:01] Someone someone tuned me into a man on
[1:57:05] on a computer and he's walking around
[1:57:09] and and making really a boast of his
[1:57:12] association with with brother Brandham
[1:57:15] and got studs in his ear and through his
[1:57:18] lip and talking about all the
[1:57:21] supernatural and how the angel has come
[1:57:22] to him, how the pillar of fire has come
[1:57:24] to him and there isn't anything that can
[1:57:27] anchor back to the word. When I see that
[1:57:30] and I see mobs of young people swept up
[1:57:33] into it and the whole thing and some
[1:57:35] great emotional and the world and the
[1:57:38] and the banging of the bass and the
[1:57:40] drums till you can't even hear what the
[1:57:43] people are supposed to be singing and
[1:57:44] saying say, "Thank God
[1:57:48] I don't have to feed on that.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Thank God I've been delivered from that.
[1:57:53] Thank God we have a message that we
[1:57:55] have.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Forget who's next to you. Thank God
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; that he called you, that you heard his
[1:58:04] voice,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; that you're hearing him call today so
[1:58:07] you can look to the unseen.
[1:58:10] Thank God for eyes of faith.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Ah, this world is not my home.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. My treasures
[1:58:22] are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've heard his voice.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And as Job, we can say, I know my
[1:58:32] redeemer liveth, and in my flesh shall I
[1:58:35] see him.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Though the skin worms destroy this body,
[1:58:40] yet in my flesh shall I see him.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, don't sit in this
[1:58:45] service and miss that great time. Let's
[1:58:48] stand to our feet, shall we? Hallelujah.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, you've been speaking to
[1:58:57] us and dealing with us
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; almost in a strange way and we are
[1:59:04] submitting ourselves. We're just
[1:59:05] surrendering ourselves to it. However
[1:59:07] you lead, oh great Holy Spirit, you are
[1:59:11] our guide.
[1:59:13] We are the sheep of the fold. Lead us,
[1:59:17] oh shepherd. Lead us. Lead us. Take my
[1:59:20] words, oh God, not my words, but your
[1:59:23] words. Man's words will surely fail and
[1:59:27] pass away, but your words shall live
[1:59:30] forever, oh God. I pray that you'll take
[1:59:33] these few words and and and mark them
[1:59:37] indelibly upon the hearts and minds of
[1:59:39] the people. We see, Father, uh uh uh
[1:59:43] rising up, a church rising. Oh, it's a
[1:59:46] glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
[1:59:50] washed in the blood of the lamb. Oh, we
[1:59:53] hear them, Lord. We hear them not with
[1:59:55] these natural ears. And we see them, but
[1:59:58] not with these natural eyes. We see them
[2:00:01] coming. That great host, that great
[2:00:04] host, the messenger saw and mess that
[2:00:07] ran and they embraced one another. We
[2:00:10] see that host. I'm going to embrace
[2:00:12] them, Lord. We're going to embrace them,
[2:00:15] oh God. We're looking over. We're
[2:00:17] looking across the river and seeing that
[2:00:20] scene that's there. No death, no sorrow,
[2:00:24] no pain, no tears. Here we have tears,
[2:00:28] but there there be none. Oh God, our
[2:00:31] focus is there.
[2:00:33] Lord Jesus, if there's any that are in
[2:00:36] this audience today, oh Lord, not 100%
[2:00:40] certain, not 100% certain, but they
[2:00:44] would at least be honest and say, I
[2:00:45] don't want to miss that moment. I mean,
[2:00:48] I I I don't feel assured that I'm ready
[2:00:50] for it, but I don't want to miss it. I'd
[2:00:52] like to prayer. I want you to pray. I'm
[2:00:54] sincere. I want to make my life right. I
[2:00:58] want to be ready for that hour. You want
[2:01:01] to raise your hand? We're going to pray
[2:01:02] with you. Don't be ashamed. Don't be too
[2:01:06] proud to raise your hand there. I just
[2:01:09] want to be ready for that moment. Oh
[2:01:12] God, you see every heart. You see every
[2:01:16] heart even before the hand was raised. A
[2:01:19] heart of loyalty. A heart of desire. A
[2:01:23] heart Lord that yearns to be like you.
[2:01:27] Numbered in your group. numbered, oh
[2:01:30] God, with the believers with a white
[2:01:33] robed throng. Father, come by the Holy
[2:01:36] Spirit now, oh purging fire, oh
[2:01:39] cleansing flame, oh consuming fire of
[2:01:42] the Holy Ghost. Move, I pray, over this
[2:01:45] audience now. And may they forget who's
[2:01:48] next to them. May they forget it
[2:01:50] completely and call out to you, oh God,
[2:01:54] out of the sincerity of their soul. In
[2:01:57] the name of Jesus Christ, I commit them
[2:02:00] to you. I commit them to you now. Holy
[2:02:03] Spirit, take control. Take over
[2:02:07] in Jesus Christ's name. I want you as
[2:02:10] individuals say, "Holy Spirit, take full
[2:02:12] control of me. Take control of this
[2:02:15] service. May your will be done
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. In Jesus name.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. In the name of
[2:02:27] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:02:38] To your work Lord.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; May they find a place where they can
[2:02:41] meet you.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; May they speak to you out of the depths
[2:02:44] of their soul. May they say oh God what
[2:02:47] is really on their heart
[2:02:50] in Jesus name
[2:02:53] in Jesus name.
[2:02:57] Jesus name.
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:10] You know, the Bible even speaks about
[2:03:12] those
[2:03:14] that come before God and the rich and
[2:03:18] God said to them,
[2:03:21] "You had your
[2:03:23] pleasure on earth. You had your
[2:03:25] blessings. You had your benefits. You
[2:03:26] had everything."
[2:03:29] I want to move that out of the out of
[2:03:31] the material realm for just a moment and
[2:03:34] say to this audience spiritually,
[2:03:37] I don't know of any people
[2:03:41] as bountifully provided for as the
[2:03:44] believers of this message. And God will
[2:03:47] say, "What did you listen to every
[2:03:49] Sunday? What did you listen to in the
[2:03:51] house of God? What did you hear? Did you
[2:03:53] feel my presence?"
[2:03:57] Well, yes, I did. What did you do with
[2:03:59] it? Did you hear me speaking? Yes, I
[2:04:03] did. What did you do when I Well, I just
[2:04:06] hung my head. I didn't say anything. Did
[2:04:08] you feel
[2:04:10] an urgency to call out and say something
[2:04:14] to me when I talked to you?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Did you feel an urge to say it?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, I did.
[2:04:25] So, in this life,
[2:04:27] you had a bountiful life. No one so rich
[2:04:30] as that.
[2:04:32] I've traveled the world. Dear friends,
[2:04:36] let me tell you, I know of multitudes,
[2:04:40] multitudes of people that wish they
[2:04:43] could trade places with you right now.
[2:04:46] They wish they could raise their hands.
[2:04:49] The blessed people in China who are
[2:04:51] listening right now and being translated
[2:04:54] into their language, they wish they
[2:04:56] could be here. They'd love to be able to
[2:04:59] express themselves like you can
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; and perhaps won't
[2:05:05] and they do at the risk of their own
[2:05:10] protection.
[2:05:11] Oh God, let us be thankful for what we
[2:05:15] have received. Let us appreciate this
[2:05:19] glorious, glorious truth and word that
[2:05:21] he has sent to us.
[2:05:24] [Music]
[2:05:29] I'm not here to be
[2:05:34] dramatic,
[2:05:36] but I am here to be truthful.
[2:05:39] My my same Lord,
[2:05:43] my Lord
[2:05:45] has said in his word
[2:05:49] and I can take you to many places where
[2:05:52] he called and he called and he moved and
[2:05:55] he spoke and he couldn't get a response
[2:05:57] out of people
[2:06:01] and he poured out every everything he
[2:06:03] could upon them. And then he says these
[2:06:06] words and they've always said a shudder
[2:06:07] through me. And then you'll call
[2:06:14] and his next line is frightening and I
[2:06:17] will not answer.
[2:06:23] That's written in the word of God a
[2:06:26] number of times and when I run into it,
[2:06:29] it causes me to shudder inside. And then
[2:06:32] you'll call. I've called. I led you. I
[2:06:35] fed you. I did everything. I poured out
[2:06:37] everything on you. I gave you all the
[2:06:39] land. I gave you all the inheritance. I
[2:06:41] just gave you the blessings of God.
[2:06:45] And I spoke, but you wouldn't answer.
[2:06:49] And then he tells, "Then this is going
[2:06:51] to happen. It won't always be like this.
[2:06:53] And then you're going to call
[2:06:57] and I won't answer."
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:02] It's a serious moment.
[2:07:04] But that's the truth of God's word.
[2:07:08] We're not here to try to use some
[2:07:10] emotion, but we're here if he's speaking
[2:07:13] to you. I say to you, in the name of the
[2:07:15] Lord, move everything out of the way and
[2:07:19] respond. Here I am.
[2:07:22] Speak, Lord. Do what you do with me. I'm
[2:07:25] here to hear. I'm here to listen,
[2:07:31] Father.
[2:07:33] Now I've spoken things that have been
[2:07:36] resting deep on my heart and I pray
[2:07:39] father at this uh serious moment there
[2:07:42] were many serious moments Jesus even
[2:07:44] when you were speaking to your disciples
[2:07:47] and you saw the people leave you
[2:07:50] actually saw them leave and turn away
[2:07:53] from the word when their own heart was
[2:07:55] saying it's truth yet they said I I
[2:07:58] cannot I
[2:08:00] I I just can't make that decision. and I
[2:08:02] can't surrender everything. Lord, don't
[2:08:06] I'm asking you don't let it be that
[2:08:08] there's those listening to me this
[2:08:10] morning that are going to encounter that
[2:08:13] time. Oh God, I'm I'm pleading with you
[2:08:15] and pleading with them because I've
[2:08:18] poured out all my strength, oh God,
[2:08:20] seeking you and praying, Father, that
[2:08:22] you would utter words this morning
[2:08:26] that would change lives and transform
[2:08:28] them. Oh God, I commit them now to you.
[2:08:33] I commit their future to you
[2:08:36] and their eternal destiny to you by the
[2:08:40] Holy Spirit.
[2:08:42] I leave them in your care in Jesus
[2:08:45] Christ's name.
[2:08:47] In Jesus Christ's name,
[2:08:51] speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. to place.
[2:08:57] Speak my
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:10] sing and I'll be quick to answer.
[2:09:20] Sing my Lord.
[2:09:26] Sing my Lord.
[2:09:34] Speak and I will answer.
[2:09:39] Lord send me.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[2:09:48] I'm just a passing through
[2:09:53] my treasures are laid out
[2:09:57] somewhere.
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:01] The angels beckon me
[2:10:05] from heaven
[2:10:09] and I can't feel
[2:10:13] in this world anymore.
[2:10:17] Oh Lord,
[2:10:19] you know
[2:10:21] I have no friend like you.
[2:10:25] If heaven is not my home,
[2:10:29] then what will I do?
[2:10:33] The angels
[2:10:35] me
[2:10:37] from heaven open door and I can't feel
[2:10:43] at home in this world anymore.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; While we're standing, while you're
[2:10:50] listening so nice, I want to tell you
[2:10:52] what brother Biscll expects. I don't
[2:10:55] necessarily expect a great big alter
[2:10:57] call. That's not it. We've seen that.
[2:11:00] You've been there.
[2:11:01] What I expect is men and women to make
[2:11:05] do business with God.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Be converted.
[2:11:10] Change in your mind.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Say, God,
[2:11:14] your will shall be my will.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; I surrender myself to you from this day
[2:11:20] forward.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; I'm done with the world.
[2:11:23] Let me ask especially I've been
[2:11:25] addressing young people because this has
[2:11:26] been such a focus on the young people
[2:11:30] because of Silas's life. I'd like to ask
[2:11:32] you young people. How long do you plan
[2:11:34] to live kind of what have you got in
[2:11:36] your mind?
[2:11:39] Are you going to live to be 40, 50, 60?
[2:11:41] No, I plan to live longer than that.
[2:11:45] Good.
[2:11:46] And I hope that you do. Do you plan to
[2:11:49] be healthy?
[2:11:51] Yes, I I plan to take care of myself. I
[2:11:54] want to be healthy.
[2:11:57] And you're going to live
[2:12:00] 50, 60, 70, 80 years.
[2:12:03] Let me give you some advice to do
[2:12:05] exactly what I've done. I've walked up
[2:12:08] to a tree. You say, "Now, Brother Bisco,
[2:12:10] now we sure know that something's gone
[2:12:12] up wrong upstairs. I've walked up to a
[2:12:14] tree and looked at the bark on a tree
[2:12:20] and that I I spoke to myself, that bark
[2:12:23] has been on that tree longer than I'm
[2:12:26] going to live.
[2:12:28] This tree has been here for 200 years.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; A tree
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; just bought me life. You've been here
[2:12:36] 200 years.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; God, am I not worth more than this tree?
[2:12:41] Yes.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I got to be gone in 60, 70 years. The
[2:12:45] bark has been on that tree longer than
[2:12:47] I'm going to live.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; You know what that makes you feel about
[2:12:50] that big?
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And then somehow faith anchors in. The
[2:12:55] God who caused that tree to live and to
[2:12:58] give it life and to make it strong. That
[2:13:01] God's got a life for you and got a life
[2:13:03] for me.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:13:10] There's a song that says I'm pulling
[2:13:12] hard. There's a song because I don't
[2:13:14] want a flash in the pan. There's a song
[2:13:16] that says what then?
[2:13:19] And I made a decision when I was a young
[2:13:21] man
[2:13:23] in my late teens.
[2:13:25] And I just decided the world is not a
[2:13:29] place for me. I wasn't a preacher. I was
[2:13:33] just working in a doing labor work. I
[2:13:36] didn't have a profession, but I was done
[2:13:39] with the world.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; My That was a weak amen.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; How many here came to that place? You're
[2:13:46] done with the world.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; That's what I like to hear. And it was
[2:13:51] different from that moment because God
[2:13:53] says, "That boy means business. That boy
[2:13:56] means what he says. And I'm going to
[2:13:58] give him the Holy Spirit because he
[2:14:00] can't live it by himself. I'm going to
[2:14:02] give him the energy. I'm going to give
[2:14:04] him the power.
[2:14:06] God wants you to make that kind of a
[2:14:08] decision. You're done with the world.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; You're done with sin.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; And if you're not, I announce to you,
[2:14:15] sin has wages.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; And it will surely pay you on payday.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; And the wages of sin is death.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:34] I'm
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; done with the work.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; I'm pulling for you for all I can.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Some of you young men, perhaps young
[2:14:45] ladies,
[2:14:47] you're going to give an answer for this
[2:14:49] kind of a meeting. God's going to say,
[2:14:51] "Didn't I talk to you? Didn't I speak
[2:14:54] directly to your soul?" And you're going
[2:14:56] to say, "Yes, you did. Yes, you did."
[2:15:02] Don't ever think for a minute, oh that's
[2:15:04] just brother Biscoll, that's just the
[2:15:07] way he that's just brother Ray, brother
[2:15:09] Lance.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even be keeping you right now
[2:15:18] if it wasn't feeling the same the same
[2:15:20] thrust in me. It says go up to the site.
[2:15:23] Why am I going there? I say why am I
[2:15:25] saying these things? because there
[2:15:27] somebody
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; hasn't hasn't come to that very spot.
[2:15:32] I'm going to do business with God
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; and I am done done done with the world.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Here's an example. This young man right
[2:15:40] here, I have respect for Jason
[2:15:47] because he had not surrendered his life
[2:15:50] to Christ.
[2:15:53] And for 21 years,
[2:15:56] he sat in this church.
[2:15:59] And I dedicated him as a baby.
[2:16:03] And when he was 18 and 19 and 20 years
[2:16:05] old, sometimes I'd be stepping outside
[2:16:09] while the Lord's table and communion and
[2:16:12] footwashing was being made ready. And I
[2:16:15] see him sitting
[2:16:17] sat in the service here, but he'd go out
[2:16:19] there while the communion was being
[2:16:23] Jason,
[2:16:26] are you not going to take communion?
[2:16:28] Not going to have footwashing? No. He
[2:16:30] says, no. Just as respectful as could
[2:16:34] be. And I just thought, God bless you.
[2:16:37] One day it's going to happen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; One day it'll happen. And one day it
[2:16:42] happened.
[2:16:44] One day it happened
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; and I don't even remember the day. I
[2:16:48] don't even know how it happened, brother
[2:16:49] Jason. But I'm so glad I've used your
[2:16:51] example over and over and over amongst
[2:16:54] others. If God's not dealing with you,
[2:16:56] you stay right there under the sound of
[2:16:58] the gospel. You respect it. You believe
[2:17:00] the message with all your heart. You
[2:17:02] said, "I know this is it. I'm going to
[2:17:04] stay right with it."
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; And God will honor that.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:12] Just over in the glory land
[2:17:18] et
[2:17:20] [Music]
[2:17:39] world anymore.
[2:17:46] I have no friend like you.
[2:17:50] If heaven is on my
[2:17:54] Lord, what will I do?
[2:17:57] The angels
[2:17:59] me
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:04] and I can't feel at home in this world
[2:18:09] anymore. When the redeemed are gathering
[2:18:12] in,
[2:18:13] when the redeemed are gathering in,
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm back in the Bible way
[2:18:19] house.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; I feel at home like we've got 10 or 20
[2:18:24] people there.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:27] You're the same kind of people. Oh, the
[2:18:30] same kind of message. When the redeemed
[2:18:32] are gathering in, you mind if I rejoice
[2:18:34] a little bit? Hallelujah. Just rejoice
[2:18:37] with me and we're going to close right
[2:18:38] away.
[2:18:40] thinking of the rapture in our blessed
[2:18:44] home
[2:18:46] when we
[2:18:48] are gathering in.
[2:18:51] Oh, how will we raise a heavenly apple

[2:20:02] and fall.
[2:20:04] Oh, hallelujah.

[2:20:11] when the redeemed
[2:20:14] are gathering in
[2:20:17] saints will sing redemption and story
[2:20:20] with their voices loud and strong.

[2:23:29] That's why I'm preaching with all my
[2:23:31] heart and soul.
[2:23:34] Enter in thou blessed of the Lord. Enter

[2:23:44] faithful servant
[2:23:46] or depart from me I never knew you only
[2:23:51] two things you're going to say
[2:23:53] short isn't it not doesn't take very
[2:23:56] long to say it
[2:24:01] even if we have to be like that one man
[2:24:04] says I can't find your name in the book
[2:24:06] can't find your name. It's got to be
[2:24:09] there.
[2:24:11] And he found one Jesus Christ who stood
[2:24:15] on his behalf. Says he stood for me when
[2:24:18] I was on when they were on earth and I'm
[2:24:20] standing for him now.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Ddier, I wonder if you'd come
[2:24:25] and dismiss us in prayer, please.
[2:24:31] [Music]
[2:24:37] Gracious Father,
[2:24:40] we're so thankful today for your grace
[2:24:42] among us. Lord,
[2:24:45] [Music]
[2:24:46] how you would come and you'll take your
[2:24:48] word and
[2:24:51] you'll do the same thing you did when
[2:24:53] you're here, Father,
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:56] to prove that you're not a God of
[2:24:58] yesterday or a God of tomorrow,
[2:25:01] but you're the God of this very hour,
[2:25:04] this very moment.
[2:25:06] Yes.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; And you'll take modern events
[2:25:10] happening right among us
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; and take the word and make it plain.
[2:25:18] Touch your heart and reveal that this is
[2:25:20] your doing among us. Oh God
[2:25:25] on this resurrection day. We give you
[2:25:27] thanks to know that you're alive.
[2:25:29] that truly you've been lifted out out of
[2:25:31] history
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; and you're an everpresent help in time
[2:25:36] of need, oh God. And we came this
[2:25:40] morning needing a touch from you,
[2:25:42] needing, oh God, a move of the spirit in
[2:25:45] our lives and praying and desiring that
[2:25:48] you'll have your own way. And we
[2:25:50] recognize
[2:25:52] that you did your work among us today.
[2:25:54] Father,
[2:25:56] those that have made a decision for you,
[2:25:58] let the great Holy Spirit, the
[2:26:00] quickening power come and recognize, oh
[2:26:03] God, their decision, knowing that they
[2:26:05] made a momentous decision. This is your
[2:26:08] way. They've chosen you today, Father.
[2:26:11] Honor them with that divine life that
[2:26:13] will stand and cause them to stand in
[2:26:16] this hour. We thank you for remembering
[2:26:19] us this day. We thank you for sending
[2:26:21] your word among us once again. We thank
[2:26:24] you for showing yourself
[2:26:27] real and alive this morning. We bless
[2:26:30] your holy name, Father. We embrace your
[2:26:33] word. We receive it, oh God,
[2:26:37] and we want to mix it with faith and
[2:26:40] watch it benefit us, Lord Jesus. Bless
[2:26:44] each one this morning. I pray your
[2:26:46] servant for being obedient
[2:26:49] and for his son and daughter of God who
[2:26:51] has come and listened attentively, oh
[2:26:54] God, we believe your word was not sent
[2:26:57] in vain, but it has accomplished its
[2:27:00] very purpose. Go with us this afternoon,
[2:27:03] Lord, and return us ready to hear again
[2:27:06] what the spirit will say to the church.
[2:27:09] We commit all things to you now and we
[2:27:12] thank you for your grace in Jesus name.
[2:27:15] Amen.
[2:27:19] God bless you. We dismiss you in the
[2:27:20] name of Jesus. Do greet one another
[2:27:23] warmly with a real Christian handshake
[2:27:27] and smile. And God be with you and we'll
[2:27:30] see you this evening. You're dismissed
[2:27:31] in Jesus name.
