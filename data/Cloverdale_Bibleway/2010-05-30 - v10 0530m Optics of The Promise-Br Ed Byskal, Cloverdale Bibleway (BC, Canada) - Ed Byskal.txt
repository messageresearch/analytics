[Music] Even as you walk away, I see you restored. [Music] Though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. [Music] I see you fully satisfied behind the veil. The tokens applied. There's blood on the door. That door is now closing. I'm still believing, Lord. An eagle blind. And wrapped in heavy chains stumbles down pleasure dark lane. Shake out the feathers replace with thorns if through fiery pain a sinner soul can be reborn. But even as you walk away, I see you restored. Though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied behind the veil. You can no wonder again. Perfect. Release in him. Please yield as he speaks today. Time is slipping away. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Even as you walk away, I see you restored.

I see you there. behind the veil and I'm belieing here [Music] behind the veil behind Find the veil. [Music] Hallelujah. We're thankful for the token. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just we want to turn the service to our pastor. Now, if we just sing, we are standing on holy ground. And there's a announcement here from the deacons. All the vehicles in this middle section of the parking lot where the handicap spaces are and down need to be moved immediately at the close of the service. They're going to pull the portables out and they can't exit here without those vehicles being moved. So, if you're parked in this section immediately right out here, uh if you could just move your vehicles when the service is done so that they can haul the portables out. Amen. Let's uh invite our pastor now as we sing. We are standing on holy ground. Oh, we are standing on holy ground. Oh my god. [Music] [Music] and his presence. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] Jesus. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. We dancing together. [Music] Jesus. [Music] We are standing in his presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful place to stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; We haven't come here to greet one another, but we've come here indeed to stand on holy ground and to meet with our our Lord Jesus Christ in a special way. Uh I know they've already announced the service for the camp this evening at 5:00 and uh brother Dioka uh really had some trials. We had some trials as a result of the immigration department and uh so he got uh delayed down in Seattle. Uh but everything worked together for good. &gt;&gt; So they were able then to have a Friday night service, Saturday night service, and uh Sunday uh the they're meeting with us now streaming. And then tonight we're we'll be all together at the camp. So we invite everyone who can possibly come and we're not able to stream that service uh the evening service I don't believe but you uh we we want you there in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be at the camp and uh brother Dio is going to be speaking and I really feel humbled, you know, that he comes this far and he spoke to perhaps 100 people or less last night. Uh but you know, God's ways are not our ways &gt;&gt; and God's not number conscious. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care whether we're 50 or five or 5,000. He just doesn't care. &gt;&gt; He cares about his will being done. So we pray that today his perfect will will be done here &gt;&gt; and we want to greet all who are on the streaming uh congregation also from whatever countries. It would just be a joy to have them from, you know, whether it would be from Nigeria or Zambia or the United Kingdom or Norway or Switzerland or New Zealand and that part of the world down there. Singapore, we just hear from them regularly. Probably no less than 25 nations right at this moment are live streaming uh the service, hearing you sing, hearing you worship, and they're worshiping with you. Uh, brother Randy sent me uh an attachment this morning which I didn't read alto together but uh somebody you know they get all stirred up some groups about this branomism and this cult and generally when you read it you know you say well there's some little groups and they're scattered off here and there and everywhere but this was quite different. This was saying this movement happens to be the fastest movement, fastest growing movement in Africa and we must do something to stop it. I just kind of smile. I just say go for it fellas. The more you do, the better it is. How can you fight God? How can you fight his word? So, I I just uh uh thanks for sending that to me, Brother Randy. And I was thinking while we're standing here and while I was in the study and brother Ryan was leading you in worship and it was just so wonderful in the songs, I thought, you know, they come from the east and west. Even here, they've come from so many different places. They come from the lands a far. There's brother Dioa there in Seattle streaming the service right now and brother Caillou's up in Edmonton preaching uh I guess for brother Harold Hilderbran and and my they can just come uh uh truly well the whole earth is the Lord's &gt;&gt; and the fullness thereof &gt;&gt; and he can do what he wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so here we are. I'm going to ask that you'll join with me and we're just going to sing that verse. They come from the east and west. They come from the lands afar. But we have we've come with a purpose and that's to dine with the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ryan, would you just lead us, please? &gt;&gt; Come from the east and west. They come from the land of peace with the king. as his guest. How blessed his children are. Behold his name. [Music] Bless my praise and his shine. Oh Jesus has set me free and I'm happy as I can be. No longer I care. His joke is so sweet to me. Oh my soul was as bright as night. My darkness has taken light. Now I shout the vtory for Jesus has set me free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we are so thankful that we are free. Free. Free. &gt;&gt; And whom the sun sets free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; We rejoice in this glorious deliverance and freedom. Now you have prepared Lord your word for us. And I ask that you will give us hearts to receive. Give us the capacity to receive by faith the engrafted word. Oh God, which is able to save the word that washes us. Cleanse us, oh Lord. Cleanse us, I pray. And I ask, oh God, that you will present yourself amongst us. And may you be the only one that receives the glory. You are indeed lovely to us. Lord, &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your people wherever they are gathered today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll have have you turn in the Bible uh to two scripture readings. The first one is Colossians the first chapter. And if you just bear with me, my voice is a little bit on the horse side, but I'm I'm here to conquer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Colossians, we'll start at verse 12. Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is the image of the invisible God? I'd like you to notice that please. Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature? &gt;&gt; For by him were all things created that are in the heaven and that are in the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. and he is before all things and by him all things consist. I'd like to read also in 2 Corinthians 4 and starting at the 14th chapter I'm sorry fourth chapter 14th verse. I'd like you to just really be prayerful as we read these scriptures. knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you. For all things uh are for your sakes and the abundant grace that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redounded to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not? But though our outward man, the visible man, &gt;&gt; the natural man, perish, &gt;&gt; yet the inward man, &gt;&gt; the invisible man, the unseen man, &gt;&gt; is renewed day by day. &gt;&gt; For our light affliction, &gt;&gt; which is but for a moment, &gt;&gt; workketh for us. You've got an employee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's your light affliction. &gt;&gt; He's working for you. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Our light affliction is working for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have this employee? &gt;&gt; I I've got a whole army of them. You ever feel that way? We've got a whole army of light affliction, but they're working for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; And we should be able to say glory &gt;&gt; glory &gt;&gt; while we look not at the things which are seen are late afflictions but at the things which are not seen &gt;&gt; for the things which are seen are temporal &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Every once in a while, uh, a minister stands at his pullpit to preach, wherever that might be, or a pulpit he's been given. And uh many times I won't say many times but there are some times when we are perhaps not absolutely certain you know just how to phrase something or how to convey it. But I I I would like to say to you this morning uh try to look on this service as a different service if you would please. Uh I'm trusting that out of this service you will receive something to ponder very very deeply and uh maybe even young your young people will remember something. I I think that we have lived I believe that we have lived in our living in a a very very unique time. Jesus said to the people in of of his day, he said, "If if you'd known at least if you'd known even thou at least in this thy day." In other words, this was for you. This was in your day. The things which belong unto your peace, they belong to you. But uh sadly to the people that Jesus was speaking, he said, "But now they are hid from thine eyes. I always while I don't take that uh personally and I don't take it for this congregation, I don't take it for believers in this area or wherever they are, the believers that I know and fellowship with. I I I still hold that before me that I don't want because this message is so unique. It is so set apart from all others. You see the message that you have been called by and that the the reason that you're here today, this message is unique in that it is connected inseparably to the unseen realm &gt;&gt; through a prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; And I have said here behind this pulpit before and I want to really emphasize today, this is not another church. This is not just another way to worship. We can sing the same songs as other people sing or whatever more. We open the same Bible that all kinds of denominational churches and people open. But we don't they do not have I'm not setting ourselves up. I'm simply saying they do not have the same connection because we are connected by a prophet who was connected connected continually to the unseen. &gt;&gt; We have a connection with the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; We have a message that was born in the unseen realm. We have revelations which we take I think quite casually uh most of the time but they came from the unseen realm and that is very very special &gt;&gt; very special and the way that the apostle Paul has worded this. He said, "For our light affliction uh which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look." I want to tie those together. Apostle Paul didn't put those in verses. Man afterward put those in verses. So he's saying that our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory while we look at the things that are not seen. &gt;&gt; It depends on where we're looking. &gt;&gt; Whether the affliction is doing us what it's supposed to do while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen. And so I I I believe that we also as message believers, we have uh uh we have the opportunity, we have the privilege, we have the availability that has been made to us to reach into the unseen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh if we so desire and hunger to do so. So I I want to just take this uh service in uh I want to take my time if you would and I want you to ponder it very deeply. I want you to take a note if you wish or make a reference if you wish and uh uh we'll we'll just see how far we go. Now uh apostle Paul he also states that though our outward man perish or the visible man, the physical man perish. Yet the inward man, the unseen man, the one you cannot visibly see is being renewed day by day. &gt;&gt; Now if you look at the visible, if you look at the outward, the outward will declare to you that you are going through a very hard time. Sometimes the outward Satan will use what you see physically &gt;&gt; and we are very very much controlled by our physical senses and we should not be &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; We should not be &gt;&gt; and we should remember that statement. We should not be controlled by what we see or what we are going through or what we experience. Be it good or bad, be it positive or negative, &gt;&gt; because all positive things are not necessarily great either. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It can be a real trap of Satan. So we we need to remember that. And uh so he says that while the one this is these are my words while the one the outward man because he's perishing becoming weaker and weaker the inside man or the unseen man is actually being renewed daily. And you cannot look at that. You can't you cannot put your hand on it. You can't write it down into a into a book or make any diary of it. But God's word has already declared it that while the outward man perishes or becomes weaker and weaker, and I'm not necessarily talking about age, it could be circumstances. It could be a lot of different things that just weaken us. If we if we look on the outward things, we will become weaker. And Satan will be very very faithful to point to those things and to I and and to magnify them to distract you. And but God is saying here that we need to be looking at the at the unseen because the unseen man is actually being renewed daily. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our light affliction workketh for us a far more exceeding weight of glory while we look at while we look not at the things which are seen, but that the things which are not seen. There isn't a person here alive that hasn't got a whole basket full of difficulties or problems that we're working through or decisions that we have to make. And that is I I I will just tell you that's that's what life's all about. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what life's all about. And there's no use of thinking, oh, when this is done or when I come to that, when I have finally achieve this or when this happens, uh that's not the case. Don't wait for that. Just make your decision. If you not made it, make it this this morning. Now, I'm going to be guided by the unseen. If God's word says I'm being renewed daily, I confess I am being renewed daily. That's what he has said &gt;&gt; and I I'm not going to be guided by what I don't see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or guided by what I see rather. Things which are seen are temporal. Now, these are scriptures and I'm just using these words in a little different phrasing. Things which are seen are temporal. The Bible speaks of the temporal, those things which are temporal. And the temporal is it's for a while, for a season, &gt;&gt; enduring only for a little time, for a little while. So, are we going to be dictated by something that is temporal? &gt;&gt; You say, well, the outward man perishes. Well, why why be directed by something else that's perishing? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's also it's also it's a moving target. &gt;&gt; What is affecting you isn't going to be the same tomorrow. &gt;&gt; It might be better. It might be worse. But the unseen will always remain &gt;&gt; because the unseen is God's word. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm speaking today on and you can remember this title if you would. Optics of the promise. the optics of the promise. Now, let me just put that in a in a natural uh uh in a in a natural setting first for a moment. Governments make promises, nations make promises, uh parents make promises, children make promises, friends make promises. we have we're all well acquainted with that and if you know and I said to my wife because I was just trying to you know get her thought in this channel and if I said to her you know cuz she loves her car. Brother Gary White used to call it a tank and so I almost acquired that same thing. I said Gary calls this a tank and she said I love it. So, my wife loves her tank. Don't try and take it away from her. It's 20 years old. And she says, "I'm going to keep it. There's nothing wrong with that car." So, I just said to her, I said, "Now, if I said to you, I'm going to make you a promise. I'm going to buy you another car." Well, right away, that activates the mind, does it not? Say, "I'm going to make you a promise. I'm going to buy you a car for your birthday." Oh, uh, you know, what color is it and what kind is it and what make is it and all the, uh, whole array of things that you could be thinking about. Uh, because the the the promise itself gives you optics, &gt;&gt; you understand? &gt;&gt; And the word of God is absolutely full of promises. the promises concerning uh the new body, the promises concerning heaven, the promises concerning the resurrection, they've been here for hundreds and hundreds of years. They've been in the scripture, but God made a promise, and I'm just I I'm just giving a little bit of background now, and I'll probably give a more detail to it as we move along. God God gave a promise to Abraham and said, uh, I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, he doesn't know. Is it is it desert? Is it mountains? What what is it? What kind of land is it? Where does it go from, you know, point A to point B? What what is this land like? Is it is it barren? Is it inhabited? Is it got water? What kind of land is this? Uh and it's I'm going to give you a seed. I'm going to give you a seed and your seed's going to inherit this land. And then as time goes on, God takes he takes the same promise and he keeps he keeps refining it or redefining it so he gets a little clearer picture of what it is, you know. And that's exactly what God has been doing for the bride of Jesus Christ down through the last uh 2,000 years from the time of uh of of the book of Acts, from the time that Jesus walked here physically until today, the promises haven't changed. But God has sent messengers and he has sent moves of God to redefine and to become uh clearer to us what our expectation should be. &gt;&gt; And that's what I find is very important. So the material things are the that's why we cannot afford to be guided by the material things or the temporal things because they're vanishing and they're passing away and the things which are not seen are eternal. Now, the optics of the promise, and I said all of these, I I don't want to spend time because I've got so much else I wish to say, but you know, nations, they have the G8 and the G20 and all of this. They're going to have it in Toronto in a few days. And they're they're they're spending almost a billion dollars, just under $1 billion to protect for a few days the leaders of the world from, you know, the security is going to cost uh the people or uh Canadians at least all of this money to try to protect them. and they're going to come together and they're going to hopefully some nations want other nations to make a promise that they'll they'll do something with greenhouse gases and they'll have a certain level so we can have an expectation and they make a promise then they try to determine you know if that nation will keep their promise or if they'll work towards certain targets etc and that's a nation and and really I don't think they have a whole lot of confidence that it's going to happen. But anyway, they make promises. Uh uh churches make promises. Religions make promises. And I've just been reading and it would probably surprise you and I just decided I wouldn't even take the time because it wasn't worthwhile. But there are a number of religions, major religions. If I read for you the c main fundamental criteria of the belief of the Muslim people, brother Brandham talks about Muhammad and would say Muhammadanism which it was mostly known as known as Islam Islam today. But they have certain uh fundamental faiths. If I read them to you, you'd identify with most of them. one God. The seek religion, one God. And and he he's a giver of grace. He's a giver of life. He can only be approached a certain way. But they don't never neither one of them come with Jesus in it. They deny that God has a son. That's for sure. He hasn't got a son and he doesn't have a chosen people because they don't want to identify that the Jews have any special place. But but you'd be surprised. You'd be shocked. And I just decided I wouldn't do it to you because it would really shock you that that many. Listen, friends, we're not unique with believing in one God. In fact, is if the trinitarians, you know, and the trinitarians come down on you say, "Well, you only believe one God." Well, I can tell you what the trinitarians are in the minority &gt;&gt; as far as the world is concerned. most the rest of the world that that's a Catholic faith &gt;&gt; that trinity born and invented by the Catholic church nan council but the the the one god many many believe that &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of millions of people believe in one god and they believe in the seek religion for example which is a huge uh religion from India they definitely believe that they have The final revelation. It is the final revealed truth. Same kind of terminology that you are very very familiar with. Islam. They have the final truth. They have the prophet from God Muhammad. They believe in Jesus Christ and he was a prophet also. And they say so all kinds of people believe. I walked into where this guru was in India and uh and and and right on right on the wall probably the largest figure he had was that of Jesus standing there as a statue with his hand up. Uh you know why you're saying all this brother Ed because I think a lot about it. I think what separates me? What really separates me from all these people? They say one God. I say one God. They say the God of grace and I say he's a God of grace. I say he's the only one that can. They believe in heaven. They believe in eternal life. They believe in the resurrection just like you do like I do. What what what separates us? What makes us really different? &gt;&gt; Because listen, we're staking our eternal destiny on this. That's right. &gt;&gt; We have promises that God has has stood behind and confirmed. But for us in this day, there's the one thing that I can tell you. You have a prophet that stood before multitudes of people, thousands, &gt;&gt; upon thousands. &gt;&gt; And you can hear it if you wish. And people say, "Well, first pull, second pull." Listen, forget that for the moment. God gave the first pull and God gave the second pull to catch the attention of the people so that he can he can he can require them to uh at someday say you were in the meetings you saw this and and millions did but the but the but the the defining aspect here for me is that God and the message we have connects us with the supernatural and the unseen world &gt;&gt; I can't bring down to you today unless God would give me some divine uh opportunity and some opening but just to think that a vessel in your time and my time that's why that's why I would say Jesus said if you'd only known this day &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; when these things have happened &gt;&gt; we should know and I know that we do know. But it it it has to have a greater effect than simply knowing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture says while we look, so we we keep looking at the unseen at the unseen. We have a we have messages and specific things within the word, within the message that we can say, I have something that was born in the unseen realm. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I have something that was delivered to me by a proven vindicated messenger. &gt;&gt; Who else has that? &gt;&gt; Does a billion Catholics have it? Don't have it. &gt;&gt; I'm not opposed to them. I'm just saying they don't have it. &gt;&gt; Do other denominations have it? They don't have it. &gt;&gt; Sorry, folks. They just don't have it. &gt;&gt; There's a over a billion uh Muslims. I'm not opposed to them at all. A lot of very fine people, very fine people, cultured people, good people. Not all of them are terrorists at all. There are a lot of good people, but they do not have what we have what you have. &gt;&gt; They they cannot say, "I have heard a voice." And here God's been so gracious. You have it available. You can I I plugged it in, listened for a couple hours this morning or in the middle of the night. Uh just to think there's Who else can do that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who else can do that? &gt;&gt; Did God just send it to make a sound &gt;&gt; or did God send it to give us uh some eyesight into the invisible realm? &gt;&gt; So that you have something to look at. Who else can take Paul's words? Who else can take Paul's words? Looking to the unseen, looking at the unseen. But you can. &gt;&gt; And and and you don't have to be learned. You don't have to be a certain age. You can look at the unseen. &gt;&gt; So we we have uh do you mind if I just take my time now? &gt;&gt; I want you to stay very very alert. We have three levels of of eyesight. We have the physical sight. We also have the sight of uh I would say the imaginary which is one of the channels of the spirit and we all imagine things and like I said soon as a promise is made then the im imaginary goes into action we begin to imagine things and that's where I would say that your emotional realm listen to this your emotional realm is full of illusions. something you think you see but it's not accurate &gt;&gt; and as you get closer or in your expectation it vanishes or it changes and it's different and it might prove just to be a complete illusion. &gt;&gt; That's why people serve even in the message they serve the message. Oh, what a revelation. Oh, they're just ecstatic. And a few years ago they're gone. Where are they? Oh man, they're off in the street. They're with some hockey game or baseball game or something else. They're gone. &gt;&gt; Was it a revelation to them? No, it was no revelation. A revelation becomes a part of you. &gt;&gt; A revelation is not something you learn. A revelation is something you experience. &gt;&gt; It becomes a part of your body, part of your whole soul, your whole being. &gt;&gt; And so there is a an illusion. And don't forget the emotions. &gt;&gt; You can just feel so wonderful one day. You just ask yourself, "What made me feel so wonderful today?" &gt;&gt; And you you'll find it'll be some circumstance or something else or or you feel down. &gt;&gt; You feel just so discouraged. You feel so low. They need to pick you up with a shovel. You say, "Well, what made me feel so low?" You'll find it's things that you see. things that are visible, &gt;&gt; things which have set up uh uh the optics of your imagination &gt;&gt; and you begin to project it out there. Projected projecting things that never happen. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're going to be quiet. I'm going to preach it anyway. And the third thing is there is sight which originates in the realm of the soul. &gt;&gt; A call of God like a call and I've spoken of that the call the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Brother Brandham refers to it as eyes of faith. Faith is not in the imaginary realm. Faith is not in the emotional realm at all. And it is a faith and absolute belief in the promise of God. And it's the same today. It was the same yesterday. And it'll be the same as long as we are around. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, um, Brother Brandham, he he gave this in his life story, and I hope this doesn't sound too fundamental because hang on to your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you can stay with me where I'm going. I was trembling, but where I'm going, there was a great gigantic tree. He said it was most beautiful. Now it's a great gigantic tree. This is the visible. And he said it was most beautiful. I could see its great mighty branches sway in the wind. Great huge trunk. He was a It was impressive because the physical makes it impressive. and he said, 'You know, I believe that this tree will be here for hundreds and hundreds of years. He was impressed with it. He said, 'Not long ago, I took a look at that old tree and it's just a snag. I said, Lord, I I just took that personally. I said, 'Lord, even if I'm just a snag, whatever's left, you know, you're the one we're not looking at, whether it's just a snag or whether it's a great big flourishing something, we're not going to be moved either way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, for here we have no continuing city. No, nothing here on earth that you can look at will continue. He said it's got to have an end. Everything that's mortal has to give way to immortality. &gt;&gt; So no matter how good we build our highways, how fine we make our structures, it all has to go. For here there is nothing can continue. Just the unseen is what continues. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So right here today, &gt;&gt; this is announcement to you. There is an unseen there. There's an inner man. &gt;&gt; There's an unseen realm. There's angels here. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ himself is here. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here. &gt;&gt; And if we actually saw that through the promise, it would make us even act differently. &gt;&gt; We would have a reverence. We would have a certain kind of an attitude that it would bring us into if we if we could see that clearly that the unseen is present. The unseen is eternal. The unseen is more real than the physical. &gt;&gt; More real. &gt;&gt; The unseen is going to outlast your problems. The unseen is going to outlast your sickness &gt;&gt; or your difficulties &gt;&gt; or whatever they might be. The unseen is going to outlast your successes &gt;&gt; and the good life &gt;&gt; are we on track &gt;&gt; in why Christ speaks faith doesn't look at the present time. Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks to see what God wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And works accordingly. &gt;&gt; He said that's what faith does. &gt;&gt; It sees what God wants &gt;&gt; and what God wants done and faith operates through that. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants. &gt;&gt; He said faith is a long range vision. &gt;&gt; It don't lower its sights. It holds to the target. &gt;&gt; Faith holds to the target. &gt;&gt; Some of you young people are going to be soon graduating or you have graduated. You'll have graduating ceremonies and another year has has gone by. You've had your you you have your marks and certain achievements etc. and you have your plans for the future. Just remember that's all a moving target. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's very much a moving target. Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith picks up God's binoculars, both of them, both sides, the New and the Old Testament." &gt;&gt; And sees every promise that he made, and faith sees it out yonder. &gt;&gt; Faith sees the promise. We don't want to read it like a promise box. We don't want to read it like just a scripture or a book that we have. But this is a great eternal unseen God. &gt;&gt; The invisible God that actually uh came down and spoke certain things and gave promises to human people &gt;&gt; of what he will do and how he will do it. And we see that he has been doing it and that should give us a lot of a lot of confidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith chooses that." Faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here. &gt;&gt; He looks at the end. &gt;&gt; He doesn't drop his sights down to look this way. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had a pair of binoculars and and tried to look down here? &gt;&gt; Tell you, you won't do very well. &gt;&gt; You need the binoculars for a long range vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't walk very stable if you have it right in front of you. &gt;&gt; And then in the third Exodus, he says, "May we be led to the tree of life that we might be a possessor of eternal life and see the hand of God and by the eyes of faith look beyond these shadows." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm speaking to a congregation whether it's a whether uh on the internet or wherever you live or whatever background you have. We all have our life of shadows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody does. &gt;&gt; And and if everything is bright and sunshine and glorious today, don't worry. I'm not speaking about the time that everything is easy and flowing. I'm talking about when you have the day of shadows. And we all have the times of shadows, but there's an unseen hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's guiding us. &gt;&gt; There's an unseen promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The promise, it may be visible, but the promise sets up optics. There's optics of the promise. &gt;&gt; And when you hear the promise, when you see the promise, even though you may not understand it clearly, you want to just declare that promise. I see something and not in a imaginary and illusionary way, but I see a promise and and you don't have to know a lot of things about the promise. You have to say, I know God said that. &gt;&gt; And I know that God will never deny that. &gt;&gt; I know that that is God's word. And even if I don't physically see what I think that promise should be doing, nevertheless, God's promise is absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Yay and amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your faith, you see, your faith reaches far beyond even this life. &gt;&gt; Your faith reaches into the eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the message, Door of a Door, he said, uh, I've often wondered when they would see his word manifested. What do they do about it? Uh oh. Well, he says some say, well, it's telepathy and another says it's some wild imagination. He said, examine it by the word. God's word promised it. The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but my word shall never fail. &gt;&gt; Open up the door of faith. And if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of God's Bible is for you, &gt;&gt; just as sure as that pertained to him, &gt;&gt; every promise pertains to you. &gt;&gt; As sure as it pertained to him, every promise pertains to you. And he said, "Your healing, the salvation, your freedom from sin and from selfishness and from your indifference and your little turtle shell that you pull yourself into, Christ wants to come in and be Lord and ruler and to set you free from these things." &gt;&gt; And whether you have it now or whether you experience it now, I'm going to preach down where we're at. I believe that he was. &gt;&gt; We all have experienced a little turtle shell. &gt;&gt; We kind of pull in. I'm going to just be here all by myself. Won't work. &gt;&gt; You've had that. &gt;&gt; He said Christ wants to come in &gt;&gt; and be the Lord and ruler. &gt;&gt; So, we are not uh as I said earlier, we're not unique in that we believe in the unseen. Uh we're not unique in the world in that this world is filled with sincere believers of different faiths and many believe as I said earlier in one God. But we are children of the promise of this day. Now this is where I really need your attention. We are children. We're actually we just say well children here we are. We're all children. We're brothers and sisters. All kinds of people call each other brothers and sisters, but I want to put this in a different context. Hello. &gt;&gt; You walked into this church. I want you to know that when you walk out, I'm I'm perhaps laying a heavy on you. The fact that you're here is a you are testifying and you're saying something. &gt;&gt; You're saying I I believe something. &gt;&gt; You're saying, "I'm here because I have a certain connection." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And perhaps you looked around in the service and to see who's here and who's not here and whatever more and those are all the physical things and they're all changing. The next time we meet it'll be a different crowd. &gt;&gt; Some of the same people will be here but others may not be here and then there may be more people here and whatever more that should have no effect on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I feel really good here now because I see so and so is here. That has nothing to do with that. That's a moving target. That might not be the same tomorrow &gt;&gt; or the next Sunday or whatever more. So, let's put that one aside. &gt;&gt; The things that are the things that are seen are are are temporal and they're passing. You're sitting here today and you feel reasonably well. you feel healthy and strong and say, "I feel really good today." That has nothing to do with it. Next Sunday, you might feel terrible. &gt;&gt; Might say, "I don't know what happened. I don't feel well." That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; That has absolutely nothing to do with it because that book of promises is not going to change by how you feel or what has happened or something good has happened to me. I uh you know, I I got I got a raise. I got a I got a refund from the tax department. Well, wonderful. We could all rejoice about that, but that that's not going to change things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It might just, you know, help out with something that is is for the moment. And so the one critical thing and I'm going to stay close to my notes right now. The one critical thing critical thing that separates message believers from all others is the abundant evidence of the unseen God manifesting himself through his prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; That is the one thing by irrefutable proofs. Irrefutable proof. What does it mean to you? &gt;&gt; I tell you, they're very, very important. &gt;&gt; They're very, very important. Irrefutable proofs of the attendance of angels. &gt;&gt; Of the unseen presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that light? No. Well, maybe they don't. Do you see that light? It's moving. is over this woman here. &gt;&gt; And then people could be looking all around physically. So their optic nerve isn't registering anything because they don't see it. And emotionally they might even be sitting in the in the in in the congregation feeling uh uh very very very much doubting uh perhaps even critical of the ministry of the prophet. But he's saying there's a light and it's hanging over this woman. But then he begins to speak &gt;&gt; and from somewhere from some source they say well you came from a certain place I see your daughter wrote you a letter and said I was you were going to visit her but your daughter wrote you a letter the letter's in your purse and said I was going to be in this city and so you you stayed at come to this meeting and this is your ailment and this is your problem or this is your dilemma. This is what your heart's cry is. Who did that? &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do with it? &gt;&gt; Say, well, no, it's on your hands. &gt;&gt; Is this too simple? &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're talking about you're you're you're sitting here today as a testimony. I plan to go to an unseen realm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You better have an unseen power to lead you there. You better have some proof that you believe in the unseen and you are connected with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're connected to it. &gt;&gt; How are you connected? Because God from the unseen realm has sent a certain word at this time and confirmed it was for this day and he spoke of it out of the heavens. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even I think of David Edwin Herrell, professor David Edwin Herrell from the University of Birmingham, Alabama when he wrote his book on the great movement that stirred the great revivals and stirring and changed the face of America and how he said and then when he came and I spoke with him as he came came up here and I spent a Saturday with him and I said why did you put brother Brandham first? You said the two giants Or Roberts and William Brandham and you put William Brandham first. I said and then you said in there that if it were not for the abundance of record of visitation of angels and if it were not for the supernatural which was in attendance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Irrefutable proof. Oh, &gt;&gt; they would have good reason to doubt concerning the visitation of the angels, but they had to believe that there was visitation of angels because of the material things that were happening. &gt;&gt; Why am I emphasizing it? That's your connection. &gt;&gt; The Mohamadan's a billion strong and Buddhist by hundreds of millions and all of these people. Listen, God God is a God is a God of the people of the whole earth. He filled the earth. He's given life to all people. And there are sincere people and innocent people and and ignorant people and humble people and people living in hardships and all the rest. I think of the whole the whole masses of the entire earth. &gt;&gt; I think of them. &gt;&gt; I think of how God looks on them. And when I do, I I get reduced down to see that there are certain scriptures that have been spoken of and prophecies which have been made and see that God in his grace, abundant grace, marvelous grace &gt;&gt; allowed you &gt;&gt; and I &gt;&gt; and a few others to somehow get connected &gt;&gt; and to see what we see. and he reached out wherever you were in the world or in a colony or in some other country and got a hold of you and you heard the word and somehow it spoke a reality to your soul and you said I cannot deny this. &gt;&gt; This is marvelous. And God in his sovereignty in his sovereign way connected you with the unseen realm. [Applause] And here you are today. &gt;&gt; Nothing good that you did. God connected you. &gt;&gt; And now for the first time you can say, "I can look to the unseen. I have some substance." [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; All kinds of churches can make promises. Preachers can make promises. I'm not here making some great promise to you. I'm here telling you that God sent a vessel &gt;&gt; to do a specific part and fulfill a certain part of the scripture &gt;&gt; and somehow God connected you to that ministry and that's the only thing that separates you from all six billion of humanity &gt;&gt; and you ought to be very very grateful. You ought to be very thankful. You ought to be very respectful. Say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Help me to understand, &gt;&gt; help me to appreciate &gt;&gt; what you've done. Thank you. &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, and I'm just going to go very very quickly because I just one one thought I want to uh derive from these about three or four verses. And the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, unto your seed will I give this land. This is right at the very beginning of Abraham's contact with God. and unto your seed will I give this land. And there he builded an altar unto the Lord that appeared to him. Then later on in Abraham's life, he says, "And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, this shall not be thine heir." Now, he's defining it because he's got a son, Ishmamail. And now God is defining it a little bit clearer. This will not be your heir. and and also he had he was speaking regarding his servant at this time who was over all of his household. He said he won't be your heir but he that shall come out of thine own bowels &gt;&gt; shall be thine heir. &gt;&gt; So now he's redefining it or not redefining it but defining it finer. And then further in Abraham's ministry um Abraham's life and walk with God, God said, "And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after the the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan." Now he's told him that what what land it is for an everlasting possession and I will be their God. So now he's enlarged on it. He said more and it gives the the promise has optics. I hope I'm saying that right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul picks it up in Hebrews. He says, "For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear, now I want you to stay real real attentive when God made promise to Abram." But now we are Abraham's royal seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is a royal seed of Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham the father of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has children. &gt;&gt; And I trust by God's grace we are one of those. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we had made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater. Oh, it wasn't enough to make a promise. &gt;&gt; No. Now he's going to swear because he could swear by no greater. He swore by himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured he obtained a promise. He said for men verilely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. He says, "Wherein God," now I'll be dwelling on this a while, wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs. Now, he's not talking just about Abraham, but he says to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, unchanging, inflexible, impossible to change to show, he said, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise. Are you are you Abraham's children? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham's God &gt;&gt; was determined not only to make him a promise &gt;&gt; but to continue to define the promise as time went on. &gt;&gt; We have not just remade had promises salvation and the resurrection and eternal life. Jesus spoke of that. But then the apostle Paul came the first church age messenger and he speaks of it more. We shall not all sleep. Some have slept in Christ but we shall not all sleep. But we shall all be changed. Jesus never said anything, but we shall all be changed. Paul said we shall all be changed. And so now it it's it's a promise and it sets up our our uh the optics of our imagination or our mind or maybe just within the realm of our soul. We shall be changed. Nothing can change that. This is inflexible. This is unchangeable. This is something spoken by almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says to show unto the heirs of the promise. You pray for yourself and pray for me now because this is where I've been questioning how I can say this and how I will get it across. The immutability of his counsel. He confirmed it by an oath. You know, you can make a promise. Then you may stand up in court and they say, "Do you swear to me that this is the truth?" the absolute truth and nothing but the truth. I do. &gt;&gt; So help me God. &gt;&gt; They would require that in a court. Or you might go down and say this. This is my record of the events. This is precisely what happened. Do you swear that that's the truth? Some say, well, you can't swear. All right. Do you will you make an oath that that's the truth? Will you confirm it with an oath that this is the truth? Will you sign this before before a representative of the court? Will you sign this before a notary republic and have a stamp on it and put the seal on it and this is exactly and and if there's anything in there that error it'll come back on you. And so you say this is precisely what happened. I was there and brother Brandham said you can't do that unless you were a witness and you had to be there and you had to hear it yourself and then you're a witness. &gt;&gt; Say I was a witness. This is exactly what happened. That car was driving. It went through a red light. I was standing there. This is what happened. And I struck this other vehicle, struck this man, struck this bicycle. Then you're a witness and you you can declare it and you make an oath. &gt;&gt; It's not just enough to say, "Well, I was there and and so on." Now a promise. So God he he willing abundantly willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise &gt;&gt; that he that that that his promise that his counsel his counsel is immutable. &gt;&gt; The immutability of his counsel he confirmed it with an oath. &gt;&gt; Amen. God willing, more abundantly to show unto the ears of promise, I speak now of Abraham's royal seed. &gt;&gt; If we don't believe in Abraham's royal seed, we have no business being here. &gt;&gt; We're just playing a game. &gt;&gt; We're just playing a game. All kinds of people have churches. All kinds of people have uh uh doctrines and all kinds of people have promises and beliefs and pie in the sky things and resurrections and whatever more. All kinds of them have it. Can you believe today that the scripture says the same Bible that you're standing here sitting there saying you believe says all whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world they shall worship the beast. &gt;&gt; They'll be under the control of the antichrist. That is anti-word. &gt;&gt; That really starts to slim things down. &gt;&gt; But that's the word of God. And that's also a promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's other promises. Promises that says that uh that Satan in his defeat will be cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; And there's great shouting and rejoicing that he's gone to his doom. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if God allows me to have a voice in that realm, I will certainly be heard. &gt;&gt; I'll be saying, "Glory to God. The tempter's gone. &gt;&gt; The evil one is gone. &gt;&gt; Never to be a trouble anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're here as Abraham's royal seed. &gt;&gt; Now, and God has provided a way. Listen, if this starts going over your head, don't worry about it. You'll think about it and you come back to it. He said, "You shall receive power." He's he's quoting the scripture now. You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then you shall be witnesses of me in Jerusalem and Judea. And this was happened to be in Victoria where he was preaching this. So he said, "And in Victoria, I was sitting on the platform." &gt;&gt; Yes. and to the uttermost part of the earth. He said, after 2,000 years of unbelieving and falling away and creeds and doctrines and dogmas being added to the church, they needed a sign to find out whether he still lived or not. &gt;&gt; Oh my, he said God had provided a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The proof of his resurrection, &gt;&gt; a sign that he had promised to Abraham. Abraham's royal seed. &gt;&gt; Hey, he's referring to a promise that was made to Abraham's royal seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was the same one he gave. He said he promised Abraham, he promised to Abraham's royal seed that the same sign that Abraham's seed seen, his royal seed would see the same sign. &gt;&gt; And we're living in the evening time. This has been declared in British Columbia in 1962. and the same sign. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I happened to sit on the platform and I saw him I saw uh the almighty God from the unseen realm take a human vessel in the visible realm. And he because the sign he gave to Abraham is that he turned his back and the tent was behind him and he spoke of Sarah and that I will I personal pronoun will certainly come to her according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a child. That was the sign. How did he know he was married? How did he know her name was Sarah? How did he know these things? It came from the unseen. It was wisdom from the unseen realm. And now we had a messenger on earth stand and put his back to the congregation and began to connect to the un invisible realm and turn right around say, "Isn't that so? Isn't that so?" I said, "Where did that come from? &gt;&gt; That's the unseen realm. and that's why you're here. &gt;&gt; That is your connection. &gt;&gt; If it's not, we might as well just go and worship at 7th Day Adventist or Baptist or any other place. They're all fine people &gt;&gt; and they all make wonderful promises. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He did. &gt;&gt; He said, "And he promised to Abraham's royal seed that the same sign that Abraham seen &gt;&gt; maybe several thousand years ago." &gt;&gt; And to think that that sign was brought right in front of the people. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I wish I could see it." You have it on tape &gt;&gt; and you can listen to it and you can hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over and over and over again. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that is proof &gt;&gt; of the connection to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus promised. Now, this was in the trial. Let notice where I'm going. In the trial, &gt;&gt; Jesus promised that as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Lot, &gt;&gt; it would be in the days in the last days. &gt;&gt; So what it was in Noah's time, what it was in Lot's time, it would be in the last days. He said, what happened to Abraham would return back again to Abraham's royal seed, which is which is Christ. Christ returning in the form of the word &gt;&gt; working in human beings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; back again, &gt;&gt; working in a human being &gt;&gt; and showing the sign that he promised it would. He said it would do. He promised that it would do it and God promised it and God will keep his promise. And God did it. &gt;&gt; God did it. &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. I saw it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's fine. &gt;&gt; You rejoice. Let this sink in deep. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now, it's like a class this morning. The immutability of his counsel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the immutability is a very interesting word. I've been wrestling with it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've been wrestling with it for many, many hours over the last couple days. The immutability in the Greek essentially it's not changing or not able to be changed. &gt;&gt; Okay. His counsel &gt;&gt; his word &gt;&gt; his promise or his his counsel can't be changed. &gt;&gt; But this is very very interesting and this is where you need to hang on to me. Hang on to what I'm saying for this moment. So it's unchangeable not to be transferred, not to be. It's fixed. &gt;&gt; It's unalterable. &gt;&gt; His counsel God more willing, abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise. If you're not heirs of the promise, you can forget it. But to show to the heirs, what does he want to show to the pro to the heirs of the promise? The immutability. My words will not change. &gt;&gt; Governments may change, nations may change, wars may happen, all kinds of things, turmoil may take place, but my counsel cannot change. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Lord. &gt;&gt; But that that word is a that word is a derivative from this and this is where the difficulty comes but I hope I will be able to make it clear to you. It's a derivative of a a second Greek word. And the second Greek word is to to translate, to carry over, to to remove, to change. This is where the difficulty is. It's immutable. It cannot be changed. It's unalterable. It's fixed. But it comes from this other Greek word which I won't even attempt to say it. But also to transpose and here here's the key. Two things one of which is put in the place of the other. Two things to transfer. He said the Greek says to transfer oneself or to suffer oneself to suffer or to allow oneself to be transferred in music. They may transpose. Is that the word? The lyrics are immutable. They shall not be changed from the author who received the inspiration. And here's the lyrics of the song. And the author perhaps sang it with their beautiful voice or whatever. But now down through the times, I don't think we sing Amazing Grace. Perhaps the way who was it that composed it, the way perhaps he sang it. But the lyrics are the same. This is immutable. &gt;&gt; If you change it, you haven't got the same song. &gt;&gt; But the lyrics are immutable. But you may transpose the music so another person can sing it. And so the other person it is as though they have been transferred. The person who now sings it may not be they may change the key they transpose it but the next person will pick it up and sing it but the lyrics remain exactly the same. Now, God's word is absolutely immutable. &gt;&gt; It's unalterable. &gt;&gt; It is fixed. &gt;&gt; But as time went on, &gt;&gt; God would raise up someone to define or to perhaps redefine exactly what the promise was saying. &gt;&gt; But in the end time, &gt;&gt; there was a promise &gt;&gt; made by Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see the days of Noah once again, &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Lot once again, even so shall it be when I, the son of man, shall be revealed, &gt;&gt; a different season, &gt;&gt; hundreds of years apart, &gt;&gt; but it's the same one &gt;&gt; that will transfer, [Applause] it had to be a prophet. prophet that could utter the words of God &gt;&gt; and that Christ himself could reveal himself through the vessel &gt;&gt; and thus the immutability of his will the promise remained absolutely irrevocably &gt;&gt; unalterable &gt;&gt; but the vessel &gt;&gt; that has been used &gt;&gt; to achieve the same thing that's right &gt;&gt; it's not a different word. &gt;&gt; It's not a different promise. &gt;&gt; It's the same promise, the same immutable word that now has been transposed. As it said, one suffers himself to be removed to another one to take the place of. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm just starting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That is why this vessel said &gt;&gt; and I heard him and you can hear it on tape &gt;&gt; and I have some quotes. &gt;&gt; That is my voice. &gt;&gt; But that is not me speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This is the other part of the immutability. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will transpose himself &gt;&gt; transfer &gt;&gt; move himself &gt;&gt; into another age into another generation to another people at the end time when the conditions are right and Lot's time is there and Noah's time now not localized in Palestine but throughout the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that is why the vessel would have to say that's me. &gt;&gt; That's my voice but it's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's your connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoever it was that was speaking &gt;&gt; that's the one who's called you. That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; That's why you believe what you believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that's what separates you from all others. &gt;&gt; And I pray that'll become a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Is true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; To transfer oneself &gt;&gt; or to suffer or allow oneself to be transferred. &gt;&gt; He allowed himself to be transferred. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Message believers. Listen close. Now in Revelation 10, won't turn to it, just listen to me in verse one, Revelation 10, the angel of the covenant, the mighty angel is descending, the prophet of God says clearly, it's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the verse two, he's holding a open book in his hand which had been closed in chapter five. &gt;&gt; Yes. In verse three, he cries with a loud voice. &gt;&gt; Hold this now, class. He cries with a loud voice as a lion roar. Because the lion is king. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he's coming into his kingship. And seven thunders uttered their voices. Seven thunders uttered their voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they thought it had thundered in John's gospel, when a voice spoke out &gt;&gt; confirming that I have glorified it and will glorify it again, &gt;&gt; it was it was a voice from the unseen &gt;&gt; speaking of Christ himself. And when he cried with a loud voice, this angel, this messenger, which was Christ, seven thunders uttered their voices because the book was sealed with seven seals. So there had to be seven voices, seven thunders. And they said that some said it thundered, but it was the voice of God speaking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I was about to write. John was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things and write them not." All right. &gt;&gt; And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, listen closely now, lifted up his hand &gt;&gt; to heaven and swear by him that liveth &gt;&gt; forever and ever. &gt;&gt; This is the same one that made the oath &gt;&gt; to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now he's coming to Abraham's children. &gt;&gt; That's right. And John is writing a prophetic word that this shall take place in the end time. Jesus said, "When you see the days of Noah and you see the days of Sodom again, that's the day I'll be revealed." Now, we have a prophet and he says, "Revelation 10, here he comes. It's him descending." &gt;&gt; Revelation 10, a mighty angel descending. He's got the book in his hand. It's now open. The seals have been open. And John is about to write its content. Said, "Don't write it. &gt;&gt; These thunders will be uttered." &gt;&gt; The truth of the word, seven of them &gt;&gt; said, "Seal it up until the end time." And this angel put one foot on the land and one on the sea, &gt;&gt; raised his hand, and swore by him that liveth forever and ever. &gt;&gt; That and this is what he this is what he what he put up. And there he said he'd swear by him that liveth forever and ever that there should be no longer &gt;&gt; time. That there should be time no longer. If you read the dagot of the Greek, you'll say no longer delay &gt;&gt; when this happens. There'll be no longer a delay &gt;&gt; for those things that the thunders have uttered, those voices of God. When that time comes, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You readers of the message and you we find new things all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I I made an incredible discovery. I thought Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries, well, that's the that that's the fundamental of this message. I wonder I wonder when brother Brandham I I wonder when he first referred to this covenant angel of Revelation 10:1. I wonder saw another mighty angel. So I put down another mighty angel descend first time. First time in the message, sir. &gt;&gt; Is this the time? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought, well, that can't be. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was in this end of 1962. He must have said that hundreds of times. So, I punched in Revelation 10:7. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; same message, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is this a sign of the end? &gt;&gt; Is this the time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the title of the message. Is this the time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the one that swore, he said, the time &gt;&gt; given &gt;&gt; shall be no longer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here's the prophet of God. Now, he enters into one of the one of the most astounding of his experiences in vision form. In vision form. Listen. You believe what he said? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He's in his room and his wife is knocking actually rattling the door to get his attention. Want just wanted to see if say something. He'd been caught up &gt;&gt; into a consolation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of seven angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And left him trembling. He said he's over in the corner and he has his Bible open. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it seemed to the last verse of Romans 9. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, how do you have a Bible open to one verse? That was the verse that he at this time in this particular instance &gt;&gt; was directed to. Behold, &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion &gt;&gt; a stumbling stone. &gt;&gt; That's right. rock of offense &gt;&gt; because God was announcing. I'm laying down my word. There will come a time. I'll lay it down. I'll confirm it again. I'll swear with an oath. &gt;&gt; The immutability of my will and my counsel, &gt;&gt; but I'll transpose myself and use a different vessel to say the same thing. [Music] Thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Is this a sign of the end, sir? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a short time later, he's in Arizona. Others are there as witnesses. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the great cloud picture which you are so accustomed to seeing happened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's literally caught into &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that constellation. Now you can say, well, you know what? I doubt that. I don't know about that. I wasn't there. I didn't see it. That's all fine. But do you know that from that time to the end of his life that same connection with the unseen remained absolutely intact? &gt;&gt; Do you know that pillar of fire remained in constant in constant attendance with that same messenger? &gt;&gt; And how would God who cannot lie? &gt;&gt; How could he come and confirm something that wasn't the truth? He cannot do that. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? No. In fact, as he was doing the opposite, he was confirming the immutability of his counsel. I cannot change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is what it said in the word. And here's the vessel I'm fulfilling it through. &gt;&gt; Have you been able to follow me thus far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just a few minutes. and he swear by him that liveth. And to swear is to affirm a promise with an oath. In swearing to call a person or a thing as a witness in the you have to follow me very close. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now in the trial in the message of trial in 1964 just within 12 months or so 15 months of this time &gt;&gt; he said we got so many witnesses we could call but if you'll excuse me I'd like to be his next witness. &gt;&gt; I'd like to put myself up for his witness. &gt;&gt; If you if I if if it don't sound too personal I'm his witness. I want to be his next his fifth witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know his position. He knew who he was. He knew what he was called to do. So he spoke the trial. And Satan as a as a pro as a prosecutor. And he says, "I'll be his witness." &gt;&gt; There was never anyone that had more substantial evidence that could be a witness. That's true. &gt;&gt; And then in the first seal, he said, "The entire mystery is unfolded." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the ministry of that angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be so simple, people. Just drop off the top of it. He said, "People won't understand it." In other words, but yet it'll be perfectly a vindicated everywhere. Just be perfectly normal. Everybody that wants to see it can see it. &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that together? Everybody who wants to see it can see it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; you might ask, I've had people say, "What sustains you, Brother Ed? What sustains you over the time you've gone through and the things that have been said? What sustains you? The unseen sustains me. &gt;&gt; The fact that I believe in a messenger that is connected to the unseen. &gt;&gt; I have a reverence for that word. I have a love for that word and may you may miss a whole lot of things in life. But if you love that word &gt;&gt; and sers is just the time &gt;&gt; just give a few more moments. &gt;&gt; He said in the 10th chapter of the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ I wish to read a few verses. The first seven verses 1 to7 first time &gt;&gt; he did it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the message he's asking the congregation he says and I am going almost like presumptuous myself he said because of the strange event that is taking place he said but sers is this the time &gt;&gt; is this the time for this to happen &gt;&gt; is this the time for revelation 10 to happen is this what's happened is this what these angels that have come from heaven and they took a picture it's in the life magazine it says the encyclopedia. &gt;&gt; I've had uh &gt;&gt; critics come and say to me, "That cloud, that cloud was in the heavens." It was 30 miles high. I believe it was 27 miles across. And this man actually came and fellowshipped with us in the early days. He was an engineer of some kind. Had to do things very, very specifically. and he got questioning the cloud and he said uh he came back to me and he has a whole book on it. He said they they there was a missile destroyed uh from Edwards Air Force Base in California and the winds that re that that were pre prevalent that day would have put the debris at that approximate location at that time. I said, "Uh, okay." I said, "The scripture says Elijah, Elisha, Elijah said to his servant, "Go out and tell me what you see." &gt;&gt; He said, "I see a little cloud rising from the ground." &gt;&gt; What else is the shape of a man's hand? I said to this critic, I said, "What what what was that cloud? Was it mist? What formed the cloud? &gt;&gt; You don't know. &gt;&gt; He was totally silent. I said, I'm not interested what formed the cloud. I'm interested in what the cloud represented. &gt;&gt; And what Elijah needed to hear, it's the shape of a man's hand. &gt;&gt; He didn't say where did it come from. Did it come off the water? Did it come from the dew? Did it come that was irre irrelevant. It was what was relevant is the right people were there looking at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm telling you what was relevant is that God's messenger never won was like this &gt;&gt; since Jesus Christ out in the desert in the wilderness and here's the cloud. I don't care what made it. &gt;&gt; But when you look at it and I saw it for the first time when it was turned and he said, "Have you seen this?" And he turned it. He said, "Now what do you see?" Both my wife and I sitting there. We saw the head of Jesus Christ, the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And it's Jesus Christ that was descending in Revelation 10:1. And e even in the vision now in the vision in his room, he comes out in December, end of December, end of December 1962. He says, "Uh, it is so strange. I I don't know what it is. Perhaps it's the end of my life. It's a great explosion. And and angels, he said, they came. I I looked into eternity &gt;&gt; and they came like little dots in just a splash &gt;&gt; and a moment of time. &gt;&gt; Said, he said, I didn't have time to count. He said, it was not less than five and not more than seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; He said, I was caught up into it &gt;&gt; and I was left in the vision. And I was left in the corner. I was in the corner of the room with my Bible open. It seemed to be ro He's speaking this just after it happened. It seemed it was Romans the 9th chapter, the last verse. Behold, I lay in Zion &gt;&gt; a stone. &gt;&gt; That's what God was doing. &gt;&gt; He was laying in Zion a a stone. &gt;&gt; The word once again, &gt;&gt; you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And about two months later in Arizona, here it happens. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He said, "They took the picture. We didn't take it." &gt;&gt; How about when the Pillar of Fire, you know, Brother John has thrown up this on the screen many times. Uh, Brother Brandham in Houston, Texas, and the Sam Houston uh arena when the and brother Brandon wasn't even on the platform. They were going to have a debate. and FF Bossworth took the debate and the debate was over in just a few moments because Reverend Best, a Baptist minister, had his had his group and had his photographer there from Douglas Studios to take a picture. He said, "I want you to take the picture when I have my finger at William Brandon's nose declaring him to be a false prophet." Brother Brandham said, "I don't want any arguing over the word." FF Bosworth said, "There'll be no arguing." And FF Bosworth, he said to Reverend Best, you you can be the first speaker. Each one was going to take, I think, 20 minutes or whatever, and then the next one would have opportunity to respond. But if if if he took first, then he wouldn't have the last place to respond. So he said to FF Bosworth, you speak first. So it was on divine healing. And FF Bosworth, a great stately man, godly man of the word. And he said, "I would like to ask our honored guest just one question, and I would like him to answer that question just yes or no." This is the question. Do all the redemptive names of Jehovah of the Old Testament refer to Jesus in the New? and he saw himself trapped because if he said no, it would mean that Jesus was not savior. If he said yes, it would mean he's also healer. &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't answer that." He said, "Br bring on that bring on that divine healer." No, the panel said, "Answer the question." &gt;&gt; So, make a long story short, it was over in a few minutes. And they handed the they handed the debate to brother Bosworth. And brother Bosworth see you've seen the picture so many many times but brother Bosworth said I don't know if brother Brandham came to the meeting of the thousands of people in the arena. And brother Brandham told me himself this account. He said, "I was up high in the in the not in the balconies, but in the U stadium in the bleachers and he said, I was uh just sitting there and he said, I just felt something urging me, you should go down." So he went down. He has that little piece of paper in his hand about this size right here. And you could take and look at that picture when you leave here. go and get it because I want to remind you about something. And so he's standing there with this little piece of paper and he said, "I I have never uh claimed to be a divine healer." He said, "But I do believe in in divine healing." He said, ' And I'm sure that our our good friend, Reverend Best, would not want to be called a divine savior, but he certainly believes in salvation. And he said, "It is true that uh visitation, an angel from God has visited me and ministered this gift to me." And he just stopped and said, "Just a moment. The one of whom I speak is here." And it came right down. That pillar of fire came right down one of the aisles of that great auditorium. And some saw it and some did not. Brother Brandham said, "Women screamed and some fainted and others didn't see a thing. and it came right up and hung over his head. And when you look at the picture, I've said this many times, I'm saying it to you again. When you look at the picture, one thing that's very outstanding is that the profile of brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; the piece of paper he's holding in his hand is just crisp &gt;&gt; and clear with its in its definition of of of the edges. But the pillar of fire because brother Brandham said it's always moving. &gt;&gt; It's whirling pillar of fire over his head and it's blurred. And when they took the of all the pictures that were taken by Douglas Studios cameraman took it to Douglas Studios. They had the gathering and Reverend Best was there. FF Bosworth was there. Brother Brandham was there. They called them because he he had the film was was was developed and of all the pictures only one picture &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; developed and it was that one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says God would not share &gt;&gt; himself with another. &gt;&gt; And uh and when they came out after examination of it they said who's William Brham? Brother Bam said, "I am, sir." He said, "I want to present you with the first known picture of a supernatural being." And he said, "Well, I I'm sorry, but he said, it's not it it's not my picture. It was taken by this man from Douglas Studios." He said, "If I may, I would like to make one request that is never sold that it's never sold for a profit. If people would like to have one, then that it would be available to them." That picture is in Washington DC. One of our brothers went to Washington and it is there in the archives in Washington DC. It is the only known photograph of a supernatural being. Why am I saying all this? While we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, if these were even my last words, as believers, we have a connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the unseen, &gt;&gt; with the invisible, &gt;&gt; and it should give you great confidence and also great thanksgiving should well up in our hearts that God brought you to that place where you could have that realization. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I would like to sing if we could. There is an unseen hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you would stand, I'd like to have prayer first. Father, this has been a different service, a different service for me and perhaps a different service for many of the people that are here. But I felt it was a critical service. I felt it was very very important. It was essential that there is a confirmation that these children of the royal seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; would know that you were not ashamed &gt;&gt; to come before the heirs of the promise &gt;&gt; and show yourself immutable in your counsel. And yet then you could take one born again, &gt;&gt; one that was forgiven the same as all others need to be forgiven and take and use him and transpose yourself, oh God, &gt;&gt; in such a way so that you have a vessel in our time, speaking openly over the years and decades, thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Irrefutable proofs &gt;&gt; over and over. again. Father, we're so thankful. We're so thankful. I want to stand before this congregation today and say thank you, Lord, on my own behalf. Thank you that you called. Thank you that we've seen what we've seen, Lord. And we're not looking at the things which are visible, temporal, passing away, perishing, but we're looking to the eternal. &gt;&gt; For the people that are here today, Lord, how I thank you for them. for their prayers, for their strength, for their encouragement. Thank you for their presence here today. And I pray, oh God, that you'll bless them for their sacrifice. I'm asking even now that you'll take brother Dioa in your hand. Cause him to utter things that are not even in his mind. Cause him to speak what you'd have him to speak to the people tonight, Father. And as everyone gathers, I pray that it will be a Holy Ghost time. May it be a Holy Ghost moment. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; For surely we will not ask is this the time &gt;&gt; for the sign of the end. We will say it is the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the time. &gt;&gt; It is the time. &gt;&gt; It is taking place &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves in that moment in Jesus Christ's name. Bless the people I pray. &gt;&gt; Bless the visitors, oh God. May your grace be upon us all &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we sing, I want to say to you as a friend, as a father, as a pastor, I want to say to you, we are indescribably privileged people. And what you say, you say, well, we have the the next time you hear that, you know, the message this and the message that and the message something else, please remember this one thing. God has permitted you to actually see. Let's not talk about the tech age of technology or the other age of entertainment. You've actually seen the age. You've seen the immutability. You've seen the visible immutability of Almighty God. You have had an opportunity to view. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The swearing of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; That I change not. &gt;&gt; No wonder he preached the same thing. Same thing. &gt;&gt; God cannot change. &gt;&gt; You have seen that, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not just seeing some doctrine or seeing some, you know, another group of people. That's not what we're here for. That's not what we're seeing. We're connected to a invisible unseen realm. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope it's not too strong for you. [Music] Have a good look at me. I stood beside this vessel. I stood beside this prophet vessel when a horse was trying to kill a man, my friend, brother Bud Southwick, and struck him on the chest with both front hooves. And I said, "Brother Brother," I said, "That horse is going to kill brother Bud." Yeah. He said, "He is mean, isn't he?" [Music] And that horse had bucked and had ruined gear and had broken saddles and done all kinds of damage already the day before. Now he was actually after brother Southwick and I saw brother Southwick. I saw the horse start to tremble in his flanks in his his whole flank start to tremble. I know a horse will do that when he's filled with fear. And and brother Bud is saddling him and getting all the pack on him and getting the tarp. And when you when you have a horse like that, if you get the tarp and throw the tarp over, he goes crazy. And he gets a tarp on and he starts to cinch him up. I thought he he's got him. He's saddling him up. I I I turn I said, "Oh." Brother Brandham just had his head turned, had his hat off, and turned around, slid his hat back on his head. Do you see me? That horse become a kitten. That horse become the most timid animal that you could imagine. From that moment, he was like an old pet that never gave a moment's problem from that moment forward. Listen, folks, who is that? &gt;&gt; What is that? That's not a man. That's not a man from Jeffersonville. Indeed, it is. It's William Brandham. But that's not what's in him. &gt;&gt; It's the one who can control the animals. It is. It is the restoration of Eden once again to take control of all things. &gt;&gt; You see me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I sat 4 days in a storm. I had that same man walk up to me and say, "This is on account of me and it's all over." &gt;&gt; And we will ride out of here dry. Four days of drenching rain in the mountains. We'll ride out of here dry. I I I I was stunned. I didn't I couldn't even say anything. You say, "Were you believing? You're disbelieving? You don't have any chance to say anything." Do you see me? 20 minutes. 20 minutes from that time. I was sitting there and a poof, a little puff of wind went by. I thought, "My that was warm. That was unusually warm." And then they start to blow a little bit like this. Within 20 minutes, there's a big blue hole in the sky. And before we before my horse took its first step, I was peeling off my my jacket into my shirt sleeves and rode for eight hours bone dry. &gt;&gt; Who is that? &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; That's the same one. &gt;&gt; Transposed into another vessel. I hope you understand this so you could misunderstand it. If you do, forgive me, &gt;&gt; it's a man &gt;&gt; saved by grace, &gt;&gt; adopted son of God, &gt;&gt; like you and I. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But that power that was in him was the same one who spoke to the storm 2,000 years ago and said, "Peace be still." &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that, come and tell me what it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come and tell me what it was. &gt;&gt; And the same one who took the words and said, "My words will never pass away." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the one who came and swore in this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The immutability. &gt;&gt; These things are true. And now I confirm it to Abraham's children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Royal seed. God bless you. Royalty of Abraham, God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'll need you to sing it, brother. Got a mic. There is an unseen hand. There is an seed to me. in ways I cannot see while going through this world [Music] and see [Music] me now.

[Music] I don't get a chance to shake hands with all of you here who meet on that on that shore. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. &gt;&gt; It's come pretty clear. You talk about it really being defined. &gt;&gt; The same messenger &gt;&gt; saw millions &gt;&gt; and said, "I saw you over there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bit my finger. He said, &gt;&gt; squeezed my hand. Had all my hair back. Ah, that's where we want to go. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Darren, do you want to just come and dismiss us &gt;&gt; in prayer? &gt;&gt; And we'll see you tonight, Lord willing, 5:00 out at the camp. I trust you can all be there. We're going to have a glorious time. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we are indeed a privileged people. We are a blessed people. And Lord God, we show our appreciation by saying thank you by worshiping you, by laying down our lies, by casting aside our own reasonings, our own understandings, Father. And we say, Lord, just fill us, just feed us, Lord. All we want is your word. Take this whole world, but give us Jesus Christ. Give us that revealed word, dear Lord, that that same life that was manifested in the prophet would be manifested in us, Lord. was at first fruits. Lord, we're the harvest, Father. We're part of your children. We're Abraham's children. Children of the promise, dear God. And we've heard about the promise this morning. We heard about our our new home, dear Lord. We heard about the promises you have in store for us, Lord. And they are within reach, Father. They're closer than they've ever been before, Lord. So it behooves us, dear God, to stretch forth, to reach forth for those promises, dear God, to claim them, to walk in them, Lord, to meditate upon them, Father, that that word, dear God, would manifest itself in our lives. That our theophanes would just be manifested around us, dear God. And one day, Lord, we'll be caught away. One day, dear God, that promise will be manifested. That there will be a catching away, dear God, that will be changed. will be transformed in the atoms, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, that's the next greatest thing that we're looking for, dear Lord, is a change of these bodies, &gt;&gt; Lord, where we can truly have that rest. We can live in peace, Lord, with the saints on high, &gt;&gt; Lord. But while it is still called this day, dear God, while we are still in the battle, Lord, just give us the strength to keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Give our pastor strength, Lord. We so appreciate the man of God. We appreciate the gift that you've given him, Lord. That gift is for us. That gift is to bless us. That gift is to strengthen us. To give us eyesab, dear God, to look to the unseen, Lord, to get our eyes off our natural existence, Lord, to get our eyes off of our problems, off our situations, off our trials. And dear God, while we look to these things, dear God, these things will work for us, dear God. These things will perfect us, Lord. We thank you for your word. We ask, dear God, that you would go with us, Lord. And we pray that you'll give us traveling mercies as we'd head down to the camp. We pray your blessings upon brother Doka, Lord, as he's prepared his heart. We just expect, Lord God, there just be a continuation of your presence, a continuation of worship, of giving of thanks to you, Father, from the depths of our souls. So go with your children now. I pray, Father, bless each one as we go our way now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you, Father. So, you're dismissed in Jesus name. I'd like to just say to the deacons, perhaps you can take the offering baskets, if you would, to the to the camp. We don't have any other way. We'd like to receive an offering tonight. And so, God bless you. You're dismissed. Have a nice afternoon. And after the service tonight, they're going to have a little snack or something in the uh in the uh dining hall. And so uh you can expect that also. Won't send you home too hungry. God bless you. You're dismissed. God bless you, brother John. [Music] [Music]
