[0:04] That is the same God
[0:07] who's living in me.
[0:14] The same God
[0:16] who spoke to
[0:19] the woman at the well
[0:23] is the same God
[0:25] who wonders
[0:28] are too many to tell.
[0:32] The same God
[0:34] who parted
[0:37] the raing
[0:39] red sea.
[0:43] He's the same God
[0:46] who's living in me.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that tonight? And
[0:53] God bless you, saints. Certainly had a
[0:56] wonderful, wonderful time this weekend
[0:57] so far, haven't we? Amen. You ready for
[0:59] another one? Amen. God's got more for
[1:01] us. And we're not going to delay the
[1:03] service. We're going to have a special.
[1:05] Maybe Sister Linda, Marilyn, Joanne,
[1:06] maybe just after we pray, you could be
[1:08] ready to sing for us tonight. Uh, but I
[1:10] wanted to sing with you number 13:10.
[1:12] There's no one like our God. I was
[1:14] thinking about the service tonight.
[1:15] Those words kept going through my mind.
[1:17] When I walk through the fire, I know
[1:19] he's beside me and I pass through the
[1:21] waters. I will not fear. What a mighty
[1:23] God we serve, saints. Amen. Let's sing
[1:26] this together and we'll just prepare our
[1:28] hearts to receive the word once again.
[1:32] Ooh, he stretches the heavens
[1:37] like curtains before him. He forms every
[1:42] star and he calls them by name.
[1:47] He does not grow weary.
[1:51] His strength knows no way.
[1:54] The greatness of our God. None can
[1:59] comprehend.
[2:02] Who is like him? is my unto our
[2:09] God. God
[2:12] is my unto our God. There's no one
[2:17] before him. There's no one beside him.
[2:22] For there is no
[2:27] one like him.
[2:30] There is no power or grace. No one
[2:35] worthy of praise like our God.
[2:42] Our God. His voice is like thunder.
[2:47] His word is forever.
[2:50] His love is unfailing
[2:54] and flows like a river.
[2:58] Worthy of glory and honor and power and
[3:04] praise is our God.
[3:09] Oh, there is no one like our God.
[3:15] No, there is no one like our God. I walk
[3:20] through the fire.
[3:24] Oh, I walk through the fire
[3:28] and he is beside me. I pass through the
[3:33] water
[3:34] and I
[3:38] for the Lord is my keeper, my strength
[3:42] and my soul.
[3:45] He's mighty.
[3:49] I for
[3:55] my
[4:13] beside
[4:16] Heat. Heat.
[4:26] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[4:36] Yeah.
[4:40] Heat.
[4:55] Heat. Heat.
[5:05] Heat.
[5:17] Heat.
[5:26] Heat. Heat.
[5:43] Heat. Heat.
[5:55] creation.
[5:57] There is no
[6:00] like
[6:07] you
[6:09] to my
[6:12] God.
[6:15] Who is my God to my God?
[6:21] Who is I to
[6:36] be
[6:38] Heat. Heat.
[6:48] Yeah.
[6:51] Heat.
[7:01] Heat. Heat.
[7:11] and forever
[7:15] worthy of glory and honor and power and
[7:21] praise is our
[7:28] God.
[7:32] Oh, there is no one like God.
[7:39] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, can we just lift our
[7:42] voices, saints, and give him
[7:44] thanksgiving for what he's done for us.
[7:46] If he did something for you this
[7:48] morning, just thank him, saints. It's a
[7:49] finished work. Oh, let his praises be on
[7:52] our lips this evening. Lord, you are
[7:55] worthy, Father. God, we thank you, Lord
[7:57] Jesus, for redemption, oh God, for the
[7:59] blood that washes us clean so we can
[8:01] come before you and give you praise this
[8:03] evening and know that our praise will be
[8:05] an accepted sacrifice, Lord. Blessed be
[8:08] your name, Lord Jesus. We honor you this
[8:10] evening, Father. Glory and honor and
[8:14] power. Praise be to your name, Lord.
[8:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[8:18] Wonderful Lord Jesus. Amen.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask for brother Tim Dodd
[8:23] would just come open the service for us
[8:24] in a word of prayer this evening. Isn't
[8:27] he lovely? Amen. We don't have any
[8:29] written prayer requests, but if there's
[8:31] a need on your heart, we know that he
[8:33] sees every unspoken prayer request,
[8:35] Brother Tim, would you come, please?
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[8:44] Wonderful heavenly father.
[8:47] Lord, after a service like this morning,
[8:50] there ought not to be any prayer
[8:51] requests. There ought to just be
[8:54] testimonies
[8:55] &gt;&gt; and rejoicing
[8:57] and glory and honor to the name of Jesus
[9:00] Christ. That name above every name. And
[9:04] we bow in your presence this evening, oh
[9:06] God. Lord, every time you come into the
[9:10] meetings, every time you use a minister,
[9:13] Lord, every time you come to our
[9:15] personal address, Lord, it's so special
[9:18] to us. And Lord, we so love you so much
[9:21] and so thank you. We are a blessed
[9:23] people, Father. We thank you. We give
[9:27] you glory. We give you honor, Lord. And
[9:30] we just want to commit this service
[9:32] aresh tonight into your hands. words
[9:35] cannot express the feelings that are on
[9:38] our hearts. In reverence and humility,
[9:41] we approach you once again, realizing,
[9:44] Lord, that we are weak human beings.
[9:48] We're as long as we're in these mortal
[9:50] bodies, we'll have needs from day to
[9:53] day, battles and struggles and wrestles
[9:56] against the enemy. Lord, that's just the
[9:59] facts of life that are here. But Lord,
[10:02] one day this body will be changed. One
[10:06] day will be the last battle. One day
[10:08] will be the last struggle. But while we
[10:11] have battles here, Father, we say, Lord,
[10:14] give us the victory. You are the mighty
[10:17] conqueror. And we claim every redemptive
[10:20] blessing. We claim every benefit. We
[10:23] claim your blessing upon the service
[10:25] this evening. May you anoint brother Ron
[10:27] Spencer once again, Lord. Speak to us
[10:30] through him, Lord, as only you can.
[10:33] Direct your servant the way you would
[10:35] have your word to go. Flow your love
[10:38] through this meeting and touch our
[10:40] hearts. We pray.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; We thank you for every need that was met
[10:43] this morning. And may more needs be met
[10:47] this evening. We commit this service now
[10:49] to you in the wonderful name of our Lord
[10:52] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God bless you. As you have
[10:59] your seats, we'll just have the biscll
[11:01] sisters come at this time and and sing
[11:04] for us. We did have a note that we
[11:05] wanted to welcome a sister here. I
[11:07] believe it's sister, is it Natushi who's
[11:09] moved here from Edmonton? Why don't you
[11:11] stand for us? She's coming to sojourn
[11:13] with us. God bless you. Welcome.
[11:15] Make her feel welcome. Introduce
[11:17] yourself.
[11:18] Amen. God bless you. We're happy to have
[11:20] you here with us. Amen. We'll just have
[11:23] the sisters sing for us and then we'll
[11:24] welcome our brother Ron to the pulpit at
[11:26] that time. Amen.
[11:44] We sing songs about looking back
[11:48] and all that God has done.
[11:53] We sing songs about tomorrow,
[11:56] the victories to be won.
[12:00] And we sing songs about our future home
[12:04] and where we'll dwell.
[12:08] But what about the here and now?
[12:14] What about peace?
[12:18] What about joy?
[12:22] and his faithful love that holds us
[12:26] through the storm.
[12:29] What about truth?
[12:32] And what about the fire
[12:36] that's still burning after all these
[12:41] years?
[12:45] I don't know about you, my friend,
[12:49] but I'm not looking back.
[12:53] It is enough to know he's here and
[12:56] keeping me on track.
[13:00] And if today I have questions or a
[13:04] sinking heart,
[13:07] I trust his plan. It's been perfect from
[13:10] the start.
[13:13] So what about peace?
[13:16] And what about our joy
[13:20] and his faithful love that holds us
[13:24] through the storm?
[13:27] What about the truth?
[13:30] And what about the fire
[13:34] that's still burning after all these
[13:39] years?
[13:41] Each day he holds me
[13:45] and he comforts me.
[13:48] He's a strong and mighty tower I run
[13:53] into.
[13:55] Never failing,
[13:59] never changing.
[14:04] I will trust him with my heart
[14:10] for he is peace
[14:14] and he's our joy
[14:18] and it's his faithful love that holds us
[14:22] through the storm.
[14:25] And he is truth.
[14:28] And he's the fire
[14:32] that's still burning after all these
[14:37] years.
[14:39] And he's true.
[14:43] And he's the fire
[14:47] that's still burning
[14:50] after all these
[14:54] years.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Linda just wrote that song.
[15:08] Isn't that beautiful?
[15:10] &gt;&gt; So so wonderful. Well, I know you've
[15:13] been enjoying the word, been enjoying
[15:16] the ministry of Brother Ron Spencer. I
[15:18] know you have. How many believe that God
[15:20] has met them in a supernatural way?
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Can I maybe have a maybe show of hands
[15:25] and just say God God's moved in a
[15:28] supernatural way? We want the devil to
[15:30] let him know that God's done something
[15:32] in our lives. And we're going in this
[15:34] new year different people. We know who
[15:37] we are and what we believe. And we're
[15:40] thankful for God called men gifts to the
[15:43] body. For I give unto you into the
[15:45] church apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[15:48] pastors, teachers, and each one in
[15:51] particular have a certain ting, have a
[15:53] certain way, have a certain approach.
[15:56] And so often you sit there and you
[15:58] marvel at the Holy Spirit discerning the
[16:02] needs within the body. And it's almost
[16:04] like who how did he how was he in my
[16:07] home to know that. So we know it's not
[16:11] man. We know it was the Holy Spirit. And
[16:13] we want to give the Holy Spirit, the
[16:15] Lord Jesus the credit. Brother Ron
[16:18] Spencer has been a part of my life. I
[16:20] know it's been a part of brother Bisl's
[16:22] life m much longer. But in 205 was the
[16:25] first time brother Ron Spencer pastored
[16:28] in Alton uh Virginia at I believe it's
[16:32] Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle. And
[16:34] he's been um instrumental in in in many
[16:38] of our lives. And that's why we love him
[16:40] dearly. And to have sister uh Connie
[16:43] Spencer here with us, that's the extra
[16:45] bonus. God bless you, Sister Connie. We
[16:47] love you. We love your family. We love
[16:49] the assembly and what they've meant to
[16:51] us and the gospel. And so we are wanting
[16:55] Brother Spencer to just have his free
[16:58] liberty tonight. However the Lord moves,
[17:00] we're just going to squeeze that last
[17:02] bit out of him. We just about just had
[17:05] to carry him to his room. He said, "I
[17:07] I'm worn out." I said, "You're not
[17:10] finished.
[17:11] There's one more service and I've got
[17:14] some texts and emails already from the
[17:17] we have another assembly outside of this
[17:20] church that might be even larger than
[17:22] what you see here in this room. And they
[17:24] look here and they listen to the our
[17:26] services and they've so enjoyed this
[17:30] ministry this weekend. And we want to we
[17:33] want to acknowledge those that are
[17:36] hooked up on the internet whether it be
[17:38] by the phone hookup. they have been
[17:40] given to this uh church. They they give
[17:42] of their uh wealth. They give of their
[17:44] substance to see this ministry go forth.
[17:48] And that's one thing we failed maybe to
[17:49] mention this morning. I think as a
[17:51] church, we'd love to give an offering
[17:53] for the servant of God. And I know we're
[17:56] schooled well. We've been taught well.
[17:58] Uh tonight we can just as we go out put
[18:01] an offering into the box in the back and
[18:04] say to the servant of God, Brother Ron
[18:06] Spencer, thank God that he has given his
[18:10] life for this gospel and he's affected
[18:12] my life. I think we can do that. We'd
[18:15] love to do that. And that's a part of
[18:17] worship. So let's just stand as we
[18:19] welcome the man of God to come to the
[18:21] pulpit. Let's just sing that little
[18:23] chorus. I place you in the highest
[18:25] place.
[18:28] I place you
[18:32] in the highest place.
[18:38] For you
[18:41] are the great high.
[18:46] We praise you.
[18:50] Oh my goship.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it to him in worship one
[19:16] more time as we welcome brother Spencer.
[19:21] We
[19:25] in the highest
[19:31] you
[19:39] praise
[19:43] I am
[19:52] all
[19:55] and we come to you
[20:00] to worship
[20:03] at your feet.
[20:11] God bless you.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; You're good as your word. You said you
[20:16] were going to squeeze me and
[20:18] &gt;&gt; that's what you did.
[20:21] Amen. So good to see you this evening
[20:24] and I was kind of expecting a much
[20:27] smaller crowd, but
[20:31] less of you would squeeze me less. And
[20:33] so, Amen. I trust you've enjoyed the the
[20:38] week end and and we just we certainly
[20:42] love you with all of our hearts. We're
[20:43] one of those that tunes in to your
[20:45] services and I I certainly enjoy it and
[20:50] and uh we thank you for that opportunity
[20:52] to do that and and uh we're a great big
[20:56] bride around the world.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And whether it's a church of five
[21:01] people or two people or 10,000 people,
[21:04] we're a we're a lovely group of people
[21:07] and we love you and we will spend
[21:10] eternity together.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Might look a little bit different
[21:14] there, but uh we're going to spend
[21:16] eternity together. And
[21:18] &gt;&gt; I'm certainly thrilled that my wife has
[21:20] been able to be with me on this trip.
[21:22] And
[21:23] &gt;&gt; it was literally the the day before
[21:26] flying. We I I just my children said,
[21:30] "You need to go with dad." And I had
[21:32] planned to go come by myself. And she
[21:37] called United and she got one of an
[21:40] incredible agent and they put her beside
[21:44] of me. You talk about impossibilities.
[21:47] They put her beside of me in the whole
[21:49] trip. And so I'm glad that I think
[21:52] there's going to be another trip, Sister
[21:54] Connie, you're going to be beside of me
[21:55] on.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; That's for eternity. And so
[21:58] &gt;&gt; we thank the Lord for that.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I certainly enjoyed this morning.
[22:04] And I if I took liberties that you think
[22:07] I shouldn't have taken, I'm just glad
[22:09] you're not the boss.
[22:11] Amen. So we certainly love you with all
[22:14] of our hearts. I certainly enjoyed uh
[22:17] your New Year's service and the
[22:20] testimony and we so thank the for each
[22:24] words that was said there and Amen.
[22:27] Amen. I'm just trying to catch my
[22:29] breath. That's all I'm doing. Amen. God
[22:32] bless you. Amen. Are you come expecting
[22:35] tonight?
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to us?
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] In our Christian walk, sometimes we go
[22:43] through some real battles. Mhm.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; And we have some real difficult times.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you watch a minister walk
[22:50] to the pull pit and you think, well,
[22:52] it's just another sermon. And you don't
[22:54] realize really what's going on in the
[22:56] background. And I've came to these
[22:58] meetings with courage on my heart and I
[23:01] want to finish it with that.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to just stand here tonight
[23:05] and give the devil a real black eye.
[23:08] And uh and I got a feeling I've got a
[23:11] lot of friends in this congregation
[23:13] that's ready
[23:14] &gt;&gt; to go to battle as well. So So here's
[23:17] what I want to ask you. I want you to
[23:18] help me tonight.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; You help me really nicely this morning.
[23:22] Sometimes after dinner, you kind of get
[23:24] weary and tired, but I want you to help
[23:26] me tonight. And
[23:29] I want you to pull.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to charge.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I want to speak
[23:38] this evening on take it back.
[23:44] Amen.
[23:46] For two months I knew this is where we
[23:47] were going to end up. And so here we
[23:49] are.
[23:52] 1st Samuel chapter 30 and verse 1.
[24:07] Amen.
[24:09] Love to hear those leaves flipping.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] God bless you.
[24:17] Before we read it, I I want to just ask
[24:19] you, you have a need tonight and you've
[24:22] come with expectation.
[24:25] I want I want you to just take it before
[24:28] the Lord right now and take it to your
[24:30] heart.
[24:31] I said, "God, this is my night. This is
[24:34] my night.
[24:36] May this service change my life."
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[24:51] this has been a very supernatural day,
[24:55] Lord. And you can we sense your presence
[24:58] very near and aware of you here.
[25:02] Lord, I'm honored to stand here one more
[25:04] time.
[25:06] I pray that you would anoint my lips and
[25:08] anoint the thoughts, the weariness of my
[25:12] own being. I pray that you would
[25:14] strengthen me just now.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you bless this congregation.
[25:20] May you just supernaturally come among
[25:22] us in a very mighty way.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:27] Now Lord,
[25:29] for some of us, we have came like the
[25:31] woman that was going to a meeting
[25:35] and she left with a revelation in his
[25:37] heart, in her heart. If I can touch the
[25:40] hem of his garment, I don't need a
[25:42] private interview. I don't even need him
[25:44] to speak to me.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; But if I can touch your touch,
[25:50] &gt;&gt; I'll walk away different.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:54] That's true,
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Lord. That little girl that just stepped
[25:57] out from the shadows of of people and
[26:00] kissed the prophet's pocket.
[26:04] We don't know her name. We don't know a
[26:07] whole lot, but she would find herself in
[26:09] a prayer line.
[26:12] And you would remember her.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Georgia Carter laid in that bed for
[26:18] years,
[26:19] &gt;&gt; years,
[26:20] &gt;&gt; years.
[26:22] and reading that book of revelation come
[26:24] in her heart.
[26:27] It's my promise.
[26:30] Oh God, may we tonight
[26:33] &gt;&gt; grab a hold of the lapels of the prophet
[26:36] of God. That little girl in Memphis
[26:40] grabbed the lapels of the prophet and
[26:42] refused to turn loose.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; So Lord, I make an announcement tonight.
[26:46] Father,
[26:48] &gt;&gt; like Jacob did that angel, I'm not
[26:51] turning you loose
[26:53] &gt;&gt; till you've blessed me.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we come with expectation and
[27:01] even desperation in our hearts.
[27:05] God, may you come and may you do a work
[27:09] this evening
[27:11] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] Amen. And amen. And amen. Amen.
[27:24] And it came to pass when David and his
[27:26] men were come to Ziglag
[27:30] on the third day
[27:32] that the Amalocites had invaded the
[27:35] south and Ziglag
[27:38] and smitten Ziglag and burned it with
[27:41] fire
[27:43] and had taken the women captives that
[27:46] were therein. They slew not any, neither
[27:50] great or small, but carried them away,
[27:54] and went on their way. So David and his
[27:58] men came to the city, and behold, it was
[28:01] burned with fire, and their wives and
[28:04] their sons and their daughters were
[28:07] taken captives.
[28:09] And David and the people that were with
[28:13] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[28:16] there was no more power to weep.
[28:20] And David's two wives were taken away.
[28:23] Ahim the Jezeritis and Abigail the wife
[28:27] of Nabal the Carmelite.
[28:32] And David was greatly distressed.
[28:35] For the people spake of stoning him
[28:39] because of the soul of all of the people
[28:42] was grieved. Every man for his sons and
[28:46] his daughters.
[28:48] I want to really hone in on these next
[28:50] words. But David encouraged himself
[28:55] &gt;&gt; in the Lord his God.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[29:06] Hallelujah.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; This is quite a scene.
[29:19] David had been away at battle.
[29:24] David had had some incredible victories
[29:27] to which that all of us could dance and
[29:30] shout to.
[29:33] David had a faithful group of people
[29:35] that was around him. These people were
[29:38] watching him as he was ascending to the
[29:40] throne and doing great things. And he
[29:43] was a great king and he had great men
[29:47] around him that were very close to him
[29:49] and intertwined with his life.
[29:53] And and now they had built houses around
[29:56] him and their homes had been inhabited
[29:58] and and they each one kind of had their
[30:01] own environment, but they would leave
[30:03] from that place and go away to war and
[30:06] fight the war because God was with them.
[30:09] They would fight the war and they would
[30:10] come back and they would fight the war
[30:12] and they would come back and they would
[30:14] fight the war.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we all fight different kinds
[30:17] of enemies. Yeah.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; The enemy will keep throwing different
[30:22] baits at you to see if you'll actually
[30:24] go after one of them. And he'll fight
[30:26] you in different angles. And our prophet
[30:28] taught us as ministers, he kind of put
[30:30] us out front. He said, "As ministers,
[30:32] we'll fight popularity, the love of
[30:35] money, or or women or they'll throw
[30:37] different baits. If one won't work,
[30:39] he'll throw another bait. If one won't
[30:40] work, he'll throw another bait." We have
[30:42] an enemy that is constantly at us and
[30:44] he's constantly trying to get us and
[30:46] he's not respectful of even who we are
[30:48] and he's constantly bombarding us and
[30:51] doing different kinds of things with us.
[30:53] But the scripture give us a promise that
[30:55] we would be overcomers.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Not in oursel or in our abilities or any
[31:01] anything that we have done but through
[31:03] him.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Through him we're overcomers.
[31:10] And David comes home today. And you can
[31:13] imagine on his way home, you can read
[31:15] the this previous chapters of David has
[31:18] been at war. David has been there.
[31:21] They're making their way back home.
[31:23] There's been alliances that have been
[31:24] broken. They're making their way back
[31:26] home. You know, there's just something
[31:27] about going home.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; There's something about going home.
[31:31] There's no place like home
[31:35] &gt;&gt; for a salmon. There's no place like
[31:37] home. I'm going home. If it takes me
[31:40] 7,000 miles of swimming, I'm going home.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; For an eagle, its birthplace, it's going
[31:45] home.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; A horse, if you've ever been, I I was
[31:48] raised with horses and you could ride
[31:50] him all day long, but let him head put
[31:52] his head toward the barn, he's gone.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Just no place like home. after preaching
[31:59] meetings and and and and going and being
[32:01] away for maybe weeks and you're you're
[32:04] just now the last meeting is over with
[32:06] and maybe they want to show you around a
[32:09] bit and you know just your wife hasn't
[32:11] been with you. You just want to go home.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Just no nothing like I'm I'm talking to
[32:15] you now. I'm reading your mind
[32:19] and there's just no place like home.
[32:21] Right.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Best amener in the building sitting
[32:24] right here beside of me right now.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm I'm just And as David is
[32:29] going home, all of his men are under the
[32:31] anticipation and being a being a
[32:34] psalmist, they they're no doubt singing
[32:36] and they're rejoicing. They've got the
[32:38] victory. You know, when you got the
[32:40] victory, you know, everybody's got the
[32:42] victory and everybody's happy and
[32:44] everybody's patting everybody on the
[32:46] back and everybody's rejoicing and, you
[32:48] know, and they come across the last hill
[32:51] &gt;&gt; and there's their home.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine the scene that they
[32:57] begin to see.
[32:59] Homes are burnt. Smoke is going.
[33:02] Destruction is in everywhere.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And nobody has a house standing.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Not even the great David himself.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Wives are gone, children are gone,
[33:15] animals are gone. Nothing but rubble of
[33:18] a home.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; You see, we fight different enemies.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; One's a Philistine.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; He'll stand right out in front of you
[33:25] and make an incredible boast and say,
[33:27] "Take me on." Right?
[33:28] &gt;&gt; The other's an amlicot. He'll come in
[33:31] behind you secretly. He'll work behind
[33:34] you. And he'll come in and
[33:37] &gt;&gt; he'll take your family. He'll take your
[33:39] children. He'll take your possessions.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; And you find yourself literally standing
[33:46] there
[33:48] literally destroyed in your mind of what
[33:51] can you do?
[33:58] No feeling like losing it all,
[34:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:01] &gt;&gt; There's just no feeling like losing it
[34:02] all.
[34:07] Brother Joe Green's sister Betty
[34:12] just lost her son today as I preached
[34:14] this morning. She lost her husband three
[34:16] weeks ago.
[34:18] Lost her son this today. Boy in his 40s.
[34:23] I just hugged him in front of his
[34:25] father's casket only just a just a three
[34:28] weeks ago. Hugged him and put my arms
[34:30] around him and he said, "I want to come
[34:33] back.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; I want to come back to God.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; I want to come back to God."
[34:40] And just stood there with him and just
[34:42] spoke a few words of encouragement and
[34:44] prayed with him and he's gone this
[34:46] morning.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; She senses the feel of loss.
[34:51] Job felt the sense of loss of losing it
[34:54] all. Some of us think we've had some
[34:56] difficult days, but none of us ever had
[34:58] a day like Job had.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Job was there as an example. You see,
[35:04] Brother Random said God had confidence
[35:06] in Job.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; None of us gets a notice that you're
[35:10] getting ready to go through a trial. You
[35:13] don't get a a CD in the mail or
[35:15] something in the mail that tells you
[35:17] that that that you're you're you've been
[35:20] testified in heaven
[35:22] &gt;&gt; and God brought before himself the the
[35:26] devil himself
[35:28] &gt;&gt; and had a testimony about you.
[35:33] Many times David didn't see this coming.
[35:36] He didn't see it coming that his home
[35:38] would be destroyed. His wife and his
[35:40] children would be be gone.
[35:42] But now as a leader,
[35:45] he has to look around at all of the men
[35:48] that have fought with him
[35:51] and their home is gone
[35:54] &gt;&gt; and their children are gone
[35:56] &gt;&gt; and their possessions are gone.
[36:00] his right-hand men, men under them,
[36:04] and they're standing
[36:08] and their heart is dropped out the
[36:11] bottom.
[36:15] You know, some of those times where your
[36:17] heart just drops out the bottom. Have
[36:19] you ever come to a spot to where that
[36:21] you go, I give up.
[36:26] I don't know what to do next.
[36:30] I'm literally destroyed.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; What can I do?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And David looks at all of his men
[36:42] as a leader. He's responsible for the
[36:44] happenings.
[36:47] This wouldn't have happened to them if
[36:48] it hadn't been for me.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; This enemy was after me.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So, it's sorrow multiplied.
[37:00] You know, it's in a battle like this and
[37:04] that we come to times that we look at,
[37:06] we go through some things. Seem like
[37:09] almost every week you go through a an
[37:11] attack, an attack and an attack and an
[37:15] attack. Paul calls it buffeting.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And he just buffets and he buffets and
[37:20] he buffets. You know what I mean? And
[37:22] he's buffeting you. And he's trying to
[37:24] wear you down. And you wear you down.
[37:26] And just like the prophet standing there
[37:28] over top of his baby
[37:31] and he too even thought about giving up
[37:35] and he said just when I thought about
[37:38] giving up he came.
[37:43] He came
[37:46] &gt;&gt; and David was standing there and and now
[37:49] the people begin to murmur and they
[37:51] begin to they begin to let me just say
[37:54] sometimes
[37:57] let me just preach it how I feel like
[37:58] preaching it. Sometimes because of your
[38:02] humanity problems you want to blame the
[38:04] preacher
[38:07] &gt;&gt; because of your failure. The enemy will
[38:09] turn the target on your source of
[38:11] strength
[38:12] &gt;&gt; and try to crucify the source of
[38:15] strength.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And he's so bombarded you. He's taken
[38:19] your home and he's taken so many things.
[38:22] Now
[38:23] instead of falling to your knees and
[38:26] saying, "God,
[38:28] you had confidence in me that I could go
[38:30] through this situation.
[38:33] Now, God, I'm going to need your
[38:34] strength like never before." Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; The scripture said that these men
[38:40] &gt;&gt; that love David, that would have died
[38:42] for David, their comrades died and they
[38:45] fought. They left their homes and now
[38:47] the enemy's turned them.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; He's turned them on the refuge himself,
[38:58] &gt;&gt; the reason of being. He's turned them on
[39:01] the message of the hour I'm going to
[39:02] preach to you. And
[39:13] &gt;&gt; there they stand
[39:17] now wanting to stone the man that they
[39:19] followed,
[39:21] the man that they've held the banner
[39:23] for.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; The man that's been the leader. They
[39:26] know that he's going to the throne cuz
[39:28] God said so.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And God ain't in the business
[39:32] of starting something and then quitting
[39:33] something.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[39:37] &gt;&gt; We're going to make a rapture.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; You keep your eyes on the focus. There's
[39:42] a resurrection that's laying right in
[39:44] front of us.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the world says. I
[39:48] don't care what the chaos of governments
[39:50] is doing. We've got a promise.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; We got a promise. We're going toward the
[39:57] throne. We're going to rule and reign.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; They picked up their stones.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; David
[40:27] could have went and jumped off of a
[40:29] cliff,
[40:31] but he didn't.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; David could have said, "Go ahead and
[40:35] throw the stones. I'm worthy for the
[40:36] stones to be thrown."
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; David could have said, "Maybe you're
[40:42] right."
[40:45] But David did
[40:48] what we all got to do sometimes.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself.
[40:54] G.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just got to stop
[41:02] when the enemy is coming in like a flood
[41:05] &gt;&gt; and he's trying to destroy your life.
[41:08] You got to stop
[41:10] &gt;&gt; and recognize the trick of the devil
[41:12] &gt;&gt; and realize you're not running on
[41:14] another man's energies. You're not
[41:16] running on another man's mandate. I'm
[41:19] running on a purpose that God put inside
[41:21] of my heart. And there's nothing going
[41:23] to stop me. There's not a devil in hell.
[41:27] Can't touch a hair of your head until
[41:30] he's got permission from God. So why I'm
[41:32] going through this trial? He must have
[41:34] got permission.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to encourage myself in this
[41:39] trial. I'm going to encourage myself in
[41:42] this moment.
[41:45] Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; I'm trying not to I'm like brother Tom.
[42:01] Brother Tom says, "I'm going to slow
[42:03] down." And on the other end of that
[42:06] camera, I go, "Try that a little while,
[42:07] Tom.
[42:17] So sometimes you got to go back to your
[42:19] old sermons.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to go back to the old
[42:28] notes.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to go back to previous
[42:34] things that God's told you to write a
[42:36] song about.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; That's why I was going that way. You got
[42:40] to go back to when you were spending
[42:41] time with God and he gave you a line and
[42:43] he gave you a bear.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; While you're kicking around the ashes
[42:49] &gt;&gt; while you're kicking over the gravels,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; while you're standing in that spot,
[42:54] encourage yourself.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; So, let's just encourage oursel just for
[43:03] a few moment. You you mind being your
[43:06] captive audience?
[43:09] David writes, "Under the inspiration of
[43:11] God,
[43:14] in my distress,
[43:16] I called upon the Lord,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; and I cried unto my God, and he heard my
[43:22] voice out of his temple,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; and my cry came before me, even into his
[43:29] ears." Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; David recognized God's hearing my
[43:34] prayer.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; While the enemy was whispering in his
[43:38] ear, no doubt like he does you. God's
[43:40] not listening. He said, "God's hearing
[43:43] my prayers. It's even going in his ears.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; He gave me access." That's something you
[43:49] ought to thank God. He gave you access
[43:52] &gt;&gt; as his bride. You got access to whisper
[43:56] in his ears.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Glory. So maybe we ought to just stop
[44:01] and say, "What am I whining about to
[44:03] start off with? What am I worried about
[44:06] to start off with? What am I crying
[44:09] about to start off with?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; If God is on my side,
[44:18] &gt;&gt; are you listening to me tonight? If God
[44:20] is on my side,
[44:22] &gt;&gt; if God is on my side,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; not if so and so is on my side. I could
[44:26] care less about that. If God is on my
[44:28] side.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll fight the battle if this one's
[44:34] on. Let me just say this to you. It's me
[44:36] and Jesus.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Let me say it correctly. It's Jesus and
[44:42] me.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:55] Unto thee, oh Lord, do I lift up my
[44:58] soul.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my God, I trust in thee. Let me not
[45:03] be ashamed.
[45:05] Let not my enemies triumph over me.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; I will bless the Lord
[45:17] &gt;&gt; at all times.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; At all times.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can imagine as David is
[45:24] walking the circumference of his house
[45:28] and he's starting to sing, I will bless
[45:30] the Lord
[45:32] at all times. And somebody else was
[45:35] watching and going, I believe he's got
[45:38] something there. I believe David's got
[45:40] to do it. I'm going to do it for a
[45:42] little while.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; And another one's saying, "And I will
[45:45] bless the Lord."
[45:51] Because when the leader has to raise his
[45:53] hands, even when it don't feel like it,
[45:56] &gt;&gt; I will bless the Lord.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; And I hear the echo, I will bless the
[46:01] Lord. And it goes all down the line and
[46:03] they begin to sing, I will bless the
[46:05] Lord.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[46:15] Yes. Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; 40 and1 I I waited patiently before the
[46:23] Lord, and he and he inclined unto me,
[46:26] and heard my cry, and he brought me out
[46:29] of a horrible pit, out of a miry clay,
[46:32] and sl my my feet upon a rock, and
[46:35] established my going.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; 42 and 11.
[46:43] Why art thou cast down, oh my soul? Why
[46:46] art thou disquited within me? Hope thou
[46:49] in God, for I shall yet praise him who
[46:52] is the health of my countenance and my
[46:54] God.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; 56 he says, "Be be merciful unto me, oh
[47:00] God, for man would swallow me up. He
[47:03] fighting me daily oppresseth me. My
[47:06] enemies would daily swallow me up. For
[47:08] they had be many that fight against me,
[47:11] oh thou most high. What time I am
[47:15] afraid, I will trust in thee.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Let's not leave out the rapture chapter.
[47:25] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I feel? I think sometimes you
[47:32] ought to say that with attitude. Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Could you say it with me? Whom shall I
[47:39] feel? The Lord is the strength of my
[47:41] life. Of whom shall I be afraid?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Let's just say it, brother Allan. Of
[47:49] whom shall I be afraid?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Of whom shall I be afraid?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said that devil was so big
[47:58] and I just kept calling boot. Boo devil.
[48:03] Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; You see, these are songs. That's why we
[48:07] come into church and we begin to sing.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, singing just don't get to
[48:13] me. You don't understand the real deal
[48:15] here. Singing causes you to start
[48:17] testifying in song.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; And that song begins to sing when the
[48:24] redeemed are gathering in.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, what singing? Oh, what glory when
[48:28] the redeemed are gathering in.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And you're you're from your bosom, you
[48:36] begin to sing and testify
[48:39] &gt;&gt; and it goes beyond your feelings and
[48:41] your emotions and everything. And you
[48:44] have fought the enemy all week long and
[48:47] you begin to sing, standing on the
[48:49] ashes.
[48:56] When the wicked and my even mine enemies
[48:57] and my foes came upon me to eat my
[48:59] flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a
[49:03] host should encamp against me, my heart
[49:05] shall not fear. Though war should rise
[49:07] against me, in this will I be confident.
[49:10] One thing that I have desired of the
[49:12] Lord, that I will seek after, that I may
[49:14] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[49:16] days of my life, to behold the beauty of
[49:18] the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
[49:20] For in the time of trouble,
[49:23] God knows there's going to be trouble
[49:26] &gt;&gt; because of Adam's curse. You're born of
[49:29] woman and it's few days and full of
[49:31] trouble.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; But God said, "I'm going to be with you.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be with you."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Sure, the world has trouble. Sure, they
[49:41] have situations. Sure, they have this
[49:44] great despair. But there's a great
[49:46] difference between you and them. You've
[49:48] got God on your side.
[49:52] He's the greatest doctor. He's the
[49:53] greatest lawyer. He's the greatest real
[49:55] estate agent. He's the greatest
[49:57] psychologist.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; There is no problem that you come into
[50:03] in your life that God is not bigger than
[50:05] that problem.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; He's 10 million billion trillion times
[50:14] bigger than all the gates of hell.
[50:30] Michael, you might want to learn from
[50:31] somebody else besides me. I scream, I
[50:34] holler, I sweat, I persspare, but I hope
[50:37] that I shake the kingdom of hell.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; One a manner.
[50:49] For in the time of trouble
[50:53] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; In the sacra in the secret of his
[50:58] tabernacle shall he hide me. And he
[51:00] shall left he shall set me upon a rock.
[51:02] And now shall my head be lifted up about
[51:05] above around my enemies round about me.
[51:08] Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle
[51:10] sacrifices as joy. I will sing. Yay. I
[51:14] will sing praises unto the Lord.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, thou art my God. I will exalt
[51:24] thee. I will praise thy name. For thou
[51:27] hast done wonderful things. Thy
[51:29] counselss of old are faithfulness and
[51:32] true.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Verse four, thou hast been my strength
[51:35] to the poor, strength to the needy and
[51:37] distress, a refuge from the storm, a
[51:40] shadow from the heat, a blast of the
[51:42] terrible ones. in as as a storm against
[51:45] the wall. Isaiah 43 and1, "Oh Israel,
[51:49] fear not, for I have redeemed thee."
[51:51] &gt;&gt; That's all you got to say. He has
[51:53] redeemed me.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; I have called thee by thy name. Thou art
[51:59] mine. When thou passeth through the
[52:01] waters, I will be with thee,
[52:03] &gt;&gt; and through the rivers, they will not
[52:05] overtake thee. And when thou walst
[52:07] through the fire,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; thou shalt not be burned.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I stand as a testimony.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; I'm still here.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scripture says, "So that
[52:30] we may boldly sow the say, the Lord is
[52:32] my helper, and I will not fear what man
[52:35] shall do unto me."
[52:39] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 4, we are troubled on
[52:41] every side, yet not distress. We are
[52:44] perplexed, but not in despair.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; He's writing this from a dungeon.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; He's writing this from a dungeon.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; brother. You don't know my problems. I
[52:56] like to have about 3 hours. Let's just
[52:58] talk to Paul in the bottom of a pit.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Chained to a soldier and he's still
[53:03] getting anointed to write the word of
[53:05] God.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He don't have an iPad in his hand. He
[53:10] don't have coffee in his in his coffee
[53:12] maker. He's eating with the rats.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; His body is deteriorating away.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; We are troubled on every side.
[53:24] Get not distressed
[53:26] &gt;&gt; down in hell somewhere or another.
[53:27] They're having a meeting and said, "What
[53:29] can we do to the guy to shake him?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I put everything against him.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Don't assign me to Paul.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Could you say that
[53:40] &gt;&gt; about yourself?"
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I asked a brother the other day. I
[53:48] &gt;&gt; I said, "You know, sometimes you just
[53:50] like to know."
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I'd like to know how many
[53:53] devils it is scars when they call my
[53:55] name.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; What do they think of me in hell?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; What do they think?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; What do they think? You know, names have
[54:04] have incredible stories that goes along
[54:06] with them. David has books that's
[54:07] written about him.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't m doesn't matter small or
[54:11] great. Shamgar has one scripture.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I don't even need my name called.
[54:21] Are you with me now?
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you roll over in the
[54:24] morning and bath them brown eyes, blue
[54:26] eyes, green eyes, whatever hazel eyes
[54:28] that you've got, I would like for the
[54:30] torment of hell.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; To say he's awake
[54:34] &gt;&gt; and he's going to cause trouble today.
[54:41] Listen, if you can ever get away from
[54:42] the old poor pitiful me
[54:44] &gt;&gt; and all the trouble that's going, let's
[54:46] go into the year with courage.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about courage that's
[54:54] in your energies cuz that'll run out
[54:56] after a while. I'm talking about courage
[54:58] of God that every time you get into
[55:00] trial, it runs you right back to God. It
[55:03] runs you. You keep the strength.
[55:07] This is the greatest protein bar you'll
[55:09] ever eat.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; We are perplexed but not in despair.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Persecuted but not forsaken. Cast down
[55:20] but not destroyed. Always bearing about
[55:22] in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus
[55:26] &gt;&gt; that the life of Jesus might abound to
[55:28] the manifest of the of of our inner
[55:30] body. He said, "For we which are live
[55:33] are always delivered unto death for
[55:35] Jesus' sake, that our life also of Jesus
[55:38] might be manifest in our mortal flesh."
[55:41] So then death workketh in us, but life
[55:43] in you. We having the same spirit of
[55:47] faith.
[55:48] Accords as according as it is written, I
[55:52] believed
[55:54] and therefore have I spoken.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; We also believe.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. and therefore speak.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just go ahead and make the devil
[56:11] pass out here for a minute.
[56:16] Brother Ron, don't you know that we're
[56:21] Don't you know that we're quieter
[56:23] people?
[56:25] We're not noisy like you are.
[56:35] We come from the quiet quieter part of
[56:37] heaven.
[56:49] Hallelujah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you just need to let
[56:53] the devil know who side you on.
[56:58] Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Lyn, let me just share with you
[57:00] when you start to get the victory, it's
[57:02] going to make you get a little bit
[57:04] happy.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I walked out of the hotel and the
[57:09] Seahawks was winning. That might not
[57:11] mean nothing to none of you, but I got a
[57:12] feeling it does.
[57:17] And as I walked out of the hotel, they
[57:19] were screaming. They were jumping.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[57:25] They were dancing.
[57:28] I can't describe what all they were
[57:30] doing, but they were happy.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz they'd won a victory.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; That's football.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; For all the angels that are in the
[57:43] building, that's football.
[57:51] Don't act like that to me. I know you. I
[57:54] know you. I see your Facebook. I see
[57:56] your Instagram.
[58:04] So when we come to church,
[58:07] we sit down and we get quiet.
[58:12] And an amen is a victory.
[58:19] to raise our hands is grace over
[58:22] arthritis.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; What you need
[58:29] &gt;&gt; is to start kicking some ashes.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to get through this.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Leon is not going to last for so long.
[58:42] We're going to be walking on streets of
[58:43] gold. We're going to be in a millennium.
[58:46] In a few days, I'm going to see my mama.
[58:49] I'm going to see my father-in-law. I'm
[58:51] going to see my loved ones. And I'm
[58:53] going to look down like brother Jules
[58:54] sings. My hands are new. My feet are
[58:57] new.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; I know you're emotional, so I'm just
[59:09] going to help you.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Psalms 150,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; the writer of the man that was on the
[59:15] ashes.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. right
[59:17] &gt;&gt; that was kicking the rocks around where
[59:19] his wife was go, his two wives and his
[59:20] children was gone.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The same writer.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; That encouraged himself in the Lord.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be long,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; but he encouraged himself in the Lord.
[59:31] These are the things that he wrote.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God in his
[59:37] sanctuary.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Praise him in the firmament of his
[59:40] power.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Praise him for his mighty action. Praise
[59:43] him according to his excellent
[59:45] greatness.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Praise him with the sound of a temp of a
[59:48] trumpet. And praise him with the saucery
[59:50] of a harp. Praise him with the temple
[59:52] and a dance. Praise him with the
[59:54] strings, instruments, and organs. Praise
[59:56] him with loud sounding symbols. Praise
[59:58] him up on the high sounding symbols. It
[1:00:01] does not sound like a quiet church.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Let everything
[1:00:12] that have breath.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to tell you,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I give you every right in the world to
[1:00:35] set dead still tonight if you're dead.
[1:00:39] If you're dead,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; if you're dead like an old tree that the
[1:00:43] leaves have gone because of the pommeorm
[1:00:46] and the canker were and you're not
[1:00:48] restored and you're just sitting there
[1:00:49] and you haven't got the joy of God, just
[1:00:52] go ahead and sit there. But you don't
[1:00:53] have to.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay dead.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Take courage.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:08] As for me in my house, we're going to
[1:01:11] serve the Lord.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; It's more than a good sign to go in your
[1:01:20] refrigerator. It ought to be the anthem
[1:01:22] in your home. That's for me and my
[1:01:24] house. That's for me in my house. Me and
[1:01:28] my house.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:39] We're going to serve the Lord.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you read Church Order?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; But you came too late.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You see, I've been in this message since
[1:01:57] 1961.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Babed in this message.
[1:02:04] And the same prophet that you and I have
[1:02:07] would come to the end of a lot of
[1:02:08] services and he had a habit of doing
[1:02:10] this. Taking his coat off and start
[1:02:12] swinging like this right here.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Then he would go out in the street and
[1:02:19] start doing that.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; So he wasn't real quiet.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I like it. Don't you
[1:02:32] ain't that right? You know those
[1:02:34] stories. You know them.
[1:02:38] You know him. Boo devil. We know him
[1:02:40] too.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:55] My father-in-law was preaching a
[1:02:56] funeral.
[1:03:00] Some of you met, Sister Linda. You met
[1:03:02] my father-in-law.
[1:03:04] Your daddy loved him.
[1:03:09] He was original.
[1:03:12] He preached. The first time that brother
[1:03:13] Homer met, brother Bisco was at brother
[1:03:16] Billy Andrews funeral. They shared it.
[1:03:21] Brother Homer preached on a living God
[1:03:25] and he preached it. And brother Biscll
[1:03:27] preached on our our inheritance.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Still remember I remember sermons.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; You preached on love in Switzerland cuz
[1:03:36] you was in love.
[1:03:52] Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] You forgive me. It's the last night.
[1:03:58] Sister Conniey's going, "Oh, God. Let
[1:04:00] him finish quickly."
[1:04:03] We had a funeral and brother Homer
[1:04:06] was a some of the family members had a
[1:04:09] had a denominational speaker that was
[1:04:11] going to be a part of it and he called
[1:04:13] brother Homer. He said, "Now, Brother
[1:04:14] Homer, some of the family, you know,
[1:04:16] they don't want you to get too excited."
[1:04:19] He said, "What do you mean?" He thought,
[1:04:21] "I'll just I just I'll just say what do
[1:04:22] you mean?"
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know,
[1:04:26] they want you to be kind of quiet." He
[1:04:28] said, "Oh, okay."
[1:04:30] Okay. Well, he said, "You go first and
[1:04:32] show me.
[1:04:40] Old guys should not be rookies."
[1:04:42] So, he got up and he said his little
[1:04:44] deal.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; He finished up.
[1:04:48] Brother Homer started. He was nice. He
[1:04:50] was a gentleman.
[1:04:55] He said, 'You know,
[1:04:59] I was asked by this pastor to be quiet.
[1:05:06] I was asked by him to behave myself and
[1:05:08] not get excited
[1:05:12] and I'm going to do my best
[1:05:15] to behave. But when I get to thinking
[1:05:18] about what Jesus did for this
[1:05:19] bootleggger son,
[1:05:23] that had to be got out of jail and I was
[1:05:26] constantly in fights and and I didn't
[1:05:28] want to serve the God. But now now God's
[1:05:31] raised me up and he just begin to go on
[1:05:33] and on. Yeah. He got a little bit
[1:05:35] excited.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think that we get all formal
[1:05:41] because we forgot where we come from.
[1:05:54] That's just a warning for the next
[1:05:55] little bit here.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Psalms 100,
[1:06:01] you know, you ought to ought to have at
[1:06:03] least a couple different, you know,
[1:06:06] couple different scriptures to verify.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; We got to get David encouraged.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; While we're getting David encouraged,
[1:06:12] he's getting the whole congregation
[1:06:14] encouraged. And while I'm getting them
[1:06:16] encouraged, I'm going to encourage you.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; I'm at your house.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I'm kicking the ashes with you.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Make a joyful noise
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord all your lands.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord with gladness,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and come before his presence with
[1:06:36] singing.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Know ye that he, the Lord, he is God,
[1:06:41] and it is he that hath made us, not we
[1:06:43] ourselves. We are his people and sheep
[1:06:45] of his pasture.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Enter the gates with thanksgiving into
[1:06:49] the courts with praise and be thankful
[1:06:51] unto him and bless his name. For the
[1:06:53] Lord is good and his mercy is
[1:06:56] everlasting and his truth endureth
[1:06:58] through all generations.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Psalms 149 said, "Praise ye the Lord.
[1:07:07] Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his
[1:07:10] praise, his congregation of saints.
[1:07:14] Let Israel rejoice in him that made him.
[1:07:17] Let the children of Zion be joyful unto
[1:07:20] the king.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Let them praise his name in the dance.
[1:07:24] Let them sing praises unto him with a
[1:07:27] temple and a harp. For the Lord taketh
[1:07:30] pleasure in his people. Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; He will beautify the meek with
[1:07:36] salvation. Let the saints be joyful in
[1:07:39] glory. Let them sing aloud with their up
[1:07:40] on their beds. Let the high praises be
[1:07:43] to of God be in their mouth and a
[1:07:45] two-edged sword in their hand.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Psalms 103, bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:07:53] and all that is within me, bless his
[1:07:56] holy name.
[1:07:59] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[1:08:02] not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all
[1:08:06] thine iniquities, who health all thy
[1:08:09] diseases.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I feel like that mouse coming out of
[1:08:14] that wine bottle about right now.
[1:08:16] Where's the cat?
[1:08:19] Hallelujah.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[1:08:28] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:08:30] and tender mercies, who satisfy thy
[1:08:33] mouth with good things, so that thy
[1:08:34] youth is renewed like an eagle.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, that was to David.
[1:08:40] Well, let me just read something to you.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven.
[1:08:50] and a new earth.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; For the first earth was passed away, and
[1:08:54] there was no more sea. And I, John, saw
[1:08:57] the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming
[1:08:59] down out of God, out of heaven, prepared
[1:09:01] as a bride adorned for her husband. And
[1:09:03] I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[1:09:05] saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
[1:09:07] with men, and he will dwell with them,
[1:09:09] and they shall be his people, and God
[1:09:11] himself shall be with him, and be their
[1:09:13] God.
[1:09:18] Oh, brother Ron, brother Roy. Oh, they
[1:09:20] say I'm going to I'm going to shout on
[1:09:22] streets of go. What about right now?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Your friends can do their dance.
[1:09:45] They can break their legs. They can do
[1:09:46] shimmer sauce. And then the devil will
[1:09:49] tell you not to get happy.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Wrong.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; They'll stand in subzero weather.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It just happened to be you.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm having a good time." When
[1:10:10] their team loses.
[1:10:12] Yeah,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; they're still having a good time. Then
[1:10:15] how can we come to church of the living
[1:10:17] God?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And I don't care whether it's a
[1:10:22] Wednesday night or a Sunday morning or a
[1:10:23] Sunday night
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; or a Monday on your job.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You feel that depressing spirit coming
[1:10:32] around. I'm preaching to you now.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; You feel it coming around trying to
[1:10:38] destroy your day.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just stop?
[1:10:44] Stop and encourage yourself, Ella.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; When the devil is whispering in your
[1:10:52] ear, you'll never get no better. You're
[1:10:54] only going to regress as age comes
[1:10:56] along, why don't you just stop?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's my turn.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rejoice.
[1:11:11] I'm going to overcome.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever comes my way, I'm going to
[1:11:17] overcome.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; He's with me.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Gal.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] He that dwelleth in the secret place
[1:11:54] of the most high shall abide under the
[1:11:56] shadow of the almighty.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and my fortress,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; my God.
[1:12:09] In him will I trust.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:12:16] snare of the fowler, from the noise of
[1:12:18] pestilence. He shall cover thee with his
[1:12:21] feathers, and under his wings thou shalt
[1:12:22] trust. His truth shall be thy shield and
[1:12:25] buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid, for
[1:12:28] the terror by night, nor the arrow that
[1:12:30] flyth by day, nor the pestilence that
[1:12:31] walketh into darkness, nor the
[1:12:33] destruction that waiteth at noon day.
[1:12:35] I'm sorry, brother Murphy. A thousand
[1:12:37] shall fall at thy side, and 10,000 at
[1:12:39] thy right hand, but it shall not come n
[1:12:41] thee.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Only with thine hand shalt thou behold
[1:12:45] and see the reward of the wicked,
[1:12:46] because thou hast made the Lord, which
[1:12:48] is my refuge, even the most high, thou
[1:12:50] thou habitation. There shall no evil
[1:12:53] befall thee. Now they see in the plague
[1:12:55] come plague come n thy dwelling. For he
[1:12:58] shall give his angels.
[1:13:02] Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; He shall give his angels charge over
[1:13:07] thee to keep thee in all thy ways. For
[1:13:09] they shall bear thee up in their hands,
[1:13:11] lest thou dash thy foot against the
[1:13:13] stone. Thou shalt tread upon the uh the
[1:13:15] lion and the adder, the young lion and
[1:13:18] the dragon shalt thou travel under feet.
[1:13:20] Because he hath set his love upon me,
[1:13:22] therefore will I deliver him. I will set
[1:13:24] him on high because he hath known my
[1:13:26] name. He shall call upon me, and I will
[1:13:29] answer him. I will be with him in
[1:13:31] trouble. I will deliver him and honor
[1:13:34] him. With long life will I satisfy him
[1:13:36] and show him
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; my salvation.
[1:13:55] Job said, "Hold your peace.
[1:13:59] Let me alone
[1:14:01] that I may speak."
[1:14:05] I think that's what we ought to do
[1:14:06] sometime.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Critic, you need to just shut up.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Devil, be quiet.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Be quiet.
[1:14:18] Let me talk for a little bit.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; You're welcome to quit. Make me quit
[1:14:26] anytime you want to.
[1:14:32] It It's about to get good here.
[1:14:38] Wherefore do I take my flesh in my in my
[1:14:41] teeth and put my life in thine hand?
[1:14:45] Notice these words.
[1:14:49] Though he slay me,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; though he slay me,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to say it.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; do you really mean it?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm sure we got the enemy here.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So, let's go ahead and give him a rough
[1:15:13] time.
[1:15:15] Let's just make him pass out.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; yet I'm going to trust him.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Won't you just go ahead and make that
[1:15:30] declaration? Let's just take a time out.
[1:15:32] Why don't you just go ahead? Though he
[1:15:33] slay me, yet I'm going to trust him.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You've been told you're an invincible
[1:15:43] army, that you're a super race, a super
[1:15:46] church, a super bride, that you're part
[1:15:48] of the God race. You might as well start
[1:15:50] talking about that yourself.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It ain't what you think about yourself.
[1:15:54] That's what God told you in this
[1:15:56] message.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; And God just went whistling Dixie when
[1:16:00] he told you those things. That's what
[1:16:01] God thought of. And God's word is
[1:16:04] eternal. It's infinite. He's never made
[1:16:06] a mistake. He pre-planned you before the
[1:16:09] foundation of the world. He didn't bring
[1:16:11] you this far to leave you in the middle
[1:16:12] of the stream.
[1:16:14] We're his people.
[1:16:17] We are his people. My name's on the
[1:16:20] book. And there's not a devil in hell
[1:16:22] can take it off that book.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to
[1:16:28] Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Let me preach to the invisible audience.
[1:16:33] No matter what you're going through in
[1:16:35] your life, God's with you.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; The most powerful thing about you is
[1:16:42] your tongue.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So just start encouraging yourself.
[1:17:06] Maybe you don't know this,
[1:17:09] but when I woke up from the coma
[1:17:14] and was laying in the bed, Whitney
[1:17:17] said she got over close to me and I was
[1:17:19] going, "Boo, devil.
[1:17:27] devil.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Devil,
[1:17:38] you
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; won't you just repeat this with me?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Devil.
[1:17:55] devil.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; You see, my lungs were were literally
[1:18:03] burn up.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; They were going to take my organs in
[1:18:07] five hours if I don't wake up. But your
[1:18:11] pastor,
[1:18:13] stupid critics.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Just stupid critics.
[1:18:20] You know why they do that? Let me borrow
[1:18:22] this, brother Timothy. You know why they
[1:18:23] do that? Cuz they're stupid.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that hurts my feelings.
[1:18:33] Well, you may be on the other side. And
[1:18:35] if a rock comes and hit you and it
[1:18:36] offends you. Yeah, baby.
[1:18:51] Let me take care of that while I'm here.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Let me take care of that devil while I'm
[1:18:55] here.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; I've been told that I'm a defender of
[1:18:59] brother Ed.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; What would you do?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; What would you do?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Let me just ask you. What would you do?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let me get square. Just roll my
[1:19:13] sleeves up like Peter Carrite. He come
[1:19:14] from my country.
[1:19:20] You're laying in a coma.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Sister Connie said that brother Biscoll
[1:19:27] called her and said you're going to
[1:19:28] speak next year's sir
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Mount Baker camp.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Now just show up going to speak.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; You talking about putting your whole
[1:19:39] ministry on the line.
[1:19:43] all the years that he's preached the
[1:19:46] five ladies of grace.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1, you're putting your
[1:19:53] whole words on the line cuz God spoke to
[1:19:55] you. And if you're wrong, you got to go
[1:19:57] get that devil off of you.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. All these guessers and all this
[1:20:03] nonsense and all these critics.
[1:20:06] When your pastor said he'll preach at
[1:20:08] next year's meeting, that was impossible
[1:20:11] by human eyes.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That was impossible by human eyes.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not just preaching a sermon. I'm
[1:20:22] giving you my life. Sister Connie, her
[1:20:26] husband was laying at the point of death
[1:20:28] and the doctor saying he was going to
[1:20:30] die and foam was coming out of my mouth
[1:20:33] because my lungs were so full of
[1:20:34] pneumonia and it was coming out of my
[1:20:36] eyes and my nose and and foam was coming
[1:20:39] out. But your pastor was talked to by
[1:20:43] God
[1:20:47] and I was being seen by the best doctors
[1:20:49] that there was and they were giving up
[1:20:52] hope. One of them said, "I noticed the
[1:20:55] friends that you had come in and I knew
[1:20:57] you was a great man." And he said, "I
[1:20:59] knew that I'd done all that I could do.
[1:21:01] I got down beside your bed and I prayed
[1:21:04] for you."
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; So, I know about kicking ashes.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I know about a home being burned out. I
[1:21:15] know about an enemy trying to destroy.
[1:21:19] And Sister Connie didn't whisper it in
[1:21:21] these ears. She's not some little dainty
[1:21:23] little blonde. She took God at his word.
[1:21:27] Yes, sir.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; She took God at his words. And she told
[1:21:32] my children, he told us, "Don't never
[1:21:35] think a negative thought." Don't let a
[1:21:38] negative thought go through your mind.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Don't let a negative thought go through
[1:21:46] your mind. I'm preaching now. I'm
[1:21:48] encouraging myself. I'm walking into a
[1:21:50] miracle,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim. I'm walking into a miracle.
[1:21:58] I'm stepping into it.
[1:22:15] I'm not going to give you details, but
[1:22:17] the doctor sat down with me and cried
[1:22:19] Monday.
[1:22:22] Gave me really bad news
[1:22:25] and I'll go home Wednesday to start
[1:22:27] running tests all over again. They've
[1:22:30] been running tests for a couple weeks.
[1:22:32] But did you think I come to this meeting
[1:22:34] discouraged?
[1:22:36] Do you can't think I come to this
[1:22:37] meeting with a pity party? I come to
[1:22:40] this meeting, I'm preaching my way right
[1:22:42] into a miracle.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; So at this point, here we go.
[1:23:06] Who hath believed our report?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:23:11] revealed?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up him before him as a
[1:23:14] tender plant, as a root out of dry
[1:23:15] ground. And he hath no form to come to
[1:23:17] us. And when we shall see him, there is
[1:23:19] no beauty that we should desire him. He
[1:23:21] has despised and rejected a man, a man
[1:23:23] of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and
[1:23:25] we hid as it were our faces from him. He
[1:23:27] was despised, and we esteemed him not.
[1:23:30] Preach with me. Surely he hath borne our
[1:23:33] griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we
[1:23:35] did esteem him stricken and smitten of
[1:23:38] God and afflicted, but he was wounded.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:47] Glor.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for my transgressions.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for my iniquity.
[1:23:59] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:24:02] him, and with his stripes we are
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; healed.
[1:24:18] God's greater than cancer.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; God's greater than cancer.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; He's greater than cancer.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he the devil hates me
[1:24:33] and I know he hates you, too. He's my
[1:24:36] enemy. And as long as God's my friend, I
[1:24:38] don't have no fear of him. I just drive
[1:24:40] him right on back and take the word of
[1:24:42] God and move right back out of his right
[1:24:45] out of his that he thinks he's holding.
[1:24:48] He hasn't got no strongholds. He's
[1:24:51] absolutely legally defeated on every
[1:24:53] place.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; The devil hasn't got one legal right out
[1:24:58] of it nowhere. He's just a devil and a
[1:25:01] password. That's all. He hasn't got no
[1:25:03] legal right
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; to any man that'll accept the promise of
[1:25:08] Jesus Christ. He's whipped.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; He's whipped in death.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; He don't scare me. He can't scare you.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. How the devil has to recognize
[1:25:29] the supreme authority of Jesus Christ,
[1:25:31] not me.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He hates me. He don't have to mind me,
[1:25:35] but he has to mind who I represent.
[1:25:40] He has to mind who sent me here.
[1:25:42] Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Listen to him pray.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; you who bound these people,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; you're exposed tonight.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; There was some exposing went on this
[1:26:01] morning.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I'm smart enough to know that there was
[1:26:05] some exposing went on. Your name got
[1:26:08] called.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Now you'll have to do what Non did.
[1:26:14] You'll either have to do it God's way or
[1:26:17] your way.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And you'll never overcome doing it your
[1:26:21] way.
[1:26:34] Satan, you who've bound these people,
[1:26:38] you're exposed tonight.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Your grips are lost.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; You have no legal authority at all.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ robbed you.
[1:26:51] and stripped you at Calvary.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And we come as a church of the living
[1:26:56] God.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And in the name of Jesus Christ, I adure
[1:27:00] thee to leave every person in the
[1:27:02] building.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Come out of the people.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Thou demons, Iure thee
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; by the living God.
[1:27:22] Let me just reread a couple of
[1:27:23] scriptures and I won't be much longer.
[1:27:28] But I take no responsibility from this
[1:27:30] point. I've tried to behave
[1:27:34] and I've tried to not act Pentecostal.
[1:27:39] And David was greatly distressed.
[1:27:43] And the people spake a stone in him
[1:27:45] because of the soul of the people was
[1:27:47] grieved.
[1:27:48] Every man for his sons and his
[1:27:50] daughters. But David encouraged himself
[1:27:52] in the Lord his God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And David said unto Abathar the priest,
[1:28:00] Amal's son, I pray they bring me an
[1:28:02] ephot. And Abathar brought the thither
[1:28:05] the ephot to David. And David inquired
[1:28:07] at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue
[1:28:11] after this troop?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Shall I overtake them?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And he answered,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; this is God answered.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Pursue,
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; pursue.
[1:28:34] For thou shalt overtake them.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt surely overtake them.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I like these next words.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And without fail
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; recover all
[1:28:53] milk. She's coming.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Take it back.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Take it back.
[1:29:05] Take it back. The enemy came to your
[1:29:08] camp.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He took your treasures. He took your
[1:29:12] family. Take it back.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:35] I'd like to stand and testify.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Today is Mariah's 16th birthday.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Today is Mariah's 16th birthday. And the
[1:29:46] enemy walked into her camp.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And gave her Al Capia and her hair came
[1:29:51] off.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And listen, nobody's ever been cured.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody. Nobody on record's ever been
[1:29:59] cured of alap al whatever.
[1:30:07] And under inspiration,
[1:30:09] Brother Tim began to pray one night
[1:30:12] and he stopped
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and he said, "God's going to restore
[1:30:15] your glory."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And she came to the youth camp that some
[1:30:20] of you are getting ready to come to in
[1:30:21] Louisiana. She came through the prayer
[1:30:23] line where we was at
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and she had three bobby pins in her
[1:30:27] hands
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and she said, "I'm going to use these
[1:30:29] again.
[1:30:33] Hallelujah. The devil took it away, but
[1:30:36] God's restoring the glory.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It is a sign that God is restoring the
[1:30:44] glory of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And what he did physically,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; that's what he's doing spiritually. He's
[1:30:52] restoring your glory.
[1:31:01] Let me just dance a minute. Cloverdale,
[1:31:03] you've been through some real wars.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; But he has restored your glory.
[1:31:17] Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] Hallelujah.
[1:31:27] Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Your sister was in brother Tim's meeting
[1:31:39] and she was sitting there and and cancer
[1:31:42] was all through her body
[1:31:45] sitting up there and Elena is sitting in
[1:31:48] that spot.
[1:31:51] Something begin to hit on the inside of
[1:31:53] her. Yes,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; she pursued.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And she ran all over that building.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; She ran all over that building.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just got to pursue.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to go get it.
[1:32:23] You got to go get it.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; You got to act on faith. You got to step
[1:32:28] in the water.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; You got to step into the fire. And you
[1:32:33] know that he's going to be with you in
[1:32:35] the fire.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Where was the energy going to come for
[1:32:40] you to preach this meeting, brother? I
[1:32:42] just know he's a supernatural God.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And I feel stronger right now than what
[1:32:47] I felt before I started the meeting. Go
[1:32:49] get it. Pursue after it. Overtake it.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Connie has fought sarcoidosis.
[1:33:08] Thousands of tumors in her lungs.
[1:33:12] Thousands of tumors. And the doctor
[1:33:13] looked at me when they was down inside
[1:33:15] with the scope. And he said, "Preacher,
[1:33:18] you better pray this ain't cancer." And
[1:33:20] I said, "Well, what do you think?" He
[1:33:21] said, "If if she's got cancer in two
[1:33:23] weeks,
[1:33:25] she's going to be gone." And I went into
[1:33:28] a room. I felt like fainting. I went
[1:33:29] into a room and I got into a little old
[1:33:31] cubby hole and I remembered the
[1:33:33] scripture. Encourage yourself.
[1:33:38] When there ain't nobody to hold your
[1:33:39] hand and you're sitting in a room all by
[1:33:41] yourself, encourage yourself.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's what you did.
[1:33:55] You encouraged yourself
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; that which you preached and you
[1:34:00] motivated and you spoke to us. I wish I
[1:34:03] could preach like you right now,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; but you encouraged yourself and God
[1:34:07] didn't forget you.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I was getting in a car in South Carolina
[1:34:17] about,00 people getting in a car in
[1:34:20] South Carolina and I was done. I was
[1:34:21] toast. I was over. I'd prayed for people
[1:34:24] all evening. I was getting in a car.
[1:34:27] Connie was driving. My son was putting
[1:34:29] me in. Andrew putting me in. And they
[1:34:31] said, "There's a baby in a wheelchair
[1:34:32] that needs to be prayed for."
[1:34:36] And I walked into that building and
[1:34:37] about 50 preachers sitting there and I
[1:34:39] took her by her feet and I begin to
[1:34:42] pray. You will never know what it felt
[1:34:45] like when that baby come out of that
[1:34:46] wheelchair and ran all over that
[1:34:48] building.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I was preaching one night and the and
[1:35:04] And I was preaching on meeting the devil
[1:35:05] face to face.
[1:35:09] One of my brothers was sitting about
[1:35:12] like where you are right now, brother
[1:35:13] Allan. He was sitting there, actually
[1:35:15] looks a lot like you. He was he was
[1:35:18] sitting there and as I was ending, he
[1:35:21] died.
[1:35:23] He was gone. He just sat quietly. He
[1:35:27] later said, he said, 'I saw the light
[1:35:28] coming and I couldn't do anything. I
[1:35:31] just sat there and looked at that light
[1:35:33] and he said, "It's gone."
[1:35:37] Paramedics was there. People began to
[1:35:39] look at him. The audience was quiet. I
[1:35:43] stepped to his side. I laid my hand on
[1:35:45] his neck and there was no pulse there.
[1:35:47] His eyes was rolled back in his head and
[1:35:50] he was just white ashen like your paper.
[1:35:54] And I begin to pray and I begin to call
[1:35:57] his name because this message works.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know what people do without
[1:36:04] this.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And I begin to pray. And I said, "Doug,
[1:36:11] come back to me. Doug, come back to me.
[1:36:14] Doug, come back to me." And he all of a
[1:36:15] sudden sat up and looked at me.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hello, Brother
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Ron."
[1:36:28] I said, "You go to the hospital. They're
[1:36:30] waiting on you. They got a gurnie ready
[1:36:31] for you." I don't feel bad. I feel good.
[1:36:32] I said, "Let them tell you there's
[1:36:34] nothing wrong with you."
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He spent three days in the hospital and
[1:36:38] they checked him from head to toe and
[1:36:39] all they could say is, "They ain't got
[1:36:41] nothing wrong with you.
[1:36:55] Sometimes you got to go after it and
[1:36:56] take it back.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You got to go after what the devil has
[1:37:00] stole from you.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You got to go after it, Sister Linda.
[1:37:06] You got to go after it, brother Lou. You
[1:37:08] got to go after it.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You got to go after it.
[1:37:19] Take it back.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Overtake it.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, are you going to have a
[1:37:28] prayer line? I'm having it right now.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Whether you know it or not, I'm
[1:37:32] conducting it right now.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to reach out right now and
[1:37:37] say, "It's mine.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; It's mine. Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to grab a hold of it. It's
[1:37:51] mine.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Make a list.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Make a list.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Satan, you tried to steal it away from
[1:38:08] me.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jackie called your name this
[1:38:14] morning. It's yours.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It's yours, Sister Ruth.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:38:42] It's yours.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; The same God's in this building as it
[1:38:47] was when you was a 14y old girl.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Won't you claim it?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Now I'm exercising.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; It's yours. had some dark days, haven't
[1:39:11] you?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Want to take a walk?
[1:39:31] The healer's in the house.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Do you know? Do you know that I sent you
[1:39:39] that?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And I sent you that because of the angel
[1:39:44] of the Lord met me in the room.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And I laid my hand on that napkin
[1:39:50] and he said, "Send that to Ella.
[1:40:02] Which hand is the best hand?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; This uh this one.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; We're going to the pull pit.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; We're going to sit on the pull pit.
[1:40:27] We're walking into the vision.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, don't you see the
[1:40:34] circumstances? Don't you see the
[1:40:36] promise?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you see the promise?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; What did you come to the building
[1:40:48] expecting tonight?
[1:40:58] Hallelujah.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, mom. Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] Hallelujah. Baby, I'm going to let you
[1:41:23] sit down right here.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; You see Barardameus, if you'd have met
[1:41:32] him before, he was blind.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; But once Jesus came, he wasn't blind no
[1:41:37] more.
[1:41:39] You see Legion in the tombs, he was full
[1:41:42] of the devil. But once Jesus came, he
[1:41:46] wasn't called legion no more. He was
[1:41:49] clothed and in his right mind.
[1:41:53] I'm not paralyzed no more.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Take it back.
[1:42:13] Take it back,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Satan. Turn loose of it.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; I charge you in the name of Jesus
[1:42:20] Christ. Turn loose of my health. Turn
[1:42:23] loose of my strength.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You need a revival in your heart right
[1:42:33] now.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Grab a hold of it. It's here for you.
[1:42:40] Whatever your need, the answer is in the
[1:42:43] building.
[1:43:13] Thank you Jesus.
[1:43:24] Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] How it's time to call the prodal home.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is when a son and
[1:43:50] daughter comes back home.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Those that's got spiritual amnesia.
[1:43:58] Let's pray for a wake up that they can
[1:44:00] see the water tower and find the path, a
[1:44:03] familiar path, and start climbing up
[1:44:05] over the hill. start climbing up over
[1:44:07] the hill and just keep walking and keep
[1:44:10] walking and keep walking and keep
[1:44:13] walking and let the confusion leave
[1:44:16] their minds and just keep walking in the
[1:44:19] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; It's time for your children to come
[1:44:25] home.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Satan, you can't hold them no longer.
[1:44:39] Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] I got
[1:45:28] the hell.
[1:45:38] Thank you.
[1:45:43] God
[1:46:00] Hallelujah.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I speak to you in the name of the Lord
[1:46:13] Jesus.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Not just Cloverdale,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; but all around this universal bride. May
[1:46:20] we stand with a God with healing in his
[1:46:23] wings
[1:46:25] with power of rapture and power of
[1:46:27] resurrection and power of overcoming
[1:46:29] Leotia.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; May we stand to a true and living God.
[1:46:36] Hallelujah. May we take authority in the
[1:46:39] name of Jesus Christ in this very moment
[1:46:43] standing in this brand new year.
[1:46:46] Satan can take your hands off of God's
[1:46:48] property.
[1:46:55] Take your hands off of God's property.
[1:46:58] No matter the circumstance or the
[1:47:00] situation or the family matters,
[1:47:05] no matter the dark situations and the
[1:47:08] difficulty to explain
[1:47:13] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; demons of hell,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; house of hell give
[1:47:27] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I take what's rightfully mine.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; I take it what's rightly mine. I take my
[1:47:45] claim. I believe it.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[1:48:06] Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] young men, young ladies,
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; moms and dads,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; all of the young people all the way to
[1:48:41] 120. So that should get us off.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; On this first weekend, the last service
[1:48:50] of this weekend, I want you to walk
[1:48:52] right up to your mountain
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; and write a check
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and deposited in the bank of heaven.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to speak something with
[1:49:09] your lips.
[1:49:11] Your lips, not mine.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Your lips, your tongue,
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; you speak it.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; My health is coming back.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; My children are coming home.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; I will not be defeated in the name of
[1:49:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to speak to those dark
[1:49:32] shadows and those impossibilities.
[1:49:35] I want you as amateur gods on the earth.
[1:49:37] I want you to speak to it.
[1:50:02] Thank you, Father.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:50:13] Thank you, Father.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:50:37] Thank you Jesus.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:51:15] wonder why
[1:51:20] is
[1:51:23] Jesus
[1:51:51] God sends his pure
[1:51:55] sweet
[1:51:57] love.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's worship him now.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; God sends his pure
[1:52:23] sweet
[1:52:24] love
[1:52:27] from above
[1:52:33] on the wings of God.
[1:52:39] On the wings of a snow,
[1:52:47] God sends his pure

[1:54:02] for God
[1:54:06] My father alone.
[1:54:13] He gave me his son.
[1:54:19] On the wings of the ground,
[1:54:25] on the wings of the snow,
[1:54:29] I
[1:54:32] blessed his new
[1:54:35] sweet
[1:54:40] Oh
[1:54:45] my god.
[1:54:50] Jesus my savior.
[1:54:58] My name.
[1:55:02] He was born in a s
[1:55:08] in a manger of pain.
[1:55:15] Oh, he rejected
[1:55:22] from
[1:55:27] God gave us his son.
[1:55:33] On the wings of the
[1:55:39] on the wings of the snow.
[1:55:45] God is

[1:55:51] aside from
[1:56:03] Hallelujah.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; This is the house of praise. We just got
[1:56:10] a few more moments and things and we'll
[1:56:13] go these doors and this will just be a
[1:56:15] memory. Why don't we just give him all
[1:56:17] our hearts, worship him and thank him.
[1:56:20] Did you take it back? I took it back.
[1:56:23] Did you kick the ashes? I kicked the
[1:56:25] ashes. Have I encouraged myself? I have
[1:56:27] encouraged myself.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:34] Have you received something from God?
[1:56:37] Are you going to go home different than
[1:56:39] what you came in?
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Has the word has an effect on your life?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; He's not forgotten you.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; He's not forgotten you, church. He has
[1:56:58] not forgotten you.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; The Lord knew what we wanted and knew
[1:57:04] what we needed. Amen.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; And God send down the Holy Ghost this
[1:57:10] weekend.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And if you can receive it,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; God has done a miracle in your life.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; If you can receive it, you have received
[1:57:25] a miracle in your life.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, I'd like you to help me
[1:57:30] sing a song.
[1:57:33] I know you can, Derek.
[1:57:35] I know you're more than able to.
[1:57:39] But as brother Ron was ministering,
[1:57:44] he's talking about the praise. You need
[1:57:47] you need to water this now with praise.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You've asked God for something. Now we
[1:57:53] need to water it with praise. Psalm 34.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Psalm 34 says, "I'll bless the Lord at
[1:58:00] all times. His praise shall continually
[1:58:05] continually.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Continually.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And you wonder why preachers preach
[1:58:10] about the praise. It shall continually
[1:58:12] be in your mouth.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; My soul shall make her boast in the
[1:58:17] Lord. I want to boast in the Lord
[1:58:19] tonight that he's done great things
[1:58:21] within the church here at Cloverdale
[1:58:24] Bible Way. I'm not ashamed to identify
[1:58:27] myself. God's come down in this little
[1:58:29] church.
[1:58:31] I will boast myself in the Lord.
[1:58:34] He's done great things within our lives.
[1:58:38] Brother Brham said, "God will send the
[1:58:40] pastor will have a man come behind the
[1:58:42] pulpit because he knows exactly what the
[1:58:44] church needs." And God knew exactly what
[1:58:47] we need. And we should boast in the Lord
[1:58:50] tonight. We should say, "Praise his holy
[1:58:53] name.
[1:58:55] Take it back. Take your lost children
[1:58:57] back." Don't stand like a post. Express
[1:59:00] it out from your heart. Say, I claim
[1:59:02] them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:59:07] Oh, magnify the Lord with me. I sought
[1:59:10] the Lord and he heard me and he
[1:59:12] delivered me from all my fears. This
[1:59:16] poor man cried. Can you say, "This poor
[1:59:19] man cried. This poor woman cried this
[1:59:22] weekend. I sought the Lord and the Lord
[1:59:27] answered me." Let's just sing that to
[1:59:29] the Lord.
[1:59:39] I just I have to give glory to God.
[1:59:42] I was sitting in my seat and I thought
[1:59:44] somehow I need to share this and I had
[1:59:46] no idea I was going to be called but
[1:59:52] Friday
[1:59:55] Thursday I was driving my car and I
[1:59:56] turned on a message brother on exactly
[1:59:59] what you preached Friday night on David
[2:00:01] and Goliath was what brother Brandon was
[2:00:03] speaking I kneel down at my bed
[2:00:07] Thursday night before the meeting
[2:00:10] started
[2:00:11] Exactly what I prayed, Brother Ron
[2:00:13] preached on. Unknowing, I left my
[2:00:16] neighborhood to come to the service
[2:00:18] Friday. And I came the closest I've ever
[2:00:21] been to being killed as a man had stolen
[2:00:24] a truck and driven down the road, passed
[2:00:27] my car at about close to 100 miles an
[2:00:30] hour, missed my inches. I don't know how
[2:00:32] he missed me. And um I came, heard the
[2:00:37] word, and it was just for me.
[2:00:40] And this weekend,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; I I just I just know that
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; that that instance in that split second
[2:00:51] on Friday was Satan trying to stop me
[2:00:54] from coming here
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; and hearing this weekend.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; But just here to praise the Lord.
[2:01:11] the Lord
[2:01:14] and he answered me
[2:01:18] and delivered me
[2:01:22] from every fear.
[2:01:26] Those who look on him
[2:01:31] are radant.
[2:01:34] They'll never be ashamed.
[2:01:39] Never be ashamed.
[2:01:43] This poor man cried
[2:01:47] and the Lord hurt me
[2:01:51] and save me from
[2:01:56] my eneies. Praise the Lord. The son of
[2:02:01] God
[2:02:04] surrounds his saints.
[2:02:08] He will deliver them.
[2:02:12] He will deliver me.
[2:02:15] Oh, just magnify
[2:02:19] the Lord
[2:02:21] with me
[2:02:24] and come out
[2:02:27] his name
[2:02:30] together.
[2:02:42] on
[2:02:44] his name

[2:02:51] Oh, taste and see
[2:02:55] that the Lord is good.
[2:02:59] Oh, blessed is he
[2:03:03] who hides me.

[2:04:25] forever.

[2:04:34] every day.

[2:04:45] right.
[2:04:47] Let us bless the Lord
[2:04:51] every day night.

[2:06:19] me."
[2:06:22] And save me from,
[2:06:25] "Oh my
[2:06:30] son,

[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Glory. I got a song on my mind.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know what it is?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know what it is?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:34] Brother Spencer preached that same
[2:14:36] message.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; In Louisiana. I listened to it.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; And I wrote everything down.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And I talked it in my Bible. I said,
[2:14:44] "Take Satan, you take back all those
[2:14:47] diseases you put on me. I'm not having
[2:14:48] one of them
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; high blood pressure."
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I was at the doctor a week and a half
[2:14:54] ago. I told him I was getting dizzy,
[2:14:56] lightheaded when I stand up.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; He took my blood pressure and he said,
[2:15:00] "I know why. It's too low." M
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; and I've been on drugs for
[2:15:06] over 20 years for high blood pressure.
[2:15:09] He said it's way too low when you stand
[2:15:10] up.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; That's why you get faint.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; I wrote down diabetes.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; And uh he said to me,
[2:15:20] "Uh, do you know what your A1C was?" I
[2:15:22] said, "I haven't got a clue." He said,
[2:15:25] "It's it's seven." from 16 to up to 13
[2:15:30] 16 18. It's been for the last year and
[2:15:33] he's been threatening me. If you don't
[2:15:35] get that down, I'm going to put you on
[2:15:36] insulin.
[2:15:38] Your eyes are already
[2:15:41] damaged. One eye is already damaged. I
[2:15:43] have I had retina
[2:15:46] um what did you call it?
[2:15:48] Trouble. My retina tore and I my vision
[2:15:52] is awful. everything's crooked
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; because of the scar tissue that build up
[2:15:57] behind it, they can do nothing about it.
[2:15:59] And if you don't take care of that, your
[2:16:02] other eye will go. That's part of parcel
[2:16:05] of diabetes.
[2:16:07] Uh so I went and checked my and uh my
[2:16:10] eyes a week and a half ago and the do
[2:16:14] Dr. Anderson told me, "You're getting
[2:16:16] macular degeneration. There's a big
[2:16:18] yellow spot behind your eye
[2:16:21] and that's going to cause blindness. I
[2:16:24] had a checkup a week and a half ago. She
[2:16:26] said, "I can't find it. It's not there."
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:16:35] I I just wrote
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; I just wrote everything down.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; And tucked it in my Bible. I said, "God,
[2:16:44] you take care of this." And I tucked it
[2:16:45] in. I never thought about it. when he
[2:16:47] started preaching the same message
[2:16:48] tonight.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; I searched through my Bible and I found
[2:16:51] it and I showed my daughter-in-law that
[2:16:53] sat beside me, Rosie. I said, I wrote
[2:16:55] that down two months ago and I forgot
[2:16:57] about it. Now he's preaching that same
[2:16:59] message and I looked and I said, "Man,
[2:17:04] but the diabetic nerve pain in my feet
[2:17:06] is no longer there."
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; My my left foot was blue.
[2:17:11] That's the small capillaries uh get
[2:17:14] blocked up and uh that's when um the
[2:17:19] circulation your feet stops and you get
[2:17:20] gang green.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Now my son has a picture of the before.
[2:17:26] I have a picture of the after. It's not
[2:17:28] blue anymore.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:38] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:40] I have arthritis. I can't walk. I used
[2:17:43] to walk a lot. I can't walk anymore.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Now I've been going down on my treadmill
[2:17:47] and walking.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; My goodness, Lord. I I tucked this in my
[2:17:51] Bible and forgot about it.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; But it's all gone now.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I claimed the blood shed for me.
[2:18:02] Amen.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, I'm healed. Jesus paid
[2:18:04] for it all and healing is mine.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:08] You know, I left this out here.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; What'd you leave?
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; What have I uh I've been suffering from
[2:18:14] um colitis. That's what the doctors
[2:18:17] called. Uh colitis. Well, colitis is
[2:18:21] colitis. Couldn't do anything about it.
[2:18:22] I've been countless times going to the
[2:18:25] hospital cuz it got so bad. I had no
[2:18:28] strength to walk. Joe picked me up off
[2:18:30] the floor and took me to the hospital
[2:18:32] and checked me out. Uh the blood test
[2:18:35] showed I'm suffering from malnutrition
[2:18:37] because I'm not getting enough nutrients
[2:18:40] in my blood because
[2:18:42] well I have to say it. I had runs all
[2:18:44] the time.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; So it is I say it the way it is. You
[2:18:49] don't like it don't like it.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; It got so bad I no longer wanted to
[2:18:56] live. It was horrible.
[2:19:00] And I I finally I got the uh I was
[2:19:03] sitting in church there not long ago. My
[2:19:06] blood sugar was so high the doctor put
[2:19:07] me on a new drug
[2:19:10] called Jardians. Don't ever take it. Any
[2:19:12] of you that have diabetes, don't take
[2:19:14] it. It's made of the devil.
[2:19:17] And I told the doctor so too.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; It gave me such horrible blooded bladder
[2:19:22] infection. I sat there in the in the
[2:19:24] church in Wednesday night and I could
[2:19:26] feel that infection crawling up my
[2:19:29] kidneys. I was in such pain it took all
[2:19:32] I had not to groan out loud. I said when
[2:19:36] soon as brother Andy's is finished
[2:19:38] preaching, I'm going to go up there and
[2:19:40] cast that demon out. I can't live like
[2:19:42] this. This is horrible. I came up here
[2:19:44] and brother John and brother Murphy
[2:19:46] prayed for me. And I asked them to pray
[2:19:48] for that demon of colitis I've been
[2:19:50] suffering with for
[2:19:52] 15 years. M
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; as they prayed for me, I felt a deep
[2:19:58] comforting peace just flood my being.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I knew help was on the way. Like you
[2:20:04] said, when,
[2:20:07] how, where, I don't know that stuck when
[2:20:10] you said that one time,
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; uh, it stuck with me like an anchor, a a
[2:20:14] dart in there, and it never left me.
[2:20:16] He'll do it, but he'll do it. That was
[2:20:19] God is going to do it. He didn't say
[2:20:21] when, where, or how or how long it but
[2:20:23] he's going to do it. I when that piece
[2:20:26] I don't know how to explain it. It just
[2:20:28] flooded my being. I knew help was on the
[2:20:31] way.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; And uh I've been waiting for a doctor's
[2:20:35] appointment, a specialist for the bowel
[2:20:37] for six months.
[2:20:40] And uh a week later uh brother Andy's
[2:20:44] asked me out in the hallway, "How are
[2:20:46] you, sister?" I said, "All is well. I
[2:20:49] help is I'm going to get healed and I'm
[2:20:51] going to see the specialist in a couple
[2:20:53] of days. If I don't get healed, I'm a
[2:20:56] hypocrite. That's not what I wanted to
[2:20:58] say. I wanted to say I'm unbeliever. But
[2:21:00] that's what came out.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Two days later, I went to the doctor to
[2:21:03] the specialist
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; and she had all my records there on the
[2:21:07] computer. How many times I've gone to
[2:21:09] the hospital and whatever.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; You know, your life is exposed.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; She knew everything. I couldn't tell her
[2:21:16] nothing different. She knew and she
[2:21:19] said, "Your tests have all the tests
[2:21:20] they've done on you for um gluten
[2:21:23] intolerance. They're all negative. You
[2:21:25] don't have gluten intolerance, but I am
[2:21:27] 100% sure
[2:21:30] you have um you're allergic to wheat.
[2:21:34] Not wheat per se, but that genetically
[2:21:38] modified wheat we eat now is what's
[2:21:40] causing your problem. I'm 100% sure.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; So, I'll take you off wheat. I'll give
[2:21:45] you I'll do nothing else but take you
[2:21:47] off wheat. Don't eat any wheat. Just um
[2:21:51] switch to spelt. Well, I did and in one
[2:21:55] day this was cut off.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; I didn't realize it at that time that
[2:21:59] that was a miracle. She said to me in 6
[2:22:02] weeks time to 3 months you should notice
[2:22:04] a difference
[2:22:06] and you'll come back in three months and
[2:22:07] if if wheat is not the culprit then it
[2:22:09] we'll check dairy.
[2:22:11] But this was stopped in one day.
[2:22:14] And as I've been going for my stuff for
[2:22:17] spelt and stuff like that, I run into a
[2:22:19] lot of people and they all tell me it
[2:22:21] took them literally months
[2:22:24] for the system to clear everything out.
[2:22:26] Then I begin to realize this is a
[2:22:29] miracle to me. It was wiped off in one
[2:22:31] day. This is unusual. Just one day it
[2:22:34] wasn't there anymore.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve. Isn't he
[2:22:38] amazing?
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; I need to share this with you. There's
[2:22:41] some people here that have the same
[2:22:42] problem. Maybe I had to go through all
[2:22:45] this for one person and so be it. Lord,
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; well, so be it. Eh, brother Bisley once
[2:22:52] said to me, I have a struggle coming up
[2:22:53] here for prayer. You know, we all have
[2:22:55] that in sitting on our shoulder. He
[2:22:57] fights me. He fights me. He said, you're
[2:22:59] a pest. You're always up there. You doh
[2:23:02] and I and I struggle. Brother Briscoll
[2:23:04] said to me one time, I I said to him,
[2:23:07] I'm so ashamed of coming up here for
[2:23:08] prayer all the time. Um, it's
[2:23:11] embarrassing. He said, "No, sister."
[2:23:14] I said, "I get I get over one thing and
[2:23:16] the devil is right there with something
[2:23:18] else. I'm I'm literally ashamed of
[2:23:20] myself." She said, "Well, sister, I'll
[2:23:23] never forget that." The devil knows that
[2:23:26] you're grounded and solid. He can't get
[2:23:28] you that way. So, he attacks your body.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's been doing. But
[2:23:33] he's defeated. I didn't even realize it,
[2:23:36] Brother Tom, until he said I he was
[2:23:38] going to take preach this say, and take
[2:23:40] it back. I looked in my Bible and I
[2:23:42] looked at all those things. Good Lord,
[2:23:44] all has happened and I didn't even
[2:23:46] realize it.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; You know, we have we serve an amazing
[2:23:55] God.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you for who you are. Lord,
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Like one doctor told you years ago, why
[2:24:06] do you come to us, Eileene?
[2:24:09] You're a tremendous testimony.
[2:24:12] Do you know
[2:24:16] know what it is not to have
[2:24:23] to wonder?
[2:24:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:24:50] Heat. Heat.
[2:25:00] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:25:10] Heat. Heat.
[2:25:21] Heat.
[2:25:24] Heat.

[2:25:45] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:25:55] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:05] Heat. Heat.

[2:26:37] the water.
[2:26:40] Yes, I
[2:27:05] don't come. Yes, sir.
[2:27:08] Amen. Has it been good?
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Young people, a part of your worship, as
[2:27:13] we said at the beginning of the service,
[2:27:15] part of your worship is giving. And if
[2:27:18] you feel to give the man of God an
[2:27:20] offering tonight, don't remember, don't
[2:27:22] forget the back tithe box. God bless
[2:27:25] you. Brother Mark, why don't you come
[2:27:27] and close us in a word of prayer.
[2:27:35] Am
[2:27:37] I
[2:27:41] all right? Let's bow our heads.
[2:27:44] Oh, dear and gracious heavenly father,
[2:27:48] I just understand in this moment that
[2:27:50] this is not the end. Though it might be
[2:27:53] the end of the service, Lord, it's just
[2:27:56] the beginning of all the new things that
[2:27:58] you've begun here. It's the beginning of
[2:28:00] a new year. It's a new start in many
[2:28:03] lives. It's a new start in my life,
[2:28:05] Lord.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Every day is new with you. And I feel
[2:28:09] like, Lord, you've just raised our
[2:28:11] expectations in a big way in these
[2:28:13] services, Lord.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you just clench those things
[2:28:17] in our heart?
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let it fly away. Clench them in
[2:28:21] our heart that we can go forth tomorrow,
[2:28:24] the next day, the next week. Build on
[2:28:27] what has happened here, Lord. Trusting
[2:28:30] that what you begin, Lord, you finish.
[2:28:33] Your promises are true. Every promise in
[2:28:35] the book is true. And you are a God who
[2:28:38] finishes what you start.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, we submit ourselves before you. We
[2:28:42] submit ourselves to the word, to the
[2:28:45] wisdom of the word, to the discernment
[2:28:47] that's come upon us here. We submit to
[2:28:49] that. We humble ourselves, Lord. And
[2:28:52] Lord, thy will be done. I ask a blessing
[2:28:55] on each person. Pour a blessing back
[2:28:57] into Brother Ron for his labors here
[2:28:59] today.
[2:29:01] how we love him and how we appreciate
[2:29:02] the gift of God. Go with us now. We ask
[2:29:05] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you. Amen. Well,
[2:29:10] now we got to go. I hate it. I just hate
[2:29:14] this part because it just seems to just,
[2:29:18] you know, get busyness of life. Well, I
[2:29:21] got to prove
[2:29:31] The power of the blood. You're
[2:29:35] dismissing. If you want to stay in
[2:29:36] worship, you stay in worship. God bless
[2:29:40] you.
[2:29:44] God show
[2:29:47] that this world isn't worthy of Oh, it's
[2:29:51] a challenge.
[2:29:53] It's a challenge to accept.
[2:29:57] It's a faith rising to
[2:30:01] it's a way that I can show
[2:30:05] that Jesus Christ is true. Oh, it's a
[2:30:09] life
[2:30:11] a
[2:30:20] standing test.
[2:30:28] I'm fighting
[2:30:32] and I got to show
[2:30:34] the power of
[2:30:39] and I got to prove I'm not like those.
[2:30:46] I've got to show that I'm
[2:30:50] the world.
[2:30:53] We are the ones for surviving
[2:31:14] falling away Oh
[2:31:19] my
[2:31:35] god.
[2:31:46] from s
[2:31:54] world.
[2:31:59] We are the ones who are going to stand
[2:32:02] and keep our testimony clean
[2:32:07] in the midst of an unbelieving
[2:32:10] world.
[2:32:12] You did not see
[2:32:14] to really know
[2:32:17] that we
[2:32:22] see.
[2:32:24] Here we go.
