bless you all this morning morning jubilee morning tomorrow morning jubilee morning we're gonna have church this morning i'm looking forward to what the lord's gonna do i just wanted to read a scripture before we sang this song um it's psalms 27. the bible says here the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life and whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell and though in host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock so as we sing this just remember the lord is our light and our salvation [Music] [Music] the lord is my light and salvation whom shall i fear [Music] the lord is the strength of my life i will not be afraid when mine enemies came against me they stumbled and fell [Music] my heart will not feed rise against me in you i will put my trust [Music] [Music] the lord is my light and salvation whom shall i see the lord is my enemies came against me they stumbled and fell through [Music] for you are [Music] with you [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] me [Music] there's no mountain there's no mountain there's no [Music] there's no darkness there's no darkness there's no darkness that you cannot break [Music] [Music] that you cannot trash [Music] there's no no sickness [Music] [Music] there's [Music] [Music] there's no child that god cannot save [Music] there's no need [Music] [Music] [Music] way [Music] set [Music] [Music] there's [Music] that god [Music] [Applause] are my life [Music] rise against me in you i will put my trust for you always [Music] [Music] for you are with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow [Applause] amen as war rose against us has the devil tried to come against you and me but has he stumbled and fell because greater is he that is within i say man than he that is within the world we could keep worshiping and worshiping i i can only imagine but we're going to give the time for the word this morning amen to brother timothy you're welcome to come out this morning when you're we're ready so when you're ready you're welcome to come but amen i'm just uh i'm just drinking it in today i was thinking last night i said lord we're just desiring just an encounter with you today this weekend you know people i'm gonna go back this might sound a little bit weird but i had to go to i went to film school for a little bit numero numerous years ago and there's there's some old old films called close encounters you know people desire a close encounter with the supernatural this is the world okay the world they're designed they're so there's such a a huge you know movement for for all these fantasy or these different encounters with the with this other world and they're crying for they're trying to portray it but there's a people there's a people that has a not just a close encounter but it's part of us for we are of another world amen and so i prayed this afternoon this morning this weekend you say lord i need an encounter with you this is a jubilee weekend and it's not the world that's looking for a counter but would you come and have a supernatural moment with me this morning as brother david said last night but wait for tomorrow night don't wait for tomorrow morning this morning this morning i need an encounter with god amen we pulled for it i've waited months for it say now is my

there is a place oh yes i am [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i'm just thankful to be a child of god amen there's nothing like being his child and being under his protection and his grace amen if you have a need you want to make known to the lord you can just lift your hand today and let's just go to him in prayer before we start here this morning father lord what an honor it is to be in this moment lord in this atmosphere of your presence lord just knowing lord that you're doing great things among us healings are taking place deliverances are taking place lord we see you're calling those prodigals home and moving upon impossible situations father that lord beyond what we could even think or ask sometimes lord you move and you change and god we're so grateful we commit our hearts to you lord today in this thought today father we asked the lord that you would speak and you would touch and you would minister as only you can do father i cannot do this on my own it's impossible lord but i know father that i have you this morning you're the speaker lord but lord not only be the speaker but be the hearer also father may there be just a connection to the throne we pray we ask it in your name for your glory amen amen amen like to say it's a quite an honor to be here today with you and we love you with the love of the lord and amen we're glad to be here with uh my father brother tim and but we bring you greetings from our home assembly and our church and and from my my personal my personal family my wife and and children would love to be here as well but amen they said to be sure and give their greetings and and uh it's just an honor it's always good to be with god's children amen as you know we've been through quite a difficult year uh with the loss of my mother and things and we want to thank you for every prayer that was prayed and and uh for uh amen sending brother tom to be with us and i know but they hadn't expressed his heartfelt thoughts of wanting to be there and we appreciate that and amen it's just wonderful to know that in times that you go through difficult times you have others around you it's really an unseen host that are praying for you and calling upon the lord for you and we're thankful for every prayer every thought every card everything and this morning i i just want you to know you're not hearing or even in the morning you're not hearing from a grieving preacher amen we we we know where she's at and we're confident in that and as believers we're believers and that's what believers do and we're pressing forward to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus amen so amen it's an honor to be here as i said with this 50th you know we as a we as a church as well as our this is our 50th anniversary as well in our church so amen we have something in common with each other more than just amen things but it's the time it's amazing how god's time works and it's perfect amen and so we just went through that with our church and and we know where you're at today and it's it's it's quite a testimony that through many trials many heartaches many things a lot of water on the bridge we're still here amen we still remain and we're thankful for that amen god bless you today let's turn to psalms 40 and verse 1 and also isaiah 61 and verse 1. i actually had a different thought as i was thinking about this meeting to minister this morning but yesterday things began to change very rapidly and so as we saw the direction last night was well thank you lord thank you lord so really if you want to you can just title this part too amen amen we'd like to sing or preach to you on us on the title a new song to sing a new song to sing the lord would actually give me those words in a very difficult moment as i was sit there on the pew there at my mother's memorial and he gave me this words and and i began to think about them and and what they meant and i realized you know my song was not a song of weariness or or grieving or hurt or pain my song was a song of the redeemed and god has it all in control amen and so we're going to bring from that today psalms 40 and verse 1 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the mirey clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord also isaiah 61 and verse 1 says the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are abound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord or we know that's the jubilee year i was looking at it again today in the amplified it says or the year of god's favor highly favored favor is approval support and love oh my what a year to be in and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified what is this of all about this jubilee here that he might be glorified amen god bless you today you can be seated you know we've i don't know if you know about it but we've been through quite a few a couple of difficult years amen this covet and things and we saw very quickly how our lives could change we saw very quickly how governments can shut things down and things can take place and and even beyond what we could ever could imagine could take place and and i'm not going to get into all the politics of that but you know in this moment we find that many became very heavy or it was a spirit of heaviness that's beginning to settle upon the people you know and i in the last couple of years and and even even as it led up to that i i began to realize there was more young people than i'd ever seen or could thought imaginable that would come up and ask for prayer for suicide and have sueth outside thoughts and things you know and brother braddon would talk about this and back in 56 he said many are becoming discouraged you know when we become discouraged it takes our strength from us and we want to just give up and we want to just just lay it all aside and say i'm done you know i'm going to discourage satan likes to pull us away and and make us think that nobody else cares and nobody understands and and and you know to bring us into this you know this new word that we learn social distancing and and so and thoughts begin to run rampant and thoughts of unworthiness and never going to make it or it's too much to handle and heaviness is this great weight that sets down upon us and seems to squeeze the life out of us amen more people than ever is dealing with anxiety and fears and depression and discouragement that is set in and what is it is darkness that is closing in but he would finish that he said there's many that are becoming discouraged he said but what we need to do is to take courage we need to be encouraged trials may come we're never been promised to be immune from them but he said he would give us the grace to go through them amen if the mountain is too high or too deep or too wide he'll give us the grace to go through it he said just don't worry about it keep your eyes on christ it's a very important time key in the time we're living in is to keep your eyes on christ he is the only one that can take you through but you notice when the devil begins to discourage you and you get in a moment of discouragement he tries to pour it on you you know he tries to that's when he tries to really get to you you know all these thoughts so you'll never overcome you're you'll never make it through this battle you'll never get ahead you'll never get better cast all of that aside amen brother man we'll say it like this he don't god doesn't want you frowning god wants you happy he says the human heart is to be made happy worry causes cancer temper causes cancer don't ever be upset just walk walking his love knowing that if you're walking with him nothing can harm you wow that's something rejoicing right there because i'm not in this alone because he promised he would never leave me or forsake me but he would be with me even in me to the end of the world so i'm not going through covet alone i'm not going through laodicea alone i'm not in this battle alone he is with me [Applause] amen if he's with me who can be against me no weapon formed against you shall prosper amen when you've got confidence in the one that's walking with you amen he's one that won't make you may have a best friend that's left you you may have somebody that said a lot of ugly words about you but this god will never leave you this god will never turn from you he'll be with you in the trial he'll be with you on the mountain he'll be with you in the valley he'll be with you every day of your life he'll be with you in cancer he'll be with you in sugar diabetes he'll walk with you in blindness he'll walk with you through every trial of life he promised he would and he has never failed one time and if you're walking with him nothing can harm you there's neither powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we are in him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah we have never come by our own will listen we're not sitting here this morning because we had a thought i want to be there i i wanted we came by his will amen the light of god the pillar of fire has led you to where you are are we followers of the pillar of fire in the pillar of fire didn't leave 50 years ago it's still just as prevalent today as it ever was and it's still leading people through trials it's still leading them to the holy ghost it's still leading them through the dark waters it's still leading us through the darkness of laodicea this pillar of fire is still in the church of the living god [Applause] hallelujah amen i saw a t-shirt or some kind of cartoon one time of this man that's a little dorky looking sheep you know he's walking on his back hooves we know they walk on four legs but it's a cartoon bear with me and he's got his little clothing hooves and he's walking down this pathway and he's holding the hands of jesus and they're walking down this little pathway and over in the ditch over there's this old toothless line and he's roaring out i'm going to get you and this sheep is looking at that line with a smile on his face and he's replying i'm with him amen maybe you've heard the lines roar and he's been after you and he's been on your maybe the hounds of hell have been after you but don't forget who you're with you need to look at that devil and say it ain't just me here boy i'm with the king of kings i'm with the lord of lords i'm with god walking in human flesh nothing can harm you he's elected us he's brought us to this place so if he's brought us here and there listen to the prophet's word if he's brought us here it's his business to take care of us it's not the government's business it's god's business amen i'm not here because of some government official elected me to be here i'm here because god elected me to be here and god has put himself into my business he's in your business that's somebody you want in your business you might not want the next person sitting to you by you and your business but you want god in your business [Applause] who's got more power than god he said no man can pluck these from my hand [Music] take that devil it's the father who ta who's got more power than god what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you well let me tell you the kind of power the same power that still puts the sun up there [Applause] i understand you don't get to see the sun much but you saw it the last couple of days it's still there you can come to a long winter time and it's still there you can go through a cloudy day after a cloudy day after cloudy day it's still there why is it still there because the word says let there be light and darkness is trying to put it out and clouds are trying to cover it but it's still there [Applause] and i want to tell every critic you tried to cover amen the power of god is still here you're trying to bring it down it's still here the sound is still out [Applause] [Music] but oh how god loves the tester's people huh every child that comes to god must be tested child trained no exceptions tonight maybe you're sick just a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged god is still on the throne he still has all things in control he still is in control he said if you were are truly born of the spirit of god how many is truly born in the spirit of god then everything is working together for your good he didn't say every good thing is going to work for your good he said everything will work for your good covert has worked for our good i've seen more people now and these these times that we're living in more anxious and more desiring to be in the presence of god than i've ever seen why because they realize what it was about or how it was not to have it and how important it was he said see everything's working toward according for your good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's going to keep that word he that's kept it now for thousands of years to every believer and brother let him ask this question why would you be an exception why would you be an exception we are no exception he who kept abraham will keep you he who kept moses will keep you he who kept shamgar will keep you he who kept david daniel the three hebrew children will keep you he who kept peter and paul and the martyrs down to the dark ages will keep you he who kept william branham will keep you he who kept ed bischo will keep you you are no exception [Applause] the devil wants to make you think you are but you're not so here's another one don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour this is 58. a lot of people in this days you know that was kind of the golden era to live in those days but we're living in a terrible hour a terrible terrible hour and i'm not to be discouraged a terrible hour and bad times and situation and you mean to tell me i'm not to be discouraged let me finish the quote we're living in a terrible hour a terrible hour for the unbeliever we are near the end [Applause] [Music] and we're looking for the coming of our blessed lord jesus christ i've used this before but amen you know the bible says in ii timothy i believe it is the last days perilous times shall come and we see it sodom and gomorrah we see all those prophecies lovers of their own self all the things that he lists there tear past the last days perilous times shall come we get all nervous and we get all upset and we think well how's this going to work out how that's going to be when is this going to take place i want to ask you something the last day's for who it ain't my last days amen if you'll read it right it's the last day it's the last days for cancer it's the last day for sugar diabetes it's the last day for blindness it's the last day for depression and anxiety and fear but it's not my last days i'm just about to step into eternity and i ask you when you get on the other side and you're shouting on the hills of glory where's all those trials gonna be where all those devils gonna be where's that cancer gonna be where's that problem gonna be it's gonna be gone [Applause] we get tore up worried about the last days and we're not at our last days we're just beginning i don't know about you but i'm just ready to get the party started amen i want to bring us back to something in samuel 30 and verse 1. it came to pass when david and his men were come to zig lag on the third day and the amalekites invaded the south and ziglag and smit and ziglag and burned it with fire and taking the woman captive and they all that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them all away and went on their way and david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then david and his people that were with him lifted up their voices and wept and under them they had until they had no more power to weep that's quite a that's quite a time of crying and david's two wives were taken captive as well and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stone in him because the soul of all the men were grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god amen and david said to abbathar the priest the himalayan son i pray thee bring hither the ephod and abbathar brought them the ephod to david and david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this truth shall i overtake them and he answered them pursue and thou shalt overtake them and without fail recover all [Applause] without fail recover all it sounds like moses i'm not leaving a behind we're in another exodus we ought to have to say i'm not leaving my child behind i'm not leaving my sons and my daughters we're not leaving our god-given gifts behind [Music] david and his band of soldiers had just returned home discouraged probably not a big enough word for their state of morale the bible says they wept as we read bitter tears until they simply had no power and even worse for david he was their leader and they started turning on david that's how that's how it works instead of turning on the enemy they start turning on their leader and make him out to be the enemy when he was never the enemy amen but david turned and encouraged himself in the lord his god it required a definite resolve in david's heart he had a decision to make am i going to go deeper into distress and depression will i worry more will i allow it to make me more helpless or would he make a conscious decision i'm going to turn my my eyes away from what's going on and i'm going to turn them to the hills which cometh my help david chose encouragement not to just be encouraged for there was no one around there that could or would encourage him he couldn't even courage himself he had to turn to the lord his god you see what david knows that this wasn't just about david david had a covenant with god and what and having that covenant with god it made what david was going through god's business after encouraging himself david was then able to move amen from the on to the solution that god had probably had provided see you'll never get to the solution of your problem unless you get your focus off your problem and get it on your god [Applause] amen discouragement does not come from the lord it comes from our adversary the devil that's why david could encourage himself in the lord because the lord was the source of his solution not the source of his problem but how quickly the devil wants to turn it and say god did you this way anxiety fretting worrying discouragement it indicates we're walking by sight and not by faith we're walking about what we can see instead of looking to the unseen let me let me read a few quotes here and discernment some there's tons of these go look them up crossing bridges worrying about things you ain't got no business to be look that up he said let us say praise be to god oh my this is what we need this is the time is this the patient how to do sister you're an awful deep thinker got a weary spirit always worried about things you've got no business to be worried about whoa that's going to the doctor ain't it yeah that's what the doctor said we'll just take this and take that now you what's your problem let's get to the problem amen see medicine sometimes just covers the symptoms that really don't deal with the problem god wants to deal with the problem and the symptoms will go away amen see you're always worried about things you got no business to be you're nervous upset and it's caused you to have acid in your blood which give you arthritis the devil did me this way no that she did that to herself she allowed things to become greater than what they really were she began crossing bridges before she ever got there now now i understand this is she but there's a bunch of hees too brothers we'd cross a lot of bridges how many has ever had something with another brother and you're going to go talk to him and you're going to talk to him about it and you begin to build this thing in your mind i'm going to say this and he's going to say that oh he better not say that man if he does i'm going to bring this out and then when i do that he's going to do that and you go there and you begin to talk to him and he don't even know what you're talking about crossing bridges discouragement nervousness he said come lady you're a very deep thinker you're sincere with all your heart but it's caused you to be a nervous person you're very nervous you're always taking other people's things and thinking about that crossing bridges before you get to it building things that never happen anyway in that it's developed a stomach trouble for you but paul said we want or to walk by faith and not by sight [Applause] amen that was his source of strength and source of stability amen when we walk by faith we're putting our confidence in the lord we're putting our confidence in his promises but when we walk by sight we trust in what our senses say what our feelings say what our understandings say and then we begin to fall easily pray to misunderstandings and the world the deceptions and the flesh and the devil when we find ourselves in discouragement we find where we've been placing our trust the answer is that you don't have to stay there hallelujah the answer is put your trust back in the lord when discouragement comes you find you've been walking by faith or by sight instead of faith head back to the word head back to what he said and begin to build your faith back up your strength god god wants you to be encouraged so if he wants you to be encouraged he has to give you the means to be encouraged by recognize first you don't have to stay discouraged some people like that they worship that discouragement spirit and they want to tell you why they're discouraged and 100 reasons why and this and that and they've got to list a mile long you don't have to stay there anybody you know brother i'm talking about a bird that flies over your head you can't keep that from happening but you sure make him quit building a nest in there but how many people have you saw them spiritually man they'd have twigs sticking out they'd have mud all over their hair or they may be fixed up and dolled up and their hair just right and we got the newest haircut but if you could look spiritually they got all kind of nonsense wadded up i can't even hardly walk through the doors because it's piled so high and they wonder why i ain't got nothing from god hey man bear with me we're going somewhere you can be encouraged but you have to encourage yourself in the lord [Applause] there's always going to be somebody that does something wrong there's always going to be somebody that makes a mistake whether it be a deacon trustee leader it don't my pastor it doesn't matter we're all human but the problem is the devil wants you to get your eyes off of your humanity and magnify their humanity [Applause] so when the circumstances of life present the david david turned and pressed into his benefits [Music] he gave an outline of our benefits in psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgive all iniquities who heals all diseases who redeemed your life from destruction who crowns you oh if you can get the mud out of your hair and get all this stuff out god wants to crown you with loving kindness tend to mercies who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles so you have to stop giving voice to your discouragement and start giving voice to your encouragement [Applause] stop repeating the lies of the devil and start speaking the promises of god [Applause] stop speaking out of fear and start speaking in faith stop talking about the problem and start talking about the promises [Applause] but the devil wants to put something on you that's not you amen he wants to place a name on you to cause you to sing his tune you know i thought it was interesting i was looking at this this morning nebuchadnezzar was the king of babylon and and he was you know we know the story daniel and the three hebrew children were taken down there had an eye michelle and azariah how many ever says those names when you say the three hebrew children chad wrack me shaq and abednego all four of these hebrews names had meanings of a and that meaning was a connected to the faith in god but upon their arrival into babylon their names were changed and daniel became belt of shazaar and had an eye of shadrach and michelle meshach and azariah abednego the boy's names were changed as a way of encouraging them to forget their god and the traditions of their homeland and be conformed to the ways and gods of babylon it was a forced assimilation this is where it's going to be you're going to take these names and they're going to conform to these names and what these names mean now david daniel and his friends were given names a bendigo meant sir a servant of nebo and belter chaz armen bell protects my life the meaning of the name daniel is god is my judge referring to elohim one of the names of the gods of israel amen azariah and hannah and i carry the suffix which is short for yahweh it is the covenant name of god see the devil wants to place a name on you so you'll sing his song so he places discouragement so you'll sing the song of discouragement he places anxiety upon your depression and you'll begin to sing that song out of your life oh yeah yeah it happens amen when songs of joy should be coming out and songs of happiness and songs of zion and songs of revelation and songs of our position and songs of our promises we're singing other songs he's changed our identity by changing who we are changing what's upon us so you come to the house of god and you start saying i'm depressed i'm depressed every day that i live i'm depressed when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i'm depressed i'm depressed i am mad i am mad i want everybody in this church to know i'm mad [Applause] when i walk through the doors and i sit in my pew i want everybody in this church to know i'm not happy i'm mad and i'm not i'm about to leave you know the time we're living in google has made it where you can you can very quickly move and you can find out what little ache you got it's not really a good place to look and before you know it you'll be saying i am bound for the nursing home i am down for the nursing home oh who will come and see me it's changing your soul it's changing everything about you he wants to place the name of depression on you and bitterness upon you well we went through this troubling church and we had this situation and i'm just bitter about it you don't have to stay there amen he's trying to make you move into the realms of that and begin to sing those songs out of your life sing songs of unworthiness but instead of singing that you ought to be singing the song of the redeemed amen instead of singing songs of unforgiveness you ought to be singing i can forgive i can't let it go hey while we're here why you know the forgiveness that you give is the forgiveness you'll receive he said father forgive them and forgive us as we forgive our debtors as we forgive our debtors so the forgiveness you give is the forgiveness you're going to receive when you get in a battle though it's easy it's easy to forget it's easy to forget to praise him you know our lives will be a praise offering unto him but then we become murmurs and complainers and i promise you i'm getting to the good stuff just hang on with me how quickly in the journey of the children of israel it turned from rejoicing and praising hallelujah hallelujah he set me free he set me free to complaining and murmuring and aggravated and not happy they forgot what god had done for them and he said that brother baby like they said people forget very quickly what god does for them in a meeting they forget of how he set them free or what he done them at a high school meeting or whatever our campaign if they forget all about it what god did they just forget it and they begin to murmur our souls loathed at this light bread and they left the garlics and onions of egypt and were eating angel's food complaining they left all of those things of the other people that didn't believe in divine healing and walking with the healer read the scriptures their souls didn't even wear out their clothes didn't even wear out he provided for him every step of the way what if he did it in that exodus don't you know he's going to do it in our exodus he hasn't got to lay over the sea and run out of power and run out of abilities and run out of creative power he's just as powerful today as he ever was amen he still takes care of his children just like he ever did here they were drinking brother babysitting from the stagnated pools of egypt and the old bloody nasty nile and drinking from the rock and complaining and murmuring and mad mercy complaining always murmuring left the garlic plots left the boasting physicians left the stale waters of egypt the days of miracles have passed to be where miracles were taking place and still complaining you know i i i'm not as old as i can be but i'm not as young as i used to be i'm halfway to 90. you start feeling things you didn't feel before like man what's going on what has happened how did i get here and i know these young guys like ha ha you'll be here lord terry's you're coming right along brother brandon would say when he come down he said in 63 he's just a couple of years from his passing over he said god give me grace to never complain amen grant that my life will be crowned no matter if we suffer whatever takes place however many turns against me i know this one thing in my life as i get older friends the stream behind me will soon be running out narrow and narrow as i go down the road and i know one thing it'll come to pass after a while there'll be nobody come to me and ask for advice the ones who knew me in my younger days will be going on if i shall live my friends will get fewer and fewer as i get older now i know that someday i'll go to i got to die and i hope that god never let satan crown me as an old crabit indifferent man and my wife an old nagging woman or your wife or you that way i pray brother that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit joy love long suffering gentleness patience true faith in the holy ghost he said i try not to say too much only about it you know people complaining because i think one of the horrible sayings i see a man or woman that's constantly complaining he said well i want a revival you're supposed to be preaching a revival stop complaining start rejoicing amen he said god keep me from it he said because it weakens faith i know as long as i get older each one of us we're going to get something now something's going to happen i know little things are going to keep accumulating as we get older i think one of the most horrible things is in life is for satan to crown some person's life a crabbing old man or a woman you say i hope that i don't ever get to that place i hope i can bear it my burdens i want my life to be crowned with the glory of god i want my life to be crowned with the glory of god [Music] you know in the southern u.s maybe other elsewhere maybe you have it here we have a saiyan that goes like this as i bet he's singing a different tune now it's a context that somebody has had a radical event or a life-changing experience and because of this he acts different because of this life-altering event he can no longer sing the same song because it simply don't apply perhaps this is a new song and a way of saying i have had a life-changing experience with the creator of the entire universe so i can never never never remain the same i will sing a new song cause my life has been changed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen i prayed in this meeting that you'll take another step forward listen we're not going backwards we're not going behind we're going forward we're going forward we're going to have better meetings we're going to have greater you say well what do you expect after these times we've been through i expect more healings i expect more deliverances i expect more god to come on the scene and set captives free i expect more holy ghosts i expect more power than god i expect more to see the pillar of eyes i don't come to church expecting less i come expecting more give me another drink i want another pie i want what you have gone hallelujah in this meeting god is about to give you a new song you've been depressed you've been anxiety you've been in fear it's lasted long enough what you need to say is i'm not gonna spend five more minutes with the devil and i'm throwing my hoe down i don't see the song his righteousness and his joy and his holiness and his happiness i will no longer sing the songs of slavery because i'm no longer a slave [Applause] i've had a life-changing experience you can never come into the pillar of fire into his presence and remain the same god changed the name of abram to abraham he changed sarah to sarah he put a part of himself in their name it was the h it was the breath [Applause] this is what he's wanting to do for you maybe you've been barren maybe your womb's been dead and you haven't been able to give life to the messiah inside of you listen i ain't talking about just a natural born baby right now i'm talking about the life of jesus christ god is going to come and breathe on somebody and say let me put my heart in you let me put my breath in here let me put my life in you maybe you've been like jacob you've been in a supplanter you've been a deceiver you've had bad business deals you've done all kinds of things wrong but god wants to come to you and you can have a moment with the angel and he can wrestle it out with you and i tell you when you get a hold of that angel you won't walk away the same what happened to you jacob i'm not jacob no more my name is israel i'm not surprised no more i'm not deceiver no more that's who i used to be but that old man has died i cross the river and i'm on the other side and i'm now a prince with god [Applause] [Music] the devil wants to come say well you're depressed you're lost you're never going to make it your name is anxiety and fear and every kind of name of demon you want to know what you need to do is look back to him and say no that's not my name that's your name that's who you are that's not who i am i am a prince with god [Applause] he wants to put thoughts in your mind you're never going to make it you're not ever going to be good enough you're unworthy you're a liar you're a deceiver brother branham would use that it get asked a question he said how do we know if it's our thoughts or how do we know this he said if it's not the word of god it's the devil's thinking so i've read the bible i hadn't seen where he called me a liar where he called me i wasn't going to make it what he said so these are the devil's thoughts so let's hear what the devil's thinking this morning satan has got up this morning maybe fixed him something to eat or whatever down in his kingdom and his thoughts are going through his mind you'll never be worthy enough you're never going to make it you'll never be redeemed you'll never be there you'll never experience eternity you'll never experience the greatness of god these are his faults [Applause] but he's trying to say they're yours but these are the things that's antagonizing him and tormenting him saul brother branham said well maybe it was a good name for a king one time but it didn't fit an apostle so he met the pillar of fire and from that time his name was changed paul abraham was abram there's an ordinary man but one day he met god and from that time he was changed forever he believed something that he could not see he met god and he was changed moses amen met god on the backside of the desert and from that time he was a changed man his song was different he was back there singing the song of running and hiding and song of i'll never be anybody i don't care what my mama said it's impossible now i don't run my chance it's over with and all of a sudden he's walking down tending some sheep and he said what what is that that's that's odd that's a light no bush is on fire but it's not burning let me go check that out he walks up there and a voice speaks and he calls him by name moses now if the devil would have called him he'd say deceiver worthless you runner of god's plan but god spoke to him and called him by his name moses moses where what are you doing take off your shoes you're on holy ground and we know what happened he took from that moment he went got his wife and his donkey and his child and his rod and he went off to egypt that's quite a different song well you're now a song asking what are you doing moses i'm going down to egypt to take over i'm going to take back what is mine what is god's inheritance he's had him too long his time is over with [Applause] this is where david was i'm going back i'm inquired of the lord and he said go and take it back and you shall recover all hallelujah i'm looking at a people that's going to recover all the joy all the happiness all the holy ghost all the power of god [Applause] can i tell you tell your testimony very personal it was last june and my uh my time with my mom's slipping away and and and going downhill very quickly i have time to go into all the details but i felt in my heart it was my amen one thing was me and my wife's 25th anniversary and and uh i was supposed to preach at brother josh bennett's and then brother ron invited me to come the weekend before and so that i'd spend the week in between um do a go on our anniversary and so i i we we see my mom slipping and slipping and slipping in and out of the hospital and things were going on and we're wondering you know do i go don't i go what i do what did not do and i was talking to brother tim about it he said well i feel we're at a red sea moment we're either going to turn around or we're going to speak and go forward so we spoke and went forward and as i'm taking off from shreveport my mom's going back in the hospital and you know in mind battles and things yeah lots of them but i felt the urgency i got to be at brother ron's things are this i just got to be there so i'm there brother ron's we're ministering and on sunday morning i'm ministering on the god that answers and brother branham said god always answers he said but he answers many times in an unexpected place an unexpected time and unexpected way he said but you have to recognize it to be god and so i'm preaching along and preaching i got down to the part where the three hebrew children were being talked about to be thrown in the fire and i walk around brother ron's got a little round place in front of his pulpit and i walk around and i'm speaking about it and i said you know as they're being thrown into the fire and i'm beginning to just tell her how brother branham did about jesus and the angels looking or god and angel's looking over and uh he's telling about it and wormwood and gabriel and all those things and he said but god said this this this is you've been good angels but this is a job for me said to grab the east wind the west wind and zigzag a light and into the fire you went and i've been standing out here my my ipad is went black and i'm just speaking about these things and as i was beginning to and i said in the king and about that time i hear voice and i'm looking around i'm just like what what what what is this and i'm trying to figure out where it sounds like it's coming from out there but i realize it's coming from my ipad and brother ron and i i'd actually at that time i didn't have a watch on that could play it but you know somehow your watch sometimes can push play on stuff and things i didn't have that on i just closed out all my apps and brother ron's sitting at the back behind he saw as the ipad began to change it began to come and it pulls up the tapes and it pulls up a sermon and it pushes play and brother branham's voice begins to speak and he says my favorite of the hymns he talks about booth clipboard and how he wrote it in a cornfield and he sold the rights and things and he said he says my favorite of the hymns he said because it expresses the extreme deity especially in the time we're living in he said everybody wants to make him just a man or a prophet but he was more than that he was god and in the moment i didn't really catch what was going on i i was thinking of another song he may be referring to because he didn't mention the song by name and i go to the back office and i began to look up booth cleveland what did he write and i and i knew i should know but i couldn't come up with it and i pulled it up and it was down from his glory every living story my god and savior came and jesus was his name born in a manger to his oldest stranger a man of sorrows tears and hagger knee but oh how i love him oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all wow you're talking about a moment i'm beginning to thank god and praying now in my mind i'm thinking my mom's healed she's gonna come out of there not with that without a smoke smell of smoke it's over with god's answer and i go and i go through the trip and i go through my anniversary and i go to the next meeting and i'm flying she'd come back out of the hospital and seem to be make maybe making some improvements and things and and then as i'm flying back home and i'm landing the same day she goes back in the hospital and she don't come out again and so here i am and i i'm thinking on these things and still in my mind she's healed it's done it's over with in my heart i believed it and i walked into the hospital room and she had another brain bleed and she hadn't spoken about 18 hours to nobody wouldn't respond to nothing she'd look around but she wouldn't say anything and me and my father walked into the icu and i said and we prayed for her and and you know most time my mom she was she was a real prayer warrior and so most time you pray for her she'd pray sometimes i'll pray you and this is who she was and but she never even really acted like she responded and and so i'm just looking at her dad goes into the restroom and i get down in her face and i say mom look at me and she turned her head and i said i wanna i want you to understand something god has come down he is with us in this fire he's with us in this moment and she looked me right in the eyes and she goes down from his glory everliving story my god and savior came and jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrows tears and agony her hands goes up she goes oh how i love him i hadn't spoken 18 hours oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all the great creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelleth in him i thought it's over she's healed five weeks later she passes away and i'm sitting on a pier and i'm wondering why god why did this happen like this i thought it was over with he said i've taken care of her but i came down in the fire for you i knew where you were going to be at and i came down and showed myself to you that i'm with you in this fire he gave me a new song he gave me a new song to sing i realized hey it ain't just my mama's god or my daddy's god or it ain't just somebody else's god god has came personally to me in a powerful way to show himself that he is in my fire [Applause] i want you to understand this morning he's still in the fire he's still with us he's still moving he's still changing he's still directing he's not lost a bit of control governments are working at his will it's all bringing about an end time this is not iran we're about to go home [Applause] and something with image screams out oh i love him oh how i adore him my strengths my sunshine my all in all [Applause] can you say that this morning is he your all in all is he your everything [Applause] hallelujah he has made us kings and priests he has given us dominion and power and authority [Applause] the church in their church of the living god they use the power to heal the and they use the power to raise the dead it leaves the power to bind and loose hallelujah and in this moment i find every devil and try to torment your mind and try to torment your spirit and i loose you in the holy ghost hallelujah this is not man's doing this is god's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] maybe you're at a red sea this moment and you don't know which way to go i say go forward lift the banner higher we're marching to our promised land there may be a malachite there may be more bites there may be famine there may be all kinds of things but god's with us his word is here and his deliverance and he's setting us free and it's raising his up to serve him [Music] children of israel had a red sea moment one time and they said what are we doing they started looking back what are you doing when they're even in graves in egypt that we can die wasn't there a place there we could be buried in and what happened the angel of god came and showed himself and he stood between them and the host of the egyptians and he said you shall hold your peace [Applause] oh that's a powerful statement and coven you can hold your peace in church trouble you can hold your peace in trials of life you can hold your pigs but he said the egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever you don't have to speak but i'll speak and i'm going to speak to the body listen it ain't a preacher speaking it ain't a sister or brother speaking but when the word of god and the anointing of god it is as deity speaking [Music] and he changed their song he changed everything about them they got on the other side and they saw those egyptians floating over there in the red city the bible said they did but just a few scriptures before he said the egyptians that you see you'll see no more forever well there's a problem no the gypsies that were there before were not the same as they saw again because they didn't have life in them no longer could they pick up a whip no longer could they tell them one more thing to do their life had left their bodies amen they were looking at dead men that had put scars on them dead man that had told him to stop and murder dead men and told him they would never have a victory and mary couldn't stand it no more oh hi she said where is my tambourine now where's something i can give god praise hallelujah he brought me out of darkness he dropped me into this marvelous life [Applause] for what he's done your enemies down [Applause] who the sun is set free it's free indeed i'll tell you right now in this presence by the holy ghost if you feel the red season in front of you step out loud and say i'm coming down i'm walking in i'm gonna say god's gonna move for me he's gonna change my life i will not retain the same i don't have to remain the same

it through coleman devil i'm still here i made it through cancer devil is still here [Applause] glory to god [Applause] some of you just need a wave a white flag it ain't a flag of surrenders to the devil it's a flag of heaven listen to what brother brandon said he said this morning on this resurrection morning one child has come to god he said i tell you what every black belt flag in hell is down it is down he said but in the presence of god the angels are waving the white flags of victory wave it brother wavers [Applause] we got a white flag of victory it's not that i surrender it's not

of god and sent forth the other earth and he came and took a book the book out of the right hymn that of him that sat upon the throne and when he took the book four beasts four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having one of them arms and golden piles full of odors which are the prayers of the saints one day every prayer is going to be poured out and it's going to be answered before the throne of god and they sang a new song a new song thou art worthy thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals and has redeemed us to god by the blood of the lamb out of every kindred out of
