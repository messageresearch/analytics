[28:33] some of the folks still lingering on
[28:35] from the wedding. We're thankful that
[28:38] you're here with us. God bless you. I'm
[28:41] going to ask you to open your Bibles
[28:45] to First Timothy
[28:48] the third chapter.
[28:51] And we also
[28:56] uh
[28:57] are going to look at second Corinians
[29:01] the fourth chapter.
[29:08] 1 Timothy 3
[29:11] and 16.
[29:14] And without controversy,
[29:17] great is the mystery of godliness.
[29:20] God was manifest in the flesh, justified
[29:24] in the spirit, seen of angels,
[29:28] preached unto the Gentiles,
[29:31] believed on in the world, and received
[29:34] up into glory.
[29:37] I'd like you to notice because we're
[29:39] just reading this one scripture in this
[29:41] chapter.
[29:43] Great without without controversy,
[29:47] great is the mystery of godliness. God
[29:49] was manifest in the flesh.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; And part of that manifestation was
[29:57] justified in the spirit,
[30:00] seen of angels.
[30:02] That's all part of it. preached unto the
[30:05] Gentiles. That's how he was manifest in
[30:08] the flesh.
[30:09] Believed on in the world and received up
[30:13] into glory. Would you like to turn also
[30:16] to 2 Corinthians
[30:18] and the fourth chapter?
[30:36] I'm sorry. I think it's the fifth
[30:38] chapter.
[30:41] Yes. Chapter 5
[30:44] and verse 18 and 19.
[30:48] And all things are of God, who hath
[30:51] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[30:54] Christ, and hath given to us the
[30:57] ministry reconciliation. Number one, he
[30:59] hath reconciled us to Christ. That's
[31:01] number one. Number two, he's given to us
[31:04] the ministry of reconciliation
[31:07] to which that God was in Christ
[31:10] reconciling the world unto himself, not
[31:14] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[31:18] hath committed unto us the word of
[31:21] reconciliation.
[31:23] Let's just pray. Our dear Lord Jesus, it
[31:29] is in your name that we approach to the
[31:32] Almighty God. We have an access this
[31:35] evening. We're so thankful we have a
[31:37] channel that's open to us. Job, as your
[31:41] prophet said, had a channel open to him
[31:44] by revelation.
[31:46] He came to know who God was. So I pray
[31:50] father that this evening you will open
[31:52] to us the channel of your word. Any man
[31:56] with strength can turn the pages but
[31:59] only the holy ghost can reveal what is
[32:02] in the pages and in the words. I pray
[32:05] that the very essence of them the very
[32:08] essence of your thought will come
[32:11] through Lord. Not into our emotional
[32:14] channel, not into just the realm of the
[32:16] our spirit, our human spirit, but down
[32:19] into the soul. Lord, do a transforming
[32:23] work. Let your work word be active
[32:26] within us tonight. Lord, I pray in the
[32:29] name of Jesus that you'll do whatever's
[32:31] needful in each of our lives. For your
[32:34] glory, we ask it. Amen.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[32:42] I said I would be speaking on the home
[32:44] of the overcomer. When the brothers came
[32:47] down, you know, there the brothers from
[32:49] the sound booth always come down of late
[32:52] because they want to be really efficient
[32:54] and and get the title of the message
[32:56] ahead of the service. So I said, "Well,
[32:59] here's the title, but it hasn't got
[33:01] anything to do with what I'm going to be
[33:02] speaking on." So So don't let the title
[33:06] throw you. But I I told you I would be
[33:09] speaking on Home of the Overcomer. So I
[33:11] will just call this part one. The last
[33:14] time we took a series, we were about six
[33:17] six services into it and we still
[33:19] weren't really done. But uh uh this will
[33:22] tie this will tie in for sure and you'll
[33:25] see which direction we're going. Uh
[33:30] said home of the overcomer. But the
[33:32] scripture says which we read,
[33:35] God was manifested in the flesh. And the
[33:38] scripture said to God was in Christ
[33:44] reconciling the world to himself.
[33:48] The scripture says in John, you can just
[33:51] listen to these now. John 1 John 4 2 and
[33:55] 3. Hereby know ye the spirit of God.
[34:00] Every spirit that confessth that Jesus
[34:02] Christ is come in the flesh, not has
[34:05] come in the flesh, but is come in the
[34:08] flesh. There's a big difference between
[34:11] this tense. He has come in the flesh
[34:13] because much of the world whether they
[34:17] believe on him or don't believe on him,
[34:19] they believe that he came in the flesh
[34:21] and lived and died and rose again. But
[34:24] that isn't what this scripture is
[34:26] saying. It says that he is in the flesh.
[34:29] Jesus said, "I in you." That's Jesus
[34:32] Christ in you and you in me and I in the
[34:36] Father. So he says, "Hereby know ye the
[34:40] spirit of God. Every spirit that
[34:41] confessth that Jesus Christ is come in
[34:45] the flesh is of God. And every spirit
[34:48] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
[34:52] come in the flesh is not of God." And
[34:56] this is that spirit of antichrist
[35:00] whereof ye have heard that it should
[35:03] come and even now already is it in the
[35:07] world.
[35:09] Now
[35:11] uh I've been speaking on this holy
[35:15] resourcerich nation.
[35:18] Could I have you agree with me that
[35:23] Jesus Christ was God's resource
[35:29] in the earth
[35:32] but he developed this resource?
[35:36] Everything didn't come to Jesus Christ
[35:38] on a silver platter.
[35:41] In fact is the scripture says who in the
[35:44] days of his flesh in the days of his
[35:47] flesh
[35:50] when he had offered up prayers and
[35:52] supplications
[35:54] with strong crying and tears unto him
[36:00] who was able to save him from death and
[36:02] was heard in that he feared. And though
[36:05] he were a son, yet learned he obedience
[36:09] by the things which he suffered.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; God developing
[36:18] this resource
[36:20] that was in the earth
[36:22] called Jesus Christ
[36:25] and
[36:27] developed that resource
[36:30] till God in his fullness dwelt in him.
[36:34] and was pleased to dwell in him. This is
[36:37] my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[36:40] dwell.
[36:44] The scripture says that there are many
[36:46] deceivers gone into the world. This is 2
[36:49] John 1 and7. Who confess not that Jesus
[36:52] Christ has come in the flesh. This is a
[36:55] deceiver and an antichrist.
[36:59] In Hebrews the 10th chapter, it also
[37:02] reads verse 5, "Wherefore, when he
[37:05] cometh into the world, he sith,
[37:08] sacrifice and offering, thou wouldst
[37:10] not, but a body hast thou prepared me."
[37:15] This was a prepared body, not just a
[37:17] fashion here, a child being born. That's
[37:20] not what we're talking about. We're
[37:21] talking about a body. Hast thou prepared
[37:24] me? I will say and I would like you
[37:27] while while we each one and every
[37:29] Christian every believer likes to think
[37:31] well uh you know Jesus said I go to
[37:33] prepare a place for you and that's where
[37:34] we're going and he's preparing a place
[37:36] and not only that but he's preparing a
[37:38] people to that to go to that place and
[37:41] that preparation is something you know
[37:44] that is taking place and it's a very
[37:47] very real action of God
[37:50] &gt;&gt; in our lives
[37:52] &gt;&gt; very real and sometimes s it may not be
[37:55] all that pleasurable because even as it
[37:58] was with Jesus Christ, it says that he
[38:02] with strong crying and prayers and
[38:05] supplications and tears and he was heard
[38:09] of God. But nevertheless, he became he
[38:12] was he was a son and became obedient
[38:15] through the things which he suffered.
[38:18] So Hebrews continues in burnt offerings
[38:20] and sacrifices for sin thou thou hast
[38:23] had no pleasure then said I lo I come in
[38:28] the volume of the book it is written of
[38:30] me to do thy will oh God above when he
[38:33] said sacrifice and offering and burnt
[38:36] offerings and offering for sin thou
[38:38] wouldst not neither hast pleasure
[38:41] therein which are offered by the law.
[38:44] Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy
[38:48] will, oh God." He taketh away the first,
[38:50] that he may establish the second. By the
[38:53] which will we are sanctified through the
[38:56] offering of the body
[38:59] of Jesus Christ once and for all. Now,
[39:03] you know, people will say amen to that
[39:04] and we accept that. But I want you to
[39:07] know that even though God was manifest
[39:09] in the flesh in a body, that body
[39:13] endured some incredible suffering. I'm
[39:16] not talking just about the cross. I'm
[39:18] talking about the rejection. I'm talking
[39:21] about the the hatred. I'm talking about
[39:24] the animosity. Talking about the
[39:26] misunderstanding. I'm talking about all
[39:28] kinds of things that we which Christ is
[39:32] still in the flesh.
[39:34] And if you expect that Christ is going
[39:37] to dwell in you, you can very well
[39:40] expect that these same responses are
[39:43] going to be to you as well. And it
[39:46] doesn't mean that God is against you.
[39:47] Has nothing to do with that. It's just a
[39:49] natural response of an evil age, an evil
[39:52] generation, and a godless world to a
[39:55] people who have Christ living in them.
[39:58] It's a natural outcome. It's a natural
[40:02] response. But the other thing is this is
[40:04] a there's a double benefit here. Not
[40:07] only is God dwelling in us and dwelling
[40:10] in our hearts and in our lives and in
[40:12] these vessels of clay. Not only that,
[40:15] but he is this is I want you to see now
[40:18] if Jesus Christ was God's resource that
[40:22] he would develop. I would say that some
[40:24] of the things that you are going through
[40:26] and you'll understand it a whole lot
[40:27] better after this service is over is God
[40:30] actually developing
[40:32] you
[40:34] &gt;&gt; as his resource in the earth and through
[40:37] you he's going to reflect himself and
[40:40] through you but he's like the song the
[40:43] kids used to sing he's still working on
[40:45] me
[40:48] &gt;&gt; in the fourth seal brother Brandham said
[40:51] in the fourth seal
[40:54] God's like a big contractor.
[40:57] He lays out all his material on the
[41:00] earth and then he builds his building.
[41:04] Now remember, before there was a grain
[41:06] of seed on the earth, before there was a
[41:10] sun that ever struck the earth, your
[41:13] body was laying on the earth.
[41:18] this body which is dust to dust. It was
[41:21] laying here on the earth
[41:24] &gt;&gt; because you are the dust of the earth.
[41:26] You you are and God's the contractor.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when Jesus came up
[41:34] out of the water and John had baptized
[41:36] him and the dove in the future home and
[41:39] I love this phrase says he came up out
[41:42] of the water and the Holy Spirit coming
[41:45] down. He was the word made flesh and the
[41:48] Holy Spirit coming to the word and the
[41:50] word coming to the prophet. How perfect
[41:53] it is. John the prophet, Elijah
[41:58] and Jesus coming to him and the Holy
[42:01] Spirit coming to the word. And he says,
[42:04] "This is my part of the earth
[42:09] which I have redeemed. I've claimed it."
[42:13] That was a first part. He said that's my
[42:16] first part of the earth.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; That was the first one claimed by God.
[42:22] This is my son.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; He claimed it.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; This is my own. They're standing there
[42:31] in a body of flesh. That's very, very
[42:33] significant. Standing in a body of
[42:35] flesh. He said, "This is my son." He
[42:39] claimed it. And then the prophet says,
[42:41] "And through that part, he'll claim all
[42:45] the rest."
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Is that marvelous?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; And through this part,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; I will claim all the all the rest.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; God was manifest in the flesh.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world
[43:01] to himself. God developed that resource.
[43:04] Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; And
[43:05] &gt;&gt; though he were a son, yet he learned
[43:07] obedience by the things which he
[43:09] suffered.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's saying, then
[43:13] God's like a contractor. He lays all his
[43:15] materials out. And the scripture says in
[43:17] Hebrews 3:4, for every house is builded
[43:20] by some man, but he that built all
[43:23] things is God in a future home, which
[43:26] I'm going to show a lot of slides on it
[43:29] this evening, the Lord willing, giving
[43:30] me time. that God through this age, he
[43:33] said, is gathering up his material. In
[43:37] this age, he's gathering up his
[43:39] material. He's saying, "These parts are
[43:42] mine.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; These children are mine.
[43:46] This is my son." There's a lot of
[43:49] perhaps good men in the world when Jesus
[43:51] was walking here. But Jesus was his
[43:54] first part that he was claiming. And
[43:57] through that part, he'll claim all the
[43:59] rest.
[44:01] his materials. Let's talk about his
[44:04] materials for just a moment. David the
[44:07] Psalmist said 139 and 15, a scripture
[44:10] that you know well, "My substance was
[44:14] not hid from thee when I was made in
[44:18] secret and curiously wrought in the
[44:21] lowest parts of the earth.
[44:24] Thine eyes did see my substance yet
[44:27] being unperfect.
[44:29] And in thy book all my members were
[44:32] written, which in continuence were
[44:34] fashioned, when as yet there was none of
[44:38] them. That boggles the mind a wee bit.
[44:43] God saw our substance.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Saw what we were before we were.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly how he was going to put
[44:51] us together. Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Like to make this statement. God's
[44:57] people are his resource in the earth.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; God's people.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says.
[45:09] He says that
[45:12] Jacob, the Lord's portion, he said the
[45:15] Lord's portion
[45:17] is his people.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Let it sink in. That's it. God's not
[45:24] interested in, you know, a whole lot of
[45:26] other things in the world. God's
[45:28] interested in his people.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; His people
[45:33] get a just get a picture of
[45:36] &gt;&gt; who God is for a moment. Let your
[45:38] imagination loose. Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Let the boundaries of your mind be
[45:43] broken and think who he is almighty
[45:46] holiness who we're not even we're not
[45:49] even worthy to even approach unto him.
[45:53] And yet this God is saying my people who
[45:56] I these parts that I've purchased these
[45:59] parts that I've claimed that's my
[46:01] portion. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; That's why we read in Ephesians
[46:07] uh a scripture that I thought of earlier
[46:10] and uh now it just comes back to me. So
[46:12] just give me a moment while I while I go
[46:14] to it quickly.
[46:21] Scripture you've heard many times and
[46:23] you know we've been speaking out of
[46:24] Ephesians because Ephesians is our
[46:26] inheritance chapter, our inheritance
[46:28] book. Ephesians is Joshua for us.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; All right, but listen to part of this.
[46:35] We could say, "Oh, the people of God,
[46:38] the children of God were going into
[46:40] their land, going into their
[46:41] inheritance, going into their
[46:42] inheritance." But just a moment, the
[46:44] scripture which we just read says that
[46:46] they were God's inheritance.
[46:49] They were God's evidence in the world.
[46:52] In other words, God through them was
[46:54] going to prove that he was God.
[46:57] He was going to prove that he would
[46:59] bring forth his plan with all of their
[47:01] failures and with all of their errors
[47:03] and with all of their sins and all of
[47:05] their rebellion and all of their
[47:07] captivity and and into Egypt and into
[47:09] Babylon and everything else. All of it
[47:12] nevertheless
[47:14] brought forth Jesus Christ
[47:17] &gt;&gt; brought forth salvation. Brought forth
[47:19] the covenant.
[47:21] brought forth the word of God
[47:23] &gt;&gt; of the Old Testament.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; And the New,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Paul a Jew,
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Peter a Jew,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; they were Jews. Israel gave us this
[47:35] book.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[47:40] So, they were God's portion in the
[47:43] earth. And they could say, "Well, we're
[47:45] moving into our inheritance." But God
[47:46] was saying, "But you are my
[47:47] inheritance." Let's read this scripture.
[47:50] Listen to it now. The eyes of your
[47:53] understanding being enlightened that you
[47:56] may know what is the hope of his calling
[47:59] and what the riches of the glory of his
[48:03] inheritance in the saints.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; This is a double a double reaction here.
[48:09] God wants you to know what's yours, but
[48:11] at the same time, he wants you to know
[48:13] that you are his.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; You are his inheritance. Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; God wants to demonstrate
[48:23] and that's the only way he can
[48:25] demonstrate is through his own people.
[48:26] He'll demonstrate that he's God. How
[48:30] else is he going to manifest himself?
[48:33] And so because you are his resource
[48:38] in the earth and some of these things
[48:40] you've heard here before, I'm going to
[48:43] make reference to uh something that took
[48:46] place.
[48:48] God beginning with Abram.
[48:52] And it says in Genesis 22, "And it came
[48:56] to pass after these things." Abram had
[48:59] been through many things and finally had
[49:00] his name changed to Abraham and God had
[49:03] promised him a son and Ishmamail came
[49:05] along and all of these things happened
[49:08] and uh the way wasn't all that easy. But
[49:10] then it came to pass after these things
[49:13] that God did tempt Abraham. I want to
[49:17] bring you back to this thought because
[49:19] I've spoken on it before, just touched
[49:21] on it. I want you to take it so you can
[49:23] apply it to yourself. God did tempt
[49:26] Abraham and said unto Abraham, and he
[49:29] said, "Behold, here am I." And he told
[49:31] him, "Then take your son, your only son,
[49:35] and offer him in a place that I will
[49:37] show you."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; That was his greatest trial.
[49:42] And God let him go right through to the
[49:44] knife was raised.
[49:48] You know, you need to translate that
[49:50] into your life. God will let you go
[49:53] right through
[49:55] to the very point it seems that there is
[49:59] absolutely no way out of this thing.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; God will let you go that far.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And God likes to do that.
[50:09] You'd say, "What purpose would that be?"
[50:14] Because as it as he tempted Abraham, the
[50:17] scripture here in the word tempt and
[50:20] it's very very interesting. It is to
[50:23] test and there's a certain part of this
[50:26] which I have emphasized before and I
[50:28] want to emphasize again and then carry
[50:30] on from it. It is to test and to try to
[50:34] prove but to assay. Assay which they use
[50:38] is a word used in mining often. It is
[50:41] after they take the drill core of uh uh
[50:46] when they send a drill down, they take a
[50:49] core of the earth and the rock and
[50:52] whatever more and then they will take
[50:54] that into a lab and they will grind up
[50:58] that that ore or the just the core the
[51:01] sample. And I've seen it with I've seen
[51:04] it myself in the mining labs and you see
[51:06] great long boxes just one after the
[51:10] other because as it goes down you can
[51:12] just see the the the earth in see the
[51:16] the structure of the earth as you look
[51:18] at that core and they can take a certain
[51:21] segment of it and they know exactly at
[51:24] what depth that came and then they they
[51:26] assay it. They grind it up to just
[51:30] powder.
[51:31] Just powder. And then they sift through
[51:34] that powder and they put it through the
[51:36] chemical process. And then they then
[51:38] they do uh there's a whole process which
[51:40] I want to get into a little bit later.
[51:42] And then they can tell how much silver
[51:44] is in there and how much of this metal
[51:47] is in there and how much of that metal.
[51:49] That is the assay. But you cannot stand
[51:52] on top of the earth and just you know
[51:55] guess what's happening down there. You
[51:57] can't just drill it. You can't just
[52:00] You've got to take that sample. And
[52:02] that's just a sample. And once they've
[52:04] taken that sample, now they're going to
[52:07] develop. They're going to develop a
[52:10] resource in the earth. And I'm talking
[52:11] now not about you looking at your
[52:14] potential. I'm talking about God
[52:16] developing you and his people as his
[52:20] only resource in the earth.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; And friends, it doesn't come easy. It
[52:26] just plain doesn't come easy.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And the first thing that you do in this
[52:32] kind of an industry is they have to
[52:34] discover.
[52:36] They make a discovery. And they discover
[52:39] here lies some wealth down here. And God
[52:44] found you.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; God discovered you. We say that often
[52:49] that you didn't find God, but God found
[52:52] you. In other words, someday, one day
[52:57] you were in some dark pit.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; One day you were under some some cloud
[53:03] or whatever more. But one day you were
[53:06] surely in a lost state
[53:10] &gt;&gt; and God discovered you.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; God found you.
[53:16] And then once you find this kind of uh
[53:19] wealth and they determine that this
[53:22] wealth is here, we have discovered that
[53:24] there's something here, that's not the
[53:26] end of it. They they don't go, you know,
[53:29] jumping and having a a great big party
[53:32] just yet because we haven't got it out.
[53:34] Then it calls for some real hard work.
[53:37] And they call it removing the
[53:39] overburden.
[53:41] And that is the earth and maybe rocks
[53:43] and whatever more that's on top of this
[53:47] uh this ore. But they've got to develop
[53:49] the ore. And I tell you what, friends,
[53:52] you come in with a big load of baggage.
[53:56] You come in with a lot of overburden on
[53:58] you. You come in with a lot of ideas,
[54:01] your own ideas. And God isn't even
[54:03] interested in your ideas. You come in
[54:06] with dogmas and you come in with
[54:07] traditions and you come in with religion
[54:10] and you come in with all kinds of man's
[54:13] ideas and God wasn't interested in it at
[54:15] all. So the first thing they had to do
[54:17] is start removing it.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; One of the things they need to do
[54:25] is they get in there and they blast it
[54:27] out.
[54:32] And you know, you can't always do it
[54:34] easy. You can't just, you know, help the
[54:37] he can't help the chick out of the egg.
[54:40] You know, he's got to pick his own way
[54:42] out. But there's a lot of times someone
[54:44] comes in, they come into the house of
[54:46] God. I've had him come in here say, "I
[54:48] got to save somebody out of that old
[54:50] cult." And they come in there and I know
[54:52] Brother Milo was one of them. He said,
[54:53] he said, "I just got blasted right
[54:55] between the eyes."
[54:57] I don't know what it was, but sometimes
[54:59] we need to have a blast, a big blast
[55:03] happen, and just split the thing open.
[55:06] What's it doing? It's just exposing
[55:09] something that is down inside, that is
[55:12] of value, that is of worth, and
[55:15] something that God wants. Now, I'll tell
[55:17] you what, friends,
[55:19] believe me, God will go to some real God
[55:23] will go to extremities. He'll go to
[55:25] extremities saying I'm going to I am
[55:28] going to develop that
[55:31] &gt;&gt; ore and he's looking for gold.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; It's God's gold
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and you might as well just give into it
[55:39] right now because he's going to he's
[55:40] going to develop it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to put a thing through the
[55:44] mill. And once they've blasted it,
[55:47] that's just the beginning. Listen, I'm
[55:49] going to give you some scriptures in a
[55:50] few moments. I'm going to give you some
[55:53] scriptures. You'd be surprised how much
[55:54] in the scriptures that this is
[55:56] identified
[55:57] and then he you get removed out of
[56:00] there. You get you need to be conveyed
[56:02] someplace. So somebody brought you to
[56:05] church.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody got you under the sound of the
[56:08] gospel.
[56:10] I know one fell in Singapore. They were
[56:12] wanting to he was they invited him to
[56:14] come and see Deep Call of the Deep or
[56:17] one of the videos or something. I think
[56:18] it was Deep Call to the Deep. And uh
[56:21] this fellow was in uh in the army in
[56:23] Singapore and he didn't he didn't really
[56:25] want to go but he you know he this this
[56:27] believer had just been on his case and
[56:29] says come on come on you know I want to
[56:31] so he didn't want to go alone so he
[56:33] asked this other fellow he says I I'm
[56:35] going to see a picture tonight you know
[56:36] I'm going to see a they want to I want
[56:38] to see a film tonight some people are
[56:40] after me invited me will you come along
[56:42] cuz he wanted company guy he didn't know
[56:44] what it was about he said sure I'll come
[56:46] along you know so he just goes as
[56:48] company for this fella cuz this fellow
[56:49] was kind of scared scared and this guy
[56:52] who just went along, he just got
[56:54] smitten. And he's the one who came in,
[56:56] got saved. The other fellow never saw
[56:58] him again. This fell, that's how he came
[57:01] in. God knows how. He knows exactly how
[57:04] to do it. He knows how to get a hold of
[57:06] you.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; He knows how to convey you.
[57:12] Oh, he's not just conveying you to a bed
[57:14] of roses.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; No. When the ore comes out and they
[57:19] finally found something that's
[57:20] worthwhile and God has discovered
[57:22] something in the earth that's
[57:23] worthwhile, you know where he he conveys
[57:26] it. The first thing it has to go is to
[57:27] the crusher.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; It goes to a big jaw crusher or a cone
[57:33] crusher. And I have seen I've seen huge
[57:37] monstrous stones rock that was many many
[57:42] tons rock almost the size of half a
[57:44] house go into a huge cone crusher and in
[57:47] 3 minutes it's all gone.
[57:51] Sometime we may think am I going to
[57:53] survive? Well not in the state that we
[57:56] were in when we hit the crusher. We're
[57:58] going to survive but not in the same
[58:00] condition. We're going to come out the
[58:02] other end as fine powder, but in the
[58:05] powder is some gold.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; In the powder is something worthwhile.
[58:09] And it's still not done. Then it's
[58:11] conveyed. It's conveyed to a a ball mill
[58:15] or a rodmill or some kind of a mill. And
[58:18] it's just ground finer and finer and
[58:21] finer. And there's every believer. There
[58:24] isn't a believer in this place. But
[58:25] would have said, "I just don't know if I
[58:28] can take another day. Can anything else
[58:30] happen? And before you've even finished
[58:32] saying it, something has happened.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Maybe not with you, but with me.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; How many honestly can say amen?
[58:43] &gt;&gt; My look at all that. My got a wonderful
[58:45] lot of friends here. That's exactly the
[58:48] way it happens. And we think it's the
[58:50] end of the world, but it's just the
[58:51] beginning.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It's not It's not the It's not bad
[58:55] things, one bad thing after another bad
[58:57] thing. It's one good thing after another
[58:59] good thing. I tell you what, brother
[59:00] Tom, Brother Tom Ray, when he preached
[59:02] that message, you know who says it's
[59:05] bad.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Now, we've all coined that phrase, maybe
[59:08] it's good.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why.
[59:16] Now, maybe get a little bit serious. God
[59:19] God knew Abraham had faith
[59:23] &gt;&gt; but the assay proves what is actually
[59:27] there
[59:29] &gt;&gt; and then after that it's down to the
[59:31] finest powder. They put it into huge
[59:35] huge what they call separators
[59:39] and they got paddles in there and just a
[59:41] motor turning it slowly
[59:44] and that's a separator
[59:46] and it begins to separate and stuff
[59:48] begins to come out and come to the top
[59:50] and finally that water goes out into
[59:53] some uh quite often I don't want to get
[59:56] technical here but I' I've understand it
[59:58] quite well and they come into vibratory
[1:00:00] boards and these boards got little
[1:00:02] grooves grooves in them. It's the
[1:00:04] simplest thing in the world. Just little
[1:00:05] grooves. It looks like it's lino off the
[1:00:08] floor, you know, and they got little cut
[1:00:11] cut cut grooves in it and all this water
[1:00:13] that's coming. And if you looked out and
[1:00:15] saw this 200 ton truck hauling these
[1:00:19] monstrous stones and these great big
[1:00:22] crushers and all these conveyors and all
[1:00:24] of this equipment and all of these
[1:00:26] bulldozers and everything. And then you
[1:00:28] get through finally the end here's
[1:00:29] here's a little trickle of water coming
[1:00:31] out and his vibratory board is shaking
[1:00:34] like that. And that's what all of this
[1:00:36] four $500400
[1:00:39] million mine is all about.
[1:00:43] And when it's done off the end comes a
[1:00:46] little bit of gold and some silver and
[1:00:50] other other types. and they keep
[1:00:52] refining it and they'll get a a brick of
[1:00:57] gold. I was in South Africa, my wife and
[1:01:00] I, and we went to a place and maybe some
[1:01:02] of you been there and Brother
[1:01:05] Gabe, you may have seen it. They got
[1:01:07] that big mine just out of Johannesburg
[1:01:10] and uh the gold came running right down.
[1:01:12] They had it all molten. Boy, it was
[1:01:15] pretty.
[1:01:17] It just come b pouring right down into a
[1:01:19] brick about that big about that thick.
[1:01:24] It was on a pedestal. Then they had one
[1:01:26] on a pedestal right there. They showed
[1:01:27] us how they poured it. But then they had
[1:01:29] one that was already cooled is on this
[1:01:31] pedestal. So they the small crowd there,
[1:01:34] maybe 40, 50 of us. There was some guys
[1:01:36] there muscles as big as my waist almost,
[1:01:39] you know. I think they kind of knew. And
[1:01:41] so they made an announcement. They said,
[1:01:43] "Whoever can pick this brick up can have
[1:01:45] it."
[1:01:48] It was worth about five or six or
[1:01:50] $700,000
[1:01:52] at that time. Whoever This guy came
[1:01:54] down, I tell you what, he got a hernia.
[1:01:58] He was going to lift that thing. It was
[1:01:59] the last thing he did, but he couldn't
[1:02:01] lift it. Couldn't get off because now it
[1:02:04] had some real weight. But one day it was
[1:02:07] just under a great big pile of sod and
[1:02:09] dirt and mud and trees and all kinds of
[1:02:12] garbage and trash and had to remove that
[1:02:14] overburden. And one day you were in a
[1:02:16] pretty sad state. One day you just were
[1:02:19] all darkened and confused and whatever
[1:02:22] else. What am I saying? And God has
[1:02:24] brought you. And it hasn't been all
[1:02:26] easy, has it?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; We can say it's been wonderful, but it
[1:02:29] hasn't all been easy.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to take you serious
[1:02:33] for a moment.
[1:02:37] Brother Brennan had a meeting right in
[1:02:38] Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[1:02:43] And he told about
[1:02:45] standing
[1:02:47] and he said this was
[1:02:50] I was at I remember the time standing at
[1:02:54] my latest temptation
[1:02:57] and my hardest.
[1:03:00] My wife was laying in the morg,
[1:03:03] just a young wife.
[1:03:06] And my little baby was lying dying.
[1:03:10] He's probably the age of you fellas
[1:03:12] right here.
[1:03:14] This young man,
[1:03:17] you can well imagine some of you just
[1:03:19] having a child. And the baby was 8
[1:03:22] months old.
[1:03:26] And he said, "My little baby was laying
[1:03:28] dying, healthy little child a few hours
[1:03:31] before, but it took menitis."
[1:03:35] And he'd just come back from hearing his
[1:03:38] wife. He just come to the hospital. They
[1:03:39] said his wife died while he was there.
[1:03:43] Got home and they sent word for him to
[1:03:45] come immediately cuz his baby was dying.
[1:03:48] He said that was his hardest trial. Now
[1:03:50] listen close. I'm not telling just a sad
[1:03:53] story. This is a true story. This
[1:03:56] happened in our time.
[1:03:59] I went to the hospital
[1:04:02] and they had it in isolated ward and the
[1:04:05] flies were all over its little face, its
[1:04:08] eyes.
[1:04:10] I was just a young minister about 25
[1:04:12] years old,
[1:04:14] mother dead and baby dying.
[1:04:18] I went in reverently.
[1:04:20] I got on my knees and I said, 'Lord God,
[1:04:25] what have I done?
[1:04:28] We all say that.
[1:04:30] What have I done?
[1:04:34] Here's Has there been anything that I've
[1:04:37] done to transgress you?
[1:04:40] Are you doing this?
[1:04:43] Oh, why are you tearing my heart apart?
[1:04:50] Don't take my little baby's
[1:04:54] a man that's going to stand before
[1:04:55] hundreds of thousands of people and call
[1:04:58] people that are just a shadow of life
[1:05:01] off of off of stretchers
[1:05:05] out of wheelchairs
[1:05:07] by the thousands. And he's pleading with
[1:05:10] God, save my little girl. Don't tear my
[1:05:14] heart in two.
[1:05:16] And he said, "She was just big enough
[1:05:18] that when I come around the corner and
[1:05:20] blow the horn, she'd raise her little
[1:05:21] hands
[1:05:23] out and say, "Goo." He said, "I just
[1:05:27] love children." And there she laid, and
[1:05:29] the menitis draw her all up. And just in
[1:05:33] a few hours, her little blue eyes had
[1:05:35] crossed
[1:05:37] and her little hand trying to wave
[1:05:39] goodbye to me. He said, "I couldn't
[1:05:42] stand it.
[1:05:44] I thought, "Oh, God, what can I do?" And
[1:05:47] I knelt down to pray. And when I prayed,
[1:05:50] I looked and a black sheet came down and
[1:05:53] God refused to hear me.
[1:05:58] He says, "I raised up and looked at the
[1:06:00] little thing."
[1:06:04] He was telling the same account
[1:06:08] and he said, "I never could stand
[1:06:11] because what happened?" He said he shued
[1:06:13] the eyes, he shued the flies from her
[1:06:16] face, from her eyes. And he says, "And
[1:06:19] when she looked at me, she was suffering
[1:06:22] so hard till those little baby blue eyes
[1:06:26] crossed.
[1:06:27] She was in such suffering. And when he
[1:06:30] saw that little darling her eyes cross
[1:06:33] under that pain, he says, "I never could
[1:06:36] stand
[1:06:37] I never could stand it to see a
[1:06:39] crosseyed child from then
[1:06:44] God finally
[1:06:47] developed
[1:06:48] the character to where he needed it to
[1:06:51] be." says, "From then I could never
[1:06:54] stand to see a crosseyed child
[1:06:58] and never." He said, "Never." He said,
[1:07:01] "And I have seen 400 and something cases
[1:07:06] of croseyed children healed in six
[1:07:09] months." Those
[1:07:16] mothers and fathers
[1:07:20] and those children who had crossed eyes
[1:07:23] didn't know what it took to bring a
[1:07:27] vessel
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; to a place
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; where he'd pray
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; and God would hear him because God had
[1:07:37] developed the resource,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; right? and brought a son to obedience.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Not because he had sinned, not because
[1:07:47] he had done something wrong, but because
[1:07:49] God want to develop it. And many times,
[1:07:53] most times, we don't understand.
[1:07:56] And 400 in 6 months, over 400 in 6
[1:08:01] months. And it touches me because I sat
[1:08:06] just three rows down from the front
[1:08:07] right about where Sister Iris is sitting
[1:08:10] while a girl stood right here. And all
[1:08:13] she had was whites for her eyes. And I
[1:08:16] was so close. Sister Iris, I could look
[1:08:19] and I could just see a little bit of the
[1:08:21] ball of one out in the one eye stuck
[1:08:24] right up at the top of her eye. She was
[1:08:26] so pathetic. stone blind right in
[1:08:30] Vernon, British Columbia.
[1:08:32] And he prayed seven times
[1:08:36] because God had developed that resource
[1:08:40] and he knew her eyes. And every time he
[1:08:44] would look at her and when he finally
[1:08:46] prayed that seventh prayer, he never
[1:08:48] looked at her. He just turned her with
[1:08:50] her by the shoulders and turned her like
[1:08:52] that to the audience and lifted her up.
[1:08:54] And that girl's eyes were as straight as
[1:08:56] yours or mine.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Several thousand people there that
[1:09:02] night.
[1:09:04] Friends, we say, "Oh, isn't this
[1:09:06] wonderful? Isn't it wonderful?" But how
[1:09:08] did it come?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; How did it come?
[1:09:14] young man, 25,
[1:09:19] with his wife not yet buried, just a
[1:09:21] young bride, not yet buried, and his
[1:09:24] first baby,
[1:09:27] second baby laying there.
[1:09:32] The Lord's portion is his people.
[1:09:37] And Malachi the prophet said, "And he
[1:09:39] shall sit
[1:09:41] as a refiner as a refiner and a purifier
[1:09:46] of silver. And he shall purify the sons
[1:09:49] of Levi and purge them as gold and
[1:09:53] silver that they why that they may offer
[1:09:57] unto the Lord an offering in
[1:09:59] righteousness."
[1:10:01] He wasn't doing it because because
[1:10:03] God's, you know, so gleeful with trying
[1:10:06] his people, but he does it because he's
[1:10:08] developing a character. He's developing
[1:10:11] something in us. And we ought to say,
[1:10:13] "Here I am, Lord.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Here I am."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; A refiner
[1:10:22] who's one that is he takes and and and
[1:10:25] is it's like a smelter. Refine. And uh
[1:10:30] And even in the the word is called in
[1:10:32] the Hebrew it's called the proof test to
[1:10:36] prove it.
[1:10:39] David knew something about it. And I I
[1:10:42] pray that we'll have the same kind of
[1:10:44] attitude.
[1:10:46] Thou has proved my heart.
[1:10:49] Thou hast visited me in the night.
[1:10:53] Thou has tried me. And that's exactly
[1:10:56] what it is. tried is that same word
[1:10:59] refined. You have refined me in the
[1:11:03] nighttime.
[1:11:05] You've tried me and shall find nothing.
[1:11:08] I am purposed that my mouth shall not
[1:11:12] transgress. Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; In 66 and 10 said, "For thou, oh God,
[1:11:21] has proved us and thou hast tried us as
[1:11:26] silver is tried.
[1:11:36] Give me a box of Kleenex.
[1:11:48] My
[1:11:51] you know we
[1:11:54] in the very first opening parts of the
[1:11:57] scripture opening chapter of Genesis
[1:12:02] you know brother Brandham says that if
[1:12:05] you don't see Christ in every every
[1:12:07] scripture you read it again.
[1:12:11] This whole scripture thinks this whole
[1:12:14] Bible is Christ.
[1:12:24] Right. In the very first part of the
[1:12:26] scriptures talking about the creation
[1:12:27] and so on and it and it talks about some
[1:12:29] rivers
[1:12:31] and it says the name of the first is
[1:12:34] Pishon
[1:12:37] that is which compasseth the whole land
[1:12:39] of Havilla
[1:12:43] where there is gold.
[1:12:46] God know where the gold is.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; He put it there.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; And the gold of that land is good.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's in the scripture.
[1:12:56] And I want to say here we are in this
[1:13:00] end time.
[1:13:05] God knew where he put the gold.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; God knew where he put the character.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; God knew that it was good gold.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I put good gold there.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And he knows all about refining it.
[1:13:24] and developing it
[1:13:27] until it shows. Brother Ram talked about
[1:13:32] the early times in uh in Arizona. It
[1:13:36] says that the native people there would
[1:13:39] take gold
[1:13:41] and they would beat it and beat it and
[1:13:44] beat it until
[1:13:46] they could see the very reflection of
[1:13:49] the beater in the gold. beat out all the
[1:13:52] dross and the pyite and all of the
[1:13:55] things. Beat it all out till they can
[1:13:57] see themsel in it.
[1:13:59] You know, this helps you to understand
[1:14:02] cuz quite frankly,
[1:14:05] I don't I think it's I think it's folly
[1:14:08] just to preach an easy gospel. It's not
[1:14:11] going to be an easy way. It's going to
[1:14:14] be a difficult way. And we are, as he
[1:14:17] said, going to fight for every inch.
[1:14:21] And when you know that, then then you're
[1:14:24] not going to be deterred by it. Because,
[1:14:26] you know, I'm actually tired of people
[1:14:29] that get slack and give up cuz I'm going
[1:14:33] through a trial. God wants you to go
[1:14:35] through it.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; God wants to be glorified in it. God
[1:14:39] wants to bring you out. God wants to
[1:14:41] demonstrate that he is God. You are his
[1:14:43] inheritance. You are his portion. He
[1:14:46] needs that.
[1:14:49] Glory.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know that this isn't, you know,
[1:14:54] maybe what you want to hear on a
[1:14:56] Wednesday night, but
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; it's what you're going to hear. Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; It says in Revelation,
[1:15:06] I counsel thee to buy of me gold, not
[1:15:10] just gold, tried in the fire,
[1:15:16] that thou mayest be rich, and white
[1:15:18] raignment, that thou mayest be clothed,
[1:15:21] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:15:24] not appear. and anoint thine eyes with
[1:15:27] eyes that thou mayest see
[1:15:30] in the masterpiece of God said before
[1:15:34] that they had the smelter they take the
[1:15:37] gold and beat it that's how he describes
[1:15:38] it and they beat all the iron iron pyite
[1:15:42] and the dross and the dirt out of it
[1:15:45] until the beater could see his own
[1:15:48] reflection like a mirror
[1:15:54] God's developing ing his.
[1:15:58] But there is a gold of God,
[1:16:02] the trial of your faith
[1:16:05] being much more precious than gold that
[1:16:09] perisheth.
[1:16:10] And he says, "The gold of God is a
[1:16:13] Christlike character
[1:16:15] produced in the fiery furnace of
[1:16:18] affliction."
[1:16:19] That is the right That is the right kind
[1:16:22] of gold.
[1:16:24] said, 'You'd better come before it's too
[1:16:26] late, sayaeth the Lord, and buy of me
[1:16:28] gold that's tried in the fire, and then
[1:16:31] you will be truly rich.
[1:16:35] And he said, listen,
[1:16:40] listen to me. Naked, I want you to hear
[1:16:43] it. Many of you believers have read it
[1:16:46] perhaps many times. Naked physically
[1:16:50] we came into the world but naked
[1:16:54] spiritually
[1:16:55] we will not leave it.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh no we are going to take something
[1:17:02] with us and what that something is is
[1:17:06] all we can take with us nothing less and
[1:17:09] nothing more. So we had better be real
[1:17:13] careful now to see that we take
[1:17:16] something that we will that will make us
[1:17:19] right before God. You're going to take
[1:17:21] something with you.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And so then we what will we take with
[1:17:26] us? We will take our character.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So always watch that character.
[1:17:38] Always watch that character.
[1:17:41] He says, "Now, what kind of character
[1:17:43] will you take with you?"
[1:17:47] See, he didn't say that to bring
[1:17:48] condemnation on the people. He said that
[1:17:51] so that we be, you know, we would
[1:17:53] examine our heart. what kind of
[1:17:55] character
[1:17:57] you know if we
[1:18:01] if we don't understand
[1:18:03] the assay test if we don't understand it
[1:18:07] I don't think it does anything for us
[1:18:10] spiritually to cry out to God every time
[1:18:13] we come into a test a trial and we say
[1:18:19] um now just hear me out oh God deliver
[1:18:23] me out of this thing. Oh God, deliver me
[1:18:26] out. What if what if it's a what if it's
[1:18:29] something that God wants to do?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; What if it's something that God is
[1:18:34] developing?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better to say, "Lord,
[1:18:36] here I am.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; This is a difficult time, but I know
[1:18:40] that you'll deliver me if that's what
[1:18:42] you want to do. But nevertheless, here I
[1:18:45] am.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I'll submit myself
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; to whatever it is. Your will be done."
[1:18:52] As we heard Sunday night on earth and in
[1:18:56] earth as it is in heaven, let your will
[1:18:58] be done.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; This age can be nothing other than has
[1:19:04] been declared to be. And it's an age of
[1:19:07] pressure.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's an age that's complex
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; and it will increase to be that because
[1:19:16] it's going to be worse and worse.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hear me out. We have all kinds of
[1:19:22] dilemmas and all kinds of complexities.
[1:19:24] And whether it be family or whether it
[1:19:26] be marital or whether it be on the job
[1:19:29] or whether it be uh whatever it is, it
[1:19:33] just becomes more involved and more
[1:19:36] entanglements and all the rest of it.
[1:19:38] And the believer has to be very very
[1:19:40] focused
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; on the kingdom. We've got to be very
[1:19:44] focused to see the eternal side of it.
[1:19:58] said the character that's what you'll
[1:20:01] take with you. Will it be like his whose
[1:20:05] character was molded by the suffering in
[1:20:08] the fiery furnace of affliction? Or will
[1:20:11] it be the softness the softness you know
[1:20:15] in this this age? I mean, you know, if
[1:20:19] you got the least pain or the least, you
[1:20:22] know, you got indigestion, you overeat,
[1:20:25] you got this little thing. Hey, maybe
[1:20:28] this is just a meat and potatoes
[1:20:29] service. But I'll tell you what, this
[1:20:32] age is not something that develops
[1:20:35] rugged people.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God called for rugged
[1:20:40] believers. And I think that we should
[1:20:43] expect, we should expect that if we have
[1:20:46] the same, if we're going to be uh the
[1:20:49] very agent, the very vessel for the Lord
[1:20:52] Jesus Christ, then I announce to you in
[1:20:55] the name of the Lord, you are going to
[1:20:57] have all kinds of difficulties come your
[1:20:59] way. But you, it's it's how you respond
[1:21:02] to them. And you can just say, "I'm
[1:21:04] going through whatever it takes, and
[1:21:07] this is happening for a good reason, for
[1:21:10] a good purpose." And God knows.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; God knows whether it's with much or
[1:21:18] whether it's with little, whether things
[1:21:20] seem to be going ahead or whether they
[1:21:21] seem to be uh going in reverse. The
[1:21:24] thing that you have to know is that your
[1:21:25] heart is right before God. That's what a
[1:21:28] person needs to know. They need to know
[1:21:30] that their heart is in a place where you
[1:21:34] you have communion with God whether it's
[1:21:37] difficult or whether you know things
[1:21:39] seem to be uh relatively quiet and easy.
[1:21:45] The softness of this age I know what
[1:21:49] it's all about. You know,
[1:21:54] we don't want to go back to
[1:21:56] you. Ladies don't want to wash on a
[1:21:58] washboard.
[1:22:00] You want the latest automatic thing
[1:22:02] there is with all the bells and
[1:22:03] whistles. The men, they don't want to go
[1:22:06] back to an old beat up kind of vehicle
[1:22:09] that uh can't hardly operate. No, we
[1:22:13] want something. Check it all out.
[1:22:16] Make sure it's soft enough.
[1:22:19] I'm on your case. Don't worry.
[1:22:22] The lease just got up in my car and I've
[1:22:24] been looking around. So, I'm driving my
[1:22:27] wife's old clunker.
[1:22:32] You're very quiet.
[1:22:34] She said that she just she does. I said,
[1:22:36] "You need to have another car." She
[1:22:39] said, "No, I do not want another car.
[1:22:41] Don't buy me another car." I said, "This
[1:22:44] is a an this is an old" She said, "It's
[1:22:47] 14 years old." She said, "I'm just happy
[1:22:49] to tell everybody that."
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; She just said that to me in the car as
[1:22:55] she come to church. So, I'm just happy
[1:22:58] it's 14 years old. I love to tell people
[1:23:00] this 14 years old. I said, "This is like
[1:23:03] a 1938 Chevrolet that this car is. It's
[1:23:07] all little old thing. I like to get rid
[1:23:08] of it." No, she doesn't want me to get
[1:23:11] rid of it. She said it's a good car and
[1:23:12] I just want to keep it. But you know
[1:23:14] when I get you know he can
[1:23:17] we're all human I feel it's nice and
[1:23:19] soft and all the things
[1:23:24] that's his age you know the biggest
[1:23:27] pressure is to say no to it that's the
[1:23:29] hardest thing in the world say no
[1:23:36] now I'm going to show you a few slides
[1:23:40] because uh and then I'm not going to
[1:23:43] comment comment much on these but this
[1:23:46] is I'm taking I'll tell you what I'm
[1:23:48] doing and then you'll understand it
[1:23:50] because I will be coming back to it.
[1:23:53] This is a some very potent statements
[1:23:58] out of a future home
[1:24:02] because God is developing
[1:24:05] a people
[1:24:08] for a place.
[1:24:11] And I'd like to say this before we just
[1:24:13] go to them.
[1:24:15] He said that the exact same process that
[1:24:19] he's bringing the whole earth for a
[1:24:22] millennium where you are going God's
[1:24:25] people are going to live. You are part
[1:24:27] of the earth. And so he's bringing you
[1:24:29] through the same process by baptism and
[1:24:33] justification,
[1:24:35] by sanctification,
[1:24:37] and by a sealing of a baptism, a fire of
[1:24:42] the Holy Spirit. Those three, making you
[1:24:46] fit for a dwelling place for God himself
[1:24:49] to come and indwell you. You got that?
[1:24:53] Now he said he baptized the earth under
[1:24:57] under Noah
[1:24:59] and when Christ dropped his blood on it
[1:25:02] and claimed it that was the act of
[1:25:05] sanctification.
[1:25:07] He claimed it for his own and it will
[1:25:10] have its baptism of fire which Apostle
[1:25:14] Peter in his epistle said that the
[1:25:16] heavens were on fire and the earth and
[1:25:19] the heavens passed away. And the prophet
[1:25:22] describes how it it didn't annihilate it
[1:25:25] that he is he is renovating it to make
[1:25:28] it a fit place not just for God but for
[1:25:31] God and his people. And so the reason
[1:25:34] why we're caught in a very difficult
[1:25:37] place is because we've been justified.
[1:25:40] Can you say amen?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; We've been sanctified.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; We've received and been sealed by the
[1:25:46] Holy Spirit.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; We've gone through the three. But we're
[1:25:50] in a world that's only gone through two.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; We're in a world that is awaiting its
[1:25:56] baptism of fire.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; We're in a world that's not yet purged
[1:26:00] and cleansed. We're in a world that's
[1:26:03] violent with all kinds of filth and evil
[1:26:06] and perversion. And we're uncomfortable.
[1:26:09] We're not at home
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; because we've already been cleaned and
[1:26:13] claimed, justified, and sanctified, and
[1:26:17] baptized with the spirit of God. And
[1:26:20] we're in a place that's unfit
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; for a believer.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; It's unfit for us.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And you can't possibly feel
[1:26:29] at peace and at rest. And this happens
[1:26:32] and this influence and these words and
[1:26:35] and that picture and this magazine and
[1:26:38] that newspaper and this radio broadcast
[1:26:40] and that joke and this person you work
[1:26:43] with and this cussing and damning and
[1:26:45] this site and that site and and the
[1:26:47] thump thump of the boom box and all the
[1:26:50] rest of it. It's it's uncomfortable.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; We're not at home.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of it, don't let
[1:26:59] it ever get the best of you. It's not
[1:27:02] intended. It's intended that you should
[1:27:04] be victorious over it.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And we're going to come to our ultimate
[1:27:10] goal victoriously.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's according to the scripture.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham starts out and I'm
[1:27:17] going to just move through these rather
[1:27:19] quickly
[1:27:21] and not going to keep you late. I'm
[1:27:23] watching the time here.
[1:27:37] Now I want to see I want you all to read
[1:27:40] as we go one at a time. Says we are here
[1:27:43] to turn our attention towards eternal
[1:27:47] things
[1:27:50] and the life that lays beyond this
[1:27:53] mortal rage.
[1:27:55] I would like to take those two lines and
[1:27:58] brand every heart in this building with
[1:28:01] that we're here
[1:28:05] in this life every day if we should
[1:28:09] focus and turn our attention
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; because Satan in this world is is so
[1:28:18] demanding
[1:28:19] of your thoughts and your time and your
[1:28:21] focus and your attention. You can be as
[1:28:23] busy as you want, but you can still be
[1:28:25] heavenly minded.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; People say they get so heavenly minded
[1:28:29] or no earthly good. I say that's
[1:28:31] absolutely incorrect. You're no earthly
[1:28:33] good till you are heavenly minded.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Heavenly minded and a life that lays
[1:28:40] beyond this mortal reach.
[1:28:43] We pray
[1:28:45] in prayer that you will give us your
[1:28:48] direction.
[1:28:49] Believe that prayer was answered.
[1:28:52] How that we must turn,
[1:28:55] what we must do in the future
[1:28:58] and even in the present
[1:29:02] now to gain that place that we have been
[1:29:04] promised.
[1:29:08] How many want to gain that place that
[1:29:09] we've been promised? That's why you're
[1:29:11] here.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He says, I've wrote down some
[1:29:14] scriptures, some notes just to hit the
[1:29:17] highlights. So remember, it's just a
[1:29:18] highlights
[1:29:20] where it'll let you study.
[1:29:26] He that overcomemeth, that's why I call
[1:29:28] this the home of the overcomer,
[1:29:31] shall inherit all things, and I will be
[1:29:33] his God, and he will be my son.
[1:29:37] Second Peter. Now you if you want to jot
[1:29:40] these down. Second Peter the 3 chapter
[1:29:43] and Revelation 21
[1:29:46] both are speaking the same subject.
[1:29:52] However, we understand that this great
[1:29:55] home of the bride is to be here on
[1:29:58] earth. But John never wrote it out like
[1:30:02] Peter did.
[1:30:08] John just said, "I saw a new heaven and
[1:30:11] a new earth." Now, I just want to stop
[1:30:14] there a moment.
[1:30:16] Number of weeks ago spoke on
[1:30:19] worlds colliding. Remember
[1:30:23] the ancient Hebrews have no
[1:30:25] understanding of the world as the Greek
[1:30:29] cosmos, the world system. They have no
[1:30:32] understanding. They have no word that
[1:30:33] compares with that. What the ancient
[1:30:37] Hebrews had in order that they might
[1:30:39] understand the world. The world to them
[1:30:42] was history
[1:30:44] because that's how God, in other words,
[1:30:46] they could see how God dealt with the
[1:30:48] people. History
[1:30:51] and covenant. Those two, history and
[1:30:55] God's promise. They could see the
[1:30:57] trajectory of how God dealt with people,
[1:31:01] how he kept his word and covenant. That
[1:31:04] to them was the world. I wish we had
[1:31:07] that understanding that we would look
[1:31:09] back and see how God has worked in the
[1:31:13] past. And the prophet said, "If God ever
[1:31:16] did it once, he'll do it the same time
[1:31:19] if those conditions are met once again."
[1:31:21] If God ever honored faith, he'll honor
[1:31:23] it again tonight. Do you believe that?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; If God ever did it, if he ever showed a
[1:31:29] certain compassion in a certain way, met
[1:31:32] a certain set of circumstances, when he
[1:31:34] sees it again, he'll do it the same.
[1:31:36] Because God cannot change his mind about
[1:31:39] his word. And so the ancient Hebrews,
[1:31:41] they looked back, they they saw what God
[1:31:44] had done, and then they remembered his
[1:31:46] covenant. And that to them was God's
[1:31:48] order, God's system, God's program. That
[1:31:52] was God's cosmos.
[1:31:54] Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That's far better than this arrangement
[1:31:57] that we have.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And so he said I and then the scripture
[1:32:03] says in the beginning God created what?
[1:32:06] The heavens and the earth. And that was
[1:32:10] the Hebrew understanding of it.
[1:32:13] I John saw the holy city come down
[1:32:17] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[1:32:19] bride adorned for her husband. But we
[1:32:22] turn back to second Peter now and find
[1:32:24] out Peter explains how this process will
[1:32:27] come about.
[1:32:29] What John said it sounds like for the
[1:32:32] first heavens and the first earth were
[1:32:34] passed away or annihilated. But it's
[1:32:37] clear that both of these apostles and
[1:32:39] prophets are t talking of the same
[1:32:42] thing.
[1:32:44] But these passages, by these passages,
[1:32:47] one may think or be led rather to
[1:32:49] believe that the whole planet of this
[1:32:52] earth will be destroyed. I make a new
[1:32:55] heaven and a new earth that the heavens
[1:32:57] will be gone and the earth will be gone
[1:33:00] completely annihilated. But a close
[1:33:02] study and with the help of the Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit, we can see that the truth of
[1:33:07] this and that's what we're going into.
[1:33:11] It is only the atmosphere
[1:33:14] around it
[1:33:16] and the sin that's upon the earth that
[1:33:20] will be destroyed.
[1:33:22] Then these thistles and sicknesses and
[1:33:26] death and politics and sinful men and
[1:33:30] sinful women and evil spirits will be
[1:33:33] gone away and annihilated. That's
[1:33:36] what'll be annihilated. Amen.
[1:33:38] Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the overcome,
[1:33:41] the home of the overcomer,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; or the overcomer's home, however you
[1:33:46] want to have it.
[1:33:48] I'd like you to notice I'm trying now as
[1:33:51] I show you this to get you into my study
[1:33:54] thoughts. It's how I study.
[1:33:57] Then these
[1:34:01] I watch this
[1:34:04] then these thistles.
[1:34:07] That's his earth.
[1:34:09] When the fall came says, "And now the
[1:34:13] earth will bring forth thistles. It'll
[1:34:17] bring forth thorns.
[1:34:19] It'll be hard." So that's the earth. And
[1:34:22] sickness, that's this earth.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And sickness to me is a big thistle.
[1:34:30] Sickness to me is no friend. So he's
[1:34:33] talking about the earth itself. He's
[1:34:35] talking about the men and and people
[1:34:37] that are on it and death. That's the end
[1:34:40] that it comes to and politics, the
[1:34:42] system, the cosmos that they're under.
[1:34:45] And sinful men and sinful women and evil
[1:34:49] spirits will all be gone. Brother
[1:34:51] Brandam in one little paragraph has
[1:34:53] actually handled the whole thing.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; What she's saying is it's all going to
[1:34:58] be cleaned up. It's going to be purged
[1:35:00] by a holy fire from Almighty God. A fire
[1:35:04] that doesn't just burn wood. A fire that
[1:35:06] just doesn't purify gold, but a fire
[1:35:09] that will take an evil spirit and put
[1:35:11] them to a whisp of of nothing but flame,
[1:35:14] smoke, and gone.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that spirit, that demon
[1:35:19] that dealt with you today,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Are are you sure?"
[1:35:23] Absolutely sure. Because there isn't a
[1:35:26] person here. If no, if no demon power
[1:35:28] tried to persuade you or tried to put a
[1:35:31] thought in your mind or a word in your
[1:35:33] mouth or something else, then you aren't
[1:35:34] any of God's. Because I'll tell you,
[1:35:36] every servant of God, every child of God
[1:35:39] is under test by every day, every hour
[1:35:42] of the day.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And that spirit that tries the child of
[1:35:47] God, God despises that thing. But he's
[1:35:51] even just using it to bring forth
[1:35:54] something out of you because he's
[1:35:56] finding out that that spirit can that
[1:35:59] spirit cannot he's got one focus that's
[1:36:02] to destroy you. You've got another focus
[1:36:05] that is that we return to eternal life.
[1:36:07] That's our focus to our immortality.
[1:36:11] That's our focus. And a person needs to
[1:36:14] keep their focus on that. Otherwise, you
[1:36:16] become very very disheartened. Oh God,
[1:36:19] when are we going to get out of this
[1:36:21] thing? Just say, we're going to get out
[1:36:23] when God wants us out.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And after you have tried me,
[1:36:27] I'll come forth as pure gold.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And all of this is in existence that's
[1:36:45] in the earth now. Man-made systems.
[1:36:48] politics and sin, all kinds of evil
[1:36:50] spirits that the world is contaminated
[1:36:52] with. And all the heavens above us in
[1:36:55] here is contaminated with evil spirits.
[1:36:58] And I can tell you that is absolutely
[1:37:01] for sure. Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; You know, after brother Brandham was
[1:37:04] done meetings,
[1:37:06] after even a single meeting, say those
[1:37:10] demons that had been cast out would try
[1:37:14] to torment and haunt him and keep him
[1:37:18] from rest and sleep.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true.
[1:37:25] I know men have been with him when he's
[1:37:27] walked right into a hotel room.
[1:37:30] He just looked around said they can't
[1:37:33] stay here
[1:37:38] and he told me when they were in England
[1:37:42] and in a some auditorium or something.
[1:37:48] He told me about what he could see and
[1:37:50] what he saw in the other realm. Friends,
[1:37:54] you don't have to see it to know that
[1:37:56] it's very real and very present.
[1:38:00] very real and very present. But I'm here
[1:38:02] to tell you tonight, it's only sent for
[1:38:05] the benefit of the believer.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That enemy can do nothing against you
[1:38:11] that will that will succeed. Nothing.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; In fact,
[1:38:17] God is allowing it to prepare you and
[1:38:20] make you even more fit and ready. Isn't
[1:38:23] that something?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Making you more fit and ready.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] It has to be done that way because we're
[1:38:34] going to live right here.
[1:38:36] We'll prove that by the Bible. Right
[1:38:38] here is where we live. All this exists
[1:38:41] in the heavens or atmospheres and the
[1:38:43] earth which is now. This earth holds
[1:38:46] these things.
[1:38:48] But it wasn't made for that purpose.
[1:38:51] This earth wasn't made for that purpose.
[1:38:55] It was made by God the creator. And all
[1:38:58] of our bodies that we live in now were
[1:39:00] put on the earth when God created it.
[1:39:04] You're out of the dust of the earth.
[1:39:10] What did God say to the serpent?
[1:39:14] Dust shalt thou eat all the days of your
[1:39:17] life. It's really unusual, but these old
[1:39:21] physical bodies are consumed.
[1:39:24] And the scripture also says dust to
[1:39:27] dust.
[1:39:30] But just like God said to Satan who came
[1:39:33] before him when he wanted to come
[1:39:36] against Job,
[1:39:39] God allowed Lucifer, allowed Satan to
[1:39:44] attack his body. But that's as far as he
[1:39:47] would allow him to go.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Thus far and no further. You can consume
[1:39:54] his flesh, but you cannot, God said, you
[1:39:57] cannot touch his life.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; You might get sick. You might get
[1:40:03] afflicted and you might die.
[1:40:06] Those that are not raptured, we're all
[1:40:09] doomed to death. And yet, it's not a
[1:40:12] doom.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; It can only convey you into the very
[1:40:16] presence of God. Even death itself
[1:40:19] cannot defeat the believer.
[1:40:22] That's why we can be so victorious even
[1:40:24] in a funeral because it is just a the
[1:40:27] the horse has been hitched up to the to
[1:40:30] the cart and has taken you into the
[1:40:33] presence of God.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; I just thought I'd put that in as a
[1:40:39] bonus. It was all laid out here when God
[1:40:42] himself created it. You were in his
[1:40:44] thinking and in him the great eternal
[1:40:47] was the thought which is his attribute.
[1:40:50] And now sin caused all this to happen.
[1:40:53] God through this age. I should have
[1:40:57] underlined this is gathering up his
[1:40:59] material. That is not just a little
[1:41:03] light statement. That happens to be a
[1:41:06] very powerful thing. In fact is if you
[1:41:08] want to know what I personally believe,
[1:41:10] I personally believe that's why you are
[1:41:13] even here.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; God is gathering up his material. God
[1:41:20] gathered you. God didn't just find you.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; God didn't just discover you.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; God blasted you out
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; of the earth,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; out of your place where you were so
[1:41:31] nicely thought you were so nicely
[1:41:33] settled. God conveyed you to a place
[1:41:36] where he broke you down,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; crushed you,
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; did he not?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And brought you to the mill and put you
[1:41:44] in the separator.
[1:41:46] took you to the potter's house and you
[1:41:49] felt the flame and the fire and the
[1:41:51] oven, but you come out of it and here
[1:41:53] you are to be a fit vessel for the
[1:41:56] spirit of God and God himself.
[1:41:59] Hallelujah.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of God.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And in this age, he's gathering up. He
[1:42:05] is gathering up. Wasn't you say, I
[1:42:07] decided to go to I decided to be part of
[1:42:09] this group. No, it's not that at all.
[1:42:10] You can't even come if God didn't call
[1:42:12] you. And the call of God was his act of
[1:42:15] gathering up. When he called, he's
[1:42:18] already saying, "You are mine. You don't
[1:42:21] belong to anybody else. You don't belong
[1:42:23] to any church. You don't belong to any
[1:42:24] denomination. You don't belong to any
[1:42:26] man. You don't belong to any system. You
[1:42:28] belong to me.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, Sister Elner, you don't mind
[1:42:36] if I just make this personal. I'm going
[1:42:38] to close in now just a moment, but
[1:42:40] sister Sister Ellen Drake, I think you
[1:42:42] were a Sunday school teacher, weren't
[1:42:43] you? Sunday school teacher and for years
[1:42:47] and years and years the United Church of
[1:42:48] Canada and she came to the knowledge of
[1:42:51] Christ in the light of this message. I'm
[1:42:53] sure she lived a good life even in the
[1:42:55] United Church, but she was under that
[1:42:57] system.
[1:42:58] Came and find out denomination is not of
[1:43:01] God.
[1:43:02] And so she thought in all kindness and
[1:43:05] respect she should write them and let
[1:43:06] them know that they wanted to take her
[1:43:09] name off the book.
[1:43:11] And so they wrote back and said, "We did
[1:43:14] a search and we can't find your name on
[1:43:17] our book." And she was a member there
[1:43:20] and said she just praise the Lord. She
[1:43:21] never was a member on that.
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; There's another book that'll be open
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and there'll be names on that book. And
[1:43:32] every every one every particle that God
[1:43:36] gathered, that name is already on that
[1:43:39] book.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And nobody can take it out.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Well, God in this age is gathering up
[1:43:48] his material. And I think that's just
[1:43:50] where we'll end. Hallelujah.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me an extra few
[1:43:56] minutes. I want to sing this house. that
[1:43:58] that song will always have something
[1:44:00] special for me.
[1:44:03] This house, I don't know why. Why did
[1:44:05] they choose that for the for for the
[1:44:07] anniversary? Do you know? I don't know.
[1:44:10] But it's very suitable.
[1:44:13] This house.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We might not be much, but
[1:44:20] just want to be a house
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; for God to dwell in.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Shine in me.
[1:44:27] Manifest. Can you think of anything
[1:44:29] higher?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Any of you folks on the balcony or
[1:44:32] anywhere, can you think of any calling
[1:44:34] higher
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; than to have
[1:44:38] God himself say, "I want to dwell in
[1:44:40] you.
[1:44:42] I would like to show myself
[1:44:46] tomorrow to somebody. I'd like to just
[1:44:50] manifest myself. Will he be my house?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Will he be my vessel?
[1:44:58] Don't whine and whimper when things go
[1:45:00] sideways
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; cuz all he's doing is fixing his house.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody have to help me here.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:45:13] uh the one I sang at the anniversary,
[1:45:15] this is your house. Come and dwell.
[1:45:19] This is your house.
[1:45:23] Brother Derek, can you help me?
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:34] Let's stand.
[1:45:37] This is your house.
[1:45:44] Come and dwell.
[1:45:48] This is your house.
[1:45:54] It's a holy house of prayer
[1:46:00] where the lost hand
[1:46:05] we bring our burdens and their cares.
[1:46:10] This is our house.
[1:46:16] This is your house.
[1:46:21] Come and dwell.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Find those nice words. Sing it again.
[1:46:28] This is your house.
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:35] Come and dwell.
[1:46:39] This is your house.
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:45] It's a holy house of prayers
[1:46:50] where the lost and the lonely
[1:46:56] bring their burdens and their cares.
[1:47:00] This is your house.
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] This is your house.
[1:47:12] coming well.
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] Our dear Lord Jesus,
[1:47:19] lovely Christ.
[1:47:22] These people that have gathered here
[1:47:24] tonight have not gathered here
[1:47:27] in vain. They've not gathered here to
[1:47:29] show socialize.
[1:47:31] They've not gathered here to just be
[1:47:33] seen or to put in another Wednesday
[1:47:35] evening. But they gathered that they
[1:47:38] might hear something that would touch
[1:47:41] their soul. They gathered that there
[1:47:43] might be a fresh breeze of the Holy
[1:47:46] Spirit that would fan the embers. Lord,
[1:47:51] this world has a cooling effect. It
[1:47:54] would cool our spirits, cool our zeal,
[1:47:58] cool our fervor. But oh God, we resist
[1:48:01] all of that in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:06] And we say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, breath of
[1:48:09] God,
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; wind
[1:48:13] that came, a mighty wind in the upper
[1:48:16] room of the day of Pentecost.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll breathe and blow upon
[1:48:23] every heart, every soul, every person
[1:48:27] that is in this place, oh God, that is
[1:48:29] under the sound of my voice on the
[1:48:31] internet or wherever they may be this
[1:48:34] evening.
[1:48:35] And I pray for those that are out of
[1:48:37] touch, out of fellowship.
[1:48:40] Oh God, cool in their experience and
[1:48:44] perhaps tonight engaging in something
[1:48:46] that they ought not to do. I pray that
[1:48:49] you'll speak to them and deal with them
[1:48:51] and bring them, oh God, and let
[1:48:54] conviction fall upon them. your
[1:48:56] children, oh God, though they may go
[1:48:58] into bondage and though they may get
[1:48:59] cold and though they may disob disobey
[1:49:02] you, I pray forgive them, oh God.
[1:49:05] Forgive them,
[1:49:07] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:49:10] I ask that you'll permeate the very
[1:49:15] atmosphere here. We hear how your
[1:49:19] messenger, your prophet messenger, oh
[1:49:21] God, speaks of these atmospheres
[1:49:25] and how well we know that they're
[1:49:27] contaminated. We think of what is
[1:49:29] traveling through that fourth dimension
[1:49:32] being picked up by televisions and
[1:49:35] transmitted, oh God, around the world
[1:49:37] and into space. Oh God, but one day, one
[1:49:41] day it will be purged with a holy fire.
[1:49:45] And we say, "Bring it on, Lord. Bring it
[1:49:47] on." Oh Lord, we say even now, oh God,
[1:49:51] we are, we feel ready, Lord, we just
[1:49:54] feel ready. We want to step into that
[1:49:58] perfect place that you are creating a
[1:50:02] home for the overcomer.
[1:50:06] I pray dear Lord that you'll strengthen,
[1:50:09] you will invigorate,
[1:50:12] you will give grant courage to every
[1:50:15] believer. This is my prayer. I'm calling
[1:50:17] on you Lord to do this that you'll
[1:50:20] strengthen. Some are perhaps in a
[1:50:22] difficulty maybe in a physical
[1:50:24] situation.
[1:50:26] We think of our sister Marge Miller. Oh
[1:50:28] God, what a valiant soldier she is. Oh
[1:50:32] God, what a radiance upon her face. I
[1:50:35] pray, oh father, that you'll fill that
[1:50:37] room and fill her body with the virtue
[1:50:40] of Jesus Christ. Let resurrection life,
[1:50:44] oh God, rule. Let resurrection life
[1:50:46] press everything else out that's
[1:50:49] contrary to that life.
[1:50:52] It is our prayer, oh God, our desire
[1:50:55] you'll bring her out from that hospital
[1:50:58] bed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:02] Hallelujah. We pray, Father, that you
[1:51:04] will work your work in our lives.
[1:51:09] And when things do not seem to go the
[1:51:11] way we expected it, may we not question
[1:51:15] you.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; May we just simply dedicate ourselves
[1:51:20] more completely and say, "Thy will be
[1:51:22] done on earth and in this earth as it is
[1:51:25] in heaven." In the name of Jesus Christ
[1:51:29] and for the glory of God. Thank you for
[1:51:31] these lovely, sweet people that have
[1:51:33] come out, Lord, and are here tonight to
[1:51:37] with their presence to bless one
[1:51:39] another. I ask that you'll go with them.
[1:51:43] Give them safe journeys.
[1:51:45] Dismiss us with your grace and your
[1:51:48] blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:51:56] This is your house.
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:00] Come and dwell.
[1:52:04] Can you say that? This is your house.
[1:52:11] Come and dwell. Isn't that nice? This is
[1:52:16] your house.
[1:52:20] This is your house.
[1:52:23] Come and dwell.
[1:52:25] Amen. Shake hands with another vessel.
[1:52:30] another
[1:52:32] pilgrim.
[1:52:34] Amen. Bless you, brother Derek.
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:53:10] Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:54:07] Yes.
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:24] Everything
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:58] Hallelujah.
