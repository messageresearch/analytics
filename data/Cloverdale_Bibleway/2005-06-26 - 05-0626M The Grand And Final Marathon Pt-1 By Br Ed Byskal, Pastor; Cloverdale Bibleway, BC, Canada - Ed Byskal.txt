The victory is when I was thinking high. [Music] might have [Music] all my victory. Oh, victory. [Music] Victory. Oh, victory. My [Music] car [Music] is love. What is love? If I was you for all day, oh joy is mine. [Music] Today [Music] when life [Music] be [Music] with my victory. behind [Music] him. [Music] Stones are a stones are a confession. Stones are memorials. The capstone is Jesus Christ. The chief cornerstone is Jesus Christ. Joshua 4 5-7. And Joshua said unto them, "Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, "What mean ye by these stones?" Then you shall answer them that the water of Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it was passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off, and these stones shall be for memorial unto the children of Israel forever. Daniel said, I saw a stone hewed out of the mountain without hands, and it rolled into the kingdoms of this world and broke them to pieces, and they blowed away like chaff upon a summer's threshing floor. and a stone grow into a great mountain that covered all the earth. That's what he said about him. Therefore, he will rule the world someday. People are struggling today for a world ruler. Each nation wants their language. There their thoughts. Each denomination wants their groups over the other. But there's coming one that will be Jesus Christ. He is the ruler of the universe. Nonetheless, God himself. Jesus saith unto them, "Did ye never read the scriptures, the stone which the builders rejected? The same has become the head of the corner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes." That stone the that Christ Jesus, that stumbling stone to the world, a stone of an offense, a laughing stone, a stumbling block to the church, but a precious and a low stone to a believer, a stone of an assurance, a stone of rest. [Music] Daniel saw that stone that was out of the mountain. Daniel saw that stone that went down. Daniel saw that stone that was out of tearing out the kingdom of this world. [Music] I'm looking for that stone that was here. [Music] Looking for that stone that came out of Babylon. Looking for that stone that was down the kingdom of this world. Jesus is that stone that was down. Jesus is that stone that came rolling down to Babylon. Jesus is that stoing [Music] out the kingdom of this world. [Music] I'm glad I found that stone that was a mountain. I'm glad I found that stone that went down. I'm glad I found that stone that was mag. [Music] [Music] There is a flag from the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. There is a flag. From the castle of my heart into prejudice there. Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole world know. Let the whole world know. Let the whole world know. Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole world know that the king is in president. [Music] The flag from the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. There is a flow. From the castle of my heart. And the king is in president. Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole world know. Let the whole world know. Let the whole world know. Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole world know that the king is in preidence. [Applause] Whole stack of lively stones here. You don't think they're lively stones. Come help us out in Sunday school for a while. These children have done immensely huge and well beyond our expectation things this year. And um every year there's always a little something to tell. And I I know that this is our our our day of the year which we present the missionary offering that they've collected their pennies, nickels, and dimes over the year. And um but while the main body of the Sunday school were collecting their little things, uh we had another classroom that uh was collecting for uh for a special little missionary project. Out in the in the uh lobby here, we've got this thermometer that's slowly going up. I think it was about a year and a half ago, we wanted to put uh print a million books. It was going to take place in the Congo. Was 10 cents US a book. And so, Brother Mike Ganyy's class took it on themselves to uh see what they could do to further that along. And you know, it's interesting in the scripture that just about the time things started to get complicated, uh the disciples were given power to go out and preach the gospel and they were coming back happy that even the demons were subject unto them and all the rest. And then they were a little upset because some guy that wasn't in their group was he, you know, preaching uh in healing in the name of Jesus. And and all these things were taking place. Jesus took a little child and he stuck it right in the middle of the disciples and he said except you become as one of these and you know he just brought everything down so simple and with children it is so simple and you ask them to do something and they get the idea they catch the vision then they go I'll do that so brother Mike uh got these kids going on uh in Canada here if you find a pop can it's worth a nickel and if you find three of them with the exchange rate the way it has been up and down you have a message book so it was a bottles for books campaign they took off on. Well, our folks in the states, they they don't get to do that. So, consequently, um uh they invented all kinds of ingenious ways of doing things. And I know even with my own son, we went to clean a bedroom and uh he declared as we started that every nickel, dime, penny that was in that room that he found lying on the floor belonged in that mission box because they took it personally. They just it was so simple. It was just if it's money lying around, it's going to make a book. And in fact, one one family had a uh money for behavior situation and uh one young fellow got enough funds to get to do 494 books on his own. So uh he was a well behaved little boy. Um Sister Lillian has a poster for us. You want to come forward, Sister Lillian? This class put together enough funds to make 4,323 books. Anyway, and that's over and above what we intended to do. And um brother Tony made a me a need known to the Sunday school this year about um the ministers in India. They would like to um they wanted to be able to have a little bit of transportation to get around, deliver the uh books, do some more evangelistic work, and of course they walk everywhere they go. Um, and it brought back to mind what I often quote when I'm doing things for men of visions work, which is Galatians 6:9 and 10. And of course, Galatians 6:10 is, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unment, especially to them who are of the household of faith." And so, these children took it upon themselves. We told them what we wanted. We wanted to go for about 10 books and or probably 10 bikes. And, uh, they're about $54 US a piece over there. And so, um, well, I just left it with the children. And now I'm going to get brother Daryl if he'll come on down and take the box. Brother Bisl, if I could get you to come forward. And where's our sister Emily? Can bring down the envelope. And we'll have Brother Biscll read you the total. Actually, that's better on the floor. Gravity has a way with things. There we go. Sometimes I think I wish I had a drum roll here, you know, not the one for the approaching event, but rather the death march because we're fixing to blow the devil out of the water. Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School Missionary Offering 2004205. The Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School Missionary Offering for the 2004205 Sunday school year goes to India. We endeavored to supply bicycles for ministers in India to help mobilize the spreading of the gospel and printed Christian materials. Brother Tony Abbma said it would cost around $54 US for one bicycle. So, the Sunday school wished to supply 10. They have collected over $1,000 in mixed currency and have achieved approximately the purchase of am the amount purchase amount of 17 bicycles. I would like to say on behalf of the church and on behalf of those that are in India and in Congo and those that will hold a book in their hand, I want to say to the all the Sunday school children, great is your reward in heaven. &gt;&gt; Great is your reward. God bless you. And to brother Richard, I think he's done a master masterpiece of a job. God bless you, brother. Hallelujah. God bless uh all who sung and uh and God bless you for taking that thing away again. That's sister Elizabeth, brother Jeremy. Lovely. We enjoyed it so much. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You can show us some appreciation. We clap our hands. We're saying thank you, &gt;&gt; saying, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; And you can remember when you see these young people and children passing in the foyer, they may seem like they have their own direction. uh they're they're busy with their own friends, their own peers, but uh you'd be surprised what's down in their heart. And every once in a while it it comes out. But as they get older, I can assure you that you'll never never regret having had your children in this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. Sometimes it costs uh extra energy on your part, maybe to get them to school, for example, or to have them here a little bit earlier for Sunday school, which starts just a wee bit early, and then we like to have them in the service during the preaching of the word. Some churches don't do that. They have the children out all during the uh service and I don't think that's right because you and I do not know how much they absorb &gt;&gt; and they they have they're sensitive and they can absorb things uh even without fully understanding them. They don't have to understand them, but they absorb an atmosphere. They absorb a presence of the Lord. And uh we're we're really really grateful. We're grateful for all the teachers and those that have put out such an effort for it. But you take the world and those that are in uh in sports or any kind of uh activity whether it be drama or whether it be you know any kind of sports activity. Uh I've had relatives and they will get I in fact is I have a cousin and all she had was boys. She had a bunch of boys. She had a set of twins and then another son. I think she had another set of twins. Anyway, she ended up with five boys I think it was. She they were in hockey and in practice and they'd be practicing late. The country was cold in the winter time in the Midwest. She said that get home about 1:00 1:30 in the morning from the older boys and some of them had to get up at 6:00 in the morning. She'd just leave her car running out in the driveway. Wasn't worth shutting it off. They put that kind of effort for what? &gt;&gt; To send a little rubber puck around on the ice and the the boys, you know, have have some activity and have some uh social structure. And I think this social structure far exceeds anything in the world. I'd far sooner have my children from babes. From babies. I say to you that have babies and the sisters that are in the nursery. Uh fine, be in the nursery. But uh this is this is the atmosphere to bring them up in. I believe it with all my heart. And we've tried to practice that. So, as they get as the children are getting seated, uh, I'd like to I'd like to just sing a chorus if we would. Let's just sing uh we lift him up in the higher highest place. You'll help me out. &gt;&gt; We praise you &gt;&gt; in the highest place. For you are the great high priest replace you above all else. all else and we come to you and worship at your feet. &gt;&gt; Let's stand as we sing it once again. Oh, we place you in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We praise you. High above all else. all and we come to you to worship at your feet. [Music] I think most everyone has found their place. I'd like the congregation to collect their thoughts together. And uh we're here for one purpose. We want to make heaven our home and we want to do everything we can to help someone else along the journey. We're not here just for ourselves, but we're here for the those that are around us. I want to sing also just before we turn to the word worthy. Uh worthy. It's 2119. And I'd like everyone if you would please to be just as reverent as you can and no movement unless you absolutely emergency say I think sometimes people go out and back because it's habit and let's break those habits because it's disturbing to others that are sitting around. Let's keep our our focus on the word today and be honoring to the Lord Jesus Christ. And so unless it's emergency, let's not move. And those that are in other places, whether in a fellowship, in a nursery, or in in uh wherever they might be in the building, and those that are in homes, on the internet, I've seen and I have been on the internet with others, and I've seen such respect. They stand with us when we stand. They sing as we sing. They pray and whatever we do they're doing. And I say, "God bless them." God will honor that. Hear the cries of the shackled from the onset of time. On we're here as a group of people today, but I want you to be mindful that the shepherd will leave 90 and nine and go out for one. And he might do that even in a service. Go out for one. He's interested in in restoring everyone. All right, let's sing it together. Give him praise. [Music] from beyond of time for the tears of there is no see the tears of the broken the slave worthy. set us free. &gt;&gt; Oh, here it is. Now Christ is still as the chorus out from their [Music] mountain. The voices are swelling the song for worthy the lamb that was slain. Worthy. Oh worthy. So worthy. Worthy for the lamb that was worthy. So worthy, worthy of the lamb that was slain. and all the archangels the saints of all time their crown in their [Music] fall down before worthy worthy [Applause] Worthy [Music] worthy worthy worthy lamb that was slain. Worthy. So worthy that was with our heads bowed, our hearts filled with praise and thanksgiving. In one spirit, Lord, we come into your holy divine presence. We move in softly. We move in, oh God, only because you have extended grace. It is as though you have lifted your scepter and said to us, "Come." We have been welcomed into your presence and before your throne. We bow now reverently, oh God, realizing we are but vessels of dust from the earth. And we bow our heads down from the to the dust from whence we have come. Recognizing, oh God, that anything of value and worth that is in us, you have given it. And we give you praise because you're the giver of every good gift. You're the giver of every delivered soul that is here today. You're the deliverance, oh God. You are the healer of every sick body, those present and those that may now are listening with us. I pray, Father, that you will come near, very, very near to each one as we hunger and thirst after righteousness. Lord Jesus, I'm so glad I can testify you're not only my redeemer and savior personally, but my friend. And oh God, we need a friend. And we have found a friendship in Jesus. We have found you as a friend. I pray that you will be so near to everyone. All those that are present and those that may be visiting ask your grace upon our lives now. Open your word. May the Holy Spirit who gave author authorship to the word now give interpretation to it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I'll have you open your Bibles to First Corinthians, the ninth chapter. Thank you to the musicians. God bless you. We enjoy his presence. We like to have the service conducted. So he is welcome. Amen. The ninth chapter I'm going to begin to read from the 19th verse. For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews. To them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law. To them that are without law as without law, being not without law of to God, but under the law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. To the weak I became as weak that I might gain the weak. I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, but so fight I not as one that beatth the air, but I keep my body I keep under my body and bring it unto subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast away. May God bless his word to our hearts. You may have your seats. You can keep your Bible open if you would like to. Sometimes uh minister has things that he would like to say on his heart. Sometimes they are uh of a personal nature. And uh just the last two days, I guess it was, I I began to uh I'm not one for trying to keep time and dates and schedules and so on, but I I began to try to remember when it was I entered the ministry. And I actually had to take a calculator out. And I think next month will be 50 years in the ministry. And I left uh when my wife was just carrying a Linda and she was pregnant during those first meetings and with morning sickness and all the rest of it which I didn't understand because I hadn't had didn't have quite the same upbringing and didn't have a family where you learned a lot of things and uh uh that was our beginning. There have been years when uh the first church where we pastored, there was no concept and no understanding that the church supported a minister. It was just understood the minister worked. And so uh I worked uh we worked and uh u what came into the church just went to pay the church's bills and it uh I don't know it just managed to go along. I guess we didn't have anything to do with that because the church always had a secretary, a treasure. And uh so that seven that was about seven seven and a half years in two different at two different times for the same church. But uh all those years we we never received anything. It just in fact is I never even thought of it. It just was a natural thing. we just uh knew that we were to work and try and support ourselves and try and uh do the best for the church and and and pastored the little group. It it finally grew to be about 120 which was fairly substantial. And then going to the native Indian people, I'm not going to belabor this, but uh uh once again, you know, it was a matter we just had to find our own way. And uh I I can truthfully say and it just came to me actually this morning in in prayer while I was praying before coming to the pullpit. Uh it was God actually spoke to my heart just before the message came to us and the revelation of the message. And I can truthfully say that as we as we entered into our inheritance from that time, God just began to bless began to bless whether it be the family or the children or the labor of our hands or the mission work or whatever it seemed because the blessing was not on the person or the persons. The blessing was on the word. The blessing is on the promise. And as we give the promise, the word of God first place in your life, in fact is the only place in your life, the blessing is on the word. &gt;&gt; And God will prosper that word most definitely. I'm going to say a couple serious things. I want you to listen closely. In a congregation of this size, you have very very distinct and different personalities. And you have some that are very passive. You have others that are very strong. You have some that don't ever declare themselves and you have others that are always declaring themselves. And to keep a congregation moving with a central focus and a central vision is more than a man can do. It can only be done and accomplished by the Holy Spirit. But I can tell you it is only a unified direction that God will bless. He will not bless everyone's diverse and personal opinions and personal likes and personal dislikes. It is something that's got to be founded solidly on the word of God. And it is and that's the only way it can be conducted. And so you may wonder about these things, but that's what Apostle Paul said. And perhaps you wouldn't have grasped the scripture as I will read it to you now. For though I be free from all men, and I personally, not to liken myself to the Apostle Paul, a great Apostle Paul, I would never never do that. But I will say that I feel that I am free from all men. And that I have made myself servant unto all. I've thought to be a servant to the people. and also my wife I have sought to that we could serve the people and I don't mean just locally but Paul said I made myself servant under all that I might gain the more and under the Jews I became as a Jew that was his lot that I might gain the Jews and them that are under the law. Even though grace was being introduced, there were those that still were hanging under the law. He didn't go and axe them and chop them down. He said, "As under the law, to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law, and them that are without law as without law, being not without law of go to God." He certainly was wasn't without his his his commitment and law to God, but under the law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. And to the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak, I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. Because not all are going to actually make it. Not all are going to hang in there. But the reason why you pour out your life and the reason why God has called you to pour out your life is to be a unifying force. It's not to live to yourself, not to live to your own personal tastes. And it's to live to the body and the betterment of the body of Christ. And I believe that we need to put every effort, every effort. I say that to all and I would say that to especially to the young people. We don't grow up to for your own, you know, your own personal likes, your own personal taste. You that play in the music and you that sing. We don't sing so that you are stimulated. We sing so the people should be blessed. We don't play instruments because so that you will be stimulated by your own uh by your own contribution but we play so that the uh congregation can be blessed and that the uh worship can go up to God and we as individuals some are some don't have a stitch of music in them that's fine uh you can make a joyful noise unto the Lord but don't criticize the one that does have music in them and you that have music in them you Don't criticize those that don't have any music in them. We We are not here for that. That is not our calling and not our purpose. Our purpose is to do everything that you possibly can to further the cause of Christ. And I will say something else. There's a lot of things that are ABCs and we need to be tending to some algebra. &gt;&gt; We need to be tending to some things. I tell you when you're out there when we sang the last song, my my concern is the souls of the shackled &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit come and set them free. &gt;&gt; That is our concern. That is our burden and that is the vision of Christ. And I have just said those things not because that's my message, but that is what's been on my heart. And furthermore, every person that calls this your church home, you have an obligation to myself as a minister, I have an obligation to you. And I spend hours at it to come here on a Sunday morning on every meeting and to deliver my soul before God. And we don't take this lightly. I don't have a I don't have a late sleep in on Sunday morning. And I don't have I don't have a Saturday like you have. I have Saturdays that are and and throughout the week that are filled with study and filled with burden and filled with concern and maybe on the phone an hour or two hours and trying to bear the burden of somebody else. Your responsibility is to make my load lighter, not heavier. &gt;&gt; And that's why we need your support. And I call on you for that support and see that that is if you do anything, you you go in prayer. If you see anything wrong, you pray about it. And you have you have to have confidence out there that this man here is doing absolutely everything he knows to do and will wait on God and will do the right thing. &gt;&gt; And when there's situations to be dealt with, I'll tell you what I do. I wait on God till God gives me an answer in the word of God, then preach it over the word, and I expect the people to accept it. &gt;&gt; And I think that's all right. I'm at the other end. I uh my record's already passed and I'm so glad I've been at it 50 years. &gt;&gt; Won't be long, brother Ernie. It'll all be over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, I want to preach to you this morning. I want to preach to you about something. It's a strange subject. I want to preach on the Grand and Final Marathon. Paul has said, "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so fight, not as one that beatth the air." We're not in this for just some futile exercise. We're in this run. And I want every person, you've got to resolve something within your heart. This is a race for the the it's it's the grand marathon. It's the race of your life. &gt;&gt; And I have to be honest. I see believers that are running this race with a whole lot less intensity and a whole lot less commitment than those that are running the 26 mileer. The first marathon they said was held in Athens, Greece in April 1896. It's 26 miles 385 yards and it's from one place actually I guess it was called Marathon to to Athens and that was the first one. I just did a little look up and this is going to go in a very very strange direction so you'll need your minds completely captivated and I trust the Holy Spirit will do so. There are hundreds of training groups, hundreds, literally hundreds and thousands of instruction books and DVDs and videos and all kinds and all manner of of uh references to train people for a marathon. If you wanted to go on the web, you would I found 2,370,000 plus references to training for the marathon. That's what the world is consumes themselves with. And people travel around the globe so they can participate in another marathon. And uh you might ask them, "What what what are you doing it for?" Well, I guess to get to the end of the race, to cross the finish line. And somehow there's some satisfaction. There's some fulfillment. There's some uh uh sense of achievement. I made it across the finish line. I flew to New York. I did the Boston or I did the one in Europe or wherever more just for that purpose. I thought, what have they got when they're done? Well, they've got some sense of inner satisfaction and they've got a body that is really wore out, &gt;&gt; I'm sure. And they can say, "I've done the 26 mileer." There's a fellow, he's a shoe shine boy down in Vancouver. And uh if you observe him, and I say this very respectfully, it looks like there's a few bricks missing. Really does. Looks like he's not quite all there. And uh you know, you just you murmur a wee bit and so on so forth and and it just looks a wee bit different. It just He approaches things from kind of an he's kind of an eccentric of some sort. And uh I I've had I've had him shine my shoes cuz I just had a little pity for him. And then other fellas come around and says, "Oh, hi. How are you?" You know, and they have their little talk and so on. Did you did you do the 26 mile over here? Yeah. Yeah, I did. And when they went by, I said, "Are you a marathoner?" "Yeah, yeah." He says, "I I run I run the 26 mileer." I said, "How many of you run?" you know where where where have you run? Oh, I've run here and I've run down there and New York and over here and he flies all over the country to run the 26 mileer. And I think he'd run around 40ome. And no wonder he looks so lean. And uh I thought this guy isn't missing anything. He's just he's a fanatically committed to this thing. So every time I talk to him, you know, that's the thing he wants to talk about. They say that the distance the distance runner's diet adapted from marathon the ultimate training guide. They have what to eat and drink in your next running race. They have nutrition for the endurance athlete. I'm going to tell you as a congregation today, you're not going to make it in this grand marathon if you don't eat the right thing. &gt;&gt; You're just not going to make it. &gt;&gt; You're not going to make it in this marathon saying, "Well, I went to church Sunday morning." You are not going to make it. You've got to have a diet of nutrition of spiritual vitamins &gt;&gt; that will uh come into you and that you will absorb in your in your spiritual body because you're going to face obstacles in this marathon. And we are. There isn't anybody here. No, no one here. You've got your burden. You've got your weight. You've got whatever you have. You've got your concerns. And they will not lessen. They will increase in this generation. And you've got to be resolved. I am running to make the finish line. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You're not feeding." And I'll say so this morning, you're not feeding on a man. &gt;&gt; A man, his words will fail. But you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; If you haven't fed, he said, if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these, he he mentioned denominations and things of the world. Will you at this time do it? He said and that is my my appeal to you even now things of the world the world is a uh it's a subtle place and Satan is a subtle he's a subtle master of of this generation. He has every kind of thing that he would throw out to the people and he would attempt to do everything that he can to just uh subtly move the people in the direction or a life or a home or whatever more. And there you have to be completely given over to the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. You're feeding on the B. And if you don't feed on that kind of nutrition, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the whole council of the word of God. &gt;&gt; You'll not you'll not run successfully this grand marathon. They say another key nutrient that is a must for athletes, a must for athletes, we're talking about men who run and women who run a natural race. A must is water. And I can tell you, you can't just sit in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to have a fountain. You need to know that you're drinking from the fountain and that you've got a resource and that your soul becomes refreshed &gt;&gt; and you're strengthened, you receive something. Do you know do you know when you have a a a cup of water in your hand? This is a foolish sounds foolish, but do you know when you have a cup of of cold water in your hand or you take a bottle of cold water and you just uh take it down how you feel, how your thirst is quenched, but you don't know everything that it's doing to your body, but it's restoring you. You've got to have water. People are uh concerned about being dehydrated. You've got to have water. I tell you, you've got to find that water of life and and and drink from it on a continual basis. You've got to be refreshed. If you don't, you're not going to you're not going to run successfully this race. &gt;&gt; And God, the prophet said, is the fountain of all. He's the fountain of all grace. &gt;&gt; This fountain, it's not just like H2O. This fountain is grace &gt;&gt; and this fountain is joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have found that this the things of this life and the burdens and the worrisome of us begins to sap your joy away from you and you don't have joy, remember there is something that you're not getting from the fountain and it's an essential nutrient. I'm not talking about frivolity. I'm not talking about joking or jesting. I'm talking about a joy that there is a a deep joy within your being. There's such a joy. &gt;&gt; I have such a joy that I've been able to say today. I've ministered for 50 years. I have such a joy in being able to say that. I thank God for the privilege. I thank God for the burdens. I thank God for all the hardships. I thank God for the for the steep side of the mountain. Because I can look back and you you can also you can look back and say God led me all the way. &gt;&gt; God helped me through that time. And when I was feeling dehydrated, I found the oasis. I found an artisian well. And I drank and oh, I was restored. I fell. But I got up again and and went on. prophet said, "Come to the fountain, &gt;&gt; the artisian well, the everliving presence of Christ." The presence of Christ. You've got to sense it's it's not just doctrine. &gt;&gt; And it's not just quotes. It's the presence of Christ. It is a relationship with a person. &gt;&gt; I believe him to be the inexhaustible fountain of life. more you get from him, the fresher it gets and the colder it gets and the better it gets and this and the sweeter it tastes the fountain of living waters. I'm not preaching you to to you a sermon this morning so much as a testimony. I'm here to testify I found that fountain and I am telling you as a congregation that fountain is sweet. that fountain is fresh. And I have never tried to just give you a bunch of uh dos and don'ts and a bunch of quotes and said you have to do this or it's chop chop. I've said that if you don't do this, you're the one that's a loser. You're the one that's missing out. But this is a blessed blessed walk with God. This is a blessed relationship. And this message is a person. &gt;&gt; This is a person. And it's the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You'll know where I'm coming to and I hope I can get to it this afternoon or today. They monitor also, and I'm going to leave this. They monitor your heart and your training to make sure that everything's all right. I thought, "Oh, God, if they do that for a 26 mileer, what about us? What about you today sitting in this congregation? And you're here, I hope, because you have a you have a commitment more than a commitment. You're here because you want to and you're determined to make this goal, sir. this eternal goal &gt;&gt; or you shouldn't be here. That is your that's what you're consumed with. And these people that have become so consumed that they give their lives and they practice all hours and they go through all this training and eat all the kind of food and drink what they're supposed to drink just for a uh just for a a a satisfaction, some kind of human achievement. What about us? &gt;&gt; What about us? We as a church cannot for a moment take this as say the church down the street. We're not another church down the street. This is a gathering of people that has heard thus sayaith the Lord. And we have heard a message that is to carry you over from mortal to immortality. And that is our prime concern. That is my prime interest today is to uh save some. To those that are under the law, I try to be under the law. And those that are free without the law, I've sought to be that way. Those that are Jews, be a Jew. Those that are this, those that are whatever more, be that for them. &gt;&gt; You don't understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; We've got a mixed congregation here. About 40 different nationalities, cultures from all different directions. And where where you came from, I seek to make myself that. so I can talk to you and blend with you and help you along the way that I might gain some. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that example is to be your example. Be that be be you can't be all things to all men all the time, but you can some of the time. And I believe that God will help us as a congregation. God wants this assembly to be a banner light &gt;&gt; of this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan would do everything. He hates it. &gt;&gt; But I declare he cannot snuff it out. He can do nothing against the work of God. He can avail nothing in his in his attempt to snuff out the life. I've proven it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm proven it. And I'm rubbing his face in it today. &gt;&gt; He cannot snuff it out. He cannot stop this gospel. I've seen some that have been criticizing the message on the on the internet and and there's a whole page. Brother Ernie, you sent it to me. And that the first letter to that man, oh, he's he's even pleading for offerings and money for people to help him so he can help to get people out of this terrible doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's false cult. And a man wrote from Siberia. And the man was writing he he wasn't he wasn't uh agreeing with this man. He was just saying I hear about William Brandom uh you know where is uh can you place him in the Bible or what does the Bible say about it? Oh I tell you what this man feels he's absolutely uh given over and consumed with. He's got to get everybody out of it and he he even admitted himself this thing is spreading all over the country. I said praise be to God. Even the enemies of the message have to declare they can't do anything about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to those from Congo or those from Malawi or those from Zimbabwe or wherever I have tried to be, we go there and feel one with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We go to the native Indians or wherever it is or maybe British or German or whatever it is. I'll tell you what, friends. We're not just a not we're not fractured because of your background or where you come from. &gt;&gt; That's not our citizenship. Our citizenship is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Where you're heading and you're in a grand marathon today. &gt;&gt; You're in a grand marathon today. And some of us got some age on us and we're a lot closer to that finish line than others. And then when one completes, you're going to have to pray for me because you might be hearing the roast might burn. &gt;&gt; But when one completes the marathon, I've seen some pictures. Oh, and they they complete the marathon. Oh, there's congratulations and they're greeted by well-wishers and and uh uh they feel a sense of I made it. Some of them almost collapsing on the end. I see a band of people coming home &gt;&gt; and a host welcome welcome them. They finished their marathon to run another one. We're in this one the grand one and we'll never run it again. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God and so run. I say to you today, so run. If this would be my last message, don't forget these words. So run. Don't let the words of Paul to the Galatians ever be your portion where he says you did run well. What happened &gt;&gt; at one time? You did run well. You got a off. We're not a 100yard dasher. &gt;&gt; We're not a 1500 meter uh runner. We're in a grand marathon. &gt;&gt; We're in the marathon of life. By God's grace, Brother Brandham was nearing. Brother Brandham was nearing the finish line of his marathon. I'm very deeply moved. You've heard me speak of the last four messages. I want you to think the way God has been dealing with me. God Almighty, creator of heavens and earth that came down visibly, had a photograph taken, a moving pillar of fire, stood there at the platform, spoke out of his mouth things that a man's mind couldn't even for years and years and hundreds and thousands of times. And now God himself, it's not Malachi now that he's going to through Malachi spoke his final words. Behold, I send Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. And he sealed it off. Then nothing was said. &gt;&gt; 400 years. 400 years of silence while generations came and children were born and men and women died and went to their sephilurs or their graves. But God said nothing because he determined he would be silent &gt;&gt; until an angel would come. Said the virgin, you're going to conceive. Said to Joseph, you'll call his name Jesus. You'll call his name Emanuel. He'll save his people from their sins. Now we come to the end, the revealing. this same son of man being revealed. You know, we go back 1965. God took them 1965. They've never duplicated that ministry. There was nothing like it prior to it, and there's been nothing like it since. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to take what was laid down. You're going to have to take what what God left and I can assure you God left sufficient to get you through your marathon to the final line. And as he was as he was approaching the end of his now he I would take maybe to uh December the 5th on we preached the rapture spoke the rapture and then December the 5th things that are to be things that are to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then December the 6th, modern events made clear by the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And they were all on on the 5th, things that are to be. He said, "I want this now. This service will tie into last night's meeting." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which was rapture. And it's the only time in all of his 33 years that he called it the order, the order of this great rapture. That's when he went into the shout, the voice, and the trumpet. &gt;&gt; That was the order of the rapture. &gt;&gt; And then the very next night, things that are to be. And I took when he gave the order of the rapture, I thought he's got maybe two, four, six more hours. Six more hours. that that voice is going to speak before it's silenced. Six more hours. What is God going to say in those six hours? And I have been pouring over back and forth and back and forth, not with the view that this was his second last message or his third last message or what I've been pouring back and forth over it and letting my soul have a relationship. Almighty God, these were your last six hours, your last eight hours of speaking and going to lay it down and it'll be on tape and it'll be in book. But this is never been a ministry like this and never has been one since and neither will there be. This is a ministry the consummation of the ages. What is it that you're saying? And let those things come and resound deep within my soul. Let it echo out until I grasp what it is that's happening &gt;&gt; because now we have moved on from that. The last four messages. You've heard some of these things before, but you haven't heard them in the context or like I'm saying it this morning. He took a very strange subject text for the rapture message and yet it's e extremely revealing. Brother Brennham starts in Psalms the 27th chapter. And now this marathon and when I say rapture, rapture is not so much it it's not a like a finishing line. It's not a like a certain spot, but the rapture is actually an existence. The rapture is actually a place. And I want you now to to hold this in your mind. A place for the very next night. And I'm going back and forth, but you'll you'll be acquainted with it before I'm done. The very next night in things that are to be, he goes to John the 14th chapter. Let not your heart be troubled. Now, Jesus was coming right to the end of his ministry. And brother Brandham says he he doesn't know in a few days he's gone. He hasn't said anything. But in that in that message, he's saying of Jesus now, his life and his ministry is fixing to end on earth. It is as though he is actually speaking his own life because his life also because he's the vessel through whom this son of man of 2,000 years ago is going to is now going to is expressing himself and has expressed himself and has spoke his word. And the very life now of the vessel is also going to be extinguished in a few days. And he said his life was fixing to end here on earth. So he's saying to his disciples, I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place, I will come again and receive you unto myself. And I said, now his life also is fixing to end here on earth. Oh God, let me catch what it is you're saying. David has said this in part of the scripture which we read out of Psalms 27. He said, "Though a host," this is the third verse, "Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. And though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Listen closely now. There isn't a person here. I've talked to too many of you, even younger and older. And and and what what David, the Bible tells us, was a man of war. He knew what war was. He knew what conflict. There isn't a person within the sound of my voice. But if what if you were to to uh uh enumerate the things that that you have surrounding you, there are times in our life, sometimes more than others, but have you thought and if you could analyze the the burdens and dig deep down into your heart and down into the dark crevices of your heart and begin to enumerate and there are certain things you could think about even now that would make you feel heavy inside because there's there are there are family situations uations and there are perhaps financial situations and all kinds of things that are too complex to even sort out but somehow the whole the whole uh uh uh the whole scene the whole scenario is like as though there's been an encampment and the and the scripture uses the word David uses the word that there's a host though a host should encamp about me and the host actually is a camp of armed company an armed army My friends, while we're in this race, I can tell you there is an armed camp and it's called the powers of darkness. &gt;&gt; We are not called to a picnic. &gt;&gt; We are called to a warfare. &gt;&gt; And there is an army. If things in our lives just go along relatively easy, I'd be more concerned about that than if you said, "This morning, I'm in the battle of my life. I'm in the battle of I never dreamed I'd be in such a battle as we're in today." And the more you the more you uh uh forcefully take and run this race that I'm speaking about, the more you'll feel the heat of the enemy on your heels. And David said, &gt;&gt; "Though host should encamp against me, those that host, this camp of armed host and encamp shall encamp against me." The scripture is the word that he uses, though this host, though this armed camp, lay siege, try to lay siege to me uh against me. And that's what the word is. And the prophet said, "You will fight for every inch of ground." That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You plan to make some headway today. &gt;&gt; You plan to make even one inch today, you're going to fight for it. &gt;&gt; You got to be resolved in your mind. You're going to fight for every inch of ground that you that you gain spiritually speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and uh and uh Brother Brand refers to Jo, excuse me, to Joshua. He he said Joshua was told by God everywhere the souls of your feet steps that I have given you that God has given us these things but nevertheless and he said footsteps meant possession and every promise in the in the book is the believers. It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; You got to fight every inch of the way and if you haven't got any fight in you then get out of the game. Do &gt;&gt; you believe that also? &gt;&gt; This is for a fight. &gt;&gt; This is a battle. &gt;&gt; This is a race. &gt;&gt; And you have to have a resolve within you. I'm crossing that finish line. And the finish line I'm speaking about is not a certain time on the calendar. It's not a certain day in the calendar. It's not even at your death. That's not what it is. This message has been laid out. The word of God has been laid out so that you can enter into another realm. And this isn't some, you know, uh, pie in the sky kind of thing. Jesus, when he was coming near to the end of his ministry and his life here on earth, the disciples, they wanted him to escape the hardship. And Jesus said some words, and I I'm praying that God give you revelation. I I I tell you, I have pondered these things very very deeply. And I don't want to say it lightly this morning. The disciples said they wanted him to escape these hardships. And Jesus had one answer and he used it more than once. How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled? In other words, he was now living out what God in flesh, as I said to you last night, brother Mickey, God in flesh was living out and he was enacting the actual spoken word that God, the same God, spoke through men. Right? &gt;&gt; He was making himself bound and subject to what he spoke through the mouths of human men &gt;&gt; through the mouths of Isaiah &gt;&gt; through the 53rd chapter. Now, Christ himself is bringing himself subject to that prophecy concerning himself and he's walking directly into the spoken word for his hour, for his moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God spoke it through mortal men. God spoke it again through mortal men. He began to speak about the rapture. It's not a date on the calendar. It is a it is an experience for the believer. And as he goes into things that are to be. He speaks about the things that we eat. He speaks about how your mother craved for certain things when you were in the womb and she wanted certain strange foods because you in that form and you had not even come to be in fellowship with your father and mother yet. But you were calling for those vitamins. And so she would eat and and the parents would pinch and so they get the right kind of thing so that the babe that was to come so that you would have the kind of body you're supposed to have in this life. And he was saying then God will call a preacher to the pulpit and begin to say certain things. And it is it is your eternal body that's actually calling right now. And that groaning is in you because you are going there. And these words have been spoken now have been spoken through the mouth of a prophet to give you what you need for that place. Jesus himself walked into it. He walked into it. When Jesus went to the cross, that's why he could say, "You can't take my life from me. No man takes my life from me. I lay it down." And you know the prophet said, "You know what brother Brandham said? You can say that &gt;&gt; you can say that &gt;&gt; no man takes my life from me." Hallelujah. I'm expending my life the way that God has ordained me to expend it. And furthermore, when my last breath comes, it's not the last breath. I simply take another breath into another world &gt;&gt; and into another body. &gt;&gt; But it's just not some thought. It's just not some, you know, uh, ray of hope up in the future. That body is being formed even now. Because what is in you and what is in me, it's that body that's calling for it. And the Holy Spirit is saying to you, believe it. Believe it. Believe it. Confirming it to you. believe it &gt;&gt; because your eternal home is calling for it &gt;&gt; and he will call some minister and that's why you can remember back and say I remember when you know brother Lance or I remember messages he preached a long time ago they feed my soul brother Tom has preached brother Diddier has preached these brethren brother Ernie brother brother brother Andy's John Andy's and heard of the services the people been blessed just recently uh you you know what it If you take and say, "Wow, that was a wonderful service. Oh, I just remember what he said. That was just so great." And so on and so forth. You're missing it. It didn't come for a temporary blessing. It came because there's an eternal home and an eternal body calling for that word &gt;&gt; and calling for you to believe it. David said, "And now we won't attempt to finish, but I'm going to start to get into it now." &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. And though in host should camp and camp against me, my heart shall not fear. The war should rise against me. Listen, now here's the key. And I spoke on it once. In this I will be confident. What? Not just in God. In this I will be confident. And the next line begins to interpret what this is. One thing. One thing. Not two, one thing I have desired of the Lord and that will I seek after. &gt;&gt; That's what he's confident in. &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me, though Satan should try to lay siege to my life and my soul and my family or or the church or whatever more. Though he tried to lay siege to me and though I can just feel the powers of darkness pressing in, in this one thing I'll be confident. And that will I seek after. &gt;&gt; His confidence wasn't in his talents or his gift or what he knew or what he he memorized or or the retention of his mind or how much he could quote or how much he could remember or how gifted he was. His his he was confident in one thing. I have one desire &gt;&gt; and that will I seek after and here it is that I may dwell &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord, &gt;&gt; not his house, not a better position, not a better job, not to have something come out successful. This one thing, this is why I'm confident today. I desire to dwell in his house. I desired. &gt;&gt; Here's a man that's a king. Here's a man with royalty. Here's a man with armies. Here's a man with responsibilities. Here's a man that is God is using now a prophet in the end time to show us the way. Saying this is rapture. And rapture is actually a change of dwelling places. You've heard me say that. Now I want to say it and emphasize it in a certain context. Rapture is a change of dwelling place. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. And the prophet said it is this same life &gt;&gt; in another place. &gt;&gt; The same life. &gt;&gt; You have eternal life now. &gt;&gt; And it's simply going to go on from here. You're going to take one step and one foot will be in time. One foot will be immortality and the next one will go into immortality. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham went beyond the curtain of time, he he told me personally there was zero no no sensation whatsoever. Had no feeling of movement, no feeling. He was instantly 20 25 feet from his body with his hands behind his head saying had just finished saying Bill Brandham you're 52 you're past 50 he says some places and if you're going to do anything for God you better get up and get going you don't know how it made me feel at 27 28 years old when I heard him say that and know he'd spoken to hundreds of thousands and millions of people and seen all the miracles if you're going to do anything for God I said oh God, where do I stand? All we can be. We are what we are. Saw millions coming. Said, "This is strange. This is strange." He had prayed. He thought he'd just see, you know, going over that, you know, he'd see Brother Neville or something. It just be a spirit. It wouldn't be anybody he could shake hands with. He saw his hands, bit his finger, pinched his hand. He went like that to me. He pinched my hand. He said, "Brother Eddie, I had a body." And he knew he was baldheaded. And he felt right away. His hair, his head was full of hair. Had black curly hair. Head full of hair. Then sees the women running first, running, screaming, "Our brother, our precious brother. with long hair and robes and they ran down. I can tell you there was nothing skin tight there. &gt;&gt; There was nothing. There was none of these what they wear socks for blouses today. &gt;&gt; It's a shame. &gt;&gt; It's a disgrace. And there's none of that over there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; They're dressed in their gowns acceptable in the presence of God come running. He said, "Who are these?" &gt;&gt; They're your people. &gt;&gt; My people? Are they brats? No, they're your converts to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's many that are right here. I can tell you from that time when the word of God began to come out of his mouth to my soul and the word of God took on new life and new meaning and it prospered in my heart and my life. Hallelujah. And you can say the same thing. Oh, the peace that he's given you. Oh, how God has delivered you. Look at the liberty, you people from the colonies. Look where you were and look where you are. &gt;&gt; Look at the bondage you had, Brother David. Look at the bondage you had. &gt;&gt; You don't even know who you're sitting beside today. Redeemed, &gt;&gt; coming from the depths of sin, &gt;&gt; out of the prison house of the devil. Oh, hear the cries of the shackled, but we hear another voice. Those that were chained are free. [Applause] And my purpose this morning is to be what I can be to all people that I might win some &gt;&gt; and take some across and as many as possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Those of you from broken homes, we know it. My wife came from broken home. Some of you children live without a mother or father. We know what it is. And I get in counseling with you said, "We've been there. We've been there. My wife lived years without a mother and a father who's a businessman and could have had most anything she wanted, but she had no desire for it. She had desire play the piano at church, sing at church, be with the saints of God. Hallelujah. And I'm glad she went to brother Brandham's meeting as a girl, 12 years old, and had him say a few words to her. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I don't say those things because I have any any human pride over it at all. I thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; Scripture says Paul left his kindred. I did too. Abraham left his kindred. Get up and leave them. I did also, but not willingly. God took my mother. Didn't know what a mother was. And my father had to go because of economics and drifted and shifted from pillar to post from a boy less than eight years old. But God used it. &gt;&gt; God gave me so I don't have that such an emotional attachment. Able to feel a certain amount of just being identified with other people in their situations and not feeling such a tie. And people say, "How do you go? How do you travel so God God made the vessel that way?" He does things his own way for his own purpose. He You find yourself in a certain situation. God saw your footsteps. He knew how it was going to be. And he has ordained it to be that way. And you're learning things even now in your present walk, what you're going through right now. And you won't know the benefit till you're down the road. But I say God's in control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? He says, "And now I want you to notice very closely. One thing I've desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord." I'm going to go into these in some depth. Says that I might dwell in the house of the Lord, which is a dwelling. I want to be in the habitation of God. of the Lord. It can also resp speak figuratively of the human bodies or the household of faith. I tell you when I'm away I miss the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with the structure. It has to do with the people that we look upon and a and see a smile on the face and feel a grip in the hand and and and and and anticipate and see something coming from the soul of that individual to another person. God bless you brother. I prayed for you. God bless you sister. Welcome back. Welcome to the congregation. We do what we can. That to me is a household. And David said, "Oh, I want to dwell in the house of God. I want to be with them." How many here? I don't even have to ask you. That's where you want to dwell. &gt;&gt; You're going to go home today and close the door. And some of you live alone. Some of you got your families. You'll instantly have responsibilities. Mothers will have to put food on the table. Uh but there's a land beyond the river. And it's not some pie in the sky, my brother, my sister. It's a real place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're preparing for it this morning. &gt;&gt; June the 26th, I believe it is, 2005. You're actually preparing for it. And something in you is calling for. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I have something in me. I cannot describe it. I can't explain it. But it's groaning. It's calling. And God is giving you. You don't see it now. It's beyond your eyesight. But in another realm, God is preparing a place for you. And how he prepared the place is by the word he sent here. &gt;&gt; It's a creative word. &gt;&gt; That's swimming water. &gt;&gt; If you want to think about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word is here. &gt;&gt; What you believe here &gt;&gt; is what you'll have over there. &gt;&gt; You give a cup of cold water here, you won't lose your reward over there. Have you done anything for any believers? Have you done something for believers? Of course you have. But when you did it, you just maybe did it involuntarily, just almost instinctively. You just did it. You thought, "Oh, you know, I'll just do this. I didn't realize it was in heaven." The answer was in heaven. You had a groan. You had a desire. You had You come to church. Oh, God. It's just uh I don't know what to do in this situation. and so on. And maybe the situation God allowed the situation. God allowed the hardship to cause and to give you a groaning inside because it's not the hardship. You got your mind on the hardship. You got your mind on the adversity. You got the mind on your difficulty, your problem. God has his mind on where you're going to live eternally. &gt;&gt; And because of the hardship, you come burdened. You come, you come sober with sobriety to the church. You come and you sit in your minds on God. Oh God, uh the answer I I need some answers. I need some help. And God is squeezing you in that situation. So that when the word is preached, you'll believe it &gt;&gt; because God is not so much concerned about your difficulty here. He's concerned about where you're going to live over there. And Jesus said, "I go, &gt;&gt; the son of man, I go to prepare a place for you." That's why he left the word. And the New Testament was not written, but the New Testament now was written after him. And Jesus took a cup, the cup of his blood, and the emblem of his blood. And he and he he said, "I have desired with a great desire to have this last Passover with you." And and the bread is my body. And he says, "This is the cup." of the New Testament in my blood cuz the New Testament was still in him. &gt;&gt; And he did not drink it. He gave it to them and said, "Drink ye all of it." &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ, the church of called out ones are going to fulfill the New Testament. And so everything that's in the New Testament and the preaching of the word that comes from the word of God is for the believers at this time. You believe it? Not to help you through this life. I want you to get that out of your mind for a change. Not to help you through this life, but it is the same Christ who spoke that word that's preparing you a place &gt;&gt; and preparing you simultaneously for that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the only thing you're going to take with you is your character. &gt;&gt; Just think of it. You're only going to take your character. You're not going to take your nice clothes. You're not going to take your wardrobe. You're not going to take any of these things. You're only going to take your character. And when you shed all of this behind, I tell you what, friends, we want to be wellformed, well mature men and women of God. I long to dwell in the house of God. The house of God is something that was is established when David said to dwell in the house of the Lord saying I want to dwell in your household. I want to be where you live. Brother Bram says God lives in a house. Nothing like you could imagine. So don't try to think of what it's like. But David said, "Whatever it is, I want to dwell in your house." &gt;&gt; And I want to dwell with your people. &gt;&gt; That's what Ruth said to Naomi. Your God will be my God. And she couldn't understand him. But whoever he is, he's going to be my God. &gt;&gt; And where you live, that's where I'm going to live. And where you die, that's where I'm going to die. &gt;&gt; And David is saying, I want to live in your household. And he's actually declaring because your household is established. He could see he's getting older. He could see that armies are around him and this kingdom may not last. And this that I'm so I have royal charge over may not be here in a few years. But oh, there's one that'll never pass away. There's a kingdom and there's a palace and there's a dwelling place that'll never pass away. Oh God, this one thing I'm confident in that I desire to come to that house. &gt;&gt; And you may, whatever your status is, and we're all different. We have different backgrounds, different cultures, completely different. Some may have a nice job, some you may be without a job. Some may be healthy and full of vibrant health today. And others of you may be sick. And there may be some at home laying in a bed. And I think of our sister Marge Miller. Oh God, this house is like a prison. &gt;&gt; How she'd love to be sitting right here. But there's another house and it's established. &gt;&gt; And it has continuity. &gt;&gt; It will never perish. &gt;&gt; It will never be taken down. And the word he used house is it's made permanent. Amen. &gt;&gt; When David said, "Your house, something established, something fixed, something permanent. I don't want something that's passing." My brother, my sister, I don't care where you live. I don't care what you drive. I don't care anything about your job or anything else. But there's one thing. There's there's something within the soul of every seed of God that's a believer. I want to come. I've got to come to that place that's permanent. That place that is established. That place that shall never decay. That place that no man can ever take down. Oh, I hope that you're with me today. That's a place. Next thing he says to behold your beauty, the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. Now we have house. Now we have temple. Now he wants to be in a temple. We could say it's also a dwelling place and the temple to inquire in his temple. He says I I he'd like to seek and search and consider and to reflect. And it's always notice notice please. It's his temple, his tabernacle, his pavilion, his house. David's not saying, "Oh, bless me here. Bless me in my bless me in my palace. Bless me in my kingdom. Bless me where I dwell. Bless me in my work. Give me wisdom." No, he's saying, "I want to go to your house. &gt;&gt; I want to be in your pavilion. I want to inquire in your temple. &gt;&gt; And brother Brham is taking all of this &gt;&gt; which is a description he's pulling from the scripture. And I think of how Jesus walked and that was his last his last text in the in the in the prophecy. He said modern events made clear by the prophecy Luke the 24th chapter when Jesus himself drew near and walked with the disciples and they didn't know who it was. And the scripture says he spoke to them out of all of the prophets and the psalms. &gt;&gt; He was there in the psalms and now the revealing of the son of man. Here comes a vindicated prophet and he's only got us six eight hours left to preach and those things that God is going to say to you and I and then he's going to be silent &gt;&gt; and people are going to put it on their shelves and think it's just a sermon. &gt;&gt; You're missing it. It is the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; that's saying his last words &gt;&gt; in that sense. &gt;&gt; Yes, he can speak to you individually and he does speaks to us individually. I'm talking about a word to the church, a word to the bride. &gt;&gt; Says, I want to seek and I want to inquire in his temple. And this temple is a sanctuary. this temple. The word sanctuary, we call this a sanctuary. But the word sanctuary, which is in the Hebrew, is not just a sanctuary. He says, "Now I want to inquire. I want to seek. I want to consider. I want to reflect in your sanctuary." Even when you come here friends, I don't know whether you're here to say who's here or see what's happening. Why are you here? But David said, I want to come into your sanctuary. This is another aspect that the prophet is saying is it it is a part it's an aspect of revelation of rapture. It's part of the rapture going to be in a rapture. It's going to be people who reflect not on the fault that I see in my brother or the fault I hear in my sister. I'm not going to sit in the church and reflect on the last gossip I heard. That's going to do nothing for your body on the other side. You got to be here. you've got to be in this sanctuary. Say, "I want to be in your sanctuary." &gt;&gt; When you come in that and you're thinking about your job, you're thinking about what you're going to do tomorrow or you're thinking about uh uh something else or who you're going to invite or who you're going to eat with. That has nothing to do with it. You can do that in this sanctuary, but that's not the sanctuary that that the prophet of God is talking about. He's talking about a sanctuary called the rapture. &gt;&gt; I asked this congregation, is that where you're going? And this sanctuary, it comes from another word and it is to prevail. &gt;&gt; To overcome, &gt;&gt; to endure, &gt;&gt; and to have power. &gt;&gt; David is saying, let me take my core off. &gt;&gt; David is saying, I want to come into your sanctuary. I want to reflect. I want to consider. &gt;&gt; I want to think about the things that you would think about. &gt;&gt; And I have come here in the sanctuary of God. I desire that sanctuary because there I overcome. There I am empowered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You come here this morning and I know many of you and I'm I'm shouting it out. You come here with your defeat and you go out with your defeat. You want to say in the name of the Lord, I deny that defeat. I have come into the sanctuary to be victorious. I've come into the sanctuary to be empowered. I've come into this sanctuary to go out and overcome her. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; that my friend &gt;&gt; is part and parcel of rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say things you never heard me say before, &gt;&gt; but I would say if a person's going to live their life and you're going to come in with your defeat and go out with your defeat and come under with your defeat and go out with your defeat, if you continue on, you will not go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; You cannot go in the rapture because the rapture is not made for that kind of life. You're living now what you're going to be over there. &gt;&gt; This life now you're going to live this life because you if I said who has eternal life, you'd all raise your hand. That's the life that you're going to live. &gt;&gt; The life you have now. He says we're going to work. We're going to live. We're going to we're going to be with one another. We're going to eat. We're going to be happy. So, we're going to eat. Yeah. I'm going to eat off the tree of life. I'm going to eat the fruit. I don't know. You say, "Well, how does it work?" I don't care how it works. I'm not even worried about how it works. &gt;&gt; What kind of body is it? It's going to be a glorious body. &gt;&gt; Not like this vile body that I have now. &gt;&gt; But it's rapture. That's part of rapture. And the prophet is actually being he's being moved out of he's being moved out of his his his labor and life on earth. And he says of Jesus 2,000 years ago, he said he said these things, behold, I go I I go and prepare a place a place another dwelling place. In chapter 14 of of John, he's back in the same He's back in the same theme. &gt;&gt; He said it ties into last night. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare, I'll come back and I'll receive you under myself that where I am, there you may be also. And here now, don't think I've gone over the edge. here now that I would say the most spectacular &gt;&gt; of ministry not fast not attaching it to a man as such it was Christ &gt;&gt; and now he's directing those that will believe &gt;&gt; he's directing to a certain it's the same son of man walking with us speaking to us out of the prophets and the psalms &gt;&gt; that's what he's trying to tell them in in Luke 23 it's me Amen. &gt;&gt; It's It's not another person. It's me. It's just that they couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get ahead of myself to overcome and to have power to be able. &gt;&gt; That's his temple. I've got to have just another few minutes &gt;&gt; to be able to be able to endure &gt;&gt; for the rapture. You may well have to endure. But let me tell you, the rapture is not it's not a certain point in time. Oh, when the rapture comes, I'll tell you right now, you are part of the rapture already. And uh the final that we're all looking for is when this body is changed and the atoms are changed and there's a sweep goes over us. And the sweep will happen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; And we'll all be changed &gt;&gt; and we begin to mingle and meet with those that are resurrected. &gt;&gt; I fully intend if I'm standing here, if I'm alive, I look for it. I look for people. I actually look in their face and wonder now is that could be somebody that is resurrected that I'm having difficulty recognizing. They knew Jesus just a few days ago, but now they couldn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; Mary couldn't recognize him. She thought he was the gardener. a young man working in a garden, keeping the garden which we are taught or they indicates the the garden uh the garden the garden tomb. I look for it. But if it's not tomorrow, and as time goes on, you're going to get a lot older, you're going to say, "Oh, look at look at old brother and sister Biscal, man. They're all wrinkled up and he's on a cane and she's in a walker or whatever more and hope their kids looking after them." Well, when it gets to be that time, just go and look in a mirror. One thing's for sure, you went down the road, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother McGriff, I was with him once. He was way up in his 80s, I guess, late 80s. He's always gun barrel gun barrel straight, you know, and he was I just so admired him and just the way he would preach and he stayed slim and all my just admired him. He said, "You know, my wife, I took my wife down. We went down to the down to the shopping center to get some groceries, he says. And and I finally decided what I would go in. So he says, "I I saw the reflection of a man, you know, in the in the in the shining in the mirror. He could just see it in the in the window, you know, on a nice sunny day." He could see the reflection of a man. He said he was all bent over and moving along like that. And he said thought, "Man, I felt sorry for him." And I had another look and it was me. Sorry, folks. That's just the way it goes. But when David was saying, when he was saying, I want to be in your temple and not only your sanctuary, but I will be empowered there. &gt;&gt; I will receive enduring power there. &gt;&gt; So that whatever comes &gt;&gt; my way, &gt;&gt; I will I will be victorious over it. &gt;&gt; Because I receive overcoming power in your sanctuary, not this one. Yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you want me to stop, folks, you better start praying right now. &gt;&gt; Our brother Sir is right here from New Zealand. He and his wife June and daughter Gracie. I didn't even welcome him. He's going to be preaching tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come and lay it in, Brother Howard. I I hope I have the people primed up. And then he goes on to say he'll inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble. Hello. You that have maybe almost succumbed at times to your trouble. You that wondered if you'd get through this dark tunnel. And he may be sitting here right this morning saying, "Is there light at the end of the tunnel? I haven't seen light at the end of the tunnel. He says, "In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion." And because this, listen closely now, because this is the rapture theme. The trouble he's talking about is not your hardship at this moment. Not your hardship. It can it can refer to that, but that's not what the prophet's talking about. In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. His pavilion, not some man-made pavilion, but his pavilion. Because the time of trouble that brother Brandon preached for and that Jesus spoke about and that David was inspired by the Holy Spirit to say in the time of trouble, that spirit coming up out of him in the time of trouble, what God, listen to me, what God is seeking to preserve you from is the tribulation. &gt;&gt; That will be the time of trouble. I'm getting up in years. But many of you and I expect to see him come. I expect to I expect to depart this world. But you may well live beyond this time. And I can tell you that all the makings all the makings for the tribulation are right now present with us. Nothing has to happen except the Holy Spirit to be to to release them. Can you imagine? Can you imagine where this wickedness is going to go once the restraint of God is gone? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what is going to happen? You're not going to want to You wouldn't even want to go to school. You wouldn't want to work any You wouldn't want to go to the shopping center. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't dare want to go to a restaurant. I tell you what, it'll be perversion of all perversion. It will be iniquity and sin and blasphemy &gt;&gt; and God's going to destroy it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With a holy fire, you don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; He preached so you wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; And this is part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; His house is part of the rapture. I want to go where he dwells. &gt;&gt; His his pavilion, his temple is part of the rapture. And now his pavilion. He said in Psalms 31:21, don't turn to it. I'm just going to read it. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence and from the pride of man. Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion, from the strife of tongues. Exodus 33 and22. And it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of the rock and I will cover thee. I'm going to going to close I think on this on this pavilion but it is the one of the most moving for me. So don't let yourself be wearied. his pavilion. It's a thicket or in the old English terms a lair. That right, brother Roger? A lair which we don't use. It's another word covert or covert. It's a covering but it's also called a booth. And so when the children of Israel were coming out, they had the feast, they had the seven feasts and every one of them referred to Jesus Christ. And the last feast is the feast of tabernacles. And in that feast, God commanded Moses. Said, "Have all the children now of Israel, build a booth out of boughs." That's why they call it a thicket. You'll take these branches and you'll have these boughs and for seven days, because there's seven church ages, for seven days, you live in that. You'll leave your permanent residence that you have here as you're traveling through the wilderness and you'll be in this little booth for seven days. When I was in Israel, my wife and I on the trip the church just sent us, uh, they gave us a room and there was a balcony, quite a large balcony, and they said, "Please excuse, please excuse the the tent that's out there, the covering that's out there, because it's we're coming to the Feast of Tabernacles." And we had to have it ready because people come here from all over the world and rent these rooms and we've got to have the booth for them, &gt;&gt; right? And God said that booth is going to remind them. I want to remind them every year. This is a temporary place. &gt;&gt; And my brother, my sister, we need to be reminded on a continual basis. Don't get attached to this down here. This is a temporary place. &gt;&gt; Everything's temporary. Everything's transient. Everything's moving. Don't get attached to it. &gt;&gt; It's not worth it. &gt;&gt; And that booth also happens to be this one right here. &gt;&gt; You got a temporary booth, friends. Brother Bram says in one of these last messages he said said he may be sitting here and it could be within 5 minutes you'll be a corpse and it could be a young person could be me in five minutes you could be a corpse he says and then again in five minutes we could all be in glorymen Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he was speaking. That's why the Lord Jesus was uttering these words through there and trying to tell us what the rapture is. And so now David, he has covered he has covered the the the temple. He has covered the house of the Lord and the temple and everyone is a as a facet of the rapture itself. And now he has come. He's come to the pavilion. Oh God, I want to end this constant movement. I want to end this journey. I want to end being a transient in this wilderness of this world. I want to end with that. I want to come to your pavilion. Let me come to your booth because it will never be moved. It will never be taken down. &gt;&gt; That's part of the rapture. And the very next night now, he starts giving word to the people. And that Pentecostal people, they didn't want to accept it. They didn't know they were right then turning down the rapture. Right? &gt;&gt; And if you were with them today, they'd be believing, "Oh, I'm going to the Lord's going to come and I'm going in the rapture." And they already rejected. They rejected it right then. When God's messenger was actually giving them, shall I call the recipe, he was giving them in the in a childlike way, telling them, he was telling them just like your body in the womb of your mother's craving for it. He said, "You're you're here and you got a groaning in you and God is giving you &gt;&gt; what you have need of for that home, this this booth." And the word the word is it's a a rude a rude temporary shelter. And the scripture says of it, he shall change our vile v I l e our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body. Hallelujah. He'll change this vile body that it might be transformed or fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he's able to subdue all things unto himself. And the vile body is that of a lower state lower. You've been brought down. And the scripture says in Hebrews says how he made man. And he said it made him a little lower than the angels. And then it speaks of Christ. And Christ came and took on a body of flesh and was made also a little lower than the angels. Made exactly the same cuz he had to be born of a woman and die on the cross. You talk about a vile body. Look at you. You're nice. When I even think of Christ, I'm ashamed of the suit I'm wearing. Nobody describes him like the prophet of God describes him going on the way to the on the way to Calvary with his beard torn out and the thorns in his brow and he allowed that body not 30 33 years old he looked 50. It's always a compliment they say how old are you? You tell them, "Oh, you don't look that old." But here is Christ. Like a 50-year-old man, stoop shouldered, not even strong enough to carry his cross, bleeding profusely. And human man's spit, hanging on his beard, going to Calvary. How he took that body and became so vile. It's a body of humiliation. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a vile body. It's a lower body. It's a lower state. And the scripture says he took on the form of man &gt;&gt; so that we could take on the form of God. &gt;&gt; He became us &gt;&gt; so you could become him. And this is part of the rapture. Part of the rapture, my friend, my brother, my sister. Otherwise, we're sitting here today wasting our time. you're wasting your time coming and I'm wasting my time preaching. And I tell you that God sent a vindicated voice to instruct us and to tell us exactly. And here he's coming to the end of his life laying down the the the stepping stones for the rapture. And don't let us sit here and say, "Oh, it's something, you know, off in the future." Here the Lord Jesus Christ trying to get you to realize that you're stepping into it now by the life you live now by the victories you win now. Hallelujah. You're stepping into it now. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I want to I want to go to your booth. I want to dwell in your pavilion." And the prophet is telling us, you follow this, you'll come to a permanent pavilion that'll never be taken down. It won't be temporary anymore. And it won't be vile. It won't be of that type. But the booth also is fenced. It's you're hedged in. You're fenced in. I thought of that just the other day down in I believe it was Seattle Tacoma. There's a woman, she's 90 years old. She's spry and just last week she walked two miles every day from the senior citizens home. She walked two miles and some man took and struck her to take her purse and took her purse from her and all her identification and whatever she had in her purse and struck her to the ground and shattered her hip. and they made a a nurse and the woman spoke and I thought it was so remarkable. The thing that she resented the most is he stole my freedom. He stole my freedom. He's made me a prisoner. In these last maybe months or year or two of her life, he's made me a prisoner. She wasn't so concerned about her money, but he's made me a prisoner. And I've seen I've witnessed and you don't know what goes through my heart to stand by the bed of someone and I see their life ebbing away and I realize they're a prisoner. They're a prisoner of this body. And I thought of the words of this song. This house of clay is but a prison. Bars of bone. Hold my soul. But the doors of flesh are going to burst wide open. Hallelujah. When I move to my pavilion in the sky, not his, not mine, but his. &gt;&gt; Let me be hedged about in his. &gt;&gt; When the angels come, set my spirit free. I'll take my flight like a mighty a eagle when the hills of home are calling me. Why did the messenger preach December the 4th rapture? Now, what I want you to do, I want you to get those four messages because I'm going to be on them in the next services. And don't you read them like a book and don't you listen to it as a message. I want you to do what I have been doing, saying, "Oh Lord Jesus, it is you that's preparing me to leave this temporary place, this vile body. Now you speak to me. you speak to me what you want me to hear and let me be prepared. Let me be made ready for the next words. And and just see friends, if there's a groaning that's going on, there's a desire within you. Because as soon as there is and you feel and you sense that desire, I want you I want you to think immediately of the place that he's preparing for you. &gt;&gt; Immediately because it's that place that is causing that desire. &gt;&gt; Have you followed that? It's that place the same as it was when you were in the womb of your mother. You didn't know nothing about it. Maybe you've walked, you've gone to church, you've heard many, many sermons. You didn't quite realize it. But today, I feel urged of the Holy Spirit. I don't know. I may not be with you that much longer. I don't know. And I have felt strangely moved for me to say what needs to be said. And the most important thing for you to hear is how God has prepared for you to leave this place &gt;&gt; and move and take that final step. Tell you what, there's going to be more people disappointed than there is that's going to be pleased. Few there be that find it. Make your calling and election sure. Don't let anything anything stand your way. And if you get the least little twinge in your heart about something that you're doing or something that you're allowing, the least little twinge in your heart, forsake it immediately. &gt;&gt; Cut it off immediately. I should have had a larger amen out of that. Forsake it immediately. It's not worth it. And let us enter in to the kingdom. I have a song. Probably most of you may not know it, but I want to say it in closing. And our musicians, please. Wonder, brother Gary, would you give my wife the cordless? [Music] It's a 2406 near to the heart of God. How many know it? Not that many. I'd like everybody. This is what the words have been on my heart for days now. There is a place there is a place there is a place of quiet rest that is near to the heart of God. A place where sin cannot molest is near to the heart of God. I pray this congregation, all of you, even if you're here just visiting, maybe you're here for the first time. Maybe you've been here for 30 years. I've been here a long time, but I I want to move right into the inspiration of this hymn. There is a place near to the heart of God. Oh God, let me move into that place that you have prepared for us. Before we sing, let us just bow our heads. Our Lord Jesus, [Music] I'm so glad that you have been with us. And each person would have their own line to fill in, their own space to fill in. They've walked with you for months, for years, or whatever. And Lord, how pleased and how thankful I am with unspeakable thanksgiving for having been able to walk with you [Music] and having been able to walk with your people, [Music] having been privileged to walk with your prophets, having been privileged that these eyes saw saw what they saw and ears have heard what they've heard. And for this congregation, oh God, each one of them, I think of how you called them, how you brought them and how you have tenderly led them. And we're here today, Lord, having come from many different lands and languages and countries. And yet we all can say you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And your voice is so sweet to us, Lord. And I ask that you will take us tenderly. Speak to us, Father, God of Israel, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. [Music] I pray that you'll hear me as I ask that your blessing, your blessing will be upon each precious life, each person, each brother and sister, oh God, each one listening, whether they be in Switzerland or Norway or Africa or New Zealand or wherever they may be, wherever they may have opportunity to hear. Oh God, the services today, bless them, I pray. And Lord, as as we as we sing and as we meditate, we desire to enter into that temple, that tabernacle, that house, that pavilion, yours, oh God. Jesus, in your name, may the service end the way you want it to end. I pray. Shall we stand? [Music] &gt;&gt; There is a place of quiet rest near to the heart of God. A place where sin cannot molest. near to the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. Hold us to wait before thee near to the heart of God. I'll just ask you now to just hold silence. I want my wife to sing please the second verse and we can join her in the chorus. &gt;&gt; There is a place of comfort sweet near to the heart of God. A place where we our savior meet near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. Hold us who wait before for the near to the heart of God. There is a place of full release near to the heart of God. A place where all is joy and peace. near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. Oh wait before thee near to the heart of God. I wonder, brother Gary Stany, would you please come and pray a prayer of blessing upon the people? We're so happy to have you. [Music] You're a good wife, Sister Barbara. They say new friends are like silver, old friends are like gold, and then there's some that are platinum. God bless you, brother Gary. Ask God's bless you on the people, would you? Oh great eternal God, how can we as mortals ever express [Music] what you have done for us? Surely we've been in your presence this morning. Surely we've heard from the throne of God. And surely you have prepared a place for those that are part of your children. Oh eternal God, we are so grateful Lord in your great plan of wisdom knowledge. You knew there would be a group of people right here in the 21st century that were preparing for a rapture. preparing for a translation preparing for a move to a better place. &gt;&gt; And Lord, God, &gt;&gt; it's not one that we pack up to go to, God. &gt;&gt; But it's one we're unpacking to go to. &gt;&gt; It's one, Lord, all we need is you Lord, &gt;&gt; your Holy Spirit will prepare us, Lord, for that land &gt;&gt; and that better place. &gt;&gt; Doing so, Lord. And now, Lord, will you bless the people? And may Lord, as we go, may we keep in mind what we've heard this morning. And may we take those last four messages, as brother Ed has said, and may we look at it in a new way. This was you speaking through your prophet for the last 6 or eight hours and what you had to say was important. And so Lord, may it just be become a part of us, Lord, that we'll know how how to approach you and how to prepare for this rapture. And will you bless your people now and you meet their needs and you go with them. And as we come back tonight, Lord, may the Holy Spirit be here again. And may you bless our brother serv as he ministers and we look forward to hearing him. We ask this in your precious name. And all the glory and the honor and the praise goes unto our Lord Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Gary, thank you. When you read the last four messages, you will conclude with leadership December the 7th. And if you took a summary of that message, it's two men that ended up in two places and that's the end. It's all rapture. In the end, the rich young ruler ends up in a place called hell. [Music] And Moses ends up in a place called heaven &gt;&gt; and stands with Jesus on Mount Transfiguration. That is rapture. A shout for the living. Aren't you glad you've heard it? a voice for the resurrected to resurrect them and a trumpet that will gather those two together &gt;&gt; and go to our place that has been prepared for us. &gt;&gt; Only two places. It's only two. You're going to go to a multitude of places today. But the the marathon I'm talking about, this marathon, hear me, only has two places. only two and that's the marathon you are in and I am praying earnestly that you will cross the line to the one he's prepared for us. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God with you. God bless you. God bless you. [Music]
