We have some testimonies. One from our sister Elizabeth. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis over 15 years ago. Pain and swelling got so bad at times that she could not raise her arms or walk. They said there is no cure. The medicine made her sick. The scriptures say, "A merry heart does good like medicine." Well, recently the preaching of the word has more than touched her heart and soul. And she says, "I have had no pain for months. I believe and give God all the glory." Amen. God bless Elizabeth. Rejoice with you. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Testimony from our brother Al King. Recently, we prayed for a couple expecting a baby. There were some medical concerns. The baby has arrived and is doing well. Thank you for your prayers. And also from the Reika Drokas, we would like to thank the Lord for his hand of protection. Yesterday, Samuel had his right hand caught in a locked trunk. When it was released, there was barely a scratch on the skin. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Just as our brother Peta comes, we have two prayer requests. One from the Esther Heisen family. Please remember sister Marie in South Africa who has stage four tumors in her brain and her lungs. Just asking we would hold sister Marie up in prayer in this time. Amen. And and also can we please pray for total restoration of my two oldest children, Michael and Jillian and Ken. It's from the Moscu family that God would convict them and bring them in the fold is their prayer. Amen. Many of us have loved ones that are on our hearts. So we bind our hearts together with the Moscu family with this prayer request. Brother Peter, why don't you come? If there's a need on your heart, be known with an uplifted hand. God bless you. [Music] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Our most kind gracious heavenly father, it's a privilege once again to be here in your house. We want to come Lord to praise you and magnify their name. We lift your name on high this morning Lord in the world Lord. They are they elevate the sports star Lord but you are more important to us this morning. We bless your mighty name this morning Lord. We glorify thy holy name Lord this morning. Thank you once again, Father, for your presence this morning, Lord. Thank you for brother Ryan, Lord, the atmosphere. Lord, we welcome you this morning. We pray, Father, that you'll come down this morning and speak to us in a very special way, Lord. Speak to the children, speak to the young people and likewise, Lord. Lord, we are expecting great things from you this morning, Lord. We heard about the prayer request this morning. I might just not uh remember it right now, Lord. Just pray that you'll go to every individual, Lord, that has a need this morning, Lord. Just pray they'll touch them, Lord, in any way, any capacity, Lord, that you'll speak to them and Lord, raise them up for your glory and honor. Thank you for the testimony, Lord, of the believers this morning, Lord. Thank you for touching Samuel, Lord, that you uh keep his hand intact, Lord Jesus. We just want to thank you once again, Lord, for uh every single one they here, they come, Lord. They didn't come just for church. We come here expecting that you'll do the most uh exceedingly abundantly for us Lord. Pray for the ministers Lord is waiting to speak this morning. Use him mightily, Lord. Hiding behind the cross.

Why don't you shake one another's hands and greet one another? Amen. You're welcome to have your seats. Brother Darren's going to come share some good news with us. Brother Darren, why don't you go ahead and make your way and I think you have an announcement regarding the message hub. God bless you. You want to take that to the homepage? &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. &gt;&gt; Um, this has been in the makings for quite some time. Um, but kind of persevered and took a little longer than we expected, but I think the the wait I hope is is is well worth it. What we've done is we've uh built a new version of the message hub website and the existing message hub website had a um had some uh you can say restrictions to it. So uh we took the time to uh redesign it, add some new functionality to it. And today we just kind of want to give you uh a little bit of an overview of the new functionality so when people go to the MessageHub website they won't get surprised. Oh, it's all changed. How does this all work? So, uh, we thought it would just be a good idea just to take a few moments and show you some of the new features. Um, one of the ones we did, what the one of the big things we did was the redesign. And if you notice an existing message hub website is kind of a fixed width. So, it's can get quite uh kind of crowded. So, what we did here is because computer screens are now quite wide, we thought, well, let's take advantage of a wide screen. So what we've done now is we the website now takes up the full width of the web browser. So if you have a really wide browser, it takes up the whole width and actually allows you to um see the information a little bit easier. Um we've increased the font size. We've made the page pages uh load a lot quicker. Um so on this uh I should go back to the uh the first tab, Aaron. Translated the translated. There you go. translated names. So, as before, when you first come up, you'll see all the translated uh languages that we have available on the hub. This is not the live database. Um, it doesn't have quite all the same information in it. Um, I think we're about up to about 46 or 47 languages now, getting close to 50. Um, so people have the choice of either searching by their own uh the language in their own name of the language in their own language or for for people who don't speak anything else but English. You can go to the English tab. Let's go there, Aaron. And everything is now in the English language. So if you want to print a message book for yourself or you want to print it for somebody you're witnessing to, you can go here and find their language. Well, let's let's go to um English. This is where most of us would print a book for ourselves at least. And on here, what we've done now is we've we've taken the the list of messages and we've kind of broken it down into segments. So along the top here, we have a new toolbar that where we've added some functionality. Um we have some tabs down here for the different types of formats that are now available. Some of these are existing, some of them are new. Um so under here we have printed books. and print a books or something that you'd want to be able to print and read for yourself or somebody else. We have an option here to read online. So, if you want to just sit at your computer and and read a message, you can do that. And you can also download or listen to a message uh from the message hub as well. So, on the bottom here, you've got a list of all the messages that are available for that particular language. Right now in English, we have 1,084. Um, so you got your reference number, title, location, and when it was that we actually uploaded this message to the um, message hub. So in the list, what we've done to make it easier for people to look and say, are there any new messages? Well, any new message will be at the top of the list. So you don't have to then worry about, you know, hunting and searching for it. Um, and if you want to do a quick search, let's do a, um, we're on audio right now. Aaron, once you type in um 62-0513M and as he types, it filters the list and gives you the specific message that you're looking for. So you don't have to go through all the pages. You can either you can type by the the reference number, the title, or the location. Any way you want to find a message, just type the information that's in the list. Then if we click on that title on the right hand side, it shows you the available formats for that particular tab. Here it's just audio. So you have the option now to be able to just listen to it online or be able to download it. I know some of this stuff is is existing. A lot of you may already know about this, but uh one nice feature that we've added is the ability to actually read and listen at the same time. So if we uh let's go back to read online first and then click on the title. So now on the right hand side it's got a read ic or sorry read online. So you click that Aaron and we just maximize that. So now what we have here is we have at the very top here we have an audio player. Down below we have the text and you can just scroll down. Now one thing that we've done is we want we wanted the site to be easier for you know the masses to be able to read it online. So what we have here is we have a little scroll bar where you can actually adjust the size of the font to make it as big as you want. And then so if you just click on the play button now &gt;&gt; good morning friends. It's a fine morning and good time to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So what we're trying to do here is we're trying to make it to me it's not really a website. This is more of a tool and that's why we kind of re restructured it to make it a more effective tool that more people will be able to benefit from or Okay, let's close that window. Now we're back here. So, but let's let's go to the printed books. Now, there's there are some new formats. They're not all on here yet because this is a new website and the old website didn't accommodate all these new formats. But we have in total, I believe, nine different formats including audio and the online version. And once this is um launched in the next couple of days, we're just uh fixing a couple of little bugs in it, but once it's launched, Sister Beth and the translators and everyone will have lots of work to do to get the new messages uploaded. So right now we've got two types of um message book formats for the printed books and that is metric paper sizes and then the what we call the US paper sizes. The US paper sizes you know your your standard letter size 8 and 1 half by 11 whereas the metric ones are more for the European the Asian countries where they use a different standard for the uh page sizes. So if we uh click on say the US paper size that that's what we use here gives you the option now either to open it or to save it. So if you just want to save it for later use you can do that or you just click on open it downloads it and there it is. Now it's available for you to print on your printer. And we'll have different formats on there where you can have it'll be single-sided. So, if you don't have a printer that will print on two sides, you can have a version that'll just print on one side. Um, we've got, if you've seen, I think Brother Ed has shown to the congregation before, we have the little pocket sizes that fit in your shirt pocket. Those are really nice. They're working on those, and those are basically the formats there. The other thing that we've done now is we want to be able to recognize those that have labored to uh contribute towards the translation and the transcribing of of the messages. So if we go to the contributors page, the English uh text that we have of of the message was transcribed by by brother David Mamelis and uh those that have worked with him and are still doing um transcriptions on it. So what we wanted to be able to do is, you know, give credit where credit is due. Give him a a bouquet now and just let people know who are these ones that have contributed to this. It's not just us. There's a lot of people behind the scenes that do a lot of work, spend countless hours, and we want to make sure that, you know, everybody as we can gets, you know, some sort of credit towards this. So, we'll have this as as time goes on, there'll be other languages that will be added onto it as well. Um, if you want to go to the message index, this is going to take a minute to load. Now, this is more for translators and it's going to give you a long list of every message that we have and what format it's been um or what yeah what format it's been formatted into and to give an idea to people well what messages should I translate so if we have people that it would say well I want to translate in a certain language and there's only a few there which one should I translate this list here just give it as a long list this here we go this list is then going to show them which um messages need to be translated bill. So the ones in green mean that they're available. The ones in red are not available. So basically have they would translate one version and then once they have the the trans uh translation done, then it's just a a little bit of time then to format into each type of book. So if you can just scroll down there, you can see all the books and all the messages that are are and aren't available. So again, that's more for translators. It was again we wanted to make it so the message hub was a tool that we could communicate to those who are burdened to actually do and have part a part in the translation of it. If you go to translation templates now, I just have my little test file up there, but again, this is what we're intending this to be is so that if people want to translate, we can provide them with the translation templates where they can actually type in all their content and then with that template then they can actually then create a PDF, upload it to the hub and so as fast as they can translate it, transcribe it, format it, it can be on the hub within hours. Then uh so they can actually download if they like to there with a download button. We won't bother doing that though. And then the last thing, oh we have the donate button here which just takes you to PayPal. Um so if anybody's interested in supporting the message hub that is one way that you can do it. Go online, make a PayPal contribution that goes directly to missions. And then the final um toolbar button there is contact us, which we don't have anything like that really on our website right now. So it's kind of like how do I contact somebody? So at least we have a little bit more information on there. Um just trying to think of anything else right now. I think that's about it. So I'm planning to have it launched within the next couple of days. Um I want to thank all those that have contributed. Um, again, it was a lot of work. Um, but as you know, like I say, it's it's it was well worth it. So, I just say God bless you and thank you very much for supporting the message hub for those that do transcriptions, those that support financially, those that give of your time. You know, it's not going to be God's not going to overlook the least of what you do for his kingdom. And to think that, you know, we have a we have the message at our fingertips. It's so easy for us to get on our iPods, iPhones, computers. We have it printed out. But just think about those that don't have it. Those those that I'll just do a little little uh short little testimony here. My brother-in-law went to the Congo to minister and he went to two different churches. And the the only thing the minister had was two message books to preach out of. And there was so much confusion between the churches because they didn't have any any word to to to build their foundation on and or to to build their their um testimonies on. So they said, "Well, no, I don't want to share if I get a I get I get a you know, print hub station, I don't want to share with anybody. I want to keep to myself." But that's that's the attitude they have because they haven't been taught what the word says because how can you how can you really get a revelation of the word with only two message books &gt;&gt; and especially this is a pastor who's preaching to his congregation. So, whatever we can do to get the message out, you know, God, give us the strength. God, give us the the desire and the burden to do it to bless somebody else that's not as as uh as fortunate as we are. &gt;&gt; So, I just pray that you just remember us in your prayers. Remember all those that translate and uh I say God bless to each and every one of you. Thank you for your time. Wonderful. Thank you, brother Darren. Sister Marina in the choir. Why don't you come? Let's sing. Blessed be. Blessed be. Amen. As the choir comes. Oh, blessed be. Oh, blessed be. Blessed be your name. Hey. Oh, blessed be Lord. Blessed be. Oh, blessed be your name.

Oh Lord, blessed be your name. Oh, blessed be Lord. Blessed be blessed. Amen. [Music] [Music] I've just come into a valley, one like I've never been before. I keep searching for a way out. Seems like padlocks around the door. Oh, there must be another sunrise. Another sunset that I'll see. God will make this trial a blessing. That's the love he has for me. God will make this trial a blessing. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. There's no need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. I was not the first one to come into this place. You see every child of God, this test he must face. It is here that God will mold you and make you what you ought to be. God will make this trial a blessing. Just be patient. You will see. Now I'm standing on the mountain. Looking back I can see. When I was in that lowest valley, his strong hand was leading me. Oh, it's good to see the sunshine and taste sweet victory. God has made this trial a blessing. Oh, the grace he gives to me. God will make this trial a blessing. Though he sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. There's no need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. God will make this trial a blessing. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. There's no need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing. And the whole wide world will see. God will make this trial a blessing. And the whole wide world will see. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Our brother Ben Drake's going to come sing a special for us. And Immediately after that, they're going to have their little one, Rehea, dedicated. So, Brother Ben, why don't you come? Let's sing in everything. Give him thanks. Amen. Thank you, choir, Sister Marina. We appreciate that. Amen. Oh, and oh everything. Oh, give him thanks. Just give him thanks. in everything. Just give him the good time. Just praise his name. Oh, just do the same in everything. Just give the king of kings. All the things in everything for your [Music] in [Music] Everything just give it. [Music] The king of all the Heat. Heat. And in the last time just do the same in everything. [Music] The king of kings all the things you Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh friends, I just um just my heart is so filled with expectation for this morning and for with what we've been hearing. It's just it's truly rapturing faith beating within our hearts and &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful to be a part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think back a few years ago and I was running, you know, &gt;&gt; and this little song says, "He came to me and I'm so thankful &gt;&gt; that he came to me and just want to sing it from my heart and forgive me. Little broken this morning. It's a special day and we just we just want to get out of here. &gt;&gt; So, we're just believing and we're going to stand up and have faith &gt;&gt; and just press in because I I just believe for the supernatural this morning and &gt;&gt; I'm ready to explode here. So, praise the Lord. [Music] The golf that separated me from Christ my Lord. It was so fast the crossing I could never afford. [Music] From where I was to his domain it seemed so far. I cry, dear Lord, I cannot come to where you are. And he came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. Oh, and that's why he died on Calary. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] Oh, he came to me when I was bound in chains of my sin. He came to me when I could find no hope within. He reached down, drew me down to his side. [Music] where today his sweet love I now abide. He came. Just join with me, saints. [Music] He was he [Music] and that's why he [Music] [Music] could not to where he was. He came to me. Oh, for he came to me. He came to me. Hallelujah. I could not come to where he was. He came to me. Oh, and that's why he died on Calary. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. For he came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] Oh, and that's why he died. Oh calary. [Applause] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. He came to me. [Music] [Applause] That's why we're here &gt;&gt; because he came to you, came to me. We're so thankful in this atmosphere. We're going to have the baby dedication for our brother Ben and sister Amanda. And if they'll just bring their little one up now, we'll be fine. I'd like to say that uh Jesus took time and brother Brandham took time for the little ones. &gt;&gt; Suffer the little ones to come unto me for such is the kingdom of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; God would give us the trust that these little ones have and the faith that they have. Amen. We're happy today that Sister Amanda's mother, Sister Dick, is able to be here with us. This child has grandparents on Ben's side, Brother David and Sister Pat Drake. And uh Sister Dick and Brother Dick. We uh we want to convey our thanks to God for his grace. And we have a great grandmother too, Sister Elner Drake. We always knew you were a great grandmother before this happened, but uh Brother Ben, thanks for the song. One of my favorites. Brother Ben and Sister Amanda, they have named this child Rehea Shayen. Is that correct? Parents often struggle with names. I had some my grandchildren. I would visit them 3 4 days after their birth and they still didn't have a name. Said it's coming. And so our brother Ben and Sister Amanda, they chose names that they combined together to come with a a a wonderful spiritual meaning for them. Taking depths of meaning from both of the names and I'm taking the combined name of heavenly life. Shaylin is life and Rehea is heaven. and taken from the from the meanings of the words. But I'm wanting to say that heavenly life is coming from heaven and dwelling in heaven. And those are two wonderful things, coming from heaven and dwelling in heaven. And Jesus said, "Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones. And for I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; We as mortals we are so uh limited to what we see what we hear but taking from the scriptures from the words of Jesus and emphasized by our prophet in this day there's another one standing here. That's her angel. &gt;&gt; Another one is standing here, the one who told us about that angel. And that's our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he's more present than we are, &gt;&gt; more real than we are, &gt;&gt; just beyond our sight. But they are here. &gt;&gt; And this child's angel always is before the face of the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. It's his heritage or his possession or his property, his inheritance and his portion. And that is why he dispenses his angel as my property. And I'm going to entrust it to you, brother Ben and Sister Amanda. And this little one will no doubt be very very close to you. I don't know. They they say that uh girls are close to their mother. When they're young, they closer to their father. They get older. I don't know if that's true or not, but I can see brother Ben, you're very very touched by having this daughter. Brother Brandham said, "Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones, for their angels always. Behold my father's face which is in heaven." remember he said they have an angel and when you're born it stays with you all through life and here's just part of a prayer he prayed and I wanted to repeat that prayer before we pray and now their little ones are here watching the lives of their father and mother as we are examples in all that we do our dear God creator creator of heavens and earth, guide our feet. And so I'm praying that for you, Sister Amanda, Brother Ben. Guide our feet, Lord, that we'll do that we'll not do nothing before these little ones that would put a stumbling block in their way. For it is said it'd be better that if we had a millstone tied around our neck and to be cast into the sea than to offend one of these little ones. And you said their angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven, the great angel and guardian angel over each one of these little ones. And I'm going to pray today that this Rehea Shayen will be heavenly life in your home and a brightness. We'll dedicate her to the Lord. Maybe I'll just keep her. Heavenly Father, what a treasure and what a delight it is to be able to hold this gem, this jewel that you have given to our brother Ben and sister Amanda. I'm praying, oh God, that every day of her life. Father, she will be under the protection of the Holy Spirit. I pray that you will guide both father and mother. Oh God, give words to Sister Amanda as she instructs the child. give guidance to brother Ben, father, as he lives before this child. And I pray, dear Lord, that this dedication will be a a a double dedication. That father and mother will dedicate themselves to you in a new and living way. That they will say, "We, Lord, stand here to be the kind of father and the kind of mother that you would have us to be for this child." And we're thankful for her, Lord. We pray that you'll keep her in good health. We pray that you'll watch over her, Father. Provide for her all the days of her life and keep her from the stains of evil and from the wicked influences of this world. I pray that she'll be shielded and put a wall of fire around her, oh God. And as you have given her to our brother Ben and sister Amanda, we now dedicate her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and give her back to you, oh God, that the name of Jesus will be glorified in her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sister Amanda. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you, brother Ben. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was wondering if our brother Roger and Sister Topppsy made it from White Horse. Well, my goodness, there they are. Well, why don't you stand up? our brother Roger Lassard and Sister Topsy. Lassard, God bless you. [Applause] They've moved down to uh worship with us and to fellowship and go along and go in the rapture with us. I hope that's that's what we're counting on. It's a long drive. come a long ways from White Horse to be with us and we're so thankful for that. Brother Abe Dick, God bless him. He journeyed all the way up there. That's a long ways. That's maybe 1500 miles or so. But we're thankful for him and his willingness to go up there. We want to remember this morning too just before we go to the word or when we pray for brother Nathaniel Johnson. How many of you remember brother Nathaniel Johnson when he was here? Yes, there was quite a few. And uh he was uh he was a teacher or principal up in the in the school in Tucson and also ministered up in the north. I remember he lost a son on the on the Yukon River. And uh uh he's he's been in the hospital on life support. He had a stroke about some time ago and uh he may not be on life support very long because the family's decided to remove that from him and they're waiting for a daughter I understand to come from New York. Uh I think we want to at least the very least we can do is remember the family. I always respected and admired our brother Nathaniel. is a real fine man of God. So, I wonder if you'd stand with me and we want to remember this family. And if you have a need, I know we've already had prayer, but we can God is always ready to hear us when we pray. And we want to also pray for the word. I feel a special something I'd like to deliver to you today. Pray that the Holy Spirit will presence himself mightily. Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth, all of the universes, oh God, all everything that every every uh planet and every star and all of these things, oh God, but you set aside this this orb that we're on that we call the earth. And as your prophet said, it's a womb for your seed. And this worth is earth is full of life. And father, we're full of life. Oh God, by the living word of God. You have given us eternal life. Thank you, Father, for this great gift. And I pray that the Holy Spirit breathe upon this congregation, oh God. And let nothing, Father, hinder the word coming to its ordained place. Feed the sheep, oh God. Guide us, I pray. Bless, Father, the Nathaniel Johnson's family, Father. He may not be aware, but perhaps you're just taking him over, oh God, into the other land that he's preached about, he's lived for, Lord, he's prayed for, he's desired this moment. Oh God, let his entrance be a glorious entrance as he's received by the saints. Oh God, I pray, Father, that you will bless the family. And if there be any that are not living where they should be living, I pray that you will use this moment, Lord, to let dad's testimony witness to them. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you'll achieve what you need to achieve, oh God. And now we dedicate ourselves to you. Pray you'll anoint hearer and the speaker in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone could say amen to that. Take your Bibles if you would and we'll turn quickly to the book of second Peter reading from in chapter 3 starting with verse 5. Brother John is going to be going down to Seattle for the afternoon meeting. Those of you that are here from Seattle, we're thankful for you. And brother Tom and sister Joanna are in Arkansas with brother Jason Jackson at his church taking the services today. Thank you for your prayers. Brother Tom was kind of stricken with a a bug and uh one day but God strengthened him so he was able to take the service last night and to today. So now we will read in first and second Peter uh 2 Peter 3 and5. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth, which are now by the same word, are kept in store, reserved unto fire uh against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men. But beloved, be ye not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but as long-suffering to us word, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Would you turn please to Revelation the 21st chapter reading just four verses starting with verse one. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice. I'd like you to notice this verse, please. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." Have you had any? &gt;&gt; I'm sure we have. Amen. &gt;&gt; God shall wipe away all tears &gt;&gt; from our eyes. Whatever caused those tears, friends, going to pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there shall be no more death. Who here has been touched by it one way or another? Friend, a loved one, someone close, there'll be no more death. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; And there will be no more sorrow, &gt;&gt; nor crying, &gt;&gt; neither shall be there shall there be any more pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the former things are passed away, &gt;&gt; not will be, as far as God is concerned, are passed away. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat and hold your attention, please. And let's have as little movement as possible. The prophet said in future home and I would encourage you to uh read prayerfully and slowly the future home the message that's where we're going &gt;&gt; and the and the prophet's message to me has been so profound and more recently in the last few years and I would say probably in the last year even it it seems that we've come into a a season. &gt;&gt; This is a season of rapture and resurrection. &gt;&gt; And we've been in the prophecy of Luke 24, &gt;&gt; the resurrection and the gathering of the people. The resurrection not only of Jesus, but of all of those that were seen on the streets of Jerusalem &gt;&gt; as well. and uh and the gathering of the living and the dead uh with those that saw them and those that reported it and those that spoke with Jesus and that he was there with them perhaps of 40 days uh with all of these remarks uh remarkable things and he and brother Brandham said in future home and by these passages one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this earth will be destroyed. He said, "I make a new heaven and a new earth." See, the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated. But a close study with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of this. And that's what we're going into. And he said, "It's only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the earth that will be destroyed." And I cannot say glory to God in the highest as loud as I would like to. I'd like to declare it over the whole earth. Praise God &gt;&gt; when sin is gone &gt;&gt; and Satan is gone &gt;&gt; and the framework he said will remain. Peter said and will melt with fervent heat. Brother Brandon I'm still quoting it. And the works therein burnt up not the planet the works therein the works of man. all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations and man-made schemes will go with it when it burns and heavens will pass away with a great noise. &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a literal fire. &gt;&gt; It's also a holy fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll take a holy fire to restore it to a holy place &gt;&gt; fit for God's dwelling. He says, "And that will take away Satan and all of his devils, both heaven and earth will pass away." Then he goes into pass away. Heavens and earth will pass away. He said, "Now this word passing from one form to another, it's not the it's not to mean annihilation. It means passing from one thing to another. To pass from one condition, it says to another. And then in Titus 3 and three, he refers to it. Paul is using this same word pass away. He's using the same word which means regeneration of men. &gt;&gt; Your old life passed away. &gt;&gt; Your old desires passed away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that man has passed from a sinner to a saint. Not completely annihilated. &gt;&gt; Not completely annihilated. When a man's changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's a changed person. He's been changed from what he was to what he is, not annihilated. Thank God we've been changed. &gt;&gt; Jesus used the same word at the resurrection of Lazar. Lazarus, loose him, change him. He's been tied. Let him go. And when he told the disciples, "Go and get a colt, he'll be tied. Loose him. Let him pass from a tied condition to a loose condition from being tied and not being able to fulfill the plan of God, but to be now changed." So where you think the Messiah himself would ride on him, &gt;&gt; the earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan. It'll be loose. It'll be loosed from politics. &gt;&gt; It'll be loosed from denominational religious systems &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God to be established here on earth. &gt;&gt; I pray, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; very frequently and I pray very very slowly and and with great deal of purpose in my words. Our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; I can't define that. But you are my father &gt;&gt; and you are in heaven. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Well, I can't say that as deeply as I would like to. Thy kingdom come. When I think of everything we see and everything we face, I say, "Thy kingdom come." My soul cries out, "Thy kingdom come." A kingdom of justice. &gt;&gt; We held a little baby. Do you know this little child today in brother Ben and Sister Amanda's home and the others that we've I think we've had a dedication every service for the last several services. How privileged those children are. Their children today while we're here. &gt;&gt; You had breakfast. They didn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had something to eat. There's a little children with their bodies out of condition, out of shape and malnourished. They didn't deserve it. It's this wickedness, &gt;&gt; greedy men, &gt;&gt; power- hungry men, &gt;&gt; cruel men, &gt;&gt; Satan who who possesses them. Listen friends, that's what this prophet's message came to remind us that we are now in that season. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it or you'll miss it. God doesn't send a seventh messenger like that for the world to take lightly or the religious world to take lightly. &gt;&gt; You won't see this again. &gt;&gt; You will not see another one like that. You won't have someone standing and saying he's here now. I'll speak to the first person revealing the secrets of the hearts. I tell you, it's a lot more than just revealing. And then Pentecost missed it completely. Think it's just some gift or some gift of discernment. missed it completely. And that's why they don't don't have the word because they refused the word. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he came up out of the water," and you may wonder about that scripture. I I don't want to take any time with it, but it says that that he the the the earth was in the water and out of the water. And we know that Jesus Christ was the beginning of the new creation of God. If you go into Genesis, you'll find it that God separated and the the the water rose up out of the the earth rose up out of the water and the waters were dried back and whatever more. But in the new creation, Jesus Christ, the seed that produced Jesus Christ was a created seed of God. And it was by the word of God that he spoke as I spoke last Sunday. By the words of the prophets. By the word of God. The prophet said the words of the prophets anchored to the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The words that God spoke through them anchored and that was a created seed. And now when he comes and the voices to speak over him, he's the beginning of the new creation. If God in a man &gt;&gt; and the body is of the earth, &gt;&gt; his body was of the earth. He took the earth up through the womb of a woman through which seed through which sin came to commence the redemption process. And now Jesus Christ himself, the earth, the body of earth is standing in the water and out of the water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the voice spoke, "This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the creation of God." Hallelujah. In the first creation, he ended with a son, but this one, he starts with the sun. &gt;&gt; Thought I'd just drop that in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And John the Apostle saw the new Jerusalem descending out of heaven. John the Baptist saw the Holy Spirit as a dove descending upon a part of the earth. Jesus Christ. And John the Apostle saw the New Jerusalem descending upon the earth, out of heaven, upon the earth. And John the Baptist saw the Holy Spirit descending as a dove upon a part of the earth. Brother Bram says Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And law of voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; And this is the title of my message, a great voice out of heaven. You want to listen very close because I'm going to take some sharp turns in the message &gt;&gt; and it might sound too natural but I think I want I want you to consider some things very deeply today. And lo, a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." in a future home. Yet John said, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband." The new Jerusalem appeared like the a bride adorned for her husband. And where did it settle on? Just exactly like it did there upon the earth. Jesus was a part of the earth. Listen friends, you'll have to p you'll have to pinch your conscience now. Say, God, let the spirit of revelation come upon me. &gt;&gt; I saw the holy city, Jerusalem, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband. And where did it settle on? He asked. And then he breaks into it and says, just exactly like it did on there upon the earth. Jesus was part of the earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon. Is that right? And remained upon him forever. It never can leave him. It's always there. He and God are one. Always has to remain. And so John saw the holy city. He's going back and forth from the baptism of Jesus to what John saw. And so John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending like a comet or a dove coming down out of heaven and settling upon a redeemed earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood in the water and the dove came down as a testimony because that was the beginning of the redemption of the whole earth. &gt;&gt; And in him was the blood that was going to be spill at Calvary and claimed the whole earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you have been redeemed already. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The very body that you're in, that's why it's going to be resurrected. Jesus has redeemed it. &gt;&gt; It's already redeemed. &gt;&gt; Your soul is redeemed. &gt;&gt; Has always been redeemed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But your body shall the elements I whether you were buried in the ocean or or burned at the stake, God will call it forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll be in the likeness that he intended it to be. Do you believe that people &gt;&gt; to claim every attribute &gt;&gt; that he made the earth for? This earth was made for his redeemed attributes, &gt;&gt; his redeemed children. And that's what this earth is made for. Wasn't made for New York and Los Angeles and London and Paris and whatever goes on there. Wasn't made for these governments. Wasn't made for these things. Wasn't made for wicked wars and all these turmoils. It was made for the redeemed saints. And righteousness shall reign supreme. &gt;&gt; And friends, I want to be in that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. Oh God, is that your heart cry? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the message a few weeks ago? That needs to be the allconsuming desire within you. &gt;&gt; Not, oh God, I got a pain in my shoulder. Oh God, my knee is not good. And oh God, my heart that that's fine. That's in the package. That's not the main thing for the people. Now it's, oh God, let thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Let thy rapture come. &gt;&gt; Let the change come. It's been spoken in the word and that's my promise. &gt;&gt; Let that sweep come. I live for that sweep. &gt;&gt; Let these atoms be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Let the resurrection come. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you looked for a resurrected saint? That ought to be one of our key desires. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll see one this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can we believe it and not believe it? &gt;&gt; You say that's going over the edge. Well, the prophet said, "I'm crazy. They say I'm crazy. Just leave me that way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're looking for another city. &gt;&gt; They can have these perverted places. Give me that city, &gt;&gt; that new Jerusalem, which we are part of that city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To claim every attribute that he made the earth for. Every man that was represented in the eternity and every woman is redeemed. Then the holy blood that was created by God, the blood, the life, the creation of God. Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost descended upon Jesus, which was Jesus was a part of the earth. As I said a moment ago, and then brother Brandham goes into it. It's actually paragraph 49. And I'll leave it because I'm trying to save a little bit of time. He said, "His spirit light floods the pyramid city." Like Peter and John, I tell you, you know this prophet messenger, he's in another dimension. &gt;&gt; He'll describe something out of the scripture and then he goes to something in the scripture and you need to have your spiritual mind on and your spiritual let the Holy Spirit because when he goes from one to the other, the human mind can't connect them. &gt;&gt; But you better say, God, give me your mind because they are connected. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says the pyramid, the spirit light floods a pyramid city, the building the the city four square and he describes it 1500 miles square 1500 miles high like a pyramid. He said like Peter and John up on the on top of the mountain the light covered the top of the mountain mount transfiguration and a voice spoke. A voice spoke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 21:3 and 4, he says, "And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, behold, the tabernacle of God is with men." &gt;&gt; Now, I can speak it &gt;&gt; and God can say, "That's fine. You're called minister of the gospel. You can speak it and say the same words." And those words will go out into the I will say into the infinity of eternity and because it goes rippling out. I want you to think about that. But when the seventh messenger comes according to God's season and time, born at the right time, born under the sign, born with the supernatural, with the light following all through. And then when he begins to say there's a voice out of heaven &gt;&gt; saying hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That voice &gt;&gt; goes into the heavens. &gt;&gt; You heard brother Darren speaking about the hub. &gt;&gt; I'll just give you a little clue in where I'm going. There has never been brother Brandham in fact is in countdown. The one thing that he declares emphatically is that human scientific achievement happens and going along in concert with it is the achievement a spiritual achievement. And he called Wesley Luther, he called Luther a scientist, a spiritual scientist. Wesley was a spiritual scientist because he said they're discovering things in the word and they're discovering spiritual achievements. And he says they're taking the chemicals, the chemistry of the word, the chemicals of the word, and there's achievement in the body of Christ, and we're moving higher and higher and higher. This is the first time since Adam. Now, our voices, I'm getting ahead of myself, but you'll see where I'm going. Our voices go out into the into the infinity, as I said, of eternity. Just go echoing on out. But man has never been able to until this age go up into that space and bring it back down &gt;&gt; and hear it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Go onto your computer and go to the message and search the first message in 1947. Faith is a substance. And the first words out of the prophet's mouth are, "We have a new gadgets here &gt;&gt; for recording." &gt;&gt; You think that's an accident? That's absolutely divinely ordained of Almighty God because God had ordained that that voice would be recorded and he knew that that voice would go into the heavens and he knew that we could have a scientific achievement in this hour that can pull a voice back down &gt;&gt; and for the first time listen to &gt;&gt; a dying humanity can listen to that voice. I say to you today, as far as I'm satisfied, it's a voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; And you can pull all your trash and garbage out of it if you wish. And I don't wish to, but there's all kinds of trash and garbage that's up there. Every man's voice and all of this nonsense and all of these lies that are spoken of by politicians and failed promises and all of these predictions and all of these things. That is why the prophet declared in the future home that it's going to be burned up. No wonder there'll be a great noise &gt;&gt; and the heavens will be on fire and God's going to purge it. You think he's going to leave e any of that evil trash up there? He's going to cleanse every wit of it. &gt;&gt; It'll be purified. &gt;&gt; And I want to make another statement. God for sure will never destroy his own word. The only thing that will remain there is God's word. &gt;&gt; You'll still hear all the messengers voices. You'll still hear that prophet's voice. &gt;&gt; It'll still there. God even made the atmosphere to retain the voice &gt;&gt; for judgment's sake. &gt;&gt; And for justification's sake, &gt;&gt; listen to me now. You're hearing my voice. I'm going to make announcement to you according to the prophet's word. You're going to hear your own voice. &gt;&gt; And he said he will hear his voice &gt;&gt; screaming out against this generation. &gt;&gt; You'll hear your voice. &gt;&gt; And of what he said, I'm going into what he said. &gt;&gt; He said that your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words on earth. [Applause] That's my introduction. [Music] &gt;&gt; This beginning of the new creation was the holy son of God, the blood of God. an act of creation and a body of the earth. And the scripture says in Hebrews 12:24, "And to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel." What is speaking? &gt;&gt; What is speaking? &gt;&gt; The blood that speaketh better things. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to think deep now. And and the Bible says after Cain was slain, after Abel was slain, rather, and God said and he said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground." &gt;&gt; I can't I can't quite comprehend it, but I read it and I believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God said, "The voice of Cain's blood cries to me out of the ground." &gt;&gt; I don't know what it said, but the Bible says that the blood of Jesus Christ speak of better things than that of Abel. &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not say, "I forgive you." &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not say, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not do that. But the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood of Jesus Christ through the mouth, the words of a prophet, which is the bleeding word &gt;&gt; could say you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; I don't think you want to be accountable for every thought, every word, every act. So we say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I accept that. &gt;&gt; I accept that. [Music] What other minister? Not just a minister. That was the words of Jesus Christ coming through his servants's mouth. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have another thought if I were you. &gt;&gt; That's his thought. &gt;&gt; Paul said to the Corinthians, "If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to battle?" So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For if you shall speak, for you shall speak into the air. There are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification. Therefore, if I know what the meaning of the voice, I shall if I if I know not rather the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian. And he that speaketh unto me a barbarian, and a barbarian is one who speaks in a foreign strange language which is not understood by another. &gt;&gt; So Paul says we won't understand. And so we hear in the scripture, the Bible says they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Jordan. I try to imagine what that was in Deuteronomy. And the Lord said, "Speak and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire." God spoke. I don't know how it was conveyed. I don't know if it was articulated into words or if it was some sound. I don't know what it was. As I said last Sunday, the voice of the resurrection. Is it simply the voice of words that are heard on our eard drum or is it something that goes beyond the eardrum into our mind and down into our heart, down into our soul? Or is it words combined with manifestation? &gt;&gt; Because things that we see can be so much more powerful when it's visually. And so when we hear a word, it's like a teacher saying to a class, giving it all to the class and and then turns to the to the board and said, "Now I'll do a diagram." And he the prophet does that here. He describes it what what the person is like that has a snake in their in their heart and what the person is like that has the word of God in their heart. And so he drives a draws draws a diagram to describe and so visually the people can see. So perhaps after the resurrection, why Jesus said, and now you're catching my recent messages, why Jesus said because they were having some doubts. He said, "Touch me. &gt;&gt; Feel me." &gt;&gt; Why? Because that would pronounce the uh a resurrection. They were having doubt. They thought it was a spirit. They had heard the strange things from the women and those that had run to the tomb. But he said, "Touch me because I would help to to impress them that the resurrection indeed had happened." &gt;&gt; A spirit hath not flesh and bones such as I have. Touch me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this in this age, we got to go beyond just hearing a message. &gt;&gt; We need to take that message until it's absorbed &gt;&gt; in us. Until you can touch it. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This message is Jesus Christ and he's no less real today than he was back then. And if he said back then, catch me after the resurrection. That's what give them faith &gt;&gt; to believe and to preach the resurrection. And the book of Acts opens with the resurrection. This age opens with the resurrection. And it closes with the resurrection. Our message is a message of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Because when the saints are resurrected, I guarantee you, you're only here for a very few days. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you'll be one. &gt;&gt; There's not many. &gt;&gt; That's one thing the message is makes me quiver. &gt;&gt; There's not many. But I'm determined &gt;&gt; by God's grace &gt;&gt; to be in that number. &gt;&gt; If I go by the way of the grave, I'll beat you to it. &gt;&gt; I'll beat you to it before your bodies change. &gt;&gt; Because the dead and Christ shall rise first and then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them. Hallelujah. Make your calling and election sure. Make sure you have a place at the wedding supper table. &gt;&gt; We're not here for any other reason. &gt;&gt; This message has been a clear sound. &gt;&gt; So what is the sound? What is the voice? &gt;&gt; And it spoke a voice out of the midst of the fire. Deuteronomy 5:23 says, "And a voice out of the midst of the darkness, &gt;&gt; and John 1, John 12, and 28, then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God comes to that very scripture in the first seal. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to it in a few minutes, &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm going to do something a little different. Don't lose track of where I am. Brother John Andy's asked a group of men to come help me here. I'd like all those men to come at this moment. If you would please. Just line up across here. When you speak and when you have the microphone in front of you, I want you to say it with the same force that you'd hear a prophet of God say it. I want you to read from the same. You have it there, but I want you to read from the same one. And then you'll hand it to the next person and you'll say it. Use the microphone right up to your mouth, please. And say it in your language. Okay? Okay. Respond. &gt;&gt; Same paper. Fore same paper. How many understood that? Four. At least four. How many understood that? Praise the Lord. [Applause] Wow. Hallelujah. We struck the mother load. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all heard words. We all heard speech. &gt;&gt; We all heard men speak, &gt;&gt; but our minds were not fruitful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now listen. All of these men said the same scripture &gt;&gt; that you believed or you wouldn't be here. Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now every one of these men spoke different completely different words completely different language but they have all experienced the same thing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you hear something beyond the word. Thank you, brothers. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So, they heard a voice out of the fire. They heard a voice out of the darkness. Uh they heard a voice out of the burning bush. But it all had the same effect. &gt;&gt; And there came a voice out of heaven saying, I have both glorified and will glorify it again. And Apostle Paul said, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, &gt;&gt; God can speak Hebrew. &gt;&gt; He can speak African. &gt;&gt; He can speak French and English. &gt;&gt; He can speak any language. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our sister Topsy here has a great aunt or an aunt who is translating a message in the Inuit language. For those of you who don't know what Inuit is was formerly Eskimo and it's the first time I know that it's going into that language &gt;&gt; but when that when they are done Sister Topppsy they will go on the hub &gt;&gt; and it will be a voice from heaven. [Applause] Don't think that that is just too practical or too common. That is a voice from heaven. God knew that was going to be available. God knew whose message was going to be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even as I speak to you, the prophet's voice is up there. A voice from heaven crying out, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; It's a voice from heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm beside myself, friends. &gt;&gt; I've been thinking about this one for a long time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I heard another voice from heaven, John in the Revelator says, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not her plagues." Isn't it amazing that John would hear a voice out of heaven and he could articulate those words &gt;&gt; and then those words are translated and brought down into English and into all kinds of languages which would just be garble. But when that person believes it and this person believes it, I don't know what the thing sounds like, but the effect of it is exactly the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why when the bride comes marching in, they'll all be dressed the same. Hallelujah. Because they believe the same word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been in a lot of countries and all I can say is it's been a privilege to see them whether in the Russia or in China or the islands of the sea. They have all have the the same message has the same effect. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; They don't have to go to a Bible school. &gt;&gt; They don't have to spend years. &gt;&gt; I've seen young ones just born into the faith and they are transformed &gt;&gt; by the power of the word of God. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in the first seal &gt;&gt; in John 12:27-28, he says, "Now listen here real close." That's him saying it. &gt;&gt; Then you won't have to wonder no more what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus answering him said, "The hour has come." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That the Son of Man should be glorified. And brother Brham interjects. So we're at the end of an age there. His ministry is ending. &gt;&gt; And his own ministry was ending. &gt;&gt; He's at an end of an age here. &gt;&gt; The seals are now going to be open. He's going to preach a few short services and be gone. And Jesus his his ministry was ending. His life was ending. &gt;&gt; And he goes on, "The hour has come that the son of man &gt;&gt; should be glorified." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham breaks in. &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come &gt;&gt; that when this his bride must be taken away? &gt;&gt; What about that hour? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come &gt;&gt; that time shall be no more? The angel is ready to set a foot &gt;&gt; on the land and another on the sea with a rainbow over his head over him with his feet and say time's run out. &gt;&gt; Where are we folks? &gt;&gt; Where are you? &gt;&gt; I've got news for you. You're here. &gt;&gt; I hope you can catch up &gt;&gt; to the unfolding of the word. I hope you can catch up to the fulfillment of the word. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so slow &gt;&gt; that we have to walk with the resurrected Christ and have him explain the scriptures and details and say all fools and fools and fools as we know it is oh slow slugards lazy and mentally. Let's not be lazy today. &gt;&gt; You young people, you pinch your conscience. You can learn in school. You can learn here in church. We're in a late hour &gt;&gt; and there's a fresh sweep &gt;&gt; in a resurrection season. &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell that to you. You know it. You feel it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Time's run out. And besides that, he raised his hand and swore that time would be no more. And that's not that the clocks stop. &gt;&gt; Time no more is that there will be no longer a delay &gt;&gt; for the revelation because this is the first seal. And now each night afterward, he's going to speak the others. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a thunder, which is a voice of God. &gt;&gt; Do you hear it, brothers, sisters? &gt;&gt; Do you hear it? &gt;&gt; You read the seals, it ought to be a thunder to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, he spoken years ago." Listen, he spoke for our He's a prophet, &gt;&gt; speaking ahead of his time. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified. &gt;&gt; Father, glorify that name, thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven. And there were other people there, but I don't know who heard it, but Jesus heard it. It was articulated. &gt;&gt; I heard a voice from heaven saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." &gt;&gt; And the people and those that stood by heard it and they said, "It thundered." &gt;&gt; So God spoke, but it sounded like a thunder. And it didn't mean anything to the some people, but to others it meant I have glorified it and will glorify it again. &gt;&gt; And that was recorded &gt;&gt; so that it could be brought down into our time. And the prophet said, "And then when the lamb took the book and broke the first seal, God spoke &gt;&gt; from his eternal throne &gt;&gt; to say what that seal was revealed." &gt;&gt; God spoke &gt;&gt; from his eternal throne. &gt;&gt; Through who? &gt;&gt; Through who? &gt;&gt; Through a man that could speak the language you most of you understand. And to those that don't understand it, there are people like these men says they've got my people have to know this. People like brother Murphy up there right now and people like brother Timothy Maul over 450 messages in the Vietnamese. How can they hear it? A voice from heaven. [Applause] God bless every minister. &gt;&gt; I thank God for them. &gt;&gt; Thank God those that travel. Thank God for every interpreter. Thank God for the translators. &gt;&gt; But just think now, it isn't even they don't have to fly in a jet. God in the creation of the earth made a a sphere to hold the voices of the people. your voice, my voice. &gt;&gt; I've got a ways to go. So, I hope you just hang on a moment. &gt;&gt; And he reserved it for his voice, &gt;&gt; not these adulterers and these celebrities, so-called fallen stars, devils, demons from hell, perverted people, murderers, and adulterers. He made it for his voice. He made it for the voice of the witnesses. He made it for your voice. &gt;&gt; He wanted to hear you say, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; He wanted you to He wanted to hear you say, "Lord Jesus, speak on." [Applause] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to hear. He wanted to hear you say, "Lord, what wil thou have me to do? &gt;&gt; And I will do it." [Music] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in the first seal, speaking from his throne, he says, "But when it was placed before John, it was a symbol. And when John saw it, it was still a mystery. &gt;&gt; Remember he said, "A loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it came and and the prophets receiving it in the first seal, he said it was a sworn affidavit &gt;&gt; to the church. He stops reading. I have glorified it and I will glorify it again. He said it's a sworn affidavit. a sworn affidavit. And you know, an affidavit is a written declaration made on an oath &gt;&gt; before somebody &gt;&gt; authorized to administer the oath. &gt;&gt; There had to be a vindicated &gt;&gt; prophet, &gt;&gt; a vindicated messenger who year after year after year, this one of whom I speak was not ashamed to stand by him. He was he was an authorized person to administer the oath &gt;&gt; and the or oath is a sworn affidavit to the people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Tell your friends &gt;&gt; serious moment. It doesn't get any stronger than that. It doesn't get any stronger than that. And notice where it's placed in the first seal. I have glorified it and I will glorify it again. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're at a wedding time. &gt;&gt; And the woman, Paul said, is the glory of the man. That's right. &gt;&gt; And now that season had just arrived where the woman the bride was this was the messenger calling the bride out. He said that's what the shout is to make the bride to call her out. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he must be glorified again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like doing a dance &gt;&gt; before God who gave this word &gt;&gt; to think that he would call us the likes of you and me &gt;&gt; to be part of this thing. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh, how great is our God. &gt;&gt; Aren't you privileged? &gt;&gt; That's your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A voice of languages. As I said and as I had the brethren here, completely different in sounds. Yet the word of God will produce &gt;&gt; and does produce the same thing. our voices. I'm going to go quickly now because I have just give me about another 10 or 15 minutes if you would please. This message actually deserves another hour or so. &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be long. But I said our voices I want to make a statement then I want to back it up with a with a message. Our voices are going on out into the infinity of eternity. And Jesus said, "But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment." In deep call to the deep, brother Brennham said, "Lord, let us today, let us be today the lightgivers of this age." That when the great drama is set out at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; And listen to me my brother, my sister, if I ever or never speak to you again, you do have an end at your road. &gt;&gt; Whether it is the change of the body or whatever, but these words will still hold true. &gt;&gt; These words are in heaven. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When we come to the end of the road and each one of us, there's nobody hiding behind another one. Each one of us &gt;&gt; comes up before you and the great screen is pulled out &gt;&gt; and our lives of this generation is brought back before us. God, &gt;&gt; here's this prayer now. God, &gt;&gt; let me hear my voice. screaming out against unrighteousness and calling to people to believe on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh God, when that hour comes, let me hear my voice from today calling people to righteousness. Believe on the word that God has sent &gt;&gt; and that's your righteousness. Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness &gt;&gt; which incidentally is your garment &gt;&gt; that you need to be clothed. You need to hear the voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; To be clothed &gt;&gt; so that you don't stand before him naked. &gt;&gt; The word is your garment. &gt;&gt; It's not just something you choose to listen to and to hear and to sit on the shelf in some books. That's not it. &gt;&gt; It's a voice coming from the throne &gt;&gt; to clothe you. &gt;&gt; Because Leodysia was naked. &gt;&gt; Why was she naked? Because she refused the prophet God sent to her. &gt;&gt; And others just mouthed it. And others were hitchhikers. And others were casual about it. Whatever you do, my brother, my sister, don't be casual about this word. &gt;&gt; God's not casual. &gt;&gt; Don't you be casual. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young people, hear me? &gt;&gt; You're diligent in your studies. You need to be diligent with this. More diligent. &gt;&gt; Your studies are only for this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's voice through his holy prophet and prophets, apostles, and the bride body of Jesus Christ. That's the last voice to the last age. &gt;&gt; And is it's going out now. It's being recorded. &gt;&gt; It's being preserved to the day of judgment &gt;&gt; in the spoken word. And the word of God continually goes on. Now, it's not your word, my word, but he's saying the word of God goes continually on. I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it, &gt;&gt; that a man's voice, my voice that I speak today, 10,000 years from now, could still be picked up in the air. &gt;&gt; Do you know why the hub is such a marvelous thing? Invention, the world invented it. We use it for the glory of God. is because it's permanently recorded and no one can take it out of there. &gt;&gt; It's in the heavens. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's wife, Sister Mey said to him, "You go back and forth across the nations, back and forth all the time preaching. You go right back in the people just doing the same thing, and what good does it?" He said, I I said in the day of judgment, &gt;&gt; there will be a tape recording on God's great tape. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a great recording gadget? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you like to have been there in 1947? His first words, if you knew who he was, his first words, we've got a new some new recording gadget. Gadgets or new gadgets here for recording. He said, "In the day of judgment, there will be a tape recording on God's great tape. You're not ignorant of these things. God will blast it across the skies. He's got to have a voice there to condemn the world by. &gt;&gt; And the voice is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Aren't we thankful today? &gt;&gt; And this voice has been blasted across the skies. &gt;&gt; But at the judgment, people will hear their own voice. &gt;&gt; God's not going to come and standing like with a great accusing finger and said, "You rascal." It's going to be your own voice &gt;&gt; and you want to fill the heavens &gt;&gt; with the declaration. &gt;&gt; Yay, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe God's word. I may not understand it, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; Fill the heavens with your voice. [Applause] Jesus said, and this will take on new meaning for you, heavens and earth shall pass away. &gt;&gt; You know the last phrase, &gt;&gt; but my word, &gt;&gt; my words shall not pass away. &gt;&gt; It's on the basis of that scripture. I tell you that everything that's in the heavens, every blasphemer, every accuser, everyone who's written derogatory books concerning William Brandham's message and his life, it will all pass away. &gt;&gt; But thus saith the Lord shall never pass away. My people shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Why don't you raise your hand and say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; It'll never pass away. The message that called you shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus. &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth shall pass away, &gt;&gt; but my word shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; I would say when you've crossed over &gt;&gt; and you begin speaking whatever heavenly language has been given, There will be nothing else in the heavens &gt;&gt; but the voice of God &gt;&gt; and Hosea it says and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear said the Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and marvelous I shall hear the heavens I will hear what's in the heavens and the heavens hear the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I got two two more very important steps. You'll stay with me very close. When I first this first came to me, I never dreamed I would ever preach on it. Never dreamed it. It's a few I'm going back a few years. I I thought they were just thoughts, but to me they were wonderful thoughts and I kept them private until time went on. Brother Brandham says he calls the word the bleeding word &gt;&gt; and that's why he had an indictment against this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And the crucifixion was the shedding of blood. And this message, he said, this word is a bleeding word. Listen now. He said the sinner's got to stand judgment and there won't be but this judgment. It's just like a circle or a rainbow around the world of the blood of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every messenger, all the apostles, all the prophets, Moses' words, Elijah, Elisha, Samuel's, Solomon's wisdom, Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Naam, Jonah, Daniel, Habacook, all of those prophets, their words are all there, &gt;&gt; right? held. &gt;&gt; The heavens have heard the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Then came the apostles and the commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ. Go ye out into all the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; They that believe shall be saved. &gt;&gt; By believing that word, you be saved. &gt;&gt; Denying that word, you're damned. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cast your words out. &gt;&gt; I will keep them. I will record them. I will preserve them. And then we came and the word which Christ is the word. And now he was put out into the eternities through the spoken word of vessels of earth who he had sent been sent to redeem. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we're in swimming water. I hope you follow me. And so he had these were potentially redeemed bodies. Go use your body. They'll slay you. They will hate you. They will cast you into prison. But preach this gospel. And they went out and they declared the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They declared the blood of Jesus Christ as the only atonement for sin [Applause] &gt;&gt; until their lives were over and their voices were silenced and they went to the grave. But he said, "Don't worry. I'll raise you up out of there." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go speak it. &gt;&gt; We talk about the weather and about our education and about our finance and about everything else and all the business everything else that's all going to pass away. &gt;&gt; Not that we don't have to do it, but as a believers, we do do it within our realm of of of life and existence. We have to do it. But it's not for a believer. That's not a natural thing. That's a spiritual thing. &gt;&gt; When you men work and earn a living for your family, that's spiritual. It's in the word of God. &gt;&gt; But unbeliever does it, it's not spiritual because he hasn't believed. &gt;&gt; So it's a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's like a circle, like a rainbow around the world. The rainbow is of the blood of Christ. Ever since I was just a young man, I pondered about a certain scripture and some have gone over the edge with it. And that was when Jesus died, he died for the sins of the &gt;&gt; what? world. &gt;&gt; So I thought, how can he damn people and have atoned for their sins at the same time? &gt;&gt; There's always a question in my mind. Oh, how I thank God for the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that perfectly. He says there's a like a ribbon, like a ring, &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ around the whole earth. and every sinner. He said it doesn't matter whether and I'm going to just paraphrase now because I've read it. I have I know it very well. He said she can he can be a drunkard a gambler. She can be a prostitute. Whatever. As long as they're here, their blood, their sins are atoned for. &gt;&gt; But when they die, &gt;&gt; they pass through &gt;&gt; that ribbon of blood &gt;&gt; and stand in the presence of God &gt;&gt; and cannot go into the presence of God because they do not have any blood. &gt;&gt; They've passed through it. &gt;&gt; When we're down here, we believe on it. We believe on the life that came out of the blood. We've received the Holy Spirit that came from the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our sins are erased and forgiven and gone. &gt;&gt; But when an unbeliever, just think about believing, an unbeliever passes through the ring of the blood, he said two things. He cannot go into the presence of God because he does not have the blood any longer atoning for him or her. And they cannot come back to earth again because their time has been lived out. &gt;&gt; And he said they're caught in a nightmare. And another place he calls it the fifth dimension. &gt;&gt; And it's like a nightmare. He said, "Like a person who's they're not fully asleep and they're not fully awake and they're caught in a nightmare." &gt;&gt; He said, "And they are screaming &gt;&gt; and nashing of teeth &gt;&gt; because they're caught in a nightmare." My dear friends, &gt;&gt; young and old alike, &gt;&gt; visitor or believer, unbeliever, make believer, whatever you might be, don't go there. [Applause] And you don't need to go there. Say, "Brother Ed, what must I do?" Believe on this Lord Jesus Christ. Believe on the revealed word of God, and thou shalt be saved. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come here just to go to church, you're missing it. &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm preaching about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe &gt;&gt; repent &gt;&gt; and be baptized every one of you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you've not been baptized, you should run to this water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they pass through the ring of blood. And I have all of these quotes here. shows a man when he's unconverted. He lived his time up. He's dead on earth and he cannot go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught. He cannot come back to earth because the time's finished &gt;&gt; here on earth and he's caught between and he's in a nightmare. &gt;&gt; In a countdown, he says, "But my point is this. the scientific things has been able to achieve. They were there at the world fair. He talks about at the world fair I believe it's 62 showing by scientific research what science has been able to achieve in the natural things. Now we are here. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; We are here and he'll tell you why you're here. We are here by spiritual research. &gt;&gt; We are here because God has used spiritual things. &gt;&gt; I am here probably largely because there is a gadget here recording his voice. &gt;&gt; Was it just some human? Was it just some something to to fill in a sentence when he said there's a a new we have some new gadgets for recording? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is it just some statistics which I'll give you in just a moment that that the voice of God's messenger? I'm glad my voice can go as a witness and your voice can go as witnesses. I'm glad for that because I want to hear my voice. That's why the prophet was such an example to us. &gt;&gt; Said, "Say nice things &gt;&gt; about one another." &gt;&gt; You think they saying that just so he'd be nice? You're missing it. Say nice things cuz you're going to hear it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that, you don't believe him. If you don't believe him, you don't believe God. &gt;&gt; He said a few years ago the transportation was by horse and buggy. Just give me another few minutes. I'm I'm about 10 minutes now. Oh, just a few minutes. It represented an achievement of God's economy. He said the automobile day and the airplane day came along and they went from the earth into the air. If a person will have a spiritual mind and I say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; grant me a spiritual mind." If you'll have a spiritual mind, it represented it represented what the buggy and the and the and the automobile and the airplane represented &gt;&gt; a an achievement &gt;&gt; of God's economy with his church. &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak like this, friends. bring it right to this very moment. &gt;&gt; He said Wesley was one of God's great scientists. Luther was one of God's great scientists. And he took the chemicals of the word and put it together. And the church moved by faith. The Pentecostals believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the promise was to you, your children, them are far off. And they said they put the chemicals together and out out of the word and they moved into the air. But now &gt;&gt; something else has happened. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need you to amen me. I just want to know you got it. &gt;&gt; Something else has happened. &gt;&gt; We got an astronaut now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got one that went beyond the curtain of time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And came back. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "We got astronauts. We had astronauts long ago. Enoch was one of our astronauts. And Elijah was one of our astronauts. We got astronauts. We got an astronaut in our day." &gt;&gt; And he described what kind of body he had. It wasn't just one went up into space. He went into another realm, into another dimension. Said, "I held I pinched my hand, Brother Eddie. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I bit my finger. &gt;&gt; I felt for my hair and my head was full of hair." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I felt them and they had real bodies." &gt;&gt; I ask you, are you going there? You believe that? &gt;&gt; You ought to say, Lord, I believe. I want to hear my voice. &gt;&gt; I believe that prophet of God. &gt;&gt; I believe that Lord Jesus Christ speaking through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now something else has happened. And he says, "And remember," he drops it in. And remember, I'm coming to a close right now. The messenger comes at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Why does he come at the end of the age? tell you what has been happening so you can see it and to tell you what is about to happen. &gt;&gt; He says, "What does it represent?" He said, "A spiritual age, a spiritual time to where God's going to have spiritual astronauts." &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice, &gt;&gt; God has allowed brothers, as brother Darren said, he said, "I don't other brothers have worked on this. I don't even know the Do you know what? I don't even know who who it was that worked on the hub alto together. We put a lot of effort, a lot of time and a lot of expense into it in the days of the voice. &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; And you know what he says about the bride? He says she knows &gt;&gt; what he wants done &gt;&gt; with the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She knows. &gt;&gt; And that's why God puts in their heart and they translate on the we hours of the night. &gt;&gt; I I I thank God for the brethren that have labored and worked. They do theirs and they don't see me in in in in my night hours &gt;&gt; and I don't see them and we don't see one another. I don't hear you pray, but God hears you pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; The scientific achievement in the bride made possible the preservation and the permanent preservation of the voice. He said, "Oh word believers, this is in birth pains. &gt;&gt; Oh word believers, &gt;&gt; give me your attention now. He's calling out to you &gt;&gt; and these words are in the heavens. Oh word believers, give in to my message. &gt;&gt; Hear me. Not my message but his message. Lord, &gt;&gt; the following figures are only the last four months from December 1 to the end of March. 54,237 visits from 3,238 cities in 146 countries &gt;&gt; in 4 months. &gt;&gt; Approximately 200 hub stations have been sent all over the world and more are waiting right now to go. 17 translators working on the hub message. That's 17 that we support here. But there are men like brotherh Jacques in the Czech Republic been translating for about 30 years and he's putting all of his messages on the hub. People are calling from all over a brother from South Africa from and speaking Zulu. He said I will speak Zulu. You only have a couple messages Zulu. I will resign my position and translate for one year and at the end of the year I will seek other employment. 1,999 message were uploaded on the hub in four months by brothers and sisters that are here in this congregation or those that are burdened for it. &gt;&gt; 109,819 messages downloaded from the hub. &gt;&gt; Amen. This isn't merely statistics. Somebody's hearing the voice. &gt;&gt; 46 languages on the hub. And in February, just February, 30,000 30,000 in February downloaded messages in one month. And that is triple last February. &gt;&gt; You see where it's going, friends? This isn't the work of man. It isn't even the work of this. People ask me, "Who owns the hub?" I said, "We don't. I don't know. The bride owns it. &gt;&gt; We certainly don't own it. We're just pushing it for all we're worth &gt;&gt; because we believe in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a there's we're trying to figure out a way right now to get one over to northern Uganda and I think that the best way is to buy one over there and that's what we're communicating to them. And they said we will we will the tribal languages up here. There isn't messages. We'll translate and put them on and we'll print books for 40 40 churches in this area. &gt;&gt; Is that a good work? Amen. &gt;&gt; $1,200 or $1,500 to provide this message to 40 churches. I say absolutely that's the best best deal I ever heard of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can put the voice. &gt;&gt; First time in history &gt;&gt; that the prophet's voice, &gt;&gt; vindicated voice can be pulled down &gt;&gt; out of the heavens &gt;&gt; and listened to. Don't ever take that lightly, friends. &gt;&gt; You'll go home and look at your MP3s or your CDs or whatever more and you'll have a lot a much greater appreciation for it than you've ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And last, and I'm done, we say we are washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're washed. The word is water. The word is cleansing. &gt;&gt; The word will cleanse you from what nothing else can cleanse you. You can wash. Pilate washed his hands. He could not cleanse &gt;&gt; himself. &gt;&gt; We can't cleanse ourselves. We can't We can't think our way out of this thing, friends. We can't think our way out of our mistakes, out of our errors or whatever more. You can't do that. You can't even think your way into a closer walk with God. &gt;&gt; But you hear that word. You absorb that word. &gt;&gt; Say, "I've heard it before." Hear it again. &gt;&gt; It'll wash you when you don't even know you're being washed. &gt;&gt; And it'll clothe you. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, he even prayed and cried out to God, "Let me clothe the bride." &gt;&gt; Do you hear it, friends? &gt;&gt; Let me clothe the bride. &gt;&gt; Do you think God heard that? that's gone into the heavens. Are you bride? &gt;&gt; There's only one that can clothe you. &gt;&gt; That vindicated messenger. Not what I think he said. What he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, I tell you, I'm completely absorbed. I'm completely consumed. [Applause] There's never been a people &gt;&gt; that has been had the privilege of hearing what we hear. &gt;&gt; And God has sent that to you so that you won't have to miss it. &gt;&gt; And if he sent a messenger and said, "Don't miss it." &gt;&gt; You can be sure he's provided a way for you to make sure you don't miss it. [Applause] Let's stand, shall we? &gt;&gt; Oh, my loving brother, &gt;&gt; when the world's on fire, don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? Oh, hide me over in the rock of aes.

He's a vile, wicked one. &gt;&gt; Sister Charmaine, I want to say to you, there's a voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; And up there it declares even now, I am the Lord that healthareth thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that voice is sounding through the bride of Jesus Christ. Any other person sick and afflicted, utter with your void voice the voice you'll hear again someday. I am the Lord that health thee. Are you delivered? Are you bound? If you're bound by anything, Jesus Christ did not come to bind you. He came to loose you. And let your voice be heard. He that the Son sets free is free indeed. And that voice is in the heavens. I heard a voice from the heavens. The tabernacle of God is with men. [Music] &gt;&gt; Everyone pray. &gt;&gt; Everyone just break out into prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Break out into prayer. &gt;&gt; Let your words be heard again. Oh, sister Charmaine, in the name of Jesus Christ, we cannot add further to the words of God. I am the Lord that health thee. And the words of our Lord Jesus Christ said, rebuke the devil and he will flee. Resist the devil and he will flee. We speak life into these arms. We speak oh God that this affliction shall pass from her. We pray, oh God, that you will give her the medication, a heavenly medication, a supernatural medication, a supernatural deliverance, a supernatural healing in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For the glory of God, for the glory of God, for the glory of God is this arm that gives pain. Can you lift this arm? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For the glory of God. For the glory of God. Lord Jesus, restore this arm. Restore this body. Restore this lamb. Oh God. Give my precious sister her inheritance. In the finished works of Calvary. Oh God, remove distress. I pray. Father in the name of Jesus and sister Charmaine, the great secret is to praise him and to thank him and to give glory to God. Let your eyes be fixed upon Calvary, the finished work of Calvary. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. May you receive it in Jesus Christ's name for his glory. I prayed for this for his glory alone. Sister Charmaine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Virtue of the resurrected Christ. &gt;&gt; I have declared that you're here, Lord. And now you will prove it to our sister. You'll prove it to our sister in Jesus for your glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Almighty one. Almighty one. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory.

Oh God, &gt;&gt; we speak only those things we desire to hear again in your presence. &gt;&gt; In your presence. Thank you, Father. In in everything we'll give him thanks. [Music] In everything I give you thanks I give you thanks. I give you thanks to you Lord. [Music] Give the King of Kings all as an anthem in the good times. In the good times, praise his name.
