TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen bless our deacons we appreciate them it's not an easy job I wouldn't want it and we appreciate them very much I'm gonna ask the Senior Choir if you would go ahead and just standing start getting ready at this time they're gonna come and sing for us and then we're gonna sing a song for you that's called Psalm 33 and so I thought it would be beneficial if maybe I read you a portion of Psalm 33 so you can know where the song comes from 34 there we go I had to look myself all right Psalm 34 the first the first nine verses says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord be hump the humble shall hear thereof and be glad old magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles hallelujah the angel of the Lord and camp a throne about them that fear him and deliver at them Oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him will fear the Lord he hid Saints for there is no want to them that fear him and then God bless you we trust this will be a blessing to you and then we'll just turn the service to our brother Tom afterward [Music] I saw Lulu and he

with us let's sing that course hallelujah magnify the Lord with me is we just invite her brother Tom to come amen and bring the word this morning let's just sing that by chorus together [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey man let's just do that right now let's glorify Him our dear Heavenly Father we have come to glorify the king not just for the now but forever to lift up the holy name in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ you're altogether lovely Lord we love you this morning for what you've done and the lives of your children Lord as we look around the room and we see the redeemed or one great day will be when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin will sing and dance about blowing around the glorious throne of God praising your holy name and we thank you for the atmosphere that's here this morning just pray Lord that you'll come and speak individually to our hearts we understand or the hour we're living in and that time in this season where him father I just pray that you'll anoint speaker and hearer the Word of God be magnified man be pushed aside father we love you and ask it all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen god bless you all you may have your seats for a moment as the choir makes their way well brother Ben you're a real dad with those pictures of those beautiful twins the gifts from God and you know in this age that people don't want children it's a fact and to me they're their gifts of God they make a family they make something that's real and I'm sure it'll be a real dad to them boys I had great time with boys so I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time we're going to be having special meetings coming up this following week and it will be brother Aaron McGarry will be speaking to us Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning we're doing like a camp like we do at camp there will be no Wednesday service so you put that down everybody's always got a question is there this and that well now you heard it from the pulpit there's no Wednesday but there's Friday Saturday and Sunday on the Saturday there's an activity for the young people and it ends up with a I had a picnic place I believe that they've got chosen out it's up on the bulletin board for you to see everybody's invited and on Sunday if you can remember who or counselors if your counselors would like you to sit with your cabins I know some of us are old and we forget real quickly but we can get you a list and we'd like you to step right up front and sit with your cabins and then parents will be right behind them is that okay and I think we're gonna have a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord well it's Mother's Day and of course the world makes something very special of it and it's the only time I think they buy their mother's flowers and brother Brown makes lose to that fact he says it's the only time they even hear from them save them or you know I guess the flowers or chocolates but Mother's Day is a special day and indeed it with our mothers not one of us would be here that's a fact and we won't get into the biology of that but brother branham he holds the mother high and huh and of course you've heard it often the mother is the fifth gospel and we've got a lot of new mothers since we've had a lot of weddings over the last year or two we've have a lot of new mothers and whether they understand the gifts that God gives them or not we just pray that God will give you wisdom to raise them to nurture them around the gospel sing gospel songs to them read gospel stories and Bible stories and they Center your home around Christ and train a child in the way that she'll go and it shall not depart and you say well brother Tom we've seen them depart but I've also seen them come back so if you've got the negative I'll take the positive thank you very much and scripture is Scripture if you want to believe it I'll take Bibles Bible and if you want to stand on the Bible that's where I want to stand brother Branham said God grant this morning that mothers who have wandered away from God that they will come to you this morning and recognize that the word mother means one who has been gone been been gotten by God we realize how much of a jewel they are and how I know this statement I had boys come in from you know whatever activity it was and they come busting through the door and they come running in and they go mom and I'm standing right there it's not hi dad how you doing your mom I'm sorry I'm with my Swiss cheese come on well IIIi don't get it but then I understand what brother Branham says so see a child listens to its mother some little touch from mother a child will listen to when it's hurt it'll go to mother for consolation before it goes to the Father now I understand because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives a mother to be like that I mean a real mother I believe that mothers are honorable and godly so god bless you mothers on Mother's Day hey man so I think that's it for the announcements if you don't mind standing return to the Word of God since it's Mother's Day and I and I'm assuming that some of the mothers are going out for meals I won't keep you long and I sometimes we see them depart because they've got a appointment at a certain time but we just want to lay we've been speaking on trained trained trained for battle trained for battle and this morning I want to preach on trained and battle ready trained and battle ready and you know it's an amazing fact as we found out last week that there was the only a few weeks and they they take a young man and they put him in the Army for boot camp and boom they put him on the Battlefront in just a few short weeks I think the RCMP trained their men in six months I carry guns and and have responsibilities for the law of the land and we've were were more trained than that we're more trained than that to handle any situation that comes our way and we have to stop being children we have we say we are the bride and bride is a mature person and then if you save old brother Tom I'm the bride of Jesus Christ well then you're putting your place you're putting yourself in a place a position of maturity and I believe that that's where the church has to stand in and sometimes you know around the dinner table we have told our own children to grow up because they whine and complain about so silly little things and you know we can just do that here amongst the church whine and complain when we're actually getting ready for a body change and so it changes life it changes your perspective changes your understanding when you know then that I'm to be bride ready and she made herself ready she made herself ready and what the word the word makes the bride ready so please turn with me as I'm going to just take a little springboard off from last week but I want you to turn to James chapter 1 verse 18 buddy they're Hebrews James James chapter 1 verse 18 and and uh most of the the I trust the continuity of the of the thought comes across that brother branham makes that statement I've been preaching it here probably preached in Switzerland that when the bride realized her position and so now we start to understand what or was understanding what our position is in the scripture James 1:18 Bible reads of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that is powerful Scripture and James is writing to the bride this is a love letter to the bride so now let's take a look of it of his own will begat he us with the word of what truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of the creature second Thessalonians 2 and thirteen III dude I don't mind people writing down scriptures as I've had brothers come to me recently and said you preached that back about five years ago on that scripture well that's a good that's a good correlation but I sure didn't preach the same message I preached five years ago scripture scripture I when I go on holidays I also go to the same spot so there's good things at that same spot so don't mind us repeating ourselves on the scripture so second Thessalonians 2 verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you rather than beloved of the Lord because God half from the beginning what has he done God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truce why the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free verse 14 where unto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ let's pray father once again we have read your word and your word is true it's amen to them that believe so lord help our believing this morning to believe all that the scriptures say even of us and Lord that we pray God that you will speak to us so individually that we will not be the same person as we came in these doors we pray in Jesus name Amen amen you may have your seats I appreciate the announcements of the of the Deacons and the Deacons are the policemen of the church so that's what the Prophet taught us people say well I don't wanna listen to a deacon well then you're not in the message so y'all got it right down right down there or we live so you listen and everything will be fine battle ready for the greatest battle for your life battle ready there's a cost that comes with every war there's a cost and we went over some facts and figures last week but we didn't go over these facts and figures we went into the costly war of how it cost for personal welfare of the millions told millions that are destroyed by war and we went in some of those statistics and it's a sobering thing but it's no more less sobering to know that if you highbreed the truth you're dead and that is Satan's chore or that's his job if he can make you believe in untruth he'll canker your soul and take your soul to hell and so we say well 20 million lost their lives but the realm said billions have lost their lives because they believed false doctrine so that's why it's important to know that you've been chosen from the beginning in truth do you get that you've been chosen from the beginning in truth truth is very important a cost of a war financially is is mind-boggling and mind-blowing the materials that are needed 338 billion dollars that the United States of America spent on World War one what could that have done for humanity or mankind but Satan isn't interested in that he's only interested in destruction and brother Brad makes his statements Satan feeds on the flesh of his own children so you think that you're in a picnic you're not in a picnic you're in the greatest battle for life costs of world war two it exceeds that goes from 338 billion the cost of world war two in america alone in today's dollars is four point one trillion dollars spent that's a lot of money that's a lot of costs us deployed in World War one 4.7 million men world war ii deployed 12.2 million men how many were lost how many were shot how many were killed but how many were protected by the divine hand of God so that the gene pool of your grandparents and your parents could be alive so that you could hear the gospel and become a son of God to me that's a greater thing that's a greater thing that God can watch over at a multiples militants from the Ukraine to Russia Europe America Canada and to think that he's watched it over it all so that that gene line could come through now brother Bram said this he says the enemy the enemy tries to take your land and sometimes we willingly give it up because we don't want to fight I remember I was going back I probably mentioned that years ago we moved to weird Cloverdale we had a I called the sack lot it was a pie shaped lot and I had a nice gentleman that moved next door to me and he want to put up a hedge and I was studying so I you know I don't I hate landscaping I hate dirt I don't that's what I just like I don't cut lawns I am not that type of guy so I come outside and Rick's got the line and he's doing a plumb line to put the hedge down the edge of the property he says well we can't find the far ten so we will just say it's a boat here and I said oh yeah about there doesn't mine I mean when he what's you know five inches or six inches you know but take 300 feet or something that's you know fair bit and I'm Scottish you know so I I go back to my room I started studying and I ain't on this I'm studying I'm stewing I think how dare him assume my land hey this is serious I paid for it and will pay for it for a long time through a mortgage so I said to myself self get up from your studies and go outside and go find that pin because every plot has a pin where you can measure where your property is there's a legal legal description so we go and sure enough these six inches over on my land and I felt so proud of myself that I actually got back my own land which mine already and you don't sometimes we get so proud of ourselves of taking something back but it was yours already you didn't even have to fight for it's already given yours it's given to you and so now the saints of God we've been given the Word of God and we need to use it for the benefit of the gospel it's our property this is our land that is why we started last week with Jonathan and his armor-bearer Jonathan realized that those rotten Philistines we're on their god-given land everybody understand that you know there's different types of wars war for economy war for just you know plunder there's different wars wars for principle brother Bram talks about but now what was happening the Philistines were on the land that God had given Israel and Jonathan just happened to be that type of person that says you know what devil I'm tired of you on my property and so then he doesn't tell he doesn't make a big hurry of it he doesn't tell his father King Saul of it he just tells his armor-bearer and he says to his armor-bearer he says to the young man that bears his armor come let's see let's go see this garrison of uncircumcised he knew what he was going to face Wes he knew exactly what he was going to face a garrison by himself his armor-bearer wasn't his second man his armor-bearer was only bearing his armor needed for him to fight the fight so that I give credit to the armor bearer because he had to have confident in whom he's carrying armor for but I loved his attitude as we read he said to the armor bearer come and see let's go see this garrison of the uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there's no there is no restraint to the Lord to say by many or by few and the armor bearer said unto him do all that's in thine heart turn thee behold I am with thee according to thy heart and I so we preached on it and we made that little subsection one of them I'm one of those type of armor bearer whatever was in Jonathan's or whatever is in Christ part I'm with Christ I'm with the word I don't care what anybody else says we're going to state what the word says and that to me is very important and I and I loved how you have to when you take a position you take a position on the word Jesus took his position that he is going to raise on the third day because he was going back to what the psalmist had written that God would not leave his soul in Hell where the RAM said it was one scripture that raised him from the grave one scripture and jesus knew he was not going to stay in that doom so now what was what was in Jonathan's mind when he was thinking that the Lord can deliver well could he go back to Deuteronomy could he go back to scripture and the scripture reads in Deuteronomy 32 and 31 chase a thousand and to ten thousand I got big eight men on that night of course that's Old Testament right that's Old Testament how should one chase a thousand and to put ten thousand a flight except their rock have sold them and the Lord had shut them up then if the Lord is able to deliver one to a thousand two to ten thousand couldn't he deliver a garrison in to Jonathan's hands so then I could say he's trained and he's battle ready trained and battle ready we ourselves find ourselves continually brother Browne said in a battle continually that doesn't mean they're just in a battle on this Sunday continually in a battle but we've now been given Scripture come on stay with me because I make it nation and then you build on the foundation I wonder I want to take you along with me so if Jonathan could take one scripture teri and go after a garrison climb a mountain a thorny mountain and you know I had to climb a thorny mountain sit this week you know you got to climb some thorny mountains but you know what we're not going to give in we can't give in we're battle trained trained and ready the Bible says to us are you ready are you ready now so Jonathan takes a scripture let's say out of Deuteronomy one could send a thousand to ten thousand so your faith has got to be based on something and our faith is based on shrews you've got that that's what we started the whole scriptures reading today we're born by truth all right so now I'm going to give you troops are you mature enough class now to take truth truth is even the mystery that has been hid from ages and from generations as Colossians one in 26 but is now made manifest to his Saints now in the present Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so he said well Paul wrote it for the Colossians no I want you to say Paul wrote that for me he wrote it for me so now even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generation but now is made manifest or is now unveiled itself or has now become made plain to the Saints to whom are you listening who's the to whom exactly - to whom to whom god would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles come on battle ready battle train which is Christ in you the hope of glory it's been hit throughout the ages but we've been going through Christ as the mystery of God revealed this great God has now come down and unveiled himself or manifested himself to you to you you can say it to yourself this God has come down and made himself real to me whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect or mature in Christ Jesus is everybody still with me because I'm not going to I'm not going to keep you long but I'm going to preach the Word of God to you because you need the word I need the word you hear too much junk through the week that Denton's the voice of the Resurrection many voices brother Branham said in this last age and those voices are too dead in the voice of God and so that one Sunday why don't you put on good hearing just put your you know if even go like this you get a better hearing yeah you do I'm hearing even you myself better now so if you need to hear it just go like this now will tell me that you really want to hear what I'm saying all right are you ready brother George is lovely to see you home Galatians 2 you don't need to turn Galatians 2 and 20 I crucified with Christ then he's a man I died on that rock I died with him at Calvary I rose with him I am crucified with him are you listening Saint Paul is writing I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i yet know i hears the mystery now being revealed yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in thought what flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who what what did he do loves me we could we could just preach on this one Scripture and stay here all morning this is lovely Scripture now I live the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who what loved me and gave himself for me amen BAM says this but the Christ that made you stop you're drinking you're smoking you're lying stealing that saved you from a life of drunkenness from riling from sin and a devil's grave if God can do that for you he can save you from your TV your cancer a man if God could turn a mess like me around and don't you don't have to look too far because you don't have to look about two inches down your nose and look at yourself and say if God could save me and God could deliver me then he could deliver me from anything why because it's God in you the hope of glory I know you're looking for the preacher to do it for you or that maybe the elders did lay their hands on you but now this is a personal revelation of Christ in you the hope of glory I'm not saying any of that is wrong but don't lean on that when you've got enough power in you the Prophet said to careí world and dwell on them and if he wouldn't have made the end of the sentence and said but he's bound by a law because I'll tell you one thing right now I'd be out of here and so would you so then the God that was able to turn you around from stealing and drunkenness and rile rile is living in sin in a devil's grave a God that can do that can deliver you from your TB from your cancer he can deliver you because he boasts like Goliath he boasts like a Goliath and here's your counsel don't take his boasts David never he was battle trained God had a way of training him already in the desert he had a lion ready for him out there he said for the time I'm not through so many trials and you came through them did you come through them well then if you came through those ones you're gonna come through the one you're in now don't listen to the devil's boast don't listen stand right now here's your counsel brother Hank god bless you nice to see you here's your counsel stand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you challenge him to a showdown come on we're putting it back on to your life you do something Andrew you're gonna have children that are teenagers you might want not want to fall asleep in that service when they're out trying to have a drink with their friends so why didn't I train them when they were so young and say don't go that way boy don't go that way wake up and that service want to train them up train them up come to church straighten them up and tell your children there's something for you this morning that God wants you day here daddy how come everybody else is happy but you're never happy oh boy that one really took the real turning didn't it huh mom how come there's other sisters that waits our hand like this but you never do nothing how come I mean something to them and not to you that's what it's saying that's what it's saying even a good nod once and again helps the preacher but why don't you stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to a showdown brother Brown says hallelujah I feel real religious it's the way I feel right about right now yes sir you must know we're in rapture time you must know who you are at that season positionally in Christ if the believer just knew his position and brother Brown says and here's the prophecy she will one day okay if she only knew her position that's the question here's the prophecy she will one day why don't you say this day this day I'm learning my position this is my position now she will one day when she knowed her position God's Great Spirit is here his Holy Spirit is ready to fall on anybody who will believe it when I read that and I put that down I said I want to do a jump as you believe I believe it I want the Holy Spirit to fall on me not just on the lower balcony but I find the upper balcony I want the Holy Ghost to fall on you if you can believe it you can believe it don't allow just coming to church to be Church for you and your children does interested in coming to church that you make them come to church why don't you put an effort in and start pulling on the Word of God so that the preacher could preach so your children could get saved so they could get the Holy Ghost no but we're just so staid when we used to come so energetic so ready for anything ah but we get to be teachers now of the message and brother Bram said he says in in one place he says teachers will lean back to teaching and on their own ability rather than on the leadership of the Holy Spirit it doesn't matter with your teacher preacher pastor brother Brown said away with ability I'll wait with a village human ability we don't want human ability we want the holy spirit to start speaking to us so now listen if a believer really knew his position and the Great Spirit is here the Holy Ghost is here ready to fall on any who believe then he asked the question do you believe he said God promised it then God will do it you're in Christ come on I'm showing your position you're in Christ do you want the Holy Ghost to fall do you believe then it will happen because you're in Christ if you want the Holy Ghost to fall you believe it believe it Lord Jesus baptize us with the Holy Ghost and fire baptize us listen Saints if you knew what was going on in teenagers bedrooms you wouldn't be sitting there so smug you'd be a probably up at the altar crying out for God for their salvation we're living in a wicked wicked time but we have got a message that will defeat the devil anytime anyplace anywhere so the end time message meets the endtime condition so now we are believers and we're believing God's Word God's promise that you've got it God will do it because you're in Christ and you wonder why somebody's sitting in the fuel have a Holy Ghost rejoice in time because they're locked in with God amen Jesus Christ robbed Satan of everything so now we're coming to our position and we're going after the devil we're not gonna believe glass boasts dr. Dogo I tried tell me you're not strong enough to preach this morning as a devil you're a liar I can do all things through Christ Jesus that's strengtheneth me it's easy to put it off on somebody else but they've got their own load people have their own burdens we've got to fight for our position in our own backyard that's my six inches amen he bought that six inches for me brother ray and no devil gonna take my six inches not gonna take my wife's not gonna take my children not gonna take my family can I hear an amen we just settle down and do I know it's time to charge he's the captain of the Lord of Hosts we're ready to take our land we've had squatters on it it's time to drive the squatter off amen hallelujah Jesus Christ robbed you Satan of everything he spoiled your principalities your powers and your dominions his domain reigns over heaven and earth your king your King Jesus reigns over heavens and earth and we're subjects of that domain amen hallelujah that puts him where he belongs the devil down there Christ is the victor you're the elected come on you're the anointed you've been possessed li placed in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then why don't you tell the devil this morning devil you are defeated come on come on brother Gary you can say the devil you have to feed it get off my land I know who reigns over this Dominion I know whom I have believed and I know the king and priest of this Dominion this great Melchizedek who met Abraham after the battle is the same one that is amongst us this morning who is this Melchizedek he's the Great King of glory King priest King Jesus oh my god don't live under our god-given privileges what Adam lost in the fall are you ready how many know this quote what Adam lost in the fall well what Adam lost in the fall Christ has redeemed back for us come on come on just say Amen what Adam lost in the fall Christ redeemed it back for us we've had it through a book of symbols for ages and for thousands of years but in this day this day a mighty angel came down to let you know your position in this land hallelujah you think coming to clover little Bible Way is coming to church no sir coming to Cloverdale Bible Way is coming to a building you're the church and let's have search let's have charts let's have church ruse where you lift up hands and say my vows has come my redeemer is amongst us it's at church hallelujah all Adam lost in the fall what brother Bram said did he lose brother branham said Adam lost fellowship oh I love this Adam lost what fellowship but at the cross brother Brown said in God reveal in simplicity he said at the cross the blood was shed which was the bleach and that bleach that was falling was the wash away all sin and that sin closed the gulf for man and God so they could have one fellowship Jesus wants fellowship what Adam lost to the floor was fellowship what Adam wants in the fall was eternal life why Adam lost in the fall with health and strength but this message has come back to give you what Adam lost come on oh I wish we could have church this morning I wish we just glorified God and lift up his holy name and give him thanks for this great message that he's given us in this hour we would not know anything I said right now unless a messenger came you wouldn't be sitting here you wouldn't be understanding the book came down the mighty angel came down the book was open to bring you back to whatever loss so that you could know your position in Jesus Christ so when Satan comes on your territory you push back a me push back you know I had it I had to get the legal description to show where the pin wants and do the pacing and figured out the yardage in the diameter of my lot to find the pin so I could find my land but we had to go and get a legal description God has given us a legal description called his word give me back my six inches I don't care he's taking 1 inch 1/4 inch give me my land give me my home come on mothers this is Mother's Day give me my children you can cup your ears if you want oh yeah we're just about ready to go and then how are you saying not mean it could happen is right now but you say but my son's not here but he could be at his bedside he could be driving right now it tears down his shapes he give me say oh Jesus why am I like this save me [Applause] he can do it anywhere at anytime it's not on your time or where you want it it's where God wants to do it isn't that right Victor it's where God wants to do it isn't that right brother John you've been given examples did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for did you ever stop to think what he redeemed us for how he gave us eternal life and brought us back to eternal fellowship he brought us back Michael to eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore all that Adam lost in the fall fellowship fellowship fellowship divine hallelujah Adam losses inheritance in the earth now it's passed from his hand to the one he sold it out - and that was Satan he sold it out to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning see how hostile reasoning is - faith Lajja most it's not logical the gospel is not logical don't ever get it down to being logical by faith Moses by faith Noah by faith Abraham by faith Sara by faith Tom by faked him by faith John it's not my reason it's my face [Music] hallelujah casting down all imagination so anything that tells you you can't have it you cast it down right now at this place at this junction in this service throw it down cast down all not some all imagination casts all imagination and every high thing that exalts itself why would it exalt himself above I gates the knowledge of God well you've got this condition who says so who says so doctor says you got this who says so who says so it's whether you want to receive the box of snakes who says so your position so the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they're not physical they're not weapons of flesh and they're not weapon of flesh and blood our weapons as we said last week are what divinely powerful the word is nigh thee even in thy what whose mouth what whose mouth then it is divine powerful divinely powerful for the destruction of Satan's fortresses hey man we cast down carnal reasoning I don't care what doctor says you can't have children I'm telling you according to the Word of God you can have children I don't care what the doctors tell you it's time to push back push back is there anything wrong with a milking system no they can assist you they can help you but don't deny what God promised you they might say this is this and this is this and this is that so this is that no you can come to this and this but not that because there that might be different than your that I don't you followed that but that's that brother Bram says this and we've been taking it now for five weeks all we are today is a display of his attributes OBE are you getting that Saints that's all we are today so an attribute is now in the thought of God so now all we are this display of his attributes first he was not even God we would just call him the eternal one he wasn't God because the word English word God means object object of what object of worship and there was nothing to worship so then he's the eternal one but his brother Bisco started this off long time ago maybe six weeks ago the main fountain he's the main fountain of all intelligence so there is eternal one the main fountain of all intelligence fountain of all intelligence when there was not an atom a molecule or nothing light no star no moon no nothing God what we know is God the Great Spirit that was eternal never did begin never did in he was there and in him was attributes so in God were attributes so you're getting that it was attributes to be God than his attributes to be father then there was an attribute to be a son there was an attribute to be a savior attribute to be healed so in that fountain were all those attributes so guess where you came from that same fountain where you can say yes I come from God I go back to God we came from that same fountain it was attributes you see being manifested so we took a manifested attribute are those that are to become visible a manifested attribute of God is an attribute that gets manifested so if in that fountain is healing where's healing in your attribute is in you all the chemicals has reported that glass and I put it in that little cup this island doesn't have the same volume but it's not got all the same elements that's in you your position now listen he says now you're manifested you have become visible are you ready for this ready really ready I'm watching you in the back now you ready for this you've come from the unseen to the scene you have come from the unseen to the seen from the hidden to the known you've come from the hidden to the known through what through the sacrificial death at Calvary his resurrection it positionally placed them his Church in this realm oh it gets deep doesn't it gets deep it gets deeper than just reading the title you better read what's inside the book that same invisible God could come into the individual and make the Word of God visible what's he doing he's trying to tell you you're the word manifested oh my oh my my oh my oh my didn't can you can you take this then Christ a mystery God reveal his church is himself revealed oh I'll let you chew on now and that was a good one to chew on brother Frank not just a line not just a quote but something that's real David something that's very real or he wouldn't say it his church is himself but revealed his church is himself revealed amen do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is God what is he training you for God is training you for the final showdown to prove to Satan you got Eve in the garden but you will not get this Eve in Satan's Eden and she is not going to fall hey man why because that we know our position where we came from predestinated by truth chosen of God God is training you for the last showdown he's training you for the great battle if the luck could be deceived but she cannot Matthew 24 he says right here in a time of trouble Daniel 12 more trouble than ever was on the face of the earth he's straining you to stand on the Word of God and deny Satan at every turn and not just in church but when you go out these doors and you go to your hole and the devil gets on your case you take this word and you conquer him because if you want to write down that scripture to me that scripture is so tremendous where the Bible talks about that this glorious mystery was hid throughout the ages is now being revealed to you let's see revealing himself for for you to stand in this great battle for you to say I will go and fight not I will go and run least the whole message is for you I'm not running no more no sir no more I know my position in Christ he called me by truth I have been birthed by truth I'm an attribute from God's mind I'm to manifest his thoughts and his thought and I am his victory [Music] those are manifested thoughts now here to manifest them amen he wants man and women I like that I'm glad he put you sisters there he to rise up this morning to rise up this morning and say I am take God at His Word come on mother days mother's day I'll take God at His Word stand up and say I take God in His Word I will not be tonight I'll be like Jacob did of old I will not let you go until you bless me I will not leave this

change these bodies I've been trained to put on the change who else has been trained nobody out there I've been trained to change God wants men and women who will go fight for him I'm not saying that he's saying that better ends I'm sure you read that and you wrote it he wants men and women who will say I'll go I'll go I'll go fight a man I'll fight for Bruce I'll fight for him we'll fight won't we surely will fight well fight for your crystal we'll fight we'll fight we've been trained to fight I'm just trying to hear some word and go to church and clap our hands and but it was not a nice service there's thousands in this message that are going that way but not me and not my house I'm gonna serve God with all my heart on my mind all my soul all my stress hello I'm not gonna be out looking for believer I deny that thing I deny it that's what Satan would love to get this church but some lukewarm believers nod your head right come to church spend an hour 15 minutes more Tim more
