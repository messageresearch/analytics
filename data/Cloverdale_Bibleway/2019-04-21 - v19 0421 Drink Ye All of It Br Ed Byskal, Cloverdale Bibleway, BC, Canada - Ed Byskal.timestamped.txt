[2:18] He lives. He lives. I serve a risen
[2:21] savior in the world today.
[2:24] I serve a risen savior.
[2:29] He's in the world today
[2:33] and I know that he is living.
[2:38] Whatever men may say
[2:42] for I see his hand of mercy.
[2:46] I hear his voice of cheer.
[2:51] And just the time I need him,
[2:55] he's always

[3:12] A long life away.

[3:26] You ask me how I know he lives.
[3:33] He lives
[3:36] within
[3:38] my heart.
[3:41] In all the world around me, I see his
[3:47] loving care.
[3:50] And though my heart grows weary,
[3:54] I never will despair,
[3:58] I know that he is leading.
[4:03] through all the stormy blast.
[4:07] The day of his appearing
[4:11] will come at last.
[4:15] He lives.
[4:17] He lives.
[4:19] Christ Jesus lives today.
[4:23] He walks with me and talks with me. A
[4:28] long life away.
[4:32] He lives.
[4:34] He lives.
[4:36] Salvation to impart.
[4:41] You ask me how. I know. He lives.
[4:48] He lives
[4:51] within
[4:53] my heart. I like this verse. Rejoice.
[4:58] Rejoice. Christian,
[5:01] lift up your voice.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Sing eternal,
[5:06] &gt;&gt; eternal,
[5:07] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[5:10] to Jesus Christ the king.
[5:14] The hope of all who seek him, the help
[5:19] of all who find him. None other is so
[5:25] loving,
[5:27] so good. Oh, do you find that to be so?
[5:30] For he lives,
[5:33] he lives.

[6:17] sing that third verse again. Rejoice,
[6:19] rejoice, oh Christian. and lift up your
[6:22] voices and sing. Can you imagine how it
[6:25] was when Jesus was sitting on the rock
[6:29] outside the tomb? They probably weren't
[6:32] quiet. They were probably singing just
[6:34] like you all the way back, "Tell my
[6:37] disciples,
[6:38] &gt;&gt; come and see."
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that how you feel this morning?
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Rejoice. Rejoice, oh
[6:45] Christian.
[6:47] Lift up your voice and sing. Oh eternal
[6:53] hallelujah
[6:56] to Jesus Christ the king,
[7:00] the hope of all who seek him, the help
[7:06] of all who find him. None other is so
[7:11] loving,
[7:13] so good and kind.
[7:17] He lives.
[7:19] He lives.
[7:21] Christ Jesus lives today.
[7:25] He walks with me and talks with me. A
[7:30] long life narrow away.
[7:34] He lives.
[7:36] He lives.
[7:38] salvation to impart.
[7:43] You ask me how I know he lives.
[7:50] He lives
[7:53] within
[7:55] my heart.
[8:00] He's alive
[8:02] and well,
[8:05] living in me
[8:07] to tell
[8:09] the world
[8:12] that he is
[8:14] the same.
[8:18] He's the same
[8:23] today
[8:25] and forever.

[8:36] He's alive
[8:38] and well.
[8:40] Living in me to tell
[8:45] the world
[8:47] that he is the same.
[8:53] He's the same yesterday,
[8:58] today,
[9:00] and forever.
[9:02] Jesus
[9:04] is alive
[9:07] and well.
[9:10] He's alive. He's alive and well.
[9:15] in
[9:17] to tell
[9:19] the world
[9:22] that he is the same.
[9:28] He's the same yesterday.

[9:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, how he loves you and me.
[10:01] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[10:12] He gave himself.
[10:16] What more could he do?
[10:22] Oh, how he loves you.
[10:27] Oh, how he loves me.
[10:32] Oh, how he loves you and me. If you know
[10:37] him, just slip your hand up to him this
[10:40] morning. Oh, how he loves you. You and
[10:46] me.
[10:51] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[11:01] He gave himself.
[11:06] What could he do?
[11:11] Oh, how he loves you.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, how he loves me.
[11:21] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; I love
[11:33] you.
[11:36] I love

[11:42] That's
[11:43] what Calary
[11:46] said.
[11:51] I love
[11:54] you.
[11:56] I love
[11:59] you.
[12:01] I love you.
[12:04] written
[12:06] in red. That's a personal message to you
[12:10] this morning. I love
[12:14] you.
[12:17] I love
[12:19] you.
[12:22] That's
[12:24] what Calary
[12:27] said.
[12:31] I love
[12:34] you. Oh, I love
[12:39] you.
[12:42] I love you.
[12:46] Oh, do you receive that this morning? Do
[12:49] you receive that for your own life? I
[12:52] love
[12:54] you.
[12:56] I love
[12:59] you.
[13:02] That's
[13:03] what Calary
[13:06] said.
[13:10] He said, "I love
[13:14] you.
[13:16] I love
[13:19] you.
[13:21] I love you."
[13:24] Written
[13:26] in red. He said, "I love you.
[13:31] I love
[13:34] you.
[13:36] I love
[13:39] you."
[13:42] That's

[14:11] &gt;&gt; yes.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[14:18] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[14:21] Jesus.
[14:23] The love of God.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Greater far than ever tongue
[14:28] can tell.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; We love his presence.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; If you have a need in your heart this
[14:43] morning,
[14:44] &gt;&gt; as brother John Andy's comes to lead us
[14:47] in prayer this morning, just lift up
[14:48] your voice.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Cry out, "Oh Jesus,
[14:52] &gt;&gt; thank you for your blood.
[14:55] Pass me not, oh gentle savior. Hear my
[14:57] humble cry.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Brother John. God bless you.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to continue to
[15:06] worship you, Lord Jesus. This is the
[15:09] house of worship. We don't never want to
[15:11] get it down to a formality of a Easter
[15:14] morning service. We want to break all of
[15:16] that right now and realize, Lord, that
[15:20] you're alive and well this morning.
[15:22] You're walking up and down the aisles of
[15:24] this building out throughout the
[15:26] hallways.
[15:28] Father God, we worship you today, Jesus.
[15:31] You're not dead and formal. You're not
[15:34] something that's chains of religion.
[15:37] God, we want to drop all of that, too.
[15:39] and any unbelief. Father, we want to
[15:42] come with our arms lifted up, Lord
[15:44] Jesus, in total surrender that the
[15:47] quickening power that raised you from
[15:49] the dead would come and quicken these
[15:51] mortal bodies. Quicken our spirits,
[15:54] quicken our souls. We're asking for a
[15:57] complete translation, transformation,
[16:00] Lord, for every brother, every sister,
[16:03] God, every man and woman, every child,
[16:06] God. Let this be a different Easter
[16:09] service for us. Let our eyes be open.
[16:12] Let our ears be open. Let our hearts be
[16:15] open. If this was our last Easter, Lord
[16:19] Jesus, we would want you to come and
[16:21] have 100% liberty and freedom. Pour out
[16:25] your spirit upon us, Lord Jesus. Forgive
[16:28] us of our sin. That what was Calvary was
[16:31] all about, Lord Jesus. for the blood to
[16:34] come down and cover a generation, cover
[16:38] years and years of men and women's sins
[16:41] and their lives. Surely, Lord, if you
[16:43] made a way for the nature, you can make
[16:46] a way for us today. Hands are lifted up
[16:49] with needs also and unspoken requests.
[16:52] Lord, there's burdens. We live in a dark
[16:55] hour when Satan's trying to keep the
[16:58] tomb closed and keep everything locked
[17:01] up, Lord. But that Easter morning, you
[17:04] proved that your life was present on the
[17:07] earth. Jesus, you are alive and well. We
[17:12] thank you for sending us a message
[17:14] that's broke open the seals and revealed
[17:18] to us, Jesus Christ, more than a church
[17:22] building, more than a religion, more
[17:24] than just dead works, God, but a living
[17:27] relationship.
[17:29] Each one of us can have that today.
[17:32] Lord, we're just simple people. We're
[17:35] just people that are small, but we serve
[17:38] a great big God.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; We don't want to limit you by our
[17:42] understanding or by our mental
[17:44] capacities. You are greater than any
[17:47] situation.
[17:49] Any sin, any unbelief.
[17:51] Lord, we pray the bleach would just drop
[17:54] down upon any heart that has sin or has
[17:58] uh things covered over. Satan is a
[18:00] tormentor.
[18:02] He's uh put sickness on people.
[18:07] He keeps people lost and bound with
[18:10] chains. But this is what Easter is all
[18:13] about. You came to break all of that off
[18:15] your people. By your stripes, we were
[18:19] healed.
[18:20] Some need to draw benefits from that
[18:23] today. Some need to draw from those
[18:25] virtues. Oh God, we are a needy people,
[18:28] Jesus.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; But we believe there's power, wonder
[18:32] working power.
[18:34] Maybe one of our children is going to
[18:36] touch you today. Maybe one of our
[18:38] teenagers, God, is going to have that
[18:41] experience, Jesus. Maybe it's a mother.
[18:44] Maybe it's a father. Maybe it's a single
[18:46] person. Maybe it's a visitor. Maybe it's
[18:49] an elder who's going to recognize Lord
[18:52] Jesus.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, is there anything we can do to
[18:57] take the grave clothes off of one
[18:59] another, too? We want to understand,
[19:02] Lord, that we're are men and women and
[19:04] we need one another. Don't let us be
[19:07] looking around today strange and weird
[19:10] and nervous, but let us reach out and
[19:12] touch the Lord and pour in oil, pour in
[19:15] wine, pour in a hallelujah, pour in a
[19:18] praise the Lord. You're worthy of our
[19:20] praises, God. You gave everything for
[19:24] us.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Surely we can give our everything.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; You loved us.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Surely we can love you.
[19:34] Bless our pastor today, God. We feel
[19:37] honored that we'd have a man of God that
[19:39] was there in the service when your
[19:41] prophet would speak his last Easter
[19:44] morning service. It is the rising of the
[19:46] sun. And to have him speaking to us this
[19:50] morning from his heart to this
[19:52] generation.
[19:54] We pray that our hearts would be open
[19:56] and we'd be
[19:58] supportive of the ministry. There's
[20:01] prayer requests that were written in.
[20:02] I'm laying hands on them. You know all
[20:04] about it, Father. You know all the needs
[20:07] before we even have the need, Jesus.
[20:09] You're the way maker. You're the burden
[20:12] lifter. You're the satisfier, Jesus.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Bless the offering, too, God. And
[20:18] everyone that gives, those that cannot
[20:21] give, just may this whole day be blessed
[20:24] with your presence as we invite you,
[20:26] Father, and the singing and the songs
[20:29] and prayers and the ministry of the
[20:31] word. strengthen our pastor too, God,
[20:34] for the delivery of the word of God.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; And those that are traveling away today,
[20:39] some in other countries, and some are
[20:41] coming back, some are on vacation
[20:44] holiday, just be with your people,
[20:46] Jesus, across this globe. Let there be a
[20:49] resurrection of your people
[20:52] in Jesus name. Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John.
[21:01] Amen. Wonderful, wonderful day.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I want you to take a a minute,
[21:07] turn around, see who's sitting next to
[21:08] you. Shake hands with the person behind
[21:11] you, the person in front of you. Get all
[21:14] the jitters out of the way. Welcome all
[21:17] those that are gathered with us this
[21:20] morning, visitors in our midst. We
[21:22] certainly want to take a moment and say,
[21:24] "God bless you."
[21:26] as you have your seats this morning.
[21:29] Isn't it nice to have one another?
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is as the deacons receive the
[21:34] offering this morning.
[21:37] Amen. Real precious to be in the
[21:40] presence of God. Brother Doug, God bless
[21:42] you.
[21:44] We have a young people's service coming
[21:46] up this Friday. So, if you're a young
[21:48] person, if you have any questions about
[21:51] that, meeting is at 7:30. Brother Mike
[21:53] Andes can be contacted if you have any
[21:56] questions. Where's Brother Caleb? I see
[21:59] you up in the balcony. Is your fiance
[22:00] here? Amen. God bless you. Why don't we
[22:03] greet you this morning?
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Good morning, Sister Susie. Can you wave
[22:07] your hand real high? All right. Why
[22:09] don't we give her a nice warm welcome
[22:10] this morning? Amen.
[22:17] Amen. Soon those won't be just uh you
[22:20] know, welcome. It'll be glad you're
[22:23] here.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the way the bridegroom and
[22:27] the bride are. You know, for a while
[22:29] there's just the, you know, a little bit
[22:30] of hi, how are you? And eventually it's
[22:34] you're just always there. My wife can
[22:35] tell you after 26 years now. It's she's
[22:38] just always here.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; We don't take it for granted, but we're
[22:41] really happy that she's here. Bless you.
[22:43] It's our anniversary in a couple of
[22:45] days. So, bless you. Amen.
[22:50] Let's sing. Uh, Brother Mike Gier is
[22:52] going to come. Brother Mike, if he might
[22:54] already be ready. Because he lives, I
[22:56] can face tomorrow.
[22:58] Because he lives. Are you happy this
[23:00] morning?
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can tell that you are
[23:04] really anticipating what the Lord would
[23:05] minister through our pastor this
[23:07] morning. We do want to remember brother
[23:08] Tom. Brother uh Tim is still in Africa
[23:12] today. Brother Tom in Switzerland.
[23:16] real happy to be gathered with you that
[23:18] could come this morning.

[23:28] I can face tomorrow.
[23:33] Because
[23:35] he lives,
[23:38] all fear is gone.

[28:56] &gt;&gt; Just before we change the order of the
[28:58] service, a few young people are still
[29:00] coming in. I've asked Andrew to sing.
[29:02] had it not been for a place called Mount
[29:04] Calvary. Amen. If you know the words,
[29:08] you can sing along. I believe we've got
[29:09] it on the screen. I don't know it well
[29:12] enough or I try to help him sing it. It
[29:13] might make it worse. So, I'll just let
[29:16] those that know how to sing, we'll let
[29:17] them sing. Amen.
[29:30] Just suppose
[29:33] God searched
[29:36] through heaven
[29:40] and couldn't find
[29:43] one will lean to be
[29:50] the supreme
[29:53] sacrifice.
[29:55] that was needed
[30:00] that would buy
[30:03] eternal life for you and me.
[30:10] And had it not been for a place called
[30:16] Mount Calvary.
[30:20] And had it not been for the old rugged
[30:26] cross.
[30:30] And had it not been for a man
[30:35] called Jesus.
[30:40] Then forever
[30:42] my soul would be lost.
[30:49] And I'm so glad
[30:52] he was willing to drink his bit cup.
[30:59] Although he prayed,
[31:02] "Father, let it pass from me."
[31:09] And I'm so glad
[31:12] he never called
[31:15] heaven's angels
[31:19] from these hands. Pull the nails
[31:24] that torment me.
[31:28] Oh, had it not been for a place called
[31:35] Calary.
[31:39] And had it not been for the old rugged
[31:45] cross,
[31:49] and had it not been for a man
[31:55] called Jesus,
[31:59] then forever
[32:02] my soul would be lost.
[32:09] had it not been for a place called
[32:15] Calary.
[32:19] And had it not been for the old rugged
[32:25] cross,
[32:28] had it not been for a man
[32:34] called Jesus,
[32:38] then forever
[32:42] my soul
[32:44] be.
[32:46] One more time. Oh, had it not been for a
[32:52] place called Mount Calary,
[32:58] and had it not been for the old rugged
[33:04] cross.
[33:08] Oh, had it not been for a man
[33:14] called Jesus.
[33:18] Then forever
[33:21] my soul
[33:24] be
[33:29] pastor comes this morning. Why don't we
[33:31] stand? We'll sing that a time or two
[33:32] more. Andrew, if you don't mind helping
[33:34] us. Had it not been
[33:38] for a place called Mount Calvary,
[33:45] had it not been for the old rugged
[33:51] cross.
[33:55] Had it not been for a man,
[34:00] oh Jesus,
[34:05] then forever
[34:08] my soul would be lost.
[34:14] Had it not been
[34:17] for a place called Mount Calvary,
[34:24] had it not been for the old rugged
[34:30] cross.
[34:34] had it not been for a man
[34:39] called Jesus.
[34:44] Then forever
[34:47] my soul would be lost as our pastor
[34:51] comes lifted up once more. Had it not
[34:55] been
[35:06] for the old
[35:09] cross
[35:13] and it not be
[35:19] Jesus
[35:23] and forever
[35:25] my soul.
[35:32] Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And a happy Easter morning to you.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; What a resurrection that was. And what a
[35:42] resurrection this is.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; I think much about the words of brother
[35:49] John was sang in the last service and
[35:52] how blessed I was.
[35:54] I'd like to remind you, he said, if we
[35:57] don't have a resurrection now,
[36:00] &gt;&gt; we have to have a resurrection now,
[36:03] &gt;&gt; we must experience a resurrection now in
[36:06] order to have a resurrection then.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that that is true.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[36:15] I'd like to turn in the Bible.
[36:19] And while you're turning to Matthew the
[36:22] 26th chapter,
[36:27] we're going to start reading at the 26th
[36:30] verse.
[36:34] But I want to bring uh greetings also.
[36:37] Happy Easter greetings. But more than
[36:39] that, Christian greetings from
[36:42] Switzerland
[36:43] and Brother Tom and Sister Joanne are
[36:46] are there. Brother Ron Spencer and
[36:49] brother Jason Watkins have been
[36:51] ministering.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're so thankful our brother
[36:56] Frasipar
[36:58] was able to address the group the first
[37:02] morning and uh I was able to stream
[37:07] uh one of the services last night and uh
[37:11] my wife was able to stream a couple of
[37:14] the meetings. I'm so thankful that they
[37:17] made it possible.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been a wonderful blessing.
[37:23] Uh so we want to bring greetings from
[37:28] brother Tom and sister Joanne who to the
[37:30] local congregation. They'll be returning
[37:33] this week. Also brother Tim Dodd
[37:38] uh will be returning from Uganda and and
[37:43] Ethiopia.
[37:45] And I think I saw
[37:48] brother Jonathan Frey. He's already
[37:50] back.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And Michael Diaz.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. We thank uh God. And not only that,
[38:02] for the experience that they're able to
[38:04] have.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; I think that it's uh
[38:09] it's a life-changing experience. Riley,
[38:13] &gt;&gt; a person lets that soak in. Amen. and
[38:17] all of you that are here and visiting
[38:19] and spend this week this long weekend.
[38:23] Some have gone and others have come and
[38:26] we think it must be about the same. So
[38:28] we are happy to have you all here in the
[38:32] church full and
[38:35] we just uh wanted to
[38:39] be fully prepared and ready this
[38:43] morning. Uh, and when we arrive here,
[38:47] there were some of our some of my things
[38:50] that I left at home. So, you know what I
[38:53] said? God's will be done and probably
[38:56] they need to stay home, but I I had
[38:59] quite a few things I wanted you to read
[39:01] on the screen and uh I left the disc at
[39:04] home. So, anyway, we just say praise
[39:08] God. What do you say at a time like
[39:10] that? It's the only time I've said that.
[39:12] I've always gone back or sent somebody
[39:14] back and uh but we didn't. This next
[39:18] week is going to be a full week this
[39:20] coming week. Uh we have a brother
[39:24] brother Jason Demars
[39:27] um and he worked alongside of brother
[39:31] Tim Dodd and the group here and what
[39:35] else to to complete the church age book
[39:39] in the Arabic
[39:41] language. It's the first time there has
[39:44] been anything. When you look around this
[39:46] congregation, you think, well, you know,
[39:49] everybody's been working and and doing
[39:52] their thing and whatever more. But you
[39:55] don't realize that
[39:57] in the background,
[40:00] the Holy Spirit is moving and causing
[40:03] people to say something and causing
[40:06] people to do something. And you then you
[40:09] find out years later that it was God.
[40:13] Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; It was God doing it.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; God was in that meeting. Isn't that
[40:18] wonderful?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I really am thankful for that.
[40:23] And then a brother Freddy, I believe it
[40:27] they he goes by that name,
[40:30] Kenji.
[40:33] He's uh he will be arriving also this
[40:36] week from Uganda or that's where he
[40:40] originates from. He is brother
[40:42] Brandham's voice on the radio broadcast
[40:46] and uh we have been sponsoring
[40:49] uh radio broadcast
[40:51] uh the church here for about 3 years
[40:57] and uh what is remarkable and really a
[41:02] sovereign move of the Holy Spirit
[41:05] brother Tim Dodd he expressed it here he
[41:09] said he's had a real paradigm shift
[41:12] as to who God is dealing with. And when
[41:17] you have entire groups of people perhaps
[41:20] as large as here, I think there's
[41:23] somewhere between 15, 20, 30,000 people
[41:28] have been baptized in the last two
[41:30] years. Entire groups of people have been
[41:34] baptized until the church authorities
[41:38] thrust them out. When they thrust them
[41:40] out, they had nobody left.
[41:45] And we had to buy cloth,
[41:50] just canopies, so the people could be
[41:53] spared from the sun and the rain. But
[41:57] that is remarkable, is it not? And you
[42:00] don't expect that to happen. Maybe you
[42:02] expect to see 30, 40 people and we've
[42:05] had to say, you know, a thousand and no
[42:08] more because we know it'll end up with a
[42:11] couple thousand people. And so that's
[42:14] what brother Tim Dodd has been faced
[42:16] with. It's a well, we could say nice
[42:18] problem. Uh yeah. Yeah. It's a nice
[42:22] problem. All right. But nevertheless,
[42:25] you have to have something. The people
[42:26] come to hear something. So, brother Tim
[42:30] Dodd told me that he was he was
[42:34] releasing everything that he had and he
[42:37] found the people pulling and pulling and
[42:39] pulling. He thought this is like at home
[42:43] or even better and the people are
[42:46] pulling and pulling on the word. So, he
[42:48] began to inquire
[42:51] where,
[42:53] you know, how did they get where they
[42:55] are? They said, "Well, we we've been
[42:57] listening to a radio broadcast,
[43:00] and that's just Brother Freddy that's
[43:02] going to be here this week, and you
[43:04] people have uh and people that are
[43:08] sitting here in this congregation have
[43:12] had a burden to see that the people who
[43:16] can't read,
[43:18] &gt;&gt; can hear
[43:20] &gt;&gt; and they hear the broadcast. And a lot
[43:23] of those people are the people that have
[43:25] come out and uh now they have really no
[43:29] place to worship except we've been
[43:31] trying to get them
[43:33] shelters shall we say. Amen.
[43:38] So it's going to be a good week.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Resurrection.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; A good week because of the resurrection.
[43:48] And we're going to read out of Matthew's
[43:50] Gospel, the 26th chapter. And uh
[43:55] starting at verse 26,
[44:00] I believe that we have all the
[44:02] announcements.
[44:04] And as they were eating,
[44:07] Jesus took bread and blessed it and
[44:11] broke it and gave it to the disciples
[44:15] and said, "Take, eat.
[44:19] This is my body. I have a number of
[44:22] things to say. Uh, I'd like to start off
[44:26] by saying, you notice and I'm I'm going
[44:29] to draw certain words for you to think
[44:33] about and put together.
[44:36] He did not say take east, take taste.
[44:43] And you know, starting in 1962
[44:47] and then 10 times to the end of brother
[44:50] Brandham's life till God called him
[44:52] home, he said it wasn't to the people's
[44:55] taste.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad?
[45:01] Aren't you thankful
[45:03] &gt;&gt; that God who gave you the ability to
[45:05] taste physically has given you also an
[45:10] ability to taste physically and
[45:13] spiritually. But not only taste
[45:15] spiritually, but take it, consume it,
[45:19] &gt;&gt; ponder it, think about it, and receive
[45:23] it.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as we continue to
[45:28] read. And as he took the cup and gave
[45:32] thanks
[45:34] and gave it to them, saying,
[45:39] "Drink
[45:40] ye all of it."
[45:45] is that uh
[45:48] and he took bread and blessed it and
[45:51] break it and gave it to the disciples
[45:55] and said take eat this is my body
[46:01] verse 27 and he took the cup and gave
[46:06] thanks and gave it to them
[46:10] saying drink ye all of it Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; For this is the this is my blood of the
[46:19] new testament
[46:21] which is shed for many for the remission
[46:25] of sins.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; That's verse 28. And you may be seated.
[46:36] Jesus went on to say that he would not
[46:39] drink it till he drank of the fruit of
[46:42] the vine till he would drink it new
[46:44] again in the kingdom.
[46:47] And I'll just read that for you. It's
[46:49] verse 28.
[46:51] For this is my blood at the of the New
[46:55] Testament
[46:57] which is shed for many for the remission
[46:59] of sins. But I say unto you, I will not
[47:03] drink henceforth
[47:05] of this fruit of the vine until that day
[47:10] when I drink it new with you in my
[47:15] father's kingdom.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; There was uh
[47:25] uh a woman by the name of Saleom.
[47:30] She was the wife of Zebedee.
[47:34] Zebedee's children
[47:37] were James and John.
[47:40] They seem to be favored in the Bible in
[47:44] that Peter, James, and John were three
[47:48] that Jesus took in the Garden of
[47:51] Gethsemane.
[47:53] He took them onto the mount of
[47:55] transfiguration.
[47:57] uh they were special in in in ways that
[48:02] we don't know. Uh John knew Caiaphas. He
[48:08] he was acquainted with Caiaphas and he
[48:11] got Peter in to the judgment hall when
[48:16] Jesus was being judged. That's how Peter
[48:19] got in there and being warmed by the
[48:22] fire. Uh there was uh
[48:27] there was people
[48:29] that were like Josephus
[48:33] who had a who had the tomb carved out
[48:38] for himself
[48:40] and he was he was a man of
[48:44] uh notable person. He's only mentioned
[48:47] in the Bible a time or two, but he he
[48:52] was there at the right time,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; had the right thing to offer,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; and he was the one that craved the body
[49:00] of Jesus that would go to the tomb. We
[49:05] we don't say a lot about Josephus,
[49:08] but he was there at the right moment.
[49:11] And you know there's people and even if
[49:15] this congregation as a body of people if
[49:19] we're here at the right time
[49:22] &gt;&gt; and offering the right thing
[49:24] &gt;&gt; and able to provide it for the body of
[49:27] Christ
[49:28] &gt;&gt; for future generations if there are
[49:32] whoever or whatever we might play in the
[49:35] plan of God. I I just pray that we'll be
[49:39] faithful to that and that we will see
[49:41] that and be happy that we can do that
[49:44] and just say I was able to speak to
[49:47] those people. I was able to give a tomb
[49:50] to the body of Jesus Christ. I I I had
[49:54] uh I was not noted I was notable. I was
[49:59] uh uh uh well known in the area. Uh who
[50:04] made him that? He had to be that to go
[50:08] to go to Pilate and crave the body of
[50:11] the Lord. And he was the one that was
[50:13] able to receive it and take it. There
[50:16] were a lot of other people maybe say
[50:19] more faithful or more
[50:22] uh I can't say more respectable, but
[50:26] they were they they didn't they weren't
[50:28] in a position where they could have the
[50:31] same persuasion. and and who put them
[50:35] there? God. God made the way for them to
[50:37] be there. And uh whatever whatever we
[50:41] are, we are by the grace of God.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; So it says that uh the Bible tells us
[50:53] that uh the mother of James and John
[50:58] came to Jesus and worshiped him.
[51:02] And uh
[51:04] then the Bible says
[51:07] she worshiped him and he said, "What
[51:09] would you like? What can I do for you?"
[51:13] She said, "Grant that this my two sons."
[51:18] That would be James and John.
[51:20] They were they were considered, if you
[51:23] read about it, they were considered
[51:25] relatively
[51:27] uh not hurting. They were I can't say
[51:30] they were well off, but they were people
[51:34] that had connections that others didn't
[51:36] have. Uh they they were respected
[51:42] people. And Jesus said, "What would you
[51:46] like?" He said, she said, "Granted these
[51:49] my two sons, one would sit on the right
[51:52] hand and one will sit on the left hand
[51:55] in your kingdom."
[51:57] And Jesus said to her, he said, "You
[52:00] know not what you ask. It will be given
[52:04] to those for whom it is prepared."
[52:08] And he didn't even know the he said it's
[52:10] it's the father. In other words, there
[52:13] were jurisdictions here on earth.
[52:17] It was Jesus had to come in the flesh.
[52:21] The man called Jesus, as Andrew sang a
[52:25] few moments ago. I'm so thankful he was
[52:28] able to drink the bitter cup.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't the only one to drink a
[52:35] bitter cup because earlier in the
[52:39] scripture, and I had all of these
[52:40] scriptures together. I had them on a
[52:43] screen for you actually, but he
[52:48] he had a a a
[52:51] desire.
[52:53] She had a desire. They had a desire that
[52:57] they would be able to sit on the right
[53:00] hand or on the left hand of the Lord
[53:02] Jesus. And Jesus said it's prepared for
[53:06] someone only. It's the father.
[53:10] He He's the only one that can set them
[53:12] in their place. That's not another God.
[53:15] It's another jurisdiction.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Same God.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; That God was in Christ.
[53:23] And that Christ went to Calvary, but in
[53:26] that form he drank the bitter cup. And
[53:30] she and Jesus asked, "Are you able to
[53:33] drink of the cup
[53:36] that I drank? And are you able to
[53:40] be baptized with the baptism that I'm
[53:43] baptized with?" And they said these
[53:45] words, didn't even know what they were
[53:47] saying really. "We are able."
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, they didn't have to drink
[53:53] all of the bitter cup that Jesus drank.
[53:56] But in the cup, say for the Apostle Paul
[53:59] was a prison.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And because of his prison charges,
[54:06] we have our Bible.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Much of the Bible was written in prison.
[54:12] There are people today in China that are
[54:15] able to read the Bible
[54:18] and they we can't even tell you as a
[54:21] congregation, but I was just speaking
[54:24] with brother Murphy.
[54:26] It's all right. I say this much. And uh
[54:32] the Bibles have been taken off, swept
[54:34] off the bookstores,
[54:38] but
[54:40] and as a result, a great vacuum has been
[54:43] called has been created and we have
[54:47] received calls and said by even
[54:51] organizations,
[54:54] denominational organizations, they want
[54:57] our Bible. the Bible that this man
[55:00] sitting here in the platform translated
[55:02] up in that office there for five years
[55:06] right from Genesis 1:1 to the last amen
[55:11] of Revelation.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; It's the best and the finest King James
[55:16] version of the Chinese Bible that has
[55:20] that has ever been produced. Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I say that I say that with confidence
[55:27] and one organization
[55:30] asked for 500 of them and they have
[55:33] them. It's it's all done. While you sit
[55:37] here, come to church. They what we do.
[55:40] We just come here and sit to sit here in
[55:43] the service and people study and they
[55:45] come up to preach. But that's not all
[55:48] that's done. And because of that,
[55:51] somebody's reading the Bible.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody's reading the same Bible the
[55:55] prophet looked from.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Praise be to God.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; If we came on the scene just to do that,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; that's great enough.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful enough." I say, "Thank
[56:08] you, Father, that you allowed us to have
[56:11] that opportunity, that privilege, that
[56:14] we were just part of that."
[56:17] Even if it's somebody that just sees
[56:19] where you're sitting and and they are
[56:23] encouraged by it and they're quickened
[56:25] by it, say, "There they are. Praise
[56:29] God."
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And they're worshiping God. That's the
[56:33] God I believe in.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And so somebody is able to read that.
[56:38] That's not something that we take
[56:40] casually.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; But if that's what God allowed for us,
[56:45] whatever it was. Yes.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; But in the cup, are you able to drink
[56:50] it? And I have I'm calling this message
[56:54] today, drink ye all of it.
[57:02] And the messenger that we speak of,
[57:06] the prophet of God that came to fulfill
[57:10] a certain part.
[57:14] Don't
[57:16] uh don't interpret it or translate it
[57:19] into what you understand it to be. But I
[57:23] I want to put some of scriptures
[57:26] together with things that are happening
[57:29] and things that have happened and have
[57:32] happened in if not in your lifetime have
[57:35] happened in my lifetime. And that is
[57:37] quite meaningless really as far as
[57:40] things happening. It's going to happen
[57:42] whether we're here or not.
[57:44] what God has to have happen will happen.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we respond to
[57:53] whatever
[57:55] uh comes our way, whether it be a
[58:00] something taking place to the uh
[58:03] brethren and uh churches and in the
[58:05] Philippines or whether it's in Africa or
[58:09] wherever door is opened. If it's in
[58:11] South America or wherever, a door is
[58:13] opened and we say we go there. Wouldn't
[58:17] that be a good thing to do? Wouldn't you
[58:19] all be in agreement with that?
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; I think it's part of the cup.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That God has given us to drink.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus gave the bread, he
[58:33] said, "Divide it among yourselves."
[58:37] And so they did that.
[58:40] when Jesus expressed
[58:42] this last supper and I would like to
[58:44] read that verse I believe it's in uh
[58:51] in Luke's gospel
[58:54] just allow me to
[58:58] Jesus the different apostles were
[59:01] writing the event of the last supper
[59:05] which we call the last supper but Jesus
[59:08] said something very special about it and
[59:11] I would like to I believe it's in Luke's
[59:14] gospel.
[59:15] Um,
[59:19] you have to forgive me
[59:30] in Luke's gospel he was write writing I
[59:33] believe it is in Luke's gospel and he
[59:36] said uh he said with desire
[59:41] and you can look this way while I you
[59:44] don't have to be looking for it. But he
[59:46] said, "With desire
[59:49] &gt;&gt; have I desired
[59:51] &gt;&gt; to have this Passover
[59:54] &gt;&gt; with you."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; It was his last supper. And people have
[1:00:00] painted it and it has become a very
[1:00:04] great and
[1:00:06] lovely story etc. and distorted also.
[1:00:10] It's not exactly correct. We're not here
[1:00:13] to tinker with that.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; We're here to hear his words with
[1:00:19] desire.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; I've desired to have this last Passover
[1:00:25] with you.
[1:00:27] And I may startle you by saying,
[1:00:30] you have been called
[1:00:33] by this same Lord Jesus who manifested
[1:00:36] himself. And I'm going to go through it
[1:00:39] with you. In this age, with desire have
[1:00:45] I desired to have this last supper with
[1:00:48] you. And you have a life to live.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And I refer back to brother John Andy's
[1:00:56] message.
[1:00:58] You have a resurrection to have if you
[1:01:01] receive. Not taste,
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; not just taste,
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; not just mouth, not just confess, not
[1:01:11] just associate with a group of people
[1:01:13] that believe the message of the hour,
[1:01:18] but if you actually are part of and eat
[1:01:23] that portion of the scripture that is
[1:01:27] written for this day, you'll suffer some
[1:01:30] of the drags.
[1:01:33] You might as well expect it. You'll
[1:01:35] suffer some of the drags. People say,
[1:01:37] "Oh,
[1:01:38] you believe that?"
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; I certainly do.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; I don't only believe it. I It has
[1:01:47] resurrected. It's been a resurrection in
[1:01:50] my life.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; This thing is alive.
[1:01:56] When when when the apostle Peter said
[1:01:59] Jesus said do you want to leave also?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; These folks have left.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Do you want to leave also? He said to
[1:02:07] whom? To where will we go?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; You have the words of eternal life.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's what counted. That's what it was
[1:02:18] to Peter. He said it it's it's alive.
[1:02:22] It's a written word that's alive.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's had a resurrection.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; It's beyond corruption. It's beyond
[1:02:30] darkness. It's beyond all of these
[1:02:32] things of the world.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I've experienced it.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; It's been a resurrection.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Others may go. Others may do all kinds
[1:02:41] of things.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Jose Josephus plays his part
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and we don't see him anymore. That's
[1:02:48] fine. But he had his part. I have my
[1:02:52] part.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I wanted to do all kinds of things.
[1:02:56] Peter wanted to build three temples and
[1:02:59] Jesus rebuked him and a voice from
[1:03:01] heaven spoke out and said, "This is my
[1:03:05] son."
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; There was still part of the cup when
[1:03:16] Jesus was giving it to the disciples
[1:03:18] that he had to drink.
[1:03:20] He was going to empty out paradise.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; He was going to preach to souls that
[1:03:28] were in prison.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; He was going to let them know that Noah
[1:03:33] stood for me.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I stand for him.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And he's not here. He's He won't stay
[1:03:39] here.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And the apostles and the
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; and the very uh prophets that they had
[1:03:50] killed.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had said to them, "You're your
[1:03:54] father, the devil."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And his works you do.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. And here we have
[1:04:02] an opportunity to be identified with
[1:04:05] this kind of a message. I say it's the
[1:04:07] most glorious thing. It's a wonderful
[1:04:10] thing you have a if you've been invited
[1:04:12] to it as great privilege
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; I can tell you there is no other message
[1:04:18] like it.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] And in in the life of Jesus.
[1:04:30] Now I'm I'm I'm speaking of things that
[1:04:32] I know and I trust you know your Bible.
[1:04:38] when Jesus was speaking to the people
[1:04:42] and uh they were
[1:04:45] not his friends some of them and he said
[1:04:49] he said the mana that
[1:04:52] Moses gave in the wilderness.
[1:04:55] So now here he is going back to the mana
[1:04:59] he said that Moses gave you in the
[1:05:02] wilderness and I have the scriptures
[1:05:05] here where the people cried for that
[1:05:07] mana
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says when the
[1:05:10] people cry
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; for something God gives it to them.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And then after a while they said all we
[1:05:19] have is this
[1:05:21] old mana.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All we have is this old
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; church. Same thing, same thing all the
[1:05:29] time.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And we want some flesh to eat.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And until they had flesh until the flesh
[1:05:36] was coming out of their ears, I think.
[1:05:39] And uh so it wasn't always a a pleasant
[1:05:43] thing. You know, in other words, there's
[1:05:46] good things that come out of the cup and
[1:05:49] there's difficult things. And some of
[1:05:52] you perhaps have had to part partake and
[1:05:56] participate
[1:05:58] of a difficult there was uh there was
[1:06:01] rejection still in the cup of Jesus.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; There was judgment.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Men who he had given life to were his
[1:06:11] judge. Can you imagine that?
[1:06:15] Oh, I'm so glad for a man called Jesus.
[1:06:18] Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for the prophet of Galilee.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for a prophet message of
[1:06:27] this hour.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I
[1:06:34] had a grandson that was in the
[1:06:36] tabernacle not long ago and he was asked
[1:06:40] to sing. He was trying to hide. He
[1:06:43] didn't want anybody to know that brother
[1:06:46] Biscll's grandson was in the meeting at
[1:06:48] Brother Brandham's tabernacle. So, he
[1:06:51] was just kind of cowering in there. He's
[1:06:54] a big fellow. His mom and dad are back
[1:06:56] there. Can Linda
[1:06:59] and uh Wes told me that he was just
[1:07:03] trying to hide and be unobvious.
[1:07:08] And they said, "We understand that." Uh
[1:07:10] the song leader said, "We understand
[1:07:12] amazing how these song leaders get
[1:07:14] word." Uh I I saw I saw Brother Derek in
[1:07:19] action today.
[1:07:21] Brother Mike, he was walking down the
[1:07:24] aisle with his uh big guitar case and uh
[1:07:30] we just stepped out of the office door
[1:07:33] and I said, "Oh, how are you, Brother
[1:07:35] Mike?" Uh, so you got your Well, oh
[1:07:39] yeah. And he's waving his guitar case
[1:07:42] and uh, Brother Derek steps out and he
[1:07:44] says, "Uh, is is there a special today?"
[1:07:47] And Brother Derek said, "Yep." He said,
[1:07:50] "Well, who's singing you are?"
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] I'm so glad
[1:08:01] for the then brother Andrew got up and
[1:08:04] next time I looked at the brother Andrew
[1:08:07] was singing for a man called Jesus.
[1:08:11] And I'm so glad that he was willing to
[1:08:14] drink the bitter cup.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And here I had it written down.
[1:08:21] In that cup
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; wasn't only the dregs of rejection and
[1:08:26] judgment and there was all the glorious
[1:08:29] things as well. You have good things
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; in the cup. You'll have a future. Uh we
[1:08:37] don't know what the future holds, but it
[1:08:40] might hold some bitter things.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Don't give up
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; any more than you would have wanted
[1:08:49] Jesus to give up. say, "Ah, well, I'm
[1:08:52] not prepared to go this far. I I'm not
[1:08:57] prepared to be judged with these
[1:08:59] criminals and be crucified."
[1:09:03] But he was willing to do that for you.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; For me,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; and I'm so glad he was willing to drink
[1:09:11] the bitter cup.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Just hold that, please.
[1:09:26] Now, here's a number of
[1:09:32] So, he was going to empty out paradise
[1:09:37] and in uh
[1:09:39] world is falling apart in 1963.
[1:09:44] Brother Brandham said they was looking
[1:09:46] for something to hold them together
[1:09:50] in all ages.
[1:09:52] God will send it to them and then they
[1:09:55] turn it down.
[1:09:57] So there's a part of it that's very
[1:10:00] acceptable,
[1:10:02] very much to their liking,
[1:10:07] but you'll find out later on that they
[1:10:09] didn't like the taste.
[1:10:12] So then and you might you might also
[1:10:15] remember neither did Jesus like the
[1:10:19] taste
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; of the Leodysian
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; age.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; He spewed it out of his mouth.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; I hope you just take those and put them
[1:10:32] together.
[1:10:34] And in the world falling apart, he's
[1:10:37] saying, "Oh, they always like something
[1:10:39] to bind them together, to hold them
[1:10:41] together."
[1:10:45] He says, "God will send it to them,
[1:10:49] then they turn it down. They wanted
[1:10:51] mana. God sent it to them, then they
[1:10:55] turned it down.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You just read it all in the scripture."
[1:11:00] I'm telling you the scripture.
[1:11:02] and they turned it down and then it
[1:11:05] wasn't good for them. Then they rejected
[1:11:08] it.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; The Jews rejected the Messiah
[1:11:14] because he didn't fit their taste.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Why it had to be shepherds in 1964
[1:11:23] says they won't accept him the word
[1:11:26] because in their denomination it doesn't
[1:11:30] fit their taste.
[1:11:33] What denomination
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; has a taste
[1:11:38] that will fit this taste
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; for this message? That's right, brother.
[1:11:46] Because a denomination, it doesn't fit
[1:11:49] their taste.
[1:11:51] I have been I've preached
[1:11:55] for over 60 years now
[1:12:00] and there are countries
[1:12:04] I preached in India
[1:12:06] and I had an archbishop
[1:12:09] who offered their church
[1:12:12] because we couldn't get a building and
[1:12:14] this other brethren arranged a building.
[1:12:16] I have no no way of knowing that.
[1:12:20] And they they offered a building and he
[1:12:24] was sitting in honored chair
[1:12:28] taking in the service.
[1:12:30] And right after the service, he ran and
[1:12:35] he wanted me to come with him into his
[1:12:37] office. And I went and I I in his office
[1:12:41] and sat down. And he said,
[1:12:45] "When you were reading this scripture,"
[1:12:49] he said, "It seems that you had a
[1:12:52] reference to that in Revelation
[1:12:57] that it was having something to do with
[1:12:59] the rapture." I said, "That's exactly
[1:13:02] correct."
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's very interesting.
[1:13:08] That's very interesting."
[1:13:10] But he just had a nibble.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; He just had a little taste.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And his organization would never never
[1:13:20] accept that.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; But that was exactly he was beginning to
[1:13:25] see a little glimmer of light
[1:13:28] and he wanted it. He wanted to discuss
[1:13:30] more about it. And he was seeing exactly
[1:13:35] what it was. He was actually seeing
[1:13:37] truth, a flash of light.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; He was seeing truth
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; and he would like to perhaps have talked
[1:13:45] more about it. He actually asked for a
[1:13:48] whole set of brother Brandham's message
[1:13:50] books and I believe we sent that to him
[1:13:55] in the message why it had to be
[1:13:57] shepherds. And would you notice this
[1:13:58] please? why it had to be shepherds
[1:14:03] in a place in Tucson itself. He says
[1:14:07] they won't accept him the word because
[1:14:11] their denomination it doesn't fit their
[1:14:14] taste. The hireling shepherds of the day
[1:14:18] and then who do you say this is? I have
[1:14:21] the book here.
[1:14:24] Who who do you say this is? Who would
[1:14:26] you have said Jesus was?
[1:14:32] The crowd was crying, "His blood be upon
[1:14:36] us and upon our children." Did they?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Is that history?
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; His blood be upon us.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Where we We need to ask ourselves in all
[1:14:47] sincerity. We're here today celebrating
[1:14:51] his resurrection.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, what about his
[1:14:56] rejection?
[1:14:58] Are you willing to take that part of his
[1:15:02] cup?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[1:15:12] Oh, time was unfolding and prophecy was
[1:15:15] being fulfilled.
[1:15:18] their churches had got them
[1:15:23] so far.
[1:15:26] I'm speaking truth today, friends.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; The churches, do you think this is the
[1:15:32] only church that's got a congregation in
[1:15:34] it?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; All the churches, right? Some of them
[1:15:40] had early morning service or masses or
[1:15:44] whatever kind of service had sunrise
[1:15:48] meetings
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; where different places
[1:15:52] what are they I say why are you here
[1:15:55] because the resurrection this is this is
[1:15:58] Sunday morning this is Easter where's
[1:16:00] Easter in the Bible well uh yeah it is
[1:16:03] there and and there's a resurrection
[1:16:06] what about what about the suffering
[1:16:08] what about what about believing him when
[1:16:12] others were leaving him?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; What about when people were rejecting
[1:16:17] him? What about when people were selling
[1:16:20] him?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Do you think that I have a right to say
[1:16:27] that? Absolutely.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Absolutely have a right to say that.
[1:16:32] What What about it when it wasn't
[1:16:33] popular?
[1:16:35] What about it when it wasn't the right
[1:16:38] thing to say? It wasn't politically
[1:16:40] correct to say.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I thought about the breaking news.
[1:16:48] The breaking news of your day, your
[1:16:52] country,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; right here in the city of Vancouver,
[1:16:58] right in Canada or or America?
[1:17:04] What about what about Bellingham?
[1:17:08] And many of you
[1:17:11] go down there and perhaps shop. I'm glad
[1:17:14] you can shop there. But that's not all
[1:17:18] that's in the cup.
[1:17:23] What about it being a sanctuary city? A
[1:17:25] sanctuary for what?
[1:17:29] And they had a big celebration on Easter
[1:17:31] morning. They had a big celebration
[1:17:35] down here in Vancouver.
[1:17:38] Tens of thousands of people came
[1:17:42] for a smoke in.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hello. This is our country.
[1:17:50] a smoke in
[1:17:53] celebrating
[1:17:54] the loosening of the
[1:18:00] could smoke marijuana
[1:18:02] if you want. Well, smoke whatever they
[1:18:05] want,
[1:18:07] but what if that's not part of my life?
[1:18:11] That's not part of my worship. That's
[1:18:14] not part of it. Oh, you're one of those.
[1:18:16] Yeah, that's exactly right.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; We're one of those.
[1:18:21] I'm prepared to drink that part of the
[1:18:24] cup
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; and not only
[1:18:28] take it with our hands
[1:18:31] and embrace it.
[1:18:35] And we we may hear message, you may hear
[1:18:39] something of the message and say, "Well,
[1:18:41] that um
[1:18:43] it doesn't just suit me." It it it's not
[1:18:46] made just to your individual taste.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to taste it.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; We're here to take it
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; with all of its disgrace.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Call it whatever you want to call it,
[1:19:03] but we're here to embrace it. We're here
[1:19:06] to ponder it. Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says of Martha or Mary,
[1:19:13] uh, the mother of Jesus,
[1:19:17] say, "Oh, it'd be so wonderful to be
[1:19:19] that virgin." Well, it wasn't so
[1:19:21] wonderful.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; There were a lot of things that wasn't
[1:19:26] so wonderful.
[1:19:30] And the angel said to her, "You'll have
[1:19:33] a son."
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "How can this be? I don't even
[1:19:37] know a man.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will overshadow you
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; and you'll conceive.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; And the second person for you that are
[1:19:46] trinitarians, the second person of the
[1:19:49] Trinity or the third person of the
[1:19:52] Trinity conceived the second person of
[1:19:54] the Trinity. Oh, such nonsense.
[1:19:58] It was God.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; It was God.
[1:20:05] God changing his mask,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; changing his form,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and coming and saying, "I'm going to
[1:20:14] save every one of my children.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Going to save everyone."
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[1:20:26] He was manifesting the word.
[1:20:30] He was the anointed word himself.
[1:20:34] And when they seen that
[1:20:37] that taking place,
[1:20:40] they turned it down.
[1:20:42] They were happy to taste it up to that
[1:20:45] time. But when they seen the
[1:20:47] manifestation
[1:20:49] of God, that God was saying, "This is
[1:20:53] me.
[1:20:55] This is me." In the scripture, they
[1:20:58] didn't want it.
[1:21:01] It wasn't to their taste.
[1:21:04] And that's the pitiful part.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. You're right.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Just as in other days.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And who do you say this is? Balam walked
[1:21:18] right out across these things. He was a
[1:21:22] perfect denominational
[1:21:25] a denomination and perfect answer to
[1:21:28] their taste.
[1:21:31] says, "Do you want to do you want to
[1:21:32] leave?" He said, "No, I don't want to
[1:21:34] leave."
[1:21:40] And in a thinking man's filter,
[1:21:45] he says, "For it gives them the desire
[1:21:48] of their heart, organization."
[1:21:52] They have a taste for organization.
[1:21:57] I want to say to this congregation,
[1:21:59] those that may be streaming,
[1:22:05] I have a concern.
[1:22:09] I guess I'm I'm eligible to have a
[1:22:12] concern.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You know, we can have
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; the orchestra, we can have the singers,
[1:22:20] we can have the preachers, we can have
[1:22:23] good ministry. say, "Well, I like that
[1:22:25] preacher," or, "I like that preacher,"
[1:22:27] or or whatever, or I don't like that
[1:22:29] preacher.
[1:22:32] You're an individual. You're eligible to
[1:22:34] do that, to say that.
[1:22:38] But
[1:22:42] God is also eligible
[1:22:45] to say what his concern is. And once
[1:22:48] churches become established,
[1:22:51] something that seems to be very
[1:22:54] acceptable,
[1:22:56] if we just get everything organized,
[1:23:02] well, we need children to be educated
[1:23:04] and so we have a school and some can go
[1:23:09] and some can't go and so we organize it.
[1:23:13] Then there's distance learning. Well,
[1:23:15] distance learning has been made possible
[1:23:19] and I'm probably one of the greatest
[1:23:21] promoters of distant learning. There's
[1:23:24] believers all over the nation, all over
[1:23:27] the earth. Yes, there's and we've dealt
[1:23:31] with it also. There's uh 15 hours
[1:23:35] difference here, 16 hours difference
[1:23:37] there. There's nine hours difference
[1:23:39] here in this part of the country. But we
[1:23:42] can archive it and they can they can be
[1:23:45] studying it at any time in their home.
[1:23:48] And so it's a wonderful thing to have.
[1:23:51] To me it would be a wonderful thing.
[1:23:55] And now I'm laying it at home.
[1:24:00] But a person wants to be very careful
[1:24:03] that they don't just get everything
[1:24:05] organizationally
[1:24:07] arranged and
[1:24:10] everything in its place. And
[1:24:13] brother Brandham actually says
[1:24:16] that it it's it's
[1:24:19] um
[1:24:21] it's there's something about it that it
[1:24:23] tastes nice. you get it all looked
[1:24:26] after.
[1:24:30] But you know,
[1:24:32] with the early believers,
[1:24:36] and I can talk about some of the early
[1:24:39] believers,
[1:24:41] uh, everything wasn't just really
[1:24:45] nice. I want to come to just when Jesus
[1:24:48] was drinking the cup
[1:24:51] in the next few hours.
[1:24:56] The secretary of the h of the church was
[1:24:59] going to hang himself.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He was going to betray the the Lord
[1:25:05] Jesus.
[1:25:07] He was going to take 30 pieces of
[1:25:09] silver.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That was all in the cup.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; He knew it even before he drank the cup.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; He knew all of that was going to happen.
[1:25:22] And then the leader
[1:25:25] of you say, "Well, the leader of the
[1:25:27] church, the leader of that church, the
[1:25:30] leader of Bible way, he's hanging on the
[1:25:33] he he's been condemned with in the
[1:25:35] courts
[1:25:36] and he came before the chief priests.
[1:25:40] He's got the whole religious order is
[1:25:42] against him. and the
[1:25:45] now we've put pressure on the Roman
[1:25:48] organization and and they they're going
[1:25:51] to crucify him. And they said, "Well,
[1:25:54] uh, you have to do it."
[1:25:57] They said, "Well, no, we we don't have
[1:25:59] anything to do with that. That's
[1:26:01] religious." He said, he said, "He's a
[1:26:04] king. If he's a king,
[1:26:08] we have one king. It's Caesar." That's
[1:26:11] right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And they cowered under that and said,
[1:26:14] "Okay,
[1:26:16] do what you have to do."
[1:26:18] So they took him out, said, "Let his
[1:26:21] blood be on us." Notice, "Let his blood
[1:26:24] be on us." Am I preaching exactly what
[1:26:27] the scripture says?
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, am I preaching what
[1:26:30] the scripture says?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; His blood be on us and on our children.
[1:26:38] And they they took him then that was all
[1:26:41] in his cup
[1:26:43] and begin he who preached he who had
[1:26:47] thousands.
[1:26:49] You know that your prophet had thousands
[1:26:54] had thousands tens of thousands.
[1:26:57] Hundreds of thousands.
[1:26:59] Manifestation after manifestation
[1:27:02] standing there telling the people what
[1:27:04] the secrets of their hearts was. and
[1:27:06] they wanted it and they loved it.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That was to their taste.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; But when the people began to leave and
[1:27:15] said, "Ah, we can't take that kind of
[1:27:17] doctrine." Began to leave and that's
[1:27:21] that's exactly what Jesus said.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And he knew that he knew the breaking
[1:27:28] point.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; There was no persecution with the sermon
[1:27:33] on the mount.
[1:27:36] They didn't want to reject him for the
[1:27:38] sermon on the mount. That was so lovely.
[1:27:40] In fact, as the scripture says, your
[1:27:42] Bible says, they marveled at the
[1:27:46] gracious words that came from his lips.
[1:27:49] They never said that when he said, "I
[1:27:52] and my father are one."
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; They never said that when he said, "I am
[1:27:57] the bread that came down from heaven."
[1:28:00] That's right.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Your fathers did eat it in the
[1:28:03] wilderness and are dead, but I'm the
[1:28:05] bread that came down from heaven.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And except you eat the flesh of the son
[1:28:11] of man and drink his blood. They had the
[1:28:14] Bible, the old Torah Bible to go by,
[1:28:19] which simply says it's an abomination to
[1:28:22] eat the flesh of a man. He and and and
[1:28:26] he never explained it. He never
[1:28:29] explained it. Read it in your Bible. He
[1:28:31] never explained it. And the prophet of
[1:28:33] God is making a very special uh
[1:28:37] emphasis. He never explained it. You
[1:28:39] know why? Because it was happening right
[1:28:41] then again.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And he started in 1972. Brother Murphy,
[1:28:46] brother John, wasn't 62, I'm sorry. Then
[1:28:51] 64, 63, 64, and 65.
[1:28:55] Except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:28:58] man. What's he referring to? Except you
[1:29:01] take this manifestation that God is
[1:29:05] manifesting his word and performing all
[1:29:08] kinds of supernatural things.
[1:29:12] Taking that and not not just organizing
[1:29:16] a church around it, not just organizing
[1:29:19] some fellowship around it. That's fine.
[1:29:22] Not just saying that I have a
[1:29:25] confession. I I belong to a group that
[1:29:28] that believes this. Well, more than
[1:29:31] that, do you believe it?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Do you have it?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Has it had a resurrection in your life?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how how do you partake
[1:29:43] of it? How do you how do you eat of it?"
[1:29:47] Well,
[1:29:50] I guess what
[1:29:53] part of it would be what Mary did. She
[1:29:57] said, "This is impossible,
[1:30:01] but I'm going to ponder it.
[1:30:04] I'm going to believe it."
[1:30:07] And you may be sitting here today and
[1:30:09] saying,
[1:30:11] "It's too too strong.
[1:30:15] It's too difficult. Why don't you leave
[1:30:18] it to him
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; who can do these things
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; to say I will let I will believe on him.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I will let him who has called me. I will
[1:30:30] let him do it.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You might say I don't have the ability.
[1:30:35] You're correct. We don't have the
[1:30:37] ability. He wants to give it to us.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He says he says himself I will do it.
[1:30:43] Are you able to drink the cup? Says, "We
[1:30:46] be able."
[1:30:48] We are able.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; They didn't even realize what they were
[1:30:53] asking for. Are you able to drink this
[1:30:56] cup? And the two disciples and the other
[1:31:00] disciples said, "We're able."
[1:31:04] What is the cup? It's the blood. And the
[1:31:09] blood produces the life. It's the life
[1:31:12] of the scripture. It's the life of the
[1:31:15] word. It's not a technical thing where
[1:31:18] you say, "Well, I must do thou shalt not
[1:31:21] and thou shalt and thou shalt not." It's
[1:31:23] not that. It's a life
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; that's moving through you. And is it
[1:31:28] going to be accepted? No. It won't be
[1:31:30] accepted by all. You'll be whackled as
[1:31:34] some people,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; but to God, he said, "You're my
[1:31:37] daughter.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You're my son.
[1:31:40] Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; I wanted to
[1:31:54] also just express to you
[1:32:00] that there's a hunger in the body.
[1:32:04] There's a hunger also in the spirit
[1:32:07] realm, the emotional realm.
[1:32:12] And people can hunger for affection.
[1:32:17] They can hunger for attention.
[1:32:22] They can hunger for association.
[1:32:26] I want to be identified. I want to be
[1:32:29] connected with somebody. I want to be
[1:32:31] connected to something.
[1:32:34] But there's also a hunger for the soul.
[1:32:38] And in the soul, there's one channel to
[1:32:40] the soul.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; I want to hear what he said.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I want to hear what he said.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; He said in this particular place
[1:32:52] with desire, oh Lord Jesus,
[1:32:56] you've desired
[1:32:58] this Passover.
[1:33:02] What's he saying? He's saying
[1:33:06] some of your wretched past.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I want to pass over it.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I have a power of forgiveness
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; that no one in the world has.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; No church organization has. This is not
[1:33:23] a ceremony of washing or whatever more.
[1:33:27] But I I I've desired this Passover.
[1:33:30] Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I have the ability
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; to say to you,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; you never sinned in the first place. I
[1:33:40] have that ability.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I am the new creation of God.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; This is a new covenant.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; This isn't a covenant that if you do
[1:33:54] this, I will do that.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; That's not this kind of covenant. This
[1:33:59] kind of covenant is I've already done
[1:34:02] it.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I've already given it. I've already paid
[1:34:06] the price.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Now you are free to live the life.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You can claim it for yourself.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; You can claim things that you don't
[1:34:17] appear to possess. You can claim it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And that might be too much for you. But
[1:34:26] drink the cup. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Take it anyway.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And drink the cup.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Are you able to drink the cup? I'm able.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Not in my own power, but in your grace
[1:34:40] somehow you'll make a way where there is
[1:34:42] no way.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; I'm able. I will drink the cup.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I will drink all of it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want to close fairly soon.
[1:34:57] But when God, the angel of the Lord,
[1:35:02] listen closely,
[1:35:04] came to the Leodysian church and found
[1:35:09] them wishy-washy.
[1:35:11] Well, yeah.
[1:35:15] You know what I call wishy-washy?
[1:35:17] I was preaching for seven years.
[1:35:22] I was preaching in I I had a big
[1:35:26] question. I I was trying to be honest.
[1:35:29] How should a person be baptized?
[1:35:32] And finally, I had five people that
[1:35:34] wanted to be baptized.
[1:35:36] And some of them were big, tall fellows,
[1:35:40] much much taller than me. In fact, is I
[1:35:43] was scheming how I was going to get them
[1:35:45] up out of the water.
[1:35:47] I had one guy, brother John, who was
[1:35:49] about 6'5
[1:35:51] and I said, "You know what?" I said,
[1:35:55] "And water was cold. It was arctic
[1:35:59] water. I said, I want you to kneel down
[1:36:04] in the water and kneel with the current
[1:36:07] behind you so that I will have the
[1:36:09] current to help me lift you up." And
[1:36:11] they said, "Oh, no, no, no, no." He said
[1:36:15] he was he didn't want that easy stuff.
[1:36:17] He said he put his armor around me just
[1:36:19] like iron. He said, "You're going to go
[1:36:21] with me."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And I was walking down in the water,
[1:36:28] this Arctic water, and my legs were just
[1:36:31] turning purple. He was about the fifth
[1:36:33] one. And I said, "I uh
[1:36:37] I I knew him real well." I said to
[1:36:40] Tommy, I said, 'You know, uh, it's I'm
[1:36:44] I'm getting I'm getting too deep in the
[1:36:47] water. I said, 'You're going to come
[1:36:49] with me.
[1:36:52] And I was actually becoming quite
[1:36:54] buoyant.
[1:36:56] And uh, I baptized him. But, you know, I
[1:37:00] was trying to be honest. I'll tell you
[1:37:02] another side of it. There was a fellow
[1:37:04] that I knew and he didn't have a life
[1:37:07] that really
[1:37:10] was very respected or
[1:37:17] and I said, "Did you know how how how
[1:37:19] how did brother Brandham
[1:37:22] how did he believe in baptizing?" So he
[1:37:25] told me what he thought he believed in
[1:37:28] and I said, "Okay."
[1:37:31] So did I baptize them? Because I had
[1:37:34] good friends, preacher friends that
[1:37:37] baptized
[1:37:39] in the name of the Father, Son, and the
[1:37:41] Holy Ghost. I'd been baptized that way.
[1:37:46] And I I I wondered about it cuz you know
[1:37:52] and I I've even read just recently some
[1:37:55] said uh
[1:37:58] what are the main questions?
[1:38:01] What are the main questions come up?
[1:38:02] Says well Jesus says baptize them in the
[1:38:05] name of the father and the son and the
[1:38:07] holy ghost.
[1:38:10] Never occurred to me to say well what is
[1:38:13] the name?
[1:38:16] That seems to be the important thing.
[1:38:18] Baptize them in the name of the Father
[1:38:20] and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And and none of none of the men that I
[1:38:27] associated with even ever brought that
[1:38:29] up. They said, "Well, we just want to do
[1:38:32] what Jesus did, what Jesus said." And
[1:38:35] then when Peter comes over in the book
[1:38:36] of Acts, baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:38:39] Jesus Christ
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; or the in the name of the Lord or in the
[1:38:45] name of the in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:48] So I thought, well, if we're to do
[1:38:50] everything
[1:38:52] according to the scripture, that must be
[1:38:55] important. Then one day I had a man in
[1:38:59] my his name was Andrew Rasperson. He
[1:39:03] used to be pastor in Tacoma
[1:39:06] and he pastored in Edmonton as well.
[1:39:11] And I'm not ashamed to say I was I was
[1:39:14] ordained by him.
[1:39:16] He was the secretary of the group
[1:39:20] because it wasn't an organization. We
[1:39:22] didn't believe in denominations as such.
[1:39:26] and he was in my home just once
[1:39:29] and he said,
[1:39:32] "And there was another person staying in
[1:39:34] my home. His name was Bud Southwick."
[1:39:37] For those of you that know Brother Bud
[1:39:40] Southwick, there was a guide up north.
[1:39:45] And we're sitting at the table
[1:39:48] after service on Wednesday night
[1:39:51] and brother Rasmmanson says, "You know,
[1:39:55] Brother Eddie, you should contact
[1:39:57] Brother Brandham. He loves to hunt, you
[1:40:00] know."
[1:40:02] I said, "Well,
[1:40:04] the next day, I think it was, I wrote a
[1:40:06] letter to him."
[1:40:08] And here
[1:40:10] this prophet of God.
[1:40:13] Now I'm going to give you just a small
[1:40:16] clip of my testimony. I had resigned the
[1:40:20] church where I was there and had moved
[1:40:25] to Victoria,
[1:40:27] British Columbia.
[1:40:29] And I had written Brother Brandham a
[1:40:31] letter and I said, "A friend of mine
[1:40:34] who's a rancher, Bud Southbick, who's a
[1:40:36] rancher, has been offered a property, 45
[1:40:41] miles square
[1:40:43] up on the Alaskan Highway
[1:40:46] and I'
[1:40:48] I'd love to take you out for a rest."
[1:40:52] And that what was in my heart. It wasn't
[1:40:55] doctrine. It wasn't questions as such,
[1:40:58] but I had huge questions.
[1:41:00] How should a person be baptized?
[1:41:05] And
[1:41:07] what is the godhead like?
[1:41:10] Is it one? Is it two? Is it three?
[1:41:13] Someone who would led me into the
[1:41:15] ministry.
[1:41:17] He opened the doors in the United
[1:41:19] States. He said, "Well, I just see two."
[1:41:24] And uh
[1:41:26] others there are three.
[1:41:28] But how many am I going to see when I'm
[1:41:30] in heaven? Well, I thought I'd only see
[1:41:34] one.
[1:41:35] But h how do I only see one? Here's
[1:41:39] Jesus and here's the Holy Spirit and you
[1:41:42] you know all the rest of it. Just a big
[1:41:44] confusion.
[1:41:46] So was I lukewarm? Yeah, I guess on that
[1:41:49] point I was lukewarm.
[1:41:53] Well, I don't want to be identified with
[1:41:54] those that are lukewarm.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; So, I didn't know how to baptize. I
[1:42:00] didn't know exactly the Godhead.
[1:42:03] And one thing that scared me to death
[1:42:05] was the serpent's seed.
[1:42:08] And so,
[1:42:11] I'm up there. You know what I was
[1:42:13] expecting?
[1:42:16] One thing I knew.
[1:42:18] Listen to me now.
[1:42:20] You may never hear this again.
[1:42:24] One thing I knew, if that angel of the
[1:42:27] Lord, he would not stand at the platform
[1:42:31] and honor a lie. Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And I knew if the angel of the Lord was
[1:42:36] there
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; and uh I'm I'm I'm
[1:42:42] sitting on the platform
[1:42:46] in the United Church Hall
[1:42:49] in Dawson Creek, British Columbia.
[1:42:53] And here's the people all lined up down
[1:42:57] to come for prayer.
[1:43:00] And one night they came from this
[1:43:02] direction or they were over here and
[1:43:04] there was a woman very good friend of my
[1:43:07] family and I knew her very well. Her
[1:43:12] name was
[1:43:13] Sister Clu
[1:43:17] N Dt.
[1:43:19] German couple.
[1:43:21] She and her husband did not have
[1:43:23] children.
[1:43:25] And she was standing here with her hand
[1:43:28] like this.
[1:43:30] And uh
[1:43:32] now here's William Brham. Listen to a
[1:43:35] story. Now
[1:43:38] put yourself in my shoes.
[1:43:45] I'm saying in my heart if the angel of
[1:43:48] the Lord is still here at the platform
[1:43:50] now wanting if there's a manifestation
[1:43:54] of it and he says
[1:43:58] brother Brandham says to her
[1:44:01] he said you're very nervous and he
[1:44:03] talked about that for a few moments then
[1:44:06] he said
[1:44:09] you have something else very much on
[1:44:11] your heart
[1:44:12] you're praying for a and
[1:44:15] he said he's
[1:44:18] dying with cancer.
[1:44:22] He said and he lives just north of here.
[1:44:26] I believe it's a town called
[1:44:30] Fort St. John.
[1:44:34] Yes, that's right. Well, I I was forgive
[1:44:40] me but I was just dismayed. I was
[1:44:45] and I was petrified
[1:44:48] because I'm sitting in the car the next
[1:44:50] day, the next morning. I'm sitting in
[1:44:53] the car. Put yourself where I am sitting
[1:44:57] in the car. I thought at any moment he
[1:45:00] might just turn and look.
[1:45:02] Wouldn't want you to be in that place. I
[1:45:07] didn't want him to say, "You scoundrel.
[1:45:10] you don't believe
[1:45:12] in this ministry. And I did believe in
[1:45:16] it. I believed in it thus far and I
[1:45:19] didn't know. But I'm faced with great
[1:45:23] questions
[1:45:24] that are in the scripture.
[1:45:27] I have the scripture.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; I have good friends that have gone
[1:45:31] through Bible schools, but we don't have
[1:45:34] an absolute. Right?
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; I want to know what is absolutely
[1:45:40] essential.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a preacher, but I don't have an
[1:45:44] absolute. I felt very
[1:45:48] almost humiliated
[1:45:52] basic basic things. When I get in the
[1:45:55] tank, I really don't have a thus sayeth
[1:45:57] the Lord of what to do.
[1:46:01] One day
[1:46:03] I wasn't with the brother Southwick had
[1:46:06] brother Brandham with him.
[1:46:09] I had gone a different direction that
[1:46:11] evening we had just finished supper
[1:46:15] and he said
[1:46:18] he brother Brandham said I think I'll
[1:46:20] just go out and maybe get a rabbit or
[1:46:23] get some meat for the camp.
[1:46:26] He said would you like to come brother
[1:46:27] Eddie? Yes. I said I would like to come
[1:46:30] but I was doing going to do the dishes
[1:46:34] and another brother very good friend of
[1:46:36] mine Chris Burke he was a Laplander from
[1:46:38] Norway
[1:46:40] he said yeah he said I'll go too
[1:46:45] and then the last then he said
[1:46:47] immediately no he said I'm going to stay
[1:46:50] and do the dishes you go brother Eddie
[1:46:54] so I was happy with that and then we
[1:46:56] went and we just walked down the
[1:46:58] a short distance and I could see that
[1:47:00] brother Brandon wasn't interested in
[1:47:04] really a hunt.
[1:47:06] And so he just walked over and sat on a
[1:47:08] log. And I sat on a log. Some of you
[1:47:11] here from the church, you've heard it
[1:47:14] many times. Please bear with me. And I'm
[1:47:17] just sitting there. I have a purpose for
[1:47:19] saying this. I'm just sitting there on
[1:47:22] the log. He's sitting right beside me on
[1:47:24] this side. I'm sitting right here. our
[1:47:26] knees were almost coming together.
[1:47:29] He said, "You know,
[1:47:32] this afternoon I was riding on my
[1:47:34] horse," said behind brother Southwick
[1:47:38] and the sun was shining down
[1:47:43] warm and bright. He said, "I believe you
[1:47:46] have three questions you'd like to ask
[1:47:49] me."
[1:47:52] And and I looked up at his eyes, his
[1:47:54] face then and it had changed a wee bit
[1:47:59] and he said, "I I I believe you want to
[1:48:02] ask me
[1:48:04] about the baptism."
[1:48:06] He just took the questions as they were
[1:48:08] in my heart about the baptism,
[1:48:12] about the Godhead
[1:48:14] and the serpent seed.
[1:48:17] I could have melted.
[1:48:19] I said, "That's exactly right." But I
[1:48:22] had a I had a scripture and I thought,
[1:48:25] "This is how strict I was."
[1:48:29] I thought if he seeks to circumvent the
[1:48:33] scripture,
[1:48:35] that would be the end of our friendship.
[1:48:38] And I I have a hard time admitting that,
[1:48:41] but that's what was in my heart. if he
[1:48:44] circumvents the scripture. And I said in
[1:48:47] the but brother Brandham I said the
[1:48:49] scripture says and Adam knew his wife
[1:48:53] and she conceived and bore a son called
[1:48:58] his name Cain for I received a man from
[1:49:01] the Lord. What could be simpler than
[1:49:04] that? He said that's exactly the truth.
[1:49:10] He said, "Huh?" You know, inside I was
[1:49:12] saying, "How can you say that? That's my
[1:49:14] defense.
[1:49:17] He's agreeing with it 100%." He said,
[1:49:20] "But you need to read the next
[1:49:22] scripture."
[1:49:24] I didn't even know what the scripture
[1:49:26] was.
[1:49:27] I didn't even know it was what was in
[1:49:29] the Bible. He said, "And she again bore
[1:49:33] his brother." She didn't conceive again.
[1:49:36] She bore his brother
[1:49:38] Abel. They were twins.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:49:45] you said, "Did you get a revelation?"
[1:49:47] No. All I realized is I had missed
[1:49:50] something.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; But there was something in my heart and
[1:49:53] soul.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I And the God that brought me here is
[1:49:59] obliged to tell me the truth.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] Yes.
[1:50:10] To tell us the truth
[1:50:15] and u
[1:50:18] that was the end of it.
[1:50:20] That was just the beginning. That's why
[1:50:23] I understood the message
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; brother John was speaking the other
[1:50:28] night.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I had a resurrection
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; inside. I had a resurrection. I've been
[1:50:34] able to share it with leaders of other
[1:50:37] organizations.
[1:50:39] Had them right here in this study.
[1:50:42] Leaders
[1:50:44] that saw such manifestation
[1:50:46] in the same meetings
[1:50:49] in the same meetings.
[1:50:55] Well, I don't even know whether I should
[1:50:56] tell you, but a man sat in this
[1:50:59] congregation.
[1:51:01] He was invited here by brother Edward
[1:51:03] Dods.
[1:51:04] And he came here, he was in the meeting
[1:51:06] in Portland, Oregon, when a maniac came
[1:51:10] up
[1:51:11] and was going to tear
[1:51:14] brother Brandham from limb to limb.
[1:51:18] And he told me about that also.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And that man fell down across his legs,
[1:51:26] across his shoes.
[1:51:28] And furthermore,
[1:51:32] that man sat in my office back here and
[1:51:36] I gave my testimony just what I told
[1:51:39] you.
[1:51:42] And he said,
[1:51:44] "Oh." He said, "You wouldn't believe
[1:51:46] that stuff, would you?" And I slapped
[1:51:49] his arm. I said, "Not only would you
[1:51:52] believe it, but in 15 minutes you'll
[1:51:55] believe it.
[1:51:57] you believe the serpent's seed. It's a
[1:52:00] fundamental doctrine of the scripture.
[1:52:02] And I took him to Corinthians and I
[1:52:04] said, "You read those two scriptures for
[1:52:07] me, one and two." And it was Apostle
[1:52:10] Paul saying,
[1:52:12] "I am jealous over you with a godly
[1:52:14] jealousy.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; For I have espoused you to one husband,
[1:52:18] even Christ,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; that I may present you as a chasteed
[1:52:22] virgin to Jesus Christ." I said, "When
[1:52:26] you finish reading that,
[1:52:29] declare to me
[1:52:32] that Eve only had one husband."
[1:52:36] Said, "I have espoused you to one
[1:52:38] husband
[1:52:40] that I may I have espoused you to one
[1:52:44] husband that I may present you as a
[1:52:46] chasteed virgin to Jesus Christ." That's
[1:52:51] what the scripture says. And I said,
[1:52:54] "You interpret that for me." He said,
[1:52:56] "Never studied it."
[1:52:59] One from the Assemblies of God was here
[1:53:02] in this church in the other office. And
[1:53:05] I said the same thing and read the same
[1:53:07] scripture and he made two long pages of
[1:53:10] notes. Neither one have come back.
[1:53:13] Neither one apparently have studied it.
[1:53:15] But I would say one thing. When I saw
[1:53:18] how a person ought to be baptized,
[1:53:21] I'm glad to say I'm glad to say
[1:53:27] I'm proud to say that we are able to use
[1:53:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when a
[1:53:37] person is being identified
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; with this death,
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; with this cup,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; with this resurrection.
[1:53:46] And I'm able to say, "God bless you
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; that have taken and drank the cup
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; and been a part of it."
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; And then I will I will just close with
[1:53:58] this.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; In the 10th chapter of Revelation,
[1:54:15] John was given
[1:54:18] an open book and you hear about it all
[1:54:20] the time. And I want to I want to dwell
[1:54:23] on that just for a moment, just a couple
[1:54:26] moments.
[1:54:29] And the book was sealed with seven
[1:54:31] seals, but now it was open. We hear
[1:54:33] about that all the time,
[1:54:36] what about the contents of it?
[1:54:40] And then John was given an open book and
[1:54:44] the angel said to him,
[1:54:49] said, "Take this book
[1:54:52] and I'm going to just look at the
[1:54:53] scriptures with you.
[1:54:59] And the voice when I heard And the voice
[1:55:03] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:55:07] again and said, "Go and take,
[1:55:12] go and take the little book
[1:55:17] which is open in the hand of the angel,
[1:55:21] which standeth upon the sea, and upon
[1:55:24] the earth." And I went unto the angel,
[1:55:27] and said unto him, Give me
[1:55:33] the little book.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, take it
[1:55:43] and eat it up.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Drinking all of it.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Everything that flows from this book.
[1:55:54] Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Don't dare to be ashamed of it.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Eat it up.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Not taste it.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Not just taste it,
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; but eat it up.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; How did Mary eat it up? She pondered it
[1:56:11] until it happened.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; She pondered it until the Lord Jesus.
[1:56:16] She still didn't know. She still didn't
[1:56:18] she she she had no relationship with any
[1:56:22] man.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; She remained a virgin.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; But our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; was able to drink that part of the cup
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; and declare that that was his birth.
[1:56:35] Even though he was openly declared to be
[1:56:38] born of fornication
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; and he rejected that,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; that was not in his cup.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; And he drank the cup. He was born of a
[1:56:47] virgin.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And now the book, there were things in
[1:56:58] the book when when Jesus said, "Drink
[1:57:01] all of it."
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; There was there was aspects or
[1:57:06] segments or parts of or events of the
[1:57:11] life of Jesus Christ. I'm giving you an
[1:57:15] invitation today.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; And the invitation is take the cup.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Drink ye all of it. Not take the cup and
[1:57:24] taste it, but take the cup. Drink ye all
[1:57:28] of it.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; There's part of it. Jesus. Yes, he went
[1:57:33] to the cross. Yes, he went to the tomb.
[1:57:37] Yes, we re remember that and
[1:57:40] historically may remember. I want to go
[1:57:43] way beyond history. I don't care what
[1:57:46] they say about he did history
[1:57:48] historically, but I know that I have
[1:57:51] received him.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; I know that I've had a resurrection.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I know that the light of the gospel of
[1:57:59] Jesus Christ has not because I'm
[1:58:02] standing here speaking. I'm here because
[1:58:05] others are away. But I am I'm happy to
[1:58:09] be here. I'm happy to declare that this
[1:58:13] living this is a living word. It's not
[1:58:17] just printed pages in a book,
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; but it is a living word.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And I can say to you today
[1:58:27] with confidence
[1:58:30] and with certain confidence.
[1:58:33] If you take it, you may not understand
[1:58:36] it.
[1:58:38] In fact is when Jesus said and brother
[1:58:41] Brandham referred to it if you don't
[1:58:44] believe it I'd like you to explain it
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; and he said eat my flesh
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; eat the flesh of the son of man how do
[1:58:53] you do that and that comes right back to
[1:58:56] the very basic he said it's an it's a
[1:59:02] basic principle of the scripture that
[1:59:05] you understand. We may not be able to
[1:59:10] work it in our mind and understand it.
[1:59:12] How do we how do we eat the flesh?
[1:59:15] H how do how do I eat the flesh of the
[1:59:18] son of man? He's a full book. How do I
[1:59:21] do it? In there there is difficulty. In
[1:59:26] there there is resurrection. In there
[1:59:28] there is difficult things and there's
[1:59:31] very wonderful things. But how do we how
[1:59:34] do we participate in it?
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; You just agree to live your life for
[1:59:40] him.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; I'm here. I know one thing. I will not
[1:59:47] be moved. I'm dedicated to live my life
[1:59:50] for him.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; I give myself to him. Amen.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I'll not run at a bad time.
[2:00:04] I'll not join at a good time.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; I just will listen to his voice.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; And I heard the voice of the angel.
[2:00:14] You heard the voice from some place.
[2:00:17] Where? Where did it come from? I don't
[2:00:19] know.
[2:00:23] I'm going to say to you today,
[2:00:27] I'm going making a declaration.
[2:00:31] When I heard Malachi 4 5 and 6, I just
[2:00:36] said within myself, of course,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; and this has to be the man. This is
[2:00:42] Elijah.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; This is the spirit of Elijah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; I've never seen anything like this.
[2:00:49] That's exactly what it is. And it's
[2:00:52] been, you say, "Well, what what did you
[2:00:55] experience?" A resurrection.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; It's been nothing but a resurrection
[2:01:00] ever since.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; And for those of you that have committed
[2:01:04] yourself, I say there is no other Jesus
[2:01:07] Christ than this one that was raised,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; this one that lives.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; How does he live? He lives in in us.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And John said,
[2:01:26] "Give it to me."
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And the angel said, "Eat it up." That's
[2:01:32] right.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And if you don't get anything else in
[2:01:36] this message today,
[2:01:39] what you have received,
[2:01:43] what you hear,
[2:01:45] and there's a witness inside,
[2:01:48] there's something more to it.
[2:01:51] It's not just a sermon.
[2:01:55] Eat it up.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Make it a part of your being. Let it
[2:02:01] become assimilated.
[2:02:04] Let it be ingested into your system.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Be a part of you. Every part
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; every day.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Otherwise,
[2:02:17] one day you call for a church and say,
[2:02:20] "Oh, church, church. Oh, denomination,
[2:02:24] denomination,
[2:02:26] help me. Pray for me."
[2:02:29] That's not it.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; You have to know it within yourself.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; You have said to me,
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; my wife is sitting in this service and
[2:02:46] with this I close.
[2:02:51] This book says certain things and this
[2:02:54] is part of the cup that I have drank.
[2:03:00] And we believe
[2:03:02] because this book says so.
[2:03:05] We believe
[2:03:07] that if you pray for the sick,
[2:03:11] they shall be healed.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; And my wife is, I'm going to be honest
[2:03:18] with you,
[2:03:21] she's one that can suffer a lot of pain
[2:03:23] and she doesn't say anything.
[2:03:28] And so here, right here in this town of
[2:03:31] Cloverdale,
[2:03:35] I was just had my hand on the door. We
[2:03:38] were going to the United States. We're
[2:03:40] going to Tacoma
[2:03:42] to visit a relative of mine.
[2:03:45] And I had my hand on the door.
[2:03:48] And she had her coat on.
[2:03:51] And she said, "And I'm her husband now.
[2:03:54] She's coming to another office.
[2:03:57] She said,
[2:04:00] "I want you to take the oil
[2:04:03] and anoint me
[2:04:06] that
[2:04:08] sickness or disease or something had
[2:04:11] come back on her."
[2:04:14] She had been examined by a specialist
[2:04:18] about 15 years before and he said, "If
[2:04:21] that ever comes back, you call me
[2:04:24] immediately."
[2:04:27] And she said, "I want you to take this
[2:04:31] and anoint me with oil." Now, she wasn't
[2:04:34] coming to her husband. He wasn't coming
[2:04:36] to Ed Biscll as such. She was coming to
[2:04:39] an office.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; This is what the scripture has said.
[2:04:45] I slid out a chair. I said, "Kneel
[2:04:49] here."
[2:04:50] And I anointed her with oil. And I now
[2:04:54] speak the truth.
[2:04:56] Before we went and had my hand on the
[2:05:00] door knob again, before she touched the
[2:05:03] door knob herself, she was instantly
[2:05:06] healed.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Instantly healed. Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about resurrection life.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about all doom and and
[2:05:16] rejection. I'm talking about
[2:05:18] resurrection life.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; She believed it.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; She's here. You can ask her.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Instantly healed.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; A few days ago. A few days ago,
[2:05:30] she said to me
[2:05:32] once again,
[2:05:34] years passed, but a few days ago, she
[2:05:38] said, "I want you to call
[2:05:41] the elders. I want you to call Brother
[2:05:45] Murphy."
[2:05:48] I called him,
[2:05:51] said, "I want you to pray for me." I
[2:05:54] called Brother Tom. She said, "Call the
[2:05:57] elders." I called brother Tom. We met
[2:06:00] right here in the study. I can take you
[2:06:01] to the very spot
[2:06:05] and pray for me.
[2:06:08] She said, "I have this terrible pain.
[2:06:11] How long have you had it?" About 3
[2:06:13] weeks. She'd been to emergency hospital.
[2:06:17] She'd been to the doctor
[2:06:21] and he said, "If you do this, you take
[2:06:23] this, it should disappear." It didn't
[2:06:25] disappear.
[2:06:28] and it got worse
[2:06:31] and some kind of something was wrong. We
[2:06:34] don't know what's wrong. We don't have
[2:06:36] to explain things.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And the brethren stood around and prayed
[2:06:42] for her. That's my wife back there.
[2:06:46] And before we walked to where the cars
[2:06:48] parked, she was instantly healed.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Now, does that happen every time? I know
[2:06:56] it doesn't happen every time, but
[2:06:58] whether you're healed or whether you are
[2:07:02] uh afflicted or whatever it is, I just
[2:07:05] know that I am the Lord's.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; I'm his
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; and he does what he wishes to do.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; And we just thank him for that.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Would you stand, please?
[2:07:23] I'm indeed happy
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; to have taken this time and to have you.
[2:07:29] This is one service we're having today,
[2:07:32] but to have you listen and hear these
[2:07:35] testimonies
[2:07:36] and I stand here as a witness. They are
[2:07:40] true.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; These things are absolutely true
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; and we give you the glory. Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, on this resurrection day,
[2:07:50] we're only celebrating. We're only
[2:07:53] commemorating.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; This is just the Passover. As your
[2:07:56] prophet said, this is just the Passover.
[2:08:00] This is just another Easter, but it
[2:08:02] might be something very different for
[2:08:05] someone. And I pray that it will be. Oh
[2:08:08] God, I want to give you thanks for
[2:08:12] having done what you have done. The
[2:08:14] healing on behalf of my wife. Oh God, I
[2:08:18] thank you for the healing in the
[2:08:20] supernatural that you have done in the
[2:08:23] congregation and amongst the believers.
[2:08:27] We do not know why. We do not know how
[2:08:31] it is all takes place, but we know that
[2:08:34] you are faithful to your word. Oh God, I
[2:08:38] pray that you'll bless our brother John
[2:08:40] is going to Seattle tonight, and I pray
[2:08:43] that you will bless that service
[2:08:46] mightily. Oh God, may the resurrected
[2:08:49] Christ present himself before the
[2:08:52] people. And this morning, Lord, today,
[2:08:56] even now, oh God, there's needy ones and
[2:09:00] spiritually needy or physically needy.
[2:09:04] And whatever it might be, you are the
[2:09:07] answer. We thank you for it in Jesus'
[2:09:10] name. I commit these words, these
[2:09:13] testimonies, and to this people in Jesus
[2:09:17] Christ's name. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:20] Amen.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder can we sing isn't he wonderful
[2:09:28] just uh nicely?
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:09:41] Wonderful.
[2:09:44] Isn't Jesus
[2:09:47] my Lord?
[2:09:49] Wonderful
[2:09:53] eyes have seen, ears have heard what's
[2:09:58] rewarding
[2:10:00] in God's word. Isn't Jesus
[2:10:05] my Lord wonderful?
[2:10:09] Once again, we'll pick it up a way bit.
[2:10:12] Isn't he wonderful?
[2:10:16] Wonderful.
[2:10:18] Wonderful.
[2:10:20] Isn't Jesus
[2:10:23] my Lord? Wonderful.
[2:10:28] My eyes have seen, ears have heard
[2:10:33] what's recorded in God's word. Isn't
[2:10:39] Jesus
[2:10:40] my Lord? Wonderful.
[2:10:45] Oh,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; although the world found to reject him,
[2:10:48] isn't he wonderful?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Although he hung on a cross, isn't he
[2:10:53] wonderful?
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; And then he resurrected.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; And the disciples and the apostles were
[2:11:00] fearful and they locked themselves into
[2:11:04] place. But isn't he wonderful? Yeah.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And wherever you are today,
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; whatever age you are,
[2:11:13] whatever your situation is,
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; I say he's wonderful.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Here comes a woman and the prophet of
[2:11:23] God stands here.
[2:11:25] I just love this so much. I mentioned it
[2:11:28] every once in a while. And the woman is
[2:11:31] sick and the woman may be dying. I don't
[2:11:34] know. And here's a prophet of God. He's
[2:11:37] preached from the same Bible I have
[2:11:39] here. He's preached and he said, and he
[2:11:43] takes a time and he says, "Isn't he
[2:11:46] lovely?"
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[2:11:52] I tell you what, friends, when you have
[2:11:54] that kind of relationship,
[2:11:56] isn't he lovely?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; He is indeed. Isn't he wonderful?
[2:12:06] Wonderful.
[2:12:08] Wonderful.
[2:12:10] Isn't Jesus
[2:12:12] my Lord? Wonderful.
[2:12:17] My eyes have seen his hand.
[2:12:22] What's recorded in God's word is in
[2:12:27] Jesus
[2:12:29] my Lord. Wonderful.
[2:12:33] Brother Murphy, will you come and close
[2:12:35] in prayer?
[2:12:39] Let's bow our head.
