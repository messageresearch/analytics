You may have your seats with all that's been taking place in the over these last weeks. I know that uh I know that the devil fights and that's good because when he fights and we have victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just wondering if there might be two or three of these young people, young men, young ladies that God has really done something of a unusual nature for. Just a complete deliverance. And then I know Satan comes in like a flood. And then I know that God raises up a standard against them. I just wonder if there's two or three that have had that experience in the last uh two, three weeks and want to jump up here and stand up here and and and just declare it before the congregation. I'm going to have a testimony or two. Is there somebody here that's had that? Don't be ashamed. Be real quick. I want to hear about your battle. I want to hear about your victory. &gt;&gt; And it'll be good for others. Maybe somebody today is in the middle of a battle and they need to hear about the victory. &gt;&gt; All right, David. Hallelujah. Bless you. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, um, we all know we're in a battle. Um, I just I just want to thank God. I mean, just standing here is uh is a miracle in itself. you know, as brother Ron Spencer said at the camp, right? We the revival has to start with us. So, um I I just come up here it is is just nothing's nothing is a is too little too big for God, you know, and standing here looking at everybody's face. I mean, Sam, my little brother, we've been through like a lot of battles. It might not be significant, but a lot of mind battles, a lot of outside influence and everything. And as uh I believe Stephen Camper said, the the you don't the heat of the devil doesn't come immediately, right? But slowly he bowls you up. Slowly he bowls you up and you don't know when you you end up uh just deep in sin. I'm not saying that I have I mean we sin every day. That's why we need the grace of God to pull us back up. You know, sometimes you you just get so beat down that you don't even feel like you're a Christian no more, right? So I'm I'm just here to just thank the Lord for all he's done, all the mind battles, all the influence, but now by his grace, I'm standing once again. So &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone else. &gt;&gt; You don't have any battles, do you? Sister. &gt;&gt; All right. There you are. Well, actually um um a few months ago um I had um um went to the doctor. It was in the evening time and I um had some stomach cramps and um I went in to because I didn't want to I didn't want it to be something serious or something. So anyway, they took these X-rays and they said that um they saw that that I might have that they said that they saw what was on there was lymphoma, which is a lymph cancer. And it's sort of like my husband was like um really upset him and but I you know I just I don't know I just felt like everything was at peace like and so they actually said well we have to tell you what we saw on the x-rays and then they said but they wanted another person to look at it. So another um doctor looked at it and they said they said the same thing and then my husband got you know really worried and I was sort of like what if it is you know and I was thinking you know I just I just felt like wherever God wants me you know even if I was to go home I was just not worried or anything. And so, um, let's see. It's sort of more scary up here than after hearing those the reports of, you know, the doctor's reports. Anyway, then they said, um, for then they said for they wanted still my, um, my regular doctor to look at the, um, reports. So, um, I went to him a few days later after that and they then that that same doctor said, "Well, his first his first words were,"Well, you're sort of a mystery." And I said, 'I know. And then um he said, 'Well, what we're going to do, he said he really wasn't sure, but it did look like there was something there. They said it was actually sort of around my um um the aorta that comes down from the heart that there was some kind of something there that's where where often lymphoma is. And so, um, they said, well, he said, what I'm going to, what you can do is actually go in and they said, we can go in and, um, take some samples and, um, see if it's actually cancer or we can wait. And then I thought, that's what I'd like to do, just wait and wait on the Lord. And then he said after a few months to go back in again and um, have another CAT scan done. And so about two two months later or something, I went in again and had a CAT scan. And then the doctor called back and he said um he said that it had all shrunk and it was all gone. &gt;&gt; And so I was just praising the Lord and thanking &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; We just had a phone call. were talking with some people uh yesterday and brother Billy Andrews who many of you know brother Billy Andrews they found a tumor on his brain and uh scheduled him for an operation and his wife just I don't know uh just how it came about. I hadn't spoken to uh Sister Andrews but she said to him, "You are healed." And so he they went in to operate and he said, "Just before you operate, I'd like you to do uh one more examination." And they examined him, did a CAT scan, I guess, and couldn't find it. It wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he was already under the effects of it. He was already losing his memory and and all of these things. Well, God's the same, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Is there one more of the young All right, here we are. I knew there was one or two there hanging in. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, I guess I better say it. Um, as many of you know, I was already allergic to bees and all that and like hornets and all that stuff. And I had a reaction like three like about a month ago and I said a testimony and everything. God really. And then Wednesday, um I guess the doctor told me that was it was really serious and I was going to have to go on this big two a year episode and I just wasn't really looking forward to that. And so brother John prayed with me and I asked brother John to ask the Lord just for his will because God has his will and you don't want to it's better just to go with his will, right? So anyways, um I I really wanted to be healed, but then I was like, you know what, just be neutral, whatever God wants. It could be character building, right? He he he always knows what's best. So, um, Brother John prayed and he just prayed that I would actually be healed. And the next day at work, um, I was just about to leave and then I got stung again right on the stomach. I was like, "No way. I can't believe I just got stung again." So anyways, I prayed right away. way. I just went to the clubhouse and prayed for about five minutes and then I took my medication just some pills just cuz you you know you don't want to be foolish. God uses doctors and medicine. So I did that and then I went to emergency and I waited for two hours and nothing happened. There was no no reaction nothing. The doctor the day before me, he told me that in about half an hour, he said, "You would have a really bad deathly reaction." And nothing was happening for about 2 hours. So I went and saw a doctor and he's like, "I don't know how to explain it." He says, "I guess you can go." Me and my mom are just like smiles like up to here. Like we know we we knew what it was. &gt;&gt; So I just wanted to say praise God. I guess I'm healed. So &gt;&gt; thank you, brother, for praying. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you, brother Peter. Oh, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to thank everyone for their prayers. Um, I know right from the oldest person, Brother Alan King, to the young people at the doulies, I just felt um I guess there's one word to say saturated by prayer. &gt;&gt; And um there's no other way to explain it. &gt;&gt; I just uh right to the last minute, I thought they were going to tell me they made a big mistake because I didn't feel any like I was, you know, anything was wrong with me. So, uh I don't know. I guess it's still a same thing. I still I don't know what it was all for, but I know the Lord uh had his hand on the whole thing. And you know, I'm just so thankful, &gt;&gt; you know, I just thinking um you know, you you see a congregation and you know that they're praying for you and to me it's just an example of the ministry. And brother Random says, "We'll no go no higher than our pastor." And I think a bouquet goes to brother Ed for for the example and for, you know, for what I've gone through to know that people have been praying for me and it's just a a um direct response of our ministry. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I appreciate those kind words, but I tell you what, I think it's uh just the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ extended to us. We want to thank each one of you. Now, glad I have everyone's attention and wherever you are in the fellowship room, in the nursery. I'd like it all to fall quiet right now. I have a very important an announcement. I received an email this last week informing me that the entire library of Brother Brandham's sermons are now available for printing from your own personal computer. The email did not have uh or indicate its source or who sent it, but I have been on the website that they directed me to. And I can say this that this is probably without question one of the most remarkable things that has happened within the message since God brought it to us. There are several hundred messages that are not printed as of this date. There are several hundred of the 1100 and some messages that have never been printed. and some many of them are out of print. That has all changed as of today. &gt;&gt; As of this morning, &gt;&gt; I understand also for the first time in the history of the message that you can hear the voice while you read the book &gt;&gt; on the screen. So this morning before I came to church, I went in and I noticed after the title of the message, it had B for book or L for letter. This happens to be very important because there's countries such as China and Vietnam and so on where it' be important to have it. If you have it in book form, it's too formal and they regard that as a something that is could be illegal with the government. But this is like if it comes out in this form, they consider that for your own personal study. And so that is perfectly fine. And then it had B and then it had L and then it had MP3. And I clicked on the MP3 on letting off the pressure and up came brother Brandham's voice preaching the message. And then I clicked on L and up came the message itself. And now I called my wife with tears coming in my eyes. I said come here. And I was reading the message and listening to it. And that's the way I love to study. And for the first time in history, you're able to do that. &gt;&gt; We are &gt;&gt; we are able we are now able to print messages that have been unavailable, have not been printed. And I have had many, many requests for messages that have been out of print for years. And they are now available. And we will be printing them for our congregation. [Applause] I understand that all that all the messages uh may not be uh available as of this moment but uh I do know that they are being uh being loaded every perhaps every day. I don't know. I they haven't informed me as of that but uh churches now anywhere in the world can print the message for their own people. Anything the pastor feels directed to do he will be able to make it available to the people and you can print it in your own home. This is the most remarkable announcement I've been able to make to this church along these lines because we we have not been able to make that kind of a a statement to you. Uh and I expect that you'll need to absorb these things. I've tried to give you the announcement as clearly as I could from the information that I received. There will be uh this is the announcement they sent out and it is the website is www.thefreeword.com www.thefreeword.com thefreeword.com. I'm glad for the freeword.com. You will find this posted on a number of places uh in the church. We just uh that was the one that they had sent. So, we printed four or five off and they'll be I think at the tithe box on the bulletin board, the bulletin board in the fellowship room. And so uh uh I've just got a number of the in the book form. These are just very unprofessional as far as being these are not glamorous. We're not interested in glamour. We're interested in getting the word. Uh if you tell me would I sooner have this today or something that was beautiful two years from now, forget the beauty. Just give me this, you know, just let me have my hands on it. And uh so I'm I'm I can't describe my uh happiness and enthusiasm about that. Brother Tony came and handed me this just in the study. Brother Tony, maybe you'd like to just say a word about it. Uh happy to have brother Tony and says Rebecca to back. This is the uh the third edition of the printing of the revelation of the seven seals in the Chinese language. And so the believers uh of course around the world that speak Chinese are very very happy for this. And it's uh just hot off the press. We just got it finished. And so having returned there from the body of believers in China, uh I was be a I was glad to be able to bring it back for us. And uh also uh brother Xiao Ala Santo our brother and sister have come back from China after many years as sister Tracy's mom and dad. So um welcome them also in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus name I press on. You can play that. Do we have the words to in Jesus name I press on? Okay. Could you help me with that, brother Rod? Let's just sing a a course or two as we stand and then I'm going to turn to the word right away. Thank you for your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Jesus name we press on. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we press on. In Jesus name we press on and on dear Lord we clear before our eyes we find the strength. to press on once more. Shall we [Music] in Jesus name? We press on. &gt;&gt; We press on Lord in Jesus name. We press on and dear Lord with the prize here before our eyes. We find the strength to press on. with our heads bowed just before we turn to the word. Father, our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And we see that your will is being done. We desire earnestly to be a part of that. And we believe that you have called us for that specific purpose, that we can be a part of this great kingdom that is being established in the earth. Thank you Lord for bringing the brother Tony and sister Rebecca home safely and for all that are gathered here today. We pray that you will illuminate our minds with the special anointing of the Holy Spirit and may the word drop to the soul not merely to the ears Lord or to the mind but down to the soul. We pray that you'll bless this day oh God. Bless our brother John Andy's as he is prepared for tonight's service. And we pray Lord that this uh sanctuary will be filled to capacity as it is even now. And all that are listening and uh part of the family oh God that we feel united with. Pray that you'll bless them wherever they are in the world that are listening at this time. Every room, every place, oh God, in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint us with that special divine presence. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. I want to read a few verses out of Romans, the first chapter. I'm starting at verse 21 to verse 25. Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and to for-footed beasts and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them to a up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves. Notice verse 25, please. who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless his word to our hearts. You have your seats. I have a rather strange subject and I believe it will certainly apply to everyone at some level. It's one of those difficult subjects because it covers such a vast area. But I want to speak on serving the system. I told you I would be speaking on the system. So I want to take that from that direction. serving the system. In in verse 25, it said, "Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator." You see, the only the only reason that the creature has to really exist is because of the creator. But if the creator and the life, the essence, the meaning of life, if it if it vacates, if it if it departs, then all you have really is a shell that's left and people end up serving this shell rather than the life that's supposed to be dwelling in it. Now I want to take the word served for example would mean to serve for hire either to the gods or men and used like uh uh as of slaves or free men or to render religious service or homage. I think of just quickly how many churches today are filled with people and many more people than we have here today and are actually serving the system &gt;&gt; rather than the one who's supposed to be dwelling in the system. I had a note given me. I had I passed it. I was decided not to read it. Now I've decided to read it. But there's a church in Houston. I understand non-denominational Lakewood Church. And I have nothing against Lakewood Church. I don't know. I don't know anybody there. Uh but they moved into a new location. Uh they spent $95 million in renovations, including two waterfalls and enough carpeting to cover nine football fields. And the arena is now the sanctuary of the church with a congregation of 30,000 revenues of 55 million and last year last year rather and the television audience in the millions. Like many new evangelical churches, the building has no cross, no stained windows, no other religious icons. Instead, it has a cafe with wireless internet access, 32 video game kiosks, and a vault to store the offering. That's what's important. So, we have they asked us when we designed this church, do we want a little like a little coffee bar at where the stairs go up to the up to the balcony? I said, 'We certainly do not want a coffee bar.' Well, he said, "That's that's that's what everybody wants today in the church. As soon as you dismiss that, they're able to go out and have a a little coffee bar out there." Can you imagine? We say, "Well, folks, the meeting's over. Welcome to Starbucks that's in the foyer of the church. I thank God for the message that this is the way and the way evangelicals are going." Well, that's not the evangelical that I am &gt;&gt; or that we are or that you are. &gt;&gt; So, they served the system and it says to serve it like gods. Uh, and the creature is something that has been created. Now, I I just want to give a your a little understanding of the system. The system is an orderly combination or arrangement of parts or elements into a whole. That's the system. It is a orderly arrangement or a combination of parts or the elements. It's any methodical arrangement of parts. And in science, the system an orderly collection of logically uh related principles or facts or objects. It's any group of facts or phenomena regarded as constituting a natural whole and furnishing the basis and material of scientific investigation or construction as the solar system. Now God put the entire universe and we believe that into place. &gt;&gt; I don't care they want to call it the big bang. There might have been a big bang. I don't know. Nobody was back there. And all the people who talk about the big bang, they don't know. It's only an assumption on their basis. But however it happened, God did it. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. God did it. &gt;&gt; I don't care how he did it. And it's amazing to me how that uh men as as wise as they are and as intelligent as they are can miss the fact that, you know, they have to have a a a a prophet come with the wisdom of God. But they don't regard that. that and brother Brandham says many times that you know he had a seventh grade education but here I think God just he finds the world in their wisdom as being foolishness they can't even find the period after that first statement &gt;&gt; in the beginning God created a heaven and earth period &gt;&gt; and it doesn't know we don't know whether it's billions of years or trillions of years and we couldn't care less we don't care God did it and that's all we're concerned about and the scripture says in Psalms 147:4 For he tellth the number of the stars, he calleth them all by their names. In Job, he asked Job, "Test thou bind the sweet influences of Pleades or loose the bands of Orion? Can't thou find or cast thou bring forth Mazeroth in his season and that's a whole constellation of stars and they move." I think it has incredible significance how God has set the whole planetary system into such a uh such a distinct and precise order. He said, "Test thou guide Arcturus with his sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven, and canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?" Can you do this, Job? And Job, of course, when you look up into the heavens and you see all that magnificent uh uh and and we're only seeing a small part of it, but regardless how far man can look into the distant universe, it just becomes more glorious and more marvelous and more intriguing and more wonderful because God did it. &gt;&gt; And there's no way that we're going to assimilate that in our minds. We just can't discover it. But then God also commanded the people, you will not worship these bodies, these heavenly bodies. You will not worship these stars because that was only the system. &gt;&gt; That was not the creator. &gt;&gt; And soon as you get rid of the creator and your mind is is void of him, then you're only worshiping the system anymore. And so he commanded them that they could not do that. Now we have so many systems I won't even be able to mention them all and neither do I want to get to them all but in the creation then when God turned his focus and began to create the uh order and the design and the evolution of the uh creatures that were on the earth and that's why I said here that they began to worship 4-footed beasts and all these things that's part of the system see that's not the creator but the people where when they turn away from God and they turn away from his his commandments then the worship is a part of the human structure and he's got to worship something. Brother Brham said he'll worship the sun, he'll worship the moon, he'll worship the stars, he'll worship Isaiah said he'll worship a stalk of wood. &gt;&gt; He'll just worship something. He's got to worship something. Uh I believe some people worship their dogs. &gt;&gt; Well, they worship their car. They worship their job. They could worship their wife or husband or worship their children. Anything that comes between you and God becomes a god. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is. And a whole lot of people worship money. &gt;&gt; Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; That happens to be just part of the system. And it's and it's because people don't recognize God and identified a masterpiece of God. Prophet said God the Holy Spirit brooding over the earth and the birds came out maybe and the animals different things and kept coming more in the form of the one that was brooding it more in the form of the one that was brooding until finally came up a species that looked just exactly like the one that was doing the brooding. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, man was made in the image of God. And he says, "And God placed his handiwork in the placed his handiwork in the garden of Eden and made him a helpmate." What a complete satisfaction it was to God till even he rested. Now the system was complete. And the system is complete when all the parts are present because the system must be a composite of all of the parts that were intended to be part of the system. If you take a certain part out, then you don't have a system anymore. It breaks down. We hear today the system broke down. &gt;&gt; Something happened. The system couldn't function. The system got overloaded. The system broke down. And when the system breaks down, then it can't function anymore. &gt;&gt; We have physically speaking, we have a a nervous system, you have a blood circulatory system, you have a digestive system, you have all these systems which go to make up your physical body. But if one of those begins to fail, you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Just one of them. &gt;&gt; The shell is still here. You still look the same, but you can't act the same. You can't function properly. You can't do what you're supposed to do because the system starts to break down and the one is interrelated with the other. How thankful we are today. I trust that they all are working &gt;&gt; a systems of this of this of this body. But if the if if the very life of the body begins to depart this body, what good is your nervous system? What good is all the other systems that go to make you up? If the life goes there's nothing there. Prophet said God is a God of order and he will bring the thing right up then he will bring the thing into order. The thing that he has uh devised and designed in his mind he will bring it into order. And the scripture tells us how we look at the whole of creation that when God completed his work of creation and the prophet said and he rested and we read in the scripture when he completed the work of creation and all the system was in place the whole heavenly solar system the system of the universe all the planetary system all of these systems great eternal God who had made all of these things and then brought up all of the creatures and kept brooding over it by a spirit, brooding over it until finally one came on the scene that was in the image of the one who was brooding over it. And when it was all finished, then God stepped down into it. Then it was complete. &gt;&gt; It was not complete until God stepped down into it. And I don't care who is present or who's hearing my word today. I don't care what kind of system you function in. Whether it's your job or your educational system or whatever other kind of system you might have or your physical system and all of the all of the systems of your body that go to make it up, it is all empty &gt;&gt; unless he who designed it comes down into the midst of it. This whole church, you can have all the you can have the musical instruments and you can have the ministry and you can have the singers and you can have the deacons and you can have the trust. You can have the whole thing structured up, but un unless it's pleasing to God and God steps down into it, the whole structure is just empty. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We want him, &gt;&gt; the author, &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of our faith to be in amongst his people and then that gives us meaning here this morning. Otherwise, why are we sitting here? What are we listening to? What am I preaching for? What are we singing for? What are we playing instruments for? Why are you here? Unless he is here. And when he is pleased and comes down amongst us &gt;&gt; and I see h such uh such indication of his pleasure &gt;&gt; when he begins to move on the individual lives &gt;&gt; and uh we talk about the young people don't ever forget I'm not going to ride that play that tune as it were uh uh without without cause or without purpose. I tell you what, brother Brandham tells things that God did and it sounds like it was yesterday. Sometimes it's 30 years ago, &gt;&gt; many, many years ago. He tells about it. Why? Because it's just as fresh as it was yesterday. It's as fresh. And anything God has done, anything God has done of a supernatural nature, I tell you, it's just the same as he did it five minutes ago. &gt;&gt; And anything that God did amongst our our young people, and I I see them. I know their lives. I know what God delivered them from. And I see that they didn't they weren't even looking for God. Exactly as the prophet said, "We're looking for God. We're resisting it." And God came down. &gt;&gt; Just like he took them by the coat and said, "I'm going to change you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many can raise their hands and say, "I have been changed in just the last little while." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know Brother Josh has been changed. He couldn't do it within himself. And I'm rejoicing. I'm thrilled over what God has done amongst the young people and I want to see it continue. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It didn't happen because we had some kind of a system. My wife and I last night just the last thing we we went and saw they had it uh just done up just released the the uh rich young ruler on the DVD and we went and saw it. We were still affected this morning really affected by seeing that. that brought to such reality. I tell you what, no wonder my wife was saying on the way to work, no wonder uh brother Brandham was so urgent when he talked about heaven. Don't miss it and about hell. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't have a a prophet wasting his time on talking about not going there if it wasn't a direct a very definite possibility of going there. There is a hell to shen and there's a heaven to gain. And we want to keep that in mind all the time. Hallelujah. Everything else is just a shell. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be where we don't want to be serving the shell. &gt;&gt; These businesses and all the rest of it, these jobs and and all of the education and everything else that we have around, they'll be a god to us if we don't take it under control. Say, "You're going to serve me. You're going to be my servant. I'm not going to be your servant." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man was not made to serve the system, but rather the system was put in place to serve man's needs. God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth. And every tree in which is the fruit of of a tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for meat." This will be of service to you. You're not going to serve it. It's going to be a service to you. &gt;&gt; And in Genesis 2:16, and the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat." Now everything gets out of cater when man rejects the truth of God's word. And what shall I do with Jesus? He said, "And what?" And that's what happened in Eden. When Eve got out of cater, the whole thing got off balance, you know, we can just bring it down to the individual life. We can do all kind. I would say that the rich young ruler's life was out of cater even though he he it was so obvious and it was so pronounced I will say when it was enacted at the at the camp how that the father and mother were teaching him and brother Brandham says in leadership how he was brought up right. He was brought up to honor the word of God. He was brought up to hear it and the rabbi taught him right and he listened to it. He he had the capacity to hear it and to observe it and he loved it. &gt;&gt; And it was so amazing that after Jesus told him to do the commandments in the scriptures and he was able to say all this have I done from my youth up and Jesus beholding him loved him. I tell you what, somebody who was obedient at home, somebody who was had the best kind of teachers in this in the school. And listen, we talk about school, they the Israelites didn't have a bunch of public schools like we have. Hey, they got a big commotion right now because they want to put on a Christmas play, if you can believe it, that is all that is all homosexually oriented. The Christmas play. And there's a big ruckus right here in this city of Suriri right now because the teachers want to put it on and the school board don't want it put on and the legal system says that you really need to be able to be allowed because it's free speech. If it's free speech and they really uphold it, why can't we go and have a meeting, a Holy Ghost meeting for their Christmas thing then? &gt;&gt; They'll never have that. &gt;&gt; But there's a big uproar because they can't have it. I can tell you what, friends. uh uh they have long long left the spiritual uh principles that the whole nation was based on in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and yet the rich young ruler, he went to a good school. He went to a school like we'd have here in the church. He had he had godly teachers. All of that. But when it came to that one thing, sell all thou hast and give it to the poor. That was the one thing. That was his strong point. That wasn't his weak point. His strong point was he was successful. &gt;&gt; He was good at business. That was his strong point. But that's what he couldn't surrender up. And we have if we have one area of our lives that we hold back from God. Remember the system won't function. &gt;&gt; The system won't function right. If we have an area and you know that God is dealing with that, he's dealing with that. it. Whatever it might be, it might be an attitude, it might be a feeling, it might be something that God calls a person to do, it might be your tithing, it might be your respect for one another, might be relationship, husband or wife. That thing cannot continue &gt;&gt; because then the system begins to break down &gt;&gt; and though what happens it becomes what becomes tragic is that then uh do you stop going to church? No. Do you stop singing? No. We we all do all of that. But all of that I'm saying can become an empty shell &gt;&gt; outside of God being in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we can take some of these things lightly. But on the other hand, Brother Bram says if if we just roar off with a temper like a buzzsaw, says the Holy Spirit will depart. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; You believe what he said? Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He said if we roar off like and just give vent to temper, then the Holy Spirit will go off like a a dove and sit off in a in a branch someplace. So what what do we have? &gt;&gt; We have a shell. &gt;&gt; That's what we have. We have a shell. &gt;&gt; We still we still say praise the Lord. We still say grace at the table. We still pray. We still read our Bible. Maybe read pick up and read a message book and all of those things. But remember without the without him being present the shell is an empty frame. &gt;&gt; It's an empty empty system. All right. I just move forward. When God called his children out of Egypt, there was the system of Egypt. He called him out of that, out of the system of slavery. And we all were there. &gt;&gt; And then he began to establish his people under his system. All of it, all of them didn't adhere to it completely. He describes it. He said, 'I imagine when the children saw those big black wings drop down from the sky like a smoke settling over the city and screams coming from every house and the children might have went to their daddy and said, "Daddy, are you sure that we're under the token?" And he could go to the door and look on upon the post and the lintle and say, "Son, that's according to the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the father is saying? We have the system in place. &gt;&gt; We have everything present. &gt;&gt; And how could he know is because we have done every word. And he says, remember the son saying, I'm your oldest son. I'm your oldest child, daddy. Are you positive? He said, I'm positive. That's according to what the prophet told us. And he has the word of the Lord. And when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. take a lamb for a house. He said, "I've brought all you children in. You're my eldest, my firstborn, and that's the one that's dying all out there. But there is the blood, and that's what thus sayeth the Lord was. So rest, my son, rest at ease because God made the promise." &gt;&gt; He says that son perhaps said, "Well, daddy, why do you got your shoes on? Why do you got the staff in your hand? Why have you got a piece of bread in your hand and a lamb in the other hand? Why are them better herbs and things? What are you eating it? What is the sweat running down your face about? Son, death fixing to strike. And see, it's a time of desperation. He preached token in the morning of desperation and this out of desperation. And and so the son is quering the children quering and especially the eldest son. I'm your eldest son. Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything's hanging on my head. &gt;&gt; And I hear the screams out there. It's real, friends. This isn't a story. This is what happened. I hear the screams. I hear the wailing. I hear the parents and mothers and fathers wailing for their children. The wailing of the separation that death brings. Are you sure that we're protected? The only thing the father could say is, "We have done all that the prophet of God has spoken." Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his only anchor and that was the final piece. That was the piece that was essential. &gt;&gt; That was the piece that was essential. &gt;&gt; And that was the piece that was missing. Wherever he didn't see the blood, they hadn't heard what the prophet of God had spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the system broke up. The system collapsed. The system failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the word and the spoken word the original seed the word was with that anointed prophet because the word of the Lord came to the prophet and now God listen doesn't change his system. &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his system. &gt;&gt; No, he never changed his system. That's still the system. Once God had gathered his people, then he had a holy nation. It was unlike any other nation. They couldn't be like other nations. But yet God spoke through Moses and said, "And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the heathen, whether the Lord shall lead you, and there you shall serve, and there you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone." What is God telling him? You're going to be scattered and you're going to worship the gods of the people and the nations you come into. is prophesying by Moses about that. And of course, what he's telling them is that they will leave the God who brought them out of Egypt. They will leave their God. And he says, "And from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, and thou shalt find him if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul." So he give them this still a a a rider on the end as it were, a promise. Even when you leave, and even when I scatter you, and even when you forsake me, and even when you worship other gods, if you'll turn to me, you will be found. I will be found of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a promise it is for us today. Whatever state a person's in, no matter how far you may have gone, you need to come back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the original place, &gt;&gt; and seek him with all your heart, &gt;&gt; and all your soul, and he will be found of you, and he will be your God, and you'll be his child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is there anything wrong with that? Say, "No, that sounds good to me." &gt;&gt; Perhaps we all were there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. At some point in time, as a nation, a nation to be a nation, they must have a strong monetary system, a military system, have a highway system, a telephone system, social services system, all the systems must have all their parts or they don't function in order to make a nation. In the Philadelphiaian church age, brother Brandham says at the right time, the harlot will destroy the present day money system. At the right time, &gt;&gt; the harlot will destroy will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold. And with no gold, the system fails. Now friends, whether in my lifetime or whether in yours, and we may even be there and not even be aware of it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because if we just have some paper in our pocket and say, "Well, you know, I got some I got I got some money here and it and all it is is is a it's a means to exchange." So this tells me is a dollar US tells me I can buy something that's a dollar US. It's only a a means of exchange. And you know, there can be a means of exchange, but no no substance underneath it. &gt;&gt; And here we are and we're doing things and we're buying things and we're selling things and doing all kinds of uh uh economics and all kinds of transactions and so on. But but the prophet's talking about the gold. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about whether we have bills by millions of dollars floating around the country, but is there any substance in between? And we have lived, most of us here have lived to see economies collapse. They've collapsed in South America. It collapsed in Germany. It collapsed in Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia, they were finally printing money and the p the value of the money was not worth the ink and the paper that it was taking to print the print the piece of paper. I came back here, I think the last time, with around $30 billion. I thought I got enough here to buy the entire city of Vancouver if they'd only listen to me and have any confidence in this money. But the thing was there's nothing behind it. You can print all the zeros you want. Brother Milo and I were kind of having a joke because I said, "There's so many zeros there. I can't even I don't know this figure. I don't know how to read this." He said, "Yeah." He said, "They, but that's with four. They just dropped off four. They just dropped off four zeros." And I was in a farmhouse and there was a couple little girls there about six, seven, eight years old and they had a whole shoe box and and stacked in this shoe box on the edge was just billions and billions and billions of dollars. And they were fooling around with this money. This is all current money. This is money that was circulating in the country. I said to the parents, "How do you live?" Says, "Well, we trade a chicken for some vegetables or back and forth and that's the only way we can live." The money is if you gave them any money, they just make a joke out of it. Joke. Why? Because there's no substance behind it. &gt;&gt; The money was there. Machines were printing it and everybody had it, but there was nothing behind it. So the system collapsed. Brother Brandham says that our economic system is going to collapse because Rome is going to call for gold. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And they've done it already once. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did it already once and shook up the entire gold when when when President de Gaul of France called in all the US paper, had all the US paper and called on the US to buy it all back with gold. Gold then was $35 an ounce. It's never been $35 an ounce since something between 4 and 500. I don't know. I don't keep track of it, but it's it's it's up over $400 an ounce. Has been up over $700 an ounce. And people are making all kinds of, you know, uh making all kinds of predictions about the gold and where it's going to go and so on. I I couldn't care less where it goes. But I know one place is going to go is going to go to Rome. They're going to call it all in &gt;&gt; and they want want to get rid and the pope can have influence on all the Catholic nations and it may not be it may not be the Vatican bank itself but it may well be the other nations which are solely committed to the pope and his leadership and he simply has to initiate the thing and they will do it &gt;&gt; and call it in. &gt;&gt; Amen. God told the people under Moses, and I'm going to move from that up to today in just a moment, but he told them to build a tabernacle. And he said, "Now, uh, you'll build a tabernacle and let them build me a sanctuary." But here is the purpose of it. Let them build me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. In other words, you build a sanctuary and they could have done absolutely everything. every socket and every joint and every pole and every skin and and every every piece of cloth and the the royal blue and all the embroidery and the priests and all their garments and the priesthood could be set up and Aaron and he could have had the base and a blood they could have had absolutely everything. But if God didn't come down amongst them, then the system would collapse. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends, there'd be no mercy. &gt;&gt; There would be no grace. There'd be no forgiveness amongst the people because God needed to be amongst them. And if they hadn't done everything, if they just said, "Well, you know, it's a little too much trouble for us to go and get this kind of wood, this satim wood for the ark. Let's just use something else." &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing, God wouldn't have come down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall it be." So everything had to be in its play place. But the purpose of the tabernacle was so that God could be amongst them. And the scripture says, "And he reared up the court around about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate." So Moses finished the work. So Moses finished the work. Then &gt;&gt; Amen. The cloud covered the tent of the congregation. My brother, my sister, I'm not interested I'm not interested in just having, you know, uh, uh, church as a ceremony. I'm interested in having having it in such a way so that he himself be here amongst us. I'm not interested in having a home or a family or anything else just for the sake of having a home. We want one where God will be honored. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you want to as a as parents, you want to deny the devil any right to to introduce anything other than what God has said in his word. &gt;&gt; And I strive to to live by it. &gt;&gt; We need to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yes. &gt;&gt; But the and the scripture tells us that the he says now the of Paul said in Hebrews 8:1, "Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum. We have such an high priest who is at the right hand of the throne of the majesty of high, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man. For the scripture tells us and teaches us that we you are a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And the prophet brings out clearly from the scriptures that you are each one of you sitting here. You have a holy of holies &gt;&gt; which is right down into the regions of your soul. You have a holy of holies. Every person that sits here, that's how many holy of holies that we have. You as an individual have a holy of holies and God comes to that place. &gt;&gt; These other things, this whole tabernacle and everything that uh related to it only only was indicative of you as an individual and we must never never lose sight of that. We are the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost. As the apostle Paul says, "What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God which are and ye are not your own." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's just here we are a bunch of uh material. What if we were back in Moses' time and we have the poles, we have the rings and we have the sockets and here the ladies have prepared all the all the cloth and the material and the embroider work and we have the garments and so on so forth. No, but we don't have we don't have a prophet to tell us what to do with it. &gt;&gt; Say, well, maybe we should just attach this to that, you know, that looks real nice. Maybe we should I think that would be good for Aaron. No, I don't think that'll look good on Aaron. You know what? You'd have confusion in mass. &gt;&gt; Absolute confusion in mass. And that's why every church is sitting where they are today. It's confusion and mass because they don't know what to do with the pieces. When a word of God come and told them what to do with the pieces that this joint goes to this joint, and this is how this is to be, and this is how this is to be shaped. And when it's done according to his word, then comes it the whole thing comes into an order. &gt;&gt; And down through the church ages, oh friends, I have so much it's hard for me to get to it. But down through the church ages, the Holy Spirit moving. And when God moves in an original way, &gt;&gt; that is the that is the very life of the system. &gt;&gt; And then as time goes on, the people they begin to feel, well, I don't know if that's really so necessary anymore. Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard it. I've heard it. And we sit there and do not bend to the word of God. I tell you, God will leave that. &gt;&gt; God will leave you. &gt;&gt; I hate to say that, but God will leave a person if they resist the word of God &gt;&gt; and they hear it preached and it's anointed and they know it's from God and they sit there anyway. God will leave you &gt;&gt; and you'll still come here. You'll sit in church, but that won't do anything for you. It's living by every word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel it really burning very very heavy on my heart. This is more than just a structure. &gt;&gt; This is this isn't this building means nothing. And the whole group of people. We don't mean anything outside of God being amongst us. &gt;&gt; There's a church has got 30,000 people. They may be able to rejoice in the fact we've been so successful and millions are listening to us on television today. in the fact maybe this is one of the this is one of the larger churches in America at least in in North America uh in in the message I don't take any glory in that without God we're nothing &gt;&gt; say while we hear some powerful sermons all kinds of people hear powerful sermons mighty sermons people are talented and they're gifted speakers and they've got such a a way with their words that doesn't mean anything outside of God being there I'm not interested in just a feeling. I'm not interested in just the anointing itself. Lots of people are anointed, but we got to have God down in the soul of the individual. And they need that prophet's words to put people into place and and to shape us into vessels. We could have had all the all the instruments and all the material, but if we just left it up to the people, what do we do with this? What do we do with the trumpet? Some some excuse me, someone might say, "Oh, I think we should blow the trumpet when we have dinner." Now, he says, "Blow the trumpet for the moving of the camps. Blow the trumpet for war." &gt;&gt; And there was a specific, "How do they know when to blow the trumpet?" Because the prophet told them when to blow the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Somebody might have said, "I know how to blow a trumpet. I know when to play. I know." That had nothing to do with it. It's what he said. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in what people think. We're interested in what he said. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People got all kinds of ideas about how things ought to be. We're not interested in how people think, what people think about how things ought to be. We're interested in what he said it should be. Because then when peace comes to peace. Hallelujah. And pull comes the socket and the banner and the uh all of the material and all of the things that that were and the vessels all put together. Put the table here. &gt;&gt; Put the table there. Put the candlestick here. put these instruments in order. He said on the table &gt;&gt; in order. &gt;&gt; Even Moses didn't have an idea. He couldn't have a thought and say, "Well, you know, Lord, uh why don't we do it this way?" No. When he comes and God speaks, we say, "So be it. So be it. So be it." That's the order that we want. So be it. And then when it's all done according to him and it says when Moses was finished and we're finished, then God comes down amongst us, &gt;&gt; then the system will work. &gt;&gt; Then the thing you crave for, oh God, we want to see men and women delivered. We want to see healings take place. I tell you, the system needs to operate &gt;&gt; in the system. You're part of the system. &gt;&gt; People think, well, things aren't happening in the church the way it ought to happen. Maybe something's wrong with the preacher. Just remember, he's only one piece. &gt;&gt; He's only one piece. And the other piece, you're you're commanded to pray for this peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're commanded to pray for one another. We're commanded to love one another. &gt;&gt; How do you love one another when you don't even come to church? And the word of God commands you to love one another. &gt;&gt; This is not an option. You're commanded to love one another. &gt;&gt; Is this the word of God? Is this the message? &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the scripture and then you want things to happen and to be a in a blissful way maybe in your life or everything be together. Things won't be together in your life because the system breaks down. &gt;&gt; You say what is the system? The one sitting next to you is part of the system. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your wife, your husband's part of the system. Your children, your parents are part of the system. I happen to be part of the system. just a part. Every ministering brother happened to be part of the system. The deacons are part of the system and the trustees are part of the system. But that system without God is just an empty shell. &gt;&gt; Would it stop service if God departs a place? No. No. No. We have all kinds of activity and things going on. We're doing this and we're doing that and we're doing something else. God's not interested. Israel was not a nation like other nations. &gt;&gt; They were a called out people. &gt;&gt; But they started looking elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, they do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, we see all the pomp and all the glamour that these other nations have and they began to desire that." And then, oh, shouldn't we be structured like that? Wouldn't it be nice to be that way? You know, we they have a king. Look at those robes. Oh my goodness. Look at all that. Hey, look at all these marvelous things. They got a lot of glamour. They got a lot of glitz. They got a lot. Oh, shouldn't we have that? I think we should. Let's vote on it. Yeah, we need a king. Samuel, we need a king. You've just smitten. What? What do you want a king for? &gt;&gt; We want to be like other nations. You know, the word of God touches us in our individual life. How we ought to live, how we ought to act, how we ought to dress, how we ought to deal with one another. And then maybe some young man or some young lady looks over over the fence say another church says, "Well, they do it. That has nothing to do with it." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; They do it. &gt;&gt; Since when? You won't find that between Genesis and Revelation. Well, they do it. &gt;&gt; There's another do. What does God say to you down here? &gt;&gt; What What does the word of God say? &gt;&gt; And then when we hear what he says, this is how it's to be. This piece to that piece, this bone to that bone. And then when it's finished, then God steps down into it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And then the system's complete. And it's not complete until then. and and and so Samuel began to tell them trying to watch my time. Samuel began to tell them, "Listen friends, listen children, that's fine. You know, you put the pressure on and we can do it, but God won't be in it." &gt;&gt; He said, "In fact is the system's going to change. He's going to take your young men &gt;&gt; and they're going to be his army &gt;&gt; and he's going to take your young ladies and you're going to be his confectionaries. &gt;&gt; You're going to be doing things for him and he's going to tax you. You're going to pay taxes into the kingdom. Instead of paying tithe to God, you'll be taxes into the kingdom. And this whole system is going to change this whole apparatus. &gt;&gt; And they listen to him. And they said, "We want him anyway. We want our king anyway." That incredible brother Ernie, "We want our king anyway." You know, that is a that's sometime a very difficult thing. Brother Brandham said, and I I I have the quote here, but I don't know if I have it right in front of me. And even though he told them everything, he said, "Sometimes the people still want their way. They just want their way." I pray that God permit us and allow us as a congregation that when we hear what the word of God says on a certain issue, we'll be very quick to respond to it and say, "Lord, here I am." It's not what I think. It's not what somebody else has told me. It's not what I see over the fence, but it's what you've spoken to my own heart. It's what you have given to me right here and I I surrender myself to it. I give myself to it. We say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Cancer. What is cancer? You know, brother Brandham talked about it way back in the 50s. And I don't know what they had really discovered about it then, but he's talked about it being a wild cell. A wild cell. A cell gets out of place and then what happens? The system begins to break down. Now I'm I'm coming to something. So just stay very very alert. So here comes the servant of God. And I could say that we are cells in the kingdom of God. We are cells in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now here comes you got that. &gt;&gt; We are all just visualize yourself. I'm a cell in the body of Christ. Okay. Now, here comes a prophet and he's standing here and there's a let's say there's a man or a woman standing here and they've got a cancer. So now he tells them that cancer is a cell in your body that's gone wild and it's out of place. Okay? And then he begins to relate to them what the angel of the Lord who came to him told him. Nothing will stand before your prayers if you can get the people to believe. Nothing will stand before your prayers, not even cancer. &gt;&gt; So what he's telling him, the angel of the Lord coming to him, telling him, this wild cell that has gone wild within this person's body, nothing will stand before your prayers. In other words, you will call that cell back into its proper place. Amen. &gt;&gt; I give you that authority. If you can just get the people to believe you &gt;&gt; and then if they don't believe this sign, they will believe the next one because I'll cause you to know the very secret of their heart and they'll know it's God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But what is what is God indicating to the people to the people who ought to understand? What is he saying to the people? He's saying to them that here is the here is the servant that I'm giving authority over &gt;&gt; that cell to bring it back into its place and back into order. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now that person may have been healed and never served God, never surrendered themselves to God. I don't know. Maybe it could have just gone back to the church and I don't know anything about them. But God was indicating and this is a powerful thing to me that I want to get across to the church today. When God sends a prophet and if you are a word, you have been sent and you are a word to be manifest in this time and if God then sends a messenger with the word for this season, that word will match to this word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And then when he speaks it, so then when he began to speak, especially in the opening of the word, the revelation of the word and the and the third pull of his ministry began to speak that begin to react &gt;&gt; on the other cells of the body, &gt;&gt; the body of Christ, and begin to pull them together, &gt;&gt; pull them out of maybe the best kind of church or religion that they knew, but began to pull them and began to get them into their place. Hallelujah. and began to put uh joint to joint and bone to bone and socket to socket and began to call a body of Christ together. What for? So that Christ himself can come down in the midst of that body and have the system complete. &gt;&gt; And outside of that, the system is not complete. &gt;&gt; It's not complete. You can have the finest church you can have. You can go under message or reveal truth or whatever more. You got to have But I tell you what, we need an individual personal revelation from God that this message and messenger came to put me into my place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Put my ministry where it should be. Put you in your place as a husband, as a wife, as a brother, a sister in Christ, as a young person. And that's what's happened, young people, in the last few weeks. A bunch of you were not in your place. You were not where God wanted you to have to be. And God just decided, you're not going to stay there any longer. We're coming to the rapture and you have I'm going to act on this and I'm going to move you into your place. And you heard the word of God. You heard the message from the messenger that God sent us. You heard his word. You opened your heart and the Holy Spirit come and took control and began to move you into your place. &gt;&gt; Then God comes down not only into your life. God comes down into the gathering of the people. God comes down in the young people's gatherings. God comes down in the congregation. Are you with me? God comes down and then the system can function. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And not till then. And when he functions, I tell you what, all manner of things takes place. The supernatural, we're not here to discuss, oh, we we don't want the supernatural. Of course, we want the supernatural. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want everything God has. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever he chooses to do, let him come down amongst us and he'll decide what he wants to do. I'm not going to sit here and tell him he can do this, he can do that, he can't do this, can't do that. Let him do whatever he wants to do. &gt;&gt; I look for him to take the take control of an entire meeting &gt;&gt; and let it come under the direct uh control of the Holy Spirit. when God the life comes down and then we're not I'm not here just to serve you in a in in a in a fashion uh just as just as an activity &gt;&gt; while we're debtors to one another. And when you when you give or you stand at the tithe box and give you want to drop that envelope down, you want to know that you're not just giving some continuation to some dead carcass. &gt;&gt; Want to say this is a living cell of God. And I have confidence in the leadership that God has sent. Not not only in the pastor, but a leadership in your own life. I have confidence. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, at church, I've been around a bit. I've been around I've been around the message a whole lot. And you can have all kinds of things. You can have the music all whipped up and you can have you can have all the instruments playing and you can have the song leader, you know, singing. You can have all the volume that just uh blow your eardrums out. That's because we got power through the wires and all the rest of it. But as far as God is concerned, &gt;&gt; are you listening? &gt;&gt; As far as God is concerned, that can be that can be a true worship on one hand, but on the other hand, it can just be a whole lot of emptiness. I want to make myself clear on that. &gt;&gt; You know, I I play an instrument. I play uh uh guitar instrument, but I've I've often said, you know, mine is just a solid block. Just a solid block. There's nothing there unless you get the unless you get the electricity going to it. And that's where I that's where I started thinking about that song that the girls finally sang. They made a little humorous thing out of it. But there'll be no wires in heaven. Right? &gt;&gt; It'll be, you know, God's more interested in your voice. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he wants to know what's inside of you. &gt;&gt; He's more interested in your voice than he isn't interested in in what somebody plays on a on a guitar or a piano or whatever more. And while all of that goes, that's why that's why we talk about these things in this light. He's more interested in what is coming out of your inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I was even in in one church, one place, and the song leader played a guitar and they had all the instruments at piano and organ at least and uh the music was just incredible and and uh uh the volume was more than I could almost bear and the people all clapped their hands, but the song leader was such a wonderful song leader, the people never did sing. They just clap their hands and rejoice and jump around and had a great time. And I thought, "This isn't this isn't what God wants to hear." &gt;&gt; I talked to the pastor and I stood up before the people. I said, "God's not really interested how much volume you can turn up on the on the amplifier or the sound system. That's not what you know, God's not waiting and say, "Oh, I sure hope they turn up the volume this morning. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's not what he's saying. He's saying he's sitting back and just waiting for the incense of the voices of the people. Hallelujah. Hear what comes from the inside &gt;&gt; cuz that tells them the system's working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I have to be honest with you. I I sometimes I've had my times of frustration when maybe the sound in the building or something hasn't been exactly right. Especially we're in special meetings and you know I get I get on the call of brothers call the people in the sound because I don't want the sound system uh to fail us. Especially get a a speaker in uh guest speaker get them all hooked up and all wired up and all the microphones and all the rest of it and all the sound and all the rest of it and he stands up there and doesn't work. Yeah, that that's just a little sound system stands up there and it a great big sound and the amplifier start to blow up and all the rest of it and the speaker is making all kinds of noise and people are frustrated and looking what happened. Well, it's just very simple. The sound system kind of started to fail. It got overloaded. And I asked the brothers, "What happened?" Well, this happened, that happened. It got kind of overloaded and started to kind of burn out and all this that. Okay, I don't understand it, but something happened. The system failed. &gt;&gt; But when I see, you know, when I would see and like I've been there, I don't have it here. But when I see that, you know, all the worship is just only carried by, you know, maybe a song, two or three people and song leader and and uh and you don't hear the people. Oh, I say something's wrong. the other day. Sometimes I look to the uh people playing the instruments and I wonder if they're singing because I like to I like to uh I I was playing with the young people the other night and and I I was singing while I was playing. I was trying to I was trying to sing and I was trying to play and I wasn't making very good job of both. But I while I was singing I thought I hope this catches on with some of the other musicians because I like to see musicians sing too because you know we we play unto the Lord but the scripture also says we sing unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about this for brother Bisl? Because it it it it indicates what's going on inside. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I think I do know about you but I'll just say it that way. and and when uh uh when songs are being sung and praise and worship, even when people get up and sing specials, I have to I have to keep myself from singing along with them. It's it's fine for them to sing, but I want to sing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because it's in here. It's down in here. I want to say it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When somebody says, "Glory to God," and they start to sing, I want to sing along with them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At least I I believe that somehow the system's working. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've never had so many times, excuse for these couple personal things, but I've never had so many times people saying, "Brother Biscll, how old are you? How old are you? I've had it so many times this summer. How old are you?" So, well, I'm 70. 70? My goodness. Oh, you get up there. when I saw you bring your hand down like that. Oh, you know, nobody told me I wasn't supposed to do that. Nobody told me I was not. So, nobody told me I had to act 70. &gt;&gt; So, I might as well just act what I on the inside. Hallelujah. That the system's working. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And I encourage you, we want to we want to do and respond to what the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God. You believe you're a vessel of the Holy Spirit? Amen. &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more minutes and I'm going to be done here. I said a few moments ago, every move of God is original and then man devises a system or an arrangement of parts and soon the sight of the objective, the actual objective is lost and the people begin to serve the system rather than the very life of the system. And there's a system for the home, uh, a system in your job. And I didn't want to get on this, but I think I will just for a moment. And to something that actually has, you know, I guess I could say, pained me in my heart. And I I have I have brought it up before. I've just touched on it, but now in the context of what I'm speaking of now, like to just say, you know, make certain that God is in charge of every area of our lives. Oh, you young people, you may go on to some something further in your life. Uh uh maybe further education. That's a big thing now. further education, you're going to go to college or whatever more. I want you to be sure that the word of God and the spirit of God through the word of God is the one that dictates what you do and where you go and everything everything that concerns your life because I think you need to build it around God because Satan and and and I I I want to have it right balance. I believe that we you go as far as you can go. Study, do whatever God wants you to do. What about what about your job or what about business or just so I get it clear, you know, all these great corporations, all they are is a structure. Whatever it might be, I'll just talk to you now for a few minutes. Whether it be some big retail corporation on the US side, the Canadian side, corporations period, or you work for a certain company and and most of you do. Just remember one thing now a lot of these companies, you know, for example, and I'm only saying this because it's I want you to see clearly what I'm saying. A lot of them are say on the stock exchange. What are these corporations? What is a corporation? A corporation is just a it's a paper structure. That's all it is. It's not even stone. It's not even marble. It's not even gold. It's a paper structure. And it's got a piece of paper says they got so many millions of shares and they're on the market and they're $2 and they're $3 and they're $4 and $5. But down here there's people that's working working for that paper structure. And so the paper structure says, you know, your job is from 8:00 to 5. Okay, fine. Who's told you that? Well, the boss. And the Bible says that we serve our serve our company. You know, we serve our employer with singleness of mind, singless of I, which is fine. We serve him. So now, but all of our activity and then finally, and it's up to you. It's not up to me. It's up to you. But finally a prophet says that Satan is the god of this evil age. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he says education. Now that you've got to take it with a balance, but he says education is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Right? Why is he saying that? Is because Satan works through that system, &gt;&gt; that system, &gt;&gt; and the corporation you work for, it's because the corporation has found you a talented person and they want to stand on top of your shoulders and have you serve them so they can make more. Who are they? It's just a paper structure. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people in it, but they're all doing the same thing you're doing. They're all people just serving. And finally, Satan because he's the god of this thing and he's the god of the monetary system. &gt;&gt; He's the god of this present evil age. &gt;&gt; Every government is of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That won't get me any popularity points, but that's what he said. And so that's why I have to say that. And why is he saying it? Is he saying that we shouldn't have a government? That's not what he's saying. But it's saying clearly that Satan will work through that system. Satan will work through the government system. Satan will work through the econ economic system. Satan will work through the uh through the educational system. Satan will work through it. And you just mark my word and see if he doesn't. What he does is he begins to engineer things so that begins to choke slowly slowly that very life and principles of God and he starts to encroach and starts to put more pressure and starts to twist and it might be with your time with God or your time with your family or your time with the your time for God or your time in the your availability to be in the house of God at your post of duty and it just choke Choke, choke, choke. Slowly, slowly, slowly. Because what he's saying is, you're going to serve me in this system. &gt;&gt; And when you're all done, they'll give you a gold watch. Oh, you're a great bus driver. &gt;&gt; You're a real smart person. You made the company. You made that division go up from, you know, 18% to 23% profit. Oh, heap all kinds of accolades and put all kinds of perks and all the rest of it because you did them so good. You got to make sure what system you're serving. &gt;&gt; That is the system. And what happens is you are you end up help me now as I close. You end up serving some master in the world that is demanding of your time and your energy. and my brother, my sister, I pray that you young people get a hold of this. So you say, I'm not going to expend my youth &gt;&gt; and my my the beauty of my youth and the strength that God has given me. I'm not going to expend it just so that some corporation or some business or something can can uh pride themselves in having get so much further advanced. I say serve your serve your master with singleness of mind and singleness of eye and give him eight hours for his eight hours. Do whatever is necessary but make certain that they don't reach through and encroach on your spiritual life on your spiritual position. Serve God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why even that's why even the apostles, you know, you know, I could engage myself and you could be, you know, just just visiting the sick or marrying the those who want to be married and dedicating the babies and doing all of those things. That is why and a minister can get so occupied. you're just counseling and doing this and doing that and you find out that actually you serve a religious system &gt;&gt; instead of serving the God that's supposed to be in the system. &gt;&gt; I hope that's made some sense to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says I'm going to close with a couple statements here. Brother Brandham says that he he makes a distinction between an organization and an organism. Said we are an organism. An organization is something that is organized a business or administrative concern united and and constructed for a particular end. It's a group of people identified by shared interests of purposes. An organization. But an organism is something that's different. It's a functioning system of interdependent parts that resembles a living creature in structure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what an organism is. It resembles a living structure. It resembles a living creature in structure. We are an organism. &gt;&gt; And he said, furthermore, if anybody says to you, and listen to the church now, I want the church to listen to me. If anybody says to you that you are a denomination or we are a denomination or Cloverdale Bible is a denomination, I'm going to shock you. Do you know what they're saying? You are of the devil. Because brother Brandham says denomination is of the devil. And if anybody, and I defy that, not that I've heard it being said, but if anybody tried to tell you, oh, they're just organization. God is not disorganized. He's not disorganized. the heavens and all the planets and everything else and all the ecosystems the most organized thing you can even imagine. God's not disorganized, but he's not an organization. He puts a system into place and when all the pieces are in place, he comes down into it himself and that's what he did in this hour. There's We talk about a rapture, friends. I have just so much to say I can't get to it all. We talk about a rapture. A rapture could not go into place unless Revelation 10:1 had happened. A revelation couldn't come into place until he descended and and came down and became part of the body which he had created &gt;&gt; because it takes that before the system's complete. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what this that's what he's been doing as far as I'm concerned. That's exactly what he's been doing. But I in this hour we want to be so alert and and I I would say to you, you just take control. Take control of your life. Take control of your home and your family under God. I take control for the glory of God. My home, my family, my life, the church. We're here to glorify God and the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm thrilled this morning that I could make this announcement, &gt;&gt; the free word announcement. &gt;&gt; Amen. This last weekend, we had a brother standing here, a brother Derek Donelsson, a precious brother, and I never knew over the 20 or 25 years that I've known him. We haven't spent that much time together, but I never knew that he came to be the man he is and the minister that he is because he a book fell into his hand, things that are to be. And I can tell you there are people throughout the world who who are craving and there there's something within them that's craving for a word that they haven't heard yet. &gt;&gt; And I pray that God somehow through this means and bless whoever the brothers are that God somehow will get a word get a word and they'll read it on their screen or whatever more something that will change their lives forever. Brother Donson had been through he'd been brought up right. He'd been through Bible school, but he hadn't never heard this. &gt;&gt; And when he heard that out of things that are to be, and I just said this morning to myself, if God can take one message book and make a man who've been out of Bible school hungering for God and transform him into what we heard this last weekend, I say, "Oh, God, there's got to be somebody else out here. There's got to be somebody. send this word with a mighty voice &gt;&gt; and let you and I do everything we can to propagate it and to push it and to get that last because what does the prophet say? We use these phrases friends sometime. I don't think we understand what they mean. And he says, "When the last elected seed &gt;&gt; comes in, we're going home." In the light of my message this morning, what's he saying? When the last one is put in place, when the last one comes in to where they're supposed to be, the system will be complete. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The system will be complete. the body will be complete. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be in there. I want to be part of that by his grace. I don't want to be hanging on the outside. I don't want to be a hitchhiker. I don't want to be in a onlooker. I want to be part of that body. Oh God, hear my prayer even now while I preach. I want to be part of that body. &gt;&gt; And by his grace, I expect to be. I'd say with the Apostle Paul, even after ministering, I wouldn't want to be a cast away. I wouldn't want to just serve the system and just serve the needs of the people and just serve and serve and serve. I tell you what, I want to have God in the midst of this congregation. God in the midst of my life. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; We are not a denomination. &gt;&gt; We are an organism. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're a living creature &gt;&gt; created by God himself &gt;&gt; for his divine purpose and he has come down amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; How happy I am. &gt;&gt; Pray with me. Father, as we respectfully and reverently bow our heads thinking on this great subject, Lord, and what it is you wanted said. And I pray, Father, that the words were fitted to every heart. And you've been speaking to my own heart, Lord. And I say, "Draw me nearer. Draw me nearer." And I believe this is uh also what rings in the true in the hearts of so many here. And I trust all of us. Draw us nearer, God. Whatever it is that you desire to do, whatever kind of a group of people you desire to have, whatever would make you pleased, I pray that you'll move amongst us, Lord. And I pray you'll move out every every hindrance, Lord. I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to be the one I and Lord, I don't want to be one that would hinder you in any way. I pray that you'll come and move amongst us. And there's anything in my own heart, move it out, oh God, take it out from me, Father. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you'll just bring the body of the body of Jesus Christ, this body, this part of it here. Bring us, oh Lord, into such a oneness, a one mind and one spirit, oh God, and one purpose. Let the people see. Father, I pray that you'll give them an understanding of what truly has been in my heart and how I yearn, oh God, to see the word go so far to see it go as quickly as it can. Lord, that the last elected seed may come in. And oh God, I pray that you'll bless your work wherever it might be throughout the earth. and all who put their shoulder to the wheel and all who give and all, oh God, who expend themselves. I pray you'll bless them. And Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, &gt;&gt; you have ordained that you shall have a people. You've ordained that you shall have a family. God of eternity, God of the universe, God and creator of every good thing. I pray that you'll take this congregation, Lord. We're just passing through this way. Just once, just once. We want to, Father, use every ounce of energy and every ounce of strength that you give us that we might serve you, oh God. I pray that you will show each one in their own place, Lord. in their own little realm, their own circle of activity. May they live, oh God. And I ask that each one will, wherever they are, will live such a godly life and you'll be pleased that you'll walk with them and it'll make their the system of their spiritual life complete. And then on that day, Lord, on that day, this afternoon, no doubt, we'll be with different ones and family and friends. They'll take on some nourishment, have some fellowship. But we we would miss today, but we don't want to miss on that day when the marriage supper is called and we come and gather at that table. And the prophet says the king will come out and the tears of joy that will flow down our faces and as we look across the table and see one another. Lord, I I want to be able to look across the table. I I I believe that by predestination, by elective love, you have ordained a place for each one of us to say it. May we make our calling and election sure. I pray, oh God, if there's anything that is un displeasing and unpleasant to you, that we will rid it out of our lives. Bring the Holy Spirit down amongst us, oh God, today in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. Hallelujah. 2119. If you would hear the cries. Let's stand, shall we? Kept you a little long, but I didn't want to go into the subject again. Amen. How many are happy for the word? &gt;&gt; Glory. Hear the cries of the shackle from the onset. of time for the change of defend [Music] [Applause] the cry of the slave. Is there no one worthy to set us free? Then the crying is still as the chorus rings out. The shackle released from their chain and thousands of horses are swelling the song. Worthy the lamb that was made. Worthy worthy, worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. [Music] He's worthy. So worthy, [Music] worthy. The lamb that was slain. All the archangels, the saints of all time, holding the ground in their hands. Fall down before him, joining the song. worthy of the lamb. He's worthy. [Music] So worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. So worthy, [Music] worthy, [Music] worthy. The lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing that first verse again, and I'll tell you why. I was one of those. &gt;&gt; I was one that was shackled. I sat on a log with a prophet sitting no more than 12 inches away. I was so shackled and there I had been shackled for years. I've been shackled by absolute utter confusion. I had heard good men, good preachers, men I love, men I respected and had this thought and some had that thought. God is one and God is two and God is three and you baptize this way and you b How can I go on through life? How can I go on as a minister? How can I go on stand behind a pulpit and not even know who I'm talking about? You talk about shackled. And there's nobody, nobody that I had was able to even be with that could seem to give me an answer for these momentous things. What What would you do if you were in that state this morning? Just tossed to and fro and full of confusion. Wouldn't it be a terrible state to be in? How thankful we are. We have an absolute Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have an absolute friend. &gt;&gt; And I was shackled. And that's why I love this song. I was one of those. And I sat there to You say, "What set you free?" It wasn't some great feeling. It wasn't some great excitement. But when the word started to come out of that mouth, that word came out, one, two, three, four scriptures and my shackles were broken &gt;&gt; forever. That is why I know one person can get just one message book in their hand if they will do it. And and I listened carefully. My heart was so long, so hungry and I so absorbed every word. Do you know the scripture said, "Do you know what is the rain that falls on the just and the unjust? I'm so absorbing. I'm looking right into his eyes." Tell you friends, that's what we need to be.

Dear God, we realize that without you, we are nothing. Oh God, it shows us that we need more of you every day. Father, Lord, let this word that has gone forth find a beding ground into our souls to bring forth, Father, the kind of reaction you desire for it to be. Oh God, we want you to be the centerfold, oh God, of every life that is here. That's the purpose why you have gathered us this morning and directed the word in this way, Father, for us to realize that the system can't work outside of you, the great creator, Father. So we pray that every life will find that portion this morning. Lord, for us, oh God, that are hungry and thirsty, Father, we believe you gave us a promise that we shall be filled. Oh God, we want more of you, Father. And for those who have not experienced this liberating influence, Father, the shackle being broken, oh God, let our word accomplish that this morning, Father, we believe that it has not been sent in vain, but with an express purpose. Oh God, we believe it will send as a guided missile to find the places where it has need in every life today. We ask oh God that your word will have that influence oh God will have that effect that impact their God that it'll be a change a transformation that it'll become oh God a reality for every believer every attentive here that have set to listen this morning. Would you bless them, oh God, that he'll go from the heads into the soul where it can be turned into a living reality? That's our prayer today, oh God. Bless your servant, Father, watching him just giving his best. We pray that you'll renew him this morning. And for the service tonight, we believe that the same God, Father, that has moved among us this morning will come again for a double portion. Father, we expect greater things from you, oh God. We put no limits to what you can do. You're the great the great God of limitless power. So continue to deal with us, Father. Let your word be the meditation of our hearts. Let it as let it not be forgotten, God, but let it be, Father, the center of our fellowship that you will draw closer to us. That's our request, Father. We commit everything to you and we thank you for the day in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, brother DJ. Say God bless you and we'll dismiss you. It's carried a little longer this morning than we really wanted to, but God bless you. I trust you &gt;&gt; that will be anchored in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
