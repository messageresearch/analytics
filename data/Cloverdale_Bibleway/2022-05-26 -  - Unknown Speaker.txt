TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i think of a video clip get a video clip ready brother joe all right if you could just have that queued up it's a testimony that we wanted to share with you some of you are a little bit familiar but i think this will be special for a few of you but since 2019 my wife and i uh sister early and sister elena and myself had miscarriage after miscarriage not very many people really knew about it they were all in the first trimester and uh some early on and so it's it's sometimes just a part of life and so you move on but it kept happening and there's you know we're very blessed to have the son and daughter that we have but there was a desire in our heart you know for another child and um in i believe it was late 2019 or early 2020 she had a miscarriage that was really quite hard on her body and um and so it became kind of a real fearful thing for her and um fast forward now till 2021 and in august late july and august of just last year um we found out she was expecting again and so we're excited but there's that that fear now because now there's been a bit of a pattern for a couple years and she had another miscarriage and lost the baby and this one was was quite severe and there came a point where she finally called her doctor and the doctor said you should go to the emergency room just because of how how much of the hemorrhaging that was taking place and elena was just so weak she's like i don't want to go to the hospital so we had prayer and the lord stopped bleeding and she was out for eight to ten days about ten days she couldn't really do anything and so i was in full-time school working trying to take care of the kids it was a a challenging couple weeks you know and she feels um you know like she's not able to do anything it's very hard for a mother but she was just really weak and really discouraged and there's all the physical things happening as well it was a very challenging time and that took us right up to camp in fact when we came to summer camp it was right out of that and i i had messaged brother michael it's like if i don't seem very excited about all the camped prep it's because i am so tired and like this is where we are and i told brother michael what was going on just so we had a heads up like this is what we've been going through the last couple weeks it was the ten days before camp and uh poor elena was just so tired and and just her body recovering and uh all the emotional side of it as well so we came into camp very tired and uh just you know still trusting the lord but just disappointed again and having this was our fourth or fifth at this point and um at the very end of camp brother wayne lawson this will be special brother louise and sister grace as well at the very end of camp on his sunday morning he proceeds to share a bunch of testimonies i'm sure a number of you remember he told testimony after testimony told the testimony of the sister who was crippled and she came up to give a testimony when she reached for the microphone he said and with these eyes i saw her hand straighten out and then after that the last two testimonies that he shares were about the lord granting children to people who had not been able to have children previously and so i have that testimony clip it's about five or sorry the uh yeah testimony that's about five minutes but i thought it would be important so we're going to share it with you share a little bit of the testimony with you we could cue that up brother right in my house my my son zechariah got married to a lovely young lady named hannah anna carter from brother paula fontaine some of you might know her wasn't long after they were married they decide they want to have a child which would be my first grandchild and i was happy for them my my goal in life is to have a pile of grandkids hanging around the house that's like my ultimate goal seriously so i was so happy to hear the news and then she expected we all was rejoicing lost the baby that was a birthday a little while later they worked up the nerve to try again she got expected lost the baby went to the doctors they said well we're not sure what's really wrong some of our people around here begin to say well there's a there's a lineage that we're from and some of them is not able to bear children because of certain diseases strike their body and they they they're not going to be able to have them so her and zachariah were were in labor wandering praying asking god well about this same season brother erickson had ron spencer to come for our total meetings and it may have been may i don't remember we had him twice that year and in the end of the service we were having a prayer line and and when brother ron started praying he asked me to join him and i come and stood there with him and while we were praying for people all of a sudden zechariah and anna come on my heart and i said lord i want to see him have that baby i want to see him have that baby lord if you just let him come in this prayer line it give me a little comfort and all of a sudden in that same moment zachariah pops up gets anna comes right down there stands into the prayer line brother ron goes to pray for him puts his hand on and begins to pray and steps back and looks at her he said in the name of the lord jesus you'll have that baby that's pretty bold so we rocked around almost a year no baby i went and preached for mother's brother spencer in february the end of february while i was there i was preaching come along and i said i just want to testify to y'all and i'm a grandpa they're like you're a grandpa yeah i'm a grandpa hey it's online if you wanna go listen to it i said i don't have a pregnancy test but i still got some faith and my faith says i'm gonna have a baby i'm gonna have a grandbaby god said i could have it and brother spencer's sitting on the road behind me and you can hear him scream out that's that's saith the lord you're gonna have that baby that's pretty that's pretty bold well he told me later he said well i knew i already seen a vision of it that's well that that explains so time rocked around a little lower and all of a sudden one day i come home and anna and my wife are crying like a couple little kids and i think oh lord what's happened now so i go outside and i walk around and i'm saying lord you promised me that baby you you i don't think them kids could go through another disappointment you promised that baby and i come back in there and they got a little card for me and they hand me the card and i opened it up and it's the pregnancy test it's positive we're about to have a baby listen let me tell you you talk about about rejoicing but wait you know there's nine months there's there's time [Music] so we we wait we wait and finally finally we were able to hold that baby little evelyn god gave us that little baby now we have the picture yeah you have it hey man show me show me the one where brother ron's dedicating her this is there's a woman brother ron's holding her that's zachariah and anna and little evelyn amen ron's dedicating a child that the lord let him have a vision of isn't it powerful isn't that powerful now now the next picture there now she's a little bit older in there ain't she pretty yeah that one wasn't needed but i want to show y'all baby pictures he said by the way what are you doing i'm showing you that this message is real i was preaching in a meeting one time over in david versus and the young man's a pastor now he meant his wife sister stephanie they were sitting in the meeting and i was preaching right along and i was preaching all of a sudden that inspiration comes on me and i point out at sister stephanie and i said listen god change your body if he needs to god changed mary god changed hannah god gave those babies god's able to do whatever to cause something to happen hey man you can have that baby if you can believe it i didn't even know she's praying for a baby ten months later she comes to arkansas walks in the church she said here brother wayne's that baby i said i didn't even know you were wanting to baby she said do you not remember pointing me out and telling me that god would give me the desires of my heart if i could i said no i don't even remember it because see god can speak to a man god can speak to a woman when the speaker don't even know what is being asked for but god remains to be god let me tell you something he's still god amen so you can sit me and see me at the piano sitting there looking really awkward because there's a mess of emotions going on there i'm like this man has no idea what we've just come through so after the meetings were over i tracked him down in the dining hall and i said brother wayne lawson you don't know this but my wife and i just came off of our fourth miscarriage and this was a real hard one and he said anytime i feel led of the lord to share that he said i i know that there's a reason for it but while i was sitting there at the piano i'm not just saying thank you lord this is so timely i just so appreciate it and the holy spirit spoke he said you will have a son and name him samuel and on may 9th hallelujah yes praise the lord thank you lord jesus so may 9th little samuel jaron came he was perfect in every way the doctor says this is as perfect as a baby can be and we're just so blessed and so grateful i just want to share that with you there's been a reason we delayed the baby announcement we wanted to be able to share the back story behind it and just give glory to the lord for what he's done when god speaks things happen amen
