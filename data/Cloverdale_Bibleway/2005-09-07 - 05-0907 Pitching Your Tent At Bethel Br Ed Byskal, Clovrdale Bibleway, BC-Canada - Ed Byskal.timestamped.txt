[3:01] [Music]
[3:05] Oh Lord,
[3:09] come by.
[3:14] Hallelujah.
[3:17] This is what we want to have happen
[3:19] right now. Speak to me, Lord.
[3:22] Speak to me individually, oh God.
[3:25] Tell me the words I need to hear, oh
[3:28] God. Speak words of life and light and
[3:31] deliverance.
[3:33] Blessed be your holy name.
[3:36] Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[3:39] Why don't we all stand? We're going to
[3:41] be turning to the word
[3:44] right away.
[3:48] I failed to bring a request
[3:52] uh earlier. So we will pray for sister
[3:55] Una Featherstone
[3:57] just before we
[3:59] uh minister as well. And her mother is
[4:03] actually uh passing away pretty much at
[4:07] this time. And she's elderly, 89 years
[4:11] old. But of course, she doesn't want to
[4:13] see her suffer. And uh she's also
[4:17] praying concerning her granddaughter who
[4:20] she desires custody of so she can raise
[4:23] her in a spiritual atmosphere
[4:26] and that it's coming up on the 22nd 21st
[4:30] 22nd of this month September
[4:33] and uh we just want to pray that God
[4:36] will give her the strength and the
[4:38] wisdom and the spiritual
[4:42] fortitude.
[4:43] It takes real spiritual endurance these
[4:46] days. And so we're praying for that.
[4:49] Also, Brother Gido from Belgium who uh
[4:55] brother Richard Drake has been working
[4:58] very closely with brother Gido and Men
[5:00] of Vision been sending over a lot of
[5:03] materials and resources to Siberia.
[5:07] Uh and brother Gido has made many many
[5:09] trips to Siberia.
[5:12] I don't in fact say as he just got back
[5:14] once again. He makes several trips a
[5:16] year and he just got back and he called
[5:20] because he will be coming here to visit
[5:23] us uh November the 6th, Sunday, November
[5:27] the 6th. He'll actually be here Friday
[5:29] night. I'm not announcing it just yet,
[5:32] but we may well postpone the Wednesday
[5:34] meeting and put it up to Friday so we
[5:37] can have a couple of uh services with
[5:39] him. I know that you'll be keen to hear
[5:43] and the things that are happening and he
[5:45] has
[5:47] he has not been backward at all to put
[5:49] out on his email mailing which is very
[5:52] very extensive these uh work and the
[5:55] support that men of vision have done.
[5:58] Probably some of them know more about it
[6:00] than we do right here at your own
[6:02] congregation.
[6:04] But uh he said in fact that some of the
[6:07] directors of the orphanages and schools
[6:10] over there had said to him men of vision
[6:14] are the first group that have really
[6:18] stood behind and did what they said they
[6:20] would do. And so we're real thankful for
[6:23] uh brother Richard Drake's devotion and
[6:26] determination to see that uh his portion
[6:29] of this work happens. We're really
[6:32] thankful for that. And we want to be
[6:34] remembering also our brother Madden and
[6:38] his sister's father who's in the
[6:41] hospital. Did they give him a pacemaker
[6:44] today, brother Madden?
[6:46] Tomorrow, tomorrow. Uh they called the
[6:49] family yesterday morning to the hospital
[6:53] early, not knowing whether the father
[6:56] would make it. And uh they they gave him
[6:59] some examination.
[7:01] They thought his arteries were plugged
[7:03] and turned out his arteries were
[7:05] completely clear and so that is really
[7:09] uh a wonderful thing. So they they said
[7:11] they were going to give him a pacemaker
[7:13] cuz his heart is weak.
[7:16] There was a wonderful testimony. I I
[7:18] just said a little bit about uh Benjamin
[7:22] Dertie and is Benjamin here tonight? I
[7:26] imagine he is. But I gave a little bit.
[7:29] Yes. I I just gave a little bit of the
[7:31] testimony of what God did for brother
[7:33] Benjamin
[7:35] and uh a young man met me outside the in
[7:40] the foyer of the church at brother Ron
[7:43] Spencer's. He said that was such a
[7:46] blessing to me. He said uh and I could
[7:49] see that his speech was just just uh
[7:53] slightly tainted, you know, and uh
[7:56] slightly affected. And so he told me, he
[7:59] said, "I was I was away from God. I was
[8:03] running rebellious against God." And uh
[8:07] he said, "I I knew in my heart that I
[8:10] should be serving God. I wanted to, but
[8:12] I couldn't do it. I was just bound. I
[8:14] was just going." You just held bent.
[8:16] That's all. He just held bent. Had a
[8:19] mother and father praying for him. They
[8:21] were standing right there while he was
[8:22] telling the testimony. And he said, "I
[8:24] had an accident." He said in fact is
[8:28] that day I prayed and said God whatever
[8:32] it takes for me to make heaven my home.
[8:36] Whatever it takes do it. And that day he
[8:40] had an accident at a terrific speed on
[8:43] an on a motorcycle and broke over 20
[8:47] bones in his body, including his neck
[8:51] and many other of his bones and
[8:53] shattered his backbone and all the rest
[8:55] of it. He was he was in such a terrible
[8:58] state and he was unconscious and they
[9:01] couldn't they couldn't do nothing for
[9:03] him. And the doctor said to the parents,
[9:06] "We're just going to we're just going to
[9:10] kind of tend to him and sew him up a
[9:12] little bit because we can't do anything.
[9:15] He's just in such a terrible condition.
[9:18] He's he's he he's as good as gone." And
[9:22] uh in about 3 days, he refused to die in
[9:26] 3 days. And when the doctors saw they
[9:29] had five doctors and the finest
[9:32] specialists in the country and all five
[9:34] of those doctors said he'll never live.
[9:37] Brother Joel heard the testimony
[9:41] in three days he still was breathing had
[9:45] not come to and they said
[9:49] he's not dying we better try to do
[9:51] something and they started to work on
[9:54] him and he came out of his coma came out
[9:57] of his coma and he knew that God had
[10:00] dealt with him and he was done with sin
[10:03] he was done with the world and that they
[10:06] said he'll will never work. He'll never
[10:09] survive.
[10:11] His his brain and everything has been
[10:13] damaged. Got three great big blood spots
[10:15] on his brain. And in sight of in sight
[10:18] of just a short period of time, there
[10:20] were just three pinpoints on his brain.
[10:23] And his neck was healed. His whole body
[10:26] is healed. But he still shows signs of
[10:28] it. Still showed just signs of it. And
[10:30] he went, they said, and finally they
[10:32] kept adjusting themselves. They said,
[10:34] "Well, he will never be able to work at
[10:36] least for a year." And he was back
[10:38] working 3 months.
[10:39] [Applause]
[10:45] Amen.
[10:47] So, you know, God's supernatural
[10:50] &gt;&gt; and he's doing these things and we're so
[10:52] happy for it. And I'm just hearing I
[10:55] just want you to know we're not going to
[10:57] we're not going to give up on this easy.
[11:00] I want you to know that I'm getting
[11:02] emails from pastors
[11:05] all over the country from different
[11:07] places that there are people who are
[11:10] either in the camp meeting or somebody
[11:13] has communicated with them and they're
[11:15] hearing what's happening and they're
[11:17] just saying let it break out all over.
[11:20] Amen. It's not for it's not isolated to
[11:23] one place or exclusive to one place.
[11:26] It's for it's for the bride of Jesus
[11:28] Christ.
[11:29] Hallelujah.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once more. Speak to
[11:33] me, Lord.
[11:35] Speak to me,
[11:39] my Lord.
[11:51] Come to me, my Lord.
[11:56] Oh.
[12:00] Oh, God.
[12:05] [Music]
[12:08] My heart.
[12:19] Oh
[12:20] Lord.
[12:28] Lovely Lord Jesus,
[12:30] the reality of your presence is so
[12:34] wonderful. We've been reing in it today.
[12:38] Thanking you for your presence here now
[12:41] tonight. And we're asking, Lord, that
[12:43] you'll just do something special once
[12:47] again. Lord, touch our lives, touch our
[12:51] hearts. Let the wind and breeze of the
[12:54] Holy Spirit blow upon the flame, oh God.
[12:59] Let the flame remain strong and burning,
[13:02] oh God, that others may see it, and that
[13:05] it may catch a fire in someone else's
[13:08] heart. Lord, create a desire, oh God. I
[13:12] pray as we have contact with one another
[13:15] and look upon one another's face, we're
[13:18] so delighted to see the glory of God.
[13:21] Lord, I pray that you will cause me to
[13:23] say the words that need to be said
[13:25] tonight and you'll just convey, oh God,
[13:29] what thought that you would have
[13:31] conveyed. Bless the people, I pray.
[13:34] Lord, may the mighty wave of God just
[13:37] continue to roll us and straight on into
[13:40] the rapture. We pray. We sense it, Lord.
[13:44] We feel it, Lord. We sense that
[13:46] excitement and that move of God. Oh,
[13:50] Holy Spirit, take control. We haven't
[13:52] seen the end of this yet, Lord. Perhaps
[13:55] this is just the beginning of it. Oh,
[13:57] God. Do abundantly above all we could
[13:59] ask or think in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:03] We're praying for Satuna Featherstone,
[14:05] praying for the prayer request that she
[14:07] has made known, oh God, for her mother.
[14:10] Lord, we would pray above all things
[14:12] that the woman would speak to you
[14:14] concerning her soul, Lord, and receive
[14:17] you, oh God. I pray, Father, for her
[14:20] other burdens. I ask that you will meet
[14:22] them and strengthen her, oh God.
[14:25] Strengthen her faith. And may she stand
[14:27] stalwart for the things she knows true.
[14:30] Lord, I pray, oh God, that your service
[14:33] tonight, Lord, will be your service,
[14:36] your word, oh God, and make it known to
[14:39] us, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[14:44] Amen.
[14:45] God bless you. as you take your Bibles,
[14:48] please, and turn to Genesis the uh 12th
[14:52] chapter.
[14:56] And it's just wonderful to see all you
[14:57] young people, these Bibles out. Praise
[15:00] the Lord.
[15:02] What good is a fighting army if they
[15:04] don't have any weapons?
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to have brother Dalton back
[15:11] even though he says he's just here for a
[15:12] few days. Well, we don't know.
[15:17] We're not going to pray for the war to
[15:19] erupt again, but we'll be happy when
[15:22] he's here done his session over there.
[15:25] Amen.
[15:27] Andre and Rickart, because brother
[15:29] Rickart's right in uh Washington DC, so
[15:32] they got to come down and spend the time
[15:34] in the meetings and really really happy.
[15:37] And Nathan was in Florida and he came up
[15:40] and was in the meetings and God's
[15:42] moving. God's working. Hallelujah. All
[15:45] right, we're going to read. Thank you
[15:46] for standing and being patient.
[15:49] Genesis 12. We're starting at verse one.
[15:52] And the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[15:55] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[15:58] kindred, and from thy father's house
[16:01] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[16:04] will make of thee a great nation. I will
[16:07] bless thee, and make thy name great, and
[16:10] thou shalt be a blessing. and I will
[16:13] bless them that bless thee, and curse
[16:15] them that curse thee, and in thee shall
[16:18] all the families of the earth be
[16:20] blessed." So Abram departed, as the Lord
[16:24] had spoken unto him, and Lot went with
[16:26] him, and Abram was 70 and 5 years old
[16:29] when he departed out of Haron. Verse 7.
[16:33] And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and
[16:36] said unto and said, Unto thy seed will I
[16:39] give this land, and there builded he an
[16:43] altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto
[16:45] him. And he removed from thence unto a
[16:48] mountain in the east of Bethl, and
[16:51] pitched his tent, having Bethl on the
[16:54] west, and I on the east. And there he
[16:58] builded an altar unto the Lord and
[17:01] called upon the name of the Lord. Amen.
[17:04] You may be seated.
[17:08] Uh now I'm I'm carrying right on
[17:12] uh with the things that God has been
[17:14] doing. So all the the service is really
[17:19] a continuation from the camp time and
[17:23] prior to the camp time. And I feel that
[17:26] God is what God is doing. We haven't
[17:28] seen uh we haven't seen near of
[17:31] everything that he's that he's doing.
[17:34] And so the services are going to be very
[17:36] very much uh uh pointed in that
[17:39] direction. And Sunday, we're having the
[17:41] Lord's Supper and foot washing because
[17:44] I'm sure that there are some of the
[17:45] young ladies and young men who perhaps
[17:48] have not felt uh at at liberty to take
[17:52] the communion or the Lord's uh Lord's
[17:55] table, footwashing. Uh and perhaps you
[17:58] have, but it will it will mean something
[18:01] entirely different to you this time.
[18:04] It'll be different because we're
[18:05] building on your experience. We're
[18:07] building on what God has already done.
[18:10] And you're going to do it this time. And
[18:12] I want you to be saying even from
[18:14] tonight, Wednesday night forward, I'm
[18:16] I'm just looking forward to that because
[18:19] it will be different for me. I'm in a
[18:21] different status. I'm in a different
[18:24] place now and I'm going to be taking the
[18:26] Lord's communion at uh from the position
[18:29] and from the thing that God has done in
[18:32] my life. Now this evening I want to talk
[18:35] to you about speak to you about and
[18:37] preach if I do get preaching on pitching
[18:40] your tent at Bethl.
[18:43] Bethl the very word Bethl is the house
[18:47] of God. Pitching your tent. And you find
[18:51] in in also in another chapter that
[18:55] Abraham he went back to Bethl. And so I
[19:00] want while we are speaking tonight, I
[19:03] want you that have had uh an
[19:06] extraordinary meeting and God has
[19:08] touched your life. Uh I will tell you
[19:10] that God has touched mine. It doesn't
[19:13] we're not talking about young people.
[19:15] We're all the same age as far as our
[19:17] theophony body is concerned. God has
[19:19] touched my life and I will not only be
[19:23] mindful of what he's doing, I will
[19:25] return. I believe in returning to those
[19:28] places where you met God. Return back to
[19:32] them and re turn back often uh as often
[19:36] as you can. You turn return back to
[19:39] them. Remember what you prayed
[19:42] where God met you. Remember the promises
[19:44] that you made. Remember any vows if you
[19:48] made a vow. Remember the vow. Remember
[19:51] the promise of God. Remember how God
[19:54] touched you. And I'll tell you, the God
[19:55] that touched you, the God that spoke to
[19:58] you, he never changed his mind about
[20:00] that.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; It remains the same tonight as it did at
[20:03] the mightiest moment or the most
[20:05] emotional time you had because the
[20:08] emotion had nothing to do with it. That
[20:09] was only the uh result of what you were
[20:12] feeling inside. Now, the Bible says, and
[20:16] the Lord said to Abram, get thee out. I
[20:20] just want to register that those three
[20:24] words. Get thee out.
[20:28] Get out from thy country and out from
[20:31] thy kindred and out from thy father's
[20:34] house unto a land or unto a place where
[20:37] I will bless you. Now he had to have a
[20:40] physical movement but we may not have
[20:43] you know a geographical movement but
[20:46] there isn't a person there isn't a
[20:48] person who's come to serve God but what
[20:50] God required of them that they get out
[20:55] they get out of the situation they're
[20:57] in. They get out of the relationship
[20:59] they're in. They get out of the company
[21:01] of friends that they're in. They get out
[21:03] of the association and whatever. They
[21:06] get out of the things that they're
[21:07] doing. Get out. Hallelujah.
[21:11] And then God is very, very keen on what
[21:14] your response is. And he loved Abraham's
[21:18] response because Abram responded right
[21:20] away. So he departed. You've heard me
[21:22] say this before. So he departed. I can
[21:25] tell you Jesus talked about two two
[21:27] brothers, two sons, and uh and they were
[21:31] required and asked to do a certain
[21:32] thing. And one said, "I'll do it." But
[21:35] he didn't do it. And the other one said,
[21:37] "No, I'm not going to do it. I'm not
[21:38] going there. I'm not going to camp. I'm
[21:40] not going to pray. I'm not going to the
[21:42] front."
[21:44] But in the end, he did do it.
[21:46] Hallelujah. And they said, "Which one
[21:48] did the father's will?" And I said, "The
[21:51] one that did do it." Even though he
[21:53] said, "I won't do it," he did do it. And
[21:55] we got a whole bunch of people here who
[21:57] said meeting after meeting and year
[21:59] after year, I won't do it. I'm just not
[22:02] going to do it. I don't feel anything.
[22:04] I'm not inclined. I don't hear God, but
[22:07] in the end, you did do it. Hallelujah.
[22:09] And God's pleased with that. And he's
[22:11] pleased with a person doing it quickly,
[22:14] doing it suddenly. It gets the attention
[22:17] of God. It gets God's eye. When a person
[22:21] moves and moves quickly in a positive
[22:24] direction, don't forget that because
[22:26] that's not the first and last time that
[22:28] it ever will happen to you.
[22:31] And when God touches your heart about
[22:34] something, answer it quickly. Do it
[22:36] quickly. Even to such fundamental things
[22:39] as reading your Bible or or you just may
[22:43] feel at a moment, you just feel enter
[22:46] into prayer. Do it.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Do it right then.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; I was in midst of my studies today. I
[22:54] was in the midst of I've been sitting at
[22:56] the uh doing my work all day. Harley
[22:59] just got up a couple of times and and uh
[23:02] I was just reading a certain something I
[23:04] don't know if I will touch on it
[23:06] something that was taking place in the
[23:08] prophet's life and ministry. It was very
[23:11] touching. It was in life story and I
[23:14] just felt the presence of God come and I
[23:17] just didn't want to sit there anymore. I
[23:18] didn't want to I didn't want to talk to
[23:20] anybody. I just got up right away and I
[23:23] just said to my wife, I'm I'm I'm going
[23:25] out for a walk. I just wanted to be
[23:27] alone with God and I just go out just
[23:30] talk to him, walk and talk and he talks
[23:34] back and he lets you know. He lets you
[23:36] know, you know, and he's pleased with
[23:39] that. We want to respond quickly to him.
[23:43] So now God called Abram
[23:47] uh on a journey and I want to talk about
[23:49] this journey tonight because when you
[23:51] pitch a tent, usually you're in a
[23:53] journey. I want to speak about the
[23:55] journey because what a lot of people
[23:59] have been in the baptismal tank of 42
[24:03] now you have started a journey your
[24:06] journey is going to be different and
[24:09] some who have been on the journey for a
[24:12] while we're all at a different you know
[24:14] we have we're in a different position
[24:17] we're at a different uh location perhaps
[24:20] in our journey but we're all on this
[24:22] journey
[24:23] Everybody is on a journey and I know
[24:28] that you have a deep desire within your
[24:31] heart. You want your journey and your
[24:33] pathway to end up in heaven's door.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; And you want to hear, do you not? Well
[24:40] done,
[24:41] &gt;&gt; good and faithful servant. You want to
[24:44] hear that, don't you?
[24:47] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else in the world that
[24:48] even counts. Tell me. Here's the scales.
[24:53] over here. You're there because
[24:57] everybody's going to stand one day.
[25:00] Everybody's going to want to enter one
[25:02] day.
[25:04] And they
[25:06] Well done. Enter in to the glories.
[25:10] Enter in to your reward. Enter in over
[25:14] there on this side of the scale. Is that
[25:17] over here? What are you going to put to
[25:18] offset that, my friends? or some
[25:22] enjoyment or my sports or my talent or
[25:26] something else. So, I'm going to have
[25:27] some fun. You're going to put fun on on
[25:30] a scale with this. There's nothing
[25:33] There's nothing on the side be on the
[25:35] side of that scale. Isn't that right?
[25:37] That's the only thing that counts.
[25:40] There's only one thing that counts and
[25:41] that's it. You want to tell the Lord
[25:43] that that's that's all that counts for
[25:45] you. Amen.
[25:48] So, we're on this journey.
[25:51] Some are further down the road than
[25:53] others, and some are just starting out,
[25:56] but God's God's fundamental
[26:00] uh dealings remains the same. So, I just
[26:04] want to reestablish number one is when
[26:07] he speaks, he wants a clearcut decision.
[26:12] He found the same thing and brother
[26:14] Brandham brought it out in the message
[26:16] thy seed shall possess the gate.
[26:20] Rebecca going to be a part of Isaac and
[26:24] we've heard this many times but when
[26:26] Eleazar went and he wanted to return
[26:29] with her when she was put to the trial
[26:33] brother Brandham said those are his
[26:34] words and when it came to the trial and
[26:38] her trial was will you go that was the
[26:42] trial will you go
[26:45] you know just stepping back a moment to
[26:49] when so many so many times when it comes
[26:54] to that that moment of surrender. Oh,
[26:58] that's a tough one. I tell you what,
[27:00] there's a supreme trial because I think
[27:02] every devil in hell is against a person
[27:06] yielding or surrendering to God's will.
[27:09] And it doesn't matter. We can be way
[27:10] down the road. It doesn't it makes no
[27:13] difference how long you have been
[27:15] serving God or when it was you gave your
[27:18] life to Christ and how much you know
[27:21] about the message. I can assure you when
[27:23] some comes in something uh uh something
[27:27] comes into your life and uh and and God
[27:29] is telling you lay it down.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Just forget it. Lay it down. Uh leave
[27:36] that.
[27:38] you'll go through the trial
[27:39] &gt;&gt; just when you're going to do it and then
[27:42] all hell just comes against that.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; And so she said,
[27:49] "Will you go with this stranger or will
[27:52] you stay with us?" He said her decision
[27:56] was quickly made clearcut
[27:59] and that's the way God likes it. And I
[28:02] don't want you to ever forget it. He
[28:04] doesn't like any other waffling around
[28:07] and you know weighing it out and
[28:09] reasoning it out. A clear-cut decision.
[28:12] Now some people are they are seem to be
[28:15] made up. They're physically made up. So
[28:18] a clear-cut decision comes easier for
[28:21] them. And uh I'm not that way. I'm one
[28:24] that I weigh everything out way back and
[28:27] think about it and so on so forth.
[28:28] Brother Vince said that was because I
[28:30] was born under that kind of a sign.
[28:33] I don't know. He was the first one to
[28:34] ever say that you're, you know, you're
[28:36] born under a certain sign, born at a
[28:38] certain time. And I'm in that I'm in
[28:40] that. I weigh it all out. Weigh it out.
[28:42] Weigh it out. Don't tell anybody, but I
[28:43] just weigh it out and weigh it out and
[28:44] think it out. Think it out till it till
[28:46] it's just a bunch of fine powder and
[28:47] scraps. And finally then I have a
[28:49] decision. So, okay, let let's do this.
[28:53] But, you know, you you get tired of it.
[28:56] Get tired of it. And you know the
[28:59] trouble? You know what the problem with
[29:00] that is? Quite often it's between 2 and
[29:03] 3 and 4:00 in the morning.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And that's just terrible. I try to say
[29:08] it. David spoke to his soul. I speak to
[29:12] my mind.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Shut down
[29:16] &gt;&gt; and go to sleep.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; This is nighttime and this is when
[29:21] you're supposed to be resting. How many
[29:22] others here have that problem? Oh my,
[29:25] what a bunch of friends I have. Well,
[29:27] God bless you all. And may tonight your
[29:30] mind shut down and may you have the rest
[29:32] of the uh of a babe is my prayer. I know
[29:36] what that's all about. But you're there
[29:38] weighing it out, weighing it out,
[29:39] weighing it out. And I don't know
[29:41] whether it does any benefit. But
[29:42] sometimes I try to satisfy myself that I
[29:44] sorted things out at night and in the
[29:46] morning even though I'm still uh uh you
[29:49] know only half there, I figure got it
[29:51] figured out at least.
[29:55] Will you go out into uncharted waters?
[29:57] See, now I can tell you for those of you
[30:01] that have you you made a real surrender
[30:04] to God and you determined my life by
[30:09] God's grace shall be different from this
[30:12] moment on. You don't know how different
[30:15] and you don't know what those waters
[30:17] are. They're uncharted for you. But God
[30:21] knows exactly where he's leading you and
[30:24] where he's directing you. And this is
[30:26] what's important because even if a
[30:29] person chooses not to walk in God's way,
[30:32] even if you choose not to walk a
[30:35] surrendered life, you still you still
[30:37] the future is still unknown.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; There's nobody that knows what their
[30:40] future is. Nobody.
[30:45] In Kinsman Redeemer, he was brother
[30:47] Brandon was speaking about Ruth. He
[30:49] said, "Oh, what a clearcut decision for
[30:52] a believer. What the Bible says, I'll do
[30:56] it. So, he's not talking about Ruth now.
[30:58] He's talking about a believer. You're a
[31:00] believer.
[31:01] What the Bible says, I'll do it. Repent
[31:04] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[31:06] Christ. I'll do it.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; 42 said, "I'll do it."
[31:12] &gt;&gt; I doubt if there's any of the 42 that
[31:14] regret that they said, "I'll do it."
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Ruth never regretted, "I'll do it."
[31:20] Rebecca never regretted saying, "I'll
[31:22] go."
[31:24] &gt;&gt; And you will never regret saying, "I'll
[31:26] give my all to Jesus Christ." You'll
[31:29] never regret that. I've stood by the
[31:31] bedside of quite a few people that have
[31:34] been dying. I have never stood by a
[31:37] believer who ever even gave a twins,
[31:40] they regretted serving Christ.
[31:43] They're so happy they gave their life to
[31:45] Christ. If anything, I wish I'd started
[31:47] earlier. I wish I'd started as a young
[31:50] person. Isn't that so?
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; That's exactly so. I'll do it. Go ye
[31:58] into all the world and preach the
[32:01] gospel. He said, I'll do it.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; And I feel that that is, you know, what
[32:07] God is doing now, friends, believe me,
[32:09] is not ending here by people coming and
[32:12] just sitting at church. This testimony
[32:14] is not merely going to echo out, but I
[32:17] look for some of these young men and
[32:19] young women to make known what God has
[32:22] done in their lives.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; And be a witness.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Says, "Go ye into all the world and
[32:30] preach the gospel." What's the response?
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; I'll do it.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; I'll do it. Not I'll just think about
[32:38] it, but I'll do it.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When? Tomorrow morning. When
[32:43] you're speaking to somebody, say it and
[32:45] let them know what what what your uh
[32:49] what your testimony is.
[32:52] He says Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[32:55] today, and forever. Whatever it says for
[32:57] me to do, I'll do it.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "And the church is taking its
[33:03] orders from the word."
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The church is taking its
[33:08] orders from the word,
[33:10] &gt;&gt; not from any man.
[33:13] or any other person. And so the
[33:16] scripture says, and I thought this was
[33:17] very interesting. The scripture says,
[33:20] "Get thee out." And I just want to stop
[33:22] on the word get because I found it very,
[33:24] very interesting. Says, "Get thee out."
[33:28] And the Hebrew for get is to go,
[33:34] to walk, or perhaps even to come. But
[33:38] it's more than that. Get is to live to
[33:41] have life. Get it. That's what God when
[33:45] God simply said get to Abraham in God's
[33:49] mind he had walk you'll walk with me.
[33:53] You'll live you'll be blessed. And
[33:55] that's why he went on and described it
[33:57] further on.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; It's a matter of life. And so I want to
[34:02] say to all that that were moved upon
[34:06] during these last few weeks, everything
[34:10] that you felt in your heart, God talking
[34:14] to you, God moving upon you, I want you
[34:17] to know that God's intention with that,
[34:20] even though you may have said just a few
[34:21] words, even though you may have just
[34:23] felt, I need to surrender. I need to I I
[34:25] need to I need to turn aside. I need to
[34:27] stop resisting. I need to or whatever it
[34:30] is, whatever it was he was speaking and
[34:32] and you were and you just gave yourself
[34:34] and surrendered to that. But in God's
[34:36] mind, he has a he has a basket full of
[34:40] blessing.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; He has a lot more in his mind to pour
[34:44] out because you do that. He I'm going to
[34:47] bless you.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you. He can bless
[34:51] you. We're not We're not just thinking
[34:52] of material things. We're think
[34:54] blessing. People today, they do
[34:57] everything in the world to try to be
[34:59] happy.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be just marvelous if you
[35:02] knew tonight, and I'm telling you
[35:04] tonight, on the authority of God's word,
[35:06] when you acted as a res as a response to
[35:10] his call to you, he's so pleased with
[35:13] that. I'm going to bless them. That
[35:15] pleased me. I'm going to bless them.
[35:17] Hallelujah.
[35:23] Jesus said, and he said to them, "If any
[35:27] man," notice now the same thing going
[35:29] from the Old Testament to the New, "if
[35:31] any man will come, if will come after
[35:35] me, let him deny himself, take up his
[35:39] cross daily, and follow me." And there's
[35:42] just four words that you need to
[35:44] remember. Come deny, take and follow.
[35:50] Come deny, take and follow. Come after
[35:55] me. Deny yourself and take up his cross
[35:59] daily and follow me.
[36:03] Now, God always prepares
[36:07] the people for the events that are about
[36:11] to happen.
[36:12] Now, I'm I'm talking to you some very
[36:14] deep things that are on my heart. When I
[36:17] see God do something sovereign, there
[36:20] isn't a person in this congregation that
[36:24] that were able to manipulate or generate
[36:28] or do what God did.
[36:32] See, you can be a little quiet tonight.
[36:34] That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean
[36:35] anything to me. I know what God did,
[36:38] &gt;&gt; and I know that that was sovereign God.
[36:41] And I saw lives that completely changed.
[36:45] And will everybody remain that way?
[36:46] That's God's business. As far as I'm
[36:48] concerned, not only everybody can remain
[36:51] that way, but you can add a whole lot
[36:52] more to the Lord.
[36:55] This thing's not over. This thing's just
[36:58] starting. Hallelujah. It's just
[37:00] starting. And what I want to what I want
[37:03] to announce to you tonight is God have
[37:06] something further in his mind. when he
[37:09] did this act, he's preparing us for
[37:12] another event.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; And that event may well be the rapture.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; It may well be the rapture.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And you, the results of what's happening
[37:25] here may well be God saying, "I must
[37:28] answer the prayers of these uh bride
[37:31] people, these believers, these mothers,
[37:34] these fathers that have prayed because
[37:37] there's a great event coming." And I
[37:39] must bring them in.
[37:41] [Music]
[37:43] &gt;&gt; I must bring them in. I can't leave them
[37:45] out there. I can't leave them bound. I
[37:48] can't leave them in sin. I can't leave
[37:50] them under the power of Satan. I must
[37:53] bring them out
[37:55] &gt;&gt; because there's another event happening.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Listen now to this principle. How
[38:02] wonderful and simple. And this is in the
[38:04] message preparation. Because if you're
[38:07] going to go on a journey, you've got to
[38:09] prepare for that journey. There's only a
[38:13] certain amount that you can do. But God
[38:15] has made preparation for you in this
[38:18] journey. But you also have to make
[38:20] preparation.
[38:22] And in the message preparation,
[38:25] he talked to a mother laying in a
[38:27] stretcher because this was a healing
[38:30] line. And now mother you here in the
[38:32] stretcher and this dear loving person
[38:35] mother here and here and all around
[38:37] there are all kinds of people there. He
[38:40] says I I want to do tonight by God's
[38:42] help if he will let me is to speak his
[38:44] word to you that'll prepare your heart
[38:48] for a healing service. Now those people
[38:52] it was no secret they were sick.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; It was no secret that the woman on the
[38:57] stretcher perhaps was dying. That wasn't
[38:59] a mystery. There they were. But now a
[39:03] prophet is saying, "I want to and will
[39:05] God help me. I want to be able to speak.
[39:08] I want to be able and he wanted that
[39:10] service to prepare their heart for a
[39:13] healing."
[39:14] &gt;&gt; That was preparation for an event.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; And if and if you can prepare for a
[39:20] healing, how much more can we prepare
[39:23] for the rapture?
[39:25] How much more can we prepare for
[39:28] whatever God has? We don't know, but God
[39:31] has things in his mind. And I say he's
[39:34] got things in store for this church.
[39:36] He's got things in store for the bride.
[39:39] And even the testimony, you know,
[39:41] sometimes it has to break out one place.
[39:43] And I don't know, I'd be thankful to God
[39:45] if it was his choosing that it broke out
[39:47] here,
[39:48] &gt;&gt; that something broke out. And you young
[39:50] people, what happened to you? It spreads
[39:53] and someone else's heart is ignited and
[39:56] they say, "I heard my friend back in
[39:58] Cloverdale. I heard what happened. I
[40:01] heard that Wesley was baptized the other
[40:03] night. That blessed me the other day,
[40:05] Wes, when I heard that you were
[40:07] baptized. I'm missing all these
[40:09] wonderful things."
[40:13] You folks here don't know it. And when
[40:15] my wife and I just decided right after
[40:17] camp we just would need three four days
[40:19] to catch our breath and we just drove up
[40:22] the canyon up over here hope just up the
[40:24] canyon little ways and decided to pull
[40:26] in. We have a a hamburger or something
[40:29] and we just pulled in. We just just left
[40:32] home like 2 and 1/2 hours ago or
[40:34] something and we're just walking
[40:36] walking past just one vehicle in front
[40:38] of us and I hear brother Ed
[40:44] thought can I get away from it anywhere
[40:48] and I turned around there was Wesley
[40:51] Calder sitting in the truck he and his
[40:53] dad were going up country and so happy
[40:57] to hear and the next time you're in the
[41:00] tank
[41:01] Praise the Lord. I'm talking now to you
[41:03] people. I'm talking to you fellas. Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; You just don't even know what's in my
[41:10] heart. But he's preparing you. That
[41:12] wasn't just, oh, you know, I heard God
[41:14] speak and I answered and I said yes and
[41:16] I went and I was baptized and so on and
[41:18] we had some exciting services and had
[41:20] some long services. That's just the
[41:22] beginning. That's just the beginning.
[41:25] Like I said to you, like I said to you
[41:27] the last Sunday I was here, this is
[41:29] exactly what happened at Cloverdale
[41:31] Bible Way House about 33 years ago. It
[41:34] just started to sweep and they came and
[41:36] there was just eight and then there was
[41:37] 10 and then there was 15. And finally
[41:40] they were sitting up the stairs and
[41:41] there was no place for them to sit and
[41:43] when the meeting was over they didn't
[41:45] have any interest in going home because
[41:47] all they wanted to talk about is what
[41:48] God had done or what he was just going
[41:50] to do or who they were praying for. and
[41:53] then they spill out into the street and
[41:55] uh and uh and and witness to somebody
[41:58] else.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll's really taken up now
[42:01] with a whole lot of other things. I went
[42:03] out on the streets many times and went
[42:05] out to little places where uh some of
[42:07] the young people were meeting and I
[42:10] talked to them and looked at them in the
[42:11] face and oh, they were so lost some of
[42:14] them, but God saved some.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And are still
[42:20] here.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John Alexander, one of
[42:24] your deacons. He's one one of the first
[42:26] brothers to come. No wonder he can sing,
[42:30] you know, a song about the little Bible
[42:32] way house. Hallelujah.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; I say, praise the Lord.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; And he's not alone now.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And his wife soon came and someone else
[42:44] came. Praise the Lord.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it works, friends.
[42:50] And God has something in his mind and he
[42:52] was preparing these people for for a
[42:56] healing. Listen now when he just
[42:59] continued on a little bit. He said
[43:02] before we go and fight a war first we
[43:04] have to prepare for that war. If you're
[43:07] going to get married you have to prepare
[43:09] for that time. And you have
[43:12] preparations. And before you come to
[43:14] church you made preparations.
[43:17] An ambulance. You're talking to sick an
[43:19] ambulance to bring you or your loved one
[43:21] to bring you and you had to go to a
[43:24] certain amount of money and be ready for
[43:26] you to come that you can come.
[43:28] preparations and God always prepares the
[43:32] people for the events that's just about
[43:35] to happen and I don't know what's just
[43:39] about to happen but I can assure you
[43:42] that what God has done and I want you to
[43:44] get fully into anticipation and say oh
[43:47] God do with me whatever you desire to do
[43:52] what let me be in the right place let me
[43:55] have the right attitude let me think the
[43:57] right thoughts
[43:58] Let me say the right words. Don't let me
[44:01] Don't let me be a millstone around
[44:03] anybody's neck. Let me be right in tune
[44:06] with what you're doing. Oh God,
[44:09] can the congregation say amen to that?
[44:13] Nothing is impossible with God. You
[44:16] believe that? Nothing is impossible with
[44:20] God. Thus sayith the word of God. I
[44:23] don't care how impossible it looks.
[44:25] Nothing is impossible with God.
[44:28] Hallelujah. So, you want to believe for
[44:30] the impossible? I don't know what it is
[44:33] that God has in his mind. I'm just a
[44:35] little puny insignificant human and we
[44:38] don't know what God has in his mind. But
[44:41] God has something in his mind.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't do this just for, you know,
[44:46] entertainment.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And I have too many things that are
[44:51] powerful indicators because God started
[44:53] this wasn't a camp thing. This wasn't
[44:55] some excitement at camp. This is
[44:57] something that started long before camp,
[44:59] weeks before camp, even before you knew
[45:01] it. God was already moving you. God was
[45:04] already tenderizing your heart. God was
[45:06] already speaking to you in the rapture
[45:08] series. I knew that God was speaking to
[45:10] you.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; More certain than you're sitting here
[45:16] tonight, more sure is that eternal
[45:19] realm. More real is it just beyond your
[45:22] eyesight. Your eyesight, your physical
[45:25] eyesight can fool you. Your physical
[45:28] hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear
[45:28] ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear
[45:28] hear ear hearing hearing can fool you
[45:30] but I tell you that eternal realm is
[45:33] absolutely precision.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; And that is I felt so compelled tonight
[45:42] to say to you one thing is certain God
[45:46] is preparing you for something.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Let it be Lord. Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Let it be me.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Let me be right in the middle of it.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:11] Brother Brand was talking to a man. This
[46:13] really moved me.
[46:16] Well, dear brother,
[46:19] you are suffering.
[46:24] I could have said a few weeks ago,
[46:27] dear young man, dear young woman, you
[46:30] are suffering. You're suffering with a
[46:32] tortured mind. You've wrestled back and
[46:35] forth. You've debated back and forth.
[46:39] You've weighed things out and God is
[46:41] strimming with you and you have resisted
[46:43] it and and so on. times not only for
[46:45] young people but all of us we go through
[46:48] those times and this poor man and he was
[46:51] so nervous he said you're awfully
[46:53] nervous and it's caused his nervousness
[46:57] was not something mental but it was
[46:59] something physical said you have a
[47:02] prostate trouble now I want you to catch
[47:04] the principle here
[47:06] and you have a weakness in the kidneys
[47:09] also
[47:10] and I see a doctor before you and you're
[47:13] you've just been examined and I believe
[47:16] you're up for an operation. Isn't that
[47:19] right? And you're figuring on an
[47:20] operation right away. Listen to this.
[47:23] Listen to this marvelous thing that
[47:25] happened. He said, "I feel though
[47:30] you've made preparations for something."
[47:36] And I felt to say that to all of you
[47:39] here this evening. you've made pre
[47:42] preparations for something because
[47:44] you've made the same preparations this
[47:47] man did. And he said, "You've just been
[47:50] saved, too.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Just converted."
[47:56] &gt;&gt; That be marvelous.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm here tonight and I'm going to
[48:00] stand in brother Brandhamstead and say
[48:02] to you,
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God
[48:06] &gt;&gt; that was there is here tonight at this
[48:10] platform. the same God, not one bit
[48:12] different. Now I and I see that you've
[48:16] made preparations and you made
[48:18] preparations to be converted, to be
[48:20] saved and give your life to Christ. You
[48:23] made that preparation.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he said, it's been
[48:28] recently. Listen to this. It's been
[48:31] recently because you had on the same
[48:33] suit of clothes.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Here he is, a prophet seeing him having
[48:38] just given his life to Christ. You've
[48:40] just been converted. It's just been
[48:42] recently because you're wearing the same
[48:44] suit.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; You think God doesn't know us?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And then and then wow, it just gets
[48:52] better. Oh, it just gets better, friend.
[48:55] He said, you're wearing the same suit.
[48:57] Isn't that right? He said, don't you
[48:59] fear. And I say to you, don't you fear.
[49:02] Don't you fear about the future. Don't
[49:04] you fear about uh the college or the
[49:06] school or whatever. Don't you fear about
[49:08] your job or about your work. He said, he
[49:11] said, don't you worry about it because
[49:13] Jesus Christ, the son of God, has made
[49:16] preparation for you with his blessings.
[49:20] Amen.
[49:22] You made preparations for him.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; You made preparations.
[49:27] You prepared your heart. You listened.
[49:30] You respected. And you heard the word of
[49:33] God. And now because of that, God has
[49:36] made preparations for you.
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You made preparations.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Oh God, what grace is this?
[49:49] What little thing I could do and you've
[49:51] made preparations for me,
[49:54] &gt;&gt; how blessed,
[49:56] &gt;&gt; how wonderful it is. And there is no way
[50:00] for you or I to be able to even begin to
[50:04] explore or understand
[50:07] what God has prepared for his children.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; He loves you with a never dying love.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:18] I love that Jesus has made preparations
[50:21] for you.
[50:23] I wonder what is taking place and what
[50:26] it is that he's prepared
[50:30] on a journey.
[50:32] It's a tragic thing if you're
[50:34] illprepared.
[50:38] It's no surprise and most people have
[50:40] been quite caught up in the news of the
[50:42] recent days and the hundreds and tens of
[50:46] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[50:47] people that have been left in such an
[50:50] awful awful state.
[50:52] I heard brother Tom, I guess it was from
[50:55] brother Tim about the family in Bloxy,
[50:59] isn't it? Yeah. A family of believers in
[51:03] Baloxy.
[51:05] And if you had seen any pictures, that
[51:08] town was leveled. I believe it had 7,500
[51:12] people.
[51:14] There's a a family of believers
[51:17] and their house is completely untouched
[51:22] and everything around it is absolute
[51:24] desolation.
[51:27] Hallelujah.
[51:28] Glory.
[51:31] Praise the Lord.
[51:33] I'm God. He's the same God. Hallelujah.
[51:39] He's doing the same thing today
[51:42] that he done in say how did that happen?
[51:45] That question doesn't even come to my
[51:46] mind. I don't care how it happened. The
[51:49] thing is it happened.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It happened. The same God
[51:54] just a few days ago. And the people are
[51:56] left in such desolation and datitude and
[51:59] they and and the whole uproar now is
[52:01] because they've been saying they're
[52:03] illprepared. They're not ready. They
[52:06] They couldn't respond.
[52:08] See, Homeland Security and FEMA and all
[52:11] the people were supposed to be ready.
[52:13] They weren't ready. They said at least
[52:15] they weren't ready. I'm not anybody's
[52:17] judge.
[52:19] I think they were working under very,
[52:20] very difficult, very, very difficult
[52:23] conditions. But it's getting more
[52:26] difficult all the time. Now comes body
[52:28] counting time. It's just tragic. 10,000
[52:32] people still don't want to leave, but
[52:34] they don't have there's no preparations.
[52:36] They're telling it's going to be masked.
[52:38] I heard a reporter and he said the whole
[52:41] city of New Orleans is literally being
[52:43] poached in a toxic waste chemical and
[52:49] sewage and dead animals and bodies and
[52:53] rats and snakes and whatever more. And a
[52:55] lot of people don't want to leave, but
[52:57] those people are still there. And a lot
[52:59] of people, I mean, there's no schools
[53:01] and there's no jobs and they don't even
[53:03] have families. Like one man said, and he
[53:06] speaks for tens of thousands. He said,
[53:07] "I don't even have an identity. I don't
[53:10] have an address anymore. I don't have an
[53:12] address." For the first time, I don't
[53:14] have an address. It's gone.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; People are in an incredible state. I'll
[53:21] tell you something, friends, that didn't
[53:23] escape God's eye. God knew what was
[53:26] happening. And furthermore, he knows why
[53:28] it was happening. And I can assure you,
[53:32] it's not the last. This world is in for
[53:36] a very dismal time. And the scripture
[53:39] tells us clearly, things shall wax worse
[53:42] and worse.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I have seen in my lifetime a
[53:48] deterioration of the quality of life.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It's not better. Not at all better.
[53:54] People are teed up. They're right up at
[53:56] the very breaking point. It's not a
[53:59] better quality of life. It's a lesser
[54:01] quality of life. You young people had a
[54:02] lesser quality of life than I did as a
[54:04] young person. Oh, you say, "Did you have
[54:06] the quads and you have all this?" No, I
[54:08] didn't need them.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; I was happy without it. I see all kinds
[54:12] of people have toys today, but they're
[54:14] not happy. They got every gimmick and
[54:16] everything else, but they're not happy.
[54:18] I was happier in an old house than a lot
[54:21] of people are. I can just go my way and
[54:24] I didn't have to worry. We never locked
[54:26] our doors. We live in a city of 6 8,000
[54:28] people. We never even thought I thought
[54:30] people were nuts if they locked their
[54:31] doors.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; What do you lock your door for? Nobody's
[54:34] going to steal anything.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Today, you know, punch the alarm. Even
[54:41] you just go out for coffee, punch the
[54:44] alarm. You don't know when they're going
[54:45] to come and take all the stuff out.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[54:52] We ought to have the policeman at least
[54:53] say amen. There he said amen.
[55:00] It's true.
[55:10] You will need the right kind of
[55:11] equipment
[55:13] and the right kind of equipment is lot
[55:15] lot more than just coming say to the
[55:17] house of God. And I have found as time
[55:20] has gone on just in this meeting we were
[55:23] in I don't know how many people were
[55:26] there possibly 300 at brother Spencer's
[55:29] church and quite a few visitors and I
[55:31] asked because I was relating some things
[55:34] that I had experienced with brother
[55:37] Brandham and I asked how many people
[55:38] here have been in a meeting
[55:41] you've been in one of brother Brandham's
[55:42] meetings there were seven hands
[55:45] including my wife and myself and I that
[55:48] It was a shock to me. Seven hands that
[55:51] have seen with their eyes. And I begin
[55:54] to tell them just a few things of things
[55:56] that I saw with my eyes that I saw
[55:58] happen. I told him what the blind girl
[56:00] saw with my eyes. I saw the nature of a
[56:03] horse changed instantly. an animal, his
[56:06] hor he's trying to kill a man in one
[56:09] moment and a been destructive
[56:13] and and frightening
[56:16] powerful horse trying to kill a man one
[56:19] moment and inside of I would say inside
[56:22] of two minutes he become a kitten. And
[56:25] when I turned around, Brother Brandon
[56:27] was just putting his hat back on his
[56:28] head, he just finished praying. And that
[56:30] horse remained a kitten from that day
[56:32] on. and we packed him and did absolutely
[56:35] everything with him and he was like
[56:37] another animal. I saw that with my eyes.
[56:40] I lived with that for a number of days.
[56:42] I can tell you God has control of the
[56:44] animals. God has control of everything.
[56:47] We still have the word nothing shall be
[56:49] impossible with God. If you believe
[56:52] nothing is impossible with God, that's
[56:55] our God. We've got to shake off this
[56:58] lethargy from this age that we're in and
[57:01] and and confess what it is that we
[57:03] believe. I want you to confess it openly
[57:06] with your mouth. I believe that.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And how long do I confess
[57:10] it? Confess it until you're certain you
[57:13] do believe it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] Put on the whole armor of God
[57:22] that you may be able to stand against
[57:26] the ws of the devil.
[57:30] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[57:32] blood, but against principalities and
[57:35] powers. You may not feel it. You're
[57:38] sitting here on a soft seat tonight, but
[57:40] I can assure you, you wrestle against
[57:43] principalities and powers. And Satan's
[57:46] going to do everything he can to move
[57:48] you off your testimony. He's going to do
[57:50] everything he can to rob you of the
[57:52] blessedness of the things that you've
[57:54] experienced in Christ. And when you feel
[57:56] that sleuth come around, you say, "You
[57:59] have no right. You have no right in my
[58:02] yard. And you have no right in this
[58:04] vessel." And I can assure you, I will
[58:07] give you no room. I will assure you that
[58:10] I will use my sword on you in the name
[58:13] of Jesus Christ. You have no place in my
[58:17] heart and no place in my life. And you
[58:20] shall not control my emotions. You shall
[58:23] not control my actions. And you have no
[58:26] place in giving in in in giving any
[58:28] words to my ears because I'm not going
[58:30] to think about them.
[58:31] [Music]
[58:35] Say, "What should you do if you get to
[58:36] something like that?"
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Have your Bible, have your sword nearby
[58:40] and say, "Here, devil. Just come along
[58:42] and I'll read you some scripture."
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I will read to you, "It is written."
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil
[58:57] &gt;&gt; and what is it? He shall flee from you.
[59:03] Say that again. Resist the devil and he
[59:06] shall flee from you.
[59:10] Hallelujah. You believe that?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That's not just a lesson for young
[59:14] people. That's a good lesson for me and
[59:16] everybody. He shall flee from me.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] Stand therefore, having your loins gird
[59:29] about with truth, and having on the
[59:32] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[59:34] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[59:37] gospel of peace,
[59:39] above all, taking the shield of faith,
[59:42] wherewith you shall be able, you shall
[59:45] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[59:48] the wicked. Isn't this marvelous? Isn't
[59:51] this positive? It doesn't say you shall
[59:54] you shall quench all the fiery darts if
[59:58] &gt;&gt; if this or if that or if something else.
[1:00:00] This is not ifs and may and and hope so.
[1:00:03] This scripture is so positive. Stand
[1:00:06] therefore and have your groins loins
[1:00:09] gird about with truth and having on the
[1:00:12] breastplate of righteousness. How would
[1:00:15] you have your loins g about with truth?
[1:00:17] I would say the simple statement of the
[1:00:19] prophet. Read your Bible.
[1:00:24] Read your Bible.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Have your feet shaw with the preparation
[1:00:29] of the gospel. And above all, taking the
[1:00:32] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[1:00:34] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:00:36] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[1:00:38] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[1:00:40] which is the word of God, praying always
[1:00:43] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:00:46] spirit, and watching there unto with all
[1:00:49] perseverance and supplications for all
[1:00:52] saints.
[1:00:53] Now when God called Abram as I be as we
[1:00:57] began at the first reading tonight
[1:01:00] and he began his journey of faith
[1:01:03] the only thing he gave him to hang on to
[1:01:06] was his promise.
[1:01:09] You know, I I want to just alert
[1:01:13] everyone here because we are a
[1:01:16] generation that we do want instant
[1:01:19] results
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; and we want to see something tangible.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; We want to see and we and let's face it,
[1:01:26] we get discouraged if we don't see it.
[1:01:30] But a but God when he called Abram, he
[1:01:34] said, "Get
[1:01:36] thee out
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; from your kindred from your father's
[1:01:40] house to a land that I'm going to show
[1:01:42] you."
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; No, no way to waver there. Just get out.
[1:01:48] So he departed and I'm going to give you
[1:01:51] a land and I'm going to make you a great
[1:01:52] blessing. I'm going to make you a father
[1:01:54] of nations. But you know, he walked and
[1:01:56] walked and walked and never did see
[1:01:59] physically what God was telling him. And
[1:02:03] that was a marvelous thing. He did not
[1:02:06] see the land as his own inheritance.
[1:02:08] Neither did Isaac and neither did Jacob.
[1:02:13] And we need to come to the place and
[1:02:15] say, and I want the young people
[1:02:17] especially to come to the place and say,
[1:02:19] if I never see tangible, you know, the
[1:02:22] thing that I really would like to see
[1:02:24] because, you know, I know that that
[1:02:26] starts to press down as being, ooh, that
[1:02:30] isn't really what I want to hear. But
[1:02:32] that's where your faith needs to be.
[1:02:35] Your faith needs to be at that level. If
[1:02:37] I never see it, if I never see the
[1:02:40] answer, what God promised me still holds
[1:02:44] true.
[1:02:46] And then when God sees that kind of
[1:02:48] faith, then he begins to move in. He
[1:02:50] begins to bring in blessings one after
[1:02:52] the other. All kinds of blessings. And
[1:02:54] Abraham became a mighty man of uh of
[1:02:58] stature and respect. Even of nations had
[1:03:01] to respect him. And he was still a man,
[1:03:03] still a wanderer.
[1:03:05] And the Bible says
[1:03:09] that he pitched his tent and he came he
[1:03:12] came to Bethl.
[1:03:15] He he he did build an altar earlier than
[1:03:17] that but he didn't pitch his tent there.
[1:03:19] But when he came to a place said this is
[1:03:22] the house of God and Bethl has a
[1:03:25] wonderful place through the scriptures.
[1:03:27] The Bible says he pitched his tent.
[1:03:34] I feel
[1:03:37] that many of you young people
[1:03:40] actually came
[1:03:43] like Jacob did when he went to sleep and
[1:03:45] God came and talked to him and he said,
[1:03:48] "I'm going to call this place Bethl.
[1:03:50] This is the house of God." And what I
[1:03:53] want to tell you is that when you're in
[1:03:56] this journey and you don't feel all that
[1:04:00] bliss and all that joy and oh we had
[1:04:02] such an exciting time and at church or
[1:04:05] we had the young people said oh we sang
[1:04:07] and we clapped our hands and all that.
[1:04:09] There'll be as as you heard at church, I
[1:04:11] believe it was brother uh brother Diddy
[1:04:13] that said there'll be the Monday morning
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; and there might be weeks of Monday
[1:04:18] mornings, but you want to go back and
[1:04:21] pick your tent at Bethl once again. So,
[1:04:24] I'm going to go back and pick my tent.
[1:04:26] There is a place God, you spoke to me so
[1:04:30] clearly and I know it. So everything
[1:04:33] else seems to be crowding in right now.
[1:04:35] It seemed to be a great uh uh cloud of
[1:04:39] gloom right now. Don't have any fear.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Bethl is still there. And he went back
[1:04:46] and he and and he didn't just visit it,
[1:04:48] but he pitched his tent there. Said,
[1:04:50] "I'm going to take my stakes out." And
[1:04:52] when he had to pitch his tent, he had to
[1:04:54] unpack animals. He had to do something.
[1:04:57] He had to he had to make a conse
[1:05:00] concentrated effort. I'm going to pitch
[1:05:02] my tent here. Say, "What would you do if
[1:05:05] you're going to pitch your tent?" Well,
[1:05:06] I tell you what, I'd begin to surround
[1:05:08] myself with things that I know would
[1:05:10] bring the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit,
[1:05:14] that dove of God. I'd be listening to
[1:05:16] the kind of music that I know that God
[1:05:19] would love to hear. If you have any
[1:05:22] question about it, brother Brandham
[1:05:23] listen to some music.
[1:05:26] You know, I I was at I was with one
[1:05:29] brother and he had brother Brandham
[1:05:31] singing,
[1:05:33] you know, and brother Brandham is not
[1:05:36] what we call a great singer,
[1:05:40] but it was sweet music
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; because you never found anybody sing
[1:05:45] more sincerely than he sang.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; It was just something I would create. I
[1:05:50] would build myself a a cocoon of
[1:05:53] spiritual things.
[1:05:56] Uh, I'll I'll pack I'm just trying to
[1:05:58] give you some I'm trying to give you
[1:06:00] some lessons. I'll pack a message book
[1:06:02] and I'll pack it to my bed even though
[1:06:05] I'm so exhausted. I know I'm not going
[1:06:06] to open it up. I know I'm not going to
[1:06:08] read it, but I pack it there anyway. I
[1:06:10] pack my Bible and a message book there.
[1:06:14] And I'll keep a tape right beside the
[1:06:17] bedside because if the devil wakes me
[1:06:19] up, I want him to wake me up for a good
[1:06:22] reason. I if I got something to worry
[1:06:24] about, then I'm going to plug in a tape
[1:06:26] and put my headphones on. And one
[1:06:29] brother says he said he said that that's
[1:06:32] how he said the devil's afraid to wake
[1:06:34] me up now
[1:06:36] cuz he knows if he wakes me up, I'm just
[1:06:38] going to be listening to a message. He
[1:06:41] said, "That's the best way to assure
[1:06:42] that he's he's going to sleep through."
[1:06:46] I don't know. I get woke up lots of
[1:06:48] times and I don't know why I'm saying
[1:06:49] this, but I I say you need to surround
[1:06:51] yourself and keep yourself in a cocoon,
[1:06:54] a spiritual cocoon, as it were, and you
[1:06:57] listen to the right thing and you read
[1:06:59] the right thing and you stay in that
[1:07:00] kind of atmosphere. And maybe you're
[1:07:02] busy, you can't get away and pray
[1:07:05] formally as such, but there's nothing
[1:07:07] preventing you from talking to God. You
[1:07:10] can walk down the street and talk to
[1:07:12] God. Hallelujah. You can be washing
[1:07:15] dishes and talk to God. God's not
[1:07:18] limited
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; to any certain certain spot. And it
[1:07:22] won't be very long before you start
[1:07:24] telling him. You start relating to him.
[1:07:26] When you met me, when I when I when I
[1:07:29] got to that place where I will call my
[1:07:31] Bethl when I was there and you just
[1:07:34] said, God doesn't have to say read uh
[1:07:36] volumes of books to you. That's not it.
[1:07:38] He just speaks few words.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes just a sentence, but you know
[1:07:43] it was God. Remind God what he said.
[1:07:47] Remind God what the Holy Spirit spoke in
[1:07:49] your heart and it will not be long and
[1:07:52] you'll begin to feel another presence
[1:07:54] move in. Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; That's true, my friends. It's absolutely
[1:07:59] true. If I can pass off any of these
[1:08:01] secrets to you, I will. And that's
[1:08:03] exactly what I'm doing. And you can also
[1:08:06] sense when an evil presence comes.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You can just feel you can feel it. It's
[1:08:13] a it's a gloom.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; It's a heaviness. It's a darkness.
[1:08:18] You don't know what it you may not have
[1:08:20] not know what it is whatsoever,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; but it just moves in. I've had it. I've
[1:08:25] had it just as real as real as if I
[1:08:28] could see it just come in.
[1:08:32] just a depression.
[1:08:34] When you feel that, some people are kind
[1:08:36] of given over to it. I say the moment
[1:08:38] you feel that cloud come in, that
[1:08:41] discouragement come in, just say, "I've
[1:08:44] got your number.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I've got your number.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm resisting you right now. Right
[1:08:49] at the very beginning. I'm not going to
[1:08:51] wait till the day is shot. And while
[1:08:54] you've clouted me all day, I'm going to
[1:08:56] get right on your case right now."
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; It works, friends. I'm telling you, it
[1:09:02] absolutely works.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It absolutely works. How many of young
[1:09:06] people believe it?
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] Now, just just a few more minutes. I'm
[1:09:23] going to close. I'm not going to keep
[1:09:24] you late.
[1:09:26] He says, and I just love I don't know
[1:09:29] whether brother was talking to a bunch
[1:09:31] of young people at this time or not, but
[1:09:34] it was at Jesus Christ the same
[1:09:36] yesterday in hot hot springs, Arkansas.
[1:09:39] And uh he's talking about Simon Peter
[1:09:42] and he said he knew what the sign or the
[1:09:45] identification of the Messiah would be.
[1:09:48] And uh Philip was standing there and uh
[1:09:52] Philip was listening and he sees and he
[1:09:55] hears Jesus this young prophet from
[1:09:58] Nazareth and he's saying you're Simon
[1:10:03] the son of Jonas
[1:10:06] and uh when Philillip heard that your
[1:10:09] name is Sim Simon the son of Jonas and
[1:10:13] he saw quickly and it comes to his mind
[1:10:15] he said that's truly him for I know the
[1:10:18] scriptures. The man never seen that man
[1:10:21] before. And how would he know who he
[1:10:23] was? That's the prophet. And he and he
[1:10:27] took out after a friend.
[1:10:30] He took out after a friend that he'd
[1:10:33] been having Bible studies with.
[1:10:36] See, he he just took out after this
[1:10:39] friend, Philillip. He had a friend whose
[1:10:42] name was Nathaniel. And he took out
[1:10:44] after Nathaniel because he'd had Bible
[1:10:46] studies with him.
[1:10:49] Well, the devil hates that.
[1:10:52] So when you get together,
[1:10:55] you know what you want to talk about.
[1:10:57] Said he was about 15 miles from there
[1:11:00] and he went around the mountain and he
[1:11:02] said, "Oh, how it should start our
[1:11:04] hearts. how it should start our hearts
[1:11:06] around the hillsides, around the
[1:11:09] prairies, down through the fields, down
[1:11:12] the alley, and across the street, and
[1:11:16] over across the nation somewhere, he
[1:11:19] found something. And I say, I don't know
[1:11:21] who all I'm talking to. I'm going to say
[1:11:24] to you in the name of the Lord, you
[1:11:25] found something.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; You found something. You don't know what
[1:11:29] the full purpose is, but you found
[1:11:31] something. You want to focus on that. I
[1:11:34] found something. What did he hear?
[1:11:36] You're Simon.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; The son of Jonas.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And he was on his way.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't say I got a great big blessing
[1:11:43] and he has a great big camp meeting and
[1:11:45] all that. He just said that's it.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; This is the message.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; This is God's prophet.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm on my way. This is the
[1:11:54] identification of the Messiah. And
[1:11:57] you've heard more than he ever will
[1:11:59] hear.
[1:12:00] You've heard more
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; already.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; See, you've heard more. You've heard the
[1:12:06] quotes. You've heard it that is that it
[1:12:08] has happened. And all you need to do is
[1:12:10] confess. You need to confess. I've heard
[1:12:13] it. And this is him.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; This message is him.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Nobody can do this. No man can do this.
[1:12:21] And he was on his way. And he said it
[1:12:24] should start it to start
[1:12:27] our hearts around the hillsides. I'll
[1:12:30] give it our language. It's a start a
[1:12:33] great sweep in Lyndon
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; or Bellingham
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; or Cloverdale or Suri or Langley or
[1:12:41] wherever you are or Seattle or
[1:12:44] throughout the Pacific Northwest in the
[1:12:46] streets
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; and in the alleys
[1:12:50] in a restaurant
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; or in a mall.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; What's the difference? And why not?
[1:12:56] [Applause]
[1:13:01] So he had this friend and he said maybe
[1:13:05] the conversation
[1:13:08] listening close now maybe the
[1:13:10] conversation is your conversation
[1:13:13] this was Philip's conversation
[1:13:16] maybe the conversation was something
[1:13:17] like this see
[1:13:20] time to say
[1:13:23] how's the olives getting along
[1:13:26] or how's your wife in the head.
[1:13:30] He didn't have time. Say, "How's the
[1:13:32] olive orchard?
[1:13:34] Have you got a good crop this year?
[1:13:37] What's happening in basketball?"
[1:13:40] Or, "What courses are you taking in
[1:13:42] school?
[1:13:46] How are things going?" He said he didn't
[1:13:48] have time to say all of these things. He
[1:13:51] said the message was urgent. We don't
[1:13:54] know what the purpose of God doing this
[1:13:57] is. Why did he do it?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; To did it to make me feel good? No, I
[1:14:02] don't believe that. He did it to have us
[1:14:04] exciting time. To make us clap our
[1:14:06] hands. I don't believe that. Why did he
[1:14:08] do it? I don't know. He's got something
[1:14:10] in his mind and I'm going to say, God,
[1:14:12] whatever you have in your mind, do it.
[1:14:16] Do it. And he said he didn't have he
[1:14:19] said and he seen something. He'd seen
[1:14:22] the scriptures identified and that's
[1:14:25] what they looked for for years and
[1:14:28] years. And some of you even young men, I
[1:14:31] know you've sat here in the services and
[1:14:33] you've heard messages and you've
[1:14:35] actually looked for something real for
[1:14:37] years perhaps since you were a lot
[1:14:39] younger. And now you want to be able to
[1:14:42] say, and I'm encouraging you to say, "I
[1:14:44] found him."
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't find a message. You didn't
[1:14:48] find a good speaker. I found him. It was
[1:14:51] Christ that spoke to me. I I wasn't even
[1:14:54] looking for this. I didn't even want to
[1:14:56] come. I found him.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you fellas, I was your The
[1:15:04] reason why I feel it real strong is I
[1:15:06] was just the age of some of you when I
[1:15:09] found him.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And it's never been the same since. And
[1:15:13] he is real.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He's more real than the person sitting
[1:15:17] next to you. He's more real than me
[1:15:19] standing here speaking to you. He's more
[1:15:22] real. And this is what he said.
[1:15:25] And I'm putting words in your mouth.
[1:15:27] This is what you want to say. Come and
[1:15:30] see who I found.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Come and see what I found.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Come and see what I found.
[1:15:44] I said to Brother Ron Spencer,
[1:15:47] we're getting ready to leave. He said,
[1:15:49] "The meetings have been a blessing." I
[1:15:52] said, "Brother Ron, you got so many
[1:15:56] good preachers around here. The
[1:15:58] country's full of them."
[1:16:01] Cuz he he got up to the pulpit and said,
[1:16:04] "I'm going to do what Brother Biscll did
[1:16:05] to me at camp." Said, "What are you
[1:16:08] doing next year?"
[1:16:10] And I was I was a little bit koi. All I
[1:16:13] did was smile. I never gave any
[1:16:15] commitment at all. But I said, "You've
[1:16:18] got so many good and youthful and young
[1:16:21] ministers here." He said, "Brother
[1:16:23] Biscoll,"
[1:16:26] he said, "Right in the middle while
[1:16:27] you're speaking, and then you can just
[1:16:29] begin to bring an experience and say, I
[1:16:33] was there." He said, "You don't know
[1:16:35] what that means to us. You just don't
[1:16:38] know what it means to our people.
[1:16:40] Young people and older people alike, you
[1:16:42] don't know what it means. You can say,
[1:16:44] "I was there. I saw it." Now, you can
[1:16:47] say something. I was there. I wasn't
[1:16:50] even looking for it. He found me. And he
[1:16:53] did something that is real within my
[1:16:56] life. And I can say, "I found him. Come
[1:16:59] and see him. Come and see who I found."
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] And I can assure you that God is so
[1:17:07] blessed with that.
[1:17:10] And I think that's the that's the thing
[1:17:12] I want to leave with. I have a I have
[1:17:15] probably a whole another service here,
[1:17:17] but I'm not going to take it. That's the
[1:17:19] thing I want to leave.
[1:17:22] God called Abram. I'm just rehearsing it
[1:17:24] now. And he got up quick. He answered
[1:17:29] the call. And I say I've seen a lot of
[1:17:32] that in the last few weeks. I've seen it
[1:17:35] happen. I've seen it happen in meetings.
[1:17:38] Seen it happened for baptism. Seen it
[1:17:41] happen for a lot of a lot of things. And
[1:17:43] you parents
[1:17:46] how
[1:17:47] something should
[1:17:50] go very very deep down
[1:17:53] within our hearts.
[1:17:56] Very very deep down. I'll tell you why.
[1:18:00] Some people have prayed for years
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and saw their young people
[1:18:05] go into the world and be very marred and
[1:18:08] very wounded and all the rest of it. And
[1:18:12] for this that we have seen here, I say
[1:18:14] this is a this is a not only a victory,
[1:18:18] this is glorious beyond all words.
[1:18:22] And when you can see your children or
[1:18:25] your young people and you can see that
[1:18:28] their lives have been preserved from the
[1:18:30] entanglements.
[1:18:32] Oh, I would like to take every one of
[1:18:35] you, every one of you young people
[1:18:37] especially, and let you sit in my office
[1:18:39] and see brother Biscoll weep and cry
[1:18:43] with the people who are sitting there
[1:18:45] who had your chance but didn't take it.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And then it got so messed up and so
[1:18:52] entangled and was just fearsome. It's so
[1:18:55] dreadful and so sad.
[1:18:59] I can do nothing and my hands are tied.
[1:19:02] Even God can't untangle it. It is such a
[1:19:05] horrific mess. You've been spared all of
[1:19:08] that. And the demons are screaming, "I
[1:19:11] don't have a chance at these people. I
[1:19:14] don't have a chance because God came
[1:19:16] down on them." Hallelujah.
[1:19:22] And God has preserved you and kept you
[1:19:24] from it. And you got a little preacher
[1:19:27] getting old tonight, but I'm preaching
[1:19:28] the same thing. God has saved you from
[1:19:32] it. He preserved you. And God has
[1:19:34] something in mind for you.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That you can't even imagine. You can't
[1:19:39] even imagine. You want to say, "Oh, God,
[1:19:41] tonight, take me to that further step.
[1:19:44] Take me what for what you have
[1:19:46] prepared." For whatever reason, you did
[1:19:49] this. Number one, I acknowledge you did
[1:19:51] it. And number two, I acknowledge what
[1:19:54] brother Bis was preaching tonight. You
[1:19:55] have something in mind for me. And what
[1:19:58] you have in mind for me is sure going to
[1:20:00] be a sad day for the enemy. It's going
[1:20:03] to be a sad day for the devil. I'm
[1:20:05] giving my life over to this gospel.
[1:20:08] Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] Bless the Lord.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] Oh, heavenly father, I just feel so
[1:20:20] consumed. Seems like I would like to say
[1:20:23] to these young people and the adults
[1:20:25] alike, oh God, that they would just keep
[1:20:27] adding wood to the fire, add encouraging
[1:20:30] words, add prayers, add a spiritual
[1:20:33] atmosphere, oh God, that they'll deny
[1:20:35] anything that's that's uh negative and
[1:20:38] deny anything that would be a hindrance
[1:20:40] and deny anything that would be a cloud.
[1:20:42] Oh God, that they would just encourage
[1:20:44] the people, encourage their neighbor,
[1:20:47] encourage their friend, their loved one,
[1:20:49] whoever it might be to encourage them.
[1:20:52] Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:20:56] pray that you will come amongst us and
[1:20:58] for whatever purpose, whatever purpose
[1:21:01] you have done, what you have done, we
[1:21:05] say move on, Lord, move on.
[1:21:09] Here we are, oh God. Move on, oh God.
[1:21:14] Blessed Lord,
[1:21:16] you have a plan. You have a program
[1:21:21] for each one of our lives. And I don't
[1:21:23] know exactly what it is. I don't pretend
[1:21:25] to know. I don't even know fully what
[1:21:28] you have for me, but I say, "Oh Lord,
[1:21:31] take my hand. Be my guide and lead me on
[1:21:35] this journey. I don't know what what's
[1:21:37] around the next corner. Lord, I may be
[1:21:40] climbing a steep side of the mountain or
[1:21:42] I may come to a glorious, beautiful
[1:21:44] valley. Lord, I don't know what it is
[1:21:46] that you have, but here we are tonight
[1:21:49] to give ourselves and say, "I'm going to
[1:21:53] walk with you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] Oh, bless your name, Lord. Bless your
[1:21:59] name." I wonder if we could sing,
[1:22:00] Brother Ryan. Let me walk with you,
[1:22:01] Jesus.
[1:22:08] Let me walk with you Jesus.
[1:22:19] Leave me
[1:22:21] alone.
[1:22:23] Oh boy without
[1:22:27] you.
[1:22:30] Never,
[1:22:32] never, no, never
[1:22:36] make heaven
[1:22:38] my home. Once again, let me walk with
[1:22:41] you.
[1:22:42] Oh, let me
[1:22:46] walk with you, Jesus.
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:55] Leave me
[1:22:57] alone.
[1:23:01] or without
[1:23:03] you. I
[1:23:06] would never.
[1:23:09] No, you never
[1:23:12] make heaven my home. I've been on the
[1:23:17] mountain. Yes, I feel
[1:23:21] the mountain
[1:23:28] and I feel
[1:23:30] this valley.
[1:23:33] Oh, listen to the next line now. But
[1:23:37] never, not one time and he failed me.
[1:23:44] Amen.
[1:23:45] Turn to him with my trouble.
[1:23:51] I go home.
[1:23:55] So let
[1:23:57] me be walking
[1:24:00] in Jesus.
[1:24:02] Oh my
[1:24:04] go.
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:12] Oh, far without
[1:24:16] you
[1:24:18] would never
[1:24:20] could never
[1:24:23] would never make heaven
[1:24:27] my home.
[1:24:29] You found me. You found me when I was
[1:24:36] alone.
[1:24:40] Jesus found you when I was
[1:24:47] remember when he found you.
[1:24:50] You found me when no one
[1:24:55] loves me.
[1:24:58] And no one
[1:25:02] just
[1:25:05] But there's one. There's one old
[1:25:08] man. Only one.
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:42] Let me give you the words of Jesus. Now
[1:25:44] let me stand in hisstead as a servant of
[1:25:48] Christ.
[1:25:50] His words now. I will never leave you
[1:25:55] nor forsake you.
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:58] I will never leave you.
[1:26:02] There's no friend like this.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:07] [Music]
[1:26:10] I'd like to sing that chorus of a song
[1:26:13] that a 12-year-old girl wrote.
[1:26:17] I'll say yes. Uh
[1:26:22] yeah,
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:37] sorry to hinder me
[1:26:43] for someday.
[1:26:46] his blessed face
[1:26:48] and what to see.
[1:26:53] It makes no difference
[1:26:56] what the cost
[1:26:58] or how heavy
[1:27:01] the cross.
[1:27:03] I don't want
[1:27:05] nothing here to hinder me.
[1:27:12] I don't want
[1:27:15] nothing here to hinder me
[1:27:22] for something
[1:27:24] blessed.
[1:27:31] Oh, it makes no difference
[1:27:34] what the cost
[1:27:36] or how heavy
[1:27:39] the cross.
[1:27:41] I don't want
[1:27:44] nothing.
[1:27:50] One day
[1:27:52] I heard a voice.
[1:27:55] He said, "If you make me your choice,
[1:28:00] I'll wait your every care
[1:28:04] and set you free." How many are free?
[1:28:08] Praise God.
[1:28:11] To him that day
[1:28:14] and he took my sin away.
[1:28:19] Now I don't want
[1:28:21] nothing here to hinder me.
[1:28:28] Oh, I don't want
[1:28:31] nothing here to hinder me.
[1:28:36] Oh,
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] his blessed face I want to see.
[1:28:47] It makes no difference
[1:28:50] what the cost
[1:28:52] or how heavy
[1:28:55] the cross.
[1:28:57] I don't want
[1:28:59] nothing here.
[1:29:05] Now, we're going to sing. Now, someday
[1:29:07] when I get home, I'm going to say all
[1:29:10] you young people, if it should happen,
[1:29:15] it's going to happen.
[1:29:18] And you probably won't recognize me. I
[1:29:20] should maybe send a picture around.
[1:29:23] I'd like to have a picture when I was
[1:29:24] about 19,
[1:29:26] 20 years old. How skinny is a race, just
[1:29:30] like Michael Ray.
[1:29:33] Almost had to have two of me so he could
[1:29:35] see me.
[1:29:36] Those things have changed. But whatever
[1:29:38] God had in his mind, that's exactly what
[1:29:40] it'll be.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to come along and say, "Hi
[1:29:43] there, Caleb. This is Brother Ed."
[1:29:44] You're going to say, "You're kidding.
[1:29:50] No, I don't think you'll say that.
[1:29:51] You'll just say,
[1:29:53] "So glad you made it and so glad I made
[1:29:55] it." We're going to rejoice. You think
[1:29:57] it's You think it's going to be a quiet
[1:29:59] moment?
[1:30:00] We're going to shout and sing and dance
[1:30:03] about.
[1:30:05] Hallelujah.
[1:30:09] Glory.
[1:30:11] You believe it?
[1:30:14] Amen.
[1:30:17] That's exactly what we're going to do.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to just close with one
[1:30:22] other chorus instead of singing the last
[1:30:23] verse. Going to sing. When we're inside
[1:30:25] the gates of pearl,
[1:30:28] we're going to learn a lot of things.
[1:30:32] We'll have a harp. Now, we don't know if
[1:30:33] everybody's going to have harp cuz
[1:30:35] brother Brandon said, "Then all the
[1:30:36] musicians would have it on us." I don't
[1:30:38] know how to play a harp. I know one of
[1:30:39] the one of the snow girls plays a harp.
[1:30:42] beautiful harp, but uh I don't know
[1:30:44] anything about a harp, but I should know
[1:30:46] a lot about rejoicing and singing and
[1:30:48] shouting and dancing about it. And the
[1:30:50] lamb will dry our tears. And that's not
[1:30:53] just a course we're singing down here.
[1:30:54] That is a reality. And you're going to
[1:30:57] know it's a reality one day cuz you're
[1:30:59] going to be there. Amen.
[1:31:02] When we're inside the gates of we're
[1:31:06] going to learn a lot of things.
[1:31:10] We'll have a heart
[1:31:13] of gold
[1:31:17] for the singing
[1:31:20] and the land will dry our tears.
[1:31:24] You have a plan on coming to 10,000
[1:31:30] years old.
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:38] We don't have a heart made of per
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:32:03] I tell you what, when the Holy Spirit
[1:32:06] comes down, whatever you do, don't say,
[1:32:08] "I'll never do that." Because God for
[1:32:10] sure will make you do it. I've had
[1:32:13] people say, "Oh, I can never I can never
[1:32:15] raise my hand. I can never shout. I can
[1:32:18] never clap my hands." They come around,
[1:32:20] see the believers do it, and say, "Oh my
[1:32:21] goodness, I can never do that.
[1:32:24] I know one old fellow. He was British.
[1:32:27] He was just as British as he could be.
[1:32:28] He was just as conservative as he could
[1:32:30] be. And he saw all these people. He
[1:32:32] said, "I can never Oh my goodness. That
[1:32:34] was that was just terrible." He couldn't
[1:32:36] imagine doing that. And the Holy Spirit
[1:32:38] struck him. And the next thing he was
[1:32:39] doing, he was standing on a pew. He's
[1:32:41] standing right on the seat rejoicing. He
[1:32:44] didn't know what happened to him.
[1:32:46] Sometimes God needs to shake us up.
[1:32:52] Hallelujah. Oh, when we're inside the G,
[1:32:57] we're going to have a lot of things.
[1:33:00] Yes.
[1:33:08] Oh down
[1:33:12] the last
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:21] one.

[1:33:55] 10,000 years we'll smile.

[1:34:49] I remember him from 15 years about about
[1:34:52] 15 15 years old. So all you fellas you
[1:34:56] have a real good example here. One of
[1:34:58] brother Aaron Hardy. Brother Aaron if

[1:35:02] upon the people upon the service in
[1:35:05] Jesus name and dismiss us. God bless you

[1:35:17] these things sink in our hearts, oh God,
[1:35:19] and just be with the young people as
[1:35:21] they go to school, Lord. Ask, Father,
[1:35:23] that you would just turn their schools
[1:35:24] upside down, Father. Set us a fire,
[1:35:27] Lord. Ignite our hearts for you, Lord.

[1:36:04] with this thing. Hallelujah.

[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says that when this puts
[1:36:12] out another bud, and no one put this bud
[1:36:16] out, God did it. And when the Holy
[1:36:18] Spirit puts out another bud, it'll be a
[1:36:21] book of Acts. Hallelujah.
