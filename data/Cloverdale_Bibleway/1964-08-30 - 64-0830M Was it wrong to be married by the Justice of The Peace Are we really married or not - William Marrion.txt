TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we were married 21 years ago by the justice of the peace was was it wrong yes it was wrong for you to do that marriage belongs in the house of God but being that you are married here's when you're really married you're married when you vow one to the other when you promise one another that you're that you'll take one another the justice of peace could give you license that's legal terms of living together is husband and wife without being common law husband and wife but when you promise this girl and this you promise that man that you'll live true to him and you take him to be your husband you're married Dan remember I explained that last week I believe it was see when you promis her see even in the in the old Bible if a man was betra to a maid and you know the laws on that it was just the same as an adultery certainly was and he promised that was it the question is asked to he was a um a norment a norment a norment the same as a divorce see when you ask me those questions friends you don't know what that does to me I've got many friends sitting here married two or three times did you realize I'm talking to my own son Billy Paul but I spare Billy Paul no indeed Billy Paul got married to some little girl he came up and said Daddy I'm going to get married I was was my said butt your head against the wall just kept kept on wash my car like that he said I'm going to get married I said oh go just kept on like that he goes around tell his mother and his mother laughed at him you know what he done run off with some little kid still in common school and got married we analed the wedding the father of the girl and myself we an know the wedding but he was married just the same he's my boy sitting here listen at me now that's exactly he come to me with the girl he lives with now my daughter-in-law my little grandson he said Daddy will you marry me I said by no means that's my own son son you think that don't cut me to the core and I packed him in my arms and done everything I could do and I've been both father and mother to him you think that don't kill me to say that but it's a truth certainly my boy sitting here listening at my daughter-in-law and my little grandson sitting right here now but I tell him it's wrong because I've got to I'm Duty bound to that word and I say you got married by a magistrate you should have been married by the church by the minister that's a decent thing to do for a Christian but being that you have already made that promise and vow and been married 21 years ago I think it's all right you say well I you question might be should I come and be married again if you wish to don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith because if anything's there you can't go no further than right there you stop right there when that question mark comes that's where you end right there but I for me it would be all right the man that baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ finally run me out of church because I wouldn't agree with him on women preachers that didn't make me be re-baptized again see sure or not that's all right but just remember these things are cutting to me I got bosom friends sitting here men and women would take their lather pull a eye out and give it to me if I'd ask them for it yes sir and they're married twice sometimes three times sitting right here now and my own boy my own grandson my grand and my daughter-in-law I love look at Billy how I stood by him and how he stood by me but to say truth or truth is truth truth sister dear brother dear one time a Salesman tell me he walked into a church is Christian up in Connecticut or somewhere up there is wasn't he was a Pentecostal but he went in there to pray and said when he got in there to knelt down the church to pray says Ride Along he's tired kind of homesick salesman and's selling stuff and said he from to factories and he went in there to to make some buys or something and he come to the church and thought i' go we ever go and pray the doors open said he went in didn't hear nobody so I knelt down started praying actually he's praying there say about an hour that directly he heard some door slam or something he thought was custodian or something in church said after while he noticed here come he heard somebody talking he stepped up there look look around see what was custodian it was a man and woman standing before the altar holding one another's hands said I take you dear to be my lawful wted wife wife see she said I take you dear to be my lawful wetted husband well he said this is a strange thing said this Pentecostal he said this man in woman getting married without a preacher and so he just sat down and waited and after they made their vows and live true to one another only the death would separate him they put her arms around one another kissed each other turn around walked out smiling he said just a moment he said um I'm kind of curious I'm a stranger said you all get married said yes without a preacher he said no said we've been married 40 years years he said we got married right here this altar 40 years ago and every year we come back and renew our vows that's a good idea see but as far as Mary when you promise her she takes your word you take her word and God takes both your word see but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
