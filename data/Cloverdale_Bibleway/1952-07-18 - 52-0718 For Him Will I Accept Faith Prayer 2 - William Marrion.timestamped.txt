[2:33] denied troubl
[2:35] choppy people raising up here looking at

[2:58] left I know according to your word Lord
[3:01] is all I have to go by in my my all that
[3:04] I know how to read I believe that you
[3:07] have already paid for every person in
[3:11] here to be
[3:12] well I believe that our lord Jesus thy
[3:16] son did that at
[3:18] Calvary and you said all things are
[3:22] possible if you just believe when you
[3:25] pray believe you receive what you ask
[3:27] for and you shall have it
[3:29] and then besides all of that sending the
[3:32] witness of the Holy Spirit you sent back
[3:34] to his gifts and signs and wonders that
[3:37] which still caus us to know when the
[3:39] world you know that Educators that get a
[3:42] hold of the Bible in their C
[3:44] ecclesiastical ways would cut it around
[3:46] and explain this out and that out like
[3:50] BM like Cain of all offering his
[3:52] sacrifice and making an altar and
[3:55] worshiping you but not in the provided
[3:57] way without blood he was refus rejected
[4:00] in that same Spirit lives on down to his
[4:03] children but able the just one not so
[4:07] pretty the alar is not so decorated but
[4:10] come in the provided way God provided
[4:13] way leading a lamb a substitute an
[4:16] innocent one to take a guilty one's
[4:19] Place father we believe that you led
[4:22] Jesus to Cal he was born in a barn wow
[4:27] the prince of Glory born in a born he
[4:30] was a lamb Lambs are not born in beds
[4:33] they're born in
[4:35] stables and they led him to
[4:38] Calvary they L him up there just like
[4:42] Abel with a grap Vine around the Lamb's
[4:44] neck L it up to the
[4:47] Rock
[4:50] there as a s offering for soul and body
[4:55] he was
[4:56] made you bruised him and M wased him and
[5:00] beat
[5:01] him and there he gave the spirit into
[5:04] the hand of the father and the people
[5:08] Veil went from top to bottom earthquake
[5:12] happened they buried him on the third
[5:15] day that morning star after all the
[5:18] birds hush singing as Mary and Martha
[5:21] walking up the hill wondering who roll
[5:23] away the
[5:24] stone then all of a sudden you hear come
[5:27] an angel of the light streaking down
[5:29] from the heaven and the stone was rolled
[5:31] away he came forth and many of those who
[5:34] slept in the dust of the Earth the
[5:37] Saints Rose and came out of the graves
[5:39] and entered into the city meeting some
[5:41] of the old friends before going up a lot
[5:45] of time the first
[5:48] fruit the
[5:50] earnest now God help us tonight to
[5:53] believe help us to lay aside every
[5:55] shadowy weight just move right in now
[5:58] with perfect virgin and
[6:00] unadulterated Faith Lord and be healed
[6:03] everyone while we ask it in his name
[6:06] amen but in the days of the voice of the
[6:09] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[6:11] sound the mystery of God should be
[6:13] finished as he hath declared to his
[6:15] servants the prophets
