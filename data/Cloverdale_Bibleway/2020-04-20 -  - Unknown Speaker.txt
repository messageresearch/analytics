TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] on Sunday which was the next day after the soldier boy had been called out I was once again on the platform and they had a prayer line and in that prayer line came a woman well well-known to us she was a very dear friend of my parents and I knew her very well her name was sister Clint her husband they didn't have any children that I know of her husband was a very stout man and I don't know what he what he actually did for a living but I believe you worked in the agricultural department from what we have found out since and so she came up and she just standing and brother branham says now here is a lady and he begins to speak and he said you're very nervous he said and you have other complications other problems you have I think a spiritual problem as well and it begins to talk - he said yes you are very nervous he said I see you standing by a window when the Sun was setting and you're rubbing your hands and then he stops and he's speaking to her but he's also speaking to the congregation speaking to people like myself he's saying now and this it means so much to us now he said no who could do that what man could tell you where you were standing and what you were praying and he said and then you prayed that God would help you to get a prayer card and when that prayer card was given to you you were so happy very happy that you'd received a prayer card and he asked you know how how could a man know that he wanted the people to see that that was God and the Prophet the Prophet ministry for profit is a spokesman for God it was not just a gift of discernment it was not that but a lot of my friends were tended to believe that it was just maybe a gift of a word of knowledge or something it wasn't that he was in both worlds he was in another dimension and he told her where she was standing what her prayer was and how her reaction when she got the prayer card and then he said now he said lay it we'll just talk to the lady and he said you have something else no this is what was so striking to me said you have something else that's on your heart you're praying for a friend a man that's dying with cancer and they do not live and I noticed he said they do not live because it was him and his wife he said they do not live here they live in Fort st. John and I knew Fort Saint John was just 50 miles of the Alaskan Highway what brother branham did not know is we were going up the highway I was taking him early the next morning Monday morning up the highway and brother Branham was preaching on show us the father I thought it was so remarkable he was actually showing the people the father said who could tell you where you were standing when you prayed no one will Almighty God and that you're praying for a friend and he said these he's dying with cancer yes he said he's a sinner and he's dying with cancer mentioned it twice and he said only believe just believe that seemed to be the key he said take that handkerchief that you have and give it to him and he'll be well I guess she never did get it to him this was the end of May he passed away July the 6th of 1961 but of course I didn't know that we found that out many years later but the next day I'm in the car and you have to understand I had a lot of questions about brother Branham about his doctor and about his ministry but there was one thing that I knew that is the angel of the Lord was in attendance with him at the platform and now we were having a just profound effect upon me and other ministers and he said he said as we drove down the highway we started coming to the town of fort st. John which laid up to the right hand of the highway and there was an entrance into Fort st. John when the US Army cut just through the farmland the farmhouse was just up to the right maybe a hundred eight hundred and fifty yards and I had noticed that house so many times in my youth and childhood and just a big old white farmhouse and as brother branham as we he slowed down for the speed limit and were just driving slowly he said there was a woman that came in the prayer line yesterday praying for a man from Fort st. John Oh I said brother branham she's a very good friend of my parents her name is sister Flint and I know her well and and I knew her I was there on the platform and she was standing there and he was telling her these things now here we are driving and the house is just over here to my right and he said he'd just serious he he it was in a different frame of mind you'd say and he just said as we were driving past the hope was going by so he swung his arm this way and pointed behind my head he said the man is in that house well I was shocked I was startled but I didn't know that the man was in that house I didn't know his name or anything and we we continued on the road up to Fort Nelson and beyond up to brother bud southwest place brother bud Southworth was just a new new Christian he had been saved in my church about a year before I was so anxious to acquaint him with spiritual things he was just uh he was raised horses and he rolled in in the rodeos and things and so he didn't know anything he didn't know Genesis from Revelation he just didn't know the Bible so I wonder acquaint him with what a prophet was I said when we went by that house I said brother branham pointed to it and said the man is in that house I said you know sister Clint she was on the platform praying for him and and by the South wake my friend he said oh I know him he said his name is Ed Thomas I've known him ever since I've been over eight years old and so now I had it on the platform on the highway and with brother South wait this was all within 24 hours it was like just a divine intervention of God saying I will cause you to believe I will bring it right in front of you I will bring it it was so arranged I just could not doubt it I guess it was the grace of God to me that was anchoring my faith and I just couldn't there was one day and the next day and the next day and I do not know whether it was in that particular service or brother branham spoke and all of the service was not taped apparently but anyway I was standing and I'll never forget this I was standing on the platform right beside me on my right hand side was standing brother Paul cornish the pastor in the church in Grand Prairie and he was he was just standing here as a very taller than I was here very dignified very scholarly and a man that didn't show a lot of emotion but he was standing there and brother Brendan was facing not facing us he had his back to us and to the prayer line was going down the wall this time and up this way and why were just standing there brother branham I can't explain this this is so strange but he just lifted his head this way and cried out the boilbee all right and a force went by me it was like a wind but it wasn't a wind it was just a power of force just went by me but I was conscious of it and I was bewildered I don't know what's happening the boy will be all right and Paul cornish brother Paul cornish collapses over and is in convulsing tears and I don't know what's happening here he's the voice the force is also unusual while he's just talking to somebody in front of him and and and here's brother Paul Cornish what do you do when somebody's you know crying and kill volsce I didn't know whether to pray with him or what to do then he straightened up after he collected himself he nudged me and he said brother Eddie he said you see down the prayer line towards the end he said young lad that's standing there he said that's my son and he's up for a serious operation next week and to have to have those kind of things I I just became aware of another realm I became aware of another place another dimension this man was not just ministering to the people but it was like he was he was in contact with another world the boy will be alright and he just continues on and I I don't know anything of the lad what happened after that but I that was just a very very strange and very unusual event for me [Music] you [Music]
