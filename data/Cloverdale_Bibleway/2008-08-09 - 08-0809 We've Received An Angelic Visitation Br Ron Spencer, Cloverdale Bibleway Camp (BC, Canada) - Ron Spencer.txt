I used to be all so sad, but now I'm free and Jesus got a hold of my life. Thank you. Aren't you glad Jesus got a hold of your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I'm going to ask the choir to come up. We're going to sing uh the wonder of your cross. I've been I was thinking tossing and trying to decide whether this song was really on my heart. I had a brother call me and uh told him how much he was blessed by this song. We trust that someone tonight will be blessed. Maybe the the choir could come maybe as they do. Let's sing together. Jesus, all for Jesus. Jesus, all for Jesus. All my have and have an ever dream. Jesus. All for Jesus. All I am and have and ever hope to be. For it's only in your will. For it's only in your will that I free. Glory in your will that I that I am free. Jesus. All for Jesus. all my some folks today went through and there was a station at the cross. But you know what? I don't know. I heard that some people never got to the cross. And if you didn't get to the cross, everything you did today was for nothing. You don't get any points. which is an illustration. If you don't if you never get to the cross, there is nothing in your life that can ever amount to anything. Amen. And we can't put enough emphasis on that. It is the most important thing a person needs to come to the foot of the cross. So, we're going to trust that you'd be blessed by this song as we sing it tonight. The wonder of your cross shall be our meditation to gather in that shadow as the sun went down to weep with those who thought that you were leaving. You were leaving Jesus, a humble king who never wore an earthly crown. to steal away at night when they took down your body with love and care to lay it in a borrowed grave to go with Mary to the place they laid you. where they laid you, Jesus. And in the morning find the stone was rolled away. The cross. Oh, the wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful cross. What glory, what victory I find. &gt;&gt; I will come to the wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful cross. And my whole life I lay down. Where heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness. The sun went dark. The stars refused to give their light. But then the declaration he is ris. You are risen. Jesus, he is not dead. Behold, he lives forever more. Oh, the cross. Oh, the wonderful cross. What glory and what victory there I find. &gt;&gt; Well, I will come to that wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful cross. And my whole life I lay down. &gt;&gt; Oh the cross. Oh the wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Oh, what glory and what victory there I find. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I will come. Come to the wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful cross. And my whole life I lay down. And my whole life I lay down where heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness. The sun went dark. The stars refused to give their light. &gt;&gt; But then the he is risol he lives forever more. Oh, the cross. Oh, the wonderful cross. What glory and what victory there I find. Oh, and I will come. Come to the wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Wonderful cross. &gt;&gt; Oh, and my whole life I lay down. Oh, the cross. Sing it with me. Oh, the wonderful cross. Oh, what glory and what victory there I find. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I will come unto the wonderful cross. world and my whole life I lay down. singing once again. Oh, the cross. Oh, the wonderful cross. What glory and what victory there I found. Oh, I will come un come to the wonderful cross. And my whole life I lay down. &gt;&gt; And my whole life I lay down. and my one life I hallelujah to your name Lord Jesus glory to your name Lord Hallelujah So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down. Well, I will cling cling to the old rocking cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Sing it once again. Oh, I'll cherish the oriented cross till my trophies. At last I lay down. Will I will cling to the over and accept it someday for a crown. So I will cherish cherish the old crooked cross. Till my true belief that last night I will break the old and exchange for a crown. Amen. How wonderful. &gt;&gt; I hope you're all comfortable. &gt;&gt; We tried to keep it as uh moderate inside as possible. It's hard to keep it so it's uh comfortable throughout the whole tent. We don't want you on the outside to get too cool. So, we're dropping the curtains down or the side flaps. We hope that you're not too stuffy here up in the front. So, as long as you're comfortable, we don't want to make it too comfortable because we we don't want you to doze while the service is in progress. Like someone said, if you can sleep while I'm preaching, you go right ahead. I don't think you're going to sleep while brother Ron Spencer's preaching. I just I'm quite sure of that. Uh we only have tonight and tomorrow's service and uh on one hand there's going to be a lot of folks who put so much into it, so much work, so much labor. Uh some have worked uh most of the night sometimes getting ready and all the preparation. Those in the kitchen, I know you go in, you go through and pick up your food, but they start very very early in the morning and uh to have everything ready and work till way late at night and we're thankful for that. They're they're they're missing the meeting. They're watching the screen right now and I know that they would much prefer being right here. We appreciate that. Uh the Lord has given us this uh camp facility and had he not made it possible, we wouldn't have the kind of liberty. uh we wouldn't have the kind of feel that we have. I know that for those of you that have been here in previous camps and uh some of you many of you that are here have have been to all seven years that we were here previously. Was seven, wasn't it? Brother Tom and uh but there uh it's a feeling of we're at home and I think that's a feel that you have. you young people have mentioned it and many of the uh others of the congregation have mentioned it. I I'm glad you feel that way and I'm glad you've mentioned it because that's personally how I feel. It's not just a feeling but there are many uh uh liberties which we're able to take uh when you have it and you own it yourself which before we had to you know always ask permission. Sometimes we were not accepted or our permission was not granted and we weren't able to do things we wanted to do. But now it's it's all different and all I can say is thank you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You You've certainly been good to me. You've certainly been good to us. Brother Brandham made a statement. I want to just take a moment to uh before our brother Ron comes to preach because we actually have nothing better to do. We're here at camp and uh this is all we have to do this evening. When we're done, you know, we don't want it to end too soon anyway, do we? So, we just want to savor every moment. But in the message influence, brother Brandham uh he mentioned uh pilgrims progress and uh the young people today. I was going to have brother Tom say something about it because he would be best to represent the those that have labored for weeks and I would guess even into the months to prepare. Uh uh I know that some started this morning, including myself and my wife and my daughters at 7:30. They said, "You must be down here to get ready." And we all had to have a part. Brother Lance spoke on the cross. Brother John Andy's was the evangelist. Brother Tom, he preached at at a at a certain station. And uh I was at house beautiful as the interpreter to uh start Christian and the group on their way and it was really a wonderful time. So I thought I wanted to see what brother Brandham had said. I know he mentioned Pilgrim's Progress quite a number of times but he said this in the message influence. uh he said uh Abraham Lincoln had two books uh Pilgrim's Progress and the Bible and you see what kind of a character that molded. So if you young people have not read Pilgrim's Progress would be good for you and I'm sure you'd have some inspiration now after today to read and see why that molded the kind of person uh the pilgrims pro progress in the Bible. And then he went on to say this, and this is what I really want to convey to you this evening. Just let me go in your house and see what kind of pictures you got on your wall and let me go in your home or your office and uh and let's see what kind of music playing uh what you read. what you look at and I can pretty well tell what's on the inside of you because it feeds on that. Notice he didn't say you feed on that. He said it feeds on that. That spirit that's in you feeds on that. And then he went on to say this. And oh to this entire congregation, I want you to know as an individual, as a pastor, this really touched me. Don't let it condemn you if you don't think you measure up, but use it as an example and a and a a a high water mark to move to. He says, "And owe to a home." If we made a home more lovely, children wouldn't want to run away. Make things more for them where they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home where home he said they can't hardly wait to get till they get there. And that's the way home should be. this here group of people under this tent. You that are visiting, that's fine. You can listen to me. But I speak largely to the Bible way congregation that fellowship here and those of you that are part of the congregation that perhaps live some distance away, but you consider home for you. Uh you're the family. You're the children of the family that God has caused to gather here. And I say from my heart, we've tried to make things welcome. We've tried to make things lovely. I don't mean nice, flowery, but I mean lovely with an atmosphere, with a welcoming spirit. We've tried to make things so that you want to come back. We've tried to make things so that even when the weather isn't very nice, you want to be here. You don't want to miss a meeting because it is too it it is just too in inspiring for you. It's it's a food for your soul. It it strengthens you. And you young people, we like to have things nice for you. We try to do things so that you want to come back. And you you sitting here today are a witness to that. You want to be here. And those of you that are visiting, I'm sure you want to come back. And we want you to come back. We want you to come into this atmosphere. We want you to participate and be part of the miracles that God is doing. You say, "Is God doing miracles?" Well, I want to show you one. Some of us in our congregation, we have seen these, but I have some slides I want you to see of our brother Ron Spencer just that is him last September, not one year ago yet. I wish we had the giant screen so you could see it. That's brother Ron Spencer last September and he was in that state in that burn ward and sister Connie was between two hospitals. one where her son Matthew was s was laying because he went to retrieve his father in this fire and they stumbled and fell and he was in one hospital and brother brother Spencer in the other and I got so burned. Now sitting in my study is exactly how it happened. sitting in my study. I wanted to go and be at brother Ron's bedside, but I wasn't able to go. And the Holy Spirit came on me and said, "Call Sister Connie." And I knew that Sister Connie was not home. I knew that she was at his hospital. And I knew that they weren't able to take a call there, but I was so compelled and I just I picked up the phone and the only number I had was her home number and I knew she wasn't at home. But that's where you have to just cast down reasoning and do what the spirit is telling you to do. I picked up the phone, called the home phone, it rang maybe twice, and Sister Connie picked up the phone. My first words was, "Sister Connie, where are you? She said, "I'm between hospitals. I've just left the one hospital. I'm on my way to Ron's hospital." And I said, "God has so burdened me. I'm so burdened. I'm burdened for you. You don't have your husband. You don't have your son. Your husband's hanging between life and death." I said, "Sister Connie, I want you to take a message. I understand from a medical people that the last of the human senses to depart the body is the hearing. I've had experiences of that before. I said, "And you take and I want you to speak in brother Ron's ear and tell him that we have just purchased a camp and he's going to preach there next year." And go and tell him that in his ear. And as he said night before last, Sister Connie came and spoke those words in his ear while he was yet unconscious. I say you young people, you as a congregation are sitting here tonight not only witnessing a miracle, but you are participating in that miracle because God has called you to be here. Let's say praise be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And what you see now on the screen is him about 45 days later. Within about a month and a half, God had healed him and raised him up the way he is right now. And I I appreciate your clapping. I think it's good to give a clap to the Lord, but I really think the Lord would like to hear your voice and say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him praise. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Be the glory. Let's stand to our &gt;&gt; feet for sing and hope and all. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the earth hear his voice. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people rejoice. Oh, come to the father through Jesus the son and give him the glory. Great things he has done. Before we sing the chorus again, I'm going to ask the deacons to come forward. We're going to receive an offering this evening again and tomorrow will be your tithes and offerings. This is for the expense of the camp. Bring us your speaker, brother Ron Spencer here and his wife. We're so happy to have them here. And I know that you want to play a part. I don't care what you give, but you open up your heart and say, "Lord, what would you have me to give?" God loves a cheerful giver. &gt;&gt; Are we cheerful givers tonight? Of course we are. You've been giving and giving of yourself. Amen. Let's just sing the chorus once again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the earth his voice. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people Oh, come to the father through Jesus the son and give him the glory. Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads as we ask God's blessing upon our giving. Dear heavenly father, we've taken these few extra moments to have another look at the miracle that you have done. We speak Lord of miracles of the past, but this is something that is current. This is something that is right before us. Here we had our brother Ron Spencer last year and shortly after that meeting he was struck down. We know that Satan tried to take his life. We're convinced of that. But we're more convinced that you stepped in the way and you refused it. You refused the enemy this advance. You stopped him in his tracks. YOU CAST HIM BACK AND YOU BROUGHT our brother out, oh God. And we're giving you praise. We're so thankful tonight that we're able to give in support of the great work of God. And Lord, as we seek to make this camp a facility, a place where the bride of Jesus Christ could come, Lord, Lord, I pray that you'll be pleased with everything that takes place here. Forgive us of our weaknesses and our wrongs. Oh Lord, if there's anything that would be displeasing to you, remove it from us, oh God. We just want you to be glorified and your name to be lifted up and that the kingdom of Christ Jesus will be advanced. We thank you now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats and the deacons move forward and and take up the offering. Brother Rod, I wonder if you could just sing a chorus with us. You do that. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Let's sing. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy name. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy bless his holy name. I will bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless his holy name. He has done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things. So many great things. He has done great things. Bless his holy holy. He's done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things. &gt;&gt; So many great things. &gt;&gt; He has done great things. Bless him. &gt;&gt; Well, I will bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me. Bless his holy. Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me. Blessings holy. Bless is holy. Sing it one more time. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me. Bless his holy bless his holy name. Oh, I will bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me. Amen. Brother Ron Spencer, a miracle of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And I know one I don't know all the reason God raised him off that bed you just saw. But I do know one major reason. That's so he could stand behind this pulpit tonight &gt;&gt; and speak words from God &gt;&gt; to your heart and soul. And we're here, &gt;&gt; are we not? We ready? &gt;&gt; Love the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; He's certainly good to us, isn't he? &gt;&gt; I would uh I would like to have my two sons to come up here tonight. I want to I want to show share them with you. This is brother Matthew here and brother Andrew. Brother Matthew was felt felt to come and see his daddy at about 9:30 almost 10 o'clock at night to bring sister Whitney some graph paper. Everything is predestinated by God. And brother Matthew had arrived just only seconds before the explosion. And I thank God for every pound of him. I had on bib overhauls and I fell in the explosion and and he literally said he just grabbed me like that and just tugged me and went running with me and probably my feet didn't even hit the ground. But without that, we know God is a miracle working God. And and God anointed him for that challenge of that moment. And uh Brother Andrew quickly moved quickly and got us to the rescue squad and got me in the in the truck. And so I want to give them a great big hand this evening. We have a young daughter here. She's 17 years old. She's not old enough to be available just yet, but she w she as well as my daughter-in-laws were at Sister Conniey's side 100% of the time. My daughter never flinched. Connie said she never never said a negative word. She said, "Daddy has preached to always think positive and say positive things." Sister Whitney, will you stand up just now? Amen. Let's give her a great big hand this evening. And the little lady that whispered in my ear and put Brother Brandham's voice in my ear for a coma for almost three weeks with doctors telling her her husband wouldn't go wouldn't make it. She had faith to believe that God's going to raise him up. &gt;&gt; That phone call, Brother Ed, was just life sustaining. You just don't know what that meant to us. Sister Connie, will you stand? We certainly love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. I learned never to play with matches again. Amen. We certainly thank the Lord for what he has done and and it those those horrid reminders of what we went through and uh we certainly thank the Lord that he has not only healed my body but he's healing my lungs and they have been quite a struggle. It destroyed about 75% of my lung capacity. But God is a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we just we just are so pleased that we can fulfill the vision of the word of the hour. And just as much as there was a silver tip grizzly bear and a 42in horns on an animal, I believe just as much as that same God spoke to brother Ed and said he will preach that meeting next year. &gt;&gt; The camp came, you came and I stand here tonight by the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To God be the glory. Hallelujah. To God be the &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your scriptures with me tonight to St. Luke chapter 4. St. Luke chapter 4. Last night I was up in the wee hours of the morning in prayer. The Lord just visited me in a special way and I want to thank him for that because he is the important one in this building. Yes. Amen. St. Luke chapter 4. And let's just talk to the author of this book and ask him to speak to our hearts. How many of you will ask him to come to your your seat tonight? Ask him to come right where you're at. He's a personal God. Hallelujah. Just as much as he's been personal to me over the last week and months and year, he's a real personal God to you. Lord Jesus, we love you. I stand nervously behind this desk tonight and I am aware that you saw this before the foundation of the world and you allowed brother Ed to see and sense certain things about this camp Lord about how it would be constructed and how it would be laid out and now how the speaker would who he would be and Satan would like to have forthed all of all of that. But Lord, you're a great God. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're alive and well tonight. We still have a report of an empty tomb. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight that you would come and and in the midst of this congregation &gt;&gt; and we're aware that you're here, &gt;&gt; Lord. Maybe it's not in our senses of of our flesh or even in our spirit, but Father, we're aware because your word says that you're here. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just have a super sense that just lets us know that you are in this building. And I pray that you would circumcise our hearts, our ears, our tongue tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you give us a temporary resurrection through which you can speak through us. And may we be a microphone and ears to hear your word and may you channel it towards our needs, our soul. And Lord, I pray that you would come and speak to us. May it be not the mind of a man, but may you speak to us tonight. We thank you for these things that you have laid upon my heart in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you. Amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; St. Luke chapter 4 and verse 16. This evening, I would like to look tonight at a released word. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. And there unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. And he has sent me to heal the to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he be to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." And all that bear him witness wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, "Is not this Joseph's son? and you may be seated this afternoon. We realize that words can have power that goes with them. We realize that every word is a seed of potential and when it it's released and and brother Brandham says certain light is released in every age and there's a certain amount of light that is released and and we realize that that many times as the prophets would speak maybe they did not understand what they were saying and and even when they were saying those words maybe inspiration would hit them and maybe they wouldn't understand it and maybe they would never see the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; Such as Psalms chapter 22 when he begins to proclaim out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou far from helping me and from the words of my roaring? Oh my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not. And in the night season, and am not silent, they g upon me, their mouths in a raver and a roaring line. I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax. It is melted in my of my boughs and my strength is dried up like a pop shear and the tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of the death. For dogs have compassed me. The the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet. And David didn't realize THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT CALVARY &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS PROJECTING THOSE VOICES. NOTICE AS ISAIAH, HE BEGINS TO BE INSPIRED. FOR UNTO US A SON, a child IS BORN. UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN. AND THE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE UPON his shoulder. And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE. &gt;&gt; Those words no doubt had been used many times before, but never in that collection or that gathering. But God in his great mind and all of his attributes knew what he was going to do upon the earth. So he allowed an ordained prophet, A PREDESTINATED PROPHET, an elected prophet to come on the scene at a certain season and he would come to a certain maturity in his life and he would stand under the inspiration OF GOD ENTRUSTED WITH A certain characteristic and he would begin to proceed things out of his lips and not even from his mind. UNTO US A CHILD is given. No doubt many of rabbi, many of priests would look at those scriptures and maybe take them for a text or a theme of a sermon. We're looking unto something. We're looking into a certain day. But brother Brandham said in Mary's belief he said on a certain day a rabbi stood up for to read and he said Joseph of Mary was sitting in the congregation and they begin to hear the words as it proceeded out of the rabbis out of the rabbi's mouth. Now once again these are powerful words and these words have circled the earth for hundreds of years and as they've circled the word the world for hundreds of years NO DOUBT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MEN THOUSANDS OF MEN HAVE UTTERED THESE WORDS. &gt;&gt; But on this day &gt;&gt; and at this season of time THIS MAN FEELS INSPIRED TO GO TO THIS passage of scripture. A SCRIPTURE THAT HAS INCREDIBLE POWER to it. And young lady SITTING IN THE CONGREGATION, HEARD THE WORD AND SOMETHING STRUCK INSIDE OF HER HEART. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT MANY WANTED TO BE THAT PART. MANY DESIRED TO BE THAT PART, BUT THERE WAS ONE PREDESTINATED WOMB THAT WOULD FULFILL THAT PART. Brother Brandham said the next day she at that afternoon said they'd went home and they pulled out the scripture and they rolled the scroll out and they read it again and IT SAID AS THEY SAT THERE in the evening sun was going down they begin to think on these things and something just burned within her heart. &gt;&gt; He said it WAS ON THE NEXT DAY THAT AN ANGEL came and met her. &gt;&gt; We believe that don't we? Because we too live in another age. &gt;&gt; Not only did Mary get an angelic visitation, &gt;&gt; but I have received an angelic visitation. &gt;&gt; Before the great AND THE DREADFUL DAY OF the Lord, hallelujah, God sent Ron Spencer, an angel. Are you with me now? There they sat in the tabernacle in the synagogue. And no doubt as Jesus as his custom was, he went to church and he opened up the scripture word because in the beginning was the word &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and it dwelt among us &gt;&gt; and he opened the word and he looked for his part to read &gt;&gt; and he be to read the scriptures of which he is going to fulfill. And he begins to read, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind, to sit at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." And he be to say once he closed this book, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears." &gt;&gt; SOME SAID, "THIS IS JOSEPH'S SON." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THEY HAD LOOKED FOR IT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THEY HAD WANTED THIS TIME, &gt;&gt; BUT IT DIDN'T COME THE WAY THAT THEY thought it would come. How powerful her words. &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln was in New Orleans and as he was standing beside a boat that was people to be sold. He watched an incredible scene that would have a great effect in his life. I was actually going to go to the quote that brother Ed just read. I'll leave it alone. It's incredible powerful. I like how God does business. &gt;&gt; But he was molded by two books, Pilgrim's Progress and the Bible. And with that kind of character standing there, he had lost 11 o times to win a public office. But God wasn't done because he failed 11 times. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I FAILED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN." GOD'S NOT FINISHED. JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED a few times in your life. And he stood beside THAT BOAT AND HE WATCHED PEOPLE be sold. AND HE SAID, "NO MAN SHOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD into slavery. We're all created equal." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Brown, white, black, yellow, we're all equal." &gt;&gt; We all came from Adam. Hey, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND TONIGHT here he stood and SOMETHING BOSOMED INTO HIS HEART and he said, "IF IT COST ME MY BLOOD, I'M GOING TO PUT A STOP TO THIS." &gt;&gt; This country became in a great crisis. It became in a split. And we recognized that Abraham Lincoln one day was to go and make a speech. And as he was on his train ride to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, there was a man that stood in front of him AND PREACHED. HE SPOKE FOR TWO HOURS, A GREAT ORATOR. He was called one of the greatest orators of the whole day. And as HE STOOD THERE THAT DAY, HE BEGAN TO PREACH. As he began to speak, excuse me, AND HE SPOKE FOR TWO HOURS. Nobody hardly remembers anything that he had to say, nor do they even remember his name. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MAN HAD PRAYED ON THE WAY IN that train and it HAS SPOKEN THAT HE HE DIDN'T have anything on his heart you know that you know that would move and he's PRAYED UNTO GOD HELP ME &gt;&gt; GOD INSPIRE me &gt;&gt; and HE STEPPED TO THE PODIUM THAT DAY A TALL slender man of face with rugged and chisel look AND HE STEPPED TO THAT PULL PIT, THAT PODIUM THAT DAY. AND SURE, THERE WERE PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FELT THE SAME WAY HE DID and said the same THINGS THAT HE DID. BUT THIS MAN WAS ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; This man was elected. &gt;&gt; THIS MAN WAS PLACED TO COME TO THAT POSITION. AND WHEN HE STEPPED TO THE PODIUM THAT DAY, THE WORLD DIDN'T RECOGNIZE WHAT KIND OF POWER THAT THIS MAN HAD WHEN HE SPOKE THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. &gt;&gt; Though short, though quick, it was powerful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a man that was inspired in our day. His name was Martin Luther King. This man had a vision. He had a dream. And as like him or don't like him or or those things, brother Ram had many different things to say about him. But this man had something that was inspired in his soul. And he began to speak it forth because not all of us could drink at the same water fountain. Not all of us could drink and eat at the same restaurant. Not all of us could to stay at the same motel. But this man had a vision THAT IT SHOULDN'T stay that way. &gt;&gt; And so HE BEGIN TO PROJECT THIS VISION out that I have a dream. &gt;&gt; I have dream &gt;&gt; that we can all be free. &gt;&gt; WE CAN ALL ENJOY FREEDOMS. AND HE BE TO SPEAK THIS OUT. AND THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUR NATION INSIDE OUT FOR QUITE A WHILE, IT BEGIN TO IT BE TO HAVE POWER. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT BE TO CAUSE US TO COME TO GRIP WITH OUR FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THOSE WORDS COMING FROM THAT MAN'S LIPS HAD INCREDIBLE POWER. &gt;&gt; And as you BEGIN TO SPEAK IT FORTH, I HAVE BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. I HAVE LOOKED OUT OVER THE OTHER SIDE. And he began to project a vision to people. You see, he wasn't the only voice of this day. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I have laid my foundation. When Jesus was standing there and he said, "My job is to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. to set at liberty them that are captive. &gt;&gt; I have came to heal the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand every devil that had challenged him at the mount of temptation knew when he echoed these things out of his lips. &gt;&gt; We have trouble now. &gt;&gt; A lot OF PEOPLE HAD QUOTED THESE WORDS. A lot of people HAD ALLOWED THOSE WORDS TO COME OFF OF THEIR LIPS. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A MAN. &gt;&gt; There had never been a man &gt;&gt; THAT HAD STOOD TO HIS FEET &gt;&gt; AND SAID THESE WORDS WITH NOT ONLY POWER &gt;&gt; BUT SAME VOICE SAID, "LET THERE BE A SUN, MOON, AND STARS." &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS A SUN, MOON, AND STARS. THE SAME VOICE HAD SAID, ABRAHAM, I'M GOING TO HAVE A COVENANT BETWEEN YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'M GOING TO RESTORE YOUR BODY. I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM ABRAM TO ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOUR WIFE'S NAME FROM SARAH TO SARAH, AND SHE'S GOING TO BE A PRINCESS WITH GOD. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROMISED SON, ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; AND HIS NAME IS GOING TO BE ISAAC. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME VOICE SPOKE TO NOAH, BUILD AN ARK. IT WAS THAT VOICE THAT WAS INSIDE OF THAT BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It would CHANGE THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN AT THE WELL. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD CHANGE THE life of Legion. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD CHANGE THE LIFE OF LAZARUS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DEATH WOULD NEVER BE LOOKED AT EVER THE SAME ONCE JESUS came to Lazarus's tomb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who was his biggest critic? Preachers. &gt;&gt; Who is the biggest critics OF THE SON OF MAN AGAIN TODAY? PREACHERS. THEY BROUGHT HIM A WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT IN ADULTERY. &gt;&gt; LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; He said woman, he looked at all OF THEM THAT HE THAT IS WITHOUT sin &gt;&gt; cast the first stone &gt;&gt; because brother Ram says that NO MORTAL CAN STAND BEFORE another mortal IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND CONDEMN HIM. That's a powerful. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; No mortal can stand before another mortal &gt;&gt; IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND CONDEMN HIM. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; AND JESUS BOWED ON HIS KNEES AND HE SAID, "HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN, CAST THE FIRST STONE." And he be to write into the sand. And the scripture said that they WERE CONVICTED &gt;&gt; BY THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE. &gt;&gt; THE PRESENCE OF GOD, THEY WITH THEIR TURNAROUND CLOAKS and they're holier than holy. &gt;&gt; LOOK TO THEM NOW. THE PRESENCE OF GOD BEGINS TO DEAL ON THEIR hearts &gt;&gt; and THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A CONDITION WE CAN'T THROW A STONE. AND JESUS LOOKED AT THE WOMAN, "WERE THINE ACCUSERS? I HAVE NONE. I have not. &gt;&gt; NEITHER DO I CONDEMN. THEY GO AND SIN NO MORE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JESUS WAS NOT A REHABILITATION CENTER. &gt;&gt; He was not a consultant service. &gt;&gt; But when THEY CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; the woman AT THE WELL WAS NO LONGER A PROSTITUTE. THE WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT IN ADULTERY WAS NO LONGER A HARLOT. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY FOUND PETER, HE WAS NAKED and cursing. BUT WHEN JESUS GOT A HOLD OF HIM, HE WAS A KIND OF DISCIPLE THAT COULD BE THE SPOKESMAN ON ACTS CHAPTER 2. &gt;&gt; What kind of a man was this? &gt;&gt; Zachchariah said, "Oh, rejoice greatly, oh daughter of Zion. &gt;&gt; Shout, oh daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king cometh unto thee. He is just, and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an ass, upon the colt, the fo of an ass. Psalms 11:18 says, "He is the stone which the builders refuse, has become the head of the corner." This is the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Save now I beseech thee, oh Lord. Oh Lord, I beseech thee send thou th now prosperity. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. WE HAVE BLESSED YOU, OH HOUSE OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Just the titles of our Lord Jesus. He was the anointed. He was beginning and the end of the creation of God. He was our blessed. HE WAS OUR BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; He is the bread of life. &gt;&gt; He is the I am that I am. &gt;&gt; He is the CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOPE. &gt;&gt; He is the CHIEF CORNERSTONE. &gt;&gt; HE IS THE COMMANDER. He is THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. HE IS THE CORNERSTONE. HE IS OUR COUNSELOR. &gt;&gt; Every word of THESE WORDS HAS INCREDIBLE POWER. HOW MUCH WHEN MOSES WALKED IN, HE TURNED THE KINGDOM UPSIDE DOWN BY JUST SAYING, "I AM THAT I AM." &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Love the Lord. &gt;&gt; He is the heir of all things. HE IS THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN. &gt;&gt; HE IS JEHOVAH'S FELLOW. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE IS JESUS THE CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I want to kind of quickly turn towards you just now. Behold, I send you &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet &gt;&gt; before THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND THE dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Revelation chapter 3 said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock, and if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into HIM AND WILL SUCK WITH him and he with me &gt;&gt; to him that overcomemeth." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. JESUS HAD TO LOOK AT THE WORD AND SEE WHAT IT SAID ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; I'D GOT TO LOOK AT THE WORD AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; To Ron Spencer that overcometh &gt;&gt; in 2008, &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GRANT TO SIT WITH ME IN MY THRONE EVEN AS I HAVE OVERCAME AND I'M SAT down &gt;&gt; with my father in his throne. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? Brother Brandham said, "I WAS INSPIRED TO TAKE UP MY PEN and write." &gt;&gt; Now, remember, he's God's prophet. So, he's beginning to write down words that are going to release power. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Listen closely. Here's what I picked up my pen for." He said, "Did you see, friends, this I have stood the way that I have and I why I'm a contending." He says, "And get away from the denominations and the real CHURCH OF GOD." HE SAID, "SEE WHY IT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF THE WORD? It can't COME FROM THE WISDOM OF MAN. IT'S GOT TO COME BY THE WORD OF GOD. That's the reason I believe the WORD JUST THE WAY it's written. I won't add nothing to it or TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM IT. JUST PREACH IT THAT WAY AND JUST KEEP it going." He said, HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY TO YOU. THE LAW OF REPRODUCTION BRINGS FORTH KIND after kind. SO IF GOD WANTS TO REPRODUCE HORSES, &gt;&gt; he has horses. IF HE REPRODUCES COWS, HE HAS COWS. &gt;&gt; If he REPRODUCES CAMELS, HE REPRODUCES CAMELS. SO WHEN HE WANTS TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF HERE IN THIS LEOTAN AGE, &gt;&gt; HE REPRODUCES MINIATURE GODS UPON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Messiah on the earth. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE IMPORTANT PART OF YOU TONIGHT IS THAT LITTLE SPOT THAT IS DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU &gt;&gt; THAT BECOMES IGNITED BY THE HOLY GHOST. AND ONCE IGNITED, IT'LL SET THE WORLD ON FIRE. BROTHER SAID, "GOD'S STRATEGY IS EMPTY THE WORLD OUT OF YOU AND FILL YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND THEN SHAKE THE THE WHOLE WORLD with it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said the law of reproduction brings forth kind of his kind. These last days, I suppose that would be these days. &gt;&gt; These last days. If you don't think we're in the last days, just pay attention to the news for five minutes. &gt;&gt; Earthquakes, &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah, &gt;&gt; governments are falling, BANKS ARE FALLING, MONEY IS FALLING, &gt;&gt; jobs are falling, &gt;&gt; education's at its end. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, I'M IN MY SECURITY ZONE. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. MONEY'S NOT YOUR SECURITY. That's right. COME ON. &gt;&gt; JOBS IS NOT YOUR SECURITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS OUT THERE ARE NOT YOUR SECURITY BLANKET. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE REFUGE WE CAN RUN TO TONIGHT, AND THAT IS INTO JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm not planning on staying here for THE TRIBULATION PERIOD. I'M PLANNING ON TAKING A RAPTURE. WE HAVE A WORD THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THIS EVENING. NOW, &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT RELEASED BY THE MIND of a man. BROTHER SAID, "YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE WORD, THE MIND OF A MAN. YOU'RE FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS WAS NOT THIS IS NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S MESSAGE. THIS WAS GOD'S MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S WIFE. WE'RE GOD'S WIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE THAT IS BEHIND THE VOICE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LAMBS WHEN THAT ANGEL SCREAMED, "WHO IS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK?" &gt;&gt; LISTEN, OUR NAMES WERE WRITTEN IN THAT BOOK. &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU WERE 50 YEARS OLD AND 80 YEARS OLD, AND SOME OF YOU ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT 12 AND 15 YEARS OLD. BUT THE LAMB STEPPED FORTH AND TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU. WHEN YOU COULDN'T REDEEM YOURSELF, HE STEPPED FORTH FOR THE TITLE D BOOK. &gt;&gt; NOW, the accuser of the brethren had wrote a lot of things down that was against you. &gt;&gt; But I want to remind you, HE'S A LIAR. HE IS A PERVERTER. &gt;&gt; He has perverted this world. He has perverted the theology. &gt;&gt; HE HAS TRANSFORMED HIMSELF AS AN ANGEL OF LIES. HE'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PREACHERS THAT THERE IS IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. &gt;&gt; He preached in Eden. HE HAS PREACHED IN SATAN'S EDEN. &gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BELIEVE HIS LIE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the Lord? Tonight, &gt;&gt; he said these last days, the true church bride comes to the headstone will be A SUPER CHURCH, &gt;&gt; A SUPER RACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, there's been brides brides. &gt;&gt; There's been a lot of wannabes. You remember what I said when we first started out? A lot of people SAID THE SAME THING ISAIAH DID. &gt;&gt; A lot of rabbis got up and read. &gt;&gt; A lot of men said, "I'm the Christ." &gt;&gt; But there was one coming. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PREACHERS SAYS, "I'M I'M I'M Malachi 45 and six." A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT I'M THE PROPHET OF THE LAST DAYS, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE HAD ONE. &gt;&gt; When he STOOD AT THE HOUSTON DEBATE AND THE ANGEL SAID, "GO ON DOWN." &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL WAS CHALLENGING HIM THERE THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; God likes a challenge. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE STOOD THERE THAT DAY AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER KEPT CLICKING. BUT GOD WANTED HIS PICTURE TAKEN. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED HIS WIFE TO HAVE HIS PICTURE. &gt;&gt; He wanted US TO BE ABLE TO HANG HIS PICTURE IN OUR CHURCHES, &gt;&gt; in our homes, in our bedrooms, in our living rooms, carried around in our billfolds. THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A lot of people WANT TO SHOW THEIR FAMILY ALBUM. I'VE GOT A FAMILY ALBUM, &gt;&gt; not only of the earthly, BUT I'VE GOT ONE OF THE HEAVENLY AS WELL. I HAVE MY PICTURE OF MY HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm excited. Listen, when these words are projected, NO DOUBT SATAN WAS WATCHING THESE WORDS. NO DOUBT HE HAD WALKED INTO THE METHODIST camp meetings and the Baptist camp meetings and the Pentecostal camp meetings &gt;&gt; and he had heard their voices &gt;&gt; and they had had their revivals in their day &gt;&gt; and he had HAD TO BRING IN PERVERSION. SO HE ONCE AGAIN TRIES TO COME AND PERVER PERVERT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS A BRIDE ON THE SINK &gt;&gt; THAT REFUSES THE THE PERVERSION. &gt;&gt; SHE SAYS, "GIVE IT TO ME PURE. I CAN HANDLE IT." &gt;&gt; GIVE IT TO ME PURE. I CAN HANDLE IT. HE SAYS THEY WILL LOVE HIM AND HAVE HIS POTENTIALS &gt;&gt; FOR FOR HE IS THEIR HEAD AND THEY ARE HIS SUBJECT SUBJECT TO THE HEAD SUBJECT TO THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him first. &gt;&gt; It's just like this. Sometimes we just need to be very careful, be very confident in what God is doing. No wonder Brother Brandon could be so confident and say, "Write this down on the fly leaf of your Bible." And two years later, he'd be on the Russian Finnish border. As I said last night standing there, "You call me a false prophet if this little boy is not off of the ground in five minutes. There's not another preacher in the whole world &gt;&gt; that will say that. &gt;&gt; I challenge you. There's not another preacher in the whole world &gt;&gt; that will say that. &gt;&gt; But it was the SAME KIND OF VOICE THAT SPOKE TO THE SEA. &gt;&gt; And they SAID, "NEVER A MAN SPAKE LIKE THIS MAN." IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF VOICE THAT SPOKE TO LAZARUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW HE'S HERE IN BRIDE FORM. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, I'M GOING TO BIND IN HEAVEN. WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH, I'M going to loose in heaven. &gt;&gt; And if ye abide in me and my WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE DONE UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; WHO YOU TALKING TO, BROTHER RON? YOU WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR KNEES, &gt;&gt; YOU SHAKE THE KINGDOMS OF HELL. &gt;&gt; What was he trying TO DO TO ME? SHUT ME UP. &gt;&gt; CUZ SATAN DON'T LIKE SERMONS LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; WHY WAS HE TRYING TO BUY BROTHER BRANDHAM OFF? CUZ HE DIDN'T LIKE SERPENT SEAT. &gt;&gt; He didn't LIKE TO BE EXPOSED. HE DIDN'T LIKE REVELATION 17 BEING OPENED UP WHO THE MOTHER OF HARLOT IS. &gt;&gt; THAT GREAT HERSELF. OH, MOTHER ROME. &gt;&gt; But that didn't bother the church WORLD SO MUCH UNTIL HE PREACHED WHY I'M AGAINST DENOMINATIONS. &gt;&gt; AND HE OPENED HIS LITTLE BIBLE AND HE OPENED UP TO READ. NO DOUBT THE DEVIL THOUGHT WHEN HE BE TO SPEAK THOSE WORDS ACROSS THE PULLPIT, I HAVE TROUBLE. I have trouble &gt;&gt; when he preaches sermons like blasphemous names. &gt;&gt; I have trouble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope he SAYS THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. WHEN you roll out of bed in the morning &gt;&gt; and you open your little eyelids and you roll up OUT OF BED AND YOU'RE STANDING ON THE FLOOR AND YOU SAY, "THANK YOU, JESUS, FOR ANOTHER DAY." &gt;&gt; When you recognize that you will not sit HERE TO BE TORMENTED BY THE DEVIL, BUT YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD?" NOT WILL BE, may be, someday might be, SOME DREAM SOMEWHERE OTHER. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE recognized &gt;&gt; that WE ARE THE VERY SPOKEN WORD OF GOD, THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD, THE PHYSICAL LIVING ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ON THE EARTH. AND HERE WE STAND. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE ONE OF GOD'S THOUGHTS? HERE IT IS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE IN VICTORY TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE HOUSES ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD THAT HE THOUGHT OF BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you shouldn't get so excited. People can go to a ball game &gt;&gt; and they will jump, shout, jump all over themselves. &gt;&gt; They'll take their coats OFF AND STAND IN sub-zero degree weather. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL BEAT EACH OTHER OVER THE HEAD. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL SCREAM TO THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL BE HORSEARO ON MONDAY MORNING. They'll spend all their money on the weekends. &gt;&gt; THEY GET SO EXCITED. THEY'RE SO THRILLED. &gt;&gt; WE COME TO CHURCH. THIS IS THE ETERNAL PART. &gt;&gt; When a guy RUNS A TOUCHDOWN, IT DOESN'T SAVE ME ONE BIT. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T BOTHER MY SLEEP EITHER WAY. WHEN A GUY HITS A THREEPOINT CONVERSION OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THAT THING, IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ONE LITTLE BIT. WHEN TIGER WOODS GETS A HOLE IN ONE, THAT DOESN'T EXCITE ME ONE LITTLE BIT. BUT WHEN I GET TO THINKING ABOUT JESUS, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BROTHER ROD, THAT'S WHAT WE SING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT WE PRAISE THE LORD ABOUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE DID AT THE WOMAN AT THE WELL. I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE DID THROUGH COLUMBUS DAY AND IREINIUS'S DAY. AND I TELL YOU, I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE DID WITH MARTIN LUTHER AND JOHN WESLEY. BUT I'M SO THANKFUL. &gt;&gt; I am so thankful. &gt;&gt; HE IS MY HUSBAND AND I WANT TO WORSHIP HIM. HE WAS ANOINTED ABOVE ALL THE FELLOWS. &gt;&gt; ALL THE PROPHETS HAD TO STAND THERE. NONE OF THEM COULD SAVE YOU AND I. MOSES COULDN'T SAVE ME. &gt;&gt; MOSES, AS POWERFUL AS HE WAS, HE COULDN'T SAVE ME. &gt;&gt; JONAH COULDN'T SAVE ME. LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM COULDN'T SAVE ME. &gt;&gt; BUT ONE STEP FROM THE MIDST OF THE THRONE, A lamb. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I can hear THE NOISE GOING DOWN THROUGH THE STREETS. AN OLD CROSS BEATING ON THE COBBLESTONES. Bump bump bump bump bump down THROUGH THERE." HE SAID, "I CAN SEE HIS HIS ROBE." AND HE SAID, "IT STARTS OUT LITTLE BITTY SPOTS." HE SAID, "BUT THOSE SPOTS BEGIN TO GET BIGGER AND THEY GET BIGGER." HE'S STRUGGLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; He's struggling. &gt;&gt; No doubt. THERE WAS ANGELS SCREAMING, "JUST SPEAK TO US. &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK TO US. &gt;&gt; JUST NOD YOUR HEAD. I'LL CHANGE THE SCENE." &gt;&gt; LITTLE KIDS RAN OUT AND SPIT IN HIS FACE. THEY SPIT, BROTHER SAID, UNTIL IT RAN THROUGH HIS BEARD and ran off of him. But he was determined. &gt;&gt; Determined. &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "He was wounded for my transgressions. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BRUISED FOR MY INIQUITIES." &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY TIED HIM TO THAT BEATING BLOCK THAT DAY, &gt;&gt; HE WAS DETERMINED. WHEN RON SPENCER WAS GOING TO BE IN A BURN UNIT. I'M GONNA HEAL HIM. &gt;&gt; I'M GONNA HEAL HIM. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO WALK INTO HIS BURN ROOM UNIT. &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU CAN'T DO IT. I'M GOING TO WALK IN THERE. THE DOCTORS WON'T SEE ME. THE NURSES WON'T SEE ME. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean his lungs up. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO DESTROY HIM, BUT HE'S MY SON. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HEAL HIS HANDS TO WHERE THEY HOLD THEY WORK COMPLETELY. I'M GOING TO HEAL HIS ARMS. I'M GOING TO HEAL HIS FACE TO WHERE HE WON'T EVEN HAVE A SPLOTCH ON IT. &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU FOUL BREATH DEVIL. &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL ROOM. &gt;&gt; GEORGIA CARTER WAS RINGING HER WAS RINGING ALL THE STAIN OFF THE BED POST AND SHE WAS CRYING OUT TO GOD. AND WHEN THOSE DEVILS WERE BEATING ON HIS BODY, HE SAID, "GEORGIA, I'M GOING TO HEAL YOU." &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HEAL YOU. &gt;&gt; FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE, NO DOUBT, NO DOCTORS COULD HELP HER, BUT HE WAS SAYING, "FLORENCE, I'm going to heal you." &gt;&gt; Daddy, when you had cancer A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU GOT TO HAVE AN OPERATION." WHEN HE WHEN THEY WAS BEATING ON MY LORD, HE SAID, "CHARLIE, I've healed you. &gt;&gt; I'VE HEALED YOU, CHARLIE. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, when you crinkle that neck over and you feel the pain, &gt;&gt; he said, "Eddie, I've healed you. &gt;&gt; I've healed you. &gt;&gt; Tom, I've healed you. &gt;&gt; I've healed you. I healed you. I healed you. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER, I DOUBT THAT." WAIT JUST A MINUTE. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU COULDN'T GET LAZARUS TO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WASN'T A HEALER. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN JESUS IS NOT A HEALER? I JUST GOT RESURRECTED FROM A GRAVE. I WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH ABRAHAM, ISAAC, and Jacob the other day. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I was shaking their hands. &gt;&gt; I WAS SHAKING THEIR HANDS AND THEY WAS TELLING ME ABOUT MELAZDC WHEN HE CAME AND HE SPOKE TO HIM UNDER AN OAK TREE. WE HAD MEAT AND DRANK MILK AND HE SPOKE A VOICE AND IT CHANGED MY BODY. I HEARD A VOICE. &gt;&gt; LAZARUS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT KNOWS MY VOICE, BUT THAT'S A VOICE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A VOICE I COULD NEVER FORGET. &gt;&gt; LAZARUS, COME FORTH. The next thing I knew, I WAS WRAPPED IN GRAVE CLOTHES. I DON'T NEED GRAVE CLOTHES NO MORE. &gt;&gt; I don't need A BURN CENTER NO MORE. &gt;&gt; I don't need lung THERAPY NO MORE. &gt;&gt; HE'S A HEALER. Maybe you're sitting HERE TONIGHT AND THE DOCTOR'S TOLD YOU that the cancer is going to heat you up and you're going to die. YOU LOOK AT THAT DEVIL SAY YOU ARE A LIAR. &gt;&gt; Arthritis is eating you up. You look at that rascal tonight and tell him it's a demon out of hell &gt;&gt; and I don't have to put UP WITH YOU. HALLELUJAH. SHAMGAR ONE DAY REALIZED, I AM A SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I don't HAVE TO PUT UP WITH YOU NO LONGER. &gt;&gt; I told you Satan was in for trouble tonight. I was going to go a complete different way and God dealt with me last night to go this way. &gt;&gt; What are you doing, Ron? I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm doing what Papa said for me to do. I'm going to release some words &gt;&gt; and you're going to hear some words. &gt;&gt; And you're going to say, "I'm getting UP OUT OF THIS BED." &gt;&gt; There might be somebody on the internet TONIGHT THAT IS CLOSED IN a room somewhere another. And God is speaking to their life right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, Brother Ron, THIS WAS A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE BROKE YOUR LEGS, BUT GOD IS STILL THE HEALER. &gt;&gt; You may HAVE BROKE YOUR ARMS, BUT GOD IS STILL THE HEALER. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says this, "I now challenge the devil to a debate. &gt;&gt; Satan, you are aware that you are whipped. &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights. Jesus Christ, my Lord, STRIPPED YOU OF EVERY AUTHORITY YOU HAD WHEN HE DIED AT CALVARY TO TAKE AWAY SINS. &gt;&gt; And you're nothing but a bluff. AND WE'RE CALLING YOUR BLUFF. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW that when our LORD CAME TO TO THE TREE, HE CURSED THE TREE. THE next day it was withering. AND OUR LORD SAID HIS TO HIS DISCIPLES, "HAVE FAITH IN GOD. FOR HE SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN, BE THOU REMOVED. DON'T DOUBT IN YOUR HEART, BUT BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. IT IS COMING TO PASS. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JUST TO THE DISCIPLES. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "WHEN GOD GIVES YOU, WHEN YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN, GOD GIVES YOU A CHECKBOOK &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS UNLIMITED FUNDS. Let me explain to you unlimited. &gt;&gt; Tom looks over at Sister Joanne and HE SAYS, "GO SPEND WHAT YOU WANT." AND SISTER JOANNE GOES WITH SISTER LINDA AND THEY GO ON a buying spree. THEY BUY THREE CADILLACS, TWO TOYOTAS, and four Mercedes-Benz. And they come back IN AND THEY SAY, "HONEY, we're so sorry, but we just got excited." &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR SPENDING. I seen you there. &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Don't you pay no attention to this. &gt;&gt; It is we who limit God. &gt;&gt; WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; NEVER HAVE A NEGATIVE THOUGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER HAVE a negative thought. &gt;&gt; Paul was building, THEY WERE BUILDING A CHOP BLOCK OUT THERE AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BOY? WE'RE GOING TO CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF." IT IS. I HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT. I FINISHED MY COURSE. &gt;&gt; I have kept THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT FOR? YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. OH, DEATH. THAT LITTLE OLD HOOK KNOWS YOU. I KNOW YOU. I BEAT YOU TO PIECES. I BEAT YOU WITH STRIPES. THEY DID THIS OR THAT TO YOU, BUT I'VE GOT YOU NOW. He looked at death and he said, "DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING AT? GREAT. WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY AT? &gt;&gt; HENCE WHAT YOUR ATTITUDE IS TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYS WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT. BUT I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE OTHER SIDE. YOU MIGHT BE HEADED OVER THE PASTOR'S HOUSE, GOING DOWN THE ROAD SOMEWHERE ANOTHER, AND A TINY LITTLE LIGHT COMES DOWN. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, IT'S BEEN SPOKE AND IT WILL COME TO PASS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHANGED IN THE MOMENT, AND THE TWINKLING of an eye. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's preaching. IT'S NOT JUST WORDS. SHE'LL BE BONE OF HIS BONE. SHE'LL BE LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE'LL BE POWER OF HIS POWER. SHE'LL BE SPIRIT OF THE SPIRIT. HEY, IT'S GOING TO COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. &gt;&gt; Them ain't good motivational words. &gt;&gt; That's just truth. You'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; You'll fill out a check one DAY AND SAY, "GOD, I need a job." And you'll fill out a check and you'll send it through the bank of heaven and it never comes back in sufficient funds. I said TONIGHT IT NEVER COMES back in sufficient funks. &gt;&gt; You may have TO WAIT TWO DAYS, 5 DAYS, 10 YEARS, 25 YEARS. But I got news FOR YOU. ONE DAY IT CASTES THROUGH THE BANK OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY UNTO THAT MOUNTAIN, BE THOU REMOVED AND CAST INTO THE SEA. WHEN YOU SPEAK IT, ONE GRAIN OF SAND ROLLS OVER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I GOT NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT. NO WEAPON THAT IS FORMED AGAINST ME IS GOING TO PROSPER. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY, JUST START QUOTING THE WORD TO HIM BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST SUPERNATURAL THING ABOUT YOUR WHOLE BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JESUS SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN." OH, LITTLE BRIDE, TONIGHT, IF WE COULD ONLY SAY, "IT is written. It is written. It is written. &gt;&gt; THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM." Call Sister Connie. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Ed. Right there in a coma condition, Brother Ed says, "You're going to preach AT 2008 BIBLE Way Campground. How does all that work, brother Ron? Believer &gt;&gt; plus faith in the word &gt;&gt; UTTERS IT ACROSS THE LIPS. NOW, ONCE IT IS RELEASED, &gt;&gt; once it's released, &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A DEVIL IN HELL, &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN CANADA, &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN ZIMBABWE, &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN ARGENTINA, AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to call out some champions tonight. &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN LOUISIANA, &gt;&gt; New New Orleans, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I wish I could stand here and preach. BUT ONCE HE UTTERED IT, &gt;&gt; she believed it. &gt;&gt; SHE TRANSFERRED IT INTO MY EARS. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A SEED DOWN INSIDE OF THERE THAT DON'T NEED TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A COMA. &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD JUST SAID, "GO AHEAD AND REST A LITTLE BIT, SON. YOU NEED A COUPLE WEEKS OFF. YOU THINK GOD GETS EXCITED? PETER DONE PREACHED ALL DAY LONG. HE DIDN'T GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, SO HE HAD HIM ARRESTED. &gt;&gt; PUT HIM IN JAIL. &gt;&gt; LAID HIM BETWEEN SOLDIERS. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT CANCER. GOD DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT YOUR CRISIS. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GETS EXCITED. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GETS TORE ALL THE PIECES. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT CRIES, "OH, GOD'S FORSAKEN ME." GOD'S GOT YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. I feel like I could just take a take a walk. &gt;&gt; I feel like I could walk RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I FEEL LIKE MY BODY'S GETTING READY TO TAKE A CHANGE FOR SURE. &gt;&gt; In one ear, the devil saying, "You don't know what you're doing. We're going to come after you." So, so Goliath was a champion of champions. &gt;&gt; Some of you had some Goliaths to come to your house, too. &gt;&gt; Scream in your ears &gt;&gt; and you watch people around you just tremble on shake. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GOLIATH'S BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS? THERE WAS A GUY CAME on the scene &gt;&gt; THAT WAS PREDESTINATED &gt;&gt; TO TAKE HIS HEAD OFF. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT SATAN'S PROBLEM IS IN SATAN'S EDEN? He has created Hollywood. &gt;&gt; He has created devils for politicians. &gt;&gt; HE HAS CREATED SODOM AND GOMORRAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAS CREATED EVERY JOB. HE HAS CREATED EVERY MODERN DAY CHURCH THAT YOU CAN HAVE. &gt;&gt; BUT HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THERE IS A BRIDE THAT'S ON THE EARTH. The song says, "I'M SO GLAD I GOT IN THIS ARMY AT A GOOD TIME." &gt;&gt; WE HAVE LEGAL POSSESSION BY JESUS CHRIST. EVERY BELIEVER IN HERE HAS A BANK BOOK FROM A DEPOSIT THAT WAS MADE AT CALVARY IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THERE'S WHERE HE BEAT SATAN TO PIECES. &gt;&gt; HE BEAT SATAN TO PIECES. &gt;&gt; We charge Satan. Thou devil. Thou incriminating evil power that's BOUND THESE PEOPLE THAT'S DONE this evil. YOU HAVE LOST THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM RIGHT THERE FROM YOUR LIPS, YOU'RE A LOSER. &gt;&gt; Smile at him. &gt;&gt; You're a loser, devil. You're nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE CALLING YOUR HAND TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU EVIL SPIRIT, TURN THESE PEOPLE LOOSE. &gt;&gt; WE CHARGE THEE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST THAT EVERY DOUBT WILL BE SWEPT AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE TONIGHT. THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL COME AND SWEEP INTO THEIR BODIES AND SET EVERY ONE OF THEM FREE FROM SICKNESSES, &gt;&gt; from evil powers. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, I'M HAVING MARRIAGE PROBLEMS. JUST TELL HIM, "Get out." &gt;&gt; Get out. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WELCOME IN MY HOME. &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER RON, MY SON, HE'S GONE AWAY. DON'T YOU GIVE UP. DON'T YOU NEVER NEVER NEVER GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; You speak the word tonight. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEND THE HOLY GHOST, GOD'S AGENT, &gt;&gt; TO GO AFTER THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY MIGHT BE IN A BARROOM SOMEWHERE ANOTHER OR WITH SOME STRANGE WOMAN SOMEWHERE ANOTHER.

He looked at that stuff over top of eyes. &gt;&gt; Maybe not be a person in this building got it on, but I don't preach it anyway. &gt;&gt; They paint up paint up like a baboon. &gt;&gt; EVEN GRANDMAS STARTED PAINTING UP LIKE A BABOON. &gt;&gt; GOT A TATTOO ON THE LEG.

Brother Ron, I'm going to GO AWAY ON A TWO-WAY HOLIDAY. I'M GOING TO LET MY HAIR DOWN. GOD GOES WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE ALONE. &gt;&gt; CHARACTER IS WHAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE. AND IT'S ALSO WHAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF. ANY OLD HALF HYPOCRITE CAN LIVE RIGHT HERE IN CAMP. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU GO BACK HOME? BROTHER RON, I GO BACK HOME TO AN UNBELIEVING FAMILY. YOU GO IN THERE AND LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, "I DON'T WATCH THEM THINGS NO MORE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T LISTEN TO THAT KIND OF MUSIC NO MORE." &gt;&gt; YOU MAY ACTUALLY SURPRISE YOURSELF AND GET YOUR FAMILY SAVED.

I give you the Two things I like to say to this waiting congregation, this praising congregation this evening. Our Lord Jesus Christ is pleased. Almighty God is pleased when we worship him. He's an object of worship. &gt;&gt; He created angels to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the greatest thing we can do in life is give him praise. &gt;&gt; Not just from our lips, but from our lives. We give him praise. &gt;&gt; We sat here this evening and we heard the sound. They heard a sound of a miracle. Our God is a miracle working God. Our God is not human. He's supernatural. &gt;&gt; He's almighty. He's not limited. Whatever he chooses to do tonight and whatever he has chosen to do, &gt;&gt; we want to be very careful that we come back and give him thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Give him what's due to him. It's not a labor. It's not difficult. It's not something a preacher has to force or excite you to do it. It's something that's in your soul. I've come back to give you thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Our brother Ron is gone now back. I want to say to you, it's not just a miracle from last September till now. Brother Brandon when he told of supernatural things of the boy in Finland being raised from the dead and other great things that took place in a sister in their own area that had cancer in the heart and was healed was supposed to been gone and lived for many many many years. He told those over and over and over again. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S NOT IN A box of time. Something that happened 50 years ago or 5,000 years ago is just as great as it was 5 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SECOND GREAT MIRACLE THAT GOD DID in our brother Ron Spencer's life, and nobody would know it better than his mom and dad who are who are here this evening, was when he was bound by every devil of hell. &gt;&gt; And just one night, &gt;&gt; God said, "That's it. you're done. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't up and down and up and down and in and out. And I want to say to this camp and you young men, the thing that I have cried for and prayed for even tonight is that the full birth takes place. &gt;&gt; And that you're done with the world. You're done with sitting on the fence. YOU GET ON FIRE FOR GOD tonight and it's over forever.
