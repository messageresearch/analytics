Description:
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then the first thing you know they found out they didn't fetch a compass they went out without asking God and they got in trouble you always get in trouble if you go do something without asking God it's true and they said they said while they God's brought us out here to die there was a righteous man among them Jehosaphat so he said isn't there a Prophet somewhere of the Lord
