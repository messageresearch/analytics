[17:32] Going to ask brother John to come lead
[17:34] us in uh to [music] the throne in
[17:36] prayer. Have a two prayer requests here.
[17:40] An unspoken [music] prayer request by
[17:42] brother Luis and Sister Elizabeth Diaz.
[17:47] and also [music] a prayer request for
[17:51] Enrique Salazar
[17:53] who's at the hospital for observation to
[17:56] undergo [music] angiogram surgery.
[17:59] That's from brother Leon Garland,
[18:02] [music]
[18:03] brother from the Philippines. We just
[18:05] want to bring those requests before the
[18:07] Lord. And if you have a need in your
[18:09] heart, we we know that God is faithful
[18:11] to answer. Amen. We believe he's our
[18:14] portion.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother John.
[18:20] [music] Why don't you slip up your heart
[18:21] to the Lord?
[18:23] Hallelujah, Lord. Lord, we want to open
[18:25] up our mouths this morning and give
[18:27] praises to your name, Lord. Oh, God. We
[18:30] don't want the rocks to have to cry out,
[18:32] Lord. Sons and daughters are here, God,
[18:35] humbly approaching your throne, Lord.
[18:38] Lifting up our hearts and shouting in
[18:40] adorations to your precious name, God.
[18:44] How great thou art, Lord. How great thou
[18:47] art, Lord. We just throw up our hands
[18:49] today and say, you're the one that is
[18:51] the greatest thing in all of our lives,
[18:53] in the universe, Lord. Even the greatest
[18:57] of our concerns is swallowed up [music]
[18:59] in your great divine power that you're
[19:01] wanting to release upon us as your
[19:03] children. Lord, let sons and daughters
[19:06] sing. Let sons and daughters believe,
[19:09] Lord, as we've been anointed to receive.
[19:12] And all that we have need of, Lord, is
[19:14] wrapped up in your precious atonement,
[19:16] Lord. And we want to come into the camp
[19:19] of the believers this morning and cast
[19:21] aside all of our doubts and unbelief. We
[19:24] want to leave behind us the voices of
[19:27] the world. Leave behind us the voices of
[19:30] our jobs and and education, Lord, and
[19:33] schooling and burdens that would be upon
[19:36] so many hearts, even in the valleys of
[19:39] decisions, Lord, and you're our
[19:41] provider, God, and you meet every need.
[19:44] But we want to leave the camp, Lord, of
[19:46] just our senses. We want to come into
[19:48] that faith realm, Lord, where all things
[19:50] are possible, where there can be a
[19:53] divine connection [music]
[19:54] between our souls, Lord, and you, our
[19:57] precious Jesus. Lord, we just worship
[20:00] you right now, God. We bow our heads and
[20:03] we lift up our hearts, God, the creator
[20:06] of this universe, the one that came down
[20:09] and suffered without the camp to bear
[20:12] our sins and shed your blood for our
[20:15] lives. We receive that today, God. And
[20:19] for healing, Lord, even for our Filipino
[20:22] brother that's under observation, would
[20:24] your precious Holy Spirit go to this
[20:27] need, God? And would you just dissolve
[20:29] [music] everything that's wrong with any
[20:32] system, Lord, and meet his need, God,
[20:35] unspoken request of the [music] DS
[20:37] family. You are the God that answers all
[20:40] of our needs and our requests. Even
[20:43] before we ask, Lord, your your hand is
[20:46] beckoning to us to come deeper, come
[20:49] further. Let us go higher today. Lord,
[20:53] may the ministry be anointed, God, with
[20:56] that eagle anointing, Jesus, as your
[20:58] word is a discerner of our thoughts and
[21:01] of our intents. [music] Lord, I pray
[21:04] there'd be a great calmness today as you
[21:07] speak your word to our lives this long
[21:10] weekend, Lord. And many are traveling
[21:11] and are away with one with their
[21:14] families. We pray for protection [music]
[21:15] for them, Lord, and for your mercies to
[21:18] be upon your body, God, as we come into
[21:21] the camp of the believers today and
[21:23] where your Holy Spirit is and where your
[21:25] word is. May there be a great release to
[21:28] our hearts, God, as as we're
[21:30] worshippers, God, [music] in your in
[21:32] your name. May you descend down upon
[21:34] this meeting and bless [music] every
[21:36] soul and every life, every man, every
[21:40] woman, those on the internet, God, we
[21:42] pray for them, Lord, that even while the
[21:45] word is ministered, Jesus, there would
[21:47] be a great healing and deliverance upon
[21:50] all of our lives, God, as we as we look
[21:53] to you now. And we want to thank you for
[21:55] answering the prayers. Thank you for
[21:57] answering every prayer this morning.
[21:59] God, every heart that reached out in
[22:02] faith, you are already on the way, God.
[22:06] Release your power upon us throughout
[22:09] this service. Let us be receiving and
[22:12] giving our [music] love to you, God, in
[22:14] adoration. Bless our brother Nathan,
[22:17] God, for standing in the gap, Lord, and
[22:19] the musicians in every life.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[22:21] &gt;&gt; May there be a special anointing upon
[22:23] this meeting today and the baptism God
[22:26] that you'd fill them with the Holy
[22:28] Ghost. Lord, fill us all, God, freshly
[22:31] new, Lord, with the baptism of the Holy
[22:34] Ghost that our hearts could yearn for a
[22:37] greater reality and you could meet that
[22:39] Lord. We give the service to you in
[22:43] Jesus [music] name.
[22:46] Amen.
[22:53] Thank you, brother John. Have your
[22:56] seats, please.

[30:11] number two coming here.
[30:15] Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Well, I am indeed uh
[30:21] uh privileged to dedicate Josiah Jesse
[30:26] Oed.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Pardon? privileged that you
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're privileged. Thank you.
[30:36] Thank you, Jay.
[30:38] Uh other family members, Sister Grace's
[30:41] mother and dad are here, brother Sister
[30:43] Frandy. This is their last Sunday. We're
[30:47] happy they're able to be here as well.
[30:49] Other friends, and uh especially to have
[30:53] uh Violet and Isaac here as well. So we
[30:58] picked this day, had this day selected
[31:02] so we could have this time.
[31:07] So brother Jade, Sister Gracie has
[31:09] called their son Jesse,
[31:13] which is one uh I've just chosen certain
[31:16] parts of, you know, you can find all
[31:18] kinds of meanings to names and things
[31:21] and I don't know for sure just where all
[31:23] those meanings, but I really do trust
[31:24] the Bible,
[31:25] &gt;&gt; right? says, you know, it says that God
[31:28] exists.
[31:30] Jesse, God exists.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; I possess
[31:34] and God's gift. And secondly, O OED, his
[31:38] second name, servant of God,
[31:42] a worshipper and a follower, not a
[31:46] follower of men, but a follower of God.
[31:51] and Bey.
[31:54] I knew that was going to bring a
[31:56] surprise look. They didn't think I was
[31:59] going to say anything about Bey.
[32:02] You don't know where that came from.
[32:04] [laughter]
[32:05] All right.
[32:07] Bey is from Bartholomew.
[32:10] The disciple of Jesus.
[32:13] It has its roots and its origin in both
[32:17] Scottish and Irish.
[32:19] And it is one in in that language. It
[32:22] was one who was assigned land
[32:26] by the government
[32:28] to entertain and to have people that
[32:31] were appointed to them. They were given
[32:34] land and on that land they would grow uh
[32:38] have grow their food and with that food
[32:43] they would uh feed those that had been
[32:46] appointed to them. There'd be people
[32:48] that were appointed. It was a very
[32:49] honorable position that they were given.
[32:53] And so these people were certainly given
[32:55] to hospitality.
[32:58] They were to welcome and to feed and to
[33:01] nourish those that had been appointed to
[33:03] them. And I thought that was a marvelous
[33:06] thing that I could not only minister and
[33:09] a dedication for the baby but for the
[33:12] family.
[33:13] uh uh those that have that name,
[33:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:16] &gt;&gt; They are to be as Bartholomew
[33:19] uh people of hospitality,
[33:21] people that are prepared to have others
[33:25] and and and it's not there it was back
[33:29] then that the government appointed
[33:31] certain people, but now we're under a
[33:33] different government. And God brings
[33:36] people by your way to whose lives your
[33:40] lives will touch and you're to minister
[33:42] to them and to nourish them and to be
[33:45] hospitable to them. And I know that you
[33:47] are. And perhaps that name may even now
[33:50] explain a wee bit of your lives.
[33:54] How it has been it has been that way.
[33:56] Jesse is a gift from God to the Bey
[34:00] family.
[34:02] has had some challenges
[34:06] very early in his life just as an infant
[34:10] experienced more medically than a lot of
[34:12] people may experience in a good part of
[34:14] their life.
[34:16] God spared him.
[34:19] And may he get may God get glory from
[34:21] his life and may he give to brother Jay
[34:25] and sister Grace be a credit to the
[34:28] family
[34:30] and may Jesse be a son through whom God
[34:32] can show that he indeed exists.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; There was a lady that came to Brother
[34:42] Brham. I'm just going to take a few
[34:43] moments now.
[34:45] There was a lady who came to her brother
[34:47] Brham. It wasn't Sister Grace, but
[34:52] it was there's some similarities.
[34:55] And uh she said, "I enjoyed the
[34:58] messages."
[35:00] And she said, "I certainly believe you
[35:02] are a servant of the Lord."
[35:06] And he said, "Thank you, sister. God
[35:08] reward you for that."
[35:10] And while she was standing there, he
[35:12] said, "I saw a vision
[35:15] and she was away in her middle age."
[35:19] And I said, "Sister, thus saith the
[35:21] Lord, I see you standing holding a baby
[35:25] in your arms in a little blanket."
[35:29] And she said, "Me?"
[35:31] He said, "Yes, ma'am, you. It's thus
[35:34] sayith the Lord." And she said, "I hope
[35:37] you're right." And I said, "It isn't me
[35:40] speaking. It's thus sayith the Lord."
[35:44] Well, two or three, four years passed
[35:47] and she began to doubt it.
[35:51] And then Brother Brham met her husband
[35:53] and her husband wanted to do something
[35:55] for Brother just wanted to give him his
[35:56] coat cuz it was a cold time. It was up
[35:59] in Canada actually that happened.
[36:03] And he said, he said, "Tell your wife to
[36:06] quit doubting about the baby."
[36:09] And that's been about 3 years ago.
[36:14] And well, last week the baby was born.
[36:18] After 8 years, something God's word is
[36:22] eternally true. And the same God that
[36:24] lived in the Old Testament lives today.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; And I say, the same God that lived 40
[36:29] years ago lives today. Amen.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; This child came as a surprise and we
[36:34] don't know why exactly,
[36:38] but God had a plan. I don't know what
[36:39] the end of this child was. I don't know.
[36:41] He's probably living today, but God had
[36:44] a plan for him. And that baby was
[36:47] certainly unexpected. This baby was
[36:49] certainly unexpected.
[36:51] And uh now we have Jesse Oed here being
[36:55] held by his father. But God knew all
[36:58] about it. The Bible says,
[37:01] "Lo, children,"
[37:04] that's all children are the heritage of
[37:06] the Lord.
[37:08] In other words, they're God's property
[37:12] and they're lent to us for a little
[37:14] while and we don't know how long. And so
[37:18] God wants
[37:20] you, brother Jay, and you, Sister Grace,
[37:23] as I know you have and do,
[37:26] is to train the child, pro provide care
[37:30] for it, and more than that, be an
[37:32] example
[37:34] of spiritual life and instruct and train
[37:37] him up in the way that he should go.
[37:40] And may he
[37:42] may this family circle these words were
[37:46] on my heart last night. May this beady
[37:49] family circle be unbroken
[37:52] &gt;&gt; at the marriage table of the Lord. We'll
[37:56] dedicate Jesse.
[38:06] We'll pray together.
[38:09] Heavenly Father,
[38:11] I hold this jewel that you have given,
[38:14] this gem into the Beady family.
[38:18] This Bartholomew disciple of Jesus
[38:21] Christ, chosen by the lamb of God as you
[38:25] walked here, Lord Jesus.
[38:27] You chose him. And now you've chosen
[38:31] this family. You've chosen them to be
[38:33] disciples of yours.
[38:35] You've chosen them, oh God, to be mother
[38:38] and father now of a another child and
[38:41] they have named him Jesse. God exists.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; O bed a worshshiper, one who follows
[38:49] God. May this child ever follow God. And
[38:54] may you heavenly father manifest
[38:56] yourself in his little life and showing
[38:58] that God is alive. God exists yesterday,
[39:02] today and forever. I bless this child in
[39:06] the name of Jesus Christ. And father, as
[39:09] you have given him to brother Jay and
[39:12] sister Grace and now we dedicate him
[39:14] back to you, we dedicate Jesse Oed to
[39:18] fulfill his purpose and calling in life.
[39:21] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray your
[39:23] blessing upon this entire family, upon
[39:26] Isaac, Violet, oh God. And on that day
[39:30] at the appointed time, there will be a
[39:33] table spread. It is the marriage supper
[39:36] of the lamb. And by your grace, we shall
[39:39] all be there. Father, we claim that. We
[39:42] believe that. We hold it as our treasure
[39:45] in our heart. And now, Lord, receive
[39:48] Jesse. I pray. Watch over him. Keep him
[39:52] in good health
[39:54] always. I ask father many way may he
[39:58] when he hears the name Jesus may
[40:01] something in him jump oh god hallelujah
[40:05] may his soul leap oh father
[40:08] &gt;&gt; at the sound of that name
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[40:13] amen
[40:24] &gt;&gt; bless
[40:25] God bless you.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. City Grace,
[40:30] God bless you, Isaac. What do you think
[40:32] of him?
[40:36] God bless you.
[40:42] Hallelujah.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus loved the children
[40:48] &gt;&gt; and he took time with the children. And
[40:50] other people didn't understand perhaps
[40:52] why he took time with the children.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; But he takes time for the children
[40:56] because he doesn't just see them as
[40:59] babes. He sees them as sons and
[41:02] daughters of God.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:06] [clears throat] We have also
[41:08] uh happy to receive this morning
[41:12] uh not the first time in church but the
[41:15] first time as a family our sister
[41:18] Sephora.
[41:20] I wonder if sister Sephora and the
[41:22] family could stand please. And we have
[41:25] sister Sephora,
[41:27] sister Naomi,
[41:29] sister Mila,
[41:32] brother Richard,
[41:33] brother Jean,
[41:35] and
[41:38] Jessica. Is it Jessica? I'm not too
[41:41] sure. All right, that's the family.
[41:43] They've come. They have settled here.
[41:48] Uh the children for the most part will
[41:51] be in school except for Naomi. She's got
[41:53] to go on to her higher education.
[41:57] And we just want to welcome them in the
[41:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:00] [applause]
[42:09] [applause]
[42:10] Father brother Jean is in Ghana. He's
[42:14] probably streaming the meeting right now
[42:17] and uh no [clears throat] doubt has some
[42:19] tears in his eyes because he wishes he
[42:22] could be here, I'm sure. And we wish he
[42:25] could be here and we're we're looking
[42:27] forward and we're working towards that
[42:29] end. Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't the Lord wonderful?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; I think he's just so wonderful. the
[42:36] school children
[42:38] uh in all the not just here but the
[42:41] school children that are of school age
[42:43] are going to be going back to school
[42:45] this next week. And we want to pray.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; We don't want to pray after the fact.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; We want to pray before the fact.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And young people and children, we're
[42:58] praying for you.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Not just some idol prayer, but we're
[43:01] holding on to God for you. Amen.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; God hold you in this time.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Uh there's those that will be going to
[43:10] uh the Bible way Christian Academy.
[43:12] There are some that will be in other
[43:15] schools and on the state side in Canada.
[43:18] They'll be in public schools. There are
[43:21] some that are local here. And of course
[43:25] are many through the live streaming and
[43:29] the archive streaming. There are those
[43:31] that are sitting in their rooms
[43:33] listening and being part of this service
[43:35] and there are children that are looking
[43:36] at this service right now at this
[43:38] audience and they're got to go to school
[43:40] also. We want them to know that we're
[43:42] going to be praying for them as well.
[43:45] And there are those in [clears throat]
[43:47] other countries. I have a an email this
[43:50] morning from brother
[43:53] Murphy and there's uh one or two
[43:56] students in China and there are others
[44:00] that would love to be in the in the
[44:02] school here they would have to get visas
[44:05] and the one girl she's about 15 years
[44:07] old there may be two of them they are uh
[44:11] awaiting a visa right now to be able to
[44:13] come to attend the school here and we
[44:16] have a place for them to today. Uh we're
[44:19] we're thankful for that. There are
[44:21] others there would like to perhaps have
[44:24] their own uh uh school because he said
[44:27] the school system even in China. He said
[44:31] it's just vile. It's filled with
[44:34] immorality.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; And the and the believers who have come
[44:38] to know Christ are having such a
[44:40] difficult time giving their children
[44:43] into that atmosphere. We need to pray.
[44:46] friends. Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; If we ever prayed, we need to pray. And
[44:49] so, we're we're so thankful for everyone
[44:52] that has labored the way that you have
[44:54] and and worked. Incidentally, if you
[44:57] would remember, continue to remember
[44:59] Brother Murphy if you would please. And
[45:01] remember brother Kim who is he left here
[45:04] very wearied and he's in India. He's
[45:06] been going almost non-stop because
[45:09] there's things for him to do in the
[45:10] middle of the night there because it's
[45:12] daytime here. So he's up in the
[45:14] nighttime communicating [clears throat]
[45:16] with the those and brother Ben I suppose
[45:20] and different ones because of we're
[45:22] trying to get things finished up. Uh and
[45:25] I think that we ought to make a real
[45:26] effort target to have this school
[45:30] finished as early and as soon as
[45:32] possible. So we're pulling out the stops
[45:35] for that. Um and we're just happy for
[45:38] everyone that is present today. Uh,
[45:46] now we're going to go to the word.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what you all been waiting
[45:50] for?
[45:51] &gt;&gt; But I'd like to pray with the children
[45:53] and the parents if you'll stand with me.
[45:56] Uh, [clears throat]
[45:59] I wonder if we could sing I'm amazed
[46:01] that he loved me. I'm amazed that he
[46:04] cared. [music]
[46:07] you know
[46:09] sometimes it's difficult for us to
[46:11] really grasp [music] how much he cares.
[46:14] Uh there was only
[46:18] only certain times and certain things
[46:21] would happen in our home
[46:24] when I was a child and I wasn't with my
[46:28] mother and father very much. But there
[46:30] were times when it it it became very
[46:34] evident that they cared [music] and they
[46:37] cared a whole lot more than I realized
[46:39] it and they were concerned. And then
[46:42] when I looked back, then I saw, you
[46:44] know, they always fed me, always cared,
[46:48] always took me to church, and I know
[46:51] they prayed. And [music] we have a
[46:54] heavenly father.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're not mindful that he
[46:57] cares. [music]
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed.
[47:07] [music] I'm amazed.
[47:08] Let's sing it together.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[47:13] &gt;&gt; I believe
[47:16] that
[47:20] I [music]
[47:22] [singing]
[47:26] [music]
[47:29] preless [singing]
[47:31] blood [music] I found
[47:36] my s [music]
[47:38] are all
[47:40] They're all washed away. All I see
[47:46] are wash [music]
[47:48] away once again.
[47:51] Heat. Heat.
[47:54] [music]
[48:00] [music]
[48:00] [singing]
[48:03] that you
[48:07] [music]
[48:08] [singing]
[48:10] love I found
[48:15] and [music] my sins
[48:17] are washed. They're all
[48:19] [music and singing]
[48:20] washed away. All my sins
[48:25] are washed [music]
[48:27] away.
[48:30] going to ask this assembly to say, I
[48:32] believe.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; I believe,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that he loves me.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that he cares.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; I believe [music]
[48:44] that you love me. Yes,
[48:48] I believe [music]
[48:52] that you
[48:57] [music]
[49:06] [music] are
[49:08] all [singing]
[49:14] I
[49:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[49:14] &gt;&gt; all the way.
[49:19] Oh, let's just bow our heads before him.
[49:22] Heavenly Father, [music] you are our
[49:26] father.
[49:28] Mighty God, almighty God, filling all
[49:31] time and space
[49:33] completely goes beyond the boundaries of
[49:36] our mental capacity. But we believe.
[49:41] We do not understand all things. But we
[49:44] believe everything you have spoken.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; We believe your word that you have sent.
[49:50] [music] We believe in the almighty
[49:52] power, oh God, of your promises. And
[49:55] today, Father, as we are mindful of the
[49:59] children, some just starting the school
[50:02] system, others in another grade and in
[50:06] the high school, and some going into
[50:08] further education. Lord, I pray that the
[50:12] Holy Spirit will now just settle down
[50:16] upon all of the students through this
[50:19] congregation
[50:20] throughout those that are out in other
[50:22] countries, Lord, that are streaming this
[50:25] service. May your Holy Spirit, divine
[50:29] presence settle down in the room as you
[50:32] will in the sanctuary, oh God. And I
[50:35] pray that in the classrooms as our
[50:38] teachers father and [music] our brother
[50:41] Ticatch as a principal, I pray that the
[50:44] Holy Spirit [music] will reign supreme
[50:47] in every classroom in every time they
[50:50] assemble together. And I pray when
[50:53] difficulties arise that they will have
[50:55] wisdom. And may the wisdom not be of a
[50:58] human source, but may it be a divine
[51:00] source that comes from the spirit of
[51:03] God. May they have access to the gift of
[51:06] wisdom and the gift of the word and
[51:08] knowledge and all of the things that are
[51:11] needful, Father. [music]
[51:12] And may they never be ashamed to bow
[51:14] their head and have a time of prayer
[51:17] when a need arises, oh God. [music]
[51:20] Keep the students, I pray, in good
[51:22] health, oh God. And may they complete
[51:25] this year with the glory of God upon
[51:27] them. And now as we're gathered here in
[51:30] this sanctuary [music] and your word is
[51:32] laying open before us, Lord, it needs to
[51:35] be more than just an open book, but may
[51:38] it be a revealed book. I pray you will
[51:40] reveal those things that are needful to
[51:43] us in the name of Jesus Christ and
[51:46] strengthen us for the journey. Oh God,
[51:48] we do not know what tomorrow holds, but
[51:51] we know that you hold all time and space
[51:53] in your hand. And I pray, Father, you
[51:55] will anoint both speaker and hearers.
[51:58] Anoint each minister, oh God. Anoint the
[52:01] deacons, the trustees, and all who serve
[52:04] you. For we are here as your children
[52:06] and as your servants. [music] In Jesus
[52:09] Christ's name, be glorified.
[52:12] Amen.
[52:14] Amen.
[52:17] I'll invite you to turn your Bibles,
[52:19] please.
[52:21] We're going to read out of Ephesians
[52:24] the first chapter and we'll start with
[52:26] verse 9.
[52:34] Thank you musicians.
[52:48] Ephesians 1 vers9, having made known
[52:52] unto us, please notice the first ver,
[52:55] first line, having made known unto us
[53:00] the mystery of his will, according to
[53:04] his good pleasure, which he hath
[53:06] purposed in himself, that in the
[53:09] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[53:12] he might gather together in one
[53:14] &gt;&gt; all things in Christ, both which are in
[53:18] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[53:20] him, in whom also we have obtained an
[53:24] inheritance, being predestinated
[53:27] according to the purpose of him who
[53:29] workketh all things after the council of
[53:34] his own will, that we should be to the
[53:37] praise of his glory, who first trusted
[53:40] in Christ, to whom ye also trusted
[53:45] after that ye heard the word of truth.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; That the gospel of your salv the the
[53:51] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[53:54] after that ye believed you were sealed
[53:58] with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the third verse as
[54:05] I read it again carefully and slowly. in
[54:09] whom you also trusted
[54:12] after that you heard the word of truth,
[54:16] the word of truth,
[54:18] &gt;&gt; the gospel of your salvation, in whom
[54:21] also after that ye believed, you were
[54:25] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[54:29] And I'm going to read also which I've
[54:32] read I believe last week John the 16th
[54:35] chapter verses 1213 and 14.
[54:42] [clears throat]
[54:48] Just notice the theme here. Jesus
[54:50] speaking. I have yet many things to say
[54:54] unto you. You see, these are the things
[54:57] which were being spoken by the apostles
[55:00] and by the disciples and still being
[55:02] spoken. These are things which have been
[55:04] spoken in the message.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I have yet many things
[55:08] to say to you." He had to use Paul. He
[55:11] had to use the apostles. He had to use
[55:14] the messengers. He had to use the
[55:16] prophet of this day to say those things.
[55:18] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[55:23] and but you cannot bear them now.
[55:26] [clears throat] How be it, when when he,
[55:29] the Spirit of truth, is come.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; He will guide you into all truth.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; For he will not speak of himself, but
[55:38] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[55:41] speak, and he shall show you things to
[55:44] come.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; He shall glorify me. In other words,
[55:48] when the spirit comes, the spirit
[55:49] doesn't say spirit, spirit, spirit. The
[55:52] spirit says word, word, word.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And the whole Pentecostal movement and
[55:58] many many of the charismatics and
[55:59] everything is just spirit this spirit
[56:01] spirit. Oh, we feel the spirit. No, when
[56:03] the spirit comes, he will just say word
[56:06] word
[56:07] &gt;&gt; word word word.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; He will glor He won't glorify himself.
[56:12] He will speak of me.
[56:18] For he shall receive of mine and shall
[56:22] show it unto you.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] God bless you as you have your seats.
[56:34] How can we know what is truth?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; You've heard a lot of things this week.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:46] How do you know it's true?
[56:50] How do we define truth?
[56:54] You've heard all kinds of chatter and
[56:57] conversation
[56:59] pass back and forth.
[57:03] During the camp,
[57:05] just at the end of our family camp,
[57:08] a brother got a phone call, a minister
[57:11] got a phone call from one of his deacons
[57:15] said, "Brother Perry Green
[57:18] has cancer in both lungs and just has
[57:23] uh just very short time to live
[57:29] as a deacon, to a pastor, and to me and
[57:34] I got on the phone. I called brother
[57:37] Randy who was in California
[57:41] and I know that Randy is close to some
[57:43] members of the family. I said, "Brother
[57:45] Randy, I just heard this before it goes
[57:48] anywhere. I want it confirmed."
[57:53] And in a few moments, he said, "I'll
[57:54] call you back within five minutes." He
[57:57] called me back within about five
[57:59] minutes. She said, "I just spoke to one
[58:01] of the green girls, the daughters."
[58:03] Said, "There's no truth to it at all."
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that there was cancer in one
[58:10] lung.
[58:12] Wasn't that there was, you know, that
[58:14] it's not cancer, but it's something
[58:16] else. They said, "Father's fine.
[58:19] He's got some challenges, but he's
[58:21] fine."
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you figure that one out?
[58:25] Oh, you know what? You hear things and
[58:28] it sounds it's so correct. It's so
[58:32] authoritative.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; It's so the even the chain the channel
[58:37] of it is so everybody and you and you
[58:41] and brother Brandham preached. I want
[58:43] you to be able to go home and listen to
[58:44] some messages presuming
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and they presumed it was correct. They
[58:51] presumed that God was in it
[58:55] &gt;&gt; and and God wasn't in it
[59:00] &gt;&gt; and it's so it sounds so correct. So
[59:03] right I got it from it's such an
[59:06] authorative v voice.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; How can you do better from a deacon to
[59:11] his own pastor, from the pastor to me?
[59:14] From me and I'm happy to tell you
[59:16] there's no truth to it.
[59:22] How do we know what is truth?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Especially when it comes to the
[59:27] scriptures.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; It's not just gifted men.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; It's not someone who sounds and has the
[59:36] uh persona of being authorative and
[59:39] knows what he's he's well spoken, well
[59:41] read, wellstudied. That doesn't do it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; It's critical.
[59:48] You shall know the truth and the truth
[59:51] will set you free.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people have all kinds of
[59:55] religiosity or they hear things or
[59:57] things quoted from the scripture but yet
[59:59] it hasn't set them free. You might be
[1:00:01] sitting here
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; and I want to at least give you a basis
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; on which this isn't from brother Ed
[1:00:11] Briscoll. This isn't from a Bible
[1:00:13] school. This isn't from any special uh
[1:00:17] you know human learning
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; but I that's why I am so
[1:00:23] absolutely
[1:00:24] given over to what God vindicates
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; that that some power beyond my
[1:00:36] understanding
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; some force
[1:00:40] some person a being
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; who we call God.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; When he reaches through from the realm
[1:00:47] of the unseen,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; and comes amongst men,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; comes amongst women, comes into a
[1:00:54] congregation and uses a vessel and
[1:00:58] confirms this is truth.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Then you can settle back and rest and
[1:01:05] say, "My confidence
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; is in that God.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I may not understand everything that's
[1:01:12] happening, But I understand one thing. I
[1:01:15] have enough intelligence to know this is
[1:01:17] not a man.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; This is not human intelligence.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; This isn't man or woman's doing. This
[1:01:24] isn't some system doing this. This is
[1:01:27] someone who I I can't even fully grasp.
[1:01:30] But he has stepped through from his
[1:01:32] realm into my dimension and proven this
[1:01:37] is the truth. Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And if the one who he's using calls it
[1:01:41] vindication, then I will call it
[1:01:43] vindication.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; I went to church all my life. I have
[1:01:47] never ever heard the word vindication
[1:01:50] or vindicated in reference to the
[1:01:53] ministry till I came to the message.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And in the message, the prophet uses
[1:01:58] vindicate, vindicated, vindication about
[1:02:01] just under 2,000 times.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] 1760
[1:02:07] times
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; and he speaks of it and I will be making
[1:02:10] reference to it because this
[1:02:13] congregation and all who hear my voice
[1:02:16] today wants to understand one thing. I
[1:02:19] my faith is anchored in that which God
[1:02:22] has vindicated
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; and which that vessel has spoken. Yeah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; And if I find anybody or I'm speaking to
[1:02:31] anyone and they kind of start to fluff
[1:02:34] around and they're not just that and
[1:02:36] say, "Well, the messenger has said this
[1:02:39] and well, you know, that's where we part
[1:02:41] ways.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; That's where we part ways because my
[1:02:47] confidence can only rest there
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; because I have come to the conclusion
[1:02:51] that is God.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; No one else can do that. That is God.
[1:02:56] That's God's intelligence.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; That's God's doing. I may not know why
[1:03:01] he did it that way, but he did it that
[1:03:04] way.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; How can we identify the truth
[1:03:18] of a slide? Hope
[1:03:28] All right. I don't don't read this real
[1:03:31] fast, please.
[1:03:33] The book is absolutely sealed. I was
[1:03:36] speaking about the seals
[1:03:38] until the seven seals is broken.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; It is sealed up with seven seals. Now,
[1:03:45] that's different from [clears throat]
[1:03:46] the seven thunders. This is seven seals
[1:03:49] upon the book. And the book
[1:03:53] will not the seals will not be released
[1:03:56] until the message of the seventh angel.
[1:04:00] So now
[1:04:02] so we are presuming
[1:04:05] but the genuine revelation of God
[1:04:09] will be made perfect
[1:04:12] in that sounding in that sounding and
[1:04:16] conjunction word vindicated truth.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; It will be made the the genuine
[1:04:24] revelation of God. The revelation will
[1:04:28] be made perfect in the sounding.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; So it'll be a voice
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; and the vindicated truth
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; or the proven truth,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; the confirmed truth. So if you put the a
[1:04:42] sounding and the confirmed truth,
[1:04:45] because now here's what the messenger
[1:04:47] also said. Brother Brandham said, "If
[1:04:50] the sign doesn't have a voice that
[1:04:52] follows,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; if it doesn't have a voice that follows,
[1:04:56] don't you pay any attention to it."
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; So, there can be all kinds of signs and
[1:05:01] things that perhaps we can't uh we can't
[1:05:05] uh declare or we can't fully understand.
[1:05:09] There can be signs of, you know, people
[1:05:11] in the world show signs and show
[1:05:14] phenomena. So we're not, our faith is
[1:05:17] not in phenomena.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Our faith is in a combination. It's in a
[1:05:24] revelation
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; that comes by a voice
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; and a vindicated truth.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; So we see God come and confirm
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; something spoken.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And then and then it reveals something.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Well, then we have confidence. what is
[1:05:44] revealed is is true. It is correct.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] [clears throat]
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; The vindicated truth.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Now he said, now that's exactly what the
[1:05:57] word said. The mysteries should be
[1:06:00] finished at that time.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And this seven sealed book, remember it
[1:06:06] was closed here in Revelation 5. I just
[1:06:10] added this in. And uh and in Revelation
[1:06:14] 10th chapter it is opened.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get into that because
[1:06:20] that's a whole message in itself.
[1:06:24] Presuming,
[1:06:26] we're not speaking about presuming. I
[1:06:27] want to speak on vindication. But
[1:06:29] presuming is to accept that something is
[1:06:33] almost certain [clears throat] to be
[1:06:35] correct even though there is no proof of
[1:06:38] it
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; on the grounds that it is extremely
[1:06:42] likely.
[1:06:44] Now in the message in one of the message
[1:06:46] presuming they the people of Israel came
[1:06:50] to Moses and there was a certain king a
[1:06:53] certain nation that they felt and and
[1:06:56] they knew that they should defeat them
[1:06:58] and it was part of their journey. So
[1:07:01] they said to Moses, "Should we go up
[1:07:04] against them?" And Moses said, "Thou
[1:07:07] shalt not go up." And Moses had his
[1:07:10] reasons for saying, "You shall not go
[1:07:12] up." But the people themselves decided
[1:07:17] that this is the plan of God. And so
[1:07:19] they presumed, and he he uses that they
[1:07:23] presumed that God was with them. And
[1:07:25] they went up and were utterly defeated.
[1:07:27] And they found out at a huge cost to
[1:07:30] themselves, God wasn't with them.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Well, how could they have avoided that?
[1:07:36] All they had to do is identify who was
[1:07:39] the vindicated voice. Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And if they'd identified it, who was the
[1:07:44] vindicated voice and said, "Even though
[1:07:47] it looks to me like God's will,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; it looks to me as though God's in it and
[1:07:52] I have all these other reasons to
[1:07:54] believe that I'm almost certain it's
[1:07:57] correct.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Don't do it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That isn't sufficient to do it."
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; We want to have a vindicated voice that
[1:08:06] confirms that we are right.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; How be it, when he, the spirit of truth,
[1:08:13] is come, he will guide you into how
[1:08:17] much?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; A ll all truth.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; For he shall not speak of himself, but
[1:08:24] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[1:08:27] speak, and he will show you things to
[1:08:30] come.
[1:08:33] So now that is presuming. What does
[1:08:36] vindication mean? I'm just done with the
[1:08:39] slides now for a while. You can turn the
[1:08:40] lights back up, please. What does
[1:08:44] vindication mean to the message
[1:08:47] believers?
[1:08:49] What does it mean to us? Why do we have
[1:08:53] we have a prophet of God who we have
[1:08:56] such implicit confidence in
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and he is using this from so many
[1:09:04] different times and different ways and
[1:09:07] all through his ministry. What should
[1:09:10] that mean to us? And that is God proves
[1:09:14] or vindicates his servants with the
[1:09:17] supernatural. That's the short part of
[1:09:20] it.
[1:09:21] That's what vindication means to us.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I'll give you the meaning in a few
[1:09:25] moments. It is some supernatural things
[1:09:30] can be explained away. Now I said that
[1:09:32] it is a supernatural
[1:09:35] vindication is something supernatural
[1:09:37] confirming that this is a true statement
[1:09:41] or this is a true something that we
[1:09:43] should believe in. But now you can have
[1:09:46] something that is supernatural and
[1:09:48] explained away. The life of Jesus.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Whoever had a more spiritual life, they
[1:09:55] explained him away. He's a carpenter's
[1:09:57] son. He They even thought he's the son
[1:09:59] of Joseph, which he wasn't.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; So they explained his life. They
[1:10:03] explained his death away.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; They explained his burial
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; and his resurrection.
[1:10:11] Even though there was he was seen after
[1:10:14] his passion with above 500 brethren. So
[1:10:18] it wasn't just Jesus who couldn't
[1:10:20] convince him. It was 500 brethren
[1:10:22] couldn't convince us
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; that this was spiritual and there was
[1:10:28] some conniving done and some money that
[1:10:30] was paid and say that his body was
[1:10:33] stolen and believe it or not even that
[1:10:36] is believed to this day. Right. Right.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; I sat with Muslims and they told me that
[1:10:44] they believed and what they held to was
[1:10:47] that the disciples of Jesus loved him so
[1:10:50] much that they didn't want to see him uh
[1:10:54] didn't want to see him die. So they took
[1:10:56] him from the cross before he died and he
[1:11:00] didn't have to die the death. And I
[1:11:02] said, "Well, that was very nice. I this
[1:11:06] man was a vice president of British
[1:11:08] Petroleum.
[1:11:10] I was sitting with him in Morocco
[1:11:15] and I said to him, "That's very nice
[1:11:18] that you feel that way about Jesus."
[1:11:21] But I said, "If Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] was not the son of God," because they
[1:11:27] don't believe he was the son of God in
[1:11:29] that sense of the word.
[1:11:32] I said,
[1:11:36] "Regardless of how righteous a man you
[1:11:39] may be," this was my answer to him.
[1:11:42] "Regardless of how holy and righteous
[1:11:45] you might be, I said, if you died, could
[1:11:49] you die,
[1:11:51] could you die for me and give me any
[1:11:55] time in eternal life?" "Oh, no, no, no,"
[1:11:57] he said. I said, "That's right." I said,
[1:12:00] "And regardless of how righteous a
[1:12:02] person I might be," I said, "If I died
[1:12:06] on your behalf, my death would not give
[1:12:09] you even a moment's time of eternal
[1:12:12] life."
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Exact."
[1:12:16] I said, "Sir,"
[1:12:18] I said, "This is my these are my
[1:12:20] daughters and my wife. I've committed
[1:12:23] them to that Jesus Christ was the son of
[1:12:27] God and through his death and his
[1:12:30] resurrection
[1:12:31] he has forgiven our sins and we have
[1:12:34] eternal life.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And I said if that if Jesus Christ did
[1:12:38] not die on Calvary I said we all in this
[1:12:42] room are lost
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; completely lost. Right.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And this man, as wise a man and as smart
[1:12:51] a man, as a wealthy a man as he is, he
[1:12:54] said, "That's very interesting. I have
[1:12:57] never heard it presented that way." And
[1:13:00] that was what we left him with. He went
[1:13:03] home thinking on those things. I trust
[1:13:06] he found Christ.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know. But if that was not the
[1:13:10] son of God. And so here's here's over a
[1:13:14] billion uh Muslim people who believe
[1:13:18] that the disciples love Jesus too much.
[1:13:20] It's very nice. But there's no eternal
[1:13:23] life to it.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; It was enough that the woman at the well
[1:13:27] it it was by some standards it would be
[1:13:30] enough for them for the people to say,
[1:13:32] "Well, she believes you're a prophet."
[1:13:35] That was a compliment. That wasn't
[1:13:37] enough. That was you're a prophet. That
[1:13:41] was partly true
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to come to that also.
[1:13:48] Partial truth is not truth
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; because partial truth invariably has
[1:13:55] something added to it.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; People say, "I believe William Brown's a
[1:14:00] prophet of God." That's fine. That is
[1:14:03] true. But what else do you believe?
[1:14:11] and what else is added to it may well
[1:14:14] invalidate your first claim.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to be going into it in
[1:14:20] some in some depth. The message and
[1:14:24] believers are being explained away
[1:14:26] today. The same spirit hasn't died. The
[1:14:30] same thing that explained the death of
[1:14:32] Jesus away, the resurrection of him
[1:14:35] away, they've managed to explain the
[1:14:37] apostles away, they've explained the
[1:14:39] gospel away, and they explain the
[1:14:42] messenger today. Oh, they say all kind
[1:14:45] of I mean I I wouldn't encourage you to
[1:14:47] do that, but the things that have been
[1:14:50] printed about brother Brandham, the
[1:14:52] things that have been said about him,
[1:14:55] and he said it himself, he's they take
[1:14:57] him all the way from being God to being
[1:14:59] a devil.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; If they said this about the messenger,
[1:15:07] and if they said those things about
[1:15:09] Jesus, are we going to get off any
[1:15:11] easier? Come on.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; No, we're going to be whatever. And we
[1:15:15] all we want to be undeterred
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; in our conviction, in our confession of
[1:15:21] faith.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, we may have escaped
[1:15:26] some of the reproach, but it may well be
[1:15:29] we escaped it because we haven't been as
[1:15:31] fervent and as forward as we must be
[1:15:34] about our declaration.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. People have said to me and I' I've
[1:15:42] faced this many times. Well, if you say,
[1:15:45] are you saying if I don't believe this
[1:15:47] message, I'm going to hell. I said, I
[1:15:50] will tell you this that this message is
[1:15:53] the call to the rapture.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And if this is the call to the rapture,
[1:15:58] you put yourself where you want to.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; How can you be in it if you refuse the
[1:16:05] very call to the rapture? Come on.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not putting anybody in hell. That's
[1:16:10] not my job.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; My job is to say this is the way.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And I'd recommend that to anybody. Let
[1:16:18] them answer where they're at.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You tell me where you're at.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; I can show you in the scripture. There
[1:16:26] was to be a messenger. This is the
[1:16:27] messenger. This messenger was supposed
[1:16:29] to do certain things. He did certain
[1:16:31] things.
[1:16:34] And the mysteries of the word of God
[1:16:35] were supposed to re be revealed. And
[1:16:38] listen, all kinds of people have opened
[1:16:39] up the seven seals,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; but nobody opened up the seven seals
[1:16:43] except this one that had the vindication
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; where the great eternal one
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; from beyond the curtain of time reached
[1:16:53] through
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and confirmed unequivocally.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; This is not a man speaking. This is me
[1:17:01] speaking. Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Think he did all of that so that we
[1:17:07] could sit here and say, "I have good
[1:17:10] reason." Not just good reason to presume
[1:17:13] it's right. I can say with authority
[1:17:17] according to the word of God.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; This Holy Spirit has led us into all
[1:17:22] truth.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; I may not understand all truth. We don't
[1:17:26] understand all. We don't understand
[1:17:28] everything that happens. But I know that
[1:17:30] this leadership is correct.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Vindicated truth. I tried to put it down
[1:17:40] in a phrase.
[1:17:42] Vindicated truth is a body of thought
[1:17:48] or events. a body of thought or events
[1:17:52] that are proven correct or true by the
[1:17:56] power of God coming from the unseen
[1:18:00] realm and confirms by bringing to pass
[1:18:04] what has been spoken or foretold.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; I gave that a lot of thought because
[1:18:11] that's out of my own heart. That's why I
[1:18:14] believe it. I had to answer to myself. I
[1:18:16] have to answer not only to myself. have
[1:18:18] to answer on behalf of those that I'm
[1:18:20] responsible for. That's why I believe
[1:18:23] the message
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and that's what vindication is to me.
[1:18:26] The there's a whole body of thought.
[1:18:29] There's a whole message.
[1:18:31] We call it the message. It that's a
[1:18:33] whole body of thought
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; and there's all kinds of thought. I mean
[1:18:38] contrary thought to what other people
[1:18:40] have said. We're contrary especially on
[1:18:44] the trinity.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It's anathema. what we believe is just
[1:18:47] anathema to the religious world. They
[1:18:50] just cast William Brham and the whole
[1:18:53] allamists they call them and they just
[1:18:55] cast them to the earth because they
[1:18:57] don't believe the trinity horrors.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Well, we're in good company. Neither
[1:19:03] does God believe in the trinity.
[1:19:06] [applause]
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And ask them to find the trinity.
[1:19:09] They'll say it's a mystery.
[1:19:12] And my answer to that is it's a mystery
[1:19:14] to you, but it's not a mystery to me.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; God has manifested himself as the
[1:19:21] father. Manifest himself as the son.
[1:19:24] Manifest himself as the spirit. And the
[1:19:26] spirit of truth simply is the light of
[1:19:30] the truth.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; The spirit is the life sir. When this
[1:19:35] child we just dedicated was born, when
[1:19:38] he just first issued out of the womb,
[1:19:40] the spirit had to come in before there
[1:19:43] was life. If not, it was still born.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of stillborns.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit who wrote this word has
[1:19:51] come to the message you have believed
[1:19:53] and gives it life.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And when it gives it life, what kind of
[1:20:00] life? not uh you know Michelangelo's
[1:20:03] life or some preacher's life but it's
[1:20:05] the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of truth has come he
[1:20:12] will guide you into all truth.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Now the spirit of God has moved don't
[1:20:18] don't lose my thought now. I'll just
[1:20:20] hang right on to that. The spirit of God
[1:20:23] has moved or brooded. Brother Brham uses
[1:20:26] the word brooded, which is as a hen will
[1:20:30] brood over her chicks or brood over the
[1:20:33] eggs she's sitting on. He brooded over
[1:20:35] the earth at different appointed times
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; to bring forth life according to the
[1:20:42] plan
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; that he had in his mind for that season.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Genesis 1:2, "And the earth was
[1:20:49] without form
[1:20:51] and void and darkness was upon the face
[1:20:54] of the deep." I would say something had
[1:20:57] to happen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And he said, and it says, "And the
[1:21:01] spirit of God moved
[1:21:05] upon the face of the waters."
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he he describes
[1:21:11] that.
[1:21:12] He says, "And there was a time when the
[1:21:15] world was laying in darkness and utter
[1:21:18] darkness.
[1:21:20] It was without form and was void
[1:21:24] and it was all covered with water and
[1:21:28] was laying there in the dark, dismal,
[1:21:30] gloomy atmosphere.
[1:21:32] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:21:37] water and said, "Let there be light.
[1:21:49] No,
[1:21:53] slide three.
[1:21:59] I want to start partway down. God had a
[1:22:03] reason to do that. God had a reason for
[1:22:07] saying, "Let there be light."
[1:22:09] He had a reason for doing that. For down
[1:22:12] beneath that water,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; there was seeds that he had planted
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; and it had to have that sunlight to make
[1:22:21] it live.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; The first light that ever struck the
[1:22:24] earth was God's spoken word.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be light."
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And there was light. And that turned
[1:22:31] darkness into light in order to bring
[1:22:34] forth a creation of joy and life upon
[1:22:38] the earth.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And that spirit of God, I'll just
[1:22:41] connect it real quickly. That spirit of
[1:22:43] God moved
[1:22:45] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; A rushing mighty wind.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Why? God was God's not just into just
[1:22:52] making a a rushing wind and making a
[1:22:55] sound. That's not the purpose. He moved.
[1:22:58] And where did he move? He moved over
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; where there was some seeds.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; 120 seeds.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Who had heard the spoken word,
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; go ye to Jerusalem
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and Terry.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; And those words, those seed words had
[1:23:19] come down into this earth.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And it was hidden down in this earth.
[1:23:24] And this earth didn't even know what was
[1:23:26] going to happen
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; until the spirit of God came and brooded
[1:23:30] over them.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And life camel.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Life came.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And the life that came when the people
[1:23:41] saw it, they said, "These people must
[1:23:44] have been with Jesus." Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; One of the darkest times, go to the
[1:23:55] church age book and put up the seven
[1:23:58] church ages. And the last one has just a
[1:24:01] little sliver of light. Brother Brandham
[1:24:04] actually says he put that sliver of
[1:24:05] light there. But Leodysia goes out into
[1:24:08] complete darkness.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You sitting in a
[1:24:14] nice church, you're going to sit in a
[1:24:16] nice car, you got gas in the tank,
[1:24:19] you're going to drive home. That doesn't
[1:24:21] mean anything. This is a dark dark.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; This is without light. This generation
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; in fact is when I see the level and the
[1:24:31] depth of the uh the the decrepit
[1:24:34] condition that men and women have come
[1:24:36] to. And you you see it everywhere.
[1:24:41] I marvel how God has spared this
[1:24:44] country.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; How God has spared the earth.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It's going to come to a full
[1:24:49] destruction.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God, a vindicated
[1:24:54] prophet, said God's going to burn it up.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; He's going to renovate it
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; and make it a fit place for a holy God
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; and a holy people. Does this
[1:25:06] congregation believe that? Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And in this generation,
[1:25:18] as dark as it is, as corrupted as it is,
[1:25:22] truth, to find truth in this day,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; is a miracle in itself.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; If God didn't bring truth to you, you
[1:25:30] could never find it.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And that's why some of you have spent a
[1:25:34] good part of your life searching it here
[1:25:35] and searching it there. and you've been
[1:25:37] in this church and that church, you've
[1:25:38] been in the world. You've listened to
[1:25:40] this philosophy and all of these things
[1:25:42] and weren't able to find the truth
[1:25:44] because it's not there.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, you heard you heard parts of truth,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; but that is not the truth I'm speaking
[1:25:53] about this morning.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And some are going to get the idea,
[1:25:57] well, you feel very confident. You feel
[1:26:00] overconfident. You feel uh almost on the
[1:26:03] point of being arrogant. No, we're not
[1:26:06] arrogant,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; but we have to be absolutely certain
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; that this that we believe is truth.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe it? It was vindicated
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; and I didn't produce the vindication.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; I might say, I understand this that's
[1:26:23] being said, but I have no and no one
[1:26:26] here and no human can say we confirmed
[1:26:30] it. That's right.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You didn't confirm it. God confirmed it.
[1:26:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; You want to just go back and listen to a
[1:26:38] message, go back and choose any message
[1:26:40] you want where there's a a a prayer line
[1:26:43] on the end or a healing line on the end
[1:26:46] and just listen to it and ask yourself
[1:26:48] who's doing that.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And once you decide who's doing it, then
[1:26:54] whoever that is, you better you better
[1:26:56] sell out to it.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to it.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And I say you'll be giving yourself out
[1:27:02] to God Almighty. Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Who can understand God? Who can
[1:27:07] understand this God?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; There were seeds that were planted and
[1:27:17] God had planted certain seeds.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; That were going to come up in this
[1:27:22] generation
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; in a different time.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; We just dedicated a little fellow Jesse
[1:27:29] Oed.
[1:27:30] And not too many years before that, his
[1:27:34] mother and dad were just seeds. And all
[1:27:36] of us that were here, we were just
[1:27:38] seeds.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You were just seed
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; lodged in your mother's womb.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And almighty God allowed conception.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't the first one from the man
[1:27:55] to the woman's egg that bumped into.
[1:27:59] Maybe he said the prophet says they
[1:28:02] watching it in artificial incimination.
[1:28:05] There's millions of them in there and
[1:28:07] they moving everybody moving and the
[1:28:09] sperm is the germ is hitting this one
[1:28:12] and that one and moving on and finally
[1:28:14] he said it might be right at the back
[1:28:16] wall. Might it be at the very and it'll
[1:28:19] hit that one and conception takes place.
[1:28:23] The color of your hair, the color of
[1:28:24] your eyes, everything about you, your
[1:28:27] nature, everything is there
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; and it comes forth. Who did that?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Who made that choice?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; God planted certain ones.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; The rest has just been flesh.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And this might be hard to say, but he
[1:28:46] used one term, atomic f
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; and people withdraw from that.
[1:28:51] Oh, a terrible thing to say. Well, what
[1:28:54] about the graveyard? Go to the
[1:28:56] graveyard.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; How many of them are in heaven?
[1:28:58] Everybody likes to think it's all in
[1:29:00] heaven.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Don't be deceived, friends.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; It's not heaven.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You don't want to think about hell.
[1:29:07] Jesus spoke more about hell than he
[1:29:09] spoke about heaven.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; And we are to make our calling and
[1:29:13] election cure.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; We're not going on a gravy bed. We're
[1:29:18] not going on a rose bed of ease. We're
[1:29:21] in a battle.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; The battle of the right against wrong.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; The truth against untruth.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; How do we know what's true? How do you
[1:29:31] know what to fight for? How do you know
[1:29:33] what to stand for?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; It's not a church.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; The church is on every corner. It's got
[1:29:39] to be something that's happened inside
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; that the spirit of truth
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; has come into you
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; and is confirming and making known the
[1:29:49] truth of God's word.
[1:30:00] So in the beginning, the spirit of God
[1:30:03] moved over the face of the waters
[1:30:05] because there were seeds down there. In
[1:30:07] the message, turn on the light. He said
[1:30:09] God knew that he had need of light.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; His seed was already in the earth
[1:30:16] because he had planted it there.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And now he needed light to bring forth
[1:30:22] that seed
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; to make that seed live because the seed
[1:30:26] was already there.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Listen now. I've highlighted this red
[1:30:31] and yellow. The only thing he needs,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; is the manifestation
[1:30:38] of the light of God.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Something to manifest the manifestation
[1:30:42] of the light of God upon the scripture
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; to make it live
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; for that age. Amen.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And thus when the messenger when brother
[1:30:54] Brandham's ministry was sent out onto
[1:30:57] the earth, it was to manifest. And the
[1:31:01] manifestation made this word live. And
[1:31:04] that manifestation was light.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And others saw it. And that and that
[1:31:10] light gave life to what was in them
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; and said that's true.
[1:31:20] for the promise of the day. Then God
[1:31:23] planted one in his likeness
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden.
[1:31:30] From Adam, he made Eve.
[1:31:33] Just follow the story, please. We see
[1:31:36] them as the masterpiece family, God
[1:31:38] calls them, in the Garden of Eden. And
[1:31:42] while God rested, his enemy crawled
[1:31:45] under the garden walls. Brother Brandham
[1:31:48] says
[1:31:50] to his masterpiece, "His enemy crawls
[1:31:52] under the garden walls and marred
[1:31:56] and caused that beautiful family to
[1:31:58] fall."
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; But the great sculptor,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; wasn't willing just to leave his
[1:32:04] masterpiece, lay there in ruin.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; He went to work immediately
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; to build it up again.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And over the centuries of
[1:32:16] time,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; finally one came the perfect one,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; the masterpiece himself.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; At last I quote now at last. Coming up
[1:32:28] through that finally comes the
[1:32:30] masterpiece. He called it the perfect
[1:32:33] one.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; No fault in him at all.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; So perfect reflected the builder
[1:32:39] himself. Yes.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; His own image was reflected in his work.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And God and Christ were one in so much
[1:32:48] until he put his own spirit into him.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The builder put his own
[1:32:53] spirit into the image.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And then even the image and the builder
[1:32:57] became one. God and his sculpture work.
[1:33:01] His masterpiece.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] this masterpiece
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; full of grace,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; full of truth,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; the first one that came up to full
[1:33:16] maturity.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; A ripe grain
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and according to the Old Testament in
[1:33:24] the scripture, the first ripe grain that
[1:33:26] is to come up is to be cut down. Yeah.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And so God speaking to Moses said,
[1:33:33] "Speak to the children of Israel and say
[1:33:36] unto them, when you come into your land,
[1:33:39] in other words, when you come to
[1:33:41] maturity,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; which I give unto you, you shall reap
[1:33:46] the harvest thereof, and then you shall
[1:33:49] bring a sheep of the first fruits,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; of your harvest,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; to the priest."
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Not to the prophet. No,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; you don't bring this to Moses.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; But you bring this to the priest
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; because this was a perfect perfect
[1:34:07] reflection of what was going to happen
[1:34:10] in the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Because when he was on earth,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; he was the God prophet
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and he filled out his pro life as a
[1:34:19] prophet. Then he died and shed his blood
[1:34:23] and ascended with his own blood because
[1:34:25] only the priest took the blood in
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; to the holy of holies and he ascended to
[1:34:31] the very throne of God
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; to as a declaration.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; The price has been paid.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Death is defeated.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; In the day thou eatest thereof, thou
[1:34:43] shalt surely die. But now the power of
[1:34:46] death was broken.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And he was the first ripe chief.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And the prophet, oh read the rising of
[1:34:58] the sun. Listen to it. And the prophet
[1:35:00] said, the priest, you take this chief to
[1:35:03] the priest
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; because now he had become priest
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; and he was waved over the people
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; and it was a memorial. The priest waved
[1:35:14] it. Not the prophet, but the priest
[1:35:16] waved it. And so as Jesus entered his
[1:35:19] priesthood, he waved the sheath
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; over the people
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; over the seed
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; because it was a declaration, there are
[1:35:29] more like me in the field.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; It was a memorial to God. Father, the
[1:35:41] plan, your thoughts, they're true.
[1:35:45] There's more like me in the field.
[1:35:48] Hallelujah. And they shall rise like I
[1:35:51] have risen.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; They will conquer death as I have
[1:35:55] conquered death.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, saints?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't have time. And I love to
[1:36:10] be able to take time and let you know
[1:36:14] brother Brandham's ministry
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; spread even beyond
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; prophet
[1:36:21] sir
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; because the word that came out of his
[1:36:23] mouth
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; was the winding up of the priesthood.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He was the prophet. Moses was the
[1:36:32] prophet. His brother was the priest.
[1:36:34] Yes.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; William Brandon was the prophet.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; But what came out of his mouth was
[1:36:42] Christ.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; The word was Christ.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And again today, he's
[1:36:50] waved over the people."
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a prophet waved over the
[1:36:57] people. It was the word. And I'm telling
[1:36:59] you today, maybe you never heard it
[1:37:01] before, but the word is still being
[1:37:02] waved over the people as a memorial to
[1:37:06] God. There's more like me in the field.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus people,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus children,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; family of God.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You won't hear this in the Baptist
[1:37:30] or Pentecostal church.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; We believe it. We believe it because
[1:37:39] this entire message,
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; it is the rising of the sun. Not is it
[1:37:44] the rising of the sun, it is the rising
[1:37:46] of the sun.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:54] And he said he's and he shall wave it
[1:37:56] over the he shall wave the sheath before
[1:37:58] the Lord to be accepted for you.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; On the tomorrow
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; after the Sabbath
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; when the when the priest went in and
[1:38:08] waved the sheath, there's just a sheath
[1:38:10] that grew out of the earth.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; But here the people were standing there.
[1:38:13] Their bodies came out of the earth, too.
[1:38:15] And their bodies, they're going to die
[1:38:17] and they're going to be buried back in
[1:38:18] the earth. and dust is going to go to
[1:38:20] dust.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; There is no hope. There's no hope there
[1:38:24] sexual birth. I don't care who you are.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of thought you
[1:38:29] have. I'm not interested in human
[1:38:30] thought. I'm interested in what God has
[1:38:32] said.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in what a prophet has
[1:38:35] spoken.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And he said this when it's waved,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; it's a memorial to God.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that there's more
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; like him
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; that are still in the field.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; They've got to come forth. You had to
[1:38:54] come forth.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And you came forth in a very, very dark,
[1:38:58] dismal time. You talk about a chaotic
[1:39:01] time. You came forth in an age when
[1:39:03] there is no answers.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; The wisest men on earth are seeking
[1:39:08] answers. economic answers, unrest,
[1:39:12] answers, riots, answers for riots,
[1:39:15] answers for health, answers for youth,
[1:39:18] answers for all kinds of things. Police
[1:39:21] are looking for answers. The
[1:39:23] criminologists are looking for,
[1:39:25] everybody's looking for answers.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; All kinds of counselors seeking answers.
[1:39:32] There is no answer
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; outside of the truth of God's word.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there's no help. There
[1:39:39] can be help, but the kind of help you as
[1:39:42] a son and daughter of God need is truth.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Absolute truth.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Vindicated truth.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And there isn't two vindicated truths.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; There isn't two.
[1:40:03] So, I'm going to get bring it down till
[1:40:04] it squeaks
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; and then it'll be on your lap
[1:40:11] to make your decision. I'm telling you
[1:40:14] where I'm at.
[1:40:18] In the rising of the sun, he said it was
[1:40:20] the first corn of God's wheat.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You listen, this is not just a quote.
[1:40:26] This is words
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; of God's vindicated prophet voice.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And right after he would speak, how many
[1:40:36] times he would say,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; "Now I'm call him on the scene.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come and prove,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; prove is another word for vindicate.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't prove what I've spoken is
[1:40:48] the truth,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; the truth,
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; then forget it.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Did he ever fail?"
[1:40:56] There's not one time that you'll ever
[1:40:58] find that this mighty God failed to come
[1:41:01] on the scene and prove it was the
[1:41:04] supernatural.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That being that here was not him. It was
[1:41:09] Christ.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; That's the only Christ that you'll ever
[1:41:15] sense and feel.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He's in another realm. He's in another
[1:41:18] dimension. You cannot possibly get
[1:41:20] closer to him than to believe the words
[1:41:23] that he spoke through that veil.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; That's the closest you'll ever get to
[1:41:28] God
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; till you pass off of this scene.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; He'd been raised from the dead,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; God's first corn of wheat
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; by God's quickening power.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; He was the first fruit of those that
[1:41:45] slept. Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; There's many that slept, but he was the
[1:41:48] first fruits of those that slept.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; He was that she
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; That's why they had to wave that sheath
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; for it was the first one
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; that came to maturity.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And it was waved as a memorial of
[1:42:01] thanksgiving to God,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; believing, believing that the rest of
[1:42:07] them would come.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, someone believed for you
[1:42:12] before you have arrived. Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Even back in the Old Testament, that
[1:42:20] priest was just waving a a live sheath
[1:42:22] of wheat that came up. But that even in
[1:42:26] that waving was on your behalf
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; because he believed as a memorial the
[1:42:32] rest of them would come.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And I rejoice.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; I rejoice. And you ought to be rejoice.
[1:42:42] Say, "Lord, here I am."
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I've arrived.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And it was a sign. And today, because he
[1:43:03] was the first son of God to come to full
[1:43:06] maturity to be in God, he was plucked up
[1:43:08] from the earth and waved over the
[1:43:11] people.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; He was waved over just another place
[1:43:15] quickly. He was waved over the promised
[1:43:18] seed
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; that had the promise of life.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; He was waved over the promised seed.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know this message? Let me put it
[1:43:26] into terms that you can understand.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; This message was being preached.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it went into space because the
[1:43:33] words are never lost.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; And the spa and the and the space that
[1:43:38] is here right this minute,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; right in this room is voices.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; And the voices never die.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; They just keep on going.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Don't consider me a fanatic.
[1:43:56] Through this room is going Brother's
[1:43:59] voice. Amen.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:07] And I want to be sure I'm saying what he
[1:44:09] said
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; because what he said was vindicated by
[1:44:15] almighty God.
[1:44:19] Through this voice is going cursing and
[1:44:22] damning and words of devils and
[1:44:24] doctrines of devils and all kinds of
[1:44:27] things through this room is going man's
[1:44:29] ideas all kinds of conver business and
[1:44:33] all kinds of political conversation
[1:44:35] going through this room. But going
[1:44:37] through this room is the voice of God's
[1:44:40] confirmed vindicated messenger.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; What is it doing? It's being waved.
[1:44:49] over the sea.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And there's people here raising up and
[1:44:55] saying, "I believe.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; I believe that voice."
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; You young men believe.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You young ladies believe.
[1:45:16] This congregation believes
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; out on the internet. Do you believe
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; the voice
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; from heaven
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; is here
[1:45:28] [applause]
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; glory. [applause]
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; It's here to wash you
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; if you need to be washed. Yeah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; It's here to deliver you
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; if you need to be delivered. It's here
[1:45:49] to heal you if you need to be healed.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; The voice of God coming through the
[1:45:55] room. I am the Lord that health thee.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just some nice song. I believe
[1:46:02] that Jesus
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; loves me.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's a nice thought. It's not some
[1:46:08] poetry. It's something that agrees with
[1:46:11] this
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; and disagrees. Just think of it. I got a
[1:46:14] Bible here, but I got a voice going
[1:46:17] through the room
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; that God confirmed in this Bible.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; This Bible spoke about seven seals. I
[1:46:23] got a voice going through here saying
[1:46:26] the seals are open.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Now, why wouldn't we believe that voice?
[1:46:40] And the prophet says on the other side,
[1:46:43] it's not at the judgment, you will hear
[1:46:45] your own voice.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It says, "And let me hear my voice."
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to remind people what
[1:46:56] they said. It will be replayed
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; because God created a dimension to hold
[1:47:02] your voice.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; We be careful what we say
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; and all these partial truths
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; which I'm going to come to in a few
[1:47:16] moments.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Help me as I get through this service.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks about the coming
[1:47:22] of the Holy Ghost in this last days.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And in the message, who is this?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Says coming up over the hill was a
[1:47:28] little donkey. A little donkey. Nobody
[1:47:31] paid any attention to him.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Think of this. the creator of heavens
[1:47:36] and earth coming in a humble way on a
[1:47:39] donkey and nobody paid any attention to
[1:47:41] him. Why? Because it's just another
[1:47:43] donkey
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; with another man.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; It may be just another church, another
[1:47:48] group of people, but there's a big
[1:47:51] difference to God.
[1:47:53] those that are his seed.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Nobody paid attention to him,
[1:48:03] but those who are looking for him."
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you didn't come to this service
[1:48:08] this morning expecting to hear a sermon.
[1:48:10] I want you to be looking for him.
[1:48:14] He says they cut down branches and they
[1:48:17] ran screaming hosana to the son of David
[1:48:20] that comes in the name of the Lord. He
[1:48:22] said he said something had to take
[1:48:25] place.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I say this morning friends we can't just
[1:48:30] go on as you know we're here
[1:48:31] fellowshipping around the message.
[1:48:33] Something has to come take place
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; because he who sat on the donkey's
[1:48:39] present he's come down.
[1:48:44] Something had to take place.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; He said the living Christ
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; was amongst the living people.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Something has to take place.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; You can sit beside someone else. You
[1:48:56] might sit right next to them. You might
[1:48:58] even be touching shoulders with them.
[1:49:00] And one is being quickened by the word
[1:49:03] that is being preached. Not just
[1:49:05] excited, quickened in the soul.
[1:49:08] And if you're not being quickened,
[1:49:09] you're the one that ought to get
[1:49:10] earnest.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Got to say, Almighty God,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; you who sent this word,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; touch this soul of mine.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Move me, brood over me. Bring forth
[1:49:24] life.
[1:49:26] Not my life, not the life of Edis or the
[1:49:29] life of you got from your natural birth,
[1:49:31] but the life of eternal
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; guallelujah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:42] Amen.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; He said the coming of the Holy Ghost in
[1:49:45] this last days
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; has caused has caused somewhat in like
[1:49:50] manner
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; stir amongst the people of the coming of
[1:49:54] the Holy Ghost in these last days. He
[1:49:56] said a second time has sent forth a
[1:49:59] revival a people that's called out.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; When that ministry went around the
[1:50:04] world, they didn't realize it was the
[1:50:07] coming of the Holy Ghost in this
[1:50:09] generation.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; I say he has come.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; The world went on. They don't know
[1:50:24] anything about it.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. Jesus has come.
[1:50:28] They didn't know anything about it. They
[1:50:29] went on with their lives and selling
[1:50:31] their wares. That didn't change God's
[1:50:34] plan. They could go on. The world will
[1:50:37] go on. You'll continue to go to your
[1:50:39] job. You'll continue to do your work,
[1:50:41] continue to pay your bills and all the
[1:50:43] rest of it, continue to come to church.
[1:50:45] But when you come to the house of God, I
[1:50:48] trust that your soul comes under the
[1:50:50] brooding
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; and you will listen to every servant of
[1:50:56] God.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "A people that's a called out,
[1:51:05] separated people, a people that's free
[1:51:07] in their religion."
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] that shouts
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; and screams
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; and praises God.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday as brother Tom was preaching
[1:51:27] and the Holy Spirit fell on you as a
[1:51:29] congregation and it was just like a
[1:51:32] waters of worship and praise.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; And glory to God. I tell you what,
[1:51:38] that's not something that man does.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; If man does it, we don't need it.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; But when God does it,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; God does it because, you know, this
[1:51:46] message came and we're standing for a
[1:51:49] vindicated message.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Don't ever get tired of the word
[1:51:52] vindicated.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; It is proven.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You get into a court of law, they want
[1:51:59] to know that you were a witness and you
[1:52:02] saw certain things. You experienced
[1:52:04] certain things. My ears heard certain
[1:52:07] things and I know that that's the truth.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Outside of that, you're disqualified.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And I guess I ought to know.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was there when he revealed
[1:52:28] this word to me.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm forever thankful for I
[1:52:33] was able to sit on a log. Now I read
[1:52:36] this recently in a message where brother
[1:52:38] Brandon was criticized. Suppose he's I
[1:52:40] read it to you. Suppose he's going
[1:52:42] hunting again. This man said I suppose
[1:52:44] he's going hunting again up in Canada.
[1:52:47] Said yeah he did. Ah he said it's
[1:52:50] nonsense.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said I if that man
[1:52:54] called me to pray for him it wouldn't do
[1:52:58] any good. Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Imagine
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; a man could have the privilege of having
[1:53:03] Elijah
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; standing at his bedside
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; praying for his healing or praying for
[1:53:09] his deliverance or praying for his
[1:53:11] problem. And he disqualified himself.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; And I read that and tears come to my
[1:53:18] eyes. He said, "I went there by vision."
[1:53:21] I said, "Oh God, I'm so glad you went
[1:53:24] there and waved this word over my soul.
[1:53:28] I had to sit on that log.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; He had to come north.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; But South had to come north.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Sister Debbie had blessed me the other
[1:53:43] day when you called me over to your
[1:53:46] counter and we were just chatting
[1:53:49] and Sister Debbie said, "Oh," she laid
[1:53:52] her hand on a a disc, a DVD that had
[1:53:55] just been done. who just packaging it.
[1:53:58] He said, "I I just got a I just got a
[1:54:00] request for DVD
[1:54:03] of your testimony. I'm a witness
[1:54:07] and it comes from Rocky Southwick,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Southwick's second son."
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; That's not an accident.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I just pray God bless Rocky and Wanda,
[1:54:22] his wife. Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; When they see that, their hearts will be
[1:54:25] stirred to remember.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was there and saw many of
[1:54:31] those things. You just don't know. The
[1:54:33] message continues to ripple out.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God." He went to the far
[1:54:39] reaches of the northern British
[1:54:41] Columbia.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; The called out, separated.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; People free from their religion. said,
[1:54:51] "The spirit of the living God lives in
[1:54:53] them."
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; And that's why they cry out and that's
[1:54:56] why they can't hold their peace. That's
[1:54:58] why they can't hold their peace.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; There comes a time when you can't hold
[1:55:03] your peace any longer.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Don't afraid. You won't scare me
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and you won't scare God.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, God's not
[1:55:16] deaf."
[1:55:18] Well, I'll tell you, you can't make him
[1:55:20] deaf either.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; You can't deafen him.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; I think God actually likes to see the
[1:55:28] smile in your face.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, he said like
[1:55:33] the Pentecostals experience today
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and the coming of the Holy Ghost in
[1:55:37] these la in this last days
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; was promised. It's like the abstract of
[1:55:42] a title deed.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; It struck off. It's like an abstract.
[1:55:46] Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; The abstract came, folks.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; The abstract came.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; The abstract is the only thing that can
[1:55:53] trace it back to the beginning
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and pay off any debt that's there.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And give you an abstract that means
[1:56:00] free.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; God didn't give you an abstract with
[1:56:04] part of your sins hanging on there. We
[1:56:07] all were cheats or whatever more. An
[1:56:10] abstract is clear. It is. He said,
[1:56:13] remember Elijah's words now. Don't
[1:56:15] invent some other words. Struck off.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, you can get a little you
[1:56:29] can get a a title." Sure, you can get a
[1:56:32] title to a place, but that still don't
[1:56:35] say it's yours.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Somebody way back yonder could
[1:56:41] come in and put a claim on it. But when
[1:56:43] you get an abstract, that shows that
[1:56:46] everything that's ever against it is
[1:56:50] struck off,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; plumb back to the foundation.
[1:56:57] [cheering]
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; We all are sinners.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; It's struck off.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Plumb back to the beginning.
[1:57:11] And when a man has said,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; get this please real close. And when a
[1:57:16] man has said that he believes the word
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; and then when the Holy Spirit comes,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; it is the abstract of the title. The
[1:57:27] Holy Spirit is the abstract of the title
[1:57:30] because it's the Holy Spirit. The spirit
[1:57:32] of God brooded over that body that was
[1:57:35] still in the tomb and he was raised.
[1:57:37] Jesus was raised. The spirit of God
[1:57:40] brooded over him. He was raised as a
[1:57:42] testimony that sin was destroyed. Sin
[1:57:46] was finished. He has the abstract.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes upon you and
[1:57:51] confirms the word that you've heard,
[1:57:53] you've heard the word and then
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit comes,
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; he holds the abstract
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing.
[1:58:04] God wouldn't tolerate Satan to hold a
[1:58:07] claim on your life.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't stand for that.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It's clear back to the beginning.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; When people think or begin to feel,
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; I'm okay,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; just hold your nose cuz that stinks.
[1:58:38] It's filthy rags.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm all right. You know, I'm not
[1:58:43] doing too bad.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; That smells.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; It's a stench in God's nostrils.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And God hates self-righteousness.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:01] were sinners of the worst kind.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; That God has saved.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Quickly, I must hurry. And when a man
[1:59:11] believes the word and then when the Holy
[1:59:13] Spirit comes, it's the abstract
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; that gives you permission. When you have
[1:59:18] that abstract, that every bit of that
[1:59:20] belongs to you and everything's on its
[1:59:23] bin belongs to you and it gives you an
[1:59:26] abstract. The Holy Ghost comes a whole
[1:59:29] paragraph on it if you wanted. It is
[1:59:30] also in the rising of the sun, but I
[1:59:33] don't have time. And only he who held
[1:59:35] the abstract was qualified to search
[1:59:38] against any claims.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Only he who has the abstract. I haven't
[1:59:42] got the you or I. We don't have the
[1:59:45] right to search.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; We couldn't possibly search.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; If we're going to search, we'd have to
[1:59:51] search first our own.
[1:59:56] But the Holy Spirit is the only one who
[1:59:59] searches.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:00:04] Have I got a few more minutes?
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; There's a true and false to everything.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; There's an impersonation.
[2:00:17] If there's a person impersonation,
[2:00:19] there's got to be a truth somewhere.
[2:00:21] Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I just look to check out
[2:00:26] and say, now those of you that have some
[2:00:28] building experience,
[2:00:30] there's a true square
[2:00:33] and there's a false square.
[2:00:36] Something that's true square has four
[2:00:38] sides.
[2:00:41] They're all equal.
[2:00:43] They can't just be equal. They be kind
[2:00:45] of skewed a wee bit,
[2:00:47] but they're equal and they're true
[2:00:49] square. And the true square is has to be
[2:00:52] a true 90 degrees at every corner. And
[2:00:55] then you have a true square.
[2:01:00] Brother Brandham talks about some true
[2:01:01] things. Can I just give you a list
[2:01:04] quickly?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; These are all true. A true, there's a
[2:01:09] true God. Soon as you say true, then you
[2:01:13] can say there's a false.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; A true God, a true angel of God.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. A true prophet, true apostle,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; true teacher, true pastor,
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; true watchman,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; steward of God, a true messenger of God,
[2:01:30] true shepherd, true deacon, true
[2:01:32] disciples, man of God, true servant,
[2:01:36] true woman, a true believer, a true
[2:01:39] worshipper, a bride, a witness. I have
[2:01:41] to go quickly. A friend, a true friend.
[2:01:46] Right.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; You all figured you had friend,
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; friend. Then you discovered something
[2:01:54] else. True friend, a true physician.
[2:01:59] There's a quack physician.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; There's a true fellowship, true oneness,
[2:02:05] a true message, a true voice, a true
[2:02:07] statement, a true gospel, a true
[2:02:09] baptism,
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; a true sincere heart, a true gift of
[2:02:12] God, a true vision. There's false
[2:02:14] visions. Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; There's a true sound, true sign, true
[2:02:18] repentance, true testimony, confession,
[2:02:21] revelation, a true interpretation, a
[2:02:23] true conversion,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; a true experience, a true compass, a
[2:02:27] true gift, a true interpreter of that
[2:02:30] dream, a true fulllength surrendered
[2:02:33] heart.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; A true vine, true assurance, a true
[2:02:37] Christian life.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. A true story, unadulterated faith,
[2:02:42] a true uh true church, a true seed of
[2:02:46] Abraham,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; true religion,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; spirit of God, a true branch, a true
[2:02:52] preacher's lips.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:55] A true born again sheep. Hallelujah.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; A true Bible teaching. A true cut
[2:03:00] diamond. A true Pentecost. A true
[2:03:02] report. True love. True token. True mark
[2:03:06] of God. A true road map
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; to his power.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; I love that one. A true road map to his
[2:03:14] power.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; True predestination.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; A true representation.
[2:03:19] A true stand. A true light. A true
[2:03:21] trial. And a true answer.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that wasn't even all of them.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; So now you see why I couldn't speak a
[2:03:32] whole subject on the truth.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; I was lost.
[2:03:37] I was swimming
[2:03:39] in the first few lines. Couldn't
[2:03:42] possibly get to it. So these are there
[2:03:46] are true and that is what is true and
[2:03:48] very very specific. We know that when
[2:03:51] you see a sign, he speaks of a true
[2:03:54] Bible sign. There's a true Bible voice
[2:03:59] behind it.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; And now before I before I close, I want
[2:04:05] to nail it down.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; With the vindication
[2:04:09] in the angel of the Lord, I'm I'm
[2:04:12] abbreviating these. He said, "A man can
[2:04:15] say almost a man can say most anything."
[2:04:19] And I will admit that there's been much
[2:04:22] said in the name of the Lord.
[2:04:25] In the name of the Lord that is not of
[2:04:28] the Lord.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming to partial truth and this
[2:04:32] really is the hub.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; This is the core of my message. I've got
[2:04:36] to finish it very quickly.
[2:04:42] He found much has been said in the name
[2:04:45] of the Lord that is not of the Lord. But
[2:04:47] God would never testify or vindicate
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; a lie.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; God will always vindicate the truth
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; and never a lie.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; God is not an author of lies and
[2:05:06] confusion. He's the author of peace
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; and truth and holiness and righteousness
[2:05:13] and peace. God always testifies of the
[2:05:18] truth.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Now, to vindicate,
[2:05:22] please catch this. You're not too weary?
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; To vindicate is to assert
[2:05:31] or to defend
[2:05:34] or to maintain. And this I want to dwell
[2:05:37] on a wee bit. To maintain successfully
[2:05:41] as correct.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] To vindicate is to confirm or to
[2:05:48] maintain to give
[2:05:51] give uh the confirmation that this is
[2:05:55] correct.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a preacher using as a as
[2:06:01] brother Brandham used
[2:06:03] vindication? If he doesn't vindicate it,
[2:06:07] it's false.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Who says that?
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, you're not saying
[2:06:13] it." No, but I am saying that the truth
[2:06:16] that I believe
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; wholeheartedly
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; and completely
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; and will preach from any and every part
[2:06:23] of it
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; there's nothing in the message we
[2:06:27] wouldn't speak of.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; It is God's vindicated truth
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; to us. Our faith is anchored in that.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; You might feel that I'm overdoing it. I
[2:06:38] don't feel I'm overdoing it.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. If you
[2:06:41] think I'm overdoing it, outside of it,
[2:06:44] you're totally at a drift.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; There is outside of that, you're
[2:06:50] completely a drift. You wouldn't you
[2:06:52] don't have any place to anchor your
[2:06:55] faith or your confession.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; To maintain successfully as correct. And
[2:07:06] then he stands and says, "Father,
[2:07:09] now vindicate
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; what I've said as the truth
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; or right."
[2:07:19] And to vindicate is to maintain as
[2:07:22] correct, right?
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Or just against accusation and reproach.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; And folks, listen to me
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; closely.
[2:07:33] You can do all your other things and
[2:07:35] think about anything else but just abide
[2:07:38] for a few moments now.
[2:07:41] There is so much
[2:07:45] just horrific things spoken against this
[2:07:48] message,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; sickening things,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; things that are dark
[2:07:56] evil.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; I read some report and I just came
[2:08:00] across it accidentally. I was doing some
[2:08:02] search for the for the message this
[2:08:04] morning and I found someone was saying
[2:08:06] something about William Brandham.
[2:08:08] There's there's a fellow down here
[2:08:10] actually. He's down in uh Tanzania I
[2:08:15] think. What's that island off Australia?
[2:08:17] He's down there brother sister friend.
[2:08:20] He's down your area. I I'm glad he's
[2:08:23] there. Just keep him there.
[2:08:28] He's Muslim.
[2:08:30] He's a he's a white white fellow and
[2:08:33] he's Muslim.
[2:08:35] Talks all about Allah and so and so
[2:08:37] forth. He's the Messiah.
[2:08:39] He's the risen one.
[2:08:42] And gave his name. I had to search for
[2:08:44] his name because he's got all this, you
[2:08:46] know, high flutin kind of name. So I
[2:08:49] searched for his name and got his name
[2:08:52] and then I typed his name in with
[2:08:54] William Brham. Bingo.
[2:08:57] Sure enough. You know, they try to tie
[2:09:00] brother Brandham's name to everything
[2:09:02] and the most horrific, unbelievable
[2:09:06] stuff and garbage that you and I I begin
[2:09:09] to follow that out a wee bit and how he
[2:09:12] ever got linked to this guy. And then
[2:09:13] there are people that came out against
[2:09:15] him.
[2:09:17] Correct. But in so doing, they felt they
[2:09:20] needed to justify themselves and come
[2:09:22] against brother Brandham as well. and
[2:09:24] the things they spoke and one of the
[2:09:27] statements here's these guys so
[2:09:29] authorative
[2:09:31] and you might read down there and say
[2:09:33] well you know what
[2:09:35] that that sounds correct
[2:09:39] and people that read that I feel sorry
[2:09:41] for people who don't know and don't have
[2:09:43] the Holy Spirit of truth
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; will tell you inside right away that's a
[2:09:51] big lie
[2:09:54] And
[2:09:55] so I just read a little bit down. Excuse
[2:09:57] me for taking this time. I just read a
[2:09:58] little bit down. They said William Brham
[2:10:01] came out of northern Saskatchewan.
[2:10:06] Wow. Wouldn't the people in Jefferson
[2:10:09] Ind Indiana like to hear about this?
[2:10:13] So he come out of there out of a group
[2:10:15] called the Latter Rain. This fellow is
[2:10:18] so completely confused and mixed up he
[2:10:20] ought to go and start school all over
[2:10:22] again. He ought to learn what the basics
[2:10:25] of of writing. Before you write
[2:10:27] something, you want to be at least
[2:10:29] somewhere near the truth.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even anywhere near the truth.
[2:10:33] He's not in the right country.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; He's not He He's only on the right
[2:10:38] continent.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; He might as well throw a dart with a
[2:10:41] blindfold over his eyes and he'd be
[2:10:43] about as as correct as he is there. And
[2:10:45] then I went on and and another
[2:10:47] completely erroneous statement. I don't
[2:10:49] even I I just look at say, "Where in the
[2:10:51] world could he get it?" You know what?
[2:10:53] He never read a message.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; He never read a message.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't give that up. Any message
[2:11:02] would have told him that wasn't right.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; So a person's going to write and blab it
[2:11:07] to the whole world.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; So this is something a new discovery.
[2:11:14] You're going to explain why it's a false
[2:11:15] prophet. And how many people believe it
[2:11:18] for one reason or another? You people
[2:11:20] that are seated here, I thank God
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; I have a confidence in my heart
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; that you are here because you believe
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; that God spoke truth
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; and now I'm encouraging you to believe
[2:11:33] all
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; that he said.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; This is not a smorgus board where you
[2:11:38] choose what you like and leave what you
[2:11:40] don't like. It is a it's a it's we live
[2:11:44] by every
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; word of God. Amen.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Quickly, I must go because
[2:11:57] truth requires the spirit of truth to
[2:12:01] guide us into all truth.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us. But now in the
[2:12:05] fourth seal,
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; he said, "Remember that the Bible says
[2:12:09] that in the last days,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; that this antichrist would deceive the
[2:12:14] whole world."
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to ask you people here
[2:12:18] or all that are on the internet or ever
[2:12:20] be streaming a service, are we in this
[2:12:23] world?
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Well, yes, we are.
[2:12:28] This messenger has said that the
[2:12:31] antichrist
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; is going to deceive the whole world.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; No apologies from this end.
[2:12:43] I'm going to tell you clearly
[2:12:47] because I'll be responsible for these
[2:12:49] words one day. You are a candidate
[2:12:52] for either the truth
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; or the antichrist.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; And I have to tell you, there is no in
[2:13:01] between ground.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to be persuaded by one or
[2:13:06] the other.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; How many of this congregation would
[2:13:11] agree with that?
[2:13:15] We are candidates. Every human is a
[2:13:18] candidate for one of those two
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; friends.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; I say to you as a brother, as a friend,
[2:13:24] God,
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; save us
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; from the influence
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; and the atmosphere.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; And the environment
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; of the Antichrist.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; And John said way back then, the
[2:13:41] antichrist, the spirit of antichrist is
[2:13:43] already here.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; So, how will God, how will a just God
[2:13:48] leave a people in the earth,
[2:13:52] his seed? Some of us will come maybe
[2:13:54] easier and some of us will come harder.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what,
[2:13:59] we must not take this message lightly.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; The truth
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; of God's word.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; There'd only be a small number
[2:14:15] whose names were put on the lamb's book
[2:14:18] of life.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. And when
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the true vindication of
[2:14:29] the revealed truth of God's word strikes
[2:14:33] that heart,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; he will strike the water.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; And out yonder with the Holy Ghost
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; just as hard as he can.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't let us say, "Well, you know,
[2:14:49] I think I'll try that." That's not it.
[2:14:51] Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; When the vindicated,
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; truth,
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; the vindicated,
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; confirmed truth
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; of God's word,
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; strikes the heart,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; he'll run out and hit the water as
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; as hard as he can.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; He said you can't stop him
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; from doing it.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to have a young
[2:15:19] fellow baptized. Hallelujah.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Tom's going to baptize one of his
[2:15:24] grandsons.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You know how long we've been holding him
[2:15:28] back? How long?
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; A long time.
[2:15:33] And he never would get off that thought.
[2:15:36] And he would bug his mom and dad
[2:15:40] and he he he it wasn't something it was
[2:15:43] he wanted today and then forget about
[2:15:44] it. Just all the time. I want to be
[2:15:48] baptized.
[2:15:50] when can I be baptized?
[2:15:52] They came to me. I said, "Well, he's
[2:15:54] small."
[2:15:57] And he said, "He's bothering us all the
[2:16:00] time. Week in week out, month in, month
[2:16:02] out, year in and year out. I want to be
[2:16:07] baptized."
[2:16:09] Finally, he found his place in the
[2:16:11] scripture because he became impertunite.
[2:16:15] His impertunity won.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:16:18] Yes,
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; he's going to be baptized. When you see,
[2:16:23] if you can see his head over this, I
[2:16:24] doubt it, but when you see him being
[2:16:26] baptized, I'll tell you that is one
[2:16:28] happy boy.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; He's been asking for this for several
[2:16:32] years, brother Ernie.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; How old is he?
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Six.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Six years old.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Six.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Six.
[2:16:41] You say, "When should it be baptized?"
[2:16:43] Brother Bam said, "Wouldn't they ask?"
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; If we'd have asked, I mean, he'd have
[2:16:47] been baptized long time ago.
[2:16:53] I said this to you and I'm closing with
[2:16:55] it.
[2:16:57] The biggest lie that was ever told,
[2:17:00] there was a whole lot of truth in it.
[2:17:02] Brother Brham said there was 95% truth
[2:17:04] in it
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; from the beginning when Eve believed the
[2:17:08] lie. And then listen to this. in the
[2:17:11] confirmation of of of the commission and
[2:17:14] I want to read a few scriptures.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; He says now you know the biggest lie
[2:17:17] that was ever told there was a whole lot
[2:17:19] of truth in it. That is right. See
[2:17:22] that's if there wasn't truth in it
[2:17:24] people wouldn't be believing it.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of truth and stuff.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; So he said you remember the first lie
[2:17:32] was ever told was 95% truth. And when
[2:17:35] Satan told Eve in the Garden of Eden,
[2:17:37] all the things that God said, he
[2:17:39] admitted.
[2:17:41] So the things that were true, he said,
[2:17:45] "It's true. That's right. Everything
[2:17:49] that God said, he said, that's right."
[2:17:51] But he added, "Surely you'll not die."
[2:17:54] Then we come on into into Deuteronomy.
[2:17:58] Said, "You shall not" He said, "You
[2:18:00] shall not do all the things that you do
[2:18:02] here this day. Every man, here's what
[2:18:05] they were doing. Every man
[2:18:07] whatsoever is right in his own eyes.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say to the congregation
[2:18:14] here, we're fine people, but if we only
[2:18:16] do what's right in our own eyes, it'll
[2:18:18] only be part truth.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; In Judges, in those days where there are
[2:18:25] no king in Israel, but every man did
[2:18:27] that which was right in his own eyes.
[2:18:30] Proverbs, every man, every way of man is
[2:18:33] right in his own eyes, but the Lord
[2:18:35] ponderth the hearts.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to I I want to just
[2:18:41] hurry along here because uh there's a
[2:18:46] there's something I want you to read
[2:18:47] with me
[2:18:51] about
[2:18:54] this partial truth.
[2:18:56] What's part?
[2:18:59] He said, "And it's proven at thy word in
[2:19:02] the message at thy word and it's proven
[2:19:04] to be the truth." Then that settles it.
[2:19:07] And now God wouldn't let me tell you
[2:19:11] part truth.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Everyone alert yet?
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; I need you fully alert for what I'm
[2:19:18] going to read you. In fact, as many of
[2:19:20] you probably don't know, this exists in
[2:19:22] the message.
[2:19:26] I wouldn't tell you part truth and not
[2:19:28] the rest of it. He said he wouldn't
[2:19:32] stand for that.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Fragments
[2:19:42] or partial truth. We're not interested
[2:19:45] in fragments, friend. Amen.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; When it comes to eternal things, when it
[2:19:49] comes to scriptural things,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; you want to be certain
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; that it's all word. All word
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; founded solely upon the word.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; And if there's a little twinge in your
[2:20:02] heart this morning, then I want you to
[2:20:05] listen real close. Now, watch this.
[2:20:06] Brother Brandham deals with something
[2:20:08] here in the Sardisian church age. He
[2:20:11] said if there ever if there was ever a
[2:20:14] time of denominational zeal it was in
[2:20:17] this tragic time. The words of Comminius
[2:20:22] described much of this era.
[2:20:25] Comminius wrote the and this was the
[2:20:28] title one thing needful.
[2:20:31] There's much you could search much on
[2:20:33] that. He compares the world to a
[2:20:36] labyrinth.
[2:20:38] You know what a labyrinth is? It's a
[2:20:40] whole maze. And how do we find our way
[2:20:42] out?
[2:20:44] He compares it to a labyrinth
[2:20:47] and shows that the way out is by leaving
[2:20:50] what is needless and choosing the one
[2:20:53] thing needful, Christ. The great number
[2:20:57] of teachers, he says, is the reason of
[2:21:00] the multitudes of sects for which we
[2:21:04] shall soon have no names left.
[2:21:07] Each church reckons itself as the true
[2:21:11] one, or at least as the purest, truest
[2:21:15] part of it, while among themselves they
[2:21:19] persecute each other with the bitterest
[2:21:21] hatred. No reconciliation is to be hoped
[2:21:25] for between them. They meet enmity with
[2:21:28] irreconcilable
[2:21:30] enmity out of the Bible. And stop there,
[2:21:34] please, and look this way.
[2:21:36] Out of the Bible.
[2:21:39] Out of the truth.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Only truth.
[2:21:45] Out of the Bible they forge,
[2:21:49] they make, they construct
[2:21:52] their different creeds.
[2:21:54] These are their fortresses and bull
[2:21:57] works behind which they entrench
[2:22:00] themselves and resist all attacks.
[2:22:04] I will not say that these confessions of
[2:22:07] faith for we can admit in most cases
[2:22:09] that they are so are bad in themselves.
[2:22:13] In other words, the confessions of faith
[2:22:15] are different confessions of faith.
[2:22:16] Brother Brandham says they're not bad in
[2:22:18] themselves. They become so, however, in
[2:22:22] that they feed the fire of enmity
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; only by putting them away alltogether.
[2:22:30] Everybody say that word allto together.
[2:22:34] That's why he said the one needless
[2:22:35] thing is to have Christ only Christ. And
[2:22:39] by putting away all this other all
[2:22:41] together would it be possible to set to
[2:22:44] work on healing the wounds of the
[2:22:47] church. I'm not even talking about
[2:22:49] denominationalism. I speak of the
[2:22:51] message now worldwide. The message,
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; the message. All believers in the
[2:22:57] message ought to take and read and pray
[2:23:01] over and if necessary fast and wait on
[2:23:04] God until this becomes a reality.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; And Comminius was even ancient far
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; long time ago.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; These things are true, friends. And to
[2:23:20] set at healing the wounds of the church,
[2:23:21] he said to this labyrinth of sex, sex
[2:23:25] and various confessions, another belongs
[2:23:28] the love of disputation. There's more.
[2:23:31] Everybody gets a a a wind of a doctrine
[2:23:34] or an idea. Hey, I'm spending valuable
[2:23:39] time and our resources
[2:23:43] on a large group of people that are have
[2:23:48] been scattered and have been injured and
[2:23:53] have been wounded. And those leaders
[2:23:56] that caused the wounding, they're long
[2:23:59] gone. But the people, dear people,
[2:24:03] sweet, wonderful people, they're seeking
[2:24:06] to
[2:24:08] take a hold of something that is solid
[2:24:10] or take a hold of something that's firm
[2:24:13] and move on in God.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; And I say, God bless them.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; But they say he says in the labyrinth it
[2:24:23] says various confessions and another
[2:24:26] belongs the love of disputation.
[2:24:29] What is attained by it? The love of
[2:24:31] disputation. Well, I believe this with
[2:24:33] this is the way I see it. I need to send
[2:24:34] this out. I need to get this all over
[2:24:36] the world so that everybody believes it
[2:24:38] exactly the way I say it. Did the
[2:24:40] prophet say it exactly that way? You
[2:24:42] know, and I find that what people do now
[2:24:45] with with a search and all of these
[2:24:47] things, I can put this statement
[2:24:48] together, that one together, another one
[2:24:50] together, and then they come with a with
[2:24:52] an obvious with an obvious conclusion.
[2:24:56] And their intent is that you will
[2:24:58] believe the obvious conclusion because
[2:25:01] that is their most glorious revelation
[2:25:03] that has come up with. But when you take
[2:25:05] that glorious revelation, that obvious
[2:25:08] conclusion, you will not find it
[2:25:10] anywhere in the message. And that
[2:25:12] becomes their great pillar. This becomes
[2:25:15] a thing. In fact, as they go as far as
[2:25:17] to say, you can't be in the rapture
[2:25:19] without that. And here the prophet
[2:25:21] didn't say it. I say I don't believe it.
[2:25:25] I reject it. Flatly reject it.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; And then they they they play out for
[2:25:30] years and they catch people. Oh, a
[2:25:33] wonderful revelation. Oh, have you got
[2:25:35] this? And they love to dispute with it.
[2:25:37] And he says, what will be gained by it?
[2:25:40] What will be attained by it? Has a
[2:25:42] single learned strife ever settled ever
[2:25:45] been settled? Never.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Their number has only been increased.
[2:25:53] Satan is the greatest sist is disputer.
[2:25:57] He has never been overcome in a strife
[2:25:59] of words.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham says if
[2:26:02] we get into that, leave it.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; You can't debate with those things.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; In divine service, the words of men are
[2:26:11] usually heard more than the word of God.
[2:26:14] Each one chatters as he pleases or kills
[2:26:17] time by learned disquisitions and
[2:26:20] disproving the views of others of the
[2:26:23] new birth and how a man must be changed
[2:26:25] into the likeness of Christ to become
[2:26:28] partaker of the divine nature. Second
[2:26:30] Peter 1:4. Scarcely anything is said of
[2:26:34] the power of the keys. The church has
[2:26:36] almost lost, listen to it, has almost
[2:26:39] lost the power of binding. Only the
[2:26:42] power of loosing remains.
[2:26:44] in the earth loosing people being loosed
[2:26:47] one from the other. This the this
[2:26:49] fellowship from that fellowship and you
[2:26:52] barely get a handful of people together
[2:26:53] and someone else seen something else and
[2:26:55] someone else is seeing something
[2:26:58] different. I'll tell you one thing.
[2:27:02] Hear me good. There'll be no such thing
[2:27:04] at the marriage table.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say something.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; At this last convention
[2:27:15] we just had
[2:27:17] in Switzerland,
[2:27:19] there was nine under 300 people there.
[2:27:24] Once I asked brother
[2:27:28] brother Vin I said in the small island
[2:27:31] of Trinidad I said how many works are
[2:27:33] there there? He says about 42.
[2:27:36] Oh my, so many churches and works in the
[2:27:40] small island of Trinidad.
[2:27:43] How how many kind of different angles of
[2:27:45] belief on the message? He said 42.
[2:27:54] In this gathering of people,
[2:27:57] there were people established pastors
[2:28:01] with works.
[2:28:03] And maybe they didn't fellowship real
[2:28:04] close, but they recognized and respected
[2:28:07] one another.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; And there was other ministers that came
[2:28:11] from Romania and one from Rome, right in
[2:28:15] the shadow of the Vatican. And they came
[2:28:18] from other parts of Italy and they came
[2:28:20] from Belgium, from Holland, from
[2:28:23] Germany. They came from France. All
[2:28:26] many, many countries. Ministers were
[2:28:29] there and all the people were there. And
[2:28:31] I can tell you, I happen to know there
[2:28:33] was just all kinds of different beliefs,
[2:28:38] but they without knowing, and I'm
[2:28:41] closing, they without knowing
[2:28:44] fulfilled
[2:28:45] that part that brother Brandham puts in
[2:28:48] the church ages. When they came to the
[2:28:51] doors,
[2:28:53] they walked through the doors and they
[2:28:55] left everything behind.
[2:28:59] And
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; they said, "We're in here
[2:29:02] to hear God's word.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; We're in here to fellowship.
[2:29:08] We're in here to be in unity."
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; And you can talk to any one of dozens of
[2:29:14] those people. I got a phone call this
[2:29:16] week. My wife said it also. Others that
[2:29:20] were here were over there.
[2:29:23] Soon as they walked in, it was like a
[2:29:25] cloud fell upon the people.
[2:29:29] Everyone became enveloped
[2:29:32] and people who didn't agree with the
[2:29:34] other one at all and even had beliefs
[2:29:36] and they had disputations of the past,
[2:29:38] they left it all.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; And ministers would stand up and look at
[2:29:43] the other minister rejoice and at the
[2:29:46] word they were hearing. Brother Ron
[2:29:48] Spencer was preaching. Didn't matter who
[2:29:50] was preaching. Brother Murphy preached,
[2:29:51] Brother Tom preached. And they just took
[2:29:53] up and they they stood they waved their
[2:29:56] hands and rejoiced in the word they were
[2:29:58] hearing. And it was it it was as though
[2:30:00] I woke up the other morning and I
[2:30:02] marveled. Still marveling at it. I woke
[2:30:04] up in the wee hours of the morning. I
[2:30:06] said that was so glorious. It was like
[2:30:08] the Holy Spirit
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; witnessed to my heart. That's going to
[2:30:12] be the same atmosphere at the marriage
[2:30:16] supper.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:23] You want to be there.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to experience.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm getting ready for
[2:30:34] right now.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me, please?
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Would you like to go and get ready?
[2:30:59] I'd like to have the musicians if you'd
[2:31:01] come please.
[2:31:12] Sweet Holy Spirit,
[2:31:16] sweet heavenly dove. Hallelujah.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will abide here with us.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; We need you, oh spirit of truth.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; We need you.
[2:31:31] Take away all this human
[2:31:36] abilities and human
[2:31:40] everything that we are humanly speaking.
[2:31:42] Lord, we just want to be spiritual
[2:31:45] sons and daughters of God. We have
[2:31:47] nothing to offer, oh God. We just give
[2:31:52] you ourselves.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; We just give you ourselves.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Sweet Holy Spirit.
[2:31:59] Sweet Holy Spirit,
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; sweet heavenly dove,
[2:32:05] come be with us. Lord, these people have
[2:32:09] been kind and they've listened a long
[2:32:12] time.
[2:32:14] the only service we have today. But
[2:32:16] we're here, Lord.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; We're wanting to express our thanks. I
[2:32:21] want to thank you, Lord, in the in the
[2:32:25] before this congregation of people.
[2:32:28] I'm more thankful all the time for this
[2:32:32] message that you've sent and how pure it
[2:32:35] is, oh God, and the things that I've not
[2:32:38] understood that you make it clearer as
[2:32:40] time goes on. Oh God, I do not do not
[2:32:45] comprehend this great eternal God that
[2:32:49] fills all time or space, but we reach
[2:32:52] out to you, Father, because we know
[2:32:54] you're the one that has created all
[2:32:56] things. You have given us life. That's
[2:32:59] why we're here. We are here, oh Lord, to
[2:33:03] to honor your name. I pray that you will
[2:33:06] bless the congregation of people and all
[2:33:08] who are streaming the service today.
[2:33:11] Bless them. I pray father with your
[2:33:14] presence and that will suffice for us in
[2:33:17] Jesus' name. Let the words that have
[2:33:19] been spoken now father go out and be
[2:33:24] lodged in the heart. I pray the holy
[2:33:26] spirit will bring it back to
[2:33:28] remembrance.
[2:33:30] And any lord whose hearts are not where
[2:33:34] they ought to be Lord I pray you'll move
[2:33:38] on them now.
[2:33:40] keep them and stir them. I pray that
[2:33:43] other mature
[2:33:45] and elder believers will pray for the
[2:33:49] one that might be struggling. And I
[2:33:50] would say to you, if you're in a if
[2:33:55] you're in the place of decision, if
[2:33:57] you're in the place at a junction in
[2:33:59] your life, whatever you do,
[2:34:03] Satan's way and his ways are filled with
[2:34:08] increased trouble and difficulty.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, give yourself
[2:34:13] unreservedly
[2:34:15] to God. Amen.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; You have people that will pray with you
[2:34:19] and for you.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; We're for you
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder if
[2:34:25] we could
[2:34:28] do we sing. Do we know that sweet Holy

[2:38:24] Amen. You may have your seats for a few
[2:38:26] moments. Okay.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tommy.
[2:38:48] Well, we have to find ourselves in the
[2:38:49] scripture, don't we?
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; This is a a wonderful, wonderful time,
[2:38:53] Thomas.
[2:38:55] Just had a couple of days away with my
[2:38:58] uh wife and the three grandsons.
[2:39:01] Maybe just to give you a little bit of
[2:39:02] background,
[2:39:04] this is an unusual little boy. He's
[2:39:07] always had a heart for the things of God
[2:39:10] from as a young age of six and a half.
[2:39:14] And we were just took them through the
[2:39:16] little museum in Victoria
[2:39:20] and you have to go up some flight of
[2:39:21] stairs to go to the museum
[2:39:24] and he saw the old typewriter sitting on
[2:39:26] a desk. He saw the the setting was older
[2:39:31] and he turns to his grandma and says,
[2:39:33] "Grandma, is this brother Bram study?"
[2:39:38] That's very unusual
[2:39:40] that a boy of six
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; would have something like that on his
[2:39:44] mind in an old museum.
[2:39:47] And this young man has desired, I
[2:39:49] believe it's just over a year to be
[2:39:52] baptized. God dealt with his heart very
[2:39:55] young.
[2:39:57] And Thomas as a grandpa was looking to
[2:40:01] the scripture.
[2:40:03] To me, this is a great event
[2:40:06] as it would be your own children, your
[2:40:08] own grandchildren.
[2:40:11] But there was a day that Abraham had to
[2:40:14] offer Isaac on an altar.
[2:40:18] Came to a place where he had to give his
[2:40:20] all what God had revealed to him on an
[2:40:24] altar. And I started thinking about
[2:40:26] that. And one day, many years ago, I had
[2:40:28] to come to a place.
[2:40:30] I had to lay everything on an altar.
[2:40:36] And because of that,
[2:40:38] there was a voice that came from heaven
[2:40:40] and said,"Abraham, stay your hand.
[2:40:43] I know thou lovest me."
[2:40:48] And because of Abraham willing to lay it
[2:40:50] down, a promise was given
[2:40:54] that Abraham, your seed shall possess
[2:40:56] the gates [snorts]
[2:40:58] of your enemy.
[2:41:01] And because I I looked at one day there
[2:41:03] was a surrendering young man at 21 her
[2:41:07] parents and everybody else wanted
[2:41:09] nothing to do with what I believed
[2:41:13] by God's grace possessed the seed this
[2:41:16] seed possessed the gate of his enemy.
[2:41:20] I married a wonderful wife,
[2:41:24] Sister Joanne.
[2:41:26] We were unable to have children.
[2:41:29] We were able to possess the gates of our
[2:41:31] enemy.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; And we have three sons, supernatural
[2:41:37] sons, each one.
[2:41:40] And these sons have now had children.
[2:41:44] Did not come without its struggles
[2:41:46] throughout their lives. And we can say,
[2:41:47] Thomas, that God that spoke to Abraham,
[2:41:51] spoke to grandpa, has spoke to your
[2:41:53] father.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart that
[2:41:56] same God has spoke to you.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; And that you will have the same promise,
[2:42:01] Thomas,
[2:42:03] that you shall also possess the gates of
[2:42:05] your enemy.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; And I can say as Abraham of old,
[2:42:10] this day this scriptures fulfilled in
[2:42:12] your ears. Amen.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; For it shall be unto your children and
[2:42:17] your children's children.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; As many as our Lord our God kept call.
[2:42:21] This is a great day. Thomas, you've
[2:42:23] waited a long time.
[2:42:25] You believe Jesus Christ is your savior.
[2:42:28] You would like to say something.
[2:42:30] Okay, you say something.
[2:42:37] Do you love the Lord Jesus?
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:42:42] I take that as an amen.
[2:42:44] Let's just bow our heads in the word of
[2:42:46] prayer.
[2:42:51] Father, this young boy
[2:42:56] has had his heart turned to heaven at a
[2:42:58] young age.
[2:43:00] Has desired the things of God for many
[2:43:03] months, Lord. You've come into his
[2:43:06] heart. He's asked you. He has repented.
[2:43:10] And he desires, Lord, to live a life
[2:43:12] worthy of the gospel. He desires to be
[2:43:15] filled with God. He desires that the
[2:43:17] Holy Ghost would reign within him.
[2:43:20] And Father God, we ask that you will
[2:43:23] fill his heart.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Fill his soul.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Let there be a fire burn within his own
[2:43:30] bones, Lord.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; God, that he would be always ready to to
[2:43:35] give account of the gospel.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to proclaim that Jesus Christ
[2:43:39] is has risen and he's alive and he's
[2:43:41] well and he's living in me to tell.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Would you bless Thomas?
[2:43:48] Would you ever guide him and lead him?
[2:43:51] Keep your hand upon him now and fill
[2:43:54] him. We pray Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:43:59] and Thomas,
[2:44:01] by your confession
[2:44:04] that Jesus Christ is your savior, I
[2:44:07] baptize you in true Christian baptism in
[2:44:11] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:20] [applause]
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; What can we do? The children will teach
[2:44:44] us.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Oed. So nice to
[2:44:48] have brother Oed Deoka has just come
[2:44:51] down from Edmonton. [music] If you'll
[2:44:53] come and dismiss us in prayer, brother
[2:44:55] Oed, that's the only service today. Next
[2:44:58] week we start with two services and then
