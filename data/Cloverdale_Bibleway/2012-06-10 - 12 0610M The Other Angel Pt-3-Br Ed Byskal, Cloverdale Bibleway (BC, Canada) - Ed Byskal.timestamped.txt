[18:58] David. I'm so looking forward to the
[19:01] message this morning. Amen. If there's
[19:04] something on your heart that you just

[19:59] There is a mountain
[20:02] [Music]
[20:04] or man
[20:06] in the house
[20:09] of David.
[20:16] [Music]
[20:19] And there are streams.
[20:22] There are
[20:25] streams of grace that's flowing.
[20:29] down
[20:31] from Calary.
[20:37] [Music]
[20:44] &gt;&gt; And we're going to turn to our pastor as
[20:45] he's going to just open the service in a
[20:47] word of prayer. And we do want to
[20:49] remember the outreach meetings next
[20:51] Saturday in Seattle. And there will be a
[20:54] meeting in the chapel immediately after
[20:56] this service this morning for those who
[20:58] are interested and to go over the
[20:59] details. And let's remember those on the
[21:02] front lines, amen, who are going out
[21:04] sharing the message. And also one prayer
[21:07] request for a young man named Kell. Uh
[21:09] my brother Jeremy just phoned in a
[21:11] friend of his. He was in an accident
[21:14] um with some explosives and the doctors
[21:16] say he will most likely lose all use of
[21:18] his hand. And they just ask that we
[21:20] would remember him in prayer. most of
[21:21] all that God would use this work the
[21:23] supernatural and move on his heart. Show
[21:25] him that there's a God who's alive
[21:27] today. Amen. Amen. And brother Ed, why
[21:29] don't you come? Amen.
[21:34] God bless you.
[21:37] I want to take the uh prayer request
[21:39] this morning just before we turn to the
[21:42] word. Uh,
[21:45] brother Dave Jabbernoff was at work the
[21:48] other day and about two days ago and uh,
[21:53] his cell phone rang and it was his uh,
[21:57] younger brother and informing him that
[22:01] his younger brother had two younger
[22:02] brothers uh, died instantly on the job
[22:07] at his work at just 43 years old. had a
[22:11] massive heart attack and was gone in
[22:13] just an instant. the uh the
[22:18] not ironic thing, but the supernatural
[22:20] aspect of this is uh under a great deal
[22:25] of pressure and it was Marilyn put a lot
[22:27] of pressure on this brother and um
[22:31] brother Dave did also because this is
[22:34] the only family that Dave has had and uh
[22:38] they the parents I think are are are
[22:40] passed away on both sides of the family
[22:44] And so he wanted him. Marilyn said, "You
[22:47] must come out. You must come out for
[22:49] Dave's 50th birthday." And well, you
[22:53] know, they couldn't, you know, the
[22:55] expense of it all and the time and the
[22:57] way it is and so on. And they pressed
[22:59] him very, very hard. So they came and
[23:02] Dave was able to spend about 10 days.
[23:04] Now, Brother David has sat down with
[23:06] this family and given them his entire
[23:08] testimony. And they know what he was and
[23:11] they know what he is, but they don't
[23:12] know exactly what made him. they, you
[23:14] know, they just know some dramatic
[23:16] change, something happens and it's so
[23:19] dramatic and they can't understand it.
[23:22] But, uh, he wasn't sure whether they'd
[23:24] come to church, but the whole family
[23:26] came to church. And he loves the sons.
[23:27] There's two boys, one nine and 11.
[23:31] And, uh, the boys had just written and
[23:33] made Father's Day cards for their
[23:35] father. And, uh, the father's not there
[23:38] the very next day. In fact, it's that
[23:40] afternoon. He's not there. And uh uh so
[23:44] it really broke brother Dave up because
[23:47] he's he said that his brother was the
[23:49] only one that was married and had
[23:51] children and was kind of the hub of the
[23:53] family. I just like to say to the church
[23:55] this morning, there isn't a person here
[23:57] has any guarantee that we're going to
[23:59] walk out the doors. And that's the way
[24:01] we better live. That's the way we want
[24:03] to live. We want to live very very uh
[24:06] dedicated and very sincere and live so
[24:10] that we're ready to go at any time. So
[24:13] there Dave and Marilyn are there and the
[24:16] funeral is tomorrow. So I'd like the
[24:19] church to pray for them as well because
[24:22] I believe that during that service that
[24:24] they were here, I don't know who it was,
[24:26] whether it was one of the song leaders
[24:28] that began to sing a song and I said,
[24:30] "Well, Brother Dave, that's your song.
[24:32] you better come up here and sing it. And
[24:35] so Dave Tbernoff came up and sang that
[24:37] song. And it was, I think, one of the
[24:39] first songs he ever sang in the log
[24:42] church. Uh, and and here's his brother,
[24:45] but the song leader didn't know that his
[24:46] brother and his entire family, his
[24:48] brother's wife and two children were
[24:50] here, and they just uh, you know, the
[24:52] children just loved Dave. And he was
[24:54] teaching them to pray at the at the at
[24:57] the breakfast table, and they would
[24:59] pray. And so let us pray
[25:03] &gt;&gt; to a God that hears prayer
[25:05] &gt;&gt; that God will achieve whatever it is he
[25:08] started and we know that he'll finish
[25:10] the work. So I just want to say to all
[25:13] of you that are here and young people
[25:16] alike and if you have your fathers and
[25:19] mothers here, your parents with you,
[25:21] it's something we want to be eternally
[25:23] grateful for.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have men and women that know
[25:27] God and are here with their families, I
[25:30] say God bless you. Uh because we won't
[25:35] have this opportunity just like this in
[25:37] the next life. This life is here as a
[25:40] life of preparation. This is a life of
[25:43] of uh expressing Jesus Christ and doing
[25:46] our duty to the Lord. And so we want to
[25:49] take these requests to the Lord in
[25:50] prayer and uh all that have been
[25:53] mentioned and and what you have on your
[25:55] heart. Don't forget he's a god that
[25:58] hears.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; There's not a god of stone.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; He's not a god of wood.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; He even told the people, I'm He's not
[26:06] one of those gods. I'm a God with eyes.
[26:09] I'm a God with ears. I'm a God with a
[26:11] voice. We're thankful for that voice.
[26:14] We'll pray together. Heavenly Father, we
[26:17] are coming and approaching you, the
[26:19] Almighty one, in the blessed and
[26:22] gracious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:25] How thankful we are that you have given
[26:27] us another opportunity. You've extended
[26:30] your grace to us that we could gather
[26:32] here as the body of Jesus Christ. What a
[26:36] privilege. What a calling this is. What
[26:39] a glorious calling in the heavenly
[26:42] places with Christ Jesus. the conqueror.
[26:45] Lo, he is the mighty conqueror. And as
[26:48] we've heard the worship and the people
[26:50] singing today, Lord, we can we can join
[26:53] in and say, "All hail the name of Jesus.
[26:57] All hail the power of Jesus' name. Let
[27:01] angels prosper at fall." And Lord,
[27:03] within our own hearts, we bow before
[27:06] you, the almighty God. We pray that you
[27:10] will work and even deal more strongly,
[27:13] Lord, with those that you're talking to.
[27:17] Speak, oh God, in the name of Jesus
[27:20] Christ. Let the Holy Ghost speak. I
[27:23] pray, Father, for when you speak, it
[27:26] will be absolute truth. We pray, Father,
[27:29] that you will take your word this
[27:31] morning and bring it down to the level
[27:33] of the people.
[27:35] We pray father that your will will be
[27:37] accomplished. Come down amongst us in
[27:40] the name of Jesus Christ. Take every
[27:42] spirit under your control oh God. And
[27:45] whoever may be streaming I pray you will
[27:47] enter into the rooms wherever the places
[27:50] are father and that you will take
[27:52] control of the minds and bring them into
[27:54] subjection to the will of God. We're
[27:57] praying father for the requests that
[27:58] have been made this morning. each one of
[28:01] them and the hands that are raised, the
[28:02] hearts that are lifted up to you. Oh
[28:05] God, you've invited us that we should
[28:08] lay our burden down and bring our
[28:10] burdens and he carth for you. Father, we
[28:13] pray for brother Dave and sister Marilyn
[28:16] today that you will give them a special
[28:18] grace. Give them words that didn't come
[28:21] from their mind. I pray words that will
[28:23] be inspired by the Holy Spirit. Not only
[28:26] words of comfort, but words of life,
[28:28] words of eternal life, Lord, and bring
[28:31] to remembrance, I pray, those things
[28:33] that have been heard and those the
[28:36] atmosphere that the people were in. And
[28:38] today, Father, I pray for this service
[28:41] that it'll something will be achieved
[28:43] that will be of an eternal value, an
[28:45] eternal worth. Oh God, establish your
[28:48] people, destroy the works of the enemy.
[28:51] I pray you will bring them down, oh God,
[28:53] and lift your people on high. We thank
[28:56] you, Father. Pray your blessing upon
[28:58] Brother Tom also as he's ministering.
[29:01] Brother Jason Watkins ministering there
[29:03] in Arkansas. I ask that you'll conclude
[29:06] these services today with a mighty
[29:08] mighty outpouring of your presence in
[29:10] your spirit. And now, Father, we give
[29:13] ourselves to you
[29:16] unreservedly in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:20] Wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan.
[29:21] All that I have and all that I am, all
[29:24] that I ever will be. Please.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; All that I have
[29:32] and all that
[29:35] I am.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Have some prayer now.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; I shall
[29:43] be.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, it cannot
[29:54] love that I
[29:57] [Music]
[30:01] surrender
[30:04] to
[30:06] [Music]
[30:07] &gt;&gt; I'll invite you to take your Bibles and
[30:09] turn please to Matthew's Gospel the 24th
[30:12] chapter.
[30:29] going to commence reading at the 11th
[30:31] verse.
[30:36] And many false prophets shall ar shall
[30:39] rise and shall deceive many. And because
[30:43] iniquity shall abound, the love of many
[30:45] shall wax cold.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; But he that shall endure unto the end,
[30:50] the same shall be saved.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[30:55] preached in all the world for a witness
[30:58] unto all nations, and then shall the end
[31:01] come. Turn also down to verse 23.
[31:08] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo,
[31:10] here is Christ, or there, believe it
[31:12] not. For there shall arise false
[31:15] Christs, false anointed ones, and false
[31:19] prophets, and shall show great signs and
[31:22] wonders in so much that if it were
[31:25] possible, they shall deceive the very
[31:27] elect.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Behold, I have told you before,
[31:31] wherefore, if they shall say unto you,
[31:33] Behold, he is in the desert, go not
[31:35] forth. Behold, he's in the secret
[31:38] chambers. Believe it not. For as the
[31:41] lightning cometh out of the east, and
[31:43] shineth even unto the west, so shall
[31:47] also the son the coming of the son of
[31:49] man be. For wheresoever the carcass is,
[31:53] there will the eagles be gathered
[31:55] together, and the people could say,
[31:58] "Amen."
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[32:04] I will ask you to be especially
[32:06] attentive today.
[32:08] This is a bit of a study also while I'm
[32:12] preaching and it's fairly heavy subject.
[32:15] So if you would just really be
[32:17] spiritually minded and ask God to give
[32:19] you
[32:21] uh give you the mind of Christ and uh
[32:24] pray for yourself and pray also for me.
[32:27] I just am uh standing here just wanting
[32:31] to know exactly how far the Lord wants
[32:33] me to go. Uh the scripture which we have
[32:38] just read uh this scripture describes a
[32:41] time
[32:43] when I want to use a phrase that is not
[32:46] uncommon to you.
[32:48] a time when there's only a razor's edge
[32:52] between
[32:54] uh the truth and error.
[32:58] Only a razor's edge. It's not some big
[33:01] great wide gap. It's just a razor's
[33:03] edge. Says many false prophets. when
[33:08] people bring start bringing up you know
[33:10] uh they start talking about brother
[33:12] Brandham for example or we speak about
[33:14] brother Brandham and then they say well
[33:15] yeah but the scripture says false
[33:18] prophets will arise well no that isn't
[33:19] what it says it says many so I say if
[33:22] you and I've said it many times to
[33:24] people if you want to refer to brother
[33:26] Brandham as a false prophet please tell
[33:28] me all about all the others and tell me
[33:30] about the many that are deceived
[33:33] uh many shall uh arise and shall deceive
[33:38] many. So life in our time
[33:42] often feels as though we are living on
[33:47] the edge, does it not?
[33:49] &gt;&gt; I think most everybody here experiences
[33:52] that just feels that I'm just on the
[33:56] very edge. I just I don't know if I can
[34:00] take anymore. And then if we had to
[34:02] define that, we'd probably end up by say
[34:05] using the word pressure.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Well, it's some pressure. And well, your
[34:10] prophet told you it would be a time of
[34:12] pressure.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can't even hardly define
[34:15] the pressure. Just comes from so many
[34:18] different directions. And you say, well,
[34:20] there's just so much pressure. And that
[34:23] pressure brings a person right almost
[34:25] like to the edge. Well, you want to know
[34:27] where your roots are.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. when you come to a time like that.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; And so part of the service this morning
[34:33] is to determine where our roots are.
[34:35] Part of the service this morning is to
[34:37] expose Satan. That's why I asked you to
[34:40] pray. He does not like to be exposed. He
[34:44] hates the book of Revelation and he
[34:46] hates the book of Genesis because the
[34:47] one uh exposes where he came in and the
[34:50] other one exposes his end. But we also
[34:53] want to expose his trail all along the
[34:56] way.
[34:59] And so we're living in a time when
[35:01] there's a great deal of of pressure, but
[35:04] it's been prophesied
[35:06] that this age that these things would
[35:09] take place. So the many false anointed
[35:12] ones and shall deceive many, but that
[35:17] scripture says, "He that endures unto
[35:21] the end, the same shall be saved." So
[35:24] there's a knife just a knife's edge, a
[35:26] razor edge between the many and the he.
[35:31] And if you were to read it, you could
[35:33] underline those or uh highlight them as
[35:36] I do. The the many false prophets and
[35:40] many shall be deceived, but he that
[35:43] shall endure. And the prophet says few,
[35:46] &gt;&gt; very, very few. And if you're here today
[35:50] feeling that I'm one of the few, you
[35:52] want to rejoice over that.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; You want to say, "Thank God for grace
[35:57] that's been extended to me." And then
[36:00] someone might say, "Well, how do I know
[36:02] I'm one of the few?" Well, you better
[36:04] believe you're one of the few because
[36:06] there's no other way.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; No other way.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; How do we endure?
[36:14] I'm going to be following my studies
[36:16] very close. because I felt so directed.
[36:21] How do we endure?
[36:24] Well,
[36:26] you want to know how do I endure?
[36:31] Number one and first and foremost, you
[36:34] better know how to use the word.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; And when I say the word, I don't mean
[36:39] just quoting a scripture as such. And
[36:43] neither do I mean knowing the message or
[36:46] knowing a quote or knowing where to go
[36:48] so much. But you must know the
[36:51] fundamentals. And the fundamentals even
[36:54] when even when Peter made that
[36:56] statement, thou art the Christir, the
[36:59] son of the living God, even after that
[37:02] he he denied him and all of those
[37:05] things, but he had a fundamental in
[37:07] place. This is the Christ.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; This is the son of God. Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; We have to have a fundamental in place.
[37:15] This is the message, the revealing of
[37:18] Jesus Christ. I maybe don't know a whole
[37:21] lot of other things, but we have the
[37:23] simplicity down to believe that is the
[37:26] word of God. And the fundamental is this
[37:30] message came to reveal Jesus Christ in
[37:34] the scripture. And then if you don't if
[37:37] you don't know the fundamentals and have
[37:40] that in place firmly in place brother
[37:43] Brandham I'll come to a quote later on
[37:45] says well it gets real thin you can fall
[37:48] to one side or the other.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So it is a person can make too much of
[37:54] perhaps uh of an issue or too much of a
[37:58] person. You can make you can make too
[38:01] much of the preacher. You can make too
[38:03] much of the prophet. You can make too
[38:05] much of almost everything except the
[38:07] Lord Jesus Christ. You can't make too
[38:09] much of him, but you can make too little
[38:11] of him. And the thing that I see, if you
[38:15] read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[38:17] you'll find that the greatest error the
[38:20] people made was making too little
[38:24] &gt;&gt; of the vessel.
[38:26] They were making too little of Christ,
[38:29] Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was the
[38:32] personification
[38:34] of the image of the invisible God.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And still they made too little of it and
[38:39] they made too little of each other.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; They were at war with I won't say at
[38:44] war, but you know, they would argue and
[38:45] debate and who's going to be the
[38:47] greatest and they got into those kind of
[38:49] things. Well, I don't want to take so
[38:50] much time on that,
[38:53] but the prophet said that false Christs,
[38:55] this in Revelation chapter 2, false
[38:58] Christ would rise in the last days and
[39:01] would deceive the very elect if it was
[39:03] possible. So, there's a razor's edge
[39:07] between those that are deceived and the
[39:09] elect.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; It would deceive the very elect if it
[39:15] were possible.
[39:17] So there's and this speaks of the end
[39:20] time. It definitely speaks of the end
[39:23] time if it were possible. But he goes on
[39:25] to say, "But it's not possible." No sir,
[39:29] the elect was fore orained so they will
[39:33] not be deceived.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So deception can be and is so close. And
[39:39] I can tell you with full assurance, it
[39:42] is it is closer today than it's ever
[39:45] been. If there ever was a razor edge
[39:48] between truth and error, it's today
[39:51] &gt;&gt; to the time when you need to you need to
[39:54] know your position in Christ, you need
[39:57] to know that you have the Holy Spirit.
[39:59] And if you haven't, you say, "Oh, spirit
[40:01] of God, come and direct my life. Come
[40:05] and permeate my body. Come and possess
[40:09] my mind."
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. come and give me a hunger
[40:14] for your word more than I've ever had.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. I haven't seen
[40:19] anybody I haven't gone in contact with
[40:21] anybody that really dwelt in the
[40:24] message, the tapes and the and and and
[40:26] and consumed the books. I haven't I
[40:29] haven't found anybody of that nature
[40:32] that would uh that was so susceptible to
[40:35] go off track. But those that don't know
[40:38] I I don't know. I don't know what he
[40:40] said. I don't know. Well, if you're here
[40:42] and and probably you are, then you want
[40:44] to be concerned about yourself and set
[40:47] yourself a different diet. Habits are
[40:50] hard to break.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; If you have a habit of taking and
[40:54] hearing the word, then then you will
[40:57] continue that I'm quite sure. But if you
[41:00] do not have a habit, and most people do
[41:03] not have a habit, you have a habit of
[41:05] getting up and having breakfast. We
[41:07] should have a habit of of feeding daily
[41:10] upon the word of God and upon the
[41:13] message that reveals the word of God.
[41:15] Because I assure you, you can read much
[41:17] of the scripture and you don't know what
[41:19] that scripture means. But as you give
[41:22] yourself to the message, you will
[41:24] certainly you may not find out all that
[41:26] the scripture means, but you will
[41:28] certainly find out a whole lot more than
[41:31] you know. Now, would Will this
[41:33] congregation agree to that?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; That's been your experience. And so I
[41:37] would urge you to give yourself a diet
[41:41] &gt;&gt; of this of the message because the
[41:43] message was sent to deal with this age
[41:48] &gt;&gt; and tell you how to respond to
[41:50] situations that you have faced, are
[41:54] facing, or will face.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; The answer is there
[41:58] &gt;&gt; because it's Christ revealed.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; If you ever believe me, believe this.
[42:06] Believe me this time.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Make it a diet for yourself.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Make it a diet. When should I change?
[42:14] Start tomorrow.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Start tomorrow. Say, I'm going to give
[42:18] some quality time. You may not have time
[42:21] till I hear an hour and a half message.
[42:23] But if you hear 20 minutes of good
[42:26] quality time,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; it will do you nothing but good.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; It will give you direction. Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; It'll give you a cleansing.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself things that were
[42:38] troubling you and bothering you. When
[42:40] you started listening, when you're done,
[42:42] it'll be gone.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; In Satan's Eden,
[42:52] he is using every possible avenue.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Every possible avenue to advance his
[42:59] ultimate goal. And that ultimate goal is
[43:02] to get people to doubt God
[43:05] &gt;&gt; and to deny the truth.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; To doubt God and deny the truth. That is
[43:12] what his purpose is. Don't forget that.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; To doubt God and deny the truth.
[43:21] Although the elect
[43:23] cannot be deceived,
[43:26] Satan will continue his onslaught
[43:29] against the bride of Jesus Christ. And I
[43:32] think that we heard some of that when
[43:34] brother Murphy preached here uh the
[43:37] other night.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; He will still continue. And I call it an
[43:42] onslaught because
[43:46] he just refuses to give up. I won't
[43:48] glorify him, but I consider him the most
[43:52] stupid creature. Even though the prophet
[43:54] said he's a slicker and he's smart, but
[43:57] in another way, he's utterly stupid
[44:00] because he hasn't grasped that he has
[44:02] lost the war.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; But he will still fight
[44:06] &gt;&gt; and he will fight you. And we are even
[44:09] more ignorant if we will listen to him.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Where does that put us?
[44:19] Friends, we're not here at a Sunday
[44:21] school picnic.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; We're not here playing church.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; We're here to speak the truth and to
[44:28] have it change our lives.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; To be affected by it.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Now, in the spoken words, the original
[44:37] seed,
[44:38] he said Jesus had warned us of such
[44:42] things at the end time.
[44:45] I want you to take seriously, more
[44:47] seriously than you ever have,
[44:50] what God sent to you in this age through
[44:55] this messenger's mouth.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And the reason why I do that is because
[45:01] you will be saved and and uh God will
[45:06] prevent you from being affected
[45:09] adversely
[45:10] if you know what the message speaks. It
[45:14] will be such a strength to you.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Such a pillar to you.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; You may have wondered why I've been
[45:23] putting a lot of emphasis on this and
[45:26] and perhaps you'll even know better
[45:29] after today, but such emphasis on people
[45:33] people even mistake it and think you put
[45:35] an emphasis on the messenger. Well, the
[45:37] messenger and the message are one.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Absolutely one. You can't separate the
[45:42] two. That's right.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; God God himself is the one who took uh
[45:47] brother Brandham and put him in the
[45:49] highest office in this generation.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And we honor the man. We honor the
[45:55] office
[45:56] &gt;&gt; that the man that God put the man in. We
[45:59] honor the office.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And and and soon as I hear anybody
[46:04] starting to try to uh you know pick at
[46:08] at the man, well, Brother Brandon made
[46:10] mistakes. Well, that's fine. Yeah,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; that's fine. He was human. But then the
[46:16] the next question that I have is why
[46:19] does this individual want to direct
[46:22] people's thoughts to that point?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Because I usually find that it goes from
[46:28] the man to the message
[46:30] &gt;&gt; and the question is not so much about
[46:32] the man. Did the man make did the man
[46:34] have a flaw? Oh, now now does the
[46:37] message have a flaw? And then it goes
[46:39] from the message and then finally it's
[46:41] the whole it's the whole uh movement
[46:44] that God sent at this time.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; So he said in Matthew 24 spirits very
[46:51] close alike. Alike
[46:55] very close alike. He said deceive the
[46:58] very elected if possible.
[47:00] How can you tell them? He said how can
[47:04] you tell them?
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Listen very closely. He says, "Give them
[47:08] the word test." Now, I know that's a
[47:10] phrase everybody knows. Give them the
[47:12] word test. Well, if you don't even know
[47:14] what the word is,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; if you don't even know what the
[47:17] fundamentals of the message is, how are
[47:19] you going to give them the word test?
[47:21] Even if you know the the basics, the
[47:24] functions, everything has a certain uh
[47:27] uh you know, it has a certain principle
[47:30] to operate. Now, I step into my car as
[47:33] many of you will uh when we get done
[47:35] with the service today, we'll put our
[47:38] key in the ignition. Uh what's
[47:41] happening? I don't know what's
[47:42] happening. I just know it works.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; I I learned that it works.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; And I didn't even have to understand
[47:50] everything about it. All the wiring and
[47:52] where the where where everything goes. I
[47:54] just turn the key. I know the motor
[47:56] starts and I put it into gear and I know
[47:59] that the vehicle's going to move.
[48:02] Listen, you say, "Well, that is just
[48:04] utterly that's so simple. That's
[48:06] foolish." Well, that's how simple this
[48:08] is.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; You will never conquer the enemy without
[48:11] the word.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know how the word
[48:15] functions, how does it operate? How does
[48:17] it operate? Well, if you stay in the
[48:19] word, you will find out. Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; You don't have to memorize chapters and
[48:25] quotes and all of these things. That's
[48:27] not what I'm saying. But if you stay in
[48:29] the word, if you just stay in the word,
[48:32] give yourself time with the word, you
[48:35] will absorb
[48:37] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit,
[48:39] &gt;&gt; what you need because the Holy Ghost
[48:42] knows where you're going to be tomorrow.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; And he knows what you're going to face
[48:46] next week.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going to face on
[48:49] down the road. you that are parents that
[48:52] are having children raised up and and
[48:54] and whatever you have in the future, he
[48:57] knows what you're going to face. So, he
[48:59] will drop into your heart. He will drop
[49:02] down in it'll become a part of your
[49:04] whole being and you'll have a you'll
[49:06] have a perception that you didn't have
[49:09] before you were in that message. And
[49:11] that message may well open up as it has
[49:14] for myself and multitudes of you open up
[49:17] what the scripture says. And that
[49:20] becomes your not your just your daily
[49:22] food. It becomes the direction of your
[49:25] life.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; So he says give them the word test.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; How can you know it? Speak the word and
[49:36] see what they say about it. That's
[49:38] right.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; So you have somebody raise a question,
[49:42] raise a doubt about what you believe,
[49:45] give them the word test.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; You know, and see what they say about
[49:49] it.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; If they don't believe the word, they
[49:54] have no seed germ in them.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And they are of the evil one. And and
[49:59] and deceive you. As the first bride was
[50:02] deceived, then the second bride was
[50:04] deceived. They are deceivers of the
[50:07] third bride by hybriding the word or
[50:11] trying to.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; But he's but it's a compound truth. They
[50:19] continue to hybrid the word
[50:23] &gt;&gt; and thereby try to by hybriding they
[50:26] deceive the first. By hybriding they
[50:28] deceive the second. By hybriding they
[50:31] try to deceive. But then you find out by
[50:34] predestination and the ordination of
[50:37] almighty God that bride cannot thus say
[50:41] the Lord be deceived.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a brother in the
[50:48] army.
[50:50] He said they called him rookie
[50:53] and he said he felt so sorry for him
[50:55] because he was just a little we guy. And
[50:58] they threw this pack on him
[51:01] and he said all kinds of hand grenades
[51:05] and armfuls of bullets and a gun. He
[51:09] says about 90 lbs. He says that's about
[51:12] all he weighed. And he get this 90 lb
[51:15] pack on him and then tells him to run
[51:18] for five miles. He said it was just
[51:20] incredible. But he said and you know
[51:23] he's got all this equipment. He's got a
[51:25] little shovel and and so on and hanging
[51:28] on him. And they they they tell him,
[51:31] "You might need this sometime.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; You you learn how to carry it.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; This is your protection."
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And so he's talking on that line.
[51:42] And he says, "Get used to it because you
[51:44] might need it.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; You might need you might not need the
[51:48] word this afternoon, but you might need
[51:51] it tomorrow."
[51:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's so heavy. It's so
[51:54] it's such a weight. It just, you know,
[51:56] it it takes it takes I I could be doing
[51:59] other things or or uh uh I I could have
[52:03] so much enjoyment or free time or
[52:06] whatever your excuse is. That's not the
[52:09] point.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; The point is you better take the weight
[52:12] of the word.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; You better take and apply that word.
[52:16] Just stay in that word. I want to make
[52:18] that sentence clear. That word is not
[52:19] just reading the Bible. That word is not
[52:22] just reading the message, but it's
[52:24] giving yourself to it and absorbing it.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You read it as as you're
[52:30] standing right there and he's speaking
[52:32] to you alone.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And he said uh we always have to
[52:40] improve. And he said the old airplanes
[52:43] that we used uh back in the first world
[52:47] war, he says then the second world war.
[52:49] He says the ones that they just used in
[52:52] this last war now he says they're
[52:53] obsolete
[52:55] &gt;&gt; but uh but don't don't need them
[52:57] anymore. They've got jets. He says and
[53:00] we see you're always trying to improve
[53:03] to improve on the thing for defense.
[53:07] God doesn't have to improve.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; God gave his children his soldiers the
[53:13] very best
[53:15] &gt;&gt; the very best thing that could be given
[53:17] them. He gave them his word
[53:20] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And man was to fortify himself behind
[53:26] the word. And listen now, and no devil
[53:31] &gt;&gt; can get him.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Stay in the word.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Now I I'm I'm laying heavy emphasis.
[53:39] Stay on the principle of the word. The
[53:42] principles of the word. The basic
[53:44] principles. Say, "Well, what are the
[53:46] basic principles of the word?" Well, one
[53:48] thing for certain, God will honor his
[53:50] word.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're tested on that
[53:58] &gt;&gt; right to the very limit.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Because it doesn't seem that there's an
[54:01] answer,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't live to see the
[54:05] answer, God will answer his word.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] He says
[54:18] God doesn't have to improve. He gave his
[54:20] word in the garden. He says now the
[54:23] enemy spy
[54:25] Satan
[54:27] tried to find out what could he do to
[54:31] break into that. I want everybody's mind
[54:35] focused on this. Satan the spy.
[54:40] He tried to find out what he could do to
[54:42] break into this into this fortification.
[54:46] So he knew he just couldn't come out and
[54:50] bluff her Eve. So the only thing that he
[54:55] could do was to get her on reasoning.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; That's why I am opposed to reasoning.
[55:02] That's right.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; You cannot reason the word of God.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; It is what it is.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; It is what it means. It is.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And I I trust that you won't get weary
[55:14] with my message this morning. And that's
[55:17] what God uses today to fortify his
[55:20] church
[55:20] &gt;&gt; is his word.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And Satan comes around with reasoning
[55:25] power. Satan knew that that was a
[55:28] loophole
[55:30] &gt;&gt; and that was a place the people would
[55:33] break the easiest.
[55:35] Was that reasoning?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Reasoning is to ask a question and maybe
[55:40] the question is irrelevant.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; But it's a question comes into your
[55:44] mind. Well, what about this? And will
[55:46] God do that? And what is God's will? And
[55:49] and uh is is this Satan or is this God
[55:52] and all these things? Well, one thing
[55:54] for sure is one thing absolutely for
[55:57] sure is just have a a basic faith
[56:01] &gt;&gt; that this word has come from God.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; This creation did not happen by itself.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; This is not the result of a big
[56:10] explosion in space.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; This messenger that came,
[56:16] this prophet that came
[56:19] uh was not sent by a seminary.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; He was not sent by Christian
[56:26] psychologists.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; He was not sent with a lot of learning.
[56:32] And what I want to say to you
[56:35] unequivocally
[56:37] is whenever you hear a question about
[56:40] him, all you need to do is go almost to
[56:43] any message go as I have this last week
[56:46] several times, go to the very end of the
[56:49] message and have this messenger
[56:52] revealing the secrets of the hearts of
[56:54] the people and then say to yourself, who
[56:57] is that?
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm asking you today, who is that?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; William Brandon from Jeffersonville. No,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; that's the other angel.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; That's got to be another one.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows those things.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Who knows the past,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; who knows the present, and who knows the
[57:18] future. It's Jesus Christ. The same
[57:21] yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And one thing is certain, he knows every
[57:26] single person here.
[57:29] every single person under the sound of
[57:31] my voice. He knows everyone and the and
[57:35] and the his people are the apple of his
[57:37] eye.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And he's caring more about you than you
[57:42] care about yourself.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; You think I have such weighty things. He
[57:48] knows all about those weighty things.
[57:50] And he cares more about you.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And you need to believe that.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; He carth for you. He said, "I'll never
[57:58] leave you. I'll never forsake you.
[58:01] Doesn't matter what situation you're in.
[58:03] I will never leave you."
[58:05] &gt;&gt; But we don't fully believe that.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; We don't believe it sufficiently.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; That's why we quite try to sort out our
[58:14] own things and make our own way.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; So he said, "We're always trying to
[58:22] improve."
[58:24] And this spy is trying to use reasoning.
[58:28] He says, "And that's why God fortifies
[58:30] his church with his word." He said, "If
[58:33] God said that the baptism of the Holy
[58:36] Ghost is necessary,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care how heavy it is and how
[58:42] much of a how much of the world you have
[58:45] to give up.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care how heavy that statement
[58:49] is.
[58:50] He doesn't care how heavy. You must be
[58:52] filled and baptized with the Holy
[58:55] Spirit. Said he doesn't care how heavy
[58:57] that is. He said you're going to have to
[59:00] use it one of these days to stay alive.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's why they That's why a soldier's
[59:09] packing that shovel. He might pack it
[59:11] for days and weeks, but one day he's got
[59:13] to dig a foxhole
[59:15] &gt;&gt; when the bullets are flying and get
[59:17] himself some protection. And I can
[59:20] assure you, he's happy he packed that
[59:22] shovel then.
[59:24] Yes,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; sir.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; One of these days you're going to have
[59:32] to use it to stay alive. He said it's
[59:34] the only way of survival. It's the only
[59:37] way of survival. You ought to be saying
[59:40] that it's the only way of survival
[59:43] [Music]
[59:45] &gt;&gt; to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; We better get used to using the word
[59:55] against Satan. It's the only weapon that
[59:57] Jesus used.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a day that we needed,
[1:00:02] it is today.
[1:00:09] I'd like you to remember now these are
[1:00:12] these are common phrases but I'm I'm
[1:00:15] structuring this message and moving
[1:00:17] forward
[1:00:20] to some specific points.
[1:00:23] I want you to remember
[1:00:26] that it is the word
[1:00:29] it is the word that is a discerner of
[1:00:31] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[1:00:34] The reason I say that is because
[1:00:37] perhaps very few here
[1:00:40] may go to a message and I do it
[1:00:43] frequently.
[1:00:45] I go right to the end of the message. If
[1:00:48] brother Brandham has said something very
[1:00:50] significant there
[1:00:53] and I and and sometimes I'm listening to
[1:00:55] a tape and I can just feel the same
[1:00:58] spirit that the people when they were
[1:01:00] listening to Jesus. You can cut the air
[1:01:03] with a knife.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; It is just so resistant.
[1:01:08] They're so resistant. You can feel the
[1:01:11] resist. How many
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; How many here share that with me?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You can feel it. And then I go to the
[1:01:17] very end of the message. And I say, I
[1:01:20] just wonder what God did
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; to try to confound and to turn these
[1:01:25] people around. And then I find then he
[1:01:29] there it is there and he calling the
[1:01:31] people and calling by name and going
[1:01:32] from this and sometimes work right
[1:01:34] across the whole audience just go from
[1:01:36] there and up into the balcony and put
[1:01:38] one there, one there, one there. What's
[1:01:40] God doing?
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; It's an added measure of grace.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; He's saying to the people, "Wake up
[1:01:47] people. This is the sign of the
[1:01:50] resurrection. This is the sign of the
[1:01:52] Messiah. And I'm displaying it openly
[1:01:55] before you
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; think, oh, this is some nice gift. It's
[1:02:01] not a gift.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; That's the word. And so if you conclude
[1:02:07] in your mind, this is one of the
[1:02:09] principles. It's the word that's the
[1:02:11] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:02:13] intents of your heart.
[1:02:15] I'm looking at people here now
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; that sat in a service here not very long
[1:02:20] ago and uh
[1:02:23] and the word was so discerning.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; I thank God we didn't know it or the
[1:02:27] preacher doesn't know it. I'm sure that
[1:02:29] those that have been called to the
[1:02:31] ministry and I I have it quite
[1:02:33] frequently and people will meet me and
[1:02:35] say you it sounded to us like you were
[1:02:39] around our table last night. This is
[1:02:41] very I've had people say to me just
[1:02:44] recently, you covered everything point
[1:02:46] by point through your service. Who's
[1:02:49] doing that? It's the word.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's not a man.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Biscll. It's not
[1:02:55] brother John or brother Tom or anyone
[1:02:57] else. It's not the special speaker. It
[1:03:00] was the same God.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's why William Brandham stood there
[1:03:05] said, "I don't know what I said. I'd
[1:03:07] have to go back and play it back because
[1:03:10] it just went through his mind. It didn't
[1:03:12] even go through his mind. Just bypassed,
[1:03:14] went through his mouth, but it went to
[1:03:16] your heart.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And you may be sitting here this morning
[1:03:19] saying, "Dad is pricking my heart."
[1:03:22] That's not a man. That's God that dealt
[1:03:25] with me all through the maybe the last
[1:03:27] two, three weeks, and it's God that's
[1:03:30] seeking to speak to you.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And if you're turning anybody down, it's
[1:03:34] him you turn down.
[1:03:36] That's right.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; So that's why I refer to
[1:03:44] those times
[1:03:48] which is in Hebrews.
[1:03:52] The word of God is quick and powerful,
[1:03:54] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:03:57] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:04:00] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[1:04:02] marrow. And as a discerner of the
[1:04:04] thoughts and intents of the heart, it's
[1:04:07] not just discernment. And Pentecost made
[1:04:10] their huge mistake by attributing to a
[1:04:14] gift of discernment. And the prophet of
[1:04:16] God said it continually, but they
[1:04:19] couldn't hear him. Somehow the eyes and
[1:04:22] were blinded and the ears were dull
[1:04:25] couldn't hear them. The word is a
[1:04:27] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:04:29] intents of the heart. It's the word that
[1:04:31] was proceeding out of the out of the
[1:04:34] mouth.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; So when anyone speaks
[1:04:40] to diminish or lower the prophet's
[1:04:43] office,
[1:04:46] then beware of who is speaking.
[1:04:49] Yes.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Just beware of who is speaking.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; The reason why Satan tries to erode
[1:05:01] or belittle
[1:05:03] the importance of the prophet's life
[1:05:06] is because he is trying to get you to
[1:05:09] doubt the word.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; He's not trying to get you to doubt his
[1:05:13] life. Yes, sir.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to doubt the word sir
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; that came out. That's right.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I ran into this. I just
[1:05:24] ran into, you know, like little uh
[1:05:29] oh, just little indications. Little
[1:05:32] indications that well, it's not it's not
[1:05:35] so much the messenger and uh you know,
[1:05:38] and the messenger wasn't so important.
[1:05:41] It's the word that's important. Well,
[1:05:43] we've had the word for centuries.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. People say, "Well,
[1:05:48] it's a Bible, and I've heard this, check
[1:05:51] it out with the Bible." What kind of
[1:05:53] brain have you got to check it out?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We had the Bible before the message
[1:05:58] came.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking to unbelievers. I'm
[1:06:02] speaking to believers.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; We had the Bible. Luther had the Bible.
[1:06:07] He drank beer and smoked and hated the
[1:06:09] Jews
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; with the Bible.
[1:06:13] The Luther Bible doesn't have uh 1 John
[1:06:17] 5 and7. That's one of the main
[1:06:19] scriptures we have to change in this uh
[1:06:21] in this Chinese Bible. We have to change
[1:06:23] it because it's not there. In the
[1:06:26] Norwegian Bible, it's not there. Swedish
[1:06:28] Bible, Finnish, and I think in certain
[1:06:30] countries in in Europe, they don't have
[1:06:33] that. First John 5 and 7. And these
[1:06:36] three are one. There's three in heaven.
[1:06:39] I think the Father, the Spirit, and the
[1:06:41] Word. And these three are one. That
[1:06:43] scripture is not there.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet makes a makes a issue
[1:06:50] not a issue but he makes it very
[1:06:52] prominent. This is important.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; It's not there.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; So it makes a real problem for
[1:06:57] translators. Then people say well well
[1:07:00] you know brother Brandham made mistakes.
[1:07:02] Don't worry about his mistakes.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Think about your own mistakes. Think
[1:07:07] about the mistakes that have been down
[1:07:08] through the church world. How in the
[1:07:11] world you talk about, you talk about
[1:07:13] Pentecost today having rock bands on
[1:07:16] their platform and all. What about that
[1:07:18] for a mistake?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; What about all the carries on of the
[1:07:22] world? That's it just infiltrated the
[1:07:26] church. Don't worry about picking a hole
[1:07:28] in the message.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; It can be at our level of understanding.
[1:07:36] There's a good chance we don't
[1:07:38] understand really everything that was
[1:07:40] said.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Then we have to look at what is the
[1:07:52] intent
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; in the message adoption.
[1:08:00] Now, if you feel it's kind of coming on,
[1:08:03] it's
[1:08:05] I'm setting you up a wee bit.
[1:08:11] In adoption, he says sin is not a
[1:08:14] creation.
[1:08:16] No sir, sin is a perversion.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; There's only one creator, that's God.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Sin is righteousness perverted.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; What is an adultery? righteousness
[1:08:29] perverted.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; What is a lie? The truth misrepresented.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; The intent
[1:08:38] of misrepresentation. Are you listening
[1:08:40] now?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; The intent of misrepresentation.
[1:08:44] If I'm going to misrepresent something,
[1:08:48] misrepresent.
[1:08:50] I'm not representing it. I'm
[1:08:52] misrepresenting it.
[1:08:54] So, it's not a true
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; representation.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You follow me? Yes,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; I want to give it as a lesson. I don't
[1:09:02] want you to miss this. To misrepresent,
[1:09:05] brother Brandham says that every time a
[1:09:08] lie is a misrepresentation,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; so of the truth.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; So, a person can speak a portion of a
[1:09:19] truth which is
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; guile.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; It's guile. And guile is the same as a
[1:09:24] lie. Guile is a deceivers's tool. So
[1:09:28] they will speak a truth or speak a group
[1:09:32] of truths, but the intention of that
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; is to have you believe a lie
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; by the time you receive this
[1:09:42] representation because it's not a
[1:09:45] representation. It's a
[1:09:46] misrepresentation.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] Anybody
[1:09:56] is subject to that.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says say
[1:10:01] nice things
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; about one another
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; because when you say well say well some
[1:10:07] people I I'm just having such a trouble
[1:10:09] hard for me to think of anything nice to
[1:10:11] say. Well you better think about
[1:10:13] something nice to say and try and say a
[1:10:15] nice thing.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] to to misrepresent is to give a wrong
[1:10:25] impression
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; or to act unfaithfully on behalf of. So
[1:10:31] if I was saying I'm saying to you if I
[1:10:34] was appointed to represent something to
[1:10:37] you going to give a representation
[1:10:40] but I don't want you to see it in the
[1:10:42] light that this person who has asked me
[1:10:45] to represent it. So someone here has
[1:10:48] asked me to represent something to you.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to see it the way
[1:10:55] he sees it or the way he or she wants it
[1:10:58] to be seen. And so I go and journey and
[1:11:02] travel to the person I'm to carry the
[1:11:04] word to. But I represent I represent I
[1:11:08] represent it. All right? And I tell you
[1:11:10] what the thing is. I tell you what the
[1:11:12] project is, but I say, you know, this
[1:11:14] project's kind of shaky now. I'm
[1:11:16] misrepresenting it. This project has
[1:11:19] well you know
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; and you can even do it with a gesture.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Did you know you can do it with a
[1:11:27] gesture?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know that gestures are held up in
[1:11:30] court?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You make a certain gesture.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Maybe you never thought of that.
[1:11:38] I had a Jewish friend of mine. He says
[1:11:40] you can break you can break a man with
[1:11:43] your nose.
[1:11:45] Really? Yeah, you can break them. Cuz he
[1:11:47] was always into deals, making deals. So
[1:11:51] you say, "Well, uh, how much do you want
[1:11:53] for this? Do you know, well, you want a
[1:11:55] h 100,000 for it?"
[1:11:58] Doesn't say anything. Okay. Well, how
[1:12:00] about, you know, someone else has bid on
[1:12:02] it. Well, we want this very badly. You
[1:12:05] know, we'd like to we want to be
[1:12:06] successful on this. Uh,
[1:12:09] 100,000 won't do it. Well, how about 110
[1:12:15] 15
[1:12:18] 20? Okay.
[1:12:20] He broke broke the other guy.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Never said a word.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Never said a word.
[1:12:28] Never did anything fraudulent.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; But you ended up with something. And the
[1:12:34] and the other guy's deal was broke by
[1:12:36] this guy's nose.
[1:12:41] Hey, it works.
[1:12:44] Things are done by the millions of
[1:12:46] dollars based on that.
[1:12:49] What was that? It was a and that man is
[1:12:52] there and he misrepresents
[1:12:56] the person that he had been given trust
[1:12:59] to trust in.
[1:13:04] Now,
[1:13:08] uh, I just want to go quickly over over
[1:13:11] one little portion here. Are you all
[1:13:13] right yet?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Uh, I'm not disappointed at all. This is
[1:13:18] exactly the way I expected the service
[1:13:20] to go. So, I just want you listening
[1:13:22] real close.
[1:13:24] Uh, and the message trying to do God a
[1:13:26] service,
[1:13:29] brother Brandham said, was something
[1:13:30] like in the days of Micaiah. Now, if I
[1:13:32] had time, I would take you through that
[1:13:34] whole service because it's just
[1:13:35] incredible the the the way it
[1:13:39] progresses, but I'm just going to take
[1:13:41] this little part here. So, something
[1:13:43] like in the days of Micaiah, the son of
[1:13:45] Imla, Judah and Israel were separated
[1:13:48] into two different kingdoms. Ahab was
[1:13:51] king over one kingdom and Jehoshaphat
[1:13:53] was over the kingdom of Judah. So
[1:13:56] Jehoshaphat and a and Ahab were two
[1:13:59] kings and the enemies had taken uh the
[1:14:02] god-given land from Israel and Ahab
[1:14:06] called Jehoshaphat to join forces with
[1:14:08] him that they will take and reclaim it
[1:14:10] back and we'll go to we'll go to war and
[1:14:13] take it back and Jehoshaphat said that
[1:14:15] sounds like a good idea that sounds on
[1:14:18] the perfect will of God and Ahab said
[1:14:20] there's our enemies their children are
[1:14:22] eating our food our children's food. And
[1:14:25] Joseph said, "That's right. We need to
[1:14:28] take it back. We all believe in having
[1:14:31] our inheritance. We don't believe
[1:14:33] someone else should just have it, so we
[1:14:35] should have it back."
[1:14:37] And he said that the kings got
[1:14:38] themselves dressed up, you know, because
[1:14:41] uh uh Josat said, "Do you have do you
[1:14:44] have a prophet?" Well, we've got 400
[1:14:47] Hebrew prophets,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and they prophesied
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; and they were anointed. Yeah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And they prophesied and uh and Zedekiah,
[1:14:58] he was kind of the head amongst them,
[1:15:00] this Zedekiah. And he God made himself
[1:15:04] two horns and he came out before them
[1:15:07] before the kings. I mean, the kings are
[1:15:08] all dressed in their royalty. They're
[1:15:11] joining forces to go to war and get this
[1:15:13] land back. And he and he comes and he's
[1:15:16] prophesying and you want to believe he's
[1:15:18] inspired. He's and with these horns and
[1:15:20] he's giving an example. You will drive
[1:15:23] them out
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; and God will give you great victory with
[1:15:27] these horns. You'll drive them out. And
[1:15:32] brother Brandham said Jehoshaphat had
[1:15:34] just enough of God in him to ask, "Do do
[1:15:38] you have another prophet?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Do you have another one?"
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I don't like him.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; He always says nasty things about me and
[1:15:47] we don't like him.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Uh well, bring him anyway. So they go
[1:15:52] and to go to get uh Elijah
[1:15:56] and say, you know, come and prophesy or
[1:15:59] Micaiah rather, not Elijah, Micaiah.
[1:16:01] Say, now this is what the prophets have
[1:16:04] prophesied. Make sure you say the same
[1:16:06] thing cuz we're all in unity.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes unity isn't all that good.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "There's those
[1:16:14] out there say we're all one." Brother
[1:16:16] Brham screams out, "We're not one."
[1:16:18] That's right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff going on out
[1:16:22] there, even in the message. I don't want
[1:16:24] any part of it.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; So, he says, uh, you're going to drive
[1:16:33] them out. And he said, and brother
[1:16:35] Brandham says this, and here's where a
[1:16:37] part of my message is coming from.
[1:16:40] Watch how close it gets on that razor
[1:16:44] edge.
[1:16:46] Yes sir.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now what is the razor edge? The razor
[1:16:49] edge is that here's one king, here's
[1:16:52] another king. Uh the land has been taken
[1:16:55] by the enemy. Yes, it should come back
[1:16:58] to us. Yes, it belongs to our children.
[1:17:01] Yes, we should be growing our own food
[1:17:04] on it and our children should be eating
[1:17:06] off that. Yes, that's true. And do we
[1:17:08] have any prophets? Do we ever are they
[1:17:10] anointed? Absolutely. Anointed with the
[1:17:13] word of the hour. Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Get this land back.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It all sounds perfect, but that's the
[1:17:21] razor edge.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's the razor edge.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And Jehoshaphat was uniting with Ahab,
[1:17:29] which was one of the most wicked kings
[1:17:32] Israel ever had.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And he had no business. And so they got
[1:17:36] Micaiah there and say, "You say the same
[1:17:38] thing now that they said because we want
[1:17:41] to agree together."
[1:17:43] and he couldn't agree and he told him
[1:17:46] said when I come back I'm going to deal
[1:17:48] with you. He said if you even come back
[1:17:50] I haven't heard from God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; He knew where he stood.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to just now that now
[1:17:58] I've got down to the point of this
[1:17:59] razor's edge.
[1:18:02] I want to speak about the razor's edge.
[1:18:05] I I mentioned about the elect and those
[1:18:08] that endure to the end and those that
[1:18:12] the are many.
[1:18:14] Listen friends,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; let's not live in some kind of vacuum.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; The many include your friends,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; The many may include family.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; The many certainly include somebody you
[1:18:31] know. Right?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; The many include nice people.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And you got to have enough of the word
[1:18:40] of God in you to say, "As for me, in my
[1:18:43] house, I serve God."
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I challenge you young men.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; You serve God with everything that's in
[1:18:52] you.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You young married couples, serve God
[1:18:55] with everything that's in you. You
[1:18:57] families that have children, serve God
[1:18:59] with everything that's in you. and all
[1:19:02] singles, married, unmarried, serve God
[1:19:05] with everything that's in you.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I and my wife drove to church this
[1:19:09] morning. I sometimes think, I don't know
[1:19:11] what our neighbors think. We're out of
[1:19:13] the yard, into the yard, out of the
[1:19:15] yard, into the yard. They certainly know
[1:19:17] when church is on cuz we're gone. And we
[1:19:20] just drove out a block or two. And my
[1:19:22] wife says, "Just think, dear, we've been
[1:19:24] doing this all our lives." I said, "Yes,
[1:19:27] yes, we have. We've been doing this all
[1:19:30] of our lives.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; We were doing it before we were married.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; We were doing it as young teenagers.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Going to church, going to Sunday school,
[1:19:38] coming back, playing the guitar,
[1:19:41] sweeping the floor, playing the piano,
[1:19:44] singing if we could sing, shaking hands
[1:19:46] with people. What can we do? Whatever we
[1:19:48] can do. Well, I wasn't a minister. We
[1:19:50] were just doing what we could do
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; because this was our life.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And it's still our life.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; There's a razor's edge. Yes, sir.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; But between being deceived. Now,
[1:20:14] now I want you to listen very close.
[1:20:16] Don't be distracted.
[1:20:20] The word in the Hebrew
[1:20:24] that speaks of being deceived,
[1:20:26] it is to be spacious or to be open or to
[1:20:30] be open-minded.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; If you tend to be open-minded, well, we
[1:20:37] need to hear everybody and we need to
[1:20:39] understand. No, you really don't. You
[1:20:42] need to know where you stand. Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You don't need a whole general feeling
[1:20:47] of what where everybody is.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And it's not our business to know where
[1:20:51] everyone else is.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Your business is to know where you are.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And the fact that we've got telephones
[1:20:58] and social networking and everything
[1:21:00] else, that's a huge detriment.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what they are. That's what
[1:21:04] they do. That's what they got. Who cares
[1:21:06] what anybody else has? Who cares what
[1:21:08] they say? Who cares what else is in the
[1:21:11] message? How has this messenger
[1:21:13] ministered to you? How has this Holy
[1:21:16] Spirit spoke to you?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Do that
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; and you'll be happy.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:26] to be open-minded
[1:21:28] or to be naive and to be trusting and
[1:21:32] just to be so innocent
[1:21:34] and uh to or to be persuaded and that is
[1:21:38] in the Hebrew to be spacious to be
[1:21:41] open-minded to be trusting to be
[1:21:44] innocent kind of naive but in the Greek
[1:21:48] and Paul uses the scripture be not
[1:21:51] deceived
[1:21:52] and he says or to stray
[1:21:55] or to lead astray.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thing. When someone goes
[1:21:59] astray, they want to see if someone else
[1:22:01] will follow them. They want company.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Or to lead aside from the right way or
[1:22:10] to wander and roam about. And I found
[1:22:13] when people leave the very heart and
[1:22:15] core of the message,
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; they begin, you mark my word, they begin
[1:22:20] to wander.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; They begin to wander and drift. and they
[1:22:24] don't really have a spiritual focus.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And well, maybe it's over here. Well,
[1:22:30] maybe it's over there. Or maybe Well, I
[1:22:33] tell you what, it's actually right here.
[1:22:35] And what a messenger spoke about this.
[1:22:37] That's precisely where it is. And that's
[1:22:40] all you need. That's all I need. That's
[1:22:42] all this church needs for this entire
[1:22:45] journey that we have.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:53] To be deceived is to lead away from the
[1:22:57] truth or to lead into error.
[1:23:02] To deceive to be led into error and it
[1:23:07] and it also comes from a another
[1:23:10] uh word root word. It's a wandering, a
[1:23:14] straying about which the same as the
[1:23:15] Hebrew whereby one led astray from the
[1:23:19] right way roams hither and thither. It
[1:23:24] can even be a mental stray and to have a
[1:23:28] wrong opinion.
[1:23:31] And that's why I'm really afraid of
[1:23:32] these. Well, you know what I think.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not really trusting of people's
[1:23:38] opinions. I do want to know really what
[1:23:42] God has said.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:23:57] I gave you a slide last week. I'm going
[1:24:01] to try to watch my time here, but I gave
[1:24:03] you a slide last week
[1:24:07] and it was uh he said, "I I want you to
[1:24:11] know this is sure
[1:24:14] and you that listen to this tape that
[1:24:16] you might have thought today that I was
[1:24:18] trying to say that about myself,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; but that I was packing this message." He
[1:24:25] said, "Now every person listen,
[1:24:30] I have no more to do with it than
[1:24:32] nothing. No more than just a voice."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; So now he was a voice and my voice even
[1:24:40] against my better judgment. I wanted to
[1:24:42] be a trapper.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; But it's the will of my father that I
[1:24:47] declare to do and determine to do.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I wasn't.
[1:24:53] Now when I say when brother Brandham
[1:24:57] refers to himself as I wasn't I want you
[1:25:00] to say within your heart Revelation 10:7
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; and when he says but he then I want you
[1:25:08] to say Revelation 10:1
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; there's a razor's edge
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; between 107 and 101
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and you can fall off to one side or the
[1:25:18] other
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; but I'm determined to stay right on the
[1:25:21] edge
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; we're living on the edge
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and we can do it. And you want to say,
[1:25:27] you want to say to yourself, it would be
[1:25:29] good for you to say to yourself audibly,
[1:25:31] I can do it.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Let me hear you say that. I can do it.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I can live on the edge.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; God has given us the perception to live
[1:25:41] on the edge.
[1:25:43] God has given you the balance to live on
[1:25:46] the edge
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; to give it full regard.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; This prophet voice and the word that has
[1:25:54] come revealing Revelation 10:1 in the
[1:25:57] scripture
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; and it will be correct.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; It is your protection.
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:08] And when you run into things in the
[1:26:09] message that are weighty, remember the
[1:26:12] shovel and the hand grenades and the
[1:26:15] bullets are for your protection. You're
[1:26:17] going to need that verse someday.
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Take it and carry it.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; It's for your protection. Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I I know there's certain
[1:26:33] things, you know, maybe in my home or in
[1:26:35] my life that not are not quite in kind
[1:26:39] of a skew and a little bit out of that's
[1:26:42] fine. That's okay. Just keep listening.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Just keep confessing it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Just keep hearing it."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And that word, there's power.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, there's power.
[1:26:54] God has invested his power. Yes.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; In his word to do the transforming.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Roberto, I say you're listening
[1:27:04] very close. And God bless you. That was
[1:27:08] a wonderful
[1:27:10] testimony you gave me yesterday.
[1:27:12] Wonderful. And I sent it two or three
[1:27:15] places in the country across to the
[1:27:17] eastern United States up into the north.
[1:27:21] And one brother, brother, you mentioned
[1:27:23] brother Tim Dodd. and he he went
[1:27:25] immediately to the service that you
[1:27:27] spoke of and you said approximately 123
[1:27:30] minutes and he went there. I wasn't
[1:27:33] aware I haven't seen it yet but brother
[1:27:35] Roberto I'd love to have had you even
[1:27:37] hear his testimony. You're a very
[1:27:39] excellent writer, brother Roberto.
[1:27:42] Excellent writer. And uh and he he was
[1:27:45] sitting over here. He'd been to some
[1:27:48] services, but God struck his heart and
[1:27:52] something that was said and he dropped
[1:27:54] to his knees
[1:27:56] right here on a at a pew and he said, "I
[1:27:59] was born again."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; We've come to a lot of services, but he
[1:28:03] said, "I was born again."
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And a few services then he took he went
[1:28:08] on that basis and a few services later,
[1:28:11] I saw them while I was ministering.
[1:28:13] They're sitting right up in the balcony
[1:28:14] here and looking down and I didn't
[1:28:18] determine anything specific was
[1:28:20] happening but right after the service.
[1:28:23] Then I got an email from his wife and
[1:28:27] she said, "It is as though you were
[1:28:30] listening to our conversation.
[1:28:32] You spoke everything
[1:28:35] and I don't want to embarrass Sister
[1:28:37] Rosemary, but that was a wonderful
[1:28:39] testimony. You spoke everything." And
[1:28:42] she said, "My husband turned to me when
[1:28:45] you were done preaching and said,"Now,
[1:28:46] do you believe it?"
[1:28:51] And she said, "She was sitting there
[1:28:52] with feelings in her heart. My husband
[1:28:55] has spoke to brother Biscll
[1:28:59] and had never had a word of contact."
[1:29:02] the word.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And as better, the sooner we find out,
[1:29:07] the word's a discerner of the thoughts
[1:29:09] and the intents of our hearts that are
[1:29:12] here.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Still the same God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Different people, different
[1:29:18] names, but the same God, the same Jesus
[1:29:21] Christ
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And I want to be on good terms with him.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; When we cross the rivermen,
[1:29:31] sir.
[1:29:36] And then it was just I guess yesterday I
[1:29:39] don't know if it was brother Roberto but
[1:29:42] he felt so moved
[1:29:44] to speak to his son began to speak to
[1:29:47] him the Holy Ghost came down
[1:29:50] and the son
[1:29:53] gave his life to Christ.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Tell it's a wonderful thing. Now,
[1:29:58] brother Roberto, you just must keep them
[1:30:00] in that channel
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; against there against all the conflict
[1:30:05] of the enemy and whatever he may try to
[1:30:07] do. You just keep them in that channel.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me, folks?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people want to know if there's
[1:30:14] things happening, things happening when
[1:30:16] you don't even see it. Some of the
[1:30:18] greatest things happening
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; when we don't even see it.
[1:30:22] So the razor's edge between knowing the
[1:30:25] seventh angel and he said, "I wasn't the
[1:30:28] one that appeared down on the river."
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; He wasn't the one that appeared on the
[1:30:34] river. He said, "I was only standing
[1:30:35] there when he appeared."
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; We're not the ones that reach out and
[1:30:41] touch the hearts of individuals, but
[1:30:44] we're standing here when he's doing it.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He's still doing the same thing.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] He said, "I was only staying there when
[1:30:53] he appeared. I Revelation 10:7 was not
[1:30:57] the one that performs these things and
[1:31:00] foretells these things." 10:7 isn't the
[1:31:02] one that foretells these things. That
[1:31:05] that happens as perfect as they are. I'm
[1:31:07] only the one that's near when he 101
[1:31:10] does it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I was only a voice. 107 was a voice that
[1:31:20] he used to say it.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; It was It wasn't what I knew. It wasn't
[1:31:26] what 107 knew. It's what I just
[1:31:29] surrendered myself to and that he 101
[1:31:33] spoke through.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That's not just him, friends. You're
[1:31:39] spoke of by that messenger.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You are spoke of.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; You are spoke of. And he said this God,
[1:31:48] same God will be veiled in you.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And right away the devil says you you
[1:31:54] want to say back yes me.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's not what I said, not what you
[1:32:01] said. It's what God's word said.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Did he not say it?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I will be with you and in you even to
[1:32:10] the end of the consummation of the age.
[1:32:15] I am in you.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; You have a mind of Christ in you
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; greater than this mind here.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; If you realize when we're coming who's
[1:32:35] preaching this morning, God's in the
[1:32:38] midst of his people. Wouldn't make any
[1:32:40] difference who but if God has called
[1:32:43] someone to the word, he will take the
[1:32:45] word and and and develop that word
[1:32:48] within the heart of the person.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this,
[1:32:58] help me out now. I just have to close,
[1:33:00] but I can't close for a little bit. Is
[1:33:01] that all right, please?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're just getting into the meat of
[1:33:05] some things. In 2 Thessalonians uh 2:1
[1:33:08] and 3, Apostle Paul says, "Now we
[1:33:10] beseech you, brethren," notice, please
[1:33:12] how the scripture is laid out. "We
[1:33:14] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:33:17] the Lord Jesus and by our gathering unto
[1:33:22] him.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; This is the subject.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; This is the subject. I beseech you
[1:33:29] therefore people by the coming of the
[1:33:31] Lord and our gathering to him. This is
[1:33:35] the subject. And if there ever was a
[1:33:37] subject that pertains to our time, it's
[1:33:40] now. Now, I beseech you therefore people
[1:33:44] by the coming of the Lord and by our
[1:33:47] gathering to him. And he goes on to say
[1:33:50] that you be not shaken in your mind
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; or troubled.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Be not shaken in your mind
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; because that's going to come at a time
[1:34:03] when we're we are being gathered
[1:34:05] together to him
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; at the coming of the Lord.
[1:34:11] Be not shaken soon in mind or be
[1:34:14] troubled, neither by spirit,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; nor by word.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Not some human spirit come buzzing
[1:34:21] around you and and some or by word or by
[1:34:25] telephone or by internet or by social
[1:34:28] netting or any other way. Do not be
[1:34:30] troubled by that.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; You young people need to hear me good.
[1:34:37] Do not in the name of Jesus Christ be
[1:34:39] troubled by that.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm shaking in mind. I heard that
[1:34:43] this was happening. Put it away.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Shut the thing off.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that stuff.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that stuff.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Put it away.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Be not soon
[1:34:59] shaken in mind.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Or be troubled
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; by spirit,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; nor by word,
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; nor by letter, as from us, as that day
[1:35:09] of Christ is at hand.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means. For
[1:35:15] that day shall not come except there be
[1:35:19] a falling, and the falling is to forsake
[1:35:23] or a defection. In the military, there
[1:35:26] are some that defect. They said it gets
[1:35:29] too hot. There the the bullets are
[1:35:31] flying. It's us too heavy. Uh I I can't
[1:35:34] stand this bombardment and I'm going to
[1:35:37] defect. Just do not defect.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Do not forsake it.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; That's called a falling away.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I've heard the term
[1:35:56] too many times and I want to deal with
[1:35:58] it
[1:36:00] called church split.
[1:36:03] That is not what happened here.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; A good number left and a good number
[1:36:11] fellowship elsewhere. It was not a
[1:36:14] church split. I do exactly what I've
[1:36:17] done. I believe exactly what we have
[1:36:19] believed. The ministry here believes
[1:36:21] exactly what they've believed. Church
[1:36:23] split is not in the word of God.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; If people depart, they have their own
[1:36:30] reasons to depart and I just commit them
[1:36:32] to God. That's none of my business. It's
[1:36:35] between them and God. But I know one
[1:36:37] thing. I'm I'm just here exactly as we
[1:36:40] always have been. And we will continue
[1:36:42] with the original vision.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; We will continue with the original call.
[1:36:47] Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And I would say to you, do not use that
[1:36:51] term.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what is it?" It's a
[1:36:54] falling away
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; in some cases. And it may not, but I
[1:36:58] pray it's not. I won't discuss it any
[1:37:00] further. I leave people between them and
[1:37:02] God.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; It's the only time I've spoken like this
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; twice in two years.
[1:37:12] And I would be a I would be someone
[1:37:15] who'd be dumb if I did not speak
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; those things which I have known for a
[1:37:20] long time.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And have felt for a long time.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And so I want to listen to Apostle
[1:37:28] Paul's. Let no man deceive you by any
[1:37:30] means.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Not for that day shall not come except
[1:37:35] there come a falling away first.
[1:37:37] friends. Yes, sir.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe family,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; good people,
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; sincere people.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's all through the scripture.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; I said to my own beloved sister
[1:37:54] right here in my office.
[1:37:57] I said, I can find myself in the
[1:38:00] scripture.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; They left Moses.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; They left Samuel. Yeah,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; they left David.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; They left Jesus. They left Apostle Paul.
[1:38:11] They left brother Brham.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; I said,
[1:38:15] "Where are you in the scripture?"
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; We were standing at the door. This
[1:38:20] exactly before God. No exaggeration.
[1:38:24] She's short. She opened her mouth
[1:38:27] and nothing came out.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; I said, "Where are you in the scripture?
[1:38:35] Friends, if you can't find yourself in
[1:38:37] the scripture,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; you got to find yourself in the
[1:38:40] scripture. Yes, sir.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And the forsaking is actually the
[1:38:43] forsaking of your origin.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Where were you born again?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Where did God meet you?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; To forsake is of separation or of
[1:39:06] departing or fleeing
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; of separation. I want you to just hang
[1:39:11] right on your seat. Don't get any
[1:39:13] preconceived ideas here. Separation.
[1:39:16] This is exactly what the word is. If I
[1:39:18] if I never experienced these things, I'd
[1:39:19] have to read the same thing.
[1:39:22] To forsake is of separation of apart
[1:39:25] from the whole,
[1:39:28] of any kind of separation of one thing
[1:39:31] from another by which the union or
[1:39:34] fellowship of the two is destroyed
[1:39:38] or of the origin.
[1:39:44] Apostle Paul
[1:39:47] uh rather Apostle John in the revelation
[1:39:50] said I will put on I will put on you
[1:39:54] none other burden and he said the word
[1:39:58] for burden is weight or pressure and I
[1:40:01] believe that people come under weight
[1:40:02] and do come under pressure. We all do
[1:40:05] and the pressure of the dark age was
[1:40:07] either to bend or be broken to bow or
[1:40:10] die. It was the Inquisition, the power
[1:40:13] of the empire backing up satanic
[1:40:15] worship. Uh be organized or pay with
[1:40:18] your life. He said each age has had its
[1:40:20] pressure. Now he deals with our age.
[1:40:23] Each age has had its pressures. And for
[1:40:25] example, the great burden of the last
[1:40:27] age is the pressure of riches
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; and soft living
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and the nervous tensions in a complex
[1:40:35] age that we seem unfit to live in. Yes,
[1:40:39] sir.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; That describes us to the letter.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; It's a complex age that we seem nervous
[1:40:45] age that we seem unfit to live in.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I go for a little walk. I don't want to
[1:40:51] take up too much time of this, but we go
[1:40:53] out for a little walk and get some
[1:40:54] exercise. My wife says, and it's it's my
[1:40:57] wife who says it. She says, you know, a
[1:40:59] woman can wear anything.
[1:41:02] They're walking down the street in their
[1:41:03] leotards
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; down the public street
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; in leotards
[1:41:09] and nothing much. You know, some little
[1:41:11] jacket up here and a a sock for a a
[1:41:15] blouse or a top. It's absolute
[1:41:18] disgraceful.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; But you know what it is? I feel sorry
[1:41:22] for the people. Brother Bram said he
[1:41:24] feels sorry for the women. It's like
[1:41:25] they're caught in a net.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; They're caught in a net of fashion. I'll
[1:41:30] be glad when they take that demon of
[1:41:31] fashion, cast him into the lake of fire.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; There'll be no none of those people
[1:41:36] giving designing garments for the
[1:41:39] redeemed.
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; To heaven's land.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Just bear with me, please.
[1:41:57] There's a ra a razor's edge
[1:42:00] in this day of complex pressures
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; between those who give into it
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; and those who
[1:42:11] go on.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say everybody has ears and
[1:42:16] everybody's got eyes and you hear
[1:42:18] certain things and so on and so forth.
[1:42:21] Uh
[1:42:23] some time ago
[1:42:25] I became aware and I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:42:28] deal with a specific thing just now. I
[1:42:31] became aware that
[1:42:34] uh the website
[1:42:38] voice of the sign
[1:42:45] had uh
[1:42:47] had a big article
[1:42:50] on it concerning
[1:42:52] was brother Brandham's death foretold in
[1:42:55] 1964.
[1:42:57] How many have seen this?
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:01] How many have not seen it? Fine. I'm
[1:43:04] speaking to all of you
[1:43:06] and I don't want you to have to go up on
[1:43:08] that. It was posted on February 26. This
[1:43:12] is right in line with what I am
[1:43:15] speaking.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; So, the question is,
[1:43:22] and if you don't agree with some of the
[1:43:24] my comments, that's fine. This is our
[1:43:26] pulpit. This is the one that I've
[1:43:29] preached behind all the years of my time
[1:43:32] here.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; And I will take this liberty.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And I'll expect you to hear it as it's
[1:43:43] coming in the right spirit.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Was William Brandham's death foretold in
[1:43:49] 1964? All I can think of the first
[1:43:52] question in the Bible was, "Hath God
[1:43:55] said?"
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[1:43:57] right.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And soon as I hear a question, I want to
[1:44:00] be sure that it's a question either God
[1:44:03] is asking
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; or what is the intent
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; of the question?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Is the intent to establish and edify the
[1:44:14] body of Christ? Or is the intent to
[1:44:18] raise more questions
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; and to erode the faith sir
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; and confidence of people sir
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; in the word of God?
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:44:45] So here's the question.
[1:44:49] Was it foretold? And the question came
[1:44:53] to the website. So what I'm dealing with
[1:44:55] here now is the website and the person
[1:44:59] or the individual who commented on the
[1:45:02] on the uh experience on the events. So
[1:45:06] deals with two or three prophecies, two
[1:45:09] prophecies mainly. And did Kenneth Hagen
[1:45:13] and Anna Schrader predict William
[1:45:16] Brham's death in 1964?
[1:45:18] It's amazing they didn't say anything
[1:45:20] till 1990s.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; The prophecies that you refer to
[1:45:29] and now this is the one who's commenting
[1:45:32] on behalf of the website to the one who
[1:45:35] asked the question. And I don't know
[1:45:37] whether it was a legitimate question or
[1:45:39] whether it is all engineered.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Who wrote the question? There's no name.
[1:45:46] Who's answering it? There's no name.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here. You know who I am.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And this is absolutely public. And this
[1:45:55] is archived.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I don't have any confidence and I have
[1:45:59] no respect for anybody that's not that's
[1:46:02] afraid to put their name to it. Say,
[1:46:04] "This is me." Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; But because some have heard it and
[1:46:10] because of other things taking place at
[1:46:12] this time, you I would feel as though I
[1:46:16] was doing you an injustice.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Because part of my ministry, part of the
[1:46:21] servant of God is to warn the people.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; You don't warn them about something
[1:46:26] that's past. You warn them about
[1:46:28] something that they may face. And if you
[1:46:31] are faced with a question, then you know
[1:46:33] exactly where you stand. The prophecies,
[1:46:37] I want to stop right there. This is the
[1:46:39] one that's commenting, the individuals
[1:46:41] commenting to the question.
[1:46:44] How is he authorized? He or she, how are
[1:46:48] they authorized to call them prophecies
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; and sew a seed in your mind that they
[1:46:54] are prophecies? Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; All kinds of prophecies have been spoken
[1:46:59] today in churches and we don't need to
[1:47:01] hear it.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; We don't only have prophecies, we have a
[1:47:05] prophet.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; The prophecies that you refer to are
[1:47:12] contained in two books listed below. We
[1:47:15] purchased these books to ensure that our
[1:47:19] analysis whose analysis
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; of the prophecies prophecies who says
[1:47:26] they're prophecies
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; but they've already sewed seeds in your
[1:47:30] mind
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; and I want you and I say this with
[1:47:33] kindness I call them seeds of
[1:47:35] discrepancy
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; because it's misrepresentation
[1:47:39] you don't know that it's a prophecy
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; but they are suggesting to you and no
[1:47:45] uncertain terms that they are
[1:47:47] prophecies.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; That the prophecies would be as accurate
[1:47:53] and as factual as possible. Now the
[1:47:56] stage is set. We have purchased the
[1:47:58] books. We have read them and we have
[1:48:02] done an analysis. Who has done an
[1:48:04] analysis? I want the filter of the Holy
[1:48:07] Ghost to do analysis
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; and that the prophecies would be as
[1:48:13] accurate as possible and they are taken
[1:48:16] from the two books and one is my diary
[1:48:19] secrets by Mrs. Gordon Lindsay. Freda
[1:48:22] Lindseay was the wife of Gordon Lindseay
[1:48:25] who was the editor of the voice of
[1:48:27] healing and one of William Brham's early
[1:48:30] campaign managers.
[1:48:34] And in the in another second book was he
[1:48:37] gave gifts unto men a biblical
[1:48:41] perspective of apostles, prophets and
[1:48:44] pastors that is their own description of
[1:48:47] themselves.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Who says it's a biblical? I'm not being
[1:48:56] philosophical.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; I'm saying has God said
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; that what he wrote
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his his interpretation of the
[1:49:05] word. I do not know. I'm simply raising
[1:49:07] the question. Is this a biblical uh
[1:49:10] perspective of apostles and prophets? I
[1:49:13] don't think so because he rejected God's
[1:49:16] prophet.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And that book was printed in 1992. If
[1:49:25] this was a prophecy in 1964, why wasn't
[1:49:28] the prophecy given in 1964?
[1:49:33] Why wasn't it told to the people that
[1:49:35] were concerned? Why wasn't it spoken to
[1:49:37] the family? Listen friends, this got
[1:49:40] more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Kenneth Hagen was an influential
[1:49:48] American Pentecostal preacher who is
[1:49:50] often referred to as the father of the
[1:49:52] word of faith movement.
[1:49:55] Hagen was known to William Brham who
[1:49:58] said the following about him in 1955.
[1:50:02] And that is in the message uh glorified
[1:50:05] Jesus. And I read the entire quote about
[1:50:09] about what brother Brandham said about
[1:50:11] uh brother Hagen and he said that uh
[1:50:14] they were there having brother Brandham
[1:50:16] was there having meetings and he says
[1:50:18] that he just learned that another
[1:50:20] gentleman was over here having meetings
[1:50:22] and they would have joined with the
[1:50:24] meetings. they would have come to
[1:50:26] brother Brandham's meetings but that uh
[1:50:28] the meetings had their meetings had been
[1:50:31] scheduled for about a year they've been
[1:50:33] all staged and he used the word stage
[1:50:35] set for about a year and so they felt
[1:50:38] that they must go through that he says
[1:50:40] we love the brothers and we just pray
[1:50:42] God's you know that God will uh be with
[1:50:45] them and I don't know what else he said
[1:50:46] but I didn't feel to put the whole quote
[1:50:49] here uh just day for the purpose of
[1:50:51] today's service and to make it as short
[1:50:53] as possible
[1:50:55] The article begins with a question. Was
[1:50:58] William Brham's death foretold in 1964?
[1:51:02] This individual begins by calling them
[1:51:05] prophecies. As I made a comment, this is
[1:51:08] the language of the authors Gordon
[1:51:11] Lindseay from his wife's diaries and
[1:51:13] Kenneth Hagen. The objective of these
[1:51:17] prophecies so-called
[1:51:20] is solely to put forward the cause
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; the cause of William Brham's death. the
[1:51:28] the writer and the com whoever made the
[1:51:32] comments on v on on uh uh the the sign
[1:51:38] uh
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; thank you. Whoever made the comment
[1:51:44] there is spending the time discussing
[1:51:48] the prophecies. Well, this one said this
[1:51:51] and she did from her memory and this one
[1:51:53] was perhaps more accurate because it was
[1:51:55] from a written note. That that is isn't
[1:51:58] even the point. The point is what was
[1:52:02] the purpose of the prophecy and of and
[1:52:06] of the person who is putting this
[1:52:08] forward that these are prophecies and
[1:52:10] was his death was his death uh
[1:52:12] prophesied in 1964 and this one
[1:52:16] prophesied this and this one prophesied
[1:52:18] that this one had it written and Mrs.
[1:52:21] Lindsay took it from memory and it was
[1:52:23] it's in her diary. That's not the point.
[1:52:27] Why did the prophecies come and why were
[1:52:30] they included in the book? And I will
[1:52:32] just tell you and I will give you their
[1:52:34] own words. It was because brother
[1:52:36] Brandham supposedly was gone into error
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; and was doing great damage to the body
[1:52:43] of Christ. Is that so?
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; I'll have you know they're speaking
[1:52:49] about the most glorious thing ever
[1:52:50] happened to me. Amen.
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; I'll tell this congregation and all who
[1:52:57] ever hear this message archived or live,
[1:53:00] they were refusing the word who is
[1:53:02] Christ
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; who is the third pull of this ministry
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; and finding fault with him. And thus
[1:53:10] they had to discredit the messenger.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; And in discrediting the messenger, they
[1:53:18] did a serious injustice to Jesus Christ
[1:53:21] who was being revealed. And so what do
[1:53:24] we have? They refused him when the word
[1:53:27] came when he was here on earth
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; because he said things that they said
[1:53:33] it's unscriptural. Eat my flesh. Drink
[1:53:36] my blood. This is a He's a like a
[1:53:39] vampire.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; He wants us to eat his flesh and drink
[1:53:44] his blood. No revelation,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; no understanding.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And so they discredited him and forsook
[1:53:54] him.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:10] The prophecy stated that the leader,
[1:54:12] this is the first prophecy, the prophecy
[1:54:15] stated that the leader of the
[1:54:17] deliverance movement was soon to be
[1:54:19] taken in death because he was getting
[1:54:23] into error
[1:54:28] and the Lord was having to remove him
[1:54:31] from the scene for that reason.
[1:54:36] after brother Hagen left. This is
[1:54:38] brother Hagen had come to Gordon
[1:54:40] Lindsay's home and apparently had given
[1:54:42] him a piece of paper whatever more and
[1:54:44] this is from
[1:54:46] uh Freda's
[1:54:50] Lindsay's diary I believe he said and
[1:54:54] and after Hagen left I asked what do you
[1:54:58] think about this is this Brham there was
[1:55:01] a his wife that asked him Gordon
[1:55:04] answered gravely yes it is Brandham.
[1:55:10] He is getting into error. He thinks he's
[1:55:13] Elijah.
[1:55:15] He thinks he's the messenger of the
[1:55:17] covenant. I just want to stop there.
[1:55:20] What has this got to do with believe the
[1:55:22] sign?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; What has this got to do with believe the
[1:55:29] sign?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; And this has infiltrated
[1:55:34] the message realm.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I say it's blasphemous.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; It is seeds of discrepancy.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; And has no business in the company of
[1:55:47] the believers.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you I so hesitated even
[1:55:51] putting this on. I did not scheme this.
[1:55:55] These were just put on a slide this
[1:55:58] morning in the office while you people
[1:56:00] were singing because I had determined I
[1:56:03] would not show it to you. But I felt it
[1:56:06] left me with such heaviness and such
[1:56:08] sadness
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; that people who stood behind this pulpit
[1:56:13] sir
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; and perhaps fellowshipped in this
[1:56:16] company of people
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; would be responsible for this. And let
[1:56:20] me tell you something in warning that's
[1:56:22] not where it ends.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I have never seen I have never seen
[1:56:28] Satan infiltrate with with things that
[1:56:31] are error. The error is not there. The
[1:56:34] error was is thinking that I'm sorting
[1:56:37] out some prophecies. It's not that. It
[1:56:40] is why did the prophecies come? Why did
[1:56:43] these people speak these prophecies? Cuz
[1:56:45] that's what they believed in their
[1:56:46] heart.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And you have to decide if you wish to.
[1:56:51] Was he an error or was he not an error?
[1:56:53] I say he had thus sayeth the Lord. And
[1:56:56] and I got I got proof on that. I got
[1:56:59] proof on that. And there ought to be
[1:57:01] every hand raised in the air saying, "I
[1:57:04] believe what that messenger spoke."
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:57:17] Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; The sad thing is, this is Gordon
[1:57:22] Lindseay speaking, that unscrupulous men
[1:57:25] around him are putting words into his
[1:57:28] mouth and due to his limited background,
[1:57:31] he is taking them up.
[1:57:34] On Christmas Eve 1965,
[1:57:37] he departed this world even as the
[1:57:39] prophecy whose prophecy
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; when
[1:57:44] printed in 1990s.
[1:57:47] Is this something prophetic?
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; He departed this world even as the
[1:57:58] prophecy had stated a tremendous
[1:58:00] ministry that had veered off course. How
[1:58:04] do you like that one? We're following
[1:58:07] something that's veered off course. I
[1:58:09] say I was not on course
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; till I heard this message.
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:18] And this one is the prophecy as retold
[1:58:20] by Kenneth Hagen. He he retold it and
[1:58:24] said the following. In this prophecy,
[1:58:27] notice it's always prophecy. The Lord
[1:58:29] also said at the end of 19 he was with a
[1:58:32] group of people in a motel and rather in
[1:58:35] a restaurant. He says, "I've got to go.
[1:58:37] I've got to go and pray right now." So
[1:58:38] they all went and prayed and he
[1:58:40] prophesied for two hours apparently. And
[1:58:42] this prophecy says the Lord also said at
[1:58:45] the end of 1965, he who now stands in
[1:58:48] the forefront of the healing ministry,
[1:58:50] as a prophet, uh as a prophet will be
[1:58:54] taken out of the way. He'll make a false
[1:58:57] step and Satan shall destroy his life,
[1:59:00] but his spirit will be saved and his
[1:59:02] works will follow him. We need to pray
[1:59:04] for people that would put this up on
[1:59:06] believe the sign. Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; On December the 27th, 1965, my wife was
[1:59:11] at the beauty salon. Beauty parlor. Oh,
[1:59:19] was her hair being clipped?
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:24] And she called home to say that this
[1:59:26] minister was who was the leading prophet
[1:59:29] at the time had been in an automobile
[1:59:32] accident. he was unconscious and the
[1:59:34] doctor said he would not regain
[1:59:36] consciousness.
[1:59:38] I told her there's no use praying he'll
[1:59:41] be dead within 2 or 3 days. I said that
[1:59:43] because I remembered what the Lord had
[1:59:46] said in the prophecy. Then the Lord
[1:59:49] explained to me he had to permit him to
[1:59:52] be removed because of the damage he was
[1:59:54] doing causing to the body of Christ.
[1:59:58] Try to tell that to the folks in Congo.
[2:00:03] Try to tell that to the people in
[2:00:04] Africa.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Try to tell that to the people who've
[2:00:07] just come out of their utter confusion
[2:00:09] and darkness in China,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; in the United States, in Canada.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; You know what this does to me? It just
[2:00:17] shakes my roots down further.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; And I don't shake it. I just become more
[2:00:21] determined than ever.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:00:31] the question. Now,
[2:00:37] now here's the one who's commenting on
[2:00:41] behalf of believe the sign. There's no
[2:00:45] name. We don't know who's commenting.
[2:00:49] I have my thoughts, but they're starting
[2:00:53] with the question.
[2:01:12] All right.
[2:01:27] Now, now you'll have to just pay real
[2:01:29] strict attention because I got to read
[2:01:30] the rest to you. Is that all right?
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And then I'll close
[2:01:41] this. This person gives his assessment
[2:01:44] of the two accounts, Mrs. Lindsay's and
[2:01:47] Kenneth Hagens
[2:01:51] and then takes the scripture.
[2:01:56] Excuse me.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Who's taking the scripture?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Is this Is this a woman? Is it a man? Is
[2:02:03] it a man? Is he called to handle the
[2:02:05] scripture?
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Or is he one that's tampering with the
[2:02:10] word outside of his calling?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; What is he? Yeah.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Is he a carpenter, a plumber, a what is
[2:02:16] he?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; So he says there is a scriptural
[2:02:20] principle found in Deuteronomy 19:15,
[2:02:25] Matthew 18:16 and 2 Corinthians 3 and 13
[2:02:29] and1 that evidence established by two or
[2:02:33] two or more witnesses should be
[2:02:35] regarded.
[2:02:37] He's taking these prophecies back to the
[2:02:39] scripture that this is something that's
[2:02:41] established in the mouth of two or three
[2:02:43] witnesses.
[2:02:45] They're not witnesses.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying that? Not to discredit
[2:02:54] something, to warn you.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; That this is how close
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and there will be people who will read
[2:03:00] this and become destabilized.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; And that is leading astray.
[2:03:09] with intent.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; So now we're just discussing the
[2:03:13] prophecies. No, they're not discussing
[2:03:15] the prophecies. The intent is to lead
[2:03:18] people astray so that they lose
[2:03:20] confidence in the messenger.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And I say the whole thing is a
[2:03:25] falsehood.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; There's no one can prove to me that
[2:03:29] those are thus sayith the Lord
[2:03:30] prophecies
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and should be given any space in
[2:03:34] anybody's mind. And that's why I
[2:03:36] hesitated even to show it. You don't
[2:03:38] even need these seeds in your mind. But
[2:03:41] I want to show you there are seeds of
[2:03:43] discrepancy even today that are
[2:03:46] attacking the very heart of the message.
[2:03:48] And the prophet says it will be in the
[2:03:50] end time. Because Matthew 24 is a
[2:03:53] scripture of this time. Listen, young
[2:03:55] people, you won't only see this, you'll
[2:03:58] face other things in the future. You got
[2:04:00] to know one thing. What is my weapon?
[2:04:02] The word. The word is your only weapon.
[2:04:05] Let the word wash you. Let the word just
[2:04:08] absorb the word. Even when you don't
[2:04:11] know you're getting anything, absorb it.
[2:04:13] You need to hear it. This congregation
[2:04:15] needs to intensify their diet of the
[2:04:18] message.
[2:04:24] Yes sir.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; In the mouth of two or three witnesses
[2:04:27] should be regarded. Apart from the fact
[2:04:30] that the two prophecies are not
[2:04:32] identical,
[2:04:34] the combined testimonies of Kenneth
[2:04:37] Hagen. This is the answer from voice of
[2:04:40] God. I mean I'm sorry. Believe the sign.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; The two prophecies are not identical.
[2:04:46] The combined testimonies of Kenneth
[2:04:49] Hagen and Freda Lindsay point to the
[2:04:52] conclusion, listen to this, the
[2:04:54] conclusion that prior to William
[2:04:57] Brandham's death, a prophecy was made
[2:05:01] that he would die before 1965.
[2:05:06] Still giving it the credit of being a
[2:05:08] prophecy. Right.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the conclusion of someone
[2:05:15] who's authorized authorized to write on
[2:05:18] behalf of believe the sign. Now, part of
[2:05:21] the reason I'm getting up and a lot of
[2:05:23] you perhaps don't even know a thing
[2:05:24] about it. I heard about this within
[2:05:27] hours. I heard about it. I got brother
[2:05:31] John Andy sitting behind me got a phone
[2:05:33] call from way down in southern United
[2:05:36] States and says, "Do you know what is on
[2:05:39] believe the sign?" And and we just
[2:05:42] brought it up. I just scanned it. Uh a a
[2:05:46] widow of a trinitarian preacher and
[2:05:48] another trinitarian giving prophecies
[2:05:51] concerning my prophet. Not on your life.
[2:05:54] I got on the phone says take that
[2:05:57] believe the sign off of our website
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; immediately.
[2:06:01] [Applause]
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:05] [Applause]
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; I would say that we'd be in danger if we
[2:06:14] just sat back and took this casually.
[2:06:17] This can't be taken casually. We have to
[2:06:20] take a stand.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not against but for. When we
[2:06:25] take a stand for Christ, for the word,
[2:06:28] for his spoken word, this is the
[2:06:30] revelation of Jesus Christ in our day.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; He says the two and he goes on
[2:06:38] the two versions of the prophecy.
[2:06:41] Notice the prophecy is just given out.
[2:06:43] Poor people who don't understand, who
[2:06:45] maybe don't have a a minister that'll
[2:06:47] stand up and speak, they continue to
[2:06:49] say, "Oh, they are prophecies. They are
[2:06:51] prophecies." And the question is, who
[2:06:53] said they're prophecies?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? You're looking
[2:06:56] at a man. I have heard hundreds of
[2:06:58] prophecies
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; and anointed. Absolutely anointed. And
[2:07:03] they just make your flesh tingle.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; And some of them were just as false as a
[2:07:07] $3 bill.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I've told it to you here. I don't
[2:07:11] mind telling it to the internet. A a
[2:07:14] young couple in our church were to go to
[2:07:16] the Arctic. They went to Vancouver
[2:07:18] Island. My father was to go to Africa.
[2:07:21] He never left. He never left Canada. My
[2:07:24] sister and her husband were supposed to
[2:07:25] go to to Laos or Indochina they called
[2:07:29] then and his brother was supposed to go
[2:07:32] to Indochina and my brother-in-law went
[2:07:34] to Saskatchewan and his brother went to
[2:07:36] Jamaica. What do you mean out of that?
[2:07:39] Can the Holy Ghost say something that's
[2:07:41] totally false?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; I say no.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Say it for what it is. Amen.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; It's a lying spirit.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; It's not the Holy Spirit. How can the
[2:07:56] Holy Spirit speak such a thing?
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Deal with it.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Two versions of the prophecy also differ
[2:08:09] on the timing of the error that William
[2:08:13] Broner would make.
[2:08:15] really
[2:08:22] believe the sign.
[2:08:25] Someone who was in this church
[2:08:32] and that's not where it ends, friends.
[2:08:40] This will go back
[2:08:42] and now I will make a prediction not a
[2:08:45] prophecy. This will people who write
[2:08:48] these things are on their way back to
[2:08:50] their Pentecostal roots.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Because they have already joined with
[2:08:57] the Pentecostal spirit.
[2:09:05] Yes sir.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say it is interesting that
[2:09:14] it is interesting to note that both
[2:09:16] William Brham and Kenneth Hagen agree.
[2:09:19] Notice now I wish I had this on. Listen
[2:09:21] very close.
[2:09:24] The comment the one who is making the
[2:09:26] comments makes this statement now for
[2:09:28] multitudes to read and have read. It is
[2:09:31] interesting to note that both William
[2:09:35] Brham and Kenneth Hagen agree that Anna
[2:09:39] Schrader was a prophetess. That's
[2:09:42] absolutely false. And the very quote
[2:09:45] that he refers to here, but the people
[2:09:47] won't have access to the quote. The very
[2:09:50] quote says this. Here's little Miss
[2:09:53] Strader here. I was talking to her today
[2:09:56] in there. You wonder why she lays like
[2:09:59] that. Brother Bram was talking about how
[2:10:02] a vision drains him and what it is to
[2:10:05] have a vision and in that in that
[2:10:07] position. He says, "And you wonder why
[2:10:10] she lays like that." He says, "She has a
[2:10:13] gift of prophecy."
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; That is not saying she's a prophetist.
[2:10:20] Right.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham makes a distinction
[2:10:24] and teaches us a gift of prophecy. You
[2:10:27] can prophesy once and maybe never
[2:10:29] prophesy again.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; You may prophesy again. A gift of
[2:10:35] prophecy is exactly what it is. It's a
[2:10:37] gift to prophecy.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; And you may prophesy once. He said it's
[2:10:42] not a prophet.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; He said there's a difference between a
[2:10:46] prophet and the gift of prophecy. So I
[2:10:49] will say it may be the thin edge of the
[2:10:51] wedge but some have already fallen off
[2:10:53] the side
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; because they don't know the word of God
[2:10:58] and have and are not acquainted with
[2:11:00] that what the messenger said.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; If they read that they couldn't say this
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; and I felt I need to make that a point
[2:11:06] with you. He never once called her a
[2:11:09] prophetess.
[2:11:11] That's right.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; But it's brought forward that both
[2:11:18] William Brandham and Kenneth Hagen and
[2:11:20] and I just have to tell you it's a lie.
[2:11:22] It's not true.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; And then when I read that, I say why?
[2:11:27] The threeletter word why. Why? What is
[2:11:31] the intent? Why does this person say
[2:11:34] that? Cuz he wants you to believe that
[2:11:37] your prophet called her a prophetess.
[2:11:39] And that is absolutely false.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, church?
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to swallow
[2:11:47] something up if you've ever read it. And
[2:11:49] I don't want you to even bother going,
[2:11:51] but this is for anyone in the future.
[2:11:53] And what you will what you will hear,
[2:11:56] you'll hear further things
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; because people are on their way back to
[2:12:01] their roots.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; And they're giving up the message.
[2:12:05] These are the seeds of discrepancy that
[2:12:08] takes a person away from the message.
[2:12:10] And I say to this congregation and all
[2:12:12] who will hear me, have no part of it.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Do not be troubled
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; in mind or in word or by letter.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Your apostle Paul says, "Be not troubled
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; in mind or in word or in letter. have no
[2:12:34] part of this.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; So, well, I have friends that just a
[2:12:39] second. This isn't based on your
[2:12:41] friends.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; This isn't based on your family. This is
[2:12:45] based on the word of God.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul spoke it and a proven
[2:12:49] messenger has said it.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And I quite frankly believe it.
[2:13:08] You know, sometimes
[2:13:16] in that very message that we refer to it
[2:13:20] is uh
[2:13:23] conference.
[2:13:26] Brother Brandham said she has a gift of
[2:13:28] prophecy
[2:13:31] in that very message.
[2:13:36] This quote is inserted here to
[2:13:40] substantiate that William Brham
[2:13:44] considered her as a prophetess which
[2:13:46] number one is totally false. But for
[2:13:49] those that are ignorant or maybe naive
[2:13:52] or could be led astray in the way, they
[2:13:55] put the quote there. But I said, why
[2:13:58] didn't the commentator, why didn't they
[2:14:01] go to the end of the message?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Where the where brother Brandham says
[2:14:06] this now, father, something to this
[2:14:09] effect. You can read it. It's a
[2:14:11] conference
[2:14:12] uh November 25th, 1960.
[2:14:16] And he goes to go to the end of the
[2:14:18] message and see the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; coming on the scene
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; and starting and he just starts and
[2:14:26] calls people by name. Says there's a
[2:14:28] dark shadow uh circling this person and
[2:14:31] it's epilepsy.
[2:14:33] And he talks to another person. He gives
[2:14:35] her her name. Gives another person their
[2:14:38] name. Give who was that? That was listen
[2:14:41] to me. That was the other angel that
[2:14:44] these people don't know.
[2:14:47] [Applause]
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; No, the message can become articulate
[2:14:53] perhaps in the message, but the person,
[2:14:56] the message is a person.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; If you've read the message as a book,
[2:15:00] you're missing it.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; It's the other angel.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; One that you can feel, one you can
[2:15:07] communicate with, one you can love, one
[2:15:10] that speaks back to you.
[2:15:12] Come on, congregation. I'm talking about
[2:15:15] a person who said he loves you.
[2:15:22] [Applause]
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; I had those quotes. I had that very
[2:15:38] thing. But I'm I've got to end right
[2:15:39] now. My time has slipped.
[2:16:21] I've been so
[2:16:26] affected
[2:16:28] and you have heard me preach many many
[2:16:30] times and this is very unusual for me.
[2:16:33] So I take it extremely seriously,
[2:16:37] extremely seriously.
[2:16:40] But this gentleman or this person says,
[2:16:43] "My current opinion
[2:16:46] about Anna Schrader's prophecy is that
[2:16:50] number one, both Kenneth Hagen and
[2:16:52] William Brham have publicly acknowledged
[2:16:56] that Anna Schrader was a prophetess."
[2:16:59] I say false. Right.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; That never happened.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; That she has a gift of prophecy.
[2:17:07] Millions have a gift of prophecy.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Did she prophesy about his death? I do
[2:17:14] not know
[2:17:17] that a note was handed somebody and they
[2:17:19] remembered and it's written in 1992.
[2:17:22] Forget it.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Just go to the go to the conference. Go
[2:17:27] to the message. go to the end of the
[2:17:29] message and hear a prophet of God say,
[2:17:31] "Now, Father, come now and confirm that
[2:17:35] I have spoke the truth."
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; And that's the one that's getting you
[2:17:41] into error. I say, "Give me that kind of
[2:17:44] error."
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; It's an error to the world. That's fine.
[2:17:48] But give me that kind.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me him who knows my
[2:17:52] name. Give me him who knows where I came
[2:17:55] from and where I'm going to.
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; This is his opinion. Kenneth Hagen's
[2:18:06] version of the prophecy. Prophecy is
[2:18:08] likely paraphrased.
[2:18:12] Number three, Kenneth Hagen's version of
[2:18:14] the prophecy is subject to considerable
[2:18:17] amount of error in its retelling as he
[2:18:20] is the only one only one to document the
[2:18:23] prophecy and has and and as he was not
[2:18:27] present to hear the original prophecy.
[2:18:29] What's the purpose of that is so what's
[2:18:31] the purpose of putting it in a public
[2:18:33] domain for everyone to read?
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose?
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Does it make any sense?
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; No sense to a balanced mind. Yeah.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; What do you say? Well, you know, it's
[2:18:44] it's subject to all kinds of error,
[2:18:45] etc., but you're going to put it up
[2:18:47] there for the people to read.
[2:18:49] You wanting somebody to believe that,
[2:18:51] you know, you have such a knowledge of
[2:18:53] these things. I don't understand it.
[2:18:57] Number four, it is very unlikely that
[2:19:00] Anna Schrader would first prophesy that
[2:19:02] William Brham was sent because she
[2:19:04] spoke, she interpreted some tongues that
[2:19:07] was in a service. And Gordon Lindsay
[2:19:10] said it was such a powerful thing. And
[2:19:12] uh uh she prophesied that William Brham
[2:19:16] was sent forth to forrun the second
[2:19:18] coming. Whether or without the ministers
[2:19:22] is outside of the scope of this article.
[2:19:24] that is other ministers because Gordon
[2:19:26] Lindseay said in his in his uh book that
[2:19:30] that he would forun the second coming
[2:19:32] and and other ministers
[2:19:36] and then prophesy his doom for walking
[2:19:38] in the way of Dowi. Dahi Dowi is one uh
[2:19:43] those you that know he had established
[2:19:45] uh believe that he the spirit of Elijah
[2:19:48] was upon him. Number five, it is
[2:19:51] possible that Anna Schrader did prophesy
[2:19:53] his death at some point prior to 1965.
[2:19:57] Many people tried number
[2:20:00] many people try to discredit William
[2:20:02] Brandham's entire ministry. This is now
[2:20:05] his comment. Uh the entire ministry and
[2:20:08] teaching based on their presumption that
[2:20:10] he went off in the end. While these
[2:20:13] prophecies, and he keep putting that
[2:20:14] forward, these prophecies are the first
[2:20:17] indication we have that William
[2:20:19] Brandham's death may have been the
[2:20:21] result of some grave error on his part.
[2:20:25] Kenneth Hagen's prophecy does not define
[2:20:28] the error. The error may not have been
[2:20:31] doctrinal at all, but perhaps a simple
[2:20:34] expression of humanity like the anger
[2:20:36] that Moses expressed which cost him the
[2:20:39] inheritance in the promised land. Well,
[2:20:42] that's not exactly so. That was all in
[2:20:44] the plan of God. Moses had to leave so
[2:20:47] Joshua could take them in. Jesus said,
[2:20:49] "It's expedient for you that I leave so
[2:20:53] that if I don't leave, the Holy Spirit
[2:20:55] won't come." Joshua was Jehovah's
[2:20:58] savior. He had to take the people in and
[2:21:01] appoint them their land. And that's why
[2:21:04] Joshua was preached on. Oh my. That's
[2:21:07] why Ephesians is our Joshua.
[2:21:11] I'm getting weak, folks. But listen to
[2:21:13] me while I come through this thing. Th
[2:21:16] this is urgent that you need to know
[2:21:18] this
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; and it's urgent that it needs to come to
[2:21:21] the surface
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; because I say in the name of the Lord,
[2:21:24] you'll be hearing things in the future
[2:21:27] and you need to know where you stand.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; And I say, bathe yourself,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; eat,
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; devour
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; the word. Not for memory's sake, not to
[2:21:39] try to learn things, just to absorb the
[2:21:41] atmosphere of the message,
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere of the other angel.
[2:21:57] cost Moses his inheritance in the land.
[2:22:02] And I have said this statement is the is
[2:22:05] the result of complete ignorance of the
[2:22:07] plan of God. Joshua another office had
[2:22:10] to take the people in exactly as Jesus
[2:22:13] could not take his disciples into the
[2:22:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that
[2:22:18] could only come after the spirit of the
[2:22:21] promise was given.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:26] This is my comment now and I'm closing
[2:22:30] to substantiate
[2:22:32] that these articles as prophecies of
[2:22:35] brother Brandham's death is to
[2:22:37] substantiate the reason why he went.
[2:22:43] That's really I'm uncovering it now.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's really what this person is doing.
[2:22:50] They are not substantiating. Well, the
[2:22:53] you know the prophecy could be this way
[2:22:54] was you know the prophecy this and the
[2:22:56] prophecy that and something else. That's
[2:22:58] all that's all smoke and mirrors.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; You say what was the reason of the
[2:23:05] prophecies? The reason of the prophecies
[2:23:08] every instance was to get to the people
[2:23:11] that the man was in error. And I flatly
[2:23:15] deny that.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; I aggressively deny that.
[2:23:21] Amen.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; They're speaking about my liberty.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; They're speaking about the redemption.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Speaking about what God did to my home
[2:23:30] and my family, to you as an individual,
[2:23:33] and what I've seen God do. And I won't
[2:23:35] trade it for anything.
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Won't trade it for anything.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; What's it done for you, friends?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:50] And I don't want anyone to sit here and
[2:23:51] say tusk tusk. You know, we shouldn't
[2:23:54] have to speak about these things. You're
[2:23:56] going to face it and you better pack it
[2:23:58] and take it as a burden of the word of
[2:24:00] the Lord this morning. You're going to
[2:24:02] need this shovel. You're going to need
[2:24:04] this grenade. You're going to need these
[2:24:06] bullets sometime. You're going to need
[2:24:08] this armament. It's given for your
[2:24:10] safety and for your protection. You'll
[2:24:13] be able to leave here and stand alone
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; if you have to stand on a hill and say,
[2:24:19] "I've been told and from that morning,
[2:24:22] from that morning service, I have given
[2:24:24] myself to to feed on this word." And
[2:24:28] you'll get some muscles of faith,
[2:24:30] friends.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here's what Brother
[2:24:34] Brandham said. I'm closing with this on
[2:24:36] the seventh seal.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Now, he said when this tape gets out,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. which it is.
[2:24:44] That'll probably send 10,000 of my
[2:24:48] friends
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; away from me.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it did.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; And we're only reading some evidence of
[2:24:59] it.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; And people who have taken the message
[2:25:02] themselves and claim to be followers of
[2:25:04] the message, and I pray they will
[2:25:06] continue to do so. I pray that they will
[2:25:08] repent.
[2:25:11] And that's the only conclusion. It's not
[2:25:13] just a, you know, we don't just come
[2:25:15] into unity and say, "Well, we're all
[2:25:17] nice people." That's not the basis of
[2:25:19] fellowship. If we walk in the light as
[2:25:21] he is in the light and he is the light,
[2:25:24] then we have fellowship one with
[2:25:25] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:25:27] cleanseth us from all sin. That's the
[2:25:30] basis of fellowship.
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; It'll send 10,000 my friends away from
[2:25:39] me.
[2:25:40] Because they're going to say that
[2:25:42] brother Brandham, here's what they're
[2:25:43] going to say.
[2:25:45] That brother Brandham's trying to put
[2:25:47] himself and make himself a servant or a
[2:25:50] prophet.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a prophecy.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; They're going to come and say William
[2:25:57] Brandham's trying to make himself
[2:25:59] Elijah.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Or another phrase was the messenger of
[2:26:03] the covenant.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; And what he said, the messenger of the
[2:26:06] covenant is Jesus Christ.
[2:26:08] But let me clear something up. He also
[2:26:10] said several times he referred to John
[2:26:12] the Baptist as a messenger of the
[2:26:15] covenant. Messenger is a messenger. He
[2:26:18] carries a message. And it was John's. It
[2:26:22] was John's giving to identify
[2:26:25] this is him.
[2:26:28] This is the lamb of God.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; He was the messenger of the covenant.
[2:26:33] But John was a messenger of the covenant
[2:26:37] to say this is him. And this was William
[2:26:40] Brandham's a message of the covenant as
[2:26:43] well announcing this is the covenant
[2:26:46] announcing.
[2:26:48] Listen to me friends. Revelation I feel
[2:26:50] like preaching now. Revelation 10:1. And
[2:26:53] I saw another mighty angel. That's the
[2:26:55] other angel descending from heaven with
[2:26:58] a rainbow over his head. What is the
[2:27:00] rainbow? The covenant.
[2:27:05] descending with the covenant. What is
[2:27:08] the covenant? The restored word back to
[2:27:11] the people.
[2:27:16] And here's the spirit that's trying to
[2:27:18] get people to believe it was error. I
[2:27:21] deny that spirit in the name of Jesus
[2:27:24] Christ.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm telling you friends,
[2:27:31] this is a power that will keep you. This
[2:27:33] is a power that will keep our young
[2:27:35] ladies. I can give you a power by the
[2:27:38] Holy Ghost. I can lead you to a power
[2:27:41] that will keep you
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; pure.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Keep you
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; from falling.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Power that can keep you to walk on the
[2:27:53] thin edge of the wedge.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; To walk on the razor edge of this
[2:27:57] generation.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:59] And he says,
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; and he says this at the end of this
[2:28:02] paragraph
[2:28:05] with this I leave it to you. He said,
[2:28:07] "It may be time.
[2:28:10] It may be the hour now that this great
[2:28:12] person
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; that we're expecting to rise on the
[2:28:16] scene
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; may rise on the scene.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe this ministry that I've tried to
[2:28:23] take people back to the word
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; has laid a foundation.
[2:28:27] And if it has, I'll be leaving you for
[2:28:30] good. He prophesied his departure. He
[2:28:33] doesn't need some Pentecostals
[2:28:35] prophesying his departure. He prophesied
[2:28:38] it.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; I'll be leaving you soon.
[2:28:42] [Music]
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; I'll be leaving you for good.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; There won't be two of us here at the
[2:28:50] same time.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:04] Oh, isn't it wonderful?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; It won't be two of us here at the same
[2:29:09] time. I hope that was clear. I hope it
[2:29:11] wasn't misunderstood.
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:24] [Applause]
[2:29:34] We give you praise, Lord. We give you
[2:29:36] praise.
[2:29:39] Hallelujah.
[2:29:41] Hallelujah.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:29:48] Hallelujah.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Come, brother.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a verse or two. Behold,
[2:29:54] what manner of man is this
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; that stands between God and man? His
[2:30:00] eyes are like a flame of fire. His fan
[2:30:03] is in his hand.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Behold, what manner of man is this? I
[2:30:09] want to get to
[2:30:14] verse four, please.
[2:30:19] Behold, what manner of man is this who
[2:30:22] stand between God and man? His eyes are
[2:30:26] as a flame of fire. His man is in his
[2:30:30] hand. John in the seven churches and
[2:30:35] sun.
[2:30:38] Behold what matter of man is this? Heat.
[2:30:41] Heat.
[2:30:53] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:01] [Music]
[2:31:05] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:15] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:25] Heat.
[2:31:28] Heat.
[2:31:38] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:49] Gracious
[2:31:51] the everlasting father throughout
[2:31:55] eternity.
[2:31:56] [Music]
[2:31:58] Before we sing, I just want to say
[2:32:01] to many of you here,
[2:32:04] I'm well aware
[2:32:07] of families and family ties.
[2:32:12] I'm well aware of it.
[2:32:16] And I don't just stand here today.
[2:32:20] I had to make my decision for this
[2:32:23] message many, many years ago.
[2:32:27] Many years ago.
[2:32:29] And quite frankly, I was the only one in
[2:32:33] my family that received it
[2:32:36] at the time. And number two, my wife was
[2:32:40] the only one in her family.
[2:32:45] Was
[2:32:48] [Music]
[2:32:50] it easy?
[2:32:52] [Music]
[2:32:53] Well, I don't know.
[2:32:56] We didn't make a big issue of it.
[2:33:00] [Music]
[2:33:01] I knew one thing. It was real to me.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; And I was just a young man like some of
[2:33:08] you young people that are here. I'm
[2:33:11] very, very aware. believe me very aware.
[2:33:15] And on the other hand,
[2:33:18] I only know of one solution. I only know
[2:33:20] of one answer
[2:33:23] and that is that you yourself must
[2:33:25] anchor yourself body, spirit, and soul
[2:33:29] in the word of God that God has made
[2:33:31] real to you.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; I cannot escape a revelation of the word
[2:33:36] of God. It became Christ to me. Amen.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; It was not Christ to me in a triangle
[2:33:42] and this and that one and mother father
[2:33:44] wherever more I my father when he passed
[2:33:47] away God bless him. We loved each other
[2:33:50] so deeply and I I encouraged him to read
[2:33:52] the church age book and he was reading
[2:33:54] it. He loved the book of revelation and
[2:33:56] he had he he he wrote a book in fact
[2:33:58] called the midnight trump. It was
[2:34:00] excellent. I only have one copy of it,
[2:34:03] little tiny book. And and I but what
[2:34:07] brother Brandham was saying was very
[2:34:08] different from what he had gathered in
[2:34:10] his studies. That was not the point.
[2:34:13] Friends, I wouldn't do my father any
[2:34:15] damage. I wouldn't speak about your
[2:34:17] relatives or your friends adversely or
[2:34:20] wrong in any way. You must just commit
[2:34:22] them to God.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; As God's children
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; because it's not us. We don't put people
[2:34:31] in or take people out. We don't do that
[2:34:34] at all. But is it possible for good
[2:34:36] people to be led astray or persuaded?
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; It absolutely is.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching this for people who've
[2:34:44] never come in contact with anything. You
[2:34:46] could be people that could be your
[2:34:48] friends in the world. Don't you for a
[2:34:50] second let the friends of the world
[2:34:53] afflict you.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Not for a second.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:59] I'm talking about eternal life.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about eternal life.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about he who made all
[2:35:08] things.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; How glorious he is.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And if you have anything afflicting you,
[2:35:16] settle it in your mind right now and
[2:35:18] here. And all you need to do is say,
[2:35:20] "Lord, I believe that that was truth
[2:35:22] that was preached. This was unbiased.
[2:35:25] This was exposing. And this is speaking
[2:35:28] truth.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; This is identifying with the message of
[2:35:31] the hour
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; as absolute truth.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:36] [Music]
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; I can find holes in the Bible. Said you
[2:35:42] can. Yeah. God said to Moses, don't you
[2:35:45] make a graven image of any kind that
[2:35:49] represents anything in heaven.
[2:35:53] and then tells them go and make two
[2:35:55] graven make the angels and their wings
[2:35:57] will touch and put them in the holiest
[2:35:59] place there is on the mercy seat
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; say well did he say it over here what
[2:36:03] did he mean over here I don't know it's
[2:36:06] the same God he can say what he wants
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; what are we some little puny
[2:36:13] insignificant as brother Brandon says
[2:36:15] crawling just like worms crawling on the
[2:36:18] dry dry uh you know fibers of life.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Your life might pass away from you
[2:36:24] today. All God has to do is hold your
[2:36:26] breath up for a few minutes and you're
[2:36:28] gone. I'm gone. Then what?
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; Then what?
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; I can tell you for sure there's only one
[2:36:34] that you're going to face and that's him
[2:36:36] who's here present today as the other
[2:36:39] angel.
[2:36:41] [Applause]
[2:36:41] [Music]
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Once more then I'll have John pray.
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:36:51] No wonder man of man is this who stands
[2:36:55] between God and man. His eyes around
[2:37:00] his hand in his hand
[2:37:05] churches
[2:37:08] brillian
[2:37:11] Yeah. Heat.
[2:37:20] [Applause]
[2:37:22] Heat. Heat.
[2:37:33] and he's the everlasting
[2:37:36] father throughout all eternity.
[2:37:40] Thank you, brothers and sisters. Thank
[2:37:42] you very much. Appreciate your help,
[2:37:45] your support, and listening this morning
[2:37:47] because I didn't know how this service
[2:37:49] was going to go, but I just let it all
[2:37:51] out and whatever happens happens.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Brother John, would you
[2:37:56] pray? And is there anyone here just
[2:37:58] feels a need God to meet your need right
[2:38:00] where you're at? Amen.
[2:38:05] Lord Jesus, we want to give our lives to
[2:38:08] you, Lord.
[2:38:11] Most of us weren't privileged to be here
[2:38:13] 50 years ago
[2:38:15] in the presence of that seventh angel,
[2:38:19] but we have been privileged to be in
[2:38:21] your presence and for your spirit to
[2:38:24] come in our day. and the same influence
[2:38:27] and the same atmosphere and the same
[2:38:29] word has caught our hearts. And Lord, we
[2:38:32] want to respond appropriately.
[2:38:35] We want to respond as your wife and as
[2:38:37] your bride to make herself ready.
[2:38:40] Cleanse our hearts and our lives today,
[2:38:42] God. Even at the close of many of the
[2:38:46] meetings when you'd appear and so many
[2:38:48] hearts were hardened, so many would
[2:38:51] stomp out. So many would have different
[2:38:53] opinions, but they that wait upon the
[2:38:56] Lord
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength,
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; and you would come behind it and
[2:39:01] vindicate their lives. Lord, would you
[2:39:04] come behind your elect lady and may the
[2:39:07] life of Jesus Christ be on display. We
[2:39:11] cry out for that presence to flow
[2:39:14] through us, Lord. Making ourselves
[2:39:16] available and the womb of our lives for
[2:39:19] your seed to bring forth your token life
[2:39:23] today, God. At the close of this
[2:39:25] service, we say we surrender, Lord.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; We receive your mighty voice and the
[2:39:31] moving of your spirit and what you've
[2:39:33] done and through the message of the hour
[2:39:35] to give us a promised land experience.
[2:39:38] And Lord, we want to fight as Joshua and
[2:39:41] Caleb. And we want to stand like men and
[2:39:44] women of faith and drive out the
[2:39:47] inhabitants of our land and in our
[2:39:49] personal lives, in our families. We want
[2:39:52] to go forward in the promises of God. So
[2:39:55] would you bless every sister and every
[2:39:57] brother and every man and woman.
[2:40:00] Bring forth within our hearts the reason
[2:40:04] that you sent out this mighty voice,
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Lord. May the other angel come behind
[2:40:11] the word and water it and soak down into
[2:40:14] our lives what we need today to manifest
[2:40:18] in these closing moments. Lord, in our
[2:40:21] right attitude, in the right spirit as
[2:40:23] you're capping off an elected lady,
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; go with every heart and life.
[2:40:29] And we receive your word in Jesus
[2:40:32] Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[2:40:39] God bless you. And just as we leave,
[2:40:41] we'll shake hands and greet one another
[2:40:44] and sing, "Take the name of Jesus with
[2:40:46] you."
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:50] Did
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; I hear amen? God bless you. You're
[2:40:53] dismissed in Jesus name. Tearing the
[2:40:57] name of Jesus with you,
[2:41:01] child of sorrow and absor.
