[0:37] I've never been sorry

[5:06] We're going to go to prayer at this
[5:07] time. I'm going to ask brother Glenn
[5:08] Grun. Brother Glenn, if you'd come and
[5:10] open the service in a word of prayer.
[5:13] and uh want to be praying continue to
[5:17] pray for uh our sisters in the hospital.
[5:19] The Lord would just touch her.
[5:21] Understand she's gone in for emergency
[5:23] surgery. Just want to be remembering her
[5:26] this evening in prayer. And if you've
[5:27] got a need, if you're listening in on
[5:28] the internet, you've got a need, just
[5:30] lift your hand to the Lord. Amen. Our
[5:33] God knows what your need is even before
[5:35] we ask. Amen. Glenn, if you'd come,
[5:42] let's bow our heads.
[5:46] Precious heavenly father, we come to you
[5:48] once again, God, being a needy people,
[5:51] Lord, desiring, God, first of all, you
[5:54] come in our midst this evening, Lord, to
[5:56] speak to us in a special way, Lord, as
[5:59] you so graciously did this morning for
[6:01] us, Lord. And
[6:03] we also uh are thinking of our sister
[6:05] Megan, Lord, in the hospital
[6:08] &gt;&gt; hearing that uh there's trouble again,
[6:11] Lord. I just pray that you'd come on the
[6:13] scene, Lord.
[6:15] God, uh have your perfect will in her
[6:17] life, Lord. And Lord, be with those that
[6:20] are with her now, Lord. Give them,
[6:24] Lord, your mercy in their lives, Lord.
[6:26] God to just trust you, Lord, to
[6:30] &gt;&gt; just trust your perfect will in her
[6:32] life. Lord, I just ask you raise her up,
[6:34] Lord, as we prayed this morning. We're
[6:35] going to continue to pray this way,
[6:37] Lord, that you'd raise her up for your
[6:38] glory.
[6:40] And Lord, we just commit her life into
[6:42] your hands now, Lord.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; God,
[6:45] &gt;&gt; and Lord, once again, we just count it
[6:47] an awesome privilege, God, to be in your
[6:50] house this evening, God, in your
[6:52] presence. And Lord, we desire once again
[6:55] you'd speak to our hearts, Lord. Draw us
[6:58] into heavenly places, Lord.
[7:01] Bring us closer to you, God. For we know
[7:03] that our time is short here, Lord.
[7:05] You're preparing your bride to leave
[7:07] this earth, Lord. And I just pray that
[7:08] you'd come this evening in a special
[7:10] way. Speak to our hearts, each one
[7:12] individually. Lord, I pray in Jesus
[7:15] name. Amen.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[7:26] Brother Ryan has got a song for us. And
[7:28] uh just one announcement. Um you'll
[7:31] notice, oh, some people have a uh this
[7:34] seat is reserved for me. I got one of
[7:36] them, right? Cuz when I'm up here, I
[7:39] need to have a place that I can go and
[7:40] sit down. But if you've got one of
[7:42] those, uh
[7:45] you need to put it down at the beginning
[7:46] of the service. It doesn't allow you to
[7:48] come to service late. So, Brother Alex
[7:51] is gonna I haven't talked to Brother
[7:52] Alex, but you know, if you see those
[7:54] green things sitting there between
[7:55] services, Brother Alex, you just pick
[7:56] them up. And I talked to deacons about
[7:59] it. And uh so, so uh if you if you get
[8:02] here, right, you're coming here, that's
[8:04] what I do. I come here and I go and I
[8:06] put my little green thing down and then
[8:08] it's safe for that service. And if I'm
[8:10] not here, then it doesn't take a place.
[8:13] And so, uh if you've got one of those
[8:16] green things, just take it home with you
[8:18] after the service. And then when you get
[8:20] to service here, you can put it down and
[8:21] that saves you a seat when you're here.
[8:23] But it doesn't save you a seat here, you
[8:26] know, all the time. So, uh, it's just
[8:29] when you're here and if you get to
[8:31] service in time enough to get a seat.
[8:34] So, um, is that is that a good idea?
[8:37] People with little green things are
[8:38] going, "No, no, now I have to come here
[8:40] early." But everybody else in the same
[8:42] boat and uh so uh so I think it's a good
[8:47] idea because I'm subject to the same
[8:48] rule. So
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:52] Brother Ryan,
[8:56] I don't usually feel to dedicate a song
[8:59] a certain direction. Um I just fear that
[9:01] the Lord puts a song in my heart that
[9:02] the people that are to be blessed by it
[9:04] will will be regardless of whether I say
[9:06] anything. Uh just to give a little bit
[9:08] of a history behind this uh the chorus
[9:11] in the first part of the song uh came
[9:13] after Silas's passing when I was in
[9:14] Israel and I got the phone call and uh I
[9:17] was extremely burdened for the family
[9:18] and some of the young people. I'm close
[9:20] to a lot of the ones who were uh very
[9:22] affected by it. And uh that evening as I
[9:26] was just in prayer for the family and so
[9:28] I just was so burdened I couldn't even
[9:30] really pray anymore and I didn't have
[9:32] any words to say and I just sat there in
[9:35] the Lord's presence for a moment and
[9:36] then I just began to sing and the chorus
[9:38] to this song just came out just with no
[9:41] prior thought. It just kind of just came
[9:43] out at that point and I felt to come
[9:45] home and sing it but I wasn't finished
[9:47] with it and the Lord wouldn't give me
[9:48] the rest of the verses up until
[9:50] yesterday after sister Megan had gone
[9:52] into the hospital and Megan's close to
[9:53] my family and it just came I think the
[9:56] Lord needed me to experience that before
[9:59] he could give me the rest of the song.
[10:00] So it was more even more personal to
[10:02] myself and it's called you are God and
[10:05] it just speaks about how the Lord does
[10:07] all things well even when we can't
[10:08] understand. And that's what we're
[10:10] resting in at this time, even as she's
[10:11] in surgery while we're here tonight. So,
[10:14] the devil's tried to hit me with a bit
[10:15] of a cold, but I'm going to sing it
[10:17] anyway, and I hope that you'll be
[10:18] blessed, even if my voice isn't where it
[10:20] would usually be. So, God bless you.
[10:24] [Music]
[10:40] When my heart is tested
[10:44] and my strength is all but gone
[10:48] and in the times I wonder,
[10:53] how can I carry on?
[10:57] When my steps grow heavy and the
[11:01] suffering clouds my view, Lord, I still
[11:06] trust in you.
[11:10] Deep within my being,
[11:14] there's a calm I can't explain.
[11:19] A blessed sweet assurance
[11:23] that's deeper than the pain.
[11:27] For I have found a comfort where no
[11:32] comfort could be found, holding me fast
[11:37] and sure.
[11:43] You
[11:46] are God
[11:48] [Music]
[11:51] and I
[11:54] am
[11:57] [Music]
[11:59] Lord, you do all things well,
[12:08] even when I cannot
[12:13] understand.
[12:16] And though my heart be torn and my
[12:21] spirit weak,
[12:24] still is your face that my soul shall
[12:30] seek. I know
[12:34] [Music]
[12:37] you
[12:40] are God.
[12:47] It truly does matter
[12:50] how dark may be the night.
[12:54] You said that you'd be with us.
[12:59] However hard the fight and deeper than
[13:04] the loss we feel is the peace that you
[13:08] bestow. Lord, you do all things well.
[13:14] And if there's one thing I know, you are
[13:20] God.
[13:24] And I
[13:27] am
[13:32] Lord, you do all things well.
[13:36] [Music]
[13:41] me there when I cannot
[13:45] understand.
[13:48] And though my heart be torn and my
[13:53] spirit weak, still tears your face. Let
[14:00] my soul shall seek. I know
[14:07] [Music]
[14:10] you
[14:12] are God.
[14:18] You are holy,
[14:23] holy.
[14:26] Your ways are higher than mine.
[14:33] You are rightous.
[14:37] You are glorious.
[14:41] And your ways are higher than mine.
[14:48] You are holy,
[14:53] holy.
[14:55] [Music]
[14:56] Your ways are higher
[15:00] than mine.
[15:05] Holy, holy, Lord.
[15:09] You are holy
[15:16] and you
[15:19] are God.
[15:21] [Music]
[15:25] I
[15:27] am.
[15:32] And Lord, you do all things well.
[15:41] Even when I cannot
[15:45] understand.
[15:48] And though my heart be torn and my
[15:53] spirit weak, still tears your face that
[15:59] my soul shall seek. I know.
[16:09] I
[16:11] know.
[16:12] [Music]
[16:16] And I
[16:17] believe
[16:23] you
[16:26] are God.
[16:32] I know
[16:38] you
[16:40] are God.
[16:49] You are
[16:53] God.
[17:02] man. He is God. There's nobody like him.
[17:06] No God like him. Amen. And we have a
[17:09] privilege. It's a real privilege to be
[17:11] able to serve him.
[17:13] Amen. You're all I want. And we'll
[17:15] return the service to
[17:18] to the word as brother Ed comes.
[17:21] It's number 1027 on the screen. And
[17:24] those who sing in the chorus, you can
[17:26] sing it. Let's stand together as we sing
[17:28] it and just sing it to him this evening.
[17:33] You're all
[17:35] I want.
[17:37] [Music]
[17:38] Heavenly Father,
[17:41] you're all
[17:44] that I need.

[18:06] let the enemy
[18:10] steal
[18:12] away.
[18:15] You're all
[18:17] I want.

[19:04] the enemy
[19:07] steal away.
[19:13] You're all
[19:15] I want.
[19:18] Heavenly Father,
[19:21] you're all
[19:24] the prayer of my heart. Lord, you're all
[19:27] I want. You're all
[19:31] I want.
[19:34] Heavenly Father,
[19:37] you're all

[20:00] I let the enemy

[20:04] ste
[20:06] away.
[20:09] You're all
[20:14] heavenly father.

[20:26] Amen. He's all we need.
[20:29] Wonderful Lord Jesus. Well, I trust you
[20:32] had a good day and you're ready to
[20:35] receive some more.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer
[20:40] together.
[20:43] How gracious and loving Lord Jesus.
[20:46] It is indeed uh our privilege, our honor
[20:50] to be able to come before you.
[20:53] We wish and desire to come humbly,
[20:56] realizing, recognizing
[20:59] our frailty.
[21:02] Lord, we're depending entirely upon the
[21:06] Holy Spirit.
[21:07] Each person needs the Holy Spirit. And
[21:11] we pray, Father, that those that have
[21:14] not been filled will be filled.
[21:17] Those that have been filled will be
[21:19] filled again. one baptism but many
[21:22] fillings. Fill us, oh God, until we're
[21:25] overflowing. Fill us until we affect
[21:28] someone near us. Oh God, fill us until
[21:30] we affect the community. Fill us until
[21:33] we shine. Oh God, let the glory of God
[21:36] shine on our countenance. Shine through
[21:38] our vision, our seeing. Oh God, shine
[21:41] until our conversation is changed. And
[21:44] people can tell by the way we speak
[21:46] we've been with Jesus. Lord, I pray
[21:49] you'll hear our prayers. And and now, oh
[21:51] God, just come, I ask, and take the
[21:54] words and I pray you'll give
[21:56] enlightenment to each of us as we have
[21:58] need of in Jesus Christ's name, we
[22:01] receive now the not only engrafted word,
[22:04] but the anointed word. For this is your
[22:07] breath, and I pray it'll be breathed out
[22:10] upon every life for your glory. Amen.
[22:15] Amen.
[22:16] Well, we want to start with the same
[22:18] scriptures that we read this morning. I
[22:21] don't believe we can possibly tire of
[22:24] them. And uh
[22:27] once again, you can keep your Bibles if
[22:30] you would at the ready because I have a
[22:33] lot of scriptures and it will be good if
[22:35] you can turn to it. It will be good also
[22:38] if you have a piece of paper you can jot
[22:40] it down. I think that uh you know I
[22:43] recommend that because that's what I do.
[22:46] I like to when God speaks to me I like
[22:48] to remember it.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you ever put a good idea down?
[22:52] You get a good idea say that's great. Uh
[22:55] well sometime if you don't it just it's
[22:59] gone like that. You have that problem
[23:02] too. Well I had it today. I was just
[23:05] driving out of here and driving down the
[23:07] road and thought that's wonderful. Ah,
[23:10] can't possibly forget that. By the time
[23:12] I parked my car, I'd forgotten it. So,
[23:15] you know, don't don't trust it to your
[23:17] memory. Trust it to a pen and paper.
[23:21] After all, God put it on paper.
[23:24] Cuz once it down on paper, it always
[23:25] says the same thing. Amen. All right. In
[23:29] Isaiah the 9th chapter, we're we'll read
[23:32] verses six and seven once again. And now
[23:35] you'll have the emphasis
[23:38] on his government. For unto us a child
[23:42] is born. Unto us a son is given. And the
[23:46] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[23:49] And his name shall be called wonderful
[23:51] counselor, the mighty God, the
[23:53] everlasting father, and the prince of
[23:55] peace. Of the increase of his
[23:58] government, and peace there shall be no
[24:02] end. upon the throne of David uh and
[24:06] upon his kingdom to order it and to
[24:09] establish it with judgment and with
[24:12] justice from henceforth even forever.
[24:15] The zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[24:18] perform this. Amen. God bless you.
[24:22] You may be seated.
[24:30] There's so many uh
[24:34] so many relative things that we can make
[24:37] reference to in our in our natural life
[24:40] and we could spend a whole evening on uh
[24:44] on those things which are comparisons
[24:47] and I like to bring in a number of them
[24:49] because uh you know we relate to them
[24:52] right away and then when we when I can
[24:54] bring something you can relate to and
[24:56] say Oh yeah, that you know I understand
[24:58] that. And then bring it into the
[24:59] scripture. Then you can understand where
[25:02] the Holy Spirit is is leading us in in
[25:05] the scripture. And I think that's
[25:06] helpful. Don't you?
[25:08] &gt;&gt; I really believe it is. And so when we
[25:10] speak of uh uh you know of government,
[25:13] it's not the government so much that we
[25:14] have some problem with. It's the people
[25:16] who are in government is where we have
[25:18] problem. And fact is uh brother Brandham
[25:21] even says about say nuns or about that
[25:24] go into the uh to to give themselves to
[25:28] the church or priests that give
[25:30] themselves to the say the Catholic
[25:31] church. He said they don't go in there
[25:33] to be bad people. They go in there to be
[25:36] good. They go in there because they have
[25:37] a desire to do do good for the people. A
[25:41] lot of people, I mean, the presidents
[25:43] and prime ministers and whatever more
[25:46] when they, you know, when they tour the
[25:48] country and make all of their uh
[25:51] establish their their platform for their
[25:54] government, this is what we intend to
[25:56] do. And I don't believe they
[25:58] intentionally intend to get up there and
[26:00] say things that are untrue, but then
[26:02] when they get in the system and the it's
[26:04] the system that corrupts,
[26:06] &gt;&gt; the system always corrupts. And if you
[26:09] bring a system and try to make the word
[26:12] and bring it down and reduce it into a
[26:14] system, it'll be corrupted because man
[26:17] gets his hands on it. Then you see and
[26:19] so these people find themselves in some
[26:21] very very difficult places. And so now
[26:24] just to make that a relative statement
[26:28] uh if we talk about historically you
[26:31] know we could talk about United States
[26:33] and George Washington and Abraham
[26:35] Lincoln and nobody has any problem with
[26:37] them now but they had a big problem with
[26:39] Abraham Lincoln back then because
[26:41] somebody got up and shot shot him and
[26:43] assassinated him and so there was
[26:45] certainly a problem with him. They they
[26:48] speak of Jesus today. Oh Jesus. You
[26:50] know, everybody uses their name either
[26:52] in vain or uses it lovingly. Don't don't
[26:55] forget that name bore a lot of reproach
[26:57] back there. And not everybody who stood
[27:00] on stood on the side of the trail was in
[27:02] favor of that name of Jesus Christ. And
[27:05] so and that's always that way. We even
[27:07] talk about you know Charles Wesley and
[27:09] and the great move of the sanctification
[27:13] uh sanctification of the spirit. Hey,
[27:15] uh, even the name Methodist is it was a
[27:18] reproached name at the time because they
[27:21] they called it the new method. Oh, you
[27:24] that you're a Methodist because he was
[27:27] standing on a chair or standing on a box
[27:29] and preaching to hundreds if not
[27:31] thousands of people. He was he didn't
[27:33] win a popularity contest. I guarantee
[27:35] you. Uh, he he was put out of every
[27:37] pulpit in England. And that's why they
[27:39] had to preach on the streets because his
[27:42] name was so reproached at that time. And
[27:44] Luther today, there isn't there isn't a
[27:46] church in the country that's, you know,
[27:48] I don't think that's got uh uh the name
[27:50] Lutheran on it that is that is being,
[27:53] you know, torched or anything else. Uh
[27:56] but but don't forget back then they were
[27:58] hunting him down and he was in hiding.
[28:00] And so that's always the way it is. And
[28:02] it's that way right today. I'd say if
[28:05] the world will go on, if the world would
[28:07] go on for many, many years, people won't
[28:09] have the problem with the name William
[28:10] Brandham, he'll probably go down as as
[28:13] one who did more to change the face of
[28:15] Christianity because you cannot you
[28:18] cannot avoid and get away from the
[28:21] profound truths that have been spoken
[28:23] through that prophet's mouth. You just
[28:25] can't get away from it.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; And not that we want to,
[28:29] &gt;&gt; but the world won't be wouldn't be able
[28:31] to get away from it. And that's why even
[28:33] when you that have shared the message
[28:35] and you talk to people, you find that
[28:38] people that are completely right out in
[28:39] the world, you talk about serpent seed
[28:41] to them, they say, "Of course, of
[28:44] course." It's the only thing that makes
[28:45] sense.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; You know, but they they don't you don't
[28:48] you don't even need to have, you know,
[28:51] you just don't have to have barriers,
[28:52] but if you got barriers, then it becomes
[28:54] a problem. See, but people just see it,
[28:57] you know, and so many, many other
[28:59] things.
[29:01] All right. So now I just want to uh take
[29:03] and and make reference to this uh
[29:06] government and I would like to say
[29:07] regarding uh government because we're
[29:10] speaking of the administrative offices
[29:12] that God puts uh within his government
[29:15] because he has a kingdom. He has a
[29:17] government and he has also allocated or
[29:22] allotted certain abilities to certain
[29:26] persons for a certain time.
[29:31] Yes.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[29:33] &gt;&gt; God has allotted. He's he's he's
[29:35] allotted. He's actually given a certain
[29:38] ability to a certain individual for a
[29:42] certain season. And sometimes now that
[29:47] when that season arrives, whether the
[29:50] people are accepted or not, that's
[29:51] irrelevant for my message tonight. But
[29:53] when that season arrives, God stands
[29:56] behind that individual and it becomes
[29:59] abundantly evident that they have an
[30:01] unusual place. They have a special
[30:03] calling. They have they could the world
[30:05] can say, "Well, they're gifted or
[30:07] they're a powerful ministry or this or
[30:09] that or the other thing." And it doesn't
[30:11] have to be a powerful ministry, but God
[30:13] in a certain place, it might be
[30:15] relatively uh small in its influence,
[30:18] but you can say that that's a godly
[30:20] person. That's a godly man, a godly
[30:22] woman. and God has raised them up for a
[30:24] specific purpose. But in in God's
[30:27] government, in his kingdom, he has
[30:29] raised up certain offices. Now, there
[30:31] are offices like we're going to be
[30:33] speaking about the high priest. Uh the
[30:35] first high priest that we know of is
[30:37] Aaron. And then there's been high
[30:39] priests all the way through the
[30:41] centuries until when Jesus was before uh
[30:44] the judgment the high priest was was
[30:47] there was another high priest there uh
[30:50] Ananas and and he was in power I believe
[30:52] at that time and then there so there's
[30:56] been high priests all the way along when
[30:57] one died another one had to come up and
[31:00] they had a certain function that they
[31:02] were to discharge but God had a God had
[31:08] he had uh given and I want to say this
[31:11] carefully. It wasn't necessarily the man
[31:14] but it was the office that was uh that
[31:17] was regarded because God had designated
[31:19] the office with a certain level of
[31:21] authority and a certain level of
[31:24] respect. You remember when Apostle Paul
[31:26] was being questioned and everything else
[31:28] and and then he said to this man, he
[31:30] said, "You whited wall
[31:33] &gt;&gt; when they smoked him
[31:35] &gt;&gt; and then and then they said, "Don't you
[31:38] respect the high priest?" And he he
[31:40] apologized said, "I didn't know that
[31:43] this was the high priest." See, but
[31:46] nevertheless, he didn't take back
[31:48] necessarily what he said. But he should
[31:50] not have said what he did to that
[31:53] particular office because you got the
[31:55] man and he was a whited wall.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; But then you got the office and he was
[31:59] in the while he was in the office, he he
[32:02] deserved more respect than that. And so
[32:04] now let's just reduce it down to you and
[32:06] I that are here tonight. When you become
[32:10] when you become a son or a daughter
[32:13] within a certain family at the human
[32:15] level in the human community, you have
[32:17] certain rights that belong to you. Your
[32:20] your parents even your parents or your
[32:23] employer is not to abuse you. You have
[32:26] certain rights. You have rights of
[32:28] freedom. You have rights of protection.
[32:30] You have certain rights. Those are your
[32:32] rights as a as a human. Now when you
[32:34] become a son or daughter of God, you
[32:37] have certain rights which I'm going to
[32:39] come to later on and you can make a
[32:41] certain claim according to those rights.
[32:44] And we have when uh when when when Satan
[32:48] came to Jesus in what is called the
[32:50] great temptation, he did not say he did
[32:53] not say ah there's no son of God. What a
[32:57] this is a lot of nonsense. A son of God
[33:00] who ever thought that God would have a
[33:02] son. He he didn't say that. He said if
[33:05] thou be the son of God.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; So he was questioning his sunship or his
[33:12] office.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; If you're the son of God, then do these
[33:17] things.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Turn turn, you know, turn make these
[33:20] stones into bread, etc. If you're the
[33:22] son of God, you have to realize that,
[33:26] and this is extremely important, you
[33:28] have to realize that God has endowed the
[33:33] offices with a a certain privilege and a
[33:36] certain authority. When you go in prayer
[33:40] to pray
[33:42] and you're coming against the powers of
[33:44] darkness, you need to know where you
[33:46] stand.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are. You need
[33:49] to be able to say, "Satan, I'm a son of
[33:52] God."
[33:54] &gt;&gt; I come in that position. I have that
[33:57] post. I have that position.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know. You remember when when
[34:01] when brother Ron Spencer gave part of
[34:04] his testimony how he fell out of that
[34:06] building, fell onto the concrete, broke
[34:08] the bones in his body, was completely
[34:11] shattered, rushed him into the hospital,
[34:14] and then called for his father.
[34:16] Incidentally, you'll be seeing brother
[34:17] Charlie Spencer and his wife, Ron's
[34:20] father and mother are coming to the camp
[34:22] this year. They're going to be here
[34:23] also. Sister Connie, her mother and
[34:25] father are coming. I mean, there's four
[34:27] people that are real warriors of God.
[34:29] And brother, brother Charlie Spencer, I
[34:32] love that man. And you'll see when he
[34:33] comes here why I do. I've known him
[34:35] since 1978. Yet, I've never preached in
[34:38] his church. He's never preached here.
[34:40] But we just have such a bond and such a
[34:42] oneness. I just love his spirit. and he
[34:44] came into the hospital and you know
[34:46] doctors today are very very very open
[34:50] they don't want to give any false hopes
[34:51] and when when brother Charlie Spencer
[34:53] came in and the doctor said to him he
[34:56] said I want you to know Mr. Spencer,
[34:58] your son will never walk again.
[35:01] And brother Charlie Spencer said, "Sir,
[35:05] you just don't know who you're talking
[35:06] to."
[35:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am a son of God."
[35:11] &gt;&gt; And he walks into his into his son's
[35:14] bed. And and Brother Ron said he'll
[35:17] never forget the words that his father
[35:19] spoke to him, but they were similar. And
[35:21] he said, "Son," he said, "I'm a son of
[35:24] God and you're going to walk out of this
[35:27] place."
[35:28] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened in not
[35:30] very many days hence. I say, "Glory be
[35:33] to God."
[35:34] &gt;&gt; It's it's absolutely critical that we
[35:36] know who we are.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; That would not not just, you know, to to
[35:40] make some empty confession, but to know
[35:42] exactly who we are in God and be able to
[35:46] exercise that authority. Brother
[35:48] Brandham said, "Of all the wonderful
[35:49] gifts that Jesus had, he never used any
[35:53] of them in defeating Satan, he always
[35:56] used something that you and I have full
[35:58] access to, and that's the word." Every
[36:01] time he just said, "Thus sayaith the
[36:03] word."
[36:04] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[36:10] &gt;&gt; All right. And so they with we have
[36:12] these certain offices in place
[36:15] and they operate whether you're aware of
[36:17] it or not.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; They have a scheme here in Canada. It's
[36:23] called a Canada pension plan.
[36:27] I'm smiling because it it works for some
[36:29] people, not so well for others. But
[36:31] anyway, we have a Canada pension plan.
[36:34] It it might buy gas for your car, but
[36:37] that's about it in Canada. Isn't that
[36:39] right, brother Paul?
[36:41] You have to excuse me. I'm going to
[36:42] enjoy this evening.
[36:45] I don't know how it is. You have your
[36:47] 401k down in this down in the States.
[36:49] And let's hope it's going this way
[36:51] instead of this way. But anyway,
[36:53] everybody is is planning for the
[36:55] retirement.
[36:57] I'm going to be coming from left field
[36:59] quite a few times tonight.
[37:01] Uh, and and while you're sitting right
[37:03] here, I don't think anybody here, at
[37:05] least I hope not, has been sitting here
[37:07] this evening thought, "Oh, my
[37:08] retirement. I sure hope I sure hope it's
[37:10] working for me. I hope the Department of
[37:12] Finance is doing their best for me.
[37:16] Don't count on it.
[37:18] But there is a department that's working
[37:19] there. Even though while you're sitting
[37:21] here, you're not aware of it,
[37:23] &gt;&gt; but it's supposed to be there working
[37:24] for you." Why? Because the government,
[37:27] not the government we're talking about,
[37:29] but the government is in place and
[37:31] they've got a department of finance. And
[37:33] part of that department, they've got an
[37:35] administration there that's supposed to
[37:37] be looking after your retirement.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; And let's hope it works. Do you know
[37:41] something? I tell you what, the office
[37:43] of MelzDC
[37:46] &gt;&gt; is the best retirement program.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; And you may not be aware of it tonight,
[37:51] but that was what has been instituted.
[37:53] And that is why brother Brandham in the
[37:55] end time had to speak about Melzdc
[37:58] because he was without beginning of days
[38:01] nor end of life.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; And that's your retirement. And you may
[38:05] not even be conscious of it tonight, but
[38:07] God has already put your retirement in
[38:11] place.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; And your retirement isn't to retire in a
[38:15] hole six feet deep.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Your retirement is one. Your retirement
[38:20] stands in the promise of God. Because I
[38:23] live,
[38:24] &gt;&gt; you shall live also.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; That's our retirement program. Thank
[38:28] God.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; It doesn't depend on some program that
[38:32] this government has. We got another
[38:34] government. We're from another kingdom.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And so these things are in place.
[38:42] And then then to become effective at a
[38:44] certain time,
[38:46] these offices have been established. I
[38:49] need to say all of these things as as we
[38:51] we move along. These offices have been
[38:54] established for specific functions
[38:57] and
[38:58] certain positions
[39:00] and under certain they have a certain
[39:04] function in a certain under a certain
[39:06] jurisdiction.
[39:07] Now
[39:10] uh I I just want to read a few notes
[39:12] that I have here which I have put down.
[39:15] Governments
[39:16] are a collection or a conglomerate of
[39:19] offices established or set up to
[39:23] administer the various functions of
[39:25] government.
[39:28] You can't take the department of
[39:30] immigration or a problem of immigration
[39:33] to the department of finance.
[39:35] You can't take a concern of legal
[39:37] matters involving the justice system to
[39:40] the department of highways. You said,
[39:42] "Well, I said that this morning. I need
[39:44] to say it again. Each have their
[39:47] specific realm of responsibility
[39:50] and authority to discharge their
[39:53] required duties.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Yet all of these offices represent one
[39:59] government.
[40:01] all of the offices that God has
[40:04] established from a son of God, a
[40:07] daughter of God to the offices in the
[40:09] ministry, five-fold ministry to those
[40:12] ministries of helps which are also in
[40:15] the written in the in the Bible to those
[40:18] those were women that ministered to the
[40:20] Apostle Paul and ministered to Jesus
[40:23] Christ. All of those offices and
[40:27] ministries have a certain and a specific
[40:30] they have a specific uh position and
[40:33] place that God has given them and they
[40:37] all represent one government or one
[40:39] kingdom,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; one God,
[40:42] &gt;&gt; even though there are many of them and
[40:44] there are many that men have made to
[40:47] almost like replicate what God has,
[40:51] &gt;&gt; but they're they're man-made. It doesn't
[40:54] speak of popes and it doesn't speak of
[40:56] cardinals and doesn't speak of overseers
[40:59] and a lot of these things which which
[41:02] man has made because he has elevated
[41:05] people into certain positions by his
[41:08] program. God has a program and that
[41:10] program is that God raises a person up
[41:14] in their season in their at their time.
[41:18] He endows them with a certain talent or
[41:20] ability or gift. And now it's not
[41:22] everyone who's gifted is necessarily
[41:24] called, but he backs that up with a with
[41:28] a a something that's divine. It becomes
[41:31] evident that this is a supernatural
[41:34] thing that God is doing in this life.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Now I want to speak on his government.
[41:43] Says his government
[41:47] &gt;&gt; and that's what the Bible speaks of. His
[41:49] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[41:52] The offices and the administration of
[41:55] his government.
[41:56] Now, God has ordained certain men for
[42:01] specific responsibilities. If this
[42:02] sounds like I'm repeating, I am, but I
[42:04] want to just enlarge it a wee bit. And
[42:08] he has given them the authority to carry
[42:11] out their duties. I don't believe even
[42:14] as Moses we'll just refer to Moses I'll
[42:17] refer to Abraham refer to the apostle
[42:19] Paul I'll refer to brother Brandham and
[42:22] I believe that that will be sufficient
[42:24] but when Moses even raised his objection
[42:27] to God he's slow of speech he can't
[42:30] really deal with you know this and the
[42:33] people won't believe me God didn't
[42:36] change his mind even though he was
[42:39] raising up objection that he would not
[42:41] be be able to discharge this enormous
[42:44] responsibility of of taking this whole
[42:47] host of people out from under a
[42:50] superpower and deliver them to a
[42:52] promised land. He just felt he could not
[42:55] do that. And one was that he was slow of
[42:58] speech. And God did not change his mind.
[43:01] He said, "Well, go and talk to your
[43:02] brother because he can speak and have
[43:05] Aaron do it." God didn't change his
[43:08] mind. And here we are hundreds and
[43:12] hundreds of years later
[43:16] and the man Moses, what he spoke remains
[43:20] absolutely steadfast today.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; If Moses was thinking for a moment,
[43:29] you've got to lead this people out. But
[43:32] God wasn't really telling him, Moses,
[43:35] I'm going to send a word through you,
[43:37] and that word is going to be imposed
[43:39] upon
[43:41] billions of people,
[43:45] not millions, not hundreds of millions,
[43:47] but billions of people down through the
[43:49] centuries are going to read your words
[43:53] &gt;&gt; and are going to be true then. And when
[43:55] Moses said and Moses had to say because
[43:58] it was it was truth at that time. Moses
[44:01] was the meakest man in all the earth.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And that word still holds true today
[44:07] because the word of God can't. Are you
[44:09] following me?
[44:13] One man, Abraham, would be the father of
[44:16] the faith for both a natural seed and a
[44:20] spiritual seed until a until a messenger
[44:24] in in our time would speak about
[44:26] faithful Abraham, the royal seed of
[44:29] Abraham. Why? Because it still stands
[44:32] true. And Abraham wasn't just of his
[44:35] family, not just those that came out at
[44:38] at his time, those that he saw and and
[44:41] those that he became a part of, but
[44:43] Abraham, what I'm I'm bearing out to you
[44:46] now is is once God selects a person and
[44:50] and sets them out to do a a certain task
[44:54] to fulfill in their life, it's
[44:56] impossible for you and I to ascertain or
[45:00] to try to determine what the effect of
[45:03] our life is going to be in the whole
[45:05] scope of eternity. How are we ever going
[45:08] to know that?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; You think that God can't keep track not
[45:12] from not only from Abraham to Isaac to
[45:15] Jacob to Joseph and on the way down the
[45:18] patriarchs and come on on down. You
[45:21] think that God who knows every flea and
[45:24] every how many times it bats his eye and
[45:27] how much tallow it makes. That kind of a
[45:30] God can take the effect of your life and
[45:33] trace it down for hundreds of years and
[45:36] centuries of years and keep an accurate
[45:38] account of it and give you a reward for
[45:40] it on the other side.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, by the time it ripples
[45:47] on down, it's going to be just an
[45:48] absolute minute uh a minute amount of of
[45:53] effect. How do I know? You know, that's
[45:55] none of our business." God keeps the
[45:57] books. Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the Bible that I believe
[46:01] in.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; One man, Abraham.
[46:13] One man, the Apostle Paul.
[46:16] And talk about knowing where a person
[46:18] stands.
[46:20] Uh
[46:21] here's what Apostle Paul said of
[46:24] himself.
[46:26] For I speak to you Gentiles in as much
[46:30] as I am the apostle of the Gentiles. I
[46:35] magnify mine office.
[46:39] He had to indeed know who he was. You
[46:41] know, Satan is such a a deceitful
[46:44] person. He gets us as believers even to
[46:47] cower at our position.
[46:51] I would love to see a church rise up
[46:54] &gt;&gt; that knew exactly who they were
[46:57] &gt;&gt; and would not cower at it what at any
[47:00] time any time of the day or before any
[47:03] person. I am a son of the living God.
[47:07] I'm a daughter of God. You girls in
[47:09] school should be able to throw your
[47:11] shoulders back and be proud. I would
[47:13] tell my girls when they were in high
[47:14] school, listen, they may say snide
[47:17] remarks about you while you're in
[47:18] school. They go home and wish they could
[47:20] live like you.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And we as
[47:27] believers of this message, one thing
[47:29] that we certainly do not want to be, we
[47:31] don't want to cower or for a moment be
[47:33] ashamed. And that's not a false pride.
[47:35] It's not that. It is a it is a a such a
[47:39] an overwhelming joy
[47:42] &gt;&gt; that God has called us into this kind of
[47:44] a life into this kind of a calling into
[47:47] this kind of a kingdom.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he hasn't only called you into
[47:52] it. He has anointed you not for some
[47:54] past generation but for this generation.
[47:57] There's not a reason there's not an
[47:58] excuse for anybody to say well I I I
[48:01] feel weak or I don't have. You may feel
[48:03] weak, but I can assure you if you are a
[48:06] child of God and God has called you to
[48:08] this season, to this time, he's equipped
[48:10] you.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; To overcome, to withstand anything that
[48:17] will come your way in this generation.
[48:19] He didn't leave you weakened.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; He's given us exactly what we have need
[48:26] of. And for the Apostle Paul to be able
[48:28] to say, and it doesn't say that
[48:30] everybody roared, "Amen." And all the
[48:32] Gentiles said, "Yay and amen." He said
[48:35] it because he knew it. And even they
[48:37] were opposed to it. That didn't change
[48:39] it.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham said
[48:42] many, many times, you believe me to be
[48:44] God's prophet. He had to know he was
[48:46] God's prophet. Because even the even the
[48:49] angel said, if you get the people to
[48:50] believe, not believe in God or do you
[48:53] believe that Christ was born or do you
[48:55] believe in in Easter time? Do you
[48:57] believe in the resurrection? That wasn't
[48:59] what had to have him believe that he had
[49:01] been sent by God as God's prophet to
[49:03] this age.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And when they believed that on him whom
[49:08] he had sent,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; then they could they were he said it
[49:11] depends on where you this where you
[49:13] think this come from.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Said if you believe it's of God,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; If you believe it's of Satan, then
[49:21] that's the reward will come from.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; So the administration now of the high
[49:29] priest. Let's just talk about the high
[49:30] priest for a few moments. Now you can
[49:34] turn if you would in your Bible to
[49:35] Hebrews the 5th chapter.
[49:41] So we're talking now about the
[49:43] administration these various offices
[49:46] and I can only speak of a few. All
[49:49] right. In Hebrews 5:1
[49:51] for how many high priests? For every
[49:55] high priest taken from among men is
[49:59] ordained for who?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; It's ordained for men. So a high priest
[50:05] is ordained for men in things pertaining
[50:08] to who?
[50:10] &gt;&gt; God. So now you get the picture very
[50:13] clear. A high priest, he has a he's has
[50:16] an office. He has a p position. He has a
[50:20] certain jurisdiction. He's acting on
[50:23] behalf of God for men.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That he may offer, here's his work, that
[50:31] he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
[50:36] for sins.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That's what a high priest's office
[50:40] position is. This is his jurisdiction.
[50:43] This is something that God has ordained
[50:46] a high priest. Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Now,
[50:51] what if a person hasn't got a high
[50:52] priest?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; What if they haven't got a high priest?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; What if God designated
[51:00] uh do you think that Aaron was the only
[51:02] high priest? In fact, is today I can
[51:05] tell you
[51:07] over in over in Asia, they've got high
[51:09] priests
[51:11] in Tibet that you hear so much about the
[51:13] monks and so on and the priests, they've
[51:15] got their high priests. We were in India
[51:18] and they had not only high priests but
[51:19] they had high priestesses, women and
[51:22] that one that wanted us to kneel in
[51:24] front of this fellow. There's all kinds
[51:26] of high priests.
[51:28] All kinds of priests.
[51:30] But they will not be they are not given
[51:35] a position by almighty God to offer
[51:38] gifts and sacrifices on behalf of the
[51:41] people. Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; And the people may give themselves, they
[51:44] may give their money, may give all their
[51:46] time, they may walk for miles such as
[51:48] they do in many places. And they offer
[51:50] they offer animals and I've stood in
[51:52] front of the doors in Nepal where the
[51:55] blood of goats was over the door exactly
[51:58] like in the in the book of Exodus. I I
[52:00] looked right through the little door and
[52:02] here's a it's all red from the goats.
[52:04] Animals have given their life absolutely
[52:07] empty in vain.
[52:09] It's only uh it's only uh uh trying to
[52:14] repeat or duplicate what is in the
[52:17] Bible.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; So, we're not the only people that have
[52:19] a high priest. And here here we have uh
[52:24] the whole church world that read and
[52:26] they believe in a high priest and read
[52:28] the scripture. Who did she touch? Uh you
[52:30] know, we have we have a high priest
[52:32] that's touched with the infirmity of our
[52:35] feeling. It's touched with the feeling
[52:36] of our infirmity. We have that but then
[52:39] it becomes evident that somehow the
[52:42] sacrifice is not res received.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:49] All right.
[52:50] I just leave you thinking about that.
[52:56] Every high priest taken from among men
[52:58] is ordained for men in things pertaining
[53:01] to God that he may offer both gifts and
[53:04] sacrifices for sin. Now, I'd like you to
[53:07] notice, please, that it's all Christ's
[53:10] doing. Whether it's a priest office, a
[53:13] king's office, a pastor's office, a a uh
[53:18] evangelist, teacher, whatever, a
[53:20] deacon's office. It's it's it's all
[53:23] Christ doing. It's God doing. It's like
[53:26] one government.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; You have the finance and you have the
[53:29] justice department. You have the
[53:31] highways and you have the you have the
[53:33] lands and forests and you have the parks
[53:35] and you have all of these. You have the
[53:37] immigration whatever more all different
[53:39] very diverse very specific very
[53:42] controlled
[53:44] &gt;&gt; but one government over it all and the
[53:47] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; He has a government friend. I want to
[53:53] rise this up above just a sermon. I want
[53:55] to rise up to a doctrine position. This
[53:58] is a doctrine of the Bible. This is his
[54:01] government. He has a government. And we
[54:03] talk about brother Brandham. Let me tell
[54:05] you, let me tell you my position about
[54:07] brother Brandham right now in the
[54:09] context of this service. That was part
[54:11] of the government of the kingdom.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; That's part of the government.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; A very very uh uh uh shall I say a a a
[54:22] very much empowered a very senior post
[54:25] &gt;&gt; in the government. the senior position
[54:28] in an entire generation, one messenger
[54:31] to this age.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; And that's where people dig in their
[54:35] heels. But those that are receiving it,
[54:37] they receive it with joy.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we come under the
[54:42] benefits.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; There's benefits. And there's benefits
[54:45] that flow to us. Even when you're
[54:47] sleeping and you know nothing about it,
[54:49] there's benefits.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of you young people that
[54:52] are brought up in homes where your
[54:53] mother and father and as long as you
[54:55] keep the order of the home where you
[54:57] love your father and your mother and you
[54:59] honor your father and your mother and
[55:01] you respect the God of your father and
[55:03] your mother. Do you know that you fall
[55:05] under those benefits even though you may
[55:08] not be aware of it? You fall under those
[55:10] blessings.
[55:13] We're sitting here right today, this
[55:15] evening, in this whole in this country,
[55:18] in America here and in Canada. We we we
[55:20] we just have all kinds of blessings and
[55:23] benefits that come here. We have the
[55:25] police to protect us and we got a fire
[55:27] department that'll run to us. And we got
[55:29] an ambulance service that go and get you
[55:31] and and we got hospitals that go and
[55:33] treat you. And all of these things, all
[55:35] of these benefits, you don't even
[55:36] realize it till you need it. And then
[55:38] you run and you find out it's all there
[55:40] and it's in place and much of it is paid
[55:43] for
[55:45] &gt;&gt; their benefits part of the government.
[55:47] Well, who paid for the police? And who
[55:48] paid for the fire department? Who paid
[55:50] for all of this? Well, the whole people
[55:53] and the whole public and out of their
[55:55] tax uh uh tax monies have paid for it.
[55:58] But I'm glad that we got it paid for.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that we have it today.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Two Sundays ago, you may not know it. I
[56:06] I don't think I showed it when I got
[56:08] here to preach, but I got here to the
[56:10] pulpit. I just arrived to the pulpit and
[56:12] I just got a call just as I was coming
[56:14] to the pulpit that the fire department
[56:16] was on their way to my home.
[56:20] Now you're quiet.
[56:22] He said, "What did you do?" I came here
[56:25] and I said, "I I for a few moments I had
[56:28] I didn't know maybe my home's in a total
[56:30] blaze.
[56:33] I came here to the pulpit before I came
[56:35] in this door. I said, "God, I was called
[56:38] here to preach. I'm going to forget if
[56:40] that thing goes to ashes. So be it. I'm
[56:43] coming here to preach your word.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going to happen." So
[56:47] instead of my home going down to ashes,
[56:50] I got a $90 invoice for a false call. So
[56:54] I was happy to pay it.
[57:00] But somebody paid I tell you what, they
[57:02] couldn't send that whole fire department
[57:03] and the police and everything else for
[57:04] $90. That's a bargain.
[57:08] Don't you think so?
[57:11] I tell you have those kind of people,
[57:12] you know, all equipped and everything
[57:14] else right there with ladders and
[57:16] everything and several men and several
[57:17] police and all the rest of it. I tell
[57:19] you what, any time of the day, I'll pay
[57:21] that. $90, Brother Toby. It's good
[57:25] country.
[57:32] It's all working even while we don't
[57:33] know it.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; We're sitting here. We got these
[57:35] benefits.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:47] Now,
[57:48] uh
[57:52] so I say it was all Christ doing. It's
[57:54] just different people and different
[57:57] gifts at different times. Now, in Luke
[58:00] 16:16, I'll just read it because it's
[58:02] just one verse.
[58:04] For the law, Jesus said, "The law and
[58:06] the prophets were until John
[58:10] since that time the kingdom of God is
[58:14] preached and everyone pressth into it."
[58:17] &gt;&gt; That's a very revealing in the context
[58:19] of what I'm speaking. says the law and
[58:22] the prophets were until John. But now
[58:25] the gospel is preached. And the Bible
[58:28] says Jesus began to preach. The Bible
[58:30] says John began to preach. You don't
[58:33] find that terminology in the Old
[58:35] Testament.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; It's New Testament terminology. Not
[58:39] because not because they were afraid of
[58:41] those words. It didn't fit the call in
[58:44] the Old Testament. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You have the burden of the word of the
[58:47] Lord that came and to this prophet or
[58:49] that prophet and they spoke they spoke
[58:52] as as prophets of God and that was how
[58:55] that was the order that God had put in
[58:58] place back there. But now you have and
[59:00] John began to preach. It's it's a it
[59:04] it's it's a different you can see that
[59:05] there's a whole different uh aspect of
[59:09] the same gospel
[59:13] and the law and the prophets where until
[59:15] John I wished I had this up on the I
[59:18] didn't have enough time to prepare this
[59:20] in slides. I would like you to have be
[59:22] able to read it with me visually. For
[59:25] the law and the prophets were until
[59:26] John. Notice the word since
[59:30] that time
[59:32] something's changed. The kingdom of God
[59:35] is preached. So the kingdom of God was
[59:38] not preached in this manner prior to
[59:40] that. Not in the Old Testament the way
[59:42] it's now being preached and every man
[59:45] pressth into it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us, and I'm moving along
[59:49] as quickly as possible because I have
[59:50] quite a ways to go. The Bible tells us
[59:53] about Peter being the one being the one
[59:58] given the keys to the kingdom. And now
[1:00:02] he uses the key. And the day of
[1:00:04] Pentecost, as I said this morning when I
[1:00:05] was closing, Jesus said to the uh
[1:00:08] apostles, don't go and preach. Don't go
[1:00:12] until you're endued with power from on
[1:00:14] high. Go and tarry in Jerusalem until
[1:00:17] you be endued with power. Why? because
[1:00:20] God was going to empower them for this
[1:00:24] new function as it were to administrate
[1:00:27] the gospel of Jesus Christ and to
[1:00:30] demonstrate it in power. Don't go until
[1:00:33] this comes upon you. And the Bible says
[1:00:36] in in Acts the 2 chapter verse 38, we
[1:00:39] always go to that now. He says, "Then
[1:00:42] Peter
[1:00:44] said unto them, repent and be baptized,
[1:00:48] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[1:00:50] Christ, for the remission of sins, you
[1:00:53] shall receive and you shall receive the
[1:00:55] gift of the Holy Ghost." This is not a
[1:00:58] recipe for baptism.
[1:01:01] Peter in his office in his apostolic
[1:01:03] office is administrating he's he's
[1:01:06] administering the authority of his
[1:01:09] office and he's telling them under the
[1:01:12] authority of his office he's been endued
[1:01:14] now by the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:01:17] Spirit is punctuating the word through
[1:01:19] him repent
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:01:25] name of Jesus Christ and he's
[1:01:27] prophesying and you shall receive the
[1:01:30] gift of the Holy Holy Spirit. Many
[1:01:32] people perhaps have been to this tank
[1:01:33] but don't realize that you are under the
[1:01:36] jurisdiction of that office.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; That office is still effective today.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham, he
[1:01:44] couldn't even go any other place because
[1:01:46] he was a word prophet. Had to come right
[1:01:48] back to that. I want you to see it's not
[1:01:50] just a recipe for baptism.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. It's not just
[1:01:54] some nice words. Oh, repent and be
[1:01:56] baptized. Every one of you shall
[1:01:58] receive. This is some kind of formula.
[1:02:01] It's not that. This is something that
[1:02:03] has come from the kingdom of God.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; This didn't come from Washington DC.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have much confidence in it.
[1:02:13] It's not come from I'm not come from
[1:02:15] Ottawa. I'd have perhaps less confidence
[1:02:17] in it. You might say, "Well, I'm not
[1:02:19] being patriotic." I am patriotic to the
[1:02:22] kingdom that I'm a citizen of.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] I have far more far more confidence in
[1:02:28] that than I have in the constitution of
[1:02:30] this country because that one works.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; I find a lot of failures in this one.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; There's people that are trying and I and
[1:02:38] God bless them. God bless the leaders.
[1:02:40] God help them in in their to discharge
[1:02:42] their duties in in in a way that's
[1:02:45] honorable and with integrity. But on the
[1:02:47] other hand, I have a I have a
[1:02:49] constitution of the kingdom of God.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And that kingdom, it can never fail.
[1:02:54] Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That kingdom is in another
[1:02:57] realm.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; That kingdom is in the unseen realm.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And it has many diverse offices. And
[1:03:05] God, the author, the the leader, he has
[1:03:09] endowed these various offices with the
[1:03:12] authority to discharge their duties and
[1:03:15] make the thing happen. And I tell you
[1:03:16] what, if you can see that coming on
[1:03:18] down, you'll see yourself in a different
[1:03:20] light. You'll say, "I'm from that
[1:03:22] kingdom." You won't have to put a swatch
[1:03:24] on your on your on your shirt or on your
[1:03:26] jacket identifying you with a certain
[1:03:28] nation. You want to be able to say, "I'm
[1:03:30] from another kingdom. I come from
[1:03:32] another country. I'm not of this world."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; As Jesus said, you're of this world. I'm
[1:03:38] not of this world.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; You're from below. I'm from above.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Our leader said that.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Our Lord said that.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Is there any reason why you can't say
[1:03:48] that? I'm from above. I'm from another
[1:03:51] kingdom. Hallelujah. I'm from a kingdom
[1:03:54] with eternal life.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; I might look different because I am
[1:03:58] different. I sound different because I
[1:04:00] am different.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm from a different
[1:04:03] place.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I have I just so in and
[1:04:11] gripped and enthused with this.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] regarding this building that God has
[1:04:16] been doing.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And I said this morning that we are
[1:04:21] God's building
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; on two fronts. We are the building in
[1:04:26] that God is doing the work and we are
[1:04:28] the building because God owns it and
[1:04:30] dwells in it.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; We are God's building. And Apostle Paul
[1:04:34] said in 1 Corinthians 3:10, according to
[1:04:38] the grace of God
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; according or to the measure according to
[1:04:45] the grace of God number one that's been
[1:04:48] given to me.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Once you get in this channel,
[1:04:52] friends, once you get in this channel,
[1:04:55] you'll find it all through the
[1:04:56] scripture. Do you know why the scripture
[1:04:58] worked? Cuz those men believed in who
[1:05:01] they were. Those women believed in who
[1:05:03] they were and what God had called them
[1:05:05] to.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And the sooner that we wake up, the
[1:05:09] sooner that this becomes a part of us,
[1:05:12] it'll work different for you, too.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you find yourself
[1:05:16] stumbling along, then come to this kind
[1:05:18] of preaching right tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] You're children of the kingdom.
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:34] according to the grace of God which is
[1:05:36] given unto me as a wise master builder.
[1:05:41] I have laid the foundation and another
[1:05:44] buildeth thereon, but let every man take
[1:05:47] heed how he buildth thereupon. In the
[1:05:51] message trial, brother Brandham says,
[1:05:55] "Out of the skies come this cloud coming
[1:05:58] down speaking these words. As John the
[1:06:02] Baptist was commissioned to forerrun the
[1:06:05] first coming of Christ, your ministry
[1:06:08] will forrun the second coming of
[1:06:11] Christ."
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Is that any different?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Bible language.
[1:06:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; You hear the Apostle Paul, according to
[1:06:20] the grace of God that's given to me, I'm
[1:06:22] a wise master builder.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't have to cower and and
[1:06:30] and and say that in some weak manner.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that Brother Brandham didn't
[1:06:36] say it in some weak manner. Well, if God
[1:06:38] will hear me, that wasn't it.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; This is what God said.
[1:06:42] If I can get the people to believe,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; if I can get the people to believe,
[1:06:46] nothing will stand before my prayer.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Not even cancer.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; That's a message of our kingdom.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? That's a message of
[1:06:57] our kingdom.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; And it has come to the right office.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; It has come to the right person.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; It has come at the right time.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And it has come to the right people.
[1:07:13] We're the people
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; that was sent for us to hear.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; We talk about these lights and the
[1:07:20] phenomena and thing on Sunset Mountain
[1:07:23] and the word that came and the cloud and
[1:07:25] all these things. It's not just to have
[1:07:27] a picture of. That's to realize that God
[1:07:29] sent that. God showed that in the
[1:07:31] heavens for me,
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; for you
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; to let you know that this that this
[1:07:37] message came with an authorship
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; and it came with authority.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And it came it came from a department.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of the government,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; his government,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, not some corrupt government,
[1:07:52] a government of truth. Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; My wife has a wonderful She has a
[1:07:59] wonderful phrase. It's a kind of one of
[1:08:00] her pet phrases. She says it all the
[1:08:03] time. Said, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if
[1:08:06] everybody just had to wake up tomorrow
[1:08:08] morning and everybody had to say exactly
[1:08:10] the truth?"
[1:08:14] Everybody.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Could you imagine every
[1:08:19] politician in the world getting bound
[1:08:21] instantly by some power that would grip
[1:08:24] them that everybody had to say
[1:08:25] absolutely the truth?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; I've been asked once in a while,
[1:08:38] how does this look on me?
[1:08:41] Oh, it's hard to be truthful.
[1:08:44] Well, quite frankly, it looks terrible.
[1:08:47] No, it looks wonderful. It just looks
[1:08:49] great. You know,
[1:08:52] you go and see a salesperson. Do you
[1:08:54] ever see a salesperson come in and you
[1:08:57] try something on, they say, "Nah, you
[1:08:59] just look terrible in that." No, no.
[1:09:02] Says, "That looks great." Of course,
[1:09:04] they're getting a commission.
[1:09:11] and our religion, our gospel, it's not
[1:09:15] just a, you know, everything's fine,
[1:09:17] everything's fine. No, that's why
[1:09:20] brother Brandham had to say very harsh
[1:09:22] things.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know why it's truth
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; is truth.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; How we live, how we dress, how we speak,
[1:09:32] how we preach had to be truth.
[1:09:44] in the message uh taking sides with
[1:09:46] Jesus. Now I'm I'm dealing with this.
[1:09:48] Are you tired or can I carry on?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Now I I want to approach in just a few
[1:09:54] moments. Sometimes these offices
[1:09:57] uh you'll find one person fulfill two
[1:10:00] offices
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; and that that becomes dangerous
[1:10:04] especially in the in the natural world
[1:10:07] because
[1:10:09] uh I even read the the the state of
[1:10:11] North Carolina has has outlawed it.
[1:10:15] They've outlawed one official, elected
[1:10:18] official filling two offices because
[1:10:22] they're afraid of, you know, cross
[1:10:24] purposes and working with conflict of
[1:10:26] interest. And so they've outlawed it.
[1:10:30] Uh, at least that's what I pulled up and
[1:10:32] looked at. I know here in this province
[1:10:35] some years ago they the uh premier of
[1:10:40] the province took over the position of
[1:10:43] minister of finance as well and that was
[1:10:46] some bit they did that because there was
[1:10:48] a short period of time and for whatever
[1:10:52] reasons internally but and there was
[1:10:54] some some concern about that and it was
[1:10:56] in the newspapers that the premier
[1:10:58] should also be minister of finance and
[1:11:01] people were not very comfortable with
[1:11:03] that. And so some sometimes you have
[1:11:06] this, but God has on occasion
[1:11:11] had a dual office,
[1:11:14] but very very seldom do they have a dual
[1:11:17] office. So I want you to think about
[1:11:19] that now for a moment. Listen as I read
[1:11:22] in taking sides with Jesus.
[1:11:27] He says, 'I believe the Lord has used me
[1:11:30] in little special things to help maybe
[1:11:33] lay a foundation for a prophet that will
[1:11:35] come. But a prophet doesn't operate the
[1:11:38] way I operate. Now you know that a
[1:11:40] prophet isn't an evangelist. An
[1:11:42] evangelist isn't a prophet. A pastor
[1:11:44] isn't an evangelist. And an evangelist
[1:11:46] isn't a pastor. But God has set in the
[1:11:49] church, first apostles, then prophets,
[1:11:52] then teachers, and pastors, and so
[1:11:54] forth. God set them in the church. God
[1:11:57] gave them in office.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; But he says the morning when I laid the
[1:12:02] cornerstone
[1:12:04] now he said if you're spiritual you get
[1:12:06] it because of the cry of the people.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He said if you could break out of your
[1:12:12] take take the book and read it. It said
[1:12:15] do the work of an evangelist.
[1:12:19] Didn't call me to be an evangelist but
[1:12:22] said do the work of an evangelist.
[1:12:26] For the time will come. This is why he
[1:12:29] said do the work of an evangelist.
[1:12:31] Didn't call him an evangelist. Do the
[1:12:33] work of an evangelist. For the time, and
[1:12:35] this was the reason, for the time will
[1:12:37] come when they will not endure sound
[1:12:40] doctrine, but will heap to themselves uh
[1:12:44] teachers having itching ears and shall
[1:12:47] turn from the truth to fables. So in the
[1:12:50] great mind of God, he had a purpose in
[1:12:53] telling the messenger
[1:12:56] do the work of an evangelist. Now
[1:13:00] uh in this
[1:13:03] you just have to help me. I hope you're
[1:13:04] able to receive now. Okay. in this uh
[1:13:10] subject of of of a dual office
[1:13:14] uh
[1:13:16] when a when a a person comes to marriage
[1:13:19] now I don't want you to think of a
[1:13:20] wedding we have here as such but I want
[1:13:23] you to think of the marriage of the
[1:13:24] bride and the groom and I'll just use a
[1:13:27] natural one to compare with a with a
[1:13:29] spiritual one because the marriage of
[1:13:32] the bride of Jesus Christ is something
[1:13:36] that takes place prior to the marriage
[1:13:38] supper.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; We're all clear on that.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; All right. I personally believe that was
[1:13:44] brother Brandham's ministry to wed the
[1:13:47] bride to Christ. I may be going out on a
[1:13:50] limb. That's what I believe. I believe
[1:13:52] the message, the invisible union of the
[1:13:54] bride of Christ. That invisible union
[1:13:57] was a marriage ceremony.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And we're wed here. Yes, sir.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; If you expect we could go at any moment
[1:14:07] you're going to the marriage supper, you
[1:14:09] have to be wed before you go to the
[1:14:11] marriage supper.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And he says the wedding takes place
[1:14:14] here.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He also said that his ministry was to
[1:14:18] introduce the bride to Christ
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; and Christ is the word
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; and we have been introduced to the word.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; If you see it as a book, I feel sorry
[1:14:30] for you. If you see it just as a series
[1:14:32] of books or tapes or so on, I feel sorry
[1:14:34] to me. It's Christ.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; The word Christ has been restored.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; The word Christ has been revealed in the
[1:14:42] day when the son of man is revealed
[1:14:45] again. He was revealed
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; and there's a converging of the offices.
[1:14:50] Right now, now we'll just take a couple
[1:14:52] coming down the aisle here to be
[1:14:55] married.
[1:14:57] How do you do, sir?
[1:14:59] Are you a husband? No, I'm not a
[1:15:01] husband.
[1:15:03] What are you? I'm a bridegroom.
[1:15:06] Oh, all right. Are you a wife? No, I'm
[1:15:08] not a wife. What are you? I'm a I'm a
[1:15:11] bride.
[1:15:13] But if you just hang around a little
[1:15:14] while, I'll change offices.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And one is kind of almost overlapping
[1:15:23] into the other.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Say, "Okay, now here we go." And do you
[1:15:29] take this man to be your wed husband
[1:15:32] to live with him through thick and
[1:15:33] through thin? I'm I'm improvising now.
[1:15:39] Do you take her
[1:15:42] through all the trials of life? Do you
[1:15:44] take her? I do. Are you are are you
[1:15:48] husband yet? No, not yet. But just hang
[1:15:51] on. It's just overlapping.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm just leaving one and going into the
[1:15:55] other one. Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Are you a wife yet? No, I'm not a wife.
[1:16:02] But just just stay here. Stay alert.
[1:16:05] Just wait for a few minutes. And finally
[1:16:07] go through the vows and exchange the
[1:16:09] rings and Oh, it's getting real close.
[1:16:12] Have you changed office yet? No, not
[1:16:14] yet. But it's I I can feel it coming on.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. like they asked me to take
[1:16:23] that
[1:16:25] wedding and maybe told you about it.
[1:16:27] These are things I've experienced and
[1:16:28] I'll come back to this in a moment and
[1:16:30] take this wedding and brother Jeremiah
[1:16:33] said, "Uh, a couple here want you to
[1:16:35] marry them." I said, "No, no, no. I'm
[1:16:36] just here to preach." No, they want you
[1:16:38] to. So, anyway, they decide to have a
[1:16:40] wedding right after the morning service.
[1:16:42] And while I'm sitting on the platform,
[1:16:44] having got up to preach yet, he came
[1:16:45] over to me. He says, "There's another
[1:16:46] couple to be married."
[1:16:49] I said, "Well, what's their name?" name.
[1:16:51] He said, "I'll go and find out."
[1:16:55] And he couldn't find the first bride's
[1:16:57] name, too. He had to go and find out her
[1:16:58] name. Now he had to go and find out the
[1:17:00] second one's name. In the meantime, I
[1:17:02] got to do the I got to do the vows on
[1:17:06] the fly.
[1:17:08] Hey, and then I'm concerned because, you
[1:17:11] know, Brother Brandham even talks about
[1:17:13] the uh the morals that they have and the
[1:17:16] the kind of ceremony and their culture
[1:17:19] over there. head and shoulders above
[1:17:21] ours. And right away I'm thinking, you
[1:17:24] know, I'm gonna say I now, you know,
[1:17:29] pronounce you to be husband and wife in
[1:17:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:33] the congregation waits to click the
[1:17:34] cameras because that's when the groom
[1:17:36] kisses the bride.
[1:17:39] And I I was was I going to say that in a
[1:17:41] strange country?
[1:17:43] Oh, not on your life.
[1:17:46] So I I I I'm I'm waiting for them.
[1:17:48] They're singing. They're singing songs.
[1:17:50] Have you ever heard this before?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:17:54] And they're singing altar songs down at
[1:17:57] the cross where my savior died. And I'm
[1:18:00] trying to get into wedding spirit, you
[1:18:02] know. And they're singing, you know, all
[1:18:05] these alder songs. I surrender all. Of
[1:18:08] course, that was just going to happen in
[1:18:10] a few minutes, too.
[1:18:13] [Laughter]
[1:18:17] And nothing's happening. and the and the
[1:18:19] and the big table that I preached on is
[1:18:21] sitting there and some chairs up behind
[1:18:23] it and I I'm waiting for somebody to
[1:18:25] rearrange this thing and about 400
[1:18:28] people 450 people there and so I said to
[1:18:30] the brother sitting beside me he's from
[1:18:32] Malawi and I said to him is somebody
[1:18:35] going to you know uh fix things up here
[1:18:38] oh he rolled his eyes you know he says
[1:18:40] oh brother Bisclly said if anything's
[1:18:42] going to happen I think you're going to
[1:18:44] have to do it so so while they're
[1:18:46] singing alder calls I'm moving the table
[1:18:48] out of the way and getting the chairs
[1:18:51] all arranged
[1:18:54] and trying to remember the vows at the
[1:18:56] same time. And I want to say a little
[1:18:58] few words of instruction to the people.
[1:19:00] And there's a big old theater and big
[1:19:02] curtains behind me, big velvet curtains
[1:19:04] about back where brother John is. And
[1:19:06] and I see strangers coming in. And then
[1:19:09] I see the people of the church, you
[1:19:11] know, moving out of the seats here. And
[1:19:12] I thought, "Oh, wow." You know, there's
[1:19:15] friends coming. There's family coming.
[1:19:17] And uh I thought I better go and have a
[1:19:20] look. We've been about half an hour. I
[1:19:22] better go and have a look. So I go and
[1:19:23] part these great big curtains and here's
[1:19:27] all these two couples all lined up and
[1:19:30] these girls are in beautiful white gowns
[1:19:33] and the men are in tuxedos with white
[1:19:35] gloves on. I thought, "Oh,
[1:19:38] this is not what I expected. These guys
[1:19:41] are dressed to the nines." The only
[1:19:43] thing they didn't have on was spats.
[1:19:48] And so I decide I better go back there
[1:19:50] because I've got to clear this thing up.
[1:19:52] I don't want to get myself in some
[1:19:54] terrible situation. So I go to this
[1:19:56] brother. I've never seen him. His name's
[1:19:58] Brother Daniel.
[1:20:00] I said, "Brother Daniel,"
[1:20:02] I said, "Your culture is completely
[1:20:04] different than ours. In our country,
[1:20:08] when I pronounce a man and his bride to
[1:20:10] be husband and wife in the name of the
[1:20:12] Lord Jesus Christ in our country, the
[1:20:15] groom takes and he embraces and kisses
[1:20:17] the bride. Do you do that in this
[1:20:20] country? And his eyes went about this
[1:20:22] big around.
[1:20:24] And he just rolled his eyes. He says,
[1:20:26] "No, but it's coming.
[1:20:29] [Applause]
[1:20:33] it was coming, but I just didn't know
[1:20:35] how close it was.
[1:20:37] And so when I pronounced him to be
[1:20:39] husband and wife in the name of the Lord
[1:20:40] Jesus Christ, he was just exactly like a
[1:20:42] robot. He just went and put his arms up
[1:20:44] like this, turned around, put them
[1:20:46] around her, and give her a jerk. And
[1:20:47] that was all there was to it.
[1:20:54] Now, it didn't depend on the kiss. It
[1:20:56] didn't depend on what he did. But at
[1:20:59] that moment,
[1:21:01] she transferred
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; from bride to wife
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and he transferred from groom to husband
[1:21:09] and their offices. They walked up in one
[1:21:12] office and walked out in another.
[1:21:15] Furthermore, they walked up under one
[1:21:18] spiritual jurisdiction.
[1:21:20] There are certain laws and certain
[1:21:23] things that are spoken of how a young
[1:21:26] man and a young woman should court one
[1:21:28] another and they're completely another
[1:21:30] set of laws on husband and wife.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And the and the rules and the the whole
[1:21:37] everything changes and they walk out
[1:21:39] under completely different office.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Have I made my point? Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, there'll be an
[1:21:46] an office that will be instituted just
[1:21:49] for a season. And when the season is
[1:21:51] over, it's all done.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And on other hand, as it is with a high
[1:21:55] priest, it goes on and on and on and one
[1:21:59] dies and on comes another and on comes
[1:22:01] another.
[1:22:03] But it is it is so structured in the
[1:22:06] Bible. And I hope I hope that you can
[1:22:08] stay with me. Are you following me? All
[1:22:09] right.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:12] this dual office.
[1:22:15] And the Bible says, take your Bible if
[1:22:18] you would and uh turn to uh
[1:22:22] Hebrews the 7th chapter.
[1:22:33] And if I get this through then I'll I'll
[1:22:35] feel that I have uh accomplished what I
[1:22:38] really want to do.
[1:22:41] Now, you have to have to understand, you
[1:22:44] know why it's hard here? Because I'm on
[1:22:46] page four and my last page is page 20.
[1:22:53] I won't keep you.
[1:22:58] For this high priest, for this MelzDC,
[1:23:01] verse one of chapter 7, for this Melzdc,
[1:23:06] king of Salem,
[1:23:09] priest of the most high God, who met
[1:23:12] Abraham, returning from the slaughter of
[1:23:15] the kings, and blessed him. Now, brother
[1:23:19] Brandham calls Abraham God's prophet.
[1:23:21] God calls Abraham his prophet. When IMC
[1:23:24] was going to take his wife, even God
[1:23:27] spoke to him and said, "You have Abraham
[1:23:30] pray for you because he's my prophet."
[1:23:32] So, you have an office of a prophet.
[1:23:35] You have the office of a king and you
[1:23:38] have the office of a priest and all of
[1:23:41] those. And God comes to uh his prophet
[1:23:46] on earth.
[1:23:48] Now, stay with me real close. Now, God
[1:23:51] comes in a theophony form. And a
[1:23:55] theophony, I have all the quotes here,
[1:23:58] is something that could appear and
[1:24:01] disappear.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; It's from another realm.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Can appear and disappear.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; They are here right now and you're not
[1:24:10] aware of it. Your theophony body is
[1:24:13] right one breath away from you, but
[1:24:15] you're not conscious of it. Maybe you
[1:24:17] are now that I mentioned it. And that
[1:24:19] the message has said so and the apostle
[1:24:22] Paul has said so. If this body be if
[1:24:24] this tabernacle be dissolved, we have
[1:24:26] another Aeonian eternal in the heavens.
[1:24:29] You believe that?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we have that, right? But
[1:24:32] you're not conscious. You can't feel it,
[1:24:34] but it is here.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Now, you are here in the physical realm
[1:24:38] under certain jurisdiction. You're
[1:24:41] controlled by the laws of the land and
[1:24:43] and the laws of humanity and the laws of
[1:24:46] human rights and all of these things.
[1:24:48] But in that realm, don't think just
[1:24:49] because you can't see it that it doesn't
[1:24:51] exist, that it doesn't. They are under a
[1:24:54] certain mandate.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And the authority comes from that
[1:24:57] kingdom
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; and it is effective whether you
[1:25:00] recognize it or not.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Just like you don't know what's
[1:25:04] happening with your retirement. Well,
[1:25:05] it's just there someplace. No. And the
[1:25:08] kingdom of God, it's not just some uh,
[1:25:10] you know, nebulous thing that's out
[1:25:12] there. It's a reality. Even though you
[1:25:14] can't see it, it's real
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; and it is it has an authority that goes
[1:25:20] with it. And so now Melzdc, please just
[1:25:23] stay with us. This is very very close to
[1:25:25] my heart. So now God in the form of
[1:25:30] Melzdc
[1:25:32] comes as king of Salem, king of peace
[1:25:38] and priest of the most high God.
[1:25:41] and he meets Abraham coming, this is
[1:25:45] strange, coming from the slaughter of
[1:25:48] the kings.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; So those those are the main factors in
[1:25:56] this. And now you have a dual office and
[1:25:59] you can't find that
[1:26:02] in the scripture. You won't find it
[1:26:04] while Jesus was here. It was very very
[1:26:07] specific. He was the son of man and he
[1:26:11] was prophet and when they when they
[1:26:13] tried to make him king as I said this
[1:26:15] morning he we he refused that because
[1:26:18] that was not his office and even brother
[1:26:21] Brandham makes a very strong point when
[1:26:23] the woman who was a Samaritan woman now
[1:26:26] because this is an important part of
[1:26:28] this she she didn't have any claim on
[1:26:30] him when a when a Jew when the blind man
[1:26:34] said Jesus thou son of David have mercy
[1:26:37] on on us. He responded to them because
[1:26:40] they had a claim on him as a son of
[1:26:43] David.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But the Samaritan woman did not have a
[1:26:47] claim on him as son of David. And she
[1:26:49] cried, "Thou son of David, thou son of
[1:26:52] David." And Jesus didn't even as much as
[1:26:54] respond to her.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And the disciples were saying, "Keep her
[1:26:59] quiet. Do something with this woman.
[1:27:02] She's disturbing the meeting." And
[1:27:03] finally in her desperation said, "Lord,"
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; and he turned right around.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; That's how critical it is one office
[1:27:13] from another. She had a claim on him as
[1:27:16] Lord, but not as son of David
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; because to her he was not son of David.
[1:27:21] And yet and yet within a certain uh
[1:27:24] within a certain confine because then
[1:27:26] when the Hebrews when the Jews tried to
[1:27:29] make him and put him officially into the
[1:27:31] office of king, he turned it down. He
[1:27:35] went and hid himself and escaped from
[1:27:37] them because it was not the season for
[1:27:40] his kingship.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Now we come because there are things
[1:27:47] that had to take place.
[1:27:49] The things that had to take place is the
[1:27:52] gentile era.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; The gentile period had to come. The Jews
[1:27:57] had to reject him and crucify him and
[1:28:00] then he would turn to the Gentiles.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And he would come in another office to
[1:28:04] the Gentiles. He never came as son of
[1:28:07] man, as prophet to the Gentiles. But he
[1:28:10] came he came as a priest. And the gospel
[1:28:14] would go to the Gentiles of this Christ
[1:28:17] that came to save us from our sins. This
[1:28:20] Christ that came to heal us of our
[1:28:22] sicknesses. This Christ who is our high
[1:28:24] priest who's touched with the feeling of
[1:28:26] our infirmities. And we began and the
[1:28:29] gospel spread over the earth. But at the
[1:28:32] end at the end at the last age
[1:28:38] comes the last messenger
[1:28:41] and he is given the position
[1:28:45] and in his ministry we could stay here a
[1:28:48] long time and I don't want to do that
[1:28:49] but in his ministry
[1:28:53] he speaks to church ages
[1:28:57] and then he speaks to seals
[1:29:00] but in the seals before he comes to the
[1:29:02] first seal, he comes to the breach.
[1:29:06] And in the breach is chapter five. And
[1:29:09] you'll go home and you'll be able to
[1:29:10] read that. I want to lay enough down so
[1:29:13] you'll get it. In chapter five, and
[1:29:17] maybe you can take your Bible and read
[1:29:19] read along with me. Revelation chapter
[1:29:21] 5.
[1:29:27] I'll be about another 15 minutes and
[1:29:29] I'll close.
[1:29:36] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:29:38] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:29:40] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:29:43] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:29:46] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[1:29:48] worthy to open the book, and to loose
[1:29:51] the seals thereof. And no man in heaven
[1:29:53] nor in earth, neither under the earth,
[1:29:56] was able to open the book, neither to
[1:29:58] look thereon. couldn't even look
[1:30:00] thereon. And I wept much because no man
[1:30:04] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:30:07] the book and to read the book, neither
[1:30:09] to look thereon. This is the book of
[1:30:11] redemption. And John is weeping. Brother
[1:30:13] Brandham said because all was lost if no
[1:30:17] one could claim this book. All of the
[1:30:19] entire creation, everything was lost
[1:30:22] unless it could be redeemed. And no man
[1:30:24] was found worthy. Think of it while
[1:30:26] we're reading this now. And right when
[1:30:28] we're in this same chapter, at the end
[1:30:30] of the chapter, John is commissioned to
[1:30:32] go and take the John is commissioned to
[1:30:34] go and take the book and to eat it.
[1:30:39] And he wept much. End of verse four. And
[1:30:42] one of the elders saith unto me, weep
[1:30:45] not, behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:30:49] Judah. Just stop there for a moment. Who
[1:30:52] is that? King.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; That's the king. The lion of the tribe
[1:30:57] of Judah is the king's office.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; So this office now comes into view.
[1:31:03] Don't we? John knew who the lion. He
[1:31:05] knew the lion of the tribe of Judah was
[1:31:07] the king.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; The lion is always king.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Lamb is always priest. And eagle is
[1:31:12] always prophet.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; He's prophet, priest, and king.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; He's eagle uh lamb and lion. He's all of
[1:31:21] those. He's prophet, priest, and king.
[1:31:22] So he says, "Weep not. Behold, the lion
[1:31:25] of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[1:31:28] David, hath prevailed to open the book,
[1:31:31] and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[1:31:35] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:31:38] the throne of the four beasts, and in
[1:31:41] the midst of the elders stood a lamb,
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; as it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:31:48] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:31:50] spirits of God, sent forth into all the
[1:31:53] earth. Now, you just look this way for a
[1:31:56] moment. And some of you have been here.
[1:31:58] I've I've touched on this before, but
[1:32:00] now in the context of this service, in
[1:32:02] the context of this subject,
[1:32:08] these two offices coming together, they
[1:32:12] happen in Genesis and it happens in
[1:32:15] Revelation.
[1:32:16] And they're coming to a strong angel or
[1:32:20] a strong messenger.
[1:32:23] Christ has come to a strong messenger.
[1:32:26] And the Bible says, "And I saw in the
[1:32:28] right hand," he says, "I saw," and John
[1:32:30] says, "And I saw a strong angel
[1:32:34] proclaiming with a loud voice,
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; who is worthy to open the book, and to
[1:32:41] loose the seals thereof." Do you know,
[1:32:44] brother Brandham comes to this very Now,
[1:32:47] remember a moment ago, please just hold
[1:32:49] your attention. A few moments ago I said
[1:32:53] people that use the name William Brandom
[1:32:54] and they say a man and a ministry etc
[1:32:56] etc. Do you realize that that was a God
[1:32:59] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:33:01] world? And not just that a certain man
[1:33:05] would come at a certain season, but
[1:33:08] under a certain office with a certain
[1:33:11] authority for a specific time to deliver
[1:33:16] a specific message to a specific people
[1:33:19] that would be alive at that time. And
[1:33:21] God knew every one of you would be here
[1:33:23] at this time.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. And now he sends that
[1:33:26] under that jurisdiction. It's it's under
[1:33:29] the government. The government that was
[1:33:31] on his shoulder. The government of the
[1:33:33] kingdom of God. The government of whom
[1:33:35] he is king.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And God sends this messenger at this
[1:33:42] time with this message to bring it to to
[1:33:46] deliver it to this people. And it
[1:33:48] happens to be a prophet's office.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; The world recognizes it. I mean the
[1:33:54] religious world people, we didn't shun
[1:33:56] it. We heard of it 50 years ago and
[1:34:00] right away recognized this is God's
[1:34:02] prophet. But we didn't know about
[1:34:04] Malachi 4. We didn't know about
[1:34:07] Revelation 3 and 14 and 15 that there
[1:34:10] has to be a messenger to the church to
[1:34:12] the Leodysain church. We didn't know
[1:34:14] that. But it all the pieces started
[1:34:16] falling together.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't something you had to try to
[1:34:20] manufacture. They just started falling
[1:34:22] together.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And so now when Abraham was here in in
[1:34:26] Genesis, here's Abraham. He's a man of
[1:34:30] promise. He happens to have the word of
[1:34:32] God. And God comes to him.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; If you hear me, you say, "Amen."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; God comes to him. God comes to his
[1:34:44] prophet.
[1:34:47] And then a little later, God comes to
[1:34:51] his prophet in two offices,
[1:34:55] king
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; and priest.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Doesn't happen again in all the
[1:35:01] scripture to the end time. And now comes
[1:35:04] a prophet
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; unlike any that we have seen. And he's
[1:35:10] standing and God is confirming. God is
[1:35:14] showing, I have established this office.
[1:35:17] I've established the one who's in charge
[1:35:19] of this office. I've establish the one
[1:35:21] that I'm using. I won't change my mind.
[1:35:24] I won't use anybody else. I'm using this
[1:35:26] one.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll reveal the secrets of
[1:35:29] the heart. And if they don't hear the
[1:35:31] first sign, the voice of first sign,
[1:35:33] they will hear the second. For I'll make
[1:35:34] you to know the very secret of their
[1:35:36] heart. Did it happen? Yes, it happened.
[1:35:38] You have,00 tapes telling you it
[1:35:41] happened.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming to the end of his
[1:35:46] ministry.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And God comes to him
[1:35:54] and Revelation five he takes and you'll
[1:35:57] read it in the breach. Revelation 5 now
[1:36:00] which also it speaks of Boaz
[1:36:03] and Naomi and Ruth because that is the
[1:36:06] account of redemption.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And incidentally,
[1:36:10] oh my, I could keep you here a long time
[1:36:12] tonight and I don't want to. But in the
[1:36:16] in that account of redemption, the thing
[1:36:18] that happens in with Boaz and Ruth
[1:36:21] especially is that they change offices
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; from widow
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; to bride
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; to wife
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and he goes from bachelor
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; to bridegroom
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; to husband
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; and that's a trans that's a thing that
[1:36:39] transcends in that message
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham takes it in uh in
[1:36:44] the breach because also in the breach he
[1:36:47] has he said John I I I have it here
[1:36:51] perhaps I can just find it for you.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; John is looking for uh he says I want
[1:36:58] you to notice the fifth chapter when he
[1:37:01] looked at it. This is in Revelation the
[1:37:03] fifth chapter uh part part two
[1:37:06] revelation series. Weep not. Behold, the
[1:37:09] lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[1:37:11] David, has prevailed to open the book,
[1:37:13] and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[1:37:15] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:37:17] the throne, and of the four beasts, and
[1:37:18] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:37:20] as it had been slain, having seven
[1:37:22] horns, and seven eyes, these are the
[1:37:24] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[1:37:27] the earth. Brother Brandham says, "A
[1:37:28] lamb."
[1:37:30] Why didn't he see the lamb before?
[1:37:33] The lamb had been seated on the father's
[1:37:36] throne inside the guards. John couldn't
[1:37:40] see in there. He only seen those four
[1:37:43] beasts standing there, those four
[1:37:45] cherubams standing there guarding the
[1:37:47] holy place. Now, it showed it was not a
[1:37:50] natural beast, a lamb, because it took
[1:37:52] the book right out of out of the hand of
[1:37:55] him that sat upon the throne. And the
[1:37:57] lamb couldn't do that. He said he was a
[1:37:59] lamb. It was Christ. In other words, his
[1:38:03] attributes, he was meek and gentle as a
[1:38:06] lamb.
[1:38:08] And and continuing in the breach, he
[1:38:10] said, "The lion, a symbol of the tribe
[1:38:13] of Judah, has prevailed. He's overcome."
[1:38:16] And when he looked around to see where
[1:38:18] the lion was, he saw a lamb,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; says the lion has prevailed.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And he turns to see the lion
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; and he sees a lamb.
[1:38:29] Both those offices converging right
[1:38:32] there.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And now at the end time as a prophet
[1:38:36] standing on the earth.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; One to whom the word comes to
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and now begins to unveil that heavenly
[1:38:46] scene
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; in the unseen realm. Are you with me?
[1:38:49] Yes.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And as he begins to unveil it for the
[1:38:52] first time in history, uh we have this
[1:38:56] strange arrangement. Uh weep not John.
[1:38:59] And the and the prophet is describing
[1:39:01] why he's weeping. He's weeping because
[1:39:03] everything's lost. All creation's lost.
[1:39:07] All redemption's lost. There's no hope.
[1:39:10] And so he's weeping. And then the one
[1:39:12] speaks, "Weep not, John, for the lion of
[1:39:15] the tribe of Judah, the king's office,
[1:39:18] has prevailed to take the book and to
[1:39:20] loose the seals thereof." And he turns
[1:39:22] to see this and he sees a lamb
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; because the lamb is priest
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; and the lion is king. And at the end
[1:39:31] time, here's these offices coming
[1:39:33] together because now a prophet, a
[1:39:36] messenger is on earth and has to have
[1:39:39] this particular office on earth at the
[1:39:42] converging of these offices because the
[1:39:46] the office or the position of the lamb
[1:39:49] mercy. Do you know that they're going to
[1:39:50] call for mercy and there won't be any?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God is bringing is is going
[1:39:58] to cause that department to cease.
[1:40:00] Excuse me for using secular terms, but
[1:40:03] you understand there's a certain office
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I've called I've called I've called uh
[1:40:08] government agencies sometimes and said I
[1:40:11] you know I have a certain certain thing
[1:40:12] I wanted to this oh no that department's
[1:40:14] closed.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; We don't do that anymore.
[1:40:20] I I I've gone through that. How many of
[1:40:23] you remember Robert David? Bob David?
[1:40:25] Brother Bob David.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lots of you. You know, when he
[1:40:28] died, all his stuff came to my garage.
[1:40:32] He had no will, no documents, no
[1:40:35] nothing. I got all of his stuff in my
[1:40:38] garage. And over weeks, I'm going
[1:40:40] through everything trying to find out.
[1:40:43] We try to go overseas, ever he's lived,
[1:40:46] has he ever been married? Does he have
[1:40:48] any children? Has he got any relatives?
[1:40:50] We can't find anybody.
[1:40:52] Has he got any other bank accounts?
[1:40:54] Anything? We can't find anything. I'm
[1:40:57] going through his things one or another.
[1:40:59] Here's here here's a cashier's check for
[1:41:02] $6,500.
[1:41:04] The same as cash just stuck in some old
[1:41:06] billfold. Here's another check I find
[1:41:08] for $800 written to him from somebody in
[1:41:11] California. Stale dated now because it's
[1:41:13] over six months old. And uh and and so I
[1:41:17] have to call uh who who takes charge of
[1:41:19] this when nobody has a will. Nobody has
[1:41:21] any relatives. No, the government takes
[1:41:23] it. So, I had to actually deliver all of
[1:41:26] this to the government. The government
[1:41:27] got about 16.5 thousand or about $16,000
[1:41:32] from his assets, the sale of his assets.
[1:41:35] And I had to get permission from from
[1:41:38] the uh the authorities to give his red
[1:41:40] volume books said, "Yeah, they said go
[1:41:43] ahead and give it to his friends." So,
[1:41:44] here I am. I'm a little Joe boy for the
[1:41:47] government and I give the red books to,
[1:41:49] you know, the believers who want the red
[1:41:51] books. I hand them all the money, make
[1:41:53] all the arrangements, and I said to
[1:41:55] them, I said, you know, can we give this
[1:41:57] man,
[1:41:59] can we give him something than uh above
[1:42:02] a a poppers funeral burial in just a
[1:42:05] cloth rather than just in a cloth box
[1:42:10] that the government pays for? They said,
[1:42:12] "Yeah, there there's there's plenty
[1:42:14] here." You know, it was a woman. She
[1:42:16] said, "Yeah, go ahead."
[1:42:19] So, we had a nice burial for him and it
[1:42:23] was maybe about $3,000 for his whole
[1:42:25] entire funeral. And that's cheap. You
[1:42:28] must know that.
[1:42:32] And about four months later, I got a
[1:42:34] phone call
[1:42:35] here to the church from the funeral home
[1:42:38] and they said, "Who's going to pay this
[1:42:39] bill for about $1,600 and some dollars?"
[1:42:42] I said, "What are you talking about?"
[1:42:44] They said, "Uh, for the funeral of of
[1:42:46] Bob Harvey." I said, 'Well, it was all
[1:42:49] arranged. It was all paid for. The
[1:42:50] government's supposed to pay that. No,
[1:42:52] they said they only pay the minimum.
[1:42:54] They only pay about $1,500 and the rest,
[1:42:56] he said, 'The church will have to pay
[1:42:58] it. I said, not a chance. I gave all
[1:43:01] this money to the government.
[1:43:03] So, I said, "Just a second. I'll call
[1:43:05] them." I called it. I called them.
[1:43:08] Hello? You know, for the estate
[1:43:10] department, etc., etc. They said, "Oh,
[1:43:13] no, no, that department's been changed.
[1:43:16] the it doesn't exist anymore. And the
[1:43:18] government's changed the whole program
[1:43:20] and they're they're handling it under
[1:43:22] another office now. And they got other
[1:43:25] regulations
[1:43:26] and they wanted us to pay $1,600.
[1:43:29] Well, I guess you can guess the result
[1:43:31] of that.
[1:43:33] I didn't pay it.
[1:43:36] Do you think I should have? No. They had
[1:43:38] all that money. I said, "You pay it."
[1:43:40] And not only that, your your officer
[1:43:43] who's authorized told me to go ahead and
[1:43:47] I went ahead and did what you told me to
[1:43:49] do. Now they tried to say, "Oh, no, that
[1:43:50] office has been closed."
[1:43:55] Do you know that you had this world has
[1:43:57] heard a prophet messenger a prophet? You
[1:44:00] have if you haven't heard it before,
[1:44:01] you're hearing it tonight. He's saying
[1:44:04] clearly and it's Bible language. They
[1:44:07] will call for mercy.
[1:44:09] And it will not be there.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because the office is
[1:44:14] closed.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there'll be no mercy
[1:44:22] at a certain time? You think people are
[1:44:23] going to, "Oh, I'm sorry. The office is
[1:44:26] closed. I'm not going to call for
[1:44:27] mercy." They're going to scream for
[1:44:28] mercy.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; They're going to cry for mercy. They're
[1:44:32] going to beg for mercy.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You're looking at me like that's a
[1:44:37] little strange. Do you know that Judas
[1:44:39] repented
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; with bitter tears?
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Judas went back? He
[1:44:45] went back. He returned. He took the
[1:44:47] money, threw it down the floor. I don't
[1:44:49] want anything to do with this.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says he didn't think it was
[1:44:53] going to go to that place. He tried to
[1:44:55] repent.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; The office was closed
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; for him. The office was closed
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; and he went to his place. The Bible
[1:45:05] says,
[1:45:14] let's just turn over in your Bible as
[1:45:16] I'm getting ready to close right now.
[1:45:17] I'm 5 minutes over. I'm sorry.
[1:45:22] Let's just go to Revelation 10 for a
[1:45:25] moment.
[1:45:30] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:45:33] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:45:35] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:45:38] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:45:40] pillars of fire. It's Christ. Same one
[1:45:43] in in Revelation chapter one. And he had
[1:45:46] in his right hand a little book open. In
[1:45:49] re in Revelation 5, it was closed. Now
[1:45:52] it's open. That's right.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:45:57] and his left foot upon the earth. And he
[1:46:00] cried with a loud voice as when a what?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Not a lamb, but when a lion roarth and
[1:46:10] when he had cried, seven thunders
[1:46:11] uttered their voices.
[1:46:14] Now we're we're done reading. Where's
[1:46:17] the lamb?
[1:46:19] I just want to say to you in the plain
[1:46:21] language of the as I've been speaking
[1:46:23] tonight, the office is closed.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; The office is closed.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; When you get to Revelation 10, the
[1:46:33] office there's no lamp present.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; There was a there was a verging of those
[1:46:37] a merging of those offices in in the
[1:46:41] fifth chapter. But when you get to
[1:46:43] Revelation 10, the office is closed.
[1:46:47] You know, I haven't got time tonight,
[1:46:51] and I've pondered about this a whole
[1:46:53] lot, but there's a lot of people out
[1:46:56] there that wish things were different,
[1:46:59] but I can tell you
[1:47:02] not very many. In my lifetime, in my
[1:47:04] lifetime, you could take and put a whole
[1:47:07] lot less energy than we put even into a
[1:47:09] Sunday service and you have people
[1:47:12] flocking and running to the altar and
[1:47:14] calling to God. Such conviction, such a
[1:47:17] pull of the spirit today. You can preach
[1:47:19] your heart out. You can spend tens of
[1:47:21] thousands of dollars and maybe only get
[1:47:23] a few
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; that'll come. And you who God has dealt
[1:47:28] with and you have come to know Christ in
[1:47:31] the power of his resurrection and have
[1:47:33] had the Holy Spirit bring a revealing of
[1:47:35] the word to you. You don't know how to
[1:47:37] be thankful enough. You just want to you
[1:47:40] you want to thank God every moment of
[1:47:42] your life that God ever opened my eyes.
[1:47:45] There's millions. There's multitudes out
[1:47:47] there actually crying for mercy and not
[1:47:49] finding it.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; right. Because in closing, in closing,
[1:47:56] when an office closes
[1:47:59] and mercy ceases to be available,
[1:48:02] doesn't say there's no more mercy
[1:48:05] because that's an attribute of God. And
[1:48:07] mercy doesn't doesn't vacate.
[1:48:11] God changes the administration and says,
[1:48:14] "Ah, you used to get it that way, but
[1:48:17] I'm not giving it that way anymore."
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Aaron's office closed. Right.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And Melchazedc's office. And here the
[1:48:26] Hebrews are still trying to follow that
[1:48:30] Aaron priesthood and getting what?
[1:48:33] Nothing.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And they never will get anything until
[1:48:37] God comes to them and there they will
[1:48:40] hear their prophets
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; and God will restore the hearts and
[1:48:44] 144,000 of them will have a revelation
[1:48:47] of Jesus Christ to them. But why?
[1:48:49] Because God is going to energize and
[1:48:52] vindicate an office to them and it'll be
[1:48:54] under that jurisdiction. They will
[1:48:56] receive it.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; And you can give them millions of
[1:48:59] Bibles, it won't do any good.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; It can only come under God's provided
[1:49:04] way.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you're understanding what
[1:49:08] I'm saying. And so, Revelation 5, you
[1:49:10] have them all there. In Revelation 10,
[1:49:13] you don't have them there. In Revelation
[1:49:16] five, you have priest
[1:49:20] prophet
[1:49:23] and king in Revelation 5. In Revelation
[1:49:27] 10, there's no prophet.
[1:49:33] There's no messenger.
[1:49:35] Revelation 10:1 only speaks of one
[1:49:37] messenger and it's Christ himself.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] In Revelation five in the breach,
[1:49:43] brother Brandham will take you to the
[1:49:45] book of Ruth and explain how all that
[1:49:48] transition happened. And in Revelation
[1:49:51] five in in in I'm sorry, in chapter two
[1:49:55] of the book of Ruth, when Boaz comes to
[1:49:57] the field, which is the world, Jesus
[1:49:59] said the field is the world. And Boaz,
[1:50:02] who is Christ, comes to the world, and
[1:50:04] they've been toiling all the day.
[1:50:05] They're at the end of the day. And the
[1:50:07] first the only one that the only one
[1:50:09] Boaz is interested in of all of the
[1:50:12] reapers
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; that's workers in the gospel maybe great
[1:50:16] evangelist and ministries and who knows
[1:50:18] what but he only has his eye on one
[1:50:20] person and he only speaks to another
[1:50:23] person. He only speaks to one who's over
[1:50:26] all the field
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; his servant.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And he says to his servant, "Who is this
[1:50:32] maiden?" and he introduces Boaz to the
[1:50:35] maiden. And from then on, the prophet's
[1:50:38] out of the picture. You don't see him
[1:50:39] again.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 5, you have prophet, you
[1:50:43] have king, and you have you have priest.
[1:50:46] But in Revelation 10, you only have
[1:50:48] king.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; It's passed.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; It's transcended the offices from one to
[1:50:56] the other.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:51:02] This thing is so real. I hope you can
[1:51:03] pick it up.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And we are under the jurisdiction. We're
[1:51:07] under the jurisdiction of not some past
[1:51:12] uh uh ministry. And I'm not referring to
[1:51:14] Brother Brandham's ministry now, but
[1:51:16] we're not under some, you know, under
[1:51:18] some churchity. We're not under that. We
[1:51:21] have received the message. Listen,
[1:51:23] listen to me now because I I I tread on
[1:51:26] on perhaps delicate ground right now.
[1:51:29] There's people within the message and
[1:51:30] all are they're just uh completely
[1:51:33] consumed with the person, brother
[1:51:35] Brandham. Oh, he did this and he hunted
[1:51:38] there and he did this and he did the
[1:51:40] other thing and you can talk about them
[1:51:42] and they'll cry and start talking about
[1:51:43] Jesus and they don't don't shed a tear.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; You can talk about Calvary. You can talk
[1:51:47] about all these things because they're
[1:51:49] they're they're they're completely
[1:51:51] connected to the man
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; and they just want the man to come back.
[1:51:56] Oh, he'll come back. They missed the
[1:51:58] marriage.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; If I had a bride, I married her here and
[1:52:04] and she left this place being united
[1:52:06] being introduced to to the groom and if
[1:52:09] I was a groom and she went from here
[1:52:11] hankering for another man. Oh, if I just
[1:52:13] had if I just had him, I could hang on
[1:52:15] to him. She she has missed the whole
[1:52:18] revelation.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; It's no revelation that I'm her husband.
[1:52:22] When you're married to Christ, you don't
[1:52:24] need another man to hang on to.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; You don't need another physical person.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; No matter what his name is, I have
[1:52:31] nothing against any of the people
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; of the family or any great leader or
[1:52:36] anything else. And not no person's the
[1:52:39] man.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; The man is Revelation 10 and one. And I
[1:52:43] saw another mighty angel Christ descend
[1:52:46] from heaven.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And things have changed. and
[1:52:51] we are united with him.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; I hope I don't make enemies, but I'm not
[1:52:57] here to make an enemy. But I'm here to
[1:52:59] tell the bride of Jesus Christ, you're
[1:53:01] married.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; And he's your husband.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; And he's coming now into his kingship.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to be king of kings.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Lord of lords. Amen.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; You won't find it in the Bible priests
[1:53:21] of priests
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; or prophets of prophets.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Nobody you hear in the Bible king of
[1:53:26] kings
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; because that's how it concludes. And we
[1:53:30] are the people in this concluding hour.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; And we're under the order of MelzDC.
[1:53:36] [Applause]
[1:53:38] As
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; I said to you this morning and closing
[1:53:39] right now with this, I closed with the I
[1:53:42] said I'll give you these two tidbits.
[1:53:43] What what is the what what's in the uh
[1:53:46] uh what is Melkazedc? What was he
[1:53:48] authorized for? What is his position?
[1:53:51] What is his jurisdiction? Well, he gave
[1:53:54] bread and wine.
[1:53:56] He gave sustaining life
[1:53:59] and stimulation
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; after the slaughter of the kings
[1:54:05] to our father.
[1:54:07] Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Now, sure enough, I'm not going to
[1:54:10] preach a message like this for perhaps a
[1:54:12] long time.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, brother Brandham
[1:54:18] came that little servant of God
[1:54:22] and he slew
[1:54:24] a lot of the Lord's enemies.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I indict this generation
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:54:32] Christ. I indict these preachers. I
[1:54:34] indict this false doctrine.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you something, friends.
[1:54:42] God backed him up.
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; God backed him up.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And I'll put it in the language of the
[1:54:49] Bible. As Abraham came as God's prophet
[1:54:53] from a great slaughter of those wicked
[1:54:55] kings,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; this prophet's ministry left a trail
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; of a lot of bodies,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; right? spiritually dead
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; because they rejected and crucified the
[1:55:07] same Christ all over again.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; And it was from the slaughter of the
[1:55:10] kings. And Melzdc come.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; With bread,
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; sustaining bread.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; The word bread,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; mana from heaven,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; and that brought stimulation.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Have you had it?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Have you drank of this wine?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got it now.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; It isn't something we have to have. We
[1:55:34] got bread and wine now.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're under the
[1:55:38] administration
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; of Melzdc.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; You maybe don't even know where it come
[1:55:44] from, but it came from that authority.
[1:55:46] Came from that office.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; And another thing he had to give
[1:55:53] evidence of
[1:55:56] and bring a people under the
[1:55:57] jurisdiction. I'm closing.
[1:56:01] This is a different priesthood. You read
[1:56:04] revel uh you read Hebrews the fifth
[1:56:06] chapter, third chapter, fifth chapter,
[1:56:08] especially the seventh chapter. The
[1:56:10] other high priests, they had high
[1:56:12] priests all through the Bible.
[1:56:15] But this one raised up, ministered to
[1:56:18] the people with all his robes,
[1:56:20] everything, and he died.
[1:56:24] And the people would be reminded, I'm
[1:56:25] dying, too. my high priest died.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; But now here comes a high priest.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And he has to have a prophet on hand to
[1:56:38] put you in contact with him because he
[1:56:40] says he's standing right here,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; this Jesus Christ. And if you read
[1:56:44] Hebrews, you'll find that Apostle Paul
[1:56:48] ties Melzdc directly to Jesus Christ.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Directly to Jesus Christ.
[1:56:56] And a prophet says that's Jesus Christ.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; He says another place I'm talking to the
[1:57:02] woman through the pillar of fire.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; He said that is the Holy Spirit. That is
[1:57:06] the spirit of Christ. That is the that
[1:57:08] is Jesus Christ in another realm. Now
[1:57:11] you've got an agent.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Who sees that? Who can tell where he is?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Can tell exactly uh what his response
[1:57:21] is. can tell that woman's trying to
[1:57:25] believe. Uh, can tell she's missing it.
[1:57:28] Can tell it was over. That person has
[1:57:31] come back. Oh, now it's going back.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; what kind of office is that? What kind
[1:57:37] of a messenger is that?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; And then now is able to
[1:57:43] is able to declare
[1:57:45] according to the scripture that's
[1:57:47] without beginning of days nor end of
[1:57:50] life. And this is the office that we've
[1:57:54] come under.
[1:57:55] Uh it's one thing to believe in eternal
[1:57:58] life. I believe that I received eternal
[1:58:00] life. I believe my name's been on the
[1:58:02] book since the foundation of the world.
[1:58:06] Are you with me?
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I believe my name's been on the on the
[1:58:09] book from the foundation of the world.
[1:58:12] But
[1:58:22] it's completely different
[1:58:25] when the one that you are believing in
[1:58:28] actually comes and confirms
[1:58:31] yes what you believed is in fact truth.
[1:58:35] It is fact and I give you the assurance.
[1:58:38] You say what is that? God reveals. God
[1:58:41] opens your understanding. God opens, he
[1:58:43] gives you enlightenment.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:58:48] there was a man here not long ago, and
[1:58:51] you've probably read about him. He was a
[1:58:52] Japanese man.
[1:58:54] He was a he was a Japanese soldier in
[1:58:56] the Second World War.
[1:58:59] And he went into the jungles and hid.
[1:59:02] And you know how long he was in the
[1:59:04] jungles? I believe I'm correct. 34
[1:59:07] years.
[1:59:09] And just a short time ago, not very long
[1:59:11] ago, he came out. Somehow contact was
[1:59:14] made with him. He came out and had to
[1:59:17] convince him that the war was over.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And he thought the war was still on. And
[1:59:22] here he's been 34 years living in the
[1:59:24] jungles and the war is all finished.
[1:59:27] It's all over. It's finished. Do you
[1:59:29] know there's people and if Satan could
[1:59:34] he put you in a hole in a jungle and
[1:59:36] make you think that we're still at war
[1:59:38] and we still got a huge battle on and
[1:59:40] all the rest of it. And now a messenger
[1:59:42] comes and says and this is this is now
[1:59:45] news from another realm.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Your war is over.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Your war is finished.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; We still have an enemy but he is
[1:59:54] defeated.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Your war is over.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; This is not a message from a from a a
[2:00:02] minister or even a prophet trying to
[2:00:04] encourage you, trying to make you happy.
[2:00:06] He's telling you a statement from the
[2:00:07] office.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; He's telling you a statement from the
[2:00:10] war department.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; I hope you forgive me for using this
[2:00:16] secular terminology. He's telling you
[2:00:18] from the Department of Defense, the war
[2:00:20] is over.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; You can come out of your dark hole.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; The W victory's already been won.
[2:00:27] Hallelujah.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And our great leader has already taken
[2:00:31] and declared peace
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; for his people.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the prince of peace.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; And he's purging this world
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; and coming back to rule here
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; with his people.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] [Applause]
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; I'm long over my time.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; This is the administration that we're
[2:00:55] under. Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; When you read
[2:01:01] Revelation 5,
[2:01:04] Revelation 10, just keep that one thing
[2:01:07] in mind.
[2:01:09] These positions,
[2:01:11] these offices have changed.
[2:01:13] And we're under
[2:01:16] we're under completely a different
[2:01:18] mandate. Completely. Oh, I wish.
[2:01:22] Do you know friends, there's all kinds
[2:01:25] of churches in the area. I'm not against
[2:01:26] the churches, but the system that
[2:01:29] they're under will not give them the
[2:01:32] kind of life that you have.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Why do you as believers, why do you have
[2:01:37] the kind of life
[2:01:40] that we have that we kind of enjoy? Why
[2:01:42] do we have a sustaining power? What is
[2:01:46] it? I asked the question today, you
[2:01:49] young people, we even are asked by our
[2:01:51] our some of our senior people. Why do
[2:01:53] you direct so much to our young people?
[2:01:55] Because it's almost half of the
[2:01:56] congregation. And it's a it's a paradox
[2:01:59] to me.
[2:02:01] I talk to all kinds of people and
[2:02:03] churches and ministers and they can't
[2:02:06] hardly they get every kind of gimmick
[2:02:08] and game and all kinds of programs and
[2:02:11] music and this and entertainment trying
[2:02:14] to keep their young people. And here we
[2:02:16] stand behind the word and preach the
[2:02:18] word and preach the gospel and not an
[2:02:20] easy gospel and the young people come
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; and another one comes
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; and another one says I want to be
[2:02:27] baptized and nobody coaxes them and it's
[2:02:30] not an emotional thing and I said I said
[2:02:32] today to one of our trustees I said how
[2:02:35] does this happen why is this happening I
[2:02:38] said I just talked to a young man out
[2:02:39] the door and he's been coming for some
[2:02:41] months just coming on his own just a
[2:02:44] fine and radiant. I said, "There's
[2:02:46] nothing like this message. Once you say
[2:02:48] it, nothing." He said, "No, there is
[2:02:49] nothing else."
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's the first words I've had with
[2:02:52] him. This is incredible. Who does this?
[2:02:55] God.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; No program, no excitement, no emotion.
[2:03:01] God does it.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; God opens the understanding.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; How how privileged we are. Oh, my
[2:03:07] friends, I'm having such a a difficult
[2:03:09] time. I'm trying to say the the the
[2:03:11] church world it is that they're
[2:03:13] appealing.
[2:03:15] Listen, the time is going to come when
[2:03:17] preachers are preaching perhaps a a lot
[2:03:20] better message and uh you know with more
[2:03:22] power or more vigor or more something
[2:03:24] than I am and they're going to convince
[2:03:26] the people of their need of Christ.
[2:03:29] Brother Brandham says they're going to
[2:03:30] come to the altar and they're going to
[2:03:33] pray. They're gonna weep and believe
[2:03:36] they're getting salvation
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; and it'll be over.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; The office is closed.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaith the word.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus say it?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Many will come say, "We did this in your
[2:03:53] name. We did that in your name. We did
[2:03:55] something else." And what's he going to
[2:03:57] say? What's he say?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[2:04:03] Isn't that something?
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that. And that's
[2:04:17] why we preach the way we preach.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; That's why we urge people. We're not
[2:04:22] here.
[2:04:25] and the wrong office, the wrong
[2:04:29] there. They still have a mental concept,
[2:04:31] a mental image of Jesus that walked by
[2:04:35] the Sea of Galilee. He did walk by the
[2:04:37] Sea of Galilee. He doesn't happen to be
[2:04:39] there right now.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; He happens to be right here
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; in another office.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is the word.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; We're under another order. We're under
[2:04:53] an order of
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; MelzDC.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Unchanging God
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; without beginning of days nor ending of
[2:05:00] life.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's the order I want to be under.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you for remaining with me as
[2:05:10] long as you did.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing, shall we?
[2:05:15] Amen. There's no place to end, so we
[2:05:17] just quit.
[2:05:20] But the office isn't closed. will be
[2:05:22] here the next service,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Lord willing.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; If this office closes, we'll be open on
[2:05:28] the other side.
[2:05:32] [Applause]
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:05:40] Let's sing. There's never been a day
[2:05:42] like this. Let's stand, shall we? And
[2:05:43] sing. There's never been a day like this
[2:05:45] day. You sing it however it means.
[2:05:48] Whatever it means to you. There's never
[2:05:52] been a day
[2:05:54] like this day.
[2:05:58] There's never
[2:06:01] been a day
[2:06:03] like this.
[2:06:05] I see.
[2:06:07] Oh, there's never
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:11] [Applause]
[2:06:14] so bright
[2:06:16] as this day.
[2:06:18] this glorious
[2:06:21] day.
[2:06:24] There's never been a day
[2:06:29] like this day
[2:06:31] to me. There's never
[2:06:35] been a day like this day. I see. There's
[2:06:42] never
[2:06:44] light
[2:06:46] that shine
[2:06:48] so bright
[2:06:50] as the
[2:06:53] glorious
[2:06:55] day.
[2:06:58] Something came to me earlier while I was
[2:07:01] studying this message, I believe
[2:07:02] yesterday, and it comes back to me again
[2:07:04] right now. And that is if you have some
[2:07:08] question
[2:07:10] that has arisen in your mind on the
[2:07:12] subject that we've been speaking,
[2:07:15] if you'd like to just write it down and
[2:07:17] hand it into into me or into the office,
[2:07:21] I'd be happy to receive it. might not be
[2:07:23] able to answer them all, but I just felt
[2:07:25] that we might want to do that because if
[2:07:28] there's something that you'd say, well,
[2:07:29] I I I kind of missed this. I if you'd
[2:07:32] give me some clarification on this or
[2:07:33] tell me where I might read to get a
[2:07:35] better understanding of this, I'd be
[2:07:37] very very happy to do that. So, we just
[2:07:39] like to be as helpful as we can. Do you
[2:07:41] enjoyed the word?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I trust that you have. There's
[2:07:46] never
[2:07:48] been a day
[2:07:51] like this day
[2:07:53] to me. There's never been a day
[2:07:59] like this day. I see. There is
[2:08:06] a light
[2:08:08] that shines
[2:08:10] so bright
[2:08:13] as
[2:08:15] the glory
[2:08:17] of I am redeemed. I am redeemed.
[2:08:22] I am redeemed.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you for it.
[2:08:30] Oh my Jesus.
[2:08:34] my life
[2:08:39] and
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:44] just
[2:08:47] don't be afraid. Tell them

[2:09:25] I am.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Just feel like worshiping him just for a
[2:09:42] moment in song. Let's just worship him.
[2:09:44] Wonder if we can sing worthy is the
[2:09:47] lamb.

[2:13:26] Well, it's not midnight,
[2:13:28] not a midnight hour, but we don't have
[2:13:30] to wait for midnight to bless his name.
[2:13:32] We have just received word that Megan,
[2:13:36] our sister Megan, is out of emergency
[2:13:38] surgery.
[2:13:40] And doctors said that all went well and
[2:13:43] that they were able to remove the entire
[2:13:45] blood clot.
[2:13:48] I want to say we do not tell the
[2:13:51] congregation everything.
[2:13:53] But earlier today
[2:13:56] they did a bio they not a biopsy but
[2:13:58] they did a
[2:14:00] uh sent a like a catheter camera
[2:14:05] uh up like an angio
[2:14:08] up to the spot. They said it was much
[2:14:11] worse than what they had expected. In
[2:14:14] fact is I believe they said it was one
[2:14:16] of the worst that they've seen and they
[2:14:19] didn't didn't really have
[2:14:22] uh a whole lot of confidence of just how
[2:14:25] things would turn out. They weren't
[2:14:28] nearly as hopeful as they were when they
[2:14:30] first brought her. We didn't say that.
[2:14:32] Sometimes people get caught in the
[2:14:34] emotion of it. We've been holding it
[2:14:36] before the Lord and uh said please pray
[2:14:40] for the family in your prayers as there
[2:14:44] are still uncertainties of the effects
[2:14:46] of her motor skills balance and memory.
[2:14:51] The family wishes for no visitors at
[2:14:54] this time. So I want to rem remind you
[2:14:56] young people no visitors for sister
[2:14:59] Megan at this time but we bless his
[2:15:02] name.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; We bless his name. I personally have
[2:15:06] prayed and am praying that this will be
[2:15:11] something that will get glory. I've been
[2:15:13] I I'm I'm just like
[2:15:16] I'm just obsessed with this one thought.
[2:15:21] Not healing to satisfy us. Not healing
[2:15:24] even to give life back. Not healing so
[2:15:27] we can have our loved ones back. healing
[2:15:32] or this miracle, whatever it is we're
[2:15:34] praying for that your name, oh God, can
[2:15:36] be glorified.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Whatever will glorify your name,
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; whether in life or in death, whatever it
[2:15:43] is, glorify your name.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Get glory to your name.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; And I would like to see him be able to
[2:15:49] glorify
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; the Christ of this word.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Glorify the living Christ.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it with all my
[2:15:59] heart. I'm going to ask our brother
[2:16:01] Mohan Senior if you will come please and
[2:16:04] pray. I saw you get blessed in the word
[2:16:05] this morning and that blessed me also.
[2:16:08] Let's just sing I'll bless your name
[2:16:10] once again as our brother Mohan comes
[2:16:12] and and ask give thanks to God if you
[2:16:16] would brother Moan for the
[2:16:19] work that has taken place on our sister
[2:16:22] Megan as well. Thank her. Thank God on
[2:16:25] behalf of this congregation. Get let
[2:16:27] we'll give praise to him
[2:16:30] and then ask God's blessing upon the
[2:16:32] people this week. Okay, we'll sing I
[2:16:35] bless your name.
