TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] stand as we sing Oh this is [Music] my is my [Music] I believe it was the psalmist David that said I will say to my soul praise ye the Lord sometime we have to tell our soul you're going to praise God you didn't come here just to warm a seat you came here to be a participant you came here while you've got breath in your lungs and in your body and Life to say something of of the grace of God and that's the best way I know to do it I'll praise him I'll give him glory and the the last verse of that course the verse of the song we just sang perfect submission all is at rest is so much in keeping with the service this morning that I feel in my heart to speak I'd like to sing that verse again and just before we just before we do I would like to just just make these comments uh we're very much in preparation for the convention which is taking place I want to uh show my appreciation for all of those that are uh putting such an effort out and there's a lot of effort out for those you that have opened your homes uh I see for myself there is two real thrusts that I feel in my spirit uh that I would like to to see happen and one is I'd like that the congregation here would be an example message church and I believe that you are I just want that to be expressed in a very wonderful way to all the people that will be coming in our conduct in our Hospitality in our Zeal and in our a holy ghost fill life I believe that we can be that and express that and be an encouragement to others so that they can visit here and say we had a glorious time we heard a rich word we met wonderful people and we go home with uh an an edified that we want to continue with this kind of atmosphere you believe that's possible what we have a message why why can't we have a model Message Church you believe it I don't want to feel like I'm pulling a sled over dry ground now do you believe it all right then let's let's just say well we will do that by God's grace we'll do that and the second thrust is that we it has just been my own personal uh insatiable desire which I never never can get away from neither do I want to get away from it and that is to provide the message to the peoples of the world in the language they can understand something that you and I so enjoy and we just become enraptured with the words that God sent to us through his Prophet messenger that we can dedicate ourselves and say we will do all that we can to see that this reaches as far as possible uh to as many people as possible to whatever doors that God opens to us so we want to be remembering also especially brother Tony is uh still in uh Brazil and attending to some things he's got some real burdens down there and so I also want to say you've been praying that the different pastors will be able to get visas to come uh brother Vernon from the Philippines got his Visa this last week we're very happy over that brother Cesar and his wife got their visas from Brazil and uh so there's over 70 pastors from probably somewhere between 15 and 20 countries that have now confirmed are able to be here so we're really thankful about that and for those of you that are streaming on the internet uh we we want you to know that we certainly appreciate your prayers and your comments and there are many uh last last Sunday there was somewhere around 170 some locations that were live streaming during the service while you're here worshiping and uh and from that day to this from Sunday to Sunday there was about another 300 and some that had connected through the archiving because their timing is not right China and some of these countries and from over 33 or not over but 33 nations with 34 I believe it was I very rarely looked but I just want to let you know that this this is a real live audience and we are participating with them and they are participating with us and we just want to say God's blessings upon them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ remember also beginning next Sunday next Sunday will just be one one Sunday service it'll be we're going to go one Sunday service now for the summer during the congestion on the on the border I know sometimes it's not congested other times it's terribly congested but we're we're going to have a we'll we we'll just count on having a camp meeting every Sunday morning and how long it goes we don't know we're not going to drag it out on purpose but we're going to be here with no time restraints amen Allelujah well I believe I got enough support for that to do it amen have been praying for this service did you put your order in for this service amen there's a baptismal tonight at least two are being baptized it's wonderful what God is doing friends one of the young men that's going to be baptized tonight is a a real blessing uh this this is the time God moved on them last Sunday and I understand I can't say his testimony but I understand I haven't talked with him directly but I understand he's never been to the front never been baptized from one of our good believing families but he's going to be baptized tonight and soon as he had that experience last Sunday morning he's told our brother Tom I just can't get enough of the word of God have an insatiable thirst for the word of God of God I can't pass a message book without picking it up and reading it and devouring it that's a good sign it's a good sign Hallelujah get hungry right away amen that wonderful there's a man here in the congregation and he won't mind me saying this I'm sure but I just shook hands with him last Sunday morning coming in to the service and brother Mike caleno said I'd like that little prayer cloth do you have a prayer cloth I said yes said I'd Like a Prayer cloth for my friends I shook hands with him brother Mike calino said this man knew brother Tom Ray before he was married oh I was shaking hands with him so I said so you knew brother Tom Ray he said so I said safe way he said yes Safeway we work together at Safeway says and then he got converted and I thought this is he may not realize this but I was I was just stunned that over 30 years probably 33 years and I'm standing here in front of our church doors with a man that's seated here now and he remembers of one of the associate ministers here and the first thing he remembers it was before he was married and the second thing he remembers then he got converted the testimony friends you might think it's forgotten it's not forgotten God knows exactly the moment and letting that light shine amen bless Assurance perfect submission Hallelujah can you sing it with me [Music] now all is at rest all is at rest I [Music] my I happy watch and wait I'm [Music] look is my is [Music] my I'm praising my [Music] is my St is my prising [Music] my we'll pray Heavenly Father we are so privileged and so thankful that we can address you and approach you and call you our father that we have come from your loins we've come from the father's genes and where we have come from is where we will go back to we thank you for eternal life through Jesus Christ God's lamb the sacrificed lamb oh thank you for the blood that was shed the price was paid and the words of our Lord Jesus could say and did say it is finished today Lord we rest in that finished work today we rejoice in that finished work and that you have sent the Holy Spirit down Within These human vessels giving witness and testimony that the work is a finished work bless this congregation the visible congregation the internet congregation and all who may ever participate in this service May the whole same Holy Spirit present here now be present everywhere Lord pray you'll bless us now with a spirit of Revelation as we read your scripture for you are the author and we're trusting you as the author make known this message to us oh God give understanding I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles to the book of Hebrews if you would the third chapter beginning to read at the seventh verse and then we're going to continue in the fourth chapter for six verses wherefore is the the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do all we Heir in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin I want to just stop there to say unbelief unbelief has a hardening effect through the hardened through the deceitfulness of sin sin is also deceitful and it is hardening of of of our spirit for We Are Made verse 14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit profet them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief it remaineth that some must enter therein God bless you as you have your seats some must enter in it remaineth that some must enter in I'm glad that is in there I identify with that I'm I'm some of that must I'm one of those you're one of those that's got to be a personal witness within your own soul there are some that must enter in and I'm part of that group amen and to enter in and uh the word that Paul has used here is not just to enter as we may think of entering into a place such as this but the an entrance into any condition an entrance into any condition or to and the word also implies to arise and come into existence in other words prior to this entering in we may be the person that we are but we don't we haven't really come into our existence we haven't come into what we are to be or what is intended for us to be and so Paul is saying here and using this word throughout these two chapters and if you'll notice please that the Bible is calling it God is calling it my rest not your rest but it's my rest God's rest we're in entering into his rest that's what the scripture is speaking about and only by coming into his rest can we really be in the right place only coming into his rest can we be can we come into what I would say true existence outside of that we're not having a true existence we come to life and to come to come into real real true existence or our real true condition right at this time of the year we've in this part of the world at least in North America United States Canada our students are completing School many of them completing their 12th grade of Education looking forward perhaps to further education and uh we will have uh grad ceremonies many of you in the next couple of weeks so you'll be completing and concluding that part of your life your education and looking forward to whatever else you might be doing a lot of decisions decisions will be made at a different level now when the young people come to that uh time and you'll be facing challenges uh unchartered Waters that you've never traversed new Pathways and we can say decisions decisions plenty of them you want to have the Holy Spirit guiding you in this part of your life and for those that are looking towards uh further education some field of Education I I understand that many colleges uh universities they require an entrance exam and there is an entrance procedure there they may require and I I looked into it because that's what I'm speaking of entering in to this rest entering into to this condition entering into your true existence and now some of you that have finished this phase of your education you want to enter into what I really want to be what I expect to be what my true existence will be in life I'm going to be this or I'm going to be something else and I want to prepare myself and so now I need further education to to uh get the kind of uh skills that I will require for the rest of my life and even to enter into what your true existence will be you've got to have a uh you've got to go through some procedures for your entrance exams and it said U uh you must try your best to perform well on these exams s and I can say that is true also in the spiritual sense your performance on the required entrance exam is only one part of the admission criteria other criteria include your grade point average uh or your marks your scores uh letters of recommendations perhaps essays Etc this is just for natural education you are well advised to take these exams seriously and if that applies there how much more so now a sound preparation can enhance your performance significantly help is abundantly available and I can say that is certainly the case here help is abundantly available in the form of information on the web and books and coaching and classes research what has been research what is best for you and what you can afford well let me say to you you can afford this and we're having not merely a convention we're not having a convention have a convention we haven't had it for 10 years as soon as we announced we would have that you know then brother Tom some of the brothers here asked well will we have Family Camp I said I believe that we need to have Family Camp I don't think that our our people will forgive us if we don't have a family Camp because it's a great time when it's it's not a convention atmosphere it's a Family Camp atmosphere where parents are mingling with their children and and our vision and desire I think this is 21 years every year we've had Family Camp and have gone from probably 60 young people to almost 400 young people and uh from maybe two 300 on the camp or maybe even less than 200 to last year I think they filled a th000 seats we had rented had a thousand seats Under the Tent and this is not just a you know this is not a a time of frivolity and just and so on but it's a time when family relationships are forged together when mothers and fathers are able to be with their young people and the desire because out out in the world the spirit of the world is so uh intent on destroying the family the family ties and that's the first thing that Satan did in the in Eden was dismember the family and we are opposed to that we are absolutely directly opposed to it we believe in the family we believe that God has ordained that we shall have family and I believe as father as a father myself you can't take my place I can't take yours but as a father I've claimed my family for God hallelujah my children and my children's children and I say the devil's a liar Hallelujah and whatever he may attempt to do and whatever he succeeds in doing I don't call it an ultimate success I call him an ultimate failure and the and the promise of God is yay and amen hallelujah and I won't let anyone take that away from me and don't let anyone take that away from you if you want to follow in the footsteps of your pastor you can follow in those footsteps God's word is true Hallelujah and we believe the the circle shall not be broken on the other side Hallelujah say well what if it looks impossible God is a god of the impossible Hallelujah today in this time many of you that will are graduating and I don't want to spend much time on this because I want to get to the scripture but this is certainly a good foundation for it you will be making more decisions I went heard a woman a few years ago speak to a graduating class when some of our young people were graduating out of the 12th grade and she said at that time she said some years ago you would only uh prepare for one one profession and you would expect to stay in that profession for the rest of your days but she said most of you will have as many as five jobs you'll train for five different jobs and today there are many more decisions than just making a decision for one people used to work for one or two lawyers in a lifetime but the US Department of Labor stats show that today both men and women between the ages of 18 to 40 will have over 10 jobs in their lifetime over 10 different jobs so it's doubled even since I sat in that graduation in class A few years ago so there's a lot of decisions that are being made instead of a young person saying I'm going to be a doctor I'm going to be this they might be that for the rest of their life but the average American has 10 jobs that between 18 and and 40y old Americans and that is what uh we have garnered from their website they say that also that the average family moves 12 times the average American family moves an 12 times in their lifetime and so the families today Are Much More transcent Much More moving and moving is a big decision moving is a costly decision and I have said to so many here that have moved and have come here you can pull up your roots in five minutes but you can't put them down in five and it's putting them down that that really takes some time and some patience and there's hardship and work and labor and putting your roots down you can put them up in just a few moments say let's go pack up we're out of here we're history but to then to change uh your place of dwelling change the whole atmosphere the whole environment your conditions your culture your job your position and some of those which you it's a it's a Terri experience and so uh I'm just saying that by way of of of a foundation for the for the service this morning I'm not speaking about that but I do believe that uh we must be prepared the songwriter said I've been traveling for Jesus so much of my life been traveling Orlando or or on sea and I said well Amen to that but I'm planning on taking a trip to the sky and that will be the last move for me he went on to say here I'm bothered with packing each time that I move and carry a load in each hand but I'll not need one thing that I've used in this world when I move to that Heavenly land when I make my last move Hallelujah we all are faced with our own unique set of circumstances we sit here today beside family perhaps husband wife individual our friends our peers and uh I would say there isn't a person here but what we are facing some sort of a decision as I spoke on decisions last Sunday carrying on a wee bit but I'm wanting to come now to where I really wanted to approach last last Sunday service uh we want to make a move in our spiritual life we want to perhaps and I may not be speaking to 100% of the congregation but I think I'll be speaking to most everyone we want to move from where we are spiritually to another dimension to another level and I'm sure we all hunger after that and I'm going to take a message that the prophet of God left us and how he broke get down and it is incredibly revealing and enlightening and I feel that when I have covered what he has said it will cover every single person in this building not a not one person will be left out and so you can look for that part that refers to you in the scripture which we've read Hebrews is written by the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Paul is writing to the Hebrew Hebrews and he has two main concerns because they are Jews and he is a Jew and he can understand what it is to because they're they're they're leaving one element and moving to another and that is the they they're leaving essentially the law and all of its all of its regulations and all of its Washings and all of these things and Rabbi Richmond has said and also gersan Solomon has said and I've heard them both say it that the law had 600 they have 613 laws in the Old Testament and Jews keep those laws the ultra Orthodox Jews attempt to keep those 63 laws which are left from the Old Testament Paul knew something of the struggle of the Jews coming out of that out of Judaism and in into followers of Christ to become Believers of Christ and so the two themes that are in Hebrews which will now apply to the scripture we read he was wanting to prove to the Jewish Christians that Judaism as they had known it had come to an end through the Fulfillment of the scripture in Jesus Christ that he was the Fulfillment of the whole purpose of God in the law and so that now now it was to have faith in Christ and and it seemed so simplistic I'm sure it was difficult because they were they were uh so trained from childhood from birth they had to do things you have to do this you have to do this washing you have to do it a certain way and all of these sacrifices a certain way in the way we eat and the way we dress and the way we do everything and now Paul is trying to tell them that this has been completed in Christ Christ is the Fulfillment and the end of the law and then secondly that there was a danger a very real danger with these new Believers for we can identify with this there was a danger that the Jewish Believers would lapse back would lapse back into Judaism or simply pause and not not move forward in the message of the hour and we certainly can identify with that there's a danger many of us come from all kinds of denominations and churches and whatever more and and there's a danger within the message of lapsing back and and and hanging on to traits of the past and hanging on to forms of the past and things that have been Dragged In from uh we'll say Christianity churchianity uh the religious World dragging those things up say well we need to continue with those or coming into the message and then and then just becoming uh stagnant not moving forward saying well well you know this is good enough yeah okay God sent a prophet Malachi 4 uh Luke 17:30 fine wonderful and you know godhead baptism serpent seed whatever more and then we we remain there and we don't move forward that's what Paul was saying and that is why he he he could say that because even him himself he made this testimony he said though I might have also confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he may Trust In the Flesh I more he's establishing himself as a Jew to the Philippians he said I am circumcised circumcised The Eighth Day of the stalk of isra Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrew as concerning touching the law a fisy and concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless I if anybody's a Jew he says I'm a Jew I'm a circumcised the eighth day I'm of The Tribe of Benjamin I'm a zealous Jew I'm I I've kept the law to Perfection and all of those things and so so he was saying that you know I have a right I know what it is that you're going through and to you Hebrews you must not pause you must not lapse back and you must not just stay where you are there is a rest there's another place and we must enter into that rest we must in other words inherit everything that God purchased for us why s and be idle why sit and just lapse back why be satisfied with less than what God has provided for us hallelujah so Paul could say as he did in Hebrews 6 he said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith towards God you know there are some even within the message say well I'm just staying with the ABCs I'm just staying with the ABCs well I can tell you Apostle Paul Paul would rebuke anybody saying that saying it's much more than ABCs some people want to stay in their own comfort zone and just say well I just you know stay with the simple things it's it's hey whatever whatever the prophet of God delivered that's what he intends us to eat God didn't send it to us to you know just to look at and put it and hang it on the wall and put the book in the as a as a a display in a cabinet or something God intended the people to participate and take a whole of it and to have it lived out there's a message for this hour amen so leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith towards God so Paul is saying let us move on from that perfection in this case the first word that Perfection means is a finisher Paul was a finisher Paul said in in Acts the 20th chapter he said and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save except he knew this sa that the Holy Spirit has witnessed in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me so I don't know what's going to befall me completely but the holy spirit is also witnessed that in every city bonds and afflictions uh abide me those things will be with me but he says but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy not that I be dragged out in the end and get through by the skin of my teeth but he says None of these things and listen friends we don't want to take this as a sermon this morning you've got to apply it to your own self the Holy Spirit Witness to me that I'm not in a Sunday school picnic the Holy Spirit witnesses to me that this way won't be an easy way whatever my future is the holy spirit witnesses to me this will be a battle and the prophet says I'll fight for every inch and you've got to be resolved in your heart I'm prepared to fight for every end nothing shall move me none of these things move me can this congregation say Amen down in your soul cannot ReSound an amen nothing shall move me don't be caught in my inspiration be caught in in your own inspiration don't be caught in my witness be caught in your own witness none of these things shall move me nothing that Satan can throw in my way no enchantment no enticement Hallelujah nothing of these things shall move me I know that there's afflictions that abide me the Holy Spirit Witnesses this won't be an easy way but I'm going to finish my course with joy that is perfection I'm going to I'm going to be mature enough that I can make that kind of of a decision and that is why Apostle Paul could also say he could say that I have I have finished my course he said to Timothy I have finished my course here he was saying that I may finish my course but then he was able to write that old Apostle to Timothy and said I have finished my course glory to God therefore there's a crown laid up for me where every person here wants to be able to make that testimony to complete let us go on to Perfection let's complete the journey to accomplish what we've been called to accomplish and Paul is saying let us go on to full age don't let us remain as children oh they didn't shake my hand they didn't look at me just right or this thing I had a bad day what's that got to do with it that's got nothing to do with it I'm going through a tough time you're supposed to expect that Hallelujah you're to expect that we haven't been called to an easy way it also says in in Hebrews Paul's telling the Hebrews for when the time that you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles now he's talking to the Jewish Believers he's talking to people that came into the message that's who he's talking to he not talking to a bunch of unbelievers he's talking to people who came into the message said by the time when you should be teachers said then you have need to be taught again of the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age that he was talking about coming to Perfection let's move to Perfection and belongs to them of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil therefore it remaineth that some must enter into my rest brother Brenham takes the Tabernacle of the Wilderness I was going to put it on the screen but I'm not going to distract you with it now the Tabernacle in the wilderness was built in three parts as is it has direct reference and this is fundamental to a lot of you but many and some of our young people coming up it has direct reference to your physical body your physical being you are body you are spirit and you are soul your body has a five channels your spirit has five channels and a lot of people can't remember those five channels I don't have the best memory in the world but I I use a my own little code and I use it my car for the for the five channels to the to the spirit my car M for your memory I for your imagination C for your conscience a for your affection and R for reasoning and four of those five are in the mind and it involves your affection your memory what you think your imagination what you can be all of these things and they are so close now the the scripture which the prophet used all the time throughout his entire Ministry is this one for the word of God is quick and Powerful now here's where Pentecost and so many religions and so many theologians and Men of great learning they missed it completely because when the prophet of God was standing there Discerning the secrets of the people's hearts they thought what a marvelous gift oh God has given a gift of discernment it was no gift of discernment and he kept using the scripture and they should have caught it they should have caught it he said it over and over hundreds and hundreds of times for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword not the gift of God the word of God the word of God God's breath God's Own breath God's word not a man's word not William bram's word or Ed bis's word or anybody else's word the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit not body and spirit it doesn't take the word to divide between this flesh and my spirit but between the spirit and the Soul because they are so closely merged together they're not one but they're so closely merged together that's why when a lot of young people are coming to uh the state of the emotion that's involved with courtship and and who I'll marry and and marriage and so on it is so close that emotional that highly concentrated emotional area and and and and I say you know well are you really certain well yeah I'm I'm absolutely certain because you know because this and I've seen that sign and etc etc and only the word can actually divide between what is spirit and what is soul only the way only the message of the hour only theology can't do it catechism can't do it Sunday schools can't do it uh even preachers can't do it but the word that comes sent from God out of the messenger's mouth can divide it has a it has the surgical accuracy to divide between the spirit and the soul and the word can divide between the spirit and the soul and so we have now the outer Court which is the your body we have the inner court it's called also the holy place which is your spirit realm and then and then there is the holy of holies and there was a curtain between the holy place and the holy of holies and in the outer Court the people congregation could come in the inner Court was where the priests came to minister and in the holy of holies only the high priest once a year not without blood could enter into the holy of holies and in each of these places they had their very various instruments and the various vessels and they had a certain kind of an altar and then you go into the holy place they had the altar of showbread the table of showbread and the Candlestick in the Holy place but in the holy of holies was only the Ark of the Covenant with a cherub them standing over it with their wings touching and that was and the word of God laying in the Ark of the Covenant and you are Body Spirit and soul and in the outer Court we have certain needs certain requirements and God has provided for that and in the inner Court where the priests could go the there are different kind of implements and and altars and so on and different kind of light there and then the holy of holies was different and God said to Moses you will make a tabernacle this is how you'll make it and he made these words so that I I may dwell there and the word that God has sent has been designed specifically for your soul now there are benefits which flow to your emotional realm there's benefits which flow to all the other realm there's benefits which flow to you physically but now how the prophet's message and how the prophet's Ministry came out and first started to touch the body take people by the hand and the and the religious world for the most part became consumed with that oh I just need healing oh if he'll just tell me my sickness they're missing it this was the vessel that would send the word and heal the soul it's our souls that needed healing the altar needed to be rebuilt can you say Amen it's your soul friend and then when the word reaches the soul see Satan has reversed this thing but when the word of God the revelation of the word reaches your soul and takes control and you're born again born of the spirit and the word then that new birth begins to emanate and rise up and takes charge and control of the spirit realm then that word takes control of your imagination that word takes control of your memory because there's some things in your memory you should remember and there's some things in your memory you must for forget and only the word can decipher what should be forgotten and what should be remembered it's got to come from the soul come up and take and clear out that memory Channel some of you people here today got memories you need to forget it's been plaguing your mind and you need to forget it you need to put it on God's Altar and let the Holy Fire of God consume it and end it all and I say you need to move you need need to move today you need to make the decision I'm moving I'm packing up I'm leaving that behind I'm letting the word Minister I'm going to let the word decide what I remember and what I forget and then into the imagination people imagine all kinds of things people even have an imaginary oh my this is another whole message help me now they have an IM an imaginary uh they have an imaginary Jesus the world has an imaginary Jesus and they're not in love with the Jesus of the Bible they're in love with the Jesus of their imagination and there's a danger right within the message well what did Jesus say to the Pharisees and the people of his day oh people are dressed right you couldn't lay a finger on their lives if they were Believers of today you couldn't even put a finger on their lives they were so precise and so perfect Jesus said your fathers your fathers you garnish the tombs you spend your time making the tombs of the prophets go there with all the righteous feeling and everything and all the outward appearance garnishing and giving honor to the prophets that had died Jesus said you Hypocrites your fathers killed them and put them in there but you see those most men if you told them and said you hate the prophets so what are you saying that's a blasphemy to us we don't hate the prophets we love the prophets Jesus said your fathers killed the prophets but what they did they had garnished they had they had they had honored the position of the prophets and they had built a an imaginary image of what the prophets were and they were in love with that image not the prophet themselves and a lot of people today say oh brother brandom and they get brother brandom into a place and into an exalted place and a position and something God exalted him God put him in the place that he had but they get him in some kind of place and if they had lived maybe back there with him and just seen him as a human mind and making the mistakes that he made or living the life that he lived you might not have been impressed with it but what so you say well today what are people impressed with you're impressed with what your imagination has constructed that's what you're impressed with if you lived right then when Jesus lived and you saw his Frailty and he did things that you might understand people picked up stones to Stone them and he ran and dispensed and you might say what's he doing you know I believe he's God In the Flesh what's God In the Flesh running from and you might not be impressed with that that and a lot of other things which he did he weary and maybe sat just heal somebody lame and oh lay over here and with a headache tempted in all points as every man tempted in all points is that what the scripture says but the image that people have constructed is a Christ that never was tempted never had any difficulty never was anything that's you're in love with your image you're in love not with the real person you're in love with what you've constructed him to be I hadn't planned on getting into that but that's why you need you need the word you need the word to come and and separate any imagination and in your conscience how many people are condemned that are real Born Again Believers you're condemned and and and and hang on guilt hangs on to you you can't seem to shake free of it that condemnation has no right your conscience has no right to Cloud your life with condemnation for the word of God has said here it comes quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword for there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus so the question now is am I in Christ Jesus and if you can say yay amen I am in Christ Jesus then there is now therefore no condemnation to them which in Christ Jesus so your memory Satan tries to poke something in your memory Channel say oh look at this back there and try to bring condemnation on you and you say well now I'll just let the word come up into that memory Channel and clear that one out Hallelujah for there's now there for no condemnation I don't care what kind of a failure it has been I don't care what what has happened in the past the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed that perfectly and if he hasn't then he failed he died in vain at Calvary so people want to think of the power of Calvary but somehow they want to give uh consideration to Satan to have control of Our Lives he hasn't got any control of our lives and the prophet of God has said that when that sin is confessed it drops into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and it breaks up that bleach actually breaks up it literally breaks up is this what he said is this what he said it breaks up the very elements of the of the of the ink and you've heard me say it and he says even the ink becomes bleach it is so purging and so purifying and so powerful your sin is no match for the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so it remain that that some must enter in I'm preaching this this morning because there may be some here that have to move from the outer court and so now we have these three courts I'm going to move along Qui quickly I'm going to dis give the brother bram's description of the outer Court he said many Christians in my life life he's seen many Christians in his life to be up and down seems to have such a deep desire daily they [Music] search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or Anchored In Christ this is I'm describing the Oder Court I've inserted this scripture Jesus spoke of the SE and the seed and he spoke of the one group and he says and they have no root in themselves and so they endure but for a short time and afterward when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the world's for the word's sake because of the word soon as persecution arise or Affliction because of the word sake sake immediately they are offended that is why I spoke of decisions we need and especially those that have have given themselves to this message we need to have a resolve because the resolve also is a part of Faith a resolve that and and speak the words of apostle Paul say them to yourself today none of these things shall move me I know that there's bonds I know that there's afflictions there can be all kinds of trouble whatever it might be but none of these things shall move me and if you say well I've been up and down I've been in and out I've been unstable I've been so that I have no I need an anchor then I'm telling you what to do today if I was sitting across the desk from you if you were in my office or where I was in your home you say brother Ed what I do I'll tell you what to do pack up and get ready to move where are you going to move well I would pack up and say I'm not stopping in this outer court anymore I'm not dwelling here anymore I'm not having my ups and downs anymore I'm not going to be moved by these distresses anymore I'm moving out of here hallelujah pick up your bags if you have any and move on onto the holy place and right on into the holy of holies he speaks about these people he said the one intellectually intellectually is hungry he's feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out you might be here and no doubt some are intellectually is hungering for God and feasting on God but his feast doesn't hold out that's what you will find is the theme throughout this he went on to say many people go to the service such as we have this morning they Rejoice they shout we're talking about the outer court now shouting is fine in the older Court hey in the older Court you say well oh my I just feel it that's fine shout make sure that when the feeling's gone something's still anchored there and you find well you know what I shout it I had such a wonderful time oh I had such a marvelous feeling I don't even know where it went say what shall I do brother Ed pack up get ready to move make a decision don't be in love with your old self say I don't like my old self I'm moving to another place am says they have they shout and they praise the Lord and while the spirit of God is falling all condemnation left their hearts and a day or two after the Revival they find themselves back in the old grind again they're eating Mana he said the Justified man out here out in the outer Court the man's Justified he walks by daylight I touched on this last Sunday but now I want to enlarge on it he walks by daylight I have to make a confession I actually have I've wondered you know if the Lord is I don't want to grieve the Lord I don't want to displease the Lord but I have complained more this winter than I have at any time of 37 years of living here in this area not again I don't have to live in this PE soup again I can't even see the hills I can't even see across the valley I just this dismal drizzle why doesn't it go back where it came from and I know that there's a sun up there and I just so want to see it do I have any friends and when the sun is out I don't care you know maybe it doesn't affect you but when the sun is out and I see the early in the morning the Sun hitting the trees I feel better already but should I feel more spiritual no I shouldn't but somehow it affects me and so I I realized right away I better pass through this outer Court real quick I better not stay here because this is going to really bother me I think all of you folks are human enough to say I I've been there yeah I've been there but you know and that's exactly I feel so sorry for people from Arizona and people that have come from Florida and people that have come from South Africa were the first time I ever really heard about South Africa I was on my way there and I stepped into a travel agency in in Switzerland to catch a buy a ticket for South Africa and my wife my family there and I step in here's a little calendar just a little Week calendar and I looked at that calendar and on the bottom it was printed there so it could never change it's sunny today in South Africa I never forgot that it's as real as it's as real as I'm looking at it right now and I said Within Myself that's a the Bold statement they're very certain of their weather it's sunny today in South Africa and uh I can say I have found it cloudy and cold too but nevertheless and I say to myself is it all right we're just a family here this morning I say why do people move here why do you come here why don't you stay where it's sunny but you know what I'm not God I'm not a prophet nor a son of a prophet but when I see you know God put something in somebody's heart I don't know what why he's moving them and shifting them around I don't know I just leave that up to him but I know one thing the outer court and whether the sun is shining the prophet's saying we're we're you know out there if the Sun was shining you're feeling good and if it's not shining you're not feeling good but that that isn't where we dwell that's not where we live and that's not the the message came to provide us he didn't come to provide us with an environment that's dictated to by you know our exterior environment you folks might as well say Amen this is absolutely the message and I'm not talking just about the weather I'm talking about our our circumstances and the environment around us we have to know he said he walks by daylight someday has gloomy days some days you do not know whether it's really worthwhile to serve God or not you're walking in the outer court so you're eating Mana sure you're a Believer sure you have eternal life sure and if you die you go to heaven but what kind of life are you living every day you get out there oh I got my dandruff up today maybe you don't know that terminology but that was been you know got really you know upset I told them about it I cussed them out I couldn't help it God forgive me sure he will certainly he will you're his child but what kind of life you living comes to it the second time he says my don't you hate to live that kind of life I'm talking to somebody here says I hate that kind of life I'm up I'm down I you know the flesh gets the best of me he says and he says in the trouble and that you pull day and night back sliding back to church back sliding back to church this that apologizing to this over here this fellow's just blooming all right along you see saying I'm in and I'm out when he just says I'm up and down I I'm back no I'm in Victory I'm back no I'm in Victory I I I see people like that I'm here to tell you today I'm your friend I'm here to tell you today you don't have to have that I'm here to tell you today isn't that good news isn't that good news for somebody here you don't have to be on the bottom you can feel on the bottom but you don't have to be there you're not ordained to live there out of Fellowship into fellow ship you're not ordained for that you're not made for that Hallelujah you're not made for defeat some say I've heard the odd criticism against our ministry here they say it's too positive let me just tell you plus all the critics that might say that we're not nearly as positive as the prophet said we should be because I have all kinds of negative things come by my way and I spend too much time on it because it you know it bothers you and it troubles you and so on you get burdened and you've got to stop it when it's just a burden on your heart and don't let it uh occupy your mind and start affecting your life because I don't like that kind of life and he says what kind of life you living I want to live when he talks about just steady all the time blooming all the time Victory all the time love all the time that's what he said and that's what I say is a posit positive message I'm going to make that confession you need to make that confession that life is my life that's what God purposed for me all right that's the outer court and that's the if the description fits you should make a clear-cut decision to move I don't care whether you move here or where you move physically that's irrelevant now I just want to go for a short moment to the to the next to the next place and that is probably should have spent a little more time on it but the that Spirit realm or in the Tabernacle was the Holy place and then brother Bram says well he comes into the court now what's in there there's seven golden candlesticks and by by that Holy place and it's giving light so now he he said it's a better light the candlesticks are giving light and that's to the man he quits his drinking quits his smoking quits lying quits stealing treats his neighbor right good to his wife or her good to her husband in the same way a man or a woman the believer he comes into a place where he's quick with all his meanness which is through the blood of sanctification he's called to a new life and he walks in there see he's moved he's walked in there he doesn't have to walk by the light out there whether the sun is shining whether it's gloomy whether whether whether he just lost his job or got fired or all the environment or whatever is happening in school whether you passed with a or you barely got through by the skin of your teeth or whatever happened out there that's irrelevant to this man cuz he's not he's he's got another light he doesn't have to walk by the light out there he's got a better light he's walking by the Light of the seven golden candlesticks which is burning olive oil and the olive oil was representing the Holy Spirit the fire was the baptism which brought baptizing so now this man has moved and you know a lot of people in the message just want to stay there that's all they want to stay are he baptized with Holy Ghost are you baptized with the Holy Ghost let me tell you something you're not into the you're not into the next Department yet you're not into the holy of holies yet you can have the gift of the baptism of the Holy Spirit but remember still just a gift brother Bram said to me he says this took a pen out of his pocket he said this is a gift of the Holy Ghost but this is not the Holy Ghost the very person of the Holy Ghost can I say it again something that you all know well justification made way for San s ification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself the person of God himself coming and dwelling in your being and so now this person has a better light brought into baptizing or even baptized right in there by the Holy Spirit but you're not hid away yet yet you're not behind the veil so if anyone comes to you and even during this convention to come and and that's that's as far as I oh you need to be baptized with the Holy Spirit I find people use that to destabilized people I'm telling you I'm giving you some sound instruction some people are are rather forward and maybe intimidating and say you think you have the Holy Ghost someone says that to you you let check down your heart look up right in their eye and their face and say I certainly do what do you got because often people will use that tactic to destabilize a person say say well uh uh say I got something for you I got a special Doctrine I got a special Revelation and all you need is this you know what I'm talking about you want to know where you're standing and know what you have and don't be ashamed of it and say I certainly do I've been birthed by this word and has been I've been birthed by the word and by the spirit Hallelujah quickly now but he says even in here here here's the problem with this place but there's days when those lights get dull there's days when the lamps smoke and the light's not so good there's times time when those lights have to be relitigated and you have to borrow a little from a neighbor to Light One Candle to the other it's still not a good light we're thankful for it but it's still not the right light I'd like to say this to conclude these two courts in these two courts the outer court and the inner cour Court these are two places where the battle really rages in the mind because the mind has not come the the the channels of the spirit are still very active I hope I can get this across to you the memory and the imagination and the conscience and the reasoning and the affection all the affection can do serious damage and all of those five channels I want to say to this congregation without any apology every one of us are afflicted in those channels if we allow Satan now he will use every opportunity that he possibly can he will use every device he will use every circumstance to get into one of those channels and begin to cause you distress and to occupy your thoughts and to keep you captivated by it the prophet said the Holy Spirit needs to blow those channels out and you know when he says it that way I I gather from that that he's not saying it in a very a delicate way he's not saying it you know we just need to have a new flow and we just need to have something nice happen he's saying the Holy Spirit needs to blow those channels out we need a blast from God he tries to he tries to cabbage down he tries to get his roots down and he needs to be removed he doesn't go simply he doesn't go just you know by invitation he has to be driven out I hope this means something to you now the Prophet said that this battle which was in heaven and you know this so well it's from the greatest battle ever fought this battle which was between the angels in heaven and Satan was cast out to the Earth he said when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual Place meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and this word I don't want you to forget it and for for this battle to rage for this battle to rage and that Battlegrounds began in the human mind your mind is a mutual Battle Ground that's been selected and both and Satan has a right there to that ground and the Warfare will take place in that ground and I say that that really rages in the outer court and in the inner Court those two courts is where this battle really rages you say well what is the answer I'm going to dwell on it now for just the next till I close when you move on if you're in that place and the mind has been engaged in a raging battle this way and that way and reasoning this and thinking that brother Ed is telling you today you need to pack up your bags and in this case I say leave your bags behind you need to make a clear-cut decision I am moving I am not going to live there any longer listen folks I'm not preaching a sermon I am giving instruction which I believe is from the Holy Spirit people in this congregation you need to say I am moving from that place I've had a mental Warfare on and you might say well just because I going to the holy of holies does do I do I lose my mind do I do I lose my thinking capacity no but in the holy of holies you become so absorbed so penetrated because there's a presence there that the holy spir in that presence that Satan cannot live in that presence he cannot live in that presence he doesn't have a right to that presence I'm going to go to the one and I've called this service this morning entering into his rest and now we come to the inner rest the holiest of all it's a real place and this is what Paul's whole subject's about he said they couldn't enter in because of unbelief if you have believed or attempted to believe in this service at any moment this is the moment now you need to really come to grips and saying oh God send your Holy Spirit and let me become so sensitized that I will grasp now every word this is where I need need to move into the pastor saying this is the purpose of this service and it is it is shake off see I can sense that even now Satan wants to you know uh kind of make make make our minds kind of dull and so on and so forth you shake that off you resist him now say I came here for this purpose I came here to do business with God I'm not going to allow this spirit to affect me at all I don't care where it comes from I'm not going to allow it I'm not going to allow it if you sense it beside you say in within yourself I resist that in the name of Jesus Christ I have conquering power within me over that Hallelujah here's the inner rest here's the person here's the prophet's description of the inner rest is not tossed about does not run from place to place doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things says sickness may come disappointments may come there isn't a person here that's us friends there isn't a person here that hasn't had disappointments hasn't had sicknesses come and this man this woman that's in there has had all of these things they don't fuss they don't fume they don't worry about things and he says this now I'm coming to the real Crux of my message this morning the thing that's really burning on my heart and I'm determined before God that this is going to be conveyed to you and it'll be off my hands and the holy spirit's going to bring it to your mind he says but the Christians at rest he keeps saying that the Christian is at rest it's the rest that Paul is speaking about there remain that some must enter into this rest it's for us I identify I say Apostle Paul you're prophesying about me in this day of distress in this day of violence in this day of inequities in this day when we travel around the world I tell you what you know I I got distressed I had some distress not the kind that I'm just preaching about but I had some distress within my heart while in usbekistan people earn $30 a month an average salary is $70 a month average salary a very well-paid person is $150 a month and before I left before I went there I just felt in my heart I I W would like to do something the poor have always been on my heart and I see children and I see them in slums and say I want to do something for them you know it's it's not easy I said to a minister I said to a pastor and I just related it the other day I I said to a pastor we were traveling on an airplane sitting beside me a good pastor this message I call him by his name because he's a good friend I said I'm going to ask you a question and I don't want you to answer me too soon I want you to really think this out and when you're done I like your answer right now here's a million dollar cash I'm putting it in your hands you have a million dollar cash for the gospel for the message you have a million dollars cash I want you to tell me what you're going to do with that he thought and he thought and he thought some more he finally said I don't know I don't know what i' do with it I said that's a dilemma isn't it you know something friends I have actually looked for people that would be real trustworthy men that could make sound decisions outside of their own environment outside of themselves say help these people and I did see a man I found a man a man who's had a hard time a man who's lived a hard life a man who's who Satan has almost destroyed him now he's married and he's got one or two little children and I I've I've determined in my heart I'm going to help that man he's living with two other families in a small apartment but you know what when you want to do good the scripture says evil is present with you when I would do good evil is present with you it's not easy to even determine I'm going to make a move I'm going to be decisive I'm going to make a move and if somebody of you here got a whole lot better advice and a lot better counsel I'd be happy to talk to you I say that with all sincerity and this congregation based on um a main thrust we want to help people this message is a blessed blessed thing but getting it out to people is not a simple thing it's not a simple matter but I will not be deterred from getting something that's fed my soul to someone else that to feed their soul oh they say well they speak another language and I won't let that hinder me you we won't let that hinder us we'll get it to them someway somehow are you with me and I appreciate people that we're going to live this life and and do whatever we can so these people and now he says and I I've got to get to this just give me about 10 more minutes and I'm going to close he said but the Christians at rest knowing this that God God's able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow let me start with that and let let you say Amen there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ there's nothing and that's why that person who's in there now get this here it is moving from the outer Court he the weather's this my job is this my marks is this so and and and we're affected by that move into the other place we got a better light oh I feel the Holy Spirit and and and but then it kind of you know the flame goes out and and it smokes up and and uh we find out that that's not a perfect light and then we find that there's another place the difference between the outer court and the inner Court there is a knowledge it's called a knowing when a person gets into that in and you get into that presence you know something that you couldn't know out there and out there there's a a special knowing those of you that are married you try to tell someone who's unmarried what it's all about can't really do it say the only way to know the only way you can really know is you get married and you'll know you never had children don't have children don't have children you can never really know what it is till you have them and when that Mother's gone through childbirth and holds that baby and the father is there and then they bring up that child you see it grow up through life try explain that try to give a scientific formula there is no formula until you've done it and there is no special formula that I can give you what it's like to be in that place but I can tell you you'll know something when you come in the presence of the almighty God that you'll never know anywhere else there's a knowing and that's why the Apostle John could say we know that we are of God how did he know that he'd been in that place we know we're born of God how could he say that he'd been in that presence no wonder the Apostle could say for the which cause Apostle Paul I also suffer these things nevertheless I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day knowing and the Apostle John said but we know by this we know that we are the children of God and he said and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition whereever we desired of him he said again 5:18 we know that whatsoever whosoever is born of God sinth not 1 John 5:19 and we know that we are of God and the whole world lith in wickedness 1 John 5:20 and we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true the prophet said the veil dropped behind you the noise of the world and when the veil drops behind you and you experience this special place I'm speaking to every person here all the voices you're alone with God and all the voices the voices of your friends the voices of your family we hear voices every day and some of them we need that filter of the veil some of them we shouldn't shouldn't hit our ears and our sent you'll have to be the judge quickly how do I move into this hidden Place how do I move I really wrestled with this because I wanted to bring it to you before I close how do I move into this hidden place you say brother brandom we've got a picture here under consideration but how do you get to it what's the next thing how how do we get in there here's the way you come in in the pattern anything that was dead lived when it came in that presence took Aaron's rod and the prophet said and notice when they put Aaron's rod in there it budded blossomed and bore fruit that's the whole cycle of life regardless of what state you're in or where you're at or what position you're at you move into that place regardless of how dead you may feel how untouched you may feel how unconscious you might feel to God this morning I have news for you I'm inviting you the holy spirit's inviting you you move into that place and the prophet said you are a stick every man woman child here is a stick of some kind and you're taking off the branch of humanity which God has created God created his son in the beginning you may be fallen you may be dead you may be alienated from God but by that in creation you were created a Son of God you may bounce around and be respected and honored out there in in the courts out here you may bounce around he says and be respected but if you ever get into the Glorious place and hit away with God you'll yield to what you're supposed to do so you take a dead sinner alienated from God without hope without Christ and put him in that presence in this great glorious Tabernacle in there he will yield fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy peace longsuffering he'll yield those he says we come in and here's how we come in number one by refreshing yourself in a quiet time with God this life is very busy I don't have to tell you your life's busy my life's busy but the times that God is most near to me me is when I get alone alone not with my wife in a car not out where I'm seeing all kinds of people I get alone all alone and begin to talk to him and tell him just exactly what do you say brother Ed well sometimes I feel like a I feel like a a dead post you feel like that sometime yeah I feel like that so what do you say to him well I get down lord I just feel like a stick of wood I feel like a I feel like a fence post I feel like a telephone pole I don't feel anything I know that you're real and I start thinking now about the various little places that he met me and I begin to rehearse those I remember back there it was a real difficult time but I know it was you I know it was you I never made it on my own I know that you met me back there and then there was another time later in my life and I knew that was you I knew it was you nothing could do that but you there was a time when it seemed that all hell came against me ready to tear everything up but you gave me a word you know something friends you don't do that very long you start telling him and thanking him and his presence would just come and Surround you begin to move through you and permeate you and you enter into a relationship are things any different outside no not necessarily but they're different inside and you have a new found strength you have a new found that relationship invalidates what the weather is and what the job is and what the finances are and what's happening in the church and what's happening in this person or that person we have great burdens but that presence invalidates it it over comes it it gives you strength beyond that and with this I close brother brandham told a story he told it 38 times story is about you all know it well but I saw something I've never seen in all my years the story is of the slave broker that was buying slaves and he came to this traiter and he sees a young man that is very very different than the others and brother brandham says slave broker said I'll take him no he said he's not for sale he said but he's so different he's so different from all the others what makes him different he said do you feed him different no he said eats the Dame eats the same Mana the man the Elder Court eats the same Mana the man in the inner Court eats the same Mana as the man who's in the Holy place they all eat the same Mana says eats the same food eats in the galley do you do you treat him different do you treat him better no the man in the Holy place he has troubles and the Man in the inner Court he has troubles and the Man in the outer Court they all have their troubles do they worship in a different place no they all
