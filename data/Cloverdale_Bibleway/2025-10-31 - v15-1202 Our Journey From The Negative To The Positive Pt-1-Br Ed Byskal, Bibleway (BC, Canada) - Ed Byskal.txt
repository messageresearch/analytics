[music] He's coming. &gt;&gt; It might not be while we're in this this service, but he's coming. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Why don't we stand together?

Why don't we just [music] sing as we're going to read a couple of prayer requests tonight? Word of God, speak. Would you fall down [music] like rain? making our eyes to see. We want to behold his majesty tonight. Amen. [music] We've got a number of prayer requests. Brother Mike Gier, would you mind coming and open the service for us tonight, Brother Mike? Appreciate that. [music] Want to remember uh Sister Bev, this is from Sister Luis Wood. Her mother is not well, may not [music] live long. Just ask that the Lord would have his way in the family. William Smouts to remember Holly's [music] brother Scott in need of prayer. He has AIDS. Most of all, he needs salvation. [music] Uh there's a girlfriend that also needs prayer. Her [music] heart seems to be softening towards the things of God. So, we just want to remember that need tonight. Sister Clara Woman asks us to [music] remember Sister Anga Stefan Hagen. She's in the hospital in Edmonton with severe pain in her bones. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The doctors say her bones are actually collapsing. So, we want to remember that need tonight. I want to remember Jonathan [music] Frey at home tonight. He was exposed to some fumes at work. Uh they need [music] to have him take a test to see if he was exposed to anything hazardous. We're just asking that all of the tests [music] show no exposure to anything dangerous. Amen. We believe that. Brother [music] Jose Rosales wants to uh remember a friend's wife who's been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, only has six months to live. Pray that God will move on the scene spiritually [music] and naturally for that family. Also want to remember sister uh Connie Spencer, [music] brother Ron Spencer's wife. We all know the family very well here. U she's having some [music] tests done and uh a biopsy and one of her lungs collapsed I believe today and very painful. They're just waiting [music] for the lung to reinflate again. But that's not an easy process to go through for anybody. So, we want to remember, Sister Connie, that the Lord, the great physician [music] himself, would step into the situation. Amen. We also want to remember a old soldier of the cross, [music] brother Jackie Benton, in uh um he's there in [music] Elizabeth, Tennessee at brother Donnie Reagan's church. How many know the name Jackie Benton? Probably very few. [music] just a handful. Uh I was probably four years old when he was [music] preaching in a house meetings that I I didn't know I was attending, but I was there and [music] he came to the hospital when we were at Children's in Philadelphia with David several years [music] ago. And uh it was incredible. He recounted things that I had no recollection of remembering. And [music] at four years old, you don't remember things. But God has a a plan. God has a mind. And he sees [music] time. and all of those things are really fade when it comes to God things. We just want to remember [music] brother Jackie tonight. He's having I think a back procedure operation. So, we just ask that [music] the Lord would have his gentle hand on the case. Brother Mike, if you have a need [music] upon your heart, why don't you lift it up before the Lord as we go to prayer this evening? Let's bow our hearts. our precious heavenly [music] father. Lord, we're so thankful that we can call you our father. [music] Lord, where would we be Lord if he had not come for us? Oh God, what a privilege Lord, [music] we thank you, Lord, that we could find ourselves in the house of God tonight. And Lord, that we could [music] come to you, Lord. Many hearts burdened, Lord, many needs. Lord, you've heard each one that was read. You knew the heart as it was pinned down, Lord Jesus. Father, you are the author and the finisher of our faith, Lord God. And we would ask you, Lord, as we would bind our hearts together now, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would rise up on the scene, Lord, for these requests, Lord. You are a mighty God, Lord Jesus. Lord, you have left us apart to do, [music] Father. You asked us to pray, Lord. These requests have come before the bride of Jesus Christ, Lord. And we bring them before you. We place them in your lap, Lord Jesus. We know that you are more than able, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just commit him into your hands. We rest, Lord Jesus, in the promise, Lord, that we ask anything in your name, we shall have it, Lord. And we are more than two or three agreeing here, Lord Jesus. Lord, we know that it is finished and we thank you for it, oh [music] God. We turn our hearts now to the word, Lord Jesus. We look forward [music] to hearing from you once again through our pastor, Lord Jesus. And we ask you, Lord, that you would give him voice, that you would give him strength, Lord Jesus. That Lord, that you would quicken his mind, oh God. [music] that he would be able to deliver the word, Lord Jesus. And Father, would you do the same for our hearts, Lord, open us up, Lord Jesus. Lord, massage our heart, Lord. Make it soft unto you, Lord Jesus, that your word that could have its entrance, oh God, and that we would grow, Lord. Lord, that we could become like you, Lord Jesus. We love you, Father. Lord, you hear the voice of your people, Lord. [music] It is just so good, Lord, to hear the saints praying, Lord, and worshiping you, Lord Jesus. Tender hearts before you, Lord, lifting up holy hands, oh God. We bless your name. We praise you, Lord. We thank you, Father. [music] Great things you have done, Lord. Have your way this evening, Lord Jesus. [music] We commit ourselves to you and we thank you for these things in your precious and holy name, Lord Jesus Christ. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God [singing] speak. Word you pull down like [music] rain, causing my [singing] eyes to see your [music] majesty. Be still [singing] and [music] you're in this place. Peace [singing] and be [music] in [singing] your holiness. [music] [singing] You pour out my bra. [music and singing] My eyes see your [music] peace. I know [singing] your angels. [music and singing] Please let me stay in [singing] your holiness [music] word. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. You may have [music] your seats. We'll turn the service right to brother Biscll if he's ready to come. Let's sing together number 995. Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. Amen. You love the Lord tonight. It's good to [music] have each and every one of you here this evening. Holy [music and singing] word, long reserved for our [music] [singing] in this world. It is [music] with God [singing] more than the word of God. [singing] Their [music] words are their words. [singing] [music] Thank you. My soul is [singing] in this world. [music] [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [singing] [music] Earth [singing] and he says [music] [singing] [music] [music and singing] [singing and music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] Heat. Heat. [music] Holy. [music and singing] [music] I guess I don't need that. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another good Wednesday evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to start [music] the service just a little bit different. I'm I'm going to uh going to read a [music] prayer that brother Brandham prayed and uh and he he he read the repeated the words of the song. Blessed Savior, thou will guide us [music] till we reach that blissful shore where the angels wait to join us [music] in his praise forever more. Maybe we'll just stand and and we can sing that. Those of you that know it and those that don't know it, hum along and you'll know it the second time. [music] Can we get the words up? Just [music] I was the only one in the study that really was acquainted with it. And uh then when I began to kind of rasp it out uh yeah, they'd heard it before. And uh brother John used his uh technical skills and found it's in the sound book. Up to that time I told him I said I thought the train was going backwards. It's uh life is like a a mountain railway. That's the name of the song. But we're not going to sing the verses and we're not interested in the railroad or this evening. We're just going to sing blessed Savior, thou will guide us. How many here know it? That's what I thought. [laughter] All right, I'll depend on you to really lift it up on that first first note. All right, blessed Savior starts up high. [music] Blessed Savior, [singing] thou will [music] guide us till we reach our [music] place for sure [singing] where the angels [singing] wait to join us in [music] thy gra for [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; we [music] will show where the [music] in [singing] forever Yeah. [music] [singing] [music] [music] [singing] forever. [music] Brother Brandham quotes those lines just before he prays or it's in his prayer and while you're standing I'll just read the rest of it that [music] and the the service was life story. That was his life story. And he says, uh, that's the words of the poet, and we love thee today, Lord. We realize that men [music] that men that have ever amounted to anything on earth were men [music] who trusted you. You thrilled the hearts of the poet, [music] the heart of the poet, spoke to your church, made the [music] weary to be happy. This is what we're gathered here for tonight. You've made the weary to be happy, the lost saved, the sick to be well, those without hope are given a hope and given us such a great promise that there's a and then he stops. He said, "This is just the negative." And this is what I'm going to be speaking on. This is just the negative, [music] the shadow. And someday that death shall develop [music] the picture from the negative to the positive. And I want to speak on our journey from the negative to the positive. And when we go through the terrible acid of death, then we'll know as we're known and see face to face. And while we're here, Lord, today preparing ourselves by singing psalms and testifying and reading thy word, we pray that you will meet with us. And grant [music] today that if there be any here who does not know thee, that they will become thy servant today. And I I certainly pray that. And we pray that you will just bless us together. And may the Holy Spirit now just get a hold of every heart and dear God [music] as I fear the moment to go back down through the long bloody [music] tear stained journey that I traveled and review that over in my heart again. My heart is troubled. [music] But then when I think of it, I think of the song Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost [music] but now I'm found. Was blind but now I see. Now Lord help us today. And [music] may may the Holy Spirit be here and bless us in this gathering for we ask it in the name of the beloved child Jesus. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're just going to have a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, [clears throat] how we thank you for these words and how we thank you for the inspiration that you gave as a prophet of God said to the poet and [music] he penned some words down. Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us. How true those words are. And tonight we we revel in it, Lord. We our confidence is unshakable. [music] We thank you, Father. While the world is wrestling with insoluble problems here, yet we have a Christ that is the answer to every one of our questions in our heart, oh God. And even when we have questions that you do not answer, [music] we know that even your silence is an answer because you're the beloved one of eternity. And as we approach [music] a subject this evening, Lord, I pray that you will bless the people. Give us open hearts, oh God. And as I open my mouth to speak, put words there, Father. [music] Words that are fitted and suited and made for your children. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you. [music] Thank you, musicians. And brother Ryan, I want to read from the book of Acts, chapter 1. We'll just read from the first verse. [clears throat] Nice to have you all here this evening and we pray that God will certainly uh bless us together. The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen, to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. And being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which says he, "You have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." God bless you. You may have your seats. I was just uh inspired by some uh words that brother Brandham had spoke and I want to share those with you. Um I have some slides a little later on [clears throat] but I want to take this subject and this is all uh preparatory to the subject. I want you to think about it. Our journey from the negative to the positive. The other day I was inspired. I I left the platform while either brother John or brother Tim were preaching and I just went into the study for a few moments. Um, I took a big full scap pad and I began to write. And I I was just going to put down one thought that I had for [clears throat] this evening. And I I I just I wrote till that whole page was full. And I turned it over and continued to write a few more lines. And uh I just I had to read it over to my wife. I felt so inspired while and those moments do come. Not often enough, but they do come. And so, um, [clears throat] that isn't the basis of of, uh, what I want to say tonight, but it is, uh, the essence of it. We've got some of the the same thoughts. So, I I I want to, uh, have you ponder this our journey from the negative to the positive. uh [clears throat] in the in the message of uncertain of God or rather the uncertain sound it is. He said uh and talking about uh the people said you've got to tell him that he's a son of God born for the kingdom of God and he is somebody. This is just a negative picture, a negative waiting to be developed someday. And death is the only thing that can develop it. When you die out to yourself, &gt;&gt; so you don't have to die physically, but when you die out to yourself, a new picture starts on the inside. And then that new creature, Christ Jesus, begins to show itself through. And one of these days, he will come and receive you up up to himself. And then the whole thing will be changed. And then this negative shadow will become a positive. &gt;&gt; Now this this may just be for one here, one over there and so on. But uh I that's why I'm giving as as much material as I am. Now in sers this s we would see Jesus not ser at the time but sers we would see Jesus in in Dallas, Texas. Now if if you were in his thinking at the beginning, if you've got eternal life, there is only one form of eternal life. Eternal life had no beginning and it has no ending. So if you have eternal life, you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him. &gt;&gt; I thought that was a tremendous statement. When there was when there was uh before there was anything but him. Your form, your shape, and what you're in now is just a negative. When you come up to around 20, 22 years old, you were a negative and death develops the picture to the positive. That when this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have one already. waiting and then I went to the scripture that we have read and then Jesus said in Luke's gospel you won't have to turn to it I'm just read one verse Luke 11 and2 and he said unto them when you pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in the earth Um so uh I'm I'm just starting off this our our journey in this negative time. Uh the prophet said that there are only two kingdoms. There's only two powers. So now we're we're either journeying in one or the other. But he said, "Do you realize that there is really only two powers in all the universe?" Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a lot big space. Of all of our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything, it amounts up to two powers. I understand that there's almost 200 the leaders of almost 200 nations that were have been meeting in Paris and they're wrestling with you know climate change and the environment and trying to make hey God's going to make it exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's what the millennium's all about. But you know the problem is they don't know the language of the Bible. They haven't made themselves familiar with the Bible. They're studying all kinds of other scientific things. And and this prophet would tell them exactly where that science is going to take them. It's going to take them to more death. The more advanced they will become, but they're using that as a as a recipe and it'll never never happen. It won't happen. I'm not negative about that. I'm very very positive because I believe it's going to happen. Only not the way that they are are wrestling with it. but they can't seem to come to a solution. And I was listening to I was listening to uh a a another he wasn't a scientist, but he was a reporter of some kind. And he just flashed back many many decades ago. They were talking about the environment then. It's not a new problem. [laughter] It's just not a new problem at all. But they're seeking to come up with solutions. And so I say even the wise men of the world and intellectual people and men of power and men of leadership qualities, they're wrestling with things. Friends, we need to be very very thankful that we have a promise. And it says there's only two powers in the universe of all of our differences between nations because they can't get them all on site even now. And there were and and this was 62. So 40 years ago they couldn't get everybody on side and differences between each other and everything. It all mounts up to two powers. There's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms. Two powers and two kingdoms. All the rest, the little minor things are connected with either one of those powers. And those powers is God's power and Satan's power. You know, everybody here needs to take that paragraph and just merge it right down into your home environment. &gt;&gt; Say, whatever we're wrestling with, whatever we're deciding on, whatever we're trying to come to, we have to realize and we need to accept that there's only two powers we're dealing with. And it's it's one or the other. It's one or the other. In in Timothy, Paul said speaking uh he said, "Who hath saved us and called us?" So saved us number one, called us number two, with a holy calling. Number three, not according to our works. Number four, but according to his own purpose and grace. Number five, which was given us in Christ before the world began. &gt;&gt; So that's where it was given. It was given us in Christ. And that's why it was taking last in even in the last services that brother Brandham says, "Let's just have a little drama." And uh there's uh God who fills all time and space and you could go back billions and trillions of years. We can't he said it's too mysterious. He couldn't even reveal himself. He cannot. So how did he do it? He said that one of his attributes and here how we thank God do we have a a prophet of God that stood here and could get into the mind of God and and bring it right down here into language we could understand. I thank God that he only had a seventh grade education. You know, I thank God it was spoken of in such simplicity because Jesus when he was here, that was one of the things that people stumbled at that he spoke the gutal language of the poor which was the Galilean language and he assembled with Galilean people. I'm not pointing to you as Galileans, but he assembled with the with just the you know the the poor have the gospel preached to them. Thank God we're basic enough just to believe what he said. &gt;&gt; We come from humble beginnings and and we stay that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. So long before you arrived here, this was given you. &gt;&gt; Long before your your forefathers ever thought of it. Long before America was discovered, long before mankind struggle, all these I've been reading through uh Samuel and David's wars and it was just incredible. &gt;&gt; They were in warfare all the time, &gt;&gt; and you just wonder where it's going. But you should read uh uh David's Thanksgiving to God. And I even marveled. I marveled. I read it yesterday or day before. I just read it and I just marveled how that man was so inspired. No wonder he was a man after God's own heart because he he says the same thing so many different ways and he glorifies God and he worships God. And that's what God loves is worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so he said that was in Christ Jesus that was given us in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus before the world began. So you are an attribute of God's thinking before the world ever was created. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, that that gets, you know, that gets way up here someplace. And uh I don't want to lose you. Uh and that life, I think I have this. I've got some quotes here. And that life that was in his thinking of you is in you now. He said, and I'm going to read that. A greater than Solomon is here. This is 1964. A greater than Solomon's here. Your name was put on God's book. Now, I'm going to try to follow exactly what the prophet said. You tell the son of God, you are a son of God &gt;&gt; and that you were in his thinking &gt;&gt; and that you have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And if you don't, that's God's business. But I'm saying this is what he's told us to say. &gt;&gt; Tell him that he's the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tell him we come to the house of God. This is where burdens are released. This is where the depressed are changed. This is where things I don't know how you came in the doors, but I don't expect you to go out the same way. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm standing here. Lord, &gt;&gt; your name [clears throat] was put in God's book before the lamb was slain when his program was laid out. The whole thing you were you were recognized in that program &gt;&gt; because you got eternal life. The word eternal never did begin and never can it end. And you are an attribute of God's thinking before the world was ever created. So, we're going back a long ways &gt;&gt; before the world was ever created. Uh, and that's the only way that you can have eternal life. And that life that was his thinking of you is in you. Now, I have to take these very slowly. And that life and that life that he was thinking of you, I don't care how he phrased it. It may not be grammarally correct by your learning, but it certainly is correct by heaven's learning. &gt;&gt; And that life that he was thinking of you is in you now. &gt;&gt; And there is no way to separate it. It's there to stay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's enough to rejoice about. And there's no way to separate it. There isn't enough demons in hell to separate it and it's there to stay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the uncertain sound again he says you came out of eternity. You stepped into a little space called time. You go out of time into eternity. And what you are in your soul as you go out the same you will be in perfection. In the message perfection he said before the world was ever formed you were placed in Christ. So in Christ you're called &gt;&gt; in Christ uh you're saved. In Christ, you have God's purpose and his grace which was given to you and given to us in Christ Jesus before the world was. That's why I'm going back here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. All you have to do is accept it. &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it. We were placed in Christ. And then here's the quote I was asking you about. I found it in the unveiling of God. I've been trying to find this for some time and so I spent some time so I can share it with you. In the unveiling of God, he said that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation. So now we'll just describe it from Genesis to Revelation. Here's the whole picture in just a few words. Isn't that nice? It's nothing wrong. It's Elohim materializing so he can be touched feel. And in the millennium there is Elohim. That's where that's where you're heading. And in the millennium, there's Elohim sitting on the throne with all of his subjects around him &gt;&gt; that he predestinated before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So now, isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; And there's Elohim with all of his subjects around him. All those subjects, all those subjects once were this great eternal being who the prophet said no one could understand. No one can he can't even reveal himself to it. He had to come and become a son of man. So because he had an attribute of fatherhood &gt;&gt; and then the apostle Paul says that he could through him through Christ he would bring many sons &gt;&gt; to glory. So we were in Christ. &gt;&gt; We were in Christ. &gt;&gt; And and when when the son came when uh that from the bosom of the father, he's the only one that could be the lamb. &gt;&gt; That attribute of savior was in in god. And so he had to become a son. And that was his attribute. And because of that attribute, there'll be many subjects that will be gathered around Elohim &gt;&gt; as he's and and one day one day it was only a thought. And God wasn't satisfied with just having his own thoughts. He wasn't satisfied with being alone just with his own thoughts. &gt;&gt; You know, when you get you get by yourself and you get buried deep in your own thoughts, you know, that's a pretty lonely spot really. It's pretty lonely spot. You want fellowship and you want friends and you want somebody to speak with and interact with and and someone who can understand you. We all crave that. &gt;&gt; And there we there he is with all of his subjects around him and that he predestinated before the foundation of the world. I have a question. What what kind of being would God be if he were not able to fulfill his purpose &gt;&gt; and have his subjects gathered around him? What kind of God would we be s would we be serving? &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, he's a great God, but now I I want to bring it down." And he'll have his subjects gathered around him. We're here this evening because you wanted to come to church and we're here together and we'll shake hands and pro. But is that if that's all that if that's all that Christianity was, it'd be pretty empty. &gt;&gt; We've got we've got to have some objective. We got to have some purpose. We got to have something that's uh you know intensely real to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what kind of a a [clears throat] being would it be if we if he was not able to fulfill his purpose and have his subjects gathered around him in his kingdom. In the chronicles, David blessed the Lord. The Bible says in chapter 29, "Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation, and David said, blessed be the Lord God of Israel our father forever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is made it it is it is to make great and to give strength unto all. But I can tell you, we're talking about our journey now, and I'll be filling a lot of gaps in between now and Sunday, Lord willing. But when the lamb took the book, when the lamb took the book, this attribute that came from God when he claimed the book, the one that had the substance in him &gt;&gt; to erase your sin. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The one that had the power in him to transform you. &gt;&gt; From a rascal &gt;&gt; to a son of God. &gt;&gt; The one that had the power over your mind and over your thoughts. The one that could bring you right next to the throne of Elohim. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. &gt;&gt; Things that have happened and things that are yet to happen. But when he came and took the book and that is a many many messages have been preached on it. The ministers of the message preaching on it because the messenger made that very very real and your name was in the book. He says the book is the Bible in one place. He says the book is is where your names were put. And uh and Jesus said himself that every deed and every word that we speak would be accountable. Well, we wouldn't want the screen to come down and and and recall every thought that even we thought today. We we wouldn't want it displayed in front. But he who had the substance within him which was eternal life. And that life was greater than any unbelief. &gt;&gt; That life was greater than any transgression. If it wasn't, what kind of God is he? He's greater than any demon of force, any force of darkness. He's greater than any darkness. He's greater than any temptation that ever came your way. And what is in your heart? That's the main thing. What's in your heart? And I thought of that that uh uh man that came before brother Brennan. And and I I I said to these brothers right here where we were in the study. I said, "If this man came up to be prayed for, I doubt that any one of us would pray for him." And that and it really and I'm glad, brother Tim, that you picked it up and t and spoke on it. And brother Brown said, "You love Jesus." &gt;&gt; That was the key. You you love Jesus. If you had crossed the line, if you had blasphemed, if you had you were beyond forgiveness, you'd hate Jesus. But you love Jesus. And it took that uncovering and unveiling to bring that man to an acceptance of that. And then there was nothing impossible. &gt;&gt; And there I'm standing and brother Tim is taking the picture with him 62 years to the day. &gt;&gt; It was November the 8th and we were standing there on Sunday, November the 8th. 62 years to the day and the man is gloriously saved. WHAT WAS ACHIEVED AT that moment? &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED? SURELY WE OUGHT TO SAY PRAISE GOD FOR HIM. PRAISE GOD. THAT THAT THAT THAT MAN HAS HAD 62 YEARS OF BLISS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. 62 YEARS of the negative coming to the positive. &gt;&gt; And he took the book. And when the lamb took the book, I have just said, and this is the feeling of my heart this evening, which I'm going to be sharing with you very personally, heaven couldn't hold itself any longer. couldn't hold its silence any longer. The only one that came out of the bosom of the father had the solution to redeem the fallen attributes. There was he was the only one that could redeem the fallen attributes. And God's purpose was he's going to be he's going to be seated as a king in a kingdom and a subject's going to be gathered around him. Not going to be gathered in Bible way or any other message church or not going to be gathered any place. There may be people around there that you didn't dream were going to be there. But whoever was in his in his mind, whoever was in his attribute is going to be gathered. He's going to be gathered with his subjects &gt;&gt; by his grace. I want to be there &gt;&gt; by his grace. The prophet of God want to be something to be seated with the apostles and seated with the early church and seated with all those saints of the early years. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And no wonder says to redeem the fallen attributes and turn the negatives into positives and to bring from darkness to light. And so the scripture tells us and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, your name in the book that was in the thoughts of God that was an attribute within his bosom and and and Christ came out and from him from that logos from that word that came out, he's going to allow that word to be revealed. He's going to allow that word to be spoken. Going to allow that word to uh call you to pick your heart. Hallelujah. And even those that was had their heart pricricked and said, "What men and brethren, what must we do to be saved?" Those whoever came, if they ever were there, they were there then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen. And when he took the book, and when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb. That was some action. They fell down before the lamb, every one of them having harps and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy." &gt;&gt; We sing a song, but we ought to, if we sing it after the service this evening, we ought to sing it as they sang it. Thou art worthy, oh God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO RECEIVE HONOR AND TO RECEIVE POWER AND to receive glory. And if there's anything less than that in our hearts, we need another trip, maybe back to the altar or someplace to get alone with God. And they sung a new song. Thou art worthy to take the book and to open it there and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and and hast and and hast redeemed us back to God. Has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nations. How many nations do we have represented here? I don't know, maybe 30, 40, I don't know. It makes no difference. We are of one citizenship. &gt;&gt; We are citizens of one kingdom. There's only two that you can belong to. There's only two. There's a kingdom of darkness, a kingdom of evil, a kingdom of uncleanness, A KINGDOM OF CONFUSION. I THANK GOD WE'RE NOT PART OF THAT KINGDOM. I THANK GOD HE has called us into his glorious kingdom. AND WHAT A PROMISE. NOT ONLY A PROMISE, NOT A PIE IN THE SKY, A REALITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF THIS ISN'T TRUE, FOLKS, we'll close the doors and all go out and and live life as best we can at this season. But I'm so glad that the Christ of Christmas, the that the world is celebrating, THEY THEY'RE ALL TAKEN UP WITH THEIR commercialization and we don't have to have any part of that. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE NO PART OF THAT. WE'RE SO GLAD THAT he came. Hallelujah. He came with the blood of God from the seed of God to redeem the attributes THAT WAS IN THE FATHER'S MIND. AND AND he says, I HAVE COMPLETED THE WORK that thou gavest me TO DO. I'VE SHED THE BLOOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I'm I have to hold myself back so I don't get into Sunday morning. And they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof." Has he done it? That was him that opened the seals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he had a mouthpiece, an authorative, a an authorized mouthpiece here on earth to speak the things that were that were made open. &gt;&gt; Amen. and hath redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hath made us unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about, the throne, and the beasts, and the elders, and the number 10,000 times, 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice. And I determined as I was reading this, it was impossible for me to whisper it. It's impossible. If I didn't have this microphone, I' i'd bearo before I left here because I determined I'm going to give him glory tonight. I I determined that we all shall give him glory. And though you may have never spoken and never opened your mouth, you'll open your mouth tonight AND JUST SAY, "GLORY TO GOD for what he has done." THAT THE LAMB HAS TAKEN THE BOOK TO CLAIM THE attributes that were in the father's mind. Hallelujah. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE GATHERED WITH HIM AROUND HIS THRONE IN this kingdom that we're now in that kingdom. You're in that kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm authorized TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU ARE. YOU'RE NOT HERE in just Cloverdale Bible way. WE'RE IN A KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A KING. IT HAS REGULATIONS and rules THAT'S FAR SUPERIOR TO any that are here on earth. &gt;&gt; Saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was slain. That was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on earth. Are you a creature on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever. Hallelujah. We say blessing and honor and power hallelujah to our God. There's none like him. And the four beasts, this didn't end. And the four beasts said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the four and 20 elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever. And then in Revelation 7 and 12, saying, "Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Revelation is full of that. Do you know why? It's the last book. &gt;&gt; Because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ. WHO IS HE? HE'S THE SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT CAME FROM THE BOSOM. &gt;&gt; And he's being revealed. &gt;&gt; Oh, people don't know what this message is all about. This message is revealing him. &gt;&gt; How can we help but say something? In Revelation 19, "And after these things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and honor and power unto our Lord our God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Revelation's all about. Revelation isn't some kind of dragged out book and all full of strange mysteries. Whatever it was, we know one thing. And they all in heaven and in the earth cried out, "Glory and honor and power and might and riches." Hallelujah. belongs to our God. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're gathered here. We're gathered here to worship him. We're gathered here not just to think about him. We're gathered here to worship him and to thank him and to give him his due worship. AND HE HAS TOLD US SO MANY THINGS about us. &gt;&gt; Sometime we get, you know, we say, well, you know, we've heard so much of that we're we're almost uh, you know, we got in our psyche that uh, how is it less and lower esteem? We get such low esteem of ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's the devil's world. Right. &gt;&gt; God's world. That's a devil's kingdom. God's kingdom is you're my children. You're my sons. You're my daughters. Do you believe that? I thought of you before this world was. I thought of you before all of this scientific world are even even come about. I thought of you long before all the technical things you have that are so time uh you know time consuming &gt;&gt; and supposed to be saving time. We won't get on of that. &gt;&gt; But I finally found a place and I I was rejoicing today. I just thought that's exactly what the people of God. We need to forget the world and forget all the activity and all the all the busyiness of the world and just take time. Uh there's a song of course uh I know that we sang. I I I'm I'm going to shout. I just feel like shouting. Hallelujah. And I thought of that course today. &gt;&gt; I'm going to shout. &gt;&gt; All of us are going to shout. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, I didn't know I was going to shout." Yeah, you're going to shout. WE'RE GOING TO SHOUT, "GLORY, HALLELUJAH, and honor, and power, and glory belongth to him." &gt;&gt; Does it belong to him? Then we give it to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and and just when he took the book, it wasn't even open yet. When he took the book, THEY WERE JUST OVERCOME. THE ELDERS WERE OVERCOME. The angels were overcome. 420 elders were overcome. Just fell down at his feet. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, they they had some indication of what was in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here's a GROUP OF HERE'S THE attributes that were in the fall. Well, I better just carry on here for a moment. Hallelujah. You know, when you spend some time and you spend uh two three days and you just ponder these things, you just see them and you you you can't help but &gt;&gt; be I won't say overcome, but you are they overcome any other thoughts of the of life. heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah and salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God. In Matthew, Jesus said and he told of the of the swer and the of the swer and the seed and the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom. This kingdom has children. This children this kingdom has subjects but the tears are the children of the wicked one. in Revelation 3 and 21 said to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. Brother Brandham makes a special point of that even also even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne. He says, "Set sit with me in my throne. Not on my throne, in my throne." That's in his domain. And now, as Christ is the ruler, throne, ruler at this time, and this is how how can I overcome the complete domain of God. So will the church be with him and the bride be with him in his throne in his entire domain &gt;&gt; where his domain reaches. A throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as it is bound as its boundaries do. And this is from eternity to eternity. Hello folks that are still in the negative, but you have ears to hear and a mind to understand and a mouth to speak. Glory to God who made this kind of a promise and I just happen to believe it tonight. &gt;&gt; I accept it tonight. &gt;&gt; If I don't accept that, what do we have to accept? &gt;&gt; You want to have to accept the newspaper or the news tonight? I can tell you that the news will be uh same things just different people. Same violence and same disasters just different people. &gt;&gt; Or you can believe this. &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God has come. &gt;&gt; Hello children of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Not children not not of the tears of the wicked one but children of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Christ didn't come to make us church members. Christ didn't come to just give us a a comfortable social activity or social interaction. That's not what he came for. He came TO REDEEM US BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; And angels can't restrain themselves when they see that. When they see the glory OF OF PEOPLE THAT WERE SO LOST AND SO uh uh distant from God, so fallen. I'm going to come into that in just a moment. And we are his kingdom and his domain. This is in the raising of Gyrus's daughter. And we are his kingdom and his domain is from eternity to eternity. Think of that. All powers and every word is given unto into his hand. That's right. How wonderful. Hebrews 10:1 says, "For the law having a shadow of good things to come." Here we are. Thank you. For the law having a shadow. Maybe we could just dim the lights a little wee bit. Not much, but a little bit. Having a shadow of things to come and not the very image of the things. can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the the comers there unto perfect. In the message perfection, uh, brother Brandham refers to Hebrews 11. It's all about, he said, it's all that wonderful shadows of the faith, the heroes of the faith. Hebrews 11th chapter, you know, by faith this happened. By faith, Abel. By faith, Enoch was translated. By faith, Abraham. By faith, Sarah received strength to conceive. And what shall we say more about all these people? And the prophet simply says that in uh in the it's about the wonderful shadows of the faith. Shadows of the faith. The heroes of faith. How by faith they did such and such a thing. and how without us. And how without us they could not be made perfect because they are the shadow of this to come. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? THOSE GREAT HEROES OF FAITH GO HOME AND READ THE 11TH CHAPTER AND SAY THESE MEN OF GOD, THESE WOMEN OF GOD, THESE STALARTS OF FAITH, THESE SEERS OF GOD, THESE PATRIARCHS, THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE, THEY HAVE THEIR TROUBLES AND DIFFICULTIES LIKE WE DO. But they could not be made COMPLETE OR BE MADE PERFECT without us. &gt;&gt; They had to have this final age. Hallelujah. This final AGE WOULD HAVE AN AGE. GOD COULDN'T HOLD ALL THESE THINGS SECRET. SO, HE BURST THE THINGS OPEN. &gt;&gt; He broke the seals and had a and he and he did it at a time that he had had a a messenger on earth that he had spoken to since he was a child that he had come and BEGAN TO DEMONSTRATE THE power of God and that crippled child uh leaping out of his arms and the bones straightening out. Such dramatic things. Oh, we'd like to see those things. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE THOSE miracles don't transform you. They may excite you. They may BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES, BUT THEY DON'T TRANSFORM YOU. This word, if you understand, this word came OUT OF THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER. THE LOGOS WAS SENT TRANSFORM the people. Change them. Change them from the negative to the positive. CHANGE THEM FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT. THEY MUST BE THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. THEY'RE THE CHILDREN OF THE DAY. THEY CAN'T JUST SIT AND BE CHURCH MEMBERS. Change them from BEING JUST CHURCH MEMBERS. CHANGE THEM FROM BEING JUST A SOCIALIZING GROUP OF PEOPLE. CHANGE THEM UNTIL THEY REALIZE I'M A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Shadows of the faith and heroes of faith. How by faith they did such and such a thing and how without us they could not be made perfect because they are of the shadow of this to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These shadows of the faith were the negatives to the positive. Amen. &gt;&gt; The 13th chapter ends up with this towards the end that Jesus Christ is all in all. That he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Showing that it was Christ back there. It was Christ back before the law. It was Christ in the law. It was Christ in the days of grace. It'll be Christ forever. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you see where he's going with that phrase? &gt;&gt; It's eternity. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful picture the Hebrew letter paints for us. Before the world was ever formed, we were placed in Christ or we were placed in the revelation of the son of man. Listen friends, you did not come here by accident. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were born in this season and of God sent his word and called you. You were called for one purpose that you could hear this revelation which of is a revelation of the son of man because this one that came from the bosom of God when he's glorified when he's when he's revealed to the people and WHEN WE SAY OH JESUS MY SAVIOR WE'RE GIVING glory to God who SENT HIM TO BE our redeemer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not to be a name on our lips, &gt;&gt; but to be a reality in our hearts, &gt;&gt; before the world was ever formed, we were placed in Christ or placed in the revelation of the son of man. Brother Brandham said in the unveiling of God, he's the son of man as prophet that he's the son of God because God's a spirit. He's a son of God in the age of the Holy Spirit. The age of the Holy Spirit. And then he becomes the son of David to the Jews. But he said between there between. And that's an important sentence between. In that little sliver of space he becomes a son of man. We're in that sliver. We're just that little sliver of space &gt;&gt; where God says, "All right, the earth has gone through its birth pains [snorts] and science is developing into a very very cultivated and sophisticated and bringing forth a people and Satan's Eden is coming to its height." And in the midst of in the midst of God's Eden, Satan crept in. In the midst of Satan's Eden, God came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to his wisdom. &gt;&gt; He knows how to creep in. He knows how to come in secretly and reveal himself &gt;&gt; when you were in sin. He knew how to come in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know folks, we have to believe in the supernatural because the supernatural is everywhere. God being infinite who cannot lie, cannot speak anything contrary, knows everything, just as perfect at the beginning as he is at the ending and just as perfect at the end as he was at the beginning. Isn't that nice? God is endless like eternity. You can never find a corner of a perfect circle. You could run and run through ages and eternity and there'd never never never be an end to it. And that's the way God is. &gt;&gt; But he loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben says he was alone with his thoughts. Prophet says he was lonesome. And I want you to see something, class, because I just feel like it's that way tonight. Here's here's here's God. And you've got to see him in his greatness and his omnipotence and in his filling all space and time with that attribute and that desire. I want to be expressed. I want to be made known. I want to have sons and daughters. I want to have a family. That's what I want to have. And back in the back part of God's mind, he says, "I I'll I'll Satan, his enemy, came in and the fall happened, and I'll read it for you." And then time had to come into existence because of that. And and and I'll read it also for you. And there came a little he says the circle is eternity but there's a little he said my wife calls it a hickey but it's like a loop comes down and breaks that eternity but he says eternity kept on going and we just fall down into this the fall into this little loop. And then he says when that's over then we just continue on &gt;&gt; with it. [sighs] And when it went went down into that little loop, that's a negative part. &gt;&gt; That's a negative part. We're in a negative part for a short season, a little time. You're in a negative right now. &gt;&gt; And yes, there'll be trials. And yes, there'll be all of these things. And it'll either be by death or by the change. But he calls it the acid of death. In that one one place he calls it the acid of death because it is but he said and I'm so thankful for the way he put it the acid of death but he said all it can do is develop the picture &gt;&gt; of what this God our great father had in his mind what he saw you he saw you the shape how you're made up he saw every part he saw your weakness he saw your strengths he saw he doesn't need a psychologist God is All wise, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel like giving him praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feel like shouting hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But what he wanted to do, he loved fatherhood. In him, he loved fatherhood. He was a father. The prophet said he was a father, but there was no son. So out of his bosom came this little halo light. It was the logos. It was his word. He was going to give some uh uh give some materialization. He wanted to be have he wanted to be somebody that could be touched, that could be felt. &gt;&gt; That could be understood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the king came down to dwell with his subjects to be touched by his subjects to be to have compassion on their need. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father. And the only way I'd like everybody to say the only way &gt;&gt; I want to want you to say it louder. The only way the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man. That's who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; He's the only way. &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he came? I saw some smiling already. He comes AND HE SAYS, "I AM THE WAY." &gt;&gt; He's the only way. &gt;&gt; The only way that the father could be a father. &gt;&gt; That's why he said I mean you'll you'll read the Bible entirely different. That's why he said I DO WHAT THE father shows me. &gt;&gt; I don't do anything till the father shows me. He was so directed, so under the desire and the purpose of the father. And if Jesus was that, how much more we want to be that father, thy will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; And the only way he could express it was to become a son of man. You say, "Well, you read that last week. I'll be reading it probably again. I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto who? Father. &gt;&gt; The father. &gt;&gt; But by me. Why? Because you were in him. That's the only way to come to the father. &gt;&gt; Now this great chain of perfection was broken. I have I have for space to try to get it on a slide. I've taken out some words or a line or two here and there. Uh now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space. Time came because of sin. Let's draw a picture of time. A perfect circle forever forever and then all of all of sin dropped in and put a little drop. Brother Brandham says, "My wife calls it a hickey uh drop in the chain." So, it comes down. Now, eternity continues on, but it's not in its perfect condition. There's a little gap comes down, breaks over this way, goes out this way. God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost. Listen, I just want to drop in here for a moment. Brother Brandham says one place, "And when the trying of the word is over, &gt;&gt; it's not God saying go and grind them out. Go and grind these humans out." It's not that. It's God's word that's being tried. And you are you are declaring I've been birthed by the word of God. My faith is in the promise of God. It is yay and amen to everyone that believeth. And and because of that confession, you become the subject. You become the object of all of the all the darts and all the uh arrows and so on of Satan. &gt;&gt; He's trying you &gt;&gt; whether you're going to doubt it or believe it. I'm not here, friends, to, you know, to get some metal. I'm here to be with you. &gt;&gt; I'm here because I believe this. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking because I believe it. &gt;&gt; And God had to do it because Satan caused it. and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost that God by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle. Then she rolls on just the same. A gap is a chasm. There's a great chasm fixed. time. Now, time is this little loop that loops down. Jesus was from eternity to eternity, but he stepped into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you get that &gt;&gt; in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood. Aren't you glad that there's a streak of blood? &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I just give you very very quickly uh in the back of my own testimony. I won't bother saying where or when, but in my own ministry time, there was a a person that was terribly demonpossessed. And uh and there was some men gathered around to pray for her. She had supernatural strength. Absolutely supernatural strength. Took some great big men, about three or four of them, to hold her. And don't fool around with devil's kingdom. &gt;&gt; His plan for the lost and the unbelieving is not a good one. &gt;&gt; Dark will get more dark. &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; And the way of the transgressor is hard. &gt;&gt; There's no way to make it easy. The way of the transgressor is hard. Can I hear an amen to that? &gt;&gt; You believe that? And this woman, they were holding her down on the platform and she spoke. She spoke several times and I was right there. And she said, "If I come out, I'll just come into you." And uh the one brother said, "But you can't because there's a there's blood between you and I." And she just almost hissing and spitting and said, "Oh, why did you say that? Why did you say that?" Those demons know exactly all about the blood. You want to be thankful for the blood. You want to be thankful for that streak of blood that comes across. You can go to bed tonight and say, "I thank God &gt;&gt; the devil's defeated. &gt;&gt; HE WAS DEFEATED at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And when THAT BLOOD CAME, WHEN THAT BLOOD WAS SHED, it was shed for me." HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S NEVER LOST ITS POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S not merely a song. That's an inspiration. &gt;&gt; The blood of God has never lost its power. We've been redeemed by love divine and by the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the purpose of it come through the streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again. because that's in another form. You were you were an attribute. You were in God's thought. God didn't think just think of people as a big lump of clay or big lump of dirt or an individual as just a lump of clay, but he thought of of who you are and what you would contribute and what you would be in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; What is the what is the bride of JESUS CHRIST CALLED? THE body &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. Do you think for a moment God who s who had the Elohim who had the out of his bosom came the son of man? Do you think for a moment he's going to belittle that? He's it's he he's glorified and worshiped because of that &gt;&gt; because of what Jesus accomplished at Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just have to hold back. So, we're back. We're back with God again for all eternity. You see it? And that's all time is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. You can turn the lights back on if you don't mind. [clears throat] Satan took Jesus up. And this is the testimony of raising a dead boy. And incidentally, I don't know if I would have the opportunity, but I'm working towards having the young men over to the home. We're working on that. We've been and uh for example, you know, brother Brennan told me in detail of the boy being raised from the dead in Finland. And you may or may not know there was two boys and one was terribly injured and one was killed. And the injured boy, his mother was at the bottom of the stairs when he would come out off the platform and she just like would grab a hold of him. Please, please, you raised the other boy. He said, "No, I did not raise that boy. God raised the boy. No, please, please, you you raised him." and and for my son for my son have a vision for my son and he tried to explain to her that he just couldn't have it. It would have to be God. But he told me that he was in the in his hotel. He was standing at the window looking out the window and he saw a vase with two liies and one was standing up perfect and correct and the other one was bent right over and sagging down like that. He says, "And while he looked, the one that was hanging down came right up and stood with this one and he said, "Call the woman." Hallelujah. That's the kind of confidence. That's the kind of God we serve. And we say, "Honor and power. Hallelujah. And glory and wisdom and all riches belong to him." Oh, how rich is our God. How powerful is our God. And the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not just here to inspire you. You inspire me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You shout it out. That'll be fine with me. I just hear I just here want to hear someone say, "Glory, &gt;&gt; glory." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We honor and we worship him. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO EXCITE ME. THAT DOESN'T EXCITE ME, BUT THAT I just want to join with you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't do enough of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You won't scare me. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Call the woman." And that other boy was [snorts] I don't know just exactly what happened. I don't know what his injuries were, but [clears throat] I will tell you this also. You ready? &gt;&gt; Okay. [clears throat] We we we were just having meetings in Helsinki. It was just a very very you know small group of people maybe 60 70 80 people and they were the they were the believers in Helsinki Finland and brother Matty Honen he's a voice of God rep at least he was but he wasn't at that time and he always would go uh come down about 200 kilometers and arrange the meetings for us. Sometimes brother Lonnie Jenkins was there and other times just my wife and I were there and it's not easy. You know, it isn't easy. Uh we arrived and we were there and we had all a jet lag and everything else and we got to go to a meeting and I was did you go down the street or did somebody else go down? I think my wife went down to a restaurant and got some real strong coffee. And when you go to Europe, it's strong to begin with, &gt;&gt; isn't it, Brother Hugh? But she said she wanted strong coffee and it was kind of lukewarm and you know uh coffee you could you could feel it and she thought well I need to I need to be awake for this meeting. So she drank the whole thing down. It wasn't very good. But we're in that meeting and do you know who's in that meeting? An elderly lady who who who knows about her? Not very many. Nobody knows about her. But she goes visiting and she goes to a senior citizen's home to visit another lady. And another woman who was also visiting came over and and said to this lady said, "Uh, excuse me. It seems that I know you." And this sister said, "I I don't I don't know you. I don't recognize you." No, she said, "It seems that." And this so they begin to ask questions about you know where are you from or and and so one was in Helsinki and I don't know where the other one was from exactly but she as they spoke together then as they spoke together they realized that they did had known each other years ago and a woman and then they then the conversation turned spiritual and [clears throat] uh so uh she said well where do you where do you fellowship ship. Well, I fellowship at a with a Pentecostal group and so on. Where do you fellowship? Said, "Well, I fellowship with a small group of people that fellowship around the message that Brother Brandham that God gave through brother Brandham." And this lady said, "Oh, Brother Brham." She said, "Do you remember when he was here?" "Oh, yes." Said, "I do." "Do you remember the boy that was raised from the dead?" Oh, yes. Yes. She said it was my husband that drove the car that killed the boy. How do you like that? You talk about a network, friends. And if you ever relate that, you can say I can I heard the man tell the account with my own I I He wasn't an eyewitness to the accident, but he was an eyewitness to the woman whose husband drove the car. So there you have it. &gt;&gt; You talk about true, you talk about infallible. I tell you what, friends, this ministry was the ministry of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of man. &gt;&gt; This ministry was one that God looked upon and loved because he saw he saw out of this ministry, not not the multitudes, but perhaps out of the multitudes will come a group of people. They will hear what my thoughts were and they will love my thoughts. &gt;&gt; They will love it because they are my thoughts. They and they will learn they are THE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT I FELT. MY THE ATTRIBUTE isn't just some word. The attribute just isn't a person. The attribute isn't just your visage. The attribute is who you are &gt;&gt; as a son or daughter of God. and not only who you are, BUT WHO YOU CAN BE AND WHO YOU SHALL be because he's not done working on us. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. HE HE'S GOING TO COMPLETE IT, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; YES, he is. HE'S GOING TO COMPLETE IT. YOU LEAVE IT IN HIS HANDS. YOU LEAVE YOURSELF IN HIS HANDS, and he'll do the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said, "I do that which pleases the father." And that's what the father had in his mind. Hallelujah. He's not going to have a whole bunch of pieces and say, "Well, you know, these are just pieces of my attributes. You're quiet. &gt;&gt; He's not going to be there with pieces of his attributes. You're going to You are his finished work." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that sounds too wonderful." It's not too wonderful. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And this is actually this whole this whole paragraph and then I'm going to be closing. It's 10 after 9. But he says in the testimony of raising the dead boy said Satan took Jesus up showed him every kingdom of the world and he said all these are mine. Satan did said, "I'll do with them what I'll do." He said, "What I want to." And said, "I'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship me." Jesus knew that he was going to fall heir to them anyhow. &gt;&gt; And he said, "In my if my kingdom were of this world, I'd call my subjects and they'd fight. But my kingdom is is of above." See, but blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. And then this is the line I have highlighted. Someday Jesus will come to the earth. And the dead that's dead in him shall rise and come forth with him, and he is the king. We're now candidates and his subjects in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; We're now candidates. You know, friends, the prophet of God said it because he had to say it. He had to say things that were almost unbelievable for us humans. And this depends what side of the what side of the road you're trying to understand it. &gt;&gt; If if you simply say he came, this messenger came so that I could believe. This messenger came so he could speak things that were beyond my understanding. This messenger came to speak things that are so glorious, it's just beyond my grasp. BUT HE SAYS IT AND I'M GOING TO believe it. &gt;&gt; And if HE SAYS WE'RE NOW CANDIDATES and his subjects in his kingdom and we shall return to the earth someday to be immortal beings. And if he said that we have eternal life now and we're going then then I think it's a big mistake if we don't confess it. &gt;&gt; And the more you confess it, &gt;&gt; the more you'll see it taking place, &gt;&gt; you'll take a grip in your life and you'll see that you you begin to look at things differently. &gt;&gt; Hello. You begin to see things differently. You look at things differently and THE IMPOSSIBLE BECOME POSSIBLE. the things that you questioned become believable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then I want to end here because I want to say that Jesus went through the process and the acid of death for us. showing himself alive again. And I will give you just a clue where I want to go on the Lord's day a Sunday morning. And the scripture says, "To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God." I don't think there was perhaps no one here was in the meetings. Was anyone here in Brother Benham's meetings? I was in about 30 of the meetings. My wife was in some of the meetings. None of that contributed to why I'm here. What I'm really saying is that you didn't need to be in those great meetings. &gt;&gt; It was not those miracles that caught you. &gt;&gt; It was this word of quad that caught you. &gt;&gt; God was not thrilled that multitudes came to Jesus and left him. &gt;&gt; That didn't thrill him. He was not thrilled that hundreds of thousands came to hear William Brham and where are they today? Most all of them gone. But what he's thrilled at, here's a group of people. Hear my word. Hear this logos. This that came out of my bosom. Hallelujah. And they believe on him. They believe on his sacrifice. And because they've believed, I have I I I have called them my sons, my children, my daughters, my family. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And Jesus went through the process of death showing himself alive again. And so here will be the clue for you. He came and lived in the negative form. Brother Random said he was tempted. The scripture says he was tempted in all points like we are. Tempted in all points. I may not understand that's what he says. He was tempted in all points like we are. When he was thirsty, he needed water. When he was hungry, he needed food. He was in a when they stuck him with a spear, he bled. They put a crown of thorns. They pulled his beard out, spat in his face, did did all those things. They said, the Bible says that he his visage was marred more than that of any man. And they've had they've, you know, Hollywood has tried to produce it and so on and make millions perhaps on it. I don't know. And I don't care what they do. and call it the passion. Whatever more that passion was for us. &gt;&gt; That whole scene was for us. &gt;&gt; It was your savior. It was this invisible God created that seed and had a little girl Mary believe him &gt;&gt; and she gave birth to a son and he became the son of God &gt;&gt; and we were in him &gt;&gt; and through him I'll bring many sons to redemption. I'll bring a family. I'll gather them. And that's why it caught you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus now I'm going to go to Luke 24 once again. He's out and he's walking with &gt;&gt; two on the way to Emmas [snorts] and they're still in the negative and he's in the positive. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And so the positive you talk about how close can he come, how close can he get to you. You can actually hear from the positive side. &gt;&gt; And that's why a prophet comes and says, "You're hearing from your &gt;&gt; theophony." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where's your theophony? &gt;&gt; It's somewhere where you you can't feel it just now, but you're hearing from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God, your father, says they need to hear a certain thing. So, he sends a certain inspiration. He'll have a man wrestling it out before God and come behind the pullpit and be all nervous and brother Brandham just telling his life story. That's what I started with. And just the thoughts he said he just troubled and trembling. He has it has to go back over all this tear stained, blood stained, all of this life that was so filled with trouble and agony and sorrow. He has to remember it all again so that the people can have something to hear and be blessed by it. I heard him tell it and he wept so hard. He was actually actually he was at was at a breakfast and he was speaking on uh the unwanted Christ and how the woman saw him. It's not right that he's sitting there and his feet are dirty and he hasn't been welcomed into this house and here he is in this Simon's house and she comes and she loses herself and forgets everything and comes bursting into that feast of dignitaries and falls down before him begins to weep and wash his feet with her tears and wipe them with the hairs of her head and kiss his feet. And brother Brandham's going right there and he's weeping so hard. And a man who was related to me sitting right beside me and his face is just bursting red with with weeping and tears also. But he didn't see who he was. He didn't see who that was. Didn't see who the messenger was. And that's just when I was coming in. I was thinking, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; what grace is this? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So someday if you hear someone on the other side singing Amazing Grace, Brother Brown says it'll be him. I'll be singing a duet with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me? &gt;&gt; I'm standing. So we'll all stand. I'd like to have the musicians come, please. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, how wonderful in the stillness and quietness of this moment that each one of us can experience our hearts filled with a thanksgiving. One is giving you thanksgiving for one thing and someone else for something else. But we are the body &gt;&gt; and we are members in particular. And you have said even to the children of Israel, you'll be a peculiar people. You'll be a holy nation. And oh God, we count ourselves by your grace and by your promise in that number. &gt;&gt; We are here, Lord. We're not part of the nations of the world. Not part of the United Nations, but we're part of the heavenly kingdom. We are subjects of your kingdom. You said we are now subjects of your kingdom and we will we will take on our immortal mantle after this mortal after this little gap has been filled in this space of time when you will deal with sin. Help us oh God to deal with it as you would deal with it. Help us to be unbending, uncompromising. Oh God, let our lives ring with the glories of God and THE THANKSGIVING OF GOD. We thank you, Father, for having taken the book. We thank you for letting us know our names were there. Help. Thank you for letting us know that you were not ashamed of us, but you have embraced us in all of our weakness and all of our frailties. You have embraced us. And I pray, oh God, you'll give us hearts filled with thanksgiving. I pray in the name of Jesus that the hearts of the people, Lord, will be filled to bursting, oh God, where they cannot hold it. They'll be in their cars. They'll be in their rooms. THEY'LL BE ON THEIR BEDSIDE or wherever, Lord, and they'll have to open their mouth AND SAY, "OH GOD, YOU GIVE ME THIS BREATH. You've given me this strength. I JUST WANT TO SAY GLORY, HALLELUJAH, to your name." All hail the name of Jesus. All hail the power of God. LET ANGELS PROSTRATE FALL. OH, BRING FORTH A ROYAL diadem and crown him Lord of all. We thank you, Father. Thank you for this Wednesday evening and every brother and sister that is here. We thank you for the redeemed of the Lord that can say so. Oh God, we're we're here to give you praise and thanksgiving.
