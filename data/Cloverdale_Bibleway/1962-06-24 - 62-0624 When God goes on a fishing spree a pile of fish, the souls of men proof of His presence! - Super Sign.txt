straighten out right CU it was all wrong in my Doctrine brother wood said that's just taking fishing I said all right so we started to go down in Kentucky fishing I just go let him do the talking that's the best way you know let them name the the thing so that morning it rained all night the next morning when we cross Ohio River I said well now all the streams of vision came I said all the streams are going to be muddy we will not be able the fish until we get to this place where we're going about 100 miles and then it's going to be real pretty and clear and we're going to fish the rain just bypassed it so we can fish and then we're going today not going to catch anything and tonight long towards dark Mr bankswood here is going to catch a small fish catfish and I'm going to catch a whole string of them you're going to use the same bait right by the side of it and I'm going to have a whole string and then we're going in about 11:00 the next morning we're coming out I'm going to catch a large fish with scales on it I can't see just what kind it is but it's going to be a large fish there won't be no more C for the rest of the day I seen Mr wood Grandpa wood look around like say oh yes we see how that comes out so on the road down we told and Banks had told him about how the visions and being out brother Banks and I live together sleep together we just brothers and how that he had seen up on the river and L was with him how catching a fish one after I said something's fixing to happen there's going to be a resurrection of life and the next morning we were catching Blu gills to put on fish and lines and Mr L Banks his brother caught one swallow the hook way down he didn't flip it fast enough and jerk it out of the water and this pull inals and gills out of its throat throw down on the water said little fell you shot your last one and it wiggled a little bit laid there and stiffing out little uh small fish what you call here a brim I guess and it Flo around the water for about a half hour and floated back into the the the pond lies and things and I was standing there fishing over side of the boat like that all once something come down through those trees roaring around they heard it but they didn't see it was that light circling around over there said stand up speak to that little fish and he shall have his life back I called attention to the brother I said little fishy in the name of Jesus Christ I give you your life that little fish turned over swam out through the river as hard as he can go like that that seems mythical but here's God's word and God's my judg amen and um and so brother L just fell off over in a vot he said that meant for me brother Brandon he just been saved and filled with the Holy Ghost just a little while he said that meant me said that's all there is to it said because I said to that little fish you shot your last what I said no it just his presence brother Banks back there raised up said it's good to be here let us build three Tabernacles all in that day after just exactly what was told Grandpa Woods it happened just exactly the same way same fish just exactly the same number the next day when we left I said what do you think Mr Woods he said well it's pretty good when a man can see Fish before he catches them so and I said what about it now I led him to Christ bapti bz him and his wife his whole family now it's baptized into the Lord and filled with the Holy Ghost and living a Victorious Life Hallelujah that is amazing grace brother Woods are you here where are you at brother Woods sister Woods are
