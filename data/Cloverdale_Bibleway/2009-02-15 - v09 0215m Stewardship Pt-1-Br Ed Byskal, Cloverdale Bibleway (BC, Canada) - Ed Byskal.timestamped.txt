[9:32] you've got a need this morning, you just
[9:34] lift it before the Lord as we go to
[9:36] prayer. And I know there's many needs. I
[9:38] know there's people listening on the
[9:39] internet who have needs. Just lift it
[9:42] before the Lord at this time as we go
[9:43] before him. Brother Larry, if you'd

[9:47] [Music]
[9:52] let's be our hearts. Father, we thank
[9:53] you this morning,
[9:56] Lord. We're so thankful that we're able
[9:59] to stand here this morning and praise
[10:01] you and honor you this morning, Lord.
[10:04] with the fruit of our lips, Lord. We
[10:06] give you thanks today, Lord.
[10:09] And Lord, we ask this morning, Lord,
[10:11] that your fresh anointing would fall
[10:13] upon each of us, Lord.
[10:16] That we would sense your presence in a
[10:18] mighty way this morning, Lord Jesus.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; That our hearts would be open and
[10:24] sensitive to the needs of the body of
[10:27] believers that are gathered here this
[10:28] morning and out on the internet this
[10:30] morning.
[10:32] We again lift up brother Edmund to you
[10:34] this morning Lord and ask for a
[10:38] complete resurrection of life in this
[10:41] brother Lord. We ask that you would
[10:42] touch him in a fresh way to today Lord
[10:46] Jesus that you would raise him up and
[10:49] that we would truly see him come through
[10:51] the back door into this building Lord
[10:54] Jesus. We thank you for that in advance,
[10:57] Lord Jesus, and lift up Sister Ruth to
[10:59] you this morning, Lord, and ask for
[11:01] strength in her hip, Lord. That you
[11:04] would touch her life, complete
[11:06] restoration for her body, Lord Jesus.
[11:09] This request this morning, Father. We
[11:11] ask Lord that you would meet every need,
[11:14] Father, in divine presence this morning
[11:17] and out over the airwaves, Father, and
[11:19] those that it would even archive this
[11:22] later on, Lord Jesus, that you would
[11:24] touch them for that anointing would glow
[11:26] forth and minister, Lord Jesus, to every
[11:29] heart, every need, whether it be
[11:32] financial, physical, emotional. Lord
[11:35] Jesus, save every lost loved one this
[11:38] morning. Lord, give us a burden this
[11:40] morning to call on your name, Lord
[11:43] Jesus.
[11:44] And Father, we thank you today, Lord,
[11:47] that we've gathered this morning hungry
[11:50] and thirsty to hear your word, Lord. And
[11:52] we ask now a fresh anointing upon the
[11:55] man of God that would come this morning
[11:57] and stand behind this sacred desk, Lord.
[12:00] that the human element would get out of
[12:03] the way this morning and that the spirit
[12:05] of the living God would speak through
[12:07] this vessel, this yielded vessel that
[12:10] has prepared their life this morning to
[12:13] share that which you have for your body
[12:15] this morning for the bride of Christ.
[12:18] And Lord, we ask that you would continue
[12:20] to strengthen each one. Father, we plead
[12:23] the blood of Jesus upon those this
[12:26] morning that are here
[12:29] that need to know you, Lord, that need
[12:32] to draw nearer to you, Lord. We ask that
[12:35] you would draw them by your spirit,
[12:37] Lord, to that intimacy with you this
[12:40] morning, Lord. And Father, we thank you
[12:42] again for the opportunity to gather in
[12:45] that name that is above every name, the
[12:47] Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

[34:13] Uh just before we turn to the word, I'm
[34:15] going to have a word of prayer and we're
[34:19] happy for everyone that is here.
[34:22] Uh
[34:24] we're thankful for all that are also
[34:27] streaming
[34:29] part of the
[34:31] uh internet family or congregation.
[34:35] And uh we're just happy for that. We
[34:39] there are people that are joining in. I
[34:41] hear from them almost every week from
[34:45] different ones, different places,
[34:46] different countries. And uh we're just
[34:52] privileged to be able to be a part of
[34:55] their lives, to be a part of your life.
[34:58] And whether you're here visiting or
[35:00] whether you're a stranger
[35:02] or whether you've been here for many
[35:05] many years, we're we're here to be part
[35:08] of part of your spiritual life. And we
[35:11] want things to be said.
[35:14] We want an atmosphere.
[35:16] And we don't want just some theology.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; We don't want just message theology. We
[35:23] want the God of Elijah,
[35:25] &gt;&gt; the God of William Brham, the God of
[35:27] Moses,
[35:29] &gt;&gt; to be here
[35:30] &gt;&gt; and to do things.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can speak about it, but we want
[35:35] him to do things.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; And I was very, very moved listening to
[35:39] a message this morning just before
[35:41] coming to service, getting ready.
[35:45] And I tell you what, prophet was
[35:48] preaching. We would see Jesus and we
[35:51] still want to see that same one. And he
[35:54] laid it right down the line. We as
[35:56] believers have every right to see him.
[35:58] And he asked the question, would you
[36:00] like to see him?
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I don't want to just hear
[36:04] something. I want to see him.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:09] Amen.
[36:11] Uh, brother Tony and Sister Rebecca are
[36:13] leaving out tonight
[36:15] and uh, we don't know how long they'll
[36:17] be gone this time, but they'll be making
[36:22] their uh, temporary residence at least
[36:25] in in Beirut.
[36:27] And uh, we want to be remembering them
[36:29] in our prayers
[36:32] and praying especially that God will
[36:34] open some doors
[36:36] because it takes God to open the door.
[36:40] And when he does open the door, there's
[36:42] no mistake
[36:44] that he's doing it. And that's what we
[36:47] just really desperately want to see
[36:50] happen. And we're doing everything that
[36:53] we can
[36:55] uh towards that end. But it's a
[36:57] difficult place,
[37:00] difficult, entrenched in religions, but
[37:03] God has worked in difficult places
[37:05] before.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[37:09] We're going to have communion service on
[37:11] March the 1st. So we're announcing it
[37:13] well ahead. And so brother Dia, you can
[37:16] arrange please if you would for that
[37:18] Sunday to be free. I believe that's a
[37:21] Sunday that would be having normally a
[37:23] service in Seattle, but it' be nice if
[37:25] the Seattle people can be here as well.
[37:28] So they could just arrange to have their
[37:30] uh service, Sunday service, maybe have
[37:33] two back back to back so we can be free
[37:36] March the 1st. It's long overdue and
[37:39] there's just been so many other things
[37:40] taking place that it's been hard to set
[37:44] a date. I was going to have it next
[37:46] Sunday, but next Sunday evening,
[37:48] uh, February 22nd
[37:52] is the Sunday evening when the senior
[37:54] camp is concluding. Brother Danny
[37:57] Stevens is going to be
[38:00] uh speaking the camp for the senior
[38:03] young people and we're going to have him
[38:05] here for Sunday night. So it'll be real
[38:07] tight. He'll be speaking at the camp
[38:08] Sunday morning and we wish to have him
[38:10] here Sunday night.
[38:13] So uh we we we know that you senior
[38:16] young people are going to have a
[38:18] glorious time and we believe in his
[38:20] presence. That's what we want to do.
[38:23] Want to be
[38:25] brother Danny Stemon's father. You know
[38:28] just to let you know
[38:30] I was I was actually speaking in brother
[38:33] Tom Brown's house.
[38:35] Sister Tammy Laroo's dad's place. Sister
[38:38] Tammy was in the meeting. And Danny
[38:41] Stemon's dad was not converted yet. He's
[38:44] been pastoring a long time down Florida,
[38:46] but he wasn't saved yet, but his wife
[38:50] was. So, she was in the meeting and he
[38:53] was driving outside shaking his fist. He
[38:55] was he was so upset that she was a
[38:58] believer. So, I said, "God can do hard.
[39:01] He can crack hard nuts."
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Brother John Stemann became a wonderful
[39:06] pastor.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Been a very dear friend all these years.
[39:10] So you can shake your fist all you want,
[39:12] but if God's got a hold of you, you're
[39:13] going to come.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the kind of God we
[39:21] serve.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; You can turn to Matthew if you would
[39:25] please, the 25th chapter. I have three
[39:29] places to read just short scriptures and
[39:33] then keep your Bible if you would to be
[39:35] ready.
[39:37] Nice to see our brother and sister uh
[39:40] sister Clar Brother Clara from Edmonton.
[39:42] God bless you. I always nice to not only
[39:46] nice to have you. Thank you for your
[39:48] daughter.
[39:51] She's been a wonderful asset here to
[39:54] this school.
[39:56] Here's Matthew. I wonder why he's here.
[40:00] Matthew Wilson. My goodness, it's going
[40:02] to be a busy year.
[40:06] Just before we read, let us pray.
[40:11] Our dear father, we are so indebted to
[40:14] you. We're so humbled in your presence,
[40:18] realizing that man, we can do nothing.
[40:23] We can only submit ourselves. We can
[40:25] only yield ourselves. And so we're here
[40:27] today, Lord, to yield and give ourselves
[40:30] to you. We're praying, Father, in the
[40:33] name of Jesus Christ that you will take
[40:36] charge of every person. Lord, as your
[40:40] prophet with his authority, took control
[40:44] and brought every spirit, human spirit
[40:47] in subjection to the will of God. I pray
[40:50] that you will honor the prayers. I ask
[40:52] that you will bring every human spirit
[40:55] and mind and thought into captivity to
[40:58] the will and mind of God. And Father,
[41:01] you'll take control of each one, the
[41:04] hearer and the speaker. In Jesus
[41:06] Christ's name, we ask it. Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh reading Matthew 25
[41:14] and verse 14.
[41:16] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[41:20] traveling into a far country who called
[41:23] his own servants and delivered unto them
[41:28] his goods.
[41:31] Now you can keep your finger in that
[41:34] part of the Bible because I'm going to
[41:35] be going back there after a bit. I wish
[41:38] a second reading in first Peter the 4th
[41:42] chapter verses 10 and 11.
[41:45] [Music]
[41:52] 1 Peter 4:10 and 11.
[41:55] As every man hath received the gift,
[41:59] even so minister the same one to
[42:01] another, as good stewards of the
[42:05] manifold grace of God. If any man speak,
[42:09] let him speak as the oracles of God. If
[42:12] any man minister, let him do so do it as
[42:15] of the ability which God giveth, that
[42:18] God in all things may be glorified
[42:21] through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise
[42:24] and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And in 1 Corinthians uh the 4th chapter,
[42:33] I wish to read verses 1 and two. 1
[42:36] Corinthians
[42:38] 4 1 and two.
[42:42] Let a man so account of us as of the
[42:46] ministers of Christ and stewards of the
[42:49] mysteries of God.
[42:52] Moreover, it is required in stewards
[42:55] that a man be found faithful.
[42:59] And I have been so impressed with the
[43:01] scripture that the apostle Paul is
[43:05] speaking to the Corinthians and writing
[43:07] to them about. Let a man so account of
[43:10] us as of the ministers of Christ and
[43:14] stewards of the mysteries of God.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; What a stewardship.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And moreover, it is required in stewards
[43:23] that a man be found faithful.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. as you have your
[43:28] seats.
[43:30] I would like
[43:33] you to be as uh just uh that God would
[43:36] give you
[43:38] real attentive spirits and and uh just
[43:42] as little movement as possible, please.
[43:47] Sometimes when we approach a a subject
[43:52] uh we feel a wee bit uh apprehensive
[43:56] perhaps because not of the subject but
[43:59] because we just don't know exactly how
[44:02] we should perhaps be approaching it and
[44:05] to take a subject that can be so large
[44:10] and so enormous so massive you don't
[44:12] know how to uh distill it down so it can
[44:17] be concise and precise thoughts in in
[44:20] the time that we have but I want to
[44:22] speak on stewardship
[44:26] and that I probably won't get done it
[44:29] done the subject just now
[44:31] but I wish to take it perhaps in a
[44:33] different direction than the title might
[44:36] in uh indicate
[44:39] uh a steward first we want to establish
[44:41] what a steward is as far as the
[44:43] scripture is as how the scripture uses
[44:46] that
[44:48] uh a steward is uh
[44:51] the manager of household
[44:54] affairs.
[44:56] Especially a steward is as a manager or
[45:01] one to whom the head of a house has
[45:04] entrusted the management of his affairs
[45:07] as Abraham had Eleazar
[45:10] as his steward.
[45:13] and uh and he sent him to get Isaac's
[45:16] wife to get Rebecca, but he entrusted
[45:20] everything to him. A steward has the
[45:22] duty of dealing out the proper uh
[45:26] portion to every servant and even to the
[45:30] children not yet of age. So there may be
[45:33] children that are immature
[45:35] as there is in the household of God, in
[45:38] the household of faith, as there is in
[45:39] the church. There's those that perhaps
[45:42] have not matured spiritually, but we
[45:45] have duty, not just myself. We all have
[45:48] a duty uh over certain things that God
[45:52] has entrusted to us that it is managed
[45:55] in such a way so that the purpose and
[45:59] the result that God desires from that
[46:04] investment will be forthcoming.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; He's interested in increase.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; A steward is also come from it's from a
[46:15] a second word compound word which is
[46:17] simply house. This is God's house. I was
[46:20] going to have brother Rod say that. This
[46:22] is God's house.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; This is his household.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; And uh and any dwelling place, the house
[46:29] of God or the tabernacle or of the human
[46:32] body. And I'm going to be speaking some
[46:35] about that. this human body, we have a
[46:38] stewardship about that because it's the
[46:41] abode of the Holy Spirit and we have a
[46:44] responsibility to that.
[46:47] There was a quote out of this message
[46:50] that we would see Jesus and that's why I
[46:52] heard the I wanted to hear the entire
[46:55] service last night and this morning
[46:58] which I did and I was really struck by
[47:01] this uh phrase. Now, I'm going to just
[47:04] go slowly and take my time if you don't
[47:05] mind.
[47:07] This was in Tiffan, Georgia in 1960.
[47:10] And brother Brandham said, "It's a
[47:12] privilege to be here in Tiffan."
[47:16] He said, "Little did I ever know that I
[47:19] would be taking the judge's place."
[47:23] He just opening the He just opening the
[47:25] service.
[47:27] Little did I ever know that I would be
[47:29] taking the judge's place.
[47:32] I'm coming to represent the judge
[47:34] tonight.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; The judge of heaven.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And when I read those words, I can tell
[47:40] you that I I I just almost trembled
[47:43] inwardly
[47:45] as to what would the rest of the service
[47:48] yield? What was the what was the rest of
[47:50] the service? I've come to take the
[47:53] judge's place tonight. The judge of
[47:57] heaven.
[47:59] I can tell you one thing. He made the
[48:01] people of Tiffan, Georgia
[48:04] responsible
[48:06] &gt;&gt; with the rest of this service.
[48:09] We would see Jesus tonight. He talked
[48:11] about the Jew, the Greeks had wanted to
[48:13] see Jesus.
[48:16] And then then he spent most the service
[48:19] on
[48:21] telling Peter his name.
[48:25] You're Peter.
[48:27] you're the son of
[48:30] uh
[48:32] Cphus, you're the son of Jonah.
[48:35] And then he went on about Nathaniel.
[48:39] And then he spent time about
[48:43] Abraham,
[48:45] Sodom, the servant, how it was Elohim,
[48:50] God represented in a body, in a flesh.
[48:56] Then and then finally
[48:58] called the people up. Called maybe 20 or
[49:02] 25 people up. And the tape doesn't go
[49:05] through all of the uh prayer line. I
[49:09] think there was about six people and I
[49:11] believe five of them. He just told them
[49:13] their name because he just said how
[49:16] Nathaniel and then the woman at the well
[49:19] and he laid it on sir we would see Jesus
[49:23] said don't look at my flesh
[49:25] said but this is him
[49:28] &gt;&gt; and I tell you what friends
[49:31] this is the message that has given us
[49:34] birth
[49:36] &gt;&gt; this is the word that has given us and
[49:37] that Jesus he just said he and he he
[49:40] laid it out that every believer
[49:42] You have a right to claim and to say
[49:48] this Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[49:50] today, and forever.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And if we really believe what he did
[49:54] yesterday,
[49:55] &gt;&gt; he's he's not only able, I I don't want
[49:57] to go by that. He will do the same today
[50:01] &gt;&gt; because he can't change.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He can't change in his nature.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And he said if you discover what he was,
[50:08] that's what he is.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; If we can just come into that
[50:13] atmosphere, I just prayed God help us
[50:16] &gt;&gt; just to come into that very atmosphere,
[50:19] &gt;&gt; a believing atmosphere, not a reasoning
[50:22] atmosphere, not a doubting atmosphere,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; but just we can say I believe that
[50:27] &gt;&gt; that God came on the scene.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was God that came on the
[50:33] scene in this generation.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he went on to say,
[50:40] he said, uh, and I'm thinking as I
[50:43] walked in the door and looked at this
[50:44] people and the way they were situated to
[50:48] know this, that one day there will come
[50:50] a time where we will all meet again, if
[50:54] we never meet anymore until then, and
[50:57] we'll be at another judgment seat.
[51:00] And there we will give an account of
[51:02] what we have done and what we do
[51:05] tonight, what we say and our actions and
[51:10] whether we are able to accept what we
[51:12] hear and to believe on the works of the
[51:15] Holy Spirit. That was his opening
[51:17] comment
[51:19] and that group of people can't be any
[51:21] different than this group of people
[51:24] or myself. I feel that we are I want to
[51:28] emphasize our responsibility to the
[51:31] message that God has sent us
[51:35] &gt;&gt; and it's a solemn responsibility. It
[51:37] would probably be a solemn service but I
[51:38] want you to hear what's on my heart. He
[51:42] says and that being the case it makes us
[51:44] rather tremble to think that what will
[51:48] take place at that day if our sins are
[51:51] not under the blood. So now there's two
[51:54] things and my wife and I are just
[51:55] speaking because she said I think a lot
[51:57] of people have questions about do we
[51:58] come to the judgment don't we're not
[52:00] talking about the white throne judgment
[52:02] when we're born and birthed into the
[52:04] kingdom of God. I said I cannot become
[52:07] an a non-biscal
[52:11] &gt;&gt; I cannot become a non son or daughter of
[52:13] God.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; We can't do anything that's finished.
[52:17] We're born of the born of the word, the
[52:20] incorruptible seed of God that will
[52:22] never be taken and sin that's under the
[52:25] blood can never be called can never be
[52:28] called to account for
[52:30] &gt;&gt; never.
[52:31] But on the other hand, then God entrusts
[52:34] us
[52:35] &gt;&gt; with certain things and talents and
[52:38] whatever more which I want to go more
[52:40] into now this morning. And that we are
[52:42] accountable for
[52:45] whether we've been a good steward or we
[52:47] have not been a good steward. whether we
[52:49] have conducted the affairs of our father
[52:52] uh with integrity or or if we've been
[52:56] slipshot about the whole thing and just
[52:58] sliding along. We will be accountable.
[53:01] We are accountable for that and
[53:02] especially accountable for what we have
[53:05] done and how we have uh handled and
[53:09] received what God has sent.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] We are merely stewards or custodians
[53:18] of all that we are and possess.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; We are merely
[53:26] custodians.
[53:27] We're merely stewards of it.
[53:31] Now everything that we are and or can be
[53:35] has been entrusted to us. Now you'll
[53:38] have to get this first part of the
[53:39] service very very clearly and get it
[53:41] established. I don't want you to be
[53:42] confused at all in your mind.
[53:46] On one hand, in one sense,
[53:49] uh God has given us
[53:52] uh entrusted to us things and through
[53:55] the scriptures and in our own language,
[53:59] we we say it's ours.
[54:02] It's mine. And in one sense, it is. It's
[54:06] yours to have. It's yours. says my
[54:08] children, you know, my family, my job,
[54:12] my home, my life, my health, all of
[54:15] that. It's fine. You can say that and in
[54:18] one sense that is true. In another
[54:20] sense, it's not true because it can slip
[54:23] away in a moment.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; It can just be gone in an instant. And
[54:27] so, it is something that has been
[54:28] entrusted to you. David said in the
[54:31] Psalms,
[54:33] "The earth is the Lord's and the
[54:35] fullness thereof,
[54:38] uh, the world and and they that dwell
[54:42] therein." It's all God's.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says also in Job, and I'm
[54:49] going to be using a lot of scriptures,
[54:51] says in Job, "The spirit of God hath
[54:53] made me, and the breath of the Almighty
[54:56] hath given me life."
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. that's his breath has given me
[55:00] life. And so there's many references and
[55:03] I've looked at the references. We won't
[55:04] have time to go into them, but we we can
[55:07] say as I said a moment ago, my life, my
[55:10] home, my wife, my children, my job, my
[55:16] time,
[55:19] my life, my health, all of these things,
[55:23] my money, my rights, all of those
[55:26] things. And that's fine. That's
[55:28] perfectly fine. We use that phrase. The
[55:30] Bible uses that phrase uses it and and
[55:33] God acknowledges that you are to
[55:36] exercise ownership in a sense. But I
[55:40] prefer to call this ownership
[55:43] a responsibility of stewardship
[55:47] rather than ownership. We don't actually
[55:51] own it.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; It all has been entrusted to us. Your
[55:55] health could be gone before you leave
[55:57] this building.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Your life could be gone before you leave
[56:02] this building.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; We don't have any guarantee whether
[56:06] we're young, whether we're old, or what
[56:08] whether we appear to be the the most uh
[56:10] physically fit in the whole
[56:12] congregation. It could be gone in just a
[56:15] moment. And we all we all recognize
[56:18] that.
[56:20] In the scripture, it says in Luke's
[56:21] gospel, "And he said unto his
[56:24] disciples,"
[56:26] therefore I say unto you, take no
[56:29] thought for your life. Jesus is saying,
[56:32] it's your life.
[56:34] What you shall eat, or neither for the
[56:37] body, what you shall put on. So the the
[56:40] gospel is speaking about it. He says in
[56:43] in Colossians, Apostle Paul says, "For
[56:45] you are dead and your life is hid with
[56:48] Christ in God." In James, James has
[56:52] said, "Whereas you know not what shall
[56:54] be on the moral? For what is your life?"
[56:57] He's asking the question, "What is your
[57:00] life? It's even as a vapor that appearth
[57:03] for a little while, a little time, and
[57:06] then vanishes away." So the Bible is
[57:09] acknowledging your life. What is your
[57:12] life? It's even as a vapor. So in one
[57:15] sense we refer to these things as being
[57:17] ours. And yet in another sense we don't
[57:20] own anything.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Do you recognize what I'm saying?
[57:25] Everything. Everything in other words
[57:27] has been entrusted to us. Everything has
[57:30] been entrusted to us.
[57:34] I want you to really think that one
[57:36] over. Everything has been entrusted to
[57:38] you. I'm going to break this down into
[57:43] certain categories this morning. And of
[57:46] course, I can't even begin to cover the
[57:48] subject. In 1 Corinthians 6 and 19, the
[57:51] scripture says, "What? Know ye not that
[57:53] your body is the temple of the Holy
[57:55] Ghost?" So now we're taking a little
[57:57] twist
[57:59] which is in you, which you have of God,
[58:02] you are not your own.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; What is your life? Your life is hid with
[58:10] Christ and God. And now Apostle Paul is
[58:13] taking it uh indexing it around and
[58:15] saying you're not your own. Your body's
[58:17] a temple of the Holy Ghost.
[58:21] Yet we are responsible as stewards and
[58:24] have of what we've been given. We've
[58:27] been given a charge or a responsibility
[58:30] or a stewardship to return to the owner
[58:34] what he has entrusted to us
[58:38] with increase.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; So I'm taking it now a step further. Not
[58:44] just what he's given to you, but God
[58:47] expects and I can show it to you all
[58:49] through the scripture. God expects an
[58:50] increase. And if he doesn't receive an
[58:52] increase,
[58:56] he calls that servant
[58:58] untrustworthy.
[59:00] That's right.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So Jesus teaches on the talents and I
[59:05] read one scripture from the talents and
[59:08] I'm going to be going into it in some
[59:10] depth because I think that the way
[59:12] Jesus, the greatest preacher that ever
[59:14] lived, took the word and how his thought
[59:18] continued on. You need to get into his
[59:21] channel.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And we want to get into his channel this
[59:24] morning. we must in order for me to get
[59:27] uh my burden delivered. For the kingdom
[59:30] of heaven is as a man
[59:33] traveling into a far country who called
[59:37] his own stewards and delivered. He
[59:39] delivered unto them.
[59:42] And this word delivered he he gave over
[59:45] to them.
[59:47] He gave them something to keep.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; He delivered to them. He gave them
[59:52] something to use.
[59:55] He gave them something to take care of.
[59:59] And he gave them something to manage. He
[1:00:02] delivered unto them. And it even goes
[1:00:06] further than that.
[1:00:08] He reached out to us by delivering. And
[1:00:12] what I'm speaking about, he delivered
[1:00:15] his goods.
[1:00:17] What is it that he delivered to us in
[1:00:19] this time? I can tell you he delivered
[1:00:22] to us
[1:00:24] something of his own thoughts and mind
[1:00:27] which had been sealed up
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; for all the centuries and millennia of
[1:00:34] time.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; They had been sealed up
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; from the very beginning.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; What had been sealed with seven seals,
[1:00:43] I'm talking about those goods.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about his spoken word. I'm
[1:00:50] talking about his the revelation of his
[1:00:52] word.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; He never had delivered it to any
[1:00:56] generation.
[1:00:58] But then finally in the end time, he's
[1:01:01] going to actually present it.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He's going to deliver it.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; He's going to put it into our charge.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; He's going to entrust us with it.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And he's going to watch over to see what
[1:01:12] we do with it.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; It is something that he gives over to
[1:01:22] one's care,
[1:01:24] commits it to them.
[1:01:29] He commits it for the purpose of
[1:01:31] observance,
[1:01:33] a religious,
[1:01:35] a sincere observance.
[1:01:39] Quite frankly, I don't think any of us,
[1:01:42] I'm including myself, are nearly as
[1:01:46] sincere with this message as we ought to
[1:01:48] be.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; We are caught,
[1:01:56] and I don't mean this to be in a
[1:01:58] derogatory sense or this to be in a
[1:02:01] negative way, but sometimes we have to
[1:02:03] look at negative things to become
[1:02:05] positive. Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; We are caught in the vortex
[1:02:10] the the just a almost uncontrollable.
[1:02:15] We don't have control of the world
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; and it's just a a whirling
[1:02:22] vortex
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; and Satan has designed everything.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; We're not going to outsmart him. He's a
[1:02:28] cunning enemy.
[1:02:31] He's de he he he uses all kind of
[1:02:34] invention and devices to ent trap and to
[1:02:37] ensnare
[1:02:39] and and and to just to occupy.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; He occupies our minds and occupies our
[1:02:46] time and occupies our energy and wears
[1:02:49] us out on the treadmill as it were. Is
[1:02:52] that not so? This is Satan's Eden.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And it will take some it'll take divine
[1:03:01] strength and guidance
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; for us to be able to isolate ourselves
[1:03:06] in the midst of this age to isolate
[1:03:09] ourselves to a place where God really
[1:03:12] would have us to be. isolate ourselves
[1:03:15] mentally. So we're not worn out mentally
[1:03:18] with every all the activity and all the
[1:03:21] things that of the world, be it
[1:03:23] education or be it business or be it
[1:03:25] cares of life or be it the deceitfulness
[1:03:28] of riches or whatever it might be or
[1:03:30] burdens and and all of these things. It
[1:03:32] it will take all the all the spiritual
[1:03:35] fortitude to isolate ourselves from
[1:03:37] those things.
[1:03:44] Brother Brandham said in sign of his
[1:03:46] coming there has been a message give to
[1:03:49] the elect too
[1:03:52] the word
[1:03:54] the sign
[1:03:59] and to some he gave five talents
[1:04:03] to one he gave five talents
[1:04:06] and to another two
[1:04:10] and to another one,
[1:04:13] to every man
[1:04:15] according to his several ability,
[1:04:19] and straightway he took his journey.
[1:04:28] And further down, and he that received
[1:04:30] five talents came and brought other five
[1:04:33] talents.
[1:04:37] These are just selected verses.
[1:04:39] And also that had received two talents
[1:04:43] came and said, Lord, thou deliverest
[1:04:46] unto me two talents. Behold, I have
[1:04:48] gained two other talents beside them.
[1:04:52] His lord said unto him, well done, good
[1:04:54] and faithful servant.
[1:04:57] Thou hast. And then
[1:05:00] uh verse 23. Let me just go here.
[1:05:13] Then he which had received one talent
[1:05:15] came and said, Lord, I knew
[1:05:18] I knew thee that thou art an hard man,
[1:05:21] reaping where thou hast not sown, and
[1:05:24] gathering where thou hast not straw. and
[1:05:28] I was afraid and I went and hid thy
[1:05:30] talent in the earth. Lo, there thou hast
[1:05:33] that is thine.
[1:05:36] I'm suggesting to you
[1:05:39] and I intend to I intend to really make
[1:05:42] it very very emphatic that what has been
[1:05:45] entrusted to us is not he didn't entrust
[1:05:49] us with history.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't just entrust us with a book
[1:05:53] called the Bible. Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be called and said,
[1:05:57] "Okay, Lord. Here here's the Bible. You
[1:05:59] delivered the Bible to me. I give it
[1:06:01] back to you."
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; He's not going to say, "Uh, you know, I
[1:06:06] delivered uh what did you do with the
[1:06:08] just shall live by faith?"
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That that's not what he's going to ask
[1:06:12] this generation.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to say, "What did you do
[1:06:15] with uh with what I revealed to John
[1:06:18] Wesley and that whole movement at that
[1:06:20] time? Are you sanctified?" He's not
[1:06:23] going to ask that.
[1:06:24] He's not going to say, "Did you ever
[1:06:26] speak in tongues and did you a uh did
[1:06:30] you have some manifestation of the
[1:06:32] spirit as I poured out on Pentecost?"
[1:06:35] That's not what he's going to ask.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "I sent
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; my faithful spirit,
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; with my word in his mouth."
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] And you in your scientific age
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; have even seen where the light, my
[1:07:00] light, struck the lens of a scientific
[1:07:04] camera. And you have seen that and
[1:07:07] you've hung it on your walls. You've had
[1:07:10] it in your bookshelf. You've heard a
[1:07:12] voice and you you know well that he was
[1:07:15] speaking to strangers. And you you you
[1:07:18] knew that I knew Sarah's name when I
[1:07:22] spoke to Abraham, the father of the
[1:07:25] faith, who you feel connected to as a
[1:07:28] child of faith. And you saw how I called
[1:07:32] people by name uh uh when God himself, I
[1:07:37] in my fullness was embodied in the body
[1:07:40] of Jesus Christ and stood and called
[1:07:43] them by name and told them the secret of
[1:07:46] their heart. And now in this age, not
[1:07:48] for 2,000 years, not from that coming to
[1:07:52] this coming has the world seen anything
[1:07:54] like that. And now you have had ready
[1:07:57] access to it. I even came and spoke it
[1:08:00] in your language
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; so there'd be no mistake
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and I entrusted this to you. I didn't
[1:08:08] entrust it to people of other languages.
[1:08:11] I came in this language. I came in a in
[1:08:15] a land of plenty. I came and blessed the
[1:08:19] nation. I came and gave them all that
[1:08:22] was required
[1:08:24] so they could take a hold of what I had
[1:08:27] entrusted to them. Not one talent and
[1:08:30] not two talents and not five talents. I
[1:08:33] gave them all all that had been held as
[1:08:37] a mystery and I exposed the very heart
[1:08:40] of God by bosom to this generation and I
[1:08:44] put it into your hands. I came and
[1:08:47] extended myself to you. I I I delivered
[1:08:51] it to you.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; I delivered it in a way that you cannot
[1:08:54] mistake it.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; I delivered it so you could carry it in
[1:08:58] your pocket and put it in your ear and
[1:09:01] hear this word. And he's going to ask,
[1:09:03] "What did you do with it?"
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And his lord answered and said unto him,
[1:09:20] thou wicked and slothful servant.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Thou knowest that I reap where I sowed
[1:09:25] not,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; and gather where I have not stroed.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Thou artest therefore to have put my
[1:09:31] money to the exchangers.
[1:09:35] And then at thy at and then at my coming
[1:09:37] I should have received mine own with
[1:09:39] usery. God is interested. Don't forget
[1:09:42] this. God is interested in increase.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Whether it's a little increase or a
[1:09:48] large increase, but he's interested in
[1:09:51] increase.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I fear for people say, "Oh, years ago, I
[1:09:56] oh, I had such victory and years ago.
[1:09:59] Years ago, I had such a life with
[1:10:01] Christ. Years ago, I had such a
[1:10:03] communion." That's not what God wants to
[1:10:06] hear. God wants to hear people say, "I
[1:10:09] wouldn't want to be back there. I have
[1:10:11] advanced from that.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, how the word has come alive. How I'm
[1:10:17] walking in his presence now. I'm not
[1:10:20] where I used to be in that childhood
[1:10:22] days.
[1:10:30] Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Take therefore the talent from him and
[1:10:32] give it to him which hath 10 talents. To
[1:10:36] everyone that hath shall be given, and
[1:10:39] he and he shall have an abundance, but
[1:10:42] from him that hath not shall be taken
[1:10:44] away even that which he hath. And cast
[1:10:48] ye the unprofitable servant into utter
[1:10:50] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[1:10:52] nashing of teeth. Don't come and ask me
[1:10:55] is that hell or is that this or
[1:10:57] whatever. All I want to tell you is I
[1:10:58] don't intend to go there.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; I don't intend to end up in that state.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be where there's weeping
[1:11:05] and wailing and nashing of teeth. And we
[1:11:07] don't have to. God has entrusted. I am
[1:11:09] here today as a servant telling you God
[1:11:11] has entrusted to us something he didn't
[1:11:14] even give Martin Luther. He didn't give
[1:11:16] the martyrs in the past.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He gave it to you.
[1:11:24] What an honored people. I don't have to
[1:11:26] sit here and tell you how honored you
[1:11:28] are.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; God has
[1:11:30] God has done what he's done.
[1:11:35] Now watch.
[1:11:39] And then he just says, "There shall be
[1:11:40] weeping and nashing of teeth." And then
[1:11:42] then he breaks right into another
[1:11:43] subject, but he's following straight
[1:11:45] through. I want you to watch this very
[1:11:47] close.
[1:11:49] When the son of man, this is verse 31 of
[1:11:52] Matthew 25, and when the son of man
[1:11:55] shall come in his glory, now he's
[1:11:57] stepped from where he is
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; right to our time.
[1:12:03] There's just a there's a 2,000 plus year
[1:12:06] lapse here now. And he's taken a quantum
[1:12:09] leap.
[1:12:12] And when the Son of Man shall come in
[1:12:14] his glory, and all the holy angels with
[1:12:16] him, then shall he sit upon the throne
[1:12:19] of his glory, and before him shall be
[1:12:22] gathered all nations, and he shall
[1:12:24] separate them one from the other, as a
[1:12:27] shepherd divideth his sheep from his
[1:12:29] goats. Now he has come to the white
[1:12:31] throne.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So the first part is the talents of what
[1:12:36] has been entrusted to the people, to
[1:12:38] those he delivered all of his goods. I
[1:12:41] can tell you he didn't deliver all of
[1:12:43] his goods to the goats.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So now he's coming and he shall and he
[1:12:52] shall set the sheep on his right hand uh
[1:12:55] but the goats on his left. Brother
[1:12:57] Brandham said there isn't we we there
[1:12:59] isn't enough emphasis put upon rewards.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Why is he saying that? Because a person
[1:13:04] can have a greater reward or a lesser
[1:13:06] reward.
[1:13:09] Then shall the king say to them on the
[1:13:11] right hand, notice now, then shall the
[1:13:14] king say to him, we're following right
[1:13:15] along in perfect continuity. Then shall
[1:13:18] the king say unto them on the right
[1:13:20] hand, come ye blessed of my father,
[1:13:23] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:13:25] from the foundation of the world, for
[1:13:30] I wasn't hungered
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and you gave me meat.
[1:13:37] I want you to notice
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; what he says.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I was
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and hungered.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And you gave me.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I was thirsty
[1:13:56] and you gave me drink.
[1:13:59] I was a stranger
[1:14:03] and you took me in.
[1:14:07] Let me just stop here.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just needing
[1:14:16] He wasn't hungry just for some church
[1:14:18] services.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just hungry.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; For some light fellowship.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even just hungry for a nice
[1:14:34] musical presentation
[1:14:37] where they had a choir singing or sister
[1:14:39] Melissa played and all these things are
[1:14:42] nice and lovely
[1:14:44] but it needs to bring you into a certain
[1:14:46] atmosphere
[1:14:49] and it's even how you can hear somebody
[1:14:52] sing or hear somebody play or hear hear
[1:14:56] somebody preach.
[1:14:58] I'm not here to give you some
[1:15:00] intellectual exercise.
[1:15:03] I'm here that you might allow these
[1:15:06] things to sink into the deep recess of
[1:15:09] your soul and say, "God, however it's
[1:15:11] spoken, whether he's loud or whether
[1:15:13] he's quiet or whether the church is cold
[1:15:15] or whether it's hot, help me to get a
[1:15:17] hold of what this moment, help me to
[1:15:20] seize this moment."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; I was a stranger and you took me in
[1:15:28] naked
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; and you clothed me. Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I was sick
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; and you visited me.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I was in prison
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; and you came unto me.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Then shall the righteous say,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; when did we see you hungry?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't re I don't I don't
[1:15:55] believe I ever saw you hungry.
[1:16:00] and we fed you.
[1:16:05] I've tried to get a point across to this
[1:16:07] congregation for a long time and today I
[1:16:09] felt I'm going to really really strongly
[1:16:12] emphasize it.
[1:16:15] If if there has been any blessing
[1:16:20] upon this congregation,
[1:16:23] if there has been any blessing upon
[1:16:25] Cloverdale Bible Way, it is solely
[1:16:30] on one subject. The pivotal point is we
[1:16:34] took
[1:16:36] what God has delivered to us
[1:16:40] and did everything within our strength
[1:16:43] to feed somebody else who's hungry.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Feed that which we have ate.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not interested in anybody
[1:16:55] else's ideas. I'm not interested in
[1:16:57] Christian psychologists. I'm not
[1:16:59] interested in other books. I'm
[1:17:01] interested in the message that came in
[1:17:02] this time. There are depths of truth and
[1:17:07] depths of revelation that I know I
[1:17:09] haven't touched.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Maybe you're way beyond
[1:17:14] me, but I can read some of the simplest
[1:17:17] things
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; as I read the opening phrases of this
[1:17:21] message in Tiffan, Georgia. And soon as
[1:17:23] I soon as I read those opening word
[1:17:26] words,
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; the judge is here. and I'm representing
[1:17:31] him.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I could not come to this pulpit till I
[1:17:34] had heard that whole service.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Let me grasp. Let me understand. What is
[1:17:42] it that you're telling us? What is it
[1:17:44] that you're laying out for this
[1:17:46] generation? What is it that is what is
[1:17:48] it that I must lay a hold of? Do you
[1:17:50] know why, friends? Because every person
[1:17:53] that I'm speaking to, including myself,
[1:17:56] we're going to pass from this little
[1:17:58] scene either by the rapture, by the
[1:18:01] resurrection, one way or the other. But
[1:18:03] I want to hear well done.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; We must hear it.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; We must hear it.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And why would we let the devil in this
[1:18:14] world uh rob us of that those words? Why
[1:18:18] would we allow him to absorb us, to
[1:18:21] distract us, to swallow us up in all
[1:18:24] this vain, empty ashes?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you believe it.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And we exert ourselves and we wear
[1:18:34] ourselves out and we just churn
[1:18:36] ourselves and all all the mental strain
[1:18:40] and all the all all the turmoil we go
[1:18:42] through for what?
[1:18:56] When did we see you as a stranger?
[1:19:02] When did we see you naked
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and put clothing on you?
[1:19:07] Brother Brandham said clearly, "He's
[1:19:10] been sent."
[1:19:12] And if we can get this bride to stand
[1:19:14] still long enough, he'll clothe her in
[1:19:16] the rose.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; You can have the finest garment or
[1:19:19] whatever kind of garment. This isn't
[1:19:21] even God bless brother Richard and the
[1:19:23] men of vision whatever more sending
[1:19:25] clothing and and I think that's a part
[1:19:27] of it
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; but that's very much secondary to taking
[1:19:32] this word and getting it to somebody so
[1:19:35] that their soul has been clothed in
[1:19:37] righteousness
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; and they've had the opportunity to
[1:19:41] believe it because when Abraham believed
[1:19:44] it was accounted to him for
[1:19:46] righteousness and the bride the bride
[1:19:50] are you listening listening to me. The
[1:19:51] bride was arrayed in fine linen, which
[1:19:55] is the righteousness of the saints.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been entrusted with.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You've got the cloth.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; You've got the righteousness. You've got
[1:20:05] the robe.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; I, he said,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; was naked.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; And you clothed me.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; We did.
[1:20:21] When when did I clothe you, Lord?
[1:20:25] Oh,
[1:20:27] when you either lived,
[1:20:30] you manifested in a certain way, you
[1:20:33] demonstrated,
[1:20:36] you actually lived the very word that I
[1:20:38] sent.
[1:20:40] You gave a message book,
[1:20:43] you gave a tape, and someone had the
[1:20:46] opportunity.
[1:20:48] And that was my seed in them craving for
[1:20:51] this.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And you gave them the opportunity
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; to believe
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; and they believed and became clothed
[1:21:00] with the bride's robe.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Am I off in left field or do you
[1:21:07] understand?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; When saw we these sick are in prison and
[1:21:19] came unto thee. And the king shall
[1:21:21] answer and say unto them, oh king,
[1:21:27] let me hear, let me hear these words.
[1:21:32] And the king shall say, verily I say
[1:21:34] unto you, in as much as you have done it
[1:21:38] unto one of the least of these, my
[1:21:40] brethren, you did it unto me.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; That's not giving some pan handler on
[1:21:51] the street
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; a dollar
[1:21:55] or $5 to go in and get a hamburger.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's not what he's talking about.
[1:22:05] All the hamburger in the world
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; isn't worth one of these verses.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Oh king,
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; I said this congregation, don't you want
[1:22:21] to hear the king?
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And the king shall come and say,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; blessed are ye.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] I believe
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; I was a stranger and you took me. Not
[1:22:46] in, he speaks to the others.
[1:22:50] Then shall he answer them, saying,
[1:22:51] "Verily I say unto you, in as much as
[1:22:54] you did it not to one of the least of
[1:22:57] these, you did it not to me. And these
[1:23:01] shall go away into everlasting
[1:23:03] punishment,
[1:23:05] but the righteous
[1:23:07] into life eternal."
[1:23:11] Brother Brandham says
[1:23:14] in the arrow of God's deliverance,
[1:23:18] God loves the truth,
[1:23:22] the truth shall set you free. God wants
[1:23:24] you to know the truth.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Christ is the truth, the Holy Ghost. And
[1:23:29] if the Holy Ghost is in you,
[1:23:33] he feeds on the word of God.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. and not on televisions and true
[1:23:39] story magazines and love books.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; This I've never seen such an insanity
[1:23:46] that seems to be upon the people. It
[1:23:50] Valentine's used to be something that
[1:23:52] you know when I was a boy they you know
[1:23:54] they make they make some little heart
[1:23:56] and so on and and and make a card and in
[1:24:00] school let the kids take it home to
[1:24:01] their mom and dad.
[1:24:04] You're the newspaper. I got a newspaper
[1:24:06] this last week and it's just absolutely
[1:24:08] I mean the the adults have gone insane.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; The whole country is insane.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; They got a huge articles on kissing and
[1:24:18] all kinds of love and places to go and
[1:24:21] the travel industry that Isn't this
[1:24:24] absolutely absurd?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't this bizarre?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't this wild?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? It's satanic.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; It's demonic. Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; God deliver us from that.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Even the less we see of it, the less
[1:24:40] contact we have, the better off we are.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's you people calling
[1:24:53] yourselves Christians wrap yourself up
[1:24:55] in
[1:24:57] why do your children," He said, just
[1:24:59] look here. In less than three months
[1:25:02] time, every teenage kid in the country
[1:25:05] from five years old to 18 knew Davy Cro
[1:25:09] who Davy Crockett was.
[1:25:12] Now, Brother Brandham's not taking up
[1:25:14] our time to waste our time.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; He's not just telling us some little
[1:25:18] stories. He's nailing down principles of
[1:25:20] life.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Says the Holy Spirit feeds on the word.
[1:25:28] He says all out on the street singing
[1:25:31] Davy Crockett some kind of fiction story
[1:25:34] nonsense killed a bear when he was 3
[1:25:36] years old. He says how crazy. But the
[1:25:38] kids will wear skit skin caps
[1:25:42] and everything else and guns on their
[1:25:44] side.
[1:25:46] Oh, he says a 10- cent store just full
[1:25:48] of it everywhere. everywhere else. He
[1:25:50] says, "And you Christians now,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; and you Christians with the message of
[1:25:57] God,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; now don't tell me that he just talking
[1:26:00] to somebody back there." And you
[1:26:02] Christians, us Christians with the
[1:26:05] message of God
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; in the world could put that over and
[1:26:10] sell a lot of nonsense and stuff to
[1:26:13] kids. He says, "How much more?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; How much more?"
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; How much more
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; ought the Christians to put over the
[1:26:23] program of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:26:27] power of the Holy Ghost?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; The resurrection and eternal life and
[1:26:33] the coming of the Lord.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; How much more?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; How much more? He didn't deliver it. He
[1:26:43] didn't deliver this message to the
[1:26:44] university. He didn't open up the seven
[1:26:47] seals. Who knows about the serpent seed?
[1:26:50] You should be able to say, "I do."
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Who knows about the tribulation? I do.
[1:26:57] Who knows about the change of the body?
[1:27:00] I do.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Who knows about Melzdc? I do.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Who knows about the theophony standing
[1:27:07] beside you? I do. You do.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] Yeah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; How? How come you know? How come you can
[1:27:20] say I do? Cuz it's been delivered to
[1:27:22] you.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He delivered not his goods. He
[1:27:25] delivered. Are you listening to me? He
[1:27:28] delivered all his goods.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Says there be no secret left. There be
[1:27:37] no mystery left. I'll open it all. I'll
[1:27:40] deliver it to them. Hand deliver it to
[1:27:42] them. I'll deliver it to them in their
[1:27:44] language.
[1:27:47] I'll deliver to them in humility.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; I'll deliver to them with the same signs
[1:27:52] that I did in Jesus Christ.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; I'll deliver it with the same power
[1:27:58] accompanying it.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I'll deliver it so it is proven to be
[1:28:03] me.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I'll prove it over and over again.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; There'll be no mistake.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I'm delivering all the talents to them.
[1:28:17] And then I'll call men
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I'll call women
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; certain and give skills
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and abilities
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; severally
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; as I will
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; so they can f fulfill
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; the ultimate purpose
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; of delivering
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and making certain that every place I'm
[1:28:40] hungry I'll get food
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and where I'm naked I'll be clothed.
[1:28:45] And where I'm sick and wounded, I'll be
[1:28:47] healed.
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going through my
[1:28:55] heart right now. I' I've had to answer
[1:28:57] emails this last week. Why are you going
[1:29:01] to these people?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Why are you going to them?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; And I had to write a pastor
[1:29:09] because the people are wounded.
[1:29:11] Because these people are hurt.
[1:29:15] Because these people, one who claimed to
[1:29:18] be their pastor, betrayed them terribly
[1:29:24] and they lost confidence and they lost
[1:29:27] respect
[1:29:30] and are scattered.
[1:29:32] They're isolated
[1:29:34] and they're crying
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; and I hear them.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; They're saying, "Will you come?"
[1:29:47] Sometimes this body that is getting some
[1:29:49] years on it starts to put some
[1:29:52] restraint. I don't want to go through
[1:29:54] that jet lag. I don't want to go through
[1:29:56] that. I don't want to I don't want to
[1:29:59] sit in a room
[1:30:01] from morning till night. I don't want my
[1:30:04] wife to just sit there.
[1:30:07] Think we should be able to maybe start
[1:30:09] enjoying a little bit of life. I've sat
[1:30:12] in rooms and hotel rooms and little
[1:30:14] rooms and houses and so on. I've spent
[1:30:18] thousands of hours there.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:30:24] Somebody needs to be clothed.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to be healed.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody's calling. Yes, sir.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And I hear a cry.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And you people have to know what it is
[1:30:37] that I personally am responding to. And
[1:30:39] you got somebody. It might even be in
[1:30:41] your own family. It might even be in
[1:30:43] your own home. Might be your own
[1:30:45] children
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; crying
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; to see the kind of they read it and they
[1:30:51] hear it over the pulpit. Now they want
[1:30:53] to see it in mom and dad
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; and they have a right to say it.
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; They want to see it
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; They hear about this great supernatural
[1:31:08] God. I'm here today to declare he's here
[1:31:10] now.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He's with us now.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:23] in why little Bethlehem.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come and stand by my side." A
[1:31:30] prophet calling, "Come and stand by my
[1:31:31] side." Who stands in a terrible place?
[1:31:34] He considered himself standing in a
[1:31:36] terrible place. He said, "I challenge
[1:31:38] you today. These types go over the
[1:31:40] world."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I go over the world."
[1:31:44] These types go over the world. This
[1:31:46] voice goes over the world. This message
[1:31:48] goes over the world. He stands in a
[1:31:50] terrible place. What a place of
[1:31:52] responsibility.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching you a sermon. I'm
[1:31:58] telling you, I'm making a declaration
[1:31:59] today. And he delivered it, handd
[1:32:01] delivered it to you.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; You got it on your shelves.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You got it in your books.
[1:32:09] You have it beside your bed.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; And that's not where it's supposed to
[1:32:13] stay.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond that.
[1:32:18] You might say, "I can I can just feel
[1:32:20] it.
[1:32:21] Oh. Oh, what can I do? Even if you got
[1:32:24] one,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; even if you got one talent,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; you better not be hiding it.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's going to come back and say,
[1:32:31] "What did you do with this one talent?"
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I just felt that I couldn't. I
[1:32:37] just felt I'm just a woman. I'm just
[1:32:39] this. I'm just a young person. I could
[1:32:42] tell you story after story, account
[1:32:44] after account. And the prophet said, "If
[1:32:47] you're a housewife,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; be the best housewife."
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You're a mother, be the best mother.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:32:59] he says, "These tapes go over the
[1:33:01] world." He said, "I challenge some men,
[1:33:04] some warriors who loves Jesus Christ."
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, I believe it was Timothy Ma
[1:33:11] left for Vietnam. He's probably there
[1:33:13] right now. this congregation. If we
[1:33:16] can't do anything else, we can't go
[1:33:17] there. We can't be with him. But one
[1:33:19] thing you can do is prevail upon God.
[1:33:23] Oh, Father, send the Holy Spirit into
[1:33:26] that little man. And may he have a
[1:33:28] burning like he's never experienced
[1:33:30] before. May he realize what he's been
[1:33:33] entrusted with. May he May he be may he
[1:33:36] be directed right to the very doorstep,
[1:33:39] right to the very place of somebody
[1:33:41] who's hungering.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; That you might be fed.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:33:53] he said, I challenge some man, some
[1:33:55] warriors who loves Jesus Christ that
[1:33:58] knows that these things has got to be
[1:34:00] fulfilled. Brethren, come and stand by
[1:34:02] my side and pull the word of God. Forget
[1:34:06] those dry sistns and stagnated
[1:34:08] denominations. You might say, "Well, I'm
[1:34:10] not in the denomination." Sometimes
[1:34:12] people are are drawing on on their mind,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; on their reasoning,
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; what they think it is, and it's not the
[1:34:20] word of God at all. He draw on this
[1:34:22] word. He said Jesus is desiring a drink
[1:34:26] of fresh Pentecostal water.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He's not wanting a drink of some
[1:34:33] history.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; He said that's his desire today.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Back to the original Pentecost.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pentecost wasn't just some
[1:34:44] emotionalism.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Pentecost was an experience.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; That attracted others.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May the fire of God burn in
[1:34:55] this congregation.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Tell people everywhere, whether it be
[1:34:58] Lynon, Bellingham, Seattle, Vancouver,
[1:35:01] may they see it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; May they hear it
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; and the elect will come.
[1:35:10] Praise God.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; There's a couple of a couple of phrases
[1:35:14] which I put my feet on and they're so
[1:35:18] wonderful,
[1:35:20] so solid. The prophet of God said,
[1:35:24] "Don't forget this. The bride is
[1:35:28] attracted to the bridegroom."
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I've got some serious things to say.
[1:35:36] The bridegroom is the revealed word.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was not content to hear Ezer
[1:35:44] just telling her about Isaac. I want to
[1:35:47] see him.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Will you go with this man? Yes, I will
[1:35:53] go.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; She want to see Isaac.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The bride is attracted to the
[1:36:02] bridegroom.
[1:36:04] after I put one on my feet. And the
[1:36:06] other one is all that the Father hath
[1:36:09] given me shall come
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of them.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; What's been entrusted to you
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; is a word that will actually show. Put
[1:36:25] it right on the screen either in your
[1:36:28] face, in your life, in your
[1:36:30] conversation, in your home or wherever
[1:36:33] it might be at your job or wherever
[1:36:34] more. It will show visibly
[1:36:38] the bridegroom.
[1:36:41] Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And they see that.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And when I preach,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; if I fail to bring people
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; face to face with the bridegroom,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I feel that I failed in my calling.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; I don't only want you to see him.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I want him to be so visible. I want him
[1:37:05] I want you to feel it. I want you to be
[1:37:07] quivering down in your soul in the
[1:37:10] recess of your soul. Say, "This is
[1:37:12] gripping me."
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Fine.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Worship him. He's worthy of worship.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; So, it's him that hungers.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; It's him that thirsts.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And he's thirsting for the word.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:35] Hear
[1:37:37] me good. He's not thirsting
[1:37:40] for your explanation. The best thing you
[1:37:43] can do is give them the word itself.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why I'm so obsessed
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; and you might as well give up in ever
[1:37:53] trying to change me because I'm too far
[1:37:54] down the road. Now I am obsessed
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; in seeing people get it, get the message
[1:37:59] in their language.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; They need to hear it. They need to see
[1:38:04] it. And God's going to God's going to
[1:38:06] open their eyes. And the revelation,
[1:38:08] what I see happening in China is just so
[1:38:11] gripping.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; So gripping.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; It's God.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; But you know, some of you young people,
[1:38:21] you're going to come up and say,
[1:38:24] "When when did I see you hungry?"
[1:38:29] Or remember
[1:38:32] remember when you took this activity,
[1:38:34] you did something
[1:38:38] and you all got together
[1:38:41] and you had those messages printed
[1:38:44] or remember when you spoke to that
[1:38:47] person
[1:38:49] and you invited them
[1:38:51] and they came
[1:38:53] they came to the house of God and they
[1:38:55] heard remember that.
[1:38:58] Yeah. But I didn't realize
[1:39:01] I didn't realize it was you that was
[1:39:03] hungry.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Remember when that one came
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; and believed
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; oh how precious
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; how wonderful it is.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Sister Lynn Frangos I gave your
[1:39:20] testimony or part of it
[1:39:23] and I have given it several times and I
[1:39:25] hope it'll be fine.
[1:39:30] A lot of you folks know brother Paul,
[1:39:32] sister Lynn.
[1:39:40] And it was brother Paul's birthday, I
[1:39:41] believe. And he asked if Sister Lynn
[1:39:44] would accompany him to church. Isn't
[1:39:46] that about it?
[1:39:51] on the way in the car. So, would it be
[1:39:53] all right if we just play some Christian
[1:39:54] music?
[1:39:57] Okay, I'll be fine.
[1:40:01] The Holy Spirit had not
[1:40:06] had not really revealed Christ to her at
[1:40:09] that moment yet.
[1:40:12] And if I have it correct,
[1:40:15] I believe it was Wilder driving
[1:40:18] in the car.
[1:40:20] And Lynn says, "Who cares?
[1:40:25] Nobody cares.
[1:40:29] Who cares anyway?"
[1:40:32] And they drove to church.
[1:40:35] And when they got here and Paul wanted
[1:40:38] to read some scripture and I think I
[1:40:40] believe at the breakfast table if I'm
[1:40:42] not if I'm not mistaken and he read
[1:40:44] Psalms 23.
[1:40:47] The Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[1:40:49] want.
[1:40:51] And when they came to church I believe
[1:40:53] they sat right here in front.
[1:40:58] And brother Tom, servant of God, came
[1:41:01] out,
[1:41:04] stood at the pulpit and said, "Who
[1:41:06] cares?"
[1:41:11] said, "Jesus cares."
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Who do you think that was for?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Who do you think that was for?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And open up his Bible and read Psalms
[1:41:23] 23.
[1:41:27] I could say sister Lynn Frangos could
[1:41:29] never forget that experience.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You know why? It was God
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; through her husband,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; through a servant delivering his message
[1:41:43] to her.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Sister L.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:02] Can I have just a little more time?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We must look upon everything
[1:42:11] that we are or possess
[1:42:16] as given by God
[1:42:18] for the furtherance of his kingdom
[1:42:21] and his eternal purpose. And we must not
[1:42:25] allow the world to subvert,
[1:42:29] cloud or confuse
[1:42:32] that objective.
[1:42:34] God's eternal purpose must not be lost
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; in the swirl of this world's
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; activity and events.
[1:42:46] And when the eternal objective is held
[1:42:49] in sharp focus,
[1:42:51] then and only then will life's labors
[1:42:56] be a satisfying fulfillment to us.
[1:42:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that
[1:43:08] unto one he gave five talents and to
[1:43:10] another two and to another one and to
[1:43:12] every man according to his several
[1:43:14] ability. His ability is his power or his
[1:43:17] strength or his might or hers inherent
[1:43:21] inherent power. people. There are people
[1:43:24] here that have mental abilities I I'll
[1:43:27] never never even I couldn't even be in
[1:43:30] their dust.
[1:43:32] There's people here that have certain
[1:43:35] qualities of of character, nature, and
[1:43:39] you might think,
[1:43:41] you know, I have people that I respect
[1:43:43] and so on, but I look at people, I study
[1:43:45] people. I'm a great student of people.
[1:43:48] And I look at people in the congregation
[1:43:50] and I I see things I see it in the young
[1:43:54] people. I see it in certain individuals
[1:43:57] and I see things that I really yearn
[1:44:00] for.
[1:44:02] I say that's lovely.
[1:44:06] That's Christ.
[1:44:08] That's your spirit.
[1:44:11] And I admire it
[1:44:13] and I yearn
[1:44:15] to attain to that.
[1:44:18] You say, "Brother Biscll, are you at
[1:44:20] your age?" Absolutely.
[1:44:23] And I never lose that.
[1:44:28] I think that's a good pattern to follow.
[1:44:31] Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Listen closely into everyone's their
[1:44:35] several ability.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Some have physical strength. Some have
[1:44:41] mental skills and mental powers.
[1:44:44] But always remember this as the Apostle
[1:44:47] Paul said to young Timothy, "For we
[1:44:51] brought nothing into this world and it
[1:44:53] is certain we can carry nothing out.
[1:44:59] We're stewards. And now I'm breaking it
[1:45:01] down.
[1:45:04] You're stewards of your time.
[1:45:10] God has given every person that I'm
[1:45:12] speaking to in this building, in the
[1:45:16] fellowship room, in the nursery,
[1:45:19] you on the internet or whoever will hear
[1:45:22] this. I want to make the statement. God
[1:45:24] has actually given you an aotment of
[1:45:27] time.
[1:45:30] Some are shorter,
[1:45:32] some are average,
[1:45:34] and some may be longer.
[1:45:38] But God
[1:45:40] gave that to you, entrusted that to you.
[1:45:47] Not so that we came to the end and we
[1:45:48] said, "Well, I I'm I'm I'm thankful.
[1:45:52] I've I've lived my life out.
[1:45:55] That isn't what he's going to ask. I got
[1:45:57] to be honest now. He's going to say, "I
[1:46:00] gave you 42 years." No, I gave you 55
[1:46:04] years. I gave you 67 years. I gave you
[1:46:07] Edisco 74 years or 75 years. What did
[1:46:12] you do with that allotment?
[1:46:17] Well, I worked
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; or I bought
[1:46:22] and I sold. And what did you do with
[1:46:25] that?
[1:46:27] What did you do with this allotment of
[1:46:29] time?
[1:46:32] And many will say, not believers, but
[1:46:35] they'll say, "Well, I ate, drank, and I
[1:46:36] was married."
[1:46:39] And thus, you receive your reward.
[1:46:44] A woman may say,
[1:46:47] "With the time that you gave me on
[1:46:49] earth,
[1:46:51] I bore some children to my husband.
[1:46:56] I cradled those babies.
[1:47:01] I told them
[1:47:03] of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:06] I read to them,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; the scriptures.
[1:47:10] I let them know that God had sent a
[1:47:14] messenger to our time and I had such
[1:47:17] deep respect for that and I tried to
[1:47:19] convey that over to them and to instill
[1:47:22] in them.
[1:47:26] And during that time
[1:47:29] I sought to
[1:47:32] watch over my mouth
[1:47:34] and our conversation.
[1:47:37] Brother Brandham says those children
[1:47:41] who called Elijah, "Oh, you bald head,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; they heard it at the dinner table.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; What have your children heard at the
[1:47:57] dinner table recently?"
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I said this would be serious. I
[1:48:07] forewarned you. God's going to hold you
[1:48:10] accountable for what your children hear
[1:48:11] at the dinner table.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; But we spend our time talking about this
[1:48:19] and talking about that, criticizing this
[1:48:21] and criticizing that. God's going to
[1:48:23] hold you accountable for that. And then
[1:48:26] your children raise up
[1:48:30] and said, "Well, we were disrespectful
[1:48:32] to the deacons." Or, "Well, we said
[1:48:34] things were disrespectful to the
[1:48:35] ministry." And then you think that your
[1:48:38] children are going to be raised and have
[1:48:39] respect.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; No, they'll never have respect.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Or you were just loose about the you
[1:48:48] were just loose about the message
[1:48:51] and about the gathering. Yeah. Well, the
[1:48:53] prophet said we should be waiting at the
[1:48:55] doors when the service opens,
[1:48:59] but you know, I don't think that
[1:49:00] Wednesday's important. I don't think
[1:49:02] Sunday night's important. If we we're
[1:49:04] we're Sunday morning go to church
[1:49:07] people.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I don't think it's good enough.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I don't think God thinks it's good
[1:49:18] enough.
[1:49:19] And furthermore, I believe that God's
[1:49:21] going to hold you accountable.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; What do you think, brother Brandon was
[1:49:32] saying when he said instead of being to
[1:49:34] the prayer meeting, they were watching I
[1:49:36] Love Susy or something else? So, so
[1:49:39] maybe weren't watching I Love Susy. You
[1:49:41] don't have a television. That's great.
[1:49:43] But maybe we're doing something else
[1:49:45] that is just we're all caught up and and
[1:49:47] so instead of being in the house of God,
[1:49:49] instead of having the opportunity to
[1:49:51] shake somebody's hand and say, "God
[1:49:52] bless you, sister. God bless you,
[1:49:54] brother." And instead of being able to
[1:49:56] say, "Amen. Amen, brother. Amen,
[1:49:59] pastor." And letting them know, "I'm
[1:50:01] behind you. I'm supporting. I'm part of
[1:50:04] this whole work." The offering comes by.
[1:50:07] Don't go buy the offering box because
[1:50:09] they because not because the pastor
[1:50:11] calls on her. you got some gimmick or
[1:50:13] selling some book because a prophet says
[1:50:15] that that believers tithe.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Does 100% of this congregation believe
[1:50:21] that?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You believe that's what Elijah said?
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; He said that giving is a part of
[1:50:27] worship.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; And so we're going to be accountable for
[1:50:34] our time.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; We're going to be accountable for our
[1:50:38] possessions.
[1:50:46] And he said unto them, "Take heed and
[1:50:48] beware of covetousness,
[1:50:50] for a man's life consisteth not in the
[1:50:53] abundance of the things which he
[1:50:54] possessth."
[1:50:56] That's a scripture.
[1:50:59] And if God puts things into your hands,
[1:51:02] and there's some you may say, I've had
[1:51:05] people in the congregation,
[1:51:07] and some God has entrusted great
[1:51:11] possessions to them,
[1:51:13] and others God has called,
[1:51:17] called them quickly,
[1:51:19] called them while they were sitting in
[1:51:21] their chair, and I had to personally go
[1:51:23] and gather all their possessions and
[1:51:26] store them in my garage. And there was
[1:51:28] no family, no children, no wife, no one
[1:51:31] else. And I had to spend the time
[1:51:34] sorting it out,
[1:51:36] one piece of paper at a time, one book
[1:51:38] at a time.
[1:51:40] Found a cashier's check for $6,500,
[1:51:44] and I had to give it to the government.
[1:51:47] He was a lovely believer, and all his
[1:51:50] possessions went to the government.
[1:51:55] And I said I said to the administrator I
[1:51:58] said where does this where does this
[1:52:00] money go that just into a slush fund
[1:52:03] just goes into a slush fund and the
[1:52:05] government spends it for whatever they
[1:52:07] want.
[1:52:09] If I were a steward I think to be a good
[1:52:11] steward I'd say I would want that to
[1:52:14] continue. I would want that to go
[1:52:15] someplace where it's going to do
[1:52:16] something
[1:52:18] for believers for the kingdom of God. I
[1:52:20] don't have any children. I don't have I
[1:52:22] I don't I I I I don't say uh you know a
[1:52:26] negative thing about the brother at all.
[1:52:27] It was just he just went through life
[1:52:29] and and uh carried on. But I didn't
[1:52:33] think it was if you ask me is that good
[1:52:36] stewardship? I say no. I don't think
[1:52:37] it's good stewardship.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I believe that a man has a
[1:52:41] responsibility to his family, to his
[1:52:43] wife, to his children.
[1:52:51] Riches are deceitful.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; If God puts something in your hand,
[1:52:55] don't forget it's not for you alone.
[1:53:00] It's for your family,
[1:53:02] for the work of God.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; For the kingdom of God.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus said, "He also that
[1:53:12] received the seed among the thorns is he
[1:53:15] don't he received the seed among the
[1:53:18] thorns is he that heareth the word and
[1:53:22] and the care of this world. And the
[1:53:25] deceitfulness of riches and the
[1:53:27] deceitfulness is simply deceiving.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Riches are deceiving
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and the deceitfulness of riches choke
[1:53:35] the word."
[1:53:36] You know, when you're choked, it may not
[1:53:38] happen in 5 minutes, may not happen in a
[1:53:41] day, may not happen in a year, but it
[1:53:43] will eventually choke the word. And the
[1:53:46] Bible says, "And it becometh
[1:53:48] unfruitful."
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in his life story. Am I
[1:53:52] taking too long?
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; He was telling about his early life when
[1:53:59] he and his wife were young. He said,
[1:54:02] 'But friends.' He said, ' It was just a
[1:54:05] paradise on earth. He said, 'We had each
[1:54:08] other.'
[1:54:10] He said, 'I'd become converted in that
[1:54:12] time, become a minister, and was
[1:54:14] preaching, and I loved the Lord with all
[1:54:17] my heart. And we loved one another, and
[1:54:20] that's all we cared for. And listen,
[1:54:24] happiness does not consist of how much
[1:54:27] of this world's goods you own, but how
[1:54:30] contented you are with the portion
[1:54:33] that's allotted to you. Do you know
[1:54:35] there's people that have vast
[1:54:39] possessions
[1:54:41] and they they're not content? They're
[1:54:44] not happy.
[1:54:46] Amen.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; I've never told this, but the brother
[1:54:50] that led us into the ministry, he worked
[1:54:53] for some very very an exclusive group of
[1:54:55] very very wealthy people.
[1:54:58] And there was a
[1:55:01] there was a gentleman
[1:55:03] uh and he owned a he owned a wire
[1:55:06] manufacturing company. His name will
[1:55:08] just come back to me in a moment.
[1:55:11] And down in the Midwest, maybe around
[1:55:16] Wisconsin or Chicago or someplace,
[1:55:19] Kitsamman was his name. Kitsamman wire.
[1:55:24] And he was not a wellman.
[1:55:29] He became sick.
[1:55:31] And he built he built this mansion of
[1:55:34] several stories.
[1:55:36] And he built it on a turntable because
[1:55:38] he needed to have uh sunshine.
[1:55:43] And every floor was a complete living.
[1:55:46] Every floor, massive. Every floor. In
[1:55:48] case he was on the fourth floor, didn't
[1:55:50] want to go downstairs. He just stayed up
[1:55:52] there. But as the sun went went one
[1:55:56] direction to the other, he just turned
[1:55:58] the entire house so he could always have
[1:56:01] the sunshine.
[1:56:05] Mr. Kitsman and brother Chet McGriff
[1:56:08] worked for him was his own personal
[1:56:10] landscaper and adviser on his yard and
[1:56:13] so on. And that man have something wrong
[1:56:16] with his stomach.
[1:56:18] And he said, "I would give all that I
[1:56:22] have just to have a healthy stomach."
[1:56:27] And then people would look at that and
[1:56:28] say, "Oh, oh, didn't mean nothing.
[1:56:33] All of that mansion and all of that
[1:56:35] wealth and all of that factory and all
[1:56:38] of that money and all of that esteem and
[1:56:40] all of that glory was only worth just a
[1:56:42] piece of flesh called a stomach.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Our possessions don't mean anything.
[1:56:53] Just give me a few more minutes and I be
[1:56:55] I'm going to just close whether I'm done
[1:56:57] or not in about 15 minutes. So you know
[1:57:00] at quarter to 1 I'm quitting.
[1:57:03] You may not have thought about this but
[1:57:06] God has allotted you your health.
[1:57:10] Going to say some things.
[1:57:14] You've read articles I have to eat
[1:57:17] yourself to death.
[1:57:22] Some of this refined food. You think
[1:57:25] it's the devil trying to make you
[1:57:26] healthy? No. He trying to make you sick.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not a a health nut,
[1:57:36] but I like to eat healthy.
[1:57:39] I think we should eat healthy.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you want.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; I think that we I I believe that your
[1:57:49] health has been a sacred trust to you.
[1:57:54] I've actually sat down and had serious
[1:57:56] talk with my wife. I said, "We have a
[1:58:00] responsibility to our children,
[1:58:04] to live as healthy as we can, to be as
[1:58:07] active as we can, to be as alert as we
[1:58:10] can, to be mother and dad as long as we
[1:58:14] can.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; We have a duty to them."
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Drew,
[1:58:18] some affliction might come. I just
[1:58:20] thought I'd throw that in. do what you
[1:58:22] want with it,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; but I want you to take it seriously. I
[1:58:28] believe that your health is in something
[1:58:31] that's been entrusted to you by God.
[1:58:34] Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And quite frankly, I wouldn't just live
[1:58:38] on a bunch of fast foods.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And a bunch of bags of this and bags of
[1:58:43] that. And you know, uh uh
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; go go go down to the garden, find
[1:58:50] somebody, you're going to think I'm way
[1:58:52] off, but go and get some, you know,
[1:58:55] healthy food or organic something or
[1:58:57] whatever more.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Anyhow, do like brother Garrett. So
[1:59:02] anyway,
[1:59:07] Do you want a scripture?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Know ye not that your body
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; is a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; which is in you which you have of God
[1:59:19] and you're not your own.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You're not your own.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; That your body belongs to God.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; It's a gift from God. Your health is a
[1:59:29] gift from God. Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; And don't you if any man defile the
[1:59:34] temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[1:59:37] For the temple of God is holy, which
[1:59:39] temple you are.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll take my glasses off so I
[1:59:46] don't have to have very accurate vision
[1:59:47] out there.
[1:59:51] There's people and there might even be
[1:59:53] in this congregation might be listening
[1:59:55] to the sound of my voice and some some
[1:59:58] doctor who hasn't got any more interest
[1:59:59] than you're just a statistic in his
[2:00:01] books and gives you some uh some
[2:00:06] medication to because you're manic
[2:00:09] depressant.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm afraid to give you advice, but
[2:00:16] I don't think I'd take them.
[2:00:19] I had that herniated disc in my neck
[2:00:24] and uh Dr. Richard Cham,
[2:00:27] spinal specialist who's performed over
[2:00:30] 800 spinal operations,
[2:00:33] gave me some medication,
[2:00:37] uh
[2:00:38] which was to relieve me of the pain.
[2:00:42] Hey, and I was in pain. I lost 10 lbs in
[2:00:45] two weeks from pain. people people say,
[2:00:48] "Oh, I got such pain. I got such Well,
[2:00:51] we do. We do. And I I I I have so much
[2:00:54] sympathy for people that are in pain."
[2:00:56] But on the other hand, I don't think
[2:00:58] that we uh uh we we need to subject
[2:01:01] ourselves. And so, I had the morphine
[2:01:04] had to have a letter. So, going through
[2:01:06] the airport for this bottle of morphine
[2:01:09] pills and uh and my wife says, "Uh, I'm
[2:01:13] going to take you back there because
[2:01:15] we're going to go through the operation
[2:01:16] if you're not." I said, "Yeah, I'm going
[2:01:17] to go through the operation." Even
[2:01:18] though God has spoke to me, I stood
[2:01:20] right behind this pulpit and said, "God
[2:01:22] has spoke to me and said, I will be thou
[2:01:24] whole."
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; And you that were here remember that.
[2:01:28] And I said, "Furthermore, not improved,
[2:01:30] not better, but whole." Yes.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And went back to that same physician and
[2:01:36] said, "Do the operation." He refused.
[2:01:37] Three times he refused. And we got on
[2:01:40] the subject of the morphine. He said, "I
[2:01:42] took one to get through Brother Charlie
[2:01:45] Drake's funeral
[2:01:48] because without that, I had to have my
[2:01:49] arm above my head and I was immobile."
[2:01:54] And he says, "Well," he said, "you want
[2:01:56] to be careful. They're addictive."
[2:01:57] That's the last one I took.
[2:02:02] Why? That's my testimony. Do what you
[2:02:05] want. I'm giving my testimony. Soon as
[2:02:07] they said that's addictive,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I finish.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Biscell?
[2:02:12] I'm saying I sooner do with the pain
[2:02:13] than do with the pill.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm depressed and this kind of
[2:02:19] lifts me up. I'd sooner be depressed
[2:02:22] than have a false lift up.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] You won't be depressed forever. You'll
[2:02:31] come out of it.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; We all get depressed. We all have tough
[2:02:35] times. You'll come out of it.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I take drugs or I take drink or I do
[2:02:40] this or I do that to for to get a lift
[2:02:42] up or to get a downer or an upper,
[2:02:44] whatever more. Forget it.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:02:49] forget it. Say, "What shall I do? Get
[2:02:51] delivered this morning."
[2:02:54] [Applause]
[2:02:56] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:02:58] forever.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, have you got something for
[2:03:01] my depression? He will tell you I do.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get the Holy Ghost in your
[2:03:07] life. We got We got all the joy
[2:03:09] unspeakable and full of glory. Is this
[2:03:12] just rattling on?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Does this mean something to you?
[2:03:17] [Music]
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:20] [Applause]
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:27] Hallelujah.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; If any man defile, this is the word of
[2:03:33] God.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; If any man defile the temple of God, him
[2:03:36] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[2:03:39] is holy.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Which temple you are
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; sitting here?
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You're temples,
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Which temple you are?
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I didn't even tell you all this account.
[2:03:59] I took three of those morphine pills. I
[2:04:01] didn't even touch the pain.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; So, I went back to the doctor's office.
[2:04:06] He'd gone on vacation. They had a young
[2:04:07] fellow there with great big suspenders
[2:04:10] and looked like uh uh hiker's boots on.
[2:04:14] I looked at him. Doctor.
[2:04:17] Wow. That's different. He's one of these
[2:04:19] young ones.
[2:04:22] So I said I told him I said I got
[2:04:24] incredible pain. I said and the doctor
[2:04:26] gave me these because the morphine
[2:04:28] wasn't touching it. And and and the
[2:04:30] thing was you don't need to hear the
[2:04:33] story but I'll just tell you anyway.
[2:04:36] When I told the doctor I said the doctor
[2:04:38] before he went on vacation I says I says
[2:04:40] these morphine they're not even touching
[2:04:42] the pain. I said all it does cloud up my
[2:04:44] head no pain. Well he pulled open the
[2:04:47] drawer. He says well he says I I gave a
[2:04:48] prescription to an old fellow. He says,
[2:04:50] "And he died before he got a chance to
[2:04:52] take it, so I'll just give it to you."
[2:04:56] Thanks a lot.
[2:04:59] I looked at the tag, Mr. Anderson.
[2:05:01] There's any Mr. Anderson here, don't
[2:05:03] worry about it. And Mr. Anderson. So, I
[2:05:06] stuck it in my pocket and I thought, "My
[2:05:08] doctor's giving me medication for a guy.
[2:05:10] It's already buried. And I'm supposed to
[2:05:12] start taking his medication. I don't
[2:05:13] like this."
[2:05:17] So, so
[2:05:20] I said, "Well, he gave me this
[2:05:21] medication." This young doctor, he took
[2:05:23] it and he looked at it. He says,
[2:05:26] "You don't want to take this." I said,
[2:05:29] "What is it?" He said, "Do you want the,
[2:05:31] you know, professional name or do you
[2:05:33] want the street name?" I said, "Just
[2:05:34] give me the street name." He said, "It's
[2:05:36] heroin."
[2:05:39] He said, "You could take this and never
[2:05:40] come back." I said, "I don't think I
[2:05:44] want that." And he held it over the
[2:05:45] garbage can. He says, "With your
[2:05:47] permission." I said, "You have it." He
[2:05:48] just dropped it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; In seven weeks, I hooked into a channel
[2:05:57] that morphine knows nothing about, that
[2:06:00] heroin knows nothing about, and the
[2:06:02] doctor knew nothing about, and was
[2:06:04] completely healed. Hallelujah.
[2:06:10] And he's the same yesterday,
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; He's ready to do the same things.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; You have a responsibility
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; to your soul.
[2:06:38] He said, "It's truth. Your soul feeds on
[2:06:41] something." And whatever the
[2:06:43] characteristic of your soul is,
[2:06:46] that's what it'll show forth. I'm
[2:06:49] closing now in just a moment. But here's
[2:06:52] a big one. God is entrusted with you.
[2:06:56] Every person, I'm not preaching to one
[2:06:57] or two people. I'm preaching to this
[2:06:58] whole congregation.
[2:07:01] You young ladies, young fellows,
[2:07:04] God has actually given you an influence.
[2:07:09] You're going to influence somebody.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; You're going to influence them God word.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to influence them downward
[2:07:20] or you'll won't influence them at all.
[2:07:23] And God has given you an influence.
[2:07:27] Brother Brandham said someone you are
[2:07:29] influencing somebody
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; by your conversation, by what you say,
[2:07:35] by your manner, by your demeanor,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; by how you approach things. You're
[2:07:41] influencing people.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Better take this very serious, friends.
[2:07:50] God's going to hold us accountable. He's
[2:07:51] going to say, "I gave that to you,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and what did you do with it?
[2:07:58] Young people, I know maybe you're you're
[2:08:00] just going to camp, but let me tell you
[2:08:03] something. to just live a light,
[2:08:07] frivolous,
[2:08:09] nothing life to be just to, you know, to
[2:08:13] be able to talk about the stat hockey
[2:08:16] statistics or the NBA statistics or what
[2:08:20] this idol and that idol or some
[2:08:23] celebrity and what they're doing and
[2:08:24] what they're doing that is worse than
[2:08:27] that is less than empty. That's right.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; You can influence someone to be uh to
[2:08:38] have less interest or more interest in
[2:08:40] spiritual things. You can interest
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; parents
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; were under solemn. I I wish I could go
[2:08:47] back
[2:08:49] and have my family again.
[2:08:52] And I can tell you with what I know now,
[2:08:56] I would certainly
[2:08:59] have done things even differently in our
[2:09:00] home.
[2:09:02] We had a quiet home. We had a very
[2:09:05] peaceful home.
[2:09:07] That was fine. But I would have I would
[2:09:11] have had more of the word.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; I would have had more of the message.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; I just would have had more of it. I
[2:09:20] would have exposed him to more of it.
[2:09:23] You know what, friends?
[2:09:25] God's put something in my heart and I've
[2:09:27] just got to close, but God's put
[2:09:29] something in my heart. I realize that
[2:09:31] I'm here also to influence
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; and I want to influence your God word.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there's several hundred
[2:09:39] messages? We've talked about the hub and
[2:09:42] all the rest of it. Do you know there
[2:09:43] are several hundred messages and God has
[2:09:45] spoken to my heart and said, "I want you
[2:09:49] to digest those messages that have never
[2:09:53] been printed."
[2:09:55] And when I speak something to you and
[2:09:58] quicken it to you, I want you to bring
[2:10:00] that to the people
[2:10:02] so that it will inspire you and say,
[2:10:05] "I've got to have that message." Right.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; And you'll be going to the desk and
[2:10:10] saying, "Print that message out for me,
[2:10:12] Sister Debbie. I need that message. I
[2:10:15] need to hear that. I need to feed on
[2:10:17] that. That's more important than the
[2:10:20] next newspaper that comes to your door
[2:10:22] or whatever else or the next sales
[2:10:24] magazine or the next whatever, whatever.
[2:10:27] That's more important."
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; We are responsible for our influence.
[2:10:35] And I'm just going to read these quotes
[2:10:36] and then I'm going to I'm done because
[2:10:38] my time is up. In the message influence,
[2:10:45] he said that Uzziah had a very uh fine
[2:10:49] mother and a father. And this young king
[2:10:53] was crowned at a young age. And quickly
[2:10:57] he's taken the road that was right.
[2:11:00] Quickly he took the road that was right
[2:11:03] because of the influence of a godly
[2:11:06] father
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; and a godly mother.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me pe please.
[2:11:23] We endure things
[2:11:26] and families have hard times.
[2:11:30] Many times it's unnecessary.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; It's unnecessary.
[2:11:39] But what we allow
[2:11:41] and the the way that we've structured
[2:11:43] our families,
[2:11:45] Satan gets in and plays havoc with it.
[2:11:50] Now, I know you're quiet, but I'm going
[2:11:53] to say it anyway.
[2:11:55] I'm not saying that because a son or
[2:11:58] daughter or family or children have gone
[2:12:01] wayward. I'm not saying that that is all
[2:12:04] the responsibility. How well I remember
[2:12:07] an old brother and I I was right in his
[2:12:10] home
[2:12:11] and they had they were barren and God
[2:12:14] gave him one son, one child and they
[2:12:16] call his name Samuel
[2:12:19] and that Samuel became a heroin addict
[2:12:25] and he had long hair down to here and
[2:12:28] his eyes was sunk way back in his head
[2:12:32] and mom and dad wouldn't see him for
[2:12:34] three and four months and he'd come home
[2:12:38] in the middle of the night and they'd
[2:12:39] find him in the basement in his room and
[2:12:42] he'd come up. His father said to me in
[2:12:45] personal conversation,
[2:12:47] he said, I would just say to him,
[2:12:49] Samuel, Samuel,
[2:12:52] what are you doing to yourself?
[2:12:56] You can't do anything.
[2:12:58] You cannot do anything because we gave
[2:13:02] you to God and you are going to be a
[2:13:05] preacher.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; God delivered Samuel Po was his name.
[2:13:12] Delivered him instantly
[2:13:16] from a life of heroin and he spent some
[2:13:19] years in heroin and God cold turkey
[2:13:22] delivered him completely.
[2:13:25] So I wouldn't say that the father had
[2:13:27] done something wrong. He did something
[2:13:29] right.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; He believed for him.
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Young people, families, husbands, wives
[2:13:40] may go a certain direction, but let me
[2:13:42] let it be said, we have the wherewithal.
[2:13:46] We have the material.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; God help me to drive this home. I
[2:13:52] believe that fathers and mothers after
[2:13:54] hearing this service, we we are under a
[2:13:57] responsibility
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; to express and influence our families
[2:14:02] and influence our children and influence
[2:14:04] other families in the church and live
[2:14:07] down straight on the line.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; He said he quickly took it. He says, and
[2:14:15] I think that that's a fine example for
[2:14:17] we parent today is to set an example
[2:14:20] before our children. Now, he says,
[2:14:22] you'll live the best and your worst at
[2:14:26] home.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; God help us. He says the children are
[2:14:32] watching. Not only are they watching,
[2:14:34] but the neighbors are watching. Not only
[2:14:36] are the neighbors are watching, all that
[2:14:38] you are associated with watch you. The
[2:14:42] people at your church watch you. the
[2:14:44] people that you do business with in the
[2:14:46] markets, they're watching you after your
[2:14:49] after your confession. And we should
[2:14:51] always try to reflect Christ in
[2:14:54] everything that we do.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; I trust you're able to take these
[2:15:04] things.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; God has allotted to you your health.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; God has allotted to you your time. God
[2:15:11] has allotted to you your influence. God
[2:15:14] has even gave you an allotment called
[2:15:16] your soul.
[2:15:18] And you're the one responsible what
[2:15:20] you're going to feed on.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; God has allotted all of this to you.
[2:15:27] And that's what we will give answer for.
[2:15:30] That's what the scripture means when
[2:15:31] every man,
[2:15:33] every man, Paul said, every man, every
[2:15:36] person will give an account of the
[2:15:39] things done in his flesh. Every person
[2:15:42] will give an account. Our sins, as
[2:15:46] brother Brandham said in the foundation
[2:15:48] of the scripture, they are forgiven,
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; never to be remembered again. This what
[2:15:54] I'm speaking about has nothing to do
[2:15:55] with salvation. has to do with your
[2:15:58] life, your rewards, and your conduct
[2:16:02] and what God has entrusted to us.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hey folks,
[2:16:08] this has been so heavy on my heart. I
[2:16:11] hope I'm able to convey it to you in
[2:16:14] such a way. It is this word that God has
[2:16:17] given to us that we are so responsible
[2:16:20] for.
[2:16:23] He gave them all his goods.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; And I want I I I'm praying I'm praying
[2:16:30] that that you won't be able to move away
[2:16:33] from this that it will Excuse me for
[2:16:36] putting it this way, but I I'm asking
[2:16:37] that it'll haunt you. Praise the Lord.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; That this message will actually haunt
[2:16:42] you and stay on your mind. That it'll be
[2:16:45] there when you're at the dinner table.
[2:16:47] You'll think about what was said.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; All I'm doing is echoing what he said.
[2:16:51] You'll think about your influence.
[2:16:53] You'll think about your association.
[2:16:55] When you go to transact some business,
[2:16:56] you'll be thinking about this. When
[2:16:59] things go sideways, when you get under
[2:17:01] pressure, when you get under tension,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; God knows all about it.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet said we have pressure.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:17:13] [Applause]
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] There was such an important part.
[2:17:23] We're going to have the Lord's supper
[2:17:26] and I think we I've set that for March
[2:17:30] the 1st. I already gave the time March
[2:17:33] the 1st for communion.
[2:17:37] And I was so moved in connection with
[2:17:39] the message today.
[2:17:43] Brother Brandham said that Jesus was our
[2:17:46] example
[2:17:49] and you know in a church like this we
[2:17:51] have relationships with people
[2:17:55] and we have people that perhaps we have
[2:17:57] favor
[2:17:59] uh you know we we just get along so nice
[2:18:02] with them. But I thought of Jesus just
[2:18:05] give me about two minutes.
[2:18:08] I thought of Jesus and where he did use
[2:18:11] one time he used this example. He said,
[2:18:14] "I have given you an example."
[2:18:17] And this what this is this is a very
[2:18:19] deliberate move on his part. The Bible
[2:18:22] says the supper was over.
[2:18:25] He riseth from the supper.
[2:18:30] He girded himself with a towel. I mean,
[2:18:33] all of these are steps, very special
[2:18:36] steps. He's leaving an example and he
[2:18:40] girded himself with a towel.
[2:18:43] He didn't go and say, "Deacons, do you
[2:18:45] have some water in a basin?" Which is
[2:18:47] fine. We do it now to expedite it. But
[2:18:50] I'm talking about the way he did it.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; He went and got a basin.
[2:18:57] He put water in it.
[2:19:00] He came to the disciples
[2:19:03] and he began to wash their feet
[2:19:06] and wipe them with a towel. I mean, you
[2:19:09] talk about, you should read it. And
[2:19:11] there's seven deliberate steps that he
[2:19:14] took to be an example to us.
[2:19:19] And then he said, I've given you an
[2:19:22] example.
[2:19:25] You should do as I have done.
[2:19:31] How incredible
[2:19:34] of an example of humility.
[2:19:38] He wasn't just saying, you know, oh,
[2:19:39] just because we're having communion, we
[2:19:41] just wash each other's feet, you know,
[2:19:42] and and and say a little prayer over one
[2:19:45] another. Somehow it was deeper. You know
[2:19:47] what, friends?
[2:19:52] I look at that life
[2:19:55] and I desire
[2:19:58] to have that to be able to
[2:20:04] reflect that example.
[2:20:09] And not just the motions, not just the
[2:20:12] not just the towel, not just you know
[2:20:14] going, not just the water, not the
[2:20:16] basin, not just that. What was in him?
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; What was in his heart
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; when he did that?
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire. It's not the
[2:20:26] basin, not the water, not the towel,
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; but what was in his heart.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; reflecting in Jesus Christ.
[2:20:37] Let that be our example
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; when we have our communion service.
[2:20:46] May the Holy Spirit
[2:20:49] come and make this a reality to you.
[2:20:52] Would you like to stand with me,
[2:21:05] our precious Lord Jesus. Jesus,
[2:21:10] how sweet and lovely that name is.
[2:21:14] Lord Jesus, I I am
[2:21:18] I feel a sense of humility
[2:21:22] because I'm looking on the faces of
[2:21:23] these people of people that you saw
[2:21:27] before the foundation of the world,
[2:21:28] before there was a sun to shine, before
[2:21:30] there were stars in the sky.
[2:21:33] And in your great mind and thought, you
[2:21:37] had individuals that were going to come
[2:21:39] and reflect you at a certain time, at a
[2:21:41] certain season. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; And you have delivered to us your goods.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; And this day before this congregation of
[2:21:50] people, I say, what lovely, how
[2:21:54] wonderful are these goods.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; How blessed we are. Oh Lord, help us to
[2:22:00] be faithful.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Help us to be good stewards of these
[2:22:04] goods.
[2:22:07] Lord, and
[2:22:09] so personal today, but I thought of
[2:22:11] those that
[2:22:13] made tapes. I thought of Brother Lance.
[2:22:16] I thought of the sisters that worked in
[2:22:18] the office. I thought of the letters
[2:22:21] that were written, the envelopes that
[2:22:23] were licked,
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; the work that was done so that somebody
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; could have some bread,
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; so that somebody could have a drink. And
[2:22:36] here we are today, Lord, and I'm praying
[2:22:38] for your blessing upon the people that
[2:22:41] are scattered around the world and those
[2:22:42] that are carrying your word. And here we
[2:22:45] have, Lord, Brother Tory and Sister
[2:22:47] Rebecca. Oh God, they're totally
[2:22:50] dependent upon you. This has to be
[2:22:53] something that you will orchestrate and
[2:22:56] you will do and that you will speak to
[2:23:00] someone's heart. Oh God, you will open
[2:23:02] doors in the name of Jesus Christ. The
[2:23:05] light is greater than the darkness.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Let the darkness, oh God, be banished, I
[2:23:11] pray. Lord,
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; and let the true light shine and give
[2:23:15] words, oh God,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; for brother Tony to speak, Father, and
[2:23:20] may they put forth the goods that you've
[2:23:22] delivered to us.
[2:23:25] Oh, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; every person that is here, Lord, the
[2:23:31] young people are going to set themselves
[2:23:34] aside at the camp. And Lord, Brother
[2:23:36] Donnie Danny Stevens that's coming. I
[2:23:38] pray that you will give him words that
[2:23:40] he never ever thought to speak. And may
[2:23:43] there be a supernatural time. And here
[2:23:46] today, Lord, I came to the pulpit, came
[2:23:49] to this service very much moved, very
[2:23:51] much affected by the by the very
[2:23:54] atmosphere, Lord, hearing your prophet
[2:23:57] declaring, and I will declare it. It is
[2:24:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[2:24:03] today and today and today. You're the
[2:24:06] same today. We need you today, Lord. Not
[2:24:10] tomorrow, not yesterday. today. Oh God,
[2:24:13] there's people that are standing here
[2:24:15] that need you at this moment. I pray
[2:24:17] that you'll sweep through this body of
[2:24:20] people in the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:24:23] and let faith be inspired through the
[2:24:26] hearing of the word.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, we look forward to seeing things
[2:24:32] done and accomplished for your name and
[2:24:34] for your glory.
[2:24:37] And we're here to praise you. Thank you
[2:24:39] Lord for the attention that the people
[2:24:41] have given
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; being patient with me. I pray father
[2:24:46] your blessing upon everyone.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Lord we have children.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; We have sons and daughters
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; that are astray.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; We have husbands perhaps and wives.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; that are astray.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God of love
[2:25:09] and God of mercy and God of
[2:25:10] longsuffering, go to them wherever they
[2:25:13] are. Go to them now in this
[2:25:15] congregation. Praise and we lift up our
[2:25:18] voice to you. Go to them now. Seek them
[2:25:21] out. Seek them out. Bring them Lord.

[2:25:29] the bonds and break the feathers in the
[2:25:32] name of Jesus Christ. And so shall it be
[2:25:35] according to our faith and belief.

[2:31:49] wonder brother Tony if you would come
[2:31:51] and just dismiss us in a word of prayer
[2:31:54] would you please?
[2:31:56] [Music]
[2:32:00] Heavenly Father, as we
[2:32:03] would be leaving from this place, we
[2:32:05] will not be leaving without your
[2:32:07] presence, Lord. For Father, this is the
[2:32:10] reason why you have come and shown
[2:32:13] yourself to us is that you would
[2:32:15] tabernacle and a bride and a people that
[2:32:19] is not ashamed of this word, not ashamed
[2:32:21] of this gospel. And Father, as we would
[2:32:24] leave from here, may the word dwell
[2:32:26] richly in each and everyone. For Father,
[2:32:30] you desire to bless us, to show your
[2:32:32] power, Lord, to minister to us when we
[2:32:35] are in need. And Lord, may we be
[2:32:37] conscious of the presence that's within
[2:32:39] us that when we see someone in need,
[2:32:42] Lord, need of an encouraging word, need
[2:32:44] of of of some Lord, experience to lift
[2:32:48] their spirits, to provide for them
[2:32:50] financially, to help them whatever the
[2:32:52] body may be, Lord, lacking in. When one
[2:32:54] member suffers, we all suffer, Father.
[2:32:57] And Lord, here we are as we have
[2:32:59] benefited by your revealing this
[2:33:01] morning, by your your personal presence
[2:33:03] through the word that was ministered.
[2:33:05] how we thank you for the word and now
[2:33:06] may we be those that would put it into
[2:33:09] action. Lift through us. Let us not just
[2:33:12] be hearers only, but let us be
[2:33:14] demonstrators of the word of God is our
[2:33:16] prayer and desire. And so, Father, bless
[2:33:19] your people. Bless brother Red as we
[2:33:21] thank you for a man that is not ashamed
[2:33:24] and willing to declare the word all that
[2:33:27] we have need of. Lord, bless him.
[2:33:30] Strengthen him. We pray now and be with
[2:33:32] each and every one of us as we go our
[2:33:33] ways. In Jesus name we pray and thank
[2:33:36] you. Amen.

[2:33:51] anxious to hear what God has put on his
[2:33:53] heart. So those of you that
[2:33:56] are need to leave now, you're dismissed
