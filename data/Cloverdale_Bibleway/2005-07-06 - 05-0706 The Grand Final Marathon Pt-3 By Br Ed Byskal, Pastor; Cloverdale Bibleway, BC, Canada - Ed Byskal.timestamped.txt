[11:05] couple of prayer requests. We want to

[11:12] along with severe coughing all week. So,
[11:15] we just want to lift our brother Edwin
[11:17] up in prayer.
[11:20] We also want to uh pray that the Lord
[11:23] will help brother Jeff Sachar find a
[11:26] good stable full-time job so he'll be
[11:28] able to support his family. And we also
[11:31] want to remember sister Christine, the
[11:34] wife of brother Gary Watson who's uh the
[11:38] manager of Mainland Broadcasting. She
[11:40] was uh diagnosed with having breast
[11:42] cancer and is scheduled to go to Christ
[11:45] Church for tests and and surgery should
[11:49] uh this be found necessary. So, we want
[11:51] to lift the sister up in prayer. If you
[11:53] have a need on your heart, if you're on
[11:55] the telephone hookup
[11:57] on the internet watching the service,
[12:01] just raise your hand as we go to prayer.
[12:03] Brother Jim, if you'd come.
[12:05] [Music]
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray together.
[12:12] Father, it's a privilege to be here
[12:13] tonight, Lord. It just feels so
[12:16] wonderful, Lord, to come into the house
[12:18] of God, Lord, to especially if you've
[12:21] been away for a while. It's just a
[12:22] refreshing, Lord, a washing, Lord, and
[12:25] just sensing your presence, Father, and
[12:28] enjoying it. We're thankful for it,
[12:30] Father God, that you are pleased to
[12:33] inhabit the praise of your people, Lord.
[12:36] Father, we've come to hear your word,
[12:39] Lord, to
[12:41] come to a higher place than what we are
[12:44] even now. Lord, we see your promise,
[12:46] Lord Jesus, of a totally manifested and
[12:50] surrendered life, oh God. It's our
[12:52] heart's desire. And we know that the
[12:54] word continues to unfold in our hearts,
[12:56] Lord, and becoming a greater reality in
[12:59] each of us, Lord. And we come with
[13:01] expectation tonight, Father, asking that
[13:03] you would take your servant, Lord,
[13:05] whoever would speak here tonight, Lord,
[13:07] and enable him to yield himself to you,
[13:10] Lord, and come, Lord God. Let him be
[13:13] just a a a vessel for your spoken word
[13:16] tonight, Lord. Speak to our hearts, oh
[13:19] God. Father, we want to bring these
[13:22] requests before you. Our brother Edwin,
[13:24] our precious brother Edwin. Lord, he
[13:26] means so much to so many of us, Father
[13:29] God, by his life and his kindness, Lord.
[13:32] And Lord, I pray you'd go to where he's
[13:35] at right now, Lord, that you'd take away
[13:38] this cough and whatever ailment and this
[13:40] affliction, oh God.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you in the name of Jesus
[13:44] Christ to go to our brother right now,
[13:46] Lord. Touch him, oh God, and raise him
[13:49] up, Lord. be glorified, oh God, as you
[13:53] have been in Sister Sally's life, a
[13:55] walking miracle, Lord. God, this man is
[13:58] life is totally surrendered to you and
[13:59] he's been a total blessing to us, oh
[14:01] God. I pray you go to him, Father,
[14:04] comfort him, Lord, and heal him even
[14:08] now, Lord Jesus, we ask. Father, for
[14:11] this uh brother Jeff looking for a job,
[14:14] oh Lord. God, it's a desire that's not
[14:17] always found in everyone today, Lord.
[14:19] But these godly men have the desire to
[14:21] go out and work on and provide for their
[14:23] families. I know if we just commit it to
[14:25] you, Lord, you'll make a way for them,
[14:27] Lord. Lord, help him tonight, Father. we
[14:30] pray just may you just enable him to
[14:33] commit it to you Lord and have peace
[14:35] about it oh God that you fulfill that
[14:37] need because you commanded it Lord that
[14:40] we do that and so you'll provide Lord
[14:43] thank you for that and the sister Lord
[14:44] that
[14:46] has been

[14:49] that uh has been diagnosed with this
[14:52] form of cancer Lord and it's going to
[14:56] this place for test and surgery oh God
[14:58] we've seen your hand before Lord Lord,
[15:00] we Lord just ask that you would go and
[15:03] give her a peace, oh God. That you'd
[15:05] give her a revelation, Father, of her
[15:07] healing, Lord, that she could just have
[15:09] peace, Lord, and surrender it to you, oh
[15:12] God, knowing that you've provided for
[15:14] her, Lord. Oh, go with her, Lord. Give
[15:17] her that revelation, oh God, of faith,
[15:19] Lord, that she can just go and know and
[15:21] claim it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[15:23] Father, Lord, we commit the rest of this
[15:26] service to you, Lord. just help us to
[15:27] enter into a worship that's pleasing to
[15:29] you, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus'
[15:32] name. Amen.
[15:36] Amen. You may have your seats.
[15:46] Amen. I want to welcome everyone
[15:48] tonight. If you're visiting with us, we

[15:52] see Brother Mark, Sister Tina, Stanley
[15:53] with us. God bless you. Good to have
[15:55] you. We're going to turn directly to the
[15:57] word as brother Ed's going to come. Why
[15:59] don't we sing number 2057?
[16:02] Uh, have thine own way, Lord. Have thine
[16:04] own way.

[16:43] me

[18:17] Oh power,
[18:23] surely is thine.
[18:29] Oh, touch me and heal
[18:33] me.
[18:36] Savior
[18:37] divine.
[18:38] [Music]
[18:41] Oh, have thine own way,
[18:46] Lord.
[18:48] Have thine own way
[18:54] over my
[18:56] [Music]
[19:00] absolute
[19:02] sway.
[19:05] Oh, filled with thy spirit
[19:12] till all shall see
[19:18] Christ
[19:20] all
[19:24] living.
[19:26] Let's sing the first verse again.
[19:29] Oh, have I
[19:34] lo
[19:37] I
[19:42] thou art the father
[19:48] I am the clay.
[19:54] Hold me and make
[19:58] me
[20:01] after I wait.
[20:06] While I am waiting,
[20:13] he stand.
[20:15] [Music]
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Here we are able to gather today. I
[20:22] appreciated the prayer, brother Jim. You
[20:25] know, sometimes you have to be away a
[20:27] little while and then you appreciate
[20:29] coming just coming into the
[20:32] even into the sanctuary
[20:35] is a blessing, isn't it? There's just a
[20:38] a I don't know quietness. There's just a
[20:41] peace. There's a serenity.
[20:43] Like brother Brandham said, he liked to
[20:46] when he held a meeting, he far sooner
[20:48] preached in a church than be, you know,
[20:52] some auditorium or some place where they
[20:54] had wrestling the night before or who
[20:55] knows what they had the night before.
[20:57] Said it seemed to him that spirits kind
[20:59] of hung around. Well, I just believe the
[21:02] Holy Spirit
[21:03] &gt;&gt; just stays around. God's people were
[21:06] there. They know that the next time they
[21:08] gather here, they're going to worship,
[21:10] going to praise him. Amen. We're here
[21:12] for one reason.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; That's to exalt his name.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:19] Uh I'm going to make an announcement
[21:21] that I want to sing as the heart panth
[21:24] for the waterbrooks. The only reason I
[21:26] say that now is I might forget it by the
[21:28] time I get to the announcement.
[21:31] You you have to have stop gap measures,
[21:33] you know, as time goes on.
[21:37] uh for the school
[21:40] for the Bible way Christian Academy,
[21:45] they need and are looking for a
[21:49] volunteer
[21:50] uh driver from the US side because it's
[21:55] a US licensed bus.
[21:58] They would need a driver to transport
[22:00] the US children to and from the school
[22:04] on a regular basis from starting from
[22:07] September.
[22:09] And we already have the bus.
[22:12] We just need a driver. And please
[22:15] contact Brother Derek Paris if you are
[22:18] able to help. Amen. Uh the bus has been
[22:22] donated
[22:24] a 60 passenger bus and uh our brother
[22:30] Billy Joe Fer he may maybe wouldn't want
[22:34] me to say it but I'm saying it anyway
[22:37] then he can deal with me.
[22:40] But he donated the bus and uh he works
[22:43] for the school uh
[22:47] department or the school board. I don't
[22:48] know what they call it exactly, but he
[22:51] had uh had opportunity and we went down
[22:54] and I had looked over three buses with
[22:57] him and and he said, "I'm going to buy
[22:59] one for the school. I want to buy one
[23:01] for the church. It'll be also be a
[23:04] wonderful opportunity when perhaps some
[23:07] special meetings take place down in
[23:08] Seattle. We'll be can take more down
[23:11] than just in the van, you know." So,
[23:13] that's really nice and we're really
[23:15] thankful. The second announcement that
[23:18] the school needs to make is that there's
[23:21] going to be a short work be
[23:24] on Saturday. That's this Saturday the
[23:26] 10th.
[23:27] And could parents, brothers of the
[23:31] school children, and any other
[23:33] volunteers, so that opens up to
[23:35] everybody, please make themselves
[23:37] available for this short workbe on
[23:40] Saturday morning at 9:00 a.m. to 12:00
[23:43] a.m. So, it's just 3 hours. And please
[23:46] contact Brother Leon Davea if you have
[23:50] any question. Shouldn't be much
[23:52] question. can just come with your
[23:54] sleeves rolled up, I guess, is the only
[23:56] thing.
[23:58] And also, uh, I want to make an
[24:01] announcement. I off often have you young
[24:05] people, young men, young ladies that
[24:07] don't have a whole lot of, uh,
[24:09] obligations perhaps. I know your
[24:11] schedule's busy, but maybe you can
[24:12] adjust it easier than others. We we need
[24:16] uh the the house that's immediately next
[24:19] where the minister suite is downstairs.
[24:21] Brother uh brother Paul and sister Lena
[24:26] live downstairs that used to be the old
[24:28] minister suite and brother Alex has
[24:31] moved to the next house next door. And
[24:34] we've had the upstairs completely
[24:36] renovated. And we need we need some
[24:39] young people. There can be some sisters.
[24:41] And we'd like uh we'd like to have a
[24:43] sister and a brother. Uh maybe one
[24:46] brother can take charge of the outside
[24:49] and he could just do it as a you know be
[24:51] a nice outing.
[24:55] Thank you. That was very delayed. But it
[24:57] did come through. Be very nice outing.
[25:00] Fresh air and all the rest. Sisters can
[25:02] be inside and that won't take long
[25:04] either. It's it's essentially it's
[25:07] essentially there. just a few things
[25:08] that need to be done and and made ready
[25:11] for we uh want to make it available and
[25:14] it will be rented to believers,
[25:16] believers only. And if you know someone
[25:19] that will be needing, it would be ideal
[25:21] for, you know, maybe
[25:25] not over a family of not over four, it
[25:28] would be ideal for a couple of sisters
[25:30] actually. And it's two bedrooms and and
[25:32] so on. So, uh, it it is available and,
[25:37] uh, it'll be available probably about
[25:38] the 15th of this month. So, if you knew
[25:41] that someone was in need, we don't want
[25:44] it to be on a short-term thing because
[25:46] as soon as someone is out, then of
[25:47] course you have to fix it up again. And
[25:50] so, this is in the uh this is under the
[25:53] trustees and and so if you have someone,
[25:56] you could perhaps contact brother DJ and
[25:59] let him know or brother Tom. Uh, but I
[26:02] wonder if we have a a a sister who could
[26:04] just take charge of the inside and get a
[26:07] few other sisters with her. Uh, so we
[26:10] know we have somebody or and brother for
[26:13] the outside. All right, Sister Margaret,
[26:15] you're going to take charge and you'll
[26:16] take charge. Okay, get, you know, get a
[26:19] half a dozen or three or four with you.
[26:21] And uh, I would say if you have three,
[26:23] four sisters, Sister Margaret. So any
[26:26] other sister, you can see Sister
[26:28] Margaret or say our brother here,
[26:30] brother Right.
[26:36] When he stands up, you can't miss him.
[26:38] That's great. So, that's all looked
[26:40] after. Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Glad to be in the house of God tonight,
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark. Nice to see you and your
[26:47] family. My goodness. Back home again
[26:51] for a little while. All right. Why don't
[26:54] we stand and sing? What was it? As the
[26:58] heart pan. That's right.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:02] As the mark guide
[27:07] the water from my soul
[27:11] is after thee.
[27:16] You alone
[27:19] are my heart. Desire and I long to
[27:25] worship
[27:26] thee.
[27:29] You alone are my strength and shield.
[27:36] You alone does my spirit heal.
[27:42] [Music]
[27:44] You alone
[27:47] are my heart desire and my long toship.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; I want to sing that first verse in that
[27:57] chorus again. And I'd like everyone just
[28:00] to set your mind on the Lord.
[28:03] And I wonder while you're singing if you
[28:05] might ask yourself, how much do I love
[28:07] him?
[28:09] How much do I desire him? And that'll
[28:13] help you think about what it is you're
[28:15] saying and you're singing. You know,
[28:18] sometimes it's hard. you know, you've
[28:19] come from a day's work and it's not it's
[28:23] not just uh that simple just to give
[28:27] yourself over. But when you don't have
[28:29] to ask yourself very many questions, how
[28:32] much do I love him? How much does he
[28:34] love you? What does he really desire? I
[28:38] believe he desires our full attention
[28:40] tonight. Our all of our love and all
[28:43] that we can be.
[28:47] I heard of one man one day he was in
[28:49] prayer and the Lord spoke to him and
[28:52] said he was in his morning prayer and
[28:55] the Lord spoke to him and said I want
[28:56] you to go and meet everyone you can
[28:59] today and tell them that I love them.
[29:05] And that man had an incredible day. He
[29:09] said people just broke down in weeping
[29:13] and tears when he told him because the
[29:15] presence of God was with him. But you
[29:17] know that holds true for every one of
[29:19] us. Holds true. And we can't we can't
[29:23] even begin to determine the depth of
[29:27] that. And the reason I'm trying to bring
[29:30] this to you is I want to set I want to
[29:33] set the service in a direction for the
[29:37] word. And sometimes you come to a
[29:40] subject that's just not that easy to
[29:42] deliver to the people. And we have one
[29:45] of those tonight. You need to be
[29:47] spiritual. You need to have the mind of
[29:49] God and say, "God, whatever it is you
[29:51] have laid on my brother's heart tonight,
[29:54] deliver it to my soul." And I want to
[29:57] tell you that I desire you with
[29:59] everything that's in me. All right?
[30:03] As the deer pandeth for
[30:08] the water so my soul long after
[30:14] thee.
[30:18] You alone
[30:20] are my heart's
[30:23] desire and I long to worship
[30:28] thee.
[30:32] You alone are my strength, my shield.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; You alone are my spirit.
[30:47] You alone
[30:50] are my heart's
[30:52] desire and I long
[30:56] to worship.
[30:58] [Music]
[30:59] with our heads bowed. Father, we're
[31:02] coming reverently.
[31:05] You made yourself known through Jesus
[31:07] Christ.
[31:09] And what we saw in him was grace, mercy,
[31:13] and love. And Lord, tonight we are
[31:17] recipients of these graces.
[31:20] Lord, had you not loved us, you would
[31:22] never have searched us out, but you
[31:24] found us and you came by in such a way
[31:27] and just appealed to us. You brooded
[31:31] over us. You wooed us
[31:34] &gt;&gt; and brought us and caused us. Oh God,
[31:37] some of us had very hard hearts. Some of
[31:40] us were so steeped in darkness. We were
[31:43] so bound it looked like it was
[31:45] impossible. Many of us, and sure, I'm
[31:48] sure all of us tried to make amends. We
[31:50] tried to turn over new leaves. We tried
[31:53] to make resolutions, but they didn't
[31:55] work. We failed. And oh God, one day we
[31:59] came helpless. And we said, "Oh Lord,
[32:02] have mercy upon me. And you came to our
[32:06] aid. You came to us. And oh Lord,
[32:09] tonight we're so thankful." And we want
[32:11] to say, "Blessed be your name.
[32:14] You're so you've been so gracious to us.
[32:18] And I pray that you'll grip every heart,
[32:20] Lord. And may we be overflowing with
[32:23] thanksgiving and worship to you in
[32:25] adoration.
[32:27] Pray, oh God, you'll bless now your
[32:29] word. You know the things you've laid on
[32:31] my heart. May they be delivered to your
[32:34] people as you delivered it to me. I pray
[32:37] you'll anoint me, oh God, and anoint the
[32:40] people and anoint all who are streaming
[32:42] tonight. Lord, we we say God blessings
[32:44] upon them. The name of Jesus Christ, we
[32:48] commit all things to you now. Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing,
[32:55] I'm going to read just a couple of
[32:56] verses which we have for text on Sunday.
[33:00] John the 14th chapter verses 2 and
[33:03] three. And then if you'll keep your
[33:06] Bibles open because I have quite a
[33:08] number of scriptures and it it will be
[33:10] in the book of Deuteronomy.
[33:13] uh when you are seated we will be going
[33:15] through quite a number of those
[33:16] scriptures
[33:19] in John's gospel
[33:22] in my father's house are many mansions
[33:26] and if it were not so I would have told
[33:28] you I go to prepare a place for you and
[33:33] if I go and prepare a place for you I
[33:36] will come again and receive you unto
[33:40] myself that where I am there you may be
[33:46] also.
[33:48] Amen. God bless this word and God bless
[33:50] you as you have your seats.
[33:57] In this scripture
[33:59] Jesus has said I will come again and
[34:03] receive you to myself.
[34:08] This
[34:10] receiving
[34:12] of you is to not just to accept you.
[34:17] That's not it. To receive you is to take
[34:20] you to himself, to join you to himself
[34:26] as a companion
[34:28] and to take you by the hand. In fact,
[34:31] the Greek says to take you in order to
[34:34] carry you away. That's the intent. in
[34:37] order to snatch you and take you away.
[34:40] Isn't that wonderful?
[34:42] &gt;&gt; To take what is one's own by it taking
[34:46] you by receiving you. He is saying you
[34:48] belong to me. You don't belong to
[34:51] anything else. You don't belong to this
[34:54] environment or this society or this
[34:56] civilization or this nation or this city
[34:59] or this church. You belong to me. Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Uh, you're mine and I'm taking you and
[35:06] to take what belongs to one and to make
[35:09] it his own. To lay claim to it, to
[35:13] literally seize it.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love that. To to be an
[35:18] associate, as one, as a companion. He's
[35:22] receiving us as a companion
[35:25] and of that which is taken with the
[35:28] intent to never let it go.
[35:31] Hallelujah. Isn't that marvelous? You
[35:33] know, I could preach on that. I I could
[35:35] just preach on that to receive you unto
[35:37] myself, to seize you, to take a hold
[35:40] with the intent of of letting you know
[35:43] you're mine. You're not your own
[35:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to let you go.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to take you away
[35:50] &gt;&gt; to my place.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as my associate, as my
[35:57] companion,
[36:00] &gt;&gt; and to lay hold to let you know that
[36:03] you've been selected
[36:05] &gt;&gt; and chosen.
[36:07] Hallelujah.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; It's a great relationship.
[36:12] We've been speaking on the rapture
[36:14] and how that the rapture is not so much
[36:18] uh a location
[36:21] as it is a change of status,
[36:25] &gt;&gt; a change of position. Brother Jim may
[36:28] not remember, but he he said so much in
[36:32] his prayer the position that God has
[36:36] brought us into. And uh
[36:40] we took from the prophet's message on
[36:43] rapture. I'm just rehearsing this to
[36:45] you. I'm not going to spend any time on
[36:46] it.
[36:48] Where Psalms 27 where he's talking about
[36:51] the rapture and the order of this great
[36:53] rapture. In Psalms 27 speaks of I will
[36:58] dwell in the house of the Lord.
[37:01] Speaks of inquire in his temple.
[37:05] These are all aspects
[37:08] of this rapture
[37:10] that that is taking place. And in his
[37:13] pavilion,
[37:15] he'll hide me in the secret of his
[37:17] tabernacle.
[37:19] Now, I want to take a scripture. It's a
[37:22] strange scripture,
[37:24] but I will be reading in Deuteronomy, if
[37:27] you will turn with me to the 12th
[37:30] chapter.
[37:33] Brother Brandham preaches a message
[37:36] and God's only place of worship.
[37:41] God's only place of worship.
[37:45] And in preaching that I like you to
[37:48] recall that
[37:51] uh the children of Israel were
[37:54] constantly moving.
[37:57] So the place was not so much a
[38:00] geographical location.
[38:03] But it was a condition.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; It was a it was a position. It was
[38:08] something that people entered into.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And it is exactly the same today. We say
[38:14] you know that these places are house
[38:16] this is a house of worship which is true
[38:18] only in part. But I mean this structure
[38:21] means absolutely nothing to God. But it
[38:24] is who comes in and the attitude they
[38:27] come in with and what they receive while
[38:30] they're here and with the response of
[38:32] what the response uh that they have as a
[38:36] result of what they hear. That means
[38:38] everything to God.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That means everything
[38:42] to him. That's what the house of worship
[38:45] is all about. And so as it is with the
[38:48] place of worship, the place you'll hold
[38:51] that in your mind. This is the place.
[38:54] The place is not so much a geographical
[38:57] location as the rapture is a place, not
[39:00] a geographical location, but it's a
[39:03] condition that one comes into. It's a
[39:06] position that one receives. It's a
[39:08] status. It's a it it's a it's a level of
[39:12] and I want to take today. It's a level
[39:14] of a relationship
[39:17] &gt;&gt; that we didn't have before,
[39:20] &gt;&gt; an intimacy.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And I the what makes it a little bit
[39:24] difficult
[39:26] and uh you know occasionally brother
[39:28] Brandham said, "Well, I he approach the
[39:30] subject and say, I trust that we're you
[39:32] know, mostly adults here. I trust that
[39:34] we're all adults and I trust that you
[39:36] will be mature and those that are
[39:38] streaming will also be. they wouldn't be
[39:40] streaming if they if they weren't really
[39:44] uh deeply interested and committed.
[39:47] But let me say this. Satan has
[39:50] perpetrated
[39:52] upon this generation especially and upon
[39:56] society as we know it. I would say a
[40:00] massive fraud in taking the most
[40:03] precious and the most intimate things
[40:07] and degrading them down until they can
[40:09] scarcely be talked about. Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; And that is a fraud upon our upon the
[40:16] believer especially. And it's a triple
[40:18] fraud when he dragged the precious
[40:21] things down. That's fraud number one.
[40:23] And makes it so that the people in the
[40:25] world can't even see it straight. What's
[40:28] love? You think the world knows what
[40:30] love is? has no concept of what love is
[40:34] &gt;&gt; about the marriage, about the family,
[40:38] about the union that God has ordained.
[40:41] These things are so intimate. They are
[40:43] so precious. In fact, is Satan has
[40:46] perpetrated such a fraud even upon
[40:48] believers. I said to brother Tom just
[40:50] before I came out, there are scriptures
[40:52] in this word of God that I refrain from
[40:57] reading
[41:00] because people
[41:03] our minds are actually tainted
[41:06] &gt;&gt; if not contaminated by the world. And
[41:10] what is what the messages that are sent
[41:12] to you through the books and the
[41:13] magazines and the advertisements and and
[41:16] the billboards along the side of the
[41:17] road and everything that you grew up
[41:19] with and everything that you hear and
[41:21] everything that you've heard in school
[41:22] and all the rest of it and the things
[41:23] that that the that Satan wants to make
[41:26] you think that now you know something
[41:27] about it. And quite frankly, we don't
[41:29] know very much about it.
[41:32] And that's why so often we find
[41:35] ourselves into a pit.
[41:39] So from having said that we will read a
[41:42] scripture
[41:45] in uh Deuteronomy 12.
[41:49] These are the statutes and the judgments
[41:53] which you shall observe to do in the
[41:55] land which the Lord God of thy fathers
[41:59] giveth thee to possess it. all the days
[42:02] that you live upon the earth. And you
[42:05] shall utterly destroy all the places
[42:08] wherein the nations which you shall
[42:11] possess served their gods upon the high
[42:15] mountains and upon the hills and under
[42:18] every green tree. I'll just stop there
[42:21] for a moment. Do you know, and I'm sure
[42:24] that you do, that God regarded
[42:28] when the people worshiped false gods,
[42:32] he regarded that as an adulterous act
[42:36] &gt;&gt; because they were entering into
[42:38] something so sacred, something so holy,
[42:42] and something so intimate that God
[42:45] considered when a man or a woman gives
[42:48] of their very being and their soul to a
[42:52] false god. And God spoke through the
[42:55] prophets and said that they committed
[42:57] whoredoms uh upon every high hill and
[43:00] under every green tree. And and he he
[43:04] told Israel, "Cut your hair off. I'm
[43:06] going to I'm I'm going to divorce you.
[43:07] I'm going to put you away for that." And
[43:09] then he on in the chapter, I believe in
[43:12] Jeremiah 16 said, you know, can a man
[43:14] forget his wife? What was it? And the
[43:16] prophet said, "As Eve as Eve was
[43:19] polluted and uh and then uh so was
[43:22] Israel, Adam had a had a bride and God
[43:26] had a bride. Jehovah had a bride in in
[43:30] Israel and Jesus had a bride
[43:33] all the way through.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And the same thing happened in each
[43:37] case."
[43:38] And so God is telling them here, "And
[43:42] you shall overthrow their altars and
[43:45] break their pillars and burn their
[43:48] groves with fire, and you shall hew down
[43:52] the graven images of their gods and
[43:55] destroy the names of them out of that
[43:57] place." I can assure you that when a
[44:00] person comes into a real birth, into a
[44:03] real relationship with the word of this
[44:06] hour, that the gods of the past and the
[44:09] gods of my ideas and the gods of
[44:12] denominationalism are destroyed.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; That is why the rock that was cut out of
[44:18] the mountain without hands, it it struck
[44:20] that image at the feet and ground the
[44:23] thing to powder. There was nothing left.
[44:25] The wind just blew it away. I say God,
[44:28] even in this message, people hang on to
[44:30] old ideas and old theories and old
[44:34] denominational
[44:36] uh uh concepts. I say they need to be
[44:38] destroyed. They just need to pass away.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They need to come under
[44:43] subjection to the word of God which is
[44:46] Jesus Christ revealed. Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say,
[44:51] "You shall not
[44:54] uh
[44:56] and you shall overthrow," verse three,
[44:57] "you shall overthrow their altars and
[44:59] break their pillars and burn their
[45:00] groves with fire, and you shall hew down
[45:03] the graven images of their gods and
[45:06] destroy the names of them out of that
[45:08] place. You shall not do so unto the Lord
[45:11] your God, but unto the place which the
[45:14] Lord your God shall choose out of all
[45:17] your tribes to put his name, there even
[45:21] unto his habitation shall you seek, and
[45:25] thither shalt thou come. I was I was
[45:30] really struck with this phrase, and I
[45:33] would like you to remember it and keep
[45:36] it in your heart.
[45:39] unto his habitation
[45:42] shall you seek,
[45:45] and thither
[45:47] shalt thou come.
[45:54] There's a number of places, in fact
[45:56] about seven,
[45:58] and they're all found in Deuteronomy,
[46:02] and they're found between chapters 12,
[46:04] which we're reading, and I think chapter
[46:06] 18,
[46:09] and it's all has reference, and it says
[46:11] the same words, unto the place which the
[46:14] Lord your God shall choose. In in the
[46:18] fifth verse here which we just read, the
[46:21] 14th verse says, "But in the place which
[46:24] the Lord your God shall choose in one of
[46:27] thy tribes, there shalt thou offer thy
[46:29] burnt offerings, and thou shalt do all
[46:32] that I command thee." In the I won't
[46:34] read all the verses, but in 12 and 18,
[46:37] but thou must eat them before the Lord
[46:39] thy God in the place which the Lord thy
[46:42] God shall choose. in Deuteronomy 12 and
[46:46] 26. Only thy only thy holy things which
[46:49] thou hast and thy vows thou hast uh thou
[46:54] shalt take and go unto the place which
[46:57] the Lord shall choose in chapter 15 and
[47:01] 20. Thou shalt eat it before the Lord.
[47:04] These are the these are the feasts. And
[47:06] the and the Lord thy God year by year in
[47:10] the place which the Lord shall choose.
[47:14] and and thy household. And 16 and two,
[47:19] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[47:21] Passover unto the Lord thy God of the
[47:24] flock and the herd in the place which
[47:27] the Lord shall choose to place his name
[47:30] there. In 16 and 15, 7 days shalt thou
[47:34] keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy
[47:37] God in the place which the Lord the the
[47:41] Lord shall choose. in 17 and 10. And
[47:44] thou shalt do according to the sentence
[47:47] which they of that place which the Lord
[47:50] shall choose shall show thee in 18 and6.
[47:54] And if a Levite come uh from from any of
[47:57] thy gates out of all Israel where he
[47:59] sojourned and come with all desire of
[48:02] his mind unto the place which the Lord
[48:06] shall choose. So the place now the
[48:09] children of Israel are moving. These
[48:11] people are moving. They're transient.
[48:13] The place is not so much a hill or a
[48:16] mountain or a valley or a or a
[48:19] geographical location, but the place and
[48:22] you can see each of these references. I
[48:25] believe every one of them have reference
[48:28] to the people entering into worship and
[48:31] their sacrifices and their vows and
[48:34] their offerings. They are, shall I say,
[48:38] in communion with God. They're entering
[48:42] into not a not say this is a nice place
[48:45] under this tree or under this rock or
[48:47] whatever more had nothing to do with
[48:49] that but the thing that God was saying
[48:52] that this place it is a it is a certain
[48:56] realm that you will enter into this
[48:58] place that I choose and it was connected
[49:01] to keeping every word of God because it
[49:04] was impossible to enter into that place
[49:07] and disregard God's heard
[49:10] &gt;&gt; and the same holds true today.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the rapture.
[49:18] The rapture say, well, we have it in our
[49:20] mind. I know that we do because we've
[49:22] been taught that. And and and it is a
[49:25] place. Heaven is a heaven is a place,
[49:28] but there's a lot more to it than that.
[49:30] And if we're just simply waiting to go
[49:32] from this place to that place, I think
[49:35] that we're missing something. And I
[49:37] think that God wants us to know that
[49:39] it's not just from this place which we
[49:42] will say in a in a a time locked limit
[49:47] limited uh physical life which we have
[49:50] here to to an eternal realm. It's it's
[49:54] not just that but it is even more so a
[49:59] place that a person rises into
[50:03] &gt;&gt; in a relationship with God. Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; A relationship with Jesus Christ, an
[50:10] intimacy that is unknown to the world.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; It is a spiritual bedroom chamber.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; We enter into
[50:23] &gt;&gt; We are going to a marriage supper.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Not just a supper. It's a marriage
[50:31] supper. The people who go there have
[50:34] entered into a special relationship with
[50:38] that one. And we go there as the lamb's
[50:40] wife. I tell you, we have a relationship
[50:43] with that Christ. Now,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] So it's not just from this place to
[50:52] another place or from this dwelling
[50:54] place or this mortal to an immortal
[50:57] or from an earthly place that is so
[51:01] dictated to by time not not merely to an
[51:04] eternal timeless existence but this
[51:07] place the place is uh a position
[51:13] a status
[51:15] a class
[51:17] &gt;&gt; or a rank
[51:19] It's a place of eminence.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; It's a place of recognition
[51:24] &gt;&gt; that a people must enter into. And I
[51:27] believe our our call of God to come into
[51:31] this place.
[51:34] Now,
[51:36] uh,
[51:38] just to save some time, there are times
[51:41] in the scripture, I'll just go over it
[51:42] quickly, where God, for example, when he
[51:45] called Abram, who later became Abraham,
[51:47] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[51:49] kindred, and from thy father's house
[51:51] unto a land that I will show thee, a
[51:54] geographical place. I'm going to show
[51:55] you a place. I'm going to show you a
[51:58] physical land, and I'm going to give you
[52:00] that land. There were times when that
[52:02] when that took place in Exodus, uh God
[52:05] speaking, he said, "Behold, I stand
[52:07] before thee there upon the rock in
[52:10] Horeb." He's telling Moses, "I'll stand
[52:12] before you in the rock in Horeb." That
[52:14] wasn't on uh Hermon or or or Nebo or or
[52:19] Mount Carmel. It was on Horeb. God
[52:22] identified a certain uh geographical
[52:24] location. But when he said to Moses over
[52:26] and over again, "In the place that I
[52:28] will choose, in the place that I will
[52:30] choose, in the place that I will
[52:31] choose," it wasn't a geographical place
[52:33] where they stopped.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't an oasis or a certain place.
[52:37] It was a It was a a a realm that they
[52:40] entered into. It was a spiritual realm.
[52:43] It was a relationship with their God
[52:46] that they entered into.
[52:48] Even as marvelous as it was when Moses
[52:50] stood before a burning bush and uh and
[52:52] it burned and and was not consumed and
[52:55] God Almighty spoke and it was a pillar
[52:58] of fire burning there. There's no record
[53:00] that Moses ever went back to it.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Take off your shoes. The
[53:05] ground you're standing on is holy." It
[53:07] was holy because Moses was standing
[53:09] there being met by God himself.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't holy after God and Moses
[53:14] left. It wasn't a geographical location.
[53:17] It was something he entered into. He
[53:19] entered into a realm where God talked to
[53:22] him and he could speak back. Hallelujah.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; That's what God's talking about. And
[53:27] that is more what I want to come to in
[53:29] rapture. That's what rapture is all
[53:31] about. We can't sit here, you know, kind
[53:33] of numb and dull and and uh and uh uh
[53:37] kind of insulated sort of thing. We have
[53:39] to come into this house realizing we're
[53:41] the bride of Jesus Christ. We have a
[53:44] relationship with him. We have an
[53:46] intimacy that the world knows nothing
[53:48] about.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; And if you miss that, you're missing the
[53:53] whole thing.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; If you that are married, if you only
[53:58] have a roof over your head and and the
[54:01] and the woman does the cooking and the
[54:02] man does the working and brings in
[54:04] brings in the bacon, you're missing it.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; You're missing it.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; You can say amen or stay silent if you
[54:11] want. A home is something where where
[54:13] love is is exchanged from man to wife
[54:17] and that's what it's all about.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And someone might say, "Well, that's all
[54:24] right, Brother Ed, but I'm not married
[54:25] and I'm not I'm I'm this that we're not
[54:28] judging everything by your your
[54:30] particular unique position. I'm talking
[54:32] what the scripture says."
[54:34] And when the scripture says it starts
[54:37] out right away in Genesis,
[54:42] let me just see. I want to just go along
[54:44] here
[54:48] in Genesis when God began to speak to
[54:53] Adam
[54:57] and he says
[55:00] to multiply.
[55:03] He says to the animals, even to the
[55:06] fishes, multiply, bring forth, fill the
[55:10] seas.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's God's very nature. Multiply and
[55:16] bring forth.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And he made it one of the most sacred of
[55:21] things. And so what now when we're
[55:23] talking about a place, I want you to be
[55:25] mature now. Going to talk about a place.
[55:29] Uh, I'm not going to preach on this, but
[55:30] the place, a husband's responsibility,
[55:34] but not his responsibility, but his
[55:36] position, a husband's position is a
[55:39] place.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Because he's elevated to a place in
[55:42] marriage. And a woman that gets married,
[55:46] she's elevated to a place. See, she's
[55:49] not just a girl. She's not just a
[55:52] someone that's in school. She's not
[55:54] going to college. She's not learning a
[55:56] career now. She's entering into what God
[55:58] has chosen and made her for. And it's a
[56:02] place of fulfillment. It's a place where
[56:05] the husband and the wife, the man and
[56:07] his wife, it's such a sacred thing. And
[56:09] Satan has so he's deployed all of his uh
[56:14] all of his armorament at this very
[56:16] sacred thing.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, he's he's he's wre
[56:22] havoc
[56:24] &gt;&gt; upon the family and upon the home. And
[56:26] I'm not talking a social. I'm talking
[56:28] about Christ and his bride. And and and
[56:30] that the only reason we have what we
[56:33] have which is sacred and uh we have you
[56:36] know uh young men, young ladies or just
[56:38] men and and ladies come to the altar to
[56:42] receive one another. And it always it's
[56:44] a great celebration. It's a great happy
[56:46] time. And the families are oh all
[56:49] excited and enthused about it. and and
[56:51] uh young ladies, you know, have stars in
[56:53] their eyes and they're just uh looking
[56:55] with anticipation of the future and all
[56:57] the rest of it. And young couple just in
[57:00] in expectation of what lays before them
[57:02] and all the rest of it. You only have
[57:04] that because God has already instituted
[57:06] it.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; God already ordained it. And I can tell
[57:10] you what, friends, the Bible, not that I
[57:13] I don't mean to say it that way, but the
[57:15] Bible begins with a love story between
[57:18] Adam and and Adam and Eve in Eden. And
[57:22] it ends with the lamb and his wife in
[57:24] Revelation. This Bible right here is not
[57:27] a book of ethics. This Bible is not how
[57:30] to run a church. This Bible is a love
[57:32] story from Genesis to Revelation. And
[57:36] it's the most intimate of love stories.
[57:38] And I tell you what, friends, regardless
[57:40] of how how much revelation you get, I do
[57:44] not believe we will plum the depth of
[57:47] this intimacy that Jesus Christ wants to
[57:50] have with his church, with his people.
[57:53] In fact, is the rapture to me is that
[57:57] &gt;&gt; and it's that we enter into.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We talk about crossing over. I tell you
[58:02] what, we got to know and God intends for
[58:05] us to know this kind of a relationship
[58:08] untainted by the world, unaffected by
[58:12] the world. And I want to caution you and
[58:14] I want to warn you, do not allow the
[58:17] world, do not allow Satan to interpret
[58:20] to you what a man and a woman, what a
[58:23] young man, what a young woman. Don't let
[58:25] Satan interpret to you what purity is.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; He knows nothing about purity. He's an
[58:30] impure creature and don't let him make
[58:33] wreak havoc and make a make mockery of
[58:36] virginity. It is it is a blessed thing
[58:40] in the sight of God.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Whether you have it or you don't have
[58:44] it, that's irrelevant to me. But tonight
[58:47] for this message, I say that's something
[58:49] that God has given.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; It's something to be protected. It's
[58:53] something to be revered.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll not allow him. I deny and
[59:02] defy the enemy that tries to come in and
[59:05] make purity and make it uh oh, you're
[59:08] pure. I tell you what, you want to throw
[59:10] your shoulders back and say, "Thank God
[59:12] I am."
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I could never protect myself, but God
[59:17] has done it.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And you want to thank God for it.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're entering into a realm
[59:23] of relationship
[59:25] &gt;&gt; that the world can never give you.
[59:30] Hallelujah.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; It's something to be treasured.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And when we come to the house of God,
[59:37] we're not in this place. When we come
[59:39] into this place, it has nothing to do
[59:41] with the geographical location. 18306 on
[59:45] 60th Avenue. Has nothing to do with
[59:47] that. Has nothing to do with the name of
[59:49] Cloverdale Bible Way. But it is that God
[59:52] in his great wisdom in his mind came
[59:55] across your pathway and led you to a
[59:58] place in Christ.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And so we have a certain respect for
[1:00:02] brothers and sisters in the family of
[1:00:03] God in the house of God that God uh
[1:00:06] perhaps met and did special things for
[1:00:08] us. It's a but it doesn't make it a a
[1:00:11] sacred shrine. It just makes it a place
[1:00:14] that God has ordained that we should
[1:00:16] come and be together.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] And so this place that God speaks about,
[1:00:26] as I said earlier,
[1:00:29] it's a standing. There's different words
[1:00:32] in the Hebrew for the place that God has
[1:00:35] ordained.
[1:00:40] But it's a place where you can stand.
[1:00:42] It's a region.
[1:00:44] It's a place where you can rise up and
[1:00:47] be established.
[1:00:50] And there's a specific emphasis now that
[1:00:53] God has made a specific emphasis
[1:00:56] even unto his habitation.
[1:00:59] This is not a request. I want you to I
[1:01:01] want you to listen close now. God is
[1:01:04] saying to you tonight, I would never be
[1:01:05] on this subject. I didn't dream this up.
[1:01:10] In fact, as I wouldn't have normally
[1:01:11] been preaching tonight, but I felt very
[1:01:14] pressed.
[1:01:15] Even unto his habitation shall you seek.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] And thither
[1:01:27] shalt thou come.
[1:01:30] You will come to it.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; If you're one of his, you're going to
[1:01:34] come to it.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; But first, before you get there, you
[1:01:38] shall seek it.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You shall desire it. As the deer, as a
[1:01:42] heart panth after the waterbrooks, so
[1:01:44] pantth my soul after thee, oh God.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; His habitation
[1:01:58] that you shall seek
[1:02:01] is not merely a dwelling,
[1:02:06] but it's a place where you settle down.
[1:02:11] a place that you will abide. You're not
[1:02:14] going to be leaving there.
[1:02:19] It's a place
[1:02:23] that you will rest. You'll come to a
[1:02:25] rest.
[1:02:28] You'll come to a relaxation.
[1:02:31] So much so that the word of habitation,
[1:02:34] you'll come to my habitation.
[1:02:36] And you know in the world we have the
[1:02:38] word word cohabit
[1:02:41] cohabitation
[1:02:44] which has a direct inference to marriage
[1:02:47] and that union. And that's exactly what
[1:02:50] this word means. It is that you will
[1:02:53] rest, you'll relax, you will lie down.
[1:02:57] And it has a direct reference to the
[1:02:59] married sexual relationship.
[1:03:03] And if you take that word through the
[1:03:05] through the Hebrew, it runs all the way
[1:03:08] through the entire Old Testament
[1:03:12] where a woman
[1:03:14] came to her husband or came to another
[1:03:16] man, whatever the case might be.
[1:03:19] And that's where that word comes from.
[1:03:21] But God says,
[1:03:24] "You shall seek
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; this place.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; You shall seek this relationship."
[1:03:32] God does not want to be just a provider
[1:03:34] for us.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, give me this, give me that, give me
[1:03:38] something else. God wants to enter into
[1:03:40] a relationship with his people. And
[1:03:43] Satan is trying to perpetrate a fraud
[1:03:45] upon the people that they can't scarcely
[1:03:48] grasp this in a proper balance. Oh God,
[1:03:52] how how how do I have this where I have
[1:03:55] this kind of a relationship because the
[1:03:57] world has made it such a filthy thing.
[1:04:00] But I want to deny that and purge your
[1:04:02] minds of that tonight by the washing of
[1:04:05] the water, by the word, and let you know
[1:04:07] that God intends a sacred intimate
[1:04:11] relationship
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; with his people.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; The people opens, as I said, the
[1:04:21] scripture opens with the scene
[1:04:25] of Adam and his wife in Eden. And the
[1:04:28] first words that God utters
[1:04:31] be fruitful
[1:04:33] and multiply
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:04:38] They cannot do thus without having that
[1:04:41] intimacy
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; that God
[1:04:45] prepared for them.
[1:04:48] Jesus
[1:04:50] when he was here in his first coming he
[1:04:54] said the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[1:04:57] a king which made a marriage for his
[1:04:59] son. Who's he talking about? I'm talking
[1:05:02] about himself.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; is like unto a king that made a great
[1:05:10] marriage for his son. He's the son
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; and that's what he's talking about. And
[1:05:15] he invited and he sent forth his
[1:05:17] servants to call him that were bidden to
[1:05:19] the wedding. He thought they would be
[1:05:21] excited. They would come to this
[1:05:22] wedding. They would come to this
[1:05:24] glorious event. And they would not come.
[1:05:28] And while they went, and the Bible
[1:05:30] speaks of those in Matthew 25 that the
[1:05:33] voice came, "Oh, arise, uh, behold, the
[1:05:36] bridegroom cometh." And they that were
[1:05:39] ready went in with him into the
[1:05:43] marriage.
[1:05:45] They didn't just go with him into the
[1:05:46] supper. They went with him into the
[1:05:48] marriage.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; They came into a union.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We have continual, we're continually
[1:06:01] bombarded
[1:06:02] with a gay parade, pride celebration.
[1:06:06] You know what it is? It's a celebration.
[1:06:09] It's a celebration that the seed that
[1:06:11] God gave to man is refused by woman.
[1:06:16] That's what they're celebrating. And
[1:06:19] celebrating that man has been done such
[1:06:22] dastardly things
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; as to live in such a way that the
[1:06:26] scripture commanded death for it.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And I could get into a lot of trouble
[1:06:31] for saying this, but I deny Satan to
[1:06:34] perpetrate upon my mind any fraud.
[1:06:37] That's what God's holy word has said.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; This scripture is speaking about a
[1:06:43] relationship. And they talk about these
[1:06:46] celebrations. Look how they've turned
[1:06:48] the whole the whole society around.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; It's time that we stand up and declare
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; what the truth of God's word is all
[1:06:57] about. God desires. I'm not going to
[1:06:59] fear for a job. I'm not going to fear
[1:07:01] that the doors of this church are
[1:07:03] closed. If they're closed, we'll preach
[1:07:05] on the streets.
[1:07:07] We'll preach in the garage. We'll preach
[1:07:10] wherever we can preach. But we'll not
[1:07:12] deny the truth of God's word.
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; We're not going to cower to it.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; We're not going to bow down to it.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; We don't bow down to that deadly thing,
[1:07:27] godless society,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; and the leaders go right with it. And
[1:07:32] they'll be destroyed with them if they
[1:07:34] don't repent themselves.
[1:07:37] From the highest of the politicians to
[1:07:41] the civic politicians to whoever they
[1:07:44] are to go out this way merely for votes,
[1:07:47] they'll die with this.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says God's going to
[1:07:52] burn it up.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, it can't
[1:07:54] happen too soon. Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's the truth of God's word.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And the whole purpose behind it is to
[1:08:02] try and contaminate the minds of the
[1:08:05] people who would try to seek out and
[1:08:07] understand the scriptures.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And that's what rapture actually is. We
[1:08:11] have to enter into a marriage with him
[1:08:14] first before we go to the supper.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say we went to church first
[1:08:19] or we sang in the choir first or we
[1:08:22] played an instrument first. We had a
[1:08:24] marriage first.
[1:08:27] That's rapture.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; And do not let the world try to taint
[1:08:32] your minds or tell you what this means
[1:08:34] or that means. The devil and all of his
[1:08:36] hordes and all of the people that follow
[1:08:38] him know nothing about the intimacy that
[1:08:41] the scripture talks about.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And it's for you.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil cheat you out of
[1:08:49] it.
[1:08:52] Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; The sum total and substance of the
[1:09:00] entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[1:09:04] is on this subject.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have enough time in a week of
[1:09:09] preaching to cover this subject. And
[1:09:12] here I am on a Wednesday night trying to
[1:09:14] approach it.
[1:09:18] And God blessed them
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; and said unto them, "Be fruitful."
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And multiply.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Be fruitful.
[1:09:33] And God bless them. God, Jehovah,
[1:09:37] almighty God, the first act he does upon
[1:09:42] his son. And God blessed them right
[1:09:45] after he made them. God blessed them.
[1:09:48] And said his first words, "Be fruitful
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and multiply."
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; He could have said a lot of other
[1:09:55] things. Could have said, "I'll be with
[1:09:57] you always. I'll never let I'll never
[1:09:59] let one of these animals get at you.
[1:10:01] I'll protect you. You're going to have
[1:10:02] things easy. All these things." He could
[1:10:04] have said, "All that." That is what he
[1:10:06] said. He had his mind on one thing.
[1:10:08] You're going to be fruitful, and you're
[1:10:10] going to multiply, and you're going to
[1:10:11] bring a continual expression of myself.
[1:10:14] Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in spoken words,
[1:10:20] the original seed, Jehovah had a bride
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; that he loved.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Jehovah had a bride
[1:10:29] that he loved.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I got a wife here and I'm thankful that
[1:10:33] she loves me. Have children and have a
[1:10:36] congregation and I feel loved. But oh,
[1:10:39] it has nothing. It can't compare with
[1:10:42] thinking that Almighty God would love me
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; and love you. And Jehovah had a bride
[1:10:49] and he loved her.
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; He loved Israel.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And Israel went to whoring
[1:11:01] after strange gods
[1:11:04] and played the part of the harlot.
[1:11:06] Right.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "And God spoke
[1:11:10] through the prophet and said, "You've
[1:11:11] laid on every green tree and you've
[1:11:13] allowed your breasts to be pressed
[1:11:15] down." And what's he talking about? He's
[1:11:17] talking about this terrible
[1:11:19] relationship. But what what were they
[1:11:21] doing? They were worshiping other gods.
[1:11:23] And he says they've even gone as far as
[1:11:25] to offer their sons and their daughters,
[1:11:27] which was the fruit of their bodies to
[1:11:29] these gods.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; What have you done?
[1:11:34] Think of this generation.
[1:11:37] The abortions that they committed every
[1:11:40] single day and children murdered,
[1:11:44] which it actually is.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And all of this filth, I can tell you,
[1:11:50] it's only filth in their minds. It's
[1:11:53] only filth where they've dragged it. But
[1:11:55] let me announce to you that everything
[1:11:57] that God has instituted is absolutely
[1:11:59] holy.
[1:12:04] I'm going to say things. You young men
[1:12:06] that are growing up here and becoming
[1:12:08] into maturity and young women and all
[1:12:10] the rest said, "I have certain desires.
[1:12:12] I feel so terrible. I I have such guilt.
[1:12:14] I have such lust. I have such desires."
[1:12:16] You know what I'm going to say is,
[1:12:17] "Pastor, nonsense.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that told you it's
[1:12:21] unclean.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; God put it in your system. God made you
[1:12:25] that way and he gave it to you so you
[1:12:27] could control it under the word of God
[1:12:29] and remain pure and holy.
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; But God gave it to you. And I've
[1:12:36] counseledled with a lot of people that I
[1:12:37] don't ever remember preaching it as
[1:12:39] plain as I am tonight. But I've
[1:12:41] counseledled with a lot of young people
[1:12:42] and they come under that under that
[1:12:44] cloud. You know why? Cuz the world, the
[1:12:46] devil interpreted that desire to you.
[1:12:49] This is low. This is filthy. This is
[1:12:50] dirty. This is nasty. It's something
[1:12:52] that God gave you
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; and it's only dirty if you allow him to
[1:12:58] control it. But if you allow God to
[1:13:00] control it, it's pure. It's holy. It's
[1:13:03] something that God has given.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And this kind of preaching will set you
[1:13:08] free.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; You don't let the devil interpret it for
[1:13:12] you.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You don't let the world interpret it for
[1:13:16] you. You let the word interpret it for
[1:13:18] you. Hallelujah. This will take the wind
[1:13:22] out of his sails and this will set you
[1:13:24] free.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You want to go out of this place tonight
[1:13:27] liberated. Say, I accept what you've
[1:13:29] said about this God.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to come to your husbands
[1:13:35] and your wives pure
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; and enter into a relationship.
[1:13:41] Praise God.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of other areas I'm
[1:13:45] not even going to try to touch on and
[1:13:47] deal, but this is this is the this is a
[1:13:49] focus point of the scripture. In the
[1:13:52] spoken word, brother Brandham said,
[1:13:54] "Adam's wife rejected rejected to bring
[1:13:57] life. She brought forth death. We're her
[1:14:01] product." Hello.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; We're all her product. By the woman, he
[1:14:06] said we die.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But by the man, we live.
[1:14:10] Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Do you follow that? By the woman, you've
[1:14:14] been born of a woman. And because you've
[1:14:15] been born of a woman, you die. Has
[1:14:17] nothing to do, it's nothing against a
[1:14:19] woman. That's the way it the world
[1:14:20] happened. We all have a natural birth,
[1:14:23] sexual birth. And by that, we die.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; But by a birth, by our heavenly parent,
[1:14:28] we live
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; and we live forever.
[1:14:42] He says
[1:14:44] we're her product, our bodies.
[1:14:47] I'm glad he said our bodies. Our soul
[1:14:50] didn't come from our mama.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Our soul didn't come from our daddy. Our
[1:14:54] soul came from God.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And God looked upon that and said,
[1:14:58] "That's mine." Hallelujah. Satan, you
[1:15:01] can't have it. You can't even
[1:15:03] contaminate it. I'm going to hold it and
[1:15:05] protect it and I'm going to bring it to
[1:15:07] myself. But you shall seek after me. You
[1:15:11] shall seek this kind of a relationship.
[1:15:13] You shall seek this kind of
[1:15:14] cohabitation.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You shall seek this kind of relationship
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; where you relax,
[1:15:25] where you trust,
[1:15:28] where you give yourself over completely.
[1:15:33] And the way God described it was the
[1:15:35] marriage relationship
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; so completely
[1:15:40] surrendered to one another.
[1:15:43] Tell you what folks wouldn't be a bit
[1:15:45] surprised that all of us here tonight.
[1:15:50] We'll learn something from this
[1:15:51] Wednesday night service. Say, "Oh God,
[1:15:56] take me
[1:15:57] take me out of the kitchen
[1:16:00] where you just provide for me. Take me
[1:16:03] out of the living room where we just
[1:16:04] have fellowship, fellowship, fellowship.
[1:16:06] Take me to that bedroom chamber where
[1:16:08] the prophet says it's a three-bedroom.
[1:16:11] It's a three- room house. Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] It's a three room house. And uh as far
[1:16:15] as the church world is concerned, they
[1:16:17] know nothing about the bedroom chamber.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And soon as you say all kinds of all
[1:16:22] kinds of wicked things and evil things,
[1:16:24] I say shut them out.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let him even crowd in. He has no
[1:16:32] right. And even preachers of the gospel
[1:16:35] think, "Oh, that is that's too intimate.
[1:16:37] That's too close. We can't dare say
[1:16:39] that." I say, "We better say it or there
[1:16:42] won't be a rapture."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; A rapture is a relationship.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; A rapture is a marriage before the
[1:16:48] supper.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And we're to preach until you have that
[1:16:52] relationship.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Till you're unashamed to enter into that
[1:16:58] kind of intimacy.
[1:17:01] Oh God, it'll mean more to you after the
[1:17:04] service when you say, "As the deer panth
[1:17:06] after the water brooks, then you'll be
[1:17:09] able to go into the Song of Solomon and
[1:17:11] read several chapters as I did before
[1:17:14] service tonight." Oh, says, "I'm sick of
[1:17:17] love. I'm sick of love."
[1:17:20] Tell me, have you seen him?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him. I'm searching for
[1:17:26] him. Others have wounded me. Mother's
[1:17:29] told me, "You're crazy,
[1:17:31] but I can't be as satisfied. My thirst
[1:17:35] can't be quenched till I have found
[1:17:37] him."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Ah, she said, "When I found him, he took
[1:17:41] a hold of me. He embraced me. He held me
[1:17:44] with his hand."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; His right hand was under my head.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You think that's some loosey goosey
[1:17:55] nonsense? The world knows nothing about
[1:17:58] this. And incidentally,
[1:18:01] heaven preached on it for many, many
[1:18:03] years. But she said, his right hand,
[1:18:06] she was aware, his right hand, and his
[1:18:08] right hand is what held the message. His
[1:18:11] right hand held all the seven
[1:18:12] messengers. His right hand was under her
[1:18:15] head.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; She was supported.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By what he held in his right
[1:18:22] hand.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; She was embraced.
[1:18:27] by the word.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Awesome.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Adam's bride, he said, was found of the
[1:18:37] false seed. That's exactly right. And
[1:18:40] Jehovah's bride was found the same way.
[1:18:43] Right. And he divorced her and put her
[1:18:45] away. Is that right? That was God. And
[1:18:48] Christ's bride is the same thing. She's
[1:18:51] found with worldly organization seed in
[1:18:53] her and not the gospel having a form of
[1:18:56] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:18:59] uh from the Holy Spirit and from the
[1:19:01] word.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Five women, you've heard me speak on
[1:19:07] them before.
[1:19:09] Five women are listed
[1:19:13] in the chapter that starts out
[1:19:16] the book
[1:19:19] of the generation
[1:19:22] of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:27] The book
[1:19:29] of the generation singular of Jesus
[1:19:33] Christ,
[1:19:34] the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1:19:38] Five women,
[1:19:41] Tamar,
[1:19:45] Rahab the harlot, and Tamar
[1:19:48] received seed
[1:19:50] from her father-in-law,
[1:19:54] which was totally against this word,
[1:20:01] Rahab
[1:20:03] the harlot,
[1:20:07] and Ruth the Moabitete
[1:20:12] who came through a genealogy
[1:20:15] that actually had a commencement from
[1:20:17] incest
[1:20:22] and Bath Sheeba who was Uriah's wife
[1:20:26] who David had murdered
[1:20:30] so he had Bath Sheba
[1:20:33] these are called the generation
[1:20:37] of Jesus Jesus Christ and the Virgin
[1:20:39] Mary.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; All of these women have one thing in
[1:20:44] common and that is all of them received
[1:20:48] seed and by receiving seed their status
[1:20:53] and position in life changed
[1:20:56] dramatically.
[1:21:00] Four of them received seed by man
[1:21:05] and one received seed by God.
[1:21:10] This is the book of the generation of
[1:21:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:21:15] And Sarah received
[1:21:19] seed
[1:21:20] when she was past the age and her womb
[1:21:23] was dead
[1:21:25] and milk veins dried up and her husband
[1:21:28] was his body was dead. But God by his
[1:21:33] promise gave life.
[1:21:36] All of these five women, what the
[1:21:39] scripture is saying is that these women,
[1:21:45] not only was their status changed, but
[1:21:47] each one of them, if you were to read
[1:21:49] their account, listen closely,
[1:21:53] their entire
[1:21:56] state of affairs,
[1:21:58] their entire
[1:22:00] position, their entire realm was
[1:22:04] transformed. formed
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; completely
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; completely
[1:22:10] and instantly
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; when they received when Kamar receive
[1:22:16] seed of Judah
[1:22:18] you may not understand it but you take
[1:22:20] what you're hearing and hang on to it
[1:22:23] because this is the scripture
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; and this is where it goes way beyond
[1:22:31] anything you could understand from the
[1:22:33] marriage relationship ship. The thirst
[1:22:37] and the the pangs of desire were so
[1:22:41] great within the hearts and beings of
[1:22:45] these women that they desired after God.
[1:22:49] They didn't desire. It was no fleshly
[1:22:52] relationship that they were desiring.
[1:22:54] Their soul cried out
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; for something they didn't understand.
[1:23:00] And I'm telling you tonight with all the
[1:23:03] ferveny of my soul, God's trying to get
[1:23:06] something across to you people sitting
[1:23:07] there. He's trying to get something
[1:23:09] across to you that there's a
[1:23:10] relationship that we must enter into
[1:23:13] with Jesus Christ that even you don't
[1:23:15] understand.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; And perhaps you'll never understand it.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You thirst after God.
[1:23:26] You say, "Why is it I crave after him
[1:23:29] with such a desire and it doesn't seem
[1:23:31] to be satisfied? I have such a craving.
[1:23:34] I come in the house of God. God meets me
[1:23:36] in a special way. I I had a certain
[1:23:38] experience with him and oh, it was so
[1:23:40] glorious. It was so marvelous." Let me
[1:23:42] tell you something. We haven't touched
[1:23:44] We haven't touched the surface of it
[1:23:45] yet, but what God is trying to do is
[1:23:47] pull you through to the other side
[1:23:50] because it's this kind of a thirst. It's
[1:23:52] this kind of a craving that's going to
[1:23:54] pull you into the rapture.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; You won't get it any other way.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "I hunger after God." You want
[1:24:04] to thank God that you do tonight.
[1:24:17] I'd like to say so much more
[1:24:19] about these about these women.
[1:24:23] Every time I read it, it's just so
[1:24:25] incomprehensible. How are you going to
[1:24:27] answer that one? How you people going to
[1:24:28] figure that one out? You'll never figure
[1:24:30] that one out.
[1:24:32] You've heard me speak about Tamar, but I
[1:24:34] It's not enough to hear me speak about
[1:24:36] it. It it's it's more that you
[1:24:37] contemplate and that you meditate and
[1:24:39] say, "God, what is it you're saying?
[1:24:41] This is the very book of the generation
[1:24:42] of Jesus Christ." They're telling us how
[1:24:45] Jesus Christ came. This is the record.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you that God transformed in a
[1:24:54] moment of time the realm of of Rahab the
[1:24:59] harlot. Oh, her life changed
[1:25:02] dramatically. Dramatically. You'll never
[1:25:04] be able to describe it
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; here. She has a house.
[1:25:10] She's a harlot.
[1:25:12] And God,
[1:25:15] what is the distance?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; What is the distance from being a
[1:25:19] roadside harlot
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; to being written in Genesis 1?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; What is that span?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It's like an eternity.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Who can comprehend that span? Who can
[1:25:32] comprehend the span of taking that poor
[1:25:35] soul
[1:25:37] and then uniting her and bringing her
[1:25:40] in? And the prophet telling us that uh
[1:25:42] an officer of the Israel Israel army,
[1:25:46] the Hebrews took her to wife
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; and she became a mother into the kingly
[1:25:52] lineage of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:59] and Ruth
[1:26:02] and Ba Sheba.
[1:26:08] We say so much about
[1:26:11] Rebecca
[1:26:14] and Isaac
[1:26:16] and Eleazar and we sing we sing songs
[1:26:20] and the specials about Isaac and the
[1:26:24] camel train is coming.
[1:26:28] has very little to do about the camel
[1:26:29] train,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But it has a lot to do with Rebecca
[1:26:33] saying, "Who is that man
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; standing out in the field? This world is
[1:26:38] a field. Who is this man?" She finds a
[1:26:41] she finds somebody.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Says, "That's my master's son."
[1:26:52] And the scripture says, "And Isaac
[1:26:55] brought her
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; into his mother Sarah's tent and took
[1:27:00] Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he
[1:27:03] loved her, and Isaac was comforted after
[1:27:06] his mother's death."
[1:27:10] Is this a love story? Far be it from so
[1:27:14] this is Isaac, the promised son. Yes,
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; he's a type of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And I can assure you that when this
[1:27:24] bride of Jesus Christ in this generation
[1:27:28] seeks after him,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; seeks after his habitation,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; habitation, it's not just temple,
[1:27:34] pavilion, tabernacle, house dwelling.
[1:27:37] Now it's tabernacle. I'm bringing
[1:27:39] another side to you. It's tabernac. It
[1:27:41] is is habitation. And you shall seek
[1:27:44] after this habitation. You shall seek
[1:27:47] after this relationship and anything
[1:27:49] less than that is not good enough.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And thou shalt
[1:28:02] you shall come in."
[1:28:06] and our Isaac.
[1:28:09] Our Isaac,
[1:28:13] I tell you what, friends,
[1:28:16] I care nothing for what the world has to
[1:28:18] say.
[1:28:19] And if you can possibly decontaminate
[1:28:22] your mind,
[1:28:25] but Christ has one thing on his mind,
[1:28:28] and that is a love relationship. as
[1:28:30] Isaac saw her and took her into his
[1:28:33] mother's tempt and became husband to
[1:28:37] her.
[1:28:38] When Christ people say, "Oh, oh, I
[1:28:40] repented and I I I I wept at the altar
[1:28:43] and all the rest of it." That's all
[1:28:45] wonderful. I'm glad you repented. But I
[1:28:47] want to announce to you tonight, there's
[1:28:48] one thing on his mind, and that is that
[1:28:51] he he can come to you in such an
[1:28:54] intimacy
[1:28:56] and
[1:28:58] gives you seed as Mary receives seed.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; These other women, the four
[1:29:12] in in Matthew 1,
[1:29:15] before
[1:29:17] they were taken to be wife and receive
[1:29:21] seed.
[1:29:23] Mary. She was pregnant,
[1:29:27] still a virgin,
[1:29:29] and had not known a man.
[1:29:33] And that is a that is not exactly our
[1:29:36] type
[1:29:38] because she was still a carrier.
[1:29:41] We enter into such a relationship. It
[1:29:43] goes beyond my description. But the
[1:29:45] bride of Jesus Christ is not merely a
[1:29:47] carrier.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:49] This prophet said in such astounding
[1:29:52] words, she becomes him.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was word, she's word.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It's not that he was word and she's a
[1:30:01] carrier of the word. Mary was a carrier,
[1:30:04] but she issued out, but she was
[1:30:06] pregnantated and still virgin. In that
[1:30:08] sense, that is also the bride of Jesus
[1:30:10] Christ. Pregnated with the word of God.
[1:30:12] So, let it be unto me according to your
[1:30:14] word. and the and the very life of
[1:30:16] Christ uh comes into us as a as
[1:30:19] believers and we become we express
[1:30:22] Christ. But it goes deeper than that.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; See, you want to really be spiritual.
[1:30:33] You want to really pray because I'll
[1:30:35] tell you what, I'll be honest before
[1:30:37] God. I'm as sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[1:30:39] right now that I'm just listening to him
[1:30:42] how far I shall go.
[1:30:44] And if you can take it, I may go a
[1:30:47] little further.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; But if God sees that you can't, then I
[1:30:50] will stop.
[1:30:52] These things go much deeper
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; and richer.
[1:30:57] Last Sunday morning as I start speaking
[1:30:59] on the rapture, you think maybe I spent
[1:31:01] 10 or 20 hours, which I do most every
[1:31:03] week on on on a message. That message
[1:31:06] has been in my heart and in my bosom for
[1:31:09] at least six years and I think more like
[1:31:11] 8 to 10 years. And I've held that before
[1:31:14] God and without approaching it. I would
[1:31:18] approach it just come to this to come to
[1:31:20] the edge of it and then back away. And a
[1:31:22] couple conventions I was telling the
[1:31:24] people the prophet of God actually
[1:31:26] walked through. He walked through the
[1:31:30] whole order of the rapture in the last
[1:31:33] days of his life. And then I would just
[1:31:35] drop it and see how the Holy Spirit
[1:31:37] would make it known to the people. But I
[1:31:40] felt that I this was the season
[1:31:43] to bring it down to your friends.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And all of these everything that here
[1:31:50] the prophet is speaking about, I will
[1:31:53] dwell in the house of God. I will
[1:31:55] inquire in his temple. All his realms,
[1:31:57] it's all descriptive of of of the
[1:32:00] rapture experience. But the real the
[1:32:04] real heart of it is you shall seek unto
[1:32:07] this habitation.
[1:32:10] And I will say to you tonight as a
[1:32:12] congregation, there isn't a man or a
[1:32:14] woman sitting here and myself included.
[1:32:16] But what needs to seek under that kind
[1:32:20] of relationship?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; You see, you can say,
[1:32:26] "Well, brother Biscll, I uh I have heard
[1:32:28] and I believed already that we have
[1:32:30] entered into that relationship with him
[1:32:33] and we are already married to him and
[1:32:35] I've already received his seed." That is
[1:32:37] true. But you can ask other married
[1:32:40] couples around here. Lots of people have
[1:32:41] experienced that. And the whole marriage
[1:32:43] union just kind of, you know, becomes
[1:32:48] very very mechanical
[1:32:51] and the dynamics
[1:32:53] dissipate and diminish and are gone and
[1:32:57] fade away because the world saps it out
[1:33:00] of the natural home. And the same devil
[1:33:03] and the same world wants to sap it out
[1:33:06] of your spiritual experience. But we
[1:33:08] want to rise up tonight and say, "I deny
[1:33:10] him. I deny his right."
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And I feel sorry for you if you sit here
[1:33:18] and let the devil cheat you out of that
[1:33:20] kind of an experience.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for anybody that would sit
[1:33:25] back and say, "I sooner just live with
[1:33:27] my own miserable self." God help you.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to set you free.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You want to shake yourself.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Shake yourself.
[1:33:37] Come out of that dismal position that
[1:33:40] you're in.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Let your mouth speak the truth
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; rather than something that Satan who
[1:33:48] wants to give Satan any glory or credit
[1:33:50] tonight.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; He says in the last days and I'm going
[1:34:00] to close. I've got to close.
[1:34:10] I spoke of Isaac.
[1:34:14] Let me give you one more just before I
[1:34:17] move on to this last quote or two.
[1:34:20] David and when the morning was passed
[1:34:24] because David had a child with Basheba
[1:34:26] and God took him and he died.
[1:34:29] And when the morning was passed,
[1:34:32] David sent and fetched her to his house,
[1:34:37] and she became his wife and bare him a
[1:34:40] son. But the thing that David had done
[1:34:43] displeased the Lord.
[1:34:45] The thing that David did displeased the
[1:34:47] Lord. There isn't anybody here but what?
[1:34:49] We have done things. We have thought
[1:34:50] things. We've committed things that has
[1:34:52] displeased the Lord. But that does not
[1:34:55] deter God from his objective.
[1:34:58] If he's got you assigned and allotted
[1:35:01] for a rapture and a change of this body,
[1:35:04] he's going to bring you to it one way or
[1:35:06] another.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; He will not be deterred. He will not be
[1:35:11] denied and he will not be defeated.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He says of his bride, she's going to
[1:35:15] rise. She's going to stand. She's going
[1:35:18] to be established. She's going to come
[1:35:20] into my house. She's going to be my
[1:35:21] wife.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And nothing's going to prevent that.
[1:35:27] Yes.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in these last days,
[1:35:35] the true bride church, which he says is
[1:35:39] Christ's seed,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; will come to the headstone. Listen to
[1:35:44] this now. And she will be the super
[1:35:47] church, a super race. As she nears him,
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:54] as she nears him, her status is changed.
[1:35:57] Her whole realm of existence has
[1:35:59] changed.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I can tell you when
[1:36:03] King David began to come near to Ba
[1:36:06] Sheba and she came near to him, her
[1:36:08] status changed.
[1:36:10] And Rahab when she came to the to
[1:36:13] Solomon her status changed from harlotry
[1:36:18] into the lineage of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; As she nears him and they and the bride
[1:36:27] will be so much like him that they will
[1:36:31] even be his very image. This in order to
[1:36:35] be united with him and they will be one.
[1:36:42] I say glory,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; We are one with him,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; united with him,
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; married to him,
[1:36:54] carrying his seed.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; What a great honor.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; What a place God has given us.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Oh church.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh church.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:09] What an honor he's bestowed upon us.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; How lovely he is.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Habitation.
[1:37:36] Even
[1:37:38] unto his habitation shalt thou seek,
[1:37:43] and thither
[1:37:45] shalt thou come.
[1:37:48] I send you home with those words. And
[1:37:51] thither you shall come.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; If you're not there yet, thither you
[1:37:56] shall come.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless all of you who hear this
[1:38:02] word tonight. God bless you. This isn't
[1:38:05] friends. This isn't, you know, this
[1:38:07] isn't mild chicken soup tonight. I felt
[1:38:10] perhaps why it had to be a Wednesday
[1:38:12] night because those who really hunger
[1:38:15] and thirst after God, I feel come
[1:38:17] together on the night. And I God bless
[1:38:19] you. God bless you young people. And may
[1:38:22] you know something more about it. And
[1:38:23] let me tell you, protect your minds. And
[1:38:26] don't you let the devil try to tell you
[1:38:29] what this is all about and what sex is
[1:38:31] all about and what love is all about.
[1:38:33] They don't know nothing about it. Never
[1:38:36] have known anything about it. They've
[1:38:37] been perverted since Eden.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; They ate from the wrong tree, but we're
[1:38:42] eating from the right tree.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, that thrills my soul is Jesus. He is
[1:38:57] more than life to me.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; And the fairest of 10,000
[1:39:03] in my blessed Lord I see.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Let us sing it. Why don't we stand and
[1:39:12] while you're standing and getting ready,
[1:39:14] we're going to we're just bow and
[1:39:16] worship him. Tell him whatever's in your
[1:39:19] heart.
[1:39:21] So say whatever you want to say to him,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; however near he may be to you tonight.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm so glad you came and
[1:39:30] ministered the way you did. So glad you
[1:39:33] spoken these things to us.
[1:39:36] Oh Lord Jesus, I would have no other
[1:39:38] desire than to tell his people about you
[1:39:41] and to admonish them and to instruct
[1:39:43] them,
[1:39:45] oh God, that they'll enter into and
[1:39:50] enter into something of a relationship
[1:39:52] and an intimacy that they've never
[1:39:55] experienced before. And may they go from
[1:39:58] this place realizing that you you have
[1:40:00] commanded us and commissioned us to seek
[1:40:03] after this habitation,
[1:40:06] this rapture habitation.
[1:40:09] Oh, this rapture realm, this rapture
[1:40:12] condition, this changing of our status
[1:40:15] and our position. And what a change it
[1:40:17] will be when we leave the status of this
[1:40:20] mortal, the status of this vile body and
[1:40:24] into the status of the immortal. Oh God,
[1:40:29] what a glorious, glorious
[1:40:32] rising and resurrection it is even now.
[1:40:36] No wonder your prophet said we're in the
[1:40:38] resurrection.
[1:40:40] We have been resurrected.
[1:40:43] Give the people understanding, I pray.
[1:40:46] and bless them immensely. I ask in the
[1:40:49] name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Who can cheer the heart like Jesus?
[1:41:05] Oh,
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; sing it out to him now.
[1:41:14] Oh, he

[1:42:36] Higher than the heaven,
[1:42:40] heaven

[1:42:44] than the deepest sea.

[1:43:43] forever and forever?
[1:43:47] Forever.
[1:43:49] Hallelujah.

[1:43:54] my king.
[1:43:56] Oh, sing it now. Oh,

[1:52:26] soul worship.
[1:52:29] Oh God. Oh God.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[1:52:39] In all holiness, oh God, in all
[1:52:42] holiness.
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:56] Oh Lord.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, we love you, Lord. We love you,
[1:53:03] Lord.
[1:53:06] There is nothing.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:20] Hallelujah.
[1:53:23] We want to be so sensitive.
[1:53:26] We want to only do what pleases him now
[1:53:30] and give him his due honor.
[1:53:35] Just release that love that's in your
[1:53:37] heart to him.
[1:53:39] Just release it. Pray the Holy Spirit
[1:53:43] just brood upon you.
[1:53:47] Just give him
[1:53:50] what is due to him.
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:54] worthy
[1:53:56] lovely one lovely Lord Jesus.
[1:54:01] I pray Lord
[1:54:04] that each person that is here
[1:54:08] has participated in this service tonight
[1:54:10] has sat listened.
[1:54:14] Pray that you will increase I ask that
[1:54:16] you will increase
[1:54:19] the desire and the hunger. Oh God, let
[1:54:22] our thirst become so great until it is a
[1:54:26] pain within us. As your prophet said,
[1:54:29] the thirst can be a painful experience.
[1:54:32] Oh God, that we thirst after you. We
[1:54:36] long after you.
[1:54:39] It is, oh God, that our soul, our soul
[1:54:43] just cries out after you, oh God. And I
[1:54:47] pray this will be our experience.
[1:54:50] Let it be a quickened experience in the
[1:54:52] coming days. Oh, Holy Spirit, don't let
[1:54:55] the people be forgetful.
[1:54:57] Don't let the enemy take it out of their
[1:54:59] minds and out of their thoughts. But may
[1:55:02] they meditate upon it day and night, oh
[1:55:04] God.
[1:55:06] And oh God, may they say when they rise
[1:55:09] in the morning and throughout the day, I
[1:55:10] shall seek after your habitation. I
[1:55:13] shall seek after that secret chamber. I
[1:55:16] shall seek after that place that you
[1:55:18] have desired for me to enter into that I
[1:55:22] might have this continual relationship
[1:55:25] with you, oh Lord, my savior, my God,
[1:55:29] my bridegroom, and my husband.
[1:55:33] Ask you Lord
[1:55:36] that you'll please go with the people
[1:55:40] and as they meet and greet one another,
[1:55:43] may there be such a a a spirit, Lord,
[1:55:48] that flows from heart to heart, from one
[1:55:52] life to the other. There's someone weak
[1:55:56] tonight.
[1:55:58] There's someone, oh God, that Satan is
[1:56:00] trying to blockade and hinder.
[1:56:03] We deny and stand as a body of Christ.
[1:56:07] Jesus speak oh God through your church
[1:56:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus. And may
[1:56:15] they be delivered and set free by the
[1:56:19] power of Christ.
[1:56:21] Nothing to do of man but by the power of
[1:56:24] the Holy Spirit. For whom the sun sets
[1:56:28] free is free indeed. And oh God, may the
[1:56:32] people live and walk in the liberty that
[1:56:36] you have purchased for them.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Bless the visitors that are with us
[1:56:40] tonight, Lord. Perhaps strange things
[1:56:43] they've heard, but let it ring true in
[1:56:45] their heart. And may there be a yay and
[1:56:48] amen, saying, "Well, your word is
[1:56:50] truth."
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Father, dismiss us and go with us and
[1:56:55] watch over each of us. protect us, I
[1:56:58] pray.
[1:57:00] And above all things,
[1:57:02] let us move into that rapture realm,
[1:57:06] that whole position, oh God, that you
[1:57:09] have for us. In the name of Jesus
[1:57:12] Christ, send us from this place happy
[1:57:16] and solemn
[1:57:19] and quiet and relaxed and at peace
[1:57:25] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:32] God bless you. It's all I can say. God
[1:57:35] bless you. be fruitful
[1:57:38] in this great kingdom of God that he's
[1:57:41] called you into. Hallelujah.
[1:57:45] You're a blessed people.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Not many people have this message
[1:57:50] that God has sent to us in this day. We
[1:57:52] thank God for it. Amen. Happy to have
[1:57:56] brother DJ back.
[1:57:59] You're bringing us greetings from Congo.
[1:58:02] Why don't you come and just give the
[1:58:04] people greetings and before we shake
[1:58:07] hands and go from here? Brother Dia
[1:58:10] couldn't get out, you know, for a few
[1:58:11] days and we're happy he was able to get
[1:58:13] out. God bless you. Looks like he lost a
[1:58:17] little bit of weight, too.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; That's that's a compliment.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:58:27] I heard some of you been praying for us.
[1:58:30] The situation was a bit tense, but the
[1:58:32] Lord was with us. Um, some people lost
[1:58:35] their lives and so on, but God saw his
[1:58:38] children through and we think things are
[1:58:40] going to actually settle down um for the
[1:58:42] best and it's good to be here. God bless
[1:58:45] you and I guess that's it. Greetings
[1:58:48] from everybody to all the saints here,
[1:58:51] especially to brother Bisco, from
[1:58:54] brother Kumbi. I had a chance to be with
[1:58:57] him and speak for him and also brother
[1:58:59] Dioa they send the love and uh they both
[1:59:03] told me to tell everybody that u they
[1:59:06] truly love you. So they are looking
[1:59:08] forward to you coming back to see them.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; That's why you were there.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Well it's it's not quite the same. So uh
[1:59:18] they did do a lot of printings at
[1:59:20] Shakana publication since the beginning
[1:59:23] of the year uh since January actually to
[1:59:26] when I was there they just finished
[1:59:28] about close to 2 million books. I was
[1:59:30] able to get some sample that uh praise
[1:59:32] the Lord to display this.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] Amen.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And um brother Dio has
[1:59:44] determined I think to have the whole
[1:59:46] message printed in another two to three
[1:59:48] years he has the translator working
[1:59:52] basically day and night. I had a meeting
[1:59:53] with all of them and uh they tell me
[1:59:56] that he doesn't even allow them vacation
[1:59:58] time and his uh his quote is that the
[2:00:01] message is urgent while they come under
[2:00:04] the burden of the pastor and amen they
[2:00:06] seem to be willing to work that way.
[2:00:09] Please remember them in prayer and
[2:00:10] because they do depend on those prayers.
[2:00:13] God bless you. Thank you.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother DJ. God bless you.
[2:00:16] Amen.
