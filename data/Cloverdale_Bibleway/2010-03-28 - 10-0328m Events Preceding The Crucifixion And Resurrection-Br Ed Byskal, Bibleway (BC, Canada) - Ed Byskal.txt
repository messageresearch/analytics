========================================
[Music] [Music] Give me Jesus. You can have all this world, but give me Jesus. When I am in prayer, when I am afraid, when I am free, give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. [Music] When I am in prayer, oh Lord, when I am in prayer, when I am in prayer, give me peace. Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus.

Whether we're in prayer, whether we're afraid, whether we're doing well, whether on the mountaintop or in the valley, give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together and sing that chorus. Jesus, draw me close. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, draw me close. [Music] Lost the Lord to you. All that is world around me that way. [Music] Jesus draw me [Music] so much closer to you. For I desire to worship and away [Music] Jesus draw me close [Music] to you. this world around me. Let it fade away. Oh Jesus, draw me home [Music] to you. For I desire to worship and obey your father of grace, seated on your throne of grace. And only by your mercy we are saved. [Music] Lord, you have said that it will fall upon your name. We are we [Music] [Music] Jesus. Heat. Heat. [Music] round in praise. Lord Jesus Christ [Music] all seated on your throne of grace. It's only by your mercy we are saved. [Music] You have said if we call upon your name we and our families would be saved. Oh, we [Music] Glory and Tonight [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] And I praise Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] He the pearly gates will all so that I may enter in [Music] all he purchase my redemption. and for me. [Music] [Music] Glory [Music] might [Music] be my sin. What a promise. Let's sing it together. [Music] He will all [Music] [Music] purchase my redemption and glory. give me all my sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a promise. Amen. That he himself will open those pearly gates. He's already made a way for us. He's already opened the gates through his blood. Amen. This morning, let's sing He has forgiven me. And we have a few prayer requests we're going to take before the Lord and ask brother Tom to come take that. Uh first, an announcement. Um, a baby announcement. Brother Andrew and Sister Natasha Hoyer are happy to announce the arrival of their baby boy. William, born March 25th at 1:00 a.m., weighing 9 lb 11 oz. Mother, baby, and family are doing great. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Each one is a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one is a miracle. Amen. Uh prayer requests. Please pray for my sister-in-law Linda Butler. She is in hospital in Oklahoma with heart trouble and kidney shutting down. That's sister from sister Leverne Clemens. Also, please pray for brother Levi Drake. He's at home sick with a stomach ailment. And also prayer request for Sunday morning for Sister Rosemary, a cousin to Sister Angela Michel in Switzerland. She was healed of lung cancer three years ago. She is having a scan on Monday because of a possible brain tumor. She knows the church will be praying for. You know, we have and and she has had cancer before and God's healed her. And we've stared that enemy square in the face and watched them be defeated. &gt;&gt; We don't fear cancer this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. He has forgiven me. As we go to prayer, he has for me. My sins have been washed from his memory. By the blood of the lamb at Calary. He has forgiven me. Amen. Let's pray. [Music] What a powerful statement, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, to know that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. &gt;&gt; And we can testify this morning. There is power in the blood, power in your word, power in this message, power in the presence of Jesus Christ. There is still wonder working power this morning as the church of the living God binds their hearts together. For we know in the scripture it's declared, "Whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, so the church of God binds this demon of cancer." Lord, that our sister be free, never to be afflicted again. How I heard your prophet say, "Sister, do you believe me that if I pray, it will never bother you again?" And in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, you banish that demon. And this morning, the church of the living God stands in her position, binding that devil, nor loosing her from this demon I called cancer. And so, Lord, those that are needy this morning, may we bind our hearts together. May we agree together. May we bind the devil together. And may the church of the living God walk in their freedom and liberty where in Christ has set us free this morning. Lord, we love you with a great love. And it it just seems as you show yourself more, we want to see more. We love you more. We want more of Christ. We want more of your love. We want more of your nature. We want more of you, Lord. And and so Lord, as we've come to the house of God to be fortified, to be strengthened, to be fed from the master's table, would you anoint the servant of the living God this morning? Lord God, may you open our ears to hear. And may Lord Jesus, that word become flesh within our lives. How we love the presence of God and to see the redeemed gathered this morning. those that are on the hookup this morning, internet, Lord, phone, whatever it be, that you will minister to them as you're already ministering to us here this morning. And so thankful for the blood this morning that forgives, cleans, washes, and builds up within the faith of the hearts of your people. Bless us now, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. Before we're seated, let's sing that chorus. I bless your name. I bless your name. I just want to worship him this morning. &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy of our praise? &gt;&gt; He's done so so many wonderful things for us. It's so easy for us to close our eyes and raise our hands and say, "I bless your name." [Music] &gt;&gt; I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] I give you all to give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Some midnight hour. Some midnight hour. If you should find that you're in a prison in your mind. Reach out and pray [Music] and they will fall [Music] in Jesus name. Lord I bless your name. We bless your name this morning Lord Jesus. You're worthy my praise this morning. I give you all to give you praise. You are the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you love one another? &gt;&gt; You can't love him without loving one another. Turn around and welcome someone to the service this morning. Shake their hand as you take your seats this morning. Like to welcome those on the internet that are streaming and connected. I know what it's like to be out on the other end. So, it's it's wonderful. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that song. The great emancipator. Aren't you glad that he set you free? &gt;&gt; The part I like about this song, you know, it said he set me free to worship him. &gt;&gt; He didn't set me free to be a bump on a log. He set me free to worship him. &gt;&gt; Set me free from my complexes. You know, I grew up I was the one that was very meek, timid, sat in the corner, didn't want to be noticed. And then I got saved. And you know, I tried to still be that quiet guy sitting in the corner, but there's just that that fountain pushing up from within that you've just got to say, "Glory, hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it together. [Music] Once my heart is over [Music] by the body and Yeah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] This is my [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] You have to free I was all the shy. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] That's the song. Glory. Hallelujah. [Music] the rain. That's the song of God. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for setting us free this morning. We worship you, Lord Jesus. You're worthy of our praise and glory this morning, Lord Jesus. We desire, Lord Jesus, that you'd come among us. Father, speak to our hearts this morning. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord Jesus, for your great love wherein you've loved us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. through the fire. He never promised that the cross would not be heavy and the hill will not be hard to find. [Music] He never victory will always come. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the atmosphere [Music] [Music] He had promised that the cross would not be [Music] always stand. [Music] Yeah. Heat. everything [Music] and he will take you to the [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus. Hallelujah. Jesus. Amen. He'll take you through the fire again. Has he one time taken you through the fire before? &gt;&gt; If he's ever one time taken you through the fire, he's going to take you through the fire again. So just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary say [Music] that he will take you to the fire again. He never promised. He had a promise that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to [Music] heed in the valley And the adversary say [Music] and he will take you to the high again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. As we turn the service to brother Ed this morning to hear the word this morning, my hope is in the Lord &gt;&gt; from this time on. &gt;&gt; For how long? &gt;&gt; Forever. &gt;&gt; Forever more. Amen. [Music] I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. [Music] In whom the wisdom of the angels lies. For whom the rage of the sea subacri [Music] [Applause] You s my [Music] forever. Ever stand the mercies come with every rising sun to be the sinner in his brokenness [Music] to offer healing and And those who trust you trust in him this morning is is in the Lord forever more. His tender mercies tender mercies come with every rising sun to be the sinner in his brokenness [Music] to offer him morning for those who trust in My heart is [Music] glory. [Music] My heart is my [Music] [Music] forever. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His tender mercies rise with every rising sun. Amen. Amen. Let's just take it down a little bit as we turn the service to brother Ed and sing that chorus. When Jesus comes, the tempter's power is broken. You know, I love that song. It's a simple song, but when Jesus comes, whatever it is this morning, the tempter's power is broken. &gt;&gt; There's no demon can stand in his presence. And we know when the word goes forth, it casts out demons. &gt;&gt; We know that. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together as we turn it over to brother Ed this morning. When Jesus comes, the tempter's power is broken. When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped away. [Music] He takes the earth and fills the life with glory. For all is when Jesus comes to save. Oh, when Jesus comes, the temp is broken. When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped away. [Music] He takes the world and fills the life with glory for all his name. When Jesus comes to &gt;&gt; I'm sure everyone here can say all has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He made such a change in us. Amen. Going to invite you just to have your seats for another few moments. Want to greet you all and uh in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's uh wonderful to see everyone here and uh some that are visiting. I see Sister Natasha Hoyer's mom here. God bless you. So nice to see them. Brother Andrew's parents are here and they've welcomed this uh new grandbaby. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think the school should get ready the size of this child. I think he could go into grade two. Uh and uh we'll Lord willing be dedicating some some of these new children that have just come. Those that have had babies recently were we're happy for that. What what a wonderful marvelous thing that children can be birthed into these kind of homes. &gt;&gt; So wonderful. God bless you. see those you from up Tacoma and Seattle, those that are streaming the services today and we're going to be speaking directly to them as well as directly to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's uh we we weren't having a young people's meeting for some time. Actually we merged and had uh young people's meeting uh young people gathering also with those that were gathering for prayer on Friday night and and uh and then there were time during the uh for some time that we didn't have young people's and then the young people's I don't it you know it's it's mostly brother John Andes and brother Tom they've directed uh those affairs and more brother John and and uh we've worked closely together. But anyway, they decided to give me an envelope with with all kinds of letters and notes from all the young people. So, I'll say to you young people, it has a has a real impact. I'm happy to hear that you're the one that wants to see the meetings happening and not not necessarily parents saying my young people need to go to young people's, but the young people are saying we want to have the services. And I just thought uh I just happened to open my Bible and I had one uh one note there and it said uh said this that they want to thank you for all the young people for on behalf of the young people young people's on Friday nights has been a tremendous blessing for me uh on those weeks when Satan pulls you down. I would imagine as most every week uh so much at school and with so much homework and pressure and you feel like you can't go on. Young people has been the light at the end of my tunnel. Amen. It's brought me back into place and I and lifted I feel lifted up and so many times I couldn't more so many times that I couldn't count and uh then went on to say uh what had happened in the camp uh what God did for this one young person in camp and having a and having a confession and testimony service which they had on a Friday night here a couple weeks ago reminded me by having that confession testimony service. Uh they said it reminded me exactly of what happened and brought me back into a victorious position. It's surprising how Satan can make you forget what God did so easily. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; And uh being able to go back to what God did and confess it. help me to say boo to the devil. &gt;&gt; And it's been a victory after victory since. Praise the Lord. And we just want that to continue. And I pray that all the young people will have that kind of testimony. Uh Lord willing, we will be uh sister Biscll and myself will be with the saints in Switzerland. and brother Kim Dingwald is and sister Hedi are going to come and there might and I think brother brother Ben and uh sister Beth are going to be with their family as well. Um, we'd like you to remember these meetings and if they will put this slide on the uh this announcement so that all of you that are streaming the service will be sure to if you're any part of Europe or any part of of uh uh even Eastern Europe, you can come to these meetings and we have on the screen there uh brother Daniel Cullenbrunner's name and the contact number for him also brother David Mayor's name and his contact numbers and you'll be able to uh contact them by phone uh register there's a very very fine uh it's a a campus convention center in Cersei uh Switzerland and it's a very fine facility and so we're we're encouraging any and all who can come to this meeting because many are scattered throughout Europe and not able to get to uh meetings on a regular basis. So this will be a real time of not merely fellowship but getting around the word and exclusively giving these days to hearing the word of God. Brother brother Murphy and sister Tracy are also coming. Brother Murphy has ministered there before, has ministered also at brother Gear Rudol. And so pray for Brother Murphy and Sister Tracy because they're going to go on from this this convention. Listen friends, it's not only this congregation even though we've had a very very integral part of the work in taking place in China. Let's always remember this. It's God who does the work. It's the Holy Spirit that has breathed upon. It's the Holy Spirit that gives supernatural birth to the people who have never heard, some of them perhaps never even heard the name of Jesus Christ. But what is happening there? Brother Murphy is an instrument. Brother Ivan is an instrument of God. uh brother John Lei uh who I think have just gone down to Louisiana to be down there for maybe another month or so. But brother but brother John Lei, brother John Sacker, listen God keeps a real good set of books. And you people that have gave, you people that have prayed, you people that have supported, not only here but also in the streaming congregation, I want you to know that this is an eternal work &gt;&gt; and we are going to rejoice not just these few days, weeks, months, years. We're going to rejoice throughout eternity &gt;&gt; with these people. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; You expect that with everything that's in you. And that's what encourages me and drives me on because this is a reality. Absolutely. A reality. Ken and Lind are also going to attend with us uh to the meetings in Switzerland. Uh when the people were here, they stayed at Ken and Linda's place and they just want them so badly to to come and be with them uh over there as well and and return some of the hospitality. So, we're asking you that you will pray. But as I've been praying towards the meetings in Switzerland, I became very impressed that God is going to give a special meeting here over Easter. I don't know what God is going to do, but it came so heavy on my heart. I became torn in my own my own feeling. I wanted to be here because I felt that God is going to do something of a special nature and I wanted to participate in it. So, uh maybe if the timing works out right, we'll stream the meetings ourselves and then we're going to be coming back uh back home soon uh after the meetings. So, that uh is something we ask you to pray about. Now, I have a a a special announcement. We're glad for all of you that are here and sorry for those that are not here. I talked to a couple that weren't able to be here this morning. They wanted to be here and circumstances just prevented it. But we have been anticipating and working towards uh we won't put it up yet, please. uh towards a new school building and we've been working in that direction for many months. There has been a great deal of work done uh towards this project over a period of a lot of months but the trustees of the church uh recently made a decision to go forward with the new uh school building. Now some details still have to be worked out uh at this time. Uh and then the commencement of the construction would be subject to these being worked out and those are uh number one would be the financing of phase one. Uh but application has been made since the trustees made the decision. application has been made to our bank and they have looked very favorable uh and have responded already. They look very favorable about uh towards giving us what would be necessary to uh complete phase one. Uh the second thing would be the contract uh to construct it and we have met with uh contractors and brother Kim Dingwall uh about a year ago also had some quotes but we are having those being revisited and also some new contractors are are being uh have have spoken to us and we are in the process of receiving revised bids. uh this is being worked on right now. The architectural plans have been completed and and it's quite costly to have that done and God moved on our behalf and we actually had the architectural plans done for about half of the cost of having them done. And and and and for spiritual Jews, that's a good way to do things. We really appreciate doing things that but God just puts it on the hearts of people and uh uh these plans are very very extensive. The city of Suriri require every last thing. I mean even to the type of trees that are planted out in front. You can't plant just what you want. They have the species of the tree and if one tree isn't exactly what they want, if you have something there that isn't what they want, they'll have you pull that up and put another tree there. So the but that they are finished and the city of Siri are now prepared to give us a building permit &gt;&gt; and that is a huge that takes over a year has taken over a year to work with them. Brother brother brother Kim Dingwal has has had a good deal of experience with engineering. So he has done a lot of the engineering, electrical engineering and the other mechanical engineering on the plans and that was you know free gratus as I say brother Kim donated his time to do that and if you were to see the plans it would be uh it would be something to behold. Um, I think maybe what we'll do is just show the slide and perhaps uh, Brother Kim could address the slides because he put these together. Uh, we could have the first one. All right. This is the construction. Brother Kim, do you want to come and and uh, perhaps just speak towards the slide themselves? &gt;&gt; This is the uh, building design that we have. And if you look at what what that view is that you see is if you would come in off 60th Avenue on the entrance from 60th Avenue, that's what you'd see. That's the end of the school building. The school has nine classrooms. It has a library, uh a computer lab, a science lab, a gymnasium, and a kitchen. So, it has we've been working constantly with the teachers and parents to try and get everything in there that we need to have. And uh the building is a concrete and steel building. It's uh it's got sprinklers. It's seismic rated. It's a computer controlled. It's energy efficient. And it's a little over 29,000 square ft, which is actually bigger than this building. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Bigger than all of this building. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you added up everything in this building, and it's about 25,000. Next slide. So, on the first level, we have the uh gymnasium. Um on your left side is the gymnasium, which could also be used for functions. It seats probably just over 500 people. Then we have the primary classes, the grades one and two and kindergarten and preschool on the main level in the kitchen and admin and reception areas on the main floor. The next floor please. And then uh on the upper floor we have the the uh elementary grades 3, four, five, and six and the junior high which is seven and eight and grade nine and a library on that upper floor. And next year, am I okay, am I okay to say this, brother Terry, that you've added grade 10 for next year? Yeah. So, next year there will be grade 10 and the plan is for the following year, grade 11, and then grade 12. So that if your children are in this school, they can just stay there till they're done school. U the next slide is uh down in the basement is the science lab, the computer lab, and the grade 10, 11, 12s in the downstairs. And uh full washrooms with showers. Um I don't know for you who have this is probably the place to say this but you know if you've had a bunch of boys in fizzed and then coming back to the class it's really nice that there showers before they get back. So the the school has that. So it's it really has all the facilities that that we need to be able to have a K to2 school. So that's the building. Thanks. [Applause] [Music] I'll say that the uh school has been and continues to be a tremendous benefit and blessing to us as a body of believers and to those that have been able to uh send their children. But now it'll be able to have children from kindergarten through to grade 12. Uh I am personally committed to seeing the school extended from K to 12. Now it is entirely possible and within our grasp to complete this project. It is possible and uh we must not let this opportunity slip away from us or surrender up our rights to have our children in a holy ghost atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's the way I feel about it. Uh we need to look inward each of us and uh see how God has led us. I think the school has been is it 16 years brother Terry? 16 years in its 16th year uh and then move forward from that call or from that vision. I don't think God changes his mind about his vision. &gt;&gt; Uh and we we look towards that leadership of the Holy Spirit for the decisions which still stand before the school board, the church trustees and the directors of Cloverdale Bible Way. But we have never in all of our years put the church under a undue financial strain. I believe that if we give as God leads us, as we uh make our decisions as God lead us and and families and and those that are do not have children uh can also participate. I I'd like to say something about volunteers. The seats you're sitting on were assembled by volunteers. These just came like a mechanical set from California with the ends and the sides and the backs and bags of screws and all of these things. And the brothers who are here and brothers and sisters who are in Living Word Fellowship, they uh we together assembled this so we could have seats such as you have. the uh you look to the ceiling and you see uh you know that was not a simple ceiling and we were not expert or skilled necessarily but we learned as we went and had a huge huge structure in here that went up uh you know it's almost 28 30 ft up there and uh we're cutting the drywall uh and and uh this entire building school offices everything was done by the brothers. We volunteered and did that work. It was a wonderful way to do it when men were finished work of their normal work day, whether they got off at 3:00 or 4:00 or 5:00. Now, those of you that were active uh in this project, you know, but there are many who are here that were not, and those that are also streaming, but they came here when they were finished their work uh and worked till uh supper time. The sisters came in and had a hot meal. We w we ate for 30 minutes and we felt that was enough time and went back to our job. And then when the person had to go whether they had to go at 8 or 9 or 10, the the last person we could work no longer beyond 11:00 and that's when everyone left. But then the next day when the uh individuals came back, the men sisters, we went right back to the same place that we left off the evening before and we worked about 3 to four months here and and completed the inter interior of this building, the Sunday school rooms, a fellowship room. And uh and you know what? When it was over, everybody was sad. They said, "We have so enjoyed being together. We've so enjoyed working together because believe it or not, you get to know people at a at a different level than you do just coming to church. And it was really a wonderful time. So I'd like to say about the the volunteers that uh uh what was done here was so so much. I mean not only the drywall we did the painting and the doors and hanging the doors and the landscaping outside. uh there was brothers who handled big heavy equipment and dug trenches outside and uh uh so many things were took place and I'd like to say to this congregation and those that are listening because I don't want you to have tunnel vision you don't need to have children to see the great benefit to the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in raising our children for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. families with or without children, grandparents, unmarried, uh single young people, you can all have a part uh in this what I think is a marvelous, marvelous work. Now, there are many or there may well be some who are even streaming the service. I speak to the streaming congregation because my vision is not just local here, but they they there are some who are streaming that no doubt would like to come and even give a couple weeks of their time in this beautiful Pacific Northwest and uh contribute their time to helping to build the school. Uh could the congregation here say amen? So we invite you in the name of Jesus Christ. You know, we just bought the camp a couple years ago. Probably something that none of you know, and so this will be an announcement for the first time. When the Baptist convention, they call the Baptist Convention, wanted to get the campground ready to sell, they had it, they had allowed it to deteriorate so much, so they needed workers to come in. They had eight workers that came in and and and there's all kinds of Baptists, thousands of them here in this area. Do you know where those eight workers came from? Texas. They all came from Texas. And they went through and worked. To them, it was a missionary project. They were going to the hinterlands of America up into Washington State and do missionary work amongst the natives. and we're so happy they did it because we benefited from everything they did. So that was fine. Uh do you know that there are there are some religious communities I won't mention them by name because it goes on the internet but there are some religious groups who have uh uh churches in this area and they call in people from all over the world and they will build a church in a week time. you would hardly believe, but they've got skilled people and they call those people in and they've got everything scheduled and they pour the cement and they've got walls going up. They the thing is it's it's it's I've I've actually seen I've actually watched and observed and day after day you wouldn't believe it. You see cement one day and about 3 4 days later they're putting shingles on the roof and I I can't say it's completely finished inside but they will assemble and put up a building in a week's time and they have men crawling like ants over that thing. Don't tell me that we can't do something. &gt;&gt; I believe that there are many here. Now there are some hurdles. Just give me a moment. You may we have a very very unique situation. We have uh a lot of our congregation on the US side and I have spoken to uh brother brother Terry the principal and uh the uh school board is well aware there are some hurdles that they need to overcome and I think that if they if they really applied themselves one is to have students that are say in the eastern part of the valley and at the US border And they just recently a 15 passenger bus has been donated to the church as brother Milco and and a partner that's working with him who has come here to church on a couple of occasions. God is dealing with him. But they gave this very very nice 15 passenger Ford bus to the school and so they will be able to pick up students where whichever route they give it. But if it's to go to Abbottzford because we got people that are maybe in eastern part of the valley that would like to send their children. In some cases the wife doesn't drive and the husband is at work. We'd be able to overcome that kind of a hurdle. The other is we they would need one or two uh buses at least to pick up children at the border providing something can be worked out where they can be pulled there and brought to church and take back. There are some of those things which need to be addressed. But I feel that that the school board needs to really apply themselves to those things. Another thing is sponsorship. You know, I'm I'm not here to uh uh I'm not here to Sister Biscll and I we don't have we don't have children or grandchildren in in school, but I am very very burdened for the school. And we have tried to uh sponsor children. We like to sponsor children. Children that have nothing to do with our family, but I just see, you know, I see different ones and and maybe they struggle or their parents are struggling and we like to see them sponsored. But I just said to and I want to say this publicly, I have never been approached and said, "Would you like to sponsor a child?" Of course, we sponsored children for probably the last 10 years, but I've never been approached. Would you like to sponsor a child? And and and I'm sure if I haven't been approached, you haven't been approached. I think that the school board the reason I'm saying this is because if it happens, you can blame me. But I think they need to appoint a brother, a real swave brother. In fact, as I kind of button one the other day, you know, kind of swave diplomatic type of brother to go and approach and and and talk to the people. Do you know what? It's not even sponsoring a child. I think they should have a I think they should have a sponsorship fund in case some want to come. I'm saying more about this than I had intended to. So, this isn't part of the message, but it leading into it. Is this all right? &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak about the school like this, but I think that it's it's uh it's uh to have a sponsorship fund. There might be a single person that's not even married yet says, "Hey, I plan to get married. I plan to have kids. I hope somebody does this for me. I've got a few extra dollars. I'd like to pay something every month into a sponsorship fund. Maybe the school doesn't need any sponsorship this year, but they might might well need it next year. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about things. Don't don't don't don't necessarily be quiet on me because I haven't I haven't I'm going to start to preach this in a minute. &gt;&gt; The trustees and school board representative was there and they all were having meetings. Then they talked about, well, there's there's a possibility way out here someplace that that someone might even want to send a child that would be boarded out. And that sounded really kind of way out there someplace. Somebody sent a child to be boarded out. I let them just talk. And at the end of the meeting, I said, "Like to just say something. You are looking at a boarded out child." I was boarded out in grade four. I think I spent a little time with my parents in grade five. Then I was boarded out in grade six. I was boarded out in grade seven. I was boarded out part of in grade eight where I had to walk four miles to school and go in the dark and come home in the dark. had to water the horses before I went to school and come back in the dark and make sure there was wood and everything for and this and this couple didn't have any children. They had never known what a having a a child was. And that's where I was for 4 months. I wanted to go and see my sister and there was snow and I had to walk. I had to walk nine miles to catch the mailman. You know what? It didn't hurt us. It didn't hurt me. I lived. I survived. But you know, we get too comfortable. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to use a word that brother Randy Snow uses. He says, "You know what's problem with our church, brother Ed?" He said, "They're spoiled. We're spoiled. Everything comes too easy. We just come in and it's all done and it's all fixed and sitting on seats." But somebody labored to put these seats together. Somebody screwed them all together and we struggled and we did all these things. Now maybe it's our turn. Maybe it's a turn for some that didn't have an opportunity. And I can tell you it'll be a blessing. &gt;&gt; It'll be a great blessing for you. And you don't have to be skilled. You don't have to be, you know, uh have some great doctorate or anything. A person just does it. Do you know that we have people right now in China who want to send their children here to come to this? They can't come, but they want to send their children here and be educated in this environment. Can you imagine because they're streaming they'll see perhaps this service says can we send our children they've been after brother Murphy to figure out some way and someplace where they can stay and I know that there's people that that are not able to be here but they would love to have their children here. So, I don't know how that might work out, but I can tell you I may not be around to see it, but if the Lord Jesus doesn't receive us out of this place, I will tell you that I believe that that school will be looking for more space. &gt;&gt; It'll hold about 225 students and that's that'll be about it. It's the only and I'm closing now. It's the only one of just a handful in all of North America. Over 350 million people and a few believers, but it's only one of a few in North America and it's the only one that I know of in Canada. Now, I know that some of you mothers and fathers, you homeschool your children, and I admire you for that. I think that you mothers that do that, it's a it's a sacrifice. It's a masterful job. But if if it were me and it just that's just a matter of priority now. So just a matter of priorities. Some may say, well, I I can't afford to have my children in the in the school or there are some hurdles. But if your child is put in an environment where their ears are hearing cursing and foul language and dirty jokes, what is it worth for them not to have that? Or if your child should end up doing and being something that you really would you you'd be willing to pay anything. Say, well, they got afflicted. They got influenced by the group that go to the mall or go here or go there. What would you pay then to have them under this kind of what would you pay then to have them here? That's what I think for myself that's what school is all about. And there's no guarantee they could come to Bible way Christian Academy and end up to be real or rangutangs. I don't know. There's no guarantee. But I know one thing as a father, as a parent, as a as a believer, I would like to do everything I could to see they have the right kind of atmosphere and the right kind of upbringing. And we've done everything that we could train a child in the way they should go. And uh when I was thinking of the prodal son and the father, I tell you what, the father, he never lost his confidence. He'd raised that son the way that he should be. And he came back after he ate enough of the out of the swine pen and uh all that riotous living he began to think my even my father's servants are better off because he had the right kind of upbringing in father's home. So &gt;&gt; so much said &gt;&gt; God bless you. And that's my thoughts on uh and I said maybe more than I I should say but I'm not sorry for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, I'd like to just sing a song. Uh we're we're coming up now to the the uh week prior to the crucifixion and the death and the burial of Jesus Christ. And so I want to have your thoughts in that direction. I'd like to, brother Ryan, if we could just sing. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you want to hear more? [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. God's going to do the supernatural for us. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes. He'll do the supernatural for us. Let's just stand as we sing it. He was wounded for our transgressions. [Music] For our transgressions he will bruise for our iniquity. [Music] and surely bore our sorrow and by his stripes we are healed. Let us enter into a spirit of worship as we sing it once again. He was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquity [Music] and surely bore all our sorrow and by his stripes we are healed. [Music] We have a wonderful savior. I've had a wonderful upbringing and God has allowed me to be influenced by some wonderful people. And uh while I just spoke about the school, I was reminded while we were singing and I I I would like to just uh give a just give a compliment to my father-in-law, my wife's dad. I never had the privilege of baptizing him, but seven years before he went to be with the Lord, he u had he told us that he had given his life to Jesus Christ and uh he lived up north and we never had an opportunity to baptize him. Our Lord Jesus was mindful of him when he was hanging between life and death and spoke through a prophet with my wife standing in the shadows at outside a motel. And he just turned to her while we were greeting one another and saying farewell. He just turned to her said, "Sister Biscll, your father will be all right." And he was hanging with a massive heart attack. And God, it wasn't the healing that we were interested in. It was his spiritual life and we accepted it as he will be all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. When that is spoken out of the mouth of a prophet, that's how we take it. A person isn't all right if they're just healed. That's not all right. They're all right when they're all right when they're born again. And we wanted to ask him about that. But when he passed away, now he was had grandchildren. The grandchildren are all married. He has great grandchildren. But when he passed away, he had in his will listed eight children that were in far away countries. One was in Greece, some down in the Caribbean islands and places of poverty. And he'd been he'd been unbeknown to us, he'd been paying for these children education. And one of the requirements of the will that these children must be continued to be paid for until they are through college. And I tell you, God sees that kind of a request. Doesn't go up on the rooftop and and blaring it out. But God sees that kind of a request. And I think it's important for us to have a heart towards other people less fortunate than we are. I'll have you turn in your Bible, please, to John the 12th chapter. Thank you for giving me this little extra time. This is a special week. We're moving up towards uh what the world will call Easter. And uh this this week was full of events. I want to relate and refer to some of these events and I want to speak to you on this subject events preceding the crucifixion and resurrection. May God help us now. We'll be reading from John 12. Just before we read, I would like to have you pray with me. Oh father, what a time we are remembering at this hour. Lord, we're thinking of the week prior to the suffering and the judgment and the death and the burial and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and the life that he lived before us in such a short span of time. We see that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. And now I pray father that we will be let us be overwhelmed at the uh at at the life that was presented and the the express image of the invisible God and the attributes. Oh Lord, I pray that you will take this service now and let my lips speak, oh God, the words that will ignite the thoughts in the hearts and souls of the people in Jesus Christ's name. I give myself entirely to you and to be an instrument in your hand. And may the people, dear Lord, be anointed by the Holy Spirit to receive in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people would say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Starting with John the 12th chapter, first verse, we'll read. Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, if you'll notice that, please. 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus uh was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. Then seth one of the disciples, Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, which should betray him. Why was not this ointment sold for 300 p, and given to the poor? This, he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein. Down to the 12th verse. On the next day, much people, I would like you to notice it was the next day. First, it was 6 days prior. So, now we're into the fifth day prior to the Passover. Much people that were come to the feast, they were already gathering. See? And when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, "Hosana, blessed is the king of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord." And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon, as it is written, fear not, daughter of Zion. Daughter of Zion is Jerusalem. Behold, thy king cometh sitting on an ass's colt. I'd like to read out of Matthew 21 and verse 8. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and strobed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before and that followed. So he was completely surrounded. Multitudes before him and multitudes that followed. They were all crying. And they cried, saying, "Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest." And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?" &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Just let you get settled. It's amazing week. &gt;&gt; No week like it in history. Ever. Ever. &gt;&gt; In a few days, paradise is going to be emptied. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a few days, &gt;&gt; paradise is actually going to be emptied. &gt;&gt; In a few days, a resurrection is going to take place. In a few days, the dead are going to be walking through the streets of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; In a few days, but there's these people are completely unaware of it. They are, for whatever reason, they are enthused. They're excited over this prophet from Nazareth. And who is this? They said, "This is Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet of Nazareth." They hadn't quite got the full revelation that he was the son of God. They hadn't got that revelation. They didn't have a revelation yet that he's the redeemer. They didn't realize that in a few days from their crying, "Hosana, hosana in the highest." This one is going to be hanging on a cross with spit hanging on his beard on his face and with the very beard torn out from him. and sitting and standing there bleeding and his ribs showing and marred more than that of any man. His visage, the scripture says, marred more than that of any man. In a few days, the justice of almighty God is going to come down in all of the wrath of of that sin could produce upon this one man, this body, this redeemer, this savior. They didn't realize it, but the scripture was being fulfilled. And brother Brandham in the in the message, what is the attraction on the mountain? He said there was no reason. I mean, the reason for all of this activity and this crying and the people being um moved, he said, why was that? Why was that happening? He said, because prophecy was being fulfilled. And you find people that don't even have a full revelation. They get moved by and swept into the the the whole fulfillment of it. It's like a being caught in the vortex. Something's happening. Brother Brandham even said about the uh people of his day and how they were crying out for revival and revival and crying out for revival because he said being Christians, there's something in them that tells them that that's supposed to happen, but they can't identify it when it comes. They didn't realize that in a few days, in a few days, the very earth that they were walking on was going to be redeemed and claimed by the creator. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? I'm saying this, friends. We're sitting here in 2010, but it's just as possible because we're no different than they are in the fact that we could also sit not fully realizing what is happening, &gt;&gt; what's taking place &gt;&gt; because these people, they had to, you know, fix their dinner and the mothers had to look after the children and they had the everyday things to take care of. They had to go to the well for water and all of these things and you'll go to your car and go to gas it up and get it fixed and go to your work and do this. These people had all of those things to do. So they were taken up with the natural activities of life. Not that that was bad. We need to look after those things. But we also need a special awareness that can only come by the Holy Spirit. Oh spirit of God, don't let me lose sight of the day that I'm in &gt;&gt; and this critical time that we're in. &gt;&gt; We have received a messenger from God. We have received the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Jesus, this is redeemer. He had been only on the earth for 33 years. 33 years. But to some of you, 33 years is a long time. But he had only been on the earth 33 years. But after it's passed and we look at it now, it was a very short sliver of time, a very brief period of time. And I can tell you when when eternity is and time is blended into eternity, I'll just say to everyone here, don't forget my words. Everyone that is seated here today, once you enter into eternity, and you you'll you'll scarcely know it. You'll you'll say you you'll come to a realization something has changed. Something's happened. Turn around and find that it's not time any longer. The time has come and you blended into eternity. These years that we look so long here is going to be a very brief time. Didn't say it didn't amount to anything. &gt;&gt; That trouble I went through, that trial I went through means nothing. Here I am on the other side. Glory to God. Here I am in the fullness of what God intended for me. My brother, my sister, it's worth it all. It's worth it all. It's worth every struggle. It's worth every pain. It's worth everything that we may go through. It's worth it all &gt;&gt; to serve him fervently &gt;&gt; with everything that we can. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Amen. There are seven feasts in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; that all point to Christ. &gt;&gt; And don't lose me now because this ties very directly into what I have to say. And brother Brandham in the future home message because that's I'm still there. He goes back to Leviticus 23 to speak about the eighth day. But I want to speak about all of these feasts because that lead up to it. And the Lord spake to Moses, saying, "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them concerning the feast of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these," God is speaking to Moses now. Even these are my feasts. Now when we think of a feast quickly, the definition of a feast in our terminology is a festive joyous meal. It's a a sumptuous feast of time of dining and generally friendship and fellowship and and it is a uh perhaps entertainment is associated with it. It's where many guests partake. It's a banquet that's characterized by tempting variety and abundance of foods and things. That's what generally what we think of a feast. But the word feast here is completely different. We think of a feast. We could say, well, it was a feast for it was a feast for a for our eyes or it was a it was a a feast for the soul. I was in an atmosphere. It was a feast for my soul. And I don't know exactly uh that the that terminology could have very different meaning for all of us here. Then the Bible tells us also that Abraham made a feast. He made a a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. That was a that was this kind of a feast. And then the Bible tells us also that Belshazzar had at uh in in the book of Daniel that he made a great feast. And the feast had to do with food and with wine and and all the thousand of princes that he had a thousand of his lords and he drank wine before the thousand. That was a feast. That's not the feast. That's not even what the word means. When God is speaking of the feast, speak unto the children of Israel concerning the feast of the Lord, which he shall proclaim to be holy convocations. Moses shall proclaim this to be a holy convocation. I want to say to you, I feel inspired today to say to this congregation and all who hear my voice that we have been called to a very sacred holy time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the end time. &gt;&gt; These are the last days &gt;&gt; and these days will never be repeated again. &gt;&gt; We will not walk this way again. And we're walking where we have never walked before. &gt;&gt; This is a holy time to God. &gt;&gt; And the and the scripture that's referring to feast here, the feast is and here's the full meaning of it. The feast is an appointed place, an appointed time, an appointed meeting, a sacred appointed season, or a tent, a tent of meeting, a tent, a place, a tabernacle of meeting. And God said to Moses, I'm going to give you some feasts now. And that's why he started to say on a certain day of a certain month on that day you'll commence this feast and this feast will be three days or this feast will be seven days and on the eighth day what's he talking about? He said, "This is a sacred, holy meeting, and I'm going to I'm going to meet with the people in a special way on these days and on these months and at this time because it was reflecting something to come." And the first feast was the Passover. &gt;&gt; It was a certain time. And in the initial Passover, God said to Moses, "Slay the lamb &gt;&gt; and put the blood on the doorpost and on the lentil of the door." Not next week. Tonight. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; It was at an appointed time. You do it tonight. For I'll pass over this city. I'll pass over Egypt tonight. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's an appointed time and this this next week we will remember a very special time in history. I'm not interested in the time in history. I'm interested in this week. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in this time. We we we as believers because of the events because Israel is over there as a nation and the sixth star of David is flying and they have their money and God all these scriptures have been fulfilled. He who scattered them has gathered them back &gt;&gt; and that gathering back fulfillment of that has caused my heart to burn caused every believer's heart to burn. And we watch God's time piece with eagerness to see what is the next event. What is the next thing that's going to unfold? Where are we at? I can tell you we're in a very sacred time. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to refer to some of these special times, a most sacred appointed season that soon was arriving that the Passover speaks of. And Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead. In Matthew 26 it said, "And he said, go into the city to such a man and say unto him, the master saith, my time is at hand. I will keep I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples. There had never been a meeting Passover like this one. &gt;&gt; This was one that was different. These disciples had had church all the time like we do. &gt;&gt; They were having the Passover every year like all the Jews do. They slew a lamb every year. This was something the kids have said. I remember when my daddy did this. &gt;&gt; I remember seeing my mom cook the Passover uh meat. I saw them wash it the way they're doing. Every year was exactly the same. Exactly the same. We're getting ready in a few days. We're getting ready to do it again. But this one somehow was different because Jesus said, "Go into the city and you'll find a a a man will be there and tell them my Lord needs these uh these animals and bring them to me." And so they're bringing a little colt. And they set Jesus on the colt. Somehow they were excited about it. It wasn't a camp meeting, but it was a special feeling. Something something was happening. And they decided to start to take off their coat and throw their coat down and and they put Jesus on the colt and and threw their garments on and others went and tore branches down and and screaming with excitement. You talk about emotion. Hosana. Hosana in the highest. &gt;&gt; Why? Because this was a special appointed time. &gt;&gt; This was the Passover. And God said, "These are my feasts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a time of my meeting &gt;&gt; because God was merged with humanity. &gt;&gt; But now God was taking his son &gt;&gt; to the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; What a meeting. &gt;&gt; What a meeting. &gt;&gt; My friends, you and I have come to a service this morning, a meeting in Cloverdale. Bible way. This meeting would be meaningless &gt;&gt; without that meaning. &gt;&gt; Absolutely meaningless &gt;&gt; without that meaning. Had God not met with humanity, &gt;&gt; had he not merged with the human body of Jesus Christ and took him to the cross, we would live here in vain. &gt;&gt; We live here like a bunch of worms and die meaningless lives. Oh my brother, my sister, when we're not when we're thinking about when we're thinking about Calvary, we're thinking about Easter. What a great time. It was a meeting place. &gt;&gt; It was an appointed This is the Passover feast, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; This was the appointed time. &gt;&gt; So I said that this was the most sacred season &gt;&gt; and it was six days before the Passover. the season was arriving, a most important season. And then Jesus says, "My hour, my time is at hand that I'll have the Passover at thy house with my disciples." Now this was the this was the appointed time. Jesus said, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour, &gt;&gt; not this year, but this hour. Now you see them. I want you to see the merging, the coming together, the it was a incredible uh climax as it were. And he says, "And for this cause I came to this hour. &gt;&gt; This is why I even came. This is the cause of my life &gt;&gt; is to come to this hour. I say to you in the name of the Lord, you didn't come here by an accident. You didn't come here simply because your mother and father had to have children. You were sent to this hour. You were sent to this day. You were sent to hear this message. That's your cause. That's your purpose. You may be moved from different parts of the world or the different parts of the country. You're not sitting even in this church by an accident today. You're sitting here under the mandate of Almighty God because God says, "I want a meeting with you. It's going to be a different time. This going to be a different Sunday. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It was an appointed time. It was an appointed place. And it came to pass, Luke 9:51, when when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. Now, he knows the seasons arrived. Six days before the Passover, he's telling the disciples, "Go and you'll find this colt and go to this man's place and tell him, I'm going to eat." The season had arrived. And then finally, it was the hour that arrived. I've come here for this hour. And now, now more than the hour has arrived, but my time has arrived. And the place has arrived. And he he wasn't in Jerusalem, but he set us steadfastly to go to Jerusalem because now he had to go. He was the right person. &gt;&gt; He was in the right season. It was in the right time and now he had to move to the right place. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you need to know you're in the right place. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be here by some accident. You don't want to be here simply because, well, I I know the people are nice people. That's not the reason. We got to know we're in the right place. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ask God, I want to know that I'm in the right place where my life will be have the effect that you want it to be. Where my life will touch the people you want it to touch. &gt;&gt; Is this too straight? &gt;&gt; Isn't this right? &gt;&gt; And he came and he set his face uh steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. There was no way that they could change that. And then it was a meeting place also. It was the appointed place. The feast of the Passover is a tent of meeting. A tent of meeting. God had said to Moses regarding the tabernacle. The tabernacle was called the tent of the congregation, the tent of meeting. Because a a tent is a tent, listen now, a tent is something that you set down, you drive some stakes, and then you pull it up and move it. &gt;&gt; And the tabernacle in the Old Testament, the pillar of fire was over it. And while the pillar of fire stayed over it, it stayed there. But as soon as the pillar of fire began to move, the people said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; gather the pans and get the kids on the camels, and we're on our way. Why? Because I saw the word &gt;&gt; word moving. And when the word moved, the priests were to move behind it. And when the priests move, the congregation were supposed to move with it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You see what I'm saying? God has an order, a divine order. &gt;&gt; And now this was a special meeting place. This, he said it was a tent. Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished. It was a transient place. The congregation, the tent of the congregation was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses. So did they. And the Bible tells us the Apostle Paul, first church age messenger in 2 Corinthians 5:19 to that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. God finally had a special meeting place and that meeting place that God was in Christ. They there was a merging together. The eternal God met in Jesus Christ as at a special meeting. Oh, God was in Christ. God had spoken earlier and said, "This is my beloved son." As Jesus came out of the water being baptized, "This is my beloved son that uh in whom I'm well pleased." On the mount of transfiguration, um Matthew 17, uh this is my beloved son. hear him. &gt;&gt; Those were special meeting places, but there the world had never seen and will never see this day &gt;&gt; where God was in Christ and took his son to the sacrifice of Calvary. God had completely merged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I could say so many things. That is why Jesus could say my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed. He had to come now to the tent the meeting. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a in a water baptism message he changed his cast. &gt;&gt; Amen. from God to man and came down was born of a virgin Mary. And the Holy Ghost, which is God his father, that overshadowed it, came down and spread his tent and dwelt with us in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; God spread his tent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the tent moved about. &gt;&gt; The tent moved from place to place. When you have a tent, it is a it's a place where you'll maybe have your meal and perhaps sleep the night and then you'll pull up the stakes and move to another place. God brought you here. [Music] &gt;&gt; You are God's tent. &gt;&gt; The tent called Jesus Christ has gone, but you are God's tent. In 2010, you are God's tent. This Easter, don't forget God has come to a meeting place. &gt;&gt; And he sent Elijah to call you. He sent a message to get you, to let you know that he now was merging with you, &gt;&gt; word in flesh. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you just had a he you he had a a a camp. That's what even camp is all about. That's what these meetings are all about. Is so that God can anchor himself and that this meeting becomes more intense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can tell you how intense Jesus finally with his disciples, he's moving in this week. And from the time he said six days before the Passover, in a day or two, he comes and he's so heavy and he falls. &gt;&gt; Father, if it be possible, &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the one who taught his disciples, pray, thy will be done. Now he had to say it himself. &gt;&gt; Not my will. &gt;&gt; Thine be done. &gt;&gt; Let the kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the will of God. And he prayed it again the second time. &gt;&gt; Tell you what a meeting. &gt;&gt; What a meeting. &gt;&gt; You had a blessing. But maybe there's another meeting. May perhaps that meeting should be this morning. &gt;&gt; When you say, "I'm realizing for the first time what I'm here for. &gt;&gt; Not here just to work &gt;&gt; for an employer. I'm not here just to bring up children. I'm not here just to be a mother or a father. I'm not here just to be a student. I'm here to be the tent of almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You young fellas understand me? &gt;&gt; You understand me, young ladies? Who else? Who else is going to be God's tent? &gt;&gt; Who else is going to be his tent? &gt;&gt; Amen. They can move about in this dark and vile and wicked and unclean generation. Who else? &gt;&gt; Where the holiness of God can step out of the tent, can speak out of the tent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This week, &gt;&gt; all of this happened in this week &gt;&gt; just some years ago, but it's here again. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was rejected. You're rejected. &gt;&gt; He was spoken evil about you. Maybe &gt;&gt; in the message indictment. He said, "Isn't that an indictment?" He said, "I want to take four words. There, the most holy city in the world, Jerusalem. They're the most religious city in the world. There they the most righteous religious people in the world at a religious feast, &gt;&gt; the feast of the Passover. Here they were even celebrating that this our almighty God Jehovah has set this aside as the Passover. But they have it's escaped their mind that this is to be a meeting with them and Jehovah. And here Jehovah was indwelling his tent and they couldn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; There the most holy city. They the most righteous and religious people at the feast of the Passover. There the most religious spot, the most religious city, the greatest of all organizations, the head of it all. There they the most religious people in all the world had gathered from all over the world. They crucified there they crucified the most shameful death that could be a person killed could be killed naked stripped the clothes from him. He is despised the reproach. The crucifix has a rag wrapped around him but they stripped his clothes from him. The most shameful, the greatest religious city. They, the most religious people, crucified the most shameful death, him there. They crucified him, the most precious person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say the dwelling place of almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There &gt;&gt; they &gt;&gt; crucified him &gt;&gt; in that week. Calvary was the appointed time and place. Calvary had the right person where God would meet man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And although Jesus was declared to be the son of God at his baptism, yet there was something much greater to be fulfilled in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the son of God at his baptism. But there was something much more. And lo, a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Please tell me Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How could this small nation of Palestine, how could they have such a supernatural happening and the maniac of the Gatherines and he sent his word and healed them all and Lazarus raised from the dead and all these people healed and they reached through and touched him and demons screamed and he sent out 12 and he sent out the 70 and it swept throughout the whole country and a week before, six days before, they're crying and dancing and before him and after him and waving palms and hear the religious leaders saying, "Who is this?" &gt;&gt; It only goes to show the depth &gt;&gt; of darkness to an unbelieving heart. &gt;&gt; The depth &gt;&gt; of blindness &gt;&gt; to an unbelieving people. &gt;&gt; How could they look at him in the face? How could they have heard such glorious words? They said such marvelous words from him. Listen my brother, my sister, we are no different today. We can we can sit ho h and listen to what God said. He never and I say to you, I declared once again there never has been a min ministry in the history of the entire world from Adam to today where a man stood in front of the multitudes of people and and revealed the secret of their heart. We are the recipients of that kind of what does that do to us? &gt;&gt; Oh thou that dwellest intents, what is it that you are saying to us? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is it that how should we be impacted &gt;&gt; with this? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou that has sent the spirit of Elijah for the fourth time over the face of the earth, how should that affect us? &gt;&gt; Ask yourself, is it sufficient? Are you satisfied with the effort and the and and and and how God has moved your your own being? Are you satisfied with the degree of consecration and the degree of dedication? Or do you feel that there's something more? &gt;&gt; I should be consumed with the hour that I'm in. &gt;&gt; I should be looking to him saying, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; what is it that you'd have me to do? &gt;&gt; What is it you'd have this tent to say?" Friends, I tell you, I'm way off my subject, &gt;&gt; but I feel compelled &gt;&gt; to bring this directly from my heart to your heart, from God's heart to your heart. &gt;&gt; This is not just an average message. This is not an average people. &gt;&gt; It'll only be average if you think it's average. &gt;&gt; But as a man believeth in his heart, so is he. Hallelujah. Although we have had glorious experiences in God during our life, yet it is for this hour and this meeting place in Christ that we came into the world to have this meeting place in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to lose me there. How do I get into Christ? Well, by one spirit, we're all baptized into Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the chosen meeting place for the ultimate union of God and man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In God's chosen place, the message, everything is tied to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; All the Old Testament is tied to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The New Testament is tied to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church today is tied to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ask this gathering of people which is a church. Are you tied to him? &gt;&gt; Inseparably tied to him. &gt;&gt; I'm influenced by him. His thought is my thought. His word is my thought. That's what's coursing through my veins. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go out of these doors and forget it. &gt;&gt; The church today is tied to him by the word of his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's not another place or another name or anywhere where God ever promised &gt;&gt; to meet a man only in Christ Jesus, his chosen place of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's where he chose to put his name, not in the church, &gt;&gt; but in the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And this son, &gt;&gt; this son said this to a small group of people perhaps. And when you see the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; once again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where they planted and they builded. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they had a great economic &gt;&gt; happening in the world. But when you see it happening throughout the world &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Sodom &gt;&gt; and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be &gt;&gt; when the Son of Man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now he sends you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A tent that was lost. A tent that didn't know which way to go. A tent that didn't know what to believe. He sent you a messenger to you personally to say you are my tent. &gt;&gt; Now has come a different season. This is not another religion. This is not another church. Now the word of the living God comes out of the mouth of his chosen vessel to a chosen people at a chosen time at a chosen place. So that there will be a meeting with God and man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can he get into you? &gt;&gt; How can we be into Christ? It was Christ that was being spoken. &gt;&gt; Christ became word. &gt;&gt; So the word could come into the womb of your mind and down into your soul. And then Christ is dwelling in his tent. and God and man merged again in the end time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, "Well, I don't feel any different." &gt;&gt; Oh, now my husband &gt;&gt; Do you know? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That a believer and an unbeliever may not feel any different &gt;&gt; physically at all. &gt;&gt; That's right. But a believer and an unbeliever believes different things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A believer knows who he is. &gt;&gt; A believer knows what's in him. &gt;&gt; One has education in him. One has theology in him. One has something else in him. One is a skilled this, a skilled that. But a believer knows the word of Almighty God has been dispersed through the mouth of his oracle and spoken into my soul and I believe it. &gt;&gt; That's what makes you attempt &gt;&gt; a meeting place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I feel deeply honored and moved &gt;&gt; to be speaking to those who I believe &gt;&gt; are a dwelling place of the almighty God. You believe it up there in a balcony. You believe it with all your heart and soul. You are a tent &gt;&gt; of the almighty God. [Applause] [Music] Oh, I love it. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, &gt;&gt; in the message, the lamb and the dove, when God &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and Christ became one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When the dove came down on the lamb, when there was a meeting, when the dove came down on the lamb, the dove and he saw the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove came down on the lamb. &gt;&gt; It didn't come on another person. This was an appointed time &gt;&gt; at the baptism of the Jesus Christ. This was an appointed person. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He says, "And when the dam when the dove came down on the lamb, heaven and earth kissed each other." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, how sweet, &gt;&gt; how wonderful are those words. When God When God came down in the form of a dove and right on the lamb, it had to be the right nature, the right attitude came down on the lamb, heaven and earth kissed one another, I can't help but think in this end time when the spirit of the bridegroom has come down and called his bride out of the earth and said, "My spirit is in you." I can't help but think heaven and earth have kissed again &gt;&gt; and you are part of this love affair. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth have embraced. [Music] not will be they are reconciled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A sister was standing before the prophet. And he says, "We bring our sister up to Calvary. Yonder hangs the Lord Jesus." Hey, hey, &gt;&gt; this was centuries after it happened. &gt;&gt; He's talking as though it is happening at this moment. We bring our sister up to Calvary. &gt;&gt; You need to have the same spirit, the same attitude. &gt;&gt; The same timeline. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And we bring her up to Calvary. Lord Jesus. Oh, how wonderful. standing yonder the earth beneath him &gt;&gt; and the heavens above him &gt;&gt; reconciling God and man together. The prophet saying we bring this sister to Calvary. We bring her to where the reconciling is taking place. And you and I walk through the earth saying the reconciliation has taken place. God and man has been united and reconciled. [Applause] I love the words that he said, "Would you listen closely, he said to this woman and he was speaking in prayer and we come in his name and what's keeping this woman from being a complete delivered servant is the devil. And there Jesus, you stripped him and you took every legal right away from him. &gt;&gt; And today he's only a bluff &gt;&gt; and we won't receive it. &gt;&gt; We won't receive it. He said it twice. Because Jesus Christ, the son of God, give us the proof &gt;&gt; that he told us. And I'm saying, friends, you have a whole library full of it. The living God has given us a proof. &gt;&gt; We don't need any more proof. &gt;&gt; Even Tommy Osborne says, "I saw it once." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just once &gt;&gt; and that was enough for me. &gt;&gt; I say if he could say that, we should be able to say the same thing. I heard it once. &gt;&gt; I saw it once &gt;&gt; and that's enough for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says because of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; son of God, give us the proof that he told us &gt;&gt; we could do it &gt;&gt; and we believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we take back that which he's trying to rob our sister. &gt;&gt; Listen to the place he puts us in and put you in. I want you to be able to say it. Satan coming to you trying to take away your victory. As I heard a young person write me, you say to him, "I take it back. I take it away from you. You don't have any legal right to it. &gt;&gt; What I believe in my heart has already given me and empowered me over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; we give her her health back. &gt;&gt; We take this weakness from her ankles. &gt;&gt; We take this blood pressure back to its normal condition. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about healing, but I say that's a good proof. &gt;&gt; And you that may be afflicted here, you have a right to say it on the authority of God's servant. I have a right to take it back. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Trying to rob our sister. We give her her health back. We take this weakness from her ankles. We take this blood pressure but back to its normal condition and rebuke the devil that done it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the light of Calvary sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You know I've just had a whole series of tests. &gt;&gt; All kinds of tests. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] He's praising God for me. &gt;&gt; Let the saints say so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let her rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Sister Lisa said, "I need to tell the church this. We're kind of private people, but I've had a whole bunch of tests, and I told you of some of them, but I've gone through something recently." And so, I went just for a simple blood test to say about the cholesterol level. And uh so the doctor he says uh you heard me say this before so I just I I need to give it continuity. He said were you sick when you had this blood test? I said no. He said you weren't sick. No. I said he said you're feeling all right? I said yeah I was feeling fine. Feeling just like I'm feeling now. He said, "Well, the white the white blood cell count is is going up. It's gone. It's too high." He said, "That's indicates something's wrong inside." Okay. He He looked at me. He's been my doctor for some years. He said, "Are you diabetic?" "No." Said, "Have you got diabetes in your family?" I said, "Well, yeah, my grandfather had it." He said, 'Well, you have it, too. Really? Yeah. He said, "You're diabetic." He said, "I want you to go back for another test, and your cholesterol's up." So, I said, "Fine." So, I went for another test, came back. He said, "Yeah, you're clearly diabetic." I said, "Well, what is this scale?" Oh, no, no. He knew where I was coming from. He said kind of the upper side would be seven. He said, "You're at 13.7. You're clearly diabetic." He said, "I want you to go here to this clinic and you'll see a diabetic nurse and then you'll go to a a nutritionist and a dietician and and then they will give you a kit and he'll start testing your blood." And uh so I said, "Okay, fine." So I go and do all that. I go and get the kit, start, and the little booklet says, you know, before and after breakfast, before and after dinner, before and after supper. So, I'm pricking my finger all the time. I had so I had to leave the pulpit here sometimes cuz I my two hours was up just before you eat and two hours after you eat. So, I had to go out and prick my finger and take the blood and I kept all the record for 26 days. And then we had an appointment with the diabetic nurse again. So we go and see her and she looks at it. She says, "Wow." She said, "Did you check your blood six times a day?" I said, "Yeah, you've got spots for it and I thought that's what I was supposed to do." Oh, she says, "That's great." Looking at this 5.9, 7.2, 6.4, 7.8, and she's going all the way. So she starts adding them all up, all the befores and all the afters and all the befores and all the afters and divides with the amount of days. She said, "That's fantastic." She said, "Whatever you're doing, just keep doing it." We're not doing anything. We're just eating like normal. We cut back. Yeah, I can't pile on as much jam as I like, but you know, so what? Can't eat as much honey as I want, but that's fine. Eat a little bit. And she says, "Now this this is fantastic. This is just perfect." I said, "That's great." Okay. So, I go back to the doctor and he said, "Why don't you have another blood test?" Okay. They're going to have another blood test. And he wants more now. So then he says, "Your hemoglobin is too far down. Something's happened with your hemoglobin. He said, "Are you bleeding inside?" I said, "I don't think so." He says, "I want you to have some tests." "Yeah, I have some more tests. I want to see because there must be blood. Even though you can't see it, there must be blood. I want you to be checked out." And because your your hemoglobin was 147, went down to 145, and then dropped to 131. And that's too low. said, "Okay." So, I go for these tests, three days of tests. They sent all the tests. I'm I'm in to see the doctor yesterday. Checked it all over. I said, "How is it?" Well, I said, "The hemoglobin's come back up." I said, "What is it now?" I said, "143." She says, "That's perfect." And uh there's no bleeding. absolutely clear and it is fine. And I'm waiting for him to say, "Why do you even come and see me?" He said, "You got sugar diabetes. I don't have sugar diabetes. Your white blood cells are way too high. Now they're perfectly normal. Now your hemoglobin's down. Now the hemoglobin." You know what I said? The devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's just a liar. If you got something bad, Brother Bram says the doctor may cut it out. You got something that's gone bad, he may cut it out. But you know something, friends, the devil would like nothing better than for him to lie to you about your spiritual walk, about where you are. He'd like to tell you, oh, what you got at camp, that's not going to last. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't it last? &gt;&gt; You're not going to stand. Who says I'm not going to stand? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the same God that I'm referring to tonight was the same presence I felt when I was 14. &gt;&gt; When I was 16, &gt;&gt; and my life continued on. And when I was 18, there was a special move of God. There's a special time. There are times and places where God meets you. &gt;&gt; We are a meeting people, friends. This is I want to say emphatically this is a season like no other season in history. &gt;&gt; This is a message like no other message. You will never find this kind of message anywhere. And God brought it to you. Maybe to your parents, maybe to your uh your friends, but he brought it to you. &gt;&gt; And he put something in your heart to say this is the truth. I don't understand everything, but this is the truth &gt;&gt; and I give myself to it. I'll tell you who it is. It is the same one that walked here. &gt;&gt; It's the same one that rode on the donkey. &gt;&gt; It's the same one. He said, "When you see the days of Noah, do we see them?" &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom, do you see them? &gt;&gt; Even so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. We've had a meeting. &gt;&gt; God has met us. &gt;&gt; And then friends, you didn't just hear about it. &gt;&gt; He touched you. &gt;&gt; You sat in a service &gt;&gt; and the man of God stood behind the pullpit &gt;&gt; and you the Holy Spirit spoke to you and said, "I got to do things different. &gt;&gt; I have to be more consecrated. &gt;&gt; I have to be more intense. I have to be more concerned. There's never been a week like this week. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to hear this, folks. &gt;&gt; The devil much more. The devil doesn't want you to believe it. &gt;&gt; But I want you to say in your heart, not only brother Biscell, am I hearing it, I am believing it. I believe it with all my heart and soul. &gt;&gt; And that scoundrel will never take it from me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many here have ever heard of Billy Bray? Oh, we got four, five, six. My wife must be seven. I'm eight. Anyway, Billy Bray was a coal miner and God met him and converted him. But he had lived such a wicked life, such a vile life. And Satan constantly hounded him and tried to convince him that he was worthless and he was no good and he had lived so unclean and lived such a bad life. And so Satan was actually trying to get him to commit suicide. And he would be going down these shafts in the darkness, got down into the heart of the earth. And that Satan would say to him, "Just jump off. Just jump off and end it all." Because he was having such a war with the enemy. You know, it's not something to be ashamed of, but it's a reality in this time. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Suicide comes through a lot of people's minds. &gt;&gt; It'd be easier without it. Easier without this battle. And I'll tell you just how simple it is. Billy Bray became so wearied with it. And one day while the shaft was going down, he just spoke out to the devil and he said, "Devil, you old smutty face, you do it and see how you like it." &gt;&gt; And that was the end of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take him to task. That may just sound like a story, but it's not a story to Billy Bray. He was in victory from that day on. like the brother down in Florida and brother brother Brown's church, brother uh Homer Brown's church. He was there and he brought his wife to church and he was so faithful wait for her out in the parking lot. Didn't want to come into church because it bothered him. He wasn't ready. He knew he wasn't ready. One sometimes occasionally he'd slip into church and sit there but he wasn't a believer. He didn't profess anything. And this one time when he was sitting there of all things at the end of the service, he just walked up to the front because he'd heard something about the coming of the Lord, something about heaven, and he knew he wasn't going to be there. And he just told the brother, told Brother Brown, the brothers that were going to pray for him. He said, "It's cigarettes. Cigarettes has kept me and bound me and and and I've never given my life to Christ because of cigarettes." And they rebuked that demon spirit and he walked out of there. But you know what? That devil doesn't give up easy. He came back with all the furer and all the lies and all the torment and and was just tormenting him terrible. So he got up and testified and this was his testimony. He said, "I was being so tormented of Satan." So he said, I told him, I said, 'Devil, you and I need to have a talk. So he says, so we got in my car and we drove and I said to the devil, look, devil, you want to smoke. Notice how wise that was. He didn't say, "I want to smoke." He says, "You want to smoke?" &gt;&gt; He says, "And I'm not going to do it." So I think it's just better you go your way and I'll go my way. And that's exactly what happened. The devil went his way and he went his way and he was free from that time on. &gt;&gt; You need to do business with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll need to say right here &gt;&gt; after the end of this service. &gt;&gt; Devil, you want to do it. I'm not going to. &gt;&gt; You go your way. I'll go my way and everything will be just fine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; My time has slipped away. Can I just take a few more minutes and because I want to this is something I couldn't come to in the first first first portion of uh future home and the second one and this is this is I had some things I just want to bring. If you go to page 18 in the future home you'll read these words. I'm going to close with this, but this is to me is really wonderful. I don't have enough time to really preach the way I would like to on it. And you'll run into these words in paragraph one on page 18. Brother Brandham said, "Did you notice how Abraham when they tried to give him the land because now Abraham's wife Sarah had died and he needed a place to bury her. And now here's a I hope you can just put your thinking cap on. Will you listen real close? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Here's a man who God promised to give this whole land. &gt;&gt; This is all yours. Everywhere you put your foot as far as you can see, this land is yours. What an inheritance. And now his wife dies. He doesn't even have a piece of land to bury her. And so he says to these people where he was, "Let me buy a supplicer from you so I can bury my wife." They said, "Abraham, Abraham, you're a great prince amongst us. Don't talk about buying a place to bury your wife. Choose the best. Choose whatever you would. It's yours. No, he said, "I must pay for it." Something in the father Abraham &gt;&gt; saying, "I must pay for it." And what he was actually acting out was centuries later, Satan was going to take Jesus onto an exceeding high mountain. &gt;&gt; And show him all the kingdoms of the world. &gt;&gt; Said, "You don't have to pay for it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to buy it. You don't have to go through Calvary. You don't have to suffer all these things. You just fall down and worship me. It's all yours. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon mentions it many times &gt;&gt; and ties it back to this. And Abraham said, "No, I'm going to buy it." &gt;&gt; I'm going to buy this uh this. And this is what he said about it. Let it be known this day. He said, "I'll buy it for so many shekels of silver before the people as an end sign. It'll be a public witness. I want to do it before the people." That's why Calvary had to be out in the open up on a hill where everybody could see it as they passed by as a witness and as an end sign. Let it be known this day that I have bought this burying place, purchased it. And Satan tried to give him the kingdom which belongs to him. Now, he tried to give it to him as a gift, but he wouldn't receive it because, see, he said, uh, then Satan could still have a claim on it. Right. &gt;&gt; But it had to be bought. &gt;&gt; And he was the word in the fullness thereof. They couldn't deceive him into it. And the Bible says, "And Abraham bowed himself down to the people, even the people of Heth, and he commanded and he give them money for the field and so that he could bury his dead." And the Bible says that there was an instinct in him &gt;&gt; because Job was buried there. He said he buried his sweetheart right beside Job. And then when Abraham died, he was buried there. And when Isaac died, he was buried there. And when Joseph died, carry my bones and bury me there because there was some instinct in them. We need to be in that place. That place that was purchased. [Applause] And when Jesus came, who was the son of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Satan tried to give him the earth, &gt;&gt; but you were laying in the earth. &gt;&gt; The body you're sitting in was in the ground at that time. And Jesus Christ, our redeemer, said, "No, I will buy it. &gt;&gt; I will pay it. I'll pay the full price. I won't try to go around. I'll buy it with my own blood. &gt;&gt; And Jesus purchased his supplicer. &gt;&gt; He purchased your body. &gt;&gt; He purchased the graves that every believer has been buried in. &gt;&gt; And he purchased the resurrection place. &gt;&gt; He didn't just die and buy a burying place. He bought a resurrection place. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, doesn't that do something to you? &gt;&gt; He paid not only for our our body, but he paid for our resurrection. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Whatever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever is the price, &gt;&gt; what would you give &gt;&gt; for resurrection life? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you were the Vanderbilt or the Bill Gates &gt;&gt; and somebody could walk up and say, "Bill Gates, you give me your 45 billion and I will guarantee you and give you proof that you will raise again from the dead." I tell you what, friends, money is meaningless. &gt;&gt; Material things are meaningless. I announce to you Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; didn't just drop his blood on the ground. He didn't just redeem you so you could sit here in a seat. Whatever happens to you whether you live or whether you die. He paid for it. &gt;&gt; He paid that the Adams in your body would be changed. He paid for your resurrection. &gt;&gt; He paid for your salvation. And you do not belong. We are no longer a part of the kingdom of darkness. We are a part of the kingdom of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And that is why that's as far as I'm going to go right now. But that is why he could take it one step further. Jesus rose. He suffered. Dropped his blood. Paid for you. Brother Brandham says some things you'll never hear in your science class. &gt;&gt; He talks about your parents and your forefathers that were laying here in the earth that he bought. &gt;&gt; Your body, your mothers when you were yet in the womb, they ate food. The cattle came from the earth. The vegetables came from the earth. The fruit came from the earth. &gt;&gt; The earth gave you the body you're sitting in today. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's another form of what God said, "Let the earth bring forth." &gt;&gt; You came forth as part of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the blood of the lamb of God spilled down onto the ground, the Romans didn't realize it. The Jews didn't realize it. The Sadducees, Pharisees didn't realize it. He was already paying redemptions full price. &gt;&gt; And he knew who for the joy that was set before him. He endured the cross. He endured the suffering because he kept looking towards the joy. He knew that this suffering was not only going to bring forth a people, but there would to be an appointed time, friends, &gt;&gt; when he would come. He would send a messenger. I don't know what brother Brandham means to you. To me, he's the messenger that wedded me to Jesus Christ. He introduced me to Jesus Christ. He showed me who he was. He conducted the wedding ceremony and we are united already united with him. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that is why he could come out of the grave. He came out of the seur. And that wasn't the end of the Passover. That wasn't the end of it now because it was being extended. They never had this in the Old Testament. And I'm closing now. That wasn't all of it. He now he dropped his blood on and bought you. But now there was another part to this and I closed with it last Sunday and that is there had to be a waving &gt;&gt; of the sheath and he was the first one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen close. He was the first one. &gt;&gt; He was he was the son of God but he was the first one that acted like the son of God. &gt;&gt; He lived like the son of God. &gt;&gt; He had the character of the son of God. He was the son of God. &gt;&gt; He had a different kind of life in him. And the Holy Spirit moved over that still form and raised him up. And then he was seen by Mary. She didn't know. She thought he was a gardener till he called her name Mary. Then he walked with the two on the way to Emmas. They didn't know him till they got to his their place and invited him in. And he was constantly seeking to make himself known. Exactly what he's trying to do today. &gt;&gt; Exactly this morning. You think, "Oh, I had a good time at camp or I mean I had this. I know this brother. I know the deacons, brother Ed, etc., etc. That's that's we're we're only ancillary. We're only things that are on the side. were only instruments through which he wants to &gt;&gt; talk to you. &gt;&gt; And so now he made himself known to a few. Watch real close. And then he showed himself alive by many infallible proofs. It's me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come Thomas. &gt;&gt; Put your finger in my hand. &gt;&gt; Thrust your fist in my side. It's me. &gt;&gt; Then they came to the shore. And there's no boat to get him there. And already there's fish and bread upon the fire. It's the Lord. It's the Lord. And it's it's like it's a dawning of a new day. &gt;&gt; And my dear friends, this message is not a mere doctrine. This is the dawning of a new day. So this same prophet would say in the end of his ministry, I say it's darkness, gross darkness on the people. But I say to you to the bride, shalom. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a good morning to the bride. &gt;&gt; And he says, and then Jesus, they were standing there and he he began to ascend because he was the first sheath. He was the first fruits. He was the first one to come from the dead. And he was waved. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Not for us, &gt;&gt; but he was waved to God. &gt;&gt; There was a waving as as as he physically began to ascend. And there was a waving cuz the sheath the wave she chief had to come to the priest &gt;&gt; and the priest waved it. It was the first sheath that became ripe. He was the first one became ripe and it's waved over the people &gt;&gt; and the and the prophet gave an interpretation. And he said it very clearly that there's more &gt;&gt; like him. &gt;&gt; He said he believed it was waving it before the before God and he's saying, "Father, &gt;&gt; there's more &gt;&gt; like me &gt;&gt; in the field. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bought them. &gt;&gt; I paid for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's more like me in the field that touched me so deep this morning." Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start reading Matthew, Mark, Luke again. &gt;&gt; I want to be like you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to think like you. I want to act like you. I've been a a miserable failure in this, but I want to be like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you already waved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now here it is. &gt;&gt; Yes. And in the rising of the sun, God's messenger prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; And there would have to be another waving &gt;&gt; again today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And the word is being waved." People might say, "Well, it's a tape. It's a book. It's a MP3. It's a iPod. It's this and that." More than all of that, let it register into your soul. This is the word that's being waved over the people and the message remains the same. There's more like him and that they will come. &gt;&gt; You have come &gt;&gt; as a result of that word. &gt;&gt; You are part of that promise. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to say to make you feel good. That's what the word of God declares. &gt;&gt; There'll be more like him &gt;&gt; that'll rise up out of the field. Here we are, friends. &gt;&gt; Here we are. &gt;&gt; God's not going to raise up a whole another generation of people. You've heard it. &gt;&gt; You've heard it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has witnessed to your soul. &gt;&gt; And that's why I say to you, I couldn't say anything more more honorable, I think, at this time. Give yourself &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; to him completely unreservedly &gt;&gt; just to be what he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has waved this word. You think, "Oh, this is a this is brother Brandham and he brought a message." No, not only that. At the end of it, it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it only just comes to me now. My wife and I were baptized at that service. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; I can tell you it was a new dawning for us. &gt;&gt; It was good morning. Shalom, Eden Ruth &gt;&gt; Biscll. &gt;&gt; It's a new day, folks. &gt;&gt; I say to you in the name of the Lord, it's a new day. &gt;&gt; What you feel moving and stirring in your heart, it's a new day. &gt;&gt; It's not just another week. There never was a week like that one &gt;&gt; and there won't necessarily be another week like this one. &gt;&gt; What's the use of taking a chance? You don't want to look back and say, "Well, if I I'd only known." No, &gt;&gt; you'll never be sorry. You'll never never be sorry for living snugged up and right where you ought to be every day, every week. Whether it's this week, it might be next week. If it's not next week, but what if it is this week? &gt;&gt; What if it is this time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord, don't let it h ever have to come from your lips. Oh, I thought there was supposed to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; This prophet said also, there will be those &gt;&gt; Amen. still here &gt;&gt; saying that. &gt;&gt; Settle in your heart. &gt;&gt; I will never be here saying that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will never be so caught up in this life that I have to say, I thought there was supposed to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say to the devil, you're a bluff. &gt;&gt; You're a liar. You have no part of these people. If you feel sluggish in your spirit, cast it out. &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you want to be that way. I'm not going to be that way. I'm giving myself entirely unreservedly." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not your own. &gt;&gt; You've been bought &gt;&gt; with a price. I'd like to just sing. Have you stand with me, please? And I want to sing the chorus. Oh, to be like thee, brother Ryan. Oh, to be like thee, blessed redeemer, pure as thou art. Would you bow your heads with me? Father, a deep stirring is taking place. When we even think of those words, if we could only have brother Brandham here to say, he would say the same words once again, believing that the others would come. Believing that they would come, oh God, and I would like to respond, Father, you uttered your message through your messenger. And I want to say on behalf of those that are in this audience today and those that are in the streaming audience, we have come. Lord, we have heard the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've heard the call. We've responded to the call. We're we we we are responding to duty. We are here, oh God, to be placed in action. We pray, oh father, you'll give us words that we might speak faithfully your words. We We are here to act, oh God. We are here to be, I pray, Father, to be what you would have us to be. Let us be what we need to be to be what to one another. &gt;&gt; Lord, let us be the kind of servants that the early church were. And when they gathered daily, they gathered regularly amongst w with one another. They broke bread together. They encouraged one another. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you'll give us a baptism, Lord Jesus, a baptism of of of sacrifice, Lord, that we might be like you. We see that this week that we're commemorating now, Lord, was a week that you would be undeterred. You would not be moved. You would go and set your face towards Calvary. You would be betrayed of Judas. You would go to the garden and there be betrayed and then you would go, oh God, and before the righteous ones who would condemn you and say all kinds of untruth about you. But you have set a goal and you had intent. You would purchase us. Jesus, thank you for buying me. &gt;&gt; Thank you for paying for me. There's no way I could lift myself up out of this muck and mire. &gt;&gt; But you delivered me. You bought me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, for all those that are rejoicing together, &gt;&gt; we want to be just like you. [Music] Oh, to be like, oh, to be like the blessed redeemer, pure as [Music] come in thy sweetness. Come in thy fullness. Stand thy own image [Music] deep on my heart. Once again, oh to be like thee. [Music] To be like thee. Blessed redeemer, [Music] you as come in thy sweetness. I thirst [Music] [Music] deep on my heart. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love till there's just no more love. Oh, I could never ever out love the Lord. [Music] He became me so I could become him. I believe brother Donnie Reagan brought this course. He became me so that I might become him by grace. He became me. So I might become my gra. He took my place so that I could take him. [Music] Oh, he became me so that I might become my &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to sing it as a prayer. If you would please just lift up your heart, open your heart, lift up your voice, and let these words express what is there. [Music] He became me. You did so that I might become my grace. [Music] He became me so that I might become him by grace. [Music] He took my place so that I through his lamb could take him. [Music] He became me so that I might become my gra. &gt;&gt; I'd like to just ask this congregation as we're coming to a close. Are you sensing has God been doing something in your own heart? Maybe you don't quite fully understand, but there's been a drawing. There's been a supernatural something happening and you desire that that would not only continue, but it would intensify. &gt;&gt; Oh God, it's good to identify it. It's good to make a confession of it. &gt;&gt; God, here I am today. You spoke to me in other meetings. You spoke to me at camp. Do increase it, oh God. Increase it. I'm hungry. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled. Father, my soul cries out, oh God. How long will it be until these bodies, oh God, pass from instruments and tools of time on into the eternal realm. And as your prophet has spoken, your servant has told us, it is just one breath away. &gt;&gt; It is right here beside us. Theophony bodies are filling this auditorium. Oh God, right beside the believers, you would never let that word body go far from them. Oh father God, we do not understand the mechanics or the dynamics of it. &gt;&gt; But we are praying, oh God, that you will quicken us, &gt;&gt; quicken us to this hour, &gt;&gt; quicken us to this meeting, for surely we will meet. Surely we will meet. Oh God, we will meet the dead in Christ. Hallelujah. We will meet the messenger. We will meet the Lord Jesus Christ. What an appointed time and what a feast that will be. Truly a marriage supper of the lamb. A meeting place, a meeting time. Oh God, I want to stand before this people and give you praise without any hesitation in my voice, without any restriction in my soul. We say Lord hosana, glory to God in the highest. Thank you, Father, for your eternal word. And as we move up, Lord, to this coming week, not even knowing if we'll be here for the next Sunday, but if not, what a celebration it will be on the other side when we are with the resurrected Christ and the resurrected ones. We live for that moment, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Well, did I wear you out? All right. All right. There's going to be a meeting in the air and a sweet, sweet by and by. And then we're going to dismiss. [Music] There is going to be a meeting in the air. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] This side's going to be there. We got an appointment. Going to meet you over there. How about this portion here? We're going to meet you over there. Hallelujah. How about this section here? Going to meet you over there. Hallelujah. How about this side here? Amen. We're going to meet you over there. The balcony we're going to meet. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Hallelujah. Oh, what a meeting. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] It's it's essential that we make this kind of confession. &gt;&gt; It's just as it's more powerful than telling the devil, "You want to smoke? I'm not going to do it. You go your way. I'll go my way." This is more powerful. Say, "I'm going to meet you, brother Ed. I'm going to meet you, brother, sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Greet one another and we'll see you this evening. Going to hear the word of God. Brother Tom has been waiting before God for this service and we're going to hear him deliver his soul this evening. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Jesus Christ. [Music] Fair little town. [Music]
