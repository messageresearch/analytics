[12:56] [Music]
[13:01] &gt;&gt; We've got some requests here we want to
[13:02] bring before the Lord this morning.
[13:05] [Music]
[13:07] And uh
[13:09] [Music]
[13:11] I'm gonna ask brother Tony, brother
[13:13] Tony, if you'd come
[13:15] open the service in a word of prayer.
[13:22] Uh we want to remember in prayer this
[13:24] morning the Kirk family. Uh they're not
[13:27] doing well, especially Jordan who has
[13:28] hooping cough. That the Lord would
[13:30] restore them to health. Sister Cheryl um
[13:35] Goss uh
[13:37] handed me a note this morning. It says,
[13:38] "My mom had a stroke on Friday. I would
[13:40] like the Lord to use this to deal in the
[13:42] hearts of my family and for a speedy
[13:44] recovery for my mother." There's a
[13:46] request for the Jar Dar family. The
[13:49] children are as at home sick this
[13:51] morning. And also there's a request that
[13:54] we pray for brother Roland Barber from
[13:56] Tallaladega, Alabama. He had a heart
[14:00] attack. He's going in for a quadruple
[14:02] bypass on Tuesday morning. Uh if there's
[14:05] any other needs in our midst this
[14:06] morning, just lift it before the Lord as
[14:08] we go to prayer. Amen. And uh if you're
[14:11] on the internet listening in this
[14:13] morning, you just take your request
[14:15] before the Lord as brother Tony comes.
[14:20] Lord Jesus, we come into your presence
[14:23] this morning,
[14:25] Lord, with hearts that are full of
[14:27] adoration, full of love. Oh, who is like
[14:31] unto thee, the King of Kings, the Lord
[14:33] of Lords. And Lord Jesus, we've come
[14:36] here this morning, Lord, for no other
[14:39] purpose but to meet with you. Oh God,
[14:42] for in your presence there's fullness of
[14:44] joy. There's delivering power. Oh Lord
[14:48] God, there's revelation upon revelation.
[14:50] Lord, this is the place that we were
[14:52] born from, Father. Oh God, how you've uh
[14:56] illuminated our hearts to recognize who
[14:59] we are. That we were found in you before
[15:02] the foundation of the world. That we
[15:04] were those sons and daughters that sang
[15:06] for joy in the morning when the word of
[15:09] God was being opened. When the word of
[15:11] God was being revealed and we saw the
[15:13] great mysteries, the mystery of God in
[15:16] Christ, the mystery of Christ in the
[15:18] church, the bride, the fullness of
[15:20] Christ in this last days. Oh, how we
[15:23] have a reason to shout. How we have a
[15:25] reason to be happy this morning. How we
[15:27] re have a reason to be able to lift our
[15:30] voices in praise and adoration to you.
[15:32] For you have done all things well. You
[15:35] are our bridegroom. You are our lover.
[15:38] You are King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
[15:41] oh Father, Lord. And it is for this
[15:44] reason that we gather, Lord, to make our
[15:46] petitions known, Lord, because we see
[15:49] you high and lifted up as the great and
[15:52] mighty conqueror, as the one who took
[15:54] the keys from death, hell, and the
[15:56] grave. And oh Lord, in you is health, in
[15:59] you is strength, in you is deliverance
[16:01] this morning. And Father, we bring these
[16:03] needs to you, oh God. Father, you know
[16:06] there are many needs in our assembly.
[16:08] Oh, Father, we know that you work
[16:11] through these these trials, the
[16:13] testings, Father. And Father, we pray
[16:15] and we join our heart with our sister
[16:17] Cheryl for her mother. Lord, if it was
[16:19] our mother, a mother that doesn't know
[16:22] you, a mother that is lost and undone
[16:25] and go into a godless eternity unless
[16:27] you deal with her heart. Oh, Father, in
[16:29] these last days of her life, may you
[16:31] reveal your word to her. May the
[16:34] testimony of Jesus Christ and our sister
[16:36] Cheryl, may it come back to her. May you
[16:39] speak to her. Give her a gift of
[16:41] repentance. We pray for Cheryl's mother,
[16:43] Lord. Oh, Father, we have others that
[16:45] are, Lord, needy and body, families that
[16:49] are not well as this Kirk family has
[16:52] requested prayer. We pray for Jordan,
[16:54] Lord, with this swooping cough. We pray
[16:56] for the Dar family. We pray for others
[16:58] in the assembly that didn't even Lord
[17:01] request a prayer this morning, but
[17:03] they're looking to you. Their hearts are
[17:06] looking to you in faith. We're
[17:08] believing, Lord, that even the unspoken
[17:10] request here is known to you, Father,
[17:12] and that you'll move and you'll confirm
[17:15] that the living Christ is in the midst
[17:17] of us by touching these ones. We can't
[17:20] help but also think of our precious
[17:22] brother Emil Bessie, Lord. Oh father,
[17:25] deliver him from this demon of cancer.
[17:27] Lord, we know of our other sister Norma
[17:29] as well. Lord, we know of others that
[17:31] are Lord inflicted in some way or
[17:34] another. Oh God, there's nothing too
[17:36] great. There's nothing too small. But in
[17:38] these things, the kingdom of God comes
[17:40] near. In these things, we see your
[17:42] power, Lord, and the truth vindicated in
[17:45] these days. Oh Lord, we pray for our
[17:48] brother Roland Barber in Alabama. We
[17:51] pray that you'd strengthen him and any
[17:53] other unspoken request. We remember
[17:55] those that are out ministering and those
[17:57] that'll be ministering tonight as we
[17:59] think of our precious brother DJ in
[18:01] Seattle and brother Tom and Lord others
[18:04] that are gone out. Brother Timothy Dodd
[18:06] in Africa, brother Brad Burges in
[18:08] Australia. Lord, you know, brother Wayne
[18:11] and brother Ed Hunter in India. Lord, we
[18:13] pray for these brothers. And Lord, we
[18:15] hold them up as well as the other gifts
[18:18] to your body. They're dressing of how
[18:20] you're clothing us and how we want to be
[18:23] clothed this morning. How we want to put
[18:25] on your righteousness, Lord. How we want
[18:28] to be robed in the word of God, oh
[18:30] Father. And we pray, Lord, as we've
[18:32] already been holding our pastor up in
[18:34] prayer before you for this service this
[18:36] morning, oh God, we're looking to the
[18:39] unseen. We're looking beyond the veil.
[18:42] Father, this world is temporal. It's
[18:44] passing. But Lord, we see another
[18:46] kingdom. We see another body. Lord, we
[18:49] see another dimension, oh God, that we
[18:51] come from and we're going back to. Oh
[18:54] Lord, speak to our hearts. Strengthen
[18:57] our pastor, Lord. Strengthen brother,
[19:00] Lord. Let him have clarity of mind and
[19:03] thought, oh God, as he's waited upon you
[19:05] for this service, Lord, given himself to
[19:08] the word, yielded himself to you.
[19:11] Father, how thankful we are for men of
[19:13] God that'll do that. What a sacrifice it
[19:15] is on family. Oh Lord, a sacrifice
[19:18] bodily, but Lord Jesus, it's your grace.
[19:21] It's your gift to us to speak, Father,
[19:24] through our pastor. Bless him, we pray.
[19:27] Lord, anoint our hearts. Let there not
[19:29] be a weary one in the midst. And if
[19:31] there's any here that do not know you,
[19:34] having come to know this experience of
[19:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God,
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you move upon those ones. We
[19:42] need to be sealed in in these last days.
[19:45] Oh God, we want to make our calling and
[19:47] election sure. That's why we've
[19:49] gathered. And may you have the
[19:51] preeminence this morning as we commit
[19:53] this service to you in the lovely name
[19:56] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated.
[20:04] [Music]
[20:15] We want to welcome
[20:18] everyone this morning and all those that
[20:20] are visiting with us. We want to make
[20:21] sure that you know you're real welcome
[20:23] this morning. Uh we've got a special uh
[20:27] welcome for Sister Franis. Uh I believe
[20:30] I'm pronouncing that right. At least I
[20:32] hope I am. Sister Franc's twin sister
[20:34] visiting for two weeks from uh London in
[20:37] the UK. May we get our sister to stand
[20:40] up and God bless you. We're happy to
[20:42] have you here.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Trust everyone make a real welcome if
[20:48] you're visiting and uh we haven't
[20:50] recognized you. Just want to make sure
[20:51] that you know you're real welcome here.
[20:53] We've got a special this morning from
[20:55] our sister Elizabeth neighbor. Sister
[20:57] Elizabeth, why don't you come? Um one
[21:01] other thing the deacons have asked me
[21:02] announce this morning. Uh someone's
[21:06] parking in the handicap parking area and
[21:08] they're not handicapped. So, um, you
[21:11] know, we have a few people who are not
[21:13] as mobile getting around. And this
[21:16] morning, our brother Ed Dodd has to walk
[21:17] about a mile from his car because
[21:20] someone parked in a in a handicap
[21:22] parking stall. So, please, if you can
[21:24] get around, uh, I appreciate, you know,
[21:27] you may, we're not in Laos to see, uh,
[21:30] but, uh, you're kind of looking that way
[21:33] if you can't walk, uh, a little bit. And
[21:36] it's not even raining out this morning.
[21:37] So please, you know, the uh handicap
[21:40] parking stall is for people who have
[21:43] difficulty getting around.
[21:46] Amen.
[22:05] [Music]
[22:23] There's a pressure building
[22:26] underneath our wings.
[22:31] preparing
[22:33] a people to
[22:36] fly home.
[22:39] And I feel this
[22:42] difference in the air.
[22:47] Yet his spirit
[22:50] whispers to
[22:52] my soul
[22:55] that with patience
[22:57] I must still press to
[23:00] the goal.
[23:04] Be steady.
[23:06] It will strengthen me to know.
[23:10] I've got to be in condition
[23:14] to
[23:16] go home.
[23:19] So I surrender
[23:22] to the fire that brings me change.
[23:27] holding loose
[23:30] all that I possess
[23:35] in this season.
[23:38] I find rest.
[23:42] [Music]
[23:49] Soon the last mourn will dawn on the
[23:53] sands of time.
[23:57] We will stack our weapons on the bank of
[24:01] heaven
[24:03] shore.
[24:05] But for now we must polish our sword
[24:11] again, advancing onward.
[24:16] Even as the sun
[24:18] goes down,
[24:20] embrace the heat of battle.
[24:24] Taking back our ground
[24:28] till the captain says you've conquered.
[24:32] Trade your armor for a crown.
[24:37] I've got to be conditioned
[24:40] to go home.
[24:45] So I surrender
[24:48] to the fire that brings me chase.
[24:52] Oh you
[24:55] [Music]
[24:56] all that I possess
[25:00] [Music]
[25:01] in this season
[25:04] I find rest.
[25:10] [Music]
[25:16] I will take your hand across the table.
[25:20] There
[25:23] we'll cry tears of joy for the harvest
[25:27] our laborers
[25:30] reaped.
[25:32] And the pain and heartache we carried on
[25:36] the earth.
[25:38] Alone they seem a friend now as we kneel
[25:43] before the throne.
[25:47] They served a purpose
[25:50] to ready me for home. I rejoice in the
[25:55] testing
[25:57] [Music]
[25:58] for I will overcome.
[26:02] I've got to be in condition
[26:05] to

[30:05] [Music]
[30:23] I was in prison,
[30:28] locked up in chains.
[30:32] Sin held me captive
[30:36] to sorrow and pain.
[30:40] Years of frustration
[30:44] as love passed me by.
[30:48] Until
[30:50] the master
[30:52] heard my heart's cry
[30:58] for grace.
[31:01] marvelous
[31:02] grace.
[31:05] I need a grace
[31:08] to pour it in and make me whole
[31:14] gravel
[31:20] [Music]
[31:21] from
[31:23] [Music]
[31:26] love.
[31:28] marvelous
[31:31] grace.
[31:33] [Music]
[31:38] I was downhearted.
[31:42] I was broken inside.
[31:46] Praying
[31:47] for mercy
[31:50] with nowhere to hide.
[31:54] I was a soulless
[31:58] searching for me
[32:01] with grace ever flowing
[32:05] and it set my soul free.
[32:10] It was grace,
[32:13] marvelous
[32:15] grace.
[32:17] I embrace
[32:20] to heart and make me whole.
[32:26] Grace,
[32:28] marvelous
[32:30] grace
[32:32] flows from above
[32:36] with
[32:38] love.

[36:58] Maybe the choir can just start us off
[37:00] again. Grace, grace, grace greater than
[37:02] all my sin. And then just help us sing
[37:05] it. And then you can find your way to
[37:06] your seats while the congregation is
[37:08] singing it.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[37:12] grace,
[37:14] God's
[37:16] grace,
[37:19] grace that will pardon and cleanse
[37:24] with
[37:26] it. Praise
[37:31] God.
[37:33] Praise and grace that he is greater than

[37:40] our lifted up again. Great.
[37:46] Thank you.
[37:51] Grace that will
[37:59] grad
[38:08] that is greater than all
[38:13] our
[38:15] [Music]
[38:17] marvelous grace.
[38:20] We're thankful this morning beyond our
[38:23] words,
[38:25] beyond any expression that we could
[38:26] make, how thankful we are to God for his
[38:30] gracious gift through Jesus Christ. We
[38:33] want to welcome you all this morning.
[38:37] All those that are with us
[38:41] in spirit, perhaps not in body, but
[38:45] those that are with us on the internet
[38:48] and by whatever means and wherever else
[38:50] they may be in the building. I feel
[38:53] badly that some have to can't find
[38:56] seats. I heard last night some had to go
[38:59] to the fellowship room and I know
[39:01] there's always quite a few there but I
[39:03] think it's a better service if we can be
[39:06] right here to just squeeze in and make
[39:08] as much room as possible.
[39:12] Um I'm going to go directly to the uh
[39:15] scriptures again this morning. like to
[39:18] get started as early as possible. And I
[39:21] just want to say to the those that are
[39:24] singing and the choir and the musicians
[39:26] and all, you know, we sit here and we we
[39:29] get blessed by a song, but they have to
[39:31] do some hard work and travel and take
[39:34] evenings and take a lot of other time
[39:37] and just to come here and be a blessing
[39:40] for they probably spend a few hours to
[39:42] be a blessing in a five minute song. So,
[39:45] I think we want to appreciate it like it
[39:47] did take some time. Amen. So, we
[39:50] appreciate all those that sang and the
[39:52] sisters that sang. God bless you all.
[39:56] I'm going to have you turn with me to uh
[39:59] John's Gospel
[40:02] uh the 14th chapter and we're going to
[40:05] read a few verses. You can open your
[40:07] Bible to John 14. And then just before
[40:11] we read, we're going to pray together.
[40:15] John 14. We'll be reading from the first
[40:18] verse down to the ninth verse.
[40:23] Let's just have a word of prayer.
[40:26] Oh gracious and loving heavenly father,
[40:30] we address you so many different ways
[40:33] and then again so many times the same
[40:36] way, but we know that you fill every one
[40:39] of our expressions. However it is that
[40:42] we can approach you or do approach you,
[40:45] but we can never approach you outside of
[40:47] the name of Jesus Christ.
[40:50] Oh God, that name that's above every
[40:53] name. That name at which all knees shall
[40:57] bow. That name at which even at this
[41:00] instant demons are trembling. for those
[41:04] for fear that those of the children of
[41:07] God will have trust, confidence in that
[41:10] name. And we'll appropriate the power
[41:13] that is in that name. And we pray today,
[41:16] oh God, you'll give us insight that we
[41:19] might see what you have put and placed
[41:22] in that person of Jesus Christ. Today,
[41:25] Lord, I pray by the Holy Spirit, you'll
[41:28] make your word a reality. how we thank
[41:31] you for the messages that we have been
[41:33] hearing over this pullpit from service
[41:36] to service, oh God. And I pray you will
[41:39] continue. Take sovereign control of
[41:42] every vessel, Lord, and of myself this
[41:45] morning, to the glory of Jesus Christ,
[41:49] to the glory of his name, to the glory
[41:52] of the kingdom of God, and that God
[41:54] himself might be glorified, the only one
[41:58] and true living God, the God of Abraham,
[42:01] Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Israel, the
[42:03] God who's made this land his choice. And
[42:06] we pray this morning, Lord, that your
[42:09] name will be lifted up and glorified. We
[42:12] give ourselves to you unreservedly. Ask
[42:15] you'll bless the people as they are
[42:17] attentive and listen. And now, Jesus, we
[42:20] are in your presence and we are in your
[42:23] hands.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; We say amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; John 14, we'll begin to read at verse
[42:30] one.
[42:32] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[42:34] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[42:38] my father's house are many mansions. If
[42:40] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[42:43] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[42:47] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[42:50] come again, and receive you unto myself,
[42:52] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[42:57] And whether I go, you know, and the way
[42:59] you know. Thomas sith unto him,"Lord, we
[43:03] know not whether thou goest, and how can
[43:05] we know the way?" Jesus saith unto him,
[43:08] "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[43:11] No man cometh unto the Father, but by
[43:14] me.
[43:15] If you had known me, you should have
[43:17] known my Father also, and from
[43:20] henceforth you know him and have seen
[43:24] him." And Philip saith unto him,"Lord,
[43:28] show us the Father, and it sufficeth
[43:30] us." Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been
[43:34] so long time with you, and yet hast thou
[43:38] not known me, Phillip? He that hath seen
[43:42] me hath seen the Father, and how sayest
[43:45] thou, then show us the Father." Amen.
[43:49] May God bless us together as you have
[43:51] your seats.
[44:00] Last week I had a long title, looking to
[44:04] the unseen and the unseen looking to the
[44:06] seen. And I gave it a second title,
[44:08] prophet optics. And my wife said, "Well,
[44:11] I like that second title. It's simpler."
[44:13] And and I'm going to continue with that.
[44:17] So if you ask for last week's, it's
[44:19] probably going to be just under profit
[44:21] optics. And this week be part two of
[44:24] that same subject, but we're coming at
[44:26] it from quite a a different direction.
[44:30] And I just trust the Lord will help us.
[44:34] Uh Jesus said, "When you've seen me,
[44:37] you've seen the father."
[44:40] Now uh brother Brandham was in a bit of
[44:42] a discussion with someone and and uh
[44:46] over this very very subject and uh said
[44:49] well uh they were raising the question
[44:53] well when when I see you I don't see
[44:56] your wife you see because he said I and
[45:00] my wife are one but he said this is
[45:02] different because he said when you see
[45:04] me you don't see my wife but Jesus said
[45:08] when you see me you see the father.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; He said and that was different. He made
[45:13] a he made a distinction there.
[45:16] And I can say in the spiritual realm
[45:19] everyone has their interpretation uh or
[45:23] their uh understanding of what the
[45:26] scripture means.
[45:29] And uh if they believe that they know I
[45:33] just want to lay some foundations here.
[45:35] If they believe that they know what God
[45:38] is saying, then they begin to act out
[45:41] what what act out that kind of life if
[45:46] they be if they actually know because
[45:48] now I want to I want to give you some
[45:50] slides in just a moment. Uh how how can
[45:54] God make known his thoughts to us? That
[45:58] is the question so that we can see it.
[46:00] How can he make us to see so that we can
[46:04] live out
[46:06] that true vision? How can God how can he
[46:09] uh make it clear to us as individuals?
[46:13] Because today, of course, this morning
[46:15] while we're sitting here, there's
[46:16] churches gathered in every corner. And
[46:18] as I said last Sunday, if it was just in
[46:22] the simplistic way of reading, we could
[46:25] read the scripture. anyone who had
[46:27] normal intelligence could read the
[46:30] scripture. And if we all read it, if
[46:32] that's all there was to it, then we'd
[46:34] all believe the same thing because it
[46:36] would just be that simple. We just read
[46:37] it. That's what it means. And uh if you
[46:40] can read, I can read, we'd all read it.
[46:43] It'd be the same thing. But you see, the
[46:46] scripture is something different than
[46:48] that. And it requires it requires a word
[46:51] we use all the time. It's it's
[46:53] revelation. But I want to use that as it
[46:56] it requires some insight. It requires
[47:00] an internalizing of the of the vision of
[47:03] God. And I hope to be able to make this
[47:06] clear as we move through.
[47:09] Uh when John saw Jesus,
[47:14] John the Baptist, he saw a lamb.
[47:18] Jesus said to Philillip, "When you see
[47:20] me, you've seen the father."
[47:23] So those are two vastly different things
[47:26] and yet they're the same. But he when
[47:28] when John saw him, he actually saw a
[47:30] lamb. Said, "Behold the lamb." Jesus
[47:34] said to Philillip, "When you've seen me,
[47:36] you've seen the father."
[47:38] I want you to think about that.
[47:41] So, it's quite possible to be looking at
[47:46] something and not be able to really
[47:50] see
[47:53] see it for what it is.
[47:55] I don't know what Philillip if you'd
[47:57] asked Philillip, "What are you seeing?"
[48:00] He probably would have described Jesus
[48:03] to you and would have recognized him as
[48:06] being the Messiah, perhaps the son of
[48:08] God and whatever. You see, even even a
[48:12] time the timing of when John saw him.
[48:17] Now, John saw
[48:19] him as a lamb because he was ordained to
[48:22] see that.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; See that he was ordained to have that
[48:27] vision. God gave him that uh uh that
[48:32] perception and that vision and he saw a
[48:35] lamb. Now I'm and and I've got many many
[48:39] examples in the scripture. So we're
[48:40] going to take our time. And now a a
[48:44] short season had passed, not very long
[48:47] till Philip was looking at the same
[48:49] person. He said, "Now when you've seen
[48:51] me, you've seen the father." Well, John
[48:56] was making no reference to seeing
[48:58] Almighty God the Father. When he was
[49:00] introducing Jesus, he was introducing
[49:02] him as a lamb because that's what he was
[49:04] ordained to see. Now, our natural
[49:08] vision, I I I showed some slides and
[49:10] some clips and and been quite a few
[49:12] people have asked for the uh for the
[49:15] slides and things uh that I used last
[49:18] week and and the various mysteries. The
[49:20] reason I put the mysteries of the
[49:21] kingdom up was because there is so much
[49:24] question, there is so much debate upon
[49:28] the mysteries and here Scoffield now uh
[49:31] he he listed I think uh about 11 of
[49:34] them. Then brother Brandham goes on from
[49:36] there and lists a whole another series
[49:38] of mysteries including the uh false
[49:41] anointed ones believe the serpent seed
[49:43] he starts off with and those are
[49:45] mysteries because now you see we are in
[49:47] a different season. We're at a different
[49:50] time and God needed to take a certain
[49:54] instrument and it would be a prophetic
[49:58] office, a prophet instrument, prophet
[50:02] optics, and peel back the layers of
[50:06] things. I was thinking when when we saw
[50:08] that little clip coming from 10 million
[50:11] light years into space and so on and
[50:13] then coming down to a leaf and coming
[50:15] down. Of course, what was in my mind
[50:17] because I already had had it in my notes
[50:20] in the simplicity of the message here.
[50:23] The prophet comes and takes a si six
[50:26] billion souls on earth and takes the
[50:29] scripture many false anointed ones many
[50:33] Christs many Christ shall rise false
[50:37] Christs shall rise just takes that
[50:40] scripture and then with prophet
[50:42] prophetic optics begins to peel it back
[50:44] and say there's there's the blade
[50:48] there's the stock
[50:50] &gt;&gt; here's the husk
[50:52] &gt;&gt; here's the tossel
[50:54] &gt;&gt; it is.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Now notice how the husk is just exactly
[50:57] like the seed,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; but it's not the seed.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was different.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And that hasn't got any. And this hasn't
[51:06] got life in it. It's just passing
[51:08] through. This hasn't got life in it.
[51:10] Notice how it turns yellow in the
[51:11] harvest time cuz the life has passed out
[51:14] of it. And here it is moving up through
[51:16] all of the church ages and all the
[51:18] denominations and moving on and
[51:20] explaining to the people that's why
[51:21] there's no life there left.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It's gone on from there. What is that?
[51:26] Prophet optics.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:31] And he's showing from uh from the
[51:34] scientist of all scientists, God
[51:35] Almighty, and just peeling back the
[51:37] layers and showing you why it's not
[51:40] there and and laying it overlaying it
[51:42] over the entire earth religious world of
[51:45] the earth and showing it's not there.
[51:47] But then saying, but but notice what
[51:49] went into the ground. A seed went into
[51:51] the ground. And notice what's here at
[51:54] the end time. What went into the ground
[51:56] was word. And notice now in the end time
[51:59] it has to be word. Can't be anything
[52:01] else. Has to be word. And notice it only
[52:03] went in one in the ground. But when it
[52:05] comes in the harvest, there's many.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's prophetic optics.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And how he took these mysteries and just
[52:15] began to peel them back layer by layer.
[52:18] And if you watch it, it's so accurate.
[52:20] It couldn't be any more accurate than
[52:22] that.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] Now
[52:36] Jesus said when you've seen me you've
[52:39] seen the father and I just want to uh I
[52:43] want to just take uh some slides here
[52:45] quickly
[52:47] to uh give some uh just some
[52:50] understanding of the words that Jesus
[52:53] used when he said you have known you
[52:56] should have known. And hast thou not
[52:59] known me, Phillip? And so, can we just
[53:03] have that slide up, please? Hast thou
[53:06] not known me, Phillip?
[53:14] which means to
[53:16] uh the word known
[53:19] is to learn to know
[53:22] or to get a knowledge of
[53:26] and to to understand. But more than
[53:30] that,
[53:32] to the Greeks,
[53:34] this meant to know facts. But these
[53:37] facts may or may not affect one's
[53:40] conduct. That was to the Greeks, but not
[53:43] to the Jew. To the Jew, true knowledge
[53:47] always, always manifested itself in
[53:51] one's conduct. And the church says,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; To the Jew, to the spiritual Jew, it
[53:59] always manifested itself in one's
[54:02] conduct. And so when one somebody says
[54:05] to me, "Well, I've got, oh, such an
[54:08] understanding. Oh, this is such a
[54:10] glorious revelation. All the rest of it,
[54:12] I don't discount that, but I watch for
[54:14] it to manifest.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I want to see something happen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; I want to see something, you know, u
[54:21] being manifested in the life. And that's
[54:23] the evidence.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If I if I, you
[54:29] know, had the spirit of Beethoven in me,
[54:32] what'd he say?" He'd write music. If you
[54:35] have the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci in
[54:37] you, you'll paint art.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; You'll just do that. You can't help that
[54:41] if you have the life in you. And if we
[54:43] have the life of Jesus Christ in us,
[54:46] they said that one did not know
[54:48] something until that fact had a
[54:51] practical outworking in his life. That
[54:55] was, "Have you not known me?" And then
[54:58] he that hath seen me
[55:01] hath seen the father. And to see is to
[55:05] properly to stare at. If you've seen me,
[55:09] you've seen the father. But this scene
[55:10] is that you stare at something. You ever
[55:14] been stared at? You almost feel
[55:16] uncomfortable. Well, we need to stare at
[55:20] the word.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Literally stare at the word. It is to
[55:26] see with the eyes. That's only one. But
[55:28] to see with the mind and to perceive.
[55:30] And that's we're asking for today. or to
[55:33] become acquainted with by experience. So
[55:36] it's not just something you see with the
[55:38] eyes and it's not something that you
[55:40] just merely are illuminated with in the
[55:43] mind but it is something that you have
[55:47] you become acquainted with. You come to
[55:49] know it by experience. You've actually
[55:52] experienced it.
[55:54] And then uh this goes further. Now, we
[55:57] want you to note that this word gives
[55:59] prominence to the discerning mind. And I
[56:02] trust we all have discerning minds. When
[56:05] the physical side recedes, I have it
[56:08] underlined because I would like you to
[56:10] pay strict attention to that. Today we
[56:14] we are here in a church in a group of
[56:16] people and we
[56:19] Jesus when he was seen by John
[56:25] saw a lamb
[56:27] Jesus when he had Philillip there he
[56:30] said you've seen me you've seen the
[56:32] father that was at that time we have a
[56:36] message and that message has been
[56:38] internalized
[56:40] within a body of people here on this
[56:44] Sunday,
[56:47] January 2006.
[56:50] And I wonder what it is that you and I
[56:53] actually in all truth see
[56:56] when we see one another
[56:59] &gt;&gt; or when we see this gathering of people
[57:01] today to a lot of people they say it's a
[57:04] church
[57:06] and maybe to a lot of people here it's a
[57:08] church. If that's all you see, you've
[57:11] missed it.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I see Christians." If
[57:15] that's all you see, you've missed it.
[57:17] Also,
[57:19] &gt;&gt; what do you see when you see God's
[57:22] people? What do you see when you see the
[57:25] message of say, "Oh, I I I've got a I've
[57:28] got a message book here. I got the token
[57:29] here and oh, what I'm seeing." But now
[57:32] when this is actually uh dwelling
[57:35] indwelling the truth of the word
[57:37] indwelling in individuals what is it
[57:40] that we actually see
[57:44] &gt;&gt; that's where we need to come to because
[57:46] that's when the physical the physical
[57:49] side really needs to recede
[57:52] &gt;&gt; so that the spiritual side is something
[57:55] where we are focused and that's what we
[57:57] see.
[57:59] Next one is
[58:02] everything the Christian this brother
[58:05] Brand speaking now everything the
[58:07] Christian can depend on is the unseen
[58:12] the promise of God that he's simply
[58:14] saying what we see can't be depended on
[58:18] &gt;&gt; we can't really fully depend on one
[58:20] another I trust that we can have trust
[58:23] and confidence in one another but we
[58:25] cannot depend because everything that is
[58:28] here is temporal and it's passing and we
[58:32] you might be able to depend on me today
[58:33] to keep my word to do something for you
[58:36] tomorrow I may not have the strength
[58:38] tomorrow you may not be around so we
[58:41] don't know we don't know about the
[58:43] future so we can't depend on one another
[58:46] in that in that at that level um we but
[58:51] he says that everything that Christian
[58:53] can depend on is the unseen the promise
[58:56] of God and We look at something that we
[59:00] don't see with our eyes. And by the way,
[59:03] if you see it with your eyes, you don't
[59:06] see it. See it means to understand it.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And so when we see the kingdom of God is
[59:14] not with observation. We don't see it.
[59:18] If we think we see the kingdom of God,
[59:20] then you don't see it. Because to see it
[59:22] is to understand it. I cannot look at
[59:24] this body of people here today and
[59:27] understand the kingdom of God. For the
[59:29] kingdom of God is within you. The
[59:31] kingdom of God is going to manifest
[59:33] itself in ways that's going to surprise
[59:35] you and surprise me. The kingdom of God
[59:39] because we don't see it. We simply
[59:41] believe that it is here in existence
[59:43] because Jesus said it was. Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; In the token message, I have one quote
[59:50] here which may seem unrelated, but as we
[59:52] go on the service today,
[59:55] the token for the believer today is the
[59:57] Holy Ghost. Well, we don't see the Holy
[59:59] Ghost, but we see the effect of the Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost. It's unseen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; It's not something that I can fully
[1:00:08] understand, but I can believe it. Right.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And so today's he said the the token for
[1:00:15] the believer today is the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:17] not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the
[1:00:20] Holy Spirit of God. That is the token
[1:00:24] that God requires of the church today.
[1:00:27] God must see this token. He must see it
[1:00:30] in every one of us.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to be coming down
[1:00:38] because I want to speak a good deal
[1:00:40] today
[1:00:42] on the on the subject of the blood. Uh
[1:00:46] and it will tie together for you. To
[1:00:49] understand,
[1:00:51] brother Brandham said to to see means to
[1:00:54] understand it. That's in the message
[1:00:55] perseverant. Now uh just to give a
[1:00:59] little bit of rehearsal from last
[1:01:02] Sunday, we
[1:01:05] uh we have different kinds of sight and
[1:01:08] different types of vision. We have sight
[1:01:10] by the natural eye. Now this is not my
[1:01:14] notes from last Sunday. I I just I go
[1:01:17] over it completely for this for this
[1:01:19] particular service today. But how
[1:01:22] limited and how restricted is our
[1:01:25] natural vision and can be obscured and
[1:01:29] can not be accurate, cannot be really
[1:01:32] clear. Then we have sight by our mind's
[1:01:35] eye. We have understanding or we have a
[1:01:38] mental comprehension.
[1:01:41] And there's a place where mental insight
[1:01:44] and understanding actually merge because
[1:01:48] you know you've had the experience well
[1:01:50] uh yeah I see it I think I see it. Yeah.
[1:01:52] And then a person keeps speaking keeps
[1:01:55] explaining and it becomes clearer
[1:01:58] clearer to you. And finally you say oh
[1:02:02] yeah I got it. I see it now. I
[1:02:04] understand it. because now you got an
[1:02:06] understanding of something that has been
[1:02:09] been uh someone has been giving to you
[1:02:12] mentally. We read the scriptures or we
[1:02:15] hear the message and we gain you know we
[1:02:18] gain some insight but you've experienced
[1:02:20] it and I have many times and that is
[1:02:23] that after months and maybe even years
[1:02:27] and then one day you read the very same
[1:02:30] scripture and oh
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; there it is. Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How couldn't I see that
[1:02:37] before?
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Why didn't I see that before?" There it
[1:02:41] is in the plainest of language. But you
[1:02:44] see, there had to be a time. And if a
[1:02:46] person walks humbly before God and
[1:02:49] hungers and thirsts after righteousness,
[1:02:52] you will be filled and you will be fed.
[1:02:55] You will drink at fountains. Amen. If
[1:02:58] you just keep the right posture in uh
[1:03:02] before God and walk softly before him
[1:03:05] and humbly and continue to hunger and
[1:03:08] continue to love him and continue to
[1:03:10] feed yourself on the word, he will open
[1:03:13] it up. He will manifest it. I mean even
[1:03:16] if we say naturally speaking you can you
[1:03:19] can uh uh you know you've had your maybe
[1:03:22] your breakfast this morning whatever
[1:03:24] more you you eat your food but it's a
[1:03:26] total mystery of what that's doing
[1:03:28] within your system total mystery what
[1:03:31] that's doing but you just believe it's
[1:03:32] doing something
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; you just believe and then you carry
[1:03:35] right on you don't stop and try to
[1:03:38] figure everything out
[1:03:40] vision can come also by inspiration
[1:03:44] what poets I think of poets and inspired
[1:03:48] writers and inventors which I mentioned
[1:03:51] briefly and I won't won't carry on with
[1:03:53] that at all and then the vision that
[1:03:56] comes by revelation because that truly
[1:03:59] is what the believer lives on and as the
[1:04:02] prophet said revelation is more
[1:04:03] important to us than anyone can actually
[1:04:06] realize. Now what those in the scripture
[1:04:09] I would like to go back now for our
[1:04:12] benefit today to see what different
[1:04:14] individuals within the scripture what
[1:04:17] they saw
[1:04:19] what Abraham saw. We'll just start with
[1:04:22] him and what Lot saw. They saw two very
[1:04:26] very different things. Now
[1:04:30] I I read a quote for you last Sunday
[1:04:32] where and and I have it here. I'm going
[1:04:34] to bring it out just a little later on,
[1:04:37] but where Abraham actually saw Isaac and
[1:04:40] by seeing Isaac, he saw the unseen. By
[1:04:43] seeing Isaac, he was counted and
[1:04:46] believed it. He was counted righteous.
[1:04:49] Now I and I I think it's important for
[1:04:51] us and I don't want to sound repetitious
[1:04:54] because I emphasized it quite heavily
[1:04:56] last Sunday but we hear so much and I
[1:04:58] have heard so much and it it perhaps for
[1:05:01] myself but I we hear it continually that
[1:05:05] we see the scripture and we quote the
[1:05:08] promise and we just have to see the
[1:05:10] promise see the promise but it's even
[1:05:12] more than seeing the promise. It's
[1:05:14] seeing what the promise says. What the
[1:05:16] promise the evidence of the promise and
[1:05:19] we look at the evidence. That's why
[1:05:21] brother Brandham said he said in regards
[1:05:24] to healing, what do you do? You put a
[1:05:27] healed person out in front of you. He
[1:05:30] didn't say you put the promise out in
[1:05:32] front of you. He said you put the healed
[1:05:34] person out in front of you. In other
[1:05:36] words, you put the evidence of the
[1:05:39] promise in front of you. The promise
[1:05:42] promises something, but he's saying take
[1:05:45] the evidence of the promise and put that
[1:05:49] in front of you and keep your vision on
[1:05:51] that. What do you see? I see a healed
[1:05:54] person. What do you see? I see a saved
[1:05:57] person. I see a delivered son. I see a
[1:06:00] delivered daughter. I see the evidence.
[1:06:02] And now I thank God for the evidence.
[1:06:05] And I walk in the in with the with my
[1:06:08] eyes fixed on that. That's my vision.
[1:06:11] Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; God spoke to Job
[1:06:20] and this is what he said.
[1:06:23] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:06:25] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[1:06:28] thou hast understanding. Who hath laid
[1:06:31] them? Who hath laid the measures
[1:06:32] thereof? If thou knowest, or who hath
[1:06:35] stretched the line upon it? Whereupon
[1:06:38] are the foundations thereof fastened?
[1:06:41] Who laid the cornerstone thereof? When
[1:06:44] the morning stars sang together and all
[1:06:47] the sons shouted for joy, he he's saying
[1:06:51] where were you?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't think he's saying in the
[1:06:55] sense where were you?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; you little piece of nothing.
[1:07:00] No, brother Brandham said he trusted
[1:07:03] Job. He had confidence in Job. And so I
[1:07:06] think he's trying to tell Job something.
[1:07:08] Where were you
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; when the morning star sang together
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; and the sons of God shouted for joy?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet now prophet optics peels
[1:07:19] back the scripture. And he says then
[1:07:22] every Christian that's a real genuine
[1:07:25] Christian was with him when the morning
[1:07:28] stars sang together
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; and the sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah. Every born again Christian,
[1:07:38] are you here?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Born again Christian, every bornag again
[1:07:44] Christian was with him, was identified
[1:07:47] with him when the sons of God shouted
[1:07:50] for joy and the morning stars sang
[1:07:53] together. He said, "We were identified
[1:07:56] in the immortal realms with God 10
[1:07:59] million years before the world was ever
[1:08:03] formed. I like that kind of optics.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just read it as
[1:08:08] something God was saying to Job. And so
[1:08:11] many people will take it as a negative
[1:08:13] effect upon Job, belittling Job. He
[1:08:16] wasn't belittling Job. He was letting
[1:08:18] Job know you were with me.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; When we laid the foundations of the
[1:08:23] world and the morning stars sang
[1:08:25] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:08:28] joy,
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He was lifting him up,
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; but he was also showing Job how great he
[1:08:38] was in two entire chapters. How great
[1:08:41] God is
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; and that Job had a relationship with
[1:08:45] him.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And you were in the immortals. I was
[1:08:50] back there with him. If I've got eternal
[1:08:53] life, I was there with him. I was
[1:08:56] identified with him when the morning
[1:08:57] stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:09:01] shouted for joy.
[1:09:04] When Job when God was finished asking
[1:09:07] Job many many questions and Job
[1:09:10] confessed he was void of understanding
[1:09:13] of the greatness of his God, this God.
[1:09:16] And he and and God asked him these
[1:09:19] questions. And Job said, "Behold, I am
[1:09:21] vile, and I I will I what shall I answer
[1:09:25] thee? I'll lay my hand upon my mouth."
[1:09:29] He just felt this was so great. I I
[1:09:34] can't even attempt an answer to this.
[1:09:38] And as we ponder the greatness of God
[1:09:40] and
[1:09:42] I just go back to the simplicity of the
[1:09:45] little clip and I make so many
[1:09:47] references to it because I wanted to
[1:09:49] spawn a thought in your mind and sew a
[1:09:51] seed and coming 10 million light years
[1:09:55] you know this is not mythology this is
[1:09:57] reality and coming right down onto a
[1:10:00] leaf on a tree and in Florida that's not
[1:10:02] mythology that's not mystic that's
[1:10:04] reality and to show it and coming down
[1:10:07] into such a minute and such a you know
[1:10:11] almost in this finite realm and yet it
[1:10:14] becomes infinite to us almost because it
[1:10:16] just seems like it was endless and they
[1:10:18] say what do you have to say about that I
[1:10:21] just say I'll put my hand on my mouth
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; I don't understand I don't understand a
[1:10:26] god of such greatness that can make
[1:10:29] those things and I trample them under my
[1:10:31] foot worlds underfoot I have another one
[1:10:33] I'm not going to show it to you but it
[1:10:34] just shows the the things that are so
[1:10:37] insignificant that you don't you trample
[1:10:40] over them every day
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; as you walk around do your duties. You
[1:10:44] trample over entire worlds
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; things that are existing and living uh
[1:10:50] uh you know living insects and things
[1:10:54] and we can't even begin to comprehend
[1:10:56] it. And when you see it under that kind
[1:10:58] of microscopic
[1:11:00] uh inspection, they are they are so
[1:11:03] intricate.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; They are so incredible and you think
[1:11:07] you're looking at something that's four
[1:11:09] or five ft high. And the thing is is you
[1:11:12] couldn't even begin to see it with the
[1:11:13] naked eye. They're just worlds, entire
[1:11:17] worlds all involved and intricately
[1:11:20] intricately connected with one another.
[1:11:23] And we have no concept. We're just
[1:11:25] blundering on in our little space of
[1:11:28] time and little space of life. I tell
[1:11:30] you, our God is great.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And those things aren't even connected
[1:11:37] to redemption. What do you think about
[1:11:40] the blood that's connected to
[1:11:42] redemption?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; What do you think about the reality of
[1:11:46] salvation that's connected to our
[1:11:48] eternal life?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it is beyond our
[1:11:53] understanding. Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; One time the Greeks came to Philillip
[1:12:00] and they desired of him, "Sir, we would
[1:12:03] see Jesus. We'd like to see Jesus.
[1:12:08] We'd like to perceive with our eyes.
[1:12:12] We'd like to understand with our senses.
[1:12:15] We'd like to gain knowledge. We'd like
[1:12:17] to gain some understanding of this
[1:12:19] Jesus. We'd like to see him. We'd like
[1:12:22] to know him.
[1:12:24] And Jesus comes with this answer which
[1:12:27] you've heard so many times but in in the
[1:12:29] context of the service this morning.
[1:12:32] Verily, verily I say unto you, except a
[1:12:34] corn and wheat fall into the ground and
[1:12:36] die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it
[1:12:39] bringeth forth bringeth forth much
[1:12:42] fruit. if it die.
[1:12:47] They never did get to see him
[1:12:50] in the as as they perceived him to be.
[1:12:54] We'd like to see Jesus. And Jesus did
[1:12:57] not offer himself because he knew that
[1:13:01] by showing himself to them they would
[1:13:05] see with their natural eye but actually
[1:13:08] would be deceived by it
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; because they could not see Jesus the way
[1:13:14] they wanted to see him. We want to look
[1:13:16] on him and by looking on him we'll get
[1:13:18] to understand it. We'll get to know it.
[1:13:21] Now nothing has changed friends. It's
[1:13:23] the same today. Some say you about the
[1:13:25] message. Well, well, you know, I'd like
[1:13:26] to check it out. I'll tell you what,
[1:13:29] save your time.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Don't even bother trying to explain it.
[1:13:33] This isn't something you can be checked
[1:13:35] out. This isn't something you can think
[1:13:37] about. Well, I like to just come and see
[1:13:39] and maybe give me a book or two and let
[1:13:41] me That's not how it's really
[1:13:43] understood. I realize that I realize
[1:13:45] that many of us did because there was a
[1:13:48] certain hunger, a certain appetite, and
[1:13:50] there was something within us that God
[1:13:52] appealed to and drew us to himself. But
[1:13:55] but if if people in their human wisdom
[1:13:58] said, "Well, you know, I've got a lot of
[1:14:01] spiritual experiences. I come from a
[1:14:02] certain church, etc., etc. I'm going to
[1:14:04] check this out. And if you're here this
[1:14:06] morning, check it out." It doesn't come
[1:14:07] that way. Jesus isn't checked out. Jesus
[1:14:10] isn't something that's discovered that
[1:14:12] way. You can't just look at it and take
[1:14:14] it for, you know, what what your eyes or
[1:14:16] what your little puny mind can grasp.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] So except a corn and wheat. So Jesus now
[1:14:27] is referring to
[1:14:29] like you to hold on to this. Jesus is
[1:14:31] referring to a process,
[1:14:35] a process that they all understood real
[1:14:38] well. So it's a parallel, a parable
[1:14:41] which goes parallel with a truth. Except
[1:14:44] a corn of wheat, the Greeks understood
[1:14:47] that. It was just all too simple. the
[1:14:50] except a corn and wheat fall into the
[1:14:52] ground, it abides alone. But if it dies,
[1:14:55] it bringeth forth much fruit. They might
[1:14:58] have said, "What's that got to do with
[1:14:59] seeing Jesus?" But he's referring to a
[1:15:02] process that they all understood to
[1:15:05] reveal how they would come to see or to
[1:15:09] know or to understand God. And that was
[1:15:12] that Jesus had to die and the spirit
[1:15:16] that raised him up would have to come
[1:15:18] back into the church and then the Greeks
[1:15:22] for there were many who heard heard of
[1:15:24] Christ through the
[1:15:26] through the apostles. Now in the
[1:15:29] unveiling of God,
[1:15:32] so the Greeks, brother Bram says,
[1:15:34] couldn't see him because he was hid from
[1:15:36] them in a human being.
[1:15:42] Notice his word to them. Except a corn
[1:15:45] of wheat fall into the ground, it abides
[1:15:49] alone. God veiled
[1:15:52] in the form of a man
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; hid himself
[1:15:58] from their view.
[1:16:00] They could only see a man.
[1:16:03] But those predestinated
[1:16:06] seen God. Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; One, he said, saw a man
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and one saw God.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And they were both right,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; but one could get eternal life and the
[1:16:19] other couldn't.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; One saw a man,
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; but the other saw God,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; now listen closely. And it was God
[1:16:30] veiled in a human being,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; making both of them right. Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Both of them, right? He says, "But your
[1:16:38] faith in what you don't see, you believe
[1:16:42] it anyhow. God veiled in a human being.
[1:16:45] He was in that flesh and that flesh was
[1:16:49] his veil."
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; He goes on in the same message, he
[1:16:55] always was veiled,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; but he was veiled unto them. He was he
[1:17:00] was in his human temple.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. God was in his human
[1:17:06] temple. Now he says, "Now be real
[1:17:10] careful."
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:17] forever.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Be real careful. God in his human
[1:17:23] temple, God veiled. Because God, the
[1:17:28] great God, he veiled himself. I tell you
[1:17:32] what, if he can take life and veil that
[1:17:34] life in in insects
[1:17:37] and in in part of a creation we have no
[1:17:41] concept of we trample over entire
[1:17:43] worlds. If God can take life, actual
[1:17:47] just natural life and have it down and
[1:17:49] then scientists have to take their
[1:17:51] microscopes and all kinds of instruments
[1:17:54] and their optics and they start to look
[1:17:56] in their laboratories and begin to see
[1:17:59] oh all kinds of life and germs and cells
[1:18:02] and things moving. Even as Job could say
[1:18:06] uh the skin worms which was in his body
[1:18:09] though the skin worms are in his body
[1:18:12] and he knew he knew understood those
[1:18:14] things. My friends, there are things
[1:18:16] that are going on inside you right now
[1:18:19] you have no concept of, you have no idea
[1:18:22] of and men have studied it for
[1:18:24] generations and for generations trying
[1:18:27] to uh uh trying to determine what how
[1:18:30] how this functions and how that works
[1:18:32] and all of these things all of the
[1:18:34] living organisms and things that we have
[1:18:37] as humans. It's just a small part. But
[1:18:40] now God has got a profit and peeling
[1:18:43] back Yes.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Taking the human taking our human
[1:18:48] understanding and peeling it back saying
[1:18:51] that won't work. You got to have a
[1:18:53] different kind of optics to look in here
[1:18:55] and then take away this human veil. And
[1:18:58] now when they take the human veil back,
[1:19:01] don't pay any attention to the veil.
[1:19:02] What do you see? Once it's once the veil
[1:19:05] is off, I see God.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And the one that doesn't see it says
[1:19:11] you're a cult.
[1:19:13] It's a cult that believes that. I say,
[1:19:15] "Praise God."
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; As in the way they call heresy, this is
[1:19:20] the way I serve the God of my fathers.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And when we see one another, we see God
[1:19:28] in his church. That same messenger said,
[1:19:30] "All that God was, he poured into
[1:19:33] Christ. And all that Christ was, he has
[1:19:35] poured into the church."
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the church today,
[1:19:39] what do you see? What do you see? I see
[1:19:43] a brother that failed. I see a brother
[1:19:45] that stutters. I see a sister that's
[1:19:46] this. I see children that are this.
[1:19:48] Whatever more what I see, I want to peel
[1:19:51] away. Peel away that human flesh, that
[1:19:54] human failure, that human weakness. And
[1:19:57] look what's inside. What is it that they
[1:19:59] believe? What is it they have faith in?
[1:20:02] What is it they have confidence in? And
[1:20:04] when you peel that away, you'll see God.
[1:20:10] And it'll be a different thing. You see?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; He not only was in his human temple.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; He's in his church today.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus could not have said it any
[1:20:29] clearer.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I am the father and the father in me.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I in you and you in me. You'll be in the
[1:20:37] Father and you'll be in me and I'm in
[1:20:40] the Father and I'm in you and you're in
[1:20:43] me. You believe that?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; How much planer can it get?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; We may not have
[1:20:51] them even the mental optics to catch it,
[1:20:54] but your faith optics can lay hold of it
[1:20:57] and believe it. And by believing it, you
[1:21:00] shall see it.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] You
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; don't have to keep quoting some phrases.
[1:21:06] Now you look at the finished product. I
[1:21:09] see myself as a son of the living God. I
[1:21:13] see myself as a daughter of Jesus
[1:21:15] Christ. I see myself when you look at
[1:21:19] one another and when you look at
[1:21:20] yourself. I'm sure most people here took
[1:21:22] a glance at themselves in the mirror
[1:21:24] this morning before coming to church
[1:21:26] just to check things out. But when you
[1:21:28] see yourself, you must see yourself as
[1:21:30] the elect lady
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. the bride of Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; if you would,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; that's not just something for a preacher
[1:21:42] to scream out over the pulpit. That's
[1:21:44] something for you to believe.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; That's something for you to confess.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And not for you to say, "Well, I have to
[1:21:50] keep saying that. Keep saying that." No,
[1:21:52] no. The principle is you see it.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; You see, Mrs. Jesus, you see the bride
[1:21:57] of Jesus Christ. I see a spotless church
[1:22:01] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:22:04] thing.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; I'm glorifying him.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to glorify the enemy and
[1:22:14] Satan and brings all the all our
[1:22:16] frailties to the forefront and tells us
[1:22:19] how awful we are. We know that.
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; They went all the people that brother
[1:22:26] Brandham had before him, the thousands
[1:22:29] and told them, revealed the secret of
[1:22:31] their heart.
[1:22:34] In most cases, they knew that that was
[1:22:37] what was wrong.
[1:22:39] He didn't reveal something to them that
[1:22:41] they didn't know. In most cases, in some
[1:22:43] cases, he did, but in most cases, they
[1:22:45] knew they had tuberculosis or they knew
[1:22:48] they had leukemia or they knew they had
[1:22:50] something and he just told them. But
[1:22:52] they knew. He did not know. And that's
[1:22:54] why he would say the thousands of times,
[1:22:56] "Isn't that true?" Because they knew it.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You understand? They knew it.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; So he he wasn't he wasn't telling them
[1:23:07] their trouble to glorify the problem.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; He was telling them their trouble so
[1:23:14] they could get out of the problem.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; See, that's the key. When we stand here
[1:23:19] behind the pull pit, I'm not here to
[1:23:22] glorify our weaknesses and our
[1:23:23] frailties. We all know we got it.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You know you have it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You know our biggest problem is number
[1:23:31] one.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; We all know that.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; So there's no use majoring on that. We
[1:23:37] give God the glory. Soon as he exposes
[1:23:40] the need, then a person just wants to
[1:23:42] say, "It's me.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord." And I'm so glad you
[1:23:45] exposed it because I know right behind
[1:23:48] it is the answer.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Right behind it is the remedy.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Do you have faith?
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Your faith can see the remedy.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; We see by revelation
[1:24:05] Abel saw that it wasn't fruits.
[1:24:11] Right.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He saw
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; it wasn't fruit.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; He saw that it was blood.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Prophet says the whole church of the
[1:24:26] living God is built upon the revelation
[1:24:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ in the garden
[1:24:32] of Eden
[1:24:34] after Cain and Abel and them were turned
[1:24:37] out of the garden. Did you notice how
[1:24:40] that Cain who came and worshiped the
[1:24:43] Lord and offered a sacrifice and done
[1:24:45] all he could, very religious Cain was,
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; but Abel, he came not with works,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; but by faith.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he offered unto God a
[1:25:00] more excellent sacrifice
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; than that of Cain.
[1:25:05] Yes.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; God testifying that he was righteous
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; because he was s because he seen the
[1:25:14] program of God.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Abel had sight.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; He had sight that no no instrument in
[1:25:24] any human laboratory could give him. He
[1:25:28] had sight by revelation
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; and he saw the program of God and it was
[1:25:34] revealed to him. The Bible wasn't
[1:25:36] written then.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; So if Cain his brother who sat under the
[1:25:41] same teaching, they sat under the same
[1:25:44] teaching, their mother and father told
[1:25:47] both sons the same things.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He said the same teaching of father and
[1:25:54] mother and came down and brought forth
[1:25:57] fruit to make an offering. Cain had the
[1:26:00] same teaching Abel had. But in the same
[1:26:03] teaching, he saw something else.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; In the same teaching,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Abel saw the program of God.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; In the same teaching, one saw fruit and
[1:26:15] the other saw blood.
[1:26:18] How different it is to hear the same
[1:26:20] teaching.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; The same teaching
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; and one sees a man and the other one
[1:26:26] sees God.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; In the same teaching
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; in the same message, you have a believer
[1:26:33] and you have an unbeliever. In the same
[1:26:35] message, you have a believer and a
[1:26:37] makebeliever. in the same message. I
[1:26:39] trust that we've had the preaching of
[1:26:41] the message in such a way here so that
[1:26:43] it has just sifted and filtered out
[1:26:45] because I feel such a power of of the
[1:26:48] hearts of the people that are believing.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And I see those also that try to
[1:26:53] believe. I see the young ones coming up
[1:26:55] and you sit here and you're respectful.
[1:26:58] I believe that if you sit here and you
[1:27:00] listen and you say, "Oh God, my heart is
[1:27:03] open and my spirit is tender, God is
[1:27:06] duty bound to reveal it to you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And he will reveal it to you and you
[1:27:11] just hang in there. It'll be a
[1:27:13] revelation to you. You'll catch it." It
[1:27:16] maybe wasn't the first time that Abel
[1:27:18] has heard it, but after he heard it
[1:27:21] under the teaching of mother and father,
[1:27:23] no Bible written, but under the teaching
[1:27:26] of mother and father. and the spirit of
[1:27:28] God. And of course, Abel, he had a
[1:27:31] revelation.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; It's by blood.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; But Abel by revelation, listen now, he
[1:27:43] saw that it wasn't fruits that brought
[1:27:46] us out of the Garden of Eden.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Something began to dawn on him.
[1:27:54] couldn't be fruit
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; that brought us out of the garden
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; because of fruit
[1:28:02] the almighty the divine
[1:28:05] has driven us out of this place
[1:28:08] couldn't be fruit
[1:28:11] didn't just wouldn't connect with him
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; had to be something else
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; maybe I'm dramatizing a little bit maybe
[1:28:20] he was out there
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; with the sheep
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; out there and it began to grip him.
[1:28:28] He saw that lamb, maybe saw that lamb.
[1:28:32] There's something more. It wasn't fruit,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Something much, much deeper than that.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Something was witness saying, "I can't
[1:28:40] explain it.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it." But there's
[1:28:43] something in me.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; There's something in me that wants to
[1:28:46] take this little animal. Innocent as it
[1:28:49] is, I'm going. Yes, I'm going to take
[1:28:52] it.
[1:28:54] and he brought it to an altar.
[1:28:57] How mysterious that must have been to
[1:28:59] him. He never saw it done before.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; His parents didn't tell him to do it. He
[1:29:03] didn't hear a preacher. He didn't have
[1:29:05] He was being driven
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; by something he saw.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; It had to be something more that drove
[1:29:13] us out of his presence.
[1:29:16] I'm going to take this lamb and baby
[1:29:19] find a rock and begin to to begin to
[1:29:22] hack at his throat and and it bleeding
[1:29:24] and blood flying and and bathing its
[1:29:28] cold as brother Brandham describes it.
[1:29:30] And God looked down and accepted that
[1:29:33] sacrifice because why? There was a lamb
[1:29:37] before the foundation of the world that
[1:29:39] was slain in heaven.
[1:29:43] And the heavenly picture and the earthly
[1:29:45] picture came together.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And God looked upon it and accepted it
[1:29:51] because it was what was in the mind of
[1:29:53] God.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And so he took animal blood and
[1:30:00] transferred it from an animal to the
[1:30:02] earth
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; in type
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; of one that was coming.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] And listen now.
[1:30:17] But by faith he saw
[1:30:20] By faith he saw. He didn't only say it
[1:30:23] was blood, but by faith he saw the son
[1:30:25] of God coming.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Abel saw the son of God coming. I tell
[1:30:32] you, that's the kind of optics I want.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we talk about his coming
[1:30:40] in this generation. And I tell you, it
[1:30:42] takes more than human mental optics. You
[1:30:44] cannot have mental your your own mind
[1:30:47] gymnastics won't get around it. You'll
[1:30:49] read it in the word of God. And another
[1:30:52] mighty angel descends and a prophet
[1:30:54] comes and begins to peel it back and
[1:30:56] say, "Notice, it's the same one that's
[1:30:58] in Revelation one. It's the same one.
[1:31:01] It's not another one. The rainbows over
[1:31:03] his head and his feet like pillars of
[1:31:05] fire. It's the same one. It's not
[1:31:07] another one. And a prophet peels it back
[1:31:10] with prophetic optics and says, "There
[1:31:12] it is, children."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say, "Amen."
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; You won't get this out of a human
[1:31:22] laboratory.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; You won't get this even by the Hubble
[1:31:25] spacecraft.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; This is something beyond that.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This is beyond 10 million light years.
[1:31:33] This is beyond the dissecting of a leaf.
[1:31:35] This is a prophetic optics live on into
[1:31:38] the eternities and says there he is
[1:31:41] coming down that mighty angel.
[1:31:44] It's the Christ.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Coming
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; to take his bride out. Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] Hallelujah.
[1:31:56] And that's why it comes in Revelation
[1:31:58] 10:7. He's peeling it back. The last
[1:32:00] messenger has to declare all the
[1:32:03] mysteries that have been sealed up
[1:32:07] because he has the optics to open it up.
[1:32:10] Optics that you and I don't have and the
[1:32:13] church doesn't have hasn't had for 2,000
[1:32:16] years. The optics haven't been in the
[1:32:18] Bible school or in the seminary. These
[1:32:21] are not scholar optics. These are not
[1:32:24] religious leaders optics. These are
[1:32:27] prophet optics.
[1:32:31] [Applause]
[1:32:33] He saw the son of God coming.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I can say today, I've seen the son of
[1:32:38] God coming.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Open your eyes, young men. Open your
[1:32:45] eyes, young lady. Open your eyes, saints
[1:32:47] of God. This is this has already been
[1:32:50] here and been declared.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:32:59] I'm not asking how you feel about it.
[1:33:00] I'm saying that's what's been thus
[1:33:02] sayeth the Lord. And God came from the
[1:33:05] supernatural realm and stood at the
[1:33:07] platform and and backed it up time after
[1:33:10] time after time. It was the truth. It
[1:33:13] was the truth. And today, it's still the
[1:33:15] truth.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise God.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He saw the son of God coming
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; and he offered lamb, a lamb in a
[1:33:35] figurative type, seeing that Jesus was
[1:33:38] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:33:40] the world.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; By faith,
[1:33:48] Abraham saw Isaac.
[1:33:52] As we said before,
[1:33:54] he looked at the unseen
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; and he saw Isaac.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't just see a promise, but he saw
[1:34:01] Isaac.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; After I want to after looking to the
[1:34:12] unseen,
[1:34:14] he called the things which were not as
[1:34:17] though they were.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] 10 spies,
[1:34:22] 12 of them.
[1:34:25] God sent out by the word of God through
[1:34:27] the mouth of a prophet, "Send out these
[1:34:29] spies."
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And they all came back.
[1:34:34] And 10 of them saw one thing
[1:34:38] and all agreed to it. And two saw
[1:34:41] something else.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "And they
[1:34:44] brought up an evil report of the land."
[1:34:47] Saw the same land. saw the same city,
[1:34:51] saw the same walls, saw the same giants,
[1:34:54] but two of them seen something
[1:34:56] different.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the spirit of Joshua
[1:35:01] and the spirit of Caleb is still here
[1:35:03] today.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; God's not interested in some little
[1:35:09] wishy-washy, you know, religion and I go
[1:35:12] to church and I we have some kind of
[1:35:14] programs. God's not interested in that.
[1:35:17] He's interested in men and women of
[1:35:19] faith
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; who see something,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; a reality,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; they see it. It's not imagination. The
[1:35:27] imagination optics is no good. And the
[1:35:30] optics of the affection is no good. And
[1:35:32] the option of the optics of all of the
[1:35:34] realm of the spirit of the reasoning and
[1:35:37] the imagination and all those things
[1:35:39] that won't get you any place because
[1:35:41] that gets all blurred and cloudy. But
[1:35:44] faith, faith sees it clearly.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Faith sees the evidence.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; If you had enough faith here this
[1:35:55] morning, you can see yourself walking on
[1:35:57] the streets of glory. I see yourself.
[1:36:00] See yourself with that great host.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. See yourself with that great
[1:36:04] host of witnesses. See yourself greeting
[1:36:06] them. See yourself embracing them.
[1:36:09] Hallelujah. We see the evidence.
[1:36:14] the evidence. Yes, sir.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Faith puts you there.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And if you're not ready to go, that
[1:36:21] faith will save you today.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; If you're bound, that faith will deliver
[1:36:25] you now. As you hear the word and say,
[1:36:27] "I'm not ready." That's all you have to
[1:36:29] say. Lord Jesus, come to me. Cleanse me.
[1:36:32] Deliver me.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Release my faith.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They brought an evil report
[1:36:44] of the land which they had searched unto
[1:36:46] the children of Israel, saying, The land
[1:36:49] through which we have gone to search it.
[1:36:51] It is a land that eateth up the
[1:36:54] inhabitants thereof. And all the people
[1:36:56] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:37:00] stature, and there we saw the giants,
[1:37:04] the son of an sons of Anch, which came
[1:37:08] of the giants, and we were in our own
[1:37:11] sight as grasshoppers.
[1:37:14] And so were we in their sight. Well, I
[1:37:18] tell you what, they turned into
[1:37:20] preachers of doom and enter and turned
[1:37:23] into false prophesiers as well. They
[1:37:26] prophesied what the giants were
[1:37:28] thinking.
[1:37:33] That's exactly what the devil, he'd just
[1:37:36] like to, he'd like to just get you to
[1:37:38] see your problems and your future and
[1:37:40] everything in the future so desperate
[1:37:43] and so impossible and such giants and
[1:37:46] such mountains and such wall cities. I
[1:37:48] can never never overcome this. And not
[1:37:51] only that, they they're going to eat me
[1:37:52] up.
[1:37:56] this world and the direction it's going.
[1:37:58] It's just going to tear me to pieces.
[1:38:00] This devil's been on my trail. Well, why
[1:38:03] don't you get on his
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; and drive him out?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you what. And then people lean on
[1:38:10] lean on the uh uh I don't have anything
[1:38:13] wrong with, you know, we lean on the arm
[1:38:15] of the flesh and if it'll support you,
[1:38:18] but won't support you very long. And we
[1:38:21] have, you know, we have the world and
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; and they have all of their instruments
[1:38:25] of aid and to help us and all the rest
[1:38:27] of it, but somewhere along the line
[1:38:30] it'll fail.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And God has to take over.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; God has to take over.
[1:38:40] And uh so they saw their giants
[1:38:44] and they saw what the giants they said
[1:38:47] we are in in our own sight. We looked at
[1:38:50] ourselves. We related ourselves to what
[1:38:53] we saw out there and we're grasshoppers.
[1:38:59] They should have said, "You know what?
[1:39:03] When we got out there and we saw those
[1:39:05] people, we couldn't help but think,
[1:39:07] Moses, of what you said,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; and God has given us this land
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and we are going to inherit this land.
[1:39:13] We don't know how, but these guys are
[1:39:16] nothing to us. Hallelujah. We just came
[1:39:18] through the Dead Sea. We just saw rather
[1:39:21] they uh we came through the Red Sea and
[1:39:23] we've just seen the plagues of Egypt and
[1:39:26] we saw how the Egyptians look at all the
[1:39:28] gold and the jewels that they give us
[1:39:30] just to get rid of us. that gods are
[1:39:33] God.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Watch out, Anch.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Watch out you giants.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; You're nothing.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; In comparison to the Red Sea, you're
[1:39:45] nothing
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; in comparison to Pharaoh. You're nothing
[1:39:49] in comparison to his chariots and his
[1:39:51] armies and his horses. You're nothing.
[1:39:53] And our God destroyed them.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; No. But they looked at it and then put
[1:39:59] themselves in relationship to it and saw
[1:40:02] their frailty and their weakness and oh,
[1:40:04] we're grasshoppers. And God God was
[1:40:07] angry with that.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And Joshua and Caleb, they were not of
[1:40:12] that spirit.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; They were a different spirit in them.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And Caleb said, "Let's go up here.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; They're bread for us.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Let's take it."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I say to my brother, my
[1:40:27] sister, the world may be in a bachelor
[1:40:29] condition and the world is hellbound and
[1:40:32] it's full of iniquity and becoming more
[1:40:35] iniquitous day by day. Vile, evil,
[1:40:38] violence, all the rest of it. We're not
[1:40:40] of this people. We're not of this world.
[1:40:43] We're of another land. That's according
[1:40:46] to the word of God. You're a bloodbought
[1:40:49] group. The prophet said, "You're an
[1:40:50] Exodus group." Hallelujah. You're an
[1:40:53] Exodus group. Don't let Satan cheat you
[1:40:56] out of that.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; There was a whole mob around Steven
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; and the words that he was saying made
[1:41:11] the people so angry
[1:41:14] and they had all come against him,
[1:41:16] including the Apostle Paul, who was
[1:41:18] still Saul.
[1:41:21] and he was gripped
[1:41:23] by what was happening in Jerusalem and
[1:41:26] these heretical heretical Christians.
[1:41:30] And here's this young man, Stephen,
[1:41:34] a a deacon or whatever. And he was
[1:41:38] proclaiming and he preached a mighty
[1:41:40] service
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and they were smitten in their heart.
[1:41:44] and they come on him. And when they came
[1:41:46] and they begin to take stones and
[1:41:49] they're getting ready to stone him and
[1:41:51] Stephen says, "Behold,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I see."
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I see.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; No one else saw it.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I see the heavens open.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus Christ standing at the right
[1:42:10] hand of God.
[1:42:12] And what he saw,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; what he saw sent the man in a rage.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; What he saw and what you see does not
[1:42:21] please a lot of people. You say, "I see
[1:42:24] I'm not only bloodbought. I'm married to
[1:42:27] Jesus Christ. I see it. I see the
[1:42:31] evidence of it. And I'm going to walk
[1:42:32] through this world as his wife."
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; That makes people angry. Nash on it.
[1:42:40] They'll put all kinds of nasty things on
[1:42:43] their websites and tell all kinds of
[1:42:45] lies about our messenger prophet. And
[1:42:48] even if you try to correct it, they
[1:42:50] don't have any time for it. They don't
[1:42:52] want to believe the truth.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; They want to believe a lie.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; They nash on it. Why? It's the same
[1:43:00] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I hope it's meaning something to you.
[1:43:06] Glory.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; And I see the son of God, the son of
[1:43:10] man, standing on the right hand of God.
[1:43:13] And they cried out with a loud voice and
[1:43:15] stopped their ears and ran upon him with
[1:43:19] one accord.
[1:43:23] Amos,
[1:43:26] you have to pray for me.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amos,
[1:43:32] brother Bram said, his bald head was
[1:43:35] beating with sweat.
[1:43:37] He came down over the hill
[1:43:40] and his eyes narrowed
[1:43:43] and he said he looked at the tourists.
[1:43:47] He looked at the tourists cuz Israel was
[1:43:50] prospering and the people were making
[1:43:53] money and they were living the high life
[1:43:57] but they were away from God.
[1:44:00] And everybody what they could see was
[1:44:02] the prosperity and the materialism and
[1:44:04] the tourism and oh man why aren't we
[1:44:07] going aren't we doing things why we're
[1:44:10] living in a you know we're buying and
[1:44:12] selling and trading and building and all
[1:44:14] of these things is like it is today
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; but this prophet's eyes narrowed and he
[1:44:21] saw a backsliden
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon mentions Hollywood he
[1:44:25] saw Hollywood that's why my brother my
[1:44:27] sister we don't want to see any
[1:44:28] Hollywood Hollywood in the church.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see any Hollywood, any
[1:44:32] traces of it anywhere. And whether it's
[1:44:34] in our dress or in our department or in
[1:44:36] our language or in our music or in our
[1:44:38] preaching, we're not here to put on a
[1:44:40] show.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the gospel of Jesus
[1:44:44] Christ. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amos,
[1:44:58] brother Brandham says, "That's the
[1:44:59] reason I I rake across
[1:45:04] the clergy."
[1:45:06] How can you read the same Bible I am? So
[1:45:10] did the 400 prophets down there in
[1:45:12] Israel. They read the same Bible that
[1:45:14] Micaiah read. But he was willing to
[1:45:17] spiritually take a stand. Amos in his
[1:45:20] day. Are you tired?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amos in his day, the fearless prophet of
[1:45:27] God, he walked up there to Samaria. He
[1:45:30] looked
[1:45:32] he looked over the city and he seen all
[1:45:36] the corruption.
[1:45:38] You know, whether you live in Seattle or
[1:45:41] Bellingham,
[1:45:43] Lyndon,
[1:45:45] Vancouver,
[1:45:46] or what it is, you rub shoulders with it
[1:45:49] all.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; And some of it's religious up to the
[1:45:53] eyebrows,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; religious as can be.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; But they'll deny Jesus Christ to be you
[1:46:00] to be baptized in his name.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; They'll say in one side of their mouth,
[1:46:04] they love him. Don't you dare say his
[1:46:06] name over me in the water.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; How does that reconcile? It doesn't come
[1:46:14] from God. It doesn't come from my Bible.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And you rub shoulders with it.
[1:46:25] Listen, brother, sister, vile and
[1:46:27] perverted generation that we live in.
[1:46:30] And you want to see if you see the
[1:46:33] corruption,
[1:46:35] it'll keep you going away from it.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Don't get comfortable with it.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; It's corrupt.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Gets a little quiet.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I want to see what Amos saw.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says they were
[1:46:54] presuming they were all right.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:59] Listen church,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; we don't want to just presume
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; we're all right.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; We want to know
[1:47:07] in the deepest recesses of our soul
[1:47:12] that we are sitting here today
[1:47:13] bloodbought,
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; cleansed,
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; pure,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; by the holy sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just am holding myself back. And I
[1:47:23] shouldn't be holding myself back. I've
[1:47:25] got to preach for another few minutes.
[1:47:27] His
[1:47:28] eyes narrowed over his uh and his eyes
[1:47:32] narrowed over his beard and the tourists
[1:47:34] came from all over the world around to
[1:47:37] see the great Samaria. But that prophet
[1:47:39] seen it through a different eye.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, they come from all over the world
[1:47:45] and say, "Oh, the great skiing and the
[1:47:47] snowboarding and uh Mount Baker and oh,
[1:47:49] how beautiful this area is is
[1:47:51] evergreen." Of course, it's evergreen.
[1:47:55] I don't think it'll ever get brown.
[1:47:58] Last year it got brown. Anyway, I'm not
[1:48:02] going to complain. Let the Lord bounce
[1:48:04] it out.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; But I'm tired of this rain.
[1:48:09] I want to get that to all the people out
[1:48:10] in the internet. Almost 30 days of it,
[1:48:13] folks. Just 10 more days and we'll be up
[1:48:15] with Noah.
[1:48:20] Just hang in there.
[1:48:23] Brother Ernie traded rain for pain. I
[1:48:25] mean rain for sunshine. Sunshine for
[1:48:28] Incidentally, Brother Ernie's going to
[1:48:30] be preaching tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] Haven't heard him for some months. He's
[1:48:34] got lots on his plate. So,
[1:48:40] but they saw something different. He saw
[1:48:43] something different. We see all the
[1:48:44] tourists that come around here.
[1:48:48] But I'd like to say this morning, Lord,
[1:48:51] there's a group of people here. We see a
[1:48:53] whole lot more than the natural beauty.
[1:48:55] We see way beyond that. In amidst it, we
[1:48:58] see corruption.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; We see vile unbelievers.
[1:49:05] We see men, you know what you're you
[1:49:09] actually associate with people that hate
[1:49:11] God.
[1:49:14] They hate the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:49:16] died for their sins.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; They would never say that,
[1:49:21] but they do.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; That's hard to say that, but it's the
[1:49:25] truth.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; And if you come right down and pin it
[1:49:28] right down, you'll find out the colors
[1:49:31] will finally show.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; If you get weary, I'm just going to have
[1:49:40] you stand for a moment, but
[1:49:43] You're all right.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Abel saw, Abraham saw, Job saw, Amos
[1:49:53] saw. Now I want to spend the last part
[1:49:56] of the service on what God saw.
[1:50:03] God,
[1:50:06] he looked down and he saw a little lamb
[1:50:09] being sacrificed.
[1:50:11] He says there the poor little lamb just
[1:50:13] a dying bleeding and bleeding and the
[1:50:16] blood flying out like that bathing his
[1:50:18] little wool and God looked down and said
[1:50:23] God God
[1:50:26] who fills all time and space whether you
[1:50:29] go 10 million light years I can't
[1:50:31] understand this this God but I can't
[1:50:32] understand what I'm walking on how can I
[1:50:34] understand God this God looked down
[1:50:40] on on a on a lamb and something was
[1:50:42] coming out of his throat
[1:50:45] and and a and a chemistry of blood
[1:50:50] was bathing his wool
[1:50:53] and he said it's bleeding and kicking in
[1:50:55] his life throws and God looked on it and
[1:50:58] said that's right
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; now
[1:51:04] I've been spending a lot of hours and I
[1:51:06] wish I could be more eloquent
[1:51:09] I wish I could be
[1:51:13] have a more
[1:51:16] understanding of the subject. But I have
[1:51:19] been thinking about out of this mind of
[1:51:23] God that made all of these things
[1:51:27] and manifold untold millions and
[1:51:31] millions of species of things we know
[1:51:34] nothing about.
[1:51:36] But in that mind
[1:51:39] when he made Adam
[1:51:42] and formed him out of the
[1:51:45] dust of the earth
[1:51:47] and of all of the mechanism and the
[1:51:50] systems within him, he put in his veins
[1:51:54] blood
[1:51:56] and a certain composition,
[1:51:59] a certain molecular
[1:52:02] system
[1:52:04] of blood.
[1:52:06] Blood when you're cut it will coagulate.
[1:52:11] Blood
[1:52:13] that has
[1:52:15] has the life principle in it.
[1:52:18] Blood that has held man in mystery.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Long before science understood that it
[1:52:25] was even a circulatory system.
[1:52:28] Blood heathens who knew had no education
[1:52:32] whatsoever. They always thought that
[1:52:34] blood they had blood rights.
[1:52:37] Different peoples of the earth centuries
[1:52:40] and centuries and centuries ago had
[1:52:43] blood rights because blood had something
[1:52:46] something about it. And they were
[1:52:49] interested in their in their blood
[1:52:51] brothers
[1:52:53] and and how they would make uh blood.
[1:52:56] Even today you know people want to say
[1:52:58] well if we write it in blood
[1:53:01] uh blood has something special
[1:53:05] and today in our day
[1:53:08] the blood has become an extremely
[1:53:12] intriguing and interesting
[1:53:15] substance
[1:53:17] and just this congregation here and
[1:53:19] those that are hearing me and throughout
[1:53:22] the world I can tell you that every Hey,
[1:53:26] there are millions, untold millions of
[1:53:30] technicians that are examining through
[1:53:33] the best optics they have, the blood,
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And they're watching at things that are
[1:53:40] moving that you and I have no knowledge
[1:53:42] of. They're watching at things that are
[1:53:44] moving.
[1:53:45] And then they write the report and send
[1:53:48] it to the doctor. And the doctor calls
[1:53:50] you and you sit in his office. He says,
[1:53:54] I don't have very good news for you.
[1:53:58] Our people have looked at your blood
[1:54:01] and you're a very sick person.
[1:54:05] You have leukemia
[1:54:08] or you have
[1:54:10] uh cickle cell anemia
[1:54:13] or you have some other blood disorder
[1:54:16] and there's great lists of them which
[1:54:17] I've looked at and I said this would
[1:54:20] boggle the people's mind. These are sick
[1:54:23] people. There's a blood and he
[1:54:27] discovered the cancer in the blood. And
[1:54:30] at the season when this thing would
[1:54:32] start to start to spiral on a high
[1:54:37] incline of diseases,
[1:54:40] knowing nothing of AIDS at that time.
[1:54:44] And God is preparing
[1:54:46] prophet optics
[1:54:48] for this generation
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and getting ready to send them out. And
[1:54:53] an angel from the presence of God comes
[1:54:56] to him says nothing is going to stand
[1:54:58] before your prayers. Not even cancer.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Not even nothing
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; will stand before your prayers. Not even
[1:55:06] cancer. And if you can get the people to
[1:55:08] believe, not believe in God, believe in
[1:55:10] him.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; That he was God's messenger. If you can
[1:55:12] get the people to believe, nothing will
[1:55:14] stand before your prayers, not even
[1:55:16] cancer. And that thing now, he said it's
[1:55:19] a disease of this age.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And men have been studying it. And now a
[1:55:25] prophet stands with a grade seven
[1:55:27] education. Now he said it's a cell. And
[1:55:30] you maybe injure yourself and you have a
[1:55:33] bruise and a cell there and it becomes a
[1:55:36] wild cell. and that wild cell begins to
[1:55:39] sap the life or you get a tumor and a
[1:55:42] tumor uh fastens itself to the body.
[1:55:45] It's like a growth on a tree and it
[1:55:48] begins to sap the life out of the tree
[1:55:50] and that never never escapes my mind as
[1:55:54] I've stood by the bedside of those who
[1:55:58] have a cancer or a tumor and a tumor is
[1:56:01] sapping all the life and all the food
[1:56:03] that they can give that individual. It
[1:56:06] just takes the life out from them. And
[1:56:09] that's why I I've prayed I have prayed,
[1:56:12] "Oh God, give me a ringside seat. When
[1:56:15] you cast this demon of cancer into the
[1:56:19] lake of fire, I want to stand there and
[1:56:23] throw my hands up and rejoice.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; It's over and it's done. And that demon
[1:56:29] will never plague another person."
[1:56:35] How real this is to our brother Kim
[1:56:37] Dingwald and I never knew he would be
[1:56:39] here today whose daughter with leukemia
[1:56:43] for eight years and you have seen the
[1:56:45] video. If you haven't, you may get it.
[1:56:47] And I tell you, she's a angel of a of a
[1:56:51] young woman. And how the father and
[1:56:53] mother stood by that child and the
[1:56:56] church and the prayers of the saints
[1:56:58] from wherever and why she had to go
[1:57:00] through it for eight years. I know not.
[1:57:02] But she lives today. She lives today.
[1:57:04] God has delivered her from that today.
[1:57:07] Nothing will stand before your prayers,
[1:57:08] not even cancer.
[1:57:11] If you can get the people to believe and
[1:57:13] that same message that came out of the
[1:57:15] lips of that angel, those words still
[1:57:17] stand true this morning.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this one died and that
[1:57:22] one died and whatever." Brother Brandham
[1:57:24] said, "If I prayed for 500 and 500 all
[1:57:27] died," he said, "By the next morning, I
[1:57:29] still believe in divine healing." We
[1:57:32] can't change it because of the
[1:57:34] circumstance we see. This is still true.
[1:57:37] This can never change. This is God's
[1:57:39] word and we see the evidence.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; But there was something in God's mind.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry for the time, but I I have
[1:57:52] to go on just a little bit.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; And something in God's mind and he put
[1:57:57] the substance of the blood together. And
[1:58:00] then and the animal kingdom, they cannot
[1:58:03] give us a transfusion. But one human to
[1:58:06] another, we can all give each other
[1:58:08] transfusion. Doesn't matter what
[1:58:10] background we come from, what the color
[1:58:12] of our skin is. We may, he made all man
[1:58:15] of one blood. And we can give each other
[1:58:17] transfusion if that would be necessary.
[1:58:19] And God saw this. And now Abel by
[1:58:22] revelation saw it was blood. It was
[1:58:25] blood. And blood need to be shed. And he
[1:58:27] said the blood because he saw the coming
[1:58:29] of Jesus Christ. He saw another lamb.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; And God looked on it and said, "That's
[1:58:35] right.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And the blood was transferred from the
[1:58:43] animal to the ground."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And because of that, he came under the
[1:58:47] hand of another one whose name was Cain.
[1:58:51] And Cain transferred the first human
[1:58:53] blood from a body to the earth. Amen.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; And God had cursed the earth
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and Abel's blood couldn't redeem it.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; But the lamb that he saw coming could
[1:59:10] redeem it.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Help me out, folks.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Pull on the word. Now,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Satan hates the blood, but we love the
[1:59:20] blood.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; The blood signifies his defeat.
[1:59:28] Hallelujah.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Every demon of hell is fearful of the
[1:59:31] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Just hold it.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And God would take of the earth
[1:59:43] and prepare a body.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; But before that body would be formed,
[1:59:50] God himself
[1:59:52] wrapped himself in a human cell.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; In the womb of a woman called Mary
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; and began to form a body
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; with a holy newly created blood of
[2:00:06] Almighty God.
[2:00:09] Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; And when God said to Moses,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; you will slay a lamb and you'll put the
[2:00:16] blood upon the lentil and the doorpost
[2:00:19] of the door. And when I see the blood,
[2:00:23] he wasn't interested in seeing the paint
[2:00:26] of an animal on the doorpost
[2:00:29] or on the lentil. It wasn't the
[2:00:31] chemistry of the blood. But when God saw
[2:00:34] the blood, it was more than a human
[2:00:36] microscope. in your laboratory. God was
[2:00:40] looking to the blood. There was a new
[2:00:42] blood. There was a newly creation blood.
[2:00:45] He's going to create blood. And in that
[2:00:47] blood will be no disease.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; And that blood will not be subjected to
[2:00:54] any disease.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; There'll be no homophobia. There'll be
[2:00:58] no anemia. There'll be no leukemia.
[2:01:01] There'll be no age. There'll be no
[2:01:02] disease in that blood.
[2:01:07] And I'm going to redeem the earth,
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; with this blood.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to redeem my sons and my
[2:01:15] daughters with this blood.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to paint the earth with this
[2:01:19] blood.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to bring every son and
[2:01:22] daughter back to the back to my house
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; with this blood.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No scientist and no doctor
[2:01:33] has ever looked at the blood like our
[2:01:35] father looked at the blood.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; When he looked at the blood, I tell you
[2:01:41] what, he saw every cell.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; And he saw a people that would have the
[2:01:47] DNA of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] And today I have the DNA of the Son of
[2:01:55] God.
[2:01:58] Every born again believer has a DNA of
[2:02:01] the image of God.
[2:02:05] Hallelujah.
[2:02:07] [Applause]
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; You can put yourself where you want but
[2:02:11] I put myself there.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I have his DNA
[2:02:15] and in every cell of your body is the
[2:02:18] image of your entire being is your is
[2:02:21] your code. every cell of your body and
[2:02:24] the DNA comes under the examination of
[2:02:26] their kind of microscope and every cell
[2:02:28] of your body carries every part of your
[2:02:32] whole molecular makeup.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; And just think of it when God saw the
[2:02:37] blood.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So when I see the blood,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; But he's looking to another day. He's
[2:02:47] looking to another time. He's looking to
[2:02:50] another blood.
[2:02:52] that was just in type. And once again,
[2:02:55] it was the blood of an animal that was
[2:02:57] transferred to the ground or to a basin.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; And that's blood from Genesis to
[2:03:03] Revelation.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But then came the lamb,
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; who God allowed Mary to eat of the
[2:03:12] substance of the earth, and a body was
[2:03:15] formed. But in that body was the life
[2:03:19] cell of Almighty God. was the blood of
[2:03:22] almighty God quad.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; And then that blood was transferred from
[2:03:27] the body exactly as Cain did to Abel. So
[2:03:31] did the Romans and the Jews do to Jesus
[2:03:34] Christ and transferred that blood from a
[2:03:37] body to the earth.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Where did the blood go? Blood went to
[2:03:42] the soil of the earth and bathed the
[2:03:44] earth. Yeah.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; But the spirit and the prophet says,
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; I have all of these quotes of the
[2:03:49] prophet says there's a a blood
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; and there's a life in the blood.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And the life that's in the blood
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; is the nature of the soul.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And that life that was in the blood is
[2:04:02] the token.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, not the blood itself,
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; but the blood is a sign. And when I see
[2:04:09] the sign, when I see the evidence that a
[2:04:13] life has been taken, then I'll pass over
[2:04:16] you. And in the New Testament is when I
[2:04:18] see the evidence that a life has
[2:04:20] returned.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Then I'll pass over you.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; The life that had been taken is
[2:04:31] returned.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to pass over you.
[2:04:36] And so
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; there is a process which I mentioned a
[2:04:40] lot earlier and I said it would mean
[2:04:41] something later on.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; There was a process by which the
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; the blood
[2:04:50] it was actually before it was blood it
[2:04:53] was word.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; God created all things by his word.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; And so it went from word to blood. Amen.
[2:05:02] Amen.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Animal blood that Abel transferred from
[2:05:06] an animal to the ground that Moses and
[2:05:09] the Israelites transferred from the
[2:05:11] animal to the ground. And uh and uh uh
[2:05:15] that was animal blood and a human blood
[2:05:18] that Cain transferred from Abel to the
[2:05:21] ground and the Romans and the Jews
[2:05:25] transferred from G the body of Jesus
[2:05:27] Christ to the ground.
[2:05:29] But they couldn't get at the life.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; The life went back down into the roots.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get at the life.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; When they wanted to stone him, they
[2:05:38] wanted to get at the life.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says, "They
[2:05:42] don't hate me. It's my message they
[2:05:43] hate.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's a message.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; You're nice people, but people don't
[2:05:48] want to believe what you believe."
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Because I have a problem with that,
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; but it's the life. And so now watch the
[2:05:54] transfer of the life. It went from the
[2:05:56] mouth of God from the word of God became
[2:05:59] substance and the substance some in
[2:06:01] type. And in Christ's case in reality
[2:06:04] the substance went to the earth from
[2:06:07] where it came. But God in his mind had a
[2:06:10] substance of such a construction and
[2:06:12] such a makeup such a marvel that it
[2:06:16] would intrigue all mankind.
[2:06:20] for the way of the the way of the blood,
[2:06:23] blood brothers, blood lines, all of
[2:06:25] these things. And then when Christ's
[2:06:28] blood was shed and he went to the tomb,
[2:06:31] the sephiler, and the spir holy spirit
[2:06:34] raised him, the same holy spirit that
[2:06:37] gave conception.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; For the holy spirit shall overshadow
[2:06:41] you, Mary,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; and that which is conceived in thee is
[2:06:45] of the holy ghost. So it was the life
[2:06:48] that conceived Christ.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; God's spirit
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; came and there was a conception in the
[2:06:55] womb of Mary and came Jesus and he died.
[2:06:58] He's in the sephiler. The same spirit
[2:07:01] raise him up again
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; out of the sear
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; and he comes before his disciples and
[2:07:07] he's and they said it's a spirit. He
[2:07:10] says the spirit hath not flesh and
[2:07:11] bones. He says nothing of blood.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; The blood was shed. have you anything to
[2:07:16] eat? They give him a honeycomb and some
[2:07:18] fish. He eats it and passes out of their
[2:07:21] out of their vision,
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; but it's not gone. He just passed out of
[2:07:24] their vision
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; of what they could see there, but he
[2:07:28] still was there.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; He just gone someplace.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I just tell
[2:07:38] you, I feel like doing a dance
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; before God. How great is our God?
[2:07:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; How magnificent. Who wouldn't want to
[2:07:49] serve this kind of God?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And then and then the life from the
[2:08:00] blood essentially. So they call it the
[2:08:03] blood because the very essence of the
[2:08:06] blood is transferred now and it come
[2:08:08] back down. It comes to word again.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word came into flesh
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; into the church.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; And the church became the living
[2:08:20] organism
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; of almighty God by the very substance of
[2:08:24] the blood
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; and man
[2:08:32] listen close now. And man in all of his
[2:08:37] uniqueness of his civilization
[2:08:40] and his advancement
[2:08:42] and the prophet took us through
[2:08:44] countdown how we've advanced with our
[2:08:48] inventions and civilization went on and
[2:08:51] on and we discovered all kinds of
[2:08:54] chemicals,
[2:08:56] all kinds of substances
[2:08:59] and all kinds of inventions.
[2:09:01] And the more we discovered,
[2:09:04] the prophet simply says, the more death
[2:09:06] came
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; and we went on the world, as Amos would
[2:09:15] see it, and I will say it today, it's
[2:09:18] gone on into its depth of its
[2:09:20] debauchery,
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; vile, unclean.
[2:09:26] So unclean it is that you can scarcely
[2:09:28] go to a supermarket to buy food for
[2:09:31] right there at the cash desk is all the
[2:09:33] unclean magazines which your children
[2:09:36] have to see. I say God save us
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; from this Sodom and Gomorrah.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that can save you
[2:09:45] except he left us a seed which is the
[2:09:48] word of God which has the blood.
[2:09:51] and when I see the blood, I'll pass over
[2:09:55] you.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And so he took the substance of the
[2:09:58] blood and put it back into word again.
[2:10:02] So a prophet at the end time would take
[2:10:04] and peel it all back and say, "Now here
[2:10:06] it is.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's a bleeding word.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Bleeding word."
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; And that word, I'll confirm that word in
[2:10:19] the mouth of a messenger. I'll confirm
[2:10:22] my word in the mouth of a prophet and it
[2:10:25] will work exactly as it's always worked.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; And the word has the blood in it.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; And that is what God is saying. When I
[2:10:35] see the blood,
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; When I see that blood, I'll pass over
[2:10:42] you.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; And while man advanced,
[2:10:47] he discovered that he was coming with
[2:10:49] new diseases.
[2:10:53] And the more they came, the more they
[2:10:56] must examine the blood.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, other parts of your body, but your
[2:11:01] blood.
[2:11:03] My doctor told me once, he said, "You
[2:11:06] can have all the stress tests. You can
[2:11:08] go through all of the test for your
[2:11:10] heart, but he said, he said, until they
[2:11:15] actually do a blood test, they cannot
[2:11:17] tell if you've had a heart attack. You
[2:11:20] can have a heart attack and it won't
[2:11:22] show anywhere else, but you can't fool
[2:11:25] the blood.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; It will show up in the blood.
[2:11:33] The earth is racked today.
[2:11:36] It's reeling under the impact of AIDS in
[2:11:40] our generation.
[2:11:43] In the United States,
[2:11:47] there was
[2:11:50] Uh
[2:11:54] just give me a moment.
[2:12:03] These are deaths
[2:12:06] in 2003.
[2:12:09] The cumulative estimated number of
[2:12:12] deaths of persons with AIDS through 2003
[2:12:18] is 524,060
[2:12:21] persons,
[2:12:22] including 518,568
[2:12:26] adults
[2:12:28] and adolescents
[2:12:30] and 5,492
[2:12:32] children under the age of 13.
[2:12:38] And the world being what they are
[2:12:41] in fact is
[2:12:46] there is just under
[2:12:50] world leaders at a special general
[2:12:53] assembly session on AIDS in June 2011
[2:12:56] pledged to halt and reverse by 2015 the
[2:13:01] pandemic
[2:13:03] that has cost 28
[2:13:06] million lives.
[2:13:09] 3.1 million last year alone.
[2:13:13] 28 million.
[2:13:17] That's over half the number that died in
[2:13:19] the entire Second World War.
[2:13:27] It's a disease of this age and of this
[2:13:30] generation. Why don't you just sit quiet
[2:13:33] now?
[2:13:35] It is a immune deficiency
[2:13:40] within the blood.
[2:13:42] And so a person who gets in that state
[2:13:45] and we've had a couple
[2:13:48] uh a couple brothers not not AIDS of
[2:13:51] course but from
[2:13:54] uh their blood became totally because
[2:13:57] they had to be treated and their blood
[2:14:00] became like 100% immune lack of
[2:14:04] immunity. no immunity left
[2:14:07] said you can't be at church you can't be
[2:14:09] around any people you can't because you
[2:14:11] have no immunity your immunity system
[2:14:13] we've had to give you l we've had to
[2:14:15] give you chemo therapy etc etc so man is
[2:14:19] doing everything that he can and we're
[2:14:21] not opposed to that we're happy that he
[2:14:23] does that but it's not the answer they
[2:14:26] don't have an answer and brother
[2:14:27] Brandham said in his message
[2:14:32] it's prophet optics
[2:14:35] I see diseases coming.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; That they'll find no remedy for.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; The United Nations can spend as many
[2:14:44] billions as they want. They'll find no
[2:14:46] remedy for it.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; And it is wreaking havoc. It's taking
[2:14:50] entire generations of people out of
[2:14:53] countries
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; in Africa,
[2:14:57] in other countries. It's taking entire
[2:14:59] generations
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; of young men and young women out of the
[2:15:05] society and setting those nations back
[2:15:07] many years.
[2:15:10] And it was civilization and the
[2:15:12] advancement and the lust for uh their
[2:15:17] lifestyle and whatever more and and
[2:15:20] because of the garden.
[2:15:22] What started in the garden can only end
[2:15:25] now in the most perverted form and they
[2:15:29] can say what they want but God has a
[2:15:31] sentence on it.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; And it's not a it's not a mystery that
[2:15:36] it comes to the blood.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:40] Okay, just stop.
[2:15:44] While all this advancement's been going
[2:15:45] on,
[2:15:48] the church has advanced.
[2:15:51] And while they advanced,
[2:15:54] the church started out having the word.
[2:15:59] I hope I have your attention.
[2:16:02] Having the word in it, the bleeding
[2:16:04] word.
[2:16:06] And man
[2:16:08] got involved.
[2:16:11] Man began to sew his thoughts and
[2:16:14] weakened the word and brought in false
[2:16:17] doctrine and brought in false teaching
[2:16:20] and the word and the church became
[2:16:22] immobilized
[2:16:24] and the church became sick and the
[2:16:27] church and finally a prophet comes in
[2:16:29] end time and peels it back with the
[2:16:32] optics and says you're anemic.
[2:16:36] you're pale.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with the blood.
[2:16:40] And you tried to tell them that they
[2:16:43] don't have they don't have the remedy
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; within the church. You don't have the
[2:16:48] remedy in the church. And your systems
[2:16:50] and your choirs and your great preachers
[2:16:52] and all of these things will not heal
[2:16:55] the church.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing, only one thing.
[2:16:59] It'll be a transfusion from Almighty God
[2:17:03] from Emmanuel's veins. And the blood of
[2:17:06] those veins came back into the word.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother and my sister,
[2:17:12] the blood today is nothing less than
[2:17:14] thus saith the Lord with God himself
[2:17:17] backing it up.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what people say,
[2:17:20] thus sayeth the Lord. I've heard lots of
[2:17:22] it. I've heard all kinds of prophecies
[2:17:24] that never happened.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And they can't come from God.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; And if you've heard them too, they did
[2:17:30] not come from God. God cannot proclaim a
[2:17:33] lie. He proclaims the truth.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; I need the support of this congregation
[2:17:40] because I told you before I started, the
[2:17:42] devil hates this subject. He hates the
[2:17:45] blood. But this blood of this word has
[2:17:48] signaled his defeat.
[2:17:51] And there's not a power in hell or on
[2:17:54] earth that can withstand this word.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; This word, this word is destined for
[2:18:01] eternity.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; This word has called the bride of Jesus
[2:18:05] Christ to a rapture.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; And it's the blood.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; That blood now has been transferred
[2:18:14] back.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it came from the Holy Spirit
[2:18:17] and gave life to the word.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; And the believer, the word was
[2:18:22] proclaimed through the mouth of a
[2:18:24] messenger. And by believing the word
[2:18:27] which is thus sayaith the Lord
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; through prophet optics. By believing it,
[2:18:33] you have the blood
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; of the covenant,
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; the blood of redemption.
[2:18:41] And the devil wants people to believe,
[2:18:43] ah, I don't have to believe that. I tell
[2:18:45] you, there is blood nowhere else.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; There were many messiahs in the time of
[2:18:52] Jesus Christ. There were many messiahs
[2:18:54] that had risen up. Many before, and
[2:18:56] there's been many since, but there was
[2:18:58] only one that had that blood in him.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; And this is the blood of the covenant.
[2:19:10] Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for having kept you,
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; but when you see the church in its
[2:19:16] anemic condition,
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; it's hemophilic uh uh just lost the name
[2:19:23] right now, but anemic condition and
[2:19:25] there's many anemic
[2:19:29] types of blood diseases
[2:19:32] and hemophilia.
[2:19:34] You have all of these things, but they
[2:19:37] would have their
[2:19:39] their equal within the whole church
[2:19:41] order. Tell me, what is a church without
[2:19:45] the blood of Jesus Christ?
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; What is a church? What is this building
[2:19:50] here? Nothing.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; This building would be a boore
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; without the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; What are we as a people without the
[2:19:58] purchased blood of Jesus Christ, the
[2:20:00] blood of redemption? We're nothing.
[2:20:02] We're lost decrepid humans
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; walking on the brittle threads of time.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; But when we can say, "I heard a voice.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; I heard thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet message." And he
[2:20:18] peeled back all of the mysteries and
[2:20:20] said, "Here it is, children. And if you
[2:20:23] believe it, you have life.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; And if you disbelieve it,
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; there's nothing but judgment."
[2:20:30] And the people said, "His blood be upon
[2:20:33] us and upon our children," said the
[2:20:37] Jews.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; And suffered incredible centuries
[2:20:43] because of that statement
[2:20:48] this morning.
[2:20:53] I just want to leave you with these
[2:20:56] thoughts.
[2:20:57] I want you to ponder them.
[2:20:59] And if God allows me, I will come back.
[2:21:02] I've been along.
[2:21:05] But Acts 2:28 says, "The church
[2:21:07] purchased with his blood."
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the chemistry. The chemistry is
[2:21:12] already in the ground.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; And Romans 3:25 says, "Through faith in
[2:21:17] his blood." Where's the blood? Do I have
[2:21:20] to try to have faith
[2:21:22] in the chemistry, the paint that went
[2:21:24] into the ground? No. God. He's got this
[2:21:28] process.
[2:21:29] It went from word into the into the body
[2:21:35] and from the body it was spilled.
[2:21:38] You know, it's strange. This is unique.
[2:21:40] Excuse me for carrying on. I realize I'm
[2:21:42] long, but this time you won't tell me to
[2:21:45] preach longer.
[2:21:50] go from the mind of God and he creates
[2:21:53] that blood in Abel
[2:21:57] and Cain transfers it from Abel to the
[2:22:00] ground. And notice what God says soon as
[2:22:03] he comes. He comes to Cain says the
[2:22:07] voice
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; of your brother's blood
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; crith to me.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:16] didn't say the head that you struck or
[2:22:19] the bones that you broke or whatever
[2:22:22] other member of his body for he is made
[2:22:25] up like you and I. God made no reference
[2:22:28] to any other injury of this man or how
[2:22:32] he was slain. But he said the voice
[2:22:36] [Applause]
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; of the blood,
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; there was something in there. You'll
[2:22:40] never find that voice in a microscope.
[2:22:44] But the word of God speaks about it.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[2:22:48] of all the martyrs, of all the martyrs
[2:22:50] that stood for the word, that have been
[2:22:52] slaying, their voice, I don't care
[2:22:54] whether they've been burned or drowned
[2:22:55] or eaten by lions and gone out in their
[2:22:57] waste, the voice of their blood sounds
[2:23:00] on and continues to speak
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; and it says something significant.
[2:23:08] and way over into the New Testament
[2:23:09] speaks of the same blood of Abel
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; that the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh
[2:23:15] better things.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; So even though the blood spoke out of
[2:23:20] the ground to God, God within his great
[2:23:23] infinite mercy, it's all right, Abel.
[2:23:26] It's all right. It's all right. You're
[2:23:28] in paradise. But there's coming another
[2:23:30] blood that'll replace yours, that'll
[2:23:33] speak better things. There's coming a
[2:23:35] blood of perfection. There's coming a
[2:23:37] blood of a such an insignificant I mean
[2:23:40] such incredible power that nothing can
[2:23:42] overcome the power of this blood.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; And my friends
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; whatever you want to think of me is
[2:23:52] fine. But when we've heard a message
[2:23:54] today we say I've heard a message. I've
[2:23:57] heard a voice.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; I want to close by making announcement
[2:24:02] to you. You have heard the voice
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; of the blood
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Crying
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; from the ground,
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; transferred into the church and came out
[2:24:25] through a mouth of his messenger. You
[2:24:27] have heard the voice of the blood of
[2:24:30] Jesus Christ.
[2:24:32] Hallelujah.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know what that does to you, but
[2:24:36] I tell you what, it brings Jesus Christ
[2:24:38] right here. I just feel like I want to
[2:24:39] embrace him and hug him and wash his
[2:24:42] feet and kiss his feet. Oh, how we love
[2:24:45] him.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; This blessed lamb of God.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; How we give him all praise and all
[2:24:52] glory.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you stand?
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to feel free.
[2:25:01] This is not a church building where we
[2:25:02] just come to have a meeting. This is
[2:25:04] where we come to worship him.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Sister Beth, I didn't see you. God bless
[2:25:12] you. Here we have talking about her and
[2:25:14] here she is sitting in the in the
[2:25:16] church. Hallelujah.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood will never lose its power.
[2:25:23] No, never. No, never. Do you think you
[2:25:27] could sing it appropriately today? Jesus
[2:25:29] blood will never lose its power.
[2:25:31] Hallelujah.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Have you heard his voice?
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus blood.
[2:25:41] [Music]
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Let me hear it. No never.
[2:25:51] No never.
[2:25:53] [Applause]
[2:25:54] My Jesus blood
[2:25:58] for sin forever
[2:26:02] and will never
[2:26:09] my Jesus
[2:26:11] will never lose his power.
[2:26:16] No,
[2:26:20] no, never.
[2:26:23] My Jesus blood
[2:26:26] forever
[2:26:30] and will never
[2:26:32] [Music]
[2:26:40] for it reaches
[2:26:43] the highest
[2:26:45] mountain.
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:50] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:26:54] [Applause]
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:09] [Music]
[2:27:13] Let our sisters lift it up.
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:27] Oh,

[2:27:37] great.
[2:27:39] [Music]

[2:27:42] [Music]
[2:27:48] All the brothers.
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:28:00] Oh,

[2:28:23] give him praise now.
[2:28:27] A
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:37] [Applause]
[2:28:39] Heat.
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:50] Heat.
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:59] will never
[2:29:01] [Music]
[2:29:05] once again
[2:29:19] [Applause]
[2:29:25] flow.
[2:29:27] bountiful flow of Calvary
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; and it has reached even to us.
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God
[2:29:42] somehow I pray that this very atmosphere
[2:29:47] will just continue on throughout the day
[2:29:51] and may the people return. May the
[2:29:54] spirit, oh God, the Holy Spirit who has
[2:29:57] give authorship to the word of God that
[2:30:00] the word that is a bleeding word,
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; how we thank you for it today. We thank
[2:30:05] you for your word. We thank you for all
[2:30:08] of the examples that you have left and
[2:30:10] how it has been opened up, Lord, and how
[2:30:12] you have allowed us to peer through
[2:30:15] prophet optics and to see things we
[2:30:18] could in no wise see any other way. And
[2:30:22] Lord, we give you praise as a company of
[2:30:25] people today. We say, "Praise be to God
[2:30:29] who has done this glorious thing."
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; And you hear the voice of the blood of
[2:30:33] Jesus Christ. And we have heard that
[2:30:36] voice.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; And it has said spoke glorious things to
[2:30:41] us.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; You're justified.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, the voice says you're justified.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; The blood says you're justified. The
[2:30:50] blood says there's no sin against you.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; The blood says you're without spot and
[2:30:55] without wrinkle. The blood has spoken.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless your name, Lord.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; We give you praise.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; I ask that the people, Lord, will be
[2:31:10] able to
[2:31:12] depart this place and remain in a sacred
[2:31:16] atmosphere.
[2:31:18] I pray, oh God, that you'll send us now
[2:31:22] that we may be refreshed and return this
[2:31:25] evening.
[2:31:27] Anoint our brother Ernie mightily. I
[2:31:29] pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:31:36] Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] Hallelujah.
[2:31:40] Isn't it a marvelous sacred atmosphere?
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:46] and marvelous friends. I hope you'll
[2:31:48] take these things
[2:31:50] just honestly in the depths of my heart.
[2:31:54] I've been just
[2:31:56] so
[2:31:58] getting so deep that just I it it trails
[2:32:02] off and I lose it. I just lose the
[2:32:05] depths of it.
[2:32:07] Greater depths.
[2:32:09] I feel like there's just so much out
[2:32:13] there. And I would encourage you, each
[2:32:16] one, reach out there and lay hold of it.
[2:32:19] Say, "God,
[2:32:21] make a reality to me what brother Biscll
[2:32:24] couldn't even say this morning. Make it
[2:32:26] a reality to me. Don't let me just and
[2:32:28] don't let yourself be satisfied just to
[2:32:30] hear, you know, the words that I've
[2:32:31] uttered. But may you say, there's some
[2:32:33] depths there that go beyond what he
[2:32:35] could utter, and only the Holy Spirit
[2:32:37] knows those." And place it into my
[2:32:40] heart, oh God, in the name of Jesus
[2:32:42] Christ. I tell you, my friends, there's
[2:32:44] coming a day very, very soon. We're not
[2:32:46] going to be here anymore. You're going
[2:32:47] to be swept out of here. Redeemed,
[2:32:50] redeemed, redeemed by that blood,
[2:32:52] redeemed by that bleeding word. I say,
[2:32:55] God bless you in the name of Jesus
[2:32:57] Christ. And go
[2:33:00] be refreshed. And we'll see you this
[2:33:02] evening. Lord willing, you're dismissed.
[2:33:05] God bless you.
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:12] Hallelujah.
