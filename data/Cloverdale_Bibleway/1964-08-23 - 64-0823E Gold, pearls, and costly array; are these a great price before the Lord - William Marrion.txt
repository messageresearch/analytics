TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now uh brother Brandon questions should a Christian woman wear simple jewelry as necklaces or pearls well a sister I know this means a lot to you and it means a lot for me for you to place your confidence I tell you the truth now remember the Bible said when you Adorn do not adorn with with costly jewels and pearls and all kinds of wearing of jewelry but let that be the adorning of a peace and quiet Meek Spirit which I just quoted which is a great price before the Lord now I don't mean by that sister that if you had a pen this is me not the Lord if you had a pen that you wanted to wear or a little necklace your husband give you or maybe your something like that that you wore now to me I don't think that's bad now that's just me I remember I make myself clear that's my opinion but I think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it see it's the motive behind it and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone but I think if you wore your wedding ring I know you Nazarene people it used to be that you wouldn't even baptize a woman with a wedding ring on see I don't believe that it's necessary in the Bible they wore wedding rings on it was a tablet they called it around their head nine pieces of coin in it but I to show they were married now I think that's all right if women want to dress and and make themselves uh look decent clean ladylike well I think there's not a thing to that to me but when you get to go to put that thing into making a little Pride then you're wrong it's your attitude do you women remember here not long ago they had what they call Scandal skirts I think they're coming out again or they got wor be they're scandalist now instead of Scandal but they used to have a play back not long ago they had the girls young women and of course the old ones do it too cuz they're all want to be young I don't mean you sisters I mean the women of the world and they' cut their their skirt up high about a foot high every time then wear some kind of underne garment looked pretty and when they would make a step it would show this underneath garment with lace and Frills or whatever it was on it which you know um there's a a girl come to me which is a dunker girl had just received the Holy Ghost she belonged to Assemblies of God and that was in Fort Wayne Indiana where I was married at and she come to me a fine little lady and she said brother brandom I want to ask you a question I said all right sister what is it she said do you think it's wrong for a girl to Christian girl to wear a scandal skirt I said sister this is one thing I I just can't understand what is a scandal skirt and she told me what it was I he said it shows the underskirt I said what what is in a woman that would make her want to show her underneath clothes to some man what would what what business has a Christian girl got doing a thing like that could you imagine a Christian now look a man there's not much to him when it comes to a body and he if he went half naked it would there would be no Scandal to it not holding for man but the you know that what kind of a woman would be tempted by a man with his shirt off and shorts on or whatever he had the big old Burly looking thing it looks sloppy and sickly ey horrible see these men out here at I think it' make a woman Bonnet to look at such a thing and she had but now you take a woman in putter like that that's a different Temple you understand all right but I think as far as a necklace or now if you go to load yourself up like you went through the 10- cent store down here with a magnet on you I I think excuse that I didn't mean to say that like that but that that's wrong
