TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Saint in your position. Watch the miraculous come into action. My God is tremendous. His strength never failth. He goes through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty. He sends his angels to guide me. There is no storm too powerful. My God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity revealing you and me came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest goal. Just one more time. My God is tremendous. My God is tremendous. His strength never failth. He goes through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty. He sends his angels to guide me. There is no storm that my God cannot handle. My God in simplicity revealed in you and me came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest love story. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's my God. My God is tremendous. Hallelujah. Even a little testimony last night. A young man in our cabin began to be struck with a seizure and it woke me up. I got down with him. I just laid my hands on and just began to say the name of Jesus and within seconds that seizure stopped. He just continued to breathe labor and I just began to sing there's power in the name of Jesus. Within two minutes he was completely peaceful and God had changed the situation. I said that's the power of my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise our God. There is power in the name of Jesus. We don't have to bow down to those spirit saints. We know that seizure is a demon that has to bow before the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, is there a need on your heart that you just need to speak the name of Jesus over? Tonight, we're going to ask the brothers to come. We're going to have an offering this meeting. Our brother Tom's going to come. I felt maybe we should sing that song. There is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain. I believe we've been hearing chains break this weekend already. We hear him hit the ground and hands that are free have been lifted in worship to our God. And hearts that were bound, amen, have been set free to worship our God. And he's not done. He has something he wants to do tonight for you saints. Hallelujah. Let's just worship him together as we sing this. We do have a prayer request. A sister that's just asked to remain anonymous has just asked that we'd please remember the family of a young man named Juan who's just passed away. And as they are grieving during this time, that God would just be with them, be a comfort to them, and make himself known to them. And how we would just desire the prayers of the saints if we were in that situation. So, let's remember this family tonight. If there's a need on your heart, just as we would go to prayer and the brothers would come, let's sing this. There is power in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, there is power in the name of Jesus. There is power. &gt;&gt; There is power. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. In the name of Jesus, there is power in the name of Jesus. To break every chain to break every chain. Break every chain. to break every chain. Break every chain. Break it. Let's sing that chorus again. Let's pick it up. Oh, there is power. Oh, in the name of Jesus. There is power. Oh yes. In the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus special that had had a chain. Let's sing that again. Break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. There is power. There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. Part of our worship is our giving. And the brothers have now put the different tables out as you enter the uh tent. And there are um envelopes made available to everyone if you'd like to put uh something in that and mark it to where you'd like it to go. But we would like to um give an offering of course to the servants of God and how that he has been used by God and we want to show our appreciation and we have uh we have over the years young people at winter camp and summer camp. This is a part of our worship. Don't expect your mommy and daddy to do it. That is not your sacrifice. That is not your offering and that's not your giving. You need to be able to dig deep and say, "Lord, I want to give a part of my worship, &gt;&gt; what substance you give me." &gt;&gt; And if you if you can sacrifice for God, that's what you should do and learn early and watch God come behind and and and and show his blessing upon your life. But we don't do it for the blessing. We do it because it's a commandment in the scripture. And don't and and don't just put it off. You should be a willing giver. A willing giver to the kingdom of God. And so we just want to ask the Lord just to to bless this service, bless this meeting, and bless this offering to the Lord. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our dear heavenly father, we've been amazed at the moving of the Holy Spirit. how you've taken men of God to minister deeply to the lives and the hearts of your children. And Lord Jesus, as we even heard this morning, you've called kings to battle, and we're willing to do battle this evening. We're willing to stand on the word of God. As brother Spencer said last night, we're willing to mark the spot where you've dealt with us and moved upon our lives. And so, Lord, I'm asking that you will move once again, anointing your servant to minister life to your people. Break the bread of life to us. Lord, feed the hungry, Lord. Break the bread. &gt;&gt; Heal the sick. &gt;&gt; Deliver the needy. Lord, &gt;&gt; you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. A family is grieving. They've lost someone, a loved one. Lord, would you pour in the grace to them this evening? But as the scripture says to the believer, we do not grieve as others. We have a promise of the resurrection. And so, Lord, we pray that you'll deal with that family that they would have a hope within the resurrection, our Lord Jesus Christ. And so, Lord, a part of our worship tonight is in our giving. And we just pray, Lord, that you will bless those that have given to the kingdom. They haven't given it to man, but they've given it to you, Lord. Would you multiply it? And God, may you be glorified through it, Lord. Bless these young people as they learn not only to worship in the natural, but they're willing to worship in their giving. Lord bless each and everyone as we commit now this offering to you and this evening service in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. You can keep on playing. Brother Ben, I'd like to make a a couple of announcements as we are um having a special I believe. Uh, Sister Hannah and Ava, you'll be ready, if you wouldn't mind, to come up and be ready after I'm finished these announcements. I'd like to make a quick announcement regarding the home church. On Sunday, last Sunday, we had suggested that those that were unable to come across the border that we would open the church and we would have um a streaming there. But we have our own challenges and it's a streaming challenge even here. And so, uh, we won't be able to have the church open. And so, those that will be streaming this evening at your home, um, and you can't make it, it would be best then, to stream in your own residence, mark that down. And if you know of somebody that is not able to come across that you'd get a hold of them and let them know that there will not be streaming at the local church on this Sunday. On Sunday, uh the our last service, the campgrounds is open for all those that want to stay and have a have a picnic or time to fellowship with one another. the um the eating hall is only open to those that are registered campers here at at uh at the camp. Um I'm sorry to we would love to feed everybody if it was possible, but the uh kitchen only has limited amount of of space, limited amount of equipment, just limited amount that we can only feed so many. So there are those maybe that have been eating with with the campers over this week and we'd again we'd love to have you but it's impossible to feed everybody. We have some more people coming from um uh the local assembly onto grounds this this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon being that it's a weekend a long weekend. So if you're not a registered camper on grounds there are restaurants down the road. Uh Cloud9 is one that uh I've eaten with the brothers. It's It's fine. That's good. Um and if if you need to go towards Bellingham, there's many restaurants down that way. Um I think that's it for those announcements. We have uh a precious brother Stephen from Malawi that has come and he's here this this service and I believe he's standing in the back. Brother Steven, we'd like you to stand, please. We'd like to acknowledge you. Welcome. God bless you, Brother Steven. Many years have gone by. Brother Biscll was saying that you were in the meetings when Brother Ed was in in Zimbabwe and now you're here these many years. We we're happy to see you. Happy to have you with us this evening. God bless you and all those that have joined from Edmonton, from all the provinces, from Europe, from the States. God bless you. We've had a wonderful time. We've had a wonderful camp. Now, we had a wonderful day today, young people. Nobody got killed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, a lot of people will never understand that statement because they were not here and we don't want to let them know what we did. But Sister Joanne breathes uh a lot easier today knowing that nobody got hurt, everybody was fine, and we had a wonderful time. Now, if you took that amount of energy that was spent today and brought it to camp tonight, What kind of a service, brother Sam, would we have? &gt;&gt; So, I I don't want to see anybody sleeping or nodding off that energy that I saw and you know, I went to every station and we checked you out and if you could do that for natural enjoyment, we are here to put in our best &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God. So, I say God bless you and God bless this uh time that we've had together and welcome everyone that has made this meeting possible. Hannah, Ava, and whoever else is uh singing, would you please come? God bless you. Be pulling on the word tonight. Our dear brother Ron Spencer will be ministering this evening. He won't need uh any introduction. He's going to come straight to the pulpit and God is going to use the man of God to minister to every heart. So, God bless you. When I'm feeling afraid, full of uncertainties, when the plans that I made all fall apart when the future's unclear. And all that I can do is wait. There is a promise echoing in my heart. that he will be faithful to the end. He will provide time and time again. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. He will be there when all else fades. His love is stronger than my pain. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. There is grace I can't measure. Mercy I don't deserve. There's forgiveness that's endless for me. Oh, what a blessed assurance to know how deeply I'm loved. And I'm always reminded he will be all I need. All I need. faithful to the end. He will provide time and time again. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. He will be there when all else fades. His love is stronger than my pain. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. He will be faithful to the end. He will provide time and time again. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. He will be there when all else fades. His love is stronger than my pain. He will be faithful. faithful to the end. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. He will be faithful, faithful to the end. Amen. Thank you, sisters. We're going to ask the young people to come. from uh the young people from Edmonton if they would come and sing for us. Uh maybe as they do, let's just sing Faithful One. So unchanging. Amen. You can just come immediately and start getting ready if you don't mind. Faithful one, so unchanging. You are the ageless one. You're my rock of peace. Lord of all, I depend on you. I call out to you again and again, Lord. I call out to you, again and again. For you are my rock. Oh, for you are my rock in times of trouble. You lift me up when I fall down all through the storm. Your love is the anchor. My hope is in you alone. live a perfect life. He came to be the living word out loud. He came to die so we be reconiled. He came to rise to show his power and might. That's why we praise him. That's why we sing. That's why we offer him our everything. That's why we bow down and worship this king. Cuz he gave his everything. Cuz he gave his everything. He came to live, live again in us. He came to be our conquering king. with the bread. He came to heal and show the lost ones his love. He came to go, prepare a place for us. That's why we praise him. That's why we sing. That's why we offer him our bow down and worship his king. Cuz he gave his everything. Cuz he gave his everything. Halle Halleluah. Halleluah. Halleluah. Halle Hallelu. That's why we praise him. That's why we sing. That's why we offer him our everything. That's why we bow down and worship this king. Cuz he gave his everything. Cuz he gave his everything.

Cuz he gave his everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. So can we worship him? He gave everything for us. Surely we can do the same for him. Let's sing the great emancipator as we just turn the service now to our brother Ron as he would just like to come at this time. Once my heart and soul were fed. Amen. There we go. Oh, once my heart and soul were fed. Yes. By the binding chains of sin. Oh yes, but but the great emanipator, he set me free to worship him. Oh glory, glory, glory, hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name. I know he's the great emanipator. That's the song of the redeemer. Amen. And like a lost lamb. And like a lost lamb, I was drifting. I was oh so helpless and alone. But the seeking shepherd, but the seeking shepherd found me. Amen. He led me to led me to my father's home. Oh, worshiping saints. Glory, glory. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah. Oh, blessed be his holy name. Yes, he's the great emancipator. And that's the song of Oh, one more time. Glory, glory. Let's just worship him. Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah.

Hallelujah. What a night. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe if Satan knew what was good for him, he'd leave the building now. &gt;&gt; Could we amen that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you had a great day? &gt;&gt; Well, I've enjoyed watching you put forth incredible efforts today. &gt;&gt; I've enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; So, in turn, I'm going to enjoy watching you put forth incredible effort tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So th this is how this works. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll push and you pull. &gt;&gt; And I'll push and you pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I I believe I've got some good ones on the other end of the line now tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come expecting something from him? I walked into the service this evening expecting great things. &gt;&gt; Absolutely great things. Amen. Amen. Could we talk to him just now? Heavenly Father, we bow our heads before you now and we would like to express how much we love you. But our human vocabulary is just not enough. We'd like to tell you how sorry we are for our mistakes and failures and sins. We'd like to thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ that you have provided for us. Lord, we'd like to thank you for this opportunity. another opportunity to stand in your presence in this realm of human instrumentality. Now Lord, this is an opportunity that that all of hell would like to have if they could have the opportunity to step back into this in this arena to hear one more sermon. Just to hear one more sermon. and have an opportunity to make a another choice. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; but there's another dimension that is screaming, a higher dimension screaming. &gt;&gt; They kept the faith. &gt;&gt; They ran the race with everything that was within them. &gt;&gt; And they're screaming for us to finish this race. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I ask you that you would sweep across this audience. Yes, God. &gt;&gt; May may the mighty angels of God sweep into this building tonight. And &gt;&gt; Lord, drive back every enemy of doubt and frustration and fear and unbelief tonight. And I ask you that you would come in a mighty way. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've dealt with me in a specific way for this service. And and I ask you now that you would focus our mind and our heart and all of our thoughts even now. &gt;&gt; Not about tomorrow or next week or the coming weeks, but &gt;&gt; about where we're standing right now. &gt;&gt; May you just allow us to stand in an eternal bubble just for a bit &gt;&gt; and you speak to our hearts, Father. &gt;&gt; May it be you, Father. May you borrow our bodies as our prophet would say. Give us a temporary resurrection. Lord, speak to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Bless the ministry that is here. Bless brother Biscll. Give him strength this afternoon. Sister Bisll. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we're thinking of Brother Ken Ber and Sister Shalley tonight. &gt;&gt; Father, you're greater. &gt;&gt; You're greater than tumors and cancers. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're greater than all of that tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; So, we tell Satan, turn him loose &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's defeated by the power of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for these things. And we thank you, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. I'd like to turn to Isaiah chapter 65 this afternoon. Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16. I would like to speak to you tonight on music through the hurt. Music through the hurt. I'd like to take your mind to I Isaiah's life for a moment. This is a man that's going to face much rejection through his life. This is a man that will be commissioned to lay naked at the gate of the city, not for a day, but for many, many, many, many, many days. This is a man that will be saw aunder. But God will allow him to write some of the most beautiful words, not of literature, but prophetic words. Sometimes we look at the results and we want to see results, but I'd like to read to you results for a little bit and go backwards if I may. &gt;&gt; Would that be okay? &gt;&gt; All right. Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16. That he who blessth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he that swearth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth, because the former troubles are forgotten, &gt;&gt; because they are hid from mine eyes. For behold, I create new heavens and new earth, and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mine. &gt;&gt; But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For behold, I created Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people of joy, and I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and and enjoy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall be found no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thin of infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, but the sinner be 100 years old shall be accursed. And they shall build houses and inhabit them. &gt;&gt; They shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another inhabit. They shall not plant and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall enjoy the the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble, for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them. &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer. &gt;&gt; And while they are speaking, I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock, and the dust shall be the serpent's meat. And they shall not hurt, nor destroy in my holy mountain, saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's talking about you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. in Revelations chapter 19. I'd like to read in more scripture about you. This writing comes from a man that's in prison, the worst prison of that day. It's an exile. It's a prison that where that he has been boiled in all. It's a prison to where that there's every kind of a viper and all kinds of spiders and some of the worst prisoners in the entire world are very dear to near to him. But he is commissioned to come up with them &gt;&gt; and to come and see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He is brought to a realm to where that he can write prophetic things. Right. &gt;&gt; Though his body be trapped in a prison, yet in that realm, &gt;&gt; he can write. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear him write about you just now. And I heard it was a voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many waters, as a voice of mighty thunderings, saying, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reignth." Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife &gt;&gt; hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lambus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With all your critics &gt;&gt; and all the tormentors that have been against you through your life &gt;&gt; and the scars that you have been through in your life and the whispers that have been in your ear over and over and over again. And if you could have a volume button, you'd like to cut them down. I want to say this to you. God writes you a love letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sings to you, "Blessed are ye because you're called to the marriage supper of the lamb." &gt;&gt; Revelations 21:1, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard it, a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, &gt;&gt; and be their God, &gt;&gt; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, &gt;&gt; neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain. &gt;&gt; For the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, rot, for these words are true and faithful. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to remember the author behind the author. &gt;&gt; It's the one that said, "Let there be son." and moon and stars, right? &gt;&gt; And God believed his own word and it came into existence. &gt;&gt; This is the God that is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. He knows what you've been through in your life and he knows where you've came from and where you're going. He's got the whole world in his hands. He is in complete control of everything in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a promise. &gt;&gt; This is my future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. &gt;&gt; I'm going to a place where there's no more death. &gt;&gt; Grass won't die. Trees won't die. Leaves won't wither. &gt;&gt; Flowers will never fade away again. &gt;&gt; I'll never have another gray hair. &gt;&gt; Never have n of glasses. &gt;&gt; Never have aching bones. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I'm headed to a place that God made me a promise. And the same God that allowed me to to enjoy salvation here on this earth, to know that my sins are forgiven &gt;&gt; and that I can live in perfect peace in this earth. &gt;&gt; When you can come to a spot to where that you realize that your sins are forgiven &gt;&gt; and he paid the price of your redemption, you can live in perfect peace. The same God that said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; And that said, "I'm going to have a place where there's no more death and no more sorrow." Can stand there tonight and say, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; We do not have to constantly relive sin in our lives. &gt;&gt; We do not constantly have to fall and get back up again. We do not constantly have to be beat over the head by the tormentor. We can live in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not a slave to sin no longer. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story of let it for pressure. He said as a little rabbit. The story the hounds was right behind him. He could feel their hot breath upon his feet. Just a little while, another jump jump or two, the hound was going to get the little fella. He would be gobbled up in just a moment. But after a bit, he saw a hole in the rock and he thought, "If I could only get to that rock, then I'm safe." Just as a dog made a last jump at him, he felt his hot breath on his heels, but he run under the rock. Then he could set down and let off the pressure. The hound could not scratch through that rock. &gt;&gt; We have a rock of ages tonight that's greater than the rock of Jibralta. &gt;&gt; In this rock of ages, you're safe. &gt;&gt; In this rock of ages, God has made a covenant with you to take care of you. &gt;&gt; I'd like to share this with you tonight. I find it incredible. Interesting. Brother Brandham talks about in thirsting for life in Phoenix, Arizona. He said, 'If we could take a trip tonight and go up to heaven, and I'd meet with Father Abraham and I'd say, Abraham, what is the most glorious thing that you have ever known? What's the most essential thing that you have ever known? And Abraham would say to me, "Life eternal." &gt;&gt; And then I take a little trip and we'll go again and we'll go around to the great archangel Gabriel who is the messenger of the covenant to the Jewish people who stands at the right hand of God, one of the highest order of angels in heaven. And I would say to him, Gabriel, thou art a mighty angel. You're loved of God. And you've been here for the eons of time. And you perhaps know everything in the heavens. And where everything is placed, think of this conversation now. You're one of God's right-hand angels. You know the great secrets of heaven. You sounded the trumpet at the coming of the Lord Jesus. You announced the his first coming and you shall announce his second coming. You must be a mighty man or angel. I want to ask you in all of God's treasures, what is the greatest thing that you have found amongst his treasures? And I can see Gabriel bring himself to attention. He said, "The greatest thing that I found in all of God's great treasures since he created me is life. God made me to live eternal for eternity and life is the greatest thing that there is. &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you may be or how popular you may be, no matter how you might be, the greatest thing that there is is that a man can achieve in this earth is to achieve eternal life. Though you might be a king or a potentate, though you rule the world for a million years as a king or a young man and you fail to find eternal life, you've lost the greatest thing that anyone can lose. I've often said if I could be a young man of 25 years old and if God would appear on the platform tonight and say I will turn you to 25 years of age and there you'll remain for a million years and I'll make you king over all the universe. Everything will be at your command or I'll give you a hundred years of misery and woe and trouble and sorrow. But at the end of that hundred years, &gt;&gt; I'll give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; But at the end of the million years, you are lost. Oh, I'd say, Lord God, don't I don't have to wait no longer to make my choice. &gt;&gt; Let me have a hundred years of misery and woe and &gt;&gt; any kind of death that you choose for me to die only. Lord, give me eternal life. That's what we're under this tent for tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for riches or fame or I'm not looking for great popularity. I have a great desire for eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Couple of years ago, my mother who believed this message with all her heart, love this message with everything that was within her. She had a heart attack. And I was at her side. Brother Andrew was at her side. We got there and she was coding. Great doctors were working on her and they were telling us there's just nothing we can do. There's just absolutely nothing we can do. And she was as conscious as I'm conscious now. And she was as in control as I'm in control now. And she began to speak not about what she missed out in life. But she began to speak about her love for Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is what I've lived for. &gt;&gt; The doctor told her one more time, Christine, I have to ask you, can I put you on a machine that you might live and we could hold try to hold your life? And she said these words, "I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; And in that moment, she slipped into another dimension. &gt;&gt; It was not a defeat. &gt;&gt; I want you to know tonight, it was not a defeat. It was a victory. &gt;&gt; She stepped out of an old body into a brand new body. &gt;&gt; Everything that this message says is reality. And she stepped into another realm where there's no death, where there's no sorrow. &gt;&gt; Services like tonight are preparing us for that moment. If I could ask you tonight, he shared a few of these comments in Edmonton, but if I could ask you tonight, God who predestinated you before the foundation of the world, if you could have a conversation with you and call your name, Let me tell you, Sister Tracy, this will be a time to which I'm going to release you into the earth. You'll be born at a certain time in Leoa. It's going to be the darkest age. It's going to be a It's going to be an age full of sin. It's going to be an age to which that insanity is just going to almost rule the world. It's going to be age to where that become no right, no wrong. It's going to be an age of incredible perversion. It's going to be an age of the even the the church world won't even know where they stand. But I'm going to allow you to be born on a certain day at a certain time. &gt;&gt; I'm going to watch over your seed all the way through. &gt;&gt; And when you're born, I'm going to watch over you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to protect you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be with you. &gt;&gt; And there's some things that you've got to go through in life, but I'm going to be with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you word that I'm going to sustain you with. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There will be a season to which that you will feel alienated from the commonwealth of God, but you always will be a seed. &gt;&gt; You always will be a son. &gt;&gt; But there will come a day that you recognize where you came from and where you're going. young man, young woman from that dimension. If he could have that conversation with you, he could talk to you about what you will develop while you're here. It'll be the development of character. By developing your character, you'll be fit to reign. &gt;&gt; You'll be born with complexes. You'll be born with fears. You'll be born with natural anxieties in your life. Your greatest battle will be in your mind. But I'm going to equip you with something. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you my word. &gt;&gt; And this word is not a word that has to evolve. But I'm going to give you my word that will sustain you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You remember just a few moments ago I wrote to you I told you about Isaiah. &gt;&gt; We could just we could just think about this just for a moment. It comes a time to where the prophet writer comes into fellowship with the author. And as a man, he would like to have perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ and not have to wrestle with his humanity of feeling lost. His humanity of of more than turtle doves and bullock and offering of sacrifice of doves. this humanity of of as becoming an old man and feeling weak. Now God allows him to step into a channel to where that God allows him to begin to speak of a kinsman redeemer. Now he'll scream it out and it'll be read by literally billions on the earth. He is despised and rejected of men. A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. He'll understand what I'm going through. &gt;&gt; He'll understand my deep scars. He'll understand the depth of my anxieties. You'll be acquainted with my grief. We did. We hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised. We esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs. &gt;&gt; This is not only prophetic. In one sense, he's to come, but it's prophetic for us to grab a hold of it and say, "He took my pain for me." &gt;&gt; I just pray I can grip this audience tonight. Whatever turmoil that you're going through now that you're wrestling with, young people, God knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could talk of the fox's book of martyrs which is beyond belief &gt;&gt; of what people have had to go through &gt;&gt; saw us under &gt;&gt; stoned burn at the state &gt;&gt; murdered for the gospel of Jesus Christ. And they could look at this scripture. God paid the price for this. &gt;&gt; In my deepest heartache and agony, I've got a I've got a savior. &gt;&gt; My heart is torn, but I've got a savior that has paid the price for me. &gt;&gt; And I can get through this. &gt;&gt; I want to speak this to you. You can get through this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I feel so alone. You don't know what I heard. I can't share it with nobody else. You can get through this. &gt;&gt; I've got some deep darkness in my life. I can't tell a soul, Jesus knows. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows. Brother Ron, I've got loved ones that it seems absolutely impossible. He sent a word to you tonight. He's on the scene and he knows how to come to their case. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7. that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth. Though it be tried with fire, might be found into the praise and the honor and the glory of the appearing of Jesus Christ. the trial of your faith. &gt;&gt; It's not the faith of God. It's your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God's got confidence in his seed, brother Matt. &gt;&gt; And things beyond our control. I don't know why I picked him, but I believe God knows things beyond our control. &gt;&gt; God is saying tonight, I got this. &gt;&gt; I got this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Job, he'd be a good testimony for us. &gt;&gt; But he knoweth the way that I take. &gt;&gt; And when he hath tried me, &gt;&gt; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth &gt;&gt; as go. Revelation chapter 3, which be a theme of your church age book. I counsel thee to buy of me. Go try it in a fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eyes, that thou mayest see. &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said overcome is recognize Satan and his trick and overcome him. &gt;&gt; You're an invincible army. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's more than a statement. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God's given you a word that you can overcome in this day. &gt;&gt; We're more than some rehab center. &gt;&gt; We're more than some sinner where you learn to live with your devils. &gt;&gt; We're more than some social gospel gathering. We have been sent here with a message that said she's the final voice to the final age. and she will overcome. &gt;&gt; I would say this to you. This has been my banner. Refuse to give up. &gt;&gt; There is no going back. &gt;&gt; I've never had a day where I said I just quit. If I've got Jesus on my side, I am a victor every day of my life. It may not look like it. It may not feel like it. &gt;&gt; But I don't care what the devil says, Brother Steven. We're more than conquerors through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; The song says, "Onward, Christian soldiers." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. 1 John chapter 4 and verse4. Is this all right? Year of God, little children. Listen, I don't have to hear anymore. Year of God, &gt;&gt; Tim. God, you're of God. &gt;&gt; John Andy's year of God. &gt;&gt; And when God says that, I don't even need no negotiations with the devil. If I came from God, I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; And you become Satan's worst nightmare on the earth because that's where you came from and that's where you're heading. &gt;&gt; You have got little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. God's greater than every temptation of hell. &gt;&gt; He's greater than every pornographic demon. &gt;&gt; He's greater than every lustful desire. &gt;&gt; He's greater than every popularity. He's greater than every Hollywood demon that there is. He's greater than every music devil that there is. Brother Ron, I just get so far and then I fall back and I get so far and I fall back and I get so far. You put your hands in the hands of the man that steal the water. &gt;&gt; You put your trust in Jesus Christ. Are you with me now? You lay it at his feet. Lay temper at his feet. Lay lust at his feet. Lay passion at his feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 3:5. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Our sufficiency is of God. Paul would say it like this. And he saith unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee. &gt;&gt; For my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me." Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29. He giveth power to the faint, &gt;&gt; and to them that have no might. He increasth strength. Even to the youth shall he thou shalt faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up on wings as an eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Isaiah 54 and verse 16. I'm in the great quote book tonight. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work. I have created the waster to destroy. This is one of my favorite scripture. No weapon. No weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee &gt;&gt; shall prosper. &gt;&gt; And every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn. &gt;&gt; This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. No weapon. no weapon. I'd like to share with you some of Paul's testimony. Paul was a man that would spend much of his life in in in a dungeon for the cause of Jesus Christ, not in a beautiful tent or building like we have, but most of this the New Testament would be written from a dungeon guarded by men. Brother Brandon would use the term he said he would eat with rats, chains on him. Did that make him want to quit? Stupid devil. Just stupid devil. Listen to second Corinthians chapter 11. We talk about hurt. Somewhere in your mind's eye, I'd like you to just capture some of the hurt that's happened in your life. And we're going to do something with it in a little bit. &gt;&gt; Some of the gathering of the hurt and the scars in the life. &gt;&gt; We're going to do with something with it for a little bit. Are you with me now? Is this okay? I know I spent a little time this afternoon just saying, "Satan, get ready." &gt;&gt; Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they seed of Abraham? So am I. Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more. and labors more abundant and stripes above measure &gt;&gt; in prison more frequent and depth of the Jews five times received I 40 stripes save one thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned &gt;&gt; thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day in the deep &gt;&gt; can you imagine believe the sign I'm having enjoyment with this Ah, your prophet has been beat over and over again. Yep. &gt;&gt; He's been shipwrecked over and over again. Yep. &gt;&gt; Your prophet spends most of his time in prison. Yep. He's been stoned and left for dead. Yep. &gt;&gt; In journeys and often in perils and of waters and perils of the robbers and perils of my own countrymen, in perils by the nation, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils amongst false brethren. It's probably the most dangerous one. in weariness and painfulness, in watching often, and in hunger, and in thirst, and fast often, in cold, and in naked. Besides all these things worth without, and that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the church, who is weak? &gt;&gt; Who is weak? &gt;&gt; I am not weak. Who is offended? I burn not. If I must needs glory, I will glory in the things which all concern mine infirmities. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed forever more, knoweth that I lie not. &gt;&gt; Can I paraphrase here for a moment? I refuse to allow these hurts &gt;&gt; to destroy my music. I refuse to allow these things to destroy me. &gt;&gt; Forgive me if I get a little bit excited. &gt;&gt; Romans 8. And we know that all things &gt;&gt; all things There's nothing that has exclusivity to it. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; All things. Brother David. &gt;&gt; This service. Let's just destroy the enemy. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're taking your time. I want you to get it. &gt;&gt; All right. Brother Ron, nobody knows what I go through. Listen, let me just say, get out of your personal pity party. &gt;&gt; Climb up out of your personal pity party. &gt;&gt; Dust your clothes off. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's dust our clothes off for a little bit. We were sent here to conquer this day. Let's dust our clothes off a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to fight. This is a day that the Lord has made. This is my day. This is my battle. &gt;&gt; Every one of you's got different battles in this building. But you've been built to overcome. You've been given the armor to overcome your battle. Not somebody else's battle or this is what I would do. You overcome. Speak to your mountain. Woo! It feels good up here. We know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are they called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. &gt;&gt; And whom he called them, he also justified. &gt;&gt; And justification is though you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; So God that had you in your hand here knows he's going to have you in your hand there. and whom he justified them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, &gt;&gt; if God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Let's just ask a question. Who? &gt;&gt; Who? Brother Random stood there that day when they were contesting him on the Godhead. &gt;&gt; And they were warned by another brother, be careful. &gt;&gt; There's an angel of God with them. None of them would step up. &gt;&gt; I find it interesting that many devils stepped up after he was gone a long time ago. &gt;&gt; But now they want to take you on. &gt;&gt; Welcome to our world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Who can be against us? &gt;&gt; He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him freely also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; It is God that justifith. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also make us intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, &gt;&gt; distress, persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword. For as it is written, for thy sake we're killed all the day long, and we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nailed all these things, &gt;&gt; we're more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor death, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us &gt;&gt; from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; our Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I'd like to remind the devil he's in for a really bad night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 4 and verse one. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quicken the dead at the appearing of his kingdom. Preach the word, be instant in season, &gt;&gt; out of season, &gt;&gt; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but rather their own lust shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears. For they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and they shall be turned into fables. But watch thou in all things. Endure afflictions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't quit. &gt;&gt; Don't turn away and run. &gt;&gt; Do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, for the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; What can you do with a seed of God? I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, &gt;&gt; shall give me at that day, and not to me only, &gt;&gt; but unto all of them, &gt;&gt; sir. All of them &gt;&gt; that love his appearing. Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. Brother Murphy, you're still alive. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing that I do, forgetting those things which are behind. Can I say it to you? Forgetting those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; What happened to you yesterday? &gt;&gt; Put in the blood of Jesus Christ and walk on. &gt;&gt; What they said to you yesterday, walk on. &gt;&gt; How they hurt you years ago. Walk on. &gt;&gt; The scars that have been in your life and you're still standing. Walk on. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'd like to see a great miracle. You are. &gt;&gt; A great miracle. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; a great miracle. You are a great miracle. &gt;&gt; You're still standing. &gt;&gt; Satan has put every challenge that he could against you. &gt;&gt; He's bent all of hell against you. &gt;&gt; You're living in Satan's Eden and he's did everything. He's placed every media, every outlet against your mind &gt;&gt; and you're still standing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a tremendous victory when you walk into church and you sat down with your Bible in your hands and you're sitting there &gt;&gt; and Satan's done everything that he can to discourage you and to stop you and to pull you away from your position and you're still standing at your post of duty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, you don't know. Well, maybe over the next few minutes I can help you with some things. There was a girl that laid in a condition and her mother and father were not believers, &gt;&gt; but she got a hold of a book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And she began to believe that all things are possible. And though she was surrounded by unbelief, &gt;&gt; somehow she be to pray to a faithful high priest &gt;&gt; that could touch the helm of a garment. And beyond her little feeble body that couldn't get herself out of the bed, she be to believe in a vision of the word of God that she didn't have to live in that prison of a body forever. She be to believe, God, you can send me your prophet. You can come on the scene. You can minister to my body. You can raise me up out of this bed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Georgia Carter lived that testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes, she did. a lady born blind and would be a pulper all of her life. But yet there was such a relationship with God on the inside of her. She didn't need to see the sun come up in the morning. &gt;&gt; She didn't need to see the stars to know that there was a God. She could reach into another realm and the anointing of God would sweep down over her and somehow she would begin to write songs. &gt;&gt; She would begin to write songs. She didn't have money. She didn't have a great family. She didn't have a beautiful home. But the hurt didn't destroy the music. Amen. &gt;&gt; Her blind eyes didn't destroy the music that was coming out of her. &gt;&gt; Savior, Savior, &gt;&gt; pass me not, oh gentle Savior, &gt;&gt; hear my humble cry. How many, maybe even to the millions, &gt;&gt; have walked to the altar, &gt;&gt; stepped out of a pew, &gt;&gt; behind a chair, &gt;&gt; been invited, &gt;&gt; laid down sins that was more than them and slavery more than them, and walk to an altar because someone was inspired from the depths of blindness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was inspired from the depths of blindness &gt;&gt; and it forced her &gt;&gt; into a deep relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; Stupid devil. Stupid devil. &gt;&gt; He's ignorant. just have to say, "Let me just place it how it is." He's ignorant. &gt;&gt; God knows what he deposited. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And he permits pressure. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; To make goal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He certainly does. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm coming to your house in a minute. &gt;&gt; You didn't need to pity Fanny Crosby. There was there was thousands of people walking by her that didn't have eternal life. &gt;&gt; But what the darkness of poverty and the darkness of blindness did to her, it forced her into a relationship &gt;&gt; of such depth that all of her critics were hush. How will you know him? &gt;&gt; How will you know him? &gt;&gt; You're blind. How will you know him? &gt;&gt; And she turns under inspiration. And in that very moment, that criticism caused her to write a song. I shall know him. I shall know him. I shall know him by the nail prints. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John Wesley, his mother, it's recorded in one place that their home was burned out five times. They lost five homes to fire. husband wasn't in and out of the home, but his mother had a desire to see a revival and she was called the mother of Methodists. They will label that later the mother of Methodist, but she was crying for revival. Pressures forced her to where she was. She wanted life. &gt;&gt; And she refused the status quo. &gt;&gt; She had to have more. &gt;&gt; One of her sons would be Charles Wesley and he would be one of the greatest songwriters of all time. But the other one would be a messenger &gt;&gt; to the agemen. &gt;&gt; Great big man. 5'1. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. redheaded. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He would marry a woman somewhere through the changes of life. She would lose her mind and she would be mentally very afflicted and tormented. Talking about pressure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're a messenger. We read about Paul in the dungeon. We read about Fanny Crosby. But here's a messenger. A messenger to a generation. A messenger of reformation. A messenger preaching with passion with everything that was within him. And he stowed up out of every every church. And his home seems unstable. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And he preached. and he rode on the back of a horse and he spoke 88,000 sermons in his life. He was stoned five times. You can read it in his diary. Today I was stoned and they thought I was dead. But I came to myself and I shook the rocks off of me. &gt;&gt; And I will begin to preach again tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Don't come to me with your pity party. Somebody didn't shake your hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't come to me with, you know, my personal feelings got hurt last week and &gt;&gt; my name didn't get called in the service. &gt;&gt; I want to just rehearse it again to you today. I was stoned and left for dead. &gt;&gt; And after my perpetrators were gone, I shook myself and got out of the rocks. And I'm determined to preach again tomorrow. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Our messenger was under every pressure from hell. &gt;&gt; Witch doctors trying to destroy his meetings. Preacher sitting on the platform trying to destroy his meeting. His physical body had had situations in it that every few years would go through another cycle and would try to destroy itself over and over again. But he knew where he stood. He knew where he was commissioned. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He had lost his wife. It's almost beyond measure when I I've heard it over and over and hundreds of times. Life story. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And every time I hear life story, I'm consumed. with what went on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm consumed with the trial that he went through. &gt;&gt; But the extreme hurt, &gt;&gt; the extreme pressure, &gt;&gt; did not destroy the music. when he steps to the pullpit and speaks sermons like future home. &gt;&gt; It's like John standing and writing Revelations 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's messenger looking into another realm and telling you what it's going to be like and what kind of people that you'll be. He walks to the pull pit and speaks choosing of a bride and he's looking for you and he's looking at you knowing that you're coming &gt;&gt; knowing that he's dressing a bride for Jesus Christ knowing that regardless of the hurts that you go through and the critics that you will have to walk through and the thermal that you will go through that the dress will fit exactly right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; When he speaks sermons like things that are to be, &gt;&gt; it's more than just some pretty message, &gt;&gt; but it's prophetic. It's prophetic and it's for you &gt;&gt; and you grab a hold of it &gt;&gt; and you hang on to it with everything that's within it &gt;&gt; when he stands to the pull pit and under great pressure in one meeting. He's now forced into a sermon and he speaks on the wings of a snow white dove. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he tells how bird goes out, there's been a war, how that bird gets shot, explaining his own life. &gt;&gt; But toward the end, he says the message got through. Oh, how he must have felt, Brother Ed. &gt;&gt; And he stood there night after night after night throughout all of the years and decades now. And God allows him to say, "And the message got through. It's going to accomplish what it set out to do. &gt;&gt; Let every devil in hell rage. Let the heathen rage and say vain things. The message got through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One more round. Men of God grabbed this message with all their hearts. They sit in pullpits all over the world studies. They treasure this message with all of their hearts. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you could poke you could poke faults at them and look at their humanity and they even struggle with their own humanity. Every man of God struggles with his own humanity and he realizes that the greatest gift that any of us has is to get herself out of the way. But you eat the book and you eat the book and you eat the book and you eat the book. Then there will be certain occasions that you're given the opportunity to speak. Now, God has allowed you to build character in your life. And he's sent you trial after trial after trial. You see, God is the potter and we're the clay. &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly where to squeeze us and word to put pressure on us because he wants the bell to sound a certain way, &gt;&gt; a trumpet to sound a certain way, and he's got a certain music for us to. &gt;&gt; But even though our hurt, Even though our incredible frustrations of life through all of our hurt, the music comes through. Brother Brandon used a man named Beethoven. And Beethoven was known as one of the greatest composers that there would ever be. But Beethoven's gift would be perfected. It would be forced to be perfected. by becoming deaf. Sometimes we wonder why these things. We're forced into channels to be perfected. Now, I'm going to cut a lot of heads off. He's forced into isolation now. He can't enjoy the orchestra, but he'll put his ear against the floor &gt;&gt; and cut the piano off and play by the rhythm on the floor. And he from that stage of life will create the greatest music known to man. &gt;&gt; Why did Isaac have to go blind and stagger in the darkness? He would have never allowed Jacob &gt;&gt; to get the birthight. Why did David fall to a horrible sin? &gt;&gt; God had to produce grace &gt;&gt; and show grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Character after character in the scripture, but I'd like to go character after character after character setting this tent tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, God God has allowed certain things in your life &gt;&gt; to force you to be the man that you are. &gt;&gt; Are they easy? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'd say absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Did it hurt the music? No, it actually made it better. Brother Tom, you shared with me your life story. We wept together. We've cried together. We spent a lot of time together. You watched him be developed. You watched him, right? &gt;&gt; You watched him be developed. Did it hurt the music? I'd say not. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we listen to a sermon and we watch a man tell us, "I'm trying to slow down." You know good and well he can't. And he's delivering message with passion like never before. You just don't know. Sometimes you don't value or appreciate &gt;&gt; the work that has went on &gt;&gt; to make him &gt;&gt; the gift that he is. &gt;&gt; I haven't asked these men's haven't asked them permission. I'm just venturing without authority. I'm going to come down here so lightning don't strike me. It seemed like a few years ago that the whole world turned on your pastor. &gt;&gt; Did it shake him? Did he quit? &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you, right in the midst of all that pressure, he just delivered his greatest messages. &gt;&gt; That's what pressure does to you. And you heard Rahab &gt;&gt; and you heard Kmart. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You heard the administration of the son of man. &gt;&gt; You think those thoughts some man thought up? &gt;&gt; God got a vessel to a spot. I can speak through him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? and you went through some of those spots with him &gt;&gt; and you were shaken to your core. &gt;&gt; Did it cause you to quit? I'd say absolutely no. &gt;&gt; It only made you stronger. Brother Jumbo, you're a friend of me and I hope you're a friend of mine after tonight. You have a brother-in-law who's one of my best friends of life and his name is Tim Puit. Brother Tim, if you're on right now, just cut it off for just about 10 minutes. You were his brother-in-law. And I'm sure you had a good relationship. When I first met you, it seemed like you didn't you had went through a horrible and I'm not going to say a lot of things here. You had went through a horrible situation. Your first wife had passed and you were very, very distant. Very distant. Now to be the man that he is, God allowed God allowed, Brother Bam uses the term God permits him to have a disease in his life that would him. That didn't make him quit. At 15 years old, he began to pastor a church. If you've ever met a a man that's a lion &gt;&gt; from a little bitty body that stands about as high as I stand. He stands with determination. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He stands with ferveny in his voice &gt;&gt; through all the hurts of his body. through all the DNA that had that had bound him. &gt;&gt; He's preached masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece through his life. &gt;&gt; I would say tonight, brother Kim, the hurt &gt;&gt; did not destroy the music. Sister Melody and Brother Calvin, this building doesn't understand the incredible pain that you've went through in your life. But the hurt didn't destroy the music. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when you shake somebody's hand, you don't know what they're going through. &gt;&gt; You literally do not know what they're going through. &gt;&gt; You don't know. &gt;&gt; You just don't know. There was a day you really didn't like me, but today it's not that way. Where's your brother? I don't think there's ever been a day you didn't like me. the hurt. You were told everything against this message, but the hurt didn't destroy your music. We could go all over this building tonight. What about your book, Sister Anne? It's got some difficult chapters in it. The hurt will not destroy the music. Can I use one last? &gt;&gt; I haven't found Ella yet. I've been looking. Where's Ella? Ella. There's no accidents with God. &gt;&gt; There's no accidents with God. There's absolutely no accidents. &gt;&gt; Ella, you've cried a lot at night and there's been days of great darkness and no doubt Satan's whispered a lot of times in your ears. Where's her parents? Where's her parents now? her parents in the building. They know what the pain that she's went through. But I've never never met a lady with more character &gt;&gt; than Ella. &gt;&gt; I say that by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The hurt didn't destroy music. I've tried to lead myself out of this tonight, but for you that know me, know that there's been a faith walk. Faith to get out of a wheelchair. &gt;&gt; Faith to preach again. &gt;&gt; Faith to be able to get up out of the bed. &gt;&gt; Faith to move forward. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look around the building, we go, "Where's God?" I'll tell you, in every seat, God's here. in your mind. Just make a list &gt;&gt; of all the hurts. Just make a list of all the hurts that's detained you and hurt you. All your pity parties, all your I'm sorry for me stations, &gt;&gt; all the stages of trying to destroy your life. Put it on the altar and just start tearing it up tonight. This night I lay it at your feet. &gt;&gt; This night I commit it to you and thank you &gt;&gt; for putting me under the pressure &gt;&gt; that go would come out of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Grace, how sweet. I was blind. through men needed. I have already save the song and Gra will be &gt;&gt; I want to deal with you just now. I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you. You don't have to write me a blog. You don't have to write me a text. I want just now. You know what you've been battling in your mind. And you know what you've been battling in your life. I want you right now to bring it to a consummation. Say, "I'm done with this devil. I'm done with this devil that's tormenting me. I'm tired of fighting it on my own. And I want to lay it at Jesus's feet &gt;&gt; tonight. Would there be anybody in this building that would be willing to be vulnerable enough to say I want to lay it at Jesus's feet just now yes Yes. Yes. Yes. You were a team today. An absolute team today. Forced not to compete against each other, but to help each other. &gt;&gt; We need one another. &gt;&gt; We need to realize we're not isolationist. We need one another. &gt;&gt; We crawled through mud. We crawled over fences. We crawled up ropes. We crawled. We We're dashed in the water. &gt;&gt; We've been forced in our face issues tonight. God wants to deal with our lives personally. &gt;&gt; And I want to deal not just with young people now. I want to deal with you all over this building. There is a deliverer in the building. There is a deliverer in the building. &gt;&gt; The prison doors can come open tonight. Oh, but I'm a Christian. But you don't have to carry those chains. &gt;&gt; You don't have to carry those anxieties. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I would like for you to follow your hand up and I'd like for you to step out of your seat tonight and stand and be identified as an overcomer. I'd like for you to step up here around this this this stage. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We have found the bullseye. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer afraid of him. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer ashamed. I stand here tonight and make a declaration. &gt;&gt; I'm free. And I accept my freedom tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I sound the Jubilee trumpet tonight. I'm free. &gt;&gt; Young man to a young man, I want you to lay your hands over on one another now. Young lady to a young lady, we're together in this battle. &gt;&gt; We're together in this battle. Your tongue has the power of life and death inside of it. &gt;&gt; Your tongue &gt;&gt; the power to speak life to bring speak freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, God dealt with me to speak this sermon to you. And if God sends us a word, then he's got an action that's going to happen behind it. God amens his own word. &gt;&gt; God echoes his thoughts. &gt;&gt; And those thoughts are eternal. And he would have a service such as this because of your condition. And we have a high priest that knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at. And there's not a condition too great. There's not a situation that's impossible. He's here. We don't have to ask him to come. He's here. There will come tremendous testimonies from this service tonight.

Father, &gt;&gt; your name is above every name. &gt;&gt; You're the mighty conqueror tonight. &gt;&gt; You're the mighty angel that is among us. &gt;&gt; You've come to confirm your covenant this afternoon to make a declaration in this building amongst your bride of Jesus Christ. Let freedom ring. We've raised flags this week, &gt;&gt; but we raise another flag tonight. An unsung son. Calvary paid the price of redemption for us. &gt;&gt; And it declared that we're free &gt;&gt; and we're no longer a slave to sin. We don't have to be a slave to habits. We don't have to be a slave to anxieties. We speak to circumstances and situations tonight. &gt;&gt; Turmoils of life, &gt;&gt; give way in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; give way in the name of Jesus Christ tonight. Lord, all of our pressures that have been placed upon us, &gt;&gt; you've sent us a word that'll give us victory. &gt;&gt; It'll give us overcoming power in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We accept it right now. &gt;&gt; We accept it right now. &gt;&gt; Come to our house.

Why don't you just thank him now? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just thank him for &gt;&gt; what he's done in your life at this moment? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just lift up your hearts and just say, "Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're a a faithful God. You're a loving God. You're mindful of my need. And you sent a man of God to speak. And I don't want it to go unsaid, Lord. &gt;&gt; But I want to give you thanks. I want to give you praise. I want to worship you. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you. I want to rejoice in my deliverance. I want to rejoice in the word of God that's been spoken. &gt;&gt; We're always asking, but now I just want to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Not not not with closed mouth. I I want to open my mouth. I want to say thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you for my brethren. Thank you for here my sister, my mother. Want to thank you Jesus. People aren't grateful enough these days. They want to don't want to thank anybody. But I tell you one thing, I want to thank the Lord Jesus tonight. I want to thank him for what he's doing amongst you. I want to bless his holy name. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; how can we say thanks &gt;&gt; for the things you have done for us? How can we say thanks, Lord, &gt;&gt; for what you're doing in the supernatural realm? Satan's kingdom has suffered great defeat. Kingdom of God has come down amongst his redeemed. Victory is taking place in the hearts of your children. And Lord, we don't want to be dilatory. We want to be able to express from the depths of our soul to God be the glory. Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; We want to praise your name. We want to lift up that name. &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord Jesus, we're thankful people. service. Now after the service and now another service, surely the sons and daughters of God can express Lord within their heart, I am free. I am free. Whom the sun sets free is free indeed. I'm free. I am free to worship the true and living God. I'm free to open up my lips and to give you all the glory. I am free to lift up my hands to praise your holy name. The dead will never praise you. The dead won't rejoice in this. But Lord, we are the church of the living God. And we will bless your holy name. And we will give you all the glory. It's not the workings of man. It's not the instrumentality of a man. It's God himself coming down speaking and dealing with our lives. So, Father God, from the front to the back of this little tent, we want to express our thanksgiving to you for your faithfulness. The music is not going to be heard. &gt;&gt; Still going to go on. Lord, may our lives be a melody in the presence of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the word of God that we've heard this evening. We're thankful, Father. Amazing Grace will always be my song of praise, Brother Ryan. Amazing grace shall be my song of praise. For it was praise that my mercy. This is the grace of God. I do not know just why he came to love me so think of it now. Oh, I just want to praise my heart and all my need. I shall forever lift my eyes to you. where Jesus died for me. Oh my he Amazing grace that save me from shame. That's what this is about. Draw me close and keep me by his side forever. I'll sing how glory to his name for him. Oh, bless his name. Bless his holy name. Bless his name. Hallelu. I shall forever my eyes to you. The cross where Jesus My heart be I shall forever. I shall forever. One more time. Oh, I shall forever. Where Jesus? Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my go my need. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look what the Holy Spirit is doing, young people. Look what he's doing. God's doing wonderful things. He's doing a miraculous thing. And I I really don't understand sometimes how we just can't lift up our hearts and voices today. And I I I see the Holy Spirit just doing marvelous things. And may you continue in this. May God continue to start breathing continually in your lives that you can say, "I marked the spot one more time. God's called us to this great battle." He's called kings to come and fight. And it's by the grace of God that we've been able to have a camp and that the Holy Spirit would have men of God come and minister in such a way as this. Now, you must determine, I'm not going to be the same. Is that your determination? I I I'm not going to be the same. I'm not going to fall in that same old rut. I've taken God at his word and I'm going to take him at his promise. And by the grace of God, I am totally free. Free now. Not by your emotion. Not by this emotion of it. But by the faith of it, you've heard the word. Faith cometh by hearing in what? Hearing the word. You've heard the word. You say, "Well, it's not just a camp experience. I'm going to go back to wherever I come from, and I'm going to fall in that same old rut." If Jesus has done something eternal, you can never go back to what you were. And you might as well tell the devil, "I am never going back to what I was. God sent a word for my life. God spoke to my heart. You didn't move here because somebody said, "Why don't you just go up front? Why did you come here tonight? Why did you move up here tonight? Why did you get out of your seat tonight?" It wasn't Brother Tim saying, "Just get up here. this is a time to to react to the things of God or brother Tom screaming out or no it was the beckoning of the still small voice of God that moved Elijah has moved you &gt;&gt; and you can say you can when you read that scripture you said it wasn't in the thunder wasn't in the lightning it wasn't in the earthquake but it was in that still small voice that you can say moved me to this spot. And if God could speak to Elijah like that, then he could speak to me like that. And why would we want to go back and be the same? We're never going to be the same again. Are you thankful? &gt;&gt; He will continue the deal. He doesn't stop just because of you have a wonderful time in his presence. It does not stop. Brother Tom's never stopped and said, "Boy, I'm so thankful what he did for me in 1985. I don't live in 1985. I'm in 2018." And if God can't speak to me tonight, then what kind of a God do we have? People live on the laurels of their past history. Not so for the bride of Jesus Christ and not so for the redeemed of God. He will deal tonight. He will deal tomorrow. He will continue to deal with us. Just make yourself available. Just make yourself available and just say, "Lord, here am I." Now, can I ask you one more time? Did God do something for you? &gt;&gt; You know why I asked you that? Because now confession is good for your soul. And the prophet said, "If you confess it, your confession will make your body subject to it. It's not in your mind." And I can't stand mind people where it's just all in their mind. There's no expression because the prophet taught us to put the word on our lips to speak the word of God and make that body line right up to it. You've confessed it and you watch God now come behind you. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. He knows my name. He knows our name. As brother Ron had said, Lord, we know our own address and we know our name. And we know our own situations. We know our own hurts. And we know our own problems. We know that. But Lord, the wonderful part is you know that. And you said in your word, Lord, that you are the great healer. And you're the healer of the broken pieces. You're the healer of these lives that are standing represented here. Young men and women in the beauty of their youth and they're standing here for a reason. And so Lord God, we have committed them into your divine care. Would you lead them, Lord, not just as you have this evening, but as they leave out of the tent and go to their cabins and in the next couple of days they will go home. Will you be their friend that stickketh closer than a brother? The presence that is here, may it minister them on a daily basis. May you be that friend and be that guide. Lord, don't let it be just by emotion. Let it be by an experience of God himself speaking and dealing in an individual soul. I commit this lovely group to you tonight, asking Lord you'll continue to guide and to keep them in your perfect will. We pray. In Jesus' name. Amen. Let's just sing that as we make our way back to our seats. And you're dismissed in Jesus' name. God be with you, watch over you on the road, and may the presence of God lead you and keep you in his perfect will. He knows my name. I have a before my heart and before even time began. My life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each and I He calls me and no matter where I go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Nobody can see the heaven. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
