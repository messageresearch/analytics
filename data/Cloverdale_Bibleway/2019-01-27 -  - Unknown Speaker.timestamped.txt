[4:14] and the light came down and the darkness
[4:19] could not abide pressed it back as it
[4:23] was in the beginning when God said let
[4:25] there be light there was darkness
[4:26] everywhere but the darkness had to go
[4:29] praise the Lord Amen brother Ricardo you
[4:35] have a testimony I'm not gonna guess it
[4:39] it just says testimony so I said well he
[4:43] must want to come and say it you mind
[4:46] praying for the congregation
[4:47] [Music]
[4:53] so this is something that I'm I promise
[5:01] Laurie I do
[5:06] when you're listening to and you're
[5:08] trying to be in tune with what God wants
[5:10] you to do
[5:10] it's not always easy right every single
[5:13] one of us have been there so I was
[5:16] listening to brother hydro digs and he
[5:18] was talking about collision and impact
[5:21] and I was listening to it for myself and
[5:27] I was thinking of my family and the
[5:29] different things that we've been through
[5:30] and but the cadre said many are in a
[5:40] collision but they don't get the impact
[5:42] of it it doesn't impact them and so he
[5:46] was a lot of young people had been there
[5:48] a lot of you adults have seen it and it
[5:51] spoke so strongly to me so part of me I
[5:54] was turning it up so my family could
[5:56] hear it because I want him to hear and
[5:59] uh and so through different parts of the
[6:03] country I'm going to cut through a part
[6:05] of the service where he said he says
[6:09] what would it be like if we were all
[6:13] crying out for God and he says what
[6:16] would it be like what kind of atmosphere
[6:18] could there be and so he said they do it
[6:24] in stadiums what does a stadium have
[6:28] over his people it's actually a ripoff
[6:33] don't get me wrong I've been in games
[6:35] before where I am cheering whether it's
[6:37] my children's teams okay so I want
[6:41] everybody here just to get out of
[6:42] themselves it's not about you it's not
[6:44] about me but it's about the Lord that we
[6:46] praise and who can stop that
[6:51] and what brother cadre says what would
[6:53] it be like if we said Jesus Christ Jesus
[6:56] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus
[6:59] Christ Jesus Christ that's my lord I've
[7:09] done it myself when I've been walking
[7:11] but I said Lord
[7:12] I'll make this testimony for you so I
[7:20] was outside and I heard the service this
[7:23] morning and one my favorite our family's
[7:27] favorite songs is fourth man in the fire
[7:30] and it knocked me over when it was sung
[7:32] this morning so I was listening to that
[7:36] yesterday when we were working around
[7:37] the house and I was working in the barn
[7:39] and I don't remember it but I was
[7:42] working on it and the next thing I know
[7:43] my face is hitting a ladder and I'm
[7:46] falling down and I'm hitting the ground
[7:47] I don't know whether my family is
[7:49] hearing me and but I know I'm trying to
[7:54] let them know and something runs through
[7:58] your head and says maybe it's time I
[8:00] don't know if any of you ever been there
[8:02] but maybe it's time so in my mind I'm I
[8:05] feel like I'm calling out and then I
[8:11] hear I can't see everything's blurry I
[8:13] hear my son down it's voice and then I
[8:17] hear my wife I'm like okay good there's
[8:20] somebody here they rushed me in the
[8:23] house and I go any I was I had dirt all
[8:28] over me so it and cleaned up when I came
[8:30] back all of a sudden I knew there's
[8:32] something wrong there was something
[8:34] wrong and I looked at buck and I said
[8:36] something's wrong something's wrong so
[8:38] she starts calling 9-1-1 and i'm
[8:40] fighting for breath and i can't get
[8:43] enough breath so i said let's just go
[8:46] let's just go so we're in the van and
[8:48] we're taking off and we're tearing off
[8:50] brother Tom Frei and sister Kim
[8:53] happen to have some people over at their
[8:55] house and the kids that already start
[8:57] texting people mm in donek saying dad
[9:03] they're praying for you
[9:04] [Music]
[9:12] so that that touched me but I still
[9:17] thought well maybe it's time Lord so I
[9:20] started calling out for what mattered to
[9:22] me that was my son did your honor and my
[9:34] wife and then I'm not ashamed to say
[9:36] that I was calling out for him tell him
[9:42] to save him Dominic's talking to her
[9:45] brother Tom got the Thomas on
[9:47] speakerphone and everything he was
[9:49] saying I said I've heard this before
[9:53] I've already been here I heard this
[9:55] before and I'm tom brother tom I heard
[9:57] this we get to the hospital
[10:00] we go in I'm and I'm out but still
[10:03] blurry and along the short of it so
[10:05] brother Tom meets me over there he gets
[10:07] there he stays there pup 11:30 last
[10:08] night we were there at almost 2:00 but
[10:13] guy just came down he puts a token on me
[10:15] and I started listening to it and
[10:17] brother Branham says the token is
[10:20] healing if you accept it he starts to
[10:24] mention everything the token is so now I
[10:27] start saying I have my son oh yeah my
[10:30] daughter I have my wife I have my
[10:33] healing and if you were to take me right

[20:41] to a wonderful time this evening to have
[20:43] our brother Danny Stephen come to preach
[20:45] and minister to us it's uh just going
[20:50] over in my mind and we talked about it
[20:51] yesterday
[20:52] I've known brother Danny since I got
[20:55] saved and I got saved when I was 21 so
[20:58] that's nine to forty years ago and
[21:02] brother Bisco I was a young man at the
[21:04] time and had the pleasure to travel with
[21:07] brother Bissell down to Ohio where he
[21:09] would have meetings and brother Browns
[21:12] barn and brother Brown would get all
[21:14] cleaned up and with shavings on the
[21:16] floor and he'd you know a little wagon
[21:19] and he put bales of hay there and
[21:21] brother Briscoe would minister of course
[21:23] being young in the Lord and I every
[21:27] service was for me didn't matter where I
[21:29] traveled and so I was all personal to me
[21:32] so if there was an altar call or a
[21:34] rededication I'm there I haven't changed
[21:37] and brother Danny was talking he says
[21:42] brother Tom I met you when I was seven
[21:44] years old at the altar
[21:45] here I was varied my face in the ground
[21:48] calling on God at 21 and here brother
[21:50] Danny was right beside me at 7 years old
[21:52] and I said to brother Danny today I said
[21:55] you're still here and I'm still here

[22:01] holds a man and I guess we're just

[24:10] [Music]
[24:22] [Music]
[24:32] [Music]
[24:56] music now I may
[25:03] me
[25:04] [Music]
[25:14] through your I found party
[25:21] [Music]
[25:37] [Music]
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:41] hallelujah you may believe that this
[25:44] evening
[25:45] what a precious gift that we've been
[25:48] given
[25:49] amen amen well we greet you in the name
[25:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's a
[25:54] privilege to be here tonight I had come
[25:59] for the wedding and sister Karen and
[26:01] brother Levi and you know you just hope
[26:04] that when you come that you don't get a
[26:06] phone call or anything like that but it
[26:09] happened and what I want to say that it
[26:11] was such a privilege to be able to be in
[26:15] the service this morning and to listen
[26:16] to amen what our brother Edie preached
[26:20] on and I believe that a man with all my
[26:22] heart and I was thinking about what he
[26:26] said that he would you know since I set
[26:29] in the congregation he would like to if
[26:31] he comes to my church to set with his
[26:33] wife and I agree to that I get when you
[26:36] don't preach you can sit with your wife
[26:38] so a man so we'll figure that out later
[26:41] amen but a man but the Lord is good at
[26:44] name and we're so happy to be here we
[26:47] just appreciate each one of these
[26:48] ministers amen and for the for what they
[26:51] have meant to us down through the years
[26:53] and their friendship and their help and
[26:55] they've come through our way numerous
[26:58] times and ministered force and it's has
[27:00] certainly been a blessing and in our
[27:03] lives and brother tom was mentioning a
[27:06] little bit of the things that has
[27:08] happened that goes way back and we all
[27:09] have a testimony about how the Lord and
[27:11] how what he has done for us and and I
[27:15] can remember those things and David said
[27:18] one generation shall praise the Lord in
[27:21] his works to another generation I
[27:23] believe it's so important that the
[27:25] generation that has come before us and I
[27:27] believe brother ed has been faithful to
[27:29] do that is to say what God has done and
[27:31] what he has seen in his generation for
[27:35] the awareness of it is dying out and
[27:38] people no longer have a fear and a
[27:41] reverence of the supernatural and what
[27:43] God has done and and so therefore if
[27:46] they don't know God
[27:47] the scripture says if they don't know
[27:48] who he is they're leaving they're
[27:51] leaving and that's what's happening if
[27:53] her generations are rising up that don't
[27:55] know the god of Joshua and the elders
[27:57] that had seen the works of God and so we
[28:00] thank God that these things are not just
[28:02] kept alive by the testimony of a
[28:04] previous generation but we can see it in
[28:06] this generation amen and we are
[28:08] recipients of that how many believe that
[28:10] so I'm just excited what the Lord is
[28:13] doing for us and what I've seen him
[28:14] doing in our congregation and I know
[28:16] amen the testimonies we've heard of what
[28:19] God is doing here amen it's more than
[28:21] just a letter we we serve a God that is
[28:25] alive he's working in and through his
[28:28] body this is his work you are the answer
[28:32] to the devil's question hey man this is
[28:36] why the Prophet come and I just say it's
[28:39] a privilege to preach to you this
[28:41] evening so god bless you amen and we
[28:44] want you to turn in your Bibles if you
[28:46] will to first Timothy 1 a man maybe God
[28:52] helps me incorporate some some
[28:57] testimonies into the service if we can
[28:59] with the help of the Lord and also
[29:03] wanted to congratulate brother Tim bless
[29:05] you brother amen and we have certainly
[29:08] prayed for you and and I'm just so happy
[29:11] amen for our brother amen and there's a
[29:14] lot of planning going on I know that a
[29:17] lot of pre-planning isn't it and I know
[29:19] there's a lot of anxiety about well we
[29:23] sure hope it comes out as we plan you
[29:27] know what I found out with God is as we
[29:31] do the worrying but God always brings it
[29:34] just as he planned it and I want to say
[29:38] this to you and then this is kind of
[29:39] what along lines of Minister on is that
[29:42] we are pre-planned by God there might be
[29:45] a little bit of anxiety in your walk and
[29:46] and that but God knows
[29:50] and everything he's planned will come
[29:52] exactly the way he said it would
[29:55] hallelujah 1st Timothy 1 and 18
[30:00] discharged I commit unto thee son
[30:02] Timothy according to the prophecies
[30:04] which went before on thee that thou by
[30:07] them might as war a good warfare holding
[30:12] faith and a good conscience which some
[30:14] have him put away concerning faith amid
[30:16] shipwreck of whom is hymenaeus and
[30:19] Alexander whom I have delivered unto
[30:21] Satan that they may learn not to
[30:23] blaspheme man let's go to 4 Samuel 17
[30:45] and we're start 38th verse saw armed
[30:57] David with his armor and put he put a
[30:59] helmet of brass upon his head also he
[31:01] armed him with the coat of mail and
[31:03] David girded his sword upon his armor
[31:06] and he has said to go for he had not
[31:08] proved it and David said unto Saul I
[31:11] cannot go with these for I have not
[31:12] proved them and David put them off of
[31:15] him and he took his staff in his hand
[31:18] and he chose him five smooth Stones out
[31:20] of the brook and he put them in the
[31:21] Shepherd's bag which he had even in a
[31:23] strip and his sling was in his hand and
[31:25] he drew near to the Philistine and the
[31:28] Philistine came on and drew near unto
[31:31] David and the man that bare the shield
[31:32] went before him and when the Philistine
[31:36] looked about and saw David he disdained
[31:38] him for he was but a youth and ruddy and
[31:40] of a fair countenance and the Philistine
[31:43] said unto David am i a dog that thou
[31:45] comest to me with staves and the
[31:47] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[31:50] the Philistine said the David come to me
[31:53] and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls
[31:55] of the air and to the beasts of the
[31:56] field then said David to the Philistine
[31:59] thou comest to me with the sword and
[32:01] with the spear and with the shield but I
[32:03] come to thee in the name of the Lord of
[32:05] hosts the God of the armies of Israel
[32:07] whom thou has defied this day will the
[32:10] Lord deliver thee into my hand and I
[32:12] will smite thee and take thy head from
[32:14] thee and I will give the carcasses of
[32:16] the host of the Philistines as day into
[32:18] the fowls of the air and to the wild
[32:20] beasts of the earth that all the Earth
[32:22] may know that there is a God in Israel
[32:24] and all this assembly shall know that
[32:28] the Lord saith not with sword and spear
[32:31] for the battle is the Lord's and He will
[32:34] give you into our hands and it came to
[32:38] pass when the Philistine arose and came
[32:40] and drew nigh to meet David that David
[32:43] Haye stood and ran toward the army to
[32:46] meet the Philistine you can be seated
[32:48] may God bless the reading of his word I
[32:51] know that that this story is a familiar
[32:58] story for
[32:59] from from little fellas all the way up
[33:03] and but I just felt on my heart to to
[33:06] preach on this the only only leadership
[33:08] I could get for this time so you know as
[33:11] any Minister knows it yes you're scary
[33:14] to preach without leadership so that's
[33:17] just what I'm gonna do and this evening
[33:19] I want to title this run to the battle
[33:22] run to the battle and I want to I want
[33:26] to read some things the prophet of God
[33:29] said about this event and and in our
[33:33] place that we have in our day for Paul's
[33:38] told timothy he said war by the
[33:42] prophecies that's been prophesied of
[33:44] thee and Timothy had been told by Paul
[33:49] that what he saw in him was what he had
[33:52] saw in his grandmother Lois and in his
[33:55] mother Eunice and he said I'm persuaded
[33:57] that the same faith is in thee and so
[34:01] Paul is encouraging him
[34:03] by by the word that he has preached by
[34:07] the prophecy that has been given of him
[34:10] he says you take that and in your
[34:13] warfare this is what you used to fight
[34:15] your warfare and so in thinking of this
[34:19] and brother Branham said that in every
[34:22] age he does by the same method
[34:24] he takes booty verse and in order to
[34:28] have believers to meet the word he's got
[34:30] to protest innate it to that age he said
[34:34] he's got to predestinate the thing to be
[34:36] there to meet the challenge of the age
[34:38] how many know that we have a challenge
[34:40] today amen he said did it get you did
[34:44] you feel it did you see it did you
[34:46] understand it
[34:47] that's what's happening today he
[34:49] predestinated this by his foreknowledge
[34:51] and when he predestinated in Malachi 4
[34:54] it's got to happen just as much as a
[34:57] prophet had to calm a children had to
[35:00] hear the word and have their hearts
[35:02] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[35:04] amen he said it's got to happen and when
[35:07] he come over and predestinate s--
[35:09] anything to happen in his word he has to
[35:11] prove his word to be so when he
[35:14] predestinate s-- anything to happen and
[35:16] says it will happen
[35:17] he knows that seed will be there at that
[35:20] time
[35:22] so he predestinated a bride she's going
[35:25] to be there there is going to be a
[35:27] rapture she's going to be there let it
[35:30] sink into your heart there's a rapture
[35:32] on you are here and so I would ask you
[35:35] why are you hearing what you're hearing
[35:36] tonight why are you hearing the message
[35:39] that you're hearing tonight why does it
[35:41] fit you why do you recognize what you
[35:46] see amen when the world is rejoicing in
[35:49] their ecumenical moves and the
[35:51] consolidation of church and and
[35:53] everybody's coming together let's forget
[35:55] doctrine let's sort it out up there and
[35:58] let's just all get together and love one
[36:00] another why do you see what you see why
[36:06] does the voice of the Prophet have more
[36:08] of a pull to you then the Pentecostal
[36:11] move then the catholic moves something
[36:16] had to be pre-planned
[36:18] something had to be thought out brother
[36:26] madam said that if you're a son or
[36:28] daughter of God you were in God all the
[36:29] time but he knew a bet in time you'd be
[36:32] planted so now you're made a preacher a
[36:34] son of God a manifested son or daughter
[36:37] of God to meet the challenge of this
[36:39] hour to vindicate the true and living
[36:42] God he said you were predestinated to
[36:48] meet the challenge of the hour and
[36:49] vindicate the true and living God can I
[36:54] say that again you
[36:57] we're predestinated you how many use do
[37:00] we have here you are predestinated to
[37:03] meet the challenge of the hour and true
[37:05] and prove that god is that true Bob
[37:09] how's that gonna happen that's right you
[37:15] were done there before the foundation of
[37:16] the world he wasn't chose that way no
[37:19] matter how much you try to impersonate
[37:20] it you'll never make it if you weren't
[37:21] chose that way again he said in the
[37:24] rising of the Sun the word before the
[37:27] foundation of the world the word to the
[37:29] word the word predestinated to the word
[37:32] or written for the hour you have them
[37:35] both coming together the word
[37:36] predestinated amen coming to the word
[37:39] written for the hour
[37:40] Amen you realize your position the seat
[37:43] of God will hunt for that position so
[37:47] then I want to say this God pre-planned
[37:50] your tummy
[37:53] he pre-planned that you would be here he
[37:56] knew it bad he knew what time he knew an
[37:58] hour and he knew what challenge I want
[38:05] you to notice now as we go back to David
[38:07] for just a minute a min with David we
[38:12] see that David is coming on the scene in
[38:14] the time of a failed kingship he's
[38:18] coming on the scene in a time of a
[38:21] failed priesthood is that right he's
[38:25] coming on a time when Saul who had been
[38:28] a man of God who had been anointed
[38:29] captain of the Lord's inheritance amen
[38:32] to continue the work that he had started
[38:34] with Samson to drive out the enemy the
[38:37] Philistines and and bring him under
[38:39] their feet who were the Philistines
[38:41] Philistines were the heart the robbers
[38:43] of the harvest that every time a child
[38:47] of God came in with the blessing of
[38:49] Abraham will begin to bring the seed to
[38:51] harvest the enemy would wait until it
[38:53] comes up to its growth and then he would
[38:55] come in and he would take it from him
[38:57] now why was that they had Garrison's all
[39:00] out through the land and they allowed
[39:02] the people to work the crop but they
[39:05] made sure that the people didn't have
[39:06] any weapons they make sure that they was
[39:09] gonna sharpen their tools they had to go
[39:11] down to Philistia to get their toes
[39:13] sharpened they made sure that they
[39:15] didn't have a see a sword so they had no
[39:18] way to fight off the enemy when he would
[39:20] come in against him and here's a people
[39:23] of Abraham with the blessing of God
[39:25] unable to stop the enemy from taking
[39:29] their harvest
[39:31] so if they wanted their children they
[39:34] would come in if they wanted their
[39:35] family they would come in they couldn't
[39:38] stop it man God had some men of God by
[39:41] the name of Jonathan who didn't have the
[39:44] good sense to listen to his daddy
[39:45] a man who wonder the revival of God and
[39:50] I didn't mean that
[39:51] I meant that he didn't have the good
[39:55] sense to listen to his daddy you
[39:58] understand what I meant because by this
[40:00] time his dad is back slit his dad is
[40:06] back slit he's not able to go all the
[40:08] way with the profit of the hour
[40:10] hey man and yet he loves the move of God
[40:13] hey man he can prophesy he can do this
[40:16] he can do that are you with me but he
[40:19] can't go all the way with the Word of
[40:20] God a member saw the enemy has come in
[40:24] and they they've subdued and they put
[40:26] they've run off the chill of his or the
[40:28] heightening caves and Den's but Jonathan
[40:31] he gets a revelation that God was with
[40:34] him that he was a child of Abraham and
[40:37] that he had a right to face that enemy
[40:41] see if tonight if all I can do is
[40:44] encourage your faith tonight to move out
[40:45] on every promise of God that you don't
[40:48] have to wait to the let the devil
[40:49] dictate to you your harvest but you can
[40:52] move out by faith
[40:54] come on you can move out by faith in
[40:57] there come another day I mean there was
[40:59] a great battle going on amen and saw
[41:01] backslidden preacher Amen had made an
[41:04] oath he said no man shall eat while
[41:06] they're fighting the battle here's a man
[41:10] II don't understand the importance of
[41:11] getting into the Word of God he don't
[41:14] understand the importance of knowing
[41:15] what God is saying for your day so he
[41:18] say now you go fight this battle without
[41:20] eating the word don't without eating the
[41:21] food come on church that's just what the
[41:26] devil wants you to do
[41:27] you make up your something tonight you
[41:29] don't half the problem of congregation
[41:30] is they just don't eat they just don't
[41:33] feed upon the words they don't know and
[41:36] a prophet is saying in this house and so
[41:39] when a man comes on Sidonie just fight
[41:41] how you're gonna fight if you don't have
[41:43] no strength
[41:45] and Jonathan hasn't heard his dad's oath
[41:49] he went and he saw some honey better
[41:51] there's dripping he took his staff he
[41:54] laid it over there and he dipped it in
[41:55] and he put it to his mouth and the Bible
[41:57] said his eyes were enlightened do you
[42:02] know his dad wanted to kill him for that
[42:04] wanted to destroy him in the people of
[42:06] God rose up and said you know what if it
[42:08] hadn't been for John Jonathan this
[42:10] battle wouldn't even been won you know
[42:15] if you want to revival if you want to
[42:18] move of God you gotta step out your
[42:21] daddy won't go your mama won't go you
[42:23] gotta step out and say I'm gonna eat on
[42:25] this because I know that in this is the
[42:28] strength I need this is the kind of
[42:33] scene we've come into and time time God
[42:36] got fed up with this for this this our
[42:38] kingship and he removed him from that
[42:41] seat in his eyes Saul is no longer the
[42:45] king in man's eyes Saul is still the
[42:47] king but the prophet of God is
[42:50] commissioned by him with a prophecy I
[42:53] want you to go down to Bethlehem to the
[42:56] house of Jesse for I have provided a
[42:59] king among those say his sons this is
[43:01] the prophecy going out now in God's eyes
[43:04] he said I have rejected that King not in
[43:09] man's eyes so Saul goes down there
[43:15] amen and as he goes into this meeting
[43:18] he asked for Jesse to bring his sons out
[43:20] his sons come out him in the discernment
[43:23] begins and they all begin to pass
[43:25] through discernment and as everyone
[43:28] passes through God says that's not him
[43:31] that's not him that's not him that's not
[43:36] him and it went on down to seven of them
[43:38] and he looks and there's nobody left and
[43:43] he looks and he asked Judge Jesse said
[43:45] don't you have any more and he says I
[43:47] got one more ease out on the field he
[43:49] says we'll go get him we can't do
[43:50] anything we can't even go eat until this
[43:52] man comes so this boy this man dis David
[43:56] he wasn't even invited
[43:57] the meeting he wasn't there he wasn't
[44:02] thought off he wasn't thought of to be
[44:04] aiming the one that the prophecy had
[44:06] fallen upon and it hasn't been revealed
[44:08] yet but yet David has been chosen of God
[44:11] Amon before saw Samuel has ever had
[44:14] received the prophecy de David has been
[44:17] chosen of God to reveal further the
[44:20] revelation that he gave in Eden What did
[44:25] he say anything he said the woman seed
[44:27] shall bruise the head of the serpent but
[44:30] that's all he said he never said
[44:31] anything further amen
[44:34] but then as it goes on he begin to bring
[44:36] more light upon that revelation Amen as
[44:39] he ages progressed he brought more light
[44:40] and then he said I'll bring that through
[44:42] Abraham's seed and as it goes on now
[44:45] it's coming down to David's time it's
[44:48] still the same revelation but it's just
[44:50] God unveiling predestination as you just
[44:53] bring it out this is who the woman seat
[44:55] is this is where you're come from this
[44:57] is who I use this is what he'll do and
[44:59] how did he announce that he announced it
[45:02] through the ministry of a prophet once
[45:05] you know this is the last major thing
[45:07] this is the last major thing that this
[45:10] prophet Samuel is going to do is to
[45:13] anoint this man King
[45:17] hey minions are in there in the house
[45:19] they bring David for God has said amen
[45:21] don't look on their outward appearance
[45:23] for I don't choose man behind I look but
[45:26] I look upon the heart they may be
[45:28] weights in the heart with a CD is well
[45:32] let me tell you something folks by
[45:34] outward appearance the majority of you
[45:36] would have never come close a man in
[45:39] fact him in the first invitation that
[45:41] went out was not to you hallelujah
[45:46] the first invitation that we thought was
[45:48] not to you but they receive that
[45:50] invitation and they would not a man go
[45:53] but they with one consent begin to make
[45:55] excuse and when the servant and brother
[45:58] Benham stresses the servant came back to
[46:00] the to the master and said they have
[46:02] refused it then he said go get the sick
[46:05] the lame the heart
[46:08] it's unveiling more this is not my
[46:11] chance its unveiling more of God's
[46:13] predestinated plan and the serving comes
[46:16] back and he said they come in but yet
[46:18] there's room there's room and then he
[46:24] said well go into the hedges go into the
[46:29] highways and this is the move of God
[46:32] this is what he's doing right now he's
[46:34] moving out in the sweep
[46:40] allelujah hope you don't mind if I'm
[46:43] myself tonight
[46:44] I gotta act like I'm at home where the
[46:46] Sun shines hey man
[46:48] hallelujah hey man there's a sweetheart
[46:53] yes brother madam said the move is on
[46:55] for the bride hey man let me just stop
[47:05] them in and talk about the move of God
[47:07] and I've been hearing the testimony no
[47:09] brother John is probably on the most
[47:10] faithful ministers and the message to
[47:11] send out testimonies on the phone I'm
[47:15] getting them with regularity and I
[47:16] appreciate that payment so I know you
[47:21] you don't know me I know you
[47:23] Amen but I want to tell you as well and
[47:26] in honor me I know how God dealt in my
[47:28] life I know I know as I look back
[47:30] through my life it had to be the plan of
[47:32] God he could not be by chance you know
[47:35] brother disco was talking about my dad
[47:37] this morning and how much he hated the
[47:39] mess one day he hated the message a lot
[47:40] more than what you heard I got a lot of
[47:43] memories from my dad at a young age
[47:44] screaming at my mother telling my mother
[47:46] we're leaving if you keep believing this
[47:48] we are leaving this thing telling us
[47:49] don't believe what mama what your mama

[47:57] his church we'd go to hers that's where
[47:59] we first set met brother Bisco he looked
[48:01] a lot different than I did too hey man
[48:05] then were the days I still stood on this
[48:08] on the seat to listen to church I was
[48:10] that young hey man is just a small
[48:12] church but those seeds that God was
[48:14] planting
[48:15] and I want to tell you anybody in here
[48:17] that's on the fence right now with your
[48:19] family and your relationships and you're
[48:20] thinking well maybe if I just compromise
[48:22] just a little bit cuz love will win them
[48:26] back I want you to know that's a lie
[48:28] that kind of love will not win them back
[48:31] that kind of love will send them to hell
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:40] hey man 10 years of this one on brother
[48:42] God used by the Disco's ministry and his
[48:44] wife amens if to be a great
[48:46] encouragement to my mother in that hour
[48:48] amen we come into this message because
[48:51] my grandmother even worked for a man by
[48:54] the name of Bill now you've heard of him
[48:55] many times on the tapes and then they
[48:57] went down and and and I can say this is
[49:00] what brother Briscoe talked about this
[49:01] morning and the message this day this
[49:03] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[49:05] my grandmother was there and she told me
[49:08] says Danny the Spirit of the Lord was so
[49:10] strong in that place if he had said get
[49:12] down on the floor and rolled down the
[49:14] aisle every one of us would have done it
[49:16] but you know that's not what God asked
[49:18] you to do didn't ask you to roll across
[49:20] the floor but what it is God left
[49:23] eyewitnesses and I begin to look begin
[49:25] to see him in the vindication of a
[49:27] living epistle not a tweet not a blog
[49:31] not somebody who's never tasted the word
[49:33] of the Lord but see that it's good but
[49:36] somebody that's been in the presence of
[49:38] the Almighty
[49:41] the strip's in the home got so strong my
[49:44] mother went to my grandma's and mom are

[50:11] there in a blizzard and wait to be
[50:12] picked up said of brother brems in
[50:16] heaven I don't want to go now that is a
[50:18] foolish statement because i'ma tell you
[50:20] this if the Pope goes to heaven I want

[50:47] that my mother's uncle was going to be
[50:49] baptized a man and and and she went ask
[50:52] permission of daddy if she could go and
[50:57] he said I'll tell you what this is it if
[50:59] you go when you get back I'm gone in the
[51:01] children of God I'm finished with it and
[51:04] that's where she made her stand she said
[51:07] well I'm gonna go anyhow now I never
[51:09] took from that that my mother didn't
[51:11] love me but I took from that that you
[51:14] had to love the word more than any other
[51:16] relationship
[51:18] and when she made that stand I'm not
[51:20] gonna go that's when God dropped down
[51:23] that's when her work finished and God
[51:25] took over how will they tell you I won't
[51:29] encourage you if you're in a fractured
[51:30] place I want to encourage you our God is
[51:32] faithful but he's just watching you to
[51:35] see how much you love him that's what
[51:39] changed his life that's what turned him
[51:41] around because when the rubber myth the
[51:43] myth the road and then he really got put
[51:45] to the test are you gonna really leave
[51:49] now the test is on now the challenge of
[51:52] the hours here he begin to turn around

[51:56] didn't know what to do and he fight for
[51:57] us well I'll take him and when he took
[52:01] her a week later he was baptized that's
[52:04] what God is doing that's how God moves
[52:07] man I want to show you how he moved he
[52:11] did not move with a quote she did not
[52:14] approach to him and say well brother
[52:15] branham said because that wasn't gonna
[52:19] work she had to be the voice of the
[52:21] message and Satan wants to drag you into
[52:26] a debate he's the greatest Sophos that's
[52:28] ever been he wants it just to be I
[52:30] listen to you to try to refute what
[52:32] you're gonna tell me he wants to drag
[52:34] this message down into a bait into an
[52:36] argument and to try oh you gotta
[52:38] vindicate the message you don't have to
[52:40] vindicate nothing
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:43] why do I want to prove to the devil what
[52:47] is right I am the answer to the devil's
[52:50] question for what he has done in me I
[52:53] have been quickened from death unto life
[52:57] [Applause]
[52:58] there's life in me brother Peter where
[53:06] you asked stand up I love this man I
[53:08] love what the Lord is doing in their
[53:10] family he's a great move going on back
[53:12] home with his family and I thank God for
[53:15] it but you know brother Peter he'd visit
[53:17] us here just recently so he's out
[53:19] fishing trying to catch the big big fish
[53:21] it never happened we caught a lot of
[53:22] small ones but anyway we're out there
[53:24] trying to stand up brother Peter I told
[53:26] you to stand up hey man so brother Peter
[53:28] he's over there fishing he's not moving
[53:30] he's got this brown hat on so he looks
[53:31] like a post he's not moving and I'm
[53:35] watching and and there's his bird comes
[53:37] big seagal comes flying and he's not
[53:40] moving he's just fishing and so I'm
[53:43] thinking well what this bird must be
[53:44] thinking he's lookin says well that
[53:46] looks just like a post so he fly he
[53:49] comes and he lands on his head
[53:51] a minute soon when he lands on his head
[53:54] I holler I said there's a bird landing
[53:56] on your head and when I yelled that he
[53:59] went like this life came into the body
[54:01] and when that bird realized there wasn't
[54:04] a post he just wouldn't dope off into
[54:05] the lawn just laid there and looked real
[54:07] puzzled he said John if you notice he
[54:09] said that bird flew over but I didn't
[54:11] let him build a nest I want to tell you
[54:14] what the devil will come to you to see
[54:17] if there's any life in there there has
[54:20] to be life in the body to reject the
[54:22] devil's poison
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:24] [Music]
[54:26] my brother branham said Amen that when
[54:28] David Amon comes before that prophet the
[54:31] Prophet anoints him he said right there
[54:33] Amen when God when that oil is poured
[54:36] over him he said he poured the whole
[54:38] horn it means he didn't take a little
[54:43] rag and squeeze out a little drop on you
[54:46] young people but he took the whole horn
[54:50] and unsparingly pulling it out he said
[54:54] which was a type of his Holy Spirit so
[54:57] in the mind of God right there
[54:59] he had been called he had been placed as
[55:03] king he had been filled with the Holy
[55:05] Spirit and positionally places King in
[55:07] the mind of God
[55:09] not in the mind of men that had to be
[55:13] unveiled before them but in God's mind
[55:16] it's done it's finished because this is
[55:23] his vision and now his vision has left
[55:26] his mind come to the mouth of the
[55:32] Prophet and through that transition of
[55:35] from the mind of God through the prophet
[55:37] let me tell you there's never been
[55:39] another hour where a man could stand
[55:41] behind the desk today I'm gonna take my
[55:44] text and it's going to be the entire
[55:45] Bible and I'm gonna tell you what has
[55:49] been in the back part of God's mind
[55:51] before the world began
[55:53] Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't
[55:56] do that it wasn't there our but in this
[55:58] Harry said I will restore
[56:01] [Music]
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:04] amen but he's gotta use people to
[56:08] manifest what that prophet hath spoke
[56:16] I'm brother Bentham he compares this
[56:19] time of David when he goes out to meet
[56:23] this giant he compares this time one
[56:29] place he does to the mind where he said
[56:33] there's a mutual meeting ground said God
[56:38] had to have a place you know I didn't
[56:40] Satan had to have a place where they
[56:41] could meet and so he compares this
[56:44] battle to that time sit to your mind
[56:47] another place and why Christ speak he
[56:51] refers to this moment and says that if
[56:54] there's ever a time that man should
[56:57] speak it's now as he's referring to what
[57:01] David is doing and we see a man that
[57:05] when David comes out and he's going down
[57:08] to the battle notice he's the last of
[57:11] the brothers he's the last in line he's
[57:16] the one that is anointed he's not even
[57:20] invited to the battle so he's going out
[57:23] there not the fight he's going out there
[57:25] to feed his brothers because his
[57:29] brothers are the Warriors saws the king
[57:34] and they're going to fight but we find
[57:37] with our Bible that it says they were
[57:39] sitting there for forty days with
[57:42] nothing going on nobody was making a
[57:48] move because the challenges went forth
[57:51] and it has stopped the children of
[57:54] Abraham dead in their tracks and they're
[57:56] afraid to go further now this is what
[57:59] what you see the difference between an
[58:01] intellectual conception and somebody's
[58:03] been anointed by a prophet
[58:08] do you hear me this is the difference
[58:11] between an intellectual conception
[58:13] because I tell you if you set 40 days in
[58:16] a tent and listen to what that devil is
[58:19] telling you pretty soon you're going to
[58:22] be scrutinizing every stone every tree
[58:25] you're going to find the excuses for
[58:26] every bit of thing that's going on
[58:28] you're going to be looking at every
[58:29] situation is that cloudy is it raining
[58:31] if you're here it's raining if it's this
[58:33] if it's that and you're gonna have all
[58:35] kinds of excuses why not to go down
[58:37] there and fight that battle but the
[58:39] difference between a man that's an
[58:41] anointed man and a man that's not
[58:43] anointed as soon as he hears the devil's
[58:45] challenge he's not looking at the
[58:50] circumstance he's looking at the rewards
[58:53] [Applause]
[58:58] Louie if I could just encourage your
[59:00] faith to smart this evening as children
[59:03] of God to know that if if your life is
[59:06] clear and you stand before God with the
[59:08] clear record Amen the devil stands
[59:10] before you today has a defeated person
[59:18] amen
[59:21] hey man is this alright
[59:24] yes let me go just a little bit further
[59:26] here now just to say this again brother
[59:29] madam said that you are not a Christian
[59:32] by your desire you're a Christian by
[59:35] God's desire how many know that you've
[59:41] been wondering about that poll in your
[59:43] life and what it is there it is
[59:45] it wasn't your desire first it was his
[59:47] desire that's why you came so he said no
[59:53] man can come to me except my father
[59:55] draws him first he was elected by God
[59:57] before the foundation of the world to be
[59:58] a Christian that's Scripture you know
[1:00:01] that's how we operate that's why a
[1:00:04] prophet came we had a situation in our
[1:00:06] church here a while back a lady had
[1:00:08] visited so she said in the congregation
[1:00:10] in the pre service and she's reading
[1:00:12] some of the tracks that we have out back
[1:00:14] and the one track she happen to pick up
[1:00:16] was serpent seed and so she's reading
[1:00:17] that and next thing we know she jumps up
[1:00:21] and she runs out of the church and she
[1:00:23] disappears we're in the country we're
[1:00:26] not in the city there and we're on a
[1:00:28] highway so obviously we're concerned
[1:00:31] she's disappeared she's not on the
[1:00:33] church grounds she's left and she's gone
[1:00:36] and so we go out and we begin searching
[1:00:38] we're up and down the roads we can't
[1:00:40] find her eventually
[1:00:41] I saw a lane that went up in the woods
[1:00:43] so I began to follow that lane it was
[1:00:44] somebody's house as a private Lane she's
[1:00:46] way up there by the house and so I go
[1:00:49] over and I just warn her of the dangers
[1:00:50] of leaving home without somebody and if
[1:00:55] we're bringing her back and she begins
[1:00:57] to tell me says you know what somebody
[1:01:00] needs to expose this church you tell
[1:01:04] them about the false doctrine that's in
[1:01:05] there and how you're caught and how you
[1:01:07] follow a man and all this has gone on so
[1:01:09] I'm just trying to bring her down from
[1:01:11] the boiling point and just get her down
[1:01:13] here so I said well why don't we just go
[1:01:15] under the pavilion and just talk a
[1:01:16] little bit and she's just raging she's
[1:01:18] raging at me he says somebody needs to
[1:01:20] to to expose this Church for what it is
[1:01:23] and she's praying like this against the
[1:01:25] church and I said listen lady so I want
[1:01:27] a something says my daddy was just like
[1:01:28] you
[1:01:31] she hated this message and she goes well
[1:01:36] bless his heart
[1:01:41] and I said and he's the one that built
[1:01:44] this church
[1:01:47] that says why don't we go into the
[1:01:49] pavilion and talk let's just talk about
[1:01:50] the word and so I sit there and I begin
[1:01:53] to talk to her and so she wanted to talk
[1:01:55] about the word so I just begin to take
[1:01:58] the scripture and just begin to talk
[1:02:00] about it and Vista she got angry again
[1:02:02] she goes I know where you're getting
[1:02:05] that I said I'm just quoting scripture
[1:02:11] to you yes but I know why you're getting
[1:02:12] it I says well what do you mean you're
[1:02:15] getting that from william branham I said
[1:02:19] thank you you have just given him the
[1:02:21] greatest compliment you could give him
[1:02:23] that that's the purpose of a prophet to
[1:02:26] turn the people back to the word
[1:02:31] that's the vindication and so if you
[1:02:34] don't have no answer you just had no way
[1:02:37] you're getting it hallelujah
[1:02:45] so David is coming on the scene at the
[1:02:48] time that Saul is a backslidden manis
[1:02:51] refused to go all the way with what the
[1:02:53] prophet of said so God said I have a man
[1:02:55] after my own heart
[1:02:58] not a man that wouldn't backslide that's
[1:03:00] not what he said but a man after my own
[1:03:02] heart a man that will fully follow me
[1:03:06] and this is what God is doing he is
[1:03:10] raising up a people in this hour whose
[1:03:12] eyes will be single and fully follow him
[1:03:17] why is this oh sitting here at this
[1:03:19] confrontation and not doing anything
[1:03:21] it's because of a failed priesthood
[1:03:23] because of a failed kingship and they
[1:03:26] can't go any further that's why God sent
[1:03:29] a prophet to anoint of people that would
[1:03:31] be outside of a denominational system
[1:03:33] and they would be anointed amen to
[1:03:35] accept what Eve turned down in the
[1:03:37] beginning what did Eve turned down that
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:03:40] and forever people I look across the
[1:03:42] room and I see Jesus Christ the same
[1:03:44] yesterday today and forever bearing the
[1:03:47] fruits of eternity the commandment of
[1:03:53] Moses in the book of Deuteronomy says
[1:03:55] when you go out to battle against your
[1:03:57] enemies and see horses and chariots and
[1:03:58] people more than now don't be afraid of
[1:04:00] them for the Lord that God is with thee
[1:04:04] which brought thee out of the land of
[1:04:06] Egypt so remember the same God that was
[1:04:09] back there in the age of campaign will
[1:04:11] be with you up here in this campaign and
[1:04:14] it shall be that when you come nigh into
[1:04:16] battle that the priest shall approach
[1:04:19] and speak into the people and shall say
[1:04:22] unto them hear o Israel you approach
[1:04:24] this day in the battle against your
[1:04:25] enemies don't let your hearts faint fear
[1:04:27] not do not tremble do not be terrified
[1:04:30] because of them for the Lord your God is
[1:04:32] he that goeth with you to fight for you
[1:04:36] against your enemies to save you
[1:04:40] this is what the priesthood is supposed
[1:04:42] to do this is what they're supposed to
[1:04:44] encourage the people of God in take the
[1:04:46] word of the Prophet and speak to the
[1:04:49] people that God is still here that God
[1:04:51] has not left them that you do not have
[1:04:54] to be afraid of the Giants of your hour
[1:04:56] because God is more and mightier than
[1:04:59] them and he's going to use you to prove
[1:05:01] it he's going to use you to prove it so
[1:05:09] there's a challenger a challengers come
[1:05:13] out the Bible says he's disdained David
[1:05:15] when he looked at him he disdained it
[1:05:19] what was he disdaining he was disdaining
[1:05:23] what the Prophet anointed he was
[1:05:26] disdaining the move of the hour
[1:05:28] he was disdaining the revival when he
[1:05:32] looked at David he did not see a revival
[1:05:34] he looked at his size he did not look at
[1:05:39] the majority he looked at his size are
[1:05:42] you with me
[1:05:43] amen and because of his size because of
[1:05:46] what he looked like
[1:05:46] that can't be the move of God these
[1:05:48] people don't know what they're done
[1:05:50] they've lost it how can this be a move
[1:05:56] of God what's so special about you well
[1:06:00] I hear God is saving people a university
[1:06:02] so what people out of university get
[1:06:05] saved all the time really that's one to
[1:06:09] chew over those they sure don't I I know
[1:06:12] if people going in and getting brain
[1:06:13] Washington leaving but to get saved out
[1:06:16] of it is another story and you in the
[1:06:19] university ought to thank God that God
[1:06:22] reaches where you're at let me give you
[1:06:25] another testimony the testimony my
[1:06:27] mother talked about how she stood and
[1:06:28] she wouldn't move and just kept
[1:06:29] believing we have a sister in our
[1:06:31] congregation that I can remember as a
[1:06:33] little boy we would go and visit them on
[1:06:35] the on the East Coast and and she
[1:06:37] believed the message and she had real
[1:06:39] small children and and her husband was a
[1:06:43] real unbeliever it was a Vietnam vet
[1:06:50] hooked on nicotine since he was age of
[1:06:53] eighteen chain-smoker one after the
[1:06:54] other hated the message and treated his
[1:06:59] children rough and so she stood and she
[1:07:02] stood and this has been year she just
[1:07:04] kept standing and standing her children
[1:07:06] they grew up they got to an age where
[1:07:07] they could get out of the home and they
[1:07:10] just went into the world the boy
[1:07:15] come hooked on drugs he's hooked on
[1:07:19] drugs for fifteen years and you know how
[1:07:22] it is when somebody sucked on drugs are
[1:07:23] getting saved every week until you if
[1:07:27] you don't hate that thing enough to say
[1:07:29] I'm gonna die it's staying there you got
[1:07:33] to get serious with God and so she just
[1:07:39] kept praying for her children asking God
[1:07:41] coming up for prayer praying for her
[1:07:43] children asking God's and this boy's
[1:07:45] left since the age of 20 he's been gone

[1:08:03] a boy in the church so she just kept
[1:08:06] asking for prayer kept holding on kept
[1:08:08] holding on the boy he'd come to church
[1:08:11] come to church he'd get saved go back go
[1:08:13] back slide again you know how it is one
[1:08:18] day that boy got serious he went out of
[1:08:22] his house at one o'clock in the morning
[1:08:24] went on the back porch and he got down
[1:08:26] on his knees and he told God he said God
[1:08:30] if you don't come down and do a work of
[1:08:32] my life here he said I am NOT gonna
[1:08:35] leave here until you do it he said I
[1:08:41] heard what you've been telling me over
[1:08:42] the pulpit that I need to die - what a
[1:08:44] half he said and I begin to pray like
[1:08:47] this and he said as I begin to praise
[1:08:49] that something begin to rise up in me
[1:08:50] like a sickness begin to come up and
[1:08:52] mean I begin to feel like I had to throw
[1:08:54] and just as the spirits begin to rise up
[1:08:56] like this he said the door to the
[1:08:58] neighbor's house
[1:08:59] opened up and a party broke out on the
[1:09:01] back porch of the neighbor's house and
[1:09:03] they're streaming and they're going on
[1:09:05] and I'm sitting in this thing is coming
[1:09:07] up and I'm asking God Lord let it go I
[1:09:10] want to die to Who I am and he said this
[1:09:12] thing he said all of a sudden he said
[1:09:15] the peace of God after about two hours
[1:09:16] is dropped
[1:09:18] he said when it dropped on me the party
[1:09:20] quit and they went back in the house now
[1:09:25] this is what he just told me recently he
[1:09:28] said it wasn't God deliver me of drugs

[1:09:38] to it my friends in the world and never
[1:09:41] got that image out of my mind but when
[1:09:44] that thing left it was that thing right
[1:09:47] there
[1:09:47] that had him hooked to everything else
[1:09:49] and when he got desperate with God God
[1:09:53] came down the party was over
[1:09:59] hey mater but that's not all
[1:10:03] God delivered him then he comes up and
[1:10:06] he stands with his wife and he said

[1:11:22] his daughter up for prayer and I noticed
[1:11:23] as I'm praying I'm like this I felt
[1:11:25] another hand come over my hand and I
[1:11:27] looked and there here it is as daddy has
[1:11:29] come up put both hands around him and
[1:11:31] he's praying and I just heard Friday as
[1:11:35] I come into Seattle Friday that the
[1:11:38] woman that the wife has been declared
[1:11:40] totally free
[1:11:41] [Applause]
[1:11:52] hey man I want to tell you here tonight
[1:11:55] there is not a situation in this room
[1:11:58] that our God hasn't already defeated
[1:12:01] we are facing at the feet at being today
[1:12:06] are you with me undefeated B and you
[1:12:11] tonight are proof that he's defeated I
[1:12:16] say man
[1:12:20] hallelujah you are proof you have the
[1:12:24] answer
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:30] I hope that's alright I'm just excited
[1:12:32] what God's doing down there I know God's
[1:12:34] doing something here hallelujah God said
[1:12:38] I will have a living epistle hallelujah
[1:12:43] you can have your debate you can have
[1:12:47] your question this has been settled
[1:12:55] you take these people they've been born
[1:12:58] out of this you think that worried about
[1:13:00] bridges and everything else
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:03] the revelation they have they're not
[1:13:06] worried about a bridge in Jeffersonville
[1:13:08] the revelation they have is the breach
[1:13:09] has been crossed whereas they once were
[1:13:13] aliens now they've been brought back now
[1:13:16] they're called sons and daughters of God
[1:13:17] now they're walking and freedom you can
[1:13:21] have that tonight amen
[1:13:26] I want to bring one more point to you
[1:13:32] what did David do why did he do what he
[1:13:36] did when he went down into the valley
[1:13:38] who could be so insane to go down into
[1:13:42] the valley without any natural armor
[1:13:44] without any natural weapon what was in
[1:13:48] his mind I'll tell you what was their
[1:13:50] brother venom said that boy didn't even
[1:13:53] pray about the situation he didn't have
[1:13:58] to see if it was the will of God or not
[1:14:00] he didn't have to wonder but the man
[1:14:04] said God had prayed him through from
[1:14:06] before the foundation of the world which
[1:14:09] means this was not an accidental battle
[1:14:12] it was a predestinated challenge
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] what's in his mind then godson a profit
[1:14:24] that profit anointed me Amen and I know
[1:14:27] that I go down it then I look at that
[1:14:29] enemy that the whole army of Israel
[1:14:30] hasn't been able to move for forty days
[1:14:33] and brother Bantam said this and I want
[1:14:34] you to listen real close he said it's
[1:14:36] not how long you make the battle linger
[1:14:38] he said that you stop it dad right now
[1:14:42] you might say here can I say well I've
[1:14:45] been battling lust I've been battling
[1:14:46] depression I've been let me tell you
[1:14:49] realize it's over
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:55] David looked down there and he saw this
[1:14:57] great child a champion from his youth a
[1:15:00] man that's never been defeated and he
[1:15:02] don't see that he sees brass he sees a
[1:15:06] man covered from head to toe in judgment
[1:15:09] he sees Amanda has no chance
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:16] I said a man that has no chance not tell
[1:15:20] you anybody in here that's bound tonight
[1:15:22] if you would have 20 believe it doesn't
[1:15:25] have a chance
[1:15:27] [Applause]
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] those things become unpopular now we're
[1:15:37] not supposed to talk like that anymore
[1:15:39] and that's the problem
[1:15:42] that's why churches are dying because a
[1:15:46] life is moving you know what brother BAM
[1:15:48] says you know my dad went to one message
[1:15:49] one brother Briscoe some about how he
[1:15:52] went to 30 my dad went to one it was how
[1:15:55] can I overcome you know what he did
[1:15:57] slept the whole service because he was
[1:16:02] still a Mennonite then so he just slept
[1:16:07] do you know what he missed in that
[1:16:09] service when he was there I know he
[1:16:13] heard it later on tape as my dad was an
[1:16:16] avid tape listener he said to overcome
[1:16:21] is to keep life in you
[1:16:26] is to keep life in you and he used the
[1:16:30] examples that I walked across with log
[1:16:31] the other day it looked like it was
[1:16:32] alive he said had the branches
[1:16:34] everything he said but it was rotted it
[1:16:36] was laying right in water he says just
[1:16:38] like a believer here lay right in the
[1:16:40] stream of life but if there's no life in
[1:16:43] there here rot twice as quick that's
[1:16:47] what's happening that's what they the
[1:16:49] rotten is what they call liberation the
[1:16:53] first thing they do is they go out they
[1:16:55] want to cut their hair they want to go
[1:16:56] do this I want to go yeah we're
[1:16:57] liberated you're legalists I'm not a
[1:16:59] legalist I do it because I love God I do
[1:17:03] it because he told me to be separate
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:10] hallelujah so he said it's to keep life
[1:17:15] in you that's the challenge in this
[1:17:17] house that's the secret of David when he
[1:17:19] come to the battle he came fin up he
[1:17:24] came set up and as soon as he heard the
[1:17:26] devil challenge he was ready
[1:17:30] amen and so I would ask you today the
[1:17:32] greatest thing you could pray for said
[1:17:34] God let me hunger you talked about
[1:17:38] fervency this morning let me hunger for
[1:17:41] the things of God for in that is my
[1:17:43] strength to fly a bulge David had the
[1:17:54] nerve to say because you have challenged
[1:17:58] the armies of the Living God and I'm
[1:17:59] going to speak for these people up there
[1:18:01] that aren't moving because you have
[1:18:03] challenged the armies of the Living God
[1:18:05] today I'll cut your head off and he
[1:18:09] looked at him and he disdained the move
[1:18:11] of God and he said there's no way that
[1:18:12] this can happen by you you are not the
[1:18:16] one that is called for this hour you're
[1:18:19] not up to my level of competition and
[1:18:21] David said you know what
[1:18:24] only to say this what what what the
[1:18:26] Giants saw did not make the night make
[1:18:29] him go right out his last will and
[1:18:31] testament so don't get all shook up
[1:18:38] because somebody out there won't believe
[1:18:40] what God is doing here he looked at him
[1:18:47] he said I'm a dog and my dog that you
[1:18:49] come out to me with staves I want you to
[1:18:53] know David didn't even go into the
[1:18:56] valley with stones
[1:18:57] he came with no ammunition but he saw
[1:19:04] the brook out there and he knew that in
[1:19:06] a brook there be stones he's not worried
[1:19:10] about it you know the devil always
[1:19:13] misses what God is doing
[1:19:15] do you think do you really think that
[1:19:19] one day here is a mule or a donkey he's
[1:19:24] out in the wind he's walking along and
[1:19:26] he staggers and he falls over and he
[1:19:27] dies do you really think the devil
[1:19:30] looked at that and said now there is a
[1:19:31] weapon of mass destruction we need to
[1:19:37] get somebody to come and clean that
[1:19:39] thing up because one day there be a
[1:19:41] child of God walk by here and have
[1:19:43] enough faith to grab what's left of that
[1:19:44] thing and he's going to go kill a
[1:19:46] thousand four listings with what's left
[1:19:49] now I say that's how God does it God
[1:19:53] allowed that thing to die just like he
[1:19:54] allowed that mountain range to be formed
[1:19:56] that when the Prophet is driving by he
[1:19:58] said look there I give you an
[1:19:59] everlasting sign God had put it there
[1:20:02] for him he had pre-planned his coming so
[1:20:13] when when but you know why you know why
[1:20:16] you know why the Felicity never saw it
[1:20:17] for what it was I had no inspiration
[1:20:19] inspiration is what shows that it's
[1:20:21] there and when Samson standing there
[1:20:24] inspiration comes upon him because the
[1:20:26] enemy has shouted inspiration and
[1:20:28] remember this is the beginning of the
[1:20:30] work against the Philistines this is the
[1:20:32] beginning
[1:20:33] amen and inspiration comes upon him that
[1:20:35] the ropes melt away and he looks and he
[1:20:38] says there it is a WMD and it picked it
[1:20:45] up and it against the swing and a
[1:20:47] thousand men died the rest are hiding
[1:20:50] and here's Sampson with the bone y'all
[1:20:56] want some of this come on out of those
[1:20:59] rocks I got more of it that's what
[1:21:01] brother Balaam said he did
[1:21:04] that's what inspiration will do huh
[1:21:11] don't need much to take a devil down he
[1:21:15] oh he needs it's another jawbone and
[1:21:20] jawbone is speaking right now I see if
[1:21:22] you would take the words that are coming
[1:21:24] out you too can drive it enemy out of
[1:21:26] your life
[1:21:29] so when David goes down listen David he
[1:21:32] strands here he looks at the enemy and
[1:21:34] the enemy looks at him
[1:21:36] they made their words they said what
[1:21:37] they is gonna say but there came a time
[1:21:39] and words are finished now it had to be
[1:21:41] left and David didn't go down there and
[1:21:44] dodge and look around and say does he
[1:21:46] see me
[1:21:48] you understand David was fighting two
[1:21:50] men he wasn't just fighting a giant his
[1:21:53] giant was so big he had somebody to
[1:21:54] carry his shield the Bible says nothing
[1:22:00] about that armor bare so I reckon he
[1:22:03] probably ran hallelujah it's just like
[1:22:06] we know these little little buddy Devils
[1:22:08] like to hang around to see what its
[1:22:10] gonna do when when the big do goes down
[1:22:12] then they go hey hey man the Bible says
[1:22:18] David ran to the battle he ran to the
[1:22:22] Philistine
[1:22:23] he knew what he had in his life let me
[1:22:27] just encourage you this evening aiming
[1:22:30] not to back up from the battle but you
[1:22:32] run to the battle because you know the
[1:22:35] god that you have with you
[1:22:40] same God that deliver man 45 years
[1:22:44] hooked on nicotine the same God that
[1:22:46] will deliver a woman with a deadly
[1:22:48] disease a same God that a deliverer a
[1:22:50] man that's a drug addict the same God a
[1:22:52] man has taken this one and taken this
[1:22:54] one this is what the devil has disdained
[1:22:56] but this is the hedges and the highways
[1:23:01] and I want to say that's the last move
[1:23:06] that's the last move then he say the
[1:23:10] place is full the harvest is ready it's
[1:23:14] going home time
[1:23:18] I wonder how many more David's we got in
[1:23:20] the room I said today I'm going to go
[1:23:22] out I'm gonna run to that panel
[1:23:26] I know that god I have is more than
[1:23:28] enough I hope this ain't too Pentecostal
[1:23:36] brother and I've never been a
[1:23:37] Pentecostal though and they'll make no
[1:23:41] excuses for you folks that don't like it
[1:23:44] hallelujah but I have tasted and saw a
[1:23:46] man that the Lord is good and I know
[1:23:49] what God has done in my family and in my
[1:23:51] life and I'm so thankful to say I know
[1:23:54] that it was God on my trail it was gone
[1:23:58] all the time can I make a statement here
[1:24:02] my son a little arrogant but you just
[1:24:04] taking any way you want to I had have
[1:24:05] been pre-planned by God you see before
[1:24:10] you the plan of God
[1:24:14] well no brother Dan you're trying to set
[1:24:16] yourself up make yourselves nothing no
[1:24:18] not at all I'm just part of you the body
[1:24:21] of Christ is the pre-planned design of
[1:24:25] God that he would come down and live in
[1:24:28] her and it would come to a showdown and
[1:24:31] he would not back down in that body just
[1:24:34] like he never backed down in that body
[1:24:38] and Jesus in that body in his first
[1:24:41] coming when he walked out there to a
[1:24:43] maniac that maniac came down listen let
[1:24:45] me just tell you how powerless the enemy
[1:24:47] is to stop a predestinated seed he was
[1:24:51] called Legion that wasn't his name but
[1:24:54] he was represented by The Devil's that
[1:24:56] he had anything like today you would
[1:24:58] call him gamer something along that line
[1:25:03] you get the drift digital whatever you
[1:25:09] know I saw brother Ed losing track of
[1:25:11] his notes and made me realize that my
[1:25:13] daddy did that and you know I got an
[1:25:14] iPad I still lose track of mine I have a
[1:25:18] digital mess Amen God in his body and
[1:25:26] here is a man by the name of Legion
[1:25:29] comes down with over a thousand demons
[1:25:32] because this is a legion he comes down
[1:25:36] they can't stop him it isn't one isn't
[1:25:43] two it's a legion and he comes down and
[1:25:46] he falls there and here brother BAM said
[1:25:49] is a little bitty man standing there and
[1:25:53] those demons recognize what's anymore
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:26:01] and they begin to scream out I love this
[1:26:05] what are you doing in that little bitty
[1:26:07] body you see Goliath never recognized
[1:26:14] that that boy had been anointed by a
[1:26:16] prophet and the Bible said the Spirit of
[1:26:21] the Lord came upon him from that day he
[1:26:24] didn't see him he saw the boy and these
[1:26:29] demons are recognizing Jesus for who he
[1:26:32] is and said you have come to torment us
[1:26:34] can I give another testimony
[1:26:37] I was in Mexico a while back and I had a
[1:26:40] brother come to me a minister there and
[1:26:41] begin to tell me about an old old
[1:26:43] Mexican preacher who just really had had
[1:26:46] believed in divine healing and just had
[1:26:49] a real gift of faith in his life he pray
[1:26:52] for people in one day he's praying for
[1:26:54] this girl and she's demon-possessed and
[1:26:57] the demon speaks out of this girl in a
[1:27:00] man's voice and says she is mine and
[1:27:03] nothing you can do will make me come out
[1:27:08] of her he said I didn't know what to do
[1:27:13] said so I all of a sudden inspiration
[1:27:16] came and he went and got a book of the
[1:27:20] Prophet now you're not going to find
[1:27:22] this on the websites just so you know a
[1:27:24] man he found a book of the Prophet that
[1:27:26] had a picture of him and she he brought
[1:27:30] it back to this girl and he opened it up
[1:27:32] to the picture now this is gonna really
[1:27:35] seem fanatic if it blows your mind good
[1:27:38] and he held up and he spoke to the girl
[1:27:41] said do you recognize this man
[1:27:43] and that demon spoke out and says yes I
[1:27:47] was thrown out of one of his meetings in
[1:27:50] Arkansas and so this little Mexican
[1:27:54] preacher stood up and said then in the
[1:27:56] name of Jesus Christ who William Branham
[1:27:58] preached and the woman was delivered
[1:28:07] now the intellectuals will say there's
[1:28:09] nowhere in the Bible by anybody held up
[1:28:11] a book and showed a picture you're right
[1:28:12] there wasn't I sorry about that but
[1:28:14] there is somewhere in the Bible amen
[1:28:15] where there was a deem of the demon in
[1:28:17] attack seven man because they didn't
[1:28:20] have the life of Jesus Christ
[1:28:23] and they says Jesus we know and Paul we
[1:28:26] know but who are you but so I tell you
[1:28:32] as an anointed son of God that if you
[1:28:35] have been filled with his spirit the
[1:28:37] devil knows exactly who you are he knows
[1:28:40] why you're here and he is trembling
[1:28:43] before you for the Dominion that is in
[1:28:46] force right now is the dominion over sin
[1:28:49] the flesh and the devil how many believe
[1:28:55] that I said how many believe that then I
[1:28:58] want to read you about four more quotes
[1:28:59] and we're done
[1:29:00] because you believe it hallelujah
[1:29:03] hey man I'm so glad to know that they
[1:29:06] God I served tonight is alive they don't
[1:29:12] seem much to people but I've seen him
[1:29:15] hey man I've seen him now whether
[1:29:21] brother Edie had a word this morning by
[1:29:23] the name of mixture II and I'm gonna use
[1:29:27] one at all right and that's the word
[1:29:32] nook
[1:29:38] this is not another word you're finding
[1:29:41] the Webster dictionary relevance and I'm
[1:29:44] beginning to feel religious he said the
[1:29:46] law of life is in us he says you are
[1:29:49] made and born and placed in the body of
[1:29:51] Christ
[1:29:52] as sons and daughters of God you don't
[1:29:54] have to knock down to the devil we have
[1:30:02] got a law and that's the law of the Holy
[1:30:04] Spirit and the only thing you have to
[1:30:06] know and have to do is to know how to
[1:30:08] let go and let God that's one you don't
[1:30:16] have to knock and the devil tells you
[1:30:19] anything you don't have to knock down to
[1:30:21] him the next time he comes to you says
[1:30:24] I'm not knocking down to you and if he
[1:30:27] says what does that mean just go to read
[1:30:28] what the prophet said about it
[1:30:30] hallelujah brother Bentham said that
[1:30:32] when Sampson come out there's a little
[1:30:34] curly-haired shrimp the lion comes to
[1:30:36] him and he's a little drawer from
[1:30:37] and like every man is without God and he
[1:30:40] was a weakling him but all at once when
[1:30:42] the lion come to get him the hidden
[1:30:44] power in him came out and slew it like a
[1:30:49] lamb but was it the hidden power that is
[1:30:54] there comes out amen
[1:30:58] hey man so that this is important for us
[1:31:00] to realize I'm talking to you about the
[1:31:02] attitude that David had when he went
[1:31:04] down to meet the Giant he knew why he
[1:31:07] was there hallelujah
[1:31:11] hey man all right just bear with me
[1:31:20] brother branham said said we can take
[1:31:24] the word we believe the word we know
[1:31:26] that it's true he said but for the
[1:31:27] majority of the people it hasn't become
[1:31:29] a reality he said if we stand here
[1:31:33] tonight and say that we believe that
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ died for us that his blood
[1:31:38] has washed us from ever since then also
[1:31:40] we must believe that we have become the
[1:31:42] very righteousness of God he said if you
[1:31:45] cannot believe that you become the very
[1:31:46] rights
[1:31:47] of God neither can you believe that the
[1:31:49] blood has made atonement for you he said
[1:31:53] for the majority of the people it's not
[1:31:54] real so what do we do if revelation is
[1:31:57] above you you look up and you ask God
[1:31:58] for it God reveals to me this reality of
[1:32:03] the word so that I can run to the battle
[1:32:09] Amen hallelujah Amen okay here brother
[1:32:14] BAM said this Satan to G he said Jesus
[1:32:16] said if you can believe he said all
[1:32:20] things are possible and he looks down he
[1:32:23] said that an Indian woman sitting out
[1:32:25] here she has her head down prayin and
[1:32:27] she's got a comb in her hair the angel
[1:32:28] the Lord that light hangs over the woman
[1:32:30] she's suffering with hayfever that's
[1:32:32] right Indian lady Jesus Christ makes you

[1:33:32] miss prophet it'll have to leave her and
[1:33:35] that demon was calling for help for help
[1:33:39] to accumulate unbelief now this is
[1:33:42] what's happening demons are calling for
[1:33:46] help to accumulate unbelief there even
[1:33:48] put this out of people who don't believe
[1:33:51] will let me be on the other list that's
[1:33:56] the list you talked about the Lamb's
[1:33:58] Book of Life
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:03] unbelief is accumulating and demons are
[1:34:10] calling for help but faith is gathering
[1:34:15] I wonder what's happening in the room
[1:34:19] right now oh if I could just say this
[1:34:22] that faith is gathering demons are
[1:34:25] calling do you know what it means when
[1:34:31] demons begin to cry out that means they
[1:34:36] lost their hold that means the end is
[1:34:40] near
[1:34:46] somebody help me somebody help me
[1:34:49] somebody help me no you get out of here
[1:34:52] I bind every spirit in the name of Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ for the glory of the kingdom of
[1:34:57] God
[1:34:58] that's the rights that's the rights of a
[1:35:04] child of God
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] how could it be I said how could it be
[1:35:13] that a little beaten down woman a
[1:35:15] prostitute she never saw the cloud she
[1:35:21] never saw the red she open she never saw
[1:35:23] the mana come down she never said saw
[1:35:25] them the cloud on top of the mountain
[1:35:27] she saw none of it she only heard a
[1:35:29] message and said I believe what I have
[1:35:31] heard now I want to token from it I'm
[1:35:36] talking if there's any child of God no
[1:35:38] matter how low they are they ask for a
[1:35:40] token got a sound give it to you this is
[1:35:47] why it's not red but they gave her a red
[1:35:48] token she said if you hang it out here
[1:35:51] you leave it out here and you go get
[1:35:55] your family and bring them in your house
[1:35:58] will be saved I don't know brother Tom
[1:36:02] what why would God have confidence in a
[1:36:04] prostitute just give a message I'll tell
[1:36:09] you why because God had given her a
[1:36:11] token and he believed in his token
[1:36:14] enough and when those messengers go back
[1:36:17] to Joshua and they begin to say what
[1:36:19] they have done
[1:36:20] brother Bentham said Joshua said that's
[1:36:22] what I sent you to do amen and so Joshua
[1:36:27] had sent those messages to see if
[1:36:29] anybody in that defeated city would have
[1:36:33] enough thought about him to ask for a
[1:36:35] token she wasn't interested in going
[1:36:38] back and cut her hair she won the
[1:36:40] interested in seeing how close to the
[1:36:41] world she lived she wanted a token
[1:36:48] God said I believe so much in my token
[1:36:51] you go out and be the voice of it you
[1:36:53] little lady you little lady
[1:36:55] you go out and be the voice of that
[1:36:56] token and here's a little prostitute now
[1:36:59] you come in you come in and they
[1:37:01] believed her
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:06] Joshua they crossed over the move of God
[1:37:09] was on it was transitioning time the
[1:37:11] walls were getting ready to come down
[1:37:12] and Joshua said I'm gonna go scout out
[1:37:14] and brother BAM said he's out there
[1:37:15] close to the walls close to where that
[1:37:19] woman's house is and he looks and
[1:37:22] there's a man with a drawn sword do you
[1:37:27] know what a drawn sword means it means
[1:37:29] if you get a little closer you're in
[1:37:30] trouble this is action now where is he
[1:37:37] standing I'll tell you where he's
[1:37:39] standing he's standing where that token
[1:37:41] is and he tells Joshua the ground you're
[1:37:45] on is holy ground what made that ground
[1:37:50] holy what made that place holy a woman
[1:37:55] believes the Word of God so much that he
[1:37:59] himself would come down
[1:38:08] hey man I'm ready to deliver her hey man
[1:38:12] I'm ready to deliver her of the city I'm
[1:38:14] ready to deliver her of her past I'm
[1:38:16] ready to deliver it of all and that
[1:38:23] worked under the blood of bulls and
[1:38:29] goats it worked under the blood of bulls
[1:38:34] and goats it worked
[1:38:38] faith is gathering what are you scared
[1:38:41] about are you a war afraid to take his
[1:38:43] word for anything don't be afraid
[1:38:46] call the thing right I am an heir to
[1:38:49] this I wonder if anybody here tonight
[1:38:53] can join their words with the voice of a
[1:38:55] prophet and say I am heir to this and he
[1:39:00] says I know I don't deserve it but I'm
[1:39:01] an heir anyhow and because I'm an heir I
[1:39:05] receive it that's it there you are
[1:39:08] because I'm an heir where salvation heir
[1:39:10] of the Holy Spirit I'm an heir because
[1:39:12] jesus paid the price nothing I've done I
[1:39:15] fell heir to it
[1:39:17] I'm healed because I'm an error why was
[1:39:21] Michael's life heal because she was an
[1:39:24] heir perfect assurance Jesus is mine for
[1:39:32] - oh what a foretaste of glory divine
[1:39:34] air salvation purchase of God born of
[1:39:36] the Spirit Washington's but that's our
[1:39:38] story
[1:39:39] then Satan can't stand that because he's
[1:39:43] a defeated being again we're strangers
[1:39:52] to one another young lady you believed
[1:39:54] Christ knows us both here's the woman at
[1:39:56] the well and our Savior you're not her
[1:39:57] and neither am i he but his spirit lives
[1:40:00] forever and this young woman standing
[1:40:02] here if you could see it between her and
[1:40:03] I is a lie - this angel of light stands
[1:40:06] here but beyond that as a shadow in that
[1:40:08] shadow is death and darkness it's a
[1:40:10] cancer it's located in the rectum and
[1:40:13] you're not from this country you're not
[1:40:15] at you're a Kentuckian that's right mrs.
[1:40:17] Johnson I'll tell you what if you
[1:40:21] believe with all your heart go back home
[1:40:22] and Jesus Christ makes you well do you
[1:40:24] believe that I condemn the devil that's
[1:40:27] taken the life of this woman and on the
[1:40:30] basis
[1:40:30] the resurrection of Jesus Christ I now
[1:40:33] challenge Satan and tell him he is a
[1:40:40] defeated B and he says as God's servant
[1:40:54] under the anointing the Holy Ghost that
[1:40:55] the Commission given me by an angel I
[1:40:57] condemned this devil for the woman's
[1:40:59] life let her live O Lord amen
[1:41:01] return home and rejoice and be happy
[1:41:03] thanking the Lord don't doubt now don't
[1:41:06] have a doubt in your mind again may the
[1:41:16] devil be defeated in our lives and we
[1:41:18] know he is defeated because he is a
[1:41:20] defeated being I wonder when's the last
[1:41:22] time you talked about that I wonder
[1:41:27] when's the last time you talked about
[1:41:28] how the fee that he is instead of aiming
[1:41:31] point o you know I just barely make it I
[1:41:33] just do this I do that I make so many
[1:41:35] mistakes mother man said if you look
[1:41:36] back you're never overcome you say well
[1:41:43] I know that but are you doing it he says
[1:41:48] may the devil be defeated in our lives
[1:41:50] and we know he's defeated because he is
[1:41:51] the defeated being and Satan I turn to
[1:41:54] you now to say this you are defeated
[1:42:01] she were afraid to say that you are
[1:42:06] defeated and you're not afraid of us but
[1:42:10] you're afraid of the one we're speaking
[1:42:11] about you see the giant wasn't afraid of
[1:42:14] David but he could have seen who was
[1:42:16] there you have lost every bit of power
[1:42:24] you ever had you were defeated at
[1:42:28] Calvary he sends it by saying I'll just
[1:42:35] stay shedding with God keep believing
[1:42:36] now if all your heart and horde I
[1:42:37] believe that you heal me right now I
[1:42:39] believe because I laid my hand on this
[1:42:41] man here he laid his hand on me and on
[1:42:43] this woman she laid her hand on me I was
[1:42:45] led to do that I was led to lay my hand
[1:42:47] on this person they were led to lay
[1:42:49] their hands on me and the same Holy
[1:42:51] Ghost that told Simeon and gave him the
[1:42:53] promise led me to do this while we're
[1:42:55] right here in this place of divine
[1:42:56] healing now I believe Lord Satan you
[1:43:00] might as well get away from me because
[1:43:02] I'm a seed of Abraham by Jesus Christ
[1:43:05] and I take the preeminence I hope you
[1:43:17] like reading quotes
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:20] our Heavenly Father in the sacredness of
[1:43:23] this moment when decisions must be made
[1:43:25] when men will live or die
[1:43:27] these Christians have made their
[1:43:28] confession because of your presence and
[1:43:30] at the scripture telling us that we're
[1:43:32] at the end time and they have their
[1:43:34] hands laid upon each other which is your
[1:43:35] word commissioning your church heavens
[1:43:37] and earth will pass away but my words
[1:43:38] shall never fail
[1:43:39] therefore Satan you are a defeated being
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:47] how does that become effective because
[1:43:51] there is a people believing in the
[1:43:53] Commission so you have no legal rights
[1:43:57] to begin with to to mark torment these
[1:43:58] people you're a bluff and we're calling
[1:44:00] that bluff Jesus Christ defeated you in
[1:44:03] his death and resurrection his blood
[1:44:05] paid every price of sin that you caused
[1:44:07] the family of the human race into and
[1:44:08] now we are sons and daughters of God
[1:44:11] again and his anointed spirit is
[1:44:14] speaking with us this evening as he did
[1:44:17] with Adam therefore you cannot hold
[1:44:20] these Christians any longer I adjure
[1:44:24] thee by the Living God you depart from
[1:44:26] these sick people with a faith listen

[1:46:02] predominating Jesus Christ drive the
[1:46:06] enemy out of my thoughts and out of my
[1:46:09] realms my prophet told me that a man can
[1:46:13] live a life so close to God
[1:46:15] that the devil will run out of options
[1:46:16] he will not know what to do with you he
[1:46:19] cannot confuse you he cannot get you
[1:46:22] away from the message he can't make you

[1:46:54] question
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] can I just say something brother man
[1:47:01] said that's why the devil's howling
[1:47:03] that's why he's trying to shut her up
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:12] we live in an hour
[1:47:14] they despise the voice they call it
[1:47:16] names they do this they do that we just
[1:47:18] received the news not long ago you all
[1:47:20] heard about it Amon how Amen the
[1:47:22] Pentecostals being called by the Pope
[1:47:23] let's all be brothers we're brothers
[1:47:25] let's all come together like Joseph and
[1:47:26] his brothers I love you You Love Me
[1:47:27] we're a big happy family so we played
[1:47:33] all those 20-something minutes of quotes
[1:47:35] of these guys talking these Pentecostals
[1:47:37] and how they prayed in the spirit to the
[1:47:40] pope and blessed him then they stood up
[1:47:43] there and shivered and shook and said
[1:47:46] fifty years ago
[1:47:47] this wasn't possible so then we stopped
[1:47:53] it then we put on the voice of the
[1:47:56] prophet who fifty years ago said it
[1:47:59] would happen and we're sitting there and
[1:48:01] we're listening to these guys talk and
[1:48:03] laugh and gone then the prophets voice
[1:48:05] come on and the Holy Spirit dropped in
[1:48:08] the road
[1:48:10] I still love that voice I tell you God
[1:48:16] still loves that voice and God ordained
[1:48:18] two people to keep that voice alive I
[1:48:22] said God ordained two people let me be
[1:48:26] one of them I said let me be one of them
[1:48:29] to keep that voice alive
[1:48:33] let me be one
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:38] there was a little woman I said there
[1:48:42] was a little woman Jesus spoke to the
[1:48:45] Pharisees this is what really made a man
[1:48:50] he said as it was in the days of Elijah
[1:48:56] there were many widows in that day there
[1:49:00] were many Jewish widows in that day but
[1:49:03] there was a Gentile Jewish Widow I
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:07] ordained her to be the one to entertain
[1:49:11] that prophet she would keep the voice of
[1:49:14] that prophet alive I hope I'm not too
[1:49:21] fanatical but I have been ordained you
[1:49:25] have been ordained and understand here
[1:49:27] and be the voice like Rahab the harlot
[1:49:29] was the voice not you no not you it
[1:49:38] couldn't be you how can it be I disdain

[1:49:52] beginning to call him names when he
[1:49:54] began to assume his position should I

[1:50:00] when David began to assume his position
[1:50:03] in Christ in what God had made him they
[1:50:06] begin to call him names
[1:50:12] but David wasn't worried you see because
[1:50:16] these guys been up there for 40 days

[1:51:29] Saul's not fighting his kingship is over
[1:51:33] his reign is over he hasn't received
[1:51:35] Samuel as that vindicated prophet so
[1:51:40] he's lost the m-19 and David has been
[1:51:42] raised up to finish the work that Samson
[1:51:45] started
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:48] so it was the harvest time of the
[1:51:50] Philistines it was their time to go

[1:52:15] if it worked for you you would be out
[1:52:17] there doing something about it you're
[1:52:23] only trying to pull people away from
[1:52:25] confrontation with the enemy
[1:52:27] you're not helping anything you build
[1:52:33] any why are you so militant against this
[1:52:35] because I see when it's done aiming in
[1:52:37] my church and how these people come in
[1:52:40] and they come in leading silly women
[1:52:42] captive I always wondered how it could
[1:52:45] happen how do men creep into houses and
[1:52:48] lead silly women captive until I
[1:52:49] realized it could be done through an
[1:52:51] internet connection so God has to raise
[1:52:57] up men of God that will stand against
[1:53:00] such
[1:53:03] brother BAM said you must discern and
[1:53:07] withstand oh it doesn't really matter no

[1:54:05] who Jesus Christ would be and he comes

[1:57:42] predestinated Bride of Christ now the
[1:57:44] church the word seed with everything
[1:57:47] that God promised to put in the church
[1:57:49] is in it now and it's in it now
[1:57:51] everything is in order the Holy Spirit
[1:57:53] has been given the seed has been sold
[1:57:55] the evening lights have been signing the
[1:57:57] sign of solemn jesus promised us here in
[1:57:59] Malachi 4 a predestinated church and he
[1:58:02] stops and he says o devil
[1:58:11] Church of the Living God here and on
[1:58:13] tape that's me on tape do you know where
[1:58:18] you stand do you know you're caught of
[1:58:20] God that the Holy Ghost
[1:58:22] reigns in your heart and every word of
[1:58:25] God is real to you oh brother
[1:58:31] how is Satan gonna stand against that
[1:58:34] how is he going to stop it from growing
[1:58:38] how is he gonna keep the signs from
[1:58:40] following he could throw them in the
[1:58:43] jail they were fed to the Lions
[1:58:45] they were sawed asunder they were jerked
[1:58:48] to pieces and you can't kill a church
[1:58:50] that's predestinate how do you know but
[1:58:53] at any cost you're here
[1:58:56] there were your brothers
[1:58:58] then we're your sisters jerk killed
[1:59:00] eight bylines and you're here lord help
[1:59:10] us to see hey man you can't kill a
[1:59:14] church for destinated those he foreknew
[1:59:16] like he did Jesus He has called those he
[1:59:18] corney's justified those he justified
[1:59:20] he's already glorified they are
[1:59:23] predestinated and now in the last day
[1:59:27] with every seed sold everything in order
[1:59:30] the world in its order the time shaped
[1:59:33] up the church and order the seed the
[1:59:37] Living Light the evening lights the
[1:59:39] signs like he said as it was in the days
[1:59:41] of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit
[1:59:44] coming down performing signs like he did
[1:59:47] then Malachi 4 promised he would sin in
[1:59:51] the last days what he promised and we
[1:59:53] see it here well where and he says a man
[2:00:00] a man a man a man a man do you love him
[2:00:06] so in the last days a predestinated
[2:00:10] church knowing where they're standing
[2:00:12] sewed with the seed the Holy Spirit in
[2:00:15] the church then this is what he said
[2:00:18] Satan be careful
[2:00:35] why should Satan be careful because the
[2:00:39] seed has come back to what it was what
[2:00:46] was it in the original what wasn't in
[2:00:48] the original man could walk and they
[2:00:51] would lay people down just so the shadow
[2:00:55] would fall just a few days before
[2:00:58] brother misko spoke about him he had
[2:01:00] denied the Lord three times but now
[2:01:04] after the filling of the Holy Spirit he
[2:01:07] stands as a son of God
[2:01:10] and demons are afraid of his shadow so
[2:01:17] I'll leave it with this Satan be careful
[2:01:19] be careful be careful you don't know who
[2:01:23] you're dealing with here tonight
[2:01:32] this should be the name of Google
[2:01:58] amen brother let's go ray he's the same
[2:02:03] yesterday today and forever
[2:02:06] [Applause]
