TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] I was pastoring been pastoring three and a half years and I was kind of filled with I won't say disillusionment but it was we didn't know you know I had good friends that were Trinitarians and good friends which were Jesus only and we didn't seem to put a lot of importance to it because no one should answer it and then I had heard that you know brother Branham was now speaking some things and I had huge huge questions about it but one day just one day one meeting I happened to have my friend bud Southwick and he always stayed in our house in Dawson Creek and ALW Rasmussen who used to pastor in Edmonton and then he pastored in Tacoma and he was a very very dear friend of brother from Chicago and that whole community was a very closed community and so he said to me he was in my home that one time just once and brother Rasmussen said brother Eddie why don't you write brother Branham and invite him to go on a hunt he said you know perhaps then you could have some meetings as well he said he loves to hunt you know and so that was just enough to nudge me forward and I wrote brother Branham I remember writing a letter and while I wrote the letter my mind was telling me you'll never hear from him he probably gets a hundred thousand letters a month and I thought well this is this just doesn't make sense anyway I wrote and I posted the letter in Dawson Creek and right after that I had resigned the church and came down here to the west coast of British Columbia bought 800 miles south and started to minister to the native Indian people and about three weeks later I got a a phone call a letter from brother Brennan saying that he'd like to go on a hunt and perhaps we can have some meetings in Grand Prairie and Dawson Creek thus that tied those meetings then we arranged those meetings and and I had all these questions about the ministry about the absolute Ezzor is there some definitive absolute on the Godhead and on the baptism and all my how the world opened up then and I so that's why when I was on the platform and I say to you I was there and I found that what he spoke was the truth but yet my heart had some big questions in it but I mean I see the soldier boy it's called elements after clone discs people from my church are called out and he relates exactly things that I know are taking place in their homes and here now I'm with him and driving up the Alaskan Highway to the hunting territory and this is where everything changed because I was one day III actually went on the hunting trip to keep the cost down I was doing the cooking and so one one of the evenings brother branham just said I think I'll just go out and maybe yeah rabid or something for account weight and he said would you like to come brother Eddie I said yes I would like to show and brother Chris Berg who was a dear friend of brother Browns he said yeah maybe I'll come too sure brother Brown said why don't you tell him brother Chris nope he said I'm gonna stay and do the dishes he said you go brother ready we were at camping so we walk along brother branham ride on a path it was a short distance and I could see he was really interested in it was a beautiful evening he was mentioned in hunting I wasn't it at all interested and he walked over in a short distance and just sat on of a log and I sat right beside him and our knees were almost touching and so I wanted to ask a question they have to listen very closely now I was curious why all this manifestation which was so powerful and so real and how the basic element of it could deteriorate and I just I couldn't understand it and that's why it was so disillusioned I thought something's wrong something's wrong so I said to brother Branham I said how is it that people can prophesy they can speak in tongues that can interpret operate the gift of the Spirit can preach and they become so anointed and I said I know what the anointing is and brother Branham said have you heard my service on full anointed ones and I kind of dropped my head because I had not heard a lot of tapes and I said oh no I haven't heard that you know what the strange thing was brother Branham hadn't preached that for five years yet it was five years later that he would preach that service false anointed ones but he said to me he said no the wheat and the tares grow in the same field he said you tell me what the wheat rejoiced in and I'll tell you what the tares rejoiced in and I said yeah I still wasn't getting it he said in the last days Peter said in the last days I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh and he asked me about all and I said all flesh he said ALL but he said not all flesh is saved I said yeah I was beginning to see that there was there was a point here that he was making yeah and then when he got to the wheat and the tares I begin to see and then he said you know like my sheep hear my voice no not all my shape not all or my shape and I begin to see yeah there was something I really he said they're anointed they're they're genuinely anointed but they're wrong seed and I begin to see that that's clearly taught in the scriptures I would like to say to the people who hear this I met the master I didn't meet just William random him I knew but I met the master their God that he served and he said I was riding on my horse this afternoon behind brother bud and the son was war and I believe he said that you have three questions you want to ask me was exactly the truth my heart was just completely exposed he said the first one is on the baptism and he took him in the order they were in my heart and the Serpent's seed I didn't even want to discuss but he said the first one is the baptism the second one is the Godhead and the third one is the Serpent's seed and I knew that if he avoided the scripture you know just avoided that Scripture I knew the Word of God was the absolute but I didn't understand it and when he said the serpent seed I said but brother Branham I was so wound up I rearranged my finger Mountain is his respect I just raised my finger I said but the scripture says and Adam knew his wife and she conceived call his name came privacy demand from the Lord he said of course is from the Lord all life comes from God doesn't matter whether it's a right relationship or wrong relationship all life comes from God and I said yeah he said but you need to read the next verse I didn't know what the next verse was and she again bare his brother Abel said they were twins that's when I knew I'd missed something there were twins he said they've always been twins Cain and Abel Isaac and Ishmael Jacob and Esau he said at Calvary there wasn't three that died it was four well that was know and he had his hand up like that he said Jesus and Judas Jesus and one thief and Judas and the other thief and he went like that and he said he took one his way Jesus took one thief to heaven and Judas the son of perdition took one his way and then I realized it said then there were Antichrist in Christ Christ and Antichrist every every revival Bears twins and I could understand what was happening and what I was disillusioned about I knew one thing that my heart had been exposed and I was like naked before God and there was nothing hidden with God and that's the way it was with the people on the platform that's why he asked not hundreds thousands and thousands is that true is that true it was always true not one time in all of the lives in all of the years of ministry not one time did anyone say no that's not true it was always true and that's why it was the Spirit of Truth and that was the Spirit of Truth coming to me and I can say that all my questions were answered and have been answered by the word ever since and that is the truth and one thing I can say I met one along I met the god that the woman at the well man saying Lord Jesus [Music] now I feel [Music] yeah [Applause] you [Music]
