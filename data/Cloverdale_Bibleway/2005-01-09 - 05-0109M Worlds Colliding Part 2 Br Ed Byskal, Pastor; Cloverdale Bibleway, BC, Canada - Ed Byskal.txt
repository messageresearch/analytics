I'm ask brother Ricardo, brother Ricardo, if you'd come and open the service this morning in a word of prayer. Sister Dorothia. His note here says, "I want to thank and praise God for protecting me after I hit an ice patch and other car and I collided head on and we both were not hurt." Amen. The Keer family would like to thank the Saints for their prayers and labors of love for Mark's funeral. It was a tremendous testimony for family and relatives alike. And uh want to remember in prayer this morning, continue to remember the Keer family. There's a request from uh brother Gary and sister Lisa St. John in Orlando with Samuel. He's got a bad respiratory infection again. They're requesting prayer for him. Uh Sister Sheila is requesting prayer for brother Peta, uh who's at home with a swollen left foot from slipping in the snow. Um, Sister Roxan um says, "My dad said to thank everyone for their prayers and that he appreciated them. Please continue to remember him in prayer as he's in extreme pain today and we're believing for a complete deliverance." Uh, and I want to continue to thank everyone for prayers for my dad. He's at home and uh, he's doing much better. And uh we just appreciate all of your prayers and the thoughts. Um brother Ernie called last night from Indonesia and he was standing outside the airport and said there must have been a hundred ambulances in the area. He said the devastation and the hardship on the people is beyond comprehension. So we want to remember those that are suffering from uh a tidal wave. Also, Brother Luis called from Argentina this morning. He asked that we greet the congregation. They've been blessed by the messages they've received and uh we want to continue to remember them in prayer as well. Amen. How many have a need they want to be remembered before the Lord as we go to prayer. If you're listening in over the internet hookup or over the phone lines, you just lift your need, whatever would be before the Lord as well. Amen. Brother Ricardo, [Music] let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we just want to slow down, Lord. We want to thank you, Lord God. We don't want to get in any repetition of raising our hands, Lord God, or when the song leader says something, Lord God, but we want it to come straight from our hearts. We want to praise you, Lord God. Take us out of any type of formalness, Lord. Take anything away that's not of you, Lord, and let it come straight from our souls. For you said, Lord Jesus, whatever we have need of is already there. So, we're asking, Lord God, that our hearts would rejoice knowing that you're the one who put it there in the first place. Father God, there's many prayer requests, many needs. You know, every single one of them, and I can't remember them, Lord, but you saw them, they were pinned down, Lord God. Maybe the ones who are here, the ones who are at home sick, the ones over the internet, Lord, you know our every need. So we ask you, would you just come and would you touch it? Would you touch us here, Lord God, from the musicians to the song leaders to the minister, Lord God, we all have needs, Lord God. I have needs, Lord Jesus. We all come up short, but Father God, you said you'd be the finisher of our faith. So we're asking you, would you pour out abundantly and what our hearts receive it, Lord? We love you, Lord God. And we just want to tell you we need you more than ever. We need you now, Lord God. Would you come on the scene, Father God? Would you do that work, Lord God, that maybe our mind says impossible, but what we know that you said that if we ask, we shall receive. We ask you just put the minister out of the way, Lord God. Be with us today. Slow us down, Lord God, and give us revelation upon the words that are spoken. We need you, Lord. We love you, and we commit this day before you. In your blessed name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. Got a lot of announcements here this morning. And uh we're not going to have a service tonight and uh a lot of reasons. I uh I know the roads in the US and in the valley we were out uh just out even towards Alder Grove yesterday. There's a lot of blowing snow across the road and uh there's snow predicted again for tonight apparently. And uh you know some of you young young bucks may say, "Hey man, I can drive through the snow." But you got to remember that uh there are some older people who maybe uh don't uh have an easy time as you do and not everyone has got as reliable transportation and uh brother Lance has a message on his heart and we want to make sure that we don't have the church half empty when he's speaking and want to make sure that we've got everybody here to hear it. So, we just uh um I know that this the uh I5 is extremely slip slippery and um and it's just not safe to drive. So, um so there's not going to be any um service tonight, but you can uh spend the time to bless somebody here in the congregation. I'm sure uh be a wonderful time of fellowship that you could have. Um, we have a petition at the back of the church on behalf of brother Al Alons and his family. Uh, we'd appreciate if everyone here at the church could sign it and um to deal with uh immigration issues and uh want to make sure that we do everything we can to uh to help brother Alons and his family. Um, we want to um remind everyone of uh the marriage that's going to be next Saturday here at the church at 10:00. Sister Licia Hart, Brother Mike Anderson, and we're really looking forward to that and uh know God will bless them. So, let's be in prayer for that. I want to um sure that everyone knows that it's at 10:00 here at the church next Saturday, January 15th. Um, Brother Tony has been arranging a possible tour of Israel for May. However, uh it has been decided not to go ahead with these plans at this time. If you've got any questions in this regard, please contact Brother Tony. And uh as well there's a testimony that I missed here. Last uh service we had prayer for sister brother Ron Spencer's wife who was going in for immediate surgery to remove a fast growing tumor. Uh the surgery was a complete success and the tumor was benign. So we're thankful for answered prayer. Amen. Um, and as well we want to remind everyone that received an invitation to Brother Martin Walman and Sister Diana Ivanenko's wedding, you must RSVP. Uh, that means respond. For those of you from the States who don't know what that means, it's French. Um, or we will assume you're not coming. So, please respond by next Saturday. An email address and phone number can be found on the sheet with a map that was provided in the invitation. It's very important that you reply as soon as possible as the food is being catered. There will be a signup sheet coming to the bulletin board soon. So, keep your eyes posted. Amen. I think I covered everything. But I want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. We're happy to have you here this morning. I think I saw Sister Debbie Grant out in the foyer this morning and didn't get a chance to say hi to her. There you are, Sister Debbie. God bless you. And any others that are visiting, we want to make sure that you know you're real welcome. Let's sing together. Take up your cross and follow Jesus. Take up your cross and follow him. Take up your cross and follow Jesus. Take up your crown and say [Music] it again. Nobody was watching me. Just before we sing it again, uh we've got um I hope everybody's at a Sunday school by now. Uh Sister Lesnanne has got a group of girls that sang at the watch night. They're going to come at this time. So, let's sing it again. Take up your cross and follow Jesus. Take up your cross every day. Don't be s you got to count your cross and take up your cross and follow him. Sing again. You got to take up the cross and follow Jesus. Take up the cross. each and every day. [Music] Don't be ashamed to say that all the cross. [Music] [Music] Jesus said, "There is a manion. that he has prepared for me. [Music] And I'm tired of this open house and longing for my new body. And deep within I can hear his voice be cutting me to that place. I see end time signs all around. And I know soon I'll see his sweet face. Your savior follow you to a land where I'll never grow. So don't give up. Don't give in. But in a little while we'll be going home. [Music] Now through his word I am seeing that before the world began. I was chosen to be his bride. I was always a part of his land. And even though this world is dying, I will never be araid to the sky. [Music] The time is Can you hear Can you hear a call to I'll never go. Don't give in. We'll be going home. We'll be going home far. Little things you must keep pressing on. We'll be home in just a little while. The time is near. The time is near. &gt;&gt; Can you hear? Can you be your savior to the lamb to a lamb ever [Music] going home will be Going home forever. We'll be going home. We'll be going home. [Music] We'll be coming home. [Music] Thanks, sisters. You got a longing to go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. You homesick. &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning to the word at this time as brother Biscll comes. Let's be praying. Amen. &gt;&gt; God would bless our pastor this morning and us through the word that he brings. Uh, we place you in the highest place. Amen. Let's sing it together. We place you in the highest place [Music] for you on the great high. We place you Lord high above. Oh, [Music] forever and we come to you and worship at your feet. Let's stand and sing it again. We place you in the highest Lord for you alone. You alone are the great high priest. Lord, we praise you high above. [Music] you and we come to you and praise and glory and we praise you for the highest Lord for you. You alone are the great high priest. We bless your name, Lord. We praise you, Lord. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] Let's just sing it once again. We praise you in the highest. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. for you. I was great. I breathe. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We praise you. I want [Music] [Applause] [Music] all [Music] and we come to you and worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We come to worship at his feet. That's what we're here for today. Are you ready to worship at his feet? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we want to enjoy the service this morning with no service this evening. I know a lot of people could make it, a lot of people can't. Uh the roads south of the border are very slippery. We talked to some had been stuck in snow drifts and some hadn't even been out of their house as of yesterday and uh then at the evening of course it's dark and we just don't want people to risk and then it brings up another point. We are we've maxed out on our internet connections. As of last Sunday, there was 113 locations that were connected on the internet and we only actually have facility for 100 live. Some can go on the archiving over that to get other services and then if we have a difficult weather at all and then people say well I'll just stream that means that somebody in Switzerland somebody in New Zealand somebody in Belgium somebody in Germany somebody in Norway somebody in Africa is not able to. So, we're looking into trying to expand that so we can get some more, get another 50 or another hundred locations. And those are all costs which are we have to bear every month. So, we want you to remember that as well if you would. Uh, I know brother Rod made the announcement about brother Alons and his good wife, Sister Odette. He's wanting badly to leave his family, have his family remain here while he continues to uh deal with his businesses, but he felt led to open a television station in Muja. And I asked if I could mention that this morning. He said it would be fine. It's going to be the most powerful station uh in a region that covers a captive audience of 7 million people. And that station is opening next month in about another three four weeks time. It's all finished. It's all settled. It's the latest technology uh complete digital system and that will be next month. Uh the one thing that I am certain of I'm certain that it is going to give the message uh uh much more coverage uh and uh an opportunity to get into the homes of a lot of other people. So we don't know just what God has in mind but even if we reach a few or one it's worth it all. Amen. So we remember our brother Alons and their uh their desire to have the family be here and we do pray that that will happen. I want to continue on with the service uh from last Sunday and I need to have you just pray that God will give us a real spirit of revelation understanding. Uh there are some things I want to I want to take the ministry that you've been called under this uh end time message ministry and try to give a broad overview. And that's where we really need to have uh retentive minds, focused minds. Don't let yourself be distracted because if you lose a thought or lose a sentence, you might not catch up for a little while. It'd be hard enough just to try to stay focused. So, we want to pray and ask God to uh to help us. You can uh open your Bibles and uh to second Corinthians and we'll just remain if you don't mind. I'll have the musicians to remain for a moment. 2 Corinthians 4 and 18. We're going to read while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Let's read it together. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. May God be blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We place him in the highest place. &gt;&gt; God dwells in a place. &gt;&gt; He dwells in a special place. He has a place and we want to be in contact with that place today. So let's in our hearts place him in the highest place. Would you sing it once again? We place you in the highest place. For you are the great high. We bless you. [Music] Oh, and we come to you and worship You may have your seats. Keep your Bibles, please, ready to be open as I'll be reading some more scriptures in just a few moments. in the book, a man sent from God. Uh they were quoting one of the men. I didn't bother to go back and see who it was they were quoting. But this uh author or whoever the author was quoting said of brother Brham, when the gift is operating, brother Brandham is the most sensitive person to the presence and uh to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit and to spiritual realities of any person I have ever known. known under the anointing which operates his spiritual gifts. And when he is in when he is conscious of the angel's presence, he seems to break through the veil of the flesh into the world of spirit to be struck through and through with a sense of the unseen. And Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 4:18, "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." Paul's words here indicate that we are now living in two worlds at the same time. The world of sense and the world of spirit. The world of spirit surrounds and spheres and in in interpenetrates the world of sense. Both worlds occupy the same space at the same time. The material realities which we see with our natural eye exist in the midst of the far better realities which are unseen by the optic nerve. The scriptures teach us that the superior eternal realities compass us. Now what sites might every one of us see if every moment of our existence at every turn of our path had we anointed eyes with which to see them? The seen exists in the midst of the unseen and the temporal in the midst of the eternal. I want to read out of second Peter the 3 chapter in the fifth verse. It's not working. Is this mic working? I'll just use this microphone here. out of second Peter 3 uh chapter. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was brother Bram says the antelvian world being overflowed with water perished but the heaven and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under fire against the day judgment and predition of ungodly men. But beloved, be be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to usward, and not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved. What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, any element shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Also, uh if you'd like to just turn to Acts the 17th chapter, want to read two verses there. Sometimes God uses these things and sometimes the devil tries to use them. And I'm just I just want to be absolutely certain here that God has his way today. Now Paul because he understand there was no New Testament when he spoke now here in Acts there's no New Testament. So his understanding there's two things coming together here. His understanding is that of the Old Testament which that was his that was his knowledge of the world as being the heavens and the earth. That was his knowledge of it. But now what is coming together in the apostle Paul is that he is chosen to be the first church age messenger. So he is also what's merging with that is that anointing or that inspiration that is given to him so that he can introduce it to those Gentiles that are now to receive the gospel. And so he says in Acts 17 and 23 he's on Mars Hill in Athens and to the Athenians. So he's saying, "For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him, de uh excuse me, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him, declare I unto you. For God, God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Now, this was something that the Jews understood and this was something that now the Greeks could understand that God made the world and everything that's in it. And that encompasses the understanding in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now when we when we uh hear that well we think well the heavens and the earth uh but not only that Paul is saying didn't only make the heavens and the earth but he made everything that's in it as well. All things that are and and that encompassed the whole the whole uh thought. Now last week just breaking into the subject I was introducing there are I won't say two worlds but we live in two worlds and there's actually more uh spheres or dimensions that we could talk about but the two worlds is the one that God made and the one that we live in that we understand not as a a world as such but it's a cosmos which is the arrangement of things that are presently in the world that we are connected to. But the born again believer actually uh has a plurality or lives in a dual realm because he lives in both of those. So that's really another aspect. So we have the unbeliever, they just live in this world. We have God and the presence of God which is in another realm. That's another world. And we as a as born again believers, we're in contact with both of those. Now, uh the first world, I want to just go slowly. the first world when the scripture says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The the Hebrews have a have a word for heavens. Samim which is heavens and arises which is earth. And these two amount to the the technical term for the entire created order. And so that's how they understood it. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. I'm just I'm I'm just abbreviating now some of the scriptures. And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly." And they did. Every moving creature, every creature that had life foul, and so on. And then God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly. And then on Genesis 21:24, and God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, creeping thing, etc., etc." And it did is all part of the world that uh apostle Paul was talking about. He created all things. And then in Genesis 1:27, so God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth, subdue it, have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." And God said, "Behold, I've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth, and every tree in the field in the every tree in the which is the spirit or the I'm sorry, the fruit of the tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for meat, and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life. I've given every green herb for meat. And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made. And behold, it was very good. That's the world that God made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I said last Sunday, that's the world that God loves. &gt;&gt; That was his own handiwork. He wrought everything by the power of his word. &gt;&gt; And whether it took millions of years or trillions of years, there is no time with God. We have no concept of it because we are creatures of time. Everything begins and everything ends. And our breath is just a vapor. Just a vapor. There is a God. He is eternal. No beginning, no end. We can't understand that. There's nothing in our language that helps us to grasp it. We just have to believe it that somehow there's a being uh almighty divine uh uh being has no beginning and no end. And with the power of his own word, he has structured these things. He divinely ordered them. And not only did he create them, but there's an order to it. He has a certain order to it. And that's what I want you to see. And it was finished. And he and it was very good. And then it says, "And thus the heavens and the earth were finished. and all the host of them. Adam and Eve, they enjoyed a or possessed a capacity for fellowship that none of us have ever really tasted because it was untainted. &gt;&gt; There was no They had never had an evil thought. &gt;&gt; They had never had an evil thought. There hadn't even been a uh there wasn't a even a shadow of anything of that nature. And in that from that place they were able to have fellowship with God. It is so marvelous. I just sense such a presence you know with us today as I speak about these things because that's the Eden we're going back to. &gt;&gt; There won't be a trace. You won't remember this life. &gt;&gt; You won't remember. &gt;&gt; There will be no remembrance of the evil things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a rejoicing. &gt;&gt; And it might raise questions. Well, what about this or what about that or what about this person? What? It's it's far beyond that. It's so far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that realm, I believe he likened it. He said it would be like a pig trying to imagine what our life is like. &gt;&gt; There just no possible way to grasp it. So they lived in a realm or a dimension which they could commune with God directly and they were a they were acquainted with the unseen world because the scripture also says no man hath seen God at any time. They did not see God but they heard his voice walking in the garden. So it is something that we have not we we can't even anticipate we can't understand we can't grasp that but they they in the cool of the evening the communion was was absolutely unde undefiled and undiluted. It was just a perfect communion that they had and they heard his voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day. But while they lived in this state, they had no concept of the nether world. They had no concept of the grave. &gt;&gt; They had no concept of the end of life. &gt;&gt; They had no concept of it. So that world they knew nothing about. &gt;&gt; It's one we're very acquainted with. We just had a service the other day and laid one of our brothers away. We're very conscious of it. But they became aware of it when they looked into the face of their slain son &gt;&gt; and now for the first time were tasting of the knowledge of evil. &gt;&gt; It was already bearing fruit. And now they looked into the face of their slain son and could for the first time say, "Where is he?" &gt;&gt; He's not here. Where is he? Where did he go? &gt;&gt; And I'm sure those questions flooded their minds. Where did he go? Does he come back? That was a totally new thing to them. But I want to just take a step back to this perfect perfect world that God had made with his children in harmony and fellowship with him. I want to establish this because it's going to be important in the rest of the service. That was the paradigm or the model, the example world against which all of history and everything that should follow will be evaluated against. &gt;&gt; That was the example. That was the model. paradigm can I suppose maybe mean a little different things to different people but I want to use it as a as the model the example the pattern against which all that shall follow will be evaluated against that world that example world it was the one God said when it was finished he looked on it The whole order said this is very good. God, &gt;&gt; God, holy, righteous, just, perfect God saying this is very good. &gt;&gt; I want say our poor minds trying to grasp it. The only thing we could say with our mouth, father, if you said it's very good, then I say it's very good also. So this divine arrangement culminated with God and his children in fellowship. And now we have a collision. We have a colliding of another world. And I'm not going to go into a lot. I described it last week in quite some detail. But this world, please now this world of evil, this world of iniquity, this world was highly organized, this world that knew its creatures knew lots about worship. They were around the throne and its leader Lucifer. He knew all. He even knew the mind of God. He was speaking uh he was speaking to Eve concerning the thought of God and and what the program was and he added one word. Thou shalt not not surely die. Now I just want to say something to you said release your mind and your thoughts. I want you to think. I've been thinking very, very deep. And if I say some things that kind of reach out, you just attribute it to how God is dealing with me. If Satan, if Lucifer, a fallen angel, could inspire or use the instrumentality of a beast called a serpent and cause him with one word, with one word to bring everything that you see on the face of the earth today. Then I want to ask you, is it unreasonable that we should believe that God can take a man in his own hand and through his mouth utter creative power? &gt;&gt; If Satan can take a beast, &gt;&gt; you better believe that God can take a man. If God chooses and says, "You're going to be a prophet. You're going to utter my word. You're going to declare my very breath. You're going to breathe it into the people out of your mouth. Then I say, if God can use if Satan can use a serpent, God can use a man. God can use Moses, God can use Elijah, God can use Samuel, and God can use William Brham." &gt;&gt; And everybody in their season at their appropriate time. &gt;&gt; So this leader, this lover of beauty, this slicker, this wise one, this one of reason polished as brother Brandham said, he introduced another order, a different arrangement, a different program with himself as its head. Lucifer, this proud prince, the slicker with his hordes of demons and his kingdom of darkness following collided with this perfect heavens and earth and brought what we have today. this subtle instrument, the serpent. I just repeat from last week. Sin and unbelief which started out appealing, intriguing, enchanting, tantalizing, you know, to the eyes, to the senses. And then once it was touched, once it was yielded to, it became burdensome. It became crushing. It became sorrowful. That's when tears, that's when pain, that's when enslavery was introduced. It all looks good. And sin's the same today. &gt;&gt; It looks appealing. It just looks, oh, if I just touch it, if I just have a taste of it, and so on so forth. I tell you what, there's sorrow attached with it. &gt;&gt; There's chains attached with it. There's bondage attached with it. &gt;&gt; You'll get to a place you can't get out of, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we have plenty of it today. That's the world that Satan introduced. It's a world of pleasures. As Paul said in Timothy, it's a world of cares, as Jesus said. And I noticed, he said that the seed was choked out with cares and the riches and the pleasures of life. And of course, that makes that makes just perfect sense because this b this world and this time that we're in is a age of great cares and burdensome. It's a burdensome time. And it's no wonder that people seek pleasure to drown out their burdens and their cares and to lessen them. God made foolish the wisdom of this world. Paul said, "And Jesus said that there would be signs in the heaven, in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity." Mentioned that to you. Perplexity is without the resources. It is perplexity is doubt. What do I do now? And it is a state in which people are left wanting. They don't know which way to turn. And then brother Brandham concludes I concluded with him great burden of this last age is the pressures of riches and soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in. Don't know about you, but I feel unfitted to live in this generation. It doesn't fit me, &gt;&gt; and I don't think it fits you in the end time. Brother Brandham said, in invisible union, the complete total insanity this world will go into right away. Now notice the connotation of prophetic here. We'll go into right away. It's almost there now. Why? You can see the footprints of it. So he was watching the trajectory of the way things were going. This is 1965. He says there it is marching right out on the street right down the church pew. Total insanity. do things that a human being wouldn't think of of doing and being civilized. Look what Hollywood's done to the woman. Look how it has robbed the sacred virtues of the woman. On and on we could go. See all this uh see all this she lost. How did she do it? Because there was a subtle instrument called the church. &gt;&gt; That's not a subtle instrument called the serpent. now is a subtle instrument called the church &gt;&gt; like there was in the Garden of Eden. A subtle person, the devil, walked into the church just like he did into the garden. Isn't that incredible? He walked into the church just like he walked into the garden and deceived her into it. She's deceived and the woman thinks he said she don't mean to be wrong. Eve didn't mean to do wrong. It wasn't willfully. He said the Bible said in in 2 Timothy 1 Timothy 3, she was deceived. And deceived is not when you willingly do it. It's when you are deceived into it. now. And so now we have this introduction of the world that we presently know. There has been some intervals when God has called the world into account. He's called certain ages into account and measured them against the paradigm of the beginning. one of those times. And I'll just say on the stage, enter Babylon. I want to introduce Babylon. This majestic city, magnificent beyond what we architecturally today understand. It stands for the city of man as opposed to Jerusalem. That's the city of God. Babylon is associated with the tower of Babel meaning confusion as opposed to Jerusalem which is the city of peace. And in the Latin Jerusalem was interpreted as vision of peace. Jerusalem the city of peace as opposed to Babel. that confusion, the city of confusion, Babylon serves as a reference point in the Middle Ages. That's why I'm referring to it because it's in Genesis. It has its roots in Genesis. It's there in the Middle Ages and it appears at the end of the Bible in Revelation. It appears it's with us. Babylon marks the beginnings and the endings. For when they when Nebuchadnezzar had his dream and only Daniel the prophet could interpret the dream, he said, "You are the head of gold." That was the beginning. That was the highest that he would get. And it would go on down. it would progress or degress I should say through other three more kingdoms and would finally end up as iron and clay in the toes. Now you might say well how does this relate? It will you just hold on for a few moments. At the end of time is where spiritual Babylon we find spiritual Babylon is present in the end time and antichrist which is anti-word is there that is his seat. Now in the message of mark of the beast, brother Brandham says how Babylon appeared in Genesis and then the middle of the Bible and the last of the Bible in Israel at Kadesh Barnea. He said they start in Genesis winding up here in the last day and then he says how that formal religion begin with Cain and how it came in on out down through the sons of Noah Ham. Out of Ham he had Nimrod and Nimrod built the tower of Babel. Babel comes on down through King Nebuchadnezzar's time and on out into Revelations. Babylon, how that little seed started way back there in the east side of the gates of Eden, coming on down, winding out. All kinds of cults and everything started back there, winding themselves out to the end. He said, "Now it behooves us to watch." See, this isn't some history he's talking about, but this is something that is connected with us right now in our time. He said, "Be careful. It behooves us to watch. Be careful. Be set in the word. Many things are taking place today which are unscriptural. And let's watch the scripture and be sure that we're we're we're right. Just hold it very close. Daniel said, "Thou, oh king, are the king of kings." This to Nebuchadnezzar. For the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven, hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. I tell you, he was given a prestigious position &gt;&gt; by God. And in the days of these kings on down, he's interpreting because he saw a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. And in the days of these kings, these other kings, shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. I would say that if one foul word introduced from Lucifer through the instrument of a beast which is lower than us in Eden could bring influence upon all these nations of the world. the seed of that back there rippling all out through man's history bringing this catastrophic absolutely degradable and degenerate condition of the world today if that could happen by Lucifer through one being lower than ourselves what can God do through a one man in the hand of God to the nations which you may not see the effect of the word you can't see the effect of that word Not &gt;&gt; you only see the circumstances but we we're not conscious of the fact we say well every but the prophet saw it he said every hospital bed &gt;&gt; every prison &gt;&gt; every prison cell &gt;&gt; was hinging on that one word &gt;&gt; every graveyard &gt;&gt; all the flowers you see every graveyard &gt;&gt; is hinging on that one word I say If that if that be so, God can take one word out of a prophet's mouth and swing the world upside down. &gt;&gt; You might not know the process, &gt;&gt; but you have to know who's speaking &gt;&gt; cuz that's exactly what's happening. &gt;&gt; And it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that break in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. King Belshazzer. The Bible says it's his son. There's some dispute about that. They thought it might be his grandfather, which is irrelevant to us. But King Belshazzer followed him. You should see the grandeur. I've looked at a few drawings, but the grandeur and the the marvels of Babylon, which I won't get into, but Belshazzer, he just got completely carried away with the glory and the power because they were the superpower. &gt;&gt; They at that time of the Middle Ages controlled the world. And that's why God is calling him into account. And the only way he can call him into account is he gives him a dream that uh Nebuchadnezzar that he can't understand. And God has a prophet on hand who can interpret the dream and tell him every detail of it. And that prophet is there while another king comes into into power, Belshazzer. And he made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand. and Belshazzer, whilst he tasted the wine, communed, uh, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem, and the king and his his princes and his wives and his concubines that they might drink therein. And then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God, which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his princes, his wives, and his concubines drank in them. They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver and of brass and of iron and of wood and of stone and all the material things that we have today. They're glorifying the automobile industry, glorifying the fashion industry, glorifying all the universities and all the places and institutions of education and higher education and higher education and on and on and on. They're glorifying and consumed with the works of their hands and the things they had built and the cities they had built and all the wisdom that they had. And they were glorifying them. And they took vessels &gt;&gt; that have been dedicated to God &gt;&gt; and began to drink them and use them. And the king of Babylon drunk on his power, blinded by his glory, blinded by his iniquity and the blasphemy &gt;&gt; of his actions and drinking as he was in this drunken banquet. And God decides to call him into account, &gt;&gt; this great power. call him into account and evaluate him with the paradigm of the beginning. And he was weighed in the balances. And remember, if you're weighed in the balances, there has to be there has to be an absolute. &gt;&gt; And there was an absolute. And it was a paradigm of the beginning. And the prophet spoke and said, "You have been weighed and you are wanting." &gt;&gt; That was Babylon then. &gt;&gt; And Babylon got weighed out again, &gt;&gt; today &gt;&gt; and a prophet again, &gt;&gt; weighed them out, &gt;&gt; confusion of the ages, sir. &gt;&gt; And call the denominational world into account. And he said, "You're Hollywood. &gt;&gt; You got Hollywood evangelism. &gt;&gt; You're Hollywood. You've been weighed and you're found wanting." And he preached handwriting on the wall again. in the mark of the beast. Once again, brother Brandon says it begin Babylon begin in Genesis and ends up in Revelation. It brought in idolatry, idols, worship of idols. He said it came right on down through and it's so cunning in the last days till it takes on the name of Christianity here. Now the prophet is pulling the covers back. &gt;&gt; Now we might say well brother Brand's not the first one to identify that though that's true but the first one with the kind of vindication he had. That happens to be a very big thing. I want you to know right the offset that's a very big subject with me is a vindication. &gt;&gt; Fact is, I might as well say it right now. There has been nothing in recorded history that I know of or that anyone else has told me about or that any research has uncovered since the beginning of the world &gt;&gt; to this time &gt;&gt; that God raised up a man &gt;&gt; with that kind, &gt;&gt; not a gift, that kind of voice that was coming out. If there is, it's incumbent upon you to tell me who it is. &gt;&gt; It's never been. Why? Because it had to be for the last one. &gt;&gt; This had to be for the last one. Because God is going to call the world to judgment against the paradigm &gt;&gt; of the perfect creation. He said the city of Babylon was the greatest city of the known world. The word Babylon first means it was the gate of paradise. Secondly, it was called the gate. It was called confusion which means backslid and the city he said was a great place and all nations around it paid tribute to it. All of them were taxed by Babylon and it became a great wicked and indifferent city. God attested to its glory. Babylonian then meet a Persian Greece and the Romans. Oh, now it is when that fourth generation, the last one, the Roman power. Now, they had and I had it on a I could have showed you on a map. It's impressive the Roman Empire, their domain. Oh, how they built roads and how they had a parliamentary system and how genius they were and the control and the way they governed and so on so forth. I've read quite a bit about it. It was not recently, but it's very interesting how the Romans ruled and it's still admired today, their form of government and the way that they had things. And now when they were at the peak and the apex of their power and now they had the world, the world. That is when God decided there needed to be a collision, a colliding &gt;&gt; of another world. &gt;&gt; This world under the sentence of death, there must come life &gt;&gt; and a different kind of life. &gt;&gt; And this is where I ended last Sunday. And that is why God created a life unlike any other life. that was a a god seed &gt;&gt; in the womb of a virgin &gt;&gt; and he's going to turn the world upside down with one man &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ. Won't you think about it? I know there was a great roar of amen last week. He said, "Behold, I make all things new. I make a new heaven and a new earth." Brother Brandham says that that body of Jesus, born of a woman, of Mary, that body was formed in her womb of the nutrients which she received of the earth. She ate, he received nutrition, and that body was formed. and he had a body that aged. &gt;&gt; When he was 30, he looked 50 &gt;&gt; because he was under the weight of the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; And when he got hot, he prosperspired. And when he got tired, he had to sleep. And when he was thirsty, he needed a drink by the well. &gt;&gt; He was a man. &gt;&gt; And when he stood at Lazarus's grave, he wept for the hardness of their heart. And brother Brandham said of all the human emotions, he he he cried. He had tears. That was the human emotion he he showed most. &gt;&gt; He wept. But now that body is taken to the cross, is slain. He takes his last breath, speaks his last words, and gives up the ghost. He said, "No man takes my life from me. I lay it down myself. I will take it up again. and is in the tomb. And on the morning of the first day of the week, the disciples, Mary comes to the tomb, finds that the stone is rolled away, looks in, and the body is not there. &gt;&gt; That body &gt;&gt; now that body will never be the same. It is the same Christ, but it's not the same body that came out of the womb of the woman. &gt;&gt; It is a new earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the collision with a cursed earth &gt;&gt; and he dropped the blood from that body that was on the cross. He dropped the blood onto the blood of the blood of God &gt;&gt; onto the ground of the earth that you're walking on today claiming it as my own. &gt;&gt; But he doesn't want it in its present state. He's going to purge it. He's going to purify it. He marked it with the blood of God. He claimed it back as a redeemer. I'm redeeming it. I'm buying it back with the very blood of God. And when he raised up from the grave, he referred to his body. They said it's a spirit. He said a spirit hath not flesh and bones, but he didn't say blood. What kind of body that is, I know not. &gt;&gt; But it is a new body. &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of body. &gt;&gt; And this scripture which we have says that he will give us a body like unto his glorious body. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. It's a glorious body. It's a glorious body. He took a body and the scripture says of our humility, of our defilement. He took a body like us. He who knew no sin was made sin for us that he could condemn sin and death in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And there was a an incredible an incredible cosmic class collision and Christ Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How you came out of the grave. &gt;&gt; He descended. While he was there, he descended to the lower regions. He went to a lower world so that you wouldn't have to go there. &gt;&gt; He went to the nether world. He went to the underworld. He went to hell itself so that you wouldn't have to go to hell. &gt;&gt; I love the way the prophet puts it. He said, you know, Eve said, "Who is it?" He said, "It's the seed of the woman." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham said, "Who is it?" He I'm the promised son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joseph said, "Who is it?" I'm the son uh of prosperity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daniel said, "Who is it?" I'm the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rising. And he went and rattled the cage of Satan himself, &gt;&gt; his arc enemy that he cast out of heaven, &gt;&gt; said, "I come to get you. &gt;&gt; I come to destroy you. &gt;&gt; I come to strip you." &gt;&gt; And he took the keys of death, hell, and the grave and ripped them off of him and ascended victorious. &gt;&gt; That's a new world coming into existence. Brother Brandon said, "The earth will burst forth with volcanics." I tell you, that was a volcanic that was equal to any volcanic explosion when Christ burst out of the earth. &gt;&gt; Here I am, &gt;&gt; alive again. &gt;&gt; And behold, I live. &gt;&gt; And he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die. I'm alive. And because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; That's a new world. &gt;&gt; That's a new world. &gt;&gt; It's not just some words of history. It's a world that was introduced back there. &gt;&gt; Let me drop this in. When you were born, were you in the world? Of course. Did you know anything about you girls that were born? I got a little baby girl. Were you in the world? Yeah. You didn't know much about it. gradually over a period of time. And through the processes of growing, through the processes of developing, through the processes of learning, you learned how to do things. You learned maybe how to cook. You learned the responsibilities. And what were you doing? You were learning about this world. And you began to discover too that things aren't very permanent. They're not very stable. &gt;&gt; And you soon begin to taste of its of some of its trouble. You begin to taste at a young age of some of its pressure. You begin to you begin to experience some of its its hardship. You experience some of its joy and happiness and frivolity and and fun and all the rest of it. And the men as you begin to grow, you found out I got I've got to I've got to learn something. I've got to learn how to do something. I've got to work for a living. I got to That was this world. &gt;&gt; Well, the world that Jesus introduced, that's what we're doing right now. &gt;&gt; We're developing and we're learning something about that world because and you want to get all you can of it right now because that's the world you're going to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You plan to go there. Is that your destiny? &gt;&gt; They introduced &gt;&gt; another world. They began to bring it into being. Whereas in Eden with the first Adam, God created all the lower forms of life and it evolved, evolved, evolved and he capped it off with his son. And that one fell through the son's wife. This one, he starts with his son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Completely the opposite. He starts with his son and then he begins to populate it. &gt;&gt; You see, he he started with all the lower creation. Then he came and ended it with his son and then gave his son a bride and then they began to populate afterwards. Now it's different. &gt;&gt; They begin to populate after she had already been polluted, &gt;&gt; after she had already carried a false seed. &gt;&gt; But God said, "I'm going to reverse it. I'm going to start with the perfect now. I'm going to start with the son who's already overcome the devil." &gt;&gt; And the devil did approach him. The devil did try to get him to worship. The devil did try to get to interpret the word to him, but he had no capacity. There was no place found in him for this foul one. And he defeated him on earth and he defeated him in hell. He defeated him in heaven. He defeated him in every in every dimension. Can you say amen? Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He defeated him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now the son comes first and then first he creates his bride. &gt;&gt; You might think you just heard the message. You might think, well, yeah, brother Brian was a prophet. Yeah, yeah, I believe that all the rest of it. Let me tell you something. If you haven't already thought of it, it was the word of God, thus sayeth the Lord, which wasn't brother Brandham's words &gt;&gt; coming through that mouth &gt;&gt; that actually created &gt;&gt; a virgin bride. &gt;&gt; And the power of that word annihilated your sin &gt;&gt; and you repented. It takes repentance. Without the shed blood, there's no remission of sins. It took all of that. It took the cross. &gt;&gt; It took Christ. But remember, Jesus is the word. Jesus is the word outside. You can't have Jesus over here and the word over here. They are one and the same. And when the word comes forth, that's Jesus coming forth. &gt;&gt; This business about talking I love Jesus and denying what's in here. It's not the Jesus of this Bible. Jesus is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so now he creates a virgin bride. It's not just a people rising up and say, "Well, you know, I'm an elect and I'm a bride and I'm the elect lady and all the rest of it." It's not what you say it is. It's what you believe. Hallelujah. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. He was the one who said he was the I am. &gt;&gt; I'm Abraham's shield. I am thy shield. He was Ruth kinsman's. I am thy near kinsman in Isaiah. I am he that blotth away thy out thy transgressions in John. I am the bread of life. I am the light of the world. I am the door of the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I am come that they might have life. I am the resurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the true vine. I am from above. &gt;&gt; Said you are of this world. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me he didn't know who he was. &gt;&gt; He was a great I am. and he still is. &gt;&gt; I'm the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the ending. And finally, I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I'm alive forever more. Amen. And I have the and I have the keys of death, hell, and the grave. was like a volcanic eruption. It would be nice if we could see for just a moment all the powers of hell. All the angels that fell following their leader. All of those great angels that could only be cast out with fasting and prayer. The Bible says, "And all the other demon powers, the demons of cancer and of disease and sickness, the demons of lust and the demons of uncleanness and the demons of perversion and all those demons when that eruption took place, they trembled in their shoes. Who's this is coming forth? Who's this?" I said Ezra spoke of pillars of smoke and who is this that's coming. He made hell tremble. &gt;&gt; I tell you there was an eruption in the other world unlike anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It never will happen again like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the one and only time in all of the span of eternity that anything like that's going to happen. I say glory be to God in the highest. Victorious is our Christ. &gt;&gt; Up from the grave he arose, &gt;&gt; triumphant over his foes. &gt;&gt; And to think that this little body of flesh that sits here today or stands here has the privilege to open its mouth and take in God's free air and use his use the energy that he's given with the muscles and body that he's given us that we could praise his name. Well, what a pleasure it is for us. What a privilege it is for us. And what an insult if we won't do it. &gt;&gt; God, you did all that, but I refuse to open my mouth. I refuse to praise you. I say God gave you life &gt;&gt; and the purpose of your life is to glory to him. the foundation stone and the headstone of the new creation begins cleansing the earth of evil. So he says to disciples, "Go preach this gospel. &gt;&gt; Cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Freely you've received, freely give. &gt;&gt; Displace him. move him out of here. &gt;&gt; Lay hands on the sick and they'll recover. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was already done. &gt;&gt; It's not God doesn't have to come down and heal you. God has healed you. He said God can't heal you. God has already healed every person. He said that God has healed every person. &gt;&gt; God has healed every person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Marge Miller, I prayed for you this morning that God would take this message and just uh uh penetrate your soul with it. &gt;&gt; God has healed you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This isn't some merely excitement, friends. This is the truth of this word of God. And God has announced these kind of things to us so we can take it. So we can believe it. So we can uh harbor it in our hearts and love it and embrace it, cherish it. &gt;&gt; This Christ, &gt;&gt; the headstone, the foundation stone, begins cleansing the earth of evil and brings forth to bring forth a perfect dwelling place. When the earth goes through the process that you and I go through by repentance, the water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the cleansing fire of God, he said the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that cleansing of the fire of God will take the want out of you. &gt;&gt; There's a a A woman that's not properly dressed walks by says there still is. It'll take the want out of you. &gt;&gt; Doesn't take the temptation, but takes the want out of you. &gt;&gt; Man has been a drunkard. He gets a whiff of that drink and and and there's the want there. The Holy Spirit will burn the want out of you. &gt;&gt; You'll still smell it. You might have the temptation, but you won't want it anymore. The want goes out of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Rejoice, saints of God. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God has come into you and taken the want out of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're free. whom the Son sets free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; Calvary made you free. &gt;&gt; And the resurrection proved it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Any man can say something, but when he rose from the dead, he proved who he was." And in this generation, he proved who he was. He proved who he was. He proved there wasn't uh a Kuckian with seventh grade education. It was God in the man. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Continuing his creation. &gt;&gt; Continuing the process &gt;&gt; of his creation and populating it. &gt;&gt; And the earth is going to be made ready. The earth has to have a holy fire &gt;&gt; to burn the heavens. &gt;&gt; And all the demon power and evil power and spirits, they're going to be annihilated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That demon who's haunted you, he's going to be annihilated. &gt;&gt; Rejoice over him today. Hallelujah. Don't let him hound you. Don't let him be in your tracks. Don't let him be on your case. You defeat him. He's already destroyed. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a key on him left. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I say in this day we come to another not an interval in time but we came to the consummation of the ages. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about the consummation of the ages. Speaks about the conditions that will exist in the consummation of the ages. And it speaks of the ministry that will come in the consummation of the ages. Behold, before that great and terrible, terrible day of the Lord, the judgment day, I'll send you Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; Back to the word. &gt;&gt; Some preachers in the message use that, but they're talking about their understanding of the word. I'm not talking about their understanding. I'm talking about what Elijah said about the word. &gt;&gt; And that's the only world word that'll produce the world that God's going to dwell in. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Now listen closely in the message. Notice the titles of the message. at thy word. In other words, he said, a vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time. This is what uh one of the Bible encyclopedias says concerning vision. I think it's worthwhile. Psychologists find that man is prevailingly and persistently eyeminded. That is in his walking life he is likely to think, imagine and remember in terms of his vision. Naturally then his dreaming is predominantly visual. So strongly visual, we are told that it is not rare to find dreams defined as trains of fantastic images. Whether man was made this way in order that God might commune with him through dreams and visions is hardly worth debating. If the records of the human life in the Bible and out of it are to be trusted at all, there is nothing better certified than that God has communicated with man in this way. God communicating with man said that is the most certified. It's not even debatable. There isn't even a negative to it. God communicates with man by vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you have a prophet that has visions. &gt;&gt; 10, 100, a thousand, innumerable. vision. &gt;&gt; Living by vision. &gt;&gt; Speaking to people by vision. Making decisions by vising vision of the governments and the world affairs. Seeing visions of communism and of America and of Hollywood and all. Seeing by vision, speaking by vision. You have,00 messages. I tell you, many of them are by direct vision &gt;&gt; because that's how God chose to communicate with man. &gt;&gt; When a vision comes to you, a vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time. You're in this world here now and you're in another world and you're speaking over there knowing that your voice is heard back here. Place yourself there once and just see what it'll do for you. The revealing of Christ himself in the opening of the seals. the time of the marriage of the lamb with his bride. This is the time. It had to come in this time. There had to come a time in the consummation of the ages for the seals to be open. That which was sealed up which Daniel couldn't write. That's what John couldn't write. It had to be spoken. &gt;&gt; It was the time of the marriage of the lamb &gt;&gt; and his bride. &gt;&gt; Where is this bride? Check it out. &gt;&gt; And someone might say, well, you know, you really want to take that kind of a position. Say, I am the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm an elector of God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; On what authority? On the authority that God sent a vindicated prophet and spoke it. And I believe what was said and that because I believe what was said, I believe I'm in what he said I'd be in. &gt;&gt; This stone, &gt;&gt; remember now, it did not hit the head of gold &gt;&gt; or the breast of &gt;&gt; of silver &gt;&gt; or the midsection of brass and neither the legs of iron. But at the end time, at the consummation of the ages, when Rome will be mixing with all the nations of the world, when it will become the soul, the sole world power, you can say, "Well, America is a superpower." I tell you, Rome has more power than America. &gt;&gt; It holds the souls of men &gt;&gt; at their disposal. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm getting through to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't don't fear those shiny missiles. Rome is more powerful than those shiny missiles &gt;&gt; in the in the silos. &gt;&gt; What is this world?" I pondered for days since the last service. What do we see? What do we discover from this world that brother Brandham said I'm in two worlds where he said we're in two worlds. I found out it was a world of absolute knowledge. A world of absolute knowledge. Listen very close. We read accounts of him speaking with people who was in front of him and so on and so forth. But the startling thing, it never aired. Never aired. &gt;&gt; There's not an account &gt;&gt; by any minister, &gt;&gt; by any writing, by his enemies. &gt;&gt; There's no account that was ever wrong. What is it? Absolute knowledge. That happens to be a very important point because he said some things about you. He says some things about me. And if it's not from a position of absolute knowledge, I could doubt those. &gt;&gt; If people rose up and said, "Well, he said that." It was no, it didn't make any sense to it at all. &gt;&gt; Like somebody trying to use this gift down in the church in Tennessee and told a woman, "You're this, that, the other thing." It was an imitation, an impersonation. And a woman came to her pastor and said, "He told me I think two or three things and not one of them was correct." So the pastor went to the minister, pastor of another church in this message. Not the message I'm in, &gt;&gt; but what he calls message and said, "You said this, that, and the other thing, and the woman has come to me and said,"None of them are true." All he says is hit and miss. You know, he says, "If you hit it 50% of the time, you're happy. 50% of the time. What kind of confidence? But that's what's out there. That's what's out there. I'm sure you appreciate something of what we have here. At least with a sincerity, a world of absolute knowledge. It was a world of absolute power. He says a man standing in front of him. He says, "Your makeup from a childhood has been strange." Now, tracing this man from his childhood since you've been a boy. It's been strange. That is right. You're desiring a worthy thing. He said sterile. Is that right? Is that true? He says, "Aren't you in the Navy? Aren't you a sailor? I see clothes or a man standing by the side of you just it it's you. You're a sailor." He says just standing there in a moment has gone back when he was a a young boy. So you've been strange since you're a child, but you're here for a worthy cause. You're sterile and you're in the Navy. I see your clothes. Tell you what, friends, that might be fine for that man, but it means infinitely more to me. That tells me that the God who spoke this message saw me way back in my very beginnings saw me tramping through the woods and through the trees. He saw you in your confusion. He saw you in your state. He saw you in your sin. He saw you in your bondage. And God sent a word. One day I'm going to loose him. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna send a creative word. I'm gonna speak it. And oh, I hope they don't miss it. I hope they believe it in that moment. In that moment because Satan already has been defeated. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I wish every person who ever came to this church was here today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Said you're living in two worlds. I'm describing it to him, not repeating myself. In redemption by power. You're in a world here, speaking of his experience, and you're in a world there. These are two worlds. This isn't just two feelings. This isn't just something that he he he was feeling uh I you know emotionally I I feel over here and I feel over here. I wasn't he was in two worlds. &gt;&gt; So it tore him apart &gt;&gt; weakened him. And he says here, he said, "And you're in a world there and be with somebody 50 years ago." He wasn't dreaming a dream. He wasn't seeing a picture on the wall. He was with that person 50 years ago. &gt;&gt; Literally with them. He told me of the man whose eyes had been burned out in in in India that he he he had to come out of the vision and look at the man. He saw the man turning his head and he saw him active. So he knew that he had a sight but he didn't know when it would happen. So he wanted to look at him and and and pulling out of one world into another world. And he in the vision he had graying on his sideburns. And when he kind of shook his head and looked at him, his sideburns were black. There was no gray hair. He said to me, "Then I had to exercise my faith that God would do it at that moment." &gt;&gt; And he was healed by the word of the Lord out of the mouth of a prophet. He was healed. And the place went chaotic. They tried to tear the pants off of Brother Brandham to get pieces of cloth &gt;&gt; from him. when I saw such a miracle. And he had challenged the James and the Muslims and the British doctors and all of those that were there. He said, "If you can give him his sight, come up here and give him his sight." &gt;&gt; He said, "You say that Jesus was a prophet, but Muhammad was God's prophet." He said, "If Muhammad can give him his sight, come and give him his sight. &gt;&gt; If your God can give him his sight, sounds like Elijah on Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; If your God can do it, then come and let him do it." &gt;&gt; And nobody moved. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said to me, "That place was so quiet." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "But if I testify to you that Jesus Christ has risen from the grave, there's an empty tomb back yonder and his sight comes to him, then will you receive him as your savior?" And the man began to scream. His eyes burned out from being a sun worshipper. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a new heaven and a new earth coming into existence. Not some gift &gt;&gt; as a man said when brother Brandham was exercising a gift that that gift came went came came all the time he was dwelling in that place. He said you're 50 years ago and then you may be you may be with somebody years from today to come and let you realize you're standing on the platform here and you're speaking something what happened many many years ago maybe weeks ago months ago another nation another place or something and then you try to keep yourself straight in your thinking It's quite a thing, but the Lord has blessed us so far in it and we're very happy and trust God in conference with God. He says to the man, I'm talking about absolute knowledge. You should listen to it. Conference with God. &gt;&gt; Uh you want to if you want something from me personally, I'm dropping it into you. &gt;&gt; You need to have a much deeper grasp of what that ministry was. Amen. &gt;&gt; He comes up and starts conference with God and he says in his opening comments starts talking about a doctor. How kind they are and with tender hands they try to make life easier for the people and they you know with tender hands they take their patients and he talks so nice about the doctors. Then he preaches an entire service maybe hour and a half on conference with God. Then they call a prayer line. And the first man that comes and stands in front of them says, "You believe it, doctor, don't you?" When did you think he knew he was a doctor? He knew it at the beginning of the service. &gt;&gt; That's absolute knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's why he's talked like that. said, "You believe it, too, don't you, doctor and mother. You're not from here. You're from another place, from another city. You're from Canada, Vancouver, but you're not from there. You're from Finland." Anybody can take and trace that man standing there all the way back. You're not from here. You're from Vancouver. You're not from Vancouver. You're from Finland. He can take and trace you. You're not from me. You're not from this world of sin. Neither are you from you from this church. Neither are you Presbyterian. Neither are you Pentecostal. Neither are you anything else. You're a son of God, a daughter of God. And your home is in eternity. Your home is in another world. I'm not going to leave you here to mildew. I'm not going to leave you here to be burdened down with these cares. I'm not going to leave you here. I'm taking you where I am &gt;&gt; of that stone that was cut out of a mountain without hands. It didn't come out of a book. It didn't come out of some theologian's mind. It didn't come out of a Bible school, some institution. &gt;&gt; It came from the very mind of God. came speaking through a mouth, vindicated mouth, &gt;&gt; I speak now personally. Oh, when I when that stone spoke, when a voice came out of that stone to me, "Come out of her and be separate, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; You be my people." Oh, how it resounded to the very depths of my soul. Prophet, what about all these anointed ones? What about all these prophecies? What about all the speaking in tongues? What about it? And I know that their life is not right. They tell nasty jokes and all kinds of things. And he began to quote the scripture scriptures that I knew. But now it was coming from a different source. And it settled all my questions. Is it coming from another world? It's a place of absolute power. A world of absolute power. Since when? Tell me the last time you heard or where you read where any man stood in front of thousands of people and spoke these words. And every spirit in the building is subject to me by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Every spirit. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a lot of spirits in this building. &gt;&gt; This ministry came and took subject every spirit by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What world is he in? A world where we eat, drink, and drive in a car? No, another world. A spirit world. He's in another world. I take control of your spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not once. That's not an odd phrase. That happened over and over again. He took control of the spirits. &gt;&gt; That's why he said don't move. &gt;&gt; Don't flash a camera. &gt;&gt; Every spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I take possession &gt;&gt; of every spirit in this building. &gt;&gt; When did you hear words like that? &gt;&gt; I take possession &gt;&gt; a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; A man with weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A man of not tired. &gt;&gt; A man who didn't maybe speak the queen's best English. &gt;&gt; Think about those words. Your spirit. You don't even have control of it. &gt;&gt; You don't have control of it. &gt;&gt; And here comes a man says, "I take control of it. I take possession of it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you that was a William Brandon speaking. God Almighty is the only one. Take possession of your soul, your spirit. &gt;&gt; Take possession of it. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God it wasn't entrusted to some TV evangelist. &gt;&gt; I thank God he didn't loose my spirit to some is some minister, but he looed it to a prophet. word prophet &gt;&gt; who would do it no damage &gt;&gt; and wouldn't send you home wounded &gt;&gt; but send you home healed send you home delivered &gt;&gt; are you with me &gt;&gt; absolute power absolute knowledge and absolute authority he says and every person is now under subjection to this supernatural being. &gt;&gt; Next time you hear a tape, next time you hear that voice, you just better think about where it originated. If you believe me as his prophet, you can receive what you desire. That was the key. And I said today before I come up to this pulpit said I'm so glad not only glad not only thankful that oh God and you begin to speak to me. There had been no voice like this. There been no prophet like this. There's been no vindication like this. You can search all your search engines. You can go through all the theology you want. You can go through all the Bible dictionaries and the Bible commentaries and the ancient fathers and the anti-sean antiian fathers and the postnian fathers. You can go through all them. You'll not find anybody saying these kind of words said, "Oh God, how thankful I am you allowed me to be called in this hour at this time under this voice. I believe that prophet's voice. So why do I say that? Because no, no one demonstrated that kind of vindication. And he gives that vindication said I can take control. I take possession of your spirit. And every spirit he said is under my control for the glory of Jesus Christ. And that supernatural being that is here now, which was that being. And I felt within my depths of my soul that being I asked him if he would be in attendance at this pulpit today and in this building today. And if you feel anything echoing down into the inner regions of your soul, it is that being. It's not me. &gt;&gt; It's not the emotion of the moment. what you believe the vessel to be. &gt;&gt; And if you think I'm some kind of hypocrite, you won't get any value out of this message. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that he was a vindicated prophet of God, you'll not get what you desired. &gt;&gt; He was the vessel. Can I go just a few more minutes? I'll say, "Oh my, in the midst of Satan's Eden, oh, how he had developed it up." Enchanting once again, exciting. If you got burdens, he's got he's got a program that you can forget your burdens. He's got all kinds of ways and avenues for you to forget the reality of this life. You don't have to be worried about your problems. &gt;&gt; They've got drink, they've got drugs, they've got dollars. It's exciting. Making dollars is exciting, but I'd like to see you at the tomb &gt;&gt; clutching a million bucks and see what it does for you. All kinds of ways to escape reality, but there's none like this. There's no way like the like his way &gt;&gt; to escape the reality of this world. For Jesus said, you are not of this world. &gt;&gt; And I hope it means something more to you today. Why? He said, I'm not from this world. &gt;&gt; I'm from above. He said to the Pharisees, you're from below. I'm from above. I come from above. I'm going back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. says, "And I'm going now to prepare a place for you, &gt;&gt; and I will come again and I will receive you unto myself. I will come again and receive you unto myself." He's not going to come here, walk by the shores of Galilee or walk downtown Bellingham or Seattle or Vancouver. That's not what he's going to do. He's going to come He's going to He's going to draw near from the world that he's in and draw us into his world. &gt;&gt; He's not coming down to suffer in this world again. He's not coming down to taste our way of life anymore. He's going to take you into his. &gt;&gt; And that's so he had to start with the be. He had to start with the creation. He had to begin to say to this little lump of clay that came into the earth, let this earth bring forth, &gt;&gt; not bondage, liberty. Let this earth bring forth not unrighteousness, righteousness. &gt;&gt; Let this earth that's bound by habit and bound by the world. Let this earth bring forth Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it did. &gt;&gt; And it did at his word. &gt;&gt; It brought forth righteousness. It brought forth, brother John, a life you couldn't live yourself. &gt;&gt; It brought forth at the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. Sister Margaret delivered you from lupus. Now, the Elite sat there in the office and said, "Call her and curse that thing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was already cursed, but you believed it and it happened. Hallelujah. And he's the same God today. That demon of cancer has been destroyed at Calvary. Destroyed. God's already healed you. Nobody can heal anyone. He's already done the healing. &gt;&gt; It's believing it. &gt;&gt; Believing what he sent. He that believeth on him who he has sent hath everlasting life. &gt;&gt; We don't believe on him who he has sent. &gt;&gt; That person might be right next to you. &gt;&gt; Might be behind the pullpit. might be the prophet of God. Not might be. It is &gt;&gt; that God sent in the midst of Satan's Eden. I can't quit, friends. Not for a few moments. I can't quit. In the midst of Satan's Eden, come a rock in the arm of Revelation 10:1. a mighty angel descending from heaven. He wasn't designed by any man. He come descending down into Satan's Eden to claim his bride in the end time and to wed her and to announce to her she was not of the world as I am not of the world. Hallelujah. And as Satan had no place in me, he has no place in you. And he had to tell you, your mind, your womb is sealed &gt;&gt; and it's been prepared for my seed and my seed alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I remember this. I remember that." He says, "Forget it. I'm making you a new creature in Christ Jesus for a new world. &gt;&gt; I've started making the world and I must populate it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said now he's standing in the midst of his church revealing who he is in this last day. He calls himself the author of the creation of God. It's another creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This has nothing. This has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. He's the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. Listen friends, we say glibly sometimes, I'm a member of the bride. But think about how this came about. This great creator who rose in the volcanic eruption out of the tomb with a new body who promised you a body like his body. He said, "I have created you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Not just a creature, but a woman, a bride for me, for myself. I designed you. I thought about you before the foundation of the world. Before Adam even walked here on earth, I thought about you. &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of wisdom is that?" Absolute wisdom. He says, "The world that is to come." I'm going to close in about six, seven minutes at 1:00. The world that is to come. He said, "Right now in Revelation series, right now it is a spiritual kingdom. It is not of this world system even as we are not of this world. And that's the reason we act different from the world. Our citizenship is in heaven. We reflect the spirit. We reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king. &gt;&gt; That's why you're oddball. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to be. And if you're not, you better check out what you're reflecting. &gt;&gt; We reflect the spirit of the world that we come from. Right. &gt;&gt; He said in things that are to be concerning that world, he said it's continuing. It's continuing of this same life in another world, another place. You're going to be who you are. You're going to have a different body. It won't be subject to these senses in another world. And he says, "One time," referring to himself, he says, "One time I was his or Satan's property, but not now." One time the little woman was his property, but not now. He come to lose the grip of it. He lose the grip of sin, of Satan upon my life, upon your life, and now we're not his. Oh my. He said in future home, not annihilated. You're not going to be annihilated. Said, uh, not annihilated, but take your hands off it to loose it. Let it go. Pass away. &gt;&gt; You have, if you believe what we've been saying this morning, you have that perfect and absolute right to say, "Take your hands off of God's property &gt;&gt; and keep them off. pass away. In other words, loose it, disappear. &gt;&gt; Oh, we let sometimes the enemy just hound and hound and stay on our case. Don't we should not do that. &gt;&gt; Just confirm in your own heart and declare with a confession. &gt;&gt; He has no right. &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of God's property. I'll soon conclude the absolute talk about the absolute knowledge, absolute wisdom, absolute power, absolute authority. I I can't pick up anything else. It's all here. And absolute the absolute of thus saith the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe God has called this age into account to account with the paradigm of the original creation. &gt;&gt; This man we call brother Brandham. This man spoke from another world so much of the time. He described what it was like. He acted in it. and and the and and listen now, God doesn't God God doesn't honor falsehood. He acted according to what he saw in another world and the results was in this world. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me he didn't have some authority. &gt;&gt; And he did that not to raise up his position, but that you and I would understand where this is coming from. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't look on it just as you know healing for the body or something to make life better here. It's to prepare you for that world. The world which is to come. Prophet said Jesus didn't know, people didn't know what world he was in. He was in another. He said something happens. It's another world. There's no no need of trying to explain it. So he said it can't be explained. says, "Now, is this announcement or is this correct?" I feel a little time pressure now as I said a close. But he says, "We are in an exodus." You're actually, you say, "Well, I turned another birthday. I'm 50 now or I'm 40 now or I'm 60 or I'm 70 or whatever more. That's not how you're moving along. get my message. You are being You talk about jet propulsion. &gt;&gt; We've got word propulsion. &gt;&gt; We're being propelled by the word that was spoken. &gt;&gt; And God is moving you sometimes imperceptibly and you I want you to get your eyes off of your personal aging process and and have your eyes more on God moving you through this age. And if a prophet if the prophet didn't come and say you're 50, he said you're in an exodus. &gt;&gt; Do I have to tell you this world's passing away? Jesus said it was passing away. Paul said in Hebrews that they perish but thou remainest and they all wax. He's talking about the earth and the heavens. They all wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture thou shalt fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same. Someone uh Sister Magda I believe it was sent me gotten some various emails and uh addresses where they have pictures of the tsunami. Of course, we don't want to keep referring to that, but they had satellite pictures of the areas before and after. Very, very clear, very sharp, very detailed. And I can tell you that God allowed the coastlines to change. That which was a certain shape before is in that shape today because of what was allowed in this tremendous eruption. That's only a small eruption. &gt;&gt; Tell you what he said. Los Angeles &gt;&gt; will slide into the ocean. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to be filled with fear and run here, run there, or run any other place, but it's going to be it's going to slide into the ocean for her sin and her corruption. I was doing some research, but listen, uh, I'm just going to be quick. Brother Brandham speaks about the invasion of America. I don't want you to hear it. America, Canada, it's all six of one, half a dozen of another. Here's how he starts out. Notice in France they started all their rottness and going on the way they lived over there and then God sent Germany in to them to beat them off a little bit. Then we went over there to save their hide. And as soon as we done that and won the war, sent the Germans back, had peace with France, did they turn to God? No, sir. Woman, wine, debauchery, sin, filth to the gills. Then what did they do? What happened? Here's where we started. The devil set up his headquarters there. There's where he started right there to demoralize the world from Paris, France. Then if you notice, he couldn't set he couldn't get in here through the ministry. So the thing that he done, you have to remember this 54. He couldn't get in here through the ministry. So the thing that he done was come in to Hollywood out here. Now, I'm not done, &gt;&gt; but just remember now, there's the same mouth that says to a man standing here, you're not from this place. You're not from this country. You're from another place. You're it's it's Canada. It's Vancouver, but you're not from there. You're from Finland. Now, he's following the corruption of the nation &gt;&gt; and the invasion of the very country he's in. &gt;&gt; And it says the power had its headquarters. It was seated over there &gt;&gt; and there was a physical war. There was a physical conflict and we went over there and and armies were exchanged wars and battle and some were defeated and some won some victory. But was there any cleanness to it? No. &gt;&gt; And what they did he said they couldn't get in here through through the ministry. So the thing that he done was come in to Hollywood out here. He set up his headquarters over here in Hollywood. The devil landed back here a few years ago, 15 or 20 years ago. He was so accurate, it would shake you in your boots, if you even saw the rest of my notes. He's so accurate of the time &gt;&gt; that that Hollywood begin to take its power. And he talked about the backsliding Wall Street Jews. And it was the Jews who came over in the early 1900s and they came to they came to California to escape Edison's Edison had copyright on moving pictures and they wanted to escape his agents so they came all the way to California so they could get away from the royalties on his on his uh uh what do I want to say on his patents. And so that's why they settled over there and and uh uh Goldwin Meyer and Zukov and Zukardis and Fox and all these guys are Jews. When you think for a moment that when when God has already prophesied and Jews who ought to be in Israel &gt;&gt; now have become so degraded, &gt;&gt; so backslid that they become the very instrument to spew out the perversion of Eden across the whole world out of Hollywood where a little prophet stand up when everybody scream screaming, "Fight communism, fight communism, fight communism." And he stands up with one voice says, "Forget communism." It's just a tool in the hand of God. Satan's got a seat in Hollywood. Hollywood gave you the fashions that's in our stores. Hollywood has given you all the magazines that's on the magazine rack. Hollywood has made popular &gt;&gt; the rise of woman &gt;&gt; in the world and the disgrace of her &gt;&gt; as well. her righteous and her god-given uh graces that the prophet speaks about. Hollywood has dragged them. He says, "I feel sorry for them." And they turn around, call him an enemy of the women. He &gt;&gt; said, "I feel sorry for them." &gt;&gt; He says, "They're in a trap. They're in a snare. &gt;&gt; Don't even know what they're doing. Hollywood did it. He says he went in with his great army and went and hit in Hollywood, California. He's invaded the United States with his demon powers. Right. All of our fashions come from Paris. They get into Hollywood and onto the screen and these little girls and little boys and he goes on. He's preaching on the invasion of America. There wouldn't be very many that would believe that back then, but America and our nation has rotted from within. &gt;&gt; We have no substance left. &gt;&gt; We have no integrity left. and it's been accepted. And I thought I would just do a little looking and see how the world has even connected Hollywood with Babylon. And that's a very famous book, Babylon, Hollywood, and they trace its history. And they said that this book, this book has uncovered all of those hidden dark secrets of Hollywood. On the cover is Marilyn Monroe, not very well-dressed. Now, I'm concluding. United States is the greatest power in the entire earth and President Bush is the most powerful man on earth as far as military power is concerned. This last election they said was influenced by two movie directors, Mel Gibson and Michael Moore. And one brought forth The Passion of Christ, which they thought would be a flop and has been an enormous success financially speaking. And Mel Gibson did that. And this Michael Moore targeted the President Bush and his family. And he and both of them galvanized two groups in America. And that is why America was divided right down the middle. And Mel Gibson, they said, galvanized all the fundamental Christians and brought them in behind President Bush. And Michael Moore galvanized all the liberals. galvanized them all on the Democratic side with his movie of Fahrenheit 9/11, I guess it was. And the United States right today has a grave concern that their political power is going to be dictated from Hollywood &gt;&gt; because those are the people. I have a list here of the celebrities that were working for the Democrats and the celebrities working for the liberals. And I can tell you it is some eyeopener. And there's article after article after article about how they influenced and how they affected and what they should have done, what they shouldn't have done, and how the Democrat should have shouldn't allow this celebrity to say thus or thus or thus. And so what are they saying? What did the prophets say? &gt;&gt; What do they say? And do you think that devil changed his colors just because he went from Hollywood into politics? That's why he said Satan is in control of politics. &gt;&gt; But we didn't dream when we first read that. When we first heard that how he was going to control the politics, we didn't dream that the whole economy of the world, are you listening? was going to go from agriculture pre-cond world war &gt;&gt; and then because of war because of death because 54 million people died the world became industrialized &gt;&gt; suddenly isn't that marvelous now it became industrialized and we got more things and more material things and more wealth and then it went from the industrial revolution to the technical revolution and the world become driven the economies of the world become driven by technology and the computer and the advancement along that line. But now they have announced and statistically so that the economies of the world is driven by entertainment &gt;&gt; and entertainment has its roots in Hollywood and of every if Satan himself and every demon from hell has made it its headquarters what is the world getting ready for judgment. There's no way to escape it. They've glamorized homosexuality and lesbianism and every kind of terrible sin. They've glamorized it. They haven't only made it acceptable, they made it popular. &gt;&gt; Who could do that? But those people, &gt;&gt; it's a hell hole. &gt;&gt; And God's going to sink it. &gt;&gt; And a prophet said it's going to slide into the ocean. There are no doubt be waves. I'm not a bit afraid. They say, "Well, you're on the West Coast. I'm safer in God's will in the middle of a tornado or in the middle of a war or on the top of a volcano when we're in the middle of God's will." God has to have that kind of voice here. &gt;&gt; And from this place, the gospel has been able to go to China, to Yugoslavia, to Serbia, to Congo. And the message has gone so many places and to India and the Philippines and in the in Indonesia. Got a call from Brother Ernie. Got a call from Brother Ernie. He was at the airport. He said, "Brother Ed, there's about a hundred at least a hundred ambulances outside and they're firing the wounded and the injured from the tsunami." He said, "I've never He said it's like being in the middle of the tribulation. This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The angels beckoned me from heaven's open door. &gt;&gt; And I don't feel at home &gt;&gt; in this world anymore. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? I say, "Let this world go. &gt;&gt; Don't be tied up with it. Don't be taken up with it. It's passing away." Jesus said it is. &gt;&gt; Jesus said it 2,000 years ago, and you're living to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to think these things over seriously? If you would think them over seriously. I've been long no service tonight. just pray for us. I'm thinking about things that I've never thought about before. It's &gt;&gt; really amazing what God is doing. I want to be in the center of his will. I want to keep every word for I want to hear welcome. Well done. Let's stand. Thank you for your kindness and your patience sitting and waiting such as you have. I want to thank brother Lance for his uh gracious uh attitude and he was all ready for tonight. Brother Lance has a message very much on his heart and I just felt that it's too valuable to have our brother Lance preach and a third of the people miss it or some try to get on stream and you can't stream now near as well when so many people are on it. And so I want he's going to be speaking the 23rd and I think the 30th, the last two Sundays of this month. So, Brother Lance has a word from God on his heart and we want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid down somewhere beyond angels from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at all in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels said to me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this pure anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus. years ago. I know you see me through though I am weak and poor and I can't [Music] anymore. Oh Lord know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my own then what will I do? The angels can't be me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Destroy in the glory land. We live eternally. And saints on every victory. The song is still praying back from heaven shore and I can't hold this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? the angels back to me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a people that could say, "These are the days of Elijah." &gt;&gt; That's what makes you what you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; It'd be good to sing that. made a brother on. We got about three, four microphones up here. We should have some brothers come up and give us some Jason, you brother Paul, you like to sing that. How many microphones have we got? John, what about you? You'd sing that. All right, there we are. as we use up all the microphones. Who wants to say it? [Music] These are the days of Elijah preparing the word of the Lord. And we are the prophets of angels, righteousness restored. And all these are days of trial of confidence and sorrow. We were the Lord in the desert crying preparing away. [Music] [Music] Salvation God and we sing the words of his trials and these are the days of his servant Elijah rebuilding the altar of praise and the days of the highest.

There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no bright [Applause] [Music] salsa here. I wonder if we could just bow our heads in prayer. And I wonder if God moved upon the congregation and you're here and you're not ready for that moment. You're not ready for that time and you want to say, "I want lift my hand. I want to identify myself. I want to be prepared. I want the Holy Spirit now to do that final work in my life. Oh God. Oh God, you are already healed. You are already delivered. &gt;&gt; You're already set free. And if you want somebody to pray with you, you just step forward and come down here. We'd be happy to pray with you. We got men of God, deacons, and we got ministers and so on be happy to pray with you. Feel like you'd like to come? You need to come. Oh God, Father, we know not what more to do, we spoke what was so heavily laid upon my own heart woke up and I was thinking and pondering and rejoicing in when that voice resounded deep within my own young heart. Oh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God that showed himself in Boaz, a kinsman redeemer. God revealed in Jesus Christ, and there is no God but Jehovah. There is no God but you. There are people here, Lord. They need to believe what you have said. They need to believe your word right now. They need every shackle of their mind to be broken aunder. &gt;&gt; Loose their mind, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May the traditions and may the bonds of their emotion and their spirit be burst Lord so that the word can penetrate to the soul. Let the soul soar out of its cage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it rise. &gt;&gt; Let the soul of man and woman rise. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; oh God, gracious and merciful, gracious and merciful. Show now your amazing grace. Would you? Would you, Lord, upon each life that's represented by a raised hand and more by a raised heart, God, I pray you'll make us so serious with your word and you make us so serious with this message that you send. Make us so serious and sincere with our faith. Help me, Lord, also be more sincere. I pray father do this great work this gracious work upon every life in the name of Jesus Christ. The name of Jesus Christ. We now step into that world of absolute wisdom that absolute authority and absolute power. Your word has declared whom the son sets free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; And we do not have to add anything into it. It's not Calvary Plus. It's Calvary and Calvary alone. It's the blood and the blood alone. It's the word and the word alone. For the word and the blood and Christ are all one, synonymous. Father, may their lives now be touched by the brooding of your spirit upon them in Jesus Christ's name. In Jesus Christ's name. I think we'll just while the brothers are here while we sing when he reached down his hand for me. I was lost and undone and there's someone that more than needs prayer one just come and pray with them. When he reached for me. and he raised [Music] his hand for me. Oh, when he reaches for me.

And also, I'm going to ask him to pray that a a spirit of revelation will continue upon us. I believe that God is seeking to do something within our church, in the believer's heart. It's the hour, friend. It must happen. It just must happen. &gt;&gt; Something's taking place within us. and a prayer request. Brother DDA has just been phoned in from Poland and a sister is in bedridden with multiple cerosis and needs to be delivered. Brother Greg Novakowski has just phoned it into us. So if you'll just take that request as well, brother Diddy, please. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name, great one. our hearts rejoice this morning, Father God, &gt;&gt; to be allowed this great privilege, oh God, of standing in your presence. Lord, realizing that these things didn't just happen, oh God, with the prophet or will happen, oh God, but they're happening right here in our midst, Father. Even as you lead your servant, Father, and the word opening up, Father, dimension, as it were, to lift our souls into a higher realm, oh God, we desire to be sensitized to these things. Oh God, we desire to see you, Father, in your unveiling in this present hour, dear God, as it's going from glory unto glory. We want to hold on to those things, oh God, and see them become effectual in our lives. see them affect us so deeply, so profoundly, dear God, that we'll be more sensitized to that other world, oh God, as we are, Father, finding ourselves in the midst of this great collision, Father, hearing from our theophony, oh God, bumping into them day by day, Father, thing that influence gloring upon our lives day by day.

Mentoposclerosis is nothing to you, oh God. We just pray that faith will take a hold.

Father, may you receive it, oh God, for your church believes today. Lord, our heart is full with faith. Father, faith that has come from hearing your word today.

Oh God, that a promise can become our possession today. Oh father, we so thank you for your servant who labors in the word. We see the pressure oh God that is upon him to bring this hidden mana. Lord God, it's not theology that it's the Holy Ghost. The same God that was with that prophet. We see him moving right in our midst.
