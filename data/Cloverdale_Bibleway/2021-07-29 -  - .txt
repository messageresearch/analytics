TRANSCRIPT
========================================
willing now i want to show um just a very short video clip and i i want especially uh um i'm thinking that my mind this evening is towards the younger folk the teenagers i want you to watch this video clip that we're going to show now it's a little bit on the humorous side but it has a it has a point that i want to talk about afterwards if the brothers would like to put that video clip on um we're looking at social engineering the gentleman in the elevator now is a candid star these folks who are entering the man with a white shirt the lady with a trench coat and subsequently one other member of our staff will face the rear and you'll see how this man in the treasure he tries to maintain his individuality but little by little he looks at his watch but he's really making an excuse for turning just a little bit more to the wall now we'll try it once again here's the candid subject here comes the candid camera staff three of them at least and this man has apparently been in groups before here's a fella with his hat on in the elevator first he makes a full turn to the rear and charlie closes the door a moment later we have opened the door everybody's changed positions now we'll see if we can now let's use if we can use group pressure for some good now in a moment on charlie's signal everybody turns forward notice they take off their hats and now do you think we could reverse the procedure watch conform it's it's human nature and the devil knows human psychology better than you and i know it better than the psychologist he knows the weakness the frailty of human psychology and there is a power to conform and in laodicea we've been given rights rights we have a right to act like an idiot in this age we have a right to do stupid things in this age and nobody blinks an eye the power to conform and we're talking this evening on human biases in particular social engineering social engineering is a political science it's to do with influencing social behavior social behavior demonology is influencing spirits remember isaiah 6 1 and the year the king uziah died when the influences die but unless you have the holy ghost you will fall folly to peer pressure nobody told the gentleman in the elevator to turn around it's also called monkey see monkey doo and if you haven't got the holy ghost when monkey sees monkey will do because that's just human nature social engineering first one is called the bandwagon effect it's the tendency to do or believe things because many other people believe the same they're called group thinkers or heard thinkers like the gentleman in the elevator monkey see monkey too bandwagon well they watch tv so i'll watch tv or they have a little social drink at christmas time not to offend the unbelieving family you know so if they do i can do it it's called the bad wagon effect it's a bias it's a cognitive bias it's the way humans distort reality just to justify themselves
