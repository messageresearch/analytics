TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'll turn to Ephesians uh the first chapter and then I've got one verse there and one verse in Ephesians the 4th chapter and just before we read we'll have prayer once again father we're bringing ourselves before you we want our lives to please you we want oh God the words that are uttered now let them be uttered by the Holy Spirit I believe we're not asking too much when we say holy ghost take control holy spirit have control of speaker and hearers alike and I ask oh God that you will just uh uh bypass this human bodies work through them but bypass oh God let there be no hindrance or any restriction whatsoever May there be a mighty mighty outflow of the Holy Spirit through the Living Word at this time time in Jesus name in Jesus name we give ourselves to you and yield ourselves completely amen amen all right in Ephesians now the first chapter and verse uh 13 and let's read it together in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise and then if you'll turn just over to the fourth chapter and the 30th verse and we'll read that together as well and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let's read that again and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen you may be seated I want to speak and I'm going to give you the title right away because it takes this subject from a little different direction and I just will need your undivided attention and and you pray for yourself and pray for me but pray that we will be able to uh obtain the uh everything that God has here for us I want to speak on sufficiently impressed by the Holy Spirit sufficiently impressed by the Holy Spirit the prophet said that the Holy Spirit himself the holy spirit is a seal now I want to I want you to think in terms of the seal in two ways uh to be impressed to an impress or an imprint you know that is a seal also I I had some uh slides actually of various seals ancient seals some seal from Jerusalem some King's seals and uh they they could determine by the writing that's on the seal where the seal came from or whose it was and if a person was making a certain document or a certain sending letters and you'll find in in the Book of Esther uh the the king seal was used to seal the document by hmon to slay the uh the Jews and then that was reversed and even though it it says in the same in the same scriptures that it could not be reversed what had been sealed by the king but the king hadn't sealed it he had given his ring to hmon and hmon did it and uh and then when uh then the then the king gave Esther control of Hon's household and hmon was hung on his own Gallows and it was reversed the commission was reversed or the sentence of death on the Jews was reversed and it was sealed with the uh King's signate but I'm thinking now of the the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit we're sealed by the Holy Spirit I'm thinking in terms I would like your thoughts to go in this direction that the Holy Spirit impresses you sufficiently and that you yield sufficiently because it is a continual work in a person's life and as a person yields to the Holy Spirit it makes a further imprint or deeper imprint and the scripture tells us that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit uh and brother brandom says in one place and I'll I'll come to the quote a little later on where he says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed and we need to be sufficiently impressed in order for the for our lives to be imprinted by that impression you understand it's an impression in uh in the printing business they use that they call it when uh papers going through the press that it's imprinted it's an impression that's made and the imprint the impression gives words on the paper or on the document and uh and and that's what the uh that's what an imprint in the in the in the the way that I want to have it described that we are impressed by the word or by the spirit of this age or sealed by the holy spirit so uh I I would like to go into not only the seal part but the impression part to impress or to form to fix by pressure and there this age is a pressure age and we are not to yield to that pressure there's pressure from every direction and we are not to allow Our Lives we're going to feel it but not allow Our Lives to be imprinted by that pressure and that's where I'll be coming from I'd like to speak a little further on that and then the seal the Seal of God or the seal that's put on a person and remember it's not only the Seal of God there's also the mark of theast Beast and we'll be touching on that now the Bible tells us I'm going to have you turn in your Bible also uh to uh the book of Acts and uh first we'll turn to the 24th chapter chapter 24 and verse uh 24 and this is Paul before fesus or uh Felix I think maybe it was yes Felix and after certain days when Felix came with his wife jusa uh which was a Jewish Jewish he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ and as he reasoned of righteousness Temperance and judgment to come Felix trembled and answered go thy way uh for the go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for thee and you can read the scripture that convenient season never came right but Felix was impressed amen with Apostle Paul but he wasn't sufficiently impressed he didn't move any further than that if you'll turn with me over to chapter 26 of uh the book of Acts and we find it's very very interesting I won't uh go any further into it than uh just to touch the highlights but if we start with verse one then a grippa said unto Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself I think myself happy King AG grippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews and then he goes into his into his background into the kind of uh life that he lived as a Jew as a Pharisee and then he goes into his uh uh into his the meeting of the Lord the pillar of fire on the road to Damascus and then he'll he comes down to verse 26 I'll read verse 25 and he said I am not mad because fesus has said he was mad and he said I'm not mad most noble fesus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness I'd like you now just to think of Paul uh before these Great Men before these men of authority before these Kings uh before these Governors and whatever more and but you can see the urgency you can see his fervency you can see his Zeal he spoke with such conviction I've met him I I was uh I was so zealous I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and uh and I I lived my life and I reproached the Christians and I cons sended to their death and sent some of them and caused them to blaspheme and I mean he was speaking with such conviction and so then when he comes and and speaks and he says in verse 26 for the king knoweth now that's King Agrippa for the king knoweth these things before whom also I speak freely for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this King was not for this thing was not done in a corner king of gri believest thou the prophets AG grippa didn't even get a chance to answer I know that thou believest and then a grippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian and Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and all together such as I am except for these bonds amen he he impressed those people they were mly impressed and you can see the king himself saying Paul almost almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian he came so close he was so impressed but he wasn't sufficiently impressed I will tell you the Christian businessman uh throughout this land that had had brother brandham there to the meetings and he preached for them and they saw the sign you ought to you ought to read this book or even hear it on tape birth pains because you can see the message is in birth pains right then and those people are so silent because he's talking about Esau and he's talking about Cain and he's talking about those that never went far enough and that and that the world is in a birth pain again I don't want to go there too much this morning because that's where I will be going and and and I can say that the message is in a birth pain amen the message is in a birth pain and the prophet of God was in a was bringing a message that was in a birth pain because if it's in a birth pain it's bringing forth A New Life a new life and and the birth pain that we're into right now and you can be pondering this because this is where I'm going to be coming to the world is in a birth pain it's in travail but travail will bring a new world behold I make a new Heaven and a new Earth and we're rejoicing because that's where our vision is hallelujah I make a new Heaven and a new Earth and I'm impressed with the word that's bringing that new Heaven and new earth I'm impressed with the message Allelujah amen then when the prophet gets to the end of this message he just says well now he just takes it and you can feel the air is so tense and there's so much resistance there but he just has a prayer you can feel a atmosphere just changing then he just starts he calls people out one after the other by their name well the people they were so they were so impressed with that so impressed with what they saw but not sufficiently impressed to receive what was being spoken now a seal is an impression used to seal as I said earlier a letter or documents or to seal a life as long as the seal is in place the contents will remain a mystery unless the seal is broken the contents will remain a mystery and as humans as humans we are very very subject and prone to be impressed and I can tell you that we are impressed with all kinds of things it is said and I can't prove this but this is what I understand from my research that we retain 10% of what we read 20% of what we hear 30% of what we see and 50% of what we hear and see say 70% of what we say and 90% of what we say and do I understand that that is why this age and that is why we say soon as we say Hollywood we think of movies that was a master Stroke Of Satan to take written things and written books and put them into visual form as a a master Stroke Of Satan and it was a further Master stroke to bring that into the front room of houses and it's a further Master stroke you can see how he is using and devising his kingdom around the visual and putting it on your hip in the way of or in your pocket or in your purse in the way of a a an i iPhone or whatever more and people have such visual such access to the visual I understand that we only uh only catch a fraction of what we hear as far as retaining it but what we see we're very impressed with but I was reading and and and pondering this because God uh he moved away Jesus was physical and they saw God In the Flesh but it did not convert them right and it even took the disciples they had to keep watching it watching it and watching it but it was more than watching him they had to hear him and it was the hearing that actually brought the vision to them and as I was studying I I was reading of of of some uh Jewish scholar speaking of the the the Mount Si and I'm going to be I want you to think about that now because when Moses came to the burning bush the Bible says he saw the bush and it was burning but didn't wasn't consumed and he was attracted and said I will turn now and see this great sight and it is said that we as humans we are uh we are attracted to that which we physically see but that is only at the natural level because we are physical beings and like brother Bram said you've never seen me and I've never seen you the real you the real me that goes beyond this physical body of Flesh when we see something we see something acted out or you would see something on a screen that's not reality and it is said that what you hear is more powerful even than what you see because what you see is is it it is restricted to uh uh what you what you see is restricted to I'm thinking something else that's why I'm stumbling around a wee bit but it's restricted to the visual aspect you can if you see something as a witness you have to see something or have to hear something as a witness you see a certain accident you and and you see certain things happen but they say it's it's it's remarkable that uh in a courtroom a judge is he he doesn't go by what he sees he doesn't see what actually H took place and a and he only hears he hears testimony because the hearing has a greater capacity because you're not limited to just what you saw right you're going to have to think about this for a moment when when Moses came before the bush he said I will turn aside now and see this great sight but it was not the seeing of the pillar of fire that transformed him it was The Voice Hallelujah and the voice he couldn't Define The Voice There Was No Object there wasn't any particular shape but he heard a voice I am the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and that changed him and I have seen I've seen the the the the the burden I've heard with my ears I've heard and I'm sending you down to deliver these people so it was it was what the person heard which was greater look at the first pull and the second pull of the prophet's Ministry what what an astounding Ministry 33 years and the people saw it but it didn't change them then the third pole was not Vision the third pole was not visual it was voice in the days of the voice can you say Amen in the days of what you hear because what you hear doesn't have the limitation of the visual part and so people maybe saw lights and saw all kinds of uh pH PHA and whatever more how many people saw the cloud perhaps multitude saw the cloud maybe Millions saw the picture of the CL mystery Cloud over Arizona it didn't mean anything to them and even the prophet said they don't know what it's all about but a voice came out of that for us hallelujah and the voice is life changing the voice can take the false doctrine that you've been raised up in and all of these false things and simply he caused that to vanish in a moment of time there's such power in that voice and those you that were ins snared and trapped in all kinds of religion even from childhood I know it myself and I heard that I had such questions about the baptism about the godhead and I only had to hear some words I had to hear some words I didn't need to see any phenomena I didn't need to see a cloud I didn't need to go to any special place I just needed to hear the word and the word is with power Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit is behind the word and it impressed me and left its imprint on me and once you're once you're stamped with that stamp uh you're marked forever Hallelujah and we can sing the song I am marked marked marked I'm marked now Wherever I Go yes sir Hallelujah as humans we're impressed with things and I'm just going to run over a few things we'll come back to the message side but we're impressed with success someone has said can you measure success with in wealth there are many unhappy rich people in the world what about Fame the tab IDs are full of the sorted details and you can't go buy a a grocery store and pay your bill without seeing all the tabloids that are there and they're wretches they are lives that are wrecked and they've they're called celebrities they're not celebrities they're fallen stars and if they were your neighbor you probably wouldn't want to live near them for the debauchery that they live in and here they have it out there like this is something and you ought to buy this I tell you what it's sickening and they're taken up with the material the material realm their Fame is all associated with things and falsehood and glamorous life often pulls people into degradation and despair Hebrews the 11th chapter tells us of famous people in my book celebrities in God's book there are celebrities they're called Heroes of Faith they're celebrities and here's why they're celebrities by Faith H Allelujah Faith sees the invisible Faith looks into another realm you got that faith not just Moses and Abraham and Sarah you have that faith it looks into another Realm and because of the things that you hear the message of the hour you see things that others don't see and by faith Moses when he came uh when he was come to years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he refused to be be a celebrity by this world he refused even success and power that he could have had but choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt greater riches Egypt had all the gold and and own the land and own the people owned everything we don't have the Democracy doesn't have the kind of life that they lived and the kind of the way the people were controlled and even over there now in some of the Middle East countries it's princes and and these people they own cities right they own towns friend of mine a Jewish man living in Los Angeles which I've talked to you about him but he's a very very dear friend to the uh Prince of Morocco and a few years ago I was with him and he had just returned from there in the prince of Morocco and this way they do business he was going to give him the cell phone industry for the whole nation if he would get a corporation in the United States to come and build two cities he wanted two cities and there were 25,000 that would accommodate 25,000 people per City they were his cities like in the Old Testament the king had the cities and the people would live there and pay uh pay their rent or whatever to the to the king and into the treasury for their living place we don't have that kind of mentality here but that's that's what they did and and in in Moses time Moses wasn't only had all of this position and perhaps the next Pharaoh those were all things which were visible the wealth was visible all of the Power and his position and his celebrity position but he turned that aside for the reproach of Christ and he considered that the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt the treasures of Egypt were physically uh visual could see could be seen But the treasures of Christ could not be seen I say to you here we are in this materialistic generation let's not get hooked let's not get hooked on what you see because it surely is passing away it will pass away away right and it many much of it has passed away many people had their rsps and their 401ks in the states and it vanished in a little simple meltdown overnight it vanished much of it vanished and people today well you can get I get an old age pension they take it all back for me because I'm still preaching but there it isn't enough to buy it isn't enough to buy your food and fuel for your car you know the Canadian government we give you an old age pension thank you very much you live in this area what would what would you get for $1,000 a month or $900 and something dollar $900 and something dollars in this Society in this day what would you do with $900 you can't even rent a basement sweetheart for that and you're supposed to live you're supposed to eat you're supposed to drive a car you're supposed to and you work all your life and pay into it this world it's gone Hallelujah and the faster it goes wherever it's going and it needs to be renovated by a holy fire glory to God did you ever think what's out in space right now going through this room is is images and they might be over in some other country if we had a television here you pick them up that's what the prophet said he had a television you'd pick it up you bring a radio you pick up all the voices all the rest of it and he said in the in the future home that he said there's going to be a that Peter speaks of a fire he said it won't just be a literal fire it'll be a holy fire because it's going to purge the heavens and I can tell you that all those voices will be gone but the voices of the Saints which have the word of God will never leave that space they're there eternally brother Bam's voice is there eternally every Declaration of every Born Again believer that spoke in the name of the Lord even my voice today will never be cleansed out of that by that fire it'll remain there because the scripture says heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away but we get impressed with success and I find it I find it even amongst believers oh they were so successful should I stop or should I carry on and intelligent people people got got you know they can put things together and they've got such retention of mind and all these things listen if you've been given intelligence praise the Lord use it for God's glory if you've been given wealth use it for God's glory if you've been given success use it for God's glory but that don't strive for it in the pool of Bethesda the message pool of Bethesda brother Brandon says the more humbler you get and the less you know about the things of the world the better off you are in the sight of God I didn't get very many amens about that because maybe the world got too much of our mind already says the humbler you get and the less you know about the things of the world the better off you are in the sight of God he said the greatest success I ever had was amongst people who hardly could read or write but now I'm not have I'm not trying to support my ignorance or prejudice es we're not trying to support that we're not supporting ignorance and he says it many many times but he says but I'll say the biggest hindrance to the Gospel of Jesus Christ has ever ever had has been this modern day education not that education is of the of the devil but it sure takes a lot of people there and I'm not going to soften it up I'm going to say what he said amen he said said that's exactly right even in the ministry they've explained everything out of the Bible the blood the days of Miracles the powers it's all explained out how's explained out by you know cultivated cultured Minds we don't want that we want to have those things in our possession it belongs to us it's part of our inheritance in a power of transformation he said now I'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that Civilization notice what he says civilization Science Education and the things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of Satan that's right he said even civilization he said civilization never come by God civilization came by Satan and I'll prove that to you by the word in just a minute civilization is not a God can we say amen he said for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we are always killing ourselves and he says this civilization has built up to this Pinnacle now and we've got death in this civilization we've got sin in this civilization we've got sickness in this civilization and that can't be of God and I say Amen amen God's got it sorted out God's got it fixed out the higher we get in Civilization The More Death that's associated with it and he said that Civilization will have none of these things I just touch it now that's why we're in a travail that's what causes the travail that's upon the believer we're in a travail and Jesus spoke of it but he says but you will have joy there will be a travail but you'll have joy I'm just going to leave it there in the in uh we're impressed with beauty we like nice things and God of this evil age he said the sons of God saw the daughters of men not Daughters of God Daughters of men the daughters of men that they were beautiful and it caused the sons of God to fall into this delusion and took them kind of women and married them and it brought an age of prostitution just like it is today like it was in Sodom like it's predicted to be uh predicted to be today that when men and women of this day swap wives and they don't like this wife and they go over to Reno Nevada and get married and divorce and that one and marry again in 15 minutes and women so pretty that they're almost irresistible and what is it the devil see Satan still in Beauty now that doesn't mean we're all put out of a machine like so many sausages or whatever everybody has their own appearance and whatever more but the the fashion of the world is is designed to take whatever attri God gives a person man women both especially women and to and to beautify them beyond what they actually are and that's what men fall for and they fall for something and they the hair now forgive me but when they marry them or whatever they find that's not what they married you folks live in the same world I live in right and they find out it's completely different they find out the person is different the color of their hair is different and their face isn't that color anymore and get all the Max Factor washed off and that's not how they look and no wonder you know and maybe the man himself I don't know I I better get off this subject pretty soon but anyway the Bible says that in James in in the Book of James it says for if there come unto you and your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in Vile reignment and you have respect to him that wearth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my foot stol are you not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts hearken un hearken my beloved bre hath not God chosen is asking a question has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith Hallelujah the poor of this world rich in faith and hes of the Kingdom which God hath promised them that loved him God is impressed with poor [Applause] people God's impressed with people that are poor not just poor but rich in faith but you have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do not they blaspheme and and that worthy Name by which you are called so we are not to be impressed listen as a pastor as a minister of the Gospel you know you you have people I I'll never forget some years ago and it's very fresh on my mind there was a we had a convention Brother Don osbor arranged a convention in Phoenix at the convention center and uh there was uh 11 12 1300 people coming to the meetings I was a stranger to most of the people I knew some of the ministers but there was a uh and we had a radio broadcast down there and so I was interviewed at the at the radio station and the woman it was a manageress over the station and she said I have been asked to ask you some questions from a woman Minister and she said do you mind and I said well no I better go and get my Bible then if I'm going to have to answer the questions and I knew for sure it be onto the serpent seed or on you know something like that so I went and got my Bible and that woman I found out that her son was a Believer and went to the church in Flagstaff Arizona and so she she was well-versed in uh in the message teachings and so on on and so then she came to the meeting and brought a friend of hers and this friend of hers they said we'd like to see you after the service so I said fine and we just went into a little Al Cove there while the people were it was just immediately after the service and uh this woman The Other Woman very nicely dressed I was impressed she had on a suede powder blue suit you know just light sueded the whole suit and she was I could see that suit cost a lot of money I can see right away she wasn't poor and so they wanted to talk and they had been in brother brenham's meetings both of them over at the other Church in Phoenix uh church or maybe some of you from down there would remember uh brother Outlaw wasn't that his church brother Randy right and they both went to Brother Outlaw's church and uh they had been firm Oneness Believers and then things got you know kind of got went sideways and so on so forth and so she then begin to her turned out that her husband was the manager of General Motors for three entire countries over in the Middle East someplace or something and he had passed away and left her very very wealthy and so she was concerned about some of this and as she was speaking I guess the Lord you know just gave me some insight I said well what she had these stalks you know and she she had three own three television stations and and right away soon as she said your three television stations I said what's bothering you is the booze the booze advertisements well she says if I had the money in the she just completely caved in said if I had the money in the bank how do I know where the bank's putting the money I said yeah but you happen to know and and those advertisements you're you're M making profit of those advertisements and you're putting forward alcohol and booze on radio on your television stations and that was exactly it she was very very very nice about it and all the rest of it but did did that mean anything to me the fact that she's in a beautiful suit or the fact that you're dressed the way you are hey we're worth probably with inflation about 60 CS we want to remember that we're not worth a whole lot it's your soul that's worth everything and I can tell you I never I just it it didn't have any effect on me whatsoever fact that she had all this wealth or anything I didn't count out to it a bit didn't have any interest in it I've never had any interest in it they are what they are and and uh the thing that would have meant something to me is if she would have said I heard I heard in the service tonight I heard something and and by hearing it have her life imprinted [Applause] am but you can see having all of that wealth left to her put her in an impossible situation impossible for the natural person I hope this is making some sense to you we're impressed with skills and with abilities we're impressed with I'm impressed with self sacrifice if I find people and Men even they may not be people of the message but they've been somehow they've laid their lives down and uh in a self-sacrifice and they've turned their back on what they could have been or could have done I'm I'm I'm impressed with humility and I'm impressed with Simplicity the Bible says in the scripture that holy men of God spake as they were moved moved they were impressed and they were moved for the prophecy came not of Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and these holy men of God for the most part many of them were slain by their peers right right they were considered failures in their generation right true brother Bren tells an account of U I think there was uh some young boys says he was reading an article and there was a home and there was five boys born in this home some of you know where I'm going but don't draw a conclusion to it five boys were born in this home and as soon as the oldest got old enough he went to the Navy off to the Navy he went the second one followed and the next one until all five all five went to the Navy and there was no Marines or navy men in their family and the mother and father couldn't understand just why these boys everyone wanted to go to the Navy there was a real fine investigation made of this in other words a really query why this happened and I came to find out in the bedroom where these boys all were brought up in this bedroom there was a beautiful big picture hanging hanging there of a big ship sailing on quiet calm sea and it so impressed those boys that they went to bed at night looking at this picture it was on their mind to sail that quiet soothing sea and along the morning when they arose the first thing that they could look at was that ship making her way through the quiet calm sea and it impressed the boys so it impressed them so right that each one became a sailor now he said if a picture will impress boys to become Navy men Sailors of the sea what ought the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ do now listen friends we've got to really you know be down to Brass tax with this all through the Old Testament they heard the word of God and holy man of God removed and Prophets spake in the name of the Lord and they killed them and and all through their all they had was word word word and then the word became flesh the word didn't impress them sufficiently and the flesh didn't impress them sufficiently because it was it was confined to the person they saw and there was no Beauty in him that we should be attracted to him there was nothing he he didn't have the perhaps the size and and the physique and the demeanor that impressed anybody we see somebody in their their weal built and they just look you know the picture of health and the picture of beauty we become impressed and we shouldn't get impressed we shouldn't allow ourselves to be impressed by that I'm I'm sounding Out a warning in the message today we don't want to be impressed in fact is I can tell you I I strive the other way around I I don't tell a lot of people about you know even what God has done in the Supernatural and what is happening in the message because I don't want the success to impress them amen because that's what that's not what's supposed to draw a person sir I see people come in here sometimes I've had lots of unbelievers come in here and they looking here and they walk in the doors and say oh and I just I just get done with that as quick as possible I'm not interested in people getting impressed a man came into the log church one day and he came into the little uh in the little room where we were doing the cleaning up of the tapes and all the tapes were in along the walls all in their numbers and everything and he walked in like this and he just stopped like he came into the presence of something and he looked around he said to me sir I don't know what's on these tapes but whatever it is means a great deal to you people it's a real treasure to you and I said it is he was he was impressed so impressed with the way that we were treating the word of God prophet of God said to the people and I I and and I'm saying I'm preaching to myself are we sufficient ly impressed five young men were sufficiently impressed and they were so impressed with the image of the ship that had actually transformed their lives into Sailors they became in other words the vision became a natural event they became Sailors surely the Christ that we see by the voice that we hear the message that we've received we can say so many times in the days of the voice the we can Rejoice about that but in the days of the voice what we should be able to say is what I heard transformed me into the image of Jesus [Applause] Christ and that's what the message is is to for that's what it's to do it's to transform us into something else right I see and I see brother Josh God bless you brother Josh we had a nice time the other evening and then you were texting me in the morning and said what do I do now I don't hardly think there's anything to say that's why I didn't text you right back because it sounds to me like God did it all already he was wondering what to do it is just amazing brother Josh sitting right here we had about an hour or or better the other night from about 10:30 to about 11:30 and uh and I just said some words to him about the direction of his life and he's been studying in college University or college for five years and it would be another few years but he has such a desire to do something for God and uh and he'd like to be here I hope you don't mind me saying this brother Josh he would like to be here he said I feel so much apart he said the people were so welcoming and had such a wonderful time spiritual time out at the out at the camp and and has been with the other in homes and families etc etc and I said well you have a hunger for God he said I do that is my main hunger I want to be able to do something for God I want to be able to do something that's good that's real good but we mustn't let you know whether it be college or education or work or business or money or success or popularity or fame put a cramp on that so I just concluded with brother Josh and that it fits my message I'm not I'm not saying it because it spoke with him I said that that that your education must be your servant your job must be your servant your business must be your servant and you only have it to further your main purpose on life and your main purpose on life is be transformed by the power of God I tell you what friend success has taken a lot of people away from God and downhill we don't want that kind of success I mean if we have enough to eat and we have a place to sleep we want to be happy about that but what we want to do is say what I'm impressed with is what I've heard and that that hasn't given you any specific image it keeps changing as time goes on and you find that this message this Christ he's adequate for any situation today tomorrow for success for the best economy for the worst economy for any meltdown he's he he's he's more than that he's greater than those things are you willing to say Amen to that he's greater than your education Hallelujah put God first I'll never never apologize for saying put God first am put it ahead of successor put it ahead of your beauty or put ahead of your youth in the message Spirit of Truth he said I've always made this statement I was glad got a hold of me I was glad that God got a hold of me before the church did hard to tell what I'd have been but I was thankful to the leadership and the direct contact that the Holy Spirit impressed my life with before I even surrendered it the Holy Spirit kept the order of things the Holy Spirit impresses a person and he was impressed even before he surrendered it in other words the surrendering came as a result of him being impressed and God gave a world a prophet and he lived a prophet's life and I'll say something further he lived a holy prophet's life and he had thousands and tens of thousands of enemies that would have loved to put a finger on him but the more they examined him the clearer and the purer his life was and they couldn't find anything right be it popularity be it money be it women be whatever could not find a thing with his life thank God for a holy prophet to speak a holy message we have confidence in that message but I will say this he said I'm glad that God got a hold of me before the world did before the church did before religion did why because religion stamps an image on a person it gives them their thought and their ideas is this all right in the message that called out he was relating about India and he said in India instead of having fences they have walls and their barns Are Made of Stone many of them and where the cattle would stand around in the shade of the wall all the cattle and the Sheep took off to the middle of the field and the little birds that had their nest in the coves of the barns flew away out into the forest before the earthquake happened because the walls would fall on them he said there was no one to drive them out there was no literal sign nothing that they saw to show that there was an earthquake coming but being that God takes care of his own how many of his own are here this morning God knows where you're at God knows your financial sit God knows your condition God knows all about that let's praise him and he does this for birds and he does this for cows and animals and he says he cares for his own they had a feeling and they were impressed by the Holy Spirit to get out of way from the trouble can you imagine a prophet saying the birds and the animals were impressed to get away from it I can tell you friends for a lot of the stuff I see today I get afraid of it come on you need to pray Holy Spirit impress me to move away from that to get clear of it if there's a question get away from it should I wear that if there's a question about what you should wear move away from it if there's a question about what you're doing just move away from it you know why I don't have newspapers come to my own I buy one occasionally but I don't have newspapers because I can't go through newspaper without feeling I've been defiled yes there's something there you see in a newspaper in the Vancouver son or the province or or your paper and by the time you're through it you feel defiled or advertising something or they're saying something and they're Godless and they mock what I treasure and I just feel I shouldn't expose myself and let the world and let Satan in the world mock my faith and mock my belief in the pergan church age and here's where my text is he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst right the word in my brother the word in my sister the word coming over the pulpit I've been impressed not only impressed I listened to Brother John Andy's preach in the last couple weeks I listen to brother Tom preach I listen to brother Ron Spencer preach and the preaching of the word affects me very deeply but I'm preaching this to myself now this morning it's not enough to be in church and have your heart and spirit touched and moved it needs to be moved sufficiently so that you go out and do something about it once the man of God's been behind the pulpit and delivers his soul then it's up to the people to go out and say now my life take shape to how I was impressed I said this morning before I came to the pulpit what would you have me to do I feel affected in certain ways what would you have me to do I want to what would you be pleased with and it's not always easy it's not always the easy way sometimes it's the harder way and when the Lord spoke in a tongue and Inter interpretation through Danny Henry said because you've chosen the harder way and it's been your own choosing why would it be harder because there could have been success he could have been one of the greats of the world but he turned it down to stay with a little band of people poor people maybe disorganized people in his Tabernacle I went there and there see about maybe 400 450 people and I know this man standing up there could have 400,000 I was impressed I was impressed with that kind of a life amen I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and the message went what went ye out to see he said John was man enough to be meek and humble he was man enough to stand on the banks of Jordan he didn't need a great synagogue or a place to preach he was humble he took the bright blue skies he took the bright blue skies he was humble enough that he didn't call upon the people to have to have so much money to Pastor their church he lived off of the grass Hoppers and wild honey and Jesus said what did you go out to see now he was zeroing in what was it that impressed you why did you go out there he didn't have fine clothing so it wasn't that he didn't speak nice flowery message so it wasn't that and he was pinning them down what is it you went to see and I could even say in message here birth pains if all those men were here I'd like to ask them that whole group of people why did you invite him it wasn't his nice language it wasn't his grammar it wasn't his command of the English it wasn't even as he said I'm not a preacher I can't put things together it wasn't that it wasn't a flowery message what did you go out to see the same reason those Pharisees went out to hear John because there was something in their heart deep down inside of saying he speaks the truth there was something inside saying God is with this person and I say to you this morning do you have do you have sufficient within is this God or is it Satan who is it that's speaking to you is it the Holy Ghost behind the pulpit is it ad viscal if it is vacate this place if it's just brother Tom Ray John Andes brother Ernie vill and wer these other brothers brother uh brother Murphy then just vacate the place now let me tell you this is an upto-date gospel it's an upto-date gospel I'm hewing to the line brother Kim asked me you remember brother Radu the other part of this story is brother Kim I'll just share some with the people I was just going into the meeting in Switzerland and I had counseled with brother Ru he had a spiritual question he was a minister and he also been a pro a translator and oversaw the translation for the voice of God actually and and when I was coming to the service Sunday morning he had a suitcase in his garment bag and he's walking I said where are you going we said we we're we're driving back to Romania oh I said that don't do that you know well he said you know and he began to get a little uh uneasy and I said brother brother Murphy's preaching this morning and I said okay he says I'm going to stay and he just dropped his bags and walked into the meeting with his wife and brother Murphy unleashed the burden of his soul and that man was smitten he told me after I'm so glad I stayed and then he wanted to see can we get these Romanian language messages on the Hub and that's how all that all happened he got so stirred he became so impressed with what he heard out of our brother Murphy's mouth that he was moved to action Hallelujah and because he was moved thousands of other people will hear the message and see it and print it and have it before them I say praise be to God we're not talking about something 40 50 years ago or something pie in the sky in the future we're talking about God on the scene now and it doesn't happen without work hard work not just preaching but work labor do what you can for God you'll never regret it make yourself available and then the prophet says in this message can I have just a few more minutes please he said John was mad enough and then he said Jesus said what did you go out to see did you go out what did you go out to see he asked it twice a person that would give give in to the Pharisees a reed shaken by every wind go in with the Sadducees when they came in one day he's this and another day he's that no he didn't go to see nothing did you go to see somebody dressed fine no an intellectual no what when you to see and he said go show John what's happening he said to the the man that John had sent cuz John was in prison go show John What's Happening Here the lame walk the blind see the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor has the gospel preached to them did this kind of a Ministry he could have had the world at his feet but the poor have the gospel preached to them blessed is he who is not offended in Me Oh my he said that was the sign of the Messiah that was the sign to show him this was the sign of the Messi I that the deaf here and the blind are healed and and the gospel the poor have the gospel preached to them go and tell John this because John will recognize that's the sign of the Messiah friends you and I have had of all the people's on the earth we have had the sign of the Messiah it could not have been clearer than what you have it you have it on your you have it at home you have the evidence of it on home I have it here in this little booklet we have seen the sign of the Messiah and when you hear it when you hear it and when I hear him and brother brandham cries out to these people in this message he says who is that who can do that he's crying out a man can't do that a man can't tell these people their name who's doing that he was trying to get them to say see the sign of Messiah it's Jesus Christ and some were affected and they're impressed and you can hear the response they didn't respond to the preaching of the word but they responded when the secret of the hearts were made known and that because that was visible they could see it but when I hear it I see my beloved bridegroom I see the one I'm United to I love him I love that that atmosphere that it brings I love that Supernatural I'm connected to we're connected to an eternal Realm [Applause] I want to preach and yet I I want to quit that's what my that's what our soul is linked to an invisible and when we hear the word all we have to do is hear it and we see it the hearing is more powerful than the physical Vision because the physical Vision attracts and as impresses the natural man oh he's well dressed oh listen to the music listen to where listen to what he knows listen to his intellect listen to his skills here and we see all that and the natural mind goes ooh oh oh oh we're so impressed we need to lay that aside and we need to hear the word and hear it we hear so much hear the word hear the word eat the book and so on so forth what I'm saying is not so much volumes of what you go through it's what you hear when you hear it and I want to ask you when you hear the next time ask yourself what is it I'm seeing what is it do I see here and does that Vision affect you Jesus said what did you go out to see I don't mean to be too direct but what did you come here for this morning that's really where we're at what did you why did you come why are you here why is this your church why are you professed to be a message believer or you know I just can't let go I just can't let go I just can't let go am I've seen someone I love too much just can't let go I won't give him up for anything take the whole world but give me this Jesus take all the success and take all the wealth and take all the money and take all this stuff it's all just a bunch of trash that's right that's right if God gives it to you use it for the kingdom of God amen hallelujah amen and if he doesn't give it to you don't let that stop you don't let don't let your life be given over to strain for it that are going to eat up my energy and eat up my life and learn all I can learn and and get as far as I can in this world no that's not what it's at but there is a group of people that are impressed by what they hear and by hearing they have seen him brother brandom as God said the poor and how he esteemed them and the gospel was preached to them that is why it wasn't that the people rejected brother Bram it was that he chose the harder way if he could have just they just wanted him to adjust two or three things he could have adjusted and had tens of thousands of people but he chose to be with you he chose to be with the likes of us the sign of Messiah was given to us the sign of the Resurrection was given to you Jesus saying that's what Jesus saying blessed are you for what you see am blessed are you for what you hear and blessed are you that you can give your life amen to be a testimony for him Lord willing I want to come too and I didn't spend I didn't spend the time that I could there are those that are giving their life entirely to the mark of the beast brother brandham said they get marked and they give themselves to it and you think think the mark of the beast is some awful creature no no is a Slicker the churches are full of it the churches today are full of it friends I don't have to tell you that you know that you're in some special place I don't want to tell you that I simply want to tell you the Believers of this message they don't know how to be thankful to the degree that we ought to be thankful that I'm not getting some imprint of some man's idea or some some denominational uh Bible school that has been taught people been taught some of the there's a people that have been taught by the Holy Spirit you want to say thank God I am where I am thank God for the Revelation that has come to my heart and soul you can't be taught a revelation that has to come to you by God said the promise of God is a seal to those who are the Seed of Abraham the promise is a seal I'm just going to I'm going to close in a few minutes the serpent when he approached Eve he said you know has God said so he he came with his Doctrine did God say it was a question and she said well we can eat of all the trees we not to touch the treats in the midst of the garden and and then he he appealed to her it'll make you wise and you'll be like gods and brother bradam said she didn't know but she wanted to know she didn't have the knowledge but she wanted to have the knowledge and so that that that's what caused her to yield and she was left with the imprint you follow me and the Bible says the Bible says then she looked and she saw the tree and it was it was pleasing to her it was pleasant it appealed to her and then you're sick because of that you've been to funerals because of of that the police penitentiaries are full of full of men and women because of that we don't we don't understand we don't grasp the penalty of this and we don't understand the benefit of being free from it Hallelujah and he was cast out of the garden and he and and and the one he was being you as an instrument for was cast out of Heaven he was cast Out of Heaven out of the presence of God and then and then Adam and Eve they had to go out of the presence of God because now they had the mark of the one who had been cast out of Heaven they had his mark his mark on them but God who rich in Mercy made a way back Hallelujah when you go out from here today and you are in your workplace and in this world I would just do everything within my whole being to have you say God deal with me because he can only deal with an individual on an individual level deal with me and we're so different one from the other deal with me in such a way something spoke to me in the service I was impressed with something that was said and I am praying and asking God that you will ask him to take those word take that phrase take that quote and shape my life amen to I will be in the shape and the I'll be in the image of the Lord Jesus Christ the word for this day amen hallelujah hallelujah you know it's um I'm just trying to close but there's a a thing or two out I spoke to you earlier of Moses and the Bible says this because I have the words here in front of me he saw the burning bush and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I'll turn aside now and and and see this great sight why the bush is not not burned and the Lord saw that he turned aside to see and God Called to him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet I have a point I want to make here for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God now please get my point as I close now he was attracted to this site because that was his visual part he was attracted to the site visually attracted why the bush isn't consumed and so he he moved to to look at this now he hears a voice and the one is identifying I'm the god of your father I'm the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and when he heard when he heard that now it was the voice that was speaking to him I want to impress this congregation we can't put enough sufficient emphasis on the voice that you are are our privileged to hear Hallelujah it is the power of of transformation in this hour it will change your life it will change your home it will change your future the power of transformation is in the word and when he heard who it was that was speaking then the scripture says that he hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God now he was seeing something from what he heard that didn't see when he saw it and that is why even the world recognizes that there's a greater effect on a person from what they can hear spiritually if we hear it spiritually in the word I trust that God will take this to your heart amen and now if you want to if you would like I would request that you perhaps hear birth pains and the world falling apart and I want to speak on the two aspects I want to speak on the travail and the joy and a Believer feels both a Believer feels both we feel the travail you're in the world and and and your contact with the world is a travail to you I just just want to get your mind in that in that direction and and I can I can take instances out of the scripture which I won't do right now but it's it's a travail and it's a struggle it's like a Warfare but the Bible tells us Jesus said that Joy comes when a Manchild is born and that's why I'm trying to get you to see friends when you hear the message you shall I say in the name of the Lord see the Manchild you'll see him hallelujah hallelujah and then we forget the travail because of who we see and if you've got things that are troubling you and pressing on you and the world and all of its all of its issues just remember you have access amen [Music] you have access as a believer that you can channel into that will cause this to vanish away Hallelujah doesn't mean that it's not there but you see something that's beyond that Hallelujah God bless you let's stand shall we I trust that you've been affected by the message but I would like you to be sufficiently I would like to hear a testimony I've gone from this place you know it affected my life to a to the degree God spoke to me God impressed me and now I'm letting that imprint my life Hallelujah the Seal of God the Seal of the Holy Spirit heavenly father I pray for the people that have S so attentively they've sat so patiently and they listened and they were were so alert and saying amen and and accepting and receiving of your word I have waited before you oh God and labored just Desiring to know how you would bring this out and bring it to the people Lord I want to fulfill that part want to be able to stand one day before your messenger and say that one phrase I wonder if you're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and I want to say today is a testimony and let it go out into the airwaves let it go onto the internet let it go into the heavenlies I'm impressed with the word in our midst I'm impressed with the people of God I'm impressed with the bride of Jesus Christ who is word of his word and breath of his breath and she's bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh oh God Bless The Bride of Jesus Christ wherever they're meeting today Lord and wherever they are around the world brother dooka today fathers in the midst of
