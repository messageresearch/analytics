[1:35] that are connected with us by way of the
[1:37] internet, we certainly want to make them
[1:39] feel welcome tonight. But the main thing
[1:42] is the main thing and that's him coming
[1:45] down and speaking to our hearts.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in a personal savior.
[1:50] We believe in a personal God. He doesn't
[1:52] just meet you once. He sticks with you.

[1:57] friend, closer than a mom or a dad. He's
[2:01] there. Amen. God bless you this evening.
[2:04] Why don't we sing It's Camp Time.
[2:08] We're on day number one, but that
[2:11] actually equals four. It's different
[2:14] math than maybe you're used to. They
[2:16] might teach you in school, but we're
[2:17] going to count down because we've got
[2:19] four days to be here and worship the
[2:21] Lord. So, let's sing. It's camp time
[2:23] together. It's number 307 on the screen.

[2:31] to seek the Lord.

[2:38] study God's word.

[2:46] for Jesus and turn from the wrong. Glad
[2:49] I be where I belong.

[3:18] glad I'm here. I belong.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[3:29] All right. Well, I expect the enthusiasm
[3:33] to be at a certain level tonight. So,
[3:35] tomorrow night, we expect that to come
[3:37] up a notch.

[3:54] name. All praise to him who reigns

[12:15] Lord Jesus
[12:16] &gt;&gt; is faithful to come and speak
[12:19] &gt;&gt; his word directly to our hearts tonight?
[12:21] Why don't we pray together? Father,
[12:23] we're opening this service, Lord, with
[12:25] open hearts.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, with open minds,
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want the bars of Satan to be
[12:31] broken down this evening. Any wall of
[12:33] partition, Lord, that would stand
[12:35] between God and man, Lord, we're
[12:37] depending upon you, the Holy Spirit to
[12:40] come and break those bars this evening.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, loose any prisoner, Lord, that
[12:44] would be behind those prison bars. Lord,
[12:47] THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY FREE, ALREADY
[12:50] SOARING IN THE HEAVENLIES, LORD, would
[12:51] you come AND VISIT THEM,
[12:53] &gt;&gt; LORD? GIVE THEM A SPECIAL ANOINTING this
[12:55] evening to fly in your presence, OH GOD,
[12:59] TO STRETCH OUT their wings of faith,
[13:01] Lord, that they might FEEL THE POWER OF
[13:03] GOD SURGING
[13:05] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THEIR WINGS ONE MORE TIME, OH
[13:07] GOD. LORD, there's seasoned ones among
[13:09] us, Lord. We pray that you would help
[13:11] them to pull UPON THE GIFT OF GOD. LORD,
[13:14] there's ones that are just stepping into
[13:16] the way. Lord, even as Christian walked
[13:19] in the way in Pilgrim's Progress, Lord,
[13:21] we're just desiring that you would come
[13:23] and slip alongside,
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Lord. Lift them up onto higher plains,
[13:28] Lord, onto higher ground. Help them to
[13:30] recognize their condition, Lord, is not
[13:33] earthly, Lord, but their position is
[13:35] heavenly.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you come and speak through
[13:37] our brother Ron Spencer this evening,
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Lord? Take the gift of God that is
[13:42] placed within the man MAY HE STEP ASIDE
[13:45] AND MAY THE HOLY Ghost
[13:47] &gt;&gt; speak to our hearts, Lord. Even thoughts
[13:49] that we've thought today, Lord.
[13:51] Scriptures that we've been pondering,
[13:52] Lord, would you come and open your word
[13:54] one more time? We'll be sure to give you
[13:57] all the praise and the honor and the
[13:59] glory. For surely you are a personal
[14:01] God.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; For surely you will come and meet your
[14:04] people one more time. For we have
[14:06] gathered in your name, in the lovely
[14:09] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, if
[14:11] there's any sick among us, we rebuke the
[14:14] spirit of sickness,
[14:15] &gt;&gt; whatever it be, Lord,
[14:17] &gt;&gt; by the preaching of your word, we
[14:19] believe that the sick can be healed and
[14:21] will be healed this evening. We claim it
[14:23] and believe it in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Say, "Love the
[14:28] Lord."
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Why don't

[30:53] &gt;&gt; The Church of the Living God said,
[30:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's happy to be here tonight?
[30:59] I am too. Praise the Lord. Nice to see
[31:02] you all here. I think we're going to
[31:03] need a little bit um some trouble on
[31:06] that rather than base.
[31:09] We welcome you
[31:11] away
[31:13] camp 2017. Each that have made it, we
[31:17] feel honored that you're here. From the
[31:19] youngest to the oldest, from as far away
[31:22] as Europe, all the way across Canada.
[31:25] God bless you. The bride is indeed
[31:28] coming together.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; This could be the very last camp we'll
[31:32] ever see.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be marvelous?
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Just think that God has waited for all
[31:37] this time. I see the uh Marian and
[31:40] Michael's sons up here and brother Ed
[31:42] Hammermeers boys up here. I knew them
[31:45] when they were that small.
[31:48] I'm getting scared.
[31:50] Time is going on, but we're ready for
[31:53] one thing. We're ready for a change.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; We're ready for rapture.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; That's what the camp's all about, young
[32:00] people. To catch the vision of why God
[32:03] has called us and where we are going.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; We feel very privileged and honored to
[32:08] have brother Ron Spencer here at this
[32:11] camp to be our speaker. Brother Ron is
[32:14] from Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle
[32:17] in Elton, Virginia. That's a mouthful.
[32:22] He's a wonderful friend of mine, a
[32:24] wonderful man of God, and we feel
[32:26] honored to have brother Ron for him
[32:28] accepting our invitation to have Sister
[32:30] Connie here as dear wife. We thank God
[32:33] for their lives and what they've meant
[32:34] to all of us over the years. We can go
[32:38] back to many camps where God has moved
[32:40] on our behalf and we want to give God
[32:43] the glory and we want to say, "Lord, one
[32:46] more time, would you move?"
[32:48] &gt;&gt; We're not coming here to see a minister.
[32:50] minister, you've come here to pull on
[32:52] the gift of God,
[32:53] &gt;&gt; and we want to see God move. I don't
[32:55] want you looking around the tent. I want
[32:57] you to be focused on the word of God and
[32:59] what the man of God, what God has laid
[33:01] upon his heart.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning, we have our brother
[33:05] David Mayor all the way from
[33:07] Switzerland. Brother David, Sister Anne,
[33:09] would you stand please? Brother David
[33:11] will be taking the morning devotion. We
[33:14] feel privileged to have you here. God
[33:16] bless you. We're looking forward to it.
[33:25] Glory.
[33:27] I don't know how come brother Derek
[33:28] welcomed me. I've been a fixture here
[33:31] for 32 years at every camp. Just a
[33:34] fixture. And I feel privileged to be
[33:36] able to be a part of it. And it doesn't
[33:39] happen by one man. It happens with a
[33:42] group of people that have a vision and
[33:45] the mommies and the daddies and the
[33:47] sacrifice that you have made. But there
[33:50] is a guest that's not here tonight. Our
[33:53] pastor, Brother Ed and Sister Ruth, we
[33:57] want to welcome you on the internet. We
[34:00] want to show you our love and your
[34:03] appreciation for your vision to have
[34:06] this camera.
[34:14] Praise God. I think you can say
[34:17] hallelujah.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; PRAISE OUR GOD. WHERE WOULD WE BE IF GOD
[34:21] WOULDN'T COME IN A CAMP LIKE THIS? Move
[34:24] on our children's behalf and move on our
[34:26] behalf. Brother Biscll, Sister Biscll,
[34:28] we can't thank you enough.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; We can't thank you enough.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; And that's not raising up a man. That's
[34:35] recognizing the gift. And he's a man of
[34:38] God whether anybody likes it or not. And
[34:40] I'll stand behind him. I have these many
[34:43] years and I know you do, too.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[34:48] Ed and Sister Ruth.
[34:51] Our lovely Lord Jesus is here, too.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I know he's here.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; I know he's here.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you. I don't know
[35:02] what God's going to do the first night,
[35:04] but I'm expecting the unexpected. Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting God to do exceedingly
[35:10] abundantly. I don't even know if there's
[35:11] going to be a Sunday.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; That's my expectation. May God use
[35:16] Brother Ron Spencer in a supernatural
[35:19] way. Let's go throw away our
[35:21] churchianity. We've come to camp. WE'VE
[35:24] COME TO HEAR FROM GOD.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what camp's all about,
[35:28] isn't it? We can have fellowship one
[35:30] another. We can go off the grounds and
[35:32] praising God. Nobody has to tell us what
[35:35] to do except you got to listen to me.
[35:39] But isn't that marvelous that we can
[35:41] concentrate now fully God has given us
[35:44] now from now to Sunday to keep our minds
[35:48] focused on thus sayeth the Lord
[35:51] &gt;&gt; on the word of God. We want to welcome
[35:53] all those on the internet around the
[35:55] world on those that will be on the
[35:56] archives. May the Holy Spirit bless you
[35:59] as he has blessed us already in this
[36:02] service. I want the campers to realize
[36:06] the camp does not happen just to happen.
[36:09] We want to be able to we'll be taking up
[36:11] offerings every night and that will be
[36:14] for uh love offering to our our precious
[36:17] brother Ron and for expenses. So don't
[36:20] this is this don't get seized up. I'll
[36:23] tell you what, if if we were like our
[36:26] pastor,
[36:28] we would be a very given church. And you
[36:30] are a given church. And young people,
[36:32] you need to grow up into that. So, we
[36:35] want you to expect that. I see those
[36:37] three and $4 coffees.
[36:40] Throw them down a double makiato. I
[36:43] don't even know what if I'm even saying
[36:44] it right. Makiatta. Whatever. We can buy
[36:47] a coffee. We can give offerings to God
[36:49] and watch God come down.
[36:54] It's warm.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Anybody told you that lately?
[37:01] &gt;&gt; It's warm and I understand that it's
[37:03] warm and we were we're going to have
[37:05] water stations outside uh the tents
[37:08] coming into the camp or into the tent. I
[37:11] would like you if you feel that at all
[37:13] you're dehydrated at all, please take
[37:16] your water before you come in into the
[37:19] service.
[37:21] And I'm 63 years old.
[37:25] I've never left church for a drink of
[37:27] water.
[37:29] I've preached in the hottest places
[37:31] around the world.
[37:33] And I respect God that much that I don't
[37:37] want to interrupt the moving of the Holy
[37:39] Spirit. And so you can think the devil
[37:42] just said, "You're thirsty." Of course,
[37:43] we're all thirsty. And especially when
[37:45] brother Ron takes a drink, you'll be
[37:47] more thirsty.
[37:51] Get over it.
[37:53] We have come to meet with God.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And so we want the least amount of
[37:58] movement as possible. God bless you
[38:00] young people. You've had a blessed day
[38:02] today. You will tomorrow. And we just
[38:05] want you to have the most glorious camp
[38:07] you've ever had. But we have come to
[38:10] meet with Christ.
[38:13] And so we want to thank God once again.
[38:15] We want to welcome brother Ron Spencer
[38:18] to the pulpit. And we just ask God to
[38:21] have his will and his way. Let's all
[38:24] stand as we welcome brother Spencer, my
[38:27] friend,
[38:29] minister of the gospel.
[38:32] I'm amazed that you love me.
[38:38] Well, I'm amazed
[38:42] that you love me.
[38:47] I'm amazed
[38:51] how you
[38:55] preious
[38:58] I found you.
[39:02] And I see
[39:03] &gt;&gt; I see the world are all washed away. All
[39:10] I see.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just lift your hands to
[39:12] him? Why don't you tell him?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm amazed. Oh, I'm amazed.
[39:22] You love me.
[39:25] I'm amazed.
[39:29] I
[39:34] preface.
[40:03] I
[40:11] to your preious
[40:15] I
[40:19] sash
[40:24] away all my sins.
[40:35] God bless you.
[40:38] Amen. Certainly good to be with you and
[40:41] certainly thank you for all that you
[40:44] have done for me. So good to see each
[40:47] and every one of you friends from a lot
[40:49] of places.
[40:51] We I appreciate what brother Tom said
[40:54] about brother Ed. Brother Ed is a dear
[40:56] friend of ours and he's been a a legend
[40:59] and a hero in our lives for way long
[41:02] time
[41:04] &gt;&gt; and u the first time I ever met brother
[41:06] Tom was in Murphy'sboro Tennessee and he
[41:12] was there to be with brother Ed in the
[41:14] meetings and I had red hair then and uh
[41:19] so that's been a few days ago
[41:22] we thankful to have sister Connie with
[41:25] and we're just honored to have her. I
[41:28] see some Edmonton faces that that was at
[41:31] Edmonton last week and we had a
[41:33] wonderful meeting there and uh good to
[41:37] have brother David Mayor with us and and
[41:40] that Switzerland attraction and so we're
[41:43] so glad that that to hear from him this
[41:46] week. We love you with all of our
[41:48] hearts.
[41:51] I happen to believe that God is going to
[41:54] do some incredible things.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I I just I just I just believe that with
[42:00] all my heart. I believe that the same
[42:03] God,
[42:06] the same God that many years ago when I
[42:10] brought my son Andrew and Matthew, my
[42:14] daughter Whitney to this meeting, Andrew
[42:17] was a boy that was just floating along.
[42:21] And in his floating along, he he had
[42:24] become married and he'd been raised
[42:27] right. He had heard the message of the
[42:29] hour.
[42:31] He never missed a service,
[42:34] but he was the kind of young man that
[42:36] had different draw. He just didn't have
[42:38] that it.
[42:40] He came to this meeting and his wife,
[42:43] they they were kind of a fixture about
[42:46] where Sister Connie would be in that in
[42:49] that tent setting.
[42:51] And as the meeting would go on, there'd
[42:54] be something things begin to take place.
[42:58] I believe it was on Monday after that
[43:01] meeting. Maybe I've got that date wrong,
[43:03] but on Monday after that meeting, we
[43:06] were to take a day off.
[43:09] And that day, Brother Joel Ray,
[43:12] God would come and supernaturally
[43:16] in just a matter of a few moments
[43:17] changed his life.
[43:20] And I would hold that very dear to my
[43:22] heart. And and uh and a couple hours
[43:25] later, we were standing and I was
[43:28] standing in the street and I looked down
[43:30] the street and there stood Brother Tom
[43:32] Ray with Brother Andrew.
[43:39] God supernaturally
[43:42] touched that young man.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take four services.
[43:51] It doesn't take a lifetime of trying to
[43:53] get it figured out.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; He can come to your pew even right now.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And all the questions and all of the
[44:04] struggles that you have been fighting
[44:06] through,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; maybe even today or this week or this
[44:10] year,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; and you've come to the end of your rope,
[44:14] I want to tell you tonight, you're not
[44:16] the one that's hanging on.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; God is determined to have his seed.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; That's what this meeting is all about.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; God is after his seed.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly where you're at.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; And he's not embarrassed.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And in just a moment, I believe that he
[44:41] can touch your life.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; That's why this meeting means more than
[44:46] life to me. because I've seen him
[44:50] &gt;&gt; so many times.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't have to beg him to come.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I want to see
[44:59] something supernaturally, just look
[45:01] around.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; He's here."
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you see him by your your
[45:08] eye or why are there you feel him by
[45:11] your fleshly senses. I want you to
[45:14] become aware
[45:15] &gt;&gt; that he the unseen guest is in the
[45:18] building.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Now I just have one request to you just
[45:22] before we would go to prayer. I want you
[45:25] to invite him just now.
[45:29] I want you to invite him.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; So many times we want our favorite
[45:34] preacher to to invite him.
[45:38] But I want you to invite him. I want you
[45:41] to personally invite him to where you're
[45:45] at. Let's pray.
[45:51] Almighty God,
[45:55] just now I stand behind this sacred desk
[46:01] and only eternity will tell us
[46:06] what has happened in this meeting
[46:09] and what will happen even this week.
[46:14] Lord, I stop to give you thanks for
[46:16] Brother Ed Biscll
[46:18] and all of his incredible work,
[46:23] his vision,
[46:25] his mission.
[46:28] Lord, for the team that has been
[46:31] impacted
[46:33] by Jesus.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may the Jesus that he met
[46:42] come in this building.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; We thank you for every worker that has
[46:49] that has put in untold hours
[46:53] untold hours to prepare this.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Lord Jesus,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us just now to get ourselves
[47:01] out of the way
[47:03] &gt;&gt; that we don't miss you passing by.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're more than our favorite
[47:08] preacher's voice.
[47:11] Lord, you're more than the entertainment
[47:13] of song or even a the preacher saying
[47:16] certain words, but I pray just now that
[47:19] you would come to every heart,
[47:22] &gt;&gt; not just in this tent, but around the
[47:25] world. Father,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; oh God, I ask you to ignite my my lips
[47:30] and anoint our hearts.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you even as this meeting
[47:35] progresses, strengthen our vocal cords.
[47:38] Yes,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; the enemy would like to stress those and
[47:42] cause them to deteriorate.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; But I believe in a God that you can give
[47:46] us favor
[47:48] &gt;&gt; till they would even strengthen as the
[47:50] weak goes.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; And at the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, WE BIND
[47:56] every enemy
[47:58] &gt;&gt; that would try to block the visitation
[48:01] of God.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you'd come among us
[48:05] in a mighty way, oh God.
[48:08] Lord, we sense your presence even now.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Now we ask you to take these words of
[48:15] eternal life and let it live in our
[48:18] hearts.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; May we be faithful representatives of
[48:22] your gospel. Help us this afternoon. We
[48:25] pray
[48:26] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We ask you.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And an amen and amen. Amen. Thank
[48:34] you. Thank you for your patience with
[48:35] me. I'm from the south and it takes us a
[48:38] long time to just say hello.
[48:41] If you will turn with me to John chapter
[48:44] 4 and verse 6.
[48:50] Certainly love you. Certainly hope that
[48:52] we can shake your hand before this
[48:55] meeting is over and and uh spend a
[48:59] moment with you. But if I don't get the
[49:00] chance to in eternity,
[49:04] we'll sit down and talk it all over with
[49:06] you. Amen. We love you. John chapter 4
[49:10] and verse 6. I want to speak tonight if
[49:13] the Lord can help me, and I know he
[49:14] will, on a new identity.
[49:21] John chapter 4 and verse six.
[49:25] Now, Jacob's well was there. Jesus
[49:29] therefore being wearied with his
[49:31] journey,
[49:33] set thus on the well, and it was about
[49:35] the sixth hour, and there cometh a woman
[49:39] of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus sth
[49:43] unto her, Give me to drink.
[49:47] For his disciples were gone away into
[49:49] the city to buy meat. And then saith the
[49:52] woman of Samaria unto him, How is it
[49:56] that thou being a Jew,
[50:00] askketh drink of me, which am a woman of
[50:04] Samaria?
[50:06] For the Jews have no dealings with the
[50:09] Samaritans.
[50:11] And Jesus answered and said unto her, If
[50:16] thou kneest.
[50:18] I'd like for you to just look at those
[50:19] words. If thou kneest
[50:22] the gift of God, and who is this that
[50:26] saith to thee, give me to drink? Thou
[50:29] wouldest ask of him, and he would have
[50:33] given thee living water. You may be
[50:36] seated.
[50:41] Is that okay?
[50:48] Hallelujah.
[50:51] Hallelujah.
[50:54] We live in a world that
[50:57] it tells us in Leotaa to discover
[51:00] ourself.
[51:02] Tells us that we should explore so many
[51:04] things and not be held back or
[51:09] restricted from anything. Here was a
[51:12] woman that that was coming to the well
[51:15] today and her past was quite a story.
[51:20] Every one of us have a story here today.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of us has has a story and
[51:26] sometimes our story is much like the
[51:29] scriptures.
[51:30] There are individuals in the scriptures
[51:33] that maybe just one word is said about
[51:37] them. one word in the entire scripture.
[51:41] But I have to say you this to you that
[51:43] would be a cite quite an honor
[51:46] that your name be written in the sacred
[51:50] writings of God.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And by revelation we realize that our
[51:56] names are written there.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of them have maybe a sentence
[52:02] &gt;&gt; that is written about them.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Some a few scriptures. Some will be
[52:08] chapters and maybe even books,
[52:12] men like Abraham,
[52:15] Moses,
[52:17] they will they will have an innumerable
[52:19] amount of scriptures that will be
[52:21] written about them. David,
[52:25] some of those scriptures are very
[52:27] complimentary, if we could say it,
[52:29] complimentary to them of their lives.
[52:32] But there are or other portions that
[52:34] maybe if they were able to to be in
[52:39] control of the writings, they might say,
[52:41] "I I would rather that that's not
[52:44] written there."
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Because being human beings, we we can
[52:49] look in the mirror. There's some things
[52:51] that we're disappointed about oursel. I
[52:55] sat beside behind a young man last night
[52:57] in service and I looked over at my wife
[53:00] and I said, "You know, that young man is
[53:03] probably was probably taller than me at
[53:06] his birth."
[53:13] You know, if I'd have had some control
[53:15] over it, I I would have liked to been
[53:17] just a bit taller. There's some things I
[53:20] can't reach. There were times in the
[53:23] services last night, there was times I
[53:25] couldn't see.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; There's things about us we would all
[53:33] like to change about oursel.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; But you see, we were not in control of
[53:38] that.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; God knew what he wanted and how he
[53:44] wanted us to look.
[53:46] And maybe tonight you're sitting here,
[53:48] you're thinking, "Well, you know,
[53:49] Brother Ron, I I've been invited to this
[53:52] meeting. I've came to this meeting. I've
[53:54] been raised up in church and and I've
[53:57] said as a family member of the church
[53:59] and, you know, maybe I'm a new I'm a new
[54:02] person in the congregation and and you
[54:05] know, God's never did anything for me
[54:07] and I've never seen anything great. I I
[54:10] hear the stories and you know the
[54:13] stories that are just that that are so
[54:15] familiar to me, but there's really no
[54:17] reality. I want to remind you just to
[54:20] get you here is a great big deal.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You see, God pre-planned you before the
[54:26] foundation of the world. Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And he knew when you would be born and
[54:32] what you would look like and how long
[54:35] your nose would be and what color eyes
[54:38] that you would have and your height and
[54:40] your stature. He even knew the
[54:42] weaknesses that you would struggle with
[54:45] all of your life.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; He knew all of that. He knew the choices
[54:50] that you would make.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; But he did not predestinate you on your
[54:55] choices.
[54:57] He elected you on his choice.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; And when he thought of you before the
[55:03] foundation of the world, God is an
[55:05] infinite God.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know about time. And and time
[55:10] doesn't make a whole lot of difference
[55:12] to him. You see, God thought of you in
[55:15] the eternities. So if he ever thought of
[55:19] you,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; you are as eternal as Jesus Christ is.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand tonight, it
[55:30] isn't you that was seeking for God.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; You were born in your family. You took
[55:37] on your family's nature. Some of those
[55:40] things you're very proud of. Some of
[55:42] them you're not so proud of. Brother
[55:44] Random talks about his own mother and
[55:46] father Charles and and Ella Brandham and
[55:49] he he says you know uh at one place he
[55:52] said you know he said I have a I have a
[55:55] a a earthly mother and father he says
[55:58] but there's some things I'm not so proud
[56:00] of but I'm real proud of my heavenly
[56:02] father
[56:07] &gt;&gt; you know he even fought some of the
[56:09] things that they handed him in their
[56:11] personal DNA
[56:13] &gt;&gt; as it came through their natural
[56:15] lineage. There was things that he had to
[56:17] struggle with all of his life and scars
[56:20] that he had to deal with.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WAS BIG enough
[56:26] &gt;&gt; to help him with every one of those
[56:28] things.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That same God has come to where you're
[56:32] at tonight. Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And so many times we look at our
[56:36] personal identification of maybe what
[56:38] our name is.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And we we we know our name because our
[56:42] mother told us our name. We know our
[56:45] name because it was rehearsed to us over
[56:47] and over again. And you're just thankful
[56:50] there's not 26 letters in your name.
[56:55] It would. And I apologize for those that
[56:58] are. I'm not throwing a stone.
[57:02] But you begin and you the governments
[57:04] begin to give you certain numbers that
[57:06] you go by. It is told to us that every
[57:09] one of us have a different fingerprint.
[57:12] Every one of us have a different image
[57:14] in our eye. Our eyes are different. Uh
[57:18] there we have a signature that we deal
[57:20] with. You see nobody is like you.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody else on the earth. Even if you
[57:30] have 14 identical twins or whatever you
[57:33] want to say, none of them are exactly
[57:36] like you.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; where you're at,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; and what your situations are.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; God comes seeking for you. You didn't go
[57:53] seeking for him.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me just now? Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; In the scriptures, we we read about a
[58:00] man that was named and literally the
[58:04] scriptures even identify him
[58:06] &gt;&gt; as blind Barabus.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; You see, there's many characters in the
[58:11] scriptures that will tell us of Rahab
[58:14] the harlot.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; You understand the names identified who
[58:19] they were and their old book told us a
[58:23] lot of things about their THEIR
[58:25] LIFESTYLE.
[58:27] BLIND Barameus it's very easy to
[58:30] understand that that he he had grew and
[58:33] he had become accustomed THAT THIS WAS
[58:34] HIS LIFESTYLE. Now understand his
[58:37] community realized
[58:39] that he was the blind man that was in
[58:42] the city.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; He was the man that other people looked
[58:45] out for. He was a man that was he was
[58:49] they that they had become accustomed to.
[58:51] He was blind. They had become to the
[58:54] that this is just life. children would
[58:56] grow up and understand that's blind
[58:58] Barameus.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Blind Barnameus always would have
[59:01] someone that no doubt that would lead
[59:03] him to the place to where he begged for
[59:06] umps or where that he stood every day.
[59:09] But I want you to understand WHEN HE WAS
[59:11] JUST A CHILD,
[59:14] only a prophet OF GOD WOULD LOOK BACK IN
[59:16] THIS day and begin to tell a story about
[59:18] blind Barnameus and tell us that when he
[59:20] was a child,
[59:23] &gt;&gt; THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD TAKE HIM UP ON HER
[59:25] LAP AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT JEHOVAH, GOD,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; a living God, a a God of reality.
[59:35] And though THE CIRCUMSTANCE BE AS
[59:38] DIFFICULT as he was, let me just
[59:41] understand that this today. His
[59:43] difficulty OF BLINDNESS DID NOT BOTHER
[59:48] GOD'S PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; God knew this was the condition that he
[59:53] would be born in. He knows your
[59:55] condition.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He knows your disease. He knows your
[1:00:00] genetic CODE THAT YOU FOUGHT THROUGH
[1:00:02] THROUGH YOUR LIFE.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How about I come unclipped there,
[1:00:07] Brother John?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; He knows all of those things in your
[1:00:10] life.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; God doesn't get nervous with that.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; God understands that.
[1:00:20] Today,
[1:00:21] blind Barnameus would be standing.
[1:00:25] He'd be standing at his place.
[1:00:28] Brother Brandon said it was kind of a
[1:00:30] chilly day. That's not here tonight.
[1:00:34] It was kind of a chilly day. And so he
[1:00:36] backed up against the wall to warm
[1:00:38] himself in the presence of the sun.
[1:00:43] And he said there was there was some
[1:00:45] noise that was coming. Wherever Jesus
[1:00:48] is, is always a lot of noise.
[1:00:51] And so and so
[1:00:55] Bardameus that morning was thinking
[1:00:57] about what his mother taught him.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And she WAS THINKING HE WAS THINKING
[1:01:02] ABOUT HOW THAT HE TOLD SHE TOLD HIM OF
[1:01:05] all the prophets
[1:01:07] told him all the the things of the
[1:01:09] miracles. She rehearsed these things in
[1:01:12] his ears.
[1:01:14] Today he would hear some miracles coming
[1:01:17] up the way. NOW YOU SEE HIS PAST life
[1:01:21] had a lot of restrictions.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; But after HE WOULD LEAVE THE WALL TODAY,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; he would no longer be known as blind
[1:01:35] Barameus.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; He would GET A NEW IDENTITY TODAY. AMEN.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; This woman that WE JUST READ TO YOU
[1:01:50] ABOUT WAS A HARLOT.
[1:01:53] She came to the well only at this time
[1:01:56] of day.
[1:01:58] I find it absolutely interesting that
[1:02:00] that our prophet would talk about her
[1:02:02] almost every service.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Almost every service he would begin to
[1:02:08] talk to about her. Maybe in the great
[1:02:11] eternity she might understand what
[1:02:13] really happened to her on that day. But
[1:02:16] you see, up until THIS POINT, SHE
[1:02:19] STRUGGLED WITH THE circumstances of
[1:02:21] life.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; She had a weakness with men that that
[1:02:27] there WAS NOTHING ABOUT SIN could quench
[1:02:30] the thirst that she had.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Let me JUST SAY THAT HER BOOK
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; had a lot of scars in it.
[1:02:38] It had an incredible amount of
[1:02:40] difficulties in it. MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING
[1:02:42] HERE TONIGHT AND SAID, "BROTHER RON, YOU
[1:02:44] JUST DON'T KNOW MY STORY." I DON'T, BUT
[1:02:46] HE DOES.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU BROUGHT SOME EXCUSES to
[1:02:52] the tent. And let me just say this. I
[1:02:53] may not be talking TO ANYBODY HERE, BUT
[1:02:55] I BELIEVE I am. I'm talking to somebody.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; This little woman had great difficulty
[1:03:04] in her life.
[1:03:06] Now, let me just say, God deposited
[1:03:08] something on the inside of you,
[1:03:11] and you can try to drown it with all of
[1:03:14] sin's vices.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; You can try to drown it with SOME OF THE
[1:03:19] DRUGS and the sins and the the dope and
[1:03:22] and the world and its rock music and all
[1:03:25] of its nonsense and all of the education
[1:03:28] that you can get. BUT THERE'S JUST
[1:03:30] SOMETHING ABOUT A PREDESTINATED SEED.
[1:03:34] THERE'S A LONGING THAT'S INSIDE OF THERE
[1:03:37] THAT'S way beyond yourself.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And there's NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT
[1:03:43] WILL QUENCH THAT BUT HIM.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; There's nothing THAT WILL QUENCH THAT
[1:03:50] BUT HIM.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; NOW, LET ME JUST SAY SOME OF US are real
[1:03:53] good runners. We can run from God.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just SAY THIS. YOU GOD'S A
[1:03:59] VERY PATIENT GOD. HE KNOWS WHERE TO meet
[1:04:02] you at.
[1:04:08] This woman goes to the well. Well, Jesus
[1:04:11] understands the circumstances. He also
[1:04:14] understands humanity that would be
[1:04:15] around him.
[1:04:17] So, he sends the rest of the disciples
[1:04:19] away
[1:04:22] because they might have some some
[1:04:24] attitudes
[1:04:26] about this woman.
[1:04:29] But I want you to understand, God knows
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; and God is not ashamed.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, SATAN TRIES TO KILL, TO STEAL, and
[1:04:40] to destroy.
[1:04:41] And if there is a chance that there's a
[1:04:45] predestinated seed inside of there, he
[1:04:48] will try to take your first nature
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; and try to bury you
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; in SCARS AND EMOTIONS AND TURMOIL OF
[1:04:58] your life.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S A
[1:05:00] PRESENCE WITHIN this room tonight
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; THAT CAN WASH AWAY EVERY bit
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; of the enemy's destruction.
[1:05:15] This woman would leave her house
[1:05:18] known as the harlot.
[1:05:21] BUT PASTOR JESUS WOULD COME BY.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Pastor Jesus would come by if we could
[1:05:28] say this.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And this is a woman that's going to be
[1:05:32] represented in his church. NOW
[1:05:35] UNDERSTAND, GOD KNOWS what's going to
[1:05:37] happen in this tent tonight.
[1:05:43] This is not news to God.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He's only been waiting for you to come
[1:05:48] to your position.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You see, he was here way BEFORE YOU
[1:05:55] ARRIVED IN your seat.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; He knew the color of shirt, the color of
[1:05:59] dress that you would have on, how your
[1:06:01] HAIR WOULD BE DONE. HE KNEW HOW your
[1:06:04] attitude would be. He was just waiting
[1:06:07] on you to arrive.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to UNDERSTAND THIS IS WAY
[1:06:14] BEYOND HUMANITY. This is way BEYOND
[1:06:17] GIFTS OF PREACHING. THIS IS GOD IN
[1:06:20] ACTION.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS how to find you.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I can just see Jesus's eyes as she
[1:06:31] begins to arrive at the well.
[1:06:35] You see, he knows.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He's been sent here on a mission.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; He's watching.
[1:06:43] He's watching her. And he begins to talk
[1:06:46] to her and she begins to shrug him off.
[1:06:49] How many times have we shrugged him off
[1:06:51] before?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; How many times we've sat through
[1:06:56] meetings?
[1:06:58] How many times that we've listened to
[1:07:00] our pastors preach to us
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; and literally give portions of their
[1:07:05] lives and we SAT THERE AND SHRUGGED IT
[1:07:08] OFF.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; WE JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF ANOTHER NIGHT.
[1:07:12] WE SHRUGGED IT OFF another night and we
[1:07:14] ONLY INCREASE THE paperwork
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; of our old life.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; We only increase the turmoil that's
[1:07:22] happened in our lives.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; What's going to fix me? LET ME JUST SAY
[1:07:26] A LIBRARY BOOK OR A BOOK AT BARNES &
[1:07:28] NOBLE, A BOOK OFF OF AMAZON OF OF
[1:07:31] SELF-HELP, THAT WILL NOT FIX YOU.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That will not fix you. WELL, HOW LONG
[1:07:38] DOES IT TAKE? A matter of a few moments
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; and he begins to talk to her and he
[1:07:49] picks up her weakness. And he begins to
[1:07:52] say some words, "Go get your husband."
[1:07:55] And she quickly responds, "I have none."
[1:07:59] You hear brother Brandham in this in the
[1:08:01] prayer lines. He begins to talk to
[1:08:04] people and he tells them, "Don't get
[1:08:06] nervous. There's something standing
[1:08:08] between you and I." You recognize that.
[1:08:10] Don't let that make you nervous. That's
[1:08:12] him.
[1:08:14] That's him.
[1:08:15] And you see, you can see it in deep.
[1:08:17] Call it through the deep. how how that
[1:08:20] people begin to react in that presence
[1:08:22] and then our prophet begins to tell them
[1:08:25] what their name is. Well, that shouldn't
[1:08:27] shock them though that they know that.
[1:08:30] Then he tells them their address.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Well, well, they know that. Then he
[1:08:36] begins to talk about and sometimes you
[1:08:37] can listen to him tell them between 14
[1:08:42] up to 20ome different things that are
[1:08:45] about them
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; to increase their faith
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; that they recognize they're standing in
[1:08:52] more than the presence of a man.
[1:08:57] And if you're careful tonight, God will
[1:08:59] take his his anointed word of God and
[1:09:03] begin TO TELL YOU NOT JUST ONE THING
[1:09:05] ABOUT YOURSELF, BUT HE'LL TELL YOU
[1:09:08] MULTIPLE things about yourself. Even to
[1:09:11] the POINT THAT YOU THINK SOMEBODY HAS
[1:09:13] WENT AND TOLD ON ME.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, IT'S NOT THE man that
[1:09:18] knows, it's the God that knows.
[1:09:23] And if you can ever get your turtle
[1:09:25] shell to kind of get loose a little bit
[1:09:28] and just realize that this IS GOD THAT
[1:09:30] IS TALKING to me
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; and this is an important meeting with
[1:09:35] God.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; For the patients on the prayer line,
[1:09:42] if they don't get what they need, many
[1:09:44] of them are going to die.
[1:09:46] the cancer that they've walked to the to
[1:09:48] the to the platform with that cancer
[1:09:51] will eat them up.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And if they don't touch Jesus
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and if their faith doesn't arise,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; they they can have thus sayeth THE LORD
[1:10:00] SET OVER THEM multiple times, but if
[1:10:03] their faith don't arise to the challenge
[1:10:05] of the hour and they MISS JESUS CHRIST,
[1:10:08] THEY'LL ONLY GO HOME AND DIE. OH, IF
[1:10:10] YOUR FAITH CAN'T ARISE TONIGHT. YES,
[1:10:12] SIR.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; OH, IF YOU CAN GET BEYOND YOURSELF AND
[1:10:16] REALIZE HE'S HERE TO MEET YOUR NEED.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; He's here to call your name. He knows
[1:10:24] where YOU LIVE AT. HE KNOWS THE TURMOIL
[1:10:26] THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; You do not HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS
[1:10:31] RAHAB THE HARLOT.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You do not HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS
[1:10:36] JACOB.
[1:10:39] HE'S HERE TO MEET YOU AND TRANSFORM your
[1:10:42] life.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Random tells about a place that
[1:10:49] he read that there was a man
[1:10:52] and the religions of the world had
[1:10:54] gathered together,
[1:10:57] Buddhist, Muhammad
[1:11:00] amongst many other religions.
[1:11:03] They each gave their their speech of of
[1:11:06] what they their gods was and the power
[1:11:09] of him. And this man stood to his feet
[1:11:14] and he began to present them a story of
[1:11:16] of Lady Makabe.
[1:11:19] She came from Oklahoma. She lived during
[1:11:22] the days of of of of wagons and horses.
[1:11:26] And she had been identified as a
[1:11:28] murderer. And she had been identified as
[1:11:30] a very bad woman.
[1:11:33] They would even want to tarn and feather
[1:11:35] this woman and they would even want to
[1:11:37] refuse to even put their hands on her.
[1:11:41] He begin to present
[1:11:43] this horrible story of this life,
[1:11:48] this life. And he begins to tell them
[1:11:50] about this horrible story of life and
[1:11:53] how this woman has lived.
[1:11:56] HE BEGINS TO TELL THEM OF WHAT A
[1:11:59] DEGRADATION that sin has caused.
[1:12:02] And then he begins to challenge them.
[1:12:07] Which of your gods
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; which of your gods
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; can wash your hands
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; of all of our sin?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I realize I'm preaching to a to a
[1:12:22] congregation that is in the internet. I
[1:12:25] realize that there are believers that
[1:12:26] are listening and amening. Some of my
[1:12:29] favorite people are watching from a far
[1:12:32] distance, but I also realize some of my
[1:12:35] critics are.
[1:12:37] Some of Jesus CHRIST'S CRITICS ARE.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TONIGHT.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; WHICH OF YOUR GODS OF THEOLOGY?
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Which of your institutions OF
[1:12:52] SEMINARIES?
[1:12:55] WHICH OF YOUR GODS CAN COME AND CLEANSE
[1:12:58] HEARTS AND transform souls?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT TO PUT SOME BOUNDARIES HERE.
[1:13:04] I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT a learn behavior.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A YESTERDAY'S
[1:13:14] DOCTRINE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:13:16] TRANSFORMING OF A NEW LIFE
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; WHERE A DROP OF INK CAN GO DOWN INSIDE
[1:13:20] OF A BLEACH.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND GOD CAN TRANSFORM YOU FROM
[1:13:25] A FROM AN OLD FILTHY HABITS AND
[1:13:28] TRANSFORM YOU AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN THE
[1:13:31] SAME ANYMORE.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Now I want to SAY THIS TO YOU. MY GOD
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; I want to JUST TELL YOU MY GOD, YOU
[1:13:48] DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALCOHOLIC
[1:13:49] SYNONYMOUS.
[1:13:51] You don't have to go who through a rehab
[1:13:53] center.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO SIT FOR 45 years
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and GO THROUGH A COUNSEL SESSION EVERY
[1:14:03] WEEK OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; BUT MY GOD CAN CLEANSE YOUR habits
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; and cleanse your lifestyle.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And literally IN ONE AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:14:13] WITH HIM,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE
[1:14:18] FIRST PLACE.
[1:14:24] BUT MY FRIENDS, BROTHER, ANYBODY THAT
[1:14:27] TAKES YOU AWAY FROM JESUS CHRIST
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; is not your friend.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM
[1:14:36] GOD IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I've had a lot of friends, a lot
[1:14:47] of associates, a lot of businessmen, a
[1:14:49] lot of people around me that have been
[1:14:50] my my friends, friends that that I that
[1:14:55] I have to occupy this this world with.
[1:14:58] But you see, WE'RE ON TWO DIFFERENT
[1:14:59] COURSES.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I may have to live in THIS WORLD, BUT
[1:15:04] I'M NOT OF THIS WORLD.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; AND I REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T me giving
[1:15:09] up my friends. My friends got rid of me.
[1:15:16] I realized when I WENT TO A SERVICE LIKE
[1:15:20] TONIGHT,
[1:15:24] my grandmother,
[1:15:26] who had read about everything at print
[1:15:29] at that time,
[1:15:31] she was in her 60s.
[1:15:35] She could outcurse most sailors. Forgive
[1:15:37] me if I have to tell you that.
[1:15:40] She was a hightempered woman. She was a
[1:15:44] stubborn individual, but she had been a
[1:15:47] a supervisor of a major manufacturer for
[1:15:50] many, many years.
[1:15:53] I'd lived a horrible life at that point.
[1:15:57] For some reason, only God knows
[1:16:02] that evening there was going to be a
[1:16:04] weekend special services. And that
[1:16:06] evening, I looked at her and I told her,
[1:16:08] "I'll go if you'll go.
[1:16:16] Now, I'd heard a lot of incredible
[1:16:18] preaching.
[1:16:19] Your pastor had preached to me before as
[1:16:21] a boy. I'd enjoyed his his preaching.
[1:16:25] And of all of the men that that I heard
[1:16:28] preach as a boy, he's the one that I
[1:16:30] remembered.
[1:16:33] And
[1:16:34] I did a lot of bad things. And I don't
[1:16:36] want to go into it tonight, but I'd
[1:16:38] wound up homeless. I'd wound up in
[1:16:39] drugs.
[1:16:41] But here I have returned home.
[1:16:45] When I saw a play this week about
[1:16:47] returning home, would my family receive
[1:16:49] me?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; You see, I knew what was real.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I knew what was real. I'd been raised in
[1:16:57] that which was real.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I went home and was living with my
[1:17:02] grandmother and
[1:17:04] I told her, I said, "I'll go to church
[1:17:06] if you'll go." I never expected her to
[1:17:07] go. She went,
[1:17:12] SHE SAT ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. I
[1:17:14] sat on the other side of the building.
[1:17:17] You see, I THOUGHT I'D DROP MY
[1:17:19] GRANDMOTHER OFF AND go to a party later
[1:17:21] that night. So, so I had picked up some
[1:17:24] alcohol and put it in the back of my
[1:17:25] car, and I was armed for battle.
[1:17:30] I had intentions of what I was going to
[1:17:32] do. I was going to satisfy my mother and
[1:17:34] father by coming to church and surprise
[1:17:36] them. I never thought my grandmother
[1:17:39] would COME. AND THERE WAS A service that
[1:17:40] was preached that night. I couldn't tell
[1:17:42] you what the sermon was, BUT ALL I KNOW
[1:17:45] WHO I MET IN that building.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Who I met in THAT BUILDING WAS MORE THAN
[1:17:52] MY DADDY OR MY mom or my fa the the
[1:17:54] speaker that would be there that night.
[1:17:56] I'd never hear him ever preach again.
[1:17:59] But but you see,
[1:18:02] I met him.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF FINDING THE DOOR TO LEAVE, I
[1:18:08] FOUND AN ALTAR.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; WHEN I FINISHED SOBBING MY WAY to
[1:18:14] Calvary,
[1:18:16] I looked to my right and there was my
[1:18:18] grandmother down at the altar.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; When we left that service, I MADE A STOP
[1:18:25] at a trash can.
[1:18:28] And I emptied that car.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You see, I didn't need that habit no
[1:18:36] more.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I didn't need those things no more.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Because he came in the room.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; If you could only identify the voice
[1:18:49] that is behind the voice.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; There was a man that could be maybe
[1:18:55] qualified as a believer.
[1:18:58] He'd even been with Jesus for for now
[1:19:01] over three years.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; This man had seen some incredible
[1:19:05] miracles.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; This man had been a participant in some
[1:19:10] phenomenal things. As a matter of fact,
[1:19:13] there was a revelation that was dropped
[1:19:15] into his heart that Jesus was the
[1:19:18] Christ.
[1:19:20] But you see, it would TAKE MORE THAN
[1:19:22] JUST BELIEVING.
[1:19:25] It would take more than just identify
[1:19:27] him as the Christ.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN JUST TELLING
[1:19:32] STORIES.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; You see, you see, we need MORE THAN JUST
[1:19:37] GOD TO ANOINT US.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; We need MORE THAN JUST TO COME INTO a
[1:19:42] meeting and and then continuously leave
[1:19:45] the same way. Right.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; We need more than just to be able to
[1:19:50] rehearse the stories of our pastor
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; and and brother Brandham stories.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; But we NEED TO HAVE THAT JESUS
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS LIVE in our lives
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; where IT BECOMES A PERSONAL TESTIMONY
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; OF WHAT THAT JESUS DOES FOR YOU.
[1:20:19] Jesus one day turned around to him and
[1:20:21] said,"Simon,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Simon,
[1:20:26] Satan hath desired to have you."
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; That he might sift you. Are you with me?
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; As wheat?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you tonight.
[1:20:40] I don't know your name, so I want you to
[1:20:43] just call your name right here.
[1:20:48] Run. Run.
[1:20:51] Audience participation will be real
[1:20:53] nice.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Run, run.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Behold,
[1:21:01] Satan has desired to have you.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Well, why would he want me?
[1:21:11] Now, LET'S JUST ASK A QUESTION. WHY
[1:21:13] WOULD HE WANT ME?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Why would he be giving me
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; RON SPENCER SUCH A HARD TIME
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; TO ENGULF ME IN DRUGS AND alcohol
[1:21:26] and the things of the world?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, SATAN DOESN'T HAVE FORESIGHT
[1:21:31] like God does.
[1:21:34] You see, GOD WOULD SEE US AS A PART OF
[1:21:37] THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD SEE US AS A PART OF THOUSANDS
[1:21:44] OF MIRACLES.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; SO, THERE'S JUST UNLIMITED POTENTIAL IN
[1:21:52] YOUR LIFE.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THAT OUGHT TO ME. THAT
[1:21:57] MAKES ME ALMOST feel like getting a
[1:21:59] little excited.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT KNOW OUR BEFORE.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; ALSO KNOWS OUR AFTER.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; NOW, you're sitting here and I don't
[1:22:14] know your ages. Wouldn't want to guess.
[1:22:16] I'm not good at it.
[1:22:19] and you're sitting here and and you say,
[1:22:20] "Well, Brother Ron, I'm I I'm a believer
[1:22:24] and I've been baptized in the name of
[1:22:26] the Lord Jesus Christ and I received the
[1:22:27] Holy Ghost." But it's more than just one
[1:22:30] feeling. It's many refillings.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Now, many sitting in this building has
[1:22:36] had great victories,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; incredible victories.
[1:22:41] I could stop and talk about brother
[1:22:43] Kelvin and Sister Melody
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; whom I've been a part of their lives for
[1:22:48] several years now
[1:22:51] and and I COULD STOP AND TALK ABOUT
[1:22:53] SEVERAL OF YOU.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Is Joel in the building? Joel here? I
[1:23:00] don't know. Well, I I don't either.
[1:23:05] Joel's wife's here.
[1:23:08] Now you're real real thankful. A name.
[1:23:11] What's her name?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Kim.
[1:23:14] Sorry, brother Glenn.
[1:23:18] Now,
[1:23:20] Sister Kim is thankful.
[1:23:23] She's thankful for the story of the
[1:23:26] before and the after.
[1:23:29] But you see, her life would have been
[1:23:32] much different.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Her life would have been
[1:23:38] much different had there not been a
[1:23:40] meeting.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME IN HIS
[1:23:47] LIFE.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; AND HIS HIS MOM AND DAD WERE DESPERATE.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter WHO HIS FATHER WAS AND
[1:23:55] mother was or his grandfather AND HIS
[1:23:56] GRANDMOTHER WAS. IT DIDN'T MATTER.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Satan had an ambition to destroy him.
[1:24:03] And he WAS LITERALLY JUST TAKING JOEL'S
[1:24:06] own ambitions.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Joel, you can FORGIVE ME LATER. JOEL'S
[1:24:10] OWN AMBITIONS and his own desires and he
[1:24:14] was just living them up and he was just
[1:24:16] LOOKING FOR THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY in life
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; AND MOM WAS DESPERATE AND DAD WAS
[1:24:23] DESPERATE
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; CUZ WE WANT MORE THAN SUCCESS
[1:24:26] FINANCIALLY.
[1:24:29] AMEN.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; We want you to have MORE THAN THE
[1:24:31] BIGGEST HOUSE AND THE BEST CAR AND THE
[1:24:34] BIGGEST DEGREE. YOU can have A DEGREES
[1:24:37] OF SO MUCH ON THE WALL THAT YOU have
[1:24:39] more than a thermometer.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; BUT LET ME JUST SAY WHEN IT COMES TO
[1:24:45] ETERNAL LIFE, THAT DOESN'T MATTER NONE.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; You can have the best car THAT THERE IS.
[1:24:52] YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST HOUSE THAT THERE
[1:24:53] IS. That don't matter to God.
[1:25:01] Eternal life is not inherited.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And I say this to you and I'll repent
[1:25:11] before God one day.
[1:25:14] His grandfather is a great hero to me.
[1:25:18] And I've listened to him preach
[1:25:19] masterpiece after masterpiece after
[1:25:21] masterpiece after masterpiece. And I
[1:25:23] hope you've appreciated that.
[1:25:29] But all of that,
[1:25:31] all of those sermons
[1:25:35] DOES NOT EXTEND DOWN TO THE SUCCESSION
[1:25:38] OF eternal life.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Get mad at me, throw a stone if you want
[1:25:44] to, but it doesn't matter what your last
[1:25:48] name is.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; There's no free pass here.
[1:25:56] Even Jer John uh Jesus turns to to to to
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; and he PREACHES HIS FIRST DOCTRINE. YOU
[1:26:06] MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; AND HE PREACHES IT TO A MAN THAT KNOWS
[1:26:11] the entire scriptures.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you even
[1:26:17] now. You can have done all the good
[1:26:20] works.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; You can work your way. You can work 20
[1:26:25] hours a day for church. You can work
[1:26:28] your way. Do you know that you can work
[1:26:30] so much you backslide?
[1:26:35] And I find even technical people and
[1:26:38] even people that are very helpful around
[1:26:40] church, I may be preaching now,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; will find THAT THEY WORK UNTIL THEIR
[1:26:46] PRAYER LIFE diminishes
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and THEY BECOME STAGNANT and literally
[1:26:51] become BECOME TO THE PLACE AND TO where
[1:26:54] they lose THAT REAL ZEAL FOR GOD. THEY
[1:26:58] FORGET WHAT THE IMPORTANT PART IS.
[1:27:12] The basis for that is I was sitting in
[1:27:14] the room this afternoon and God dealt
[1:27:16] with me to go just that way.
[1:27:20] Don't get secure.
[1:27:26] Don't get secure thinking I'VE SAT IN
[1:27:28] CHURCH ALL MY LIFE and everything's all
[1:27:29] right
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; because many time we've seen people
[1:27:33] backslide
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; people that has never missed a service
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; but they're sitting THERE COLD AS AN ICE
[1:27:41] CUBE
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; WITH NO RESPONSE TO THE word
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; and feel entitled
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THEIR POSITION.
[1:27:56] And they're missing who's really
[1:27:59] appearing in the building.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm going to need a little
[1:28:03] BIT MORE THAN THAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE SAT
[1:28:06] ON THE PLATFORM WITH BROTHER BRANDHAM?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; HUNDREDS OF PREACHERS SAT ON THE
[1:28:11] PLATFORM WITH BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THEY
[1:28:14] WATCHED INCREDIBLE SERMONS PREACHED
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; AND HOW THAT HE THROW HIS LITTLE
[1:28:18] SHOULDERS BACK AFTER A BIT AND SAY, "I'M
[1:28:21] WAITING ON SOMETHING."
[1:28:22] AMEN.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And then when he would WHEN THE PRESENCE
[1:28:25] OF GOD WOULD COME IN THE ROOM, HE'S
[1:28:27] HERE. I TAKE EVERY SPIRIT UNDER MY
[1:28:31] CONTROL.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT A STATEMENT THAT IS?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; No human being can make that statement.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD CAN TAKE EVERY
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; SPIRIT.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz let me just say this to you, YOU
[1:28:45] CAN'T CONTROL YOUR OWN SPIRIT.
[1:28:51] Can't control a dog hardly.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Thousands of people sitting there. But
[1:28:58] how many men
[1:29:00] sat behind the prophet of God and missed
[1:29:03] who is this Melzdc?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe their names were called. I'm not
[1:29:13] being facitious tonight, but let's just
[1:29:15] think about this. If we gain the whole
[1:29:18] WORLD AND WE LOSE OUR SOUL, WHAT
[1:29:20] PROFITS?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus is looking at ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES
[1:29:25] LIKE I'M PREACHING TO YOU tonight and he
[1:29:28] realizes SIMON DOESN'T HAVE IT.
[1:29:40] I didn't come to play games.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I could care less if my name's ever
[1:29:47] called in your conversations.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know him.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to know Jesus.
[1:30:02] I want you to know this Jesus who's God
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; that fills all time, space, and
[1:30:07] eternity.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He wants to live in your life.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. He does.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; He wants to be more than your favorite
[1:30:15] scripture.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He wants to live in your life.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:30:30] Simon,
[1:30:34] Satan has desired to have you.
[1:30:40] He's desired to have you.
[1:30:44] How many of you ever sometimes get up
[1:30:46] and you're living a normal life and then
[1:30:48] all of the sudden just something feels
[1:30:52] like almost moody.
[1:30:55] It's just swept into your life.
[1:30:58] just feels like what's wrong with this
[1:31:00] whole picture today?
[1:31:03] Satan's come to try you.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; He's come to war with you.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're attracted to
[1:31:10] the wrong thing.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you're attracted to the
[1:31:15] wrong thing.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And you just pick it up. You're a
[1:31:20] Christian.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You pay your tithe. You go to church.
[1:31:25] You've been filled with the spirit of
[1:31:26] God for years.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Satan knows I've only got a short time
[1:31:31] to work.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I can be filled with the
[1:31:35] HOLY GHOST AND STILL BE TEMPTED.
[1:31:37] ABSOLUTELY.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHY YOU MUST HAVE
[1:31:44] HIM.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU MUST HAVE HIM. AMEN. But
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I I've fallen over and
[1:31:54] over and OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DON'T LAY
[1:31:56] THERE. GET UP.
[1:31:59] YES, SIR.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M ASHAMED TO BE IN THIS
[1:32:01] BUILDING. GET UP.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; GET UP. I DON'T NEED YOUR HISTORY.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPENT TO ME. Just get
[1:32:09] up.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS KNOWS YOU'RE IN THE BUILDING. GET
[1:32:17] UP.
[1:32:27] NOW, let me just say something to you
[1:32:29] that maybe we we know, but sometimes
[1:32:32] we're just not consciously aware of.
[1:32:34] Seems like sometimes they're just blocks
[1:32:36] that come on us.
[1:32:38] You see,
[1:32:40] he's very much aware of what's happened
[1:32:42] with you personally
[1:32:48] in the last just few moments, last
[1:32:51] weeks, last months,
[1:32:56] no matter your spiritual walk with God,
[1:32:58] how long you've been here, he knows the
[1:33:01] struggles that you've been going
[1:33:02] through.
[1:33:06] This is not just for the sinner tonight.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; This is for even men sitting on this
[1:33:12] platform.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Even the speaker,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; our help is him.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Our help is him.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; And he's just waiting for us
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; to ask him for help.
[1:33:41] Simon,
[1:33:44] Satan desires to have you.
[1:33:49] What a trophy he would have been.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; What a trophy Tim Dodd would have been.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; What a trophy these men would have been.
[1:34:06] What a trophy you would have been.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; But God had different plans.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. You
[1:34:17] can't hold on yourself.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; You can make vows and YOU CAN MAKE
[1:34:22] PROMISES. David did.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; David continued to disappoint. Psalms
[1:34:30] 139, PSALMS 51 TELLS US, "CREATE IN ME A
[1:34:34] CLEAN HEART, OH GOD."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He begged God, he wanted to build him a
[1:34:38] temple, but he really needed God to live
[1:34:41] inside of here.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He really needed God to be in here.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; David knew David.
[1:34:56] And Simon, though he had been a part of
[1:34:58] a lot of things to today, he's looking
[1:35:01] at Jesus
[1:35:03] and he looks in his eyes like he's
[1:35:05] looked many other times and he knows.
[1:35:09] He knows.
[1:35:13] And Jesus said, "I I prayed for you.
[1:35:21] I prayed for you.
[1:35:25] Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I pray for you.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; I'd like to tell this audience tonight,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you, I prayed for you.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I've interceded for you.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I've mediated for you.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I've become YOUR HIGH PRIEST FOR YOU.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I WENT TO CALVARY FOR YOU.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You all KNOW THE STORY HOW HE WOULD BE
[1:35:49] BESIDE OF A FIRESIDE AND PEOPLE SAY,
[1:35:51] "OH, YOU'VE BEEN AT one of those random
[1:35:53] meetings." Oh, I mean Jesus meetings.
[1:35:57] You go to that church down there. No,
[1:36:00] no, no. I It must be somebody looks like
[1:36:03] me.
[1:36:05] One,
[1:36:08] ARE YOU SURE THAT'S not you two?
[1:36:12] And after the third time,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him a clock would crow and
[1:36:16] somewhere there was a rooster that
[1:36:18] crowed
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; that identified THE PROPHECY.
[1:36:24] THAT SIMON WOULD KNOW.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew this would come.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THIS would come.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He knew this HOUR WOULD COME.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED A ROOSTER to crow to you
[1:36:41] tonight.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; JUST REALIZE THAT THE WORD HAS SOUNDED
[1:36:45] FORTH
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS SHOWING YOU MERCY AND GRACE
[1:36:50] TONIGHT.
[1:36:58] Many of your parents are home or maybe
[1:36:59] your parents has driven
[1:37:02] multiple maybe 15 hours, 16 hours to
[1:37:07] bring you here,
[1:37:10] spend a lot of money,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; it's worth the investment. Yeah.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Parents, I want you to understand
[1:37:18] tonight.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; If you're weighing your hourly WAGES
[1:37:22] AGAINST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS
[1:37:23] BUILDING,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; let me just SAY THIS IS THE GREATEST
[1:37:28] INVESTMENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN AN ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:37:39] Joel stepped out on the
[1:37:43] on the balcony with me and he sat down.
[1:37:47] Now Joel probably didn't identify what
[1:37:50] was happening for a bit, but I felt a
[1:37:53] little wind stir,
[1:37:56] a little bit familiar with that wind.
[1:37:59] So, I just started talking
[1:38:02] and the Lord just led me down a path and
[1:38:03] I began to tell a story and Joel was
[1:38:06] just sitting listening. I'd like to hear
[1:38:08] how he saw this whole story.
[1:38:12] As I kind of looked out of the corner of
[1:38:13] my eye, Joel realized I wasn't talking
[1:38:16] about somebody else.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; That more than a buddy or his father's
[1:38:23] friend was talking to him.
[1:38:29] I can't rehearse what I told him,
[1:38:33] but all I know
[1:38:35] is Joel got up out of his seat. A
[1:38:38] complete different God.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; There's another young man I want to use
[1:38:49] here tonight before I finish this
[1:38:51] afternoon. I was sitting in my study. It
[1:38:55] was January
[1:38:57] and God was just pouring notes like I
[1:39:00] have on my page here today
[1:39:02] just pouring notes down.
[1:39:06] As I was writing these notes,
[1:39:08] his voice speaks to me. You will speak
[1:39:11] this sermon on a Wednesday night at
[1:39:15] Harold Hildebrance.
[1:39:19] I heard that and I thought, you know, I
[1:39:22] don't know so much about that. And I I
[1:39:23] must have heard that wrong. I have
[1:39:26] absolutely no plans ever in my life to
[1:39:29] be at brother Harold's on a Wednesday
[1:39:31] night. When I speak as a meeting, it's
[1:39:32] generally Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[1:39:36] I'll never be there on Wednesday night.
[1:39:38] That's just me.
[1:39:40] One of my buddies is sitting here on
[1:39:42] this platform tonight. Brother Tim Dodd.
[1:39:45] About a month later, he calls me and
[1:39:47] said, "Brother Ron, I'd like for you to
[1:39:48] come and preach our meeting." And he
[1:39:50] says, "Now, you'll have to travel
[1:39:51] through Edmonton
[1:39:53] and you'll you'll come." And he said, "I
[1:39:55] want you I want you to come." And he I
[1:39:57] believe it was one of the first times
[1:39:58] ever coming to your place.
[1:40:04] So, uh,
[1:40:07] I just felt the tug in my heart to go.
[1:40:10] Was a week or so later, Brother Harold
[1:40:12] calls me and he said, "Brother Hon, I
[1:40:13] heard you going past our place going to
[1:40:16] brother Tim Dots."
[1:40:19] He said, "NOW THERE'S JUST NO USE in
[1:40:20] wasting the trip."
[1:40:26] He said, "I WANT YOU TO STOP, COME IN
[1:40:28] EARLY enough that you can preach
[1:40:30] Wednesday night service
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and then go on to brother brother Tims
[1:40:35] and preach that weekend."
[1:40:40] Almost immediately I
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Here it is.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[1:40:49] So I
[1:40:51] we we arranged the the setting of it,
[1:40:55] got the tickets, and I went
[1:40:59] just like tonight.
[1:41:01] I knew I was commissioned to be there.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; You see, I I I knew like tonight, I
[1:41:07] wouldn't preach the prettiest message in
[1:41:09] the world, but all I would do was
[1:41:11] present Jesus Christ.
[1:41:14] Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And as I was preaching, there was a man
[1:41:17] that's a friend of mine named Brother
[1:41:18] Kim Dingwall.
[1:41:20] And here's how he's explained the story.
[1:41:23] His son's named Ben.
[1:41:27] AND BEN HAD DECIDED, I'M JUST GOING TO
[1:41:29] GIVE UP ON ALL of this and I'm going to
[1:41:31] go my own way. And and Brother Kim
[1:41:34] begins to explain to him, I'd really
[1:41:36] like for you to go to the service
[1:41:37] tonight. One of your favorite preachers
[1:41:39] is preaching, Brother Ron Spencer.
[1:41:42] And brother Ben somewhere SOMETHING
[1:41:44] RESPONDS IN HIS HEART beyond his own
[1:41:47] choices AND HE THINKS HE'S making the
[1:41:50] choice.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; I'll go one MORE TIME. WELL, THAT'S ALL
[1:41:54] GOD NEEDED.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; WELL, I REMEMBER PREACHING there and
[1:42:02] Brother Kim's been a friend of mine for
[1:42:04] years and and I remember preaching and
[1:42:07] and I was I was preaching. I'd stayed in
[1:42:10] their home before and I remembered what
[1:42:12] it was like one time when I was in their
[1:42:14] home and one of the girls had gave up
[1:42:17] her bedroom and she was she was going to
[1:42:19] sleep somewhere else in the house and
[1:42:20] they were taking me to the airport the
[1:42:22] next morning. I REMEMBER GETTING DOWN ON
[1:42:24] MY KNEES and praying beside of their bed
[1:42:27] and I said, "Lord, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
[1:42:29] WHICH ONE OF THEIR DAUGHTERS gave up
[1:42:31] their bed so I COULD SLEEP HERE, BUT I
[1:42:34] PRAY THAT YOU WOULD SUPERNATURALLY TOUCH
[1:42:37] THEIR LIVES. AMEN.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; That next morning when I got up, brother
[1:42:42] Kim would take me to the airport and I
[1:42:44] said, "How was your night?" He said, "I
[1:42:45] was up all night."
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; He called his daughter's name. HE SAID,
[1:42:48] "GOD CAME and met her during the night."
[1:42:52] And I've been praying with her all
[1:42:54] night.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And that night as I was preaching, they
[1:43:00] were sitting to my left or I would be to
[1:43:03] their right or so to speak. They'd be
[1:43:04] sitting over in this direction. I
[1:43:06] remember brother Ben was sitting near a
[1:43:08] pole. HE WAS SHRUGGED DOWN IN THE SEAT.
[1:43:11] The best that my my look would be. HE
[1:43:13] WAS SHRUGGED DOWN IN THE SEAT. IF HE
[1:43:15] COULD ONLY endure one more promise.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; HE HAD PROMISED TONIGHT'S HIS LAST
[1:43:21] NIGHT.
[1:43:25] Is that right, brother Ben?
[1:43:29] You see, but God had different plans.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:43:38] Ben was a good friend of my boys. My
[1:43:42] boys at that time could really identify
[1:43:44] with Ben cuz Ben was cool.
[1:43:49] My boys was in that phase of being cool.
[1:43:52] Ben was ADVENTUROUS AND THEY LIKE THAT
[1:43:54] ADVENTUROUS PART.
[1:43:58] They could, you know, those spirits
[1:44:00] could connect.
[1:44:02] Ben had came to service tonight. Ben no
[1:44:05] doubt had heard a lot of incredible
[1:44:07] preaching.
[1:44:09] Maybe even the po all the ministers
[1:44:10] sitting behind me. But tonight Jesus
[1:44:13] came.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Though it be a Wednesday night service,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; though it might be a chance meeting, YOU
[1:44:23] SEE GOD knew
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; months before.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You see, God knows how to make things
[1:44:30] happen. Right.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; HE'LL DEAL WITH BROTHER TIM DODD to
[1:44:33] bring Ron Spencer.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S got a plan.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't even know specifically
[1:44:40] everything that happened at your
[1:44:41] meeting, Brother Tim. I I don't
[1:44:43] remember. I'm sorry.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, GOD HAD A PLAN.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And God KNOW HE HE HE moved on BROTHER
[1:44:54] HAROLD CUZ GOD HAD A PLAN.
[1:44:58] THEN HE moved on, brother Kim.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz God had a plan.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; ALL THE WORKERS IN THE KITCHEN, ALL THE
[1:45:06] GROUNDS CREW, GOD'S GOT A PLAN.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GO COME WHERE
[1:45:15] YOU'RE AT
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S GOT A PLAN.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD IDENTIFICATION HAD YOU BOUND
[1:45:22] AND YOU COULDN'T FIND ANY SATISFACTION.
[1:45:25] THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT JUST
[1:45:27] SEEMED THERE HAD TO BE MORE AND MORE AND
[1:45:29] MORE.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; As I finished toward the end of the
[1:45:33] sermon,
[1:45:35] I turned and watched the guy come up the
[1:45:38] altar. He didn't need to come to the
[1:45:40] front right here.
[1:45:43] Made his way to the altar.
[1:45:48] Brother Ben sets here tonight
[1:45:52] because of new identification.
[1:45:58] I don't know what kind of work he does.
[1:46:00] That doesn't matter. I don't know how
[1:46:03] much money is in his bank account. That
[1:46:04] don't matter.
[1:46:07] I'm sorry. I don't even know how many
[1:46:08] children that you got. That doesn't
[1:46:09] matter. I think two, right?
[1:46:12] So I only know that by a double
[1:46:17] double scooter today
[1:46:20] and I can count.
[1:46:26] But you see, God knows everything.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; God knows everything.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; You didn't know that we'd drive by and
[1:46:35] I'd see you sawing wood today and I
[1:46:37] already had you down in the notes.
[1:46:43] and he was bringing that saw down like
[1:46:45] this right here.
[1:46:47] I thought that's kind of interesting.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; He's in my notes tonight
[1:46:53] and he's up here sawing wood.
[1:46:56] You see, God knows.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe you fought you didn't even want to
[1:47:01] come in this meeting.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU STRUGGLED.
[1:47:06] GOD KNOWS you struggle.
[1:47:09] Maybe you're a young man.
[1:47:11] I don't care whether your grandfather's
[1:47:13] a preacher or what. God wants to come to
[1:47:16] where you're at.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; He wants to come to your world where
[1:47:21] you're at. He's got plans.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; He's got plans for you.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'll just shrug it off. Okay.
[1:47:32] But how much longer will he deal with
[1:47:34] you?
[1:47:37] I would have saved myself a lot of
[1:47:38] trouble if I had come to Christ at a
[1:47:40] young age like many of you sitting in
[1:47:43] here. I would not have to deal with many
[1:47:45] of the scars of my life if I would have
[1:47:47] only come. But you see, God didn't give
[1:47:50] up.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; You see, the God that knew my past
[1:47:57] continues to know my future.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; How did these two people get married?
[1:48:03] God knew. How did this one come from way
[1:48:06] over here? God knew.
[1:48:10] The greatest witness that you will ever
[1:48:12] be is a life that's met him.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; A life that's met him.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Andrew preached in Edmonton with me last
[1:48:26] week.
[1:48:27] And as I sat there, I thought about this
[1:48:29] first service.
[1:48:32] the end of the service on Sunday night,
[1:48:34] the altar was packed all the way back
[1:48:37] through the aisles. It was packed and I
[1:48:40] thought Satan was trying to destroy him.
[1:48:45] We called Andrew our troubled child.
[1:48:50] He was one that was into everything.
[1:48:53] Ben, you might identify.
[1:49:00] I anointed his pillow.
[1:49:03] prayer cloths could have stuffed his
[1:49:05] pillow or even his mattress or the
[1:49:08] prayer cloth that I put in his bed.
[1:49:11] But all I knew was
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; if he would ever meet him,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; he would ever meet him,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; he'd never be the same.
[1:49:32] Brother Tom, sometimes we just don't
[1:49:34] understand what's getting ready to
[1:49:36] happen.
[1:49:38] When a young man turns around to us and
[1:49:40] says, "I don't know that God.
[1:49:46] I don't personally know that God."
[1:49:50] Now, listen. I just want you to be
[1:49:52] honest with me just over the next few
[1:49:53] seconds because I'm finished. Would you
[1:49:56] just be honest with me now?
[1:50:00] Is it you trying or him living?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to Are you having to make
[1:50:07] yourself sit in that pew and make
[1:50:09] yourself go to church next week and make
[1:50:11] yourself do what's right?
[1:50:14] Or is it him living?
[1:50:17] Is this just a learned behavior or just
[1:50:19] something that's just the right thing to
[1:50:21] do?
[1:50:24] He's here to meet you.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You can quote everything that brother
[1:50:32] Brandham said and that don't give you
[1:50:33] eternal life.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; You can be able to QUOTE ALL OF THIS
[1:50:38] RIGHT HERE and that will not give you
[1:50:39] eternal life.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the devil believes
[1:50:44] this right here.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; The devil withtood brother Brandham
[1:50:50] night after night after night. He
[1:50:51] believes this message.
[1:50:53] He's a real fighter of it, but he really
[1:50:55] believes it.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; The difference is him.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; The difference is him.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Could I ask you
[1:51:13] to bow your heads just now?
[1:51:16] I apologize for being so long, but
[1:51:28] I've watched the spirit of the Lord move
[1:51:29] across this audience tonight.
[1:51:35] He's came to your pew.
[1:51:37] He's came to where you're at.
[1:51:43] You don't have to wait till the last
[1:51:45] service of this meeting.
[1:51:48] I would like for you to be honest just
[1:51:50] now,
[1:51:57] every eye closed,
[1:52:00] every head bowed.
[1:52:03] Would there be one here that would like
[1:52:05] to say, "Brother Ron, I need him."
[1:52:09] Let Yes. Thank you.
[1:52:11] Thank you. I need him.
[1:52:15] I really need him.
[1:52:20] They need him.
[1:52:24] Hands continued raised. Maybe you've
[1:52:27] been a Christian for a while and you
[1:52:28] just got a little cool on God.
[1:52:33] You'd like to say, "Brother Ron, I need
[1:52:35] a refreshing of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:36] tonight."
[1:52:38] Oh yes.
[1:52:40] Oh yes.
[1:52:42] Oh yes. Oh yes.
[1:52:45] Oh yes.
[1:52:47] Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] Now, I came to a very difficult part of
[1:52:53] the sermon tonight where he led me to
[1:53:00] workers, moms, dads,
[1:53:05] could you participate just now? Maybe
[1:53:07] maybe you've grown a little bit cool on
[1:53:09] God. You've did a lot of work, but you
[1:53:11] too have grown cool.
[1:53:14] You'd like to raise your hand before
[1:53:16] God. It don't matter what your name is.
[1:53:20] That's right. That's right. Won't you
[1:53:22] just raise it high just now? Nobody's
[1:53:24] looking. Nobody's looking.
[1:53:28] Nobody's looking.
[1:53:30] Thank you. Just now.
[1:53:39] Almighty God, I bow my heads before you
[1:53:42] now.
[1:53:46] I learned a long time ago,
[1:53:50] it's not about a pretty sermon. It's
[1:53:53] about presenting you.
[1:53:59] I've watched the spirit of God brood
[1:54:01] across this audience just now.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; The word of life has been spoken.
[1:54:10] Now, Satan, you take your hands off of
[1:54:11] God's children.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; You tried to bind this service a couple
[1:54:16] of times. Even as I preached,
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; I felt your cold wind come through to
[1:54:21] try to bind.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; I pray that, Lord, THAT YOU'D BREAK THAT
[1:54:26] CYCLE TONIGHT.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; MAY THOSE DARK CHAINS BE BROKEN TONIGHT.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; May those prison doors be be loosed
[1:54:36] tonight.
[1:54:38] And at the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; I PRAY THAT FOR THOSE that have met you,
[1:54:43] Father, before
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and their altar has become cool
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the Lord has
[1:54:50] diminished in THEIR LIFE. OH GOD, MAY
[1:54:53] THERE BE A WELCOME SPIRIT.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; LORD, I'M NOT INTERESTED ABOUT PRIDE OR
[1:55:00] who we are. WE ALL need more of you.
[1:55:06] Oh God, right now
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; at the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Spirit sweep across this
[1:55:16] audience just now.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; OH, SWEEP ACROSS THIS AUDIENCE JUST NOW.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; You've raised your hands across this
[1:55:31] building.
[1:55:32] I want to invite you to this altar just
[1:55:34] now.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I've walked to altars before.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Break the chain.
[1:56:15] Now, I'm going to speak very honestly to
[1:56:17] you tonight. Some of you know that I
[1:56:19] know
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord is is here in
[1:56:24] this building. He's called your name
[1:56:26] while I preached
[1:56:28] and you're still sitting there.
[1:56:33] You've allowed your life to get cold.
[1:56:38] Don't miss this tonight.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this tonight, brother. This
[1:56:43] is the first service. I DON'T HAVE A
[1:56:44] service to waste.
[1:57:06] He waited on the well most of the day.
[1:57:09] He's patient.
[1:57:11] He's patient.
[1:57:13] Wherever you're at in the world and
[1:57:14] you're watching this just now,
[1:57:18] maybe you're in a living room, the
[1:57:20] spirit of God's tugging on your heart.
[1:57:22] Why don't you just go on your knees
[1:57:23] right there where you're at?
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you're a preacher,
[1:57:32] you've allowed things to slip in your
[1:57:33] life that's not right. Let the spirit of
[1:57:36] God soak our lives.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; It's not about yesterday. It's
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; not about what WE DID 10 YEARS AGO. IT'S
[1:57:43] ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR LIFE right

[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit.

[1:58:40] I've never felt the way that I felt as I
[1:58:42] stood on this platform tonight.
[1:58:46] I feel like Noah screaming his last
[1:58:48] sermon.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Just feels like
[1:58:57] our prophet preaching souls now in
[1:59:00] prison.

[1:59:49] preach it.

[1:59:53] GOD'S BROODING ACROSS THIS AUDIENCE.

[2:25:21] before I knew you.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord,
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; that's the whole message tonight,
[2:25:32] saints.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed be a holy day, Lord.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise you
[2:25:39] may I praise you. You're the healer of
[2:25:44] my heart.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; My heart is yours.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Now my heart is yours forever.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; I love
[2:25:56] I
[2:26:05] live to praise you, Lord. Ever I praise
[2:26:10] you. You're the healer of my heart.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Now I'm yours forever.
[2:26:25] Think of that line.
[2:26:27] I
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; now I live to praise you
[2:26:40] may I praise you. You're the he of my
[2:26:46] heart.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelu, brother Jared. Hallelujah. We
[2:26:55] praise him tonight.
[2:26:57] We praise him tonight.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron Spencer made reference of
[2:27:18] two boys tonight.
[2:27:21] Two young men.
[2:27:24] My son
[2:27:27] and brother Ben Dingwong,
[2:27:31] they have never been the same again.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; They have never gone back.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; You make your stand. You make your
[2:27:39] confession. You don't do it by emotion.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "That's the word of God.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I'm set free.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; He's the healer of the broken pieces,
[2:27:50] and I'm never going back again."
[2:27:54] Can I hear an amen, young people?
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you've laid at the altar, you
[2:27:59] leave it there. Don't ever pick it up
[2:28:00] again.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; It's finished. It's over. It's done.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; SAY, "PRAISE GOD."
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S OVER, DEVIL.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; I take God at his word tonight.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; I am free.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Free.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; We're just free.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, DEVIL. You can't have me.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; You had me long enough. I'm the Lord
[2:28:23] Jesus Christ.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; He was HERE BEFORE I CAME here tonight.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; He was there at the well before she got
[2:28:29] there.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The angel beat
[2:28:32] Eleazar.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; He beat Rebecca to the well."
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I say, "My God beat you here before you
[2:28:38] came to camp and knew what the first
[2:28:40] meeting was to be." And saints, it's
[2:28:43] only going to get better and better and
[2:28:46] better. And so, you might as well praise
[2:28:47] him tonight. You might as well rejoice
[2:28:50] and say, "How great is our God.
[2:28:55] GLORY."
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; I love to see the devil get defeated.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; I LOVE TO TELL THE DEVIL HE'S THE LOSER
[2:29:07] AND I'M THE WINNER.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; I was elected before the foundation of
[2:29:11] the world. He tells you you're A LOSER,
[2:29:13] I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE THE ELECTED.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I can do all things through Christ
[2:29:18] Jesus that strengthened me.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; So now whatever happened, whatever you
[2:29:29] laid down, never pick it up again.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Say it is over. I'm tired of your
[2:29:34] complex.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, did he did me? He did.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; When you know God met you, you know he
[2:29:41] met you. It's not a mind game. It's a
[2:29:43] heart.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need somebody to start
[2:29:47] throwing doubt into your mind. You need
[2:29:49] to hear the word of God to faith upon
[2:29:52] faith upon faith.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Get me preaching, brother Tim.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We might go all night
[2:29:59] yet.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Don't get scared if we're the if we're
[2:30:02] the Remember there's another book of
[2:30:04] Acts.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; What happened in the first books of
[2:30:06] Acts?
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; They preached all night.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; And even if you fell asleep and died,
[2:30:12] we'll raise YOU BACK UP.
[2:30:17] OH, HOW I love Jesus.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Healer of my broken heart.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Loved me before
[2:30:28] I even knew God was around.
[2:30:31] And God must have loved you very much to
[2:30:33] lay this kind of message on brother Ron
[2:30:35] Spencer's heart to speak to us so
[2:30:38] profoundly.
[2:30:40] I want you to say to yourself tonight,
[2:30:42] Lord, you must love me very much. Go
[2:30:45] ahead, say that to yourself.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, you must love me very much to
[2:30:50] affect me by the word so strongly. And
[2:30:53] now I just want to thank you, Lord. I
[2:30:56] want to give you the offering and
[2:30:58] sacrifice of praise.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe you young people haven't done it
[2:31:03] often enough. All you do is this. It's
[2:31:05] very, very simple. You just lift up your
[2:31:08] hands. Amen.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord Jesus,
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; I love you, LORD.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; IT IT'S SO WONDERFUL to tell the Lord
[2:31:31] Jesus how much we love him and
[2:31:34] appreciate what he's doing amongst us.
[2:31:38] this evening. Let's bow our heads in a
[2:31:41] word of prayer.
[2:31:43] You indeed do miracles so great. Lord,
[2:31:47] laying a specific thought and the burden
[2:31:51] of the word of the Lord upon your
[2:31:54] servant's heart tonight. We've all been

[2:32:01] assurance, my identification
[2:32:04] is in Christ alone. We love you and we
[2:32:09] thank you for the eternal work that you
[2:32:13] have done tonight in the hearts of your
[2:32:16] children. We bless you. We thank you. We
[2:32:20] love you and pray, Father, that your
[2:32:22] grace will go before us. Whether it be
[2:32:25] in our cabins, whether it be on the
[2:32:27] road, may the presence of God that is
[2:32:30] here, may it continue on into the
[2:32:33] morning and into the afternoon and
[2:32:36] tomorrow evening, Lord, build us up into
[2:32:38] the faith. Build us up into the presence
[2:32:41] of God. And may that heavenly place that
[2:32:43] we love so much become a reality to
[2:32:46] every young person that is here this
[2:32:50] evening. Bless us now as we prepare to
[2:32:53] go.
[2:32:55] Amen.

[2:39:50] there's enough lights out there. Be

[2:39:54] and you'll go out with your counselors
[2:39:56] and that will be fine. And we love you
[2:39:59] all. Thank you for making
[2:40:03] this night so special, for your
[2:40:05] presence, for your prayers, and for your
[2:40:08] desire for the things of God. Michael,
[2:40:10] why don't you come and close in a word
[2:40:12] of prayer?
[2:40:19] Let's just thank him.
[2:40:21] Heavenly Father, Lord, truly we are in
[2:40:23] awe of you this evening.
[2:40:26] In such an age of identity crisis that
[2:40:28] you could tell each one tonight, sons
[2:40:30] and daughters of God, you could take the
[2:40:33] harlot out of Rahab's name. You could
[2:40:35] take out the blind part out of
[2:40:36] Bardameus's name and show them who they
[2:40:39] are. Just a moment. Blind Barnameus
[2:40:42] reached out and he son of David have
[2:40:44] mercy on me.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, tonight I believe as some came to
[2:40:48] the altar this evening in their heart
[2:40:49] who was crying out trying to stop you in
[2:40:52] your tracks. Like brother Brandham said
[2:40:54] just that moment changed his
[2:40:56] identification forever.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; Lord truly we're in awe of you.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; We're in awe of what just a few moments
[2:41:02] in your presence can do to change from
[2:41:04] past just a few minutes in the present
[2:41:06] can change the future forever. Oh God,
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; truly Lord, we believe this is just a
[2:41:11] taste of what you're going to do this
[2:41:12] camp. So we pray that you would just set
[2:41:15] aside the vessel, Brother Ron Spencer,
[2:41:17] take his body, his spirit and soul, make
[2:41:19] him so keen and in tune with your spirit
[2:41:21] that you would be able to speak through
[2:41:23] his vessel, speak through his lips. We
[2:41:25] pray, oh God, be with each one now as we
[2:41:27] depart from this place. We thank you for
[2:41:29] your presence and we look forward to
[2:41:31] what you're going to do for us in Jesus
[2:41:33] name. Amen.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Michael.
[2:41:36] Tomorrow morning, I believe morning
[2:41:37] devotion is a half hour early. So, we
[2:41:40] can we'll be breaking a half an hour
[2:41:42] earlier before lunch because I believe
[2:41:43] they're going to be going up the
[2:41:44] mountain. So, we'll have morning
[2:41:46] devotion at 9:30. We're looking forward
[2:41:49] to seeing you all there. God bless you.
[2:41:51] God be with you until we meet again. May
[2:41:55] the Lord Jesus go before you. You're
[2:41:57] dismissed in Jesus name. Thank you,
[2:41:59] young people.
[2:42:45] Heat. Heat.
