Description:
I Wouldn't Take Nothin' For My Journey Now

Well, I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
Gotta make it to Heaven somehow
Though the devil tempt me and he tried to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name
All the wealth I want and worldly fame
If I could, still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now

Well, I started out travellin' for the Lord many years ago
I've had a lot of heartache and I met a lot of grief and woe
But when I would stumble, then I would humble down
And there I'd say, I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now

I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
Gotta make it to Heaven somehow
Though the devil tempt me and he tried to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name
All the wealth I want and worldly fame
If I could, still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now

Oh, there's nothin' in this world that'll ever take the place of God's love
All the silver and gold wouldn't buy a touch from above
When the soul needs healin' and I begin to feelin' His power
Then I can say, thank the Lord, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now

Oh, I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
Gotta make it to Heaven somehow
Though the devil tempts me and he tried to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name
All the wealth I want and worldly fame
If I could, still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
No, no, no

Oh, I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
I've gotta make it to Heaven somehow
Though the devil tempt me and he tried to turn me around
You know he's offered everything that's got a name
All the wealth I want and worldly fame
If I could, still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
If I could, still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now
