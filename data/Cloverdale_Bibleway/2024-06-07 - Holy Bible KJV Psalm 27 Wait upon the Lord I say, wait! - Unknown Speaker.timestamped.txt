[0:00] Psalm 27 a Psalm of David the Lord is my
[0:04] light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[0:07] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[0:09] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[0:12] even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon
[0:15] me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[0:17] fell though a host should encamp against
[0:20] me my heart shall not fear though War
[0:23] should rise against me in this will I be
[0:25] confident one thing have I desired of
[0:27] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[0:30] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[0:32] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[0:34] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[0:37] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[0:39] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[0:41] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[0:44] me up upon a rock and now shall mine
[0:47] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[0:49] round about me therefore will I offer in
[0:51] his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will
[0:54] sing yay I will sing praises unto the
[0:57] Lord here oh Lord Lord when I cry with
[1:01] my voice have mercy also upon me and
[1:04] answer me when thou sest seek ye my face
[1:08] my heart said unto thee thy face Lord
[1:11] will I seek hide not thy face far from
[1:14] me put not thy servant away in Anger
[1:16] thou Hast been my help leave me not
[1:19] neither forsake me oh god of my
[1:21] salvation when my father and my mother
[1:24] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[1:27] teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in
[1:30] a plain path because of mine enemies
[1:33] Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of
[1:35] mine enemies for false Witnesses are
[1:38] risen up against me and such as breathe
[1:40] out cruelty I had fainted unless I had
[1:43] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[1:45] in the land of the living wait on the
[1:47] Lord be of good courage and he shall
[1:49] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:53] Lord
