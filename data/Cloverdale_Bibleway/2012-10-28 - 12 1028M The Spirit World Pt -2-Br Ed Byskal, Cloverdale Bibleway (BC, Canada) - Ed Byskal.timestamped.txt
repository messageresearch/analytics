[16:32] meal, been with a meal with someone and
[16:35] seen them put uh pepper and salt all
[16:38] over their meal? Just liberally, just
[16:40] all over. Who's ever seen that before?
[16:42] And it's like they're drowning it in
[16:44] salt and pepper. I feel our services
[16:46] ought to just be filled with praises and
[16:48] thanksgivings when we hear the word. It
[16:51] ought to just not be sporadic here.
[16:53] Amen. Praise you, Jesus. It ought to
[16:55] just be full. That's the house of the
[16:57] Lord. We ought to just be filling it up.
[16:59] Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God.
[17:06] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
[17:08] courts with praise.
[17:10] Heavenly Father, we want to enter into
[17:12] your gates, Lord, with hands lifted up,
[17:15] our hearts wide open, our mouths
[17:17] expressing our love to you. Lord, we
[17:20] love you today, Lord. You've been so
[17:22] generous. Lord, you've opened up heaven
[17:24] to us. You've given us healing. You've
[17:26] given us salvation. You've given us
[17:29] deliverance. You've given us promises of
[17:32] a future home of a millennium. There's
[17:34] no reason for doubt. There's no room for
[17:37] fear. There's no room for Satan this
[17:40] morning. In fact, even now, we claim
[17:42] deliverance and we claim healing and
[17:45] your power to be poured into this
[17:47] service, Lord. Let the appearing of your
[17:49] word and the appearing of your presence
[17:52] be strong today, Lord. And let the bride
[17:55] of Christ respond, Lord, from our lives,
[17:58] not in coolness or starchiness, but may
[18:01] it just be wide open, Lord, of
[18:03] receiving. Thus, sayeth the Lord. We've
[18:06] been instructed to rally around the gift
[18:08] of God, the Holy Spirit, the presence of
[18:12] God. So, we want to be faithful today,
[18:15] Lord, to rally around the opening of
[18:17] your presence. And may the Holy Spirit
[18:21] be poured out into this meeting, God.
[18:24] coming against every unbelief, every
[18:27] doubt, and everything of Satan's
[18:29] kingdom, announcing to him that he is
[18:32] defeated, that we are on the winning
[18:35] side. Satan's already lost the battle.
[18:38] The struggle is over. The battle is
[18:41] over. It is finished, Lord. And we are
[18:44] receiving the benefits
[18:46] of your power, God. Oh, let the word
[18:49] today be strong among us. Let the power
[18:52] of God be released Lord into every life,
[18:56] every situation, God. May every
[18:58] believer, Lord, be responding to the
[19:01] word of God that this is our day of
[19:03] jubilee. This is the year of jubilee.
[19:07] Oh God, may your Holy Spirit, Lord, be
[19:10] so felt within our bodies, Lord, that
[19:12] sicknesses would leave, cancers would
[19:15] leave, tumors would fall off, illnesses,
[19:18] Lord, would would be would be delivered
[19:21] out of the people's lives. Spirits would
[19:24] be mended, Lord. Hearts would be brought
[19:26] back into fellowship that there would be
[19:28] such a love, such a pouring out of your
[19:31] presence, Lord. It'd be joy unspeakable,
[19:34] Lord. there be a spontaneous praise,
[19:37] God. And may our souls be fed on the
[19:40] word of God. Strengthen our pastor
[19:43] today, Lord. We believe in these closing
[19:45] moments of time, Lord, that we want to
[19:48] be tuned into that other dimension. We
[19:50] want the spirit of God, Lord, to come so
[19:53] near to us and that we would recognize
[19:56] your presence.
[19:58] Bless today, God. We give it to you,
[20:00] Lord. Be with our sister Jenny Gray.
[20:03] Lord, bless her, Lord. And may her body
[20:06] be healed and delivered of this
[20:08] condition. And may the faith that she
[20:11] has in you, Lord, as her physician just
[20:14] guide the surgeons, Lord, and as we all
[20:17] of us would desire healing and to to
[20:20] give our lives to you for service, then
[20:23] that we would be free of any inhibitions
[20:26] or thing of Satan's kingdom. Would you
[20:28] grant grace and mercy to Sister Jenny
[20:31] and to many unspoken requests? Hands are
[20:34] all throughout the building and on the
[20:36] internet. Lord Jesus, you are everything
[20:39] to us. We invite your nearness today.

[20:44] us, we agree with it already and we say
[20:47] amen, Lord. We we are so happy to be on
[20:50] the winning side, Lord, and to know that
[20:52] we can get behind what you're doing,
[20:55] Lord, and rally around, Lord, the spoken
[20:58] word of God, and that the atmosphere can
[21:01] be created, the environment can be
[21:03] right, Lord Jesus.

[21:26] and what you're doing among us. Bless

[21:30] Dutch Scott, Lord, in the meetings as he
[21:32] comes back home. May his heart be full,
[21:35] Lord, to be able to give back to us,

[21:41] them, Lord. be thankful for every

[21:54] the move of God among us.

[25:16] The
[25:17] &gt;&gt; song I want to sing is called He's
[25:18] Standing By.
[25:30] I hear a song
[25:33] though the night is silent.
[25:38] I see a star
[25:41] though dark clouds hide the sky.
[25:45] [Music]
[25:46] I feel a touch.
[25:49] Although my friends have left me,
[25:55] I'm not alone,
[25:58] I know he's standing by.
[26:03] He's standing by.
[26:06] I feel his presence with me.
[26:12] Like Moses when he climb Mount Sunny,
[26:20] he's standing by.
[26:22] He knows how much I need him.
[26:28] He loves me so
[26:31] I know he's standing by.
[26:36] I went away
[26:39] into a far off country.
[26:45] In pain and wants,
[26:48] he heard my lonely cry.
[26:53] He brought me back. He put a new robe on
[26:59] me.
[27:02] It cost his life.
[27:05] I know he's standing by.
[27:10] He's standing by.
[27:13] I feel his presence with me.
[27:19] Like Moses when he climbed Mount Si.
[27:25] [Music]
[27:27] He's standing by.
[27:30] He knows how much I need him.
[27:35] He loves me so
[27:38] I know he's standing by.
[27:43] Now I can sing
[27:46] a song of full redemption.
[27:52] He dwells within
[27:55] his lovely little bride.
[28:00] The bleeding word
[28:03] transforms her to his image.
[28:08] Till she is him.

[28:17] He's standing by.
[28:20] I feel his presence with me.

[28:33] he's standing by.
[28:36] He knows how much I need him.
[28:42] He loves me so
[28:45] I know he's standing by. Can we sing it
[28:48] together? Oh, he's standing by.
[28:53] I feel his presence with me
[28:59] like Moses when he climbed Mount A.
[29:07] He's standing by.
[29:10] He knows how much I need him.
[29:15] He loves me so
[29:18] I know he's standing by.
[29:28] [Applause]
[29:33] Amen. As the children come in from
[29:34] Sunday school and the deacons make
[29:36] ready, we're going to take up an
[29:37] offering at this time. Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; It's good to come into the house of Lord
[29:42] of the Lord and worship him.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; And giving is a part of that worship.
[29:46] And we want to lift an offering to him
[29:48] this morning as a sacrifice.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is always a sacrifice. You
[29:54] know, Brother Brandham said, this almost
[29:56] sounds like I'm pulling for money here.
[29:57] Just a second. But worship in general is
[30:00] a sacrifice.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if it if it feels
[30:04] easy, then there there's no spiritual
[30:06] sacrifice in it.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it doesn't we don't feel like
[30:09] raising our hands.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we raise them anyway
[30:14] &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice unto the Lord.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't feel like taking up
[30:18] an offering. And it's not just you folks
[30:21] that don't feel like giving. Sometimes
[30:23] sometimes we as ministry, we don't we
[30:25] don't feel like well, you know, we've
[30:26] taken up lots of offerings and maybe the
[30:28] people will won't like it if we take up
[30:30] another offering, but it's a sacrifice
[30:33] &gt;&gt; and we want to give as unto the Lord.
[30:35] Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word
[30:37] of prayer.
[30:40] Heavenly Father,
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes we don't always know
[30:44] where the right words come from
[30:46] &gt;&gt; when we speak something that is
[30:48] necessary for the benefit of the hearer.
[30:50] And
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're in such anticipation this
[30:53] morning of the word.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; But Lord, there's a part of worship that
[30:58] comes in giving, Lord. And I'm reminded,
[31:00] Lord, of your prophet that said many
[31:02] times he had a meetings and he and there
[31:05] was the odd time that he would try and
[31:07] get by of the meeting without taking up
[31:10] an offering and it just wasn't the
[31:13] successful that it ought to have been.
[31:16] And Lord, we just know that it was
[31:18] because we have a part to give. We have
[31:21] something to play in the service, oh
[31:24] God. And our giving is a part of that
[31:26] worship. And so now, Lord, as we come to
[31:30] give, we pray that you'll accept it as a
[31:32] sacrifice in your presence, Lord, we
[31:35] lift it not to a church or to a a
[31:38] deacon. We lift it unto the living God.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; And we ask, Lord, that you'll receive it
[31:43] and that you'll bless it to the kingdom
[31:45] of God. And may all our small part,
[31:49] though it be just two might, may you
[31:52] increase it to the purpose that you have
[31:54] predestinated it for. We commit the
[31:56] offering to you asking your blessing
[31:58] upon it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here I am to worship.
[32:14] Amen. Just as the offering's being taken
[32:16] up, we're going to prepare our hearts
[32:17] for the word. Brother Bisco is going to
[32:18] be coming and speaking for us. Just want
[32:21] our hearts to be ready. Amen. Light of
[32:24] the world.
[32:26] Oh light of the world, you step down
[32:32] into darkness.
[32:35] Oh, open my eyes. Let me see.
[32:42] Oh, such beauty
[32:44] that made
[32:47] this heart.
[32:51] The joy of the life spent with you. Oh,
[32:57] here I am to worship,
[33:01] Lord. Here I am to bow out. Here I am to
[33:07] say that you're my God.
[33:12] Lord, you're all together lovey.
[33:17] You're all together worthy,
[33:21] allto together wonderful
[33:26] to me.
[33:28] King of all things. Oh, the king of all.
[33:34] Oh, so highly
[33:36] exalted.
[33:38] Your glorious
[33:40] in heaven
[33:43] above.
[33:46] So humbly you came to the earth that you
[33:52] created
[33:54] and all of sin. We came for here I am to
[34:02] worship.
[34:04] Lord here I am to bow down. Here I am to
[34:10] say that you're my God.
[34:17] [Music]
[34:18] All together love
[34:22] more.
[34:24] [Music]
[34:26] Oh, wonderful to thee. I'll never know.
[34:32] Oh, and I'll never
[34:35] know just how much it costs for to see
[34:42] my sin
[34:45] upon that cross.
[34:48] And I'll never know
[34:52] how much it cost to see my sin
[35:00] upon that cross.
[35:05] Oh my.
[35:08] Oh, here I am first.
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] Oh, it's my
[35:16] to say that you're my God.
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] Oh yes, you love me Lord
[35:28] and you are worthy.
[35:32] Oh wonderful to me. Here I am
[35:38] and to worship.
[35:41] Here I am to bow hell. Here I am to say
[35:47] that you're my God.
[35:51] [Music]
[35:54] For you are lovely.
[35:58] Oh you are worthy.
[36:02] Wonderful.
[36:03] [Music]
[36:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Have
[36:11] you come here to worship him this
[36:13] morning? Hallelujah. To bring the
[36:15] sacrifice of praise. He's worthy,
[36:18] saints, of everything we have to offer.
[36:21] As our brother John said, it should just
[36:23] be an outpouring of thanksgiving, of
[36:25] worship, and of praise. He's worthy of
[36:28] more than just a a nodding of the head
[36:31] or raising of the hands. We've been
[36:33] given voices and lifts to praise and
[36:35] with. If we don't, the rocks will cry
[36:37] out. Oh, we want there just to be an
[36:40] anthem of thanksgiving from the redeemed
[36:42] this morning, saying that here we are to
[36:44] worship, Lord. Here we are to give you
[36:47] thanks, Father, for what you've done for
[36:48] us. For you are worthy, Lord. Blessed be
[36:52] your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[36:55] Hallelujah. We want there to be such an
[36:57] atmosphere that when the word comes, it
[36:59] would just come forth with power and
[37:01] with deliverance, that there would be
[37:02] healing in our midst. Hallelujah. Why
[37:05] don't we invite our pastor to come and
[37:07] as he comes sing blessed be blessed be
[37:09] your name. Hallelujah.
[37:12] Oh blessed
[37:15] be.
[37:17] Oh blessed
[37:19] be
[37:21] we sing. Blessed
[37:23] be
[37:25] the name.
[37:29] Oh blessed.
[37:33] Oh God, bless
[37:36] me.
[37:37] Oh, bless
[37:40] you.
[37:42] We sing the second verse. Oh Lord our
[37:53] soul. You're the
[37:56] mountain
[37:58] more than my heart always thirsts for.
[38:02] The Lord makes me whole.
[38:06] You're the love of my soul.
[38:10] And whatever comes my way.
[38:14] I know you're in control.
[38:18] I say blessed
[38:20] me.
[38:22] Oh Lord, blessed me.
[38:27] Blessed me
[38:30] for the
[38:35] blessing.
[38:38] Oh Lord, blessed
[38:40] me.
[38:42] Oh, bless. Hallelujah. Let your people
[38:45] proclaim
[38:47] and let your people proclaim.
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] You are holy.
[38:57] Oh, we sing you our holy
[39:02] God.
[39:04] We lift up your name
[39:08] and give
[39:13] him glory.
[39:15] Hallelujah. Sing that again. Let your
[39:17] people and let your people
[39:21] [Music]
[39:23] That is our
[39:25] [Music]
[39:32] God
[39:33] and we
[39:36] [Applause]
[39:37] [Music]
[39:39] glory.
[39:46] You see everything
[39:48] [Music]
[39:55] that you are
[40:00] holy
[40:01] [Music]
[40:09] and glory
[40:13] [Music]
[40:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[40:22] name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, we cry out you are holy this
[40:28] morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:32] Hallelujah.
[40:33] Blessed be your name.
[40:36] [Music]
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:43] a wonderful atmosphere.
[40:48] [Music]
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] Wonder if we could all stand. We I want
[40:55] to go to the word immediately,
[40:58] but just before we turn to the word, I'd
[40:59] like to just say with regards to brother
[41:01] Tim's comments on the on the offerings,
[41:04] you notice we're we are taking up
[41:06] offerings in the Sunday morning services
[41:08] and some other services. And and this
[41:10] does not replace the the uh offering
[41:14] box. And those of you that have been
[41:16] here for years and you're accustomed to
[41:18] your tithes, tithes are for the ministry
[41:21] of the word. And we send out tithes.
[41:25] Sometimes send out uh hub stations
[41:29] because it's the word. Sometimes tithes
[41:31] pays for the special ministry that
[41:33] comes, the ministry that is here,
[41:35] anything to do with the word. And then
[41:38] uh offerings is to the provide for the
[41:42] utilities and the upkeep of the church.
[41:45] And missions of course is strictly the
[41:47] missions and many much of the offerings
[41:49] go to missions as well. But the reason
[41:52] we started taking up offerings is there
[41:54] we have guests that come and a lot of
[41:56] visitors come and that's number one.
[41:58] Number two, we have a lot of young
[42:00] people that have gone up from 12 to 17,
[42:03] from 15 to 20. And in that time they've
[42:07] have gone into the workforce or they
[42:09] started working whatever more. And I
[42:11] think that it gives them an opportunity
[42:14] to become uh initiated and to know that
[42:18] this is a part of Christian living. And
[42:20] quite frankly, you're looking at a
[42:23] person right now. I think giving is a
[42:25] wonderful thing. I love giving not only
[42:29] in the church but to people or to help
[42:31] out in whatever way.
[42:33] And and I think uh you know it has been
[42:35] said whatever comes into your hands hold
[42:38] it loosely cuz the Lord may want it and
[42:42] and if you happen to get uh one or two
[42:45] uh items count to give one away. That's
[42:48] a that's a good spirit. Hallelujah. And
[42:51] I thought we would start even a website
[42:54] maybe called uh lof living for others.
[42:59] Living for others.com. How would that
[43:02] be? Hallelujah. The bride of Jesus
[43:04] Christ. Amen. We've got a glorious
[43:07] gospel. So, I thought I would just make
[43:09] that comment. I don't want to take up
[43:11] any other time because I need it for the
[43:13] word this morning. Are you ready for the
[43:15] word?
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm looking down seeing brother
[43:19] Kyle Morton uh brother Kyle has uh has
[43:23] written and we've had under discussion
[43:25] the the prayer meeting. So the prayer
[43:27] meetings which have been just suspended
[43:29] for a short time uh they're not they're
[43:32] not cancelled at all. We're just
[43:34] rearranging things and discussing some
[43:36] things and and because uh I I think a a
[43:39] successful church is a praying church
[43:42] and we have lots to pray about and I'm
[43:44] so thankful for those of you that feel a
[43:46] burden to pray and I just ask that that
[43:49] the spirit of prayer will come upon this
[43:52] congregation.
[43:53] Amen. Hallelujah. And we know we don't
[43:56] only pray here in church. Of course not.
[43:58] But it's wonderful to get together at
[44:00] the hour of prayer. Amen.
[44:05] We'll turn in the Bible please to uh
[44:08] scripture reading which we started with
[44:10] last week. Ephesians the 6th chapter.
[44:13] And I'm going to be taking from a
[44:15] different direction but the same
[44:17] subject, the spirit world.
[44:21] And uh you might as well prepare to say
[44:26] amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; I
[44:30] Lord willing I just uh this been on my
[44:33] mind so long and I see it from so many
[44:35] directions and I just couldn't get
[44:37] stopped last night and so I tried to
[44:40] stop about 8:00 and getting close to 11
[44:43] or still I just couldn't. And I said,
[44:45] 'Lord, I you have to give me the
[44:48] strength and the energy cuz I just feel
[44:49] like preaching right now.
[44:53] That's something. Amen. Isn't he
[44:55] wonderful?
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in a moment of
[44:58] prayer.
[45:00] Oh father, our father, which art in
[45:04] heaven,
[45:05] glorified and hallowed be your name. And
[45:09] we do say again this morning, let your
[45:12] kingdom come and may your will be done
[45:15] in every life and every home and every
[45:17] family. Lord, we pray that you'll
[45:20] provide and break the bread to us today
[45:22] and give us our daily food. May we be
[45:25] strengthened thereby. I pray, oh God,
[45:28] that you'll forgive us our sins, our
[45:30] wrongs, anything that we have has come
[45:33] between you and I or grieved us, you
[45:36] grieved you. We pray, Father, in the
[45:38] name of Jesus Christ, you'll forgive us
[45:41] as we forgive others. We pray that
[45:43] you'll bless this congregation and those
[45:45] that are streaming at this time. And we
[45:48] thank you for answered prayers. And now
[45:50] we pray you'll anoint your word
[45:52] mightily,
[45:53] anoint the people and the speaker in the
[45:57] name of Jesus Christ and for his glory
[45:59] alone. Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Last week, we were asked to pray,
[46:04] I believe it was last week, the week
[46:05] before for Sister Angela Michel's
[46:09] brother and sent me an email this
[46:11] morning that God had answered that
[46:13] prayer. And uh now we're just praying
[46:16] that his soul will be touched and moved
[46:19] towards God. Amen.
[46:22] All right, we're going to begin reading
[46:26] in the 10th verse. Finally, my brethren,
[46:29] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[46:31] of his might. Put on the whole armor of
[46:34] God that you may be able to stand
[46:37] against the ws of the devil. Now, notice
[46:40] we're standing against, in this case,
[46:44] the ws of the devil or the methods of
[46:47] the devil,
[46:48] &gt;&gt; his program,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; his strategies,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; and there's no end of them. But but this
[46:56] is different from trials and
[46:58] tribulations and whatever more. So we in
[47:01] this case we stand against them. For we
[47:04] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[47:06] against principalities and powers,
[47:08] against the rulers of the darkness of
[47:10] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[47:13] in high places. Wherefore take unto you
[47:16] the whole armor of God, that you may be
[47:18] able to uh to withstand in the evil day,
[47:22] and having done all to stand. Stand
[47:25] therefore, having your loins gird about
[47:27] with truth, and having on the
[47:29] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[47:31] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[47:33] gospel of peace, above all, taking the
[47:37] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[47:39] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[47:42] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[47:45] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[47:48] which is the word of God. I have a
[47:51] second reading in 2 Corinthians chapter
[47:55] 4
[47:57] 16 and 17. And then we will go to 1
[48:01] Peter 1:es
[48:03] 5-7.
[48:07] 2 Corinthians 4:16-1 17. For which cause
[48:12] we faint not, but though our outward man
[48:15] perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[48:19] day by day. For our light affliction,
[48:23] notice that, which is but for a moment,
[48:27] workketh for us far more a far more
[48:31] exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in first Peter 1
[48:39] starting verse 5,
[48:42] we are kept by the power of God through
[48:44] faith unto salvation, ready to be
[48:47] revealed in the last time, wherein you
[48:51] greatly rejoice, though now for a season
[48:54] if need be, you are in heaviness through
[48:57] manifold temptations, that the trial of
[49:00] your faith being much more precious than
[49:03] than of gold that perisheth
[49:06] though it be tried with fire might be
[49:09] found under praise and honor and glory
[49:12] at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. And I would like to
[49:19] ask that there be just as little
[49:21] movement as possible in the congregation
[49:24] and the young people and their children.
[49:27] Uh this is not just a sermon this
[49:29] morning. This is something that's really
[49:31] been uh very
[49:35] uh very real to me and I like I
[49:39] remembered what brother Brandham said
[49:41] when he was coming in the seals. He said
[49:42] he just wished that he would be able to
[49:45] convey it and make it real the way it
[49:49] comes to him. And so that's what I think
[49:51] every minister goes through. And I'm
[49:53] praying especially and and you've been
[49:56] so attentive and I really really
[49:58] appreciate that.
[50:00] I want to get right into it and I'd like
[50:02] to give you just an overview to begin
[50:04] with so you know where we're going. And
[50:07] there isn't anybody
[50:10] in the audience, the streaming audience
[50:12] or this audience
[50:15] that I wouldn't be speaking to even from
[50:17] the younger youngest to the eldest of
[50:20] us.
[50:22] But I would like to speak on how God
[50:25] uses
[50:27] the forces of circumstance. I want you
[50:30] to think about this now. The forces of
[50:33] circumstance often, you know,
[50:35] circumstances take on a life of their
[50:37] own. Things happen, things take place,
[50:41] things come into our lives, into our
[50:44] homes, into our into our environment uh
[50:48] uninvited.
[50:49] And some of them we wish we could show
[50:51] the exit door to but somehow they
[50:54] remained there and uh some things
[50:58] sometimes we had high expectations for
[51:01] something but it turned sour and uh
[51:04] things go sideways
[51:06] uh unplanned unpredicted
[51:09] uh but nevertheless I want you to
[51:13] lift your eyes above that because I'm
[51:16] speaking last week and this week on the
[51:19] spirit spirit world. Uh the spirit world
[51:22] is something we are not nearly as
[51:25] conscious of as we should be.
[51:28] Uh sometime you're talking to someone or
[51:31] there's just so many examples and
[51:34] sometime we may not even know ourselves
[51:36] but we're being influenced by the spirit
[51:39] world and I trust we're being spirit
[51:42] influenced by the um spirits of angels
[51:47] which are to be ministering to us. The
[51:49] Bible says they're ministering spirits.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[51:55] &gt;&gt; present here? God will never never leave
[51:58] his people outside of the influence of
[52:01] the Holy Spirit and the spirit of God.
[52:05] So we we understand that. So the forces
[52:09] of circumstance
[52:11] and he uses these to form or to move
[52:16] things forward
[52:19] according to his plan or the full plan
[52:22] of redemption. Now you'll really see in
[52:25] a in a few moments. This is a glorious
[52:28] truth.
[52:30] The travail of birth painans will be
[52:33] very much part of this subject. The
[52:36] distress and the pressures of spiritual
[52:40] trials.
[52:42] The squeeze.
[52:44] And we are familiar with that term, the
[52:46] squeeze. I think you'll have a different
[52:48] view of the squeeze by the time we're
[52:51] done the service.
[52:53] uh the squeeze and the result of the
[52:57] squeeze
[53:00] the squeeze when the first atom was
[53:03] formed because that's what the word
[53:05] formed goes into and actually means in
[53:09] Hebrew
[53:10] the squeeze when the first atom was
[53:13] formed the squeeze that the life of
[53:16] Jesus Christ details
[53:19] his life was a life acquainted with
[53:22] grief
[53:24] and sorrow,
[53:27] the distress and the pressures of
[53:29] spiritual trials and the squeeze and the
[53:31] result of the squeeze
[53:34] and our experience today. What we
[53:37] experience
[53:39] in the masterpiece, I've not started the
[53:42] subject yet. I'm just laying a little
[53:43] bit of a prefoundation here. And in
[53:47] these weakening conditions, notice it's
[53:50] a masterpiece. and in these weakening
[53:53] conditions and afflictions and things of
[53:56] the world that's put upon us sometime to
[54:00] perfect us.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Think it not strange that
[54:05] these trials come? They're only working
[54:08] out for our good and to perfect us and
[54:12] bring us into that place." Now, we may
[54:15] consider that place as a spiritual
[54:18] attainment here, but I want to carry it
[54:21] further because what we're really here
[54:25] for is for an eternal purpose. And I
[54:28] want to refer to that place as the place
[54:31] where Jesus said, "I go to prepare a
[54:34] place for you." And I want to tie
[54:37] together the things that we're
[54:39] experiencing which we think are just
[54:42] daytoday struggles. We need to like the
[54:45] boy on the bicycle. Look at the end.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to handle or
[54:52] conduct ourselves the way we ought to
[54:56] with the present situations
[54:59] &gt;&gt; because we feel swallowed up. We may
[55:02] feel overwhelmed.
[55:04] But if you look at the end,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; then you'll be able to understand the
[55:08] present.
[55:11] And so he said, "Think it not strange
[55:13] concerning the trials that come. They're
[55:16] only working for our good and to perfect
[55:18] us and to bring us into that place."
[55:21] These great and I love this phrase. I
[55:23] would like to have had it on the screen
[55:27] for you, but if you would remember,
[55:30] this is one of the This is a piece of
[55:33] literature.
[55:36] these great deserts of experience
[55:41] where righteous men are molded into
[55:43] saints.
[55:47] We thank thee for these experiences
[55:51] where righteous men are molded into
[55:54] saints. These experiences, these deserts
[55:58] of experience, deserts are not oases.
[56:02] Deserts are not mountaintops.
[56:06] Deserts are not some glorious scenery.
[56:10] Deserts are where people die and die for
[56:13] thirst and burn their feet and searing
[56:17] deserts. These experiences
[56:20] because the prophet also knew where
[56:24] it'll take us.
[56:27] The squeeze and the pressure of distress
[56:29] on the message. I want to speak of that
[56:32] as well. So from Adam, the first Adam,
[56:35] Jesus, the second Adam, even the
[56:37] prophets of God,
[56:40] the Bible speaks of them and the
[56:43] pressure that is on us as individuals
[56:46] and the squeeze on the message. Let me
[56:48] say it at at this point also, if you are
[56:52] a believer and you are the word, you
[56:55] cannot expect that the message would be
[56:58] squeezed and you're not.
[57:02] You could not expect that the message
[57:04] will be disdained and hated and you're
[57:08] not.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus said they hated me, they'll hate
[57:11] you.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a believer and a
[57:14] follower of me.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; We can't expect that we're going to just
[57:19] go along and, you know, life's going to
[57:21] be great and all the rest of it. This
[57:23] has nothing to do about conditions. You
[57:25] know, things may be difficult
[57:27] economically. They may be great
[57:28] economic. That doesn't change the
[57:31] pressure that a person may feel and the
[57:33] forces. Remember the forces of this
[57:36] world and the prince and the power of
[57:38] the air is not for us. He's against us,
[57:43] &gt;&gt; against the word of God and is going to
[57:45] do everything he can to have you doubt
[57:47] and believe God's promises or believe
[57:50] that what's happening to you is actually
[57:52] for your benefit.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Glad you all agree.
[57:59] The Bible
[58:01] in these scriptures of which we read
[58:03] speaks of the ws of the devil
[58:07] and our light affliction
[58:10] and the trial of our faith
[58:13] in the three scriptures which we read.
[58:16] And we cannot equate the two, the ws of
[58:20] the devil with the trials and
[58:22] persecutions or the trials uh of our
[58:26] faith. Because the Bible, the Bible does
[58:29] not say the ws of the devil are more
[58:32] precious than gold. The Bible says that
[58:35] the trial of your faith is more precious
[58:37] than gold.
[58:42] more precious than gold that perisheth.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; I need you, this is a class this
[58:48] morning, but I need you to really hang
[58:50] on to that. Remember, gold that
[58:52] perisheth.
[58:54] The trial of your faith is much more
[58:56] precious than that of gold which
[58:58] perisheth.
[59:01] The trial,
[59:03] I'm getting ahead of myself, but the
[59:05] trial that you experience
[59:09] is like the gold that perisheth.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; The trial will disappear.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; But what God is working in you will
[59:19] remain.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; What God is working in you is going to
[59:23] carry you further forward in the plan of
[59:26] God.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and eventually birth you into a
[59:30] new world.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says if you want to know
[59:40] something, he said we'll have to go back
[59:41] to the beginning. So I just go back to
[59:43] the beginning for a moment. God is a
[59:45] spirit.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And as we spoke, this will tie into last
[59:48] week just a wee bit. And the first man,
[59:50] I'm abbreviating it and making it a
[59:52] short and going over it quickly, so
[59:54] you'll have to hang on. The first man
[59:56] was a spirit man.
[1:00:00] And then God brought that man down and
[1:00:02] placed the spirit man into the flesh.
[1:00:04] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[1:00:08] of the ground and breathed into his
[1:00:10] nostrils the breath of life. And man
[1:00:12] became a living soul. And God knew that
[1:00:14] from that flesh man he would take and
[1:00:17] separate the feminine part
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; and that the fall would come as a result
[1:00:22] of them being formed into flesh. And so
[1:00:25] now, but he didn't take the spirit man
[1:00:28] out.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; So now we have a spirit man in a flesh
[1:00:34] man that is not capable of fulfilling
[1:00:39] everything, all the attributes and all
[1:00:41] the character and all the desire. Now
[1:00:44] you'll understand it right away when you
[1:00:46] you there isn't a person here but what
[1:00:49] has been at a time when they you know
[1:00:51] you've gone to a funeral and and a loved
[1:00:54] one is laying here in the casket and you
[1:00:57] are meeting the family what are you
[1:00:58] going to say uh I'm so sorry your
[1:01:03] your spirit inside you can feel volumes
[1:01:10] you want to express volumes you come
[1:01:13] here into the house God said, you know,
[1:01:16] if I could just somehow release what's
[1:01:18] inside, if I could really say what's on
[1:01:21] the inside
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; in our family relations and and and our
[1:01:26] uh association with one another, we say,
[1:01:28] "Well, well, God bless you." But you'd
[1:01:30] like to There's volumes that I'd like to
[1:01:33] say. What is it? It's it's a spirit of
[1:01:36] God that is within us that can express
[1:01:40] so much more than the tongue can say,
[1:01:43] than the mind can think. And this body
[1:01:46] is a confinement. We're we're
[1:01:48] imprisoned.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says that God formed
[1:01:57] man. And the and the word formed is
[1:02:00] yatsar which is through the squeezing
[1:02:04] into shape
[1:02:07] and furthermore to be formed or
[1:02:09] fashioned or created in a frame
[1:02:14] to bind
[1:02:16] to be distressed or in distress
[1:02:20] I'm not talking about your trials now
[1:02:21] I'm talking about this frame to be to be
[1:02:25] cramped
[1:02:27] to make narrow or to be squeezed.
[1:02:34] And brother Brandham said in God's power
[1:02:36] to transform, but God is a spirit and
[1:02:40] the first man that he created was spirit
[1:02:42] man and he was in the image and in the
[1:02:45] likeness of God and then he put this man
[1:02:48] in flesh and man fell.
[1:02:53] So then God came down and became in the
[1:02:56] image of man that he might redeem that
[1:02:59] fallen man. Now you may have heard all
[1:03:02] of this long before I gave the same
[1:03:04] quote may feel as though oh but I'm
[1:03:06] going to ask you don't project it like
[1:03:08] well yeah I've heard all that I know
[1:03:10] exactly where you're going cuz I don't
[1:03:12] think you perhaps do know exactly where
[1:03:15] we're going this morning. So then God
[1:03:18] came down and become in the image of man
[1:03:21] that he might redeem the fallen man or
[1:03:23] the fallen flesh.
[1:03:27] That's the real gospel story to my
[1:03:29] opinion.
[1:03:31] When man fell, the spirit man
[1:03:35] became imprisoned. Now here I'm
[1:03:38] starting. When man fell,
[1:03:42] the spirit man became imprisoned,
[1:03:46] confined,
[1:03:48] trapped in a body of flesh.
[1:03:52] In this fallen state, he was not
[1:03:54] permitted to eat of the tree of life.
[1:03:59] All his qualities,
[1:04:01] his attributes,
[1:04:04] his authority, his power diminished.
[1:04:09] The spirit was still there.
[1:04:12] But all of these things that all these
[1:04:14] qualities and attributes of the spirit,
[1:04:16] that's why you feel what you feel. Say,
[1:04:19] "Oh God, if I could just oh for a
[1:04:21] thousand tongues
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; to give my father's praise." Listen
[1:04:28] friends, this is my message this morning
[1:04:30] when I come to an end, if I can come to
[1:04:32] an end, is that is where we're headed.
[1:04:37] you are headed. In fact, I want to tie
[1:04:39] together the very ministry we refer to
[1:04:42] as the message and the messenger and the
[1:04:45] prophet of this age and that there was
[1:04:47] no ministry like it is for this
[1:04:49] exclusive purpose to give you a hint of
[1:04:54] where you're going.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; When you had a messenger, your
[1:04:57] messenger, your prophet say I'm in two
[1:05:01] worlds. Scientists might call it another
[1:05:04] dimension. Can if you could only see
[1:05:06] what I'm looking at. I'm looking at uh
[1:05:09] I'm I'm looking at him.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ of Nazareth is right here.
[1:05:14] And I say to you that same one is right
[1:05:17] here because you are sitting here as
[1:05:19] evidence that I'm a believer of this
[1:05:22] message.
[1:05:24] And he came exclusively for the elect,
[1:05:27] for the believers of this message, so
[1:05:30] that they would have an indication of
[1:05:32] where they're headed.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And he would tell us at the same time
[1:05:37] the things that we suffer, the things
[1:05:39] that we endure, and you are simply
[1:05:42] experiencing the testing of the word.
[1:05:45] And he said, when the testing of this
[1:05:47] word is over, I'll read it for you
[1:05:48] later. When the testing of this word is
[1:05:50] over, then we go to that other body.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And that other body is being formed
[1:05:56] right now while you're believing his
[1:05:58] word.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; It's a word body. I don't understand
[1:06:02] this body. Neither do you.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; We don't understand the mystery of its
[1:06:06] forming.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; We don't understand the mystery of its
[1:06:10] coming together. Oh, we have pictures
[1:06:13] and all of these things, but ah, we
[1:06:15] don't understand it. We don't understand
[1:06:18] all the supernatural things that take
[1:06:20] place when a mother gives birth. And in
[1:06:23] the travail and in the constraint and in
[1:06:27] the restriction of birth, that child is
[1:06:30] coming from a place where it can't see
[1:06:32] anything and doesn't really breathe and
[1:06:35] it's coming into a whole new world
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; where it sees colors and smells flowers
[1:06:40] and sees sights and and can begin to
[1:06:43] express something. That's just this
[1:06:45] flesh.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; What about What about when this is
[1:06:49] released?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; That's why you're experiencing what
[1:06:54] you're experiencing. It's not a downer,
[1:06:57] it's an upper.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So in his fallen state, he was not
[1:07:06] permitted to eat of the tree of life.
[1:07:09] Prophet said he lost his original
[1:07:11] condition and brought the whole world
[1:07:14] subject to death. And in the bridge it
[1:07:17] says when he lost his life he also lost
[1:07:20] his inheritance in his life. See a
[1:07:24] person can lose their life but they may
[1:07:26] not have an inheritance.
[1:07:28] But Adam had an had an inheritance
[1:07:32] and he lost his inheritance when he lost
[1:07:34] his life also.
[1:07:37] In the angel of God message, he said he
[1:07:39] was the first one who had the
[1:07:41] jurisdiction
[1:07:43] over everything. He was the first one
[1:07:45] that had the jurisdiction over
[1:07:48] everything in the earth and he lost his
[1:07:51] power.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Now we can talk about what he lost. But
[1:07:58] now we have a a messenger who looked
[1:08:00] into two worlds, who was in two worlds,
[1:08:04] who was in another dimension, tells us
[1:08:06] about that dimension, tells us that
[1:08:09] every believer is going there. Do you
[1:08:13] believe that? I need to ask you.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And this messenger said, everything Adam
[1:08:21] lost has been brought back. We may not
[1:08:24] be able to exercise everything. This
[1:08:27] body may hold us back from it. Our minds
[1:08:30] can't comprehend it. That doesn't change
[1:08:32] the word. The word says everything he
[1:08:35] lost has been given back has been
[1:08:38] purchased back by Jesus Christ. And I
[1:08:40] want to stand here publicly and say I
[1:08:43] believe that.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And thus it is our light affliction.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Our light affliction. Why? Because that
[1:08:55] is the gold that perisheth.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; The light affliction. The Bible says our
[1:09:00] light affliction which is but for a
[1:09:03] moment workketh
[1:09:06] for us.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Your light affliction which you want to
[1:09:12] get rid of is working for you. Your
[1:09:15] light affliction is an employer
[1:09:17] employee.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; It's doing something for you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't really care for
[1:09:24] it." Well, I uh I went to school for a
[1:09:26] few years and I didn't I wasn't really
[1:09:28] in love with everything I had to do and
[1:09:31] all the restrictions and all the things
[1:09:34] of school and you know and a lot of kids
[1:09:38] why are they so happy when holidays come
[1:09:41] there's no school there's no confinement
[1:09:45] I'm imprisoned in this classroom
[1:09:48] at least we feel that way but when we're
[1:09:51] get out we finally say I got a diploma
[1:09:57] But what we went through to get it,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:10:02] All right.
[1:10:05] Can I keep going?
[1:10:09] He said that man was made as a secondary
[1:10:12] God on the earth.
[1:10:16] He was given the power to control
[1:10:18] things. All elements of the earth that
[1:10:21] was Adam.
[1:10:23] Now, I I I was sitting on on my horse on
[1:10:28] one of the hunts with brother Brandham.
[1:10:33] And now some people may not understand
[1:10:35] that. I'm not going to try to make you
[1:10:37] understand it. There are many today that
[1:10:40] are waiting for brother Brandham to come
[1:10:42] and because he said they they said that
[1:10:44] there's a vision of a large bear which
[1:10:46] he didn't get and no vision can fail. I
[1:10:51] saw that bear and that's perfectly fine
[1:10:54] if he comes back and gets it because I
[1:10:56] will be there for sure and God's gonna
[1:10:58] have to do something in that bear to
[1:11:00] make it young again. But anyway,
[1:11:05] we came into a storm
[1:11:08] right the day after I saw this bear.
[1:11:11] Came into the storm.
[1:11:13] One day we sit in our tent. Two days we
[1:11:16] sit in our tent. Three days we sit in
[1:11:18] our tent. Four days rain, rain, storm,
[1:11:23] just socked in.
[1:11:26] And we decide to leave. The horses are
[1:11:29] wet. All the tent is wet and heavy. And
[1:11:32] you that hunt and camp, you know what
[1:11:34] this is all about. It's just plain ugly.
[1:11:38] And the horses are miserable. And we're
[1:11:40] miserable. And brother Bud was packing
[1:11:43] them up, and he's miserable. And it's
[1:11:46] just nasty.
[1:11:48] Uh and and Brother Bam came out and he
[1:11:50] said, "Brother Bud, how long will we
[1:11:52] be?" Oh, he said, "Uh, oh, we got you
[1:11:57] got lots of time." He said, "We're going
[1:11:58] to be a while here, a couple hours or
[1:12:01] more." He came over to me. He says,
[1:12:03] "Brother Eddie," he said, "Uh, this is
[1:12:07] on account of me."
[1:12:09] Said, "I knew better. I was supposed to
[1:12:11] be with those little fellows." and he
[1:12:13] and brother Bud went one direction and
[1:12:15] Billy Paul, brother Blaine and myself
[1:12:18] went another direction
[1:12:20] and brother Bud sent us that way
[1:12:23] and uh he said this is on account of me
[1:12:26] and I won't say everything he said but
[1:12:28] he said u he said where'd you see that
[1:12:31] bear so I told him exactly and he he
[1:12:34] left and he come back a while later
[1:12:38] and uh I was I was sitting there and he
[1:12:41] said he walked up to Let me put his
[1:12:42] finger up like this. Now, you have to
[1:12:45] understand,
[1:12:47] you people in Vancouver, in the
[1:12:48] Northwest, you understand what it is
[1:12:50] when a socked in. I mean, there it's not
[1:12:54] clouds. It's just socked in.
[1:12:58] And this man comes up, Brother Brandham
[1:13:00] comes up and he says, "This is over
[1:13:02] and we'll ride out of here dry.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Dry.
[1:13:08] We're
[1:13:10] We are in a rainclose
[1:13:13] and just uh the distance from here even
[1:13:15] to the doors is where the bush and the
[1:13:19] willows thick willows are. And you're
[1:13:22] not going to go through those willows
[1:13:25] even for 3 minutes without be soaking to
[1:13:28] your hide unless you got rain clothes
[1:13:31] on. Is this drenched?
[1:13:34] And I'm still sitting there about 15 20
[1:13:37] minutes later. Her blood is still
[1:13:38] packing the horses and it just exactly
[1:13:41] it just
[1:13:44] by in front of me a warm wind. I thought
[1:13:46] where'd that come from? And I just kind
[1:13:49] of look, you know, that was so warm.
[1:13:53] And then uh uh and a little while later,
[1:13:56] you know, this blew a wee bit and there
[1:13:59] was warm wind. I thought, my that's
[1:14:01] nice. And uh it wasn't it wasn't 10 or
[1:14:05] 15 minutes and a big hole appeared in
[1:14:08] the sky and the sun sun was shining
[1:14:11] straight through and I just looked up
[1:14:12] like that looked straight through the
[1:14:13] blue sky and before before our horse my
[1:14:17] horse took a step. The sky was totally
[1:14:21] blue and we rode out in shirt sleeves
[1:14:26] dry
[1:14:28] and warm. Now I tell you what friends,
[1:14:31] if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't be
[1:14:34] here preaching.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; When a person says, "We'll ride out dry
[1:14:40] and I had w dried out. I had rode out
[1:14:43] soaked to the hide," it'd be a different
[1:14:46] kind of a preaching.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; That's why I can say, "Thus sayaith the
[1:14:51] Lord,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I saw and you believe it." And you have
[1:14:56] to believe what the word of God says
[1:14:58] that his righteousness, he has taken all
[1:15:01] of our sins. He's replaced it with all
[1:15:03] of his righteousness. He said, "I go to
[1:15:06] prepare a place for you." And what we're
[1:15:08] experiencing here is simply molding us
[1:15:11] and shaping us for that place.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And we had demonstrated here that same
[1:15:20] power. Adam had power over the elements.
[1:15:24] And now we have a message and a
[1:15:26] messenger demonstrated and a few
[1:15:29] witnesses that can still declare we saw
[1:15:32] the weather change.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; We don't just have to hear about
[1:15:35] something in Colorado. We had it right
[1:15:37] in British Columbia. We've had it in the
[1:15:39] United States. We've had it in Canada.
[1:15:42] And I don't say that's the only time
[1:15:43] it's ever happened. Maybe happened for
[1:15:45] you and a special moment. But I want to
[1:15:48] say to this congregation,
[1:15:51] if you could only see beyond this little
[1:15:54] veil of flesh for a few moments, it
[1:15:57] would change your life forever.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Brother Brandham says
[1:16:11] things that I don't think we'll live
[1:16:13] long enough to really fully understand.
[1:16:16] And this is one of the statements and I
[1:16:17] start to read just where I was. Man was
[1:16:19] made as a secondary God on earth. He was
[1:16:23] given the power to control all things,
[1:16:25] all elements of the earth. That was
[1:16:28] Adam. Adam was given, now listen to
[1:16:30] this, Adam was given these great powers.
[1:16:35] But then the power that he was given to
[1:16:39] make himself
[1:16:43] is where he fell.
[1:16:46] He couldn't bring forth himself in his
[1:16:50] original condition.
[1:16:52] He could bring forth an able, but he
[1:16:55] couldn't bring forth himself in his
[1:16:58] original condition. He lost his power to
[1:17:02] bring forth himself.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You're wondering
[1:17:09] God who gave him that power. God brought
[1:17:13] forth himself in Jesus Christ.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a sexual birth.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; He brought forth himself.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Adam lost the power to bring forth
[1:17:30] himself.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He could not bring forth another Adam in
[1:17:35] his original condition.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Now it was a the whole enterprise was
[1:17:40] fallen.
[1:17:43] Are you with me?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And so God stay now close. So God took
[1:17:49] the same elements of which he made
[1:17:51] Adam's body and brought forth himself
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; so that he could take those elements
[1:18:00] through to the curse
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; which was death
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; and go through death and bring back and
[1:18:07] they went to the tomb to see the body
[1:18:09] and it wasn't there because he had
[1:18:12] changed those elements
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; and brought them forth into another body
[1:18:20] which could never suffer, could never go
[1:18:23] to the cross, would never have to pay
[1:18:26] for sin again. That's where you are
[1:18:29] going.
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; That's the program.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; And he came in the body of the elements
[1:18:42] of this flesh. Jesus had a body like you
[1:18:45] had a body. But he suffered.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; He was betrayed.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; He was accused.
[1:18:54] He went through all sort of things. He
[1:18:56] gained friends. He lost friends.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said in what I
[1:19:02] believe was his squeeze in the seventh
[1:19:05] seal,
[1:19:07] this will cause 10,000
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; of my friends to leave me.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's a squeeze, friends. if you lose a
[1:19:17] friend or two friends, but when you lose
[1:19:19] a entire association of of entire
[1:19:23] churches and support of thousands of
[1:19:25] people, I'm not talking about financial
[1:19:27] support. I'm talking about the support
[1:19:29] of people who who believe in you and
[1:19:32] love you and follow the message and
[1:19:35] follow you and then begin to say, "Ah,
[1:19:37] he went off and and he's gone into false
[1:19:39] doctrine and he never should have been
[1:19:41] teaching. He should have just stayed
[1:19:43] with the gift and all kinds of things."
[1:19:45] and 10,000 friends leave, don't tell me
[1:19:49] it's not a squeeze.
[1:19:51] And if you believe the same message that
[1:19:54] he spoke, you will experience the same
[1:19:57] squeeze.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And if you think that we're going to go
[1:20:00] through this and just enter into some
[1:20:03] happy uh land uh you know, heavenly
[1:20:07] place with no obstacles, you're
[1:20:09] mistaken.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; But they are for your benefit.
[1:20:16] They are precious trials.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; It says now that was in the beginning of
[1:20:29] man. That's what God gave him power over
[1:20:33] everything on the earth. Now though he
[1:20:37] fell, though he fell, he lost that
[1:20:39] power. Then when he lost the power then
[1:20:42] he became becomes unconscious to the
[1:20:45] fact unconscious to the fact after
[1:20:50] losing his relationship and friendship
[1:20:53] and fellowship with the father he
[1:20:54] becomes unconscious.
[1:20:56] Then he lost that and all of his great
[1:21:00] channels became clogged up and he
[1:21:03] couldn't get through. God sends a
[1:21:06] message to unclog those channels
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; so that you can get through
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; and bring us to be conscious again.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; We were unconscious
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; to what God had done for us. But I thank
[1:21:23] God for this message that has brought a
[1:21:26] consciousness back and we're coming
[1:21:28] alive and we're able to say, "Praise God
[1:21:31] and worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; because we're conscious again."
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; It's a little girl. She was shot in the
[1:21:43] head uh because she wanted to go to
[1:21:46] school uh and the Islam extremist shot
[1:21:51] her in the head and she just coming to
[1:21:54] and her father was sitting beside her
[1:21:56] and they were just so ecstatic because
[1:21:58] she's trying now to speak.
[1:22:02] I'll tell you what, God,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; his heart is filled with joy because now
[1:22:08] he's sent his prophet word back to the
[1:22:11] people. And there's a people who have
[1:22:14] regained consciousness again and begin
[1:22:16] to know what kind of worship is
[1:22:19] acceptable to God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:22] Hallelujah. I'm calling and speaking to
[1:22:25] our people who have become conscious
[1:22:26] again. You've been unconscious of what
[1:22:29] God's program was. And now maybe you can
[1:22:32] say it. And if you can't, you need to
[1:22:34] hang in there until you can say, "I see
[1:22:36] it. I see it. I'm getting my vision
[1:22:39] back. I'm getting my speech back. Glory
[1:22:43] to God. I'm getting my understanding
[1:22:46] back. My brain that was dead has become
[1:22:49] alive again."
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this.
[1:22:57] Don't forget this message.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; This is taking you from Genesis to
[1:23:01] Revelation.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; This is the program of God.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; God went back.
[1:23:13] He says what Godam was in God, what Adam
[1:23:17] was in God,
[1:23:20] Christ has redeemed us back to that.
[1:23:25] I would like you to hear that and not
[1:23:27] take me as a reader of that quote. But
[1:23:31] if you believe that quote, I'd like to
[1:23:33] hear you acknowledge it.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; What Adam was in God, Christ has
[1:23:40] redeemed back has redeemed us back to
[1:23:44] that.
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:52] Now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:23:55] bring it back to its origin again.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That is why the apostle Paul says these
[1:24:01] are precious these are precious trials
[1:24:05] more precious than gold which perisheth.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; This body will perish.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; The gold will perish.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; But that which it is accomplishing will
[1:24:19] live forever.
[1:24:22] So God went back before the beginning
[1:24:24] with the spoken word
[1:24:29] prophesied. Number one, he prophesied of
[1:24:31] redemption through Jesus Christ.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Number two, he created the spoken word
[1:24:37] of his promise, a seed in the womb of
[1:24:40] Mary.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And see, that seed only came to the womb
[1:24:44] of Mary because it was already a spoken
[1:24:46] word by the prophets. a virgin shall
[1:24:49] conceive as part of the program. Number
[1:24:53] three, he came forth in a body of flesh
[1:24:56] just like we did.
[1:24:59] So up till now, he is exactly like us.
[1:25:04] He's come in a body of flesh like we
[1:25:06] did. Even though he came from a virgin
[1:25:08] birth, virgin seed, seed from God, he
[1:25:12] was born like we are born. He got tired
[1:25:16] like you get tired.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; He wept like you weep.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; He got weary.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He experienced all the feelings that we
[1:25:26] experience.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; He was tempted in all points like you
[1:25:31] are.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; People get Jesus on a pedestal, but he
[1:25:37] wasn't like you. He was like you. And
[1:25:39] that was important.
[1:25:42] And he came forth in a body of flesh
[1:25:44] like we did. He took that body to the
[1:25:47] death of the cross like we it's
[1:25:49] appointed unto man once to die. I say it
[1:25:52] to the boys. I say it to the girls. I
[1:25:55] say it to the young couples. I say it to
[1:25:57] the aged. Unless we would have a change
[1:25:59] in the body. We are all appointed unto
[1:26:02] death. It's appointed un man once to die
[1:26:05] and after this the judgment. But Jesus
[1:26:08] did something else after death. He came
[1:26:11] back
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; in another body.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And if you are living your life and
[1:26:20] being educated and working for a living
[1:26:22] and going through this life without that
[1:26:24] as your objective, you're wasting your
[1:26:26] time.
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Go eat, drink, and be married for
[1:26:31] tomorrow we die.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; If everybody's going to die and go down
[1:26:35] into a six-foot hole, what's the
[1:26:37] difference whether it's sooner or later?
[1:26:42] Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; But he took that that body that body
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; to the death of the cross
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; and he rose victorious
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; with a body that did walk.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; A body that did talk.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; A body that did listen and carried on a
[1:27:03] conversation. And a body that ate. And a
[1:27:06] body that could be handled. but a body
[1:27:08] that could vanish.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a body that could ascend
[1:27:15] into the heavens.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he had that kind of
[1:27:19] body?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Have a look at your body.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; It's not very great. You can pretty it
[1:27:24] up and whatever more. I I uh Brother
[1:27:27] Brandham talks about he was in a museum
[1:27:30] and he saw the the a bunch of young
[1:27:32] people looking at the at a figure of a
[1:27:35] man or something 150 pounds and great
[1:27:39] strong young man.
[1:27:42] And it said on there he was worth 84
[1:27:44] cents.
[1:27:46] And that was based on 3.71%
[1:27:49] inflation.
[1:27:51] And I took and worked that back to 62
[1:27:54] years.
[1:27:56] That was a lengthy
[1:27:58] time of work for me.
[1:28:01] And I figured he's worth seven and 3/4
[1:28:04] cents
[1:28:06] today.
[1:28:07] Hello, young man full of muscles and
[1:28:09] all. I say 7 and 12 cents of it.
[1:28:13] 7 and 3/4 cents. You young ladies, I
[1:28:16] hope you're not 150 pounds or you might
[1:28:18] be that. It might be more. You just have
[1:28:20] more to have. Beautiful, that's all. But
[1:28:22] you're worth 7 and 3/4 cents.
[1:28:25] And found some calculations said maybe
[1:28:28] even up to 12 cents. Isn't that great?
[1:28:32] Maybe that's some country didn't have as
[1:28:34] much inflation.
[1:28:35] And so you put a nice hat on or a suit
[1:28:38] on or nice scarf and get all fixed up.
[1:28:41] And don't forget, you're walking into
[1:28:44] this church with about seven and 3/4
[1:28:46] cents. And if you happen to come from a
[1:28:49] good country, you might be worth 10
[1:28:50] cents.
[1:28:54] 10 cents walking out of here. Not very
[1:28:56] much, folks.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; And if we carry on the way we're going,
[1:29:00] we're going to be below water.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Young ladies, do you like what I'm
[1:29:09] saying?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; What am I worth?
[1:29:14] The same prophet says, "Your soul is
[1:29:18] worth 10,000 worlds."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; God's got 10,000 worlds in 10 cents
[1:29:29] worth of flesh.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You talk about gold that perisheth. And
[1:29:36] your trial, where's your trial gone when
[1:29:38] you're gone? It's gone. Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to disappear.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; What is your trial? Nothing.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; It's not even worth 10 cents. You say,
[1:29:48] "Oh, brother Biscll, if you only know,
[1:29:50] you listen to me."
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Your trial is issuing you, distressing
[1:29:58] you, and pushing you through a narrow
[1:30:00] spot called this life
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; to put you into that place.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And every demon of hell is coming
[1:30:08] against it. But God is determined to
[1:30:11] take you to it.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Don't forget when Jesus was being
[1:30:19] squeezed a man of sorrows and acquainted
[1:30:22] with grief and the and and and brother
[1:30:24] Brandon talks about him being the lily
[1:30:26] and he was just crushed until that opium
[1:30:30] would come forth from that lily. Don't
[1:30:33] forget you were there.
[1:30:35] You were there
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; and he had to be squeezed so that he
[1:30:40] could issue into a new body.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; It was that squeezing and that crushing
[1:30:45] that put him into a new body and you
[1:30:48] went into it with him.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Does this sound like it's dream world or
[1:31:00] over your head? No. I'm sure this is
[1:31:03] very simple and fundamental and some of
[1:31:06] us our our circumstance and our
[1:31:08] situation in our life might make it
[1:31:11] difficult for us to believe it. I say
[1:31:13] you don't have an option.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; You must believe it.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It is the only hope for the believer.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; This is not brother Ed's ideas. This is
[1:31:26] the word as clear as it can be.
[1:31:32] So he rose victorious
[1:31:35] in a new body. Bringing the elements of
[1:31:39] the body back.
[1:31:42] Listen. Bringing the elements of the
[1:31:45] body
[1:31:46] is God took of the clay and formed a
[1:31:51] body and breathed that spirit man into
[1:31:56] him.
[1:31:58] And he was god of the earth.
[1:32:05] Then the fall.
[1:32:09] Jesus came in a body back and took those
[1:32:13] same elements and restored them back to
[1:32:17] their original purpose in God's mind. A
[1:32:21] body that cannot fall. A body that
[1:32:24] cannot come into unbelief. the body. He
[1:32:28] brought forth the same elements back to
[1:32:31] prefall
[1:32:32] condition
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; and that's where we're going.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And I don't care how it happens or
[1:32:41] exactly when it happens. It'll happen in
[1:32:43] God's. But this is the program.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; This is the program.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why angels are, you know, we
[1:32:51] think angels in attendance and so on.
[1:32:53] That's why they're here because God has
[1:32:55] dispatched them.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Dispatch them to be by your side.
[1:33:00] Encourage them. Influence them. Cause
[1:33:03] them to feel your nearness.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; My own spirit will overshadow them. Seek
[1:33:10] to come into the service and overshadow
[1:33:13] them until they can be without question
[1:33:15] that it's God
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; that's amongst them.
[1:33:20] I sent them a prophet who stood be in
[1:33:23] front of them and said, "Uh, you wonder
[1:33:25] what I'm looking at? I'm looking at
[1:33:27] him."
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Where was he
[1:33:32] in the building?
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; If I could get you to believe, I could
[1:33:36] say, "All things are possible to them
[1:33:38] that believe these things, and nothing
[1:33:41] shall be impossible to them that believe
[1:33:43] it." Is this God's word?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Is this the Bible?
[1:33:49] We're not just living here for a better
[1:33:51] job, for a better school, for a diploma.
[1:33:54] Well, that has nothing to do with that's
[1:33:56] worth 10 cents.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not even worried about people being
[1:34:01] delivered out of their problems or out
[1:34:03] of their trouble or out of their country
[1:34:05] or whatever more it is. It's only worth
[1:34:08] a few cents. But what God is seeking to
[1:34:11] do with this message you believe is to
[1:34:14] issue issue you with distress and pain
[1:34:18] of birth into a new world.
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:25] And this message is here and that's why
[1:34:26] we're preaching such you say well we've
[1:34:28] heard that that might be even before
[1:34:31] this evening's service
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; and you need this kind you in fact is
[1:34:37] your soul is calling for this message
[1:34:40] and this kind of preaching.
[1:34:49] So I said earlier, the Bible speaks of
[1:34:51] the ws of the devil. Why? Because he's
[1:34:54] got you targeted.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do everything in my power
[1:34:58] to get them to disbelieve or get them to
[1:35:01] hear something so they will doubt it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you surrender up your faith.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; People if they want to disbelieve, it's
[1:35:10] up to them.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; If they want to have some other scheme,
[1:35:13] that's up to them. But don't you
[1:35:15] disbelieve this word. And there is no
[1:35:19] message and no person that I have ever
[1:35:22] found that God has vindicated like this
[1:35:25] message and say you want to just say I'm
[1:35:28] staying with the vindicated word of God
[1:35:31] and you do what you want with it. And I
[1:35:34] have brother Brandham's quote where he
[1:35:35] says now there it is. You do what you
[1:35:38] want with it.
[1:35:40] Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; So our light affliction workketh for us
[1:35:46] and the trial of our faith is much more
[1:35:48] precious than gold that perisheth.
[1:35:53] The scripture says,
[1:35:55] "Who are kept by the power of God
[1:35:58] through faith unto salvation,
[1:36:01] ready to be revealed in the last time,
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; wherein
[1:36:06] you greatly rejoice?
[1:36:09] Because we're to be revealed in the last
[1:36:11] time, we are we greatly re rejoice.
[1:36:14] Though now for a season,
[1:36:17] if need be, may not be everyone. If need
[1:36:21] be, you are in heaviness
[1:36:25] through manifold many temptations,
[1:36:30] that the trial of your faith, being much
[1:36:33] more precious than that of gold that
[1:36:35] perisheth, though it be tried with fire,
[1:36:39] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:36:42] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:46] That's when the purpose of the trial
[1:36:47] will be made known.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] and for a season if it need be.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we, you know,
[1:36:57] slug it out under incredible crushing
[1:36:59] burdens all the time, but when they
[1:37:02] come, and they will, then you know how
[1:37:05] to take them. I got my eye at the end. I
[1:37:08] see the end of this. I see the objective
[1:37:11] of God.
[1:37:23] now
[1:37:25] conditions and pressures of our time.
[1:37:28] And brother Brandon said this was a
[1:37:29] pressure age
[1:37:34] and some of you may not be experiencing
[1:37:38] it right now. Don't worry, you will. and
[1:37:41] others may appear not to have any
[1:37:46] and they have plenty or even more.
[1:37:49] Don't let me dwell on that, but I feel
[1:37:52] that's essential.
[1:37:55] He said, "Now this body, listen closely.
[1:37:59] I'm going to go slow. Now this body is
[1:38:02] subject to the spirit." This body is
[1:38:06] subject to the spirit.
[1:38:08] have not yet entered into the word form.
[1:38:12] This body is subject to the spirit. Have
[1:38:15] not yet entered into the word form, but
[1:38:18] we are still in the flesh form, but
[1:38:21] subject to the word. That's why you need
[1:38:24] to be here at church.
[1:38:26] That's why you need to hear the
[1:38:28] preaching of the word.
[1:38:36] Death in the flesh will take us there.
[1:38:42] How many here
[1:38:44] has had someone
[1:38:48] in your immediate family
[1:38:51] die
[1:38:53] and you went to their hold your hand up
[1:38:55] high, would you please?
[1:39:07] The Bible says
[1:39:10] that death is the last enemy.
[1:39:15] And I don't think there's any one of you
[1:39:17] that raised your hand that would say, "I
[1:39:20] found it a a a wonderful uh it was a
[1:39:24] friendly time and it was so wonderful."
[1:39:28] No, we were separated.
[1:39:32] We We perhaps didn't even understand it.
[1:39:35] I was the age of one of these boys. No
[1:39:37] doubt. I remember it like it was
[1:39:40] yesterday. I won't go into it. That's
[1:39:43] not why I'm here.
[1:39:46] It's an enemy.
[1:39:48] And the last enemy to be destroyed is
[1:39:51] death.
[1:39:54] And even even death with its reality,
[1:39:58] it's a squeezing.
[1:40:00] It's a distressing time.
[1:40:06] I'm going to preach.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Our brethren in the world, the scripture
[1:40:10] says, experience the same things.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; But to them, it's a hopelessness. It's
[1:40:15] an end. It's a great dark tunnel. It's a
[1:40:20] nowhere. We're going nowhere. But to the
[1:40:23] believer, to the elect, that that is the
[1:40:25] last of the squeeze, the last of the
[1:40:28] pressure on this flesh. And this flesh
[1:40:31] gives in and surrenders and the call and
[1:40:34] the purpose of God and the testimony
[1:40:37] that person lived as the elect of Jesus
[1:40:40] Christ. They die in the faith. And their
[1:40:42] faith is greater than death itself.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And they will rise in a new body.
[1:40:49] They'll rise. They heard the word all
[1:40:51] the time. And they were faithful to the
[1:40:53] word. They believed the word and they
[1:40:55] will rise to a word body. What kind of
[1:40:58] body? I don't know. I don't care. The
[1:40:59] prophet said it. If thus sayeth the
[1:41:02] Lord. And just like I couldn't
[1:41:03] understand this body when I was still in
[1:41:05] my father's uh in his loins. I don't I
[1:41:09] couldn't understand this body. Now I'm
[1:41:11] in it. And I still don't understand it.
[1:41:13] I don't understand why it gets stronger,
[1:41:15] why it gets weaker. All of these things.
[1:41:17] I don't understand it, but I believe it.
[1:41:25] And this body and God has allowed the
[1:41:28] trials and he who is the God of this
[1:41:31] evil age to encircle you and to do all
[1:41:34] kinds of things and to create obstacles
[1:41:37] and everything else so that God can
[1:41:39] prove that that life that is in you by
[1:41:42] predestination will only be improved by
[1:41:45] those struggles.
[1:41:49] not be overcome but will overcome them
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; even though now for a season we may
[1:41:56] experience these things. Are you staying
[1:41:58] with me?
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; He says and then when this robe of flesh
[1:42:07] is dropped
[1:42:10] I'm not going to keep you long today. So
[1:42:12] just I just want your attention. When
[1:42:14] this robe of flesh is dropped, there is
[1:42:18] a natural body
[1:42:20] theophony,
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; a body not made with hands, neither born
[1:42:25] of a woman that we go to. That we go to.
[1:42:28] Let me hear everybody say that we go to.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That we go to.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't hear it loud enough. That we go
[1:42:34] to.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I want to hear you say that I go to.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That I go.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; There is a body that I go to. Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; When the body of this flesh is dropped,
[1:42:45] there's a body I go to.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Not made with hands and not born of a
[1:42:50] woman, it is a word body.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; It's the same kind. Jesus demonstrated
[1:42:56] that body when he came out of the grave.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Handle me. I'm not a spirit.
[1:43:02] Handle me."
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:07] And men, brethren, like us, handled the
[1:43:09] body that we go to.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; For the scripture says he will give us a
[1:43:15] glorious body like unto his glorious
[1:43:18] body.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And let me say something further so that
[1:43:21] you don't disconnect it. And that is why
[1:43:24] God sent a prophet who could stand on
[1:43:27] the pull at the platform in front of the
[1:43:30] multitudes and say to you who are locked
[1:43:33] in this physical frame, I'm looking at
[1:43:36] him.
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends,
[1:43:43] I'm so moved. I would just like to go to
[1:43:46] my study and bury my head and thank him.
[1:43:51] It's so real.
[1:43:53] It's so real.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; And to think that God Almighty, he
[1:43:58] didn't have to do it, but he did it for
[1:44:00] you and he did it for me.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't take this
[1:44:06] lightly.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; I'm having respect for the message and
[1:44:12] what's being preached.
[1:44:20] And he said that we go to
[1:44:22] then
[1:44:24] then this is the program then that body
[1:44:28] talking about yours and mine that we're
[1:44:31] going to this one came from a natural
[1:44:34] birth. The other one came from a
[1:44:36] spiritual birth. We're talking about the
[1:44:38] spirit world. We were born again by the
[1:44:42] spirit of God.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; By the word of God. And by the spirit,
[1:44:46] the spirit came to the word. And thus,
[1:44:48] we became alive, a new person in Christ
[1:44:52] Jesus.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get it lost in the phrases of
[1:44:57] born again. All these world talks about
[1:44:59] born again. Forget it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Just think what a messenger has said
[1:45:03] about the new birth.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And then we're born again, a spirit man.
[1:45:09] He says, "Then the body returns back and
[1:45:12] picks up the glorified body." And that's
[1:45:15] the reason Jesus went to hell when he
[1:45:18] died and preached to the souls that were
[1:45:21] in prison.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; In prison,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; they're locked into another kind of a
[1:45:27] framework
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; that they cannot get out of.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; They can repent and pray, but never get
[1:45:33] out of that prison. Oh, aren't you
[1:45:36] thankful to God that while you're
[1:45:38] imprisoned in this body of flesh, you
[1:45:40] were able to hear the gospel of Jesus
[1:45:42] Christ that overcome this prison and
[1:45:46] broke the bars. Amen.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I think of Dy Rambo's song.
[1:45:55] This house of clay
[1:45:58] is but a prison
[1:46:00] and bars of bone
[1:46:03] hold my soul. But the doors of clay are
[1:46:06] going to burst wide open. When the angel
[1:46:09] sets my spirit free, I'll take my flight
[1:46:14] like a mighty angel. when the hills of
[1:46:17] home start calling me and I will say as
[1:46:20] a public declaration over this pulpit
[1:46:23] and to all who hear me, the angel has
[1:46:26] already come and the bursts of the the
[1:46:29] doors of the of the doors of bone and
[1:46:32] the have burst open and the soul and the
[1:46:35] spirit that God has placed in there has
[1:46:38] come out and with the faith to believe
[1:46:41] what the old Ed Visal could not believe.
[1:46:44] And today I believe it.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; And today I cannot disbelieve it.
[1:46:49] There's no capacity in me. I hear
[1:46:52] everything everybody is saying. And this
[1:46:54] world is so filled and so vulgar and so
[1:46:58] unclean. We are we're we're not made for
[1:47:01] it.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to this congregation?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not mad. I'm serious.
[1:47:15] And he returned to the souls that were
[1:47:17] in prison
[1:47:20] and preached to the souls that were in
[1:47:22] prison and turned back into that
[1:47:24] theophony. Oh, marvelous. He said,
[1:47:27] "Thank God. We may not understand. I
[1:47:30] tell you what, if we had a prophet, we
[1:47:32] could understand everything he said. It
[1:47:34] wouldn't be much of a prophet.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Read it. read the book of Ezekiel and
[1:47:39] come and tell me and write a write a
[1:47:42] thesis on it.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they'll put you in a
[1:47:46] loony boony bin.
[1:47:50] It's come from inspiration of God.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; And then he speaks of the he goes on to
[1:47:56] say the earthly body be dissolved.
[1:47:59] This earthly tabernacle we have another.
[1:48:02] So we have bypassed that to come
[1:48:04] straight from God.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:07] And then he he quotes that scripture and
[1:48:09] then he says then we become the word.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Here we are formed to the word image to
[1:48:16] be a partaker of the word feed on the
[1:48:19] word by being predestinated since the
[1:48:22] beginning.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Then we become the word
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; because even the traces of this body are
[1:48:28] gone.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:35] Jesus said,
[1:48:37] now we talk about him for a moment.
[1:48:40] Jesus said in Luke 12:50,
[1:48:44] "But I have a baptism to be baptized
[1:48:46] with,
[1:48:49] and how am I straightened
[1:48:52] straight in a straight?" How am I
[1:48:54] straightened until it be accomplished? I
[1:48:57] have a baptism.
[1:48:59] He asked the disciples. They wanted so
[1:49:02] much to follow him. He said, "Are ye
[1:49:05] able to drink the cup that I drink and
[1:49:07] be baptized with the baptism? Are you
[1:49:10] willing to enter up into enter the
[1:49:11] straits?"
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you're in the straight.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Every time you go to Victoria, cross the
[1:49:18] straight of Wanda Fuca or the straight
[1:49:20] of Georgia or something. What is it?
[1:49:23] It's a whole ocean coming into a narrow
[1:49:25] place.
[1:49:27] You have a whole ocean.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; A whole ocean.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; A whole ocean of the almighty God.
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; That has put you down and has put a part
[1:49:41] of himself into you. And that is why you
[1:49:45] feel so constrained and so restricted
[1:49:48] and oh, I'd like to just burst out of
[1:49:51] this.
[1:50:05] You're quiet. And I know why you're
[1:50:06] quiet. Because I've hitten the nail on
[1:50:08] the head.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Every person is that way.
[1:50:16] Sometimes I get disappointed with
[1:50:17] myself. I can't express myself to my
[1:50:20] wife, so I don't say anything.
[1:50:25] And they say, "Well,
[1:50:29] some say you should tell your wife that
[1:50:30] you love her every morning."
[1:50:33] Well,
[1:50:36] that might be okay, but I say don't say
[1:50:37] it unless you really mean it. And not
[1:50:40] likely as every morning.
[1:50:43] Said, "Don't just feel like it." There's
[1:50:45] one time when you should do it, even if
[1:50:46] you don't feel like it. Now you come
[1:50:48] into the church and and and David said,
[1:50:50] "I will say to my soul,
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord."
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He tells his soul, "You do
[1:50:57] it.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel and I'm
[1:51:00] disregarding this body." You say it
[1:51:02] anyway.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; So let us say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody in here say, "I don't
[1:51:09] feel like it." Because God doesn't care
[1:51:11] how you feel. I don't care how you feel.
[1:51:14] It's the devils that are trying to work
[1:51:15] on it.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; He he spoke of Jesus Christ the lily of
[1:51:27] the valley. Let me just go for a little
[1:51:29] bit more and I'm I'm not going to be too
[1:51:31] long now.
[1:51:35] He says, "And how am I straightened
[1:51:38] till it be accomplished?" And
[1:51:41] straightened is here's what it is. It is
[1:51:43] to be pressed on every side. Has anybody
[1:51:47] here felt like that?
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Like a straight forces a ship into a
[1:51:52] narrow channel. Like a cattle squeeze
[1:51:55] pushing in on each side. Forcing the
[1:51:58] beast into a position where it cannot
[1:52:00] move. To completely, i.e. to hold fast a
[1:52:04] prisoner to constrain to be held with to
[1:52:08] be afflicted with to be suffering from.
[1:52:12] This is what it is. I'm in a straight
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; and I can't move from it.
[1:52:19] I must do it.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And even as I said last week when he
[1:52:24] came to the garden, he asked the
[1:52:27] disciples, "Could you wait with me?"
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; He even desired he was a man.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Could you wait with me
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and watch with me? And they were unable.
[1:52:40] And he said, "Father, if it be possible,
[1:52:43] let this cup pass from me,
[1:52:47] but nevertheless, not my will, but thine
[1:52:49] be done."
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; He was formed. You might you might
[1:52:57] wonder why I'm taking so much of this
[1:52:58] service because we need to hear it
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; and it will help us to take the whimper
[1:53:07] away.
[1:53:10] I do not like the trials and
[1:53:12] persecutions. You do not like the trials
[1:53:15] and persecutions.
[1:53:17] Now, these are not the ws of the devil.
[1:53:19] The ws of the devil you withstand.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting and struggling and
[1:53:24] he's trying to get me to disbelieve.
[1:53:26] He's trying to get me to doubt the
[1:53:28] promise of God. I refuse him. I reject
[1:53:31] him and I resist him. He's trying to put
[1:53:34] an affliction on me. It's not from God.
[1:53:36] I resist him. I'm going to abide by the
[1:53:40] word of God. Is that all right?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; But Jesus was squeezed under pressure.
[1:53:46] And that is to be like a man of sorrows.
[1:53:50] I've said a a man with a sense of
[1:53:53] infinitely greater capacity. Notice
[1:53:56] Jesus was God in the flesh. No one has
[1:54:01] really fully experienced. He was the
[1:54:04] fullness of the godhead bodily.
[1:54:08] In him
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; was the power to speak universes into
[1:54:14] existence. A man that walked here on the
[1:54:17] same soil. If you believe that Bible, if
[1:54:20] you don't believe that, you better pitch
[1:54:22] the Bible away. That's what it is. He
[1:54:24] was God in the flesh.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; And people could not believe he was God
[1:54:30] in the flesh. He who spoke worlds into
[1:54:33] existence.
[1:54:34] You realize the tree that he hung on,
[1:54:38] his own word brought forth that tree.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; His own word brought forth the iron that
[1:54:45] made the nails that held him there. He
[1:54:48] could have called for 10,000 angels or
[1:54:52] millions if he'd wanted to. He could
[1:54:54] have destroyed the world and started all
[1:54:57] over again. But he was hanging there.
[1:55:00] And you and I were hanging with him. He
[1:55:04] must bring forth and he come forth and
[1:55:06] under that incredible pressure and
[1:55:08] strain. And the prophets uh the prophet
[1:55:12] uh enlarges on how he was how he how he
[1:55:16] was under the agony and he was
[1:55:20] brutalized.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I have so much to say. God help me
[1:55:26] and God God help you to stay alert.
[1:55:33] going through the narrow straits
[1:55:38] of death
[1:55:41] because out of that he was going to
[1:55:44] burst into a new world
[1:55:47] and just the other side of it he will
[1:55:50] have accomplished it so he'd be able to
[1:55:53] say it is finished
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; it is finished
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I have dispensed with the curse. I have
[1:56:01] brought back the original purpose. I
[1:56:04] took the soil of the earth and brought
[1:56:06] it to its judgment. And now I'm going to
[1:56:10] rise. No man takes my life from me. I
[1:56:13] lay it down. I give it up
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; and I'll take it up again.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; The reason why I'm stumbling around is
[1:56:20] because I have another what thought that
[1:56:21] I do not want to pass over
[1:56:26] and a thief.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:29] on this side,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; and a thief on this side,
[1:56:35] both going through the same straits,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; both going through the same squeeze,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; both having experienced incredible
[1:56:44] trials, but one ended up with Christ
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; and the other one ended up with Judas.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:57:00] And so for one his trials
[1:57:03] were worth nothing didn't meaningless
[1:57:06] and the other one his trials were also
[1:57:08] meaningless but he had no he had no
[1:57:11] objective and this one on Jesus right
[1:57:15] side he entered into paradise
[1:57:20] you know people today I try to entice
[1:57:22] people
[1:57:23] to become Christians oh you know Jesus
[1:57:26] loves you. He does. But don't you want
[1:57:29] to be happy? Of course you do. You know,
[1:57:32] and they try to entice them, you know,
[1:57:34] that Jesus is just nice and just waiting
[1:57:36] for you and so and so. That wasn't it.
[1:57:38] Jesus didn't try to entice him. He
[1:57:40] didn't say, "Hey,
[1:57:42] do you want to be in paradise with me
[1:57:44] tomorrow?"
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; He let him suffer like a man.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He let him die like a man.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; He didn't try to entice him with
[1:57:55] anything. He just said, "Today you'll be
[1:57:59] with me in paradise."
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; And he died. But what he suffered
[1:58:05] and I don't know about his life. I don't
[1:58:08] know what brought him to be a criminal.
[1:58:11] I don't know what brought him to be a
[1:58:13] treacherous man.
[1:58:15] And they said those kind of people that
[1:58:17] had those kind of deaths generally
[1:58:19] burglarized and and committed crime even
[1:58:23] maybe by murder
[1:58:25] to get their get what they wanted.
[1:58:31] And this man everything he went through
[1:58:34] was erased. He went through the straits
[1:58:37] and entered into a new birth, into a new
[1:58:39] life.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not done. So just hang with me
[1:58:44] please.
[1:58:46] It was pressed on every side,
[1:58:49] formed and squeezed under the pressure
[1:58:52] and tested.
[1:58:54] Jesus was God
[1:58:57] in the flesh.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; And the suffering of the flesh pressed
[1:59:02] or restricted or squeezed until the
[1:59:04] spirit was released.
[1:59:07] Oh, I thank God
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; that he didn't escape it
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; until the spirit was released.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Bible way.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Everyone that may be
[1:59:19] streaming.
[1:59:21] That was absolutely essential.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; If if he hadn't been struck with the
[1:59:26] spear and the spirit was released and he
[1:59:30] released his spirit,
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; that's what gave you life.
[1:59:37] You were imprisoned in that body.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; That was your whole hope.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Not only for to be a Christian here.
[1:59:48] That's just the beginning of it.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; It is another life. Don't you want to go
[1:59:52] to heaven?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have another body?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have another life?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's this gospel. And that's why this
[2:00:05] God sent this messenger
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; with this message.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm moving you on
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; in that direction.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said at the beginning
[2:00:21] of this service, this is not just a
[2:00:24] message. It's not just a sermon.
[2:00:30] The suffering of the flesh body was
[2:00:34] indeed a bitter cup. Even Jesus himself
[2:00:37] saying as I said earlier, "Oh my father,
[2:00:40] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[2:00:42] from me. Nevertheless, not my will but
[2:00:44] thine be done."
[2:00:49] I suppose not many. But how many knowath
[2:00:52] the old olive tree?
[2:01:00] Do you know, Linda?
[2:01:11] Maybe get a microphone to
[2:01:15] to my wife. You won't. You can't.
[2:01:20] Then I will
[2:01:40] some of these old saints
[2:01:43] had such incredible capacity.
[2:01:49] Just before we come to that, listen to
[2:01:52] here's a I don't think this is a song,
[2:01:55] but it's a part of a poem. Do I have a
[2:01:57] little time?
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, mean may seem this house of clay,
[2:02:05] yet it was the Lord's abode. Our feet
[2:02:09] may mourn this thorny way. Yet here
[2:02:12] Emmanuel trod.
[2:02:15] This fleshly robe the Lord did wear.
[2:02:18] This watch the Lord did keep. These
[2:02:21] burdens soar the Lord did bear. These
[2:02:24] tears the Lord did weep.
[2:02:27] This world the master overcame. This
[2:02:29] death the Lord did die. Oh vanquished
[2:02:32] world. Oh glorious shame. Oh hallowed
[2:02:36] agony.
[2:02:41] Oh veil of tears no longer sad wherein
[2:02:44] the Lord did dwell. Oh holy robe of
[2:02:47] flesh that clad our own Emmanuel.
[2:02:54] Our very frailty brings us near unto the
[2:02:57] Lord of heaven. To every grief, to every
[2:03:00] tear, such glory strange is given. But
[2:03:05] not this fleshly robe alone shall link
[2:03:08] us, Lord, to thee. Not only in the tear
[2:03:12] and groan shall the dear kindred be. We
[2:03:16] shall be reckoned for thine own because
[2:03:19] thy heaven we share because we sing
[2:03:22] around the throne and thy bright
[2:03:25] raignment wear.
[2:03:27] Thou who was clothed in our clay and
[2:03:32] stricken in ourstead
[2:03:35] will put on us thy bright array.
[2:03:38] Thy joy on us will shed
[2:03:43] a body like unto his glorious body.
[2:03:45] Almighty grace
[2:03:47] our life to live to make our earth
[2:03:51] divine. Almighty grace thy heaven to
[2:03:55] give and lift our life to thine.
[2:04:01] In order to do that
[2:04:04] he went alone.
[2:04:08] He asked his most faithful three, will
[2:04:11] you wait with me?
[2:04:13] And they failed him.
[2:04:17] And he went alone.
[2:04:22] Neath the old olive trees.
[2:04:25] Neath the old olive trees went the
[2:04:27] Savior alone on his knees.
[2:04:30] Not my will,
[2:04:32] thine be done,
[2:04:35] cried the Father's own son,
[2:04:38] as he knelt the old olive trees.
[2:04:48] Neath the old
[2:04:50] olive trees.
[2:04:53] Neath the old
[2:04:55] olive trees
[2:04:58] went the Savior
[2:05:00] alone on his knees.
[2:05:04] Not my will.
[2:05:10] Thine be done,
[2:05:13] cried the father's own son
[2:05:17] as he knelt
[2:05:19] neath the old
[2:05:22] olive trees.
[2:05:25] Neath the old
[2:05:27] olive trees.
[2:05:30] Beneath the old olive trees
[2:05:33] went the Savior.
[2:05:36] Alone on his knees.
[2:05:40] Not my will.
[2:05:42] Thine be done,
[2:05:45] cried the Father's own son,
[2:05:49] as he knelt
[2:05:51] neat the old
[2:05:54] olive trees.
[2:06:03] And then the agony
[2:06:05] began.
[2:06:10] But I was crying out for birth.
[2:06:16] I was in a womb of this world
[2:06:19] and I was crying for birth.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Not this life, another life. I need to
[2:06:27] go back to my origin.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; What did you intend? What was my
[2:06:32] purpose?
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; And God allowed you to be born.
[2:06:41] While a prophet walked and while a
[2:06:44] message came,
[2:06:46] a message that would in every way
[2:06:49] acquaint the people. Acquaint a few
[2:06:51] people that will see it and understand
[2:06:53] it. Acquaint a few people. Oh, there
[2:06:56] there is another world. While this one
[2:06:58] looks like this is all there is. All the
[2:07:01] trinkets and all the little fan dangles
[2:07:04] as brother Bradup calls it. While the
[2:07:06] world and Satan is dazzling the world
[2:07:09] and enchanting and hanging everything in
[2:07:11] front of them and nice cars and nice
[2:07:13] clothes and nice this and that that more
[2:07:16] technology trying to seduce them. But
[2:07:19] then comes a little light through the
[2:07:21] darkness and a word comes and I realize
[2:07:25] there's another world and that's what my
[2:07:28] soul has cried for.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I cannot be content with this.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Great men have gone. I say the pharaohs
[2:07:38] and the super powers of the past.
[2:07:43] Where are they?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; People have risen up against this
[2:07:51] prophet.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Where are they?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; I drove across. I was on the freeway. I
[2:08:00] was listening to the prophet of God
[2:08:02] speak. And I just thought, here's the
[2:08:06] traffic. It's many lanes of traffic
[2:08:09] going every direction. And I just looked
[2:08:11] up and I thought, "How many are hearing
[2:08:13] what I'm hearing?"
[2:08:19] How many hear this?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; How many hear a man, a human born like I
[2:08:27] was, born in sin like I was?
[2:08:31] I say there's another dimension. I mean
[2:08:34] that dimension. And then tell me
[2:08:35] someplace else. You go as a Christian to
[2:08:38] that dimension. Oh God, I don't want to
[2:08:42] miss that. I'm crying out to this
[2:08:44] congregation. Don't miss that place.
[2:08:58] You young men just starting out,
[2:09:03] you if you have not already, which you
[2:09:05] probably have,
[2:09:07] but you'll face a lot of things yet in
[2:09:10] life. Your own.
[2:09:12] They're your own.
[2:09:20] You young ladies,
[2:09:26] you'll face many trials,
[2:09:29] but you stay with this word.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe a testing,
[2:09:35] stay pure,
[2:09:40] stay godly.
[2:09:44] You young families and husbands,
[2:09:47] mothers,
[2:09:50] assume your full responsibility and
[2:09:52] don't worry about who the next what the
[2:09:54] next person is doing.
[2:09:56] It's irrelevant.
[2:09:59] It's not even worth 10 cents.
[2:10:02] All these trials and all these things
[2:10:05] that come your way,
[2:10:07] they are only a means. And the scripture
[2:10:10] says it clearly. They work for you.
[2:10:14] And so when it comes, that's why these
[2:10:17] old-timers say, "Come trial.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Come burdens,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; do your work."
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm being perfected
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; and I'm being issued into another world.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:10:49] Jesus so knew.
[2:10:55] He so knew because he was the word
[2:10:59] and yet because he was a natural man
[2:11:01] just like you and I.
[2:11:05] There was that side of him that didn't
[2:11:06] want to suffer,
[2:11:09] but yet the other side of him. So here's
[2:11:11] here's two phrases that I'm closing.
[2:11:15] Father,
[2:11:18] in the agony
[2:11:20] and great drops of sweat as though it
[2:11:22] were blood,
[2:11:25] they say that they even the vessels
[2:11:27] inside it broken.
[2:11:30] Father,
[2:11:32] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[2:11:35] from me. Nevertheless,
[2:11:37] not my will thine be done. And the same
[2:11:40] person, I'll say it over to this side,
[2:11:45] said to the leaders,
[2:11:48] destroy this temple,
[2:11:51] and I'll raise it up in three days.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Welcome. Come ahead. Destroy this
[2:11:58] temple. because he knew the word of God.
[2:12:01] He could not see corruption.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; And he would put that word to the test.
[2:12:07] Beyond their persecution and beyond
[2:12:09] their ridicule and beyond their false
[2:12:12] accusations, I'll put my faith in the
[2:12:15] promise of God. This flesh shall not see
[2:12:18] corruption.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And he only believed the word that you
[2:12:22] have to believe. Exactly the same word.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he said, "Destroy this
[2:12:30] temple." And if you wish to look it up
[2:12:33] as I close, he was saying the word
[2:12:37] destroy is used two different ways in
[2:12:41] the Greek language. And the one is pull
[2:12:43] it down, destroy it, and and completely
[2:12:46] do away with it. The other one is loose
[2:12:49] it. The other destroy is loose it. And
[2:12:52] one time Jesus used it and it is to
[2:12:55] destroy and completely annihilate
[2:12:57] something. Bring it down. Tear it down.
[2:13:00] But when he said destroy this temple, he
[2:13:02] said literally loose me.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; You have no power. All you can do is
[2:13:08] loose me.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going through the straight, but on
[2:13:13] the other side I'll be loosed.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have power to lay it down.
[2:13:19] I have power to take it off again.
[2:13:21] Larry, are you listening to me? The
[2:13:23] prophet of God said, "You can say that."
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you believe the same word
[2:13:29] he believed. And then when he stood and
[2:13:32] when he stood and they brought they
[2:13:34] called him and I won't go into the
[2:13:35] story, but Lazarus was in the grave
[2:13:38] already, already stinking four days in
[2:13:41] the grave in that hot country. And he
[2:13:43] said, "Lazarus, come forth."
[2:13:47] And he came forth bound cuz they put the
[2:13:50] they put the swaththing on him and he
[2:13:53] said, "Loose him.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Let him go." That was exactly the same
[2:13:59] word. Loose me. Destroy me. And all you
[2:14:04] can do is loose me to the greater work.
[2:14:07] All you can do is loose me to the
[2:14:09] greater calling. Friends, I want to go
[2:14:12] on I want to go on uh on on testimony
[2:14:16] today. I want to testify to the world. I
[2:14:19] want to say to the spared world, Satan,
[2:14:22] you have no power over us. You have no
[2:14:26] power over me. All you can do is loose
[2:14:30] us. Even if you should succeed in taking
[2:14:33] me to death, all you can do is loose me
[2:14:36] to my greater calling, to my higher
[2:14:39] calling, to the purpose that God sent me
[2:14:42] here for.
[2:14:45] Loose me.
[2:14:48] Hallelujah.
[2:14:49] When Satan comes against you, you can
[2:14:52] say the same thing. In the name of Jesus
[2:14:55] Christ, I have power over you. Loose me.
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:02] to my full purpose.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; And when it looks as though he's
[2:15:06] conquering you and and sending you to
[2:15:08] defeat, you know, you will rise beyond
[2:15:11] that. Not only victorious,
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you young people. The
[2:15:19] reason I look at you is I was young.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; My wife was young and now we are old or
[2:15:26] seasoned or whatever you want to call
[2:15:28] it. But I can tell you there isn't a
[2:15:30] there isn't a second of my life that I
[2:15:32] would have traded for this life.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm so thankful for God
[2:15:39] for having opened up. If the message
[2:15:41] hadn't opened up, if the prophet of God
[2:15:43] hadn't come and preached this message, I
[2:15:45] wouldn't have been able to preach this
[2:15:46] service today. These things are unlocked
[2:15:49] by the message of the hour. I say glory
[2:15:52] to God. And Satan can do nothing with
[2:15:56] all the antics he has in this age and
[2:15:59] all the enticements he has in this age.
[2:16:01] The only thing he can do is is is is
[2:16:04] squeeze you further.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's just squeezing you on.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet talks about birth pains
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; and he says that this world cannot take
[2:16:15] another one. That's the world now. Not
[2:16:17] you, but the world. I'm not talking
[2:16:20] about worldly man. I'm talking about the
[2:16:21] earth.
[2:16:23] said they had one birth pain,
[2:16:26] World War I, second birth pain, World
[2:16:28] War II, and it says with everything it
[2:16:31] has in the ground now and the missiles
[2:16:32] and atomic warfare and so on, it can't
[2:16:37] stand another one.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Another one will birth it right into a
[2:16:42] new world.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Friends,
[2:16:49] we're there.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; We're there.
[2:16:56] Let's bow our heads together, shall we?
[2:17:03] Father, I am mindful today. So mindful
[2:17:08] of the cost
[2:17:10] and what you have done
[2:17:13] and what you have brought us in the
[2:17:15] message you have sent us,
[2:17:18] the reality of it.
[2:17:20] in all humility. Lord, I thank you for
[2:17:24] another opportunity to stand and declare
[2:17:27] the faith that is in my soul and in my
[2:17:30] being. I thank you for this message. I
[2:17:33] want the world to know how much we uh
[2:17:36] believe it and love it. Lord, we love
