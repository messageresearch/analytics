[7:27] [Music]
[7:34] [Applause]
[7:50] Well, another year has uh gone by. And
[7:55] um
[7:56] just to mention the the reason for the
[7:58] old and familiar songs is because
[8:02] this year the Sunday school offering I
[8:04] know we every year we try to dedicate
[8:06] the offering to a specific type of
[8:07] project. It's a missionary offering for
[8:10] sure. And um
[8:12] I sound like I'm inside a 45gallon drum.
[8:19] the um ah better the uh uh when I was in
[8:23] the Ukraine for instance uh a couple
[8:26] years ago uh a lot of the Russian
[8:28] believers were asking me because I'm the
[8:30] Sunday school superintendent here uh how
[8:32] to efficiently set up a Sunday school
[8:34] how should it be put together who should
[8:36] teach and it um
[8:40] it came to me that you know a lot of the
[8:41] reason for the questions is because they
[8:43] don't have that portion of the message
[8:45] translated into their language so
[8:47] therefore they don't have that the
[8:49] prophet's instructions on that. Uh and
[8:52] of course then they're basing it on
[8:53] their former teachings. So and brother
[8:56] Tony has been asked the same kind of
[8:58] questions as well while he's been
[8:59] overseas. So we decided to couple
[9:01] together uh and in concert with Bible
[9:05] believers to produce a um a Sunday
[9:08] school manual so that would be
[9:10] translated in various languages. So
[9:12] that's where we targeted things this
[9:13] year. Um, one thing as well though,
[9:16] there are ongoing things that are taking
[9:17] place. This is really bad.
[9:35] Maybe this is better. This is much
[9:37] better. Okay. Um, anyway, little things
[9:41] add up. Uh, brother Mike G's class has
[9:43] for the last couple of years taken on
[9:45] the burden to um uh to give the children
[9:50] uh a little view, something that they
[9:52] can do to try to make a difference. And
[9:54] and that's really uh what it's all
[9:56] about. I I don't know how many of you
[9:58] can remember the challenge I popped to
[9:59] the young people a few years ago that if
[10:01] they simply matched the amount of money
[10:03] they spent on coffee or slurpees or
[10:07] whatever it is they do after a service
[10:09] just four Sundays out of a year um they
[10:12] could completely cover my budget for uh
[10:15] for shipping to the Ukraine and Siberia
[10:17] um really simply. So it's just little
[10:20] things that add up to make a large
[10:21] amount when everybody puts in. So
[10:23] brother Mike um where's sister charity?
[10:25] Sister Charity, you want to grab the
[10:26] poster? And
[10:29] they, of course, put together little
[10:31] bottles and cans, and each one's worth a
[10:33] nickel. And uh their nickels this year
[10:37] come up with uh
[10:40] over,400,467
[10:42] message books to be printed in the
[10:44] Congo.
[10:50] Now, I'm going to get Brother Daniel if
[10:52] he'll grab the the bullet box.
[10:56] Brother Biscll, you don't have to lift
[10:57] this. Sister Amy has the envelope. If
[10:59] you want to come forward, you can read
[11:02] the Sunday school. Uh, these kids don't
[11:04] know what the word decrease means. I'll
[11:06] put it to you that way. Brother Bisl can
[11:08] read you the totals
[11:10] on the floor. Be better.
[11:13] It's heavy.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Missionary offering.
[11:22] The children of Cloverdale Bible Way
[11:24] Sunday School wish to present their
[11:27] missionary offering for the year 2006.
[11:30] This offering is $78066
[11:33] Canadian and $331.91
[11:38] US for a combined total of $1,082.89.
[11:43] This year's offering has been dedicated
[11:45] to the compilation, translation, and
[11:47] printing of a Sunday school manual to
[11:50] guide the development of Sunday schools
[11:52] for children in the saints of the saints
[11:55] around the world. Richard Drake on
[11:58] behalf of Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday
[11:59] School. God bless you, brother Richard.
[12:03] God bless you, children.
[12:09] Okay, children. We came in nice and
[12:11] orderly. Let's do the same. Here we go.
[12:18] Brother Tony, where do you want the box?
[12:22] &gt;&gt; In the office. Okay.
[12:41] Let's sing together. Uh in Jesus name,
[12:44] we press on. We press on. Somebody maybe
[12:46] want to come up here and uh fix this
[12:49] thing.
[12:51] Richard, you you might want to spend
[12:52] some quality time with your brother
[12:54] John.
[12:57] [Music]
[13:03] In Jesus name
[13:08] we press on
[13:13] [Music]
[13:14] in
[13:16] Jesus name.
[13:19] We press on. We press on and on. Oh,
[13:27] with the bright
[13:31] clear before our eyes,
[13:37] we find the strength
[13:40] to press on.
[13:43] Sin against
[13:48] Jesus name.
[13:51] We press on. We press on
[13:57] in
[13:59] Jesus name.
[14:02] We press on. We press on
[14:07] dear Lord.
[14:10] with the prize
[14:13] here before our eyes.
[14:18] [Music]
[14:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Isn't it grand to see all
[14:32] those young people and children? Just so
[14:36] wonderful.
[14:38] When I look at a group like that, I
[14:41] can't help but think about uh you know,
[14:43] where's it all going to be four or five
[14:45] years down the road?
[14:47] And then what, you know, what's what are
[14:50] we going to do with camp? And what are
[14:51] we going to do with uh whole lot of
[14:54] things? What are we going to do with
[14:55] school? And God God is going to have to
[14:57] make a way for us. Amen. I'm happy
[15:00] they're here.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; I'm happy they're not sitting watching
[15:04] some cartoons
[15:06] &gt;&gt; on television or something
[15:09] &gt;&gt; playing some video game or whatever
[15:11] more. Aren't we glad they're here? The
[15:14] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit. How
[15:16] thankful we are.
[15:19] We've got quite a few things I I want to
[15:22] go over before we actually get to the
[15:24] word tonight. Brother John Tay will be
[15:28] preaching
[15:29] and we have plenty of time. So, we're
[15:33] going to uh have the preliminaries as
[15:36] short as possible to give him all the
[15:38] time that he would need. Uh we're so
[15:43] thankful. I'm I'm glad we were able to
[15:45] see the work in in Ghana where our
[15:49] brother Taye is pastoring and uh
[15:55] not only myself but others here in the
[15:57] congregation I'm sure all of us but some
[16:00] to a larger degree were so thrilled on
[16:03] Wednesday night to see the messages
[16:05] which they have been pulling down off
[16:08] the internet
[16:10] and that will be important in a few
[16:12] minutes uh with some other comments that
[16:15] I have. But I want to make a
[16:17] announcement regarding the Sunday
[16:19] services.
[16:21] We are going to uh go to a one one
[16:25] service Sunday
[16:27] uh for the next two months. That's July
[16:30] and August.
[16:32] Uh we'll have just a morning service
[16:35] which will be at 10:30.
[16:37] And I know with some of you, you're
[16:39] disappointed
[16:40] and other others are perhaps feeling a
[16:44] mixed feelings about this. But this has
[16:46] not been a uh a sudden decision. I've
[16:50] I've made this uh I've had this uh in on
[16:53] my heart for over a year and we
[16:56] discussed it a year ago actually May
[16:59] with the deacons and then we just waited
[17:01] on the Lord. But now here are some of
[17:04] the things you see. You as individuals,
[17:05] you've got your own little circle to
[17:07] think about. I have the burden of the
[17:09] whole congregation.
[17:12] During the last during the last 15 years
[17:17] since we've been in this present church
[17:19] location, our congregation has tripled
[17:23] in the number of people. And a large
[17:26] percentage of the congregation
[17:29] back then when we first moved here, they
[17:32] were young couples,
[17:35] singles, and teenagers
[17:38] and much a much more mobile group of
[17:43] people than we have today.
[17:46] Presently,
[17:48] our families have grown,
[17:51] multiplied,
[17:53] and many of those that were teenagers 15
[17:55] years ago, today they're now married,
[17:58] and they have their children and babies
[18:01] with also growing families.
[18:04] And this group is much less mobile than
[18:08] singles and young people and also empty
[18:12] nesters such as I and my wife who don't
[18:15] have any children, don't have any
[18:16] obligation that way. Family-wise,
[18:20] economics has required that an
[18:22] increasing number
[18:25] of our congregation
[18:28] of people, especially on this side of
[18:30] the border, have had to move further a
[18:32] field, further from the church, making
[18:35] traveling time very difficult and
[18:39] expensive,
[18:40] especially lately with the cost of fuel.
[18:44] It would shock you to know what some of
[18:46] our people are are paying just driving
[18:49] if you just take the time that they
[18:51] drive. And we can say that's a small
[18:52] sacrifice, but it is costly.
[18:57] And just to give you an idea, there's
[18:59] there's over 300 people that either
[19:03] cross the border
[19:05] or drive from a long distance, some an
[19:10] hour and over an hour away. over 300 of
[19:13] this congregation
[19:15] uh live uh either across the border or
[19:18] live quite some distance. Now, the
[19:21] number of people crossing the border has
[19:24] at least quadrupled, not tripled, but
[19:27] quadrupled
[19:28] since we've moved here into this church
[19:31] building. And crossing the border has
[19:33] become increasingly difficult,
[19:35] especially since 911.
[19:38] There's about 225
[19:41] of the congregation across the border.
[19:44] One of our families last week spent one
[19:47] hour at the border crossing at Lyndon.
[19:51] One hour waiting to get across the
[19:53] border. Now others of families I know
[19:56] that they come with their children,
[20:01] have their lunch or prepare their
[20:04] dinner, sit in their vans
[20:07] and wait the afternoon and then come
[20:10] through the evening service. Now you
[20:13] folks on this side know nothing about
[20:15] that. You know nothing about having the
[20:18] little children tired and cranky and
[20:20] they spend for hours and hours in the
[20:22] church. All I say it it it is difficult
[20:25] and over years and years that has become
[20:28] increasingly difficult as we have a very
[20:30] very young congregation very young
[20:34] congregation percentage-wise and it's an
[20:37] unusually young congregation and we're
[20:40] trying to cope and deal with these
[20:42] things. Now the security problem at the
[20:46] border is not likely to go away anytime
[20:49] soon and may get worse before it gets
[20:52] better. We just don't know
[20:56] the border crossing. And the reason why
[20:58] we speak about we're just looking at uh
[21:01] at July and August is because now during
[21:04] holiday season the uh number of people
[21:09] crossing simply because it is holidays
[21:12] increases substantially and often makes
[21:14] the weight uh almost unbearable.
[21:18] There's one last thing. the increase in
[21:20] population
[21:22] just in the Pacific Northwest is making
[21:24] the border lineups a regular experience.
[21:28] If if I were you and you can afford it,
[21:30] I would certainly get a nexus if you
[21:32] don't have a nexus. Now I know also from
[21:35] speaking with many of you uh that are
[21:38] coming from the US side that in Sunday
[21:40] morning
[21:42] uh quite often the timing of the
[21:44] meetings is quite good as far as the
[21:48] tourists are concerned because you're
[21:50] generally coming to church and there
[21:52] isn't a lineup at that time but this was
[21:54] Sunday morning last week and the Lynen
[21:57] border has almost become as bad as any
[22:00] one of the others and it's been It's
[22:03] been quite a thing. Now the other the
[22:08] other aspect of this is this is not just
[22:11] to free up the Sunday. That's not the
[22:14] point. That's not even in the point. It
[22:17] is uh Sunday evenings would make it
[22:20] possible for two other types of meetings
[22:24] that are becoming actually three but two
[22:27] that are becoming increasingly important
[22:29] and one is that uh it would give us
[22:32] opportunity to have a special meeting
[22:34] for the young people who are still young
[22:37] and mobile and we could have uh we if
[22:41] brother Tom brother John feel to have
[22:43] something special for the young people
[22:45] during that time that would be a
[22:47] possibility. Number two, some of the
[22:50] assembly who have not had the
[22:52] opportunity to slip down to Seattle
[22:55] would be able to go down because every
[22:57] other Sunday we have a service in
[22:59] Seattle. Every Friday night and every
[23:02] other Sunday down in Seattle and of
[23:04] course the other thing that will still
[23:06] remain on Sunday evening is the Lord's
[23:08] table and communion and we will be
[23:10] having that in the next two months. So
[23:12] that will be one of the Sundays. So
[23:14] that's that is uh for for the next two
[23:18] months which is uh actually nine Sundays
[23:21] and that will be the our Sunday morning
[23:24] service will remain exactly the same at
[23:27] 10:30.
[23:29] So that's that announcement. Now I have
[23:31] another one that's going to take me a
[23:33] few moments.
[23:35] Uh and you you can just I'll sing of
[23:38] course. So we'll just wait.
[23:41] I'm going to announce today
[23:45] in July of 207,
[23:49] that's a year away,
[23:51] that uh Cloverdale Bible Way, the Lord
[23:54] willing, will host a international
[23:58] convention.
[24:00] This will be a different convention
[24:02] because it will not only be a convention
[24:05] where people will come here, but I am
[24:08] calling it an internet convention.
[24:11] And I felt very inspired about this some
[24:15] weeks ago. I've talked to just a few
[24:18] brothers and I'm going to be
[24:22] uh announcing some things in connection
[24:24] with this convention.
[24:27] It will commence on Sunday
[24:30] July 1 and will go for the entire week
[24:34] till July the 8th.
[24:37] And I want it to encompass all aspects
[24:40] of the ministry of not only the church
[24:43] but of the bride of Jesus Christ
[24:45] worldwide. There will be ministers
[24:48] and delegates from many countries around
[24:52] the world. And we expect representatives
[24:55] especially of those countries where God
[24:58] has allowed us to labor through the
[25:01] ministry of Bible believers, men of
[25:04] vision, who you've just heard brother uh
[25:07] brother Richard Drake speak of and the
[25:10] local church. It will be uh our church's
[25:14] 37th year of being here in in
[25:18] Cloverdale.
[25:20] And this convention will embrace all the
[25:23] various ministries of the bride of Jesus
[25:26] Christ in including but not limited to
[25:30] ministers within the five-fold ministry
[25:34] ministers who are active in outreach in
[25:37] their respective nations.
[25:40] translators and other workers
[25:42] responsible for the printing and
[25:44] distribution of the message
[25:47] and ministers
[25:49] meeting with special sessions for young
[25:52] emerging ministries.
[25:55] There will be ministers meeting for
[25:58] young emerging ministries
[26:01] and then there will be special meetings
[26:03] that will be directed to the youth. All
[26:05] of that will take place within the
[26:09] within the eight days of the convention.
[26:12] We may have uh the first two or three
[26:15] days given over to missions. You see, I
[26:17] have been to many conventions in my
[26:20] lifetime.
[26:21] And uh they bring brethren from
[26:25] many countries.
[26:27] And what's unfortunate is in a three or
[26:30] 4 day meeting, you only get to hear just
[26:33] a handful of those men. And I have seen
[26:36] where people have come from halfway
[26:38] around the world and never have an
[26:41] opportunity to even get behind the
[26:42] pullpit. And it will this will give us
[26:45] some time starting on Sunday and we'll
[26:48] perhaps give a Monday, Tuesday, and
[26:50] perhaps Wednesday morning to to
[26:52] missions. It'll be missions on a scale
[26:55] that you've not experienced for most of
[26:57] you. And then uh and the evening
[27:01] services will be like a regular
[27:03] convention service, special meetings
[27:05] probably going from Thursday, Friday,
[27:07] Saturday and Sunday. And then uh perhaps
[27:11] Thursday and Friday we'll have some uh
[27:15] special service in the daytime for the
[27:17] young people. And the evening service,
[27:20] say Friday night, will be uh directed to
[27:24] the young people perhaps with a minister
[27:27] that the Lord lays on our heart that
[27:28] will have something specially for them.
[27:31] And so it's I have thought about this
[27:33] for quite a long time. You can see it's
[27:36] quite uh quite uh uh I I have it quite
[27:40] settled in my mind what the Lord has
[27:43] laid on my heart. Now the reason I've
[27:47] called it internet convention is because
[27:50] where these ministers come from today we
[27:53] have brother
[27:55] Tay from Ghana. Now I would love to have
[27:59] brother Tay here at that convention and
[28:01] no doubt he will come but then their
[28:05] congregations are back. Ghana for
[28:07] example speaks English so they wouldn't
[28:09] even need an interpreter. And what we
[28:12] will do is we will encourage and we'll
[28:17] have someone in charge of internet
[28:20] service so that
[28:23] uh they will be connected in a
[28:24] high-speed
[28:26] uh line and have the have the all they
[28:29] need is a high-speed line, a projector
[28:31] and a giant screen and then their
[28:34] congregations can come and gather at
[28:36] various locations be it Norway or Africa
[28:40] or Zimbabwe or Ghana or or uh in in
[28:44] Congo, the Philippines, wherever more,
[28:47] we'll have time zones to deal with. But
[28:50] I've also looked into that and for
[28:52] example, all of Europe and Africa and so
[28:54] on, when we have a morning service,
[28:56] they'll have a lovely evening service,
[28:59] if they wish to tie in and see their own
[29:01] pastors participating. And furthermore,
[29:05] then uh I I expect that what we will do
[29:09] is have a a battery of uh some of our
[29:12] young skilled uh computer uh young
[29:15] people that can be at uh several
[29:18] computers and uh uh they're have their
[29:22] laptops at a at some location here in
[29:25] the church and uh say say example for a
[29:28] ministers meeting that may be taking
[29:30] place in the morning. This will be
[29:32] that's why I have it so announced so
[29:35] early so they can it can be arranged
[29:38] that the minister service that is taking
[29:40] place here in the morning ministers can
[29:43] be gathering at many different places
[29:45] around the world and they can text in
[29:48] we'll give them these addresses and they
[29:50] can text in their questions and have
[29:53] them answered by experienced brethren
[29:56] here in this country and text the answer
[29:59] right or they can hear it right back and
[30:00] text the question here. Are you getting
[30:02] my idea? And I think it's a a marvelous
[30:06] I I believe it's an inspired thought
[30:09] that God's given me. I don't know all
[30:11] the technology of it, but I I I see it's
[30:14] very simple and I believe it will work
[30:16] wonderfully. And as far as we're
[30:18] concerned, it'll be the first global
[30:22] internet convention that I know of
[30:25] taking place in the message. And I
[30:27] believe it's not just to do something
[30:29] first, but it will tie the believers
[30:31] together in a way that you've never had
[30:34] it before. We've never had it before.
[30:36] And I think it's wonderful.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to pray about it.
[30:48] You see, there are so many that would
[30:50] like to attend a convention of this
[30:52] nature, but are unable to. So they may
[30:56] have two or three people come from their
[30:58] country or from their church and the
[31:00] rest of them just sit at home and then
[31:02] when the pastor and the different
[31:04] ministers get home they tell them what
[31:06] happened. But won't it be so much better
[31:08] if they can sit there and watch it
[31:10] happen? And really there's not a huge
[31:12] cost to that. Really not a huge cost. uh
[31:16] a projector and a giant screen and if it
[31:18] can't be arranged from within the
[31:20] country then we and some some places are
[31:24] too poor to do it and so we are going to
[31:28] I'm announcing that as of today if you
[31:32] feel on your heart at some point in time
[31:34] in the next year I would like to
[31:36] contribute to the cost there's going to
[31:38] be very real costs to doing this and we
[31:42] have never put any pressure on this
[31:43] congregation in all of our 37 years and
[31:47] God has always wonderfully provided and
[31:50] to me abundantly provided. But if God
[31:53] puts it on your heart, I just want to
[31:55] let you know there will be some real
[31:56] costs because if the if a country and a
[31:59] church is too poor to provide themselves
[32:02] with a with a projector, then we'll get
[32:05] them one.
[32:06] I' I'd be happy to get them one so that
[32:08] whole congregation can enjoy this whole
[32:11] convention either live or and in many
[32:15] places we'll be able to have it live
[32:17] sometime when we're here in the evening.
[32:19] Some places they'll have to be meeting
[32:21] early in the morning like for a 7:30
[32:23] meeting here they'll have to meet at
[32:25] like about 7 in the morning and that's
[32:27] great because a lot of the places a lot
[32:29] of those countries uh early morning
[32:31] meeting is nothing new to them.
[32:34] We'll be working in close contact with
[32:36] the pastors of these countries to
[32:38] arrange for these things to be set up.
[32:42] And then
[32:44] uh we are going to also be needing
[32:49] amongst our own assembly a tremendous
[32:51] amount of commitment and I envision
[32:54] setting up uh some that will be in
[32:59] charge of such areas as billeting. We'll
[33:02] need to bill it people. Uh we'll have
[33:06] someone in charge of transportation.
[33:08] We'll have someone in charge of the
[33:10] internet services and the and any
[33:12] technical questions that might come.
[33:15] We'll need people that are just plain in
[33:17] charge of uh questions regarding the uh
[33:21] convention. And uh I would like to say
[33:26] last but not least, pray for us to we'd
[33:31] like to maybe have another auditorium
[33:33] for the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[33:36] And if that doesn't happen, you know
[33:38] that we fill this church already. So I I
[33:41] envision removing the windows out of the
[33:44] back here. I know already that the air
[33:47] conditioning people said that's going to
[33:48] change everything. and the sound people
[33:50] are going to say because they've already
[33:51] told me that changes everything. But
[33:54] we're just going to have to work with it
[33:55] somehow. And uh and if we have to pack
[33:58] this place out, that's what we will we
[34:00] will be packing it out for sure. And
[34:03] also the fellowship room. So uh that is
[34:07] uh July 2007.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] Let the words of my mouth and the
[34:22] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[34:24] thy sight, oh Lord, my God and my
[34:27] redeemer.
[34:29] Amen. Let's just stand and we'll sing
[34:32] pleasing. Let me be pleasing to thee.
[34:38] Pleasing.
[34:43] Let me be pleasing
[34:47] to you.
[34:50] Everything
[34:51] [Music]
[34:54] you
[34:56] be
[34:58] [Music]
[35:11] [Music]
[35:14] pleasing.
[35:16] [Music]
[35:19] to you
[35:22] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Our gracious and
[35:26] loving father.
[35:28] How we love you and we know Lord that
[35:31] you love us with an ever dying love, an
[35:35] unqualified love.
[35:37] We ask that today, Lord, our words, our
[35:42] thoughts, our plans may be pleasing to
[35:46] you. We want our lives to be in order,
[35:49] oh God. Pray that you'll bless the word
[35:52] today.
[35:54] Anoint us. Anoint me, Father. I'm
[35:57] thankful I'm able to stand here today,
[35:59] oh God. And I pray in the name of Jesus
[36:02] Christ, you'll give you'll give uh
[36:05] utterance and you'll give good ground
[36:08] for the hearts of the people in the name
[36:10] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[36:16] I want to thank the congregation
[36:19] because I've gotten quite a few remedies
[36:21] from quite a few people for my throat. I
[36:24] just want to let you know I'm taking all
[36:25] of them.
[36:28] It's been a bit of a task, but I'm
[36:29] taking all of them.
[36:33] All right, let's turn to Matthew,
[36:34] please. And uh I'm watching my time
[36:36] because I've kept you through these
[36:39] announcements,
[36:41] but we need the word.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Matthew, I'm sorry, the 12th chapter.
[36:48] And we're going to read what we read
[36:50] last week, only just two verses, 36 and
[36:54] 37.
[36:58] But I say unto you, that every idle word
[37:01] that men shall speak, they shall give
[37:04] account thereof in the day of judgment.
[37:08] For by thy words thou shalt be
[37:10] justified,
[37:12] and by thy words thou shalt be
[37:14] condemned.
[37:16] This is really incredible.
[37:18] This is not saying by his word. It's by
[37:21] thy word.
[37:23] The only way you can be justified is you
[37:26] need to speak his word
[37:29] &gt;&gt; and that is part of your confession.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Then in James
[37:34] uh the third chapter
[37:39] just one verse we could read I was going
[37:42] to read many verses here but I I want to
[37:44] conserve our time.
[37:47] The fifth verse,
[37:49] even so the tongue is a little member
[37:53] and boasteth great things. Behold, how
[37:57] great a matter a little fire kindleth.
[38:03] And then I'm reading Hebrews 3 and1.
[38:12] Wherefore, holy brethren,
[38:14] partakers of the heavenly calling,
[38:17] consider the apostle and high priest of
[38:20] our profession,
[38:22] Jesus Christ. Consider the high priest
[38:26] of our profession.
[38:29] And the prophet said the same word, of
[38:31] course, and if you look it up, the same
[38:33] word is confession. The high priest of
[38:36] your confession.
[38:39] May God add his blessing to his word. As
[38:41] you have your seats,
[38:45] I want to say just immediately
[38:49] as soon as you can just gather your
[38:51] thoughts together and and I'll like to
[38:54] get directly to the subject.
[38:58] The
[39:00] the high priest of our profession.
[39:06] our profession
[39:08] which number one he said is to confess
[39:12] that's what the word profession is for
[39:14] you to confess and there are there are
[39:16] many meanings to it but the one that
[39:19] strikes me and the one that I have been
[39:22] very impressed with over a long period
[39:24] of time is to say the same thing as
[39:28] another
[39:30] &gt;&gt; to agree with I'm talking about an
[39:34] agreement that is completely
[39:37] your entire being is in agreement with
[39:40] what has been said or what has been
[39:43] revealed.
[39:44] Uh you and you then it's not just to
[39:47] have a mental ascent and a mental
[39:49] acceptance.
[39:51] It is to say
[39:54] the same thing so that the words of your
[39:57] mouth are in absolute agreement with
[40:00] God's thought.
[40:02] Now I have a question.
[40:06] How are we going to agree? How are we
[40:08] going to express the same thing as long
[40:13] as they as long as God's thoughts would
[40:16] remain a mystery
[40:19] &gt;&gt; or as long as they would remain sealed
[40:22] up in a symbol?
[40:24] &gt;&gt; God gives a symbol. this person assumes
[40:28] it means this and this man thinks it's
[40:31] this and that Bible teacher or whatever
[40:34] more and everybody's got a different
[40:36] concept. They got the white horse rider
[40:39] and one says it's the Holy Ghost and the
[40:42] next one says it's the devil. And who
[40:44] are you going to how are you going to
[40:46] agree if if it's not made known and then
[40:50] somebody might say it but and and they
[40:53] might be exactly right. But you still
[40:56] cannot agree with it because God has not
[41:01] confirmed it supernaturally. God has not
[41:04] vindicated it. So now you have to have a
[41:07] vindicated con a positively confirmed
[41:11] voice that God supernaturally stands
[41:14] behind and so that you know man can't do
[41:17] that.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Man cannot do that. God has done that.
[41:21] Okay. Now when you find the mouthpiece
[41:24] that God has stood behind and
[41:27] unequivocally
[41:29] proved it's him,
[41:32] &gt;&gt; then you are under responsibility to
[41:35] heed that voice
[41:37] &gt;&gt; because now you have something to agree
[41:40] with. And if you hang back from that,
[41:43] then you're in serious trouble because
[41:46] God has gone to all the trouble of
[41:48] making known. And he takes his servants
[41:51] and his he takes his messengers and his
[41:53] prophets and brings them through
[41:55] incredible
[41:56] uh uh trial and preparation to prepare
[42:00] that vessel. Then he gets that vessel so
[42:03] he can set it aside. Then he speaks his
[42:06] word through it and confirms it with the
[42:09] supernatural right behind it in order.
[42:12] He's doing that for you. God's not doing
[42:14] that for his sake. God doesn't need
[42:16] that. You're the one that needs it.
[42:19] We're the people that were confused and
[42:21] God comes and confirms it. It just
[42:24] absolutely correct
[42:27] &gt;&gt; it precisely the truth. then we are
[42:30] under obligation to acknowledge this is
[42:34] God's mouthpiece
[42:36] &gt;&gt; and he speaks the words of God and so
[42:39] then we hear it and now you have
[42:42] something to agree with for the first
[42:44] time if God doesn't prove it like that
[42:46] you don't have to worry this man may be
[42:48] right that man may be right and you'll
[42:50] just have to you know settle my my when
[42:54] I get to an area like that or into a
[42:56] situation like that and I was that way.
[43:00] I was a young minister. I was that way.
[43:02] I had friends that were and had been
[43:05] brought up myself and had been baptized
[43:07] in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[43:08] Ghost. And that's why I was reared.
[43:11] That's what I heard in Sunday school.
[43:12] That's what I heard the preachers
[43:14] preach. That's what I heard my father
[43:15] tell me. And so that's what we believed.
[43:18] And then then I got ministering and I
[43:21] found others that they they said, "No,
[43:23] it was Jesus only." And I thought,
[43:25] "Well, you know, they got scriptures.
[43:26] This one's got scriptures. Someone says,
[43:28] "Well, now it's a it's not uh uh I I can
[43:32] see two in the Godhead. I can see the
[43:34] Father and the Son, but I can't see the
[43:36] person of the Spirit." And so, you had
[43:39] people from all different thoughts, but
[43:42] none of them could supernaturally say,
[43:45] "God, God is on the scene and he's going
[43:48] to prove what I say is the truth." Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; But when I got into Brother Brandham's
[43:53] &gt;&gt; service and I began to hear those tapes
[43:56] and began to speak to him directly, the
[43:58] same scriptures took on entire new
[44:01] meaning. But here was the whole key,
[44:03] friends. He He's the only one I ever
[44:06] heard say, "If God does not come now and
[44:10] confirm what I say supernaturally, I am
[44:13] a false prophet."
[44:16] &gt;&gt; That's what every preacher needs to say.
[44:18] And I will say I cannot say that but I
[44:21] can say I am hearing a voice that was
[44:24] vindicated by God
[44:27] &gt;&gt; that God was pleased to confirm.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; And so now the even even the book of
[44:34] Revelation which is a book of symbols.
[44:37] Who's going to say what the symbols are?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Who's going to say what those symbols
[44:41] are? You've got to have that vindicated
[44:43] voice. And that's why it's so important.
[44:45] Now, now we'll tie together with that
[44:48] the verse in Hebrews which I read last
[44:50] week and who gives a title to the
[44:52] service last week and this week the word
[44:54] of his power who being speaking of Jesus
[44:57] Christ who being the brightness of his
[45:00] glory and the express image of his
[45:04] person
[45:05] and upholding all things by the word of
[45:09] his power.
[45:11] not the power of his word, but the word
[45:14] of his power, whom he had when he had by
[45:18] himself purged our sins, sat down on the
[45:22] right hand of the majesty on high. And
[45:24] so now when something is when the seals
[45:28] have been opened and the mysteries have
[45:31] been revealed, now we have the word, God
[45:35] has confirmed that's my word.
[45:39] Now friends, I'll just say it simply
[45:41] that is the word of his power.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; That then now you have the word that's
[45:49] the word of his power.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; You see
[45:55] Jesus was very clear with the people. He
[45:58] just told them you know if he didn't do
[46:00] the works of God don't believe me.
[46:03] But if I do the works, at least believe
[46:05] it for the work's sake.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; The works prove that the word was true.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; If you people were no different,
[46:17] if this message did not produce anything
[46:20] different than what Pentecost and other
[46:24] churches produce, I want to give you an
[46:26] a third announcement today. I would not
[46:29] be here.
[46:31] I would say that message is not
[46:33] producing what it claims to produce. But
[46:36] when I see a people that are held
[46:38] different,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; live different,
[46:41] &gt;&gt; families are different, the order of the
[46:43] home is different, the order of the
[46:45] church is different, and I see God doing
[46:48] the supernatural amongst it, then I know
[46:51] that came from somewhere.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; And the message is different.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; It's got to produce a different people.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; The word of his power. I said last week
[47:04] and I'll just repeat. God,
[47:06] he cannot increase or decrease in his
[47:09] power
[47:11] because he's absolute
[47:13] &gt;&gt; in that regard.
[47:15] However, he has put in place.
[47:19] He's put in place certain laws
[47:23] &gt;&gt; uh to to to regulate or to govern or to
[47:27] control the access to his power. And
[47:31] sometimes it's persons. When he has a
[47:34] messenger, he puts them in a certain
[47:36] place and he regards and he gives that
[47:38] messenger access. The believer, as a
[47:41] believer, you have access to this power.
[47:45] But not necessarily unlimited access.
[47:48] God has given you access to his power,
[47:51] access to his grace, given you access to
[47:54] forgiveness, has given you access to
[47:57] healing.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Now he governs how his power may be
[48:06] accessed and who may have access to his
[48:09] power. But because, listen now, because
[48:12] God is ever present, filling all time
[48:16] and space, thus his power is always
[48:21] present. You do not have to pull God's
[48:25] power down from some distant place. His
[48:28] power, God is always present.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[48:33] &gt;&gt; That means all of his attributes are all
[48:35] always present. His attributes, all of
[48:39] them. His mercy is here available to
[48:42] you. Healing power is here available.
[48:45] Deliverance is here available. It's
[48:47] closer than your breath.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; It's God that fills all time and space.
[48:53] That's been such a revelation to me in
[48:55] the last in the last year or two. And it
[48:57] is the needs. This is a this world's a
[49:00] very needy place.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; You know, the most difficult thing is
[49:04] not to bring God down into your realm.
[49:06] That's not the problem. The problem is
[49:08] for you to believe that he's already
[49:10] there.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; That's the most difficult thing. That
[49:15] God is already there. All of his
[49:17] attributes are there. If God can
[49:19] diminish, then he's not God.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; If he has grace yesterday but not today,
[49:23] mercy yesterday but not today, he's not
[49:25] God.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; He's God. He's absolute.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; And that's something that's very
[49:30] important for us to remember.
[49:33] Now, we
[49:37] you as an individual
[49:39] uh I I would like that this service
[49:41] could be last Sunday and this Sunday
[49:45] could be something that you will take
[49:47] and resolve within your own heart with
[49:50] sincere prayer to God that you'll be
[49:53] able to take and act upon it and do it
[49:56] because it'll be a great benefit to you.
[50:00] You possess incredible
[50:03] power
[50:05] through the power of your tongue and
[50:09] your confession.
[50:13] Just in the last century
[50:16] and more recently in the last half of
[50:18] the century
[50:21] uh
[50:23] we discovered many things about the
[50:26] voice.
[50:28] I've heard brother Brandham's voice and
[50:30] I've heard other voices. I've heard them
[50:32] on paper tape.
[50:35] I heard them on a wire device, which is
[50:38] just a copper wire that went around on a
[50:41] reel and a voice came through. It was a
[50:44] wire recorder.
[50:46] And then it moved to the the poly tape,
[50:51] the real tore,
[50:53] and moved to the cassette tape, which we
[50:56] had with us. look like we'd have with us
[50:58] forever.
[51:00] And there's very interesting things.
[51:02] It's amazing that all of these things
[51:04] started emerging at the very time the
[51:07] seventh church age messenger came and
[51:10] and and his voice started being laid on
[51:12] some of those uh some of those almost uh
[51:16] very antiquated now
[51:18] &gt;&gt; but devices.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; It's really amazing because that
[51:25] scripture had to be fulfilled. But in
[51:27] the days of the voice,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; not in the days of the life, but in the
[51:30] days of the voice.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; And even when it came to uh the the the
[51:35] poly tape made from it's a byproduct of
[51:38] oil.
[51:40] It is so significant to me and it
[51:42] doesn't make up a whole lot of this
[51:44] message but I just found it as
[51:45] interesting that when that when uh when
[51:49] that tape passes the recording head
[51:53] uh I understand there's all particles
[51:55] and they lie in a linear type direction
[51:59] on on a tape
[52:02] on the recording side of the tape and
[52:05] when it passes the recording side the
[52:08] recording head. It mixes it all up. And
[52:11] they even said in the scientific
[52:14] document I was reading that it mixes it
[52:16] all up into symbols. They're all
[52:18] scattered into symbols. I recall I I I
[52:22] called the recording head the Apostle
[52:25] John
[52:26] and he recorded it and it all went
[52:29] scattered into symbols
[52:31] &gt;&gt; and nobody could figure it out. But then
[52:34] when it goes by the playing head,
[52:37] &gt;&gt; when you're going to hear the voice, all
[52:40] those symbols scatter back into the
[52:42] order that they're supposed to be. And I
[52:44] thought how perfect that is that that
[52:47] even God in the scientific world would
[52:50] have the very instrument that would lay
[52:52] down that prophet's voice and take those
[52:54] symbols literally the symbols out of the
[52:57] book of symbols of the book of
[52:59] revelation and take those those symbols
[53:02] and and bring that all those ideas that
[53:04] have been scattered and bring them all
[53:06] back into line and make it exactly thus
[53:08] say the Lord.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] That's just a little bit by the
[53:15] sideline.
[53:18] But now we went on from that and we went
[53:22] to a disc
[53:24] which I understand is really read by
[53:26] light. The CD and the MP3 and the DVD
[53:31] and incidentally
[53:33] all of those are this whole thing the
[53:36] voice is actually called phone
[53:40] and now we're doing a lot on phone. It's
[53:42] that's the word in the Greek phone.
[53:47] And now the transmission of these words,
[53:50] the air and the whole surrounding
[53:54] uh space that God has created to hold
[53:58] these things is filled with all this
[54:02] massive amount of words.
[54:05] man soon discovered
[54:08] that there was a problem with this
[54:10] scientific advancement
[54:12] and that was to erase
[54:16] what had been said.
[54:19] And the President Nixon of the United
[54:21] States
[54:22] discovered that it was a a very very
[54:27] serious thing when tape
[54:31] and Watergate became a household word
[54:35] and as a result an impeachment process
[54:38] commenced and then he resigned.
[54:42] Uh I'm not here in politics.
[54:46] I think maybe he was a good man. uh
[54:48] brother Brandham said nice things about
[54:50] him but nevertheless that's what
[54:52] happened and things were laid down and
[54:56] that voice was heard and the plans and
[54:59] the schemes and all other things and and
[55:02] it was recorded and because of that
[55:04] guilt and condemnation came down and uh
[55:08] serious things happened that that's
[55:11] that's just one occur o o o o o o o o o
[55:12] o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
[55:12] o o o o o o o o o o o occurrence just
[55:13] one occurrence and then we have the
[55:16] advent of the computerized technology
[55:19] and the people have uh hundreds of
[55:22] millions of computers in the land and
[55:24] discover that there's a hard disk and
[55:26] they can hit delete but it's not
[55:28] deleted.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's still there.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people today think
[55:35] they're sitting in churches such as you
[55:37] are and they believe they've actually
[55:39] hit the delete button for their sins,
[55:41] but it's still there. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Then you have a prophet come and say,
[55:46] "There's only one way."
[55:49] &gt;&gt; There's only one way
[55:51] &gt;&gt; to delete and annihilate your sin.
[55:54] There's only one way. It's not being
[55:56] sorry. It's not feeling guilty. A lot of
[55:58] people feel guilt, but it is to confess
[56:02] &gt;&gt; with your mouth,
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I have sinned.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; I have done wrong, and I ask now for
[56:09] this forgiveness. And then the bleach of
[56:12] the blood of Jesus Christ. And you must
[56:15] say the same thing that God has said.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; I've had people that wanted to be free
[56:20] of their drugs. They wanted to be free
[56:21] of their they wanted to be free of their
[56:23] alcohol. They wanted to be they wanted
[56:25] God to come on the scene and and and
[56:27] heal their home or or do some wonderful
[56:29] thing. And when I come to the place and
[56:31] say, number one, we're all sinners.
[56:34] We're born in sin and shape iniquity. I
[56:37] don't care what church you go to. We're
[56:39] all sinners. were all unbelievers by
[56:41] birth.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; They stop there. They don't want to
[56:45] agree with that. And then you can go no
[56:48] further.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; You can go no further. A lot of people,
[56:51] they want to, you know, they want the
[56:53] future to be all bright and they want
[56:55] God in their future, but they don't want
[56:57] to take care of the things in their
[56:58] lives in according to God's word.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what we have to agree with.
[57:04] If we don't come to agreement with the
[57:06] word and and confess it with our mouth
[57:10] and believe it in our heart, it won't
[57:12] happen.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; It just won't happen. It'll still be
[57:15] there.
[57:23] Now, in the message infallibility, I'm
[57:25] taking it slowly. And you that are
[57:28] visitors,
[57:29] you listen real close. You're going to
[57:32] have something to deal with before this
[57:34] service is over. It'll be in your hands.
[57:36] Then
[57:38] here stands a man, his name is William
[57:40] Brham,
[57:42] in the infallibility,
[57:44] the message infallibility of God's word.
[57:46] And he speaks about God. And he says,
[57:48] "You don't see him with your eyes."
[57:52] He's in another dimension. He said, "I
[57:54] can prove that to you.
[58:00] There's television coming through here.
[58:03] Pictures.
[58:05] Well, you young people listen close.
[58:08] There's pictures going through this room
[58:10] at this time.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Do you see them?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; No. But they are here. Science can prove
[58:18] they're here. And strange that people
[58:20] will accept that. But then comes a
[58:23] supernatural vessel which I'm going to
[58:26] prove in the next few moments
[58:28] &gt;&gt; that God sent that God spoke through
[58:32] that God took control of his mouth
[58:35] &gt;&gt; not for him and not for the man but for
[58:38] you
[58:39] &gt;&gt; for me for this generation and will hold
[58:42] this generation responsible for it.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; True. He said, he said, "But there's
[58:48] voices coming and through here from
[58:52] radio." Do you see it? No. But it's here
[58:55] anyhow. Do you hear it? No. It's here
[58:59] anyhow. It's in another dimension.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Then so is Christ here."
[59:07] &gt;&gt; The things that I do shall you do also.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, I wish that this audience,
[59:14] this entire audience could be settled on
[59:17] that one thing right now. Now, what I
[59:20] wanted to do, and I didn't have
[59:21] sufficient time to do, I wanted to
[59:23] actually capture the voice of these next
[59:28] two, three quotes and have it played for
[59:31] you. My voice is a poor substitute.
[59:34] I would like to had you hear his voice
[59:38] saying
[59:40] these next things.
[59:43] Now I want you to note
[59:48] that if God is present indeed presented
[59:52] &gt;&gt; then that same God is present now
[59:56] &gt;&gt; exactly the same. Now
[1:00:00] in a message, do you believe?
[1:00:05] He invites the man who's coming in a
[1:00:07] prayer line. Would you come, sir?
[1:00:10] And I suppose we're strangers to each
[1:00:13] other.
[1:00:14] And you're conscious that you're
[1:00:16] standing in the presence of something
[1:00:17] besides your brother.
[1:00:20] And that is the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[1:00:25] resurrected power.
[1:00:28] The man now comes and he realizes
[1:00:31] there's another presence besides the man
[1:00:34] he's standing beside and I and he's
[1:00:37] telling him it is the resurrected Lord
[1:00:40] Jesus in his power.
[1:00:43] Sir, you are a very sick man.
[1:00:48] You've been attending doctors and they
[1:00:51] are examining you.
[1:00:54] And I hear one of them tell you
[1:01:01] that you have between 6 months and two
[1:01:04] years to live because you're dying with
[1:01:08] cancer. Now a man is standing here, a
[1:01:11] vessel that somehow captures a voice
[1:01:15] from another dimension that has already
[1:01:18] been spoken in the past. And now this
[1:01:22] man hears for the second time. He heard
[1:01:25] it from his doctors. Now he hears it
[1:01:27] from a prophet. You have between 6
[1:01:29] months and two years to live.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; You are dying with cancer. And he said,
[1:01:36] "That is the truth." He said, "You
[1:01:39] believe me to be God's prophet or his
[1:01:41] servant. You believe it would if I would
[1:01:44] ask God along with this church that you
[1:01:47] would get well." He said, "I hear
[1:01:49] someone
[1:01:50] now." He's not he's not thinking this.
[1:01:54] This is not a mental exercise. He is
[1:01:56] hearing this voice. He hears the doctor
[1:01:59] speak.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; And if you think this is untrue, now you
[1:02:04] got to deal with this, my precious
[1:02:06] friend.
[1:02:08] He said, "Your name is Glenn."
[1:02:11] He said, "I hear somebody."
[1:02:14] said, "Your name is Glenn
[1:02:17] and your last name is Hill
[1:02:20] and you live at 2647
[1:02:23] Melville Avenue." Something like that.
[1:02:26] Mel Melver. He even knew it. He didn't
[1:02:28] pronounce it exactly right. And so the
[1:02:30] man helped him and said, "Men are not
[1:02:33] Mel, but men are." And then Brother
[1:02:36] Brandon says, "Ch Avenue, Chicago." 2647
[1:02:42] Melman Manar Avenue, Chicago.
[1:02:46] He said, "Is that true?"
[1:02:49] Now, I'm here telling you, friends,
[1:02:52] you don't realize it the way I'm
[1:02:55] bringing it to you, but your words go on
[1:02:58] God's recorder.
[1:03:00] You say, "I don't believe that." You got
[1:03:03] God on your hands.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; You got God to deal with.
[1:03:14] says, "Return to your home now shouting
[1:03:17] and praising God."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Now he said, "Next one
[1:03:23] in a results of decision. Now we are
[1:03:26] strangers to each other, sister."
[1:03:29] A strange case, he's saying to her, "But
[1:03:33] there's none hard for our Lord Jesus."
[1:03:37] that handkerchief. She's holding a
[1:03:38] handkerchief. Says that handkerchief is
[1:03:42] for a woman, a girl.
[1:03:45] And that girl is your daughter.
[1:03:49] And that girl has a kidney trouble.
[1:03:53] And she's seriously ill. I see now he
[1:03:57] sees it. I see the doctors standing
[1:04:00] there.
[1:04:02] She was operated on and one of her
[1:04:05] kidneys was removed.
[1:04:08] And I hear the doctors say there's no
[1:04:14] hope for the other one. She's going to
[1:04:17] die.
[1:04:19] She hears
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; from another realm. He's in another
[1:04:22] realm
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; standing there and he hears now a
[1:04:26] vessel. God has brought a vessel on the
[1:04:29] earth that can capture the voice because
[1:04:33] he's got other things to say about the
[1:04:34] voice. He's not just going to say what
[1:04:36] doctors have said. He's going to now go
[1:04:39] be used of God to do away with the
[1:04:42] confusion that's in the church so that
[1:04:44] you will be able to say the right thing
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and repeat the right thing. Otherwise,
[1:04:51] how do you have any confidence? God is
[1:04:53] doing this friends to give you
[1:04:54] confidence.
[1:04:56] Yes.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; This isn't just some historical thing.
[1:05:00] God preserved this on God preserved this
[1:05:02] voice so you can hear it for yourself.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Said, "You're going to die." He said to
[1:05:13] the lady, "And your heart's broke. The
[1:05:16] girl's a Catholic." And that's right.
[1:05:19] And then he tells her to take that
[1:05:21] handkerchief and he prays for her. Take
[1:05:24] that handkerchief to the girl.
[1:05:28] And one last one. These are just three.
[1:05:30] There's many.
[1:05:34] Now, he said that it might be settled in
[1:05:36] your mind forever.
[1:05:39] And I trust it will I know you're
[1:05:41] believers, but I trust it'll be
[1:05:42] projected so much further because I have
[1:05:45] something further I want to say. Of
[1:05:47] course.
[1:05:49] He said this man and I here
[1:05:52] with our hands up to God. This our first
[1:05:55] time meeting.
[1:05:56] He says, "But you are a Christian
[1:05:59] because your spirit catches the
[1:06:01] anointing of this spirit that's on me
[1:06:04] and it welcomes it. And so I know that
[1:06:07] you are a Christian and you're under a
[1:06:10] deep shadow. It's something wrong with
[1:06:12] the blood.
[1:06:14] And you've been to doctors and they are
[1:06:16] wanting to perform an operation
[1:06:19] and the operation is and he stops.
[1:06:23] I hear them
[1:06:26] two doctors consulting with each other
[1:06:31] and they want to take out an organ out
[1:06:34] of your body which is called the spleen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is 1958.
[1:06:45] Where does a man with a seventh grade
[1:06:47] education ever come out of school and
[1:06:50] have that kind of wisdom?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Where how does a man stand on the
[1:06:54] platform and say before the people, I
[1:06:56] hear two doctors, they're consulting
[1:06:58] with each other. Look what kind of risk
[1:07:00] he's running. The man to say, "That's
[1:07:03] not the case. I've never been I've never
[1:07:05] had two doctors say they want to take
[1:07:06] out my spleen." He could have had that
[1:07:09] thousands of times, but it never
[1:07:11] happened once in 33 years. What is God
[1:07:14] trying to say? He's trying to say, I'm
[1:07:16] going to hold this generation
[1:07:18] inexcusable
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; and let them know that their words are
[1:07:24] captured.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; I'm now going to give them thus sayaith
[1:07:28] the Lord so they can agree with a
[1:07:31] vindicated voice. Oh, I thank God we
[1:07:33] have a voice we can agree with. I'm
[1:07:36] thankful we have words we can say.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Now, what about this church?
[1:07:48] This was spoken in Edmonton, Canada.
[1:07:53] He said, "And if this Christian church
[1:07:56] would only think that in their heart,
[1:07:59] the God of heaven deserves your best
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; of everything that you have, the best of
[1:08:06] your time, the best of your devotion and
[1:08:09] everything that you are. We owe it to
[1:08:11] God."
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You young people can say that. Amen. I
[1:08:17] owe it to God. I owe my youth to God. I
[1:08:19] owe my strength to God. I owe my energy
[1:08:22] to God. I owe it to God.
[1:08:25] He says, "We give God maybe a few
[1:08:27] minutes on Sunday, sit and go to sleep
[1:08:30] while a Sunday school teacher's teaching
[1:08:32] and go home and think we've done our
[1:08:34] religion for the week." He said, "What a
[1:08:36] disgrace.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; I know I got He said, "I I got a name of
[1:08:40] being hard. I'm not hard, but what it
[1:08:43] is, I've got to stand in the judgment
[1:08:46] with each one of you."
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Listen to this next phrase. Now,
[1:08:51] tomorrow morning, he said this tape
[1:08:54] recorder would cry out something that I
[1:08:57] said,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; "And if there's a little tape recorder
[1:09:00] here
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; to cry out the things that I say
[1:09:04] tonight,
[1:09:06] what will it be in the judgment bar
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; when God's great tape recorder of my
[1:09:12] life turns on?" And your recorder,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:18] and your recorder
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; and the world recorder and the great
[1:09:23] television screen that's on the sky and
[1:09:26] your life is before God and the entire
[1:09:30] world. He said, "I'd rather be here
[1:09:32] right now and be honest."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy, but to be honest, listen
[1:09:39] friends, we're not here for a picnic.
[1:09:41] We're here to be right with God.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And we're here and I am under I'm duty
[1:09:46] bound. I'm I'm responsible to the
[1:09:49] message that came and because it is
[1:09:51] recorded because it is held and because
[1:09:54] your Lord Jesus said every idol word.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Every idol word
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; will either be justified or will be
[1:10:04] condemned.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be justified
[1:10:08] and not be condemned is you must know
[1:10:11] what God has said. What is thus sayaeth
[1:10:14] the Lord? And then you agree with that
[1:10:18] and you say that. How often do you say
[1:10:21] it
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; over
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; and over and over again until you
[1:10:27] believe it in your heart?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Because the devil, your enemy, is always
[1:10:32] there to bring all kinds of guilt and
[1:10:36] condemnation and call you everything
[1:10:38] that that he's able to call you. But
[1:10:40] there is a perfect delete delete button.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; We've got a perfect delete button.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; I was sent this the other day.
[1:10:52] Brother Mark, thank you for sending this
[1:10:54] to me. He said, "Powerful word." Because
[1:10:59] I was exactly already had all this
[1:11:02] subject and I was I was going right to
[1:11:04] these quotes and when I read that I said
[1:11:07] that is so powerful I won't look. There
[1:11:10] are others, but I thought that is so
[1:11:12] powerful and I know you've experienced
[1:11:14] it and I want to thank you for it. And
[1:11:17] in the message, look, and this is my
[1:11:19] last quote for it now. He says, "And
[1:11:21] then if God can take that man and bridge
[1:11:25] away across by the blood of sheep and
[1:11:28] goats and could make the word of God
[1:11:31] creative by the mouth of a man, how much
[1:11:33] more
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; uh not only but but the creative or the
[1:11:39] power of the sacrifice of a bull or
[1:11:41] goat,
[1:11:43] the blood of Jesus Christ that when sin
[1:11:46] is confessed and drops into that bleach
[1:11:50] of God's own creative way of taking away
[1:11:53] the stain.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; God made a way where our words are
[1:11:58] recorded and kept and God made a way for
[1:12:02] that repent of sinner to have those
[1:12:05] words annihilated.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; God made a way.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And if God hadn't made a way, we're all
[1:12:12] lost.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We're all hopeless. But God made a way.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And we're without excuse.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; How thankful I am today to declare God
[1:12:26] has set a voice and God has taken away
[1:12:30] the confusion and God has given you an
[1:12:33] opportunity to say the same thing
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; and agree with it.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I don't know
[1:12:43] what's in your thoughts right now, and I
[1:12:45] don't know what you're going to confess
[1:12:46] when you get out of this place, but I
[1:12:49] would caution you
[1:12:53] as to what you say. Whatever you say
[1:12:56] will be remembered. And whatever you
[1:12:58] say, you will hear again. Just like that
[1:13:00] person came from the doctor's office
[1:13:02] maybe days or weeks ago says, "You have
[1:13:05] 6 months to two years to live. You're
[1:13:07] going to die." And a man stands here and
[1:13:09] tells him, "I hear the doctor speaking.
[1:13:11] They're telling you you've got sick." He
[1:13:13] now he's hearing it the second time.
[1:13:15] Once through a doctor and once through a
[1:13:17] prophet.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you better be
[1:13:22] sure that prophet is tapped into
[1:13:24] something that man normally is not
[1:13:26] tapped into. And God didn't do that just
[1:13:28] for that man. God did that as an example
[1:13:31] that we would know that is the
[1:13:33] mouthpiece.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; That God is using
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; what is worse his cancer or sin?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; What is worse that this they want to
[1:13:47] take out this spleen or that we are
[1:13:49] under the guilt and the condemnation and
[1:13:51] worse? What is worse that or deception?
[1:13:55] Religious deception.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The world is sinking in religious
[1:14:02] deception.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; You might say,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; "Well, who do you think you are?" I
[1:14:07] don't think I'm anybody. Quite frankly,
[1:14:11] I come trembling to this pulpit each
[1:14:13] time. I would not be here if I didn't
[1:14:15] have the confidence that God have sent
[1:14:18] me a voice that I could believe with,
[1:14:20] that I could agree on. And when I read
[1:14:22] these kind of things and know that it
[1:14:24] happened in our generation, I say thank
[1:14:27] God. I will agree with that. That was
[1:14:29] not a man. That is not psychology. That
[1:14:33] is the supernatural.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Can the congregation say amen? You
[1:14:38] believe that?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking something unreasonable.
[1:14:42] I'm not making an unreasonable
[1:14:44] declaration. I'm simply saying man can't
[1:14:46] do that. And we can say amen. We have to
[1:14:49] say God alone can do that and we say
[1:14:52] amen. And if God did that then why did
[1:14:55] he do it? He didn't do it just for the
[1:14:57] person. He did it for the people. He did
[1:15:00] it for this generation that you might
[1:15:02] agree with it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:06] And as soon as you profess
[1:15:08] that,
[1:15:10] according to Apostle Paul, when you
[1:15:13] profess and confess what God has spoken,
[1:15:18] the high priest will stand
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and move on your behalf. Until then, he
[1:15:25] does not move. He's seated at the right
[1:15:28] hand of the majesty on high. He does not
[1:15:30] move till you confess what God has said.
[1:15:34] Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; How could it be more simple?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; God comes and demonstrates himself,
[1:15:40] shows himself, manifests himself,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; shows up. Man can't do that. Only God
[1:15:46] can do that so that you can believe it.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And then takes that voice.
[1:15:53] What book has more confusion? I tell you
[1:15:56] what, there's more confusion over this
[1:15:58] book called the Bible than there is over
[1:15:59] the Quran.
[1:16:02] There's more confusion over this than
[1:16:03] there is in Buddhism.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; There's more confusion. Why? Because
[1:16:07] this has truth.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And that's what the enemy wants to focus
[1:16:13] on. Confuse the truth.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Darken and make make vague the truth.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Twist it and make it so close that
[1:16:23] people who are sincere,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I'm sincere
[1:16:28] doesn't mean anything. Right?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; A lot of good people are sincere.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's not it.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, we just believe the simple,
[1:16:37] the basics. Jesus died and so on.
[1:16:40] Wonderful. I'm glad you do that. But if
[1:16:42] you believe the basics and don't accept
[1:16:44] what God has sent, the basics will do
[1:16:46] you no good.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; If God reveals it. Now, if this is only
[1:16:50] the basics, don't get me wrong. If
[1:16:52] that's all they ever heard and God never
[1:16:54] sent them and God never confronted them,
[1:16:56] then that's fine.
[1:16:58] They're they stand before God. Every
[1:17:00] person rises or stands stands or falls
[1:17:03] before God. Not before me, not before
[1:17:06] you. Not before anyone else. Before God.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; The perfect delete.
[1:17:14] He says, "But how much more the blood of
[1:17:17] Jesus Christ and when sin is confessed
[1:17:20] and drops into the bleach of God's own
[1:17:22] creative way of taking away the stain."
[1:17:25] So far he said that puts it in the sea
[1:17:28] of forgetfulness to be remembered no
[1:17:31] more. When a man confesses his sin, sins
[1:17:35] and gets right with God and God drops
[1:17:38] the sin of his confession into the blood
[1:17:41] of his own blood and forgives that sin
[1:17:44] and replaces in that man. Listen now.
[1:17:48] And replaces God doesn't God's provided
[1:17:51] a a a catchment. He's provided a
[1:17:54] recorder for your voice. It is there. My
[1:17:57] voice is going out there. Now, I just
[1:17:59] want to say for a moment, thank you,
[1:18:01] Father,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; that you gave me a you gave me a place
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; of confidence that I have a thus sayaith
[1:18:09] the Lord, that I can agree with and I
[1:18:12] can declare to the people. Otherwise, I
[1:18:14] tremble to be in this place and say
[1:18:17] something to you and declare it to be
[1:18:19] truth and for you to count on it and you
[1:18:21] to place your souls as it were in the
[1:18:24] hands of a man. Far be it from me to
[1:18:27] want that responsibility. God, you have
[1:18:29] to back it up. And God has backed it up.
[1:18:32] I've seen God come on the scene and
[1:18:35] deliver people while they sat in their
[1:18:36] seats.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Just hearing the word of God, their
[1:18:40] lives changed and transformed. And so I
[1:18:42] have a sense of confidence today because
[1:18:45] I have a vindicated voice that God
[1:18:48] supernaturally vindicated. And when he
[1:18:50] says you're sinless,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; and someone says, "I don't believe
[1:18:56] that." You still have your sin.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Your sin has been dropped into the sea
[1:19:05] of his forgetfulness
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; because you confessed it.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Because you said it.
[1:19:15] And he says, "And replaces in that man
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; the original spirit
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; that should have been there with his own
[1:19:24] spirit, making him a son of God."
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I could stop right here. And
[1:19:29] replaces in him.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just that you confess. That's
[1:19:34] not just it. You can kneel here at the
[1:19:36] offer and confess and confess, but
[1:19:37] that's not the end of the operation. You
[1:19:40] confess your sin, it drops into the sea
[1:19:43] of God's forgetfulness. It is
[1:19:45] annihilated. He said it's like ink going
[1:19:48] into the bleach. And the ink, the
[1:19:50] chemistry of the ink, it it does it
[1:19:53] disappears. It's broken up. In fact, as
[1:19:55] the ink then becomes bleach.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You talk about being rid of your sin.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's so gone. It can never
[1:20:04] come back again.
[1:20:06] But that's not the end. Then he takes
[1:20:09] his spirit,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; the one that you were supposed to have
[1:20:13] originally
[1:20:14] and and gives it into you and
[1:20:16] homogenizes it with his holy spirit and
[1:20:20] you become a son of God.
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Oh grace
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; of God, marvelous grace of God.
[1:20:36] Who wouldn't want to agree with that?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want to repeat that over
[1:20:41] again? I've confessed, oh God, according
[1:20:44] to your word. And now your messenger has
[1:20:46] said, you will take your spirit and
[1:20:49] replace take this and replace it with
[1:20:52] the spirit I was to have in the original
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; and make me a son and daughter of God.
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. that will give you the authority
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; that will give you the insight insight
[1:21:07] as soon as another voice comes be it
[1:21:10] some uh some messenger of Satan or Satan
[1:21:13] himself come with some demon influence
[1:21:16] and say uh it's just in your imagination
[1:21:19] it's just in your emotions you can say
[1:21:21] you are a liar you are the father of
[1:21:24] lies I already have a voice that I can
[1:21:27] agree with and I'm making that
[1:21:29] profession and furthermore The high
[1:21:31] priest has already stood up. It's too
[1:21:33] late to you to give me that lie. He's
[1:21:35] already stood up. He's already moved on
[1:21:38] my behalf.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Who we say things to and who we speak to
[1:22:01] and what is said
[1:22:04] is a incredibly
[1:22:08] important.
[1:22:14] Jesus said,
[1:22:16] "If thy brother shall trespass against
[1:22:19] thee,
[1:22:20] go and tell him."
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Didn't say, you know, go and tell
[1:22:28] someone else.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Go and tell him
[1:22:33] his fault between thee and him alone.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained
[1:22:41] thy brother. But if you will not hear
[1:22:43] thee, then take with thee one or two
[1:22:48] that are that in the mouth of two or
[1:22:50] three witnesses every word may be
[1:22:52] established. Now I'm I'm not going to
[1:22:55] enlarge. I just want to make this a
[1:22:58] point. It's important who you speak to.
[1:23:01] Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I would say wife or a husband, it's
[1:23:07] better not to tell another friend
[1:23:11] or something of some weakness or frailty
[1:23:15] within your family. Just tell the wife
[1:23:18] or tell the husband alone.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into that because
[1:23:23] we're not speaking about families. But
[1:23:25] the Apostle Paul,
[1:23:27] he was being held
[1:23:30] a as a prisoner
[1:23:33] and they brought him in to a judgment
[1:23:35] chamber.
[1:23:38] And the high priest Ananas commanded
[1:23:41] them that stood by him to smite him on
[1:23:45] the mouth. And one of the soldiers whack
[1:23:48] him on the mouth and said to him, and
[1:23:52] the high priest commanded, they smack
[1:23:53] him on the mouth, smite him on the
[1:23:56] mouth. Then said Paul unto him. Paul
[1:23:59] wasn't done talking. Paul said, God
[1:24:01] shall smite thee, thou whited wall. For
[1:24:05] sitest thou to judge me after the law,
[1:24:08] and commandest me to be smitten contrary
[1:24:11] to the law. He knew the scriptures well.
[1:24:14] And they they that stood by said,
[1:24:16] "Revile thou God's high priest." Then
[1:24:19] said Paul, "I wish not, brethren, that
[1:24:23] he was the high priest, for it is
[1:24:26] written, thou shalt not speak evil of
[1:24:28] the ruler of thy people."
[1:24:30] It didn't nullify or invalidate what he
[1:24:33] had said, but he was it was contrary to
[1:24:37] the scripture that he should revile the
[1:24:39] high priest even though the high priest
[1:24:41] was a hypocrite.
[1:24:43] Even though the high priest was there to
[1:24:44] condemn him,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; he said, "The word does not allow me to
[1:24:48] speak against him." And so he he he he
[1:24:53] apologized in that way. I wish not that
[1:24:56] he was the high priest. See, it's what
[1:24:58] we say. It's not only what we say, but
[1:25:01] who we say it to.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; So if there's ought we say to the
[1:25:05] brother or the individual.
[1:25:08] If if there's a person in authority, a
[1:25:12] person that's been given position by God
[1:25:14] according to the word, then we have must
[1:25:16] be careful how we speak. And in this
[1:25:18] day, and I'm going to close in just a
[1:25:20] few minutes now, in this day,
[1:25:24] this Leoian age, one thing we feel very
[1:25:26] liberated about is to say what we want,
[1:25:30] to who we want, and to when we want. And
[1:25:34] then we may turn around say, but why
[1:25:35] haven't I got victory? Why am I not
[1:25:38] living where I should be living? Because
[1:25:40] you're not really doing what you should
[1:25:42] be doing.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And I would say we should refrain from a
[1:25:46] bunch of idol words. Refrain from just a
[1:25:49] bunch of nonsense and refrain from
[1:25:52] negative talk, this negative thing. If
[1:25:55] you don't say, if you don't hear it in
[1:25:56] the word, then why say it?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to actually take another
[1:26:00] service. I want to take another service.
[1:26:02] The Lord willing. I'm so thankful that
[1:26:04] God's allowed my voice to hold up real
[1:26:06] well. But I want to take another service
[1:26:08] on the things that we should say.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things we should repeat,
[1:26:13] the things that God has made. And they
[1:26:15] are wonderful things. There are glorious
[1:26:17] things. I just have to hold my my whole
[1:26:19] self back. They're such glorious things.
[1:26:22] And that's why you need to hear the
[1:26:23] word. You need to hear the message. And
[1:26:25] when you hear it, say, "I'm going to say
[1:26:27] that."
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to say that.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it over and over.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it till I believe
[1:26:34] it. I'm going to repeat it till the
[1:26:36] devil is tired of hearing it.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Does it work? Absolutely, it
[1:26:42] works.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Even in in such
[1:26:49] simple things as healing.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; I'm healed. The word said, "I'm healed.
[1:26:55] I'm going to continue to say I'm healed.
[1:26:58] I' I've done exactly."
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I'll just tell you
[1:27:02] this preacher tries to follow what he
[1:27:04] what he preaches. I try to follow it.
[1:27:06] Not always successful, but I try to
[1:27:08] follow it. When that disc in my neck
[1:27:12] when it
[1:27:15] herniated and instead of herniating out,
[1:27:18] herniated in against my spinal cord
[1:27:22] and put me in an emergency situation.
[1:27:26] And I went to the specialist, Dr.
[1:27:28] Richard Chan, one of three at the Royal
[1:27:32] Colombian Hospital. He has performed
[1:27:35] over 800 according to the uh College of
[1:27:39] Surgeons and Physicians. He has he has
[1:27:42] done over 800 operations on the spine.
[1:27:46] And I went to him and he's handed me a
[1:27:49] paper and he said, "Just sign this. I'll
[1:27:51] get your bed as quickly as possible."
[1:27:54] And I said, "Is there is there, you
[1:27:57] know, anything that could happen that
[1:27:59] might, you know, that this thing might
[1:28:01] change?" None. None. None at all. He
[1:28:03] says, "I have to go in here and I have
[1:28:05] to suck that disc out. What is
[1:28:07] remaining? And then I take some cow bone
[1:28:10] or bone from your hip and fuse those uh
[1:28:13] between the C6 and C7 together." And he
[1:28:16] said you I said uh but he said I I must
[1:28:19] tell you that the d you know the the the
[1:28:22] dangers that are here are you could
[1:28:24] hemorrhage if I happen to touch the
[1:28:27] spinal cord you could be quadripolgic
[1:28:29] and he named another one and named a
[1:28:33] fourth one
[1:28:35] and all of them were bad and I said well
[1:28:39] okay so I signed the document
[1:28:42] I couldn't drive my wife was driving I
[1:28:44] was in incre excruciating pain. They
[1:28:46] give me morphine. Morphine wasn't even
[1:28:48] touching it.
[1:28:50] And I said,
[1:28:52] "Call the church."
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Soon as we got in the car, call the
[1:28:58] church.
[1:29:00] Call Brother Tom if he's at the church,
[1:29:04] Brother Lance if he will come now, and
[1:29:07] Brother Tony.
[1:29:11] And they met me here, all three of them.
[1:29:14] And I walked down this aisle and walked
[1:29:16] and stood right here. And I said,
[1:29:18] "Whenever I have a serious case,
[1:29:20] brothers," we all stood here, four of
[1:29:22] us. So whenever I have a serious case, I
[1:29:26] tell them, number one, do exactly what
[1:29:30] the word of God says
[1:29:33] because that's all God will honor. And
[1:29:36] number two, I tell them, read, be
[1:29:38] certain of God, the message. Be certain
[1:29:41] of God. And since this happened, I've
[1:29:44] I've carried that book with me because
[1:29:47] brother Brandham says in that book, "How
[1:29:49] many times I've gone back over my life
[1:29:52] and turned over every stone
[1:29:55] and still he remains silent."
[1:29:58] Says, "Then you have to be certain of
[1:30:00] God."
[1:30:02] And I said, "The scripture says, is any
[1:30:04] afflicted?
[1:30:06] Let him pray.
[1:30:09] Is any sick among you? Let him call for
[1:30:12] the elders of the church and their
[1:30:14] prayer of faith will save the sick and
[1:30:16] if he's committed any sins they shall be
[1:30:18] forgiven him. I said I'm not sick. I'm
[1:30:22] terribly afflicted. I've not asked you
[1:30:25] to come and pray for me. I've asked you
[1:30:28] to come and pray with me because I
[1:30:31] according to the word have come here to
[1:30:33] pray.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And we knelt here and we prayed.
[1:30:38] I said that to say this to you. I
[1:30:42] believe it's absolutely
[1:30:45] absolutely
[1:30:48] impossible to have an answer from God
[1:30:52] outside of doing what God has said to
[1:30:54] do. And that's why I think it's so
[1:30:56] important to agree with the word. Just
[1:30:58] agree with it and confess it and keep
[1:31:01] saying it. Keep speaking it. I am
[1:31:04] healed. I'm healed. And I stood up
[1:31:06] before the church and gave a testimony
[1:31:09] that I I believe that God had spoken to
[1:31:11] me. And this is what he said. It was
[1:31:13] seven weeks
[1:31:15] and the loss of quite a few pounds from
[1:31:17] the pain, but nevertheless, God came on
[1:31:21] the scene.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And I said, God said to me, be thou
[1:31:26] whole.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And I said, that does to me does not say
[1:31:30] improved
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and that does not say better. It says,
[1:31:34] "Be whole."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; That word works, friends.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But I'm I'm still I still don't I'm not
[1:31:42] here declaring this message because I
[1:31:44] have that healing. I'm here declaring
[1:31:46] this message is because this word, the
[1:31:49] seals have been opened and the word has
[1:31:52] been made clear. And you and I don't
[1:31:55] have any excuse. So thankful that the
[1:31:59] voice, we've heard a voice and God has
[1:32:01] recorded the voice. and so thankful that
[1:32:04] we've been able to put it around the
[1:32:06] globe. I thank God for the church. I
[1:32:09] thank God for those that have worked and
[1:32:12] labored so hard that amongst all the
[1:32:14] other things, all the Hollywood stars
[1:32:16] and all their stuff and all the
[1:32:19] perversion that goes on encircling the
[1:32:22] globe,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; but amongst all of that confusion
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; and uncleanness
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; is a clear sounding voice that says,
[1:32:32] "Thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; not thus sayeth the Bible school." as
[1:32:38] good as it might be. Or thus sayith what
[1:32:40] my teacher has told me. But now from
[1:32:43] another dimension,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; through the ordained mouthpiece
[1:32:50] comes a voice that you can count on.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And that God has made this God, you hear
[1:32:58] me? God has made this generation
[1:33:01] accountable for the last messenger's
[1:33:04] voice. And I say, God bless you. I thank
[1:33:07] God he's given me ear to hear.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus said are your eyes for
[1:33:13] they see what they see. And blessed are
[1:33:15] your ears for they hear the word of God.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Blessed are we.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[1:33:25] Tonight our brother Taye from Ghana is
[1:33:28] going to be speaking things on his
[1:33:30] heart. And I'm anxious to be here. 5:00
[1:33:33] we're starting sharp. Of course. And
[1:33:35] you'll be here. You'll be ready, won't
[1:33:37] you?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And from this day forward, may you take
[1:33:42] and
[1:33:44] may God put a seal upon our mouths, upon
[1:33:47] our words that we will agree with the
[1:33:51] things, the things we need to speak
[1:33:53] about in normal life, it just passes
[1:33:55] away. It doesn't mean anything. We have
[1:33:58] to talk about living and about all of
[1:34:00] these things. Let those things be gone.
[1:34:03] But the things that pertain to eternal
[1:34:05] life.
[1:34:07] Amen. To eternal life.
[1:34:10] I want to I want to be in perfect
[1:34:13] harmony with it and desire that each one
[1:34:15] of us each one under the sound of my
[1:34:18] voice today will be in harmony with it.
[1:34:22] Are you here?
[1:34:24] Are you here? And perhaps you're under
[1:34:26] some cloud of condemnation.
[1:34:29] It's a lie. And you do not have to be
[1:34:32] under it anymore.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "What should I be agreeing
[1:34:35] with? There is now therefore no
[1:34:38] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:34:40] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:34:43] after the spirit." Say it today. Say it
[1:34:47] again. Say it. Say it when you wake up.
[1:34:50] Say it in the middle of the day. Keep
[1:34:51] repeating it. The devil will get tired
[1:34:54] of hearing you.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "Is that mind over matter?" No.
[1:34:59] That is that is the word over to the
[1:35:01] devil. That's what it is.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with it?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; You can see I can hardly wait to come
[1:35:07] back with the things we want to say.
[1:35:09] Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:35:17] I want to sing 2179.
[1:35:24] Faith of our fathers.
[1:35:26] What's the next line?
[1:35:29] Oh, say it again.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I like that part. Don't you? Faith of
[1:35:34] our fathers living still.
[1:35:37] It didn't go anywhere. Why? Because God
[1:35:40] of our fathers is here. Hallelujah. Nice
[1:35:44] to have brother and sister Andes here.
[1:35:47] It's nice that they have their uh as
[1:35:49] much of their families as they have here
[1:35:51] and the grandchildren which they could
[1:35:54] watch singing. No wonder they were
[1:35:55] smiling when uh Sunday school children
[1:35:58] were singing. And if you thought they
[1:36:01] were smiling and you saw me smiling, did
[1:36:03] you see me smiling? I was smiling, too.
[1:36:06] This is this is a first for me. There's
[1:36:09] always first, but this was the first for
[1:36:11] me.
[1:36:14] I had a daughter playing,
[1:36:17] had grandson up looking after some of
[1:36:21] the uh computers up there.
[1:36:25] and a great granddaughter are down here
[1:36:27] singing.
[1:36:28] So I thought, my goodness, if time goes
[1:36:31] on and we stay around,
[1:36:34] where's this going to go?
[1:36:37] Granddaughter and daughter and a great
[1:36:38] granddaughter. My goodness. I thought
[1:36:41] that's where I got the phrase, I'm so
[1:36:43] glad they're here.
[1:36:45] Amen. Glad you're here. Hallelujah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; There'll be a great gathering there.
[1:36:52] Lord.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God bless you. All right, let's
[1:36:56] sing this together.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Faith on our father
[1:37:04] still
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:09] fire and sword.
[1:37:13] Oh our hearts be high with joy.
[1:37:19] There we
[1:37:23] go.
[1:37:30] Holy
[1:37:31] face.
[1:37:33] We will be true to the children.
[1:37:40] Our father changing
[1:37:44] praise and son.
[1:37:47] Earth
[1:37:50] and consious
[1:37:52] free
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:55] would be their children
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] like them
[1:38:05] for the
[1:38:11] holy
[1:38:13] gra
[1:38:15] we will be
[1:38:18] to the
[1:38:20] end
[1:38:22] of our
[1:38:25] we
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:38] as
[1:38:40] go
[1:38:43] by mighty word
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] We will be true to the
[1:39:03] voice
[1:39:05] of our father.
[1:39:11] He will be true to me.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I'd like everybody, everybody 25 and
[1:39:21] under, our young people who are singing
[1:39:23] 25 and under,
[1:39:25] you know, you have something
[1:39:28] that to me is a one of the greatest
[1:39:30] privileges. And I want to speak right
[1:39:32] down to you young people. Don't change
[1:39:35] your course. Don't allow anything to
[1:39:38] change your course. God has set you
[1:39:40] amongst a group of people,
[1:39:42] not just a church. If this is just a
[1:39:44] church, I'd say, well, you know, do the
[1:39:47] best you can.
[1:39:49] But I am saying to you as a personal
[1:39:52] witness, God
[1:39:55] has brought you under the sound of a
[1:39:57] voice that God himself almighty come
[1:40:00] from another realm, another dimension
[1:40:02] that he had actually created to hold a
[1:40:04] voice. And he and he and he brought that
[1:40:06] same voice right back to a a a a vessel,
[1:40:10] a prophet messenger, and said, "Here,
[1:40:12] here it is." He could hear it. Here's
[1:40:15] what I here's what was said. Here's what
[1:40:18] I have recorded on my recorder. Say it
[1:40:21] again to this person. Help them out.
[1:40:24] Then he saw a little fellow 27 years
[1:40:27] old,
[1:40:28] a little preacher with a thousand
[1:40:31] questions.
[1:40:33] so so confused and troubled.
[1:40:37] I said, "Brother Brandham,
[1:40:39] how is it that people can prophesy,
[1:40:43] speak in tongues,
[1:40:45] interpret, and their life does no way
[1:40:48] match the word of God?"
[1:40:50] And four years before he spoke the
[1:40:52] message, he asked me, "Have you heard my
[1:40:56] tape on false anointed ones at the end
[1:40:59] time?" That was May 1961.
[1:41:03] He did not speak it until 1965.
[1:41:07] I rejoiced immensely.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; I told brother I told brother Brad no I
[1:41:12] haven't heard it. He went through four
[1:41:14] scriptures and in four scriptures just
[1:41:17] quoted four scriptures never enlarged on
[1:41:20] them. And I can say to you a thousand
[1:41:24] questions and confusion dissolved and
[1:41:28] crumbled. And I even thought, why didn't
[1:41:32] I think of that? Why didn't I I realize
[1:41:36] now that that voice,
[1:41:39] God's word in that mouth was different.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Anatoli from
[1:41:47] Usuzbekistan
[1:41:48] said he heard the tape, false anointed
[1:41:51] ones at the end time. That's how he came
[1:41:53] in. And that's how about 250 people in
[1:41:56] his congregation, he only had one
[1:41:58] message.
[1:42:00] I asked this brother or brother Tay,
[1:42:05] "How did you come to the message?"
[1:42:09] He said, "The first book that came into
[1:42:12] my hands was false anointed ones."
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That was it, Brother Tay. Hallelujah. So
[1:42:19] we can both rejoice. And we do. Isn't he
[1:42:23] wonderful?
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; You young people, never change your
[1:42:27] course. Whatever you do, I may be gone,
[1:42:29] but never change your course. Go in that
[1:42:31] straight direction. Everybody 25 and
[1:42:34] under.
[1:42:36] Faith.
[1:42:38] Faith.
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:46] We will be
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; 25. Once more, more
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; our sisters.
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:16] Yes,
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; we will be true
[1:43:20] to
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; all of you brothers.
[1:43:33] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:43:49] We will be true
[1:43:53] to
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] Brother Ken Amdies, I'm going to ask you
[1:44:03] if you will come please and dismiss this
[1:44:07] congregation and the invisible
[1:44:09] congregation on the internet around the
[1:44:12] world. Ask God's blessing upon them if
[1:44:14] you would please.
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:20] Let's bow our heads.
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:24] Heavenly Father, so good to use that
[1:44:27] phrase knowing that we've come from you
[1:44:30] and that we are your children. We
[1:44:33] believe, Lord, that we have heard your
[1:44:35] word reiterated and ministered to us
[1:44:37] this morning that was delivered unto
[1:44:39] your faithful prophet, Brother Brandham.
[1:44:41] And Lord Jesus, the faith that we have
[1:44:44] is the living word of God, Jesus Christ
[1:44:47] yourself, risen from the dead and is
[1:44:49] alive with us this morning. We believe
[1:44:52] Lord that faith of our fathers, the
[1:44:54] apostolic fathers that preached this
[1:44:56] same message that we heard this morning
[1:44:59] that was delivered under the apostle
[1:45:00] Paul and Lord has been open to us the
[1:45:03] seven seals. Lord Jesus,
[1:45:08] God make it live within us.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; we believe that we've been honored this
[1:45:16] morning to meet with you, the
[1:45:18] resurrected Jesus Christ.
[1:45:21] move in our midst, move in our lives,
[1:45:23] Lord. May we always be yielded unto you
[1:45:26] in every way that you could have your
[1:45:28] pleasure to walk and to move within us.
[1:45:31] And as we would hear these young people
[1:45:33] singing the church of tomorrow if time
[1:45:35] would go on as we did not think we would
[1:45:38] be here this many years. But Lord Jesus
[1:45:41] you're faithful in all things to bring
[1:45:44] forth your glory in a perfect bride
[1:45:47] that's been made perfect and to become
[1:45:49] the living word. Lord Jesus go with each
[1:45:53] individual this morning. Fulfill your
[1:45:55] purpose in their life. Bless every home,
[1:45:58] Lord Jesus, that's represented here
[1:46:00] until we can gather back again tonight
[1:46:03] and hear your servant, Brother Tay. In
[1:46:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:46:07] ask your blessing upon the ministry
[1:46:09] here, Pastor Bisco, and everything
[1:46:11] that's done and said, may it be to your
[1:46:13] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you.
[1:46:22] We dismiss you in the name of our Lord
[1:46:24] Jesus Christ. Go and encourage one
[1:46:27] another. Shake one another's hand. And
[1:46:29] God go with you. Lord willing, we see
[1:46:32] you this evening. You're dismissed.
