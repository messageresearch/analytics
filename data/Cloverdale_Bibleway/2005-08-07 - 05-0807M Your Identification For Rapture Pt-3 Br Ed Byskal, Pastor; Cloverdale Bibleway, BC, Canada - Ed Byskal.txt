Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for the great treasure of being able to come into your supernatural presence to be able to come with expectation that we're going to have a spiritual encounter with you. And Lord, you have this meeting planned before the foundation of the world. You knew every son or daughter of God that would be here. You knew every person that would be here that would be in need of salvation or deliverance or healing. Lord, or or just direction, Father. And Lord, we just thank you for the gift that you have given to us to to to take us from a world of insanity, oh God. And Lord, by revelation of your word. And only through that revelation can we be can we stand justified, Lord, and sanctified and know that that we are being led and guided by your Holy Spirit. Lord, for for the needs that have been brought forth today. First of all, for those that are on the internet, those that may be on the phone hookup, Father, myriad of of needs out there, we pray that they would feel a part of the family today. And as they raise their hand, oh God, just knowing that there is no distance in the spirit, that God can reach down and God can speak to them, God can use the the man of God to speak healing to them, speak deliverance to them. And Lord, we thank you for the testimony for brother Joe Graham, Lord. How you how you moved upon his his heart, Lord God, and healed his body, oh God. Lord, swiftly and supernaturally, Lord. And Lord, for Sister Ruth Ruth Nash's uh request, God, Lord, I pray that this person that is in need of healing, Father, I pray that they would be able to to step up into that place, that channel of faith, oh God, where grace and mercy and love is always available. And Lord, for for brother brother Darren uh Frost, this this young man who is having family problems. Oh God, it's so difficult when you're young and and and you see your family going through difficult times.

And now, Lord, as the man of God comes to stand behind the pulpit, Lord, let us let us have great supernatural magnets in our pockets, oh God. Let us pull the word of God out of them. &gt;&gt; Give him a freedom and a liberty to speak that which you've laid on his heart. We ask in Jesus precious name. Amen. [Music] And you may be seated. [Music] want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. We're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning. Um, Brother Mike Yan is going to come bless us with a song. Brother Mike, if you'd come at this time and get ready. Uh we want to welcome uh April, Shelley, and Andrea Grant who are visiting from South Carolina. May we get them to stand. We're happy to have them here. And uh also we want to welcome brother Eddie Yan who's up from Mauritius. get you to stand. Are there ready Eddie? We're happy to have you here. If you don't know where Maitius is, it's a little dot in the middle of the Indian Ocean. So, Brother Eddie's come a long way. Um, camp uh starts at 3:00 this afternoon for juniors. Um, there is no service tonight, no service Wednesday night. service is at Thursday 7 pm. Campgrounds, if you don't know uh where they are, there's a map at the back. Uh uh so it's uh Friday, Saturday at 7:00 as well, and then Sunday at 10:30 in the morning. Um some people have been asking about my uh the memorial service for my dad. It's going to be a Bible fellowship church, which is at uh on 66A Avenue, just west of 152nd Street. It's going to be uh at 2 o'clock on uh Saturday, August the 13th. And maybe just before Brother Mike sings, I'll share something. I shared part of it, but I didn't tell the whole thing. So, uh and I know it was a real blessing to some people, and it certainly uh has given me just a huge amount of peace. um you know about 15 years ago. Um actually before that my dad when he was around 63 he started getting really depressed cuz his dad had died when he was 63. And so he thought you know probably my time's not much longer for this world. And so he uh he was uh he was kind of uh depressed cuz he thought that was it. He was going to go any moment. And uh and then it was a little bit after that he kind of came out of that a little bit after that he was just praying and he said Lord cuz I guess he was thinking about you know u the Lord looking after him and he said Lord do I have an angel that looks after me. He said you know you showed brother Brandham an angel. He said do you think you could show me my angel if I've got one? You know he wasn't sure whether he did or not I guess. And so that night he was he was uh he was in bed and uh he was asleep. He woke up cuz there's a light in the room. He thought, "Oh, my mom had left the you know so big left the light on." So he woke up and looked and there at the end of end of the bed was a he said a really big guy with his arm crossed looking at him and dad just said I got real scared. He said Lord that's enough. I see nothing. said he just went up through the roof and uh so uh about I guess it was two weeks ago Friday. Um dad we got back from uh we were away for a week on vacation. We got back and I went over to see dad on Saturday when we got back and he said uh I kind of had a vision yesterday I think Rod. And I said well what happened? He said well he said I heard the doorbell ring and uh he said uh he said and a voice came he said when when mom answered the door voice came and said I'm here to take Lindber home and he said I looked around the corner it was the same guy I'd seen 15 years ago &gt;&gt; standing at the edge of my bed so you know I just knew his time to go you didn't you know you knew how to pray I And I really thank everyone. Just before he passed on, my brother, you know, was uh sitting there with him. He says, "Dad, are you in pain?" No. Are you comfortable? Yeah. He couldn't talk cuz he's just so weak. And he said, "Uh, is your mind sharp?" You know, and he was uh he was just gone a few hours later. So, we're just thankful, you know. I I mean, I'm happy cuz he's he's over on the other side. you know, you just are thankful for uh for those little things God gives you. And um you know, Brother Biscll sent me a little email on uh on Wednesday. I just, you know, so thankful for the confirmations God gives. It was scripture Job 14. And I turned on I got my Bible on my little Blackberry. I turned the Blackberry on and uh cuz I've been reading the Bible on uh Tuesday evening after dad had died and uh I was in the same chapter that brother Ed had had directed me to. So just thankful for God's God's direction and confirmation. Amen, brother Mike. Bless the Lord. Just so wonderful to have the confirmation of the Lord. I wanted to read you a scripture uh before I sang. Um it's uh we've been reading out of Romans 8 uh our pastor has and this is Romans 8:20 uh 29 and 30 for whom he did forno he did predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that they might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he did call, them he also justified. And to whom he justified, them he also glorified. And it just um it just shows to us that it's uh it's all God. It's none of us. Um, this song I wrote it several years ago and it was in a in a kind of a perplexed time in my life when uh you have that uncertainty, you know, uh, am I going to make it? Am I bride? And the devil comes to you all the time with that. Um, but um, this was kind of a a rebuke to me and it could be to you, but at the same time was a comfort uh, because it's all him. And uh I just wanted to sing it for the glory of the Lord. [Music] Have not I called you to hear my full word? Have not I sent you? Speak what you've heard. [Music] Have not I given you power against sin? My sword in the hand of faith. This battle you'll win. Why do you sit by idle unsure? I gave you the message. My word will endure. The whole earth is groaning. As a woman in travail, [Music] I gave you authority. My word bride can't fail. [Music] Have not I called you? [Music] Your inheritance awaits. Have not I placed you within Zion's gates? [Music] Have not I called you to stand in this day? Speak and go forward. My bride on display. Why do you sit by idle unsure? I gave you the message. My word will endure. The whole earth is groaning. As a woman in travail, I gave you authority. My word bride can't fail. [Music] I have betrod you and spread forth my gown to clothe you in perfection. [Music] You wear my queen's crown. [Music] Wedding supper awaits you in your new home. Come up higher, my little bride. Sit in my throne. Why do you sit by idle unsure? I gave you the message. My word will endure. The wedding supper awaits you in your new home. [Music] Come up higher, my little bride. Home sweet home. [Music] [Applause] Brother Mike, we're going to turn to the word now. You hungering? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thirsting for righteousness this morning. I feel the pull. I hear the call. And his spirit's moving me to give my all. Let's sing it together. I feel the call. I hear the call. And his spirit moves in me to give my all. He speaks to me. and I free. Lord, please come and take control. I feel the poor. I feel the poor. I hear the call. all and his spirit move me to give my all. He speaks to me and I [Music] Lord please come and take control. I feel the P. I feel the P. I hear the call and his spirit [Music] in my heart. He speaks to me and I agree. Come and take control. I feel the Let's all stand, shall we? I feel the I hear the call and his spirit to me my heart to me and I have for I feel [Music] &gt;&gt; I've just got to make an announcement then brother I want to sing this is your house. Uh we are going to be streaming, Lord willing, the four camp meetings and uh believe our brother Isaac Nash has been arranging a provider on the US side. So the Lord willing, we're going to be streaming the meetings for those that uh aren't able to be here. I want to make that announcement for those that are streaming the service today that may be overseas in some other country across the land. And so we're happy for that. So, uh, we don't expect anybody in this region to be streaming the meetings. We expect you all to be there live in the flesh, like one minister said, with a dollar in your pocket. Well, we we we're going to be taking up also offerings during this service. Uh, the camp meetings. The first two nights are going to be for the camp expense. We have expenses dur during the camp. We like to have those. There are some that can't afford to come, but we want the children to be there. And uh that's all there's to all the young people. We want them to be there. And so you'll give towards those expenses the first two nights. And Saturday night, I have felt to take a missionary offering. We're going to take up a missionary offering for the missions on Saturday night. And on Sunday morning will be our regular tithes and offerings. So, uh, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, as brother Rod has already announced, at 7 p.m. and Sunday at 10:30, I want you to be praying for the speaker, Brother Ron Spencer. Uh uh probably if he were just judging everything from the natural man because he spent he he was in the hospital a few days uh about a week in fact just about 3 weeks ago or so a month ago and uh meetings like this are a great strain on a on a person. So, we want to be praying for the man of God because you you come to service sometime you say, "Oh, the devil has just really fought me." Well, just imagine how he fights a minister. Imagine how he's fighting this guy right now. So, you're in you're in prayer, aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's about 30 of our congregation that are down there at the camp right now. They feel very very bad to miss the service this morning, but they're getting things set up and it was necessary to to start today because we have to be out the following Sunday. All right, let's just sing this. This is your house. Dedicate ourselves to the Lord and we're going to be turning to the word right away. &gt;&gt; This is your house. Father and this is your house. A holy house of prayer where the lost and lonely bring their tears. This is your house. This is your house. Come and watch the course. Oh, this is your house. Oh, father. This is your house. It's a holy house of prayer where the lost and lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. would come and dwell in prayer now. Lovely Lord Jesus, we say with everything that is within us, oh God, this is your house. Come and dwell. That is the invitation. And you have already told us, I will be in you. We believe that to be the case. You are in us by your living Holy Spirit dwelling in us and we in you, you and the father and we are one. Oh God, thank you for the revelation of your word, the knowing, the understanding of it. And I pray that you'll come this morning in all of your beauty and all of your loveliness. Come, oh God. I pray you'll touch every life that is gathered here, every life under the sound of my voice. And I pray it will be the Holy Spirit that will be the minister. I pray, oh God, we'll just be an oracle, a useful tool in your hands. And I pray, Father, that the needs which are many, those that are afflicted, oh God, just coming to service this morning, feeling the burden for those that are in need, not only physically but emotionally and spiritually, those that may be bound. May the divine power of almighty mighty God strike those that are in prison, oh God, and burst the prison bars of and bring the captive out, oh God, by the power of the word. Let no bondage of the enemy be able to withstand, I pray, Lord, the power of your word today. Bless your people. Anoint me, Father. anoint the hearers and we will be careful to give you all the praise in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I would like you to turn in your Bibles if you would please to mark the 10th chapter. We're going to begin reading at the 17th verse. And then I will read also a few verses from John 14 from the 17th verse of Mark 10. And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running and kneeling kneelled to him and asked him, good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, why callst thou me good? There is none good but one that is God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Defraud not. Honor thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him. And said unto him, One thing thou lackest. Go thy way. Sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me. And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions. Then please in John the 14th chapter verses 1-6. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. Thomas said unto him, Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus sth unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the father but by me. May God bless his word to us. So you have your seats. As you that have been attending the services here know well, I have been speaking in from the last four services uh that brother Brandham preached and they've been really astounding to myself. Uh this 14th chapter was the second last service and Mark 10 was the last service. Now I have been speaking the last this is the third service I want to speak on your identification for rapture your identification for rapture. We've been taking those that are not merely types but we have strengthened that very very substantially by saying that the same spirit the same holy spirit of God that caused the people prophets to speak certain things and caused them also to do certain things. They lived uh they lived a certain life. They lived and acted out certain events and those events were actually prophetic uh of of uh something that was going to take place. Something that they did on an individual basis is going to happen or is taking place now or has taken place on a on an entire uh uh group of people called not only a church but a bride of Jesus Christ. There were brides in the Old Testament that are distinct type of the bride right now. But we wanted to strengthen the fact that they are not just a type or a shadow, but it was the spirit that was in them &gt;&gt; actually lived out a prophecy and the same spirit now in you is fulfilling that prophecy. And that's very important because that gives the true meaning of identification. Identification as we have been establishing is the act or process of showing to be the same. Not to be like but to be the same. Not that the that that life back there in in Rebecca or that life life back there in Ruth or that life back there in Enoch or because Enoch the seventh from Adam is a type of the bride and uh the bride is typed all the way through. We're not like that. It is the same spirit, the same life. And that that's the only way you can look back by knowing the spirit that is living out through you. You look back and can identify not I am like that but that was me. &gt;&gt; The same as Christ was in Abraham. Christ was in Isaac. Christ was in Moses. Christ was in David. Christ was in the the kings and the prophets. It was Christ in him in them that was reflecting that portion of his life that he would live out. And that is why he could look back and quote those scriptures and say they must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He was now fulfilling those. &gt;&gt; And as I said and it bears repeating, John the Baptist is asked now great group of people have come out to hear him. Who are you? Well, he he could have said, uh, you know, you know my father, you know my mother, you've seen me, you know, uh, I've lived here amongst you, you know who I am. No, he said, I am the voice, not I am like the voice, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. That spirit that was speaking there spoke of me. And that same spirit that was in Isaiah when he said it is the same spirit that is here now living it out. He spoke it. I'm living it. Amen. I said they lived it in a shadow. We're living it in a reality. They lived it in the negative. We're living it in the positive. But it's the same spirit all the time. &gt;&gt; That is identification. &gt;&gt; When you take out that uh photo in your passport, that is me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not like me, that's me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we also thought uh and spoke. I think it's also significant. It is timesensitive. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't show your baby picture at the passport office. &gt;&gt; You can't go to the border with your baby picture. &gt;&gt; It won't have very much resemblance for most of us at least. &gt;&gt; It's got to be current. &gt;&gt; So, we're not here talking about what we were 20 years ago or 10 years ago. We're talking about what we are now. Identifying where we are now. This is a moving living word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. denominations and maybe and those in the message can look back and say, "Oh, you know, we're not just talking about what the message was 40 years ago." We're talking about what the message is today. &gt;&gt; And we have to be able to identify ourselves and say, "I am that." &gt;&gt; One thing that you want to be able to identify and that is this last service I thought so significant. The last service prophet is laying down leadership. I want to speak about identify leadership for your rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to identify leadership. &gt;&gt; Opinions are plentiful. Opinions are cheap. Anybody can give an opinion, give advice, tell you what they think. But then when disaster strikes, &gt;&gt; who you going to nail it to? Who you going to pin it to? &gt;&gt; But God has granted leadership. &gt;&gt; And I thought that was that is so astounding that that would be the last service. &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation, that is something. And I'm going to speak in all sincerity this morning once again. I I have felt a different just a different angle on my whole entire ministry. In fact, during this time and I'm going to just speak easy. I'm just going to speak as God enables me. I'm going to say really what's on my heart. I've been speaking the meetings as though they're my last each time. I said, "What do I want to say to this congregation?" I want to say this to you this morning. You might be able to afford some measure of error in the kind of advice, the kind of counsel that you get, the kind of leadership that you take. I'm going to be speaking about leadership, but you cannot afford any error in leadership for the rapture. &gt;&gt; You cannot afford any guesses. So, &gt;&gt; you can't afford to be influenced. &gt;&gt; Influence is also leadership. And I want to speak about this. Brother Brandham said in leadership, now I don't want you I don't want you to take this just as quotes out of a message, &gt;&gt; but that he's laying out he's actually laying out the seeds of what you need &gt;&gt; to enter into the rapture. &gt;&gt; And he said because the people didn't understand it, I'm sure he said, "I have a message I feel from God. It's a little odd to some people and I can't help being no more. He said, I just got to be what I am. I don't mean to be different. It's just that I am living at a changing time. And I thought, how incredible in his last service to say, I am living at a changing time. when Jesus was telling the disciples and once again he's they're sensing that something is happening. They're sensing that a changing time is coming even in his in the ministry of Jesus Christ because he's speaking different and I can say and he can't say anything different. He has to say what he's saying because he's at that time. He's at that season. He has to tell them don't be troubled. &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God. believe also in me and in my father's house are many mansions and I go now this was this was this was not accustomed they weren't accustomed to hearing this I go &gt;&gt; where are you going I go to prepare a place for you and if I go &gt;&gt; it's got I go I go I go where are you going this was the one who came by their way and said follow me &gt;&gt; and they did and they left all and they followed they left father they left mother and you have also &gt;&gt; many of you have left your way of life you left even your uh perhaps your uh your your job your profession some have &gt;&gt; some have left families some have left friends and associates and whatever Ever more they've left. Many of you here have left the everything that you knew. Like Abraham, your father, you left your culture. You left what was comfortable to you. You left your environment that you knew and was and you felt stable. You left your comfort zone &gt;&gt; and you you were thrown to the wind as it were. You jumped over the cliff as it were and then hoped you could swim after you jumped in. You cast yourself &gt;&gt; into the at the mercy of God said I don't know but I have heard something and I must go this way you find your type and Rebecca and uh once Eleer found her he said I cannot wait they said well delay give us a few days at least give her at least 10 days he was a stranger just came in and and simply because of the act of of Rebecca watering ing uh giving him to drink and then watering all of the camels. And incidentally, this was a very remarkable thing. Camels, as you know, hold a lot of water to begin with. But that wasn't all. Ele was not by himself. He had men traveling with him and they sat by while this woman refreshed the word of God. &gt;&gt; While she refreshed and did you say the word of God? Yes. because Alzar had already prayed. &gt;&gt; Let the woman who who waters the camels, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that was the word of God. And the prophet said she watered the very word that carried her back to Isaac. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't know it. She didn't know she was refreshing the word. She didn't know she was refreshing the power she was going to ride on to go back to Isaac. You didn't know when you responded the way that you did. You didn't know that you were actually refreshing. &gt;&gt; The word of God, &gt;&gt; which is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's pleased with what he saw. &gt;&gt; We didn't know it and you've left and departed. It was the same Jesus. It must have comforted them to hear him say as they stood by and watched him minister. And he'd say to the Pharisees which were at him one day and he said, "You're from beneath and I'm from above. &gt;&gt; You're of this world. I am not of this world." And they absorbed that. They took that in. But they had been called by him to follow him. So they were just following along. He's not of this. They were hearing strange things. He's not of this world. He's of another world. His kingdom is not of this world. It's of another world. They don't know anything about that world. All they're doing is following him. They're following him through the great miracles and the signs and the astounding things and they're identified with it. All they know this is the master. This is our Lord. This is the Messiah. We're following him. Hallelujah. We're following him. And now he starts to say, you know, I I go. Where are you going? We're the ones who've committed ourselves to you. We're the ones who've given up everything. We We We've left our We've left our incomes. We've left our jobs. We've left our fishing behind and our boats and our nets. We've left it all. Where is it you're going? Well, he said, "Well, you know the way, but we don't know the way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the way and I'm the truth. &gt;&gt; I tell you it it was an answer but it didn't completely answer. They were caught into the vortex of a rapid uh fulfillment of events one after the other and they saw him coming into judgment. They saw him betrayed. They saw him before pilot. They saw him in the sentence. And surely there must be coming uh uh uh some kind of a release, some kind of a great mighty deliverance because it's impossible that all of this happens and the whole thing is caught in a vortex and their leader is being ripped away from them. &gt;&gt; We've given everything to follow this this one, this Jesus of Nazareth, this God man, &gt;&gt; this man that spake like no other man. Oh, how can he be taken from us? And the prophet has gone to that for leadership because of the rich young man which we'll come to in a few moments. It was Jesus who had said to them, "Follow me and I'm going to make you fishers of men." And the word that Jesus used was, "Come hither. Come here and come now. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That word has such emphasis. It's so potent. It's pregnant with meaning. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Come, follow me. Follow me." He's saying, "Come here. &gt;&gt; Come now," it comes with exclamation marks, I tell you, God, he expects us to move &gt;&gt; and to move quickly. &gt;&gt; We're not here to sit and weigh everything out. But when he speaks to you and I feel that this meeting today is a part of the camp meeting. &gt;&gt; We've been in a camp meeting for some days here now and this is in preparation. I feel it's just moving on up. I have no idea what brother Spencer's going to be ministering on. But I feel that this is I have felt a great anticipation for this family camp more so than any other that we've ever had. It's about 19 years now or 20 years. And and I feel more anticipation because I feel that God has been moving us into a realm, moving us into a sphere, friends. We ought to be able to receive a whole lot more than we could last year. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Follow me. Come here and come now." The simplicity of this call &gt;&gt; did not require any interpretation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't need that deciphered. &gt;&gt; They didn't need to look around at one another and say, "What did he mean?" &gt;&gt; The Lord speaks to us in such simplicity. &gt;&gt; When we get it, you know, we often complicate it. &gt;&gt; Well, how will we do it and this and that and all we begin to we we begin to weigh out all the things that are around us. Forget all of those things. If he says come, that's the thing to do. &gt;&gt; And when should I do it? Do it now. Do it with everything that's in you. Do it with all the energy you have. I will come and follow you. &gt;&gt; But then when Jesus he began to speak further, verily, verily, I say unto you, he that enterth not in by the door into the sheepfold, but climbth up some other way, the same as a thief and a robber. But he that enterth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. And to him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadth them out. And they heard these things, and they said, "Oh, how wonderful to have such a shepherd is this." &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is not only to be following, but to be led. &gt;&gt; Those are two things. One can lead, but they have to have somebody follow. He says, "But &gt;&gt; the sheep follow me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He leadth them out and they follow him. &gt;&gt; Jesus was establishing. And when he puteth forth his own sheep, and he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. What a comfort. And a stranger they will not follow, &gt;&gt; but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers. In other words, the sheep recognize the voice of the shepherd and they follow him. It doesn't they just hear his voice, but they follow him. &gt;&gt; There's a further aspect to this word follow. A further aspect to what was in the mind of Jesus when he said come and follow me. The further aspect of this call that is also in included in these words follow me and here's the further aspect it's not only just come come hither and come now but it is come from a further compound word come hither to this place in an urging and calling to come here. It is to come to this place. And so Jesus as he first met his disciples says, "Follow me. I'll make you fishers of men." And as they followed in further on, he said, "I'm the good shepherd. My sheep hear my voice." Oh, said that's us. We identify with that. &gt;&gt; But further in the depths of the mind of Christ was when he said, "Follow me." He didn't just intend to take them to feed the 5,000 on the hillside on the grassy slopes. He didn't mean to just follow him along the seashore of Galilee and to catch a, you know, to to uh bring them from their fishing occupation. He didn't mean just that. He meant because Christ knew where he came from. He's going back to and now he's simply here on a mission to gather that the those that are going to give birth to the early church and he also is going to enlighten them to reveal to them I when I said to you follow me the intent is I'm taking you to another place &gt;&gt; and he comes to this and a prophet comes to this very verse these very verses for his last mission, his last words before his lips are sealed. And this is what God in Luke 17:30 in the revealing of the son of man. The son of man is saying these last things before nothing more will be uttered. &gt;&gt; And it is, is it significant? It's more significant than anybody in this building will ever realize. And a prophet is taking a young man. And I'm so glad for our young people that are going to be going to camp. I'm preparing you for some great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come follow me. Come quickly. Come now and you'll come hither &gt;&gt; to this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you're not even where you used to be a short time ago. Everything's changed for you. &gt;&gt; Your whole environment, &gt;&gt; your whole your whole character, everything's changed. When Jesus came and first uttered these words, "Come and follow me. Follow me and I'll make you fishers of men." They were bound by tradition. They were keeping all the laws and they all the all the law of the Old Testament and keeping all of those as Rabbi Richmond talks about 613 laws and they keep all those laws and all those rituals and that's all they knew washing of hands and washing of pots and pans and and the cooking a certain way and absolutely everything to a certain letter and now they begin they begin to walk into a release from that begin to see all that There's only a only a picture of a shadow of something to come and realizing now even the Passover lamb here's the lamb of God for John who was a voice of one crying in the wilderness said behold the lamb of God. Oh the whole world is taking on a different meaning. this one we're following is completely different and we're being we're walking into a new world and he actually shall we say in in a in I don't want to be scientific but in an emotional their whole psychological aspect of their whole life changed &gt;&gt; and they found themselves in another place &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham said they could in no wise go back &gt;&gt; to where they were. And I say anybody who has actually been birthed by this word, you're spoiled forever. &gt;&gt; There is no way you can go back to where you were. You'll be the most miserable person on the face of the earth. You cannot know this kind of deliverance, this kind of richness of the word of God. You cannot you cannot have absorbed this message and and go back to what you were feeding on before. &gt;&gt; I say never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; You and a good number of you were Catholics. Go back. Can you go back and kiss your idols and hold your medals around your neck and twirl your beads? You can never do it. You can never go back to the life in the world and your drugs and your drink and all the rest of it and the little uh uh superficial uh you know circles and parties and all of that nonsense. It's empty. It's vain. &gt;&gt; It's gone and gone forever. And you're in another place. You're in another place. He's already moved you into another place. I'm hither to this place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're ruined. &gt;&gt; As far as the world is concerned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God in his grace &gt;&gt; and his abundant mercy has taken and already moved you. &gt;&gt; You have followed him. &gt;&gt; Seated here today. His just a multitude of miracles. Oh, brother Mike, sister Debbie, it's not just a miracle in the making. It's miracles that have already happened. &gt;&gt; And it is a miracle in the making. &gt;&gt; You are a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil or anybody else say anything otherwise. &gt;&gt; You're a miracle. He said, "And will the church go through the tribulation or will the church go before the tribulation?" He said, "Well, I've heard that before. You might say, you might hear it your last time. Let this be the time." He said, and he was asking people to raise their hands. Said, "God bless them. God bless you." He said, "Don't be included in the world. You get out of there." &gt;&gt; God's coming for his church and he's chose you and that's the reason he's speaking to you. He said the message is urgent. Come quickly. &gt;&gt; You might be here and have not made a maybe you've been even in this church for months or years and haven't made the kind of commitment. And I say the message is urgent. It's more urgent today than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; Come quickly. &gt;&gt; Come follow. &gt;&gt; The true leadership of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You can't afford to error on this one. &gt;&gt; You can take a lot of advice, hear a lot of opinions, hear perhaps a lot of criticism and faultf finding, and I'll enlarge on that later on, but find out where it's going to take you first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you want to find the leadership? You say, "What is the leadership?" The leadership is the angel. I'll send an angel before you. That's our type. &gt;&gt; I'll send an angel before you and he will lead you in the way &gt;&gt; and you'll find a woman and that woman will come. And the prophet said the angel of the Lord will persuade her. You have been persuaded. You've already come under the influence of the angel of the Lord and he has persuaded you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] That's the leadership. &gt;&gt; Not somebody that sat in the church persuaded you, but the angel of the Lord persuaded you. Said, "Well, I heard I heard a message preached delivered by a servant of God." That is right. But that message first came from the angel of the Lord, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, down to his prophet, messenger, and from there to the ministry, and the ministry picks it up. Otherwise, we don't have a message. That's how the angel of the Lord speaks to you. &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of people say, "Well, I think it ought to be this way. I think it ought." We're not into I think it should be this way. &gt;&gt; We're interested under the foolishness of the preaching of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it may be haltingly. It may be even with incorrect words or whatever more. And in weakness, his strength is made perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus began to tell his disciples of his going away to prepare a place for them, they could not understand it. In his final hours of teaching, the subject of following became very difficult to understand. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't grasp that. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again. &gt;&gt; This was this was for us 2,000 years down. For them, totally different. You've been following him. Now, put yourself there. You've been walking with them. You're going Well, they also knew that he'd been born there and and raised. And they walked with him and they ate with him and they slept with him. He said, "I'm going away and I'm coming back and I'll receive you." And all of this set them in a blur. They didn't understand that. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. Says, James, do you do you, Peter? Do do you, John? Do you do you understand that? Whether I go, you know, and the way you know. All we've been doing is following him for three over three years. This is mysterious. And Thomas, he got enough courage says that Lord, we know not whether thou goest. We don't know where you're going. And if we don't know where you're going, how do we know the way? They knew one thing that they had to be following him. &gt;&gt; There was no other choice. They had to be following him. We don't know where you're going. And if we don't know where you're going, how can we know the way? Perhaps they thought you've led us all this time and we have followed you and now we do not know where you're going. Then how are we going to go to that place? How are we going to go? When he said I go, that also had depth to it. And you need to understand, you need to know. I need to know. And I've been pondering this now. And I've been in these messages for some weeks, actually some years, but some weeks for these services. He said, "I go." That is a that's a wonderful word. I go, but the actual word in the Greek is to lead over. &gt;&gt; I go, but the purpose of my going is to lead you over. &gt;&gt; To continue on one's journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet in his second last message, things that are to be, third last message. He said he was telling them, this is in John 14, he's in reference to John 14, our scripture reading. He said he was telling them in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. He was telling them that after death there is life because I go to prepare a place. He refers to the same scripture. He said Jesus. Now here we have a prophet describing what the Lord Jesus is seeking to bring to them. &gt;&gt; And he's seeking also to bring to us that afterlife. Now, we listen as this this whole generation, this whole civilization that we're in, all the different peoples of the world believe in an afterlife from a happy hunting ground that the natives had and uh the Muslims they have there uh heaven with all the 70 virgins or whatever more. If they give themselves in some terrorist blast or whatever more and everybody's got uh something that is beyond that some bliss that is a hoax &gt;&gt; perpetrated upon humanity that is not the case and Jesus in this leadership Jesus in these in the in the Bible told of the rich young ruler and the prophet takes him up and moves him through the scripture because there's three accounts of a rich young man or or a man who had abund abundance. And the last account is when he says, "Uh, what'll I do? I've increased. My barns are full. I know what I'll do." And brother Brandham ties him up as the same young man. &gt;&gt; The same young man. And now he's come to the end of his life. He's he's now in his mature years. I'm going to uh I'll tear down my barns and I'll build greater. That's what I'll do. And I'll lay it up in store. And a and a god spoke to him, "Thou fool, this night." When was he a fool? He was a fool the day he ran to the knee to the feet of Jesus and kneel down and said, "What must I do?" And Jesus told him, and the prophet said, he turned down eternal life that day. &gt;&gt; That's when he turned down eternal life. &gt;&gt; He said he was confronted with eternal life. And he uses those words over and over again. He was confronted with eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want to talk about this young man. &gt;&gt; He's not unlike a whole lot of young men and young ladies that are here. &gt;&gt; I don't say that you are him. I don't say that's your identification, but we have we have some common ground here. He said as he was a boy, he said probably the first hand that took him by the hand was this kind mother and no doubt he said or it may be that that mother's hand is laying silent in the grave someplace. But he said that was the first hand that took him and led him in his first steps and he had leadership. And then she committed him to a teacher, a school teacher. And I thought of our teachers. I Brother Brennham is relating how his upbringing was impeccable. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; His upbringing was right. &gt;&gt; His mother brought him up right. But he was just brought up as the people in Palestine were brought up and he was taught in the religious order. But they said then he was given to the teacher. I thought of I thought of you young people that are here and I'm talking about senior young people. This young man said he was brought up right. He had such character. He had such integrity. He had the right kind of home. And then his teacher took him and continued to lead him. He had a good teacher. He'd been taught in everything. And he absorbed it. He had the kind of mind that could catch it. And he was such a fine young man, one that Jesus looked upon and couldn't help but love him. Right? &gt;&gt; He had something in him. &gt;&gt; He had an inquiring mind. He He wasn't satisfied with just what he had. &gt;&gt; And I thought, Lord, are you describing in this last service? Are you describing some that I'm going to be speaking to this morning? They come out of the finest of homes. They have the finest of mothers, &gt;&gt; the finest of fathers, and perhaps even spent seven years in the Bible way Christian Academy and had the finest of of teachers as far as I'm concerned in the world. &gt;&gt; This church ought to be able to say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; teachers, &gt;&gt; and when you're in a a public school, God watched over you and protected you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're here and you came to the house of God and you heard the word of God and you're under the influence of the word and then would go out of course and then you're under the influence of friends and your peers and and and the world and maybe had a little jobs and whatever more and and the whole world environment and what the other fellas are doing, what the other girls are doing and how they dress and how they act and how they speak and everything else. You don't want to be odd. And so you know those those things what really what they're doing when we talk about influence that's leadership. &gt;&gt; It's starting to lead you in a certain direction. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And maybe someone suggested you ought to try this or you ought to do this. That's leadership. And after the teacher was done with him and he had his schooling, then he was handed back to his father. And his father taught him in the ways of the ways of life, how to conduct himself, how to conduct his affairs, how to have his business in integrity. And he was he could absorb and have such retention that he just followed in his father's footsteps and came out a very successful young man. and had gathered of this world's possessions. Brother Brandham says, and he's not speaking of this man here, he's speaking of some here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, but he saw something &gt;&gt; that he wanted. &gt;&gt; He saw something that he knew was real &gt;&gt; and he wanted it. &gt;&gt; He actually identified it. and he wanted it &gt;&gt; but he says he didn't want the way it had to come &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's what he didn't want he didn't want the way it didn't it didn't fit him &gt;&gt; he didn't want the way it had to come you know there are many people and actually when the prophet was speaking this just imagine he's telling the people in his last service you see something you see a ministry here you see the supernatural here you see this mighty gift from God here and you know it's a of prophet ministry, you know, and you want it, you see it, you want it, but you don't want it the way it come. In other words, you don't want the leadership that it came through. You don't want this messenger. &gt;&gt; He was saying, "You want what I got, but you don't want me." &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; That's precisely what he said. Oh, you want all the bread and the the loaves and the fishes and you want all of that. You want I I realize why you want to make me a king. You want all these benefits. You see the power. You see the healing. You see the miracles. You see all these things. You want all these benefits. But you don't want the way it's coming. It's coming in such simplicity. &gt;&gt; It's coming in in such a fashion. You want something that's a little more dignified and something that's got a little more pizzazz to it. &gt;&gt; I'm using our own language. You want something that's a little more, you know, glossy and something that's a little better and something a little finer. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't want to be spoiled, &gt;&gt; spiritually spoiled. &gt;&gt; So, we want better preaching and we want better music and we want better singers and we want better this and better that. I just say, God, give us what he wants &gt;&gt; and give us how he wants it. give it to us in his order. All I want is the power of God in the house of God doing the will of God. And let God be pleased. &gt;&gt; Hey, the congregation say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; We want lives that are pleasing to him. This young man, he was something that the Bible says that Jesus loved about him. Now he's confronted with this leadership. He sees it. He wants it. I've talked I've prayed with lots of people that have come and gone in this congregation and they see it, they feel it. Brother Rod sang, I feel the pull. They have felt the pull and then they go and settle back and weigh it all out. Oh, my friends or my family or my boyfriend or my girlfriend or my children or my job or my this or my that or my Who's leading you? &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, who's leading you now? &gt;&gt; My position or my job or my wife or my husband or my friends or my circumstances? Who's who's leading you? Even, you know, we we occasionally we get experts that come into the church. Brother Brandham speaks about them. I've got quotes on them &gt;&gt; and they've got all kinds of advice. &gt;&gt; They can find everything that's wrong with the church. &gt;&gt; They can see this is wrong, this is wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong. But if you looked at them, &gt;&gt; they've never preached a sermon. &gt;&gt; They've never been a deacon. Right? &gt;&gt; They've never had the burden. Hadn't had to go to the hospital, pray for the sick. That's right. &gt;&gt; They know nothing about those burdens. &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about some of them even young men, young women perhaps. Young men not have no leadership over a home. &gt;&gt; Have never fostered children to lead children and see all the pain and agony that all that. But they're expert on it. They can tell me how to preach to that the young people need &gt;&gt; but they've never preached a sermon in their life. &gt;&gt; And then you know that kind of a person always is anxious to advise others &gt;&gt; on stuff they know nothing about. And I say God give you to be aware of that kind of thing &gt;&gt; because when I what I end up with as a pastor is wrecks on the side of the road and I have to pick up the pieces and sometimes I can't put the pieces back together. And even if God takes a hold of it, they're so wounded, they're so marred and they're left in some desolate place. Why? Because they took the wrong leadership. The leadership. You say, "What is the leadership?" The leadership is the angel of the Lord. The leadership is from him to the prophet of the age and from that to the ministry. &gt;&gt; And that is God's order. And God will never change that order. &gt;&gt; Never change that order. &gt;&gt; Advice, the world's advice, good intending advice. &gt;&gt; It's it's a dime a dozen. You know what brother Brandon calls it? Poison. &gt;&gt; Yes. He called it poison. Said he'll bring someone in in the quietness and fellowship with you, &gt;&gt; fellowship with you and shoot poison. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz it's criticism. &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the person that could stand up here and I am standing that could stand up and say, "You can find no fault with my life. &gt;&gt; I can find some fault with your life." And I found those kind of people even when I spoke to them, I speak about what about your life. Oh, they don't want to talk about that. Oh, well, you know, it's these other things and it's the other folks and the other people. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister, that kind of a spirit's a demon &gt;&gt; and it will wreck lives if it can. And that is leadership will will never put you, hear me, never put you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; In fact, it will keep you out of a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What spirit will put you in a rapture? The spirit that you see in Jesus Christ. The spirit that you see in the in the apostles of the early church and the spirit which was displayed in this day in the messenger of this hour. This message has the power to put the people in the rapture. This message is the leadership &gt;&gt; and that's the only leadership. &gt;&gt; It's the last service. &gt;&gt; Hear me now. It's the last service. The prophet spoke leadership &gt;&gt; and one man ends in heaven and one man ends in hell. &gt;&gt; One man accumulated everything he could. The other man gave himself and he left it and accepted the reproaches of &gt;&gt; the Christ as more treasure than that of the world, &gt;&gt; more than the power of Egypt, more than become a come of Pharaoh &gt;&gt; of the great superpower of the world. He could have been, in other words, he could have been the president of the United States, a superpower of this age. He could have been that president and he turned it down. &gt;&gt; He turned it down. Is it where to go to Jeffersonville? &gt;&gt; That's what he did. &gt;&gt; If you want to put it in our language, &gt;&gt; he turned it down. So, you can have your White House. You can have your Pentagon. You can have your power. I'm going to Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; They're going to Jeffersonville. What in the world are you going down there for? There's a voice. &gt;&gt; There's a certain sound. &gt;&gt; There's a certain something. There's a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I've heard a voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I didn't know it. I'm sitting in the 19th floor of the Toronto Dominion Tower overlooking Lake Ontario and have the I think I got the world in my hands for this ignorant little fellow from up in northern British Columbia. I thought, you know, uh things are coming out all right. &gt;&gt; At least I don't have to worry about where my next meal's coming from for the first time in my life. And my kids got, you know, the things that they need and and everything's coming up roses. Driving a nice car and telephone in the car. Even back in the 60s, I got a telephone in the car. Did they have telephones then? Yeah. Yeah, we had telephones. And God gave me a president that was just couldn't do enough for me. Wouldn't let me pay for nothing. Wouldn't even let me pay for the newspapers. Come in my home. We're going to pay the newspapers. we're going to you. He said, "Buy a house for the company and you live in it and I'll talk to the accountant and see how cheap we can give it to you." And he get to give it to the very rock bottom. I paid $120 a month for a four bedroomedroom, I mean fourlevel brick home on a creek bank and terrace back down. I Hey, I always knew the Lord was, you know, I knew it was going to happen someday, but I didn't know. and I'm just working away and oh, everything's just going wonderful. And then little voice inside. Little voice inside says, "Leave it." &gt;&gt; No, that can't be. That just can't be &gt;&gt; That can't be the Lord. Can't be this confusion. How can I leave it when he just gave it to me? &gt;&gt; Says, "Leave it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leave it. Go west. You must return. And finally, I had a dream and the dream troubled me terribly. And I had a second dream and it troubled me terribly. And I didn't know if I'd ever get down to see Brother Brandham again. But I had such a pull that I want to go back west. I I thought, well, maybe my f my father-in-law may not live too long. I didn't know my wife's dad. He'd had this heart attack. And brother Brandham said he'd be all right. I just didn't know what to do. And you know how long I struggled? Nine months. Nine months. You know, young men, young ladies, Brother Biscos knows what he's talking about. This actually happened. I thought, leave this job, leave this position, leave. Where am I going to live? Where am I going to take three children? One just coming into her teens. Where am I going to take them? I haven't got a clue where I'm going. It's not I'm moving to a church or something. I don't know. I don't have a clue where I'm going. And I bought a truck, a van. I've never told the congregation this. And I loaded all my stuff in that van. I told the owner of the company I'm leaving. One of the hardest times of my life. I went up to Dawson Creek and spoke at at a service there and I was I was doing it covertly. I didn't want my boss to know I was in British Columbia. So, I just flew from Toronto and I'm up there having a service and he heard and he traced me down and he says, "I want to see you. Fly to Prince George and I'll fly up to Prince George and see you. and he got a hotel room and we talked about big things. We talked about General Motors which I had negotiated a contract with and we talked about different things and you know things going big and finally I had asked some brothers to pray for me and I I'm certain that brother Brena Langd was there that night and prayed for me and I thought and I put it to the Lord while his brethren are praying if a certain thing happens then I'll know that now is the time to tell him that I'm done that I'm leaving and uh it did and and the thing was if he got if he found out that I was here and I had to make contact and he made contact and I went there. I don't know why I'm telling you this and I flew to Prince George and we sat there together and we talked about other things and finally his name was Art. Art Roberts. And I said, "Art, I'm leaving the company." That man went to pieces. Not because of me. I think just the sadness and the shock of it. And he he he treated me like a son. And I so appreciated it. I could do no wrong. He could let me pay no expenses. I went preaching. They paid the motel. They paid the gas. I didn't pay any expenses. I thought, you know, this is God. And that's why I was in such a confusion. How how do you leave this? You know, how do you leave this? I go preaching and take take the churches while the pastors were away on weekends. There was no message churches at the time. We go down to Fred Victor Mission. They had about 400 425 men meeting there every night. And we'd had services there. And the girls would sing and we'd have meetings. And the leaders come up to me and said, "You know, these people, these men, they just start coughing and they start making a commotion after just 15, 20 minutes. You can't keep them after 20 minutes." And I thought, "We're not just here to sing. We're here to sing and I'm going to preach." And I preached. We had the altar full of people. Men seeking God. And men came out of there with their lives changed &gt;&gt; and contacted us afterwards. And they said, "No one else who comes here has those kind of results." Well, we knew where it's coming from. we we have some knowledge where it's coming from. And I said, "Mr. Roberts, I'm leaving." And he broke down and he sobbed for an hour and a half. It was the hardest, one of the hardest times of my life. He just sobbed and shook till he couldn't speak. I didn't know, but I think he already knew he had cancer. [Music] And but I could not change my mind. And I gave him five months notice and I worked hard as hard and as as honest as I could and left and had an RCMP officer who was on vacation drive the truck out right away. If you're going to go God's way, you're going to have trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here he just gets loaded up right to the gunnels with this van. And I bought this van in an auction. And my boss said to me, it was one of the things that it didn't pain me, but it stung me at the time. He said, "I've lost respect for you, Ed. Instead of going back first class, you know, with a big Allied van and all the rest of it, I'm now now I'm starting to count my pennies. Now I got to pay for things." So, I got this RCMP officer and he's going to drive it. He calls me from way up northern in the boondocks of Ontario and he says, "I blew the motor. I blew the motor out of the truck. Now I got my stuff stranded northern Ontario and I'm going out of a job and it's up there and the RCMP officer's there and he only got so many days and I have to get a new motor for the truck." And then I bring my family out here in a little 19 ft trailer and parked it over the plaza. You can drive past it if you want now, but it was just a rat's nest. I think it still might be. I don't want to get sued, but up on the King George highway. And I parked that 19 ft trailer. And God, he saw to it that he made it real difficult because it rained. It rained and rained and rained and rained. And there we were, five in that little trailer. I won't tell you the rest of the story, but there was no church that I knew of to go to. And when I finally did go into one, Hollywood was just coming right on. Mini skirts, the whole works, coming right onto the onto the platform in this in those that are singing. And I said to my wife, I can't stay here. I can't let my children see that. I don't want my girls to admire those young ladies that are dressed like that. And we walked out and we were we were in the wilderness. Friends, I just want you to know it's not always simple to follow and go God's way. &gt;&gt; But God's way is the right way. &gt;&gt; God's way will always succeed &gt;&gt; in the end. And the truth shall prevail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you come through the test, God knows how to do whatever he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [Applause] I thank God for the for those experiences. I say this, I wouldn't I wouldn't go through it again for a million dollars &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't take a million dollars for the experience. &gt;&gt; It's God's way. Amen. Praise God. But when I confronted eternal life, when I confronted when I was confronted with eternal life, and I was I realized I realized that coming out of this man's mouth, this prophet messenger, this little man that was being turned out being turned out by the churches by the hundreds this little man called William Brham being turned out and spoken against. But when I heard the word coming out of just the scriptures coming out of his mouth, I saw something I wanted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw something that he had. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't see it any other place. &gt;&gt; I couldn't see it in myself. And I couldn't see it anywhere else. All I could see was questions and confusion and all kinds of things and turmoil amongst the ministry. And there I hear a clear sound coming out of his mouth. I thank God for grace to say whatever it takes. If it costs my family, if it costs my friends, if it costs my job, if it costs all the minister friends I have, whatever it cost, if it cost my ministry, I've got to follow this. &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to say that became my leadership because that is Jesus Christ. That's none other than Jesus Christ. And that needs to be your leadership. And I have to say to you, I'm trusting him to take me through into this rapture. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is no other leadership. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, you can error in a lot of areas of life. Don't error in this one. &gt;&gt; You only got one chance at this one. This is the rapture, the change of the body. Don't leave it to your reasoning. Don't leave it to someone else's advice. Don't leave it to a council of people. Leave it only to the word of God that has come to us. Glor, [Music] &gt;&gt; this leadership, your destiny. I hope I can make it the way I had to make it this morning. your destiny. Don't just trust this church. Don't just trust maybe something that you had your passport and your identification 10 years ago or 15 years ago. You want to know how it is this morning. &gt;&gt; You want to know that passport's current. Your identification is current. You see yourself in the word. You see yourself moving along. Your soul is fed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rebecca is our prophetic type. &gt;&gt; As I thought this as I just put it down. Rebecca is our prophetic type. And I spoke earlier that she had watered the very power that took her back to Isaac. I just want to look at her for a moment because there's something important here. in time of decision. He said, "And so she watered the camel, the animal, the power that was to take her home to her new home and anything." And another thing he said, "Did you notice when she went over now being blood relation, she was a blood relation, that is our type. &gt;&gt; We are a blood relation of Jesus Christ. He's not of a Jew. And he's not of a gentile. &gt;&gt; He is the blood of God. &gt;&gt; And you are not of just a human descent. &gt;&gt; God ordained that you would come and that the seeds would be mingled and would bring you down to this day. But you have been born again by the incorruptible word of the living God. And that word could only come by the created blood of God, the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? That's why the prophet called it the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; You have the token in you. It's a bleeding token. We have the very blood of God in us. &gt;&gt; We are the royal seed with royal blood in our veins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can you say that, brother Bisl? Because God has said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends, just so you can think about it. The word of God is stronger, more powerful than anything physical you may have. &gt;&gt; That's why healing is stronger than sickness. &gt;&gt; The word of God as the seed of God is stronger than the seed of the human semen by which you came into the world. By that seed and through the birth of a woman, you die. But by the seed of God, the spoken word of God, you live &gt;&gt; by the human nature, you have weaknesses that you've tried to overcome for years and they hang on. &gt;&gt; They hang on and you hate them. &gt;&gt; Is that not right? But by the supernatural seed, hallelujah, you have the nature of almighty God. You have the nature of God. I say that by the scripture &gt;&gt; being born again of the incorruptible seed of God. &gt;&gt; You have the nature of God because the seed carries that nature. &gt;&gt; So will I go on in my weakness? That's up to God. Whatever he does with you, &gt;&gt; however he molds you and fashions you and we're waiting for things maybe to drop off and we're waiting for other things to come on. And we're waiting. This is no license to continue on in sin. nothing of that. I'm talking about the human nature, &gt;&gt; the human weakness. &gt;&gt; Some are prickly and some are really backward and the ones that are backward wish they could be forward and the ones that are forward wish they could be backward. &gt;&gt; The ones who are noisy wish they could be quiet and the quiet ones wish they could be more &gt;&gt; expressive. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we're just not happy with ourselves. And &gt;&gt; as I've said here before, if we had the chance to remold ourselves, we'd all work ourselves right out of the will of God cuz he made you the way you are. &gt;&gt; He caused the families and the and the forefathers to come on down to bring you here to this day. But you are here. You came across a certain voice and something within you believed it. &gt;&gt; And at the time, maybe you didn't even know why you believed it. But you believe it &gt;&gt; and you can't help yourself. You believed it. You believed it in spite of yourself. You believed it in spite of your own reasoning. You just believed it and difficulties came and all kinds of adversity came and you continued to believe it and you felt like you were lost. As our brother uh Mike G sang, he you know at a low point at a low point but he wrote a song that's blessed multitudes. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't hit a low point? We all hit low points. &gt;&gt; Hit them regularly. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; So I hit a low point. So I'm not a biscuit. &gt;&gt; That's that's who I am. &gt;&gt; You are who you are. And if that can be so by a natural birth &gt;&gt; by a sperm from a father into the bedding ground of a human mother and can bring you forth into this world subject to sin and unbelief and all the rest. Surely, surely the seed of Almighty God that comes down into the woman of mind and into the soul, into the soul of a man makes him or her a new creature in Christ Jesus. Old things have passed away, have passed away, and behold, all things are new. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is what I'm experiencing." I don't care what you're experiencing. I don't care where you are &gt;&gt; because the di disciples might have said when at the time and this is what was part of my message when he said I go to prepare a place for you that that's one of the most beloved things and the prophet said he was telling them about a life hereafter he was telling them life doesn't end here this life continues right on and here the Lord Jesus is in such an intimate and there they're well that's not where I'm at I'm confused &gt;&gt; and Thomas Thomas voiced all of them Lord where are Are you going? &gt;&gt; We don't know where you're going. And if we don't know where you're going, how can we get there? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just made it simple. I'm the way &gt;&gt; you've been doing. Just keep doing it. &gt;&gt; Just keep following. I'm still the way. Hallelujah. You heard my word. Just keep following those words &gt;&gt; and you'll get there. &gt;&gt; You'll get to where I am. &gt;&gt; And where I am, there you'll be. And I'm going to come and receive you unto myself. And here he come. Luke 17:30. In the day when the Son of Man is revealed, here he comes down, I tell you, from the heavens, descending down into our generation. &gt;&gt; And he did exactly what he did when he was here on earth. He told them the secret of their heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he began to pull the people, pull the masses, &gt;&gt; and then spoke the word, and the masses left him. But out of there came one here, a few there, some over here. And I say, here we are today. Here we are today. &gt;&gt; We're here because we've heard a voice. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's no voice like it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know right well you can't go back where you were. &gt;&gt; You can never go back where you were. &gt;&gt; I defy any hutterite in this place and go back to a colony. If you can go back, you never did have it in the first place. I defy every Catholic, including myself, to go back to Catholicism. If you can go back, you never did have it. If you can go back to the world, you never did have it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; One of these days, I think I'm going to do it. I'm going to put up some pictures of people sitting in this congregation that that I know. I know from their pictures. I know what they wear. I'd like to I told brother Dave Chberov, I'm going to put his up. You want to see him coming out of the mud? I'm talking about literal mud with a cigarette in one hand and a can of beer in the other. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, he looks like he has just come out of the out of the west side of hell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, Brother David? &gt;&gt; And you don't mind me putting that picture up? He hesitated just for a moment there. Oh, where we've been, &gt;&gt; but we can't go back. Wherever you're going, Lord, that's where I'm going. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord came as leadership in this hour and it's the last thing he spoke was leadership. And I say I'm devoted and committed to that leadership. [Music] And if you can see anything that would seem to you to be worth following in this life and in this ministry, &gt;&gt; I say come and go with me &gt;&gt; and I go with you &gt;&gt; and let us journey together. And the Bible says of our type, our prophetic type, when they saw that Eleazar was not going to be detained anymore. I'm going to go. Please don't hold me back. I must go. So he said, "Then he blessed Rebecca and said unto her, thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them." Wasn't that a strange sendoff? &gt;&gt; Was a strange sendoff? The Lord bless you and cause you to be a mother of thousands. She hasn't even found the man yet. &gt;&gt; She hasn't even seen him yet. And let your seed possess, let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them. Could get into some pretty deep swimming water here, but I think I'll &gt;&gt; The woman has got a seed. The only seed she could bring forth was the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mary didn't have any seed. She had the promise word. Hallelujah. And we as a bride of Jesus Christ, we have the word, the promised word. We have the seed with us. &gt;&gt; That brings forth the image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Shove it over. Let your seed &gt;&gt; be the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of the of them which hate thee. And Rebecca rose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and here it is, &gt;&gt; followed the man. &gt;&gt; Oh, and people say, "I'm not going to follow a man." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Here. Somebody say, "You're following somebody." &gt;&gt; I've had it said to me, "I don't follow a man." Say, "Is that right? No, I'm not going to follow a man." In other words, you know, they're saying in a left-handed way, you're following a dead man. &gt;&gt; I'm not following a man. Oh, is that right? I talked to a Bible school student once said, "You want to talk about the serpent seed?" So, we talked about the serpent seed. And then when the serpent seed came right down so tight, they couldn't even answer it. They just went, they always expected to go to Genesis. I always start in Corinthians and go back to Corinthians, you know, where apostle Paul says, "Would the God be bear with me and bear with me? Indeed, I'm jealous over the godly jealousy. I suppose you only one husband, one husband, even Christ, you know, I present you chastening the virgin so on." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I said, "Who's Paul talking about? What's he talking about? You know, &gt;&gt; did did Eve have a headache? &gt;&gt; Is that what happened? They said was in her mind. Did she have a headache? Was she get migraines? No. I said her her productive organs. Anyway, he went back went back to John's gospel, the eth chapter, talked about the eth chapter. Jesus said, "You're of your father, the devil, and his deeds you do. you're of your father and I'm of my father. And he just se separates them right there trying to, you know, then they get in a place where they can't wiggle. They said, "Well, I just follow uh I don't want to follow a man. I just follow Christ." I said, "Okay." I said, "Uh, how was Bible school this year?" "Oh," he said, "It was a you know, I'm not too much of a book man." "Oh, did you study quite hard?" "Yeah." "Did you finish your exams?" "Yeah." "Yeah, yeah. You you studied though? Well, you know, yeah, I studied. I said, 'What'd you study? He stopped &gt;&gt; cuz he saw the trap was set. I said, "What'd you study?" And he held his peace. I said, "Books written by a man. &gt;&gt; You studied man's books? &gt;&gt; Dead men's books. &gt;&gt; You studied dead men's books?" &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're saying something to me about following a man? I say, "Glory to God. I'll follow this man &gt;&gt; as he follows Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Going to close right away. And it says, "And they followed the man." Now, we're talking about leadership. And I'm just closing. How have been if Eleazar said, "You know, Rebecca, I'm going to have prayer for you and uh you stay with your mother 10 days. I'm on my way. Uh, where are you going? Well, just go west or &gt;&gt; go out there. Uh, go across the desert here. Uh, hopefully the wind hasn't blown over the camel tracks and you'll find the way. Can you imagine Rebecca trying to find Isaac &gt;&gt; without a leader? &gt;&gt; She's our type. You're not going to find Isaac &gt;&gt; unless you have the God orained leadership to take you to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we all been there &gt;&gt; and we've said, "Who is this? &gt;&gt; Who is this that who is this wonderful, glorious one that I see rising &gt;&gt; out of the field? &gt;&gt; I see Christ. Oh my precious brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; I say to you in my closing comments, when I look upon the believers of the message, &gt;&gt; I see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I see him. &gt;&gt; I feel him. &gt;&gt; I hear him &gt;&gt; in ways that perhaps we don't recognize at the time, but I appreciate it. And as I appreciate you, I say that from the depths of my heart. I appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. and have a deep love. &gt;&gt; I said to my wife today coming to church, I I could never leave this place. Not simply because of family, but this is our this is our life. &gt;&gt; This is our people. &gt;&gt; I this is where this is where Christ has been made known to me &gt;&gt; in such a wonderful way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm filled with such anticipation for how he will lead us at this camp this year. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought of some of you young people are listening to me this morning and you have to don't forgive me but I had to bring it this way. You have followed you have been following and perhaps up till even now have followed the wrong leadership. You've got close friends and they might be here in this church, but you know they're not a good influence on you. You know that when you're near them, the influence and that influence becomes leadership. And you know, you know this morning, you know right now while I'm speaking, it takes you down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't lift you up. And if you were to say, "Brother Biscoll, what would you do?" Then if you were me as a young person, what would you do? Cut off &gt;&gt; every relationship. Cut off every friendship that's going to turn you away from this word, this Christ. Cut it off &gt;&gt; and begin to associate with others. &gt;&gt; Who would you associate with? I'd find some strong ones. I'd find some real established ones. &gt;&gt; I'd find some that had real spiritual integrity and character and someone I would not be ashamed saying he or she is my friend. &gt;&gt; And I admire them. &gt;&gt; They've got something &gt;&gt; and I want it &gt;&gt; and I'm prepared to do what I need to do &gt;&gt; to get it. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking I I'm tired of the splash in the pan. I don't want you to come to camp and just have a a weeping time around the altar. I want you just to make a solid decision. Say, I am headed for the kingdom of God. I am done with the world. I'm done with all the flesh. I'm done with all this ambition of the teenage life. &gt;&gt; I'm done with it. a young man &gt;&gt; and the prophet said in leadership here you are young ladies young men and might be some here that aren't so young but I had a very special pull yesterday in my heart talk to our young people are going to be at camp and prepare them now and this service is a preparation. He knew it was there. And I say I stop. I say, you know it's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know this word is true. &gt;&gt; You know it's real. &gt;&gt; We don't have to invent stuff. I don't have to pound it into you. You know it's right. &gt;&gt; I've had people walk into such a so wound themselves and so hurt themselves. And yet if you ask them, "Do you believe that brother Brandham was God's prophet?" They say, "Oh, absolutely." And they do. &gt;&gt; But somehow they haven't found it within themselves yet to make that. We don't want to just say commitment, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But that final resolve, &gt;&gt; brother Ernie. So it's all over. &gt;&gt; And he knew it was there. He said &gt;&gt; he believed in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you do, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You do, too. You believe in it. And he wanted it. &gt;&gt; He actually wanted it. &gt;&gt; He knew it was here and he believed in it &gt;&gt; and he wanted it. &gt;&gt; But he but when he was confronted with how he had to do it, &gt;&gt; it was different from his ritual. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, I just want somebody to pray for me. I knew an old Norwegian. I guess he's Norwegian. His wife is Danish, I believe. My sister and my brother-in-law know him. Brother Steiner, Brother Brena. And this man up in Norway, I believe it was, he was in the hotel business. I think he inherited the hotel business. And of course, they sold alcohol and things. That's how you make your most your money. His mother was a real Christian and she was going to a camp meeting and some campgrounds and he told me this account more than once and he went with her just to be with his mother because his mother was quite aged and he heard somebody preach and it just so gripped him and he went out of there with a heavy weight and went back home and he got back to his room. And he was back in his room. He was so troubled. He could not rest. And now it was the middle of the night. He thought, "I have to go back. I have to somehow I have to find this Christ." And he went back. There was nobody in the camp campground. Stark, empty, middle of the night now, maybe one or two in the morning. And I think he found one man. They wanted to know where the minister was. He's up in a certain dormatory or whatever. He got to his room and knocked on the door and this old man got up. He had a long night gown on, you know, night shirt. And he came to the door. Yeah. He says, "I I I want to receive Christ or something. I forget how he said it. I need to be saved." The old man, come on in. The old man sat down. So you want to be saved? Yeah. He said, "Then kneel there." So he knelt down. The old man never moved. He says, "Now pray. Pray." He didn't hardly know how to pray. And him old man didn't do a thing. He let him sweat it out. &gt;&gt; You pray. &gt;&gt; You did the sinning. You do the praying. You did the unbelief. You do the praying. And he sat there while he prayed through. And that man became a preacher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not me that needs to pray. It's you that needs to pray. &gt;&gt; Not me that needs to believe. I already believe. It's not me that needs to commit myself. You got to separate from it. &gt;&gt; I'm done with the world. &gt;&gt; I'm done with the trash. &gt;&gt; I'm done with the magazines. I'm done with the videos. I'm done with all this nonsense of the world. And down inside, you know it is. And that you say, well, does it take that? It takes that to get it. it. I see it and I know it's here and I want it. But will you do what it takes to get it? &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't get it any other way. I'm not talking about having a little better life here. I'm talking about the rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about following that leadership into the rapture. Amen. And &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister, as far along as I've gone in this life, there's one thing I have no regret. I have no regret over every moment, over every hour, every day, every meeting I've been in. I have no regret. Have you made mistakes? Many of them. &gt;&gt; And anybody who doesn't say they've made mistakes is not telling the truth. &gt;&gt; We've all made mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's not the point. If you said to the disciples, he's talking about going and I don't know where he's going. Well, the reason why you don't know is the way you fellas have lived and you've been running scared and you've been this and you've been that. They could have found all kinds of things wrong with the disciples. It wasn't that. Jesus never pointed to that. He said, "I'm I'm going away and I'm going to take you and I'm preparing a place for you." He didn't talk to them about their weaknesses. He didn't tell them that you fellas need the Holy Ghost. They did need it. &gt;&gt; But he knew as they followed him, &gt;&gt; they would get what they need. &gt;&gt; Oh, my friend, I'm consumed with this this morning. They would get what they need. And as you follow it, you will get what you need. &gt;&gt; You know, it's going to be more real than it is this morning. &gt;&gt; This isn't some pie in the sky. This isn't some dream. This is This is a fast fading. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This life here is fast fading. &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone. &gt;&gt; And Jesus told of that rich young man, you know, I'm closing now in just a moment. I have actually seen people that I walked with and fellowshipped with I met one not long ago down White Rock. He was standing there in a pair of shorts and telling me, "I need to talk to you." Said, "Is that right? I can prove to you. I can prove to you that William Brandon was false." Said, "Is that right?" I'm looking at a a man so far from God, &gt;&gt; I don't even know how he can open his mouth and talking to a minister of the gospel &gt;&gt; and turned around and told me, "The night I was in your home is when I led them to Christ." He says, "That's the that yet today is the happiest moment of my life." And right after that going to tell me the very thing that made me what I am is all false. Right? &gt;&gt; And I can prove it to you. You know, all this intellectual stuff. &gt;&gt; Going to prove it to you. I thought, you poor soul. &gt;&gt; He said, for example, the serpent seed. I said, just a second. Open your eyes, man. &gt;&gt; Open your eyes. &gt;&gt; I said, it's everywhere around you. Look at this. I said, you got serpent seed everywhere here. He said, oh, come on. You not call that serpent seed. I said, well, then call it God's seed. What do you are you going to tell me this is of God? You going to tell me all this is of God? &gt;&gt; Don't tell me everything walking down this beach is of God. &gt;&gt; Get real. &gt;&gt; This is of Satan. &gt;&gt; I said this is his kingdom. This is his Eden and he's designed it the way he loves it. I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; I'm history. Stay here if you want. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can consider me a fanatic if you want, but I'm about to do a dance. I'm just as happy as I can be. I'm so glad I've committed myself to this life and this word and this message. It's none other than Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And I say to you in closing, &gt;&gt; whatever you need to do, &gt;&gt; to have it, do it. &gt;&gt; Do it. &gt;&gt; And say with Rebecca, if you want to say, "Rebecca's not just my type, but whatever was in her is in me." Now, if you can't make that connection, &gt;&gt; then she's not your type. &gt;&gt; And as I said at the beginning, the type is not just likeness. It is the same. So, I'm saying to you today, whatever was in this young woman &gt;&gt; of maybe 4,000 years ago, whatever was in her, you want to make sure today that the same spirit is now influencing you, surging through you, and moving you even in a way you cannot explain. &gt;&gt; And here's this young woman now. She's going to leave her mother &gt;&gt; and her family. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he won't delay. I must go. &gt;&gt; So they said, "Well, let let us hear it out of her mouth." &gt;&gt; Especially you women, young ladies, I'd like to hear it out of your mouth. Will you go with this man? She said, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a big &gt;&gt; long discourse. &gt;&gt; God's not looking for some great big long fancy prayer. He's just wanting to hear, I will go. &gt;&gt; I will follow. &gt;&gt; This man called Jesus Christ represented himself in a prophet messenger and I believe is speaking to my own soul today. I will go. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know it's here &gt;&gt; and you know he's here &gt;&gt; and you know this is the time and you know you want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's got a little preacher here telling you today how you have to get it. &gt;&gt; And if you just say, "Well, that's old brother Ed." Then you've already gone. You've already lost it. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, that's just a message. That's just, you know, I don't." Then you've already lost it. You say, "I see it. I know it's real. I want it. &gt;&gt; And I'll do whatever it takes." &gt;&gt; To have it, sir. &gt;&gt; Then you're in the right road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord's going to lead you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; And dear friend. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, We are going to cross over. &gt;&gt; And some of us are going to cross over. Some of you are going to cross over very young as far as this world is concerned. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you. Even though you've never had a boyfriend or maybe you have a boyfriend or maybe you've never married, you've never had children. You say, "Oh, I want to marry. I want to have children. I want this." I can just tell you the bliss of that &gt;&gt; is so far beyond anything here. &gt;&gt; And when we get across, when we get across, we say across is just a step. Just a step. It's going to be so simple. It's going to be so simple. You're just simply going to find yourself there. You're going to take one breath here and take the next one there. You're going to have one footstep here. You're going to take the next footstep there. And people aren't going to know where you've gone. It's a secret catching away of the church is that we will be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And this is my message of the rapture. Our identification is back there. I'll follow this man. I'll go this direction. And I'll do whatever is necessary to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, &gt;&gt; this is such a mighty hour that we're in. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure I'm not the only one that is feeling it. Oh God, to say I feel a pull would be a understatement. To feel the drawing of the Holy Spirit. I pray, oh God, that you'll move men and women. &gt;&gt; Move them to repentance. those that need to repent, may they turn from sin. May they turn from the works of the flesh. May they turn, oh God, before the destruction that will come in the tribulation that will surely come. For even now we see it in the making. Oh God, if it were not for this gospel, if it were not for what we are experiencing, if it were not for the fact that I know there are those and by your grace, by your promise, I include myself in the group, Lord, that you are have come to take out of this world. And oh God, I want so bad when I see what goes on around and I hear it and the conversation of the people. I feel as though I'm already in another world. You've already brought us into another place. Lord, I know that there's perhaps fathers here which are responsible to lead homes and lead families and lead children. They need to lead them by example. Mothers here, oh God, who have families, mothers who have already been called as the fifth gospel, let them be as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, a true witness. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the things and the works of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May they be a true witness and may they be relentless. &gt;&gt; May they say the same thing as the spirit speaks. May the spirit and the bride say the same thing. And today Lord I feel and sense the spirit and the bride saying come come for the and drink of these waters and let your thirst be quenched and turn from sin and death certain death. Lord I pray that you'll help us to bring a close to this service that will not really be a close but it'll just be another another step forward. I pray father that this service will not conclude until you have accomplished your work within the hearts of the people. Strive on oh God. Strive, oh God. I pray it'll not be as it was in the days of Noah when the spirit of God would strive no longer. Strive on speak on oh God. Draw them. Bring them. bring them with such a strong compulsion that they need to make their lives right with you. Oh God, a need to separate off from other forms of leadership. Oh God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll smite the enemy. I pray you'll bring uh uh you'll bring destruction to his efforts. I ask you, oh God, to loose, I pray in the name of Jesus, every struggling soul that is so bound, so tied down with chains, oh chains of influence from the world, break those chains. Oh God, now &gt;&gt; I say as the old Norwegian preacher, I say to you, forget who's beside you. You need to pray, pray. You need to con consecrate your life. Do it now. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't wait for another thing. I'd pray now as so it was the last five minutes of your life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just as I am without one plea, there's a lot of folks that's ready to pray. Not only with you, for you, but I say you need to pray for yourself. you and you've been hiding back there in the bushes of the congregation and say, "Well, nobody really knows." You need to rise up out of there and say, "I'm my heart's not right with God." And I want the people to know that I need their prayers and I need the deliverance of the Holy Spirit. And I'm coming here today to obtain that by the grace of God and by the power of God. And by coming here, you'll be saying, "I it isn't only something that I see. It isn't only something that I want, but it's something I'm prepared to pay whatever it takes to get. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to beg. But if God's dealing with you, you better respond. You hear the voice of Jesus Christ saying, "Come." He means come now. &gt;&gt; Come quickly. &gt;&gt; Come here. &gt;&gt; Stand behind beside him. Don't don't don't let the service slip down into a Sunday morning meeting just closing. &gt;&gt; Don't let it happen. You'll be missing it. &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice that's inside just now. &gt;&gt; I want everybody to be in prayer. If you've ever taken my word, I ask every believer to be in prayer now just as I am without one plead but that my blood was sh for me and Thou fix me. Come to thee, oh lamb. How come I come? I come with whom I am. and waiting on to bring my soul. of one dark one to thee whose blood can cleans each lamb of God. I'm going to invite whoever God has been talking to. If you don't come, that's fine with me. I haven't got any agenda and I'm not trying to win any medals. I'm talking to you like my family, like my children, like I'd talk to my own daughters or my own sons if I had them. If God is speaking to you, then I'd say you need to you need to respond to him. If you don't, then it's him you're rejecting. &gt;&gt; It's his voice you're rejecting. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you don't respond, you can respond in your seat. You respond where you are. But I wouldn't hide there. I wouldn't hide just behind the testimony of the whole congregation. I'd make a declaration today. Yes, &gt;&gt; I need God. &gt;&gt; I need deliverance. There's people and you parents, if you have young people or children that come here, I would come, if it were mine, I'd come and be praying with them. &gt;&gt; That's what I'd be doing. I'd be with them. And I would enter into prayer so they would know dad is praying, &gt;&gt; mother's praying. &gt;&gt; They have a deep concern for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe in prayer? Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; I want you to be praying. I want you praying now. We'll sing it once again. Just as I am and waiting not. Don't wait to rid my soul of one dark blood to thee whose blood can cleanse and will cleanse each part. Oh lamb of God. Speak out. Speak on, oh God. Speak on, oh God. Speak on. Speak on. Just as I am with one plea, my lamb by blood was shed for me. and that you have made me to come to the lamb of God. [Music] Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not come to him now?

Oh, we now come into the presence of the almighty God. The august presence we come in through the name of Jesus. That powerful name of Jesus, the name of every deliverance, oh God, the name by which every healing takes place. There are those, oh God, whose lives need to be healed. They're bound by Satan. They're bound by habits of life. They're bound, oh God, by all kinds of superstition. I pray that you'll send your Holy Spirit. Send your Holy Spirit into the room, into the automobile, in the place where they are in their apartment. Oh God, send your room, send your spirit, oh God, to that room. Send it with deliverance. Send them in a shaking time. Oh God, spare them. I pray the awful judgments. Oh God, spare them. We pray. Bring them. Father, bring them. Oh God, we pray. Deliver them from their spirits of religion.

We're just going to dismiss because have to have those that are going to camp soon go. I'm going to ask brother Dave Tberoff if you'd come just pray a prayer upon the people. We're not closing the service. We're just we're just taking a break. We're going to continue right on down the camp in the days and and I want you to be in prayer. Might much prayer about it. Will you do that for us? Hallelujah. Who knows? This might be the last one. May well be the last one. I want it to be the best one. I wanted to just go screaming out of the message throughout this whole land. Seattle, Tacoma, all of Washington, all the way down Oregon, wherever, all through this whole Northwest area. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This lower Fraser Valley. Your testimony has sounded throughout. There isn't anybody in this area but what knows something about this message because of your life. And I say, glory be to God. Let the hallelujah roll. [Music] Amen. God bless you, Brother David. Lord Jesus, it's Lord, we want to just thank you, Lord. It's just been incredible this morning to be in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, we've heard from you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We've heard from you and it's been clear. &gt;&gt; It's been clear, Lord. God, we're going to follow you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is eternal life, Lord. &gt;&gt; This world has nothing for us. Nothing. [Music] &gt;&gt; God, it just blesses me to see these young lives up here, &gt;&gt; to hear them calling on you. &gt;&gt; I know you could never turn that away, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; I just agree with brother Biscllow this morning. Lord, we just want it to be finished, Lord, for these for these lives, Lord, with the world. We just want it to be, Lord, have them let them have that experience that'll keep them from this world and the the pain and the hurt that it brings. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; God, [Music] what a start to a camp, Lord. [Music] Lord, we're just indebted to you. &gt;&gt; I'm just one one amongst many that have experienced your grace in this building, Father. And Lord, I just pray that you keep those there are those that commenced amongst us with poison. And we just want to pray that you would stop our ears from things that want to derail us. Lord, &gt;&gt; when you strive so hard from this pulpit to lift us up and encourage us, Lord, &gt;&gt; and we just pray for a spirit of love and unity amongst the the saints. [Music] Blessed brother Biscoll, Lord, &gt;&gt; we love him so much, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's given his life to lead us, Lord. And we appreciate it, Lord, what you have done through him. This word is it's given us counsel [Music] that set us on a solid rock. Father, &gt;&gt; I am moved. I am so thankful for another opportunity be to be washed in your presence from this world. Father, I know the people have to go. There's a lot to be done. Bless this place. Bless each one in divine presence, Lord. Let none none escape your dealing this morning. I pray, Lord, and we turn we turn thanks to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For all that you've done this morning. It's been it's been divine. It's been supernatural, Lord. &gt;&gt; And again, we pray for your servant. Bless him and his family. Strengthen him. And we do pray that you would continue to lead him as he leads us &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Brother David bless you. God bless you. We're just going to dismiss you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. like you to go in this sacred atmosphere and really seek to maintain it. You know, keep the conversation from getting off on maybe light frivolous things. Just maintain a godly atmosphere if you would. And we'll just carry it right on through the week. Hallelujah. Those you've been here that are praying, I want to give you some instruction. You take and you you you build on from what God spoke to you this morning. You build on from it. You're not going to lose it. Don't worry about losing it. You're going to build on from here to say, "I know that was God that talked to me. I know it was God that was pulling me, drawing me. And now now if if he does that, he doesn't do it in vain. He has a he has a purpose for it. And I want to instruct you. You go on from here." And you say, "What more would you have me do, Lord? What would you have me do?" But don't don't stop at this critical point. Brother Brandham said he was confronted with eternal life. And he wanted it. He saw it. He knew it was here. He wanted it. But it was how what he had to do. You may have friends. You may have something that you know you you hold in your heart and only you know it. But you say, "Whatever I need to do, I'm ready to lay it all down." &gt;&gt; That's good for everybody. &gt;&gt; A lot of us older folks, we need to do exactly that. We need to lay it all down. Leave all of our thoughts and all of our feelings, lot of our ideas. Say, "We just lay it all down. God, come and take absolute control in the name of Jesus Christ." You're all dismissed in Jesus name. I I tell you what, you know, to see Brother David up here, I even hesitate saying this, but you know, my heart, some of the most precious things in this congregation, I can't sh I can't hardly share with you. I only do it when I feel I have somebody that would forgive me for it. But brother David Jabbernov met a girl that he knew, just met her, you know, on a bus or something and he thought he'd just date her. How about a date? Oh, she says, "I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going to church now." Oh, okay. That's fine. I can I can handle that. And she was nice girl, pretty girl. You don't mind me saying it's Brother David? Says, "I go to church now." Okay, I'll go to church. You know, I figured he go to church. Comes to church, the little log church. And the girl goes one way. I don't know where she is today. And he's never moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He heard the call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He heard the voice. &gt;&gt; And he was transformed. &gt;&gt; Transformed from a lost bound creature. &gt;&gt; And God has used him to be a witness to his family, to his mother, and so on. Tell you what, friends, it's not been easy. It's not easy for any one of us, but it's worth it. &gt;&gt; It's worth it. &gt;&gt; And we're going to spend eternity together. You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't tire about that, do you? &gt;&gt; Appreciate you, brother David. God bless you. And you've been having large groups of young people over to your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep doing it. I enjoyed the hamburgers, too. God bless you. You're all dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. [Music]
