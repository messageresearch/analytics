[16:04] [Music]
[16:26] [Music]
[16:38] [Music]
[16:42] may not be
[16:45] [Music]
[16:52] [Music]
[17:08] [Music]
[17:15] hey man how many can attest to that
[17:19] we're not gonna leave our children
[17:20] behind
[17:21] amen they are love gifts from God to us
[17:24] we have brother Joseph and sister Naomi
[17:28] Guerrero okay that's good
[17:32] and brother Joseph and sister Naomi God
[17:36] has blessed them with a baby boy and
[17:39] they the baby
[17:41] Joseph is 2 2 months 2 years 2 months
[17:45] old and I understand brother Joseph your
[17:48] father's here he's upstairs and we want
[17:52] to greet you this morning in the name of
[17:53] the Lord Jesus hey man
[18:00] Jesus took time and took the little ones
[18:03] up in his arms and so we're gonna take
[18:05] time as we get ready to hear the word of
[18:07] God this is a part of it and this little
[18:10] bundle of joy is named Joseph in the
[18:13] Bible or the Hebrew for the name Joseph
[18:16] means God will increase God will
[18:20] increase so I thought I would this this
[18:24] morning I took out of Genesis 39 verse 2
[18:28] the Bible says and the Lord was with
[18:31] Joseph I want you to just to think about
[18:35] that the Lord was with Joseph and the
[18:38] Bible says he was a prosperous man and
[18:40] he was in the house of his master the
[18:44] Egyptian and the master saw that the
[18:47] Lord was with him the Lord was with
[18:51] Joseph he could attest to that and that
[18:54] the Lord made all that he did to prosper
[18:57] in his hand so Joseph has a tremendous
[19:03] connotation the son of prosperity and I
[19:09] want you to think about this sister
[19:11] Naomi and brother Joseph he was called
[19:14] the son of prosperity when he was in the
[19:16] pit and his brother sold him you say
[19:21] well that was not prosperous but we need
[19:23] to understand what God thinks is
[19:25] prosperous and what the people think
[19:27] that's prosperous
[19:28] he was in the pit he was prosperous
[19:32] Joseph was at Pont AFER's house who was
[19:35] a governor who was very wealthy and the
[19:38] world would say Punta fer was prosperous
[19:42] but not so the Bible says Joseph was
[19:46] prosperous yet a slave had nothing
[19:50] he was prosperous he went to prison and
[19:54] wherever Joseph went he was prosperous
[20:00] so what we call prosperous and what God
[20:03] calls prosperous we have to look this
[20:05] morning that this couple have named
[20:07] their child specifically Joseph the Lord
[20:11] will increase the prosperity of God is
[20:15] not in things or it couldn't be
[20:19] prosperous in the pit or in prison or in
[20:21] Potiphar's house the prosperity of God
[20:24] is the presence of God I want you to
[20:28] remember that brother Joseph for
[20:29] yourself for your child Naomi for this
[20:32] bundle of life the Lord has given you it
[20:34] does not matter whether it has a thing
[20:36] but if he's got God he's got everything
[20:39] he's a prosperous son because the Lord
[20:43] God is with him brother Branham said
[20:49] he's seen his life and begin to move and
[20:52] the next thing you find out that he's
[20:54] thrown in a hole deceived by his
[20:58] brother's supposed to be killed and
[21:01] thrown in a hole but he was taken up but
[21:06] Joseph foresaw that he saw himself in
[21:09] prison he saw himself in the dungeon he
[21:13] saw God was with him
[21:16] whatever he did he was the Prince of
[21:20] prosperity because God was with him the
[21:25] world might prosper in things brother
[21:27] Joseph
[21:29] but the world can't prosper without God
[21:34] everywhere Joseph went he was prosperous
[21:38] he was the Prince of prosperity
[21:41] may this Sun be the Prince of prosperity
[21:44] in this life and may the presence of God
[21:48] be upon him for brother Brown goes on to
[21:50] say for with Christ there is prosperity
[21:53] and Christ returns to earth all curse of
[21:57] the earth has taken away the deserts
[21:59] will bloom the rough places will be made
[22:01] smooth bring forth in abundance for he
[22:05] is the Prince of prosperity and I
[22:08] believe God's giving you the inspiration
[22:09] to name your son Joseph so prosperity
[22:15] spiritual prosperity is having the Lord
[22:18] and everything that you do having favor
[22:22] with God in all that you do and with
[22:25] this I would like to give you a
[22:28] scripture in Philippians two three and
[22:31] verse 20 but I believe all wrote for our
[22:35] conversation is in heaven from whence
[22:38] also we took we looked for our Savior
[22:42] the Lord Jesus and I looked up that word
[22:46] conversation is in heaven it means that
[22:48] we're a different people we're different
[22:52] because our citizenship is not on earth
[22:53] but our citizenship is from above Jesus
[22:58] believed he came from God and he's go
[23:00] back from God goes back to God the
[23:02] Prophet said we if we were ever in the
[23:05] mind of God to be eternal
[23:07] were going back to God God has blessed
[23:09] this home with Joseph the son of
[23:11] prosperity may he realize early that
[23:14] he's a citizen of heaven not just a
[23:18] citizen of Laodicea but he's a citizen
[23:20] of heaven he's come from heaven he goes
[23:23] back to heaven and he's eagerly may he
[23:26] eagerly if God should tarry look for the
[23:30] king of heaven may God bless this son
[23:34] brother Joseph sister Naomi
[23:46] let's pray
[23:52] father you bless this home
[23:56] with Joseph
[23:59] Lord his name means the Lord will give
[24:03] him increase may he increase in the
[24:06] presence of God increase in his life
[24:09] with God yes and may he know you Lord in
[24:12] an early early age the Prince of Peace
[24:16] mighty God the everlasting father may
[24:21] this son be born under Lord the great
[24:25] prosperity of God not in things but in
[24:28] the presence of God go with Joseph Lord
[24:31] she made the presence of God keep him
[24:33] watch over him and may there be a wall
[24:36] of fire all around him keeping him
[24:39] healthy keeping him focused Lord as a
[24:42] young boy looking to the king of glory
[24:44] we ask now that you bless him as we
[24:49] dedicate him to you Lord in Jesus name

[30:19] long standing but but we came in
[30:22] Thursday and we had a wonderful
[30:24] Christmas concerts so I want to
[30:26] encourage the young people the children
[30:29] keep on giving praise to our Lord and
[30:33] Savior it was truly a blessing for us
[30:36] and well you know Satan he does
[30:39] everything he can to to block us to stop
[30:42] us a storm came by Satan his in for

[31:09] burden but in the night between Thursday
[31:12] and Friday as you know nine hours time
[31:17] difference you have a jet lag so I woke

[31:23] the inspiration came so I want to take
[31:26] the burden off of you God knows all
[31:30] things amen so and I pray this morning

[31:43] nine-hour jet lag Amen you hear locals
[31:46] but we want to give glory to the king of
[31:48] kings amen hallelujah so why are we
[31:51] standing if we can take take the Word of
[31:53] God Cloverdale we will drop some atomic
[32:04] bombs this morning because the word is
[32:08] atomic power is that okay amen
[32:14] let us take John 1 verse 1
[32:30] say Amen when you're there in the
[32:42] beginning was the word and the Word was
[32:44] with God and the Word was God
[32:47] the same was in the beginning with God
[32:49] all things were made by him and without
[32:52] him was not anything made that was made
[32:55] in him was life and the life was the
[33:00] light of men
[33:02] verse 5 and the light shine it in
[33:04] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[33:06] it not amen now let's take Genesis 1
[33:12] verse 1 and I would like to read this
[33:25] verse with the revelation that God gave
[33:27] us brother Branham he says that God can
[33:34] mean it's it's an English word that I
[33:36] can have several meanings people make
[33:39] their piano of God make their car of God
[33:42] so brother Branham he says in the
[33:44] beginning Elohim a man because Elohim is
[33:50] the self existing one amen you piano
[33:54] your car or whatsoever they make God's
[33:56] they cannot be self existent amen so
[34:00] let's read it with that revelation so in
[34:02] the beginning elohim created the heaven
[34:05] and the earth and the earth was without
[34:08] form and void and darkness was upon the
[34:11] face of the deep and the Spirit of God
[34:14] moved upon the face of the waters and
[34:16] Elohim said let there be light and there
[34:19] was light and Elohim saw the light that
[34:23] it was good and elohim divided the light
[34:25] from the darkness amen hallelujah
[34:29] may God add the blessing to the reading
[34:31] of his word let's have a word of Prayer
[34:34] our precious heavenly Father Lord how
[34:37] thankful we are father to be gathered

[36:05] this morning a little Christmas message
[36:09] and for a title I would like to take let
[36:14] there be light and there is a man now we
[36:20] know that brother Branham he drew out
[36:23] the ages and how we know that we are
[36:27] living in the darkest age but we can
[36:30] focus on the darkest age but he has
[36:32] called us out of that so it's the most
[36:36] glorious age amen
[36:40] help me preach now amen Amon means so be
[36:44] it
[36:44] so let it be so Lord Amen and we know
[36:47] that Satan always tries to to to pervert
[36:51] everything we can look around and while
[36:54] I saw we were driving from the the
[36:57] Christmas concert going home and trees
[37:00] were everywhere and it was so dark
[37:03] powers were cut out it was so dark and
[37:07] that's Amen that was just with my
[37:09] natural eyes but spiritually everything
[37:12] is so dark glory be to God there is
[37:18] lights a man's talk now people because

[39:50] he's the only worthy one of all our
[39:52] praise so if there is any praise that
[39:55] needs to be given he deserves all our

[40:10] man he created the angels name in God he
[40:13] is an object of worship God loves to be
[40:17] worshipped listen now when a king is
[40:22] born even there's usually singing when a
[40:27] king is born says brother Branham Amon
[40:29] but then there was no greetings here on
[40:31] earth people to greet him so the angels
[40:35] came down and sang thinking about those
[40:39] shepherds Amen walking with their sheep
[40:43] and now an angelic host coming down I'm
[40:46] bringing you good news amen we're gonna

[41:02] Christ the Saviour
[41:04] gods and gellick hosts listen out who
[41:08] couldn't understand the mystery of this
[41:11] virgin birth but yet they sang and Satan
[41:18] can come around and tell you once you
[41:21] have the revelation of all the mysteries
[41:23] then I think you can start worshiping
[41:26] the angelic host never understanding
[41:30] this virgin birth but never the last day
[41:33] came down to worship the Saviour the
[41:36] king of kings goodwill to man Amon and

[44:05] he refers to job job 38:7 job

[44:20] joy we're without job you see the first
[44:25] time the Angels ever sang at a
[44:27] celebration it was in heaven
[44:29] Amen but the first time they sang to
[44:31] human beings was to the Shepherd's but
[44:35] where was Dow I'm asking you little
[44:40] pride where was the Amen before even the
[44:43] angels came down brother Branham tells
[44:46] it I was there I was there rejoicing I
[44:50] was there give him glory oh when he o
[44:53] exposed me to plan of redemption so come
[44:57] let us adore him

[45:03] hallelujah amen amen
[45:06] there was worship before there was
[45:08] worship 2000 years ago and there's
[45:10] worship now on the earth a man not an
[45:13] emotion but true pure worship Haman
[45:18] reading the verses Haman about the birth
[45:21] of Christ Amon and the children sang
[45:24] about it when the Shepherd's received
[45:26] the message you know what they said let
[45:29] us now go even unto Bethlehem so we
[45:32] don't know where exactly there were but
[45:35] they received a message let us go if it
[45:38] takes us an hour two hours three hours
[45:40] let us go we want to respond to the
[45:44] world and in nowadays lukewarm age we
[45:48] become so lukewarm Oh service tonight I
[45:52] have to drive a half an hour to church
[45:58] even if I have to go to Cloverdale and
[46:01] if it takes me five hours I want to go
[46:04] and a door Jesus is Savior amen amen god
[46:11] loves worship hey man so that was
[46:13] worship before there was worship 2000
[46:15] years and they're still worship amen
[46:19] amen you know there's power and true
[46:21] worship some people are against
[46:24] emotional and I'm not looking for
[46:26] emotionalism but believe me if your
[46:28] religion like Brenda Bram says don't
[46:30] have any emotion you have to change your
[46:32] religion an army when it goes to war
[46:40] they're not silent but now I'm speaking
[46:44] about an invincible army
[46:46] [Music]
[46:49] so we have everything to worship about
[46:54] because he's the great conqueror he is
[46:58] the great conqueror but he calls us the
[47:01] invincible army Oh hallelujah now it's
[47:05] not against the law correct me if I'm
[47:08] wrong it is not against the law here in
[47:11] Cloverdale here in Vancouver here in
[47:12] Canada to worship am i right but it is
[47:17] according to the word to worship him let
[47:21] everything that has breath praise ye the
[47:24] Lord amen there has to be singing says
[47:33] brother Branham he wouldn't have been
[47:35] sang to the people wouldn't have sang to
[47:37] him because they didn't believe him and
[47:39] that's the reason three little dots here
[47:43] it comes
[47:43] comma you might as well get it sorry
[47:48] brother Tom but here I go that's the
[47:51] reason today that people's ashamed to

[47:58] not ashamed of Christ he is my all he is
[48:02] my Savior
[48:03] he's my lord the reason that I never
[48:06] [Applause]

[48:09] hallelujah the great cathedrals won't
[48:14] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:15] they're set in there a classy
[48:18] ecclesiastical way that they will not
[48:20] receive it but listen how God's going to
[48:24] find somebody that he can get praise
[48:27] through Lord let it be me who shall I
[48:33] sand letting me be the order I heard a
[48:39] brother say one time IRA I prefer to
[48:42] lose my voice praising God aiming and
[48:44] screaming for nonsense

[49:15] mom I don't care my dad I personally
[49:18] want to praise my Lord and Savior when
[49:24] John saw in Revelation 5 a man he saw
[49:27] that no one was worthy he wept bitterly
[49:30] hey man but when the Lamb the perfect
[49:34] sacrifice Jesus Christ amen
[49:38] slain from before the foundation of the
[49:40] world when he stepped forward

[50:21] Lord and Savior how much we can thank
[50:24] him because we have an open book I told
[50:28] the church back home hey I told him I
[50:30] said but what is the real understanding
[50:34] your understanding of an open book we
[50:36] can quote it but what is it really
[50:40] oh yeah the seals been open the book is
[50:43] open there has to be a true revelation
[50:46] Oh hallelujah let's talk about Jesus a
[50:53] many many many men and there will be a
[50:56] people on the land that will live the
[50:58] Word of God because

[51:04] revelation ten a man now the angel say
[51:07] go take the open book so he opens the
[51:12] land they is the only one he goes opens
[51:15] the book now he tells John go take the
[51:18] open book John didn't need to go and beg
[51:25] he didn't need to go home please now
[51:29] John won't give me the book so some
[51:35] people think they have to beg and beg
[51:37] God doesn't want to keep the title deed
[51:40] for himself he gives it a man he gives
[51:44] us our inheritance Eamon but it's up to
[51:47] us by fate to step forward and say give
[51:52] me the open book hallelujah
[52:00] hello him said let there be light
[52:02] and there is mmm and I lo I love how the
[52:07] Prophet for some he's illiterate
[52:10] uneducated speaks bad or you know his
[52:15] grammar was bad but he could speak like
[52:18] a doctrine he could speak like a
[52:21] professor like a scientific he could go
[52:25] into the back parts of God's mind and
[52:28] how he exposed it he says let's just
[52:31] picture now as a little drama so you can
[52:34] get it so you can get it let's see now
[52:39] coming out of space where there was
[52:41] nothing let's make it a little white
[52:43] light like a mystic like like a halo and
[52:46] that was the logos that went out of God
[52:49] in the beginning that was the son of God
[52:51] that came out of the bosom of the Father
[52:53] that was in the beginning was the word
[52:56] and the Word was with God and the Word
[52:58] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[53:01] dwelled among us amen and he continues
[53:03] and says now see this is just like a
[53:06] child playing before the door I love it
[53:12] it was the son of God comma the logos
[53:15] and I can see him out there he spake and
[53:19] said let there be light and there was
[53:21] nothing
[53:22] something happens an atom I told you
[53:28] there's atomic power here in the Word of
[53:31] God an atom turned there and begin to
[53:33] were around this way and the Sun began
[53:36] to come into existence because he had
[53:39] said let there be now why do you quote
[53:42] that brother David just to show you the
[53:44] power of God's Word
[53:46] oh yeah I'm gonna nail it down amen we
[53:49] are here to destroy Satan's Kingdom this
[53:52] the smallest or the tallest no matter
[53:55] who you are we are here and bread it the
[53:57] brother Tom was quoting into the car
[53:59] even when the weakest of the saying goes
[54:01] on his knees
[54:01] oh hell is trembling amen amen amen
[54:06] so he continues there was nothing to
[54:08] make it from but he believed his own
[54:11] word and there was lights oh I see
[54:16] another play a piece fly off it's a
[54:18] meat-eor after a few millions a year or
[54:21] a hundred billions of years and people
[54:23] still scratch their head don't worry
[54:26] hello him said let there be and there is
[54:29] a man he goes another one flying of the
[54:33] Sun he goes on amen so here's brother
[54:35] Branham a man in the mind of God he's
[54:38] explaining what happened mm-hmm amen
[54:41] what is he doing writing his first Bible
[54:49] the human beings once looked towards the
[54:52] heaven he puts all the stars in the
[54:54] heavens the zodiac starting off with
[54:56] what the Virgin amen ending up with Leo
[54:59] the line the first coming of Christ
[55:01] second coming of Christ
[55:02] amen amen amen the Virgin in the line of
[55:05] the tribe of Judah amen so how is it
[55:08] possible brother David I don't know but
[55:11] there is and it's important we have a
[55:16] deep revelation of that mm-hmm
[55:19] because now I'm gonna bring it to us
[55:21] what the word says about us amen oh I'm
[55:24] so good
[55:25] that he said there will be a bride
[55:28] without spot or wrinkle I didn't say it
[55:33] brother Tom didn't say it brothers
[55:34] didn't say he said it let their a be Oh
[55:39] hallelujah now when did I start birth
[55:46] genesis said a man has written let there
[55:49] be a firmament in the midst of the water
[55:50] Simon I'm just gonna quote him rapidly
[55:52] but let her waters under the heaven be
[55:54] gathered together unto one place and let
[55:56] the dry land appear he continues let the
[55:58] earth bring forth grass and it was good
[56:01] let there be foul fish and it was good
[56:04] so he continues let there be let there
[56:06] be and it was good amen and God said let
[56:09] us make man in our image after our
[56:11] likeness and let them have dominion over
[56:13] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[56:14] the air and over the cattle and over all
[56:16] the earth and over every creeping thing
[56:18] that creepeth him on the earth so God
[56:20] created man in his own image
[56:22] the image of God created he him male and
[56:25] female created him
[56:27] now if we go a little further in Genesis
[56:30] 2:18
[56:31] and the Lord God said so so far the
[56:34] creation it was good it was good it was
[56:36] good it was good now and the Lord God
[56:38] said it is not good that the man should
[56:40] be alone I will make him help me for him
[56:46] God had already in his mind a bride so
[56:54] the whole creation was it was good but
[56:57] now it is not good because it has to be
[57:00] a bride now a word is a thought
[57:05] expressed now as I said before there is
[57:09] power in the Word of God never forget it
[57:14] children never forget it there's power
[57:17] in the Word of God amen Isaiah 55 says
[57:22] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[57:26] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[57:30] void but it shall accomplish that which
[57:33] I please and it shall prosper in the
[57:37] thing whereto
[57:38] I send it so now in other words whatever
[57:42] God said will happen will happen let
[57:51] there be light and there is now brother
[57:57] Branham deals with that because let
[57:59] there be light says what if they
[58:00] wouldn't have been like we don't know
[58:02] whether he is God or not but because he
[58:05] just said let there be light and there
[58:06] wasn't see but now then God when God
[58:10] speaks and we see it is then that's the
[58:13] light that shines forth , the truth of
[58:18] the word that's when God speaks you see
[58:23] there is light and life and he continues
[58:28] saying it is God's spoken life my words
[58:34] are spirit and truth
[58:36] amen oh yeah yes God spoken life amen so
[58:42] whatever God says and whatever God does
[58:46] is perfect John 1:4 says in him was life
[58:52] and the life was the light of men verse
[58:56] five and the light shining and darkness
[58:58] and the darkness comprehended it not
[59:00] another translation says the light
[59:04] shines in darkness and the darkness has
[59:07] not overcome it oh I love that
[59:11] now light has a strength of power I was
[59:18] thinking I was getting ready to turn off
[59:21] all the lights but I won't go there but
[59:25] light has a power in it when I was in my
[59:28] room and Bretta tomes I had a candle it
[59:31] was dark
[59:33] amen it was dark but this little candle
[59:37] I found everything in my room I didn't
[59:40] bang into the wall the little light so
[59:44] no matter how little your light is and
[59:47] you think it is
[59:49] it is much more powerful than the
[59:52] darkness that is around you so stop
[59:57] finding excuses but I'm too small I'm
[1:00:00] too little my little line my this my dad
[1:00:02] no the smallest of the light forces
[1:00:08] darkness outside let there be light and
[1:00:13] there is a many many many many man Oh
[1:00:18] from the very beginning God wanted a
[1:00:20] light listen psalm 119:105 thy word is a
[1:00:26] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:00:28] path now if God believe his own word
[1:00:32] what about that's the bride easy
[1:00:36] question but I hope you have a deep
[1:00:38] answer to that and say yes Lord
[1:00:45] so we have to believe the whole Word of
[1:00:48] God now God had a plan
[1:00:51] it's a Christmas message little Jesus
[1:00:57] God Himself amen but it's important that
[1:01:01] we don't forget that it's still God
[1:01:04] himself almighty all-powerful now God
[1:01:08] had a plan and he explains the natural
[1:01:12] woman
[1:01:12] Adams bright aim and maybe fell for
[1:01:16] Satan's scheme against the Word of God
[1:01:18] how how did he fell by reasoning it so
[1:01:25] let's let's not reason don't know I
[1:01:27] don't even try to reason believe only
[1:01:31] believe a man Eve fell from reasoning
[1:01:33] she fell from grace by listening to
[1:01:36] Satan's lie and her way we can say yeah
[1:01:41] that a man but you know what after God
[1:01:45] had her fortified behind his word so as
[1:01:51] soon as you started reasoning your
[1:01:54] vacation which is the word of God you're
[1:01:57] out of the fortification Eve was
[1:02:00] fortified she was protected
[1:02:03] she started reasoning boom she fell from
[1:02:06] grace if she had stayed behind a word
[1:02:11] she'd have never fell
[1:02:17] so if Satan can get you on one corner
[1:02:19] that's all he wants that's all he wants
[1:02:23] and Eve she believed so much of it but
[1:02:27] yet she missed it because you can
[1:02:30] believe so much of the Word of God and
[1:02:32] yet miss it you need to take hundred
[1:02:36] percent of the Word of God when
[1:02:39] gentlemen to take the book didn't say
[1:02:42] give me chapter one to five and I leave
[1:02:45] the rest eat the little book so you can
[1:02:49] become the little book amen
[1:02:51] so disbelieving the Word of God aim and
[1:02:55] now this first Eve fell God has the plan
[1:02:57] and this plan is perfect he is first he
[1:03:00] fell the second will not fall but why
[1:03:03] brother David did God allow all this sin
[1:03:05] to come in the earth that's easy because
[1:03:09] God send there's a prophet I'm gonna
[1:03:11] tell him what he said how could he ever
[1:03:14] permits him to come in the earth if it
[1:03:16] wasn't for a reason just to back up now
[1:03:21] some things that we have said he says
[1:03:23] what was first the Savior or the sinner
[1:03:26] the Savior sure which is more powerful a
[1:03:31] savior or a sinner why did he let sin
[1:03:34] happen in the first place to show that
[1:03:37] he is Savior why does he let sorrow come
[1:03:45] o to show us that there is a true joy
[1:03:48] why does he let the night come to show
[1:03:51] us that there is a real day a many-many
[1:03:55] man why does he let tamper come to show
[1:04:01] us that there is real peace
[1:04:03] I touched a sensitive core there and
[1:04:08] that's the piece we want and the only
[1:04:12] way to have that piece a menace to have
[1:04:16] Christ in you the greatest gift that was
[1:04:19] given hmm the devil listener who is

[1:11:09] and set me down in the midst of the
[1:11:11] valley which was full of bones and
[1:11:14] caused me to pass by them roundabout and
[1:11:16] behold there were very many in the open
[1:11:19] valiant law they were very try what we
[1:11:21] are here the picture that is painted is
[1:11:23] now there are many bones and they're
[1:11:27] very dry very bad and he said unto me
[1:11:34] son of man can these bones live and I
[1:11:38] answered all Lord God thy knowest again
[1:11:41] he said unto me prophesy upon these
[1:11:44] bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones
[1:11:48] hear the word of the Lord as I say the
[1:11:52] law of God at these bones behold I will

[1:12:10] wherever now how do you explain that dry
[1:12:14] bones can hear the Bible says hear the
[1:12:24] word of the Lord come on now God's Word
[1:12:32] can never fail no matter how many dry
[1:12:37] bones there are no many hands no matter
[1:12:39] how long they'll be laying there
[1:12:41] God said prophesy again amen
[1:12:46] whoo oh and there's a bride rising up on
[1:12:49] this earth

[1:13:03] next king he wanted to anoint the next
[1:13:05] king they all came but he anointed David
[1:13:10] now what about you you are anointed

[1:13:17] anointing and God's Word will never fail
[1:13:21] it will never come back to me void
[1:13:24] without manifesting what I said says the
[1:13:27] Lord God prophesied over us there will
[1:13:35] be a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:13:37] hey man God's Word is perfect listen now
[1:13:41] let's continue just took a few examples
[1:13:47] but God's Word is so powerful there's so
[1:13:50] many types in his word brothers and
[1:13:52] sisters listen up Ruth for verse 21 just
[1:13:57] to show you
[1:13:58] Boaz came from the lineage of Salman
[1:14:01] Salman was married to Rahab that's Ruth
[1:14:04] for 21 and salmon begat Bors Boaz begat
[1:14:07] obed if we look to Matthew 1 verse 5 it
[1:14:10] says in Psalm Bri
[1:14:11] got boys of Rahab and boys begat obed of
[1:14:14] ruth and obed begat jesse and JP begat
[1:14:17] joseph the husband of mary of whom was
[1:14:19] born Jesus who is called Christ
[1:14:21] so now humanly speaking how could Jesus
[1:14:27] come from a lineage like that I'm
[1:14:30] talking humanly now I'm gonna talk to
[1:14:32] spirit leap but that's how Satan comes
[1:14:37] how can it be a perfect lamb look to the
[1:14:40] lineage okay
[1:14:43] ready let's go a few years before when
[1:14:49] Joshua went to take Jericho there was
[1:14:53] Rahab she believed the word when they
[1:14:56] came this is nothing but the truth apply
[1:15:01] the token and when we will come and yes
[1:15:04] the city will be destroyed
[1:15:06] thou household you and thy household
[1:15:10] come on now mom's dad come on mom come
[1:15:14] on dad you and I household applied a
[1:15:18] token and they will be saved now Joshua
[1:15:26] gives clear instructions Joshua 6:21 and
[1:15:30] they utterly destroy all that was in the
[1:15:33] city both man and woman young and old
[1:15:38] and ox and sheep and ass with the edge
[1:15:42] of the sword in other words you destroy
[1:15:47] every living creature now coming back a
[1:15:54] few years later I can see the high
[1:15:58] priest standing before Rahab and sow
[1:16:03] into this holy estate these two persons
[1:16:05] present come to be joined
[1:16:07] if there is any person here that can
[1:16:09] show a just case why they should not be
[1:16:12] lawfully joined together in this holy
[1:16:14] matrimony
[1:16:14] do you now speak or from hereafter
[1:16:17] forever hold your peace
[1:16:20] they were all destroyed Joshua the great
[1:16:24] Joshua made sure there was no living
[1:16:27] witness and I'll Joshua took sure he
[1:16:38] made certain all others know nothing
[1:16:41] against our son holiday yeah wonderful
[1:16:50] Savior
[1:16:51] unto us a child is born Amen Jesus my
[1:16:55] Savior God for Danis predestinated us
[1:17:04] Haman and I believe his word hey man
[1:17:08] whatever God says I say hey man
[1:17:10] and God as we saw he wrote his first
[1:17:13] Bible in the skies and the stars amen
[1:17:15] and when God made his covenant to
[1:17:17] Abraham he points back to his original
[1:17:20] word Genesis 55 and he brought him forth
[1:17:25] abroad and said look now toward heaven
[1:17:27] and tell the Stars is that we able to
[1:17:29] number them and he said unto them so
[1:17:31] shall thy seed be god always points to
[1:17:37] the word brother Graham said back to the
[1:17:40] word because the word in the beginning
[1:17:42] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:17:44] and the Word was God and the Word of God
[1:17:46] cannot fail hey man what are you talking
[1:17:49] about brother David well there come a
[1:17:52] royal seed of Abraham amen I Abraham
[1:17:56] received a natural seed Isaac but he was
[1:17:58] talking about a spiritual Amon it was
[1:18:01] pointing to the super seat to come amen
[1:18:03] and that was Christ was God's Word made
[1:18:07] manifest now in Jove Achara
[1:18:10] now we are Abraham's seed if we are in
[1:18:13] Christ there are two seeds of Abraham
[1:18:17] one is natural the other one was Christ
[1:18:19] amen so if you are in Christ you have a
[1:18:22] super seat super to what Abraham wants
[1:18:27] because you come by the Royal seed come
[1:18:29] out Christ and if you're dead in Christ
[1:18:31] then you are Abraham's
[1:18:32] children and you have Abraham's seed and
[1:18:34] Abraham's faith come on now and
[1:18:40] [Laughter]
[1:18:41] Abraham's faith was in God's Word
[1:18:45] regardless of what took place he called
[1:18:48] those things which were not as is all
[1:18:52] they were you know why because God said
[1:18:58] so come on now bride because God said so
[1:19:02] there will be a bride without spot or
[1:19:04] wrinkle a many many many men now what is
[1:19:08] the definition of a believer how many
[1:19:10] believers do we have here to this
[1:19:11] morning wonderful wonderful brother Tom
[1:19:16] okay they don't know what the definition
[1:19:19] is now just quoting the prophet a
[1:19:22] believer is the fate of God that moves
[1:19:27] in you come on now I'm not talking about
[1:19:35] mental fate now
[1:19:36] faith comes by hearing hearing all the
[1:19:39] Word of God no reasoning no thinking out
[1:19:42] believing the Word of God he that is
[1:19:49] perfect came to take my place but to
[1:19:52] bring me to perfection
[1:19:54] God had a perfect plan before the
[1:19:56] foundation of the world and we are here
[1:19:59] in 2:18 close to 19 doing what
[1:20:05] manifesting his script brother Branham
[1:20:09] another quote say we are the actors on
[1:20:10] the scene I don't want you to be actors
[1:20:13] that's not what I am what I mean by that
[1:20:16] people they act all kinds of strange
[1:20:18] things no you live by the word you live
[1:20:24] by the word you believe the word you
[1:20:27] speak the word Amen that's the actor
[1:20:30] live by the word become the word eat the
[1:20:33] book to become the book Amen God came
[1:20:36] down to reveal himself to reveal all the
[1:20:38] mystery
[1:20:39] amen and the disciples asked Jesus why
[1:20:41] do you speak in mysteries Matthew 13 11
[1:20:46] he answered
[1:20:46] said of them because it is given unto
[1:20:48] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:20:50] of heaven
[1:20:51] now I'm bringing it back to 2018 because
[1:20:53] it is given to you to know the mysteries
[1:20:59] that's why I myself and my prophet
[1:21:04] messenger to you a mouthpiece but to
[1:21:08] reveal the mysteries to you to you it is
[1:21:12] given to know the mysteries so we have
[1:21:14] no excuse now a mystery is a scripture
[1:21:18] it's a previously hidden truth now
[1:21:22] divinely revealed , but which is a
[1:21:30] supernatural element still remains
[1:21:32] despite the revelation oh where are you
[1:21:35] going okay very simple Abraham received
[1:21:40] the promise you will have a son he
[1:21:44] believed the Word of God Romans fork
[1:21:46] says and he staggered not at the promise
[1:21:48] of God through unbelief but was strong
[1:21:50] in faith giving glory to God you want to
[1:21:54] be strong and faith start giving glory
[1:21:56] to God God loves worship
[1:22:01] God wants us to hear him glorify His
[1:22:04] name so it's not emotion if you want to
[1:22:11] go a grow strong in faith give to God
[1:22:15] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:22:18] had promised he was able to perform and
[1:22:21] therefore it was imputed imputed to him
[1:22:23] for righteousness
[1:22:25] now the Scriptures were revealed to
[1:22:28] Abraham you will have a son he said amen
[1:22:31] Sarah we're gonna have a son he believed
[1:22:34] the word but a super narrow natural
[1:22:37] element remain what was it some lad
[1:22:40] morning he looked into the mirror and
[1:22:44] said I am changed
[1:22:48] that was the supernatural element but
[1:22:51] for us it's exactly the same you believe
[1:22:55] the word brother David how am I gonna be
[1:22:57] perfect
[1:22:58] Oh we'll tell you how you can be perfect
[1:23:00] Eamonn how I'm gonna be changed don't
[1:23:02] worry don't worry god knows what he's
[1:23:06] doing I shall be changed
[1:23:08] amen mortality will take on immortality
[1:23:12] Amon in the bye-bye world instead of
[1:23:18] fussing and trying to find out believe
[1:23:22] the word give glory to God hallelujah
[1:23:31] how can I be perfect very simple God
[1:23:36] looks through the blood of his son
[1:23:39] perfection comes by Jesus Christ and
[1:23:43] Jesus Christ only now let's take a
[1:23:48] little time to talk about perfection
[1:23:53] God was manifested was in his son Jesus
[1:23:57] Christ then he came to a virgin bird
[1:23:59] conceived by a virgin overshadowed by
[1:24:01] the Holy Spirit God Himself came down
[1:24:04] into a blood cell now again brother
[1:24:08] Brown he goes into such a clear
[1:24:11] explanation
[1:24:13] the scientists tried to find out but
[1:24:16] look he came down into a blood cell and
[1:24:19] wrapped the blood around him the blood
[1:24:23] cell coma the germ of life of God
[1:24:27] Himself wrapped in this blood cell that
[1:24:31] brought the son Jesus Christ now what
[1:24:37] does he do by that to make you perfect
[1:24:41] and to bring you back into fellowship
[1:24:46] and he brings you through that blood
[1:24:49] cell into himself do you get it says
[1:24:52] through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:55] what is that blood cell listen the blood
[1:24:58] cell of the Lord Jesus that in
[1:25:01] veiled the life of Jehovah you want to
[1:25:06] talk about little Jesus you can talk
[1:25:08] about little Jesus who but the life of
[1:25:11] Jehovah himself was in the little Jesus
[1:25:14] a many many many man God Himself created
[1:25:19] that blood cell a many many men and
[1:25:23] listen now he continues that in veiled
[1:25:26] the life of Jehovah comma and we can we
[1:25:30] say all together we we coming through
[1:25:36] the blood cell become a part of that
[1:25:40] life I'm gonna talk about atomic bombs
[1:25:46] so comma deity itself lays in the man
[1:25:51] that's received the Holy Spirit you are
[1:25:53] a son I'm a Branham by birth and a part
[1:25:56] of mr. and mrs. Branham isn't me and if
[1:25:58] you become a son or a daughter of God a
[1:26:00] part of Det lays in you he became me so

[1:26:10] we don't find excuses mine are smaller
[1:26:14] than yours and - we are all guilty and
[1:26:20] you know what only a judge can give a
[1:26:25] verdict that's right huh only the judge
[1:26:30] can give a verdict but glory be to God
[1:26:33] the great wig one came down and said
[1:26:37] taste this mr. Lawry
[1:26:44] the judge became my lawyer
[1:26:51] I was guilty also guilty but then he
[1:26:55] came down he said case dismiss brother
[1:26:58] branham said it's like you've never done
[1:27:00] it in the first place you want to know
[1:27:02] my first place way back in the mind in
[1:27:05] the back parts of God oh yes hey man and
[1:27:09] now I can only be perfect through Christ
[1:27:12] Jesus dropped the charges

[1:27:21] beloved I've loved you the wedding band
[1:27:24] is already slipped on the finger hey now
[1:27:30] Christ listen now we'll talk a little
[1:27:34] about predestination is that okay we
[1:27:41] think that here things happen we people
[1:27:43] say it happens by chance by no nothing
[1:27:48] happens by chance
[1:27:49] listen now into it right in the middle
[1:27:54] of the heart is a little place in a
[1:27:57] human being that isn't in an animal a
[1:27:59] little place where the soul is and
[1:28:03] Christ was speared through there so that
[1:28:08] the blood cell was pierced tore loose
[1:28:12] that blood cell and set the Holy Spirit
[1:28:16] at liberty for God to call through there
[1:28:20] and bring believers through the blood
[1:28:23] cell back into fellowship with himself
[1:28:25] again oh my he says through the washing
[1:28:29] of the water by the world therefore he
[1:28:34] alone is worthy of our praise
[1:28:41] happy Christmas blessed Christmas he
[1:28:48] provided a perfect sacrifice a man and
[1:28:51] we should remember Calvary every single
[1:28:53] day and Christmas should be a day of
[1:28:57] worship and now not only the 25th or the
[1:29:00] 24th and to you and to me and to us is
[1:29:09] given a way to come back into fellowship
[1:29:13] again so now the predestination this
[1:29:18] soldier thought just to make sure he's
[1:29:24] dead mm-hmm okay
[1:29:28] in the important bowls in ready for a
[1:29:33] bomb the flesh only veils the blood the
[1:29:37] blood is a life that's the only way to
[1:29:39] keep life in a body for the skin and a
[1:29:40] flesh and a tissues and the senior and
[1:29:42] so forth to hold the blood in their
[1:29:44] place so they can give life to this
[1:29:46] tabernacle that I'm dwelling in now
[1:29:48] that's what veiled God from mankind was
[1:29:52] the blood and the sinew and the skins of
[1:29:54] Jesus Christ the Son of God the
[1:29:56] unadulterated bird of his who god the
[1:29:59] father overshadowed the Virgin Mary and
[1:30:01] created in her the blood cell of his own
[1:30:04] being , the creation and in there his
[1:30:10] skin kept it from man so there was a
[1:30:15] veil like the Bible says which is his
[1:30:18] skin that kept it from man but one day
[1:30:22] the sin of man opened up his heart with
[1:30:26] a spear and his blood ran out in a
[1:30:28] manner his blood ran out on the ground
[1:30:30] it was given freely for the sins of the
[1:30:32] world and it's revealed today glory be
[1:30:35] to God it's revealed today and as that
[1:30:38] blood came forward also came to spirits
[1:30:41] and through the washing of the water by
[1:30:43] the blood
[1:30:44] through the spirit we are born into the
[1:30:46] kingdom of God now a little soldier
[1:30:50] thinking he's just going to make sure
[1:30:52] somebody's dead Oh hallelujah God's plan
[1:30:58] is perfect this spear went exactly on
[1:31:01] the right spot to make sure that blood
[1:31:04] cell was mob liberators set free
[1:31:09] why because way from the beginning he
[1:31:13] had his pride on his mind he wanted a
[1:31:16] way to bring her back to fellowship
[1:31:18] again glory when that blood cell because
[1:31:24] of sin was pierced yonder it freed God
[1:31:28] yonder the only thing between the
[1:31:35] mankind and Jesus God Almighty was the
[1:31:41] skin come on now so many people miss it
[1:31:50] so many people miss it but there's a
[1:31:53] bride chosen a man and she won't miss it
[1:31:57] hey man she hears the word she receives
[1:32:00] it and says Amen that's a the Lord amen
[1:32:05] now amen in the Old Testament if a man
[1:32:08] walked through that veil it was sudden
[1:32:10] death and it's that not to go through it
[1:32:14] now once where it was there to go in now
[1:32:17] it's death to stay out receive ye the
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost he was freed I love how
[1:32:30] brother Bram says it freed God yonder
[1:32:33] liberated hallelujah why was that for
[1:32:38] for me for you
[1:32:41] happy Christmas
[1:32:44] [Laughter]
[1:32:46] Jesus by one sacrifice perfected forever
[1:32:51] his church we are then perfect through
[1:32:55] Christ Jesus you've never done it at the
[1:32:59] first place you've never done it to
[1:33:01] begin with
[1:33:02] case dismissed brother David how can you
[1:33:05] say a thing like that I know I know my
[1:33:08] case I'm a hard case but God by His love
[1:33:14] and mercy he loved me before before I
[1:33:19] even was here but he said this is my
[1:33:22] beloved this is my beloved
[1:33:25] I choose you who come let us adore him
[1:33:34] hey man now listen God gave His light in
[1:33:41] this generation like never before he
[1:33:46] came down and opened a book all the
[1:33:48] mystery all the loose ends have been
[1:33:50] revealed why to reveal Christ
[1:33:54] what's the open ever revealing Christ
[1:33:58] revealing who he is and who we are now
[1:34:02] on August the 8th 1963 what a
[1:34:05] coincidence
[1:34:07] in 63
[1:34:09] one of the biggest robbery took place in
[1:34:12] England millions were robbed Brad Abram
[1:34:16] on in turn on the light 64 says false
[1:34:19] light caused the greatest robbery in the
[1:34:23] world that the world ever had in England
[1:34:26] not long ago the greatest robbery that
[1:34:28] was ever performed was done by a false
[1:34:30] light 7 million dollar robbery is done
[1:34:34] by a full slide and slowed the train
[1:34:36] down and Scotland Yard couldn't find the
[1:34:38] men they got away
[1:34:40] so slicky Satan is so slicky be careful
[1:34:48] kids young people elderly Satan is so so
[1:34:54] leaky
[1:34:58] that was known as the greatest robbery
[1:35:00] that always was ever done by robbers and
[1:35:03] in the natural now this was in the
[1:35:06] natural they were playing with the
[1:35:08] signalling system they played with the
[1:35:11] signalling system that made the train to
[1:35:14] stop easy robbery they got away with it
[1:35:20] never knew where it was how and so on
[1:35:23] but now the greatest robbery that was
[1:35:27] ever done to the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:35:28] is done by a false light glare of some
[1:35:33] other age and rejecting the lights that
[1:35:36] predicted for this age a false light a
[1:35:42] glare of yesterday don't walk in the
[1:35:44] glare of yesterday walk in the warmth of
[1:35:47] the s oh and today don't pull yourself
[1:35:55] down into a denominational shade we need
[1:35:58] to ripen under that light let there be
[1:36:02] light and there is light what light the
[1:36:07] light of the s oh and the Sun hallelujah
[1:36:15] now there is power in that light you
[1:36:19] know that light can make dry bones live
[1:36:28] can make that a royal seed that's been
[1:36:31] laying there for years comes to life
[1:36:37] what poles it is light
[1:36:41] there can be layers and layers and
[1:36:43] layers and layers of concrete but that
[1:36:46] seed under the light of the sson will
[1:36:51] come forth it's not maybe perhaps know
[1:36:55] it will come forth a many many men now
[1:37:00] what's the matter it's caused the
[1:37:04] greatest robbery it's taken Christ from
[1:37:08] the church that's the greatest robbery
[1:37:13] of the church and remember the cold
[1:37:16] creed light will not ripen the seed of
[1:37:18] today so don't go back to another age
[1:37:23] God revealed his word to us oh it was so
[1:37:28] good in this age and it was so good in
[1:37:30] this age I want to live in my age what
[1:37:34] is my age
[1:37:34] bride age Lahori I want to ripen under
[1:37:42] that seed hey under that lights now
[1:37:45] Malachi for he is not the message
[1:37:49] he is the foreigner of the message what
[1:37:53] is the message Christ Christ is the
[1:37:59] message amen now that's why he came down
[1:38:03] he came down and took all the loose ends
[1:38:06] to reveal his true identity and our true
[1:38:09] identity and this message is perfect the
[1:38:14] Word of God is infallible God send us a
[1:38:20] son of man but revealing the son of man
[1:38:25] that's what it's all about
[1:38:27] brother says what's the opening door
[1:38:29] revealing Christ and now after the
[1:38:34] opening of the seals brother Branham
[1:38:35] says my Bible became a new Bible
[1:38:39] brother David it's getting complicated
[1:38:42] now no no it ain't because in the Bible
[1:38:46] there are so many types
[1:38:50] pointing back to the seals stop pointing
[1:38:53] back to the bride to Christ and the
[1:38:55] bride when God revealed a word this is
[1:39:00] like a new book ok let's take one
[1:39:05] example of Ruth and Boas is that still
[1:39:07] okay if you have a jet Lake
[1:39:10] stand up start worshipping you can sing
[1:39:14] a song Ruth and Boas which is a type of
[1:39:20] Christ and as a bride amen now we can
[1:39:23] see in Ruth she's gleaning in the field
[1:39:28] God has supplied a chief servant you can
[1:39:34] read it in the Bible
[1:39:35] Eliezer but in chapter 2 and I'm when I
[1:39:42] say early years of course I'm pointing
[1:39:44] to Rebekah but it was a chief servant in
[1:39:46] chapter 2 Ruth is introduced by the
[1:39:51] servant to the chief himself you can
[1:39:56] read it who's the chief himself her
[1:39:59] kinsman thank God for a servant in our
[1:40:05] age yes a wave sheaf we can't we can't
[1:40:11] we have to be thankful
[1:40:12] but now the Kingsmen says do not glean
[1:40:17] in another field you have found favor in
[1:40:23] my eyes the kinsman say don't know
[1:40:28] somewhere else
[1:40:30] my fortification is my word in my field
[1:40:34] your insecurity you have found favor the
[1:40:40] bible says grace in my eyes the
[1:40:46] kinsman's wants he wants her to stay in
[1:40:48] the field why to teach who he is so if
[1:40:57] you want to try elsewhere you'll never
[1:40:59] know who you are
[1:41:01] you'll never know who you are now after
[1:41:07] chapter 2 in Ruth there is no more
[1:41:11] mention of the servants because now it's
[1:41:15] time for Ruth and Boas in route 3:17
[1:41:23] Ruth received six measures of barley six
[1:41:28] seals in 317 so route 317 and he said
[1:41:32] these six measures of barley gave him II
[1:41:34] and he therefore he said to me go not
[1:41:36] empty unto thy mother-in-law verse 18
[1:41:38] then said she sit still my daughter
[1:41:41] until they know how the matter will fall
[1:41:45] for the man what a prophetic word for a
[1:41:50] man will not be in rest until he have
[1:41:54] finished the thing this they what a type
[1:42:00] now
[1:42:01] the kinsman redeemer and now the seventh
[1:42:06] is what it's a secret there is silence
[1:42:10] for the world is what's going on what is
[1:42:16] it
[1:42:17] Boaz himself it's not a public show it's
[1:42:23] not for the whole public but there's an
[1:42:26] invisible union going on hey man and
[1:42:29] that's going on right now a man
[1:42:32] invisible union of the bride and the
[1:42:35] bridegroom where the world miss it a
[1:42:38] million miles away people will still
[1:42:41] even be quoting in ants but they didn't
[1:42:45] take the whole book so therefore they
[1:42:47] miss it but how thankful we can be a
[1:42:52] many many men why is there silence he's
[1:42:55] telling his secrets to his bride you are
[1:42:59] my beloved I chose you I love you
[1:43:03] hallelujah
[1:43:04] happy Christmas
[1:43:09] the message is about the bride because
[1:43:14] what is the world bride it's the
[1:43:16] manifestation of the hour
[1:43:18] what hour now this day the manifestation
[1:43:23] of this hour
[1:43:25] now you say ram ram in the Serpent's sea
[1:43:29] we got new light on it no you haven't
[1:43:34] that's what the devil come to Eve with
[1:43:36] some new light you don't need no new
[1:43:39] light you need to walk in the light that
[1:43:42] God's already put here that's all don't
[1:43:47] walk in the light of another age
[1:43:49] God gave us all the light we need you
[1:43:54] reveal all the mysteries there's not
[1:43:56] somebody to come no God is perfect and
[1:44:01] his word will never fail Webster says
[1:44:05] the glare is a false light like a mirage
[1:44:09] and that's what the devil is doing today
[1:44:11] showing people a mirage a Council of
[1:44:13] Churches over a group of denominations
[1:44:15] which will turn out to be false because
[1:44:18] there is a real light shining presence
[1:44:24] sister there is a real light shining
[1:44:29] that's why we can rejoice and adore
[1:44:34] Jesus our Lord and Savior a few more
[1:44:41] minutes is that ok now we know if it
[1:44:48] were possible
[1:44:50] Satan would deceive the very elect but
[1:44:55] if it were possible and it ain't boo
[1:44:58] devil
[1:45:00] as long as you fortified under the word
[1:45:03] as long as you are in Christ you
[1:45:06] fortified and you can say boo devil
[1:45:11] now listen but there will come false
[1:45:16] anointed ones hey that's a Bible
[1:45:18] oh brother David you know why did Lord
[1:45:22] allow this to show his glory like we saw
[1:45:25] in the beginning why did sin come to
[1:45:28] show that he's a savior
[1:45:29] why did sickness come to show that he's
[1:45:31] a healer amen he's still the same there
[1:45:37] will be false anointed ones and they'll
[1:45:39] call themself prophets mm-hmm but you
[1:45:44] will recognize them by the word no
[1:45:49] matter what they do they might heal the
[1:45:51] sick they might open the eyes of the
[1:45:53] blind and deny the word get away from it
[1:45:59] yeah but you know brother David I love
[1:46:02] that brother I read you know we have
[1:46:03] such a good relationship get away from
[1:46:06] it when they denied a word you stay away
[1:46:15] from it don't care what it is stay with
[1:46:18] the word regardless what it says what is
[1:46:22] the bride the royal seed the elect of
[1:46:25] God we were in his mind in his thoughts
[1:46:28] and now in very plain language you know
[1:46:32] that language the true Bride of Christ
[1:46:34] was in the mind of God eternally though
[1:46:38] not expressed until each one came at its
[1:46:42] time before you were born we dedicated
[1:46:45] baby I don't know how many days he had
[1:46:46] but before he even was born God knew all
[1:46:50] about him so no matter how old you are
[1:46:55] God still knows everything about you
[1:46:59] and we forget that we forget how mighty
[1:47:03] our God is and each member came forth
[1:47:09] and became expressed and took its place
[1:47:10] in the body thus this bride is we're
[1:47:14] speaking about the spoken word let there
[1:47:16] be and there is now this bride is the
[1:47:19] literal spoken word seed bride it's very
[1:47:24] apparent that she ought to be called
[1:47:26] that for she was predestinated in him
[1:47:29] listen now came from the same source
[1:47:36] that makes something special out of you
[1:47:38] brothers something special out of you
[1:47:40] all came from the same source was
[1:47:43] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:47:46] God in many man bird body whereas once
[1:47:49] God was manifest in one member even our
[1:47:52] Lord Jesus how do you feel bride happy
[1:47:57] Christmas how thankful we can be God
[1:48:04] gave us an absolute what's the absolute
[1:48:09] the Word of God not my church not this
[1:48:15] church not this preacher not no no no no
[1:48:19] there's one absolute it's God himself
[1:48:27] now he said let there be light and there
[1:48:32] is brother Branham says in the greatest
[1:48:34] battle ever for the only thing that he's
[1:48:37] waiting for now is for his army to get
[1:48:41] their position
[1:48:43] come on now army of the Living God

[1:49:03] sacrifice so that he could go and take
[1:49:06] the book and open a Caesar of and reveal
[1:49:08] you know the mysteries he's waiting when
[1:49:15] his army to get their position like the
[1:49:17] Stars the first Bible hallelujah their
[1:49:21] position let's take our position like
[1:49:24] the stars of heavens amen now we don't
[1:49:28] want to be wandering stars wonder if
[1:49:32] this is right wonder if that is right
[1:49:34] wonder if this will happen wonder if it
[1:49:36] could be don't wander stay like those
[1:49:39] stars of heaven as a real soldier as is
[1:49:44] post of duty stand there believing lorry
[1:49:53] be to God
[1:49:55] son they're believing come on bride

[1:50:07] daughter of God he said let there be and
[1:50:11] there is let's not put it on tomorrow or
[1:50:16] the next week or next year or I don't
[1:50:18] know when now stand and believe only
[1:50:26] believe all things are possible he says
[1:50:28] oh and there will be light in the
[1:50:30] evening time that's God who says there
[1:50:34] will be light in the evening time and
[1:50:36] let me tell you we're in the evening
[1:50:38] time there's not much time left we can
[1:50:41] see the signs all around us but rise and
[1:50:44] shine
[1:50:45] in the evening time there will be lights
[1:50:48] that's when come Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:50:51] Jesus comes down and set himself at the
[1:50:55] head of the church
[1:50:57] what a glorious time we're living in and
[1:51:01] he will resurrect his church being his
[1:51:05] own body and that's what is going on
[1:51:09] right now all over the world the Spirit
[1:51:15] is moving and all over the world there's
[1:51:18] an invisible union of the bride going on
[1:51:20] with a groom hey man David those songs I
[1:51:25] don't know don't worry they come by
[1:51:28] inspiration many will just continue and
[1:51:34] the bride will be gone already because
[1:51:39] they are not reflecting the light of the
[1:51:41] som didn't Jesus say in Saint John 15 I
[1:51:48] am the vine you are the branches and he
[1:51:50] gives an example the Prophet about an
[1:51:51] orange aiming and then he says if the
[1:51:54] vine ever puts foot another vine or not
[1:51:56] a branch sorry it'll be of the same live
[1:51:58] that's in it it'll bear an orange amen
[1:52:02] because at the beginning in the root
[1:52:05] it's an orange tree life he spoke the
[1:52:09] word let there be light and there is
[1:52:15] light Isaiah 60 verse 1 says arise stand
[1:52:21] stand like the stars in heaven arise
[1:52:25] shine for thy light is come and the
[1:52:29] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for
[1:52:33] behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:52:36] earth hey Manny can cover the earth and
[1:52:39] gross darkness the people but the Lord
[1:52:42] shall arise upon thee and his glory
[1:52:46] shall be seen upon thee
[1:52:50] is that your desire is that your desire
[1:52:54] then I have to decrease after this
[1:52:58] disappear I have this I have that know
[1:53:04] of nothing Here I am Lord but I gave
[1:53:11] myself away I give it all to you Lord
[1:53:16] that's a real Christmas brothers and
[1:53:18] sisters God will shine for his light
[1:53:20] he's doing it just for the coming of the
[1:53:22] Lord and it's not a man man is out of it
[1:53:25] it's God God does it because he promised
[1:53:29] it the Word of God will never return a
[1:53:36] void never forget it if we never see
[1:53:40] each other again we will see on the
[1:53:42] other side but the Word of God can never
[1:53:46] fail just like the word in the beginning
[1:53:55] I'm wrapping up now it was spoken in the
[1:53:58] Garden of Eden spoken word and the
[1:53:59] second time it was made flesh and dwelt
[1:54:00] among us and the third time it became
[1:54:03] part of us when the Holy Ghost is
[1:54:06] dwelling in us God coming into the man
[1:54:09] he spoke first the word the enemy tore
[1:54:12] it down then the word was made flesh and
[1:54:14] he was crucified but now there's a
[1:54:17] difference in the word the word has
[1:54:21] become the church and the church is the
[1:54:23] word you want to know the secret I know
[1:54:27] you've quoted many times the secret is
[1:54:29] the word is in the bride she's a spoken
[1:54:33] word seed bride the word is in the bride
[1:54:36] now just ripen under the light of the
[1:54:39] sol so that this seed all can produce
[1:54:43] and you know what it will produce
[1:54:51] nothing but the original huh huh you
[1:54:58] come from the same source how do you
[1:55:05] know it's God because he's taking the
