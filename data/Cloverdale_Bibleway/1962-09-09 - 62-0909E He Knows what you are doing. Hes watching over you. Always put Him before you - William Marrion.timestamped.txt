[0:00] Psalms
[0:02] 168 David said I have set the Lord
[0:05] before me that's a good thing to do
[0:09] Psalm 168 I set the Lord before me so he
[0:13] could not be confused about it uh he
[0:18] wanted to be conscious of his presence
[0:21] so David said I have set the lord always
[0:24] before my
[0:25] face now I David have set the Lord Lord
[0:30] before my face always to be conscience
[0:34] conscious of God's presence wouldn't
