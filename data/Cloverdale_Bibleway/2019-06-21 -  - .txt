TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and hearing all the sounds of the atmosphere and even in worship and they be able to to hear these things and that's why it's incredibly blessed to be able to hear I'm gonna do something a little unorthodox and have a little video clip and I pray the intent of it comes across and then we'll we'll go forward the service but just a couple minutes long well pray yeah we'll just play that way and you just let me know if everything sounds oh okay five four three two one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's have a wine is for high okay everything's gonna sound a little strange alright so let's have a LAN you say hi [Music] happy for you so it's gonna take some time to have a little bit more alright how does it sound now good is it sounding better can you hear my voice down yeah can you hear my voice yes [Laughter] [Music] [Music] I'm technically your device is on here you can put it down for a second just used to say only can you hear me and you hear your voice hearing for the first time hey I've watched it many times and it's hard to watch that' without breaking down a little bit because it's such a touching moment when someone is actually heard for the very first time i want you now to still hold that naturally and let's just swing that over on a spiritual side how much more incredible it is when someone can hear spiritually for the very first time amen let's just hold that thought as we go through this service because here the science has gone through so much to try and implant and put different instruments in the inside the skull and connect different things to conduct the nerd day electricity to the brain man has gone through much work and cost one on their cost $30,000 for one year but they felt but their family members helped and pitched in to certain things to do that because it was so important to them just for the natural hearing all the labor is just now imagine just for the 10,000 world value of his soul that goes in so that someone can start to spiritually hear God coming through tech Kenny here uh-huh again again I can hear in the elation in the person's face of actually hearing sound you know what's actually just fuzzy for the first time as this started takes time to hear so don't don't be sometimes it takes a little time for somebody start hearing God's voice because it's kind of way out there maybe and it's trying to penetrate through everything amen the power of you
