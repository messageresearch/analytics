[2:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, you're all we need

[2:29] Jesus. We want to give you glory, Lord.

[3:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. Ask your brother
[3:04] David to burn up, Brother Dave to come
[3:06] and open the service in a word of
[3:07] prayer.
[3:09] We've got a number of prayer requests
[3:11] here this morning. And uh we're not
[3:14] going to read them all. We're just going
[3:15] to have our brother Dave lay hands on
[3:18] them. Uh we do have a sis a testimony
[3:20] from sister Patty Pettigill. I believe
[3:24] uh just wants to thank the Lord for
[3:25] their her prayers on her behalf. She was
[3:28] supposed to take uh 6 to 8 weeks to
[3:31] recover from a broken rib, a cracked
[3:33] rib, and uh she's fine now. And she's
[3:36] just thanking the Lord for that. So we
[3:38] want to take these requests before the
[3:40] Lord. Amen. If you've got a need this
[3:42] morning, just look before the Lord as we
[3:43] go to prayer. If you're listening in on
[3:45] the internet, you just lift any request
[3:48] you have. The Lord sees every need even
[3:50] before we ask. Amen, brother David.
[3:53] [Music]
[3:55] Let's bow our heads.
[3:58] Our precious Lord Jesus, it's been so
[4:00] wonderful to be here this morning just
[4:03] lifting our voices to give our Lord and
[4:06] Savior praise and glory. Lord,
[4:09] &gt;&gt; just so wonderful have that great
[4:11] release inside, Lord, to just be able to
[4:12] lift up our voice and give you glory and
[4:15] praise, Lord Jesus.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; We declare that you are worthy this
[4:19] morning, Lord. There is none other
[4:20] worthy, Lord.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; We want the fruit of our lips to give
[4:23] you glory this morning, Lord Jesus.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; The great things you've done for us,
[4:28] Lord.
[4:30] Just thinking of the songs we're
[4:31] singing, Lord. When we thinking how the
[4:34] things of life are so empty and vain,
[4:36] Father, when we get to the other side,
[4:38] all that's going to matter, Lord, is
[4:39] Jesus.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, our natural accomplishments, our
[4:43] jobs, our our material possessions,
[4:46] nothing will mean anything on that day
[4:48] when we finally cross over. Lord, help
[4:51] us to keep it all in perspective.
[4:53] Father, this life is but a vapor, Lord,
[4:55] and it's quickly fading, Father.
[4:58] Lord, we thank you to be in your
[5:00] presence. I lay out my hands upon these
[5:02] prayer requests. Those that have penned
[5:05] them down, Lord, they've had faith,
[5:08] Lord, that the prayers of the saints
[5:11] availth much. Lord, we just stand
[5:14] agreeing for every need that my hands
[5:16] are laid upon this morning. We agree
[5:18] with those that have pinned them down.
[5:20] We agree with those that the need is
[5:22] for. Lord,
[5:24] &gt;&gt; we confess that by your stripes, we're
[5:25] healed.
[5:27] We pro confess that you're an
[5:29] everpresent help in a time of trouble.
[5:31] You provide naturally, financially,
[5:35] emotionally. Lord, every need.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; What what we lack, the pillar of fire
[5:40] has, Lord Jesus.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to commit this day to
[5:45] you as the preparations for the camp. We
[5:47] do want to pray for your servant this
[5:49] morning that you'll give him the mind of
[5:51] Christ. Give us ears to hear what the
[5:53] spirit is wanting to say unto the
[5:55] church, Lord.
[5:57] We commit this day, this service, pray
[5:59] you'll have a preeminence, Father. And
[6:01] we pray for our brother Ron Spencer.
[6:03] Just praying that you'll just touch his
[6:05] body, Lord. We know he's having a need
[6:07] in his body from this accident still.
[6:10] Just pray give him stamina. Give him
[6:13] give him wind in his lungs, Lord. Give
[6:16] him let him be able to preach his 2hour
[6:19] service if he needs, Lord. Just give him
[6:21] the energy and the strength and the
[6:23] stamina, Lord. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Prepare every heart for this for this
[6:28] morning and this week. We commit it all
[6:30] to you, Lord, in your most precious name
[6:32] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[6:35] Amen.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seats.

[10:05] Jeremy
[10:18] [Music]
[10:28] I want to present the life of Christ.
[10:34] It's my aim today.
[10:39] For in his image I want to stand
[10:45] so blameless on that day.
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] And though this world may criticize,
[10:56] it will never
[10:58] understand
[11:00] [Music]
[11:02] that I can't rest until I be a perfect
[11:09] man.
[11:15] What are you going to present to the
[11:19] Lord at the end
[11:22] of your journey?
[11:26] He's not going to be touched by anything
[11:30] save his
[11:33] testimony.
[11:36] What are you going to present to the
[11:40] Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry.
[11:47] Don't be found in that position
[11:52] where you
[11:55] will be wondering why.
[11:58] [Music]
[12:02] Though this world may offer its pleasure
[12:06] and peace and luxurious
[12:09] life of ease,
[12:13] but it simply cannot continue on
[12:18] for lands just like a breeze.
[12:23] A moment here and a moment gone. Like a
[12:29] flower they fade away.
[12:34] Oh, but I just want to stay right on to
[12:40] that perfect day.
[12:43] [Music]
[12:57] Take rest my soul in no other arms. Save
[13:03] Jesus
[13:04] on today.
[13:07] For he has opened my eyes to see that
[13:13] judgement is on its way.
[13:18] And though 10,000 fall at my side, I
[13:23] will never be tossed aside.
[13:27] [Music]
[13:29] For in the shadow of that mighty rock is
[13:34] where I'll abide.
[13:38] [Music]
[13:40] Oh, what are you going to present to the
[13:44] Lord at the end
[13:47] of your journey?
[13:51] He's not going to be touched by anything
[13:55] save his
[13:58] testimony.
[14:00] Oh, what are you going to present to the
[14:04] Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry.
[14:11] Don't be found in that position
[14:16] where you
[14:20] will be wondering why.
[14:26] Lord, take thy word, thy precious word,
[14:31] and anoint it to my soul.
[14:37] Perfect what is lacking in my faith, and
[14:42] make thy servant whole.
[14:47] Drive all fears and all doubts away. For
[14:52] I just want to hear you say,
[14:56] "Receive, receive thy crown, my beloved
[15:02] son. You have overcome.
[15:06] [Applause]
[15:08] Well done.
[15:13] [Music]
[15:14] For what are you going to present to the
[15:18] Lord at the end
[15:21] of your journey?
[15:25] He's not going to be touched by anything
[15:29] save his
[15:31] testimony.
[15:34] Oh, what are you going to present to the
[15:38] Lord? And I hope it makes you sigh
[15:43] and cry.
[15:45] Don't be found in that position
[15:50] where you
[15:53] will be wondering why.
[15:57] [Music]
[16:00] Don't be found in that position
[16:05] where you
[16:08] [Music]
[16:11] will be wondering why.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:21] [Applause]
[16:26] Thank you, brother Jeremy.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; All that really matters is serving him.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning the word now.
[16:35] I think there's a baby dedication as
[16:36] well. Just as brother Ed comes, let's
[16:38] sing. Open my eyes that I may see
[16:41] glimpses of truth.

[18:02] [Applause]
[18:04] his
[18:07] and the
[18:09] [Music]

[19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Speak to me, Lord.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Open our hearts. That's why we're here.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to see you all. And we're so
[19:38] grateful for the for the touch of God
[19:41] upon our souls.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Those of you that are sitting in the
[19:44] foyer, I trust you'll be able to remain
[19:46] focused. We're sorry we don't have the
[19:49] uh the live streaming to the fellowship
[19:53] room today because so much of the
[19:55] equipment our equipment has gone uh to
[19:59] to the camp for the meetings. And uh
[20:03] we're looking forward to a great time
[20:05] this week. Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Before we uh go any further,
[20:10] we I have a baby dedication this morning
[20:13] and we're going to dedicate the child of
[20:17] our brother Randy and sister Sharon
[20:19] Timberlins. Why don't we just sing a
[20:24] verse of a chorus bring them in or Jesus
[20:26] loves the little children.
[20:29] He does love them. Amen.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; He had time to he took time and sometime
[20:35] you know in the message or I listen to
[20:37] some of the messages you have brother
[20:40] Brandon will take so much time
[20:42] &gt;&gt; yes
[20:43] &gt;&gt; dedicating the children
[20:46] &gt;&gt; and I maybe you've had it too we've
[20:48] thought
[20:50] hope he gets over this because I want to
[20:52] get to the message part this was
[20:55] important and so we're really happy to
[20:58] have uh brother Randy
[21:01] school principal,
[21:03] his good wife, and his family.
[21:06] Increasing family, three daughters. You
[21:10] know what that means?
[21:14] [Music]
[21:17] I I I I don't want to make a doctrine
[21:19] out of it, but I've said it so many
[21:20] times that it proves we have a we have a
[21:24] man. And I tell you what, tell you one
[21:26] one thing, brother Randy, from a from a
[21:29] brother who's have three and not only
[21:32] three, but a wife that makes four.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; It shows that God intends the man to
[21:39] learn patience.
[21:43] [Music]
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus love. Can we sing that?
[21:52] Jesus loves the children
[22:00] of the world.
[22:08] [Music]
[22:12] Oh,
[22:14] Jesus loves the little children.
[22:19] All the children of the world,
[22:23] [Applause]
[22:25] black and white, they are precious in
[22:28] his sight. Jesus loves the little
[22:31] children of the world.
[22:35] I really felt touched by God when I was
[22:40] just looking to the Lord for this
[22:41] dedication.
[22:43] Brother Randy and sister Sharon have
[22:45] called their child Carara Elise.
[22:49] I think I have that right.
[22:51] And Cara is dear one or beloved one.
[22:56] And Elise is consecrated. And I have
[22:59] found in the Hebrew that is uh my God is
[23:03] a vow.
[23:05] [Music]
[23:06] I thought of Hannah
[23:09] when she brought the child to Eli,
[23:14] brought Samuel, a child. This is a
[23:16] daughter. It's not a son, but it's a
[23:18] daughter.
[23:20] And but they have there's one thing in
[23:23] common between Hannah
[23:25] and Sister Sharon and brother Randy. And
[23:28] this was her statement to Eli.
[23:32] For this child I prayed.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And I know that that was so in your
[23:40] case. For this child I prayed.
[23:44] And she says, "And the Lord hath given
[23:46] me my petition which I have asked of
[23:49] him." And I was thinking of that
[23:54] and I'd like to convey to the
[23:55] congregation.
[23:57] God heard that prayer and God has heard
[24:00] your prayer. And God gave a child that
[24:05] matched the prayer.
[24:10] Uh I I thought of uh Samuel. God alone
[24:15] is able to determine
[24:18] who and how many needed that child
[24:22] Samuel. David needed him.
[24:26] Saul needed him.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Israel needed him
[24:30] &gt;&gt; and God needed him.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; And I can say about this child,
[24:36] you prayed for this child. God has
[24:38] answered your prayer. As parents, you
[24:41] needed this child.
[24:45] She's going to contribute something to
[24:46] the family.
[24:49] The siblings, her sisters needed this
[24:52] child.
[24:54] And if the Lord Jesus carries and time
[24:56] goes on, she's going to sit with some
[24:58] other young people and they're going to
[25:00] need this child. That's what I'm going
[25:02] to pray for today. that she would live
[25:05] that kind of a life
[25:08] and perhaps
[25:09] in God's extra measure of grace that God
[25:13] may give her a voice like her mom. She's
[25:16] using it now. It's getting practiced.
[25:20] Maybe she'll have a voice like her
[25:22] mother and move someone and the Holy
[25:25] Spirit
[25:27] could use her
[25:30] &gt;&gt; and someone's burdens will be lifted
[25:33] &gt;&gt; as she would sing.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; And somebody in the body of Christ will
[25:37] need a child.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; And we know not who needs a child. But I
[25:42] can tell you something else about this
[25:44] child. There's angels of God around the
[25:46] child.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon really taught us.
[25:49] Yes,
[25:50] &gt;&gt; that we need to be careful how we raise
[25:53] our children
[25:54] &gt;&gt; because the angels of God are around
[25:56] them. And that's for all of us that are
[25:59] parents today.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; We need to care for our children as
[26:04] gifts from God. And so I'm going to pray
[26:09] for this child for one more reason.
[26:12] Jesus Christ
[26:15] needs her.
[26:18] And that we know nothing about right
[26:20] now. But Jesus Christ needs her. Needs
[26:22] her for a vessel. Needs her to express
[26:25] something
[26:27] that is given her part. That's her part
[26:30] to express. And I'm going to dedicate
[26:32] her to that cause. Cara Elise. Amen.
[26:45] She doesn't need too many vitamins.
[26:49] May God prosper her soul the same way.
[26:52] Heavenly Father, we pray for this child,
[26:56] Cara Elise.
[26:58] And in the name of Jesus Christ,
[27:02] may the Holy Spirit rest upon her. May
[27:06] she be an instrument, Father, as we are
[27:10] dedicating her to you and giving her to
[27:12] you and her parents, Sister Sharon and
[27:15] Brother Randy standing here, Lord. I
[27:18] pray, oh God, that you'll watch over
[27:20] her. Keep her from the ways of sin. Keep
[27:23] her from the ways of unbelief. Lord,
[27:25] keep her from the bombs and the snares,
[27:28] I pray, and the temptations. Keep her, I
[27:31] pray, Lord, keep her in good health.
[27:33] Watch over her. I now dedicate Carara
[27:37] Elise
[27:38] to you to your service to make her
[27:42] blessing in the home in the name of
[27:44] Jesus Christ.
[27:46] May the Holy Spirit rest upon her. Amen.
[27:54] God bless you, brother Randy. God bless
[27:57] you. Amen. God bless you, Sister Sharon.
[28:01] Amen. God bless you.
[28:05] Hallelujah.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Our brother Mike Cosalino had received a
[28:13] letter from his son who
[28:16] those of you in the congregation know
[28:17] the difficulties that he encountered
[28:20] and uh how God has dealt with him in his
[28:25] in his condition.
[28:27] He's in prison in Japan and he has
[28:32] written and he said this just in part, I
[28:36] know if I had not been back I know if I
[28:39] had been back home I wouldn't have been
[28:42] so close to God or gotten to know the
[28:45] message of our prophet. To be honest, I
[28:48] never took Malachi 45 and 6 serious
[28:51] until God allowed me to be in this
[28:54] situation. and today humbled me. He went
[28:58] on to say, I thank Jesus because through
[29:01] this I am no longer a slave and have a
[29:06] new master which is our Lord and Savior
[29:09] Jesus Christ. And brother uh brother
[29:12] Mike has been providing his son with
[29:15] message books. and he said that there's
[29:16] another man there and they are uh being
[29:21] blessed by the message books together
[29:23] and by the letters that are being sent.
[29:25] So sometimes God has to bring a great
[29:29] difficulty to a person before they come
[29:32] to realization what life is all about,
[29:35] &gt;&gt; what the real issues of life is about.
[29:37] this last week and I'm able to speak uh
[29:41] somewhat more freely this morning
[29:43] because we're not streaming live
[29:45] streaming. If we were live streaming, I
[29:47] wouldn't be able to say what I'm going
[29:49] to say in the next few minutes. But this
[29:51] last week, I don't know what kind of
[29:53] week you had, but some of our some of
[29:57] our brothers and sisters just like a
[30:01] sister just like any sister here and a
[30:04] brother like any brother here only he's
[30:06] a minister
[30:08] on July 31st at 11:00 in the morning. We
[30:13] got an email. Brother Murphy did. And uh
[30:17] brother, I won't give his name or the
[30:20] province, but he was taken away by the
[30:22] police. He was arrested
[30:24] yesterday
[30:26] uh when they were having a service at
[30:28] his home. And his wife called another
[30:33] brother in the south of China and asked
[30:36] us to pray for him.
[30:39] uh they said that he used to be one of
[30:41] the leaders of a three self church and
[30:45] as you know the three self church is is
[30:48] a recognized church in China and it's
[30:50] it's recognized by the government and so
[30:53] they don't have any difficulty but he
[30:56] used to be a leader of in that group and
[30:58] 3 years ago he came he came out of it
[31:02] which really upset the authorities and
[31:05] he's been constantly visited by the
[31:08] three self leaders and they've tried
[31:10] intimidation
[31:12] and even bribery wanting him to come
[31:15] back but he never moved and this is the
[31:19] first time that he was taken away by the
[31:21] police that was July 31st July 31st at
[31:26] 3:23
[31:28] in the afternoon
[31:30] we have another news a few minutes ago
[31:34] and a sister in their church was taken
[31:38] away. This is another church was taken
[31:40] away by the police. They interrogated
[31:43] her then searched her house and found
[31:46] all the messages that they had just
[31:48] printed uh with their printer and their
[31:51] CDs and they took all the materials back
[31:55] to the police station and the further
[31:58] action is not clear. This is the place
[32:01] that the two old brothers were detained
[32:04] for 10 days last time.
[32:08] Then on August the 1st, the next day, we
[32:12] received another communication
[32:16] and the first brother who was taken away
[32:18] by the police was released this morning.
[32:22] He was having a meeting in another
[32:24] village when the police came uh and took
[32:28] took him away together with the message
[32:30] books that he carried. That's that's
[32:33] when he was taken away. But they asked
[32:36] him
[32:37] uh to either pay a,000 R&B which is
[32:40] their money fine or be locked up for 15
[32:44] days in detention center which is
[32:47] prison. And uh they told him that he
[32:50] could go home. Basically they they felt
[32:55] assured that he would go home and get
[32:56] the money. And the second day, the
[32:59] police came to his home and asked him if
[33:03] he made up his mind what to do. And he
[33:06] said, "I will go with you to the
[33:08] detention center." They were shocked by
[33:11] what they considered this insensible
[33:14] answer. Because they felt that the fine
[33:16] was really quite sensible, quite
[33:19] reasonable. And then the brother
[33:21] answered, "This is not a matter of
[33:23] money." And actually his son-in-law,
[33:27] this pastor's son-in-law,
[33:29] brought the money so he could pay the
[33:31] fine, but he refused. And they brought
[33:35] the money, but he refused to take it.
[33:37] And he said he would rather go to jail
[33:39] for the sake of the word of God because
[33:42] he had not done anything wrong. Then the
[33:45] police took him back to the police
[33:47] station.
[33:49] When he was there, they had a very
[33:50] lengthy conversation
[33:52] and they commanded him to write a
[33:55] guarantee
[33:57] not to believe this man called William
[33:59] Brandham anymore.
[34:01] So the police know what they're doing.
[34:05] He said, "I never did believe him. I
[34:07] believed the message that God sent him
[34:09] to bring to me."
[34:11] &gt;&gt; I thought that was a wise answer.
[34:14] Then they said, "Why have you why you
[34:18] have all of the books, all of his books,
[34:22] if you don't believe him?" He asked
[34:24] them, "Do you think it's abnormal for a
[34:28] preacher to have some spiritual
[34:29] materials? Who doesn't?" And they
[34:32] couldn't answer. And then they warned
[34:34] him not to go to any other places to
[34:37] have meetings in the future, but only at
[34:40] home. Praise the Lord.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that sounding like the book of
[34:44] Acts?
[34:53] Brother Murphy adds, "Let's keep praying
[34:56] for our brother and the saints."
[34:59] Uh he said, "The situation is still not
[35:02] clear. The sister has not been released
[35:05] as far as we know. But we know one
[35:08] thing. When God's children standing on
[35:11] his word, then the Lord is obligated to
[35:14] come on the scene in the right time as
[35:17] he did to the Hebrew children. Brother
[35:20] Murphy, these are his words. The Lord
[35:22] never put the fire out but only took the
[35:25] heat out of it.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; The Lord never killed the lions but only
[35:29] closed their mouths. Praise be to his
[35:31] name.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, we're thankful for
[35:36] that. These are we're not dwelling on
[35:38] history. We're telling you what happened
[35:40] since you sat here last Sunday.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you it's a supernatural
[35:44] gospel.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; We believe in it and we're glad we're
[35:48] part of it. We're glad we're in contact
[35:50] with these people almost on a daily
[35:53] basis.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; We're glad for the message that has gone
[35:56] into China and many, many different
[36:00] places. We'll never forget the work that
[36:03] our brother John Lei here in the church,
[36:06] brother John Sacker, and incidentally,
[36:09] brother John Sacker and brother Ivan
[36:12] who's with us from here are both over
[36:15] there right now. And so just an added
[36:18] note, we need to really pray for them.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; We need to pray for them. You're never
[36:24] out of danger when you're carrying this
[36:26] gospel and this word. And you can you
[36:30] can hear from this. They know what it's
[36:32] all about. I tell you what, the police
[36:36] in China have got a lot of message
[36:38] books.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; I think they took about 150 from us when
[36:42] we were there. So, we're thankful for
[36:46] that.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Let them have them.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; We print all the message books the
[36:51] police want.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Well, this week is coming up is a a
[36:59] milestone week for us. And just allow me
[37:02] an extra few minutes before we turn to
[37:04] the word.
[37:06] It's a milestone.
[37:08] It's the first time we've wrenched and
[37:12] wrestled with a place to gather and have
[37:15] a kind of family camp meeting. Our
[37:17] brother Ron Spencer will be arriving on
[37:20] Tuesday.
[37:21] And uh I just want to
[37:24] uh thank you for your prayers, but I
[37:27] want to ask you please for your
[37:29] continued prayers. We don't want just uh
[37:33] a gathering of people. We don't want
[37:37] just an emotional high. We want a
[37:40] supernatural experience.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; We want to see
[37:44] uh men and women, boys and girls, young
[37:47] people that need deliverance. We want to
[37:50] see them delivered. Right.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; We want to see the healing. If homes
[37:55] need healing, may homes be healed. If
[37:58] bodies need healing, may bodies be
[38:00] healed. May the supernatural and I know
[38:03] looking down into your faces today
[38:05] throughout this congregation.
[38:08] There's a there is needs. There's
[38:10] burdens on your heart. And I pray that
[38:13] God will minister to those. I'm praying
[38:16] that God will give words and direct his
[38:19] thoughts to brother Ron. Even I've been
[38:23] praying that this last week. Give him
[38:25] your thoughts. Channel him right in the
[38:28] direction that you want us to have for
[38:31] this time. And I said to you, I think
[38:33] last week, I believe that it is a
[38:35] supernatural thing that God preserved
[38:38] his life. What all
[38:41] he's called on to do, I do not know. But
[38:43] I know one thing. I believe that he was
[38:46] preserved also for these meetings.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; I believe that. And let's pray for those
[38:51] that need to baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:54] that they will receive that. I mean, I'm
[38:57] talking about a transformed life.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm not talking about some
[39:01] emotional experience. I'm talking about
[39:02] a transformed life. And from that day
[39:05] on, they're changed.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? From that day on, they
[39:09] can say, "From that time, it was all
[39:11] different."
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:13] I want to thank this congregation. So so
[39:17] many of you have worked so hard to make
[39:21] it possible and we are we are very very
[39:25] humbled by it and deeply appreciate it.
[39:27] Others have opened their homes for
[39:30] friends and family and some of visitors
[39:32] and brother Ron and his family to stay
[39:35] and I really appreciate that. I just
[39:37] wish I could thank you the way I would
[39:40] like to thank you.
[39:42] So, I say let's keep our minds on God
[39:44] this week and see what God has in store
[39:47] for us. I believe it'll be a
[39:49] supernatural time. I really do.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; When you come to the grounds, you'll you
[39:56] we were there just quickly for a couple
[39:58] of hours yesterday and so many things.
[40:02] is just a different place, a different
[40:03] atmosphere.
[40:05] And uh so we're we're we're just in in
[40:09] expectation and I trust you will come
[40:11] that way. Those of you from the this
[40:14] side of the border now going the other
[40:16] side let you know that you should
[40:18] probably go down early, very early to
[40:21] beat the crowd. Uh one group of our
[40:25] young people was 4 hours yesterday
[40:28] getting across the border. 4 hours. And
[40:31] uh so if you haven't got Nexus, you and
[40:33] you hit it at the wrong time, you're
[40:35] going to be there quite a long time. It'
[40:37] be good to listen to the radio or or
[40:39] find out ahead of time which crossing
[40:42] might be the best one. Let's stand,
[40:45] shall we? And I'd like to just say,
[40:47] "Have thy own way, Lord. Have thy own
[40:49] way, brother.
[40:52] Have thy own way." How many of you can
[40:54] join me in that in one spirit? Have thy
[40:57] own way, Lord. Have thy way, you young
[41:01] people. Are you with me on that? Have
[41:03] your own way, Lord.
[41:05] Not my will, but thine be done. Have
[41:08] they
[41:10] have
[41:26] Heat.
[41:30] [Music]
[41:36] Heat.
[41:50] [Music]
[41:52] [Applause]
[41:58] He lives.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[42:06] Our loving Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[42:10] We're so thankful and happy today that
[42:13] we have that name that's been given to
[42:15] us.
[42:17] First spoken on the lips of an angel.
[42:20] Thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he
[42:23] shall save his people from their sins.
[42:26] And here we stand today redeemed.
[42:29] Redeemed by that one. Oh, we're so
[42:33] appreciative this morning, Lord, for
[42:35] what you have done. I pray that you'll
[42:37] move throughout this audience, oh God.
[42:40] Move, we pray, upon every heart. The
[42:43] needs that are here, I pray, Lord, that
[42:46] the Holy Spirit will conquer the need. I
[42:49] pray, oh God, you'll move every heart.
[42:52] Move us into an expectation.
[42:55] Move us into a yieldedness, Lord. Move
[42:58] us into a contact one on one. Each
[43:01] individual person in touch with the
[43:03] almighty God. Father, I pray that you
[43:06] will to take and direct us, Lord. Anoint
[43:10] your word in our into our hearts. I
[43:12] pray, Lord, you will just cause me to
[43:15] say what needs to be said this morning.
[43:18] And may this word, oh God, be something
[43:21] that will establish and build the hearts
[43:24] of the people. I pray, Father, that you
[43:27] will bring a release of the Holy Spirit
[43:30] upon us, oh God. Pray you'll take away
[43:33] the formality. Father, take away the
[43:35] fear of of one another or the whatever
[43:39] it may be that would restrict or hinder.
[43:41] I pray that we will be a yielded people,
[43:44] Lord. Yielded to the Holy Spirit. We're
[43:47] joining in prayer now and we're asking
[43:50] that this shall be done in the name of
[43:53] Jesus Christ and for his glory alone.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to take your
[44:00] Bibles if you would please.
[44:03] We'll turn to the book of Revelation,
[44:05] the 20th chapter.
[44:08] We're going to begin reading at the 11th
[44:10] verse.
[44:26] And I saw a great white throne,
[44:29] and him that sat on it,
[44:32] from whose face the earth and the heaven
[44:35] fled away, and there was found no place
[44:38] for them. And I saw the dead, small and
[44:41] great, stand before God, and the books
[44:44] were opened. And another book was
[44:47] opened, which is the book of life. And
[44:49] the dead which and the dead were judged
[44:52] out of those things which were written
[44:55] in the books according to their works.
[44:59] And the sea gave up the dead which were
[45:01] in it. And death and hell delivered up
[45:04] the dead which were in them. And they
[45:07] were judged every man according to their
[45:09] works. And death and hell were cast into
[45:12] the lake of fire. This is the second
[45:15] death. And whosoever was not found
[45:18] written in the book of life was cast
[45:21] into the lake of fire. On into chapter
[45:24] 21. And I saw a new heaven and a new
[45:28] earth. For the first heaven and the
[45:30] first earth were passed away, and there
[45:34] was no more sea. And I, John, saw the
[45:37] holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down
[45:39] from God, out of heaven, prepared as a
[45:42] bride adorned for her husband. And I
[45:45] heard a great voice out of heaven,
[45:47] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[45:50] is with men, and he will dwell with
[45:52] them, and they shall be his people, and
[45:55] God himself shall be his and and God
[45:58] himself shall be with them, and be their
[46:01] God. And God shall wipe away all tears
[46:04] from their eyes. And there shall be no
[46:07] more death, neither sorrow nor crying,
[46:10] neither shall there be any more pain,
[46:13] for the former things are passed away.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And the people could say amen to that.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats and
[46:20] stay real attentive now with as little
[46:23] movement as possible. I would appreciate
[46:26] as we approach this word I want to speak
[46:29] on a subject that maybe you have given a
[46:34] good deal of thought about
[46:36] uh as you've read the various messages
[46:39] and seen in the in the word as we've
[46:41] read this morning. I want to speak on
[46:45] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[46:48] life
[46:50] uh in the context of deity and humanity.
[46:57] So the book of life and the lamb's book
[46:59] of life.
[47:01] And in order to set uh set the scene,
[47:05] I'm going to give about three quotes
[47:07] that should uh put all of our thoughts
[47:11] in in in one channel. In the invisible
[47:15] union of the bride,
[47:18] brother Brandham said, excuse me, here
[47:21] it brings into view the two books
[47:25] that that's going to be mysterious to
[47:28] you when you read the book of the seven
[47:30] church ages.
[47:32] The two books, book of life, one says
[47:36] you can put your name on it and it never
[47:39] comes off.
[47:41] And the other one says that you take his
[47:43] name out of the book of life. That
[47:46] brings it perfectly in view right there.
[47:50] Then on in another place, invisible
[47:52] union, he said, "Oh my, there is your
[47:56] two books. One of them is the book is
[48:00] the lamb's book of life and your name on
[48:03] there is predestinated on there.
[48:06] It can't go because you can no more take
[48:11] that away than nothing because it was
[48:14] foreord ordained to be on there. But the
[48:17] regular book of life, you can take that
[48:20] off at any time. Then in works is faith
[48:23] expressed.
[48:25] He said when you get the book, he's
[48:27] referring to the church age book. You're
[48:29] going to be you're going to see maybe a
[48:32] little confusion there of what I said.
[48:35] The two books of life, it's the same
[48:39] book,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; but the one of them is your natural
[48:44] birth
[48:45] &gt;&gt; and the other one is your spiritual
[48:47] birth.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; In another place, he said the one runs
[48:50] out into the other.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And then uh he said in another place
[48:56] there's only one book. But so in order
[49:00] for you to follow me in the service this
[49:03] morning, it's as though there's two
[49:05] parts. There is your natural life
[49:09] &gt;&gt; and our deeds are recorded
[49:12] &gt;&gt; and there's our new birth and our
[49:15] spiritual life.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Right? And so uh in in in the overall
[49:20] subject
[49:22] it it actually comprises your natural
[49:25] life and your spiritual life and I
[49:28] believe every part of it. And so uh in
[49:33] order to understand
[49:35] complete justification
[49:37] because in justification
[49:40] uh in justification is to have all. Now
[49:44] listen to listen to this statement real
[49:46] carefully. Justification as brother
[49:48] Brandham taught it is to have all that
[49:52] we acquired through our natural birth
[49:55] that is not of God
[49:58] or not deity
[50:01] erased
[50:02] &gt;&gt; permanently
[50:04] &gt;&gt; irrevocably erased
[50:06] &gt;&gt; from our book and from the record of our
[50:09] life. Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, where's justification?
[50:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; If something's going to filter through
[50:17] &gt;&gt; of our old life,
[50:19] &gt;&gt; where are we?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Where are we standing?
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And that is why he would say when when
[50:26] when sin is confessed,
[50:28] &gt;&gt; it drops into the bleach of the blood of
[50:31] Jesus Christ
[50:33] &gt;&gt; and it breaks up. Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Even the very elements of the ink breaks
[50:37] up
[50:38] &gt;&gt; and can never be found again.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That's when sin is confessed. And that
[50:43] what I say is taking place from between
[50:46] the two books which is really only one
[50:48] book. But you have your natural life,
[50:51] the book of life. And the book of life
[50:53] for the believer
[50:55] &gt;&gt; becomes the lamb's book of life.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; And there is there is no sin in that
[51:02] book. Yes.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So all that the blood washed away from
[51:08] us,
[51:09] all that the blood washed away from us
[51:14] &gt;&gt; can never find its way into the lamb's
[51:17] book of life.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; I thought that would rejoice your
[51:24] &gt;&gt; glory. Hallelujah.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. in the message investments.
[51:31] No, even though I've been preaching just
[51:33] a little bit slower and perhaps a little
[51:35] bit more laborious, don't don't fail to
[51:39] say sickle.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; In the message investments, he said, and
[51:47] I have quite a few quotes just at the
[51:48] first part of the service here. He said,
[51:50] "Notice when this your sins are
[51:54] confessed and your sins are dropped into
[51:57] the bleach of the blood of the son of
[51:59] God, it remits a sin so much that it's
[52:03] put in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[52:06] and can never even be remembered in his
[52:10] sight anymore."
[52:12] &gt;&gt; That's justification.
[52:14] And we need that because I tell you
[52:16] what, you you you know perhaps as well
[52:19] as I do, Satan is relentless
[52:23] &gt;&gt; at trying to bring condemnation.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He's a master at condemnation. But you
[52:28] can hold this up in front of him. Satan,
[52:31] I have a voice that's more powerful.
[52:33] He's called a prophet of God and a voice
[52:36] of God, the word of God, saying, "Thus
[52:38] says the Lord." That sin can never be
[52:42] remembered again.
[52:44] You might carry some scars, whatever. He
[52:46] might point to the scars, might point to
[52:48] the failures. The sin is gone. The sin
[52:52] can never find its way into the lamb's
[52:54] book of life.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And then what that
[53:00] does is make uh that done to make a man
[53:03] a son of God."
[53:05] &gt;&gt; God. God. He said, God puts it in the
[53:08] sea of his forgetfulness, the bleach.
[53:11] The sea of forgetfulness is Christ's
[53:13] blood that was shed for you. And
[53:15] therefore then you and God are father
[53:18] and son by Jesus Christ grace.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Father God and you are father and son
[53:26] &gt;&gt; by the grace of Jesus Christ. Oh, I love
[53:28] that. Not by anything you have done but
[53:31] by the by his grace. You are sons and
[53:34] daughters of God and a partaker of his
[53:37] blessings and of his power and of his
[53:40] life. His life is in you. For you are a
[53:43] son of God. Oh, if the church could if
[53:46] we could only uh would only to represent
[53:50] that. He says if the church could we
[53:53] would only to represent that. Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Now the life uh of every person
[54:01] is recorded in the book of life. The
[54:04] life of every person, every human is
[54:08] recorded in the book of life. And the
[54:10] scriptures which we read describe two
[54:14] classes of people.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Some that are going to stand before
[54:18] judgment, the great white throne
[54:20] judgment, and those that do not stand
[54:23] before judgment.
[54:25] the we're we're judged here.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; We've allowed the word to judge us now.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And in a congregation like this, let me
[54:32] say this as your brother.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here today listening
[54:37] to my voice and the message that God has
[54:40] given me, it would be utter folly. You
[54:44] do yourself the most serious injustice
[54:47] &gt;&gt; if you resisted the opportunity and the
[54:50] offer that God has given. Here's the
[54:52] bleach. Here's the blood. Here's the
[54:56] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[54:58] Emanuel's face. Just confess it.
[55:04] And if you stay and doubt that, there's
[55:06] no hope.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; There's only white throne judgment for
[55:10] you.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; But those that are predestined have been
[55:12] elected with
[55:18] &gt;&gt; and this has been made possible by this
[55:20] scripture. and he came the lamb. When
[55:24] John saw and heard the voice that the
[55:27] lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed
[55:30] to loose the seals and he turned to see
[55:33] the lion and saw a lamb and the lamb
[55:36] didn't just stand there, but the lamb he
[55:39] came.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Beautiful words. He came. There was
[55:44] action. There was motion. There was
[55:46] motivation. There was plan. There was
[55:48] objective. There was motive. He came.
[55:52] and took the book.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's when the book became the lamb's
[55:57] book of life.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And in taking the book, he erased all
[56:03] the sin, every mark, every stain. In
[56:07] that one action when he took the book, I
[56:10] said, "Praise God for the to
[56:15] folks. It was the book that and that
[56:17] book had the record of your life. Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Have the book of all your failures.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. He took my failures.
[56:28] He didn't just take the book. He took my
[56:30] failures. He took my sin. He took those
[56:33] things that would so made me feel so
[56:36] guilty. They're gone.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; He had one action to
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And took it from one and one ran into
[56:47] the other.
[56:50] He said, "All of our deeds in the images
[56:53] of Christ, all of our deeds are recorded
[56:55] on the book of life in works as faith
[56:58] expressed." He said, "But let us have
[57:01] let us have all of our deeds done right
[57:04] because they're in a book, a record
[57:07] that's to be played at the day of
[57:08] judgment." Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Went on to say in that same message,
[57:13] your name
[57:15] of your first nature, this was actually
[57:17] believe in invisible union. Your name of
[57:21] your first nature. You see, your name
[57:23] really expresses who you are.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; It's not just that you're called to
[57:28] something, you know, Mary or Susie or
[57:31] Bill or John or whatever. That's you
[57:34] might say, "Well, that's my name." No,
[57:36] you're that only represents who you are.
[57:39] You are what you live.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; That's what you are.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; You are what you'll be remembered for.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; When you think of Einstein,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; you don't just think of a man. You think
[57:51] of a great scientist.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; You think of someone who was a a a world
[57:58] leader in his field.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; When you when you think say Beetho
[58:04] Beethoven, you think of music. You think
[58:07] of some uh name some artist when you
[58:09] think when you say the name William
[58:11] Marian Brham right away you think of the
[58:14] message. What are you thinking about?
[58:16] You're thinking what is life? You think
[58:17] what way to straightest time doing?
[58:20] [Music]
[58:24] Yes sir.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Your name your of your first nature was
[58:27] born and put in a book of life and all
[58:32] your deeds were wrote in it too.
[58:34] Everything you done under that nature
[58:36] was put in the book called the book of
[58:39] life.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Now he said your old book is gone.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Your old book is gone with your old
[58:46] union.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So you were born united to it.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Said now your old book is gone and your
[58:54] name in your old he said has been
[58:56] transferred.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; He said do you mean to tell me that my
[59:00] old book? He said, "God put it in the
[59:02] sea of his forgetfulness." Your old
[59:04] book.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Your name is now on the new book.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; On the new book, not in the book of
[59:16] life, but in the Lamb's book of life.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; There's a big difference, friends.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the lamb's.
[59:26] He says, "What what the lamb redeemed,
[59:29] not the old book of your natural union,
[59:31] but your new bride." Hallelujah. Glory.
[59:35] Your new life is in the lamb's book of
[59:37] life. Your marriage certificate.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a marriage
[59:43] certificate.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I got one at home. I couldn't probably
[59:46] find it right. Couldn't lay my hands on
[59:48] it right now. But I got another marriage
[59:50] certificate. It's called the lamb's
[59:52] blood.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the one that the lamb took.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, and what what a glorious
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing. What a glorious
[1:00:03] act.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And he rose to their mind by claiming
[1:00:09] them. And in that claiming every sin was
[1:00:13] covered, every dark stain might come. It
[1:00:16] can never never be remembered again.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You got a memory channel, but don't let
[1:00:21] Satan plug something in you. Keep
[1:00:24] yourself clear from that. You tell them
[1:00:26] you have no right to my memory. You have
[1:00:29] no right to my conscience.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; You have no right to darken my
[1:00:33] conscience.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I move you back by the word of God by
[1:00:38] the blood of the lamb.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This channel of your
[1:00:43] conscience and your memory belongs to
[1:00:46] the lamb of God. He bought it.
[1:00:49] He paid for it.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; So I can have thoughts of him and he
[1:00:54] came and took the book.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And I find the word in the in the Greek,
[1:00:59] he took the book so very very
[1:01:01] interesting. And here are here are a
[1:01:03] number of statements that comprise that
[1:01:07] one word. He took the book. The first
[1:01:10] one is to take what's his own.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; There's a record of a lot of people
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; in that book.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My sheep
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; hear my voice."
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; My sheep.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Can you identify yourselves there?
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Right now, you need to say,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; "I either want to hear or I not want to
[1:01:41] hear."
[1:01:42] And if deep down in your heart, maybe
[1:01:44] you're not where you ought to be, but if
[1:01:46] deep down in your heart,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; deep down in your heart,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; in the very very deep recess, you know
[1:01:52] you're born to be a child.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, don't wait for this.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; This is the power of the gospel. This is
[1:02:04] the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:07] [Music]
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Deny him.
[1:02:10] Deny that lie.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Deny Satan.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; If you don't, there'll only be more
[1:02:17] scars.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; It'll only the the news will only get
[1:02:21] tighter.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; The chains will only be another another
[1:02:27] wrap around you.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; I know. I've been there.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; But I also know they've been broken.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Don't let him put a damper on your life.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; He came to take his own.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Not all are his own.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; But to take what is one's own and to
[1:02:50] take it not just to take it, but to take
[1:02:52] it to oneself.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; I can see that lamb as it were. He
[1:02:58] didn't just take the book and say, "Oh,
[1:03:01] father, I got the book." No, he embraced
[1:03:03] that book.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; These are mine.
[1:03:06] They belong to me.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; I'm buying them.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I love them.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they came out from
[1:03:14] him.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; They're part of him.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; That's number one. To claim for oneself.
[1:03:25] Friends, for those of you that know this
[1:03:27] message in the in the seals before he
[1:03:31] breaks into seal number one and on
[1:03:34] through seven and questions and answers
[1:03:37] in the bridge, he goes back to Boaz and
[1:03:40] Ruth who I may touch on this morning yet
[1:03:43] and says and and because what what is
[1:03:46] happening there is Ruth is being
[1:03:48] redeemed.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; What is what is redemption? It is to buy
[1:03:53] back Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; What belonged to you in the first place?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Let us reconcile to reconcile to God.
[1:04:01] Let us reconcile to bring back to United
[1:04:05] King.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been reconciled to
[1:04:08] God.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; We have been redeemed by the
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; You can do what you want. I'm going to
[1:04:17] have a glorious
[1:04:19] you want. I'm going to preach anyhow. I
[1:04:22] just feel it so burning on my heart. We
[1:04:24] will redeem.
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Wo to those that would say not me.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; It's not for me.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you, hell is is a terrible,
[1:04:37] terrible place. And the wages of sin is
[1:04:40] death.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Let's say it.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And it can't be any other way.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You play with fire, you're going to get
[1:04:48] burned.
[1:04:50] You play with sand, you're going to get
[1:04:52] burned.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; It's going to drag you to a place you
[1:04:55] don't want to go.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to say today, this is a
[1:05:01] glorious road, this highway of holiness.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And the second thing in the breach, he
[1:05:12] says he comes forth. What's he talking
[1:05:15] about? Coming to take the book. He's
[1:05:17] talking about that very scripture in
[1:05:19] Revelation 5. He comes forth
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and takes the book of redemption
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; to claim his rights of what he did for
[1:05:29] us.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Says, "I've got the price." He's Boaz,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; the mighty man of wealth.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Where's the wealth? It's in his blood.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; No one had blood like that.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; No one could pay the sacrifice.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; No one was shitless.
[1:05:46] Hallelujah.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; By himself
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ,
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; he had the He was Boaz, the mighty man
[1:05:55] of wealth. He took the book and took it
[1:05:57] to himself.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; It was claiming you.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to go over the edge
[1:06:03] for some of you,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; In in coming in the end time, he came.
[1:06:09] He descended according to Revelation
[1:06:11] 10:1. He descended for the purpose. And
[1:06:14] when he descended, Revelation 10:1, the
[1:06:16] book is open.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself. He is that book.
[1:06:21] He is the word. He's revealing himself
[1:06:23] to his bride because because a bride in
[1:06:26] the bridegroom must know him.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; No more secrets.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; This isn't a courtship anymore. This is
[1:06:34] marriage.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in a marriage with a
[1:06:41] bunch of secrets.
[1:06:43] even a marriage that's open
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; to one another.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's what marriage is all about.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And he came to be married.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Had a prophet on earth to do the
[1:06:54] ceremony.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's what the invisible union was all
[1:06:58] about. I'm not talking in poetic
[1:07:00] license. That's what happened.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; He conducted the ceremony.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And the word was there. Christ himself
[1:07:06] uniting to his bride.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had to have that kind of
[1:07:11] ministry to unite them together.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; The same ministry he showed 2,000 years
[1:07:15] ago.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; And he did it today.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell people's names and reveal
[1:07:20] a secret in their heart to tickle their
[1:07:22] ears.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't for those out there. They
[1:07:25] rejected it.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; They rejected him who did it.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Like those in the time of Jesus, they
[1:07:30] received the healing, received the
[1:07:32] miracles, but in the time of receiving
[1:07:34] his word, they refused it
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; and died.
[1:07:39] We haven't refused it. We received it
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and we love it.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; It's not it. It's him.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The word is him.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And the next thing when he took it,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; it is to associate
[1:07:56] to associate with oneself
[1:07:59] as companion.
[1:08:01] And a companion in the scripture is even
[1:08:03] as a wife
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; who's a partner
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; as a companion.
[1:08:08] And he came to associate. He didn't come
[1:08:10] just take a book. He came to marry.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; To marry them as a bride
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; and take her to himself.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; As a companion.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Not just as a friend. This is some kind
[1:08:23] of loose relationship which they do have
[1:08:26] here in the world so much today. This
[1:08:28] kind of we're going to hang loose. This
[1:08:30] isn't hang loose. This is be tight.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. Wonderful.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Glad you're all here. I'm glad you're
[1:08:39] saying amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And then when he took the book, it has a
[1:08:44] third meaning. That is what has been
[1:08:47] taken will not be let go.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; They will not let it go.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said you have been taken in.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; See, he will not let you go.
[1:09:04] You hate him.
[1:09:10] I will not let this go.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; There is no one that can take that book
[1:09:18] out of his hand. You are included.
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't this isn't this complimentary to
[1:09:27] the scripture
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; where it says all that the father hath
[1:09:30] given me
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; will come
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of it.
[1:09:36] I will lose one of them.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I will lose a few of them. I will lose
[1:09:40] none of them.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. I will lose
[1:09:45] none of them.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say with me? He will not
[1:09:50] let me go.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; He will not
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:59] love
[1:10:01] the song.
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:10] Glory
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; to hold
[1:10:17] to oneself to lay hold upon and take
[1:10:20] possession of.
[1:10:22] But the last is the most beautiful to
[1:10:24] me. To take the book is to take it in
[1:10:29] order to carry it away.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. Hallelujah. He didn't
[1:10:37] just take us so we camp down and live
[1:10:39] through this little short life here in
[1:10:41] labor, but he took us to carry us away.
[1:10:45] Hallelujah.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; And if I go away,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; I will come again and receive you out of
[1:10:50] my shadow. And where I am, there may be
[1:10:55] carry you away.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; That's what that was all in that motion
[1:11:01] of taking the book was in his mind was
[1:11:03] to carry you away, to never let you go,
[1:11:06] to never s never see us. He wouldn't let
[1:11:09] his rock in and then Satan come and
[1:11:11] darken your darken his name by leaving
[1:11:15] stains on you.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus stands today and says
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Say remember when this done when they
[1:11:26] did this I can't remember it.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's not even in my cont.
[1:11:38] the sins of God.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I love the language of the promises. It
[1:11:43] broke it up.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It broke the sin out.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; It broke the ink out. It broke the
[1:11:48] elements until it became bleak.
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Check that one out.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; If I had all afternoon, I could maybe
[1:12:04] lead you into that a wee bit. Praise
[1:12:06] God.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; We'll touch on it.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Became bleach.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; My sin became bleach.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's power.
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; That's power.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; In the breach. He said,
[1:12:29] he said, "No one could do it. No one
[1:12:32] could take this book." and he walked
[1:12:35] right up to the right hand of God and he
[1:12:38] took the book out of his hand and
[1:12:40] claimed his rights. That was you
[1:12:43] claiming you.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; I died for them.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I'm the kinsman redeemer.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; I'm the mediator.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; My blood was shed.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen as I
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He says I am the mediator.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; My blood was shed. I have be I have
[1:13:02] become man
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; and I did this in order to get the
[1:13:05] church back again
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; and the one I foresaw from the
[1:13:09] foundation of the world
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I have purposed it
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; I spoke that it would be there
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and nobody was able to take it but I
[1:13:17] went down and and done it myself I am
[1:13:21] their kinsman they have become kin folks
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah I don't know what your family
[1:13:28] is my family my human family. And don't
[1:13:32] consider me disrespectful, but it
[1:13:34] doesn't mean a whole lot. It's my
[1:13:36] spiritual family.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Our spiritual family and souls that are
[1:13:48] in prison.
[1:13:51] He said,
[1:13:53] he said, "Now, now we'll uh now people
[1:13:57] will still come to the altar." It's
[1:13:59] talking about in souls in prison.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; They can't do anything while they're in
[1:14:04] prison.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; People will still come to the altar.
[1:14:07] They'll still cry out, but it won't do
[1:14:10] no good.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; It'll be calm. It'll be over. There
[1:14:14] won't be no more. There won't be no
[1:14:16] mercy. Remember that.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And the sanctuary becomes smoking. He
[1:14:21] that's filthy is filthy still. He that's
[1:14:24] righteous is righteous still. And he
[1:14:26] that's holy is holy still. He said
[1:14:28] there's no more mercy when the lamb
[1:14:30] takes the book.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's it. He said that's all of it. And
[1:14:34] it it looks a whole lot like it could be
[1:14:37] now.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; This is 63.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; You say and this is a confusion to a lot
[1:14:42] of people. So, well, oh, no one can come
[1:14:45] anymore. That's not what he's saying. He
[1:14:46] said there'll be no more mercy. And he's
[1:14:48] preaching to people that were rejecting
[1:14:50] the message right there
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; because the the dispensation which had
[1:14:55] been committed to the prophet messenger
[1:14:58] was to carry the word from that
[1:15:00] denominational era into the bride age.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:15:06] And the mercy did the the administration
[1:15:08] of it because in a husband wife
[1:15:12] relationship
[1:15:13] the administration changes
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; in a proper relationship the husband is
[1:15:19] to be responsible now to carry the
[1:15:22] affairs of the household.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures teach us. The
[1:15:26] husband is responsible to carry the
[1:15:29] affairs of the household.
[1:15:31] I don't care what the reality is in
[1:15:33] today's 21st century. I don't care about
[1:15:36] that, you know, and and women have to
[1:15:39] take the lead and all the rest of it. I
[1:15:40] don't believe in it.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; The husband's to be responsible. He's to
[1:15:44] carry the load. He's to take the
[1:15:46] administration of the home. She has
[1:15:49] provided.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I talked to some man. I said, "Do you
[1:15:53] provide for your family?" Well, I try. I
[1:15:55] said, "That isn't what I asked.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; I try.
[1:16:00] I provide for them.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I may not give them all that they want,
[1:16:04] but I provide for them.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You are you message believer?
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And the administration changes exactly
[1:16:15] as those you that have heard the the the
[1:16:18] administration of the son of man, you
[1:16:20] remember, and I'm just touching on it
[1:16:22] very very briefly where the Apostle Paul
[1:16:25] says a dispensation. If you look into
[1:16:27] the Greek, it's the administration.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; The administration or the dispensation,
[1:16:33] a dispensation or an administration of
[1:16:37] the gospel, he said, has been committed
[1:16:39] unto me. Why? Because it was changing
[1:16:42] from law to grace.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And in this day, in the revealing of the
[1:16:47] son of man, it's changing from grace to
[1:16:49] judgment,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; from lamb to lamb.
[1:16:56] You get it?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; It's in that it's in that change over
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; and the the mercy that was obtainable
[1:17:05] accessible in the past was not
[1:17:08] accessible under the old system anymore.
[1:17:10] Look where they went.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, look where the
[1:17:13] denomination world. Look where Pentecost
[1:17:15] has gone. Look where these churches that
[1:17:16] were full gospel. Look where they've
[1:17:18] gone. It's shameful.
[1:17:21] Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; The reportment and conduct is a disgrace
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; to the gospel.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Look at the nakedness of the women
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; right in the church.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Look at the disrespect walking into the
[1:17:33] house of God with shorts and sandals and
[1:17:36] whatever more. I don't agree with it.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I think we should be respectful to
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even go and see the premier
[1:17:46] of the province or the governor of the
[1:17:47] state that
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] [Applause]
[1:17:53] That's good.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Glad you agreed cuz I was going to blast
[1:17:56] it again.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we should be respectful
[1:18:00] to the
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; what he's done.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And so the administration has changed.
[1:18:09] I've used this example in in the United
[1:18:11] States especially. They call Washington
[1:18:14] the administration and they're about to
[1:18:16] change administration in another few
[1:18:18] months in November in an election and
[1:18:21] one of the one of the candidates will be
[1:18:24] voted in as president whether it's
[1:18:25] McCain or Obama uh Barack Obama and so
[1:18:29] one of them are going to get in and sure
[1:18:31] enough soon as they get in President
[1:18:34] Bush's signature will not have any power
[1:18:38] the day he's out.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Why? because he's gone.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; But right now, he has he has authority.
[1:18:46] He has power with his Republican party
[1:18:49] to to uh to enact certain things
[1:18:53] providing he has control. And so they
[1:18:55] can do certain things with the resources
[1:18:57] of the land, the oil that is in Texas
[1:19:00] and the gold that's in Kentucky, if
[1:19:02] there's any there. I don't know.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Any of you folks from the States know
[1:19:08] there's any gold down there?
[1:19:14] We haven't got a very confident group,
[1:19:16] have we?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Well, if there's any gold in Fort Knox,
[1:19:20] Kentucky anyway, the resources of the of
[1:19:23] the land, the resources, understand the
[1:19:27] resources will come and shift under
[1:19:29] another administration. And to have to
[1:19:32] have people to try to use a
[1:19:34] denominational system to gain access to
[1:19:36] mercy is trying to go to a president
[1:19:38] that's been voted out of power and say
[1:19:41] give me a pardon.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Say you're talking to the wrong guy.
[1:19:43] That's just George Bush from Texas.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Is it right?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Or to go to Mr. Clinton and say, "Oh, I
[1:19:52] appealed to you old former president and
[1:19:55] say I have no more power.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The administration I'm it's in another
[1:19:59] administration now. That's what the
[1:20:01] prophet trying to tell us.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Mercy's gone.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He trying to tell those people there's
[1:20:08] no more mercy. You cannot access it
[1:20:10] anymore.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; But the word that was coming, which is
[1:20:14] the message of Christ, and he never lost
[1:20:17] mercy.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; He has as much mercy today as he had
[1:20:23] yesterday.
[1:20:28] And that's why the Apostle Paul says an
[1:20:30] administration or a dispensation has
[1:20:32] been committed to me because they could
[1:20:34] get it under the high priest just a few
[1:20:36] years before. I said you can't anymore.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; You can kill all the lambs you want. But
[1:20:41] since the since the gospel has come, you
[1:20:44] can kill the lambs will be killed in
[1:20:46] vain.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Can you understand? The very day that
[1:20:50] Jesus was the very day Jesus died, the
[1:20:53] prophet said the merc mercy seat
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; came into full view.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; What happened the year before? They
[1:21:03] could kill their lambs,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; they could kill a physical lamb from
[1:21:06] their flock and and God accepted it.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Didn't wash their sins away, but they
[1:21:12] had their sins were covered
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; because they're obedient to the word.
[1:21:18] Come on.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; But now when the word himself
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; is spoken
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Verbatim
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; out of the mouth of a messenger.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; That's Christ.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And you receive reject that there's no
[1:21:34] mercy. You receive it. You have mercy.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; The word the word the word the word has
[1:21:42] the mercy. Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's not a chair.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's not a destination or a
[1:21:50] location. The mercy seat is in Christ.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He is the mercy seat.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; When you receive the message, you
[1:21:57] receive the mercy.
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; No more mercy when the lamb tastes. Why?
[1:22:10] because it has shifted
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; completely
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; in harvest time said and he called
[1:22:17] everything what was on that book he said
[1:22:19] it's a complete book of redemption
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and this is it the book of redemption he
[1:22:24] redeemed all was in that book but not
[1:22:27] out of the book
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; what was in the book
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; he's the book
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; all that are in Christ
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; were redeemed
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; receive mercy
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and those outside of it those who
[1:22:39] refused used remained in the book of
[1:22:41] life
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and that's why when the white throne
[1:22:43] judgment comes the books are open
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; and another book is open
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; and the people are judged what's in the
[1:22:51] book
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; if you want to be judged for your deeds
[1:22:54] reject this message
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; if you want mercy
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; from the giver of all mercy
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; receive it
[1:23:04] [Applause]
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; you're not receiving this church you're
[1:23:08] not joining this
[1:23:09] as they receive Christ,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; the revealed word of this day.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; That is him.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; We want to be thankful.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Not just myself, but whoever ministers
[1:23:24] behind these pullpits here, ministers
[1:23:26] the full word of God, the full council
[1:23:28] of God. You're not going to hear this
[1:23:30] down the street.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; You're not going to hear this in the
[1:23:32] church up the road. You're not going to
[1:23:34] hear it. You want to thank God I'm here.
[1:23:38] Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And events made it clear. He says he was
[1:23:45] the word of God revealed and the whole
[1:23:47] complete book of redemption. The Bible
[1:23:50] is God's word foretelling the future
[1:23:52] events.
[1:23:55] Then I in invisible union now still
[1:23:59] trying to watch my time but we only have
[1:24:01] one service today. Yeah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; He said like John. He said Malachi 4,
[1:24:07] Luke 17:30, John 14:12, Joel 2:38
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; says those promises is just exactly like
[1:24:15] John the Baptist identified himself in
[1:24:18] the scripture. Jesus identified himself.
[1:24:21] What's the messenger saying? I'm
[1:24:23] identifying myself.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Didn't have to say that's me. He said
[1:24:28] just came and did what those scriptures
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; fortold would happen at this time.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30 was the revealing of the son
[1:24:35] of man. And he came said that's what he
[1:24:37] did when he was back here. That's what
[1:24:39] he's doing today. I'll prove it to you.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; This is a proof of it.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And what did exactly what Jesus did?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; We haven't got time to go into that. He
[1:24:50] says, "Identified." Jesus identified
[1:24:52] himself. He says, "But what did they
[1:24:53] say? Away with such a person." Right.
[1:24:56] Right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; John's a wild man.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; The church wasn't able to receive it.
[1:25:01] Said that's the pattern.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; That's the pattern.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; And so when this message comes, a
[1:25:09] different change of administration.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You young people, you must know what a
[1:25:15] change of administration is. You know,
[1:25:18] you you grow up and all the rest of it
[1:25:23] and things change.
[1:25:25] And you come under you young ladies and
[1:25:29] when you get married you come under
[1:25:31] another headship.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I got three girls here but they have
[1:25:36] their own husbands
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; and I don't tell them a whole lot of
[1:25:40] things because they got husbands to tell
[1:25:43] them.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; They've got a head in the home and the
[1:25:47] administration changed from dad to
[1:25:50] husband.
[1:25:54] Well,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; it all starts
[1:25:57] real nice.
[1:25:59] We got some newlyweds right here, Joel
[1:26:02] and Esther.
[1:26:05] God bless you, Sister Esther. You're now
[1:26:07] got a provider.
[1:26:12] Sister Christine, she's going to find
[1:26:14] that out pretty soon.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Can I tell them about your
[1:26:27] One thing I like about brother Kyle,
[1:26:28] just one thing, it's a lot of things,
[1:26:29] but one thing I like about him, he
[1:26:31] comes, he's got everything figured out.
[1:26:32] Now, Brother Ed, uh, you know, I'm
[1:26:34] interested in this young lady. Okay? I
[1:26:36] don't quite often I don't ask who it is
[1:26:38] right away. And I want to know what I
[1:26:40] have to do. Number one is, you know,
[1:26:42] what do I do first? And number two,
[1:26:44] number three. Okay? Maybe sometimes
[1:26:46] there's four and five questions. So as
[1:26:49] soon as I answer those questions, he
[1:26:50] takes it. Okay, fine. Goes out, lets me
[1:26:53] know, I did one, two, and three. I just
[1:26:55] going to do two, four, and five now and
[1:26:57] then we'll be done. And come back say,
[1:26:59] well, I did that. Now what do I do? See,
[1:27:01] so we let a little time goes by. So a
[1:27:03] little time went by and said, I need to
[1:27:06] see you again. Okay, this thing's moving
[1:27:08] forward. All right, so you don't mind.
[1:27:11] We're a family.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; So Kyle comes in last service and and uh
[1:27:22] says I I need to know now what do I do?
[1:27:24] You know cuz we're I said are you moving
[1:27:27] towards marriage? Yeah. Okay. You need
[1:27:29] to talk to her dad. Okay. And then
[1:27:31] what's the next thing? I said well you
[1:27:34] need to you know talk to the young lady.
[1:27:36] And I said don't just go up you know hey
[1:27:38] will you marry me? You know you got to
[1:27:40] create an atmosphere. Do something a
[1:27:43] little bit different.
[1:27:45] So he said he caught some inspiration
[1:27:47] from that.
[1:27:50] And I guarantee nobody has done this.
[1:27:53] What I talking about? I'm talking about
[1:27:55] this was a shift of administration
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; because sister Christine works at Mary's
[1:28:00] Garden which is right near our house and
[1:28:02] it's right on the Nickel Mickel River.
[1:28:04] So, brother Kyle, he goes and buys a
[1:28:06] boat, a rubber dingy, and he rolls for
[1:28:10] an hour and a half up the river. And
[1:28:14] then he climbs up the bank to see if
[1:28:16] he's near Mary's garden, like his bride
[1:28:19] to be is working. And he climbs up there
[1:28:22] and he sees he's pretty close. So, he
[1:28:23] gets his trusty cell phone and calls the
[1:28:26] fellow in the shop or in the store and
[1:28:29] says, "Would you send Christine out to
[1:28:30] the riverbank?" Because that's right on
[1:28:32] the field, you see. So she goes out to
[1:28:34] the river bank and there he is in the
[1:28:37] dinghy to propose to her
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:49] like that. Brother Kyle, Sister
[1:28:51] Christine, I know them well enough to be
[1:28:53] able to say that and that's as far as
[1:28:55] I'll go with it. But I'll tell you what,
[1:28:56] Sister Christine,
[1:28:59] Mary's garden will be a thing of the
[1:29:00] past.
[1:29:06] Brother Kyle takes and shifts the
[1:29:08] administration.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, bride?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; To know that a whole lot of things.
[1:29:15] Isn't it wonderful to know the mortgage
[1:29:17] been paid off?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know that Satan
[1:29:20] has no more claim on him?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know you're not in
[1:29:24] debt to him anymore?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; The administration changed. Nothing
[1:29:30] changed.
[1:29:31] Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; We came to a marriage. We're married
[1:29:36] here. We're going to the marriage
[1:29:37] supper.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Just give me another few minutes of your
[1:29:43] attention please.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; So he said also an invisible union.
[1:29:49] These very scriptures Malachi 4, Luke
[1:29:52] 17:30, John 14:12, and Joel 2:38. He
[1:29:56] identified himself. Said, "And that's
[1:29:58] the pattern. But to the elected of God,
[1:30:02] to the elected, he said God's calling to
[1:30:04] the elected. They know it. Calling the
[1:30:07] virtuous bride. The word for the last
[1:30:10] day church, the elected lady of our Lord
[1:30:14] Jesus Christ. The word. If Jesus is the
[1:30:17] word, then now I'm taking just a little
[1:30:19] shift. Hang on. If Jesus is the word,
[1:30:23] then the bride is always part of
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. Amen.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He never loses his pattern.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He always did it the same way.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; He does it again, calling out the
[1:30:38] virtuous bride in the last days, the
[1:30:40] lovely Rebecca waiting for her husband.
[1:30:43] What a beautiful time. And now he says,
[1:30:45] "Now here comes into view the two
[1:30:48] books." See, and I just wanted to get
[1:30:50] that phrase ahead of it. The beautiful
[1:30:53] scene of Isaac and Rebecca. He says,
[1:30:56] "And here comes into view the two books,
[1:30:58] the book of life and the one where your
[1:31:00] name and then can come off in the book
[1:31:02] of of of uh the book of the lamb's book
[1:31:07] of life." He said, "This brings it
[1:31:08] perfectly into view." He says, "Life is
[1:31:12] a sacred thing and it's recorded in a
[1:31:15] book."
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Those were the quotes I read at the
[1:31:18] beginning, but this is where they lay in
[1:31:19] the message. Now he said your first
[1:31:22] husband that had the rule over you was
[1:31:25] your nature by natural birth.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning
[1:31:34] and you're under that administration
[1:31:38] of that husband,
[1:31:41] he's a cruel task minister.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And brother Biscll is your friend.
[1:31:48] Today I'm not speaking a sermon. I'm
[1:31:50] telling you you can be free from
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; How can I be free, brother Biscll? I can
[1:31:59] tell you how you can be free. As soon as
[1:32:01] you turn and point to Calvary,
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; in order to be free from that union,
[1:32:07] that marriage,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; you have to acknowledge and believe on
[1:32:11] the Lord Jesus Christ. Because when he
[1:32:13] died,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; the only way that marriage can be broken
[1:32:19] is by the death of the husband.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; And Jesus became sin.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And took your union
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; and died.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Didn't go to sleep. He died.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And when he died, your husband died with
[1:32:37] him. If you accept it,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; you got to accept the pardon. You got to
[1:32:42] accept the divorce.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; He divorced you from that old nature.
[1:32:46] You want to sit here with that old
[1:32:47] nature, that's your problem.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I believe on Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ. I believe he died and rose." I
[1:32:55] can say to you, you're free from that
[1:32:57] old nature.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; You're free from that.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; You accept it.
[1:33:05] Amen.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I'm here today to tell you, you're free
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; from that nature that you were born with
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; like Calvary.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And now here's here's where I'm taking a
[1:33:19] shift.
[1:33:22] You have to give some thought to this.
[1:33:25] I have been thinking very very deep on
[1:33:27] this for some time.
[1:33:30] the entire body of scripture.
[1:33:33] See, sometimes I have to ask a question,
[1:33:35] sometimes deep provoking questions in
[1:33:38] order to energize your mind to think
[1:33:42] and to come up with the right answer.
[1:33:45] But the entire body of scripture
[1:33:49] is Christ. Yes. Right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; But in here
[1:33:56] is the record of men's sins
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; and women's sins.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And horrible crimes,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; that were committed and wars
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; and bloodshed
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and death. And the prophet said, "You've
[1:34:14] got to be able to look at every
[1:34:16] scripture and read it and see Christ."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And I know that stumbles a lot of
[1:34:24] people,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; even sitting here today. How do I read
[1:34:27] those terrible things and see Christ?
[1:34:31] I'll tell you why. Because Christ is
[1:34:34] greater than the thing you're reading.
[1:34:36] So, I'm reading a terrible sin. Where do
[1:34:39] I see Christ? You see him as the savior
[1:34:42] of that state.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; You read about this war. You read about
[1:34:47] this bloodshed. What do how can I see
[1:34:50] Christ in it? You see, the prince of
[1:34:52] peace is greater than the war.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; But it's recorded because it's recorded
[1:35:00] in a book called the book of life.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It's recorded in the book. and the book
[1:35:06] of life. It wasn't only those people's
[1:35:10] terrible crimes and terrible sins, but
[1:35:13] it's anything that say on you
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; of your past
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; or your recent past
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; or this morning.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Soon as something's done wrong, soon as
[1:35:26] a sin is committed, we say, "Father,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean that. That's not from my
[1:35:31] heart. I'm sorry for it. Forgive me for
[1:35:35] it.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That act asked alone
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; on the authority of God's word
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; drops that act into the bleach
[1:35:45] and it is forgotten, forgotten,
[1:35:48] forgotten and can never be remembered.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Friends, if it's not,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; how much has fall? How much has flowed
[1:35:56] through?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; How much are you carrying?
[1:36:06] So he says
[1:36:10] that the entire body now he says the
[1:36:13] word of God the word is God in letter
[1:36:19] form.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; How do I reconcile everything you read
[1:36:24] in the Bible?
[1:36:26] And this is where my title of my message
[1:36:30] is.
[1:36:32] And I want you to see your own life. You
[1:36:37] need to discern between the humanity.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And the deity.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Was G Jesus deity?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Answer me. Was Jesus
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; deity?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus say, "I will be in you." Yes.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Did he say it?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I will be in you. Do you believe that?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Then his deity come into you.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; But you see, we're a conglomeration of
[1:37:05] both books.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; We're still in a body
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; doing things, thinking things, saying
[1:37:13] things that we don't really want to do.
[1:37:16] We have that sticky nature and we and we
[1:37:18] don't want to just shut our eyes and
[1:37:19] say, "Well, I'm going to pretend it's
[1:37:22] not there." No, it's there. But there
[1:37:24] has already been an atonement made.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; There's already been a provision made.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; There's already been a lamb. Stand up.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; There's already been a lamb. Take the
[1:37:33] books.
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; They are mine.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; They're my elected children.
[1:37:42] And I have the price whereby to erase
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; the power to erase
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; every every trace of sin, every stain
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; because they're mine.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; The entire Bible
[1:38:03] records both the humanity and the deity.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This Bible,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; this Bible records both.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It records, as I've just put in my
[1:38:17] notes, some terrible deeds, some wars,
[1:38:19] some sickness.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; People are afflicted and sick.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And you read that. I challenge you. You
[1:38:26] read that, you say, "The prophet of God
[1:38:29] said you should see Christ."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; So, you read that. Do you see Christ?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It's awfully hard. One man got
[1:38:39] interested one of my school chums. We
[1:38:42] grew up to be young men. Got married and
[1:38:44] he was in business and he was from a
[1:38:46] wellto-do family but he became
[1:38:50] he became uh interested I will say in in
[1:38:54] my life and so he he told me he says hey
[1:38:57] he said I started reading the Bible. He
[1:39:00] says I started from Genesis I started
[1:39:02] reading the Bible. He says oh they did
[1:39:05] some terrible things back there. I said,
[1:39:07] "Yeah, they did."
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't until many years later then I
[1:39:12] pick up a message and hear a prophet
[1:39:14] say, "You need to see the you need to
[1:39:17] see Christ in every verse."
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I'm human as you
[1:39:22] well know
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; and have a lot of frailties
[1:39:25] and weaknesses
[1:39:28] and I never understood clearly that
[1:39:31] other book until the last two three
[1:39:34] weeks.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's why you
[1:39:37] never heard me preach it before.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I never understood clearly that you not
[1:39:45] not William Brown, you need to look at
[1:39:48] every verse
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and see Christ.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And I was honest with God. I said, I I
[1:39:56] read these verses and I can't see you.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; And yet I know it is you. Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's great.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; How can I see you?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; And I just let it set.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Not months, years.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Years.
[1:40:13] Then in my study,
[1:40:15] it becomes
[1:40:18] like in front of you.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; You read about sin,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; but I'm there because I'm the savior.
[1:40:27] You read about war, but I'm there
[1:40:30] because I'm the peacemaker.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; You read about sickness because I'm
[1:40:34] Jehovah Rafa, the healer.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I'm the solution to everything in the
[1:40:41] book of life. I'm the solution
[1:40:44] and the solution. The answer came and
[1:40:47] took the book of life and made it the
[1:40:49] lamb's book of life.
[1:40:52] Friends,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; the lamb has the answer for your
[1:40:56] sickness.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; The lamb has the answer for the burden
[1:40:59] you carry.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; The lamb has the answer. And if we don't
[1:41:03] get the answer right away, even that's
[1:41:05] an answer. When he's silent, he's still
[1:41:07] an answer.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He's still the answer.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; There's no reason, no, there's no reason
[1:41:17] why we should doubt him.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; He's already proven his case.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He's the answer.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Give me just a few more minutes.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; The lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:41:30] the world. He's the answer to all these
[1:41:33] things.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the fullness of the word,
[1:41:37] had the remedy for every sin that
[1:41:40] plagued humanity.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:46] we're still moving.
[1:41:50] You were taken out from him.
[1:41:56] That's what the scripture indicates.
[1:41:58] That's what the prophet of God said. You
[1:42:00] were taken out from him.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And still
[1:42:05] we are plagued with these things that
[1:42:08] hound us,
[1:42:10] weaknesses and frailties.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Is there anything about your life that
[1:42:14] you really dislike?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:42:19] Come on.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Be honest.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there's things that we
[1:42:26] actually there's some things that we
[1:42:27] actually hate
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; about ourselves.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, give me the power
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; and I will be able to." What we're
[1:42:36] really saying is, "I can mold it
[1:42:37] better."
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; No, he's the He's He's the potter.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He's the potter.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; He's the potter.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Let's say I'm the clay.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; I'm the clay.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; I'm the clay. He's the potter.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I declare.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Not the way it's going to stay.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; But we came out from him.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And in here was all kinds of things.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's hard to see Christ in.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; But he was what I'm telling you. He was
[1:43:08] greater than the war.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; He's greater than the trouble.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; He's greater than the sickness. And when
[1:43:14] you came out from him, you still had
[1:43:16] some of those things.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; You still carry some of those things.
[1:43:20] You still have conflicts. You still
[1:43:22] have, you know, maybe upsets. You have
[1:43:25] things that take place. You say things.
[1:43:28] You have attitudes. You have things and
[1:43:30] you don't want them. You don't like
[1:43:32] them. You say, "How could I come out of
[1:43:34] Christ and still have those things?"
[1:43:35] Because it's humanity and deity.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; It's both humanity and deity. And you
[1:43:43] need to see deity.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You need to see Christ
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; in your own self.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that, friends.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's that's really the that's
[1:43:55] really the nut of the service. You need
[1:43:57] you need to say today, God, give me
[1:44:00] discernment
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; so I can see Christ
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; in this person,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Christ in me. And Christ, we need to
[1:44:07] have discernment between deity and
[1:44:10] humanity.
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:15] All right.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; If you want, I'll say it again.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You, I, everybody,
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; you need
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; you need to
[1:44:27] really uh refine, exercise
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; that ability
[1:44:35] to discern between
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; humanity and deity. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; You know how much that will help you?
[1:44:46] It'll help you a whole lot.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; You'll see somebody and they do
[1:44:50] something
[1:44:52] that your spirit says, "Ah, that wasn't
[1:44:55] really Christian.
[1:45:00] That really wasn't Christian to do that
[1:45:03] or to say that." But when you have the
[1:45:05] discernment
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and you discern and say,
[1:45:10] That's humanity.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; And the Christ that bought him,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; the Christ that bought her has paid for
[1:45:19] that.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to leave it with him.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And then when it's your own self,
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; hey, come home now.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I'll come right to your address.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; And we have a slip up. And we do
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; in this walk.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I would have a whole
[1:45:41] lot less to do
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; if you have that discernment
[1:45:45] between humanity
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and deity.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; The next time you fail, and you will.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; The next time you do something that
[1:45:56] you're actually ashamed of, the next
[1:45:58] time you say something, this is not an
[1:46:01] ex. This isn't a backdoor. This isn't an
[1:46:03] excuse, but it does happen. It's a
[1:46:06] reality
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; and I'm ask I'm now telling you how to
[1:46:09] deal with it
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; and I believe the Holy Spirit is telling
[1:46:12] you how to deal with it
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and you need to say first I know I am a
[1:46:18] son or daughter of God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; I know that.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; And if I am a son or daughter of God
[1:46:24] that means even though I feel as low as
[1:46:27] the dust of the earth I have to confess
[1:46:29] that I have deity abiding within me.
[1:46:34] And I make that confession. Christ
[1:46:36] dwells in me.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Even though everything around me is
[1:46:40] declaring something different
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; and Satan is right there to say, "You're
[1:46:44] a scoundrel. You're a rat.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You're a lower. You think you're in the
[1:46:49] pride you think that you are." And then
[1:46:51] he just heaps on condemnation. And you
[1:46:53] start bending and agreeing with that.
[1:46:55] You're in for a deep hole.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; You're in for a deep dark place. But
[1:47:00] even if you say that may be true, but I
[1:47:02] won't agree with you, sir.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; When Satan came to Jesus, he said, "If
[1:47:08] thou be the son of God," notice he was
[1:47:10] attacking his sunship. He was attacking
[1:47:13] his position. He was not saying there is
[1:47:15] no son of God. He was saying, "If you
[1:47:18] think you're him,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; that's the way he always comes. If you
[1:47:22] think you're that son or daughter of
[1:47:24] God,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; good,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; then do this." And even though he quoted
[1:47:28] the scripture to Jesus, he didn't even
[1:47:30] change a word in one place. He quoted it
[1:47:32] exactly correct.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus refused to agree with him because
[1:47:38] the source was wrong.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So when you fail and you know you fail,
[1:47:45] you don't need some demon from hell to
[1:47:47] tell you you failed.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; You don't need Satan as your as as your
[1:47:51] accomplice or your company to come and
[1:47:53] tell you that you did wrong. You don't
[1:47:55] need him. You say, "Satan, get behind
[1:47:58] me.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; I have one who will speak to me. I have
[1:48:03] one who will convict me. And I have one
[1:48:06] who paid the price already."
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And you know what you do?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to me close. Now I'm closing.
[1:48:20] Instead of continuing to write the old
[1:48:22] book,
[1:48:26] You let
[1:48:28] him who took that book
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; erase it out
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; by dealing with it.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I would like this service to be a
[1:48:36] service of mass erasing
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; of your failings and of your wrong and
[1:48:42] whatever more
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; and your confession.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; He bought it. He didn't never let it go.
[1:48:48] He paid the full price. And I'm going to
[1:48:51] confess it today. And I'm going to
[1:48:52] acknowledge him taking it. I'm going to
[1:48:55] acknowledge his ownership.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to acknowledge that he has
[1:48:59] arrested.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; He has arrested.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; He so completely erases it.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; When you think of the things, and I'm
[1:49:13] just tying it together now as I close.
[1:49:15] When you think of the When you think of
[1:49:17] the things that Tamar committed, Right?
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; When you think of the things, but God
[1:49:24] wrote Tamar's
[1:49:27] iniquity in the word of God
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; because he actually took them wrong
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; and brought it back in
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; to the plan of redemption.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; For she brought forth a seed that would
[1:49:41] bring forth the lion of the tribe of
[1:49:43] Judah. What did she contribute?
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; She contributed to
[1:49:48] friends. This is deep.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; She contributed to humanity in her act
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; which would be considered gross
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; sleeping with her father-in-law.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And bringing forth a child, but she was
[1:50:06] driven,
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; not for sexual act.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; She was driven to fulfill the call of
[1:50:12] God.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "How would God do that? How
[1:50:15] could God get any glory?" All I know is
[1:50:18] that one came from that lineage called
[1:50:21] the lamb of the tribe of Judah. And
[1:50:23] that's who John saw in Revelation 5
[1:50:27] standing there. And you cannot separate
[1:50:30] that from counter's act.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; What is it friend?
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; The ink became bleach.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; The ink became bleach.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Do you understand me? Yeah,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; she did wrong.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; But her wrong actually brought forth the
[1:50:50] line of the tribe of Judah.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "What do we say to
[1:50:54] these things?" You know what I tell you?
[1:50:56] Say nothing.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; You can never figure it out.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; You can never figure it out. You can't
[1:51:02] even figure out your own life. Why try
[1:51:03] to figure out everybody else's life?
[1:51:06] You'll never figure out that because
[1:51:08] that's grace. Boundless grace.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; That's grace without measure.
[1:51:16] And if you had a God you could figure
[1:51:18] out, I don't want him.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I want a God you can't
[1:51:23] figure out,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; that I can't figure out. A God whose
[1:51:26] love is beyond me. A God who whose grace
[1:51:30] is beyond me.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; It's beyond us.
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Don't give me law. Give me grace.
[1:51:41] [Applause]
[1:51:46] And if a person
[1:51:48] doesn't want this kind of preaching,
[1:51:50] you'll live with your doubts.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; You'll live with the weight of your sin.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; You'll live with your condemnation.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; After service like this, don't come to
[1:51:59] me about your condemnation. This is the
[1:52:01] answer.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; This is the answer. When the lamb took
[1:52:05] the book,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; when he took the book, that book became
[1:52:09] the lamb's book of life.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; And that is why incidentally
[1:52:17] when you come to this page of the Bible,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; separating the Old Testament from the
[1:52:24] New.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You'll find over here where Abraham told
[1:52:28] a lie, but you never find any record of
[1:52:31] that lie over here. You'll find on this
[1:52:34] side where David committed a gross sin.
[1:52:37] But you'll never find it on this side.
[1:52:39] It cannot come through the
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; We came out from him.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And we go back to him.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; And he has received us, friends.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Don't think this is just a church. Don't
[1:53:13] think this is just a service. Don't
[1:53:14] think we're just another church of
[1:53:16] people. That's not it.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; We sit in a church like other people do.
[1:53:19] But this message is not like any other
[1:53:21] message.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; This wasn't hacked up in a Bible school.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hatched up by the Holy Spirit.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; It's a bright room.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Not pointing to the failures, the
[1:53:38] weaknesses of his pride. He's not
[1:53:40] propagating that. He's not advertising
[1:53:42] that. He's advertising
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; as he did
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; with Ruth. Amen.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; can you give me a moment?
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Reconciled,
[1:54:04] redeemed,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Boaz advertised
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; that he was buying Ruth the Moabitis
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; woman.
[1:54:15] Ruth's union to Boaz, which is our union
[1:54:19] to Christ, concludes the sad story.
[1:54:24] Oh, I have so much.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Let me just back up a wee bit, please.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Let me just back up a wee bit.
[1:54:35] Scripture tells us that God came and he
[1:54:39] took Eve
[1:54:41] out from Adam.
[1:54:45] And when she came out from Adam,
[1:54:48] she began to experience humanity
[1:54:53] and she began to write the book of
[1:54:56] humanity.
[1:55:01] And she committed a gross sin first by
[1:55:05] disbelieving the word of God and then by
[1:55:08] receiving the seed of the serpent.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says she did.
[1:55:13] Yes.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, I wouldn't know
[1:55:17] this and you wouldn't know it except the
[1:55:19] prophet says that in one place,
[1:55:22] Adam then who was portraying Christ,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Went in and took her quickly to himself.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't hug her.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't merely kiss her. He gave her
[1:55:37] his seed
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; because he knew that God could not
[1:55:41] destroy her with his seed.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; So he took her quickly to himself
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; and in the fall
[1:55:53] he redeemed her from the fall because he
[1:55:55] too was falling. Yeah.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; So while he was in the process of
[1:56:00] falling,
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; he takes hold of her to claim her back
[1:56:05] to himself.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Christ had to come down.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; And in his coming down,
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; becoming sin
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; for you,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; he claimed you in that descension
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; and took you quickly to himself.
[1:56:26] and put his seed, his word in you.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; He knew that God cannot destroy or bring
[1:56:35] you to judgment
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; with his seed in you.
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; And the same carries on the same
[1:56:51] pattern, the same story carries on
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; when we come to Ruth and Boaz. Are you
[1:56:57] too tired? Can take another five
[1:56:59] minutes.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; When we come to Ruth and Boaz and the
[1:57:02] prophet now in the end time, we we can
[1:57:04] say brother Benham said, listen, just
[1:57:06] remember it was Jesus Christ revealing
[1:57:09] himself.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; So it was Jesus Christ causing him to go
[1:57:13] back to Ruth's story.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; What is Ruth's story? What is her human
[1:57:18] part?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; What is her human part?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Her human part is I'm a widow.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Her human part is my husband has died
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; and I am left childless.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Her human part and she's writing it but
[1:57:35] is written in the word of God. That was
[1:57:37] the that was the order of her life.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Her human part is I'm povertystricken.
[1:57:43] Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Her human bodies were scarcely being
[1:57:46] kept alive.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; We're going through this world.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; My mother-in-law just said, "Don't call
[1:57:53] me Naomi anymore. Call me Mara. My life
[1:57:56] is so bitter."
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; That was her human part. That's what was
[1:58:00] being written in the book of life, the
[1:58:03] record of her life.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Until
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Boaz
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; interjects her pathway.
[1:58:12] And this is what you find. This is what
[1:58:14] he said to her.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Very brief. Boaz in his redemption. He
[1:58:21] says to her, his first word, hearest.
[1:58:26] And that word is obey.
[1:58:29] Do what I say.
[1:58:32] Hearest thou not my daughter.
[1:58:35] Go not. This is when he came to you. He
[1:58:38] told you right away. Go not into another
[1:58:41] field.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go hunting in another
[1:58:44] place. Stay here in my field and you'll
[1:58:47] find every answer.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying this church, but in this
[1:58:53] field, in this message, in this field,
[1:58:55] you'll find every answer.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Neither go from hence. Do not go from
[1:59:03] hence. Some of you here have tried
[1:59:05] another place. You've tried the field of
[1:59:07] the world. You've tried the field of
[1:59:09] just uh you know a life that's
[1:59:11] non-committed. You've tried the field of
[1:59:13] you tried a sin. You tried pleasures.
[1:59:16] You try something else. Don't go into
[1:59:18] that
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; It'll be different after this service.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I call God to witness.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Don't go into another field
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; and don't go from hemps.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:59:35] And then he said, "But abide here fast
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; by my maidens."
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Let your eyes be on
[1:59:47] the field that they do reap, and go thou
[1:59:50] after them, but I I
[1:59:53] have I not charged the young men that
[1:59:55] they shall not touch thee."
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; When thou art to thirst, go to the
[2:00:00] vessels and drink of what the young men
[2:00:02] have drawn. It hath fully been showed
[2:00:05] me. This is Boaz speaking. This is
[2:00:09] Christ speaking. It hath been fully
[2:00:12] showed me all that thou hast done unto
[2:00:15] thy mother-in-law since the death of
[2:00:17] thine husband. And how thou hast left
[2:00:20] thy father and thy mother in the land of
[2:00:22] thy nativity, and are come unto a people
[2:00:25] which thou knowest not hereto for. And
[2:00:28] the Lord recompense. Now you see her
[2:00:31] book
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. stop to be written.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; You won't find in here anymore.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a poor widow.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything worth living for.
[2:00:42] You won't find it now because bull ass
[2:00:45] is writing the book.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Pray with me.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Bull ass took the pen in hand. Said
[2:00:53] since I interrupted your life, I'm going
[2:00:55] to write it.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to write something different
[2:00:58] than you have been.
[2:01:00] I said this morning, don't write your
[2:01:02] don't write the story of your life. Let
[2:01:04] Boaz write it.
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And he says, "The Lord recompense all of
[2:01:13] your work. Thy work and a full reward be
[2:01:16] given thee of the Lord God of Israel
[2:01:19] under whose wings thou art come to
[2:01:21] trust." And Boaz said unto her, "At meal
[2:01:25] time, come thou hither, and eat of the
[2:01:27] bread, and drip thy and dip thy morsel
[2:01:31] into the vinegar." And you know that.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[2:01:38] That was it.
[2:01:40] And she goes back to her mother-in-law
[2:01:42] and says, "Look,
[2:01:44] she says, "Where you been? I've been in
[2:01:46] Boaz's field, the Old Testament, was
[2:01:48] mother-in-law, the Old Testament.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; We won't find it in the New Testament.
[2:01:51] That's why the prophet had to go back to
[2:01:52] the Old Testament
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; when he's coming to opening the seals.
[2:01:55] He had to go back
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; to go back to the book of Ruth which is
[2:02:00] the Old Testament which is Naomi
[2:02:02] Orthodox Church. He had to go there to
[2:02:03] interpret what was happening.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And so he's telling us plainly he goes
[2:02:09] back there to tell us Boaz.
[2:02:13] And now Boaz takes it and begins to
[2:02:15] write a different story to her. Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And she goes to her mother-in-law in the
[2:02:20] Old Testament and that's where the
[2:02:22] picture is and says go and find the
[2:02:25] place where he lay.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Now prophet come and says find the place
[2:02:29] where he lay.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Find the place we laid at Calvary. Find
[2:02:32] the find the place. Find it. Not a few
[2:02:36] words. Find the place.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; You ever could see if you could see him
[2:02:43] this morning. If you could see him
[2:02:45] becoming savior, if you could just see
[2:02:47] him for a moment, you'll never forget
[2:02:50] that vision.
[2:02:51] [Applause]
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; You can just hear him open his mouth.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Forgive them.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; You find the place.
[2:03:08] Ruth doesn't write anything from then
[2:03:10] on. She's done writing.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; The book of life is finished. Now it's
[2:03:14] become the redeemer's book. Become
[2:03:16] Boaz's book. And Boaz and she lays there
[2:03:20] and and and he he sees this woman there
[2:03:23] at midnight and he tells her what to do
[2:03:25] and everything else. And from then on
[2:03:27] then the women come in and Boaz comes
[2:03:30] and there's a secret. There's an
[2:03:31] invisible union
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; of the bride and the bridegroom. And it
[2:03:36] takes another company. Now all the
[2:03:38] people, the maidens aren't there and the
[2:03:39] young men aren't there and all the
[2:03:41] reapers aren't there. Nobody's there.
[2:03:43] It's just her and him.
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; And there's no more secrets.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; She becomes his wife.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; And she conceives
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; and brings forth Oed.
[2:03:58] Hey friends.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; This was the plan of God.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; This was the master plan.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't know. And here we are,
[2:04:06] hence many hundreds of years down the
[2:04:08] road. But how do you know if time should
[2:04:10] go go on? what's on down the road. And
[2:04:12] if you don't know, and if there is no
[2:04:14] more time and we're raptured this
[2:04:15] afternoon or tomorrow, then in eternity,
[2:04:18] we'll find out what our life meant and
[2:04:20] what God called us to do in this day and
[2:04:23] age. I can tell you it's a short work.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; That God is doing. And he called you for
[2:04:28] a purpose.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; He called us for a purpose.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And if this next week,
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; if this next week a soul is born again
[2:04:38] of the spirit of God and delivered, if
[2:04:40] one soul here, even a born again child
[2:04:43] of God, if they were set free this
[2:04:45] morning and delivered, I would say all
[2:04:47] the labor has been born.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:04:53] you don't want to write any more of your
[2:04:54] book.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; You want Boaz, you want the Kent
[2:04:58] believer to write his portion.
[2:05:00] Hallelujah. And you know what he will
[2:05:02] tell you? He will tell you that he's
[2:05:04] pregnantated you with his seed.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Number one, he will tell you that you're
[2:05:08] bringing forth a royal lineage.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't even know what
[2:05:13] you're bringing forth. He will tell you
[2:05:15] you're bringing forth Jesus Christ.
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Would we look down on that for a moment?
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Not for a moment.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Could I possibly out of this humanity
[2:05:31] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; I say to you,
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; drop the pen. Drop the pencil.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Just say it's over to you, Lord.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to write and give me
[2:05:46] eyesight
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; so I can see
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; and discern between
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; deity
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; and humanity. Right.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. between the book of life and
[2:05:59] the lamb's book of life.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Grace, grace,
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; marvelous grace.
[2:06:13] All we can do today is rejoice. Lord,
[2:06:15] the people have been so encouraging.
[2:06:17] They have been so respectful.
[2:06:21] And father, it's not just that, but I
[2:06:25] feel somehow your word has penetrated,
[2:06:31] penetrated
[2:06:33] deep, maybe even deeper than some care
[2:06:36] to realize,
[2:06:39] but you have penetrated very deep.
[2:06:42] You're saying to some
[2:06:44] who have not when they walked in here
[2:06:46] did not feel like perhaps a son or a
[2:06:48] daughter.
[2:06:50] But you have said to them through your
[2:06:51] word today, you are my son.
[2:06:56] You're my daughter.
[2:06:58] You are my child.
[2:07:01] Oh God,
[2:07:04] I'm asking that there be an atmosphere
[2:07:07] that will take over now in this service.
[2:07:12] And may we join with the songwriter,
[2:07:15] mercy
[2:07:17] regrow my life
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; for that is the truth, Lord. and myself
[2:07:22] in front of these people today. I want
[2:07:25] to thank you for the degree of mercy
[2:07:29] that you've extended to myself
[2:07:31] personally and to others that I have sat
[2:07:34] down with. Lord, you've extended mercy
[2:07:37] to this congregation.
[2:07:39] And in the midst of a very vile and
[2:07:41] violent and vulgar and evil time, you
[2:07:45] have brought us and washed us. Oh, I'm
[2:07:48] so glad we're not
[2:07:51] so glad we're not part of this world
[2:07:53] sin.
[2:07:55] Oh, God.
[2:07:58] Thank you for that. You've delivered us
[2:07:59] from it.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, you'll do your
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; do your work that we cannot do any
[2:08:06] longer. Take over now
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. I pray you'll take
[2:08:10] over.
[2:08:12] bring to a full repentance those that
[2:08:14] need to repent
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; and let them know God by the preaching
[2:08:18] of the word today that if they will
[2:08:21] simply confess and yield and agree then
[2:08:25] you will do the rest you're waiting
[2:08:28] waiting to do this for them Lord I pray
[2:08:32] for those that may be struggling along
[2:08:33] the way and having a hard battle I ask
[2:08:36] oh God that they will see today that
[2:08:39] everything heaven is worth it all
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; eternal eternal life is worth it all.
[2:08:44] And when this short life is through, you
[2:08:46] have promised us eternal life, eternal
[2:08:48] bliss, and eternal joy.
[2:08:51] In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit
[2:08:54] the words that have been spoken to you
[2:08:56] now.
[2:08:58] Thank you, Father. Continue now by the
[2:09:01] Holy Spirit. Continue. I pray
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:07] like to have you stand and sing with me.
[2:09:09] Mercy reroll my life.
[2:09:14] Mercy
[2:09:16] re
[2:09:18] my
[2:09:23] mercy
[2:09:26] ruled
[2:09:28] my life.
[2:09:33] I should have fallen.
[2:09:37] My soul
[2:09:40] cast down
[2:09:43] mercy
[2:09:45] re
[2:09:47] my life
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:53] mercy
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:56] my
[2:10:00] broke your mind
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:06] my
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:11] I should have fallen.
[2:10:15] My soul
[2:10:18] cast
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:25] my life.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; And that is why I love him.
[2:10:30] And that
[2:10:32] is why
[2:10:34] I love him.
[2:10:37] to him now because
[2:10:41] he works
[2:10:44] [Applause]
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:50] [Applause]
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:11:03] now.
[2:11:05] as he
[2:11:08] is.
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:16] [Applause]
[2:11:20] Oh, what a sign
[2:11:24] for sinners.
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:28] My Jesus.
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; The last line of this chorus says, "What
[2:11:38] a sight for sinners." I had a whole
[2:11:41] series
[2:11:44] of scriptures
[2:11:46] and I was going to preach this morning.
[2:11:49] I saw him
[2:11:51] and as I studied God turned the whole
[2:11:54] subject around
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; but I extended that and I'm closing with
[2:12:00] this. I want to leave you with this
[2:12:02] thought. You need desperately to see him
[2:12:07] in you that
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; you need discernment to determine
[2:12:13] between the human part
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; and that deity part. You must have that
[2:12:20] deserve that. But thirdly, very
[2:12:23] important,
[2:12:26] I read and I had a number of scriptures
[2:12:29] and the Bible says, "And when they saw
[2:12:31] him and when he saw them saw him, and
[2:12:35] when she saw him and I read those and
[2:12:38] those that received something from him,
[2:12:41] please let me give you a secret. those
[2:12:44] that got something from him
[2:12:48] are those and it it's the same every
[2:12:51] time. And when I saw him
[2:12:55] and when she saw him, she fell at his
[2:12:57] feet
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; and she received it. And when he saw
[2:13:01] him,
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; he fell at his feet
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; and he received what he asked for.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees saw him and they said,
[2:13:09] "Who is this?" And they trying to figure
[2:13:12] him out, trying to reason him up. Don't
[2:13:14] do that. Don't try and figure the
[2:13:15] service out this morning. Don't try to
[2:13:17] figure out the message. Don't try to
[2:13:18] figure out the grace of God. My my
[2:13:20] admonishment to you today is see him.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; See him in yourself. Say him in your
[2:13:26] parents. Say him in your children.
[2:13:28] Whatever you do, see him in the
[2:13:29] ministry. Whatever you do, you'll give
[2:13:31] me the greatest honor today. If you say,
[2:13:33] "I love brother. I saw Christ."
[2:13:36] Yes, sir.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's what I think was that great
[2:13:40] happening down in Ohio at the meeting
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; when a woman after the service I was
[2:13:47] just speaking on expressing Christ and
[2:13:50] she's in the back in another room
[2:13:53] talking to a woman in a wheelchair.
[2:13:56] The woman in the wheelchair says, "I see
[2:13:59] Christ in you." Says, "If you see Christ
[2:14:02] in me, stand up out of that wheelchair
[2:14:04] and walk." and a woman that hadn't taken
[2:14:05] a step for two years stood up and walked
[2:14:08] out of that room and all the way down to
[2:14:09] the front of the church and worshiped
[2:14:11] God for I don't know how long a time I
[2:14:13] wasn't even in the service and it it was
[2:14:16] after most of people had left. Tell you
[2:14:18] what, friends, the key to that was the
[2:14:21] key to that step was that she saw Christ
[2:14:24] in that moment.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I need something." Maybe
[2:14:30] what you need to do first is see Christ
[2:14:32] in yourself. Separate the humanity from
[2:14:34] the deity. Seek grace in the next
[2:14:37] person. See Christ in him in the street.
[2:14:39] Stop seeing the human part.
[2:14:42] The human part is failure. The human
[2:14:44] part will continue to fail. But the
[2:14:46] deity will never fail.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; When you see him, you'll never be the
[2:14:59] same.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why I love him. Let's lift it
[2:15:03] up to him again. And we're going to
[2:15:04] close now. And
[2:15:10] I love
[2:15:12] [Applause]
[2:15:22] to
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:30] be Oh
[2:15:34] my
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:39] [Applause]
[2:15:41] Christ
[2:15:42] is finished.
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:52] [Applause]
[2:15:55] Oh
[2:15:59] for s
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:02] my Jesus.
[2:16:10] Oh, what a sight
[2:16:15] for sinners.
[2:16:19] My Jesus
[2:16:22] brings
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:28] [Applause]
[2:16:31] for sinners
[2:16:35] my Jesus.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; God willing. Amen. We'll see you all
[2:16:46] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a supernatural time.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; I feel it in my heart. I know it's the
[2:16:57] truth.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; God's promise. Come expecting anything
[2:17:00] and everything.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Are you an expectation?
[2:17:05] [Applause]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; I don't think it'd be wrong to say,
[2:17:11] "Well, let's go and get raptured."
[2:17:14] What's wrong with that?
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; And what are you expecting? Well, I'm
[2:17:17] expecting rapture. Let's go and get
[2:17:19] raptured.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, come and dismiss us in
[2:17:24] prayer. Would you please
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah?
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, what did we see this morning?
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; We saw Christ.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; A songwriter once pinned. Beautiful
[2:17:41] Christ,
[2:17:43] king of my life is he. And so Lord, as
[2:17:48] Moses turned aside to see the burning
[2:17:50] bush.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; That was wonderful.
[2:17:54] But the glorious part, you saw Moses
[2:17:57] turn aside.
[2:17:58] And Father, we have gathered this
[2:18:00] morning, but you've seen us gathered.
[2:18:02] And I pray God that your glory would
[2:18:05] attend our way, Lord, as you did Moses
[2:18:08] that day. May Lord all we sense is the
[2:18:11] word, the presence of God. Go with us in
[2:18:14] a special way. We feel uncctioned this
[2:18:17] morning by the word of God. Lord, deal
[2:18:20] with our young people. Deal with our
[2:18:23] children. Deal with our families. Lord,
[2:18:26] let the glory of God settle down. We've
[2:18:29] turned aside to see none other than
[2:18:32] Jesus Christ, the living word. Go with
[2:18:35] your children. Bless your servant.
[2:18:38] strengthen the man of God this morning.
[2:18:41] Lord God, we're so thankful for the
[2:18:43] vessel. We pray that that word will
[2:18:45] continue to thunder forth changing lives
[2:18:49] by the word of God. Speak to the sinner
[2:18:52] this morning. May they turn aside and
[2:18:55] may they say Jesus Christ the living
[2:18:59] word. Bless your children. Go with us
[2:19:02] now. We love you. We thank you for your
[2:19:05] presence. We thank you for your
[2:19:07] dealings. Go with us now. We pray in
[2:19:10] Jesus name.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; I really feel like God just touching my
[2:19:19] heart while brother Thomas preaching or
[2:19:21] praying.
[2:19:23] There may be somebody here. I'm going to
[2:19:26] just open up this altar. Those of you
[2:19:28] that have to leave, you'll leave very
[2:19:30] quietly, respectfully, and don't speak
[2:19:33] in the foyer, please. It's nice outside.
[2:19:36] You go to the fellowship room. But if
[2:19:38] you somebody here says, you know,
[2:19:42] I want Boaz. I need Jesus Christ to come
[2:19:44] and rewrite my life. I need deity to
[2:19:48] take over.
[2:19:49] I need deity to dominate my life. I need
[2:19:52] to yield. I need to surrender. I need to
[2:19:55] give myself. It's one thing to hear the
[2:19:57] word. It's another thing to act on it.
[2:20:01] The Bible says he confirmed his word
[2:20:03] with signs following. I'd like to see
[2:20:05] the supernatural take place. I'd like to
[2:20:08] see sin's chains and bombs dropped to
[2:20:12] the earth. Like to see men and women,
[2:20:14] whoever, young people, children, whoever
[2:20:16] they might be. Going to ask you if you
[2:20:18] wish to come, we're going to sing Mercy
[2:20:20] Rewrote my life. And if you want and
[2:20:23] need and have that need in your life,
[2:20:25] don't delay another moment. Don't listen
[2:20:29] to the devil's lie. Tomorrow will not be
[2:20:32] easier. The camp will not necessarily be
[2:20:35] easier. Do it while God's voice is
[2:20:38] speaking. Then I'm going to have brother
[2:20:40] Dier come and pray a prayer over
[2:20:43] everyone that's standing and coming to
[2:20:45] expect from him. And we're going to sing
[2:20:47] the song once more. And it's good for
[2:20:49] you. say, "What good does it do for me
[2:20:51] to step forward or come an alter call is
[2:20:54] an old-fashioned old-fashioned
[2:20:56] denominational thing." Brother Brandham
[2:20:58] had them right up to the end as well.
[2:21:00] And I feel led to do that. There's
[2:21:02] nothing holy or sacred, but sometimes
[2:21:04] people need to move out of the seat, out
[2:21:06] of your comfort zone where you're
[2:21:08] sitting. And by acknowledging, I have a
[2:21:11] need in my life. And I believe that I
[2:21:14] want to confess and testify that God has
[2:21:16] spoken to my heart and to my soul. And I
[2:21:20] want the second thing to be a witness
[2:21:22] that I have. I'm coming now believing
[2:21:25] that God's going to meet my need. And
[2:21:27] I'd like to ask this congregation, how
[2:21:29] many would be praying with them and for
[2:21:30] them as well. Let's sing together. Mercy
[2:21:34] rewrote my life. And if you must go, you
[2:21:36] got an appointment or something, fine.
[2:21:38] You're dismissed in Jesus name. Or you
[2:21:40] may be seated after we sing, whatever
[2:21:43] you feel led to do. But whatever you do,
[2:21:45] just mind the Holy Spirit. Maybe you're
[2:21:49] just going to come and say, "I want to
[2:21:50] see him. I want to see him in a way. I
[2:21:52] need to see him. I need him to move and
[2:21:55] work in my life just now.
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:00] Mercy.
[2:22:10] Mercy
[2:22:12] re my
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:19] should
[2:22:22] my soul
[2:22:24] cast down
[2:22:27] my mercy
[2:22:30] re
[2:22:31] my
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:37] mercy
[2:22:40] roll my life.
[2:22:43] my life. Oh mercy
[2:22:48] re my
[2:22:55] should
[2:22:58] my soul
[2:23:00] press down
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:07] my life. Let's just move up a little
[2:23:10] closer if you can make room for some
[2:23:12] more that are coming. Oh mercy
[2:23:17] re my
[2:23:23] mercy
[2:23:26] re my
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:33] should
[2:23:36] my soul
[2:23:38] [Applause]
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:41] mercy
[2:23:49] Getting ready for prayer now. More are
[2:23:51] coming.
[2:23:53] And notice every word of this. All that
[2:23:57] I have, all that I am,
[2:24:00] all that I am.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Prayer is a prayer.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; All that.

[2:25:19] it once again.

[2:26:00] throughout the building, enter into
[2:26:01] prayer now. you that are standing in
[2:26:03] your seats, you enter into prayer.
[2:26:05] Either pray for yourself or pray for
[2:26:07] someone standing here. Going to ask our
[2:26:09] brother Dia to come and pray. I'm asking
[2:26:12] that he will get into the channel of the

[2:26:44] Don't abuse him. But just say, "Come,
[2:26:47] Lord Jesus. Touch my heart only the way
[2:26:50] that you can. No one else can touch me
[2:26:52] like you do. Just come and touch me,
[2:26:54] Lord. Oh, touch us
[2:26:59] from the iniquities.

[2:27:12] Lord,
[2:27:14] for your inviting presence that is in

[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; For you have stopped us, oh God, in this
[2:27:21] hour. Father,
[2:27:23] how we heard of Jacob
[2:27:26] wrestling with you and desires not to
[2:27:29] let you go until you had blessed him
[2:27:32] until he had seen you face to face. But
[2:27:36] this morning we feel as though you're
[2:27:37] the one, Father. We reach down your hand
[2:27:41] and say, "I will not let you go." You
[2:27:44] held us beyond the dismiss of prayer for
[2:27:47] your intent, oh God, and I see your face
[2:27:49] today. Father, we believe that is your
[2:27:52] doing. Oh God, we recognize the moment

[2:28:08] himself intent to deliver our lives,
[2:28:11] intent to let himself come into a very
[2:28:14] precious Lord that we can experience the
[2:28:17] supernatural and against you. Oh God,
