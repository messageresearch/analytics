[Music] Heavenly Father, we want to adore you this morning. Lord, you came many years ago. [Music] You changed the schedule for many of the believers and even angels and even the shepherds and changed the schedule for Mary and that day when the angel visited her. Lord, you've changed our lives. You've changed our schedules. You've changed our whole lives. And you've rearranged them. And you came on the scene. Angels have visited us, given us messages from above, of salvation, of forgiveness, of deliverance, of healing. We receive those angels, God. We We want to adore you for what you've spoken to us, not 2,000 years ago, but in our day, in our hour, we've heard messages from above. on the wings of your presence. You came into our lives in so many ways. For many it was a shock. For many was it was surprise. For all of us it was divine. This morning we want to worship you, Father. Not as a baby but as a man, as our husband, Christ the word. You've been so wonderful to us in our marriage life. You've taken care of us. You've touched us. We don't want to just speak of the blessings, but we want to speak of the life we have with you. So wonderful, so supernatural. Lord, we as Mary, as Elizabeth, as Zacharias, so many of the believers, we feel humble. We feel small. We feel inadequate. But Lord, it doesn't change the call. It doesn't change you speaking to us. We want to rise out of our our minds. We want to rise out of our own thoughts. We want to worship you, King of Kings. This one whose kingdom there shall never be an end. This one that has risen, Lord, out of eternities and has called us as men and women to stand by your side as your elected lady. We worship you this morning. We give our adoration. Our words, Lord, back to you must be words of of praise and words of of beautiful words of life. Wonderful words we've heard, God. We've come to adore you this morning. Ga, not gathered in a stable, not gathered in a little house, but gathered in your house. This is the house of praise. This is the pinnacle of our lives. Uh the pinnacle of our week, Lord. We look forward to this place of your presence that we can come and let off the pressure. We can come and adore your name. We can let all the the world do what they're doing. But Lord, your bride is has another attraction. There's an attraction in Bethlehem. Your word has been wonderful, Lord. And we're opening up our hearts to you, God. Letting our tradition, letting our own thoughts pass away, letting our own over the years, Satan would want to build up in all of our lives and in our families certain things that would be different than what you have had. But Lord, this is your family. We are your family. So you have the right to change our thoughts. Change our attitudes. Change the way we approach you. God, it's not too late. Father, you're building a perfect lady that a mature lady that's getting ready to leave this place. So Lord, we give you access to our hearts this morning. We give you access to our bodies, Lord. There's afflictions among us. There's bodies that have needs, Lord. Our brother Snow there in Phoenix, Lord, has suffered. over the years with this uh infirmity in his feet. Father, Lord, I pray that you would touch our brother Snow. Oh God, bring relief to this condition that he has. Oh, Father, may you touch our brother Snow, God. Other hands are lifted up all over the building. God, we're a needy people, but we believe we're in the right place. This is the right time. Missing limbs would be put back. touch our brother Bob Zacharuk, Lord, suffering from these shingles. Oh God, other needs that we're not aware about, some we hold in our hearts. Lord, I pray you'd go into the families, go into the sisters, the brothers, unspoken requests, loved ones that need a help. God, there's families and even individuals in this building that need divine intervention. God, shake away, Lord, anything in our lives that would be in laziness or anything that would be standing on the sidelines. We want to get into the action. Oh God, we want to be on the front row as it were. Even if we're in the balcony or out in the internet or in the nursery, let our hearts be magnetized to the spirit of Christ. You want to speak this morning. You want to move, oh God. You want to move supernaturally. Use our pastor, God. Use this whole day, God, to write upon the tables of our heart, word of God, ever true, changing our lives, changing one another. Oh God, I pray you'd be divine and special this morning. Speak to us in a mighty way. God, let there be spontaneous praise as you inspire us, oh God. Oh, even a few years ago when your prophet was here, it was in this time of the year that you inspired words to come that were so powerful, so true, God, of this season of the year. I pray you'd inspire us again and again. Let it be wave upon waves, oh God, of of divine inspiration, changing lives that are backsliding and bringing them back home. Lives that are filled with lethargy, just taking all those chains off of us. Even yet while we hear the word that people would be healed under your divine presence as the doctor is in this morning, the great physician is here. Oh God, the savior is here, the counselor is here, the mighty God is here. Father, we give you access to areas of our lives that we need help in our spiritual lives and physically, emotionally. You are everything to us. So just move in every way, God, and may divine things happen. Lord, we just feel a freedom this morning, a liberty to honor you in first place, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. We throw down our hearts, God. We bless your holy name. Thank you, Lord, for what you're going to do in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may be seated. [Music] We want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. If you're here this morning and you're a visitor, we just want to extend a real warm welcome and uh say we're real happy to have you here. And a special welcome to our brother Isaac Laafontaine who's visiting with us back. God bless you, brother Isaac. thrill. Uh we're really happy to have you here. Um couple of announcements. Um Adam and uh Sarah Graham are happy to announce the birth of their daughter Gabriella Joy on Saturday the 17th 12:49 p.m. weighing 7 lb 6 o. Dad, mom, and baby are doing well. Amen. We're thankful for that. And um brother Ma Madden and uh Sister Alexandra are happy to announce the arrival of their new baby girl, Anna. It's a good name. And I I am going to have real trouble pronouncing her second name. Samukavi. I don't know. I'm sorry. I probably really butchered that one badly. Brother Madden. Uh she was born uh December 17th at 11:55 p.m. Six uh 10 lb 21 12 in long. Mom and baby are doing good. Doesn't say anything about Brother Madden. I assume he's doing good, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for these additions to the assembly. Um, a note here from Brother Richard Drake to remind everyone there is no Sunday school Sunday the 25th or January the 1st. Sunday school will resume resume on January the 8th. Um and uh as well we want to remember and be praying for um we've got change in services coming up uh Christmas Day which is Sunday. We're only going to have one service. It's 11:00 in the morning. Um, and as well, uh, we've got a service, a watch night service starting at, uh, 9:00 on Saturday night, December 31st. And then the Sunday service on January the 1st is going to be at 11:00, uh, in the morning. No evening service either Christmas Day or New Year's Day. Uh, we've got a ton of specials uh, lined up for uh, the watch night service. And uh I haven't talked to brother Jeremy about this, but if you are an adult uh or group of adults, you may not be singing. And we'll be contacting everyone. We're going to give priority to children and families. So, um it's always a family time and so if you're an adult and uh you're you're uh slated to sing, uh we may not be able to have room for you. We just got too many people. that happens when the church is the size that it is. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Looking for a wonderful time over this holiday season and uh we want to be praying for the services we're going to be having. I know it's always a time when people can uh spend time with loved ones and it's a good uh have a good opportunity to witness to them. Um we have a special this morning from our sister Melissa Snow and Sister Melissa is going to be playing the harp. Uh now this is again, you know, it says, "Praise him on the harp." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so you're going to be able to see scripture being fulfilled this morning by someone praising him on the harp, which we haven't had before here in the church. Now, you're going to have to be real quiet because I understand they're going to do this acoustically, which means they're not going to mic it. So you're going to have to be really quiet um and listen to it. Those of you who are hard of hearing, um just kind of close your eyes and meditate. Praise God. So, uh, as Sister Melissa comes and gets ready, let's, uh, sing together. I just want to please the Lord, be in his will in every way. [Music] I just want to please the Lord. in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. To hear him say, "Well done someday." Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. To hear say, "Well done someday. [Music] Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We're going to sing that. We're going to sing that song and we don't have any instruments play. Let's just uh stand and sing it with a harp. Whenever you're ready, Sister Melissa, you can. You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I see. You are my all in all. [Music] Seeking you as a precious jewel. I want the Holy Ghost to rule. You are my all. Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name, Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a second verse. Taking my sis, I bless your name. You are my all. When I fall down, you lift me up. When I am cry, you fill my cup. You are my all in all. Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is. &gt;&gt; Sing the chorus once again. Oh Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. Jesus, lamb of God. Worthy is your name. Jesus, lamb of God. Worthy is your name. Jesus lamb God. Worthy is your name. And we can say worthy is his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Melissa, thank you so much. God bless you. Some people can come into church and they just, you know, pick a little flute out of their pocket. The next person packs in a harp and that has to be done a day ahead of time. You you don't do that suddenly. But it's a sweet sound. I can imagine well imagine why David loved it and must have played it skillfully himself. But we're so thankful to the Lord for this day that we are living and are here today. Aren't you glad to be alive? &gt;&gt; Thankful to be free in the house of God. You can just worship him in spirit and in truth. And we want to worship him in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we appreciate each one of you that are here and having the church full. All those of you that are visiting, many of our people are away, believe it or not. They're visiting elsewhere with family and so on. And we pray that they will be a real light and a testimony as well. It's a a real opportunity, I believe, to show the Christ that is in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The true Christ. And I pray that you will be a blessing wherever you are amongst your friends and family, whatever more. I believe that we can be a very, very powerful light in this dark time that we're in. Amen. It was really uh nice to see our Steven Kemper come back &gt;&gt; and be with us and we we need to hear from him, but I'm sure that'll take probably a week. So, we'll have to try to get that condensed down, but he's had a very fruitful time. Said a time that'll never be forgotten. And uh I'm sure it'll be a blessing to all. So, we'll be able to hear something of of that as well. and what is taking place in Brazil. Well, I'd like to just maybe when we get ready to turn to the word now, we're going to turn to uh Micah the fifth chapter. But while you're turning, I'm going to also if we could sing, brother Rod, I'd like to sing we bless your name. And his name shall be called what? Jesus. His name shall be called Jesus. He'll be Emmanuel, but his name shall be called Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, sir. &gt;&gt; If that announcement hadn't been made, you wouldn't be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God for that announcement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. That was his purpose. &gt;&gt; And it's not an idol little piece of history. It's a reality today. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's sing it together. &gt;&gt; I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you. You are the truth. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; And together we bless your name. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. We bless your name. We give you praise. We bless your name &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Father, we are here today to bless your name. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have a service. Not here to celebrate a season of the year. Not here to listen to a man or to hear just singing. But we are here that you might be praised. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be exalted. &gt;&gt; And Lord, when your announcement, when the announcement was made, there was singing as your prophet said, the first Noel was sang by angels. How they sung and praised the name of Jesus Christ and how heaven broke loose at the very at the very thought, the very beginning of redemption. And oh God, I pray that today you'll cause all of these things to be a reality to us. I pray that every heart will be loosed, Lord. And that true praise will be within our hearts to you. I pray that you will make known your word. Reveal yourself to us in this time, oh God. We're not here to study history. We're here to speak of a Christ that's living amongst his people, doing things, doing for he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Pray you'll anoint me, oh Lord, the people. And may this be a time that'll be pleasing in your sight. That's all that we desire in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. We're reading uh just out of Micah 5 and 2 and then I'll read out of Matthew the 2 chapter. Micah 5 and2. But thou Bethlehem Ephraa, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth, have been from old, from everlasting. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can keep your finger in in Mike if you would because you'll be turning back to it in just a moment. And then we will read from Matthew the 2 chapter and starting at the first verse. Just reading down to verse six. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him." Then Herod the king, When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah? For out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel. May God bless his word to us. You have your saints. If you have kept your Bible open there to Micah, the the original Hebrew. I would like to just read from the original Hebrew because it is uh the Hebrew reads like Chinese does from left to right. I'm sorry, from right to left. And uh uh and then they have it also double phrased the wording on top of each other. That is in the actual uh not necessarily Hebrew language, but in the in the Hebrew that's being translated into English. And I'd like you just to follow these words. And thou Bethlehem Ephraa being least among the thousands of Judah, out of you, to me he shall come. Notice how beautiful that is. Out of you, to me he shall come forth to become to become one ruling in Israel. and his comingings forth. The English in the King James says his goings, but his comingings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity. Therefore, therefore he will give them over until the time the one giving birth has given birth. That's different from, you know, just slightly different. The emphasis is different. Therefore, he will give them over until the time the one giving birth has given birth. Then the rest of his brothers shall return to the sons of Israel. And he shall stand and pasture us in the strength of Jehovah. Isn't that marvelous? And he shall stand and pasture us. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God. I love that verse. And he shall stand and pasture us. I say, oh God, pasture us this morning. &gt;&gt; Feed us in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah, his God. Amen. Bethlehem, house of bread, house of food. That is what the name means. And brother Brandham went into it in more depth. It took it Bethlehem, the house of God's bread. And it certainly was the house of God's bread. Now, Bethl, he spelled it as Bethl, but Bethlehem, house of bread, house of food. But it became of course the house of God's bread because Jesus Christ was born there. Though you are small, though it was insignificant, though it was unimportant in the eyes of the world, the scripture says, "Yet out of thee." There's a lot of that God takes that's very insignificant. Jeffersonville wasn't very important. &gt;&gt; It's on the lips of millions of people only because of one thing because a word proceeded from there. Otherwise, it would be unknown. What's Cloverdale? Who ever heard of Cloverdale? But it is on the minds of a lot of people and is heard by a lot of people. One of the things Brother Steven Keer just said to me and we only had a few moments but he said we we went into into the jungles of Brazil. He said we went where I thought we're to the end of the world said just to see some few believers there. He says, "You get around them and say, "Oh, when you get back, you know, greet brother Ed and greet the saints." And it just blew him away. How they didn't even know that these people could be connected with the rest of the world. But, you know, it's an amazing it's amazing connection that we have in the body of Christ. Just an amazing connection that we have. But God does things in uh uh he he does things in a way that is not you know glamorous in some great way. He does things in a very simple way. And so yet out of thee, and thou Bethlehem, though you're least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a a a governor that'll rule his people. Though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee. And because of that phrase, there's no way to stop it. God doesn't need a lot of words to say something yet out of thee. And that was it. It was going to happen. It doesn't take it doesn't take God a whole lot of uh explaining to do. He doesn't have to. Bethlehem, I want to make just a few statements now because they're going to be important throughout the service. Bethlehem was the ultimate converging of the natural lineage and the spiritual promise which God made regarding redemption, regarding salvation. It was the ultimate converging of those two because now we had according to the lineage Jesus Christ being born and it gives the lineage in Matthew and also in Luke and yet he was virgin born as far as the flesh is concerned there's no tie to the natural lineage but yet God attributed it to Abraham through David and a lot of other people in between, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There had to be an unbroken lineage. Now, that to me has always been almost mysterious that it was so critical, and we'll touch on Judah after a little bit. And Tamar, how critical it was that Judah's line should continue because Jesus had to be born of the line of the tribe of Judah. It had to be an unbroken line. It could not be broken. And yet the flesh man, he was virgin born. Had nothing to do with that actual flesh seed going on down. But it had to go down because God was attributing his son to that lineage. &gt;&gt; And it could not be broken. &gt;&gt; It was it was just as important as anything else. It had to be that way. And the and the the the second was the spiritual promise because God promised I think Abraham is the best example. God promised Abraham, you'll have a son. You're going to have a son. Even though he had Ishmael, that's not the son. You're going to have a son by promise. &gt;&gt; I'm giving it to you. And the one that comes as a product of my promise, that will be the son. And that son came by a natural seed. Isaac came by natural seed. But what was in God's mind was his son coming. And he was giving his his friend, his father in the faith, a son by a natural seed. When it was long past his ability to do so, long past the ability of his wife to conceive. When it was impossible, God gave it to prove it was by promise. that it was not by his own efforts. God has given us given you whatever you possess today spiritually. God has given it to you as a gift. Not because you did anything good, not because you're worthy of it. He did it because he loved you. And that's his promise. Because of his promise. And so in Bethlehem, we have the converging of this natural lineage which actually is only by promise. It's only by promise because God had to promise that lineage and attribute Jesus Christ to that lineage. I hope you can see that. But the second thing was that God had promised redemption. He had promised redemption. And so Christ is this unique person, God in the flesh. He was God, but he had a human body. He was born of a woman and he died on a cross. But God was in Christ, &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; He was God, very God. &gt;&gt; And he was man, very man. &gt;&gt; He got tired. He got thirsty. He got hungry. He prosperspired when it was hot. He was man. He was tempted in all points like we are and yet without sin. It had to be that unique being in order to pay the price &gt;&gt; for our sin. Why little Bethlehem? In that message, the prophet said, "Now we see this little Bethlehem yet being unnoticed." I'm coming to a very important phrase here. a little place not noticed too much by the outside world and just uh a smallest of the cities. Nobody paid any attention to it. But yet God in his purpose that there's there's where all these things would happen. And he said, "And the spiritual," now the spiritual mind would pick that up because the prophet said, "Thou Bethlehem of Judea, out of thee art, art thou not the least among the princes, but out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel?" And then he breaks in and says, "The prophet, the mind of the prophet found it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; It had not been written anywhere. The prophet spoke it, but where was it before the prophet spoke it? Where was that? But thou Bethlehem of Judea, who selected that city? Where was it selected? In the mind of God, a little insignificant place. God knew before the foundation of the world there'd be a city, a little place unnoticed. insignificant, unimportant, &gt;&gt; had no great heritage, had nothing to boast about. It was just a a humble, we could say it was the symbol of humility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that place, God chose that place. And so that's in the mind of God. And centuries go by and a prophet catches it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll tell you what friends, &gt;&gt; I don't care how great a person might be, how educated they might be. Unless unless that pro unless God sends a prophet, you will not find those things in the mind of God that God has reserved in his mind. Only a prophet can pick them up. &gt;&gt; God will reveal nothing except he reveals it first to his servants of prophets. That's exactly the way it is. And people today, they get in their high society and high fluting ways and and all of their theology and educating and all these things think they're going to bypass that. You'll never bypass that. &gt;&gt; You'll never discover it. You can study till you're till you're skin and bones. You can study till you don't have any brain cells left. You'll never discover these things. And the mind of the prophet caught it. &gt;&gt; Thank God he caught it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But thou Bethlehem of Judea, &gt;&gt; though thou art the least &gt;&gt; of the cities, yet out of thee, yet out of thee, yet out of thee, shall rise, &gt;&gt; a governor that will rule his people, Israel. &gt;&gt; Bethlehem, this symbol of humility. Now, it's it's startling really. It's troubling that what was once in the mind of God has been so glamorized today until what God thought is unrecognizable. &gt;&gt; We sing songs about it and all the rest of it, but the world takes what God finally uttered and what was in his mind. The prophet caught it, brought it down, wrote it in the book. Now the world gets a hold of it. The world polishes it up. And Bethlehem is not the insignificant place it once was. Bethlehem has been glamorized. And and you ought to see the structures that have been built and the church of the nativity and all of these gorgeous uh extravagance and places that have been built over where they feel Christ was born and and and he's not there. friends. &gt;&gt; It's not where he is. &gt;&gt; Today we say the celebration of Christ's birth is one of parties, revalry, &gt;&gt; extravagance, &gt;&gt; uh, consumerism, &gt;&gt; all the advertising, &gt;&gt; and the prophet uses the word brother Brandham uses often, tinsel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; tinsel &gt;&gt; is a showy decoration according to the encyclopedia. A showy decoration that is basically valueless &gt;&gt; tinsel, &gt;&gt; something that's showy, &gt;&gt; something that catches the eyes, &gt;&gt; something that catches the attention of the people, but is valueless. And he takes it not from just the commercial world but the prophet spells spends his most of time on what the church and the organized church has done with not only Christmas but with religion &gt;&gt; has taken the truth of God's word. This also this whole word was in God's mind at one time and and the prophets caught it &gt;&gt; and spoke it. It was scribed and written down and for the for the generations to have and the Holy Spirit came and reveals it in its season. &gt;&gt; But the mind of God can't get it. He gets what is he he he gets what should be the present and puts it in the past. He gets what's happening and things are still in the future. He doesn't know it's being fulfilled. And they go to all their all their training and all their theology and all this. Thank God that we're not under some theological system. Thank God that the prophet caught what was happening today. Spiritual food in due season. The mighty God unveiled. Now we're in the third exodus at this time. Thank God we know those things. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be terrible to be remaining in darkness? &gt;&gt; The mind of God catches it. But the but the world oh all the great systems be be you know gathering together and the ecumenical things and the great unions that are taking place and it's so glamorized. The gospel today has been so glamorized. It's just unbelievable. &gt;&gt; So glamorized. It's a show. Amen. &gt;&gt; TV evangelist show. &gt;&gt; Just one show after another. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; We're not here today for a show, friends. &gt;&gt; We're here to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A showy decoration that is basically valless. All the tinsel of self-promotion. That's what tinsel is. All the tinsel of self-promotion. And we think of really the way it came. He spoke in uh why little Bethlehem. I said why was it Bethlehem? Is my text today. Why was it Bethlehem? He refers to in the days of Noah. He chose a farmer. In the days of Moses, he took a runaway slave. David out of the backside of the field of the wilderness of the being a shepherd out in the shepherd with the sheep in the sheepyard, a ruddy, scrawny looking little boy. But as soon and when Samuel was sent to Jesse's house and the the elder brother came would have made a fine king. He looked good. He was the one that Samuel thought surely this is him. No, it wasn't him. Goes through all the sons. They're all gone. Is this all you have? Oh, yeah. No, we have another one. Little one. He's out in the sheepyard. He's with the sheep. the unrecognized one. &gt;&gt; The one that didn't carry himself like a king, &gt;&gt; a little boy with a slingshot. &gt;&gt; And he says, "As soon as David fell into the eyes of Samuel," I like the way he said that. As soon as David fell into the eyes of Samuel, he said the anointed prophet, he poured the oil upon his head and run to meet and said, "This is the one that God has chose." &gt;&gt; It's not tinsel always of the world. It's God's choosing. &gt;&gt; By grace, he chose you. By grace he chose me. &gt;&gt; Wasn't because we had any tinsel to offer, nothing fancy to present him, but just by grace. In fact is if we go back, no doubt you've said at some point in your life and experience, why did he choose me? &gt;&gt; There really wasn't anything there. And even to this day and even to this morning in prayer, I just said to the Lord, if it depended on if it depends on us as an individual, what do I have that you would even want? What do we have? I tell you then then it is as as Melissa played song Amazing Grace. How sweet is that sound &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch like me. &gt;&gt; And when we go back see our wretched lost state, we wonder why God even stooped down to save us. &gt;&gt; It was his choosing, &gt;&gt; his election, &gt;&gt; his predestinated plan, and outside of that there is no possibility. Hallelujah. This whole thing's of God. &gt;&gt; Man gets a hold of it and he makes it pretty, tries to, you know, make it fancy. And we have it everywhere. &gt;&gt; We have it absolutely everywhere. But he said God takes the simple things to identify himself through. And as brother Brandham refers and he was speaking that message in Phoenix speaking to the glamour of the church systems and how they had organized themselves around the source of the word and today in Israel there'll be great things happening around the church of the nativity and all those things and you can't even recognize what really the scriptures talked about. &gt;&gt; You go down to the shopping mall, you can't even recognize what it's all about. Right. &gt;&gt; And a lot of the churches within this country and whatever more, you wouldn't even be able to recognize what the true story is all about because they don't even want to take it. In our nations, Christian nation, Christian &gt;&gt; and deny you the right to. They don't want to even say Christmas. And even Christmas isn't a correct word. &gt;&gt; This is a birth of Christ. And we know he wasn't born at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even science will tell you that. But I won't bother getting into that. But the nations of the world are bending to the will of Rome itself &gt;&gt; and their desires at this time. &gt;&gt; Just a few days ago, the Palestinian leaders presented the pope, this present pope, with a passport from Bethlehem. And I'd like to just read how it took place. The Palestinian Authority turned to the Pope on Saturday to back a new Arab state with Jerusalem as its capital. And last week, the Palestinian Authority addressed the European unity, which ignores Jerusalem status as a unified Israeli city. And Muhammad Abbas, chairman of the Palestinian Authority, invited Pope Benedict to visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem after meeting with Italian officials on Friday. He asked them to host an international peace conference according to its Italian envoy, Nemer Hammad. And they said, and we quote, "You'll be very welcome." They said to the pope, "You'll be very welcome in Jerusalem and the holy places." Abus told the pope during a 20-minute private audience by specifically mentioning Jerusalem, which is under full Israeli control. Abbus was making a clear political statement. Abbus as part of a public relations effort to support its demand that Jerusalem be the capital of a new Arab state. He told the pope, "If we can't hold, notice this, if we can't hold democratic elections in Jerusalem, it will be difficult to do it in the other zones." So he's saying if you can't and all of these nations are supposed to be democratic. If we can't be democratic in Jerusalem they want to vote for democracy as to who rules the city. Notice how cunning that is. I don't know if you're catching that &gt;&gt; but that is a very very cunning. &gt;&gt; Actually many leaders have gotten in leaders who have taken nations down a wrong road but they got in by a vote. And you know what the prophet spoke about? The vote in America got to a woman's vote &gt;&gt; and voted the wrong man. &gt;&gt; And they go on to say the radio Palestinian Authority network reported that his holiness Pope Benedict received a Bethlehem passport. That's what I wanted to come to. received a Bethlehem passport from the president and it becomes he becomes the first new citizen of Bethlehem following the launch of open Bethlehem. A it was a launch of open Bethlehem and international campaign to save the city. And however, the Palestinian leader said that the document uh he said the document, he denied that the document was actually a passport, but the radio reported they gave the pope a passport. He'd be the first citizen of the new Bethlehem. I thought how perverted &gt;&gt; it can really become when the first citizen of Bethlehem was none other than Jesus Christ, the real citizen of Bethlehem. Why little Bethlehem? He said, "We see these types in the Philistine council of churches now organizing garrisons everywhere around our Bethlehem." Our Bethlehem, friends, is not a place of city, a city of of stones and bricks and mortar. That's not or the Church of the Nativity or any other building. Our Bethlehem is where the bread of God &gt;&gt; comes from. &gt;&gt; He says around this Christmas they're garrisoned around everywhere. It's all decorated up with worldly tinsel because the world had garrisoned and Satan is behind it. Garrisoned himself around the around the very source of the word. Believe it or not, look, you see the prophet actually uh being invited and being given opportunity to speak and people wanting just exactly like it was in the time of Jesus, wanting to hear his words and wanting to see the marvelous works and wanting to see some sign and yet garrisoning themselves, being garrisoned around so that it could not break out. They didn't want they didn't want the the gospel of Jesus Christ says, "Where is he that's born king of the Jews? Where is he?" So I might go right away. There's someone there to try to stamp it out &gt;&gt; immediately. They want to destroy it immediately because it's not a physical thing. It's a spiritual thing. And he says, "There it is today, Christmas again to keep us from the promise of the word, but it shall be fulfilled." And I want to say amen to that. It shall be fulfilled. Everything that's been spoken concerning our time shall be fulfilled. God's able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. God's able to do whatever he needs to do. He says, "And always trying to keep the real true Bethlehem dwellers away from eternal life." And that's their purpose. That's their intent. &gt;&gt; There is all kinds of intent today. I mean, I'm not just going to I'm not speaking about the little commercialization of of of Christmas. That's very small compared to what's really happening. Spiritually speaking, there's every demon in hell that wants to keep you from the word of God. Working through every possible device that he has available to him. He will use every possible means to keep you from the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Everything physically, emotionally, in every other way. &gt;&gt; He'll try to distract and try to uh h have us distracted off to something else. And so likewise, Bethlehem was in the promise of the prophecy. Why did he take why did he take Bethlehem? It seemed like there would have been greater places and better places. And brother Brandham talks about the cities of refuge, Ramoth Gilead and other cities and Jerusalem, the great proud capital. He said, "Why weren't they chosen? Why didn't God choose something uh you know that was perhaps more sophisticated and more organized and more set up and people more qualified to even take and send this message out. When I was with brother Brandham he said you know he had just been to Oral Roberts uh and visited him in Tulsa and he and he was just amazed. He said the the organization that they have and the system that they have and the great hospital and the prayer tower and all these things and and he just said he said I don't know what I'd do if I had that kind of thing to try to support and keep going. He says you should see my office and sometime later I've been in that office. It's a little desk, little chair. It's like Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look what come out of it. &gt;&gt; Look what come out of it. &gt;&gt; How many other messages I'm talking about? Not messages of of the message we have, but how many other sounds of voices is there today? And I go down the road and we may be listening to a tape and I just say, "How many how many ministers around the world have there been that are all gone now? They're gone. But how many are being listened to like this voice? How many are being listened to with such earnest, fervent minds and spirits? How many are so devoted and are receiving what we're receiving? I tell you what, friends. It's a great thing that God has done for us. &gt;&gt; Great thing that God has done. Brother Bram says, "Why wasn't it Shiloh? Why wasn't it Gilgal? Why wasn't it, you know, one of these other great places, the great proud capital, but it had to be Bethlehem of Judah. Now, I just want to go back a wee bit, and I appreciate your patience this morning. Joshua, in dividing up the land, he gave a little spot to Judah. I've got to go back to lay all of this foundation. gave a little spot to Judah and it was just a little place he said that they give to the tribe of Judah. Now he says try to catch this. That's what I'm asking you to do today. Just try to catch this. When Israel crossed over into the land, the promised land, just as they crossed over into the promised land, there was a gentile woman that we know as Rahab the harlot. She's connected with it right away. a gentile is connected with it. And she asked for mercy and she received it. &gt;&gt; She received mercy. She received mercy as long as she stayed under the scarlet cord, the token. And that's the only way she could have mercy. It was a sign, a token that was given her. And you and I have that token &gt;&gt; today. We have that sign, that token. And then this Rahab after she was she was spared, she got all her people in. Everything that was under the cord was saved. So I'd like to just make a statement now that the Gentile bride recognized the token and thus became inseparable from the act of redemption. She recognized the Gentile bride and I'm referring to this one now. recognized the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She recognized the token. She listened and heard heeded the call of the messengers. She recognized the token. She did what she was supposed to do with the token. And because of that, she herself personally became inseparable in the plan of redemption. She became involved and part of their whole redemptive process. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't lose that. &gt;&gt; If you have received by a supernatural act of God where he opens up the mind of the understanding and you have a a revelation by the Holy Spirit of God of the what the token is, not some chemistry 2,000 years ago, &gt;&gt; but a bleeding word today. Why is it bleeding? Because it's crucified again. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in the same world that crucified our Lord Jesus Christ. The word has always been hated, rejected, and that's why it had to be little Jerusale Bethlehem. God chose the insignificant place for there for the word to come forth. And where the word came forth, the word is just the word in flesh just barely coming. And right away there's a slaughter of the innocents. &gt;&gt; Right away he's having to flee. because it's always been rejected and hated. And when the prophet was speaking even in the why was it little Jerusalem or why was it little Bethlehem rather he's standing right there with such opposition &gt;&gt; right in the midst of opposition and he's saying and our Bethlehem today and they're garrisoned around it and trying to keep us from the word but it will come it will be fulfilled and even though he was with all of that opposition and all of that theology and all of the great doctors of divinity and all the rest of it. He knew &gt;&gt; that there'd be some gentile warriors that would rise up and cut through the enemy forces and bring the king a fresh drink of water. &gt;&gt; He knew it would happen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, friends, it brings great joy to the heart of our Lord Jesus. Not only to know that the price was paid and that he had faithful servants down through the generations and a faithful messenger at this time, but that a people would rise up &gt;&gt; as a result of that and say, "We are part. We are part of those gentile warriors. We're part. We have heard that word &gt;&gt; and we're committed to that word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This isn't some Sunday school picnic. This isn't some Christmas celebration. This is when real men and women have been called, I tell you, by a by a sovereign God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And see also she became inseparable. She became inseparable from redemption. Rahab did. And she became inseparable from Bethlehem. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's inseparable from Bethlehem because she became one named in Genesis in Matthew 1 and1. She became named in the first chapter of Matthew as one of the mothers of Israel &gt;&gt; that brought forth a lineage. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to stay with me. I told you I was going to I want to really get into it this morning. And please stay with me. And the prophet goes into it because he says, "And she stayed under that token." He says, "And then we understand by history that she courted." A lot of this, you know, but I need to have it in the in the for today's background. She courted some general in Israel's army and she finally married this man and they settled up here near this little place and her son uh her husband was Solomon and was the he was the one who founded Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Now we've got a a a gentile woman that was a harlot. Nothing to boast about. She has nothing to offer, nothing could to contribute. She hasn't. What has this horlet got to contribute to the lineage of Jesus Christ? Zero. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; But by God's choosing, &gt;&gt; God chose her. &gt;&gt; And and brought her in and merged her into the very lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you, the bread from heaven couldn't come uh without a an incredible display of mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you and I have to realize today we're seated here, if we are part of the real Bethlehem dwellers, we're seated here only because of mercy and grace has come to us. &gt;&gt; But she's an integral part &gt;&gt; of the lineage of Jesus Christ, a harlot woman. And we are an integral part of the bread of God that has come in this hour. Not merely recipients of it, but givers of it. &gt;&gt; That's where we're going to be coming to. &gt;&gt; We're not just receiving end. We're on the giving end. &gt;&gt; God has not called you just to be a receiver. Take it in. Take it in. Take it in. But we're givers of this &gt;&gt; bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he founded says, "And we find out that Solomon founded this little city of Bethlehem." Look where it had its beginnings. No wonder it's insignificant. &gt;&gt; Solomon happened to live there and married Rahab. &gt;&gt; The harlot. &gt;&gt; And they founded this place &gt;&gt; and it was given by Joshua to Judah. is right on the border in within Judah. It says, "And and Solomon founded the little city of Bethlehem, and he begat he begat Boaz. &gt;&gt; And Boaz was the one who married Ruth, another Gentile." &gt;&gt; This whole thing is inseparable from having a gentile bride. And I'm so thankful to God, my brothers, my sisters, that it's not just natural Israel that has us, but God gave access to us Gentiles and united us in. We're not an afterthought. &gt;&gt; We're not an afterthought. &gt;&gt; We're not hitchhikers. &gt;&gt; We're not somebody who just somehow found some after some favor, some benefit of God. But God in his mind, he's even before the very beginning, he knew that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he and when he even began the founding of the city, the founding of the place, he said to Joshua, he instructed him and under that leadership, you'll give it to Judah. &gt;&gt; And he give that little spot to Judah. &gt;&gt; And then and then what? And and then as they're coming into the land here, they run right into Rahab and the first thing to do is give her a token. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I hope you're catching it. And here she's given a token &gt;&gt; and she obeys it &gt;&gt; and she believes it. &gt;&gt; She has she has no evidence of of redemption yet. She has no evidence that there's any safety to it. She just believes the most foolish thing. It looks so foolish. You put this cord in the window, this red cord that's in your house. You put this in your window and somehow your house will be saved. When these walls fall down, &gt;&gt; you'll be preserved. And I can tell you today, not only the walls falling down, I think of the morality of this nation. I wonder how in the world you young people are going to survive. If it wasn't for the token, you wouldn't survive. There'd be no way to survive. How do you men and women survive with your families? How do you survive in this generation when everything's becoming fractured? Everything's becoming so so absolutely blown apart. How do you survive? Only because of the token you survive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say amen to God. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. by God's grace &gt;&gt; and his mercy to us. He gave the Gentile bride a token and she believed it. &gt;&gt; And the token could only come in evening time and in this evening time God sends his token, his word, his promise, and finds a gentile that believes it. &gt;&gt; Why do we believe it? We don't know why we believe it. We just believe it because a messenger said so. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This messenger wasn't just a spy, but God in the end times sent a prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And stands behind it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And there's never been duplicated. &gt;&gt; Never been duplicated. Not in the history of mankind. And the world will answer for it. &gt;&gt; What God sent in this day, &gt;&gt; the whole world will answer for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Those religious leaders will answer for it. &gt;&gt; Bishop Stanley who handed the Bible to him will answer for it. &gt;&gt; All the Christian businessmen will answer for it. &gt;&gt; And all those religious leaders that turn their people away from it will answer for it for turning their people away from the token. [Music] &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; You believe it. And why you believe the token, the revealed word of this day, &gt;&gt; we don't know why. You can't give explanation. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in Ruth 2 and 4, "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem." Boaz the kinsman redeemer attribute &gt;&gt; coming from Bethlehem. God way back in the book of Ruth saying clearly that my attribute of redemption, my kinsman redeemer will come out of Bethlehem &gt;&gt; cuz he's showing it back there because Boaz was the perfect type. He He acted out the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; And he redeemed Ruth, &gt;&gt; another gentile, a Moabitete, &gt;&gt; who has a very dubious history and background, &gt;&gt; having come from a nation that was birthed out of incest, &gt;&gt; an incestuous relationship, &gt;&gt; but God took her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, my brother, my sister, when God takes a person, didn't matter if it's a harlot, &gt;&gt; didn't matter whether it's a moabitete, they become perfect in God's sight. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Perfect in God's sight. &gt;&gt; And put their names in the lineage of Jesus Christ. Four out of the five women, only one of them was was the Virgin Mary, but the other four Tamar, &gt;&gt; Rahab, Ruth and Ba Sheba, which it says clearly in Matthew 1, the wife of Urias, &gt;&gt; who had been wife of Urias. And out of her came Solomon. And God took those four women and and and sold them and united them and merged them right into the lineage of Jesus Christ, mothers of Israel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No one can ever understand the grace of God. And so the attribute of of of the kinsman redeemer came out of Bethlehem. Boaz came from Bethlehem and he spoke to the reapers. Hallelujah. And the prophet said, "And Naomi representing the Orthodox church was went on the on the uh went on the way on account of a famine and went into the land of Moab like the scattering of Israel." Israel was completely scattered. and Naomi went into the land of Moab. The gentile church says that is that the gentile church coming to God just under the barley season because she returned with Ruth in the barley season. And he said it shows a gentile church coming to God just at the barley season. Listen friends, this move of God, this thing that God has drawn you by, this strange move of the spirit. Listen, I'd like you to just look at your own individual lives for a moment. Here you are sitting in a seat in this congregation, but where did you come from? &gt;&gt; Where did you come from? &gt;&gt; Where were you at one time? Where were you a few years ago? Where were you? And what did you believe? And what were you under? And what were you being held by? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what? You're being held by in darkness and in confusion and by sin and by habits and by demons of hell. &gt;&gt; And God loosed you. &gt;&gt; Divinely loosed you. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at some of you here and knowing you came into this church, came into this message bound, horribly bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people have been attracted to a lot of things, but God attracted you to a certain sound, a certain voice, &gt;&gt; a certain message. &gt;&gt; And that begin to feed your soul. &gt;&gt; And it goes on, it says, "And they came at the barley season." What a beautiful picture. And then she and Boaz being married and their famous son Oed was begotten there. And then his son Jesse his great son. Jesse came from Oed. And also he begat David his son the king David came out &gt;&gt; all in Bethlehem started from nothing started from started from Joshua going in with armies &gt;&gt; but he was anointed to place the tribes in a certain place and furthermore the prophet traces it further back and says that when those women the wives of the patriarchs when they were giving birth to the children and called out their name Ephraim &gt;&gt; was actually God inspiring that mother and placed that child's children in the land &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; it's a car &gt;&gt; Dan &gt;&gt; and here they were already being placed &gt;&gt; and out come a child Judah &gt;&gt; call him Judah and at that time even God at that I have the quote right here. God at that time giving that placing. It wasn't just wasn't just calling that child's name &gt;&gt; because when when uh when the father was dying now Jacob and he called his sons and he began to tell those sons where they would be &gt;&gt; and what they would do &gt;&gt; in their future life. &gt;&gt; And now here comes Joshua who's doing it. Same God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That called them and placed them. Same God now placing them. And Joshua places Judah in a certain spot &gt;&gt; where God knew in his mind there would come &gt;&gt; there would come Solomon. There would come Oed, Boaz, and Oed and Jesse and David and they would be born there because God in his mind had selected that place that here will be the house of my bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. here will be the house of God's bread. &gt;&gt; And David right here at this same little Bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of God to be the king of Israel. And all these spiritual things hid from the eyes of the world was happening here in this little city of Bethlehem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ was born. Now he goes on to say, "Christ was born in Bethlehem and became God's house of eternal life bread. He is the bread of life. He is our Bethlehem. Christ is our Bethlehem." &gt;&gt; Natural bread is called the staff of life. God Jesus is God's life staff. I love that &gt;&gt; Jesus is God's life staff, a bread of life staff for eternal life. And then he goes on, and this was a blessing to me, all true believing sons of God are born in Bethlehem &gt;&gt; with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Christ had to become the bread of life to be born in Bethlehem, which is life's bread house, then everyone of true believers in Christ is born in Christ, they are born in God's Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, &gt;&gt; then not only was Jesus born in Bethlehem, he said, I was born in Bethlehem. And you were born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; How did you do it? Right here in Phoenix, he said, "Right here in Phoenix, Arizona." This morning in the Raada, you can be born again in God's Bethlehem house of eternal bread, life, eat it, and live forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I hope I'm able to convey this without recognizing or I will say it's absolutely essential absolutely essential to recognize the vessel that God had chosen to use here. Brother Brandham is saying to these people right here in Phoenix, Arizona this morning. Here they were, you know, in whatever year it was right here today. And this wasn't just poetic license. You can be born in Bethlehem. And I thought when I heard that, I wondered how many were. And you know, I would say probably for the most part, most were not. Most rejected the opportunity to be born with Christ in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that Christ was born, you know, maybe 1500 years ago, uh, 1800 years ago, 1900 years ago, and here's the prophet standing there in in whatever year this was." Uh I just have it here. Uh in uh 1963. Yes. So 1900 maybe 63 years ago. And they say, "Well, Christ was born back there. H how how are we going to be born?" Or is this just, you know, kind of spiritualizing it? Are we how are we going to be born there? It'll be impossible to be born there in Bethlehem. I'm going to say mouthful. If they didn't recognize the vessel that was speaking the word &gt;&gt; because this is the two-part. This is the two-part. I want you to catch both part. One is the physical part. Jesus had to come and be a physical man. Jesus had to be born in a physical body just exactly like you and I. He had to have that physical part but within him was God. Now he was born a virgin born without sin but re through the redemption process he would bring his children every one of them born in sin everyone born in sin and that would be the human part and within that whole body he has apostles and prophets teachers evangelists and helps and all kinds of order and he has deacons and he has trustees and he has sons sons and daughter. &gt;&gt; I tell you, nothing can be closer to the heart of God than his sons and his daughters. And they're they're they're he gave them a body and they have a human. But in them in them is this same spirit that brought the whole the whole lineage, the whole genealogies up brought it's the same spirit that directed Joshua. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that directed him and says Judah will be here. &gt;&gt; That same spirit moved all the way down. That same spirit was there when it led the led the spies and brought them right to Rahab's house. That was the same spirit. And then she was she was brought into the picture. That same spirit, that same God that preserved her and preserved her whole household. And then that same spirit that led the whole thing to Naomi. It led her coming back in a Yes, sure. There was a famine. She lost her husband, lost two sons. She's got two daughters in-laws and she's going back. It was that same spirit that was guiding her back to come at barley season. Had to come back at barley season. It's that same spirit that led Ruth into a field of Boaz and she's there gleaning, just trying to get enough to survive. that same spirit because then here come Boaz and took her and united her to himself &gt;&gt; and took her as his wife. That same spirit. You see the whole plan of God is moving on down through all of these natural human events. &gt;&gt; I mean, one is one is gleaning grain. They're working. You were working this last week. You were doing your things, doing your duties. They were doing theirs. But within it and behind the scenes was God himself, God Almighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they had to be brought up as young people and as children and they had to experience all of their things, but all the way down and down through the prophets and Israel's movements all around. But God God continually directing the affairs of the whole purpose, his whole purpose, his whole scheme. And then we come right down, take a quantum leap down to the end time. And God now in the end time sends a sends a messenger, a vessel, &gt;&gt; just a vessel. Like to be in the wilderness, he like to hunt. He dressed a certain way, spoke a certain way, had a certain accent, born in a certain place. All of these things. God is a that that's a human part. &gt;&gt; That's the human aspect. That's the physical part. But behind that, and this you need to see, behind that is Almighty God directing the affairs, directing the events. And he directed you even when you were lost and undone and knew nothing about it. And he brought you right under a certain sound into a certain atmosphere to hear a certain thing so that the light could strike that seed. &gt;&gt; That was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see that two two parts. Now just hold that. It's absolutely essential. Now I just say maybe people don't like to hear this and they certainly wouldn't like to have at that time but there was no way for those people in Phoenix or any other place. There is no way for them to receive a birth in Bethlehem and reject the very voice of the Holy Spirit through the messenger that was speaking. &gt;&gt; And I know a lot thought, "Well, I can get it. I don't need him." Say, "I can get it anyway." That's not so. &gt;&gt; It's not so. the human vessel and I'll come into it. Now I'm coming more now to the the hub of the message and I won't be long. It'll be another 15 20 minutes. Now Jesus said that he was the bread that came down from heaven. And I thought a great deal about that. He was the bread that came down from heaven. The bread of God. He calls it the bread of God. Came down from heaven. How did it come down? How' the bread come down? Because he said, listen close. and the bread which I will give is my body. And that was the very thing they stumbled over and that's the very thing that brother Brandon refers to all the time because when he said that except he eat the flesh of the son of man and that's where they turned away because they couldn't grasp it. It's not something we can just take and think about and you know consider it if we wish to consider it. We need to consider it. What is it that we're actually eating? What is it that we actually how did this bread come down from heaven? It came down through the children of the promise that believed the word of the promise for their day. The bread came down from heaven because it's a twofold. It had to have the natural lineage. &gt;&gt; It had to have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though Jesus was going to be born of a virgin, that virgin had to be connected to a certain specific lineage, &gt;&gt; a certain tie. &gt;&gt; Going to get in a little deep water here, but I I hope it'll be all right. &gt;&gt; It had to have that natural. In other words, here we are in the physical. You know, we may think, "Oh, the physical doesn't matter about anything." So, just a second. It's the only body gave you. It's the only body that God gave you. And he caused you to be born, where you were born, and to whom you were born. And when God selects you by coming by the Holy Spirit, that's God's doing. We have nothing to say about that. And where you were born and how you were born, what family you were born, what color your eyes or your hair or the shape of you or color your skin or anything, that has nothing to do with nothing to do with with us. That's God's choosing. &gt;&gt; God chose these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it had to be that way. You could not be someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's a foolish statement." But we act that way a lot of times. &gt;&gt; We act that way as though it it didn't make any difference to God, whether it's me or somebody else. It does. &gt;&gt; It makes a very very big difference to God. And and in the sovereign God choosing, he chooses precisely that person. In other words, if I said to you, you could have been Rahab or somebody else. It could not have been. &gt;&gt; She probably wasn't the only harlot in the country, but it had to be her &gt;&gt; and only her. &gt;&gt; And she had a heart to believe it. &gt;&gt; So, there's a emerging even within the individual. Some of you that are standing here right today or sitting here today, you probably don't even know why you believed when you heard the message. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You probably don't can't give a good answer why you believed it. If you had to scientifically say why you believed it, I don't know. Because faith doesn't operate by reasoning. It just says, "I don't know, but I believed it." And so the bread came down from heaven through the children of the promise that believed the word of promise for their day. They had to believe what they believe for their day. And secondly, by believing they were instruments in the hand of God to bring forth Jesus Christ, the bread of eternal life. They played an integral part of bringing forth Jesus Christ. Even though after it was all over and Joseph is on the scene and he takes Mary to wife, she's found pregnant of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; which has nothing to do with him or his seed. &gt;&gt; But yet that lineage was so vital &gt;&gt; that this Bible could not have been written without that lineage being what it was. If you went to Matthew the first chapter, second chapter and go to Luke, you cannot. This is the whole word of God. &gt;&gt; The prophet says you got to see Christ in every verse. &gt;&gt; In every verse. &gt;&gt; In every verse. &gt;&gt; That lineage is an absolute absolute perfect will and plan of God. It couldn't be any other way. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can see the strength of that that is that's a powerful truth and a powerful statement. &gt;&gt; Even though at the end at the end of it God sovereignly and God in his own great wisdom which he has to undo the original sin and that could not be done by any man born in sin. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be done with anybody by that lineage. But God brought the lineage on. God gave life to the individuals. And so God had to make a way. He had to pay the sentence of his own sentence. He that eateth that will die in the day you eat there that will die. And that came all the way down. But God sees redemption. And he's showing the he's showing redemption. He's showing the token. He's showing the Exodus. He's bringing it all the way down. All the way down. And then at the end, it's like a gap, a break. And and because she's conceived, it's a virgin that conceives. &gt;&gt; And there's no natural seed there that bridges that. None at all. What bridges it is the word of God that says I attribute all that he is to this line of people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I attribute everything that he is. He's bread. They're bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's my son. They're my sons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everything he was God bridged that gap &gt;&gt; between the natural lineage and the and the and the sovereignty of the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Why had that be a little Bethlehem? It had to be an insignificant place because all the people of God have been in humility and insignificant. But God bridge that gap by his word. &gt;&gt; I will do it &gt;&gt; and no man can question him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You're getting it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, that's just where I begin. &gt;&gt; That's where I would have liked to started preaching, but I had to lead up all this all this background so you can see where I'm going. And that is why we can say such a grace as it was. We could say Tamar by grace was a part and Rahab by grace was a part, an inseparable part. Ruth the Moabites was a part &gt;&gt; and Basheba was a part of this whole line &gt;&gt; and no one can separate them from having a part in bringing forth the bread of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if Jesus was simply listen close, hang on. If Jesus was simply to be born of a virgin, why didn't God just pick any virgin? select a wonderful virgin and have the Christ child born by this virgin, not connected to anything. She had to be connected &gt;&gt; because God in his own in his own sovereign will was determined that all of those people back there, now when I refer to those back there, remember that we can just we can swing into the future just as easy. But if we see that because that's written in the scripture, then we can project that and see it and put ourselves in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Tammer had to be a part. &gt;&gt; You cannot explain. &gt;&gt; You can't explain. I I defy anybody to explain how how God could take take that woman. It says of Tamar was the wife of two sons of Judah and Onen. Genesis 38:6-30. Her importance in the scriptures depends on the great anxiety to keep up the lineage of Judah who was her father-in-law. It seems as if the family were on the point of extinction. And Onen was her first husband. He died. On and God smoked him and slew him and they had successfively perished suddenly. Judah's wife Baou died and their only remaining child Sheila whom Judah was unwilling to trust to the dangerous woman or the union with this woman. And as it appeared with Tamar, because the two sons had died already, lest he should meet with the same fate as his brothers, accordingly she resorted to the desperate act of entrapping Judah. She dressed as a harlot and the father himself. She entrapped Judah, the father himself into the union which he feared for his son. The fruits of this intercourse were the twins Pharaoh's and Zarah. And through Pharaoh's the sacred line was continued. The sacred excuse me, the sacred line was continued through this whole thing &gt;&gt; through this act. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was. The sacred line was continued and placed her over in Matthew 1 &gt;&gt; declaring &gt;&gt; Jesus clearly declaring I'm not ashamed &gt;&gt; to call Tamar one of my mothers. And if he's not ashamed to call her one of his mothers, how would he be ashamed to call us his brethren, &gt;&gt; his children? &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, my brother, my sister, we haven't we haven't even got a we haven't even scratched the surface of the meaning of what grace is. &gt;&gt; We haven't even touched it. &gt;&gt; This glorious, amazing grace of God that he's shown to us. and brought them embraced them and brought them in and would say, "You're part of bringing this righteous loaf called Jesus Christ, the bread of God, to his place in Bethlehem." &gt;&gt; You're part of it, Tamar. You're part of it, Rahab. &gt;&gt; Oh, they had a memory like you have a memory. That's right. They could think of everything that happened in their life like you can. &gt;&gt; They could think of every act of sin and unbelief and whatever more. They could think of that too. And the same devil that is here today was there back then &gt;&gt; telling them what kind of life they lived. &gt;&gt; But because they believed &gt;&gt; the promise. &gt;&gt; And that's what I had to get across to you. Because they believed the promise that came to them. They didn't have all kinds of books and tapes and CDs and MP3s and all the rest of it. They didn't have they could download this and download that. They just had a little promise that maybe came through a a messenger, a spy or whatever more and said, "Give me a token." Rahab said, "You do this and do that and do the other thing and you'll be saved." &gt;&gt; And they hung on to that. &gt;&gt; That's what he said and that's what I believe. &gt;&gt; By faith are ye saved through grace. and that not of yourself. It is the gift of God. If you only have that scripture, you can make it. &gt;&gt; You don't need volumes and volumes and volumes. But look what God has given us. &gt;&gt; Look at the volumes he has given us. &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, I just feel like I like to start preaching at this time. It is so glorious. &gt;&gt; And to think that our Lord Jesus Christ would embrace them, those Gentile of the past. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If that be the case, he has embraced the gentile of the future. He's embraced the gentile of this time. &gt;&gt; Born in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; We've been born in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; We've been born in Leodysia. And what are we going to do? &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with that? God says, "I'll give you another birth. &gt;&gt; I'll send you another message. And by believing the message and the messenger, you'll be born again in Bethlehem." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you will become a house of my bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why God knew exactly where you're going to be born. &gt;&gt; Now, just let me just digress a moment. Hang right on to that. Brother Brandon says, "I just spoke about a new name. didn't know I was going to be on this subject at all. Brother Brandham says the name Bethlehem and he goes and breaks it down. He says sometimes we're inclined to think that a name doesn't mean anything. Names mean something. &gt;&gt; And he goes and why names were changed etc etc. He says and then he says and this person that's in you listen closely now. This person that's in you &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; which is your birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. this person that's in you. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about, you know, the John, Susie, Barry, and so on so forth that's sitting here. I want to talk now about this person that's in you. &gt;&gt; The one I've never seen &gt;&gt; and the one that's in me that you've never seen. &gt;&gt; I want to talk about that person where they were born. &gt;&gt; He says, "You are John Doe. You're born in a certain month and you're born under a certain star and you're born under a certain thing and that has something to do with you. It certainly does. Even though we're here just in the flesh, these carcasses, but when God saw you, God saw you issued out into the world from your mother's womb. &gt;&gt; And God who made all the planets and put all the stars in place and everything, he had you born at a precise time. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had you born under precise sign &gt;&gt; and a horoscopes and all of this kind of nonsense is just a devil's it's just a devil's substitute. &gt;&gt; But God who made everything. He made you a certain way. And some are quiet and some are boisterous and some are patient and some are impatient and and some are this and some are that way. And we are that way because we've been born under certain sign. But listen now. He says, "Why did Aaron have on his breastplate Aaron the high priest? Why did he have on his breastplate the birthstone?" &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of each one of those patriarchs, &gt;&gt; on his breastplate, &gt;&gt; he said, "Look at those mothers when they gave the utterance when them mothers and the Hebrew women." He's gone from the breastplate of of of Aaron. And he goes back to the Hebrew mothers and in labor giving utterance to those children being born. It placed their name. It told their birth. It put them in their homeland and set them over in eternity. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Now he says Jacob when he was dying and when he laid his hands upon the patriarchs and blessed them he was telling them exactly where they would be &gt;&gt; and that's according to their name and exactly according to their birth and sure it has something to do with he said now that's your birth path &gt;&gt; catch this please your birth path that's what you are a natural natural man or a natural woman. But when you're reborn again, that's not the outside conscience. The outside is what you see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. But the inside of that is what you really are. You're born a certain way. You've got certain traits. You've got certain idiosyncrasies. You've got it. You can't get rid of it. You have it. Sometimes it's a sticky part of us where it's something that we uh you know that is troublesome to us and that that's your grab bag. The human grab bag as I preach on. You have it. Everybody has it. Anybody who denies that God just isn't telling the truth. We all got a human grab bag. But I got I'm glad I got a spiritual &gt;&gt; and it's not a grab bag. &gt;&gt; It's something spiritual. I got a spiritual birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I just say a little personal note when brother Vin on one of his trips when he was up here, you know, and I guess he's just observing and seeing, you know, we observe one another and I see how someone else does things and he was observing how I approach things and do things. And I'd never been I'd never been a stargazer. Never paid any attention to where I was born, when I was born, and all the rest of it. But he says, "When when were you born?" So, what's your birth date? I says, "I'm October." Oh, that explains it. You're you're a Libra. You weigh everything out. Oh, it's it's torturous. I weigh things out and dissect them and drop them down and pick them up again and chew it all over again and think about and somebody said, "Why don't you do something? Why don't you do something?" I'm still just chewing it over. I'm thinking it over. Weigh it out and weigh it out and weigh it out and weigh it out. How long do you have to weigh it out? Oh, sometimes a month, maybe six months, maybe a year. Got to think it out. Got to just weigh it out. Weigh it out. I can't help it. I have to I have to put all it on God. God saw that was born there and I guess he wanted that. And brother Brandham says he was slow and Moses was slow and so I'll join those ranks. I'm slow and you were born a certain time. &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes, please? &gt;&gt; He said, now that's your birth path. That's your natural natural. But when the wise men, listen to this, when the wise men saw the star that identified the place and the time that the Messiah was going to be on the earth, they also saw their birth path. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you identified that Christ was not 2,000 years ago, you identified Christ was here. Now Christ is here. The Messiah is on the earth. The Messiah is here. The Messiah is talking to He's speaking to me. This is not a historical thing. I have revelation. We're in that coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; The Messiah &gt;&gt; has descended. &gt;&gt; Now to some, it's just some information. I'm so I feel sorry for you. &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for you. But when that grips you, it ignites you. And brother Benham says in uniting time and sign, he said, "Did you notice how vivid the sign for the wise men? They were Hebrews. They weren't actually Indian astronomers. They were Hebrews because they were up there in the country studying astronomy to finish their education. And when they looked towards Jerusalem, listen closely. And knowing that they saw those three stars from each one of their birth path, Ham, Sham, and Japheth, of which race they came from, each and they seen them stars in their birth path. That was a sign to them that when those stars were in line, the Messiah was on the earth. Now, it's a wonderful thing that they would see that and say, "The Messiah is on the earth." But a prophet comes and catches something that you would never catch normally. He says, "When they saw those stars, when they saw that light, they saw their birth path." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My dear believer friends sitting here listening this morning, I want to say to you, when you saw &gt;&gt; that divine light &gt;&gt; that shone to you in this generation, &gt;&gt; you saw your birth path. You saw your race. &gt;&gt; You saw where you came from. And there's no other way to see where you came from. That's the only way you can see it. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you have the natural. Well, I came from this. I come from Kentucky or I come from uh Alaska or I came from Newfanland or wherever you came from. I come from Europe. I come from Russia. That has nothing to do with it. That's just this outside man. That's just this outside conscience. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I say today, &gt;&gt; in all truth, in real truth, by revelation, something that has a deeper reality to you than your natural birth, where did you come from? &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, you know, I'll tell you where I come from. I saw a light." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I heard a message. &gt;&gt; I heard a messenger. &gt;&gt; And that was my messenger &gt;&gt; sent from God. Yes, sir. That was my angel sent to me with a divine message. &gt;&gt; And when I saw the light, &gt;&gt; I saw where I came from. &gt;&gt; I saw my birth path. &gt;&gt; I saw my origin. &gt;&gt; We came from a divine place. &gt;&gt; I came from above. &gt;&gt; You came from above. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was talking. I have to I have to just finish this. Do I have your consent just for a few moments? I've been really really waiting on God for this for some time and I because I wouldn't want to take a whole service just on the next comments. When Jesus But this is really where it caps off. Jesus was speaking in John 6. He was speaking to the leaders of that day as he did also in this day. Speaking to him and they opened up. Oh, they said, you know, so often the leaders say the wrong thing. And they opened up the subject and they said, they said unto him, "What sign do you show us that we may see and believe you? What do you work? What work do thou?" They said, "Our fathers ate mana in the desert. As it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat." Now, they could have asked for anything else, but it was it had to be even God directed those rejecting leaders to open up the door. &gt;&gt; What sign do you show us? &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate mana. They could have said, "What sign do you show us? Our fathers went through the Red Sea." Or, "Our fathers did this and our fathers did that." But what sign do you show us? Our fathers ate mana from heaven and and God gave them bread from heaven. And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God," and I put that underlined. For the bread of God is he which came down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. And he said in the 51st verse, I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world. receiving the word that that God sends to us through the body through that body that house through which the eternal God is manifesting himself. Receiving the word through that body &gt;&gt; was the only way a person could partake of the flesh. &gt;&gt; That was the partaking part. &gt;&gt; Understand? From this, from the blood came the spirit, the life. But he kept saying, and brother Brandham kept making such a point of it, except to eat the flesh. And that's what stumbled them because it was the veil. &gt;&gt; The flesh that stumbled them. &gt;&gt; They couldn't accept. And it was exactly the same today. It was the veil, the prophet veil that they could not they couldn't eat it. They couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; And because they couldn't take that, they never got the life from the sea spirit part. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the life of it. &gt;&gt; Now you see, I'm coming down home real fast. &gt;&gt; You folks will be with you work you work amongst unbelievers. You you'll be with friends. You'll be with maybe family over this Christmas season and they know you. You're their, you know, son, daughter, mother, father, whatever. You're their friend, whatever. We, we know you. We are entrapped in our natural understanding of one another's life. &gt;&gt; But if we could realize, sir, &gt;&gt; this one here has been born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; I was born in Bethlehem. You're born in Bethlehem. You're born in Bethlehem. You're born in Bethlehem. You sisters born in Bethlehem. We've all been born in the same place. &gt;&gt; You weren't born in Africa and me born in Canada. You're born in the United States. That's just this old shell. &gt;&gt; But on the other hand, anyone who wants to get any value of that new person that was born in Bethlehem, they cannot hear the one born in Bethlehem till they hear the one that was born wherever they were born. &gt;&gt; Because this is a vessel. &gt;&gt; That's a vessel. You're the vessel that God chose before the foundation of the world to be born where you were born, under the sign you were born, to whom you were born, and he saw your footsteps through until you connect with that divine light and you'd be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And it is that merging of those two. It's that combination, that dual uh the the dual relationship, if I can say it that way. Are you following me? Do you understand? And because they could not take the flesh &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, they could not receive the spiritual part. &gt;&gt; There's no way for them to say, "Well, I reject what he says and I'll just go up to the upper room with these other people and I'll just get it anyway. I'll just go up anyway. I reject what Jesus Christ says." I tell you what, man has always tried to go around, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't work. And so Jesus said this, he broke his broke the bread. And when he broke the bread, he said, "This is this bread is my body which is given for you." And I've got to just go quickly so I can conclude here now. And I should be spending a lot more time on this. But then Apostle Paul comes, the first church age messenger to let you and I know that there's been a change here. There's been a transformation. He says, "Now you are the body of Christ. You are the body of Christ. You're the body that And listen, this body's been broken and bruised and beaten and and and everything else all down through the generations. And God breaks a piece off and says, "I'll send a piece here. I'll break a piece off. I'll send piece here. I'll break a piece off here." And the people who receive and hear that that servant of Christ, it can be the most insignificant. It can be a it can be a child. It can be a in school. It can be a housewife in the mall. It can be anyone but that that body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Rejected &gt;&gt; yet today. &gt;&gt; Broken maybe in spirit, &gt;&gt; wounded by the struggles of life, turned out perhaps by the family and rejected by the by associates and whatever more and denied and spoken evil against. But they stand there and hold the testimony of Jesus Christ proudly and bravely like a gentile warrior. Hallelujah. I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For it is the power of God under salvation. I was born in some country but I was born again in Jerus in Bethlehem. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I carry the bread of God. &gt;&gt; I haven't only partaken of it. But Apostle Paul says you're the body of Christ. He says another place, "Know you not that you are one loaf? You are one bread. &gt;&gt; You're the bread of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And where did you come from? You came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; This bread is not of the earth. &gt;&gt; This bread came from heaven. &gt;&gt; That which is in you. Came from heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I hope you're seeing it. You ought to be You ought to be so thankful today. You ought to be on your feet. You ought to do something. Say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; you sent this down from heaven. &gt;&gt; This that is in me has come from heaven. &gt;&gt; What does this world matter? What is what does this life matter? It doesn't matter anything. &gt;&gt; We're just we're just pilgrims and strangers moving through here. &gt;&gt; What does this Christmas? It's nothing. &gt;&gt; It's just a bunch of tinsel, &gt;&gt; valless, shiny things. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will not have that &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. Brother Bram talks about Christmas and little gift for the children. We got bags of candy here for them and which we've never done. That that that's irrelevant to me whether we do it, whether they did it or I don't look at every everything brother Brandham did just so that I can go and do exactly the same thing. He said you can't tell the little children they see the others receiving gifts and so on. You can't tell them these things and so on so forth. But you friends, to me, this Christmas season is what I'm preaching about this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in some little thing, you know, can I or can't I or can you or can't you or whatever more. I think that we ought to just keep our lives un uninterrupted with the world, unassociated with the world. Let them go on in their rat race. Let them go on and spend themselves out. I'd urge you not to do it. Hallelujah. Stay out of that rat race. Stay calm before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy this time together. Enjoy this time in the in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To me. It was just staggering to think about these things. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, said, "Take, eat. This is my body." And the last thing I want to say to you is, "Cast your bread &gt;&gt; upon the waters, &gt;&gt; and after many days, it'll return to you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is your bread. Healing is the children's bread. &gt;&gt; But now the scripture tells us, "Cast your bread." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Upon the waters, &gt;&gt; and after many days, it will return to you again. You cast your good work. &gt;&gt; One person said to brother Brandham says, "Oh, yeah. Well, he just, you know, he just buttered them up. You know, they he he he just buttered them." He said, "Well, &gt;&gt; that was good." He says, "I, you know, you need bread that's buttered. He said, and he said, "You want to cast your bread upon the water? Say something nice about somebody else and that'll come back to you. You send it out bone dry and moldy, it'll probably come back to you mo bone dry and moldy. But you send it out butter, it'll probably come back to you buttered." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I think God has has really buttered up his his children. Told them how he loved them. Told them what he's done for them. Aren't you thankful today? Oh, thank God from whom all blessings flow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; just in the end of this service at this moment, I just want to give you thanks. We've been somewhat lengthy, but I I just felt I wanted to convey Lord what was the burden of your word upon my own heart and feel it had been delivered. And I pray that you'll help me Lord to have said the right thing and if anything was improper, incorrect or inappropriate, you take that from the minds of the people. ask you to bless them and bless all who are here and present and those that are present in other places and locations on the streaming. Oh God, bless them whether they be in Norway or Germany, Switzerland, Newfoundland, down the east coast or throughout the United States. Lord, wherever they are, pray that you'll bless them. Just bless them, dear precious saints of God, children of God, Bethlehem dwellers in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a fountain open. And in this message, Brother Bram spoke of it. There's a fountain open in the house of David. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're all beneficiaries of it. It's not sealed up anymore. It's a fountain open for us. Maybe we could just stand and sing it. There's a fountain open in the house [Music] to be. And there are streams of grace that flowing down from Calary. [Music] Let's sing it once again. Let's land. Why don't you come and help us? Would you in the house you would [Music] stream that's flowing down from Calary now? and receive. &gt;&gt; For I will take you from the nations from the nations &gt;&gt; and bring you to your own land. &gt;&gt; And I'll be sanctified in you before the eyes of men. &gt;&gt; A new heart will I give you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And place my spirit within. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; I'll sprinkle clean water on you and save you from your sin. There is a fountain open [Music] to you. Who will be [Music] falling down from [Music] &gt;&gt; and I will pour upon the house a mightious chosen ones. The spirit of grace and of supplication. And in that day, what a day that would be. A fountain shall be opened up and yes, you shall be holy. There is a mountain where you are to [Music] believe. [Music] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. There are streams of grace. Streams of grace. I pray the streams of grace will flood over us. Great billowing waves. Oh, Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit of God, gracious Holy Spirit of God, we are here today and have life, the life that we have only because of your grace. [Music] and we desire to approach you, oh God, to give you thanks. That our eyes have been opened and we see what we see. I pray, Father, that you will pour upon this congregation and all who are within the sound of my voice. Pour out upon them, oh God, all the benefits of these streams from the house of David. Lord, I thank you that one day in Bethlehem, the natural Bethlehem was born the Savior. And Lord, we do not know the day or the evening or what time it was, but you did send him. Christ Jesus was born and we want to glorify you for that and thank you for this great redemption. None of us could earn it. And as I spoke this morning, Lord, we see from looking through the scriptures and looking into our own lives that was only could come by grace, glorious, amazing grace. I ask you to bless this people, Father, as they depart from this place and some will be journeying and traveling. I ask that you'll give them safe journeys. I pray that they will have superimposed over their minds this great truth. I was born in Bethlehem and I was born with a host of the redeemed. I've been born again in Christ Jesus. Oh, what a glorious, glorious thing. Send them with gladness in their heart. This glorious gift that you have given to us, Lord, in this Jesus Christ revealed in our time. I pray you'll you please, Lord, just give special blessings upon all our young people, our families, all that are standing here, Lord. and let them know that you are very very aware of their individual need and where they are. I pray that you will draw near to them Lord because nothing can take the place of your presence presence yourself with them and abide with us. And may we return this evening Lord to hear what you've laid upon our brother Tom Ray's heart. Oh God, we're anxious to hear these things so we might be moved further in the direction of our heavenly home in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you Bethlehem dwellers, Gentile warriors, [Music] not worthy by your natural birth, but made worthy by your spiritual birth. God with you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Heat. [Music]
