[5:43] &gt;&gt; Loosening the bound, Father.

[6:05] chains.
[6:07] Amen. Maybe you can turn on brother
[6:09] Ryan's mic. He'll help me out with this.
[6:14] [Music]
[6:21] But you won't break.
[6:26] You may stumble.
[6:30] And even feel you've lost your way. But
[6:35] you all fall.
[6:39] God's word
[6:41] remains.
[6:44] You won't be bound
[6:48] by broken chains.
[6:52] You can't be bound.
[6:57] By broken
[6:59] chains,
[7:02] you may bend,
[7:06] but you won't break.
[7:11] You raised the Lord
[7:15] and even
[7:18] lost your way. But you are
[7:24] God's word.
[7:28] You won't be

[7:37] You can't be
[7:41] my broken
[7:43] ch.

[8:48] [Applause]
[8:55] You
[8:58] [Music]
[8:59] know,
[9:03] you me
[9:13] [Music]
[9:15] hallelujah.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name.
[9:24] Hallelujah. We're going to ask Brother
[9:26] Tom to come and pray just after we sing
[9:28] this chorus. Sister Lorie Snow has
[9:31] several requests that she'd like to make
[9:33] mention before the congregation. Ask you
[9:35] to pray earnestly that her mom was
[9:38] admitted to the hospital with heart
[9:40] problems. Her brother Ed is undergoing
[9:41] surgery this week for a valve in his
[9:44] heart. wants to ask for unspoken request
[9:47] for her sister and her family.
[9:53] We have two testimonies. One from
[9:54] brother Steve Rivas thanking the saints
[9:57] for their prayers and thanking the Lord
[9:59] for providing a job for his he and his
[10:01] family. He starts on Monday. Amen.
[10:04] Praise the Lord.
[10:08] Hallelujah.
[10:11] Amen. Many people take a job for
[10:13] granted.
[10:15] until you have to pray for a job.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Then you don't take it for granted. You
[10:19] write in a testimony when God answers
[10:21] your prayer and provides something for
[10:22] you. Amen. Sister Lori wants to thank
[10:26] you all for praying and thank the Lord
[10:28] for keeping his hand on her daughter
[10:30] Christine and herself.
[10:33] It's the preaching of the word, the
[10:35] ministry that enables us to ride through
[10:38] every storm. Amen. My brother Tom come
[10:41] in just a moment. Let's sing this chorus
[10:43] together. Feel it's an anthem for myself
[10:46] even coming from camp when brother Cadre
[10:48] was here winter camp. Lord I lift your
[10:52] name.
[10:55] Lord I
[11:02] [Music]
[11:21] glory.
[11:28] Heat. Heat.
[11:38] Heat. Heat.
[11:45] [Music]
[11:48] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[11:51] [Music]
[11:58] Heat.
[12:03] Heat.
[12:13] I
[12:20] [Music]
[12:22] love
[12:25] you.
[12:34] Heat. Heat.
[12:38] [Music]
[12:50] Heat. Hey, Heat.
[13:00] Glor
[13:05] [Applause]
[13:05] [Music]
[13:08] and my
[13:11] virtue.
[13:17] Before we sing it one more time and go
[13:19] to prayer, there's a request. Also,
[13:22] um, Brother Louise has given us a prayer
[13:24] request for a pastor, Alfredo. How do
[13:28] you say last name?
[13:30] built us and Buenosares has asked
[13:34] us to pray for them.
[13:37] They gave him a printer, a hub printer
[13:39] in Argentina. Brother Alfredo told me
[13:42] they broke into his church, took
[13:44] everything, music instruments, sound
[13:45] equipment, everything. They were
[13:47] preparing a portion of the church for
[13:49] the hub, and by the grace of God, the
[13:51] printer was still in his house. He's
[13:54] determined to print the message as soon
[13:56] as they can. Pray for the situation. We
[13:59] can do that, can't we?
[14:00] &gt;&gt; And I believe there's other situations
[14:02] here in the house of God. We are a needy
[14:05] people.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Needy of the presence of God.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; We never want to get to the place of
[14:10] Revelation 3.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Where they felt there is no need.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; I have a need this morning.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; I put on a tape early this morning,
[14:19] started to listen to that prophet and
[14:21] started to see how far I've fallen
[14:24] short. But I just want the grace of God.
[14:27] I want his grace this morning. We want
[14:29] the presence of God to come in the word
[14:31] to meet our needs. Let's just sing the
[14:34] chorus. We'll go to prayer.
[14:37] Lord, I live.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:44] and your holy
[14:47] [Music]
[14:48] name.
[14:50] [Music]
[14:57] Hallelujah.
[14:58] Hallelujah.
[15:01] Oh, the great
[15:05] I am.
[15:09] Every
[15:13] [Music]
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[15:25] [Music]
[15:30] I'm sure, Father, if we would ask this
[15:32] morning from the depths of our heart.
[15:37] Do I have a need?
[15:41] I'm sure without reservation, there
[15:43] would be 100% of us just lifting up our
[15:46] hands
[15:48] saying, "Oo, great provider,
[15:51] &gt;&gt; meet my need this morning."
[15:54] and we believe you are the risen lamb.
[15:58] You are the mighty God and you're more
[16:01] than able to meet all needs.
[16:04] Brother Louise has pinned down this
[16:07] request that we would pray for the
[16:08] saints in Argentina.
[16:12] We know the enemy is a robber.
[16:15] He's a thief and he's a destroyer.
[16:19] But Lord, I love the following statement
[16:21] that you said. But I am come to give you
[16:25] life and life more abundantly.
[16:29] And so Lord God, we believe that you
[16:31] will meet their needs according to your
[16:33] word, that you will give them life,
[16:35] Lord, that you will take the situation
[16:37] and that Father, you will turn it around
[16:39] for the glory of God. And so Lord Jesus,
[16:43] with our hands lifted up and our hearts
[16:46] open, we're asking Lord that this
[16:49] resurrected King would come by and suck
[16:52] with us in a supernatural way by the
[16:55] word of God.
[16:59] That we could say, "Come to my soul,
[17:02] &gt;&gt; precious Jesus.
[17:05] Meet my heart's cry
[17:07] &gt;&gt; and meet my need."
[17:10] And so, Lord, as we have oneness of
[17:11] heart and mind this morning, knowing
[17:14] that there's many away, Lord, on their
[17:16] vacation, and some have already returned
[17:19] home, but we're thankful that we have
[17:21] the presence of God that goes before us,
[17:24] that never failing presence of Jesus
[17:26] Christ. So, Lord, would you anoint the
[17:29] man of God this morning?
[17:32] Would you anoint the gift?
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Would you anoint our ears? Would you
[17:37] anoint our eyes? And may we see your
[17:39] glory go by as your prophet said, Lord,
[17:42] that you hid Moses that day. And when he
[17:44] saw the backside of God, he saw a
[17:47] bleeding black. Lord, may we see the
[17:49] bleeding word bleed for us this morning.
[17:52] Meet our needs. And Lord, we have
[17:54] children that need an experience with
[17:56] God. May we reach out into faith and
[17:59] say, "God, save our children. Fill us
[18:02] with the Holy Ghost. Let the word of God
[18:05] permeate
[18:06] our hearts and lives this morning. Meet
[18:10] those that have joined with us on the
[18:12] internet. Speak to their hearts and meet
[18:15] their needs. And Father, we'll be sure
[18:17] to give you all the glory and honor and
[18:19] praise. And father, would you anoint now
[18:22] the remainder of the service, the songs
[18:25] and the worship and be glorified now as
[18:28] we commit all the prayer requests and
[18:30] all the needs to you in Jesus name.
[18:34] Amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn next person next to
[18:40] you shake their hands say God bless you
[18:42] this morning. It's wonderful to be in
[18:44] the house of the Lord this morning.
[18:48] Amen. that you may have your seats.
[18:51] For those that are in the visible
[18:53] audience, those that are on the
[18:54] telephone hookup and the internet, we
[18:56] want to say God bless you this morning,
[19:00] those that are
[19:02] visiting here among us, want to say God
[19:04] bless you to you as well. Amen. We just
[19:06] had a wonderful time this uh just last
[19:09] evening. We had several of the young
[19:11] people out at the camp. We had an
[19:13] unexpected weekend off out there. group
[19:15] moved out to September that was supposed
[19:17] to be there this weekend. So, we took
[19:20] the opportunity and invited some of the
[19:22] young people out and just had a really
[19:23] wonderful time. We appreciated those of
[19:25] you that were able to make it. We'll try
[19:27] and do that again here real soon.
[19:28] Sometimes it's short notice, but well,
[19:30] that's just the way it goes. Praise the
[19:33] Lord. Ryan's going to sing a song for us
[19:36] this morning. We appreciate Brother Ryan
[19:38] standing in the gap for us and
[19:42] appreciate the gift, Brother Ryan. God
[19:43] bless you this morning.

[29:19] Well, I want to greet you all in the
[29:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm
[29:24] certainly glad to see each of you.
[29:28] I want to also give special greetings to
[29:30] the they're streaming in Seattle this
[29:33] morning. Brother John Andy's has been
[29:35] down and they had service Friday night
[29:38] and I think another one last night. I'm
[29:40] not too sure. And I just got a text from
[29:42] him and he was saying they're going to
[29:45] uh join together in stream and some are
[29:47] here. God bless you. All right. I'm I
[29:52] have something that's very much on my
[29:54] heart. I'm going to ask for your
[29:56] complete cooperation. I prayed that uh
[29:59] whoever was supposed to be here and
[30:01] whoever is supposed to be streaming will
[30:04] be. Uh I have had this on my heart for
[30:08] some time.
[30:10] uh and uh and and I I just need your
[30:14] cooperation so that God will be able to
[30:17] take a hold of me and allow me to say
[30:20] what I need to say and how I how I want
[30:24] to say it. It's a strange subject a wee
[30:26] bit and uh you'll notice how strange it
[30:29] is from the title when we begin. I have
[30:33] a few slides also and I don't want to
[30:36] feel uh pressed for time. So, if you'll
[30:39] just be a real reverend, and I think
[30:42] that's important. I believe God honors
[30:44] that. Uh you have already prayed, but
[30:47] I'd like to just pray and ask God's uh
[30:51] special guidance this morning if he
[30:53] would grant us that.
[30:56] Father, how I appreciate the people that
[30:59] are here today.
[31:02] How I appreciate Lord there are your
[31:04] children those that are streaming from
[31:07] near and far. I pray oh God that you
[31:11] will bless them with the same presence.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And may the word Lord as I have been
[31:17] praying earnestly not be in merely
[31:20] preaching and word only but in power and
[31:24] in demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[31:27] Father, it's the same gospel. You have
[31:30] restored us back to the faith of the
[31:33] fathers. Let something be said, Lord.
[31:36] Let the word uh be projected in such a
[31:39] way so that faith will rise in the in
[31:42] the hearts of the hearer. And may they
[31:45] may they take hold of it now, Lord,
[31:48] &gt;&gt; not at some time in the future, but may
[31:50] they lay hold of it at this moment for
[31:53] the very thing that they are looking to
[31:55] you for and asking you for. Lord, we
[31:58] don't want to be continually asking, but
[32:00] then we want to lay hold of it and
[32:02] receive it.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'll bless this
[32:05] congregation and bless all who are
[32:08] gathering, oh God, believers of this
[32:10] message near and far. I pray your
[32:13] blessing upon them. Those that are
[32:15] streaming in Seattle, oh God, at this
[32:17] time in in Switzerland, Norway, Europe,
[32:20] Father, New Zealand, wherever they might
[32:23] be, I pray your blessing upon the dear
[32:25] ones.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; And anoint us now, oh God, to speak and
[32:30] the hearers to hear in Jesus' name.
[32:33] Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:36] Uh if you'll turn in your Bibles to
[32:39] Isaiah the 53rd chapter, it was also
[32:41] from this reading
[32:44] that we spoke
[32:47] I think two weeks ago
[32:50] and I had a considerable
[32:53] uh response from different ones and when
[32:57] uh we took the value of the flaw.
[33:01] You remember that?
[33:03] &gt;&gt; All right. This service today will tie
[33:05] directly into that.
[33:10] I'm going to begin to read in the 52nd
[33:12] chapter verse 13
[33:16] and then on down into 53
[33:19] 1-5.
[33:22] Behold, my servant shall deal prudently.
[33:26] He shall be exalted and extolled and be
[33:30] very high.
[33:32] As many were astoned at thee, his visage
[33:36] was marred more than any man, and his
[33:40] form more than the sons of men.
[33:44] So shall he sprinkled many nations, and
[33:48] kings shall shut their mouths at him.
[33:51] For that which he had been had not been
[33:54] told uh told them shall they see and
[33:59] that which they had not heard shall they
[34:01] consider.
[34:03] Who hath believed our report? And to
[34:05] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[34:09] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a
[34:11] tender plant,
[34:13] &gt;&gt; and as a root out of dry ground. He hath
[34:16] no form nor clumliness. And when we
[34:21] shall see him, there is no beauty that
[34:24] we should desire him. In other words,
[34:26] Isaiah is saying that there is no form,
[34:29] there's no attraction.
[34:31] Uh and there's no comeliness, there's no
[34:35] honor, there's nothing special about him
[34:38] that we should uh that we should desire
[34:42] him.
[34:45] And he is despised and rejected of men.
[34:48] I'd like you to notice this progression
[34:50] which I'll come to later. He is despised
[34:54] and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
[34:57] and acquainted with grief. And we hid as
[35:00] it were our faces from him. He was
[35:03] despised and we esteemed him not. Surely
[35:06] he hath borne our griefs and carried our
[35:09] sorrows.
[35:11] Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten
[35:14] of God. See, they he he said, "We we we
[35:20] considered that God brought this upon
[35:22] him as smitten of God and afflicted, but
[35:26] he was wounded for our transgressions.
[35:30] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[35:33] chastisement of our peace was upon him,
[35:37] and with his stripes
[35:39] we are healed."
[35:42] Uh that's the whole man, body, spirit,
[35:44] and soul.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; With his stripes, we are healed. You may
[35:48] be seated.
[35:55] I spoke on the value of the flaw
[36:00] and we will
[36:03] we'll remember and recall and I will
[36:05] touch on just uh certain aspects of
[36:07] that. But I would like to speak to you
[36:10] today on a very strange subject. I've
[36:12] never spoken
[36:14] like this before.
[36:16] Excuse my voice, but it'll improve as we
[36:20] go along.
[36:23] I want to speak to you on the wound
[36:25] speaks.
[36:27] The wound speaks.
[36:30] So, we had the value of a flaw. The
[36:33] flaw. We all have flaws.
[36:36] And sometimes we've wondered about uh
[36:39] things in our lives or things of our
[36:41] past and whatever more. And now I want
[36:44] to speak to you and and I believe it's a
[36:49] very profound truth that the wound
[36:51] speaks.
[36:53] Uh
[36:55] Jesus
[36:57] embraced his his suffering. He didn't
[37:01] try to rid himself of pain.
[37:04] today, whether it be physical, of
[37:06] course, billions of dollars are are
[37:09] being made
[37:11] continually on on on the pain.
[37:16] Don't don't suffer any pain. If you got
[37:18] a headache, we got something. If you got
[37:20] a throat problem, we got something. And
[37:22] they're prescribing all kinds of
[37:24] prescription drugs because pe the the
[37:26] the whole age is we got a mentality. We
[37:30] mustn't suffer.
[37:32] We mustn't hurt. And even if you hurt
[37:34] mentally, they got medications and
[37:37] anti-depressants and all of these
[37:39] things. And if you're down, they put you
[37:41] up. And if you're too high, they can
[37:42] bring you down. And they can do all
[37:45] kinds of things with medications.
[37:48] So uh but Jesus he when this pain and
[37:54] this hurt and these things were
[37:56] happening he embraced his suffering
[37:59] and uh he he embraced not only the
[38:02] suffering he embraced the wound that he
[38:05] received at Calvary that brought a death
[38:08] but that death brought eternal life.
[38:11] Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Looking unto Jesus,
[38:16] who is the author
[38:18] and finisher of our faith,
[38:21] who for the joy that was set before him,
[38:24] endured the cross,
[38:27] despising the shame and is sat down at
[38:30] the right hand of the throne of God." He
[38:33] despised the shame. He he turned aside
[38:36] from it and and the everything that he
[38:40] had suffered.
[38:42] Out from his side
[38:45] came blood, water and spirit.
[38:51] The spirit which is the life for the
[38:54] bride of Jesus Christ. So just let the
[38:59] structure come as I'm I'm giving it to
[39:02] you. line upon line. Brother Brandham
[39:06] said in the message Mark of the Beast,
[39:08] "God opened up the side of Jesus Christ
[39:11] at Calvary and took out the bride
[39:15] out of his side." He said, "It's
[39:18] beautiful."
[39:20] &gt;&gt; So he opened up the side of Jesus at
[39:23] Calvary and took out the bride out of
[39:26] his side as he did, of course, with
[39:29] Adam.
[39:31] It's not just a bride,
[39:34] but it's a bride with a voice.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; So, the womb speaks.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say,
[39:45] "Come."
[39:47] &gt;&gt; She says something.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; And let him that heareth say, "Come."
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And let him that is a thirst come. And
[39:57] whosoever will, let him take the water
[40:00] of life freely. Our lips should say
[40:03] that. Our actions should speak that
[40:07] &gt;&gt; because our actions, as we'll learn a
[40:10] little later on, speak louder than
[40:12] words.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; More profound than words of your
[40:17] testimony is your life.
[40:21] The bride speaks the same word as he
[40:25] does as does the spirit.
[40:28] She is a word bride proving she has the
[40:32] spirit. In every church age we hear
[40:36] these words. She proves she's the bride.
[40:40] So it's not enough to say I believe in
[40:42] the message. I believe that God sent a
[40:44] prophet Malachi 4 and all of these
[40:46] things. That's wonderful. and and that's
[40:49] only you know so much uh structure but
[40:52] the the real proof of that is that we
[40:55] live that word we live that testimony
[41:00] &gt;&gt; so the bride speaks the same word as
[41:03] does the spirit she is a word bride
[41:07] proving she has the spirit in every
[41:10] church age we hear these words
[41:14] Jesus said in Luke he that heareth you
[41:18] heareth me.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; The wound speaks.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; His lips were still at Calvary, but
[41:25] Jesus continued to preach.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; He just used different instrumentality,
[41:30] but it's still Jesus Christ. I friends
[41:33] if we could just grasp and I'm trying to
[41:36] grasp it myself that God
[41:39] &gt;&gt; ordained that we would be born each one
[41:42] of us at our certain time
[41:45] and to our parents whoever they might be
[41:48] and live the life that he has caused us
[41:51] to live and meet the people and and
[41:54] finally meet him
[41:58] &gt;&gt; and to know him whom to know is life
[42:00] eternal. This was our purpose. And the
[42:03] real purpose from then on is that you
[42:05] will be you will you will be a sounding
[42:08] board. You will actually speak and be
[42:11] his voice.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; It would be something if some high
[42:17] official or government or the president
[42:19] of some nation or something says you
[42:21] know entrust you with a message. There's
[42:23] maybe millions others but we entrust you
[42:25] with this message because we know that
[42:27] you will do it. We know that you won't
[42:29] fail. We'll know that. We know that
[42:31] you'll take it and carry it.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; And we have been trusted and trusted
[42:36] with this message.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Not only to speak it,
[42:40] &gt;&gt; but to live it.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; He that heareth you heareth me, and he
[42:46] that despiseth you despiseth me, and he
[42:49] that despiseth me despiseth him that
[42:53] sent me.
[42:55] Now the wounding is a process and uh we
[43:01] might this might be all right here. Uh
[43:05] can you see that clearly? I I I try to
[43:08] use quite large text fonts for it. The
[43:13] wounding of Jesus was a process. He's
[43:17] despised
[43:19] and rejected. See, when we read Isaiah
[43:22] 53, often we just think of Calvary.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; No, this this happened long before
[43:27] Calvary.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; He was despised in his life. He was
[43:31] rejected in his lifetime and in his
[43:33] ministry. He was a man of sorrows. He
[43:36] was acquainted with sorrows. He was
[43:38] acquainted with grief. He lived it. He
[43:41] had that all the time.
[43:44] Yet we did esteem him stricken and
[43:46] smitten of God and afflicted.
[43:50] But he was wounded for our
[43:51] transgressions.
[43:54] And this pattern
[43:57] also is also true in our lives
[44:02] in the masterpiece.
[44:04] He says uh
[44:10] okay under the influence of seeing
[44:12] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[44:16] and in his vision and desired to see it
[44:21] was completed. And when it was completed
[44:25] he was so inspired by it. Now, he's
[44:28] talking about Michelangelo and the and
[44:30] the and the statue of of Moses, but he's
[44:34] tying that directly to the great
[44:38] sculpture, God himself, bringing forth
[44:42] Jesus Christ. He says, "And and and and
[44:46] uh and thought his own masterpiece
[44:49] should speak back to him." And he struck
[44:52] it across the leg and hollered, "Speak!"
[44:56] and it made a flaw on it
[44:59] and put a flaw on the image.
[45:02] He said, and this is I spoke on this
[45:05] now, but I I' I've thought of it many
[45:07] many times, and it's so contrary to what
[45:09] people normally think. And to me, the
[45:13] flaw was what made it the masterpiece.
[45:18] Maybe to the mind that might think
[45:21] different, you'd think that that spoiled
[45:24] it. No. To me, it made it what it was.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Notice notice even the the grammar,
[45:31] brother. It made it what it was because
[45:35] he was wounded before the foundation of
[45:38] the world. He was the lamb slain before
[45:41] the foundation of the world. So when he
[45:44] was here and God saw the his perfect
[45:47] image and he smoked him at Calvary, it
[45:51] made it. That's why the prophet saying
[45:53] that was that's what made it the
[45:55] masterpiece because it made it what it
[45:58] made him what it was.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He always was the redeemer.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; He struck it and hollered speak.
[46:09] He wouldn't have done. Now, if we just
[46:11] take it to Calvary
[46:13] and he's thrust through with a spear and
[46:17] Almighty God is saying, "Speak."
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus wasn't going to say hardly any
[46:25] more words.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, forgive them for they
[46:28] know not what they do." He said, "I
[46:30] thirst." Yes.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And even then when they tried to
[46:34] alleviate some of his pain and put
[46:36] vinegar to his mouth on a sponge, he
[46:38] turned it aside
[46:39] &gt;&gt; cuz even the last moment he wouldn't
[46:41] take anything to alleviate any of the
[46:44] pain. He was going for the joy that was
[46:47] set before him.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why there's such a penalty
[46:51] on mankind to reject this kind of a
[46:54] sacrifice because he was doing it
[46:57] specifically for you and I.
[47:01] And he said speak. He said he wouldn't
[47:03] have done that if he'd have thought. He
[47:06] wouldn't have done that if he'd have
[47:08] thought. But he didn't think. It was
[47:11] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[47:14] mind. Seeing there perfect before him.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to dwell on this inspiration
[47:21] for a moment. the inspiration
[47:24] uh of making uh uh the inspiration that
[47:27] God
[47:29] because he said that all inspiration is
[47:32] of God. So God is the fountain of
[47:35] inspiration.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder can God feel? Can God have
[47:42] inspiration? Can God have certain kind
[47:44] of feelings? Of course
[47:48] we're made in his image.
[47:50] uh uh it it's it's not as though
[47:53] everything is just static with him, you
[47:55] know. I mean, when when he saw his son
[47:59] Jesus Christ on earth and a voice of all
[48:02] of the universe, but a voice cries out
[48:05] of the heavens, this is my beloved son.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; God was pleased with what he saw.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; The inspiration
[48:17] of of making
[48:20] all things new.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The inspiration of starting again.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; The inspiration of a new creation.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; You following my thought?
[48:31] &gt;&gt; The inspiration and I closed last the
[48:34] last time I spoke with uh you know
[48:37] someone takes and great discoveries and
[48:40] so on. People didn't write it on a piece
[48:42] of paper and get it right the first
[48:44] time. They filled, brother Brandon was
[48:47] saying, they filled basket waste baskets
[48:49] full of of of waste paper and attempts
[48:53] to get the right formula and get the
[48:55] right design and get something to work
[48:57] the way it's supposed to. They could say
[48:59] in their mind, "This has got to work."
[49:02] &gt;&gt; But they write it all out. It's not
[49:03] working. They don't just back away and
[49:06] leave it. Otherwise, they wouldn't have
[49:07] the inspiration. They're inspired.
[49:10] They're poets. They're writers. They're
[49:12] they're scientists. There are all kinds
[49:14] of gifted people, but even gifted
[49:16] people, they don't get it right the
[49:18] first time.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; And so inventors and they keep working
[49:21] at it and working at it. And and and I
[49:24] just closed, if you remember saying
[49:28] this world,
[49:30] it's a waste basket full of crumpled
[49:33] paper.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And God, that's why he says, I'm going
[49:36] to make all things new
[49:38] &gt;&gt; and he's going to clean off this earth
[49:41] with a holy fire. Do you believe that
[49:43] &gt;&gt; he's going to clean the heavens with a
[49:46] holy fire?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, my loving brother, when the world's
[49:50] on fire, and it will be,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I want to be in God's
[49:54] &gt;&gt; bosom.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Not trusting in this world.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Behold, I make all things new. And he
[50:03] said unto me, write, for these words are
[50:06] true and faithful. I thought of the
[50:08] inspiration of taking the book of
[50:11] redemption. What a great inspiration it
[50:14] must have been. How God must have been
[50:17] uh when he began to see the end drawing
[50:20] near and the conclusion of all things
[50:22] and the lamb taking the book and the and
[50:26] the sealed book. There's things that
[50:28] have been sealed that God kept to
[50:30] himself for all of these uh uh eons of
[50:34] time, but now he's going to make it
[50:36] known. and and of tearing open and
[50:39] loosing the seals. Say, "Those things
[50:41] that I held secret, my children need to
[50:44] hear it in this age in order for them to
[50:47] be able to stand. I'm going to equip
[50:50] them."
[50:51] &gt;&gt; As brother John Andy's preached, I'll
[50:53] never leave you.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; He's not going to cease to be your
[50:58] comforter.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; He's going He's He doesn't subtract. The
[51:01] Bible doesn't talk about subtracting. It
[51:03] talks about adding. He's going to add
[51:06] whatever we need.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He's going to multiply it.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And if children, the scripture says,
[51:16] "And then if children
[51:19] were heirs, heirs of God and joint hes
[51:22] with Christ,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; if so be that we suffer with him,
[51:27] &gt;&gt; that we may be also glorified together."
[51:31] the same process that he went through.
[51:35] We must not think it's strange at the
[51:37] fiery trials that are sent to try us.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; God sends them. God allows them.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And he rejoices to see people, his
[51:49] children don't succumb to it.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Don't become defeated by it. Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; So that uh we suffer with him that we
[51:59] may also
[52:01] uh be also glorified together. For we
[52:05] have not an high priest, Paul says also
[52:08] in Hebrews 4:15, "We have not an high
[52:11] priest which cannot be touched with the
[52:14] feeling of our infirmities,
[52:17] but was in all points tempted like as we
[52:20] are, yet without sin." He was tempted in
[52:24] all points. He was despised. He was
[52:26] rejected. He was turned aside. He was
[52:29] considered smitten of God. Oh, God did
[52:32] that to you.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[52:36] &gt;&gt; He experienced all that. That's why he
[52:39] can be a high priest
[52:41] &gt;&gt; to us.
[52:45] that the trial of your faith being much
[52:49] more precious than of gold that
[52:52] perisheth, though it be tried with fire.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; There hath no temptation taken you, but
[53:04] such as is common to man. But God is
[53:08] faithful, who will not suffer you to be
[53:11] tempted. Above that you are able,
[53:15] &gt;&gt; but will with the temptation also make a
[53:18] way of escape that you may be able to
[53:21] bear it.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily escape it, but able to
[53:25] bear it.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; You know what? The bride's going to make
[53:31] it.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; She's going to make it victoriously.
[53:33] She's not going to make it by the skin
[53:35] of her teeth. She's going to make it
[53:37] absolutely victoriously.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is his promise. This is
[53:42] his word
[53:43] &gt;&gt; that you may be able to bear it.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Our life, brother Brandham says, speaks
[53:55] I'm uh rather this is not a quote. Now,
[53:58] our life speaks things after wounding
[54:04] &gt;&gt; that it could not say before
[54:07] &gt;&gt; the wounding.
[54:09] There are things that you can say after
[54:14] difficulties or
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a wounding. Now
[54:21] there are things that you can say after
[54:23] that wounding that you could not say
[54:27] before.
[54:30] Brother Bram says, "Your life speaks so
[54:33] much louder than your words. Till no
[54:36] matter what you say, people know what
[54:39] you are by what you are."
[54:45] &gt;&gt; How many recognize?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; How many have heard of Terry Fox?
[54:57] You only heard of him because of his
[54:59] wounding.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't gone through what he went
[55:06] through, you wouldn't even know his
[55:08] name.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't recognize the picture.
[55:11] Right. Right.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Terry Fox. In 1980,
[55:16] with one leg having been amputated, he
[55:19] embarked on a cross Canada run to raise
[55:22] money and awareness for cancer research.
[55:26] Though the spread of his cancer forced
[55:28] him to end his quest after 143 days,
[55:33] 5,373
[55:35] km and 3,339
[55:38] miles, and ultimately cost him his life.
[55:42] His determination and example created a
[55:46] lasting worldwide legacy. Now, I just
[55:49] want to stop there for a moment.
[55:52] He could have done a lot of other things
[55:54] when his leg was amputated.
[55:57] He could have gone to a wheelchair. He
[56:00] could have just said, "Well, I guess
[56:02] this is my life."
[56:04] He could have had the sympathy of his
[56:06] family,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; his church,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; if he has one, his friends.
[56:13] He was an athlete and he was well known
[56:17] in his local community.
[56:19] But he decided that that that he was
[56:22] going to do something
[56:25] and he was going to make this wound pay.
[56:29] Now when I say, "Do you recognize this
[56:32] fellow?" You say, "Yes." Why? And you
[56:36] say, "Well, who it is?" Most everyone
[56:38] would know that's Terry Fox. So the
[56:41] wound is speaking.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even know who it was if it
[56:45] wasn't for the wound.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:48] and the wound continued to speak. The
[56:51] annual Terry Fox run has grown to
[56:55] involve
[56:56] millions of participants in over 60
[56:59] countries
[57:00] and is now the world's largest one-day
[57:04] fundraiser for cancer research. Over 500
[57:09] million has been raised in his name.
[57:13] In 1980, Terry began the Marathon of
[57:16] Hope, a cross-country run to raise money
[57:19] for cancer research. Fox hoped to raise
[57:23] $1 for each of Canada's 24 million
[57:27] people. That was his goal to try to
[57:29] raise 24 million. He started with little
[57:33] fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland.
[57:36] In fact, is hardly ever anybody knew
[57:38] that he was starting out from St. John's
[57:41] Newfanland.
[57:43] in April and ran the equivalent of a
[57:46] full marathon every day.
[57:50] Fox had become a national star by the
[57:54] time he reached Ontario. He made
[57:57] numerous public appearances with
[57:59] businessmen, athletes, and polit
[58:02] politicians.
[58:03] In his efforts to raise money, he was
[58:06] forced to end his run outside of Thunder
[58:09] Bay, Ontario, when the cancer spread to
[58:12] his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the
[58:15] disease and completing his marathon
[58:19] ended when he died nine months later.
[58:23] Fox was the youngest person
[58:26] ever named to a companion of the Order
[58:29] of Canada the nation's highest civilian
[58:32] award. He won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award
[58:37] as the nation's top sportsman and was
[58:40] named Canada's news maker of the year in
[58:43] both 1980 and 1981.
[58:47] Considered a national hero, he has had
[58:50] many buildings, roads, and parks named
[58:55] in his honor after the country.
[58:59] He said, "Even if," these are his words,
[59:02] "Even if I don't finish, we need others
[59:06] to continue. It's got to keep going."
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That's pretty concise, isn't it? Even if
[59:13] I don't finish,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; we need others to continue.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; It's got to keep going.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, seeing we also,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now some other people
[59:27] that are running.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You might be sitting here this morning,
[59:30] but we are running
[59:32] &gt;&gt; a race
[59:33] &gt;&gt; that that that supersedes even Terry
[59:36] Fox's marathon of hope. Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; We are compassed about with so great a
[59:42] cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside
[59:45] every weight
[59:47] &gt;&gt; and the sin which doth so easily beset
[59:49] us
[59:50] &gt;&gt; and let us run with patience the race
[59:53] that is set before us.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Wonder if you can say that with me. Let
[59:57] us run the with patience the race that
[1:00:01] is set before us. Let's say it again.
[1:00:03] Let us run with patience the race that
[1:00:06] is set before us. Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; And humble thyself. The prophet said,
[1:00:14] "The people that I have tried to tell
[1:00:16] this gospel truth to and they turn their
[1:00:20] back on it and walk away and laugh at
[1:00:23] it." Now, to me, that seems like it's an
[1:00:26] insult. I don't care to me, but to the
[1:00:31] things that I've been trying I've been
[1:00:33] saying it's the truth trying to help
[1:00:36] them.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; I've been saying it's the truth trying
[1:00:40] to help them. Like like showing like
[1:00:44] shoving out a boat and say, "Here it is.
[1:00:48] Cross over here. Get out of that
[1:00:51] swelling stream. You're going to die."
[1:00:55] He said, "You're you're going to perish
[1:00:57] there." And they just laugh at you and
[1:00:59] walk away. Well, to me, it feels like if
[1:01:03] they walk away, there's nothing more I
[1:01:05] can do about it. But I can but I c that
[1:01:09] I can do. But I want to run down the
[1:01:12] bank now and persuade them.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Come on back.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I've got to have that feeling. He said,
[1:01:19] "I've got to have that feeling that he
[1:01:21] wants to run down the bank that he wants
[1:01:23] to that he wants to call out to even
[1:01:26] people that turn it aside, rejected it
[1:01:28] or rejected him and and but he knows
[1:01:31] that they're in a dangerous stream
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and they laugh at it and and think it's
[1:01:36] just nonsense. this all this divine
[1:01:39] healing or preaching that he was doing
[1:01:41] and the things that he was preaching and
[1:01:43] the manner in which he preached and the
[1:01:45] language and the grammar which he had
[1:01:48] great obstacles for a minister before
[1:01:51] tens of thousands of people but he
[1:01:54] realized that this is an eternal work
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; and even if they do and they go away and
[1:01:59] they rush back on he's going to push the
[1:02:01] boat out
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; come on back Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; While I was writing this down and
[1:02:09] setting it, I said, I'm going to say
[1:02:11] that here today maybe there is some and
[1:02:15] you're not where you ought to be. You
[1:02:17] know, you're not where you ought to be.
[1:02:19] You're in a dangerous stream.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to push the boat out
[1:02:24] and say, "Get in this boat.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Come back to this word. Come back to
[1:02:29] what you know God has spoken and God has
[1:02:31] honored.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Come on back." And I've got to have that
[1:02:36] feeling. And I can say to you today, I
[1:02:39] have that feeling. You might be out in
[1:02:42] the internet someplace or or wherever,
[1:02:44] but I'm appealing uh especially to the
[1:02:47] people that are here because you are
[1:02:49] here. I'm appealing to you. I've got
[1:02:52] that feeling.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I I I know there is no word like this
[1:02:56] word. I know there is no vindication
[1:02:59] like this vindication. It's never been
[1:03:02] in the history. Do you hear me? It's
[1:03:04] never been in the history of humanity,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; but you have access to it. You can hear
[1:03:11] it.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I was listening to the voice uh the
[1:03:16] voice of the sign,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; and I won't get to that, but I was
[1:03:20] listening to the voice of the sign. And
[1:03:23] the first person they call in the
[1:03:25] healing line, you should hear, I mean,
[1:03:28] it is so detailed. It is so it it it
[1:03:31] just compels you. It compels me to be a
[1:03:35] believer. Even if I read that one, it
[1:03:38] just so compelling. You can't have how
[1:03:41] do you have a man who's a stranger and
[1:03:43] tells such minute details of a person's
[1:03:46] life and and how things and people tried
[1:03:49] things and it failed for them and tried
[1:03:51] this and tried that and he just details
[1:03:54] the whole person's life and then tell
[1:03:55] them their name at the end.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that?
[1:04:00] See this? This is not That's a sign.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; That's a sign.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; And God said to Moses and God spoke to
[1:04:07] this prophet, if they don't believe if
[1:04:10] they don't believe the voice of the
[1:04:13] first sign, they'll believe the voice of
[1:04:15] the second sign.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's those are the sign.
[1:04:20] But now, a voice, he said, a voice comes
[1:04:22] behind the sign. Yeah,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; you can have all kinds of signs and
[1:04:26] supernatural phenomena, but if you don't
[1:04:28] have a voice behind it, he said, "Forget
[1:04:31] it."
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; But we've had a powerful sign. The
[1:04:34] world's never seen such sign as this.
[1:04:37] And then we say, we have a right to say,
[1:04:39] "What do we do with that sign? What do
[1:04:41] you do with that sign?" There's a voice
[1:04:43] that comes behind it. And not to heed.
[1:04:46] And if we fail to heed that voice, there
[1:04:48] is no hope.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; There's absolutely no hope.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another sign.
[1:04:53] You're not going to make it right in the
[1:04:55] tribulation. You're just not going to
[1:04:56] make it, friends, if we turn down this
[1:04:59] voice.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; I should have a lot more amens on that.
[1:05:22] Okay, we shut that off just now.
[1:05:37] So we have
[1:05:40] I expect it to be fairly solemn while we
[1:05:44] speak about this. We all have what we
[1:05:48] may term a flaw
[1:05:51] and flaws in our lives.
[1:05:54] And as I said to you previously, and
[1:05:57] I'll say it now again, some are allowed
[1:06:01] by God. Many are allowed by God.
[1:06:06] He will allow people to inflict them,
[1:06:10] but they're allowed by God.
[1:06:13] There are situations that you didn't
[1:06:15] invite.
[1:06:17] If you had any choice, you would do
[1:06:20] anything in your power to avoid or to
[1:06:23] escape it.
[1:06:25] I want to take the principles of Jesus
[1:06:28] life.
[1:06:30] He didn't try to escape it. He didn't
[1:06:33] try to
[1:06:36] just get some uh you know
[1:06:39] substitutionary thing to he didn't try
[1:06:41] to just take some pill.
[1:06:44] didn't try to, you know, alleviate.
[1:06:48] He just accepted it the way it was.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Accepted
[1:06:53] what life was handing him.
[1:06:56] But this is where we fail.
[1:07:00] We fail to take that wound
[1:07:03] and surrender it somehow to God
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit
[1:07:10] so that that wound here at Terry Fox can
[1:07:13] take a cancer and an amputated leg
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and and not that he become a hero that
[1:07:19] we're not attempting to become a hero
[1:07:21] but he did something
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; for humanity.
[1:07:26] Amen. He built on his wound. He took He
[1:07:30] took his wound and said, "I'm not going
[1:07:32] to succumb to this.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just not going to give into it.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it do something for
[1:07:38] me. I'm going to make it do something
[1:07:41] for people that suffer like I have
[1:07:43] suffered."
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Well, we're not in a run for a cure for
[1:07:46] cancer. We're in a run for a cure for
[1:07:49] sin.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And we have the cure for sin.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; We have the antidote. I don't care what
[1:07:56] you're bound with. I don't care what
[1:07:58] you're tempted with. I don't care what
[1:08:00] the devil has said to you. We have the
[1:08:03] cure right here today.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I have the cure right in this book. We
[1:08:09] have the cure right here in this
[1:08:10] message.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; There's been nothing left out.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said it's finished, it was
[1:08:17] finished. Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And when we have a prophet say that all
[1:08:20] the mysteries have been unveiled, then
[1:08:23] you can guarantee all the mysteries been
[1:08:25] unveiled. It's up to you and I to
[1:08:27] discover what they are.
[1:08:41] I want you to have a good look at your
[1:08:44] life.
[1:08:46] Some have
[1:08:48] it could be something as little as
[1:08:51] financial, but I don't want to speak
[1:08:52] about that.
[1:08:54] Sometimes it's from broken homes,
[1:08:58] the deepest wounds
[1:09:01] or from the loss of a loved one.
[1:09:05] These are deep wounds and they're
[1:09:06] continuing wounds
[1:09:09] and things that you kind of
[1:09:13] wake up to yourself and you find
[1:09:15] yourself thinking about it. It's in your
[1:09:16] mind. You're turning it over, turning it
[1:09:18] over. I'm going to say something to you
[1:09:21] and won't you ever forget it. That's
[1:09:23] exactly what Satan wants to try to use.
[1:09:27] He wants to get into that subconscious
[1:09:29] and use that thing and wear you down and
[1:09:32] bring you down. And then you begin to
[1:09:34] question, why did God do that? Why has
[1:09:36] God allowed this? And why am I in this
[1:09:39] situation?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I've got I've got a word for you today.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe I have a word from God for
[1:09:50] you.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You can build on top of that
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; and you can use it for the glory of God.
[1:09:56] God will use it for his glory.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have testimonies also that are
[1:10:01] seated right here of people who have
[1:10:03] faced faced insurmountable,
[1:10:07] cruel,
[1:10:09] heartbreaking, heartrening
[1:10:12] experiences,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but they kept their eyes on the goal
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and they said, "I will not be moved.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to cease from my
[1:10:21] fellowship. I'm not going to cease from
[1:10:24] my worship. I'm not going to cease from
[1:10:26] serving my God. I'm in fact is because
[1:10:30] Satan is trying to do that. I'm going to
[1:10:32] serve him more fervently.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pull out all the stops
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and I'm just going to say, Lord God,
[1:10:40] here I am.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Use me.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And we ought to say on a continual
[1:10:46] basis, what would you have me to do?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; God, what would you have me to do? I
[1:10:52] find myself in this situation. What
[1:10:54] would you have me to do? You know the
[1:10:56] dilemma. You know the pain. You know the
[1:11:00] wounding. And I don't have to relate
[1:11:03] that to you. Don't tell your neighbors.
[1:11:05] Don't get on the phone. That won't help.
[1:11:08] Talk to God about it.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? He's the
[1:11:12] only one who knows.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Are we getting anywhere?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Some of these are allowed by God.
[1:11:26] I'm going to try to take my time this
[1:11:28] morning.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Some of these
[1:11:32] are brought upon us by others.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And some others are still
[1:11:38] self-inflicted.
[1:11:40] We do things and we do silly things and
[1:11:43] we do foolish things. We do something
[1:11:47] that really brings a lot of trouble our
[1:11:50] way.
[1:11:52] And even that,
[1:11:55] even that
[1:11:57] if you surrender, you can't go back and
[1:11:59] undo it.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; So what do I do? Am I going to just
[1:12:04] wallow in it?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Am I just going to let the thing
[1:12:08] deteriorate me?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And I become an atrophied believer.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I can't move. I can't hardly speak. I'm
[1:12:16] so twisted up and so bound up with this
[1:12:18] thing.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I get bitter about it.
[1:12:22] If God does things or if this happens in
[1:12:25] the message, well, and I'm finished with
[1:12:27] it. Listen, friends, that's not the
[1:12:29] attitude.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Just say, "God, you know,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about our lives. I'm not
[1:12:36] speaking about what's happened in our
[1:12:38] church and so on." Don't get so don't
[1:12:41] get so confined to that. That's not what
[1:12:43] I'm talking about. I'm talking about our
[1:12:44] individual lives now.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:50] And so some are how however it happens,
[1:12:53] whatever took place and they do. I'm
[1:12:57] talking about real situations. I'm
[1:12:59] talking about things that you think
[1:13:00] about when you leave this building this
[1:13:02] morning. I want to send you out not a
[1:13:05] mirror with a hope, not merely with some
[1:13:07] inspiration. I want to let you know
[1:13:09] there's a message from God that God can
[1:13:12] use any kind of failure. He can use any
[1:13:15] kind of disaster. He can use it for his
[1:13:18] glory. and the the attitude that you and
[1:13:20] I must have a say within your heart and
[1:13:23] soul. I am going to build on that. If
[1:13:25] Terry Fox can do what he does and I've
[1:13:27] got some others I want to bring to you
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to waste my life.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You know, Bill Gates was the most
[1:13:40] wealthiest man in the world apparently.
[1:13:43] some say worth about $50 billion.
[1:13:48] But he realized
[1:13:51] in his own way he realized that this
[1:13:54] isn't life. This isn't what life is made
[1:13:56] up of. So he resigned and left his uh uh
[1:14:02] Microsoft
[1:14:04] and uh his partner became the head CEO
[1:14:09] and he he said it simply I'm done trying
[1:14:12] to make it now I'm going to spend the
[1:14:14] rest of my life I and my wife giving it
[1:14:16] away
[1:14:18] and are trying to do great things in
[1:14:20] Africa and do things just in the news
[1:14:22] recently that he wants to do things for
[1:14:25] the educational system and in and United
[1:14:28] States and other parts of the world. And
[1:14:31] he talked about his children. He said he
[1:14:33] intends to give most of it away and just
[1:14:36] leave enough for his children to be well
[1:14:39] cared for. He's not going to leave them
[1:14:41] as billionaires.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; He has another vision. I respect him for
[1:14:46] that.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I read quite a bit about what he may do.
[1:14:50] something and and and there's nothing I
[1:14:53] would say extra spiritual special about
[1:14:56] his decision. He just realizes the
[1:14:58] emptiness of just having shares and
[1:15:02] you're worth billions. Who cares?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Where's it going to what what what's it
[1:15:08] going to mean?
[1:15:10] You believe in the beyond the curtain of
[1:15:11] time.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? One moment on the
[1:15:16] other side.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Zero.
[1:15:19] zero.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So why should we spend all of our
[1:15:22] energies
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; focused all on this life? What we can
[1:15:26] get and what we can achieve? If God
[1:15:28] gives it to you, fine. Use it for his
[1:15:30] kingdom.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have it, serve him
[1:15:33] anyway.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; But why why spending our time and all of
[1:15:37] our life and sapping up all our energy?
[1:15:39] I'm not talking about not working when
[1:15:41] you're working. But you got your focus
[1:15:43] on the kingdom of God. You got your
[1:15:45] focus on the things that have reality to
[1:15:48] them,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; We allow God to use it. In Acts,
[1:16:01] the Bible says, "And when they had laid
[1:16:03] many stripes," I have I have a lot of
[1:16:05] examples,
[1:16:07] spiritual and and and
[1:16:10] uh out of human life as well. And when
[1:16:13] they had laid many stripes upon them,
[1:16:16] we're not reading a story book. We're
[1:16:17] talking about two of our friends,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:16:24] them, if it was two of our brothers that
[1:16:26] were here that were just in this
[1:16:28] situation, say, "Well, last night they
[1:16:30] took and and and subjected these men to
[1:16:34] stripes and they whipped them."
[1:16:38] We'd feel differently about it. Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; This is two of our brothers. And they
[1:16:43] cast them into prison, charging the
[1:16:45] jailer to keep them safely, who having
[1:16:48] received such a charge, he thrust them
[1:16:51] into the inner prison, probably like uh
[1:16:55] isolation or and made their feet fast in
[1:16:59] the stalks. And at midnight, Paul and
[1:17:03] Silas prayed.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; They didn't succumb to it or hands. How
[1:17:09] are you, Silas? Oh, I'm all right. My my
[1:17:12] feet are hurting. These stripes are
[1:17:14] starting to really sting and and with
[1:17:16] the blood uh you know coagulating on our
[1:17:21] backs and oh,
[1:17:23] you think we could have avoided this?
[1:17:25] You think we could have done something
[1:17:27] different? Or do you think we we upset
[1:17:30] the people? No. They prayed and began to
[1:17:33] sing.
[1:17:36] Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And they sang praises to God and the
[1:17:43] prisoners heard them.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God turned them loose
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; supernaturally from the thing that they
[1:17:51] were in.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible speaks
[1:17:58] that they could have, you know, said,
[1:17:59] "Well, how how did this happen? What
[1:18:01] happened? my family or my relatives or
[1:18:05] my children or my husband or my wife or
[1:18:08] what I'm just I'm just take I'm just
[1:18:10] taking a broad brush.
[1:18:13] I don't care what the circumstance is.
[1:18:16] It's it's it just doesn't mean anything
[1:18:20] to me for this service. We either have a
[1:18:23] God who's absolutely in control
[1:18:28] Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I'm just looking down seeing brother
[1:18:34] Ryan and Sister Yolena and how her
[1:18:37] father was turned down and I prayed
[1:18:40] about that. I prayed before and I prayed
[1:18:43] after said Elena
[1:18:46] that brother Nino I I I thought it's so
[1:18:48] cruel that he can't get to maybe be with
[1:18:52] his children in church or go with his
[1:18:54] wife and so on and this is years
[1:18:58] years
[1:19:00] and no doubt he could be sitting home
[1:19:02] this morning just saying why is this now
[1:19:05] I don't have another appointment till
[1:19:06] next April they just told me to go home
[1:19:10] and there's nothing no word and these
[1:19:13] are the authorities
[1:19:15] I can tell you I can tell you they could
[1:19:18] answer that man's problem in 10 minutes
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; right that's right
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; and it goes for year after year after
[1:19:24] year that thing because this is Satan's
[1:19:28] Eden. Don't forget it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have a good time in
[1:19:32] Satan's Eden.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; But you're going to have a victorious
[1:19:35] time because the power of the Holy
[1:19:38] Spirit is greater than anything in this
[1:19:40] present evil age.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And somehow, Sister Elena, you take a
[1:19:45] message to your dad. Somehow
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; God will turn this thing around.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; God will get glory out of it.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; He just needs to surrender it and yield
[1:19:55] it to God. say, "Well, you know, Lord,
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says, I'm sorry, the
[1:20:00] message is saying in harvest time when
[1:20:04] God saw that perfect one, now he's
[1:20:07] perfect one. He didn't bring anything
[1:20:10] upon himself. He didn't he not a thing
[1:20:14] that he did. He He was without sin. He
[1:20:18] was the perfect one. And he struck him
[1:20:20] and marred him."
[1:20:23] And Isaiah said he was wounded for the
[1:20:26] transgressions for our transgressions
[1:20:28] and bruised for our iniquities. In the
[1:20:31] identified masterpiece of God, he said
[1:20:34] there was a perfect masterpiece and God
[1:20:37] smote it. What an example it was. He
[1:20:40] said God smote him for us. That's what
[1:20:43] makes him the perfect masterpiece.
[1:20:47] Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The thing that you
[1:20:51] you you can h you you you can excuse me
[1:20:54] for just I'm I'm trying to be very
[1:20:55] careful with my words, but you have a
[1:20:58] choice on what you do with your life.
[1:21:02] You can either simply give in and
[1:21:05] succumb to events, etc.
[1:21:08] We've had a brother may be sitting here,
[1:21:11] brother John, and he's been without his
[1:21:14] wife and children for over eight years,
[1:21:20] held up in the legal
[1:21:23] hassle and the just complete
[1:21:26] incompetence
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; of our system
[1:21:30] and the and a man is without his f.
[1:21:33] Isn't there any Isn't there any common
[1:21:35] sense?
[1:21:37] A man is without his family.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Surely there's a way that he could be
[1:21:42] with his family.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Even if they came to visit or whatever
[1:21:46] more. You understand?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, there may be complications and
[1:21:53] sections and this and that and the other
[1:21:54] thing." Listen friends, all of the laws
[1:21:57] and the government and everything are
[1:21:59] for the betterment of humanity, not for
[1:22:01] the oppression of humanity.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to unload
[1:22:17] People have been smitten and people have
[1:22:19] been wounded and people have been hurt.
[1:22:24] Even with Jesus Christ, man was
[1:22:27] permitted to wound him to mar and to
[1:22:30] slay the Lord Jesus Christ. But it was
[1:22:34] God
[1:22:35] that smokeote him in allowing it. He was
[1:22:39] God's lamb.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; God raised him up to die.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And God allowed people to do this.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; God raised you up.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; God gave you birth
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; and raised you up
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; and brought you right to this present
[1:22:56] time
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; for what purpose? merely to do some
[1:23:01] housework or to work at a job or to get
[1:23:05] an education or or what is the purpose?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Why are we here?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Is that a good question?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said if we need to go to
[1:23:14] him who brought us here and ask him what
[1:23:16] he wants us to do.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; We ask our employer
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; because we want to do a good job. We ask
[1:23:24] who we work for, what would you like me
[1:23:26] to do? What is my task? What is my job
[1:23:29] description? That's normal. But it
[1:23:32] wasn't our employer that brought us
[1:23:34] here. It was God who brought us here.
[1:23:36] What do you want me to do?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not a I'm not against education. The
[1:23:41] the more education you have, perhaps the
[1:23:44] greater opportunity you have. But don't
[1:23:46] serve that as a god.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Don't serve your job as a god.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; They're not gods. They they will try to
[1:23:54] Satan will try to control you through
[1:23:57] economics,
[1:23:58] through education, through science,
[1:24:00] through civilization. He'll try to
[1:24:02] control it maybe through sports. Don't
[1:24:04] tell me that sports isn't controlling.
[1:24:06] It's controlling millions.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Not only millions of sports people, it's
[1:24:11] controlling untold tens of millions of
[1:24:14] viewers.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; It tells you what you're going to do at
[1:24:17] a certain hour of the day. you're going
[1:24:19] to be sitting in front of some
[1:24:20] television or whatever more or in front
[1:24:22] of the radio, you wouldn't miss that for
[1:24:25] anything.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Who's telling you to do that? Not God
[1:24:28] Almighty.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying there's anything
[1:24:31] sinful. Maybe say hearing a a baseball
[1:24:34] game or a hockey game or something. I'm
[1:24:36] not saying that that's sinful. I'm just
[1:24:38] saying that we need to have God in
[1:24:40] preeminence.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] Now, when brother Brandon was describing
[1:24:56] Michelangelo and the statue,
[1:24:59] he struck the masterpiece. And I I
[1:25:01] emphasized that two weeks ago and
[1:25:03] created the flaw. Brother Brandham said
[1:25:06] it was the flaw that made it the
[1:25:08] masterpiece. But now I'm on the second
[1:25:10] part of that. It was he he was so
[1:25:13] inspired that when he saw what was in
[1:25:16] his mind,
[1:25:18] he struck it and cried out, "Speak."
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That was what was to follow.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; You happen to be the speech
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; of this message.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; You're the interpretation. People are
[1:25:35] reading you that will never pick up a
[1:25:37] message book,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; but they're reading you. And because of
[1:25:40] your life, they may well then pick one
[1:25:42] up
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; and may may well enter into eternal life
[1:25:46] by your life.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; If I gave you the choice today,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing all of you
[1:25:57] and we're here together. We're in this
[1:26:00] together. Would you sooner souls into
[1:26:03] eternal life or would you sooner towards
[1:26:06] condemnation and guilt and damnation?
[1:26:11] Even in this life, I mean, we can say,
[1:26:13] well, we believe in predestination.
[1:26:14] Indeed, we do.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; But we don't necessarily believe all the
[1:26:18] things that have to happen. All the
[1:26:21] things that do happen have to happen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; You can save your life from many wounds
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; and many hurts.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Receive Christ early. True.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; So the flaw spoke back
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; when he struck him at Calvary.
[1:26:45] Speak.
[1:26:47] The flaw spoke back.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; The wound
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; had a voice.
[1:26:54] Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; That life from that broken blood cell,
[1:27:00] it was broken. The new creation of God,
[1:27:04] that blood cell that attached itself
[1:27:08] into the womb of Mary, a virgin. That
[1:27:11] blood cell now was broken by God
[1:27:13] himself. God who put it together and
[1:27:16] wrote it and had it spoken by uh
[1:27:20] prophets. And it brother Brandon says it
[1:27:22] was the words of the prophets that
[1:27:25] fastened or attached themselves
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And now God breaks that blood cell so
[1:27:34] that the life from that one can go out
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; from his side.
[1:27:42] The blood cell was broken.
[1:27:45] And I will say it, it was broken to give
[1:27:47] the flaw a voice, to give the wound a
[1:27:51] voice.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And the blood cell spoke back.
[1:27:56] The blood cell said things that wasn't
[1:27:59] necessarily an audible voice, but but
[1:28:02] but the broken blood cell, the wound
[1:28:05] spoke and said, "Redemption is
[1:28:08] finished." Yes.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; The wound spoke and said, "The family,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; the family, no wonder he could say over
[1:28:20] in Hebrews,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; behold, I and the children,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; thou hast given me."
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; What could say that? Jesus didn't say
[1:28:28] that while he was in life. There's
[1:28:30] things that the voice of the womb spoke
[1:28:32] after.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul picks it up, sir. And
[1:28:37] he picks it up and he brings it from the
[1:28:39] Old Testament. Behold, I What is that?
[1:28:41] That was the wound that was speaking.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; As Terry Fox said things after the
[1:28:48] wound, he couldn't say those before the
[1:28:50] wound as a healthy young strapping young
[1:28:52] man. He could never have he could never
[1:28:55] have earned 500 million for cancer
[1:28:57] research. The world wouldn't have known
[1:28:59] him. He wouldn't have had all the
[1:29:01] adoration and all all the honor and
[1:29:04] streets named after him, etc. No, that
[1:29:07] was because of the wound.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; He did something with the wound.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; God has allowed us.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; I say that whatever your life is, God
[1:29:15] has allowed it.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; You might be going down easy street. You
[1:29:19] might say, "Hey, I don't know what
[1:29:20] you're talking about, Brother Ed. I I I
[1:29:22] I never tasted any of those things."
[1:29:24] Well, you'll remember this message
[1:29:26] someday.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Now I know what he was talking
[1:29:29] about. Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I told you I'm really going to, you
[1:29:36] know, unload.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes even believers, they start to
[1:29:41] be pained
[1:29:43] and the pain of their wound
[1:29:47] and the marring is so
[1:29:50] the suffering is so great
[1:29:53] that we can get
[1:29:56] ourselves all medicated up.
[1:29:59] so that we don't even live in the real
[1:30:01] world
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; because it's the real world that's too
[1:30:09] painful. It is
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; it is a the real world is a painful
[1:30:14] place.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; But we won't get ourselves and give
[1:30:21] ourselves.
[1:30:24] I've gone and talked to people more than
[1:30:26] once.
[1:30:29] People who were born in believers homes
[1:30:32] and heard the message and sat in this
[1:30:34] church and heard it. I've gone to the
[1:30:36] psychiatric ward
[1:30:39] in the hospital to visit them
[1:30:43] and are all dazed
[1:30:46] trying to focus with their eyes.
[1:30:51] And I said
[1:30:53] I said to one person, "You don't belong
[1:30:56] here.
[1:30:58] These people here and the medical staff,
[1:31:01] they might be able to help these people
[1:31:02] that are walking around.
[1:31:06] Maybe you haven't been there. Brother
[1:31:09] Ed's been there. They're walking around
[1:31:13] and one nurse chas chasing a fellow with
[1:31:16] a hypodermic needle and he's yelling,
[1:31:19] "No, no, he's just going wild. A great
[1:31:22] big man cuz he doesn't want it."
[1:31:25] She has to give it to him to quieten him
[1:31:27] down. Maybe he's a violent man. I don't
[1:31:30] know. I tell you, this world hasn't got
[1:31:34] a remedy for anything that God allows us
[1:31:37] to go through. If God allows us to go
[1:31:39] through something, he's got a remedy for
[1:31:41] it. And furthermore, he wants to glorify
[1:31:44] himself with it.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Don't simply succumb to it and say,
[1:31:48] "Well, I guess that's the way it is."
[1:31:50] That's not the way it is. God can take
[1:31:52] that and glorify himself with it.
[1:32:14] behold I and the children God hath given
[1:32:16] me.
[1:32:21] And the Godhead explained, he said,
[1:32:23] "When the blood cell was broke, it
[1:32:26] wasn't merely a man.
[1:32:28] That was God's life was released.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; If you have received
[1:32:36] the life from Jesus Christ,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; it is not the life of a man. You have
[1:32:41] received God's life,
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; divine life,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; divinity.
[1:32:49] And when the blood cell was broke in
[1:32:51] Jesus Christ, he said again, God was
[1:32:54] released. He was God. That blood wasn't
[1:32:57] Jewish. That blood wasn't Gentile. That
[1:33:01] was a creative blood cell. God himself.
[1:33:05] It's still a creative blood cell.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And I think I touched on this, maybe
[1:33:19] just mentioned it, but I want to take it
[1:33:22] a little bit further.
[1:33:24] When God
[1:33:26] saw that masterpiece
[1:33:28] and it was so perfect, it was just the
[1:33:30] image of what he had in his mind.
[1:33:33] Couldn't have been entirely just Jesus
[1:33:35] Christ.
[1:33:37] Because even when God had a son here on
[1:33:40] earth in the form of Adam,
[1:33:43] he said, "It's good. It's very good."
[1:33:46] And then he took his rest.
[1:33:48] But when Eve,
[1:33:50] Eve, it was so perfect. But he brought
[1:33:54] Eve out of Adam because there had to be
[1:33:58] that family. That what was Satan
[1:34:01] destroyed in the beginning. And so now
[1:34:05] when God saw Christ and he smote him at
[1:34:08] Calvary,
[1:34:13] it wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just
[1:34:16] that he was smiting Christ at Calvary,
[1:34:19] but he was looking beyond the physical
[1:34:22] body of Jesus Christ. He was looking
[1:34:25] beyond that. He was looking at the Do
[1:34:28] you know what was happening? Satan's
[1:34:31] head was being crushed by the seed of
[1:34:34] the woman. He was seeing Satan's head
[1:34:37] crushed. He was saying seeing the
[1:34:39] believers down through the ages
[1:34:42] defeating the enemy. He could see the
[1:34:44] martyrs going to the martyrdom and not
[1:34:48] bowing to it, not bowing to the system.
[1:34:51] He saw the bride of Jesus Christ, right?
[1:34:54] He saw a seventh messenger coming. He
[1:34:57] saw a prophet coming
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; with a voice. He saw someone taking the
[1:35:02] the the book that had been sealed. All
[1:35:05] of that. He could see all of that. That
[1:35:07] was that's it was such inspiration to
[1:35:10] him.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; I think would inspire.
[1:35:21] I really do. As I pondered this and as I
[1:35:24] prayed about this subject,
[1:35:26] I could see God seeing people
[1:35:31] where, you know, it'll almost be a
[1:35:32] privilege to live in a martyr age
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; and they were anointed for it.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And they didn't run away from it. He
[1:35:39] said they ran to it
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; because that was the anointing that was
[1:35:42] on them. They ran to it.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; We've got a much more difficult age. It
[1:35:46] would be it would be simpler say uh uh
[1:35:50] deny that or deny that or you go to the
[1:35:54] chamber whatever more you say well no
[1:35:57] I'm not going to deny it and do what you
[1:35:59] wish to do
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; but this age this is far more subtle
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; just well you know you know what's so
[1:36:10] subtle about this age is because Satan
[1:36:13] can accept the fact that a pe a a person
[1:36:17] is almost a believer.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I identify with it. I go to church. I
[1:36:24] sing all the same songs and and I'm
[1:36:28] almost a believer.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And I confess to be a believer, but
[1:36:33] somehow the life and the testimony are
[1:36:35] two different things.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "Our life is
[1:36:39] speaking so loud in heaven that he can't
[1:36:42] hear the words.
[1:36:44] Preaching.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; So now it's what is lived, the life that
[1:36:51] is lived. And God saw, friends, we talk
[1:36:56] about bride, bride, bride. God saw the
[1:36:58] bride.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; God saw her.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; God saw who was coming through the
[1:37:03] gates. God saw all that. And I believe
[1:37:06] that it was the whole scene that God saw
[1:37:10] that his arc enemy was finished. His
[1:37:14] head was crushed. His deceit and
[1:37:17] deceiving in the garden is finished. And
[1:37:20] out from this sacrifice, out from this
[1:37:23] wound is going to come a whole host of
[1:37:27] witnesses.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And they're going to declare
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; as their savior. They're going to
[1:37:33] declare this sacrifice as their
[1:37:36] atonement. They're going to declare it
[1:37:38] openly and boldly. Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And that inspiration when he saw that
[1:37:45] perfect image, that inspiration caused
[1:37:48] him to strike it
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and blood and water came forth and
[1:37:53] spirit.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to, you know, feel
[1:38:02] as though I'm
[1:38:06] zeroing in on just this congregation.
[1:38:09] Not at all. Brother Brandham said all
[1:38:11] the prophets had flaws.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Just as well that we admit, you know, we
[1:38:17] got flaws.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I talked a little bit about the sticky
[1:38:21] nature, but uh I I don't want to dwell
[1:38:23] on that. But he said all the prophets
[1:38:26] had flaws.
[1:38:28] And regardless of the flaw that we may
[1:38:30] carry, God will turn it to his glory and
[1:38:35] to your victory
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; if you just yield it to him. Yes,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can I yield it to
[1:38:45] him?" By yielding yourself to him.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Yield yourself to him and be in full
[1:38:50] preparation for an answer from God. When
[1:38:53] a person fully surrenders themselves,
[1:38:55] I'm here to be a testimony to this. I
[1:38:59] don't have that many years. We don't
[1:39:01] have that many days. We don't know what
[1:39:03] tomorrow holds. I'm here to be a voice.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; To give voice to that wound.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; There was a man that was born blind.
[1:39:24] That's quite an impediment.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Born blind.
[1:39:31] And the disciples
[1:39:33] asked Jesus saying, "Master, who did
[1:39:36] send?
[1:39:38] This man or his parents
[1:39:42] that he was born blind?"
[1:39:44] There's got to be some reason,
[1:39:47] something that we could mentally grasp
[1:39:49] in our mind. Why is this man born blind?
[1:39:53] Just think of it, friends.
[1:39:55] Sight is so precious
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; to see the beauty and the flowers and
[1:40:00] all of the things and and the creation.
[1:40:03] How marvelous it is. But you're born
[1:40:04] blind,
[1:40:09] lived in a dark world for years and
[1:40:12] years and years, grew up with friends
[1:40:15] and never saw their face.
[1:40:19] born blind. Who sinned? The man or his
[1:40:24] parents? There's got to be a reasonable
[1:40:26] answer.
[1:40:28] Some place to nail the guilt,
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; the responsibility for this. And Jesus
[1:40:35] said, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor
[1:40:38] his parents, but that the works of God
[1:40:42] should be made manifest in him."
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; That God would get the glory. You know
[1:40:47] what friends? You know the problem even
[1:40:49] in this message? People don't understand
[1:40:51] God.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; How do you understand that kind of God?
[1:40:55] This man been born blind.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Wasn't even a a a demon apparently
[1:41:01] because God allowed it
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; for that moment.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; So that Jesus Christ could get glory and
[1:41:08] give him his sight.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, was that worth it? Is
[1:41:12] that the kind of God?" Yeah, that's the
[1:41:14] kind of God we serve. Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; And God was glorified
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; and the man was healed.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; What a wound he carried.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; What a flaw
[1:41:29] all through his life.
[1:41:34] Somehow if I'm I I could dwell on all of
[1:41:36] these but
[1:41:38] uh
[1:41:40] brother Brandham said that I believe
[1:41:42] that every bornagain member of the body
[1:41:45] of Christ
[1:41:47] every member of the body of Christ is a
[1:41:51] paradox in themselves. Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You know a paradox, what a paradox is is
[1:41:57] unbelievable yet but but might be true
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; because something happened to you that
[1:42:02] changed your whole being and anyone
[1:42:04] could look at that and know that what a
[1:42:07] paradox is is a miracle. Unless that
[1:42:10] happens, you cannot be a Christian.
[1:42:13] There must be a paradox for you to
[1:42:15] become a Christian because no one can
[1:42:17] change the spirit in a man and give him
[1:42:20] a new birth.
[1:42:22] coming here to church or shaking the
[1:42:24] right hand or none none of that will
[1:42:26] give you new birth outside of God. God
[1:42:28] alone is the only one that could do it.
[1:42:31] And is a miracle how that God can take a
[1:42:34] man's thinking and his ways and his life
[1:42:37] and everything and change it from what
[1:42:39] it was to what it can be.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; What he can make it
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; a paradox. It's a situation that seems
[1:42:49] to be absurd or contradictory, but in
[1:42:53] fact
[1:42:56] it is or may be true.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Our lives are a contradiction. A
[1:43:01] believer is a contradiction
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; in this generation. And I
[1:43:10] so there are all kinds of wounds, scars,
[1:43:13] marring, emotional, there's complexes
[1:43:18] and uh
[1:43:21] he said pray that God will place into my
[1:43:23] heart. Brother Brand was saying standing
[1:43:25] in a gap, pray that God will place into
[1:43:29] my heart that something that I lost out
[1:43:31] there in that complex. It's so easy to
[1:43:35] build a complex.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; That's true, Lord.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to build a complex. I'm
[1:43:42] saying that to this congregation and the
[1:43:44] listening congregation today because we
[1:43:46] don't want that to afflict our lives.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You get build up a certain feeling and
[1:43:52] it's a complex. And brother Brandham
[1:43:55] built up a feeling and he had he had
[1:43:57] this complex.
[1:44:00] Uh sometimes it can be
[1:44:05] from
[1:44:07] brother Bram said now the genes and the
[1:44:10] father and the mother of this boy he's
[1:44:12] talking about a young man and a young
[1:44:14] man wanted to get married
[1:44:17] to a girl.
[1:44:19] So he said the genes in the father
[1:44:21] mother this boy he said no matter how
[1:44:23] much they are converted
[1:44:25] still remains the flesh that's been
[1:44:27] interbred out into to to this boy.
[1:44:31] Therefore the boy has has got a complex
[1:44:34] in him just like from his mother's
[1:44:37] family and they are not forgiving. They
[1:44:40] will not apologize. And that's where
[1:44:43] that boy stands. He says, you know,
[1:44:47] because he he had an attraction to this
[1:44:50] young lady and then did something. They
[1:44:52] don't go into any detail. Did something
[1:44:54] just left her high and dry and walked
[1:44:56] away and brother Brandon as a prophet
[1:45:01] nails it bat and says that's because he
[1:45:02] has a complex and he goes and describes
[1:45:05] the mother and father and the father was
[1:45:08] an Irishman and the mother was a German.
[1:45:10] And he says, you know, the one family,
[1:45:13] uh, they're wild and their fathers are
[1:45:15] wild and they're drunkards and they're
[1:45:18] they're shooting and everything. They're
[1:45:19] just a wild bunch. And the mother is a
[1:45:22] different person. They're just they just
[1:45:24] stare. They will never forgive or they
[1:45:28] it's hard for them to apologize and a
[1:45:31] completely different nature. And he says
[1:45:33] the boy is a complex. It was in the
[1:45:35] genes of the parents. It came down to
[1:45:38] him. Oh, there he is, friends. Some of
[1:45:40] you young fellas, young ladies,
[1:45:43] maybe maybe you're going through
[1:45:45] something and it actually came down to
[1:45:47] you.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Came down to you.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; So you say, well,
[1:45:57] I am the way I am because of maybe my
[1:45:59] parents. Yeah, that's what he said.
[1:46:03] We said, now what do we do?
[1:46:07] You better surrender it to God or you're
[1:46:09] going to carry it all your life.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And you can surrender it to God. Don't
[1:46:15] sit here just looking at me.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You can surrender. There isn't anything
[1:46:21] that God God knew exactly what you would
[1:46:25] experience in your life. He knew
[1:46:26] precisely the home you'd come from. He
[1:46:29] knew precisely everything you would
[1:46:31] experience in life. everything
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; and things you don't want to even talk
[1:46:37] about, things that you've heard, things
[1:46:38] that are in the back of your mind and
[1:46:40] you don't want to even express, you
[1:46:42] cannot express. Sometimes they're so
[1:46:43] deep they can't get it out.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:47:04] He said, "Don't ever build up a complex.
[1:47:08] Lacking the Holy Spirit can cause a
[1:47:10] complex."
[1:47:14] Brother Brandon talks about a young man
[1:47:16] in the church right when he was speaking
[1:47:17] and he was a minister.
[1:47:20] He was sitting there and a pastor of a
[1:47:22] church. But he said when he was a young
[1:47:24] man, he came to my house
[1:47:26] and he had a complex but he said I saw
[1:47:29] the potentials in him
[1:47:32] and from a fine Bible institution but he
[1:47:35] just he but just he lacked what Moses
[1:47:38] lacked and that was the what the burning
[1:47:40] bush had. No, we we can have good people
[1:47:44] sitting here in the in the congregation
[1:47:46] this morning. I want to tell you we we
[1:47:49] need something more than good people.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; We need Holy Ghost fil people.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Holy Don't settle for anything less.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; If you don't know you have the Holy
[1:47:59] Ghost and stop at nothing
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost will start to
[1:48:03] live a life through you that's not your
[1:48:06] life. It's another it's a life from
[1:48:08] another world. Life from another place.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I know. I've been quite a while, but are
[1:48:17] you you still listening?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip some of this. I talked
[1:48:30] about Moses
[1:48:32] a couple weeks ago and he his impediment
[1:48:35] and brother Brandham said that he had a
[1:48:38] besetting sin. It was his temper.
[1:48:42] He says that in the message just in case
[1:48:44] you're want wanting to know Israel in
[1:48:46] the church
[1:48:48] and he said but you know it's amazing I
[1:48:52] I just want to take the time. He said he
[1:48:54] was raised a peculiar life
[1:48:57] but God had his hand on him.
[1:49:00] How he was hid in the bull rush born in
[1:49:03] a time of persecution just like Christ.
[1:49:08] born a proper child just like Christ. He
[1:49:12] was born in this world to be a deliverer
[1:49:15] just like Christ. And oh how he his work
[1:49:20] how he was a lawgiver went up into the
[1:49:23] mountain stayed for 40 days came back
[1:49:26] down with the law and he his besetting
[1:49:30] sin was temper and he broke the
[1:49:32] commandments
[1:49:34] cast them down onto the earth when he
[1:49:36] saw what the people were doing. You
[1:49:38] renegades
[1:49:40] and he cast it down and that was his
[1:49:42] besetting sin. But that didn't change
[1:49:45] anything about him. He still was Moses
[1:49:48] and he was he came at the right time.
[1:49:50] You came at the right time.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; He was who he was. You are who you are.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And all he needed was an experience. All
[1:49:58] he needed was to stand in front of the
[1:50:00] burning bush
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; and hear a voice.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; I'm the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:50:08] Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And he start to live a different life
[1:50:14] after that. had been 40 years there.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to turn I'm going to just
[1:50:22] index this around. Be patient with me,
[1:50:24] would you?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he tells life story
[1:50:34] about 10 or more times.
[1:50:39] And I I I get extremely moved when I
[1:50:42] read life story. I remember the first
[1:50:44] time I read it, I was I think 18 years
[1:50:47] old and I just I was completely overcome
[1:50:52] and I literally wallowed on my bed. If
[1:50:56] you young fellas haven't read, you young
[1:50:59] ladies haven't read, you want to get and
[1:51:01] read life story
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; and know that that God is not back
[1:51:07] there. That God is right here
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; speaking to you, dealing with you.
[1:51:13] I just tell you my own experience. I
[1:51:14] don't mind saying it. Brother Bram says
[1:51:17] sometimes I I'm I'm like a baby, you
[1:51:20] know, because he was crying. I was
[1:51:23] reading life story because it fit into
[1:51:24] part of this message which I'm coming to
[1:51:26] now. And I had to stop.
[1:51:29] I just had to stop. I was so broken up.
[1:51:34] And then my whole life come before me.
[1:51:37] I tell you God, God knows how to speak
[1:51:39] to a person.
[1:51:47] He's talking about
[1:51:49] he met some people and now brother
[1:51:53] Brandham is a young man he just got
[1:51:55] married to Hope and he goes to tell
[1:51:58] Hope's mother
[1:52:00] and he says and that didn't work so good
[1:52:04] and she said William
[1:52:07] she said she's your wife
[1:52:09] you may take her if you want to but I
[1:52:12] but said I don't want my daughter drugg
[1:52:16] out among that bunch of trash
[1:52:20] brother Brad says h trash
[1:52:24] friends I found out this that what she
[1:52:28] thought was trash
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; is the cream of the crop
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and that's right I say that with respect
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; friend he said the little girl that was
[1:52:41] too good to be with that trash. I buried
[1:52:44] her
[1:52:46] just a little after that.
[1:52:49] Sorrow set in right there. He never said
[1:52:53] sorrow ended there. He said sorrow
[1:52:56] started right there. That's where it set
[1:52:59] in.
[1:53:05] He had walked in to the hospital. This
[1:53:08] is just within a few months of that
[1:53:10] trash.
[1:53:12] And because of his mother-in-law called
[1:53:16] these people trash and I don't want you
[1:53:18] to drag my daughter down there. She's
[1:53:20] your wife and you can do it, but I don't
[1:53:22] want her down there with those
[1:53:23] screaming, hollering people. And so he
[1:53:27] didn't do it. He didn't take her down
[1:53:29] there.
[1:53:31] And now his wife's in the hospital
[1:53:35] and Samadair said, "Don't go in there.
[1:53:38] She's she's going."
[1:53:40] And he he said, "I pulled I pulled the
[1:53:42] door behind me. I looked over there. She
[1:53:46] had real dark eyes and black hair.
[1:53:50] German girl. She was all doubled up like
[1:53:53] this. And I looked down upon her and
[1:53:56] just as still, I put my hand on her
[1:53:59] forehead and it was real sticky. Didn't
[1:54:02] look like she had any life. I put my
[1:54:06] hand over on her head and said, "Oh,
[1:54:08] God."
[1:54:10] Now he's praying. "Oh, God." I said,
[1:54:13] "That's my baby's mother. Let me let me
[1:54:18] tell her goodbye.
[1:54:20] Will you do it, Lord? Let me tell her
[1:54:23] goodbye.
[1:54:25] I don't want her to go without telling
[1:54:27] her goodbye. Will you help me, dear God?
[1:54:32] If there's forgiveness in your great
[1:54:34] heart, now he had a reason for saying
[1:54:36] that. If there is forgiveness in your
[1:54:39] great heart,
[1:54:41] will you just let me say goodbye to her?
[1:54:44] Said her head moved and I looked down.
[1:54:48] And if I live a hundred years,
[1:54:52] I'll never forget those big dark eyes
[1:54:55] looked at me.
[1:55:00] That's his wife. And immediately after,
[1:55:03] he's going to his daughter's bedside.
[1:55:06] And he's up beside her bedside. And he
[1:55:09] says, and I said, "Do you know Daddy,
[1:55:11] honey?"
[1:55:13] And her little lips trying to speak to
[1:55:16] me like this. goo to me and they were
[1:55:20] quivering.
[1:55:22] She's a dying. I put my hand over on her
[1:55:25] and I said, "Oh God,"
[1:55:28] same words, "Oh God, please God, don't
[1:55:32] take her. You took my wife,
[1:55:36] you took my daddy, and you've took." And
[1:55:39] he broke. "Oh, God, isn't there
[1:55:42] forgiveness in your great heart?" I
[1:55:45] said, "Please, dear God, please spare my
[1:55:49] baby."
[1:55:52] I thought, and I said, "Won't you do it,
[1:55:55] Lord?" Just looked like a black sheet
[1:55:58] began to unfold coming down. And oh, I
[1:56:01] knew I knowed she was gone. And I looked
[1:56:05] at her. He said, "Oh my, if I had it to
[1:56:11] live over again, they would never they
[1:56:15] would never be trash."
[1:56:18] See where he went right back to?
[1:56:22] He knew in his heart that God was taking
[1:56:26] these
[1:56:28] his wife and his baby and he's praying,
[1:56:32] "Please forgive me."
[1:56:35] He said, "I'd never, if I could do it
[1:56:37] again,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; I'd never let them be trash."
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; When I read that,
[1:56:45] I'm just Brother Ed Biscll up here today
[1:56:48] and I know this goes on the internet,
[1:56:51] but when I read that, I just thought,
[1:56:55] what kind of hope is there for a person
[1:56:58] like myself?
[1:57:03] the holiness and the justice of God.
[1:57:05] God's not cruel.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And the baby left.
[1:57:15] And he said, "If I had my life to live
[1:57:17] over, I'd never let that be trash."
[1:57:21] Just that one act
[1:57:24] of not going where God opened the door
[1:57:28] and he refused to go and he listened to
[1:57:31] a woman who said they're trash.
[1:57:35] And for that
[1:57:38] you talk about wounded.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You talk about wounded friends.
[1:57:45] Maybe some of you young people you
[1:57:48] haven't you haven't stood beside your
[1:57:51] loved ones casket.
[1:57:54] You will someday. And it'll be a sting.
[1:58:00] It'll be a real sting at the separation.
[1:58:03] No matter if you're a believer, they're
[1:58:05] a believer. There'll be a that
[1:58:06] separation. Not necessarily sorrow, but
[1:58:08] there'll be a great wound that'll
[1:58:10] happen.
[1:58:13] And here's a young man just got married.
[1:58:17] He's got his wife
[1:58:20] and he sees her in such agony and she
[1:58:22] goes,
[1:58:24] "I'm not playing on your emotions. I'm
[1:58:26] This is the prophet that God raised up
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; and God let him go through that
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; and his baby is taken from him
[1:58:35] because he didn't go to the people that
[1:58:38] were called trash by his mother-in-law."
[1:58:43] I don't expect that we will fully
[1:58:45] understand that. But I'm going to say
[1:58:47] this. This was years later. And he tells
[1:58:50] a story and tells it and tells it and
[1:58:53] tells it and it's the same every time.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's real.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's still painful.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said, "If you could only
[1:59:06] do it over again years later, if I could
[1:59:09] only do it over again." Are you We all
[1:59:11] got things.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; We all got times. We all got instances
[1:59:16] of and maybe haven't lived long enough.
[1:59:18] But when you come to that side, if I
[1:59:20] could only do it over again,
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; listen friends, he couldn't do it over
[1:59:24] again. You can't do it over again. I
[1:59:27] can't do it over again. But the one
[1:59:29] thing we can do is do what he did. He
[1:59:31] surrendered the whole life to God.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; And he took a message and he took the
[1:59:38] signs of almighty God to the same
[1:59:40] people.
[1:59:44] And God got the glory.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; What a life.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And one of the times when he told life
[2:00:03] story,
[2:00:09] he prays
[2:00:12] He says, "Oh Christian people," so I'll
[2:00:15] say it to you, "Oh Christian people,
[2:00:19] one of these days I know beyond the
[2:00:23] reach of mortal kin.
[2:00:27] Someday God only knows just where and
[2:00:30] when the wheels of mortal life will all
[2:00:33] stand still."
[2:00:35] Says, "Then I'm going to make a trip up
[2:00:38] to Zion's hill." He says, ' And I've
[2:00:41] tried to live with all my heart, dear
[2:00:45] Jesus, to live for you, to do the thing,
[2:00:48] no matter what this cross is or how
[2:00:52] scornful it seems to be. I love you,
[2:00:55] dear Jesus.
[2:00:57] You've broken my heart over and over,
[2:01:01] but I love you. Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; This may be a part of the message, you
[2:01:07] know, that you haven't heard too often,
[2:01:10] but I'm dwelling on it. God's messenger
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; saying in prayer, "Dear Jesus, you've
[2:01:18] broken my heart over and over.
[2:01:21] Not once, not twice, but over and over.
[2:01:24] But I love you."
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; That was the key.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; But I love you.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and by loving him said I love you
[2:01:33] for it and I pray now dear God that
[2:01:37] you'll help me to fulfill the commission
[2:01:39] that you have given that I might finish
[2:01:42] my course with joy so he looked at what
[2:01:45] was happening what had happened he can't
[2:01:47] change it but I'm looking towards the
[2:01:49] future and that I might finish my race
[2:01:52] with joy Hey,
[2:02:05] I don't know.
[2:02:07] The Lord will help me and you help me. I
[2:02:11] got a couple more examples I want to
[2:02:13] give you.
[2:02:14] And the prophet says that you should see
[2:02:18] Christ Jesus in every verse of the
[2:02:21] scripture.
[2:02:22] And here's a man of Job.
[2:02:28] And this this is the progression of his
[2:02:30] wounding. The progression.
[2:02:33] A runner comes. He's lost his
[2:02:36] possessions,
[2:02:38] his animals. Then he lost his servants.
[2:02:44] He lost his children.
[2:02:48] He was in such such grief. He wasn't
[2:02:51] able to speak. And those friends, then
[2:02:54] his friends came. Friends,
[2:02:57] you know, it's amazing how powerful
[2:02:59] friends are.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; You have friends now. His friends came
[2:03:03] and they just sat for seven days cuz
[2:03:06] they couldn't even utter a word.
[2:03:11] His condition was so dismal. And then
[2:03:17] Satan was able and allowed by God to
[2:03:21] afflict his body and he has boils from
[2:03:24] hand from the top of his head to the
[2:03:26] soles of his feet. I'm not just telling
[2:03:28] you a story. I'm not just preaching. I'm
[2:03:30] preaching a real gospel.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; This happened to believers.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; This happened to a man that God could
[2:03:38] God said he's perfect before me.
[2:03:49] You talk about wounded. I thought I
[2:03:51] would have time and I don't have the
[2:03:52] time.
[2:03:54] I haven't lost my children.
[2:03:58] I know sadness in my life.
[2:04:03] And I know a little bit of what I'm
[2:04:04] speaking about. I wouldn't speak about
[2:04:06] what I've gone through. You had brother
[2:04:09] Gary Walker here. We remember his
[2:04:12] testimony.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You remember it well.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; I when I heard that I said I have no
[2:04:17] problems.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have even heard. Do you
[2:04:20] know when you what you heard him what
[2:04:22] you heard here? It was the wound
[2:04:24] speaking.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; It was a man who had been through
[2:04:28] incredible suffering. It's a beyond
[2:04:31] description. Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; And I personally believe that God has
[2:04:35] allowed him to have the infirmities that
[2:04:37] he's had because it's so uh it so
[2:04:40] impacts the listener.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; You hear here's a man not talking about
[2:04:45] his suffering. He is suffering.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; He's having difficulty standing here at
[2:04:50] the And then he brother Tom's going to
[2:04:52] be with him in a in next month as they
[2:04:55] speak together at the Serbia convention
[2:04:57] in Serbia. And I I I can't comprehend
[2:05:00] how a man in his condition can get on
[2:05:02] those planes and travel for 12 and 14
[2:05:05] and 15 hours. I was moved.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't Gary Walker just speaking.
[2:05:12] It was the wound speaking.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; He yielded the wound to God.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; And he told you in sincerity. He stood
[2:05:24] here. He said, "I I come to believe that
[2:05:26] God raised me up because he hated me."
[2:05:31] That's what he said. "I believe that God
[2:05:34] raised me up and actually let me live so
[2:05:36] he could pour his anger out on me."
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's just how far and how low a person
[2:05:42] can get. And yet God was going to
[2:05:44] glorify himself through it.
[2:05:47] Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And Job finally when he was in this
[2:05:55] terrible state,
[2:05:57] having lost his sons and daughters who
[2:06:00] he had just offered, he offered
[2:06:02] sacrifices for them in case they might
[2:06:04] sin. And here God comes and and allows
[2:06:07] them to be wiped off the map
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; in a day.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; And his cattle is gone. His possessions
[2:06:14] are gone. You talk about an economic
[2:06:16] collapse. He had it. You haven't had it
[2:06:18] like he had it.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Don't get weary with the Sunday morning.
[2:06:25] You may well need what I'm speaking on
[2:06:27] just down the road a short time
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; or might be sooner than you think or you
[2:06:32] might be going through it right now. And
[2:06:34] this is the answer for you.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And after this incredible wounding, the
[2:06:42] wound spoke. Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't he couldn't say this before
[2:06:46] his wounding, but he could say it after
[2:06:49] the wounding. He said, "Naked came I out
[2:06:52] of my mother's womb,
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; and naked shall I return thither." The
[2:06:57] Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
[2:07:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't the end of his wounding.
[2:07:05] Listen. Then his friends turned into
[2:07:08] accusers.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; And they spent a long time and they
[2:07:13] detailed
[2:07:14] you. You have, you know, you've been
[2:07:18] honored.
[2:07:20] People listen to you. And now look at
[2:07:22] you.
[2:07:24] Look at the state that you're in. And
[2:07:26] they begin to accuse him and tell him
[2:07:29] exactly as the scripture says in in
[2:07:32] Isaiah 53 that the people considered
[2:07:35] Jesus smitten of God.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And now Job's friends are telling him
[2:07:40] the same thing. You've been smitten by
[2:07:43] God.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; God's against you.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And so the wounding continued. It was,
[2:07:50] like I said, it's a progression. But
[2:07:52] then
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; when you get over into the 19th chapter
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; and he details in the 19th chapter and
[2:07:59] listen what he says. Have you got time?
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Then Job answered, "How long will you
[2:08:05] vex my soul and break me in pieces with
[2:08:09] words?
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; These 10 times have have you reproached
[2:08:13] me and you've you've and you're not
[2:08:16] ashamed that I make that you make
[2:08:18] yourself strange to me." No. know now
[2:08:22] that God hath overthrown me. Said it's
[2:08:25] not you. God has overthrown me and hath
[2:08:29] come past me with his net. Behold, I cry
[2:08:33] out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry
[2:08:37] aloud and there is no judgment. He's
[2:08:40] describing his life now. He's describing
[2:08:42] the wound. He said, he hath fenced up my
[2:08:45] way that I cannot pass and he has set
[2:08:48] darkness in my path. Heath stripped me
[2:08:51] of my glory and taken the crown from my
[2:08:54] head. Heath destroyed me on every side,
[2:08:57] and I'm gone. And mine hope hath he
[2:09:01] removed like a tree. He hath also
[2:09:03] kindled his wrath against me, and he
[2:09:06] counted me unto him as one of his
[2:09:08] enemies. What a prayer.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Look how low he got.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; God has counted me as one of his
[2:09:15] enemies. His troops came to gather and
[2:09:18] raise up their way against me and encamp
[2:09:21] around about my tabernacle. He hath put
[2:09:24] my brethren far from me, and mine
[2:09:26] acquaintances are verily and strange to
[2:09:29] me. My kins folks have failed, and my
[2:09:33] familiar friends have forgotten me. They
[2:09:36] that dwell in my house, and my maids
[2:09:39] count me as a stranger, and I'm an alien
[2:09:42] in their sight. I called my servant and
[2:09:45] he gave me no answer. I intreated him
[2:09:48] with my mouth. My breath is strange to
[2:09:51] my wife, though I intreated her for the
[2:09:53] children's sake of my own body. Yay,
[2:09:57] young children despised me. I arose and
[2:10:00] they spake against me. All my inward All
[2:10:03] my inward friends abhored me, and they
[2:10:06] whom I loved are turned against me. My
[2:10:09] bone cleaveth to my skin and to my
[2:10:12] flesh, and I'm escaped with the skin of
[2:10:15] my teeth. Have pity upon me. Have pity
[2:10:18] upon me, oh ye my friends, for the hand
[2:10:22] of God has touched me. Why do you
[2:10:25] persecute me as God? Are you not
[2:10:27] satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my
[2:10:30] words were now written.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were printed in a book,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; that they were graven with an iron pen.
[2:10:38] and led in the rock forever. For I know
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; my redeemer liveth
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; that he shall stand at the latter day
[2:10:48] upon the earth at after the after his
[2:10:51] own description of the vile uh way that
[2:10:55] he been treated in the life and now God
[2:10:58] allowed it.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; I know
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; he couldn't say that before and he never
[2:11:06] did say it before. Who's speaking?
[2:11:08] What's speaking? The wound is speaking.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; He could only say it after he's wounded.
[2:11:17] I know my redeemer liveth.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; And at the last time, the last day, he
[2:11:25] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[2:11:28] earth. And though after my skin worms
[2:11:31] destroy this body, yet at life flesh
[2:11:35] shall I see God. Amen.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Have I weirded you out?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Been a long time. There. Just one more
[2:11:45] thing. I'm going to lay most of this
[2:11:47] aside.
[2:12:09] All right.
[2:12:15] How many ever heard of the five young
[2:12:18] men that went as missionaries to the AA
[2:12:20] Indians?
[2:12:25] How many have heard it here?
[2:12:35] There was a
[2:12:41] five young men,
[2:12:44] Jim Elliott. These are young men from
[2:12:46] the states. Jim Elliott, Nate Saint, Ed
[2:12:50] McCauley, Peter Fleming, and Roger
[2:12:55] uh Udian. Uder in I believe it is. They
[2:12:59] go to Ecuador to bring the
[2:13:03] gospel to a most primitive and violent
[2:13:05] tribe called the Aka Indians. I'm not
[2:13:09] saying their original name, but that's
[2:13:12] what they were known as. In September
[2:13:15] 1955, this just a year after less than a
[2:13:19] year after my wife and I were married,
[2:13:22] they began flying over the area where
[2:13:25] the trib's people were
[2:13:29] and they would they began dropping gifts
[2:13:31] so they could exchange gifts.
[2:13:35] And after several months of giving
[2:13:37] gifts,
[2:13:39] on January the 3rd, 1956,
[2:13:43] January the 3, they set up a little uh
[2:13:47] established a little camp on a river
[2:13:50] called the Kurar River.
[2:13:54] And they had a little plane that they
[2:13:56] were flying over and dropping these
[2:13:57] gifts.
[2:13:59] And this was just a few miles from the
[2:14:01] AA settlement.
[2:14:04] Just five days later, they were only on
[2:14:06] the sandbar five days. Five days later,
[2:14:10] all five of the young men were attacked
[2:14:13] and speared by a group of Aka warriors,
[2:14:16] killing all five of them.
[2:14:20] The news of their deaths was broadcast
[2:14:22] around the world. Of course, we heard it
[2:14:25] even up in northern British Columbia
[2:14:26] right away.
[2:14:29] And they said that it the life magazine
[2:14:32] carried a whole pictorial section of
[2:14:35] these young men. They said it literally
[2:14:38] galvanized
[2:14:40] the evang evangelistic fervor
[2:14:44] all over the earth. Just the lives of
[2:14:47] these five young men.
[2:14:50] the one his wife Elizabeth Elliott and
[2:14:54] she was a wife of Jim
[2:14:57] and the sister of Nate Saint her name is
[2:15:00] Rachel
[2:15:02] and Jim Elliot was born in Portland
[2:15:06] and the airplane they've just discovered
[2:15:08] it was buried in the sand and uh and
[2:15:11] they they got the main frame the
[2:15:13] structure out from the sand the warriors
[2:15:16] they buried the airplane
[2:15:18] and it is now in the first first city
[2:15:23] that my wife and I were in in special
[2:15:25] meetings in Nampa, Idaho. And the
[2:15:27] airplane is restored there in a in a
[2:15:30] museum now. But uh
[2:15:34] uh Elizabeth Elliott,
[2:15:37] wife of Jim and Rachel Saint, who's the
[2:15:39] sister of Nate Saint, they returned
[2:15:42] directly returned to Ecuador.
[2:15:46] And they gave years of their lives to
[2:15:49] the AA people and to the very warriors
[2:15:52] that killed the missionaries.
[2:15:55] And I've seen a picture of one one of
[2:15:58] them who actually speared the boys has
[2:16:01] become a Christian because of their
[2:16:04] efforts. There was no no way to get the
[2:16:07] gospel to these pe people, primitive and
[2:16:10] violent people. No way. And these two
[2:16:14] women and particularly Elizabeth
[2:16:17] Elliott,
[2:16:19] she she wrote a language, wrote uh
[2:16:23] letters and gave an alphabet to their
[2:16:27] tribal language so that they could read
[2:16:31] that, learn that, and then translate the
[2:16:35] Bible into that language so they could
[2:16:38] hear the gospel. Now, I tell you what,
[2:16:40] friends. I'm talking about a wound.
[2:16:43] There's a woman that loses her husband,
[2:16:46] another one that loses her brother, and
[2:16:48] they decide they're not just going to
[2:16:50] live at home and take flowers to a grave
[2:16:53] site once a year.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; You're quiet, but you'll remember this
[2:17:00] service.
[2:17:02] They decided, we're going to give our
[2:17:04] lives.
[2:17:07] And if you went on the website and and
[2:17:10] about Elizabeth Elliott or Betty
[2:17:13] Elliott, but she lived there for years
[2:17:16] and brought the gospel to those people
[2:17:19] and that was the that was the first time
[2:17:21] they'd ever heard about Jesus Christ.
[2:17:25] And that same woman came with her father
[2:17:28] and traveled through British Columbia
[2:17:31] and landed in Dawson Creek and spoke in
[2:17:34] the church that I was pastoring. I had
[2:17:36] her give a testimony. And so I met Betty
[2:17:39] Elliott and her father after this
[2:17:43] terrible time. I think she was on her
[2:17:45] way to Alaska.
[2:17:48] There was there was a lot of hurt.
[2:17:51] There's a lot of a lot of pain.
[2:17:54] There was a lot of separation.
[2:17:59] And yes, the whole world could get all
[2:18:01] enthused, excited about it. But there
[2:18:04] was somebody who said, and this is my
[2:18:06] point of my message. Somebody said, "I'm
[2:18:09] going to make a difference. I'm going to
[2:18:12] do something with this pain."
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to surrender it
[2:18:16] to God. I'm going to let it I'm going to
[2:18:19] let it do something for God. Now, these
[2:18:21] are outstanding. These are I only give
[2:18:23] them as an examples. I want to say to
[2:18:26] this church,
[2:18:29] we can do more. Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about offerings. I'm not
[2:18:34] talking about money. I'm talking about
[2:18:36] you, your life, your time.
[2:18:39] We're not here on a on a vacation.
[2:18:43] We're not here on a holiday. We're not
[2:18:47] here, as brother Brandham says, on a
[2:18:48] picnic. I believe that we have we have
[2:18:52] whatever health and life and strength
[2:18:55] God has given you. Your first call is
[2:18:59] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; That's your first call. And whatever
[2:19:03] resources God puts in your hand. That is
[2:19:06] for the use of the gospel of Jesus
[2:19:09] Christ. And the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:19:11] is for husbands to feed their families.
[2:19:13] That's and that that's all that's all
[2:19:16] part of the gospel. So I'm not talking
[2:19:18] about offering. I'm not talking about
[2:19:19] money. I'm just saying to you, don't
[2:19:22] waste your life
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; living for yourself.
[2:19:26] Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't waste your life just by
[2:19:29] bettering your own environment.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; That's a total waste.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; There's no reward for that.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Spend your life
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; bettering it for somebody else.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Reach out to somebody else. You can
[2:19:42] speak to someone else. You can send them
[2:19:44] a message book. You can send them a
[2:19:46] message. You can send them a DVD. You
[2:19:48] can do something. You can phone them.
[2:19:50] You can live a witness wherever you are.
[2:19:52] But live your life for someone else.
[2:19:55] This this life and brother Tom mentioned
[2:19:57] in his last service I believe it is so
[2:19:59] self-centered. You know what it does? It
[2:20:02] makes us impotent
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; because our whole world is around me and
[2:20:08] mine and this and all only things that
[2:20:11] concern me or make me happy or make life
[2:20:14] easier for me. We're not here to have an
[2:20:16] easy life.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; We're here as laborers in the kingdom of
[2:20:21] God.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; I was just doing a little bit. I needed
[2:20:34] to do a little bit of kind of look back
[2:20:39] because of some comments that were made.
[2:20:41] So I just look back and my my wife
[2:20:43] carries a little Hallmark calendar in
[2:20:45] her purse and just you know just make a
[2:20:49] little note on the date where this that
[2:20:51] the other thing and where we are and
[2:20:53] whatever more
[2:20:55] and I know that you you've known that
[2:20:57] I've traveled a lot
[2:21:00] but in the last 10 years I preached 77
[2:21:04] conventions
[2:21:06] in the last 10 years and I don't regret
[2:21:10] it at all I wouldn't want to do it
[2:21:12] again, but I don't regret it at all. I
[2:21:15] think that if we allowed if God opened I
[2:21:18] couldn't do that if God hadn't opened
[2:21:19] the door and you people made it possible
[2:21:21] and and tolerated it and everything
[2:21:23] else. But and and and yet I I feel I I'm
[2:21:28] so humbled and humiliated. But brother
[2:21:32] Brandham here here here the one that's
[2:21:34] beside him is going to take him beyond
[2:21:36] the curtain of time. And he has just put
[2:21:38] his hand behind his head and said,
[2:21:40] "Well, Bill Brandham," and these were
[2:21:42] his words to me. "Well, Bill Brandham,
[2:21:45] you're 52,
[2:21:47] and if you're going to do anything for
[2:21:48] God, you better get going."
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; When he said that, I felt about a
[2:21:54] quarter of an inch high.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; And I still feel the same way. But
[2:22:03] whatever we've been given,
[2:22:06] you're going to meet people that I and
[2:22:08] the rest here aren't going to meet. And
[2:22:11] God's going to give you an opportunity.
[2:22:13] And maybe you won't be able to say a
[2:22:14] word. I've got neighbors. I feel
[2:22:16] terrible. I haven't had a real good
[2:22:19] solid chance to witness. I have spoken
[2:22:22] to them a wee bit from time to time but
[2:22:24] you know it's just kind of a general
[2:22:26] never been able to really get to the
[2:22:28] subject and I feel terrible about that
[2:22:31] but one thing they see our car go out to
[2:22:34] church they know that we are believers
[2:22:37] they know that we are Christians and we
[2:22:40] don't hesitate the lady across the
[2:22:41] street her husband died here a short
[2:22:43] time ago and I went over and told her
[2:22:46] that we will pray for her and remember
[2:22:48] her and she was very touched the the the
[2:22:50] the musician, the well-known musician,
[2:22:53] uh Robbie Bachmann, his wife died at 29
[2:22:56] years old from cancer. And I I told him
[2:22:59] about the healing and I told him about
[2:23:02] the ministry and told him how God heals
[2:23:04] those things and and he tapped my hand
[2:23:08] and he was touched. He said, "Well,
[2:23:09] thank you. We I don't know. I I wish we
[2:23:12] had better opportunities. But whatever
[2:23:15] opportunity God gives us, whether by
[2:23:17] speaking or by living it, your actions
[2:23:21] are louder here on earth
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; than any word that you could speak. And
[2:23:25] our testimony and our actions should be
[2:23:28] exactly exactly the same.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; And whatever you have gone through,
[2:23:32] whatever you've suffered, whatever
[2:23:34] you've experienced, I want this to be an
[2:23:36] announcement.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Let God
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; take that. and use it for his glory.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:04] I really mean that.
[2:24:07] I really mean that.
[2:24:10] Don't Don't let
[2:24:14] Don't let the present economic
[2:24:16] conditions
[2:24:18] swallow you up.
[2:24:22] Don't let any
[2:24:25] between yourself, your family, your
[2:24:27] friends. Don't let that swallow you up.
[2:24:31] Set your sight for the kingdom. Set your
[2:24:34] sight. We only have this one time,
[2:24:36] friends.
[2:24:37] we only have this one time. And I it it
[2:24:40] is as though today I I really felt I
[2:24:42] just felt like, you know, throwing the
[2:24:45] gauntlet down and saying,
[2:24:48] you know, you young fellas, you need to
[2:24:52] set yourself aside, give yourself in
[2:24:55] prayer and find out what God wants you
[2:24:57] to do.
[2:25:00] Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; If you do that, you'll never never
[2:25:06] regret it.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; And on the other side, if you do that,
[2:25:11] you'll come on the other side and you'll
[2:25:13] give me a hug.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; For saying that,
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; you'll never regret it. You'll never
[2:25:20] regret it.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; And things that you desire in your
[2:25:23] heart, God God knows those desires.
[2:25:28] young men, young ladies. I say young
[2:25:30] because
[2:25:31] you've got some youth, you've got some
[2:25:33] energy, you've got some future if God
[2:25:36] allows us to have some future.
[2:25:40] I'm sorry for I've taken so much time
[2:25:43] and yet I can't apologize because this
[2:25:46] this has just been gripping and and we
[2:25:48] have lots of testimonies here in the
[2:25:50] congregation of people who've given
[2:25:52] themselves unreservedly and it it really
[2:25:56] speaks to me. I'm thankful for what
[2:25:59] you've done, brother Richard. You're
[2:26:00] you're just one I don't want to set you,
[2:26:03] you know,
[2:26:06] Brother Richard Drake has just quietly
[2:26:08] he just worked for God. He's a bus
[2:26:10] driver
[2:26:12] now. He's in charge of, you know,
[2:26:14] scheduling or something. I don't know
[2:26:16] what it is. All I know is that when some
[2:26:19] kids and some people in some orphanages
[2:26:22] need something, he managed to get some
[2:26:24] of your sisters together and sort out
[2:26:26] clothes and away they go over there. You
[2:26:28] don't know what that means to them. They
[2:26:30] say, "There's some real Christians."
[2:26:34] I believe we can do something. Brother,
[2:26:37] I'm closing right now with this. Brother
[2:26:40] Murphy
[2:26:42] stood up and preached in Switzerland.
[2:26:44] And Switzerland's probably listening
[2:26:46] right now, Sunday evening. And the
[2:26:49] brother of whom I'm speaking who just
[2:26:51] emailed me a few days ago, I would
[2:26:54] expect that they listen every Sunday.
[2:26:58] And you're probably listening, Brother
[2:27:00] Daniel.
[2:27:02] But it spoke to my heart and I haven't
[2:27:04] answered him yet.
[2:27:07] Brother Murphy preached and I sat
[2:27:10] behind. You may think that your heart is
[2:27:12] spoken to. You may think that you know
[2:27:15] you're gripped. I was so gripped.
[2:27:18] I was so humbled when brother Murphy was
[2:27:21] done. I felt I cannot add anything to
[2:27:24] this. And I just came. There was a nice
[2:27:28] audience of people and I just came to
[2:27:29] the pulpit, leaned over the pulpit and I
[2:27:32] yelled out, "Do something
[2:27:40] and close the service."
[2:27:43] And this brother, he owns a factory.
[2:27:48] He's a businessman.
[2:27:51] He is so occupied.
[2:27:53] But he wrote me an email and he said,
[2:27:57] "You know, you spoke at that service and
[2:28:00] and we spoke together about doing
[2:28:03] something. There's there's so much that
[2:28:06] could be done and we spoke about the hub
[2:28:09] and we spoke about all these things. I
[2:28:11] tell you what, friends, there's just so
[2:28:12] much that can be done and brother uh
[2:28:15] Timothy Andes and and working under
[2:28:19] brother John's direction, but they got
[2:28:22] all the people together and I understand
[2:28:24] about 35% of this congregation is
[2:28:28] meeting to put the messages up on the
[2:28:31] hub. When I talk about message of the
[2:28:33] hub, I'm talking about a prophet's
[2:28:34] message
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; reaching people all around the world.
[2:28:38] And I I'm I don't have some, you know,
[2:28:41] uh a strange kink about that. I am
[2:28:44] absolutely obsessed with it.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; And why wouldn't we be?
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; If you could get somebody else to hear
[2:28:49] it and someone else to experience what
[2:28:51] you're experiencing, wouldn't that be a
[2:28:53] thrill?
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Absolutely a thrill.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I spoke to you and I said,
[2:28:58] I want to and I still do." And life is
[2:29:01] empty.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Life is empty without that focus.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will grant that.
[2:29:08] Thank you for your
[2:29:10] kind attention.
[2:29:12] If you bow your head, would you stand
[2:29:14] with me, please?
[2:29:31] Dear loving Lord Jesus,
[2:29:36] the one that walked up Calvar's hill,
[2:29:40] the one whose visage was so marred more
[2:29:43] than that of any man.
[2:29:46] And in the as your prophet and servant
[2:29:49] describes
[2:29:51] describes it in such detail,
[2:29:54] it was difficult for me to read.
[2:29:57] I couldn't hardly comprehend
[2:29:59] the suffering and the wounding that you
[2:30:01] went through.
[2:30:03] And Lord, it was not just for that,
[2:30:08] but it was that a life that a a an
[2:30:12] experience could come, that a voice
[2:30:15] could come. And I want to testify here
[2:30:18] today in public. I've heard that voice.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; I heard that call.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; The people that are standing here, oh
[2:30:26] God, many of them have heard that call.
[2:30:29] Some perhaps have not heard that call.
[2:30:32] But even even this morning, you've
[2:30:34] allowed the words to escape my lips,
[2:30:37] Lord, and go directly by the Holy Spirit
[2:30:40] to their hearts. And I will not close
[2:30:43] the service, oh God, until you are done
[2:30:45] dealing with every heart and every life.
[2:30:48] Lord, perhaps there is someone that
[2:30:50] needs to surrender their upset and to
[2:30:53] surrender their reversals and not allow
[2:30:57] them to be overcome by it. Oh God, I
[2:31:00] pray they will shake themselves and
[2:31:02] realize this is the only life. This is
[2:31:04] the only time. This is the only chance
[2:31:07] that we have. I pray, Father, that as we
[2:31:09] speak about the eminent uh rapture and
[2:31:13] the and and the receiving of Christ,
[2:31:15] Christ receiving us, Lord, if we are
[2:31:17] really believing that, how much more we
[2:31:20] want to uh use up and and and redeem the
[2:31:23] time. Father, I pray that you will
[2:31:26] impress this people as you have
[2:31:28] impressed me. Deal with them, Lord, as
[2:31:31] you've dealt with my own heart. I pray,
[2:31:34] oh God, I call on you by the Holy
[2:31:36] Spirit. Father, I pray that we will use
[2:31:40] every opportunity,
[2:31:42] every opportunity that comes our way to
[2:31:45] to uh further the kingdom of God here
[2:31:48] locally, Lord, in its own church,
[2:31:51] Father, the school, the camp, or
[2:31:53] whatever more. We do it for your glory.
[2:31:55] We do it, oh God, not for our enjoyment.
[2:31:58] We do it that you might touch somebody
[2:32:00] that we can do it, Lord, that we might
[2:32:02] get one last seed. Lord, we're pushing
[2:32:05] the boat out. We're calling people to
[2:32:08] come in. Come into this boat and don't
[2:32:11] get it caught in this raging torrent of
[2:32:13] time. And the people, Lord, the way that
[2:32:15] they're going, how sad it is, Lord,
[2:32:18] going headlong to destruction. Don't let
[2:32:21] our young people be caught up in that.
[2:32:23] Oh, God. Don't let them get caught up
[2:32:25] with the the entertainment and and the
[2:32:28] things that simply brth bring a thrill
[2:32:30] to this flesh. Oh God, may we cast down.
[2:32:33] For they that live after the flesh shall
[2:32:35] die, but they that live after the spirit
[2:32:38] shall live. Oh, Father, in the name of
[2:32:41] Jesus, in the name of Jesus, call I
[2:32:44] pray. I pray, oh God. Pray, oh God, that
[2:32:48] you'll do so this Sunday afternoon.
[2:32:51] Father,
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, speak, speak my Lord.
[2:32:56] Speak my Lord. I wonder if we could have
[2:32:59] that chorus, Brother Ryan. Speak my
[2:33:02] Lord. Speak my Lord. and I will I'll be
[2:33:05] quick to answer thee. Could you help me,
[2:33:09] brother Derek, if you're here?
[2:33:12] Sorry. Okay. Thank you.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; let's just close our eyes, shall we? As
[2:33:20] we sing it,
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; speak my Lord.
[2:33:25] [Music]
[2:33:28] thee and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:33:38] Speak my Lord.
[2:33:44] Speak my Lord.
[2:33:52] Speak and I will answer.
[2:33:56] Lord,
[2:33:58] send me.
[2:34:01] Once again prayerfully, please.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord.
[2:34:09] Speak my Lord.
[2:34:15] [Music]
[2:34:17] Speak and I'll be quick.
[2:34:21] to answer.
[2:34:24] [Music]
[2:34:28] Speak my Lord.
[2:34:34] Speak my Lord.
[2:34:39] [Music]
[2:34:42] Speak and I will answer.
[2:34:47] Lord,
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; here's what we want to say. I'll say
[2:34:51] yes. Yes. I'll say yes. Yes.
[2:34:55] Say yes,
[2:34:58] Lord. Yes.
[2:35:00] To your will and to your way.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Let's just raise our hands.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; I'll say yes.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Surrender to him. Oh yes,
[2:35:12] I will trust you and oy
[2:35:18] when your spirit speaks to me.
[2:35:23] With my whole heart I
[2:35:30] answer will be yes,
[2:35:34] Lord. Yes.
[2:35:40] And there's other one too. I'll say yes.
[2:35:43] Yes. Just don't say yes.
[2:35:49] I'll say yes.
[2:35:52] Yes.
[2:35:55] Yes. Say it from your heart now. I'll
[2:36:00] say yes.
[2:36:03] Yes.
[2:36:06] Yes.
[2:36:10] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:36:15] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:36:21] I'll say yes.
[2:36:25] [Music]
[2:36:28] Yes. As a young teenager that wrote
[2:36:31] that, it's very simple. I'll say yes.
[2:36:34] Yes. But I'm going to invite there may
[2:36:36] be others. There may be someone that God
[2:36:40] has spoken to in a special way. And I'll
[2:36:42] tell you what, brother Biscll, you might
[2:36:44] say, "What what are you attempting to
[2:36:46] do, brother Biscll?" I'm ask God today
[2:36:51] that you might feel the inspiration
[2:36:55] that is within this being. I feel so
[2:36:58] inspired about the work of God. I feel
[2:37:01] so inspired. I feel so jealous over the
[2:37:04] work of God that God has done not only
[2:37:07] locally but what he's done elsewhere.
[2:37:10] Friends, I just can't I can't rest if
[2:37:14] there's another day if there's another
[2:37:15] thing that we can do. And I say God
[2:37:18] bless the young people. God bless all
[2:37:19] who are been involved. God bless our
[2:37:22] teachers, our Sunday school teachers.
[2:37:24] God bless the work. God bless the
[2:37:25] deacons and the trustees. God bless the
[2:37:28] believers that are gathered elsewhere uh
[2:37:31] over at the other group. God bless. I I
[2:37:33] say we only have one time. And may God
[2:37:36] use every believer
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; to get this message to live a life
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; that is respectful
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; to live a life
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; that is an example.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; You believe it's possible.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Maybe maybe you felt, well,
[2:37:52] I've done the best that I can. Well, I
[2:37:54] pray that God will even give you a
[2:37:56] greater comprehension of what is yet
[2:37:59] possible.
[2:38:01] We're not here for ourselves. We're not
[2:38:03] here to just make life easy for
[2:38:05] ourselves. We're here to to further the
[2:38:07] kingdom of God. I'll say yes.
[2:38:13] Yes.
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, speak to our hearts.
[2:38:19] [Music]
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:38:26] Yes.
[2:38:30] I'll say yes Lord.
[2:38:35] I'll say yes Lord.
[2:38:39] [Music]
[2:38:41] I'll say yes.
[2:38:44] [Music]
[2:38:49] That's the last song. Ask
[2:38:53] me not
[2:38:56] to see.
[2:38:58] Ask him to come near you.
[2:39:01] Ask him to come near you. Hear
[2:39:06] my
[2:39:08] humble cry.
[2:39:10] [Music]
[2:39:15] and one
[2:39:18] another
[2:39:21] are called
[2:39:23] to holy.
[2:39:27] Do
[2:39:29] not pass
[2:39:32] me by.
[2:39:35] [Music]
[2:39:38] Oh, save
[2:39:44] [Music]
[2:39:50] for him.
[2:39:52] [Music]
[2:40:01] and one
[2:40:04] other
[2:40:07] [Music]
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; just so that the congregation here would
[2:40:23] know and understand. I want you to have
[2:40:25] the right attitude.
[2:40:27] I think that's so important. This
[2:40:29] message really spoke to me as God was
[2:40:32] giving it to me. We must have the right
[2:40:34] attitude.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; This morning I had in my prayer
[2:40:44] I prayed for brother Lance
[2:40:46] and I prayed that God would mightily
[2:40:49] fill his mouth with words
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; and speak exactly what the people need
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; that are sitting there listening to him.
[2:40:57] And I believe that's absolutely
[2:40:59] necessary. That might come as a surprise
[2:41:00] to you, but that's not that's not just
[2:41:02] once in a while. I do that frequently.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you one thing for sure
[2:41:09] on the other side.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be any different
[2:41:13] groups. We're going to sit at one table.
[2:41:15] And down here, we may have different
[2:41:17] groups and different churches and
[2:41:20] different kind of beliefs and different
[2:41:21] slants and different thoughts about
[2:41:24] things. And as I go, I just one one
[2:41:27] thing I always try to do is stay out of
[2:41:28] the politics of the local area. God
[2:41:32] knows those that are his.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; All that are mine, he said,
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; will come.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; Why do we say that? Will come
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; and no man can take them out of my hand.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; And this is I rest. This is my peace.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; All that are mine. And on the other
[2:41:54] side, all that are his,
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; we're going to be together.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One group.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; Why don't we say amen to that?
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; That's the absolute truth.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; So we pray and I pray for you. I pray
[2:42:11] that somehow you caught something today.
[2:42:14] We'll just sing it once more and I'll
[2:42:15] close in prayer.
[2:42:19] Saveior.
[2:42:20] [Music]
[2:42:25] Saveior.
[2:42:29] [Music]
[2:42:33] My
[2:42:43] Why
[2:42:46] [Music]
[2:42:55] do you
[2:42:57] not pass?
[2:43:02] [Music]
[2:43:04] Now, will you bow your heads with me as
[2:43:06] we come before his throne of grace?
[2:43:10] Our dear Lord Jesus, the one that is
[2:43:13] alive and present. You lived such a
[2:43:16] life. Lord, we cannot in ourselves
[2:43:20] attain to such a place. But I pray that
[2:43:23] you will impart to each one of us a
[2:43:26] portion. Lord, I believe that I'm
[2:43:28] speaking on behalf of the people. We
[2:43:30] hunger and we desire. We want to live
[2:43:33] exactly as you'd have us to live, Lord.
[2:43:35] We want to be what you'd want us to be.
[2:43:38] We want to say what you'd want us to
[2:43:40] say. We want to have the kind of
[2:43:42] attitude and character that you want us
[2:43:44] to have. Father, I pray you'll forgive
[2:43:47] us our faults. Forgive us our failures.
[2:43:50] But above all things, oh God, help us
[2:43:52] not to look back. Help us to be as
[2:43:54] Apostle Paul said, forgetting those
[2:43:57] things which are behind and pressing
[2:43:59] forward towards the prize of the mark of
[2:44:02] the high calling in Christ Jesus. I pray
[2:44:04] Lord, as I've asked this morning in
[2:44:07] prayer, you'll inspire this
[2:44:09] congregation. Inspire those that are
[2:44:13] listening on the internet. Inspire all
[2:44:15] that will hear this word. Oh God, as
[2:44:18] you've spoken to my own heart, may you
[2:44:20] go on with the Holy Spirit and speak to
[2:44:23] the people long after they've left this
[2:44:26] building. And those that are in a state
[2:44:28] of decision making, I pray, oh God, they
[2:44:30] will cast their decision
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; in the right direction, casting it, your
[2:44:36] will be done. Lord, I pray you'll
[2:44:38] quicken us and ask you to bless this day
[2:44:41] and make it a blessing. And let your
[2:44:43] word be in our thoughts, Father, in
[2:44:46] Jesus Christ's name. I ask you to
[2:44:48] dismiss us from this building but not
[2:44:52] from your presence. Go with us, Lord. I
[2:44:55] pray in the cars, in the homes. Lord
[2:45:00] Jesus, would you would you please draw
[2:45:02] near that there'll just be a
[2:45:06] an immediate realization.
[2:45:08] There's another presence here. There's
[2:45:11] another person. You're wooing. You're
[2:45:14] calling. You're brooding over our lives,
[2:45:17] oh God.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, let this congregation of people,
[2:45:21] let us continue to be a voice, oh Lord
[2:45:25] Jesus,
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; wounded
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; for our transgressions.
[2:45:30] And now we want to be a voice.
[2:45:33] Oh God, a true voice,
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; a dedicated voice.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Let our actions speak.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let the people around. Let
[2:45:45] somebody this week be moved
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; by our lives. I pray.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; Dismiss us now, Jesus. In your name,
[2:45:53] thank you for the patience of the
[2:45:55] people. We ask your blessings on them.
[2:45:59] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You've been a
[2:46:02] kind, attentive congregation. I sure
[2:46:06] appreciate it. God bless you. like you
[2:46:09] just dismiss reverently if you would
[2:46:12] rather than shaking hands here. You just
[2:46:15] go out and when you go out then you can
[2:46:17] greet the people and shake hands but
[2:46:19] just remain rather uh quietly and you
[2:46:23] you you're dismissed now to leave. God
[2:46:25] bless you in Jesus name.
