[0:00] you know
[0:03] there's a we all know the elite armies
[0:05] of the day
[0:07] and we have these different play
[0:10] battalions or whatever groups that are
[0:13] the mightiest the SAS and all these
[0:15] things they're the elite of the world
[0:16] the elite Warriors of the world
[0:19] you know
[0:20] so these the Navy Seals they're one of
[0:22] these top Elites
[0:23] and they go through what's called hell
[0:25] week
[0:26] four of their training hell week
[0:31] I wonder
[0:32] if we're in
[0:34] what would we consider
[0:36] this age
[0:38] When Death Rides that fourth seal
[0:42] and here we are they train super
[0:44] incredibly to try and get through
[0:47] 200 miles and they they run 200 miles in
[0:51] just one week
[0:52] they sleep for four hours 20 hours of
[0:54] physical training but
[0:56] you know whatever they all go through to
[0:58] get there one thing defines everybody
[1:02] that goes through the training
[1:05] and they have
[1:07] what they they have that hangs in the
[1:09] main Square
[1:10] of the main training area or the
[1:13] Gathering area it's a big Bell
[1:15] and it hangs there it's a big Bell and
[1:17] it sits in front of everybody
[1:19] and if you want to quit
[1:21] you have to go to the Bell
[1:23] I have to ring it three times Bang
[1:25] Bang
[1:28] and you place your hat
[1:30] training army hat on the ground
[1:33] and you walk off
[1:35] and you've quit
[1:38] and as the training goes
[1:40] hat upon hat gets added the Bell
[1:44] continues to get rung
[1:47] and up to 80 plus percent
[1:50] ring the bell
[1:53] but one fella said the one thing that
[1:54] defines everybody that goes through
[1:55] sealed training
[1:57] is that they didn't ring the bell
[1:59] they didn't quit
[2:03] it was it wasn't it so while it was
[2:05] important to be physically fit
[2:07] and all the training that you have to go
[2:09] through you find out though quickly says
[2:10] your background your social status your
[2:13] race none of this matters
[2:16] the only thing that matters
[2:18] is that you go in with purpose in mind
[2:22] and this that you are just not going to
[2:27] quit no matter what happens
[2:31] you know and there they are these are
[2:34] natural Elites that have something
[2:36] inside of them to willing to go all the
[2:40] way they just have they've something is
[2:42] there it's it their makeup is a little
[2:45] bit different willing to go no matter
[2:47] what now how difficult and it's
[2:48] difficult to where they're dragging
[2:50] their carcasses somehow or their buddy
[2:52] is dragging them somehow just so they
[2:54] can get across the line for the day it's
[2:56] grueling it's difficult but something
[2:58] inside of them it just won't allow them
[3:00] to drag themselves up as much as somehow
[3:03] the battle in the mind just go ring the
[3:05] bell no I can't remember just go ring
[3:06] the bell if you just put your hat down
[3:08] there it's all over the pain is gone the
[3:11] agony it disappears you can be free of
[3:14] this wretched hell week and just go home
[3:17] ever had that mind battle
[3:20] just throw in the towel you can't do
[3:23] this no longer you think you've got
[3:25] another day left you can't do it
[3:28] but something inside you
[3:31] something inside of you because you're
[3:33] God's Elite in this day and age and
[3:36] there's some God Particle inside that
[3:38] just drives you on I just can't ring
[3:40] that Bell it's impossible for me to
[3:43] throw in the towel why because you're
[3:44] Gods he has dropped inside of you a seed
[3:47] that is going to grow and manifest in
[3:49] this day exactly what God wants say oh
[3:53] God I don't know how I'm gonna get
[3:54] through it well Humanity goes through
[3:56] some crazy things people have dragged
[3:58] themselves through Wicked situations
[4:00] broken bone situations for miles and
[4:02] miles the human the natural being has
[4:06] something inside some people one fella
[4:09] fell 75 feet shattered his hip his femur
[4:11] and dragged himself for for eight miles
[4:14] through Creeks through streams just to
[4:16] get to a little home to get shattered
[4:19] body I don't even know how he did it
[4:20] something inside this guy he had a
[4:23] determination he had whatever you want
[4:25] to call it Inner Strength inner grit
[4:27] inner determination I don't care he had
[4:29] it that's natural there is something
[4:31] inside a Believer I don't know what you
[4:34] want to call it but I call it God I call
[4:36] it a seed of God that is planted inside
[4:39] of you that your face is set Like Flint
[4:41] and you say I don't care whatever it
[4:44] takes I'm gonna go and see my king
[4:48] amen
[4:50] amen they say well these different ones
[4:52] they say they shouldn't be alive well
[4:54] spiritually maybe some of you think well
[4:56] I just shouldn't be alive spiritually
[4:57] but you are
[4:59] you are
[5:01] you're here you're still fighting
[5:03] because God placed it in you
