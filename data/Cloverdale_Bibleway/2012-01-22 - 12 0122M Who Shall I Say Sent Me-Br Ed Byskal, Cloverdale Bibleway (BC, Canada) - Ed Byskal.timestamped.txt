[8:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:41] Amen. We want to greet each and every
[8:42] one of you in the name of our Lord
[8:44] Jesus. It's wonderful to be gathered
[8:45] together again this morning.
[8:47] We're going to sing I bless your name. I
[8:49] bless your name. Just before we do, I
[8:51] have a testimony. It's an update to the
[8:54] prayer request last week for the
[8:55] believers in Romania. We prayed for a
[8:58] 17-year-old daughter of our sister Lydia
[8:59] in a life and death situation. She has
[9:02] come out of her coma. Before the
[9:03] accident, she could speak three
[9:05] different languages and she is speaking
[9:06] in all three. The doctors and nurses
[9:08] can't believe what they are seeing.
[9:10] Before she came out of her coma, they
[9:11] had removed all the life support. Amen.
[9:14] Praise our God. He's a miracle working
[9:16] God.
[9:17] Hallelujah.
[9:20] Amen. I bless your name.
[9:25] I bless your name.
[9:30] I bless your name. Bless your name, Lord
[9:35] Jesus.
[9:36] I give you all.
[9:41] I give you praise
[9:46] for you are
[9:52] the truth, the way.
[9:57] I bless your name.
[10:03] I bless your way in prison chains. Oh,
[10:08] and in prison chain
[10:14] with
[10:24] great
[10:31] Hey
[10:36] to see
[10:41] my
[10:46] free
[10:58] Hey,
[11:02] you are
[11:11] you are
[11:27] I
[11:30] Sunday night
[11:32] So now
[11:43] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[11:53] I return
[12:09] in Jesus
[12:12] name.
[12:14] I bless your name.
[12:22] of your name.
[12:26] I give you
[12:33] praise.
[12:36] You are
[12:41] bless.
[12:47] I bless your name.
[12:52] I sing that second verse again. Some
[12:54] midnight hour.
[12:56] Oh, some midnight
[12:59] hour.
[13:07] Glory
[13:34] Jesus
[13:36] name.
[13:38] I bless your name.
[13:43] I bless your name.
[13:48] Oh, I you
[14:00] are
[14:05] to thy name.
[14:09] I bless your name.
[14:15] I bless your name.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Just remembering that vision,
[14:23] that dream that brother Brandham had
[14:25] when he saw those people
[14:28] in in that house of hell.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "My arms are too small.
[14:37] And then he said, "In Jesus' name, house
[14:39] of hell give way."
[14:41] &gt;&gt; I think we can sing that second verse
[14:43] with a little more revelation.
[14:45] And they will fall in Jesus' name.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; There's many needs here this morning.
[14:50] And it doesn't matter what they are.
[14:52] There's no reason for us to leave this
[14:54] building this morning with the same
[14:55] needs, saints.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that again. Let's
[14:58] remember in Jesus' name. In the strong
[15:00] name of Jesus.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Some midnight hour.
[15:06] Some midnight hour.
[15:10] Oh, if you
[15:13] should find
[15:16] that you're in
[15:23] your Oh
[15:33] my god.
[15:54] I bless your name.
[16:14] Hallelujah.
[16:20] I bless your name.
[16:25] I bless your name. Sing it. I bless your
[16:29] name. Oh, I bless your name.
[16:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[16:47] I give you praise.
[16:52] You are
[16:58] the way.
[17:02] I bless your name.
[17:08] I bless your name.
[17:13] I believe you're my healer.
[17:17] Oh, you hold my every
[17:22] moment
[17:25] and you call my
[17:29] sea.
[17:32] When you walk with me through fire
[17:39] and you heal all my disease,
[17:46] Lord, I trust
[17:48] in
[17:50] you,
[17:52] Lord. I trust in
[17:57] you

[18:50] moment.

[19:13] Lord, I trust
[19:16] in you. No matter what the circumstance,
[19:20] Lord, I trust
[19:22] in
[19:24] you.

[20:18] for you. Nothing is impossible.

[20:31] for you.

[20:37] this morning? For nothing is impossible
[20:44] for you. Nothing is impossible.
[20:51] Oh, nothing is impossible

[21:49] Hallelujah.
[21:52] Amen. As we prepare to go to prayer,
[21:53] let's sing it's already done. It's
[21:55] already done. We do have a number of
[21:58] prayer requests this morning.
[22:00] I want to continue to remember sister
[22:03] Lydia's family in Romania. Her brother
[22:05] Tobias Wolf is still in Tibet intensive
[22:07] care. He and his family attend brother
[22:09] Garrett's church in Germany and there
[22:12] was a fear that he could lose his legs.
[22:13] We just want to continue to remember
[22:14] this family. God's done a wonderful work
[22:16] already. It's a desire that God will
[22:18] continue to move on their behalf.
[22:21] Request from our brother Scotty Weber.
[22:22] Please pray for my brother Leo. He just
[22:24] underwent spinal surgery and is in a lot
[22:27] of pain. Please pray that the Lord will
[22:29] move in his life and show his power to
[22:30] him. Amen.
[22:33] Also a prayer request for our brother
[22:34] Louise. He is at home and not well in
[22:36] body. And we want to remember the family
[22:40] uh the mother of our sister, brother
[22:42] Jean Canandanda and sister Biami Monga
[22:45] just passed away last Monday in the
[22:47] Congo. She was asking that God would be
[22:49] with the family during this time. Amen.
[22:52] There's many needs, but it's already
[22:54] done. Just grant that God would give us
[22:56] a revelation of that this morning.
[22:59] Hallelujah.
[23:00] Oh, it's already done.
[23:06] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, it's already done.

[40:47] my Jesus
[40:51] is now.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; And I'll have you stand as we are going
[40:55] to sing the first verse of that song
[40:57] again. You talk about the mind of Christ
[41:00] and Sister Sharon singing that he would
[41:04] be there with us always, not only in the
[41:07] storm, but even while we worship.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; I believe he's here to receive our
[41:11] worship.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; And so yesterday, I thought
[41:16] while I was studying,
[41:18] I want to sing with a congregation. It
[41:20] is well with my soul. And then I just
[41:25] service just starts and here brother
[41:27] Ryan is singing it is well with my soul.
[41:30] And then while I'm in the study I just
[41:32] was on my knees and just worshiping with
[41:36] you and singing it is well with my soul
[41:38] and I thought well I want to sing my
[41:41] Jesus I love thee. So so I sang that in
[41:45] the study and I I come out to the song.
[41:49] So we have the mind of Christ.
[41:52] Hallelujah. And not only that,
[41:55] I have a quote and you've heard it many
[41:57] times before. The prophet said that the
[42:01] bride has the mind of Christ and she
[42:04] knows what he wants done with the word.
[42:06] And so we're trusting for that part now
[42:09] as well.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; You believe we have the mind of Christ?
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. All right, let's just sing
[42:15] this first verse again.
[42:18] My Jesus
[42:22] I love thee. My
[42:27] thyior
[42:57] and
[43:00] I love thee. My Jesus
[43:06] is.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we do
[43:14] love him dearly. Just before we turn to
[43:16] the word, I want to ask the congregation
[43:18] and those that are on the internet as
[43:21] well part of the what's going on here
[43:25] this morning. We uh brother John Andes
[43:28] will be leaving tomorrow for Australia
[43:31] and be having meetings in Perth and also
[43:35] in Melbourne. And I just really feel
[43:38] that it's God's uh God has opened the
[43:42] doors and God is in this. And so let's
[43:45] just pray. We don't know what all God
[43:47] wants to do, but let's just pray that
[43:49] God will
[43:51] uh supernaturally
[43:53] &gt;&gt; visit the people and the meetings and
[43:56] the young people and whatever more. And
[43:58] he will be also with brother Queasy. Uh
[44:01] and that is uh really wonderful. I'm
[44:03] happy about that. So we want to be
[44:06] remembering our brother John. Also, uh
[44:09] our brother Jean uh Chimpaka had to
[44:12] leave yesterday to go back to uh Ghana,
[44:16] back to Africa, not to Ghana, but he's
[44:18] going to be in Chad for some some time.
[44:21] And brother Timothy on Tokco also had to
[44:24] return and they're both on route. Um so
[44:30] let's pray for these brothers. the
[44:31] families are here and they would dearly
[44:34] love to be here.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; And so let's pray for them as as let
[44:38] let's pray that God will make a way
[44:41] because what they're striving to do is
[44:44] to be able to be here with their
[44:45] families. And so we just want to pray
[44:48] that God will arrange that.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Are you happy?
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Good. Good. That's good. Amen. Well,
[44:57] I'll have you turn in your Bibles.
[45:00] Thank you musicians. And
[45:04] we'll turn to the book of Exodus,
[45:06] please.
[45:10] Uh the third chapter,
[45:16] and we'll begin reading at the first
[45:18] verse.
[45:27] I want you to be thinking about this
[45:32] this year that we've just uh entered
[45:35] into.
[45:36] This is January
[45:38] 2012.
[45:41] In not not too very long. Just a maybe 3
[45:45] 4 months down the road or so. We will
[45:48] have been here 40 years
[45:51] as our 40th anniversary this year.
[45:55] starting from the old Bible way house
[45:58] and here we are. Who would ever thought
[46:00] it?
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And if time should go on, uh, who knows
[46:05] what God has in his mind? I'll tell you,
[46:08] we're not here, and this will certainly
[46:10] be in harmony with my message this
[46:12] morning. We're not here by accident.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You're not here by accident.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are, young or
[46:20] old. We're not here by accident.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; We're here by design.
[46:24] Last Sunday we had our brother Francisco
[46:28] here and speaking and perhaps you know
[46:31] he I know it's always a uh uh
[46:36] it's hard to get everything that's on a
[46:38] person's heart when they're speaking
[46:39] through a translator as he had to last
[46:42] Sunday. But uh in in speaking privately
[46:46] with him, you know, he just he said,
[46:50] "Why don't you think about, you know,
[46:53] Latin America?" And and and we having a
[46:57] meeting this spring, could you come
[46:59] down? I said, "No, I wouldn't be able
[47:00] to." But he said, "Well, then next year,
[47:03] the following year, 2013." you know,
[47:05] whatever whatever the Lord has in mind,
[47:08] you know, but uh he just was asking
[47:12] myself and I I just feel him because
[47:14] he's asking the congregation, why don't
[47:17] we think more about the the Mexico and
[47:21] Central America and South America and
[47:24] and I told him in all sincerity, I said,
[47:26] I've always left that to the people in
[47:28] Arizona and down in Texas and those, you
[47:30] know, I've just left I I thought there's
[47:33] other places in the world, but he just
[47:36] had uh such a sincerity and you know
[47:39] looking into my face and why don't you
[47:41] think about Latin America and I
[47:45] uh I had to think about my geography for
[47:47] a moment. I said what part of that now
[47:49] is
[47:51] is that Central America, Latin America?
[47:54] And so
[47:56] uh we've got quite a few of you here. So
[47:59] I think you ought to be praying. I
[48:01] thought of you, brother Ron Caldwell. I
[48:03] know you've always had a burden for
[48:04] brother Louise. It's had such a burden
[48:07] for the for South America and we have
[48:11] them here from El Salvador.
[48:14] Uh we have good reason to think about
[48:16] it.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; You've all got loved ones and you have
[48:19] family and you have whatever more
[48:22] country of your heritage and you know
[48:25] sometimes there's something special
[48:26] about that part. So let's think about
[48:29] it. Let's pray about it. And I don't
[48:31] know, brother Francisco. I never met him
[48:34] before officially. He said he was in a
[48:36] meeting when I and brother Jared Smith
[48:38] were down in Mexico City. He said he was
[48:40] there and he was in another meeting, I
[48:42] believe. So uh he was acquainted and I
[48:46] think he's been on quite a few of the
[48:47] meeting streaming but uh I just got a
[48:51] email uh through actually I think as a
[48:54] result of brother Mark Aaho's connection
[48:56] with him and they had had some
[48:58] communication. Brother Ron Caldwell had
[49:01] been in a had met him someplace down
[49:03] there. And so I just put all of this
[49:06] together and I say you know what is it
[49:08] Lord? Is it is it something that you
[49:11] have for us as a congregation to
[49:14] participate in his ministry or that part
[49:18] of the world or his burden for that part
[49:21] of the world? And so would you remember
[49:23] that in prayer
[49:24] &gt;&gt; when it comes your way when it comes
[49:27] across your thoughts just bow take a
[49:30] moment take a little time and pray and
[49:32] say God what is your will for us as a
[49:35] church as a congregation? Amen. And then
[49:38] I was thinking 40 years ago we were you
[49:41] know eight or 10 people in a house. Uh I
[49:46] never had any any thought whatsoever. In
[49:49] fact is my thought was perhaps some of
[49:52] the young people you know will give
[49:54] their hearts to Christ and you know get
[49:56] into some church or something cuz the
[49:58] last thing in the world I expected to
[50:00] ever you know pastor work. I wanted to
[50:03] just do evangelistic work and that kind
[50:06] of thing, but always had missions on my
[50:08] heart. Always had missions and still do.
[50:12] Amen. And that's what the ministry of
[50:14] Jesus Christ is. Is we say missions,
[50:17] it's not in the Bible. Preach the gospel
[50:21] &gt;&gt; to every creature
[50:23] &gt;&gt; that's your neighbor and one across the
[50:26] sea or in Latin America or wherever they
[50:29] are. Hallelujah. And if God puts it in
[50:31] our hands and makes it possible for us,
[50:33] then we do it.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] Let's just have a word of prayer before
[50:38] we read. Father, we've opened your word.
[50:41] Now,
[50:43] these things have been written and
[50:46] inspired by the the Holy Spirit. And now
[50:49] only the Holy Spirit can cause us to
[50:52] know what is to be spoken. So I pray,
[50:54] Father, you will you'll be the one that
[50:57] will speak the word. That would be my
[51:00] voice, oh God. Let it be the Holy Ghost.
[51:03] Father, we need the spirit of God. We
[51:06] don't need just a Sunday morning
[51:07] service, but we want to hear from you.
[51:10] We want instruction from you. We want
[51:12] correction from you. We want your
[51:14] perfect will. And we say, "Thy will be
[51:16] done on earth as it is in heaven."
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender ourselves now in the
[51:21] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; We'll begin reading Exodus 3:1. Now
[51:28] Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[51:30] father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And
[51:33] he led the flock to the backside of the
[51:35] desert, and came to the mountain of God,
[51:38] even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[51:41] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[51:44] of the midst of a bush. And he looked,
[51:46] and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[51:49] and the bush was not consumed. And Moses
[51:52] said, "I will now turn aside and see the
[51:54] this great sight why the bush is not
[51:57] burnt." And when the Lord saw that he
[51:59] turned aside to see, God called unto him
[52:02] out of the midst of the bush and said,
[52:04] "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am
[52:07] I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither.
[52:10] Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
[52:13] the place whereon thou standest is holy
[52:15] ground."
[52:17] Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy
[52:19] father, the God of Abraham, the God of
[52:21] Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses
[52:25] hid his face, for he was afraid to look
[52:27] upon God. And the Lord said, "I have
[52:31] surely seen the affliction of my people
[52:33] which are in Egypt, and have heard their
[52:35] cry by reason of their task masters. For
[52:38] I know their sorrows, and I am come down
[52:42] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[52:44] Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
[52:46] their out of that land unto a good land,
[52:49] and a large unto a land flowing with
[52:52] milk and honey, unto the place of the
[52:55] Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
[52:57] Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
[52:59] Hivites, and the Jebusites. And
[53:02] therefore, behold, the cry of the
[53:04] children of Israel is come unto me, and
[53:06] I have also seen the oppression
[53:08] wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
[53:11] Come now, therefore, and I will send
[53:13] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[53:16] bring forth my people, the children of
[53:18] Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said
[53:21] unto God, "Who am I that I should go
[53:25] unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring
[53:28] forth the children of Israel out of
[53:30] Egypt?" And he said, "Certainly I will
[53:33] be with thee, and this shall be a token
[53:35] unto thee, that I have sent thee, when
[53:39] thou hast brought forth the people out
[53:41] of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this
[53:44] mountain."
[53:46] And Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I
[53:49] come unto the children of Israel, and
[53:51] shall say unto them, the God of our
[53:53] fathers hath sent me unto you." And they
[53:56] shall say unto me, What is his name?
[54:00] What shall I say unto them? And God said
[54:03] unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said,
[54:06] "Thus shalt thou say unto the children
[54:09] of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you."
[54:13] And God said, "Moreover, unto Moses,
[54:15] thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[54:18] Israel, the Lord God of your fathers,
[54:20] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[54:22] and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto
[54:25] you. This is my name forever, and this
[54:28] is my memorial unto all generations.
[54:32] Go and gather the elders of Israel
[54:35] together and say unto them, "The Lord
[54:38] God of your fathers,
[54:40] the God of Abraham, the of Isaac, and of
[54:43] Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have
[54:46] surely visited you and seen that which
[54:50] is done to you in Egypt." God bless you
[54:55] as you have your seats.
[55:03] I'll ask for your kind attention and
[55:06] seek not to be distracted if possible.
[55:12] I know that when the prophet of God
[55:16] gathered the people together, especially
[55:18] when the angel of the Lord was coming
[55:20] near and he would ask the people because
[55:23] he said every human has a spirit. And so
[55:26] that I know has a big application.
[55:30] And I'm not a prophet. We're but we are
[55:34] sons of this word. And so we have the
[55:37] same principles. The Bible is full of
[55:38] principles. And what I will speak on
[55:41] today, I I want to seek to present to
[55:44] you some principles that are very very
[55:48] important in my in my mind. I want to uh
[55:52] speak to you and I want to put this
[55:55] title in your mind. Who shall I say sent
[55:58] me?
[56:01] I want you to think about that.
[56:04] Who shall I say sent me?
[56:07] What is his name?
[56:10] And what shall I say unto them?
[56:14] You know, I thought each one of us
[56:16] actually have had a Moses experience
[56:20] someplace. You're here, at least most of
[56:23] you, if not all of you are here because
[56:26] at some point in your life,
[56:29] you met God.
[56:32] You had a meeting. You had something
[56:34] happen to you that turned you around. In
[56:37] some cases, your life was turned upside
[56:40] down. In others it was probably not as
[56:44] dramatic. Those are born into Christian
[56:47] homes into believing homes. You kind of
[56:49] grew up with the knowledge of it and you
[56:52] knew what was right and you knew what
[56:54] was wrong etc. But then came a special
[56:56] moment. Then came a special meeting and
[56:59] you met God. something dramatic happened
[57:04] and and then you you know uh you begin
[57:07] to express it and you begin to show it
[57:09] to others and and uh well I had this
[57:12] kind of experience I I met God and uh
[57:16] who shall I who shall I say sent me
[57:20] because you've been sent to somebody
[57:21] that's where I'm going you've been sent
[57:23] to somebody and and then people you find
[57:26] they don't understand it
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and then it's it's it's really uh you
[57:32] know it puts a person into a bit of a
[57:34] kind of a quandry. They don't
[57:36] understand. And Moses perceived that
[57:39] that was going to happen. Who I say sent
[57:41] me? H how how what what what's your
[57:43] name? Uh they'll ask me what his name
[57:46] is. And he was trying to bring into
[57:48] focus here. He's talking to a voice
[57:51] coming out of a burning bush and he
[57:53] knows it's the God of the fathers
[57:55] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How's he
[57:58] going to convey that to the people? And
[58:00] friends, uh, as the bride of Jesus
[58:03] Christ, I want to separate in your mind
[58:05] today also the difference between that
[58:09] kind of a meeting with God and and and
[58:11] and tradition.
[58:14] Uh, and I'm I'm going to be bringing it
[58:15] right home to message tradition. We're
[58:18] not here as a matter of tradition.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Uh, now we we could say, well, it's
[58:23] tradition. I always Sunday morning
[58:25] always go to church. And Sunday morning,
[58:27] you get up, you start getting ready for
[58:29] church because we always go to church.
[58:33] We're not here because we go to church
[58:35] Sunday morning. We're here because, and
[58:38] it has to be, we have to separate it
[58:40] from that. And we're here because we
[58:43] want to hear. We anticipate to hear from
[58:46] God. We're here because we want to
[58:49] worship. It's in our heart. We want to
[58:52] we want to register once again our love
[58:54] and our devotion, our surrender to this
[58:56] living God. We're not here because we go
[58:58] to church on Sunday morning.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Moses. So as I go through the things
[59:05] that Moses experienced, you will have
[59:09] experienced or may be experiencing
[59:11] these. Once we have met God face to face
[59:18] uh our whole life in every part is
[59:20] changed. In the message thirsting for
[59:23] life,
[59:25] brother Brandham says how did this great
[59:27] pillar of fire the angel of God the
[59:30] logos that went out of God. So pillar of
[59:33] fire the logos the angel of God that led
[59:37] the children of Israel through the
[59:39] wilderness. when it come among the
[59:41] people, it separated itself and great
[59:44] licks of fire begin to come upon each
[59:47] one. Speaking now on the day of
[59:49] Pentecost. So it goes right from the
[59:50] burning bush to the day of Pentecost.
[59:53] And each one as the pillar of fire begin
[59:55] to break up. God dividing himself among
[59:59] his people. God tearing himself apart
[1:00:02] that he might divide himself a little
[1:00:05] bit with each one of us. Not them.
[1:00:08] usmen,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; that same one. So, he's gone right from
[1:00:15] the logos that went out of the bosom of
[1:00:17] God, brought it right down to the
[1:00:19] burning bush, brought it over to
[1:00:20] Pentecost, and brought it right down to
[1:00:22] here.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Same one, God tearing himself apart so
[1:00:27] we each one
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; could have a part. And Wyatt had to be
[1:00:32] shepherd said, "No man has a right to
[1:00:34] enter the sacred desk where I stand
[1:00:36] today."
[1:00:38] uh until he has done as Moses did, meet
[1:00:42] God himself upon grounds where there's
[1:00:47] no theologian can explain it away.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And I can say there's no friend that can
[1:00:52] explain it away. There's no relative
[1:00:54] that can explain it away. There's no
[1:00:57] relationship on earth that can explain
[1:00:59] it away.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; You can't forget a revelation. You can
[1:01:04] forget being taught. say, "Well, I can't
[1:01:07] remember that." Uh, you might remember,
[1:01:10] you might forget being convinced by
[1:01:12] somebody or being talked into something,
[1:01:15] but you will never forget a revelation
[1:01:18] because it actually becomes a part of
[1:01:19] your being.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; And it's as real today as it was 10
[1:01:24] years ago, one year ago, 50 years ago,
[1:01:26] or however long. It it doesn't get old.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:01:35] perhaps
[1:01:37] now considered himself
[1:01:40] a shepherd,
[1:01:43] married,
[1:01:45] one or two children,
[1:01:48] and his life had been really turned
[1:01:52] around.
[1:01:53] Follow me and let's follow him.
[1:01:58] And the scripture says in Acts 7:22,
[1:02:01] "And Moses was learned in all all the
[1:02:04] wisdom of Egypt, the superpower of the
[1:02:08] earth, in all the wisdom of e of the
[1:02:11] Egyptians and was mighty in words and
[1:02:14] deeds." Brother Brandham speaks about
[1:02:16] the film of the ten commandments and it
[1:02:19] brings this kind of home. Oh, he was a
[1:02:22] mighty man. He was a man of victory and
[1:02:25] war and had great power and the next
[1:02:28] pharaoh coming up and and it was just an
[1:02:32] incredible place that God allowed him to
[1:02:35] rise to and now in an effort to express
[1:02:40] something. The Bible says he he he
[1:02:42] looked upon his brethren
[1:02:45] something was burning something was
[1:02:47] stirring. What was there was his call.
[1:02:49] Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; But he he couldn't understand that of
[1:02:52] course. And brother Brandham said he
[1:02:54] looked out the same window that Pharaoh
[1:02:56] looked out. And when Pharaoh looked out,
[1:02:58] he saw slaves and mudbers.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And when Moses looked out, he saw the
[1:03:03] elect of God.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; So what was inside of him uh caused him
[1:03:09] to see things differently than the rest
[1:03:11] of the people. What's inside of you
[1:03:13] causes you to see things in the world
[1:03:15] differently than anyone else. And you
[1:03:18] can't explain it always because it's
[1:03:20] it's something divine within you and you
[1:03:23] see the world differently. And so Moses
[1:03:26] in in that that that burden that uh that
[1:03:31] call that was within him. He he thought
[1:03:34] they would understand when a man as
[1:03:36] great as he was was going to try to uh
[1:03:39] deliver and he saw one of the task
[1:03:41] masters or an Egyptian uh uh dealing
[1:03:45] with a a Hebrew and he went and slew him
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; and hit him in the sand. Isn't it
[1:03:50] amazing that when you try to do
[1:03:52] something for God, it can go just
[1:03:55] backwards
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; or in your mind it's backwards.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; In your mind, he went full speed in
[1:04:02] reverse.
[1:04:03] from the great great palaces and
[1:04:06] beautiful carpets
[1:04:09] of of that era and that time and the
[1:04:12] wisdom as brother Brandham says they had
[1:04:15] wisdom to to prepare a body uh and and
[1:04:19] to to you know to have a body prepared
[1:04:22] so that they remain to this day. uh they
[1:04:27] you know such wisdom and such such a
[1:04:30] great nation and wisdom that we don't
[1:04:32] even have yet today. And and here he is
[1:04:36] he he's learned in all the wisdom of
[1:04:39] Egypt and now he's out there hurting
[1:04:42] sheep.
[1:04:44] Now that's full cycle.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I mean he's really gone full cycle in
[1:04:52] reverse really.
[1:04:54] So now he sees himself as a
[1:04:57] shepherd.
[1:04:59] He's living with his father-in-law and
[1:05:01] the other relatives and married to this
[1:05:05] girl and got a child or two and he's in
[1:05:09] a desert.
[1:05:11] I don't think there's a single believer
[1:05:14] here listening to me today. But what I
[1:05:17] should convey to you as believers, we
[1:05:20] have wilderness experiences.
[1:05:22] As believers, we have things that happen
[1:05:26] that appear to be completely in reverse
[1:05:29] of what we expected
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; or should expect. Here we have a message
[1:05:34] and here we have a uh the greatest
[1:05:36] ministry that is we've embraced it, but
[1:05:39] yet things in life seem to go in reverse
[1:05:42] for us. But we need a wilderness. We do
[1:05:45] need a wilderness experience. A man
[1:05:48] learned in all the wisdom of the
[1:05:50] Egyptians.
[1:05:51] And I want you to uh as I'm preparing to
[1:05:55] bring the service to you, I want you to
[1:05:57] think about what was going through
[1:06:00] Moses' mind
[1:06:04] as he turned as he turned things around
[1:06:06] in his mind. I tell you what, he had a
[1:06:08] lot to think about.
[1:06:12] I
[1:06:14] I lived in all its glory. I lived in
[1:06:17] with all his power. My word was law.
[1:06:22] Uh, I I I went and fought armies. I had
[1:06:25] armies under me and I had great
[1:06:27] victories and all of this great Egyptian
[1:06:32] kingdom was essentially in my hands
[1:06:36] just a short time ago. And now here I am
[1:06:41] with the shape. And who am I? Nobody.
[1:06:46] My name Moses. Moses. Moses.
[1:06:51] Now I'm out here. All I hear is the wind
[1:06:53] and the sand and blowing in my eyes. And
[1:06:57] that's I'm talking about reality. I'm
[1:06:59] talking about real things. I'm talking
[1:07:01] about real life. I had the riches of the
[1:07:04] earth in my hands and now I'm just
[1:07:07] trying to ek out a living. I'm out here
[1:07:10] hurting sheep for some food.
[1:07:20] Your quietness almost ma makes me think
[1:07:22] that you've been there
[1:07:28] in manifesting his gifts.
[1:07:32] He like you perhaps have thought I'm a
[1:07:35] total failure.
[1:07:39] Once when I got feeling about as small
[1:07:41] as a person could feel was when brother
[1:07:44] Brandham was and I were sitting on the
[1:07:47] mountain side and he and it was just
[1:07:50] after just after months after he'd had
[1:07:53] beyond the curtain of time and he put
[1:07:56] his and here I am you know 27 years old
[1:08:00] and just kind of seeing what the future
[1:08:03] might be in the ministry and he puts his
[1:08:06] hand behind his head like go.
[1:08:09] And he said,
[1:08:11] "Well, William Brandham, if you're Bill
[1:08:13] Brandham," he said, "If you're going to
[1:08:15] do anything for God, you better get up
[1:08:17] and get going." And I just I thought,
[1:08:20] "Here's a man perhaps getting hundreds
[1:08:23] of thousands of letters every month and
[1:08:26] speaking to tens of thousands and
[1:08:28] hundreds of thousands of people. And to
[1:08:31] have him feel, if you're going to do
[1:08:32] anything for God, you better get up and
[1:08:34] get going." I just naturally thought
[1:08:38] what hope do I have
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; in view of this kind of a statement you
[1:08:43] know but each one each one
[1:08:48] has a part when Jesus saw them throwing
[1:08:51] their money into the treasury and the
[1:08:54] woman came in and just put her in her
[1:08:56] just pennies as it were and Jesus didn't
[1:09:00] say now relatively speaking he didn't
[1:09:03] say that he said she hath put in more
[1:09:06] than they all.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; So her little part was more than
[1:09:11] everyone else. So we have to see things
[1:09:13] through God's uh God's way of looking at
[1:09:16] it. He said, "How is it in the days of
[1:09:18] Moses the prophet, how that Moses was
[1:09:22] born a servant of the Lord and was
[1:09:24] raised up in all the wisdom of the
[1:09:26] Egyptians, he was a polished scholar.
[1:09:29] And when he had mastered all the wisdom
[1:09:31] and the learning of the Egyptians, it
[1:09:33] seems like he had been in the wonderful
[1:09:36] condition to deliver his people. For he
[1:09:39] was the commanding general in all of
[1:09:41] Egypt.
[1:09:43] He was an heir to the throne. And every
[1:09:46] right of education that a man could
[1:09:49] receive, Moses had it. But God could not
[1:09:53] use one of those qualities.
[1:09:56] And we find him taking his servant Moses
[1:10:00] to the backside of the desert to herd
[1:10:03] his father-in-law Jethro's shape. So,
[1:10:07] brother Benham describes really what he
[1:10:09] had come to, but he couldn't use one of
[1:10:12] those qualities. So what went in on what
[1:10:15] went on in the inside of of Moses
[1:10:20] uh and and what had happened to him? It
[1:10:23] it must have been a very trying time for
[1:10:26] him. And out of this burden for his
[1:10:28] soul, out of the burden of his soul,
[1:10:32] watch this closely now. out of the
[1:10:34] burden of his soul. In other words, it
[1:10:36] was God literally driving him because he
[1:10:40] felt that he was called to deliver these
[1:10:43] people and he does something with his
[1:10:46] human strength and ends up in the
[1:10:49] wilderness.
[1:10:50] So, I think I'm making my point. Moses
[1:10:53] looking out the same window that Pharaoh
[1:10:56] did, which I quoted a moment ago, upon
[1:10:59] the same people Pharaoh called them
[1:11:01] mudbers. That's all. They were just a
[1:11:05] bunch of slaves. But by faith, that's
[1:11:09] why I like to read the quote. But by
[1:11:11] faith, Moses saw them to be the promised
[1:11:15] people. Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And when Moses was grown, the scripture
[1:11:19] says that he went out unto his brethren
[1:11:22] and looked upon their burden and he
[1:11:25] spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one
[1:11:28] of his brethren and he went and slew
[1:11:30] that man where he he went to to protect
[1:11:33] his uh deliver his Hebrew brother from
[1:11:36] it. And that was what was so
[1:11:38] misunderstood.
[1:11:41] There comes a time when the purpose of
[1:11:44] God in your life and my life, it comes a
[1:11:49] time when that purpose of God takes
[1:11:52] precedent and control over
[1:11:56] all of what we perhaps have been
[1:11:58] educated. There's nothing wrong with
[1:12:00] education. But there has to come a time
[1:12:02] when that which is inside of you takes
[1:12:05] precedent over that and controls that.
[1:12:08] You might be a very gifted person. Uh uh
[1:12:12] when I look at the bride of Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ, we see them all the way from you
[1:12:16] know people who labor with their hands,
[1:12:18] people who labor with their minds.
[1:12:21] It's it's that's irrelevant.
[1:12:24] People who have good retention of mind
[1:12:27] or people who don't can't remember
[1:12:29] hardly what their name is. That's
[1:12:31] irrelevant. God can use one as equally
[1:12:33] as much as the other one. It's it's
[1:12:36] what's surrendered to God. But there has
[1:12:38] to come a time when all of that the the
[1:12:41] the purpose of God inside takes
[1:12:43] precedent over that.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; I want to dwell on that in a few
[1:12:51] moments.
[1:12:52] And the call of God in our lives doesn't
[1:12:56] only take precedent, but it takes
[1:12:57] precedent over all the world can offer
[1:13:01] you.
[1:13:02] Because the world, I tell you what,
[1:13:05] there's qualities that the believer has
[1:13:07] that the world hasn't got and never will
[1:13:10] attain to.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; There are qualities that you have.
[1:13:14] Listen to me, friends. There are
[1:13:16] qualities that you have the world will
[1:13:18] never have.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; They can't have it because it comes from
[1:13:22] God. But the world would like to use it.
[1:13:25] The world would like to use your level
[1:13:27] of dedication and your level of honesty
[1:13:31] and your level of integrity. It just
[1:13:34] isn't available in the world.
[1:13:40] When Moses risked his life to do God's
[1:13:43] will,
[1:13:45] when he risked his life to do God's
[1:13:47] will,
[1:13:49] being driven by his vision, his
[1:13:52] conviction, his he knew that these were
[1:13:55] his brethren and he knew the situation
[1:13:57] was not correct and he was going to
[1:14:00] correct it. He was going to do it but
[1:14:02] and he risked his life for it. That's
[1:14:04] when it turned upside down.
[1:14:06] Even when he risked his life and he
[1:14:08] ended up in the wilderness. Born again
[1:14:11] believers all experience, they all
[1:14:14] experience a wilderness where they
[1:14:16] discover that God doesn't need their
[1:14:21] human talents. God doesn't need all the
[1:14:25] things that perhaps we think are so
[1:14:27] great. But what we need is a
[1:14:30] supernatural God. Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; We don't need all of the other things.
[1:14:35] That doesn't say that we disregard them.
[1:14:37] No, we don't disregard them. God didn't
[1:14:41] God didn't take all the learning of
[1:14:43] Apostle Paul. He just arranged it. He
[1:14:47] rearranged it. He was still Apostle
[1:14:50] Paul. Peter was still uh presumptuous
[1:14:53] Peter, but God used those qualities in
[1:14:57] them. He didn't take them out from them.
[1:15:01] And then the scripture says, "Come now
[1:15:03] therefore,
[1:15:04] and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and
[1:15:08] thou that thou mayest bring forth my
[1:15:11] people, the children of e Israel, out of
[1:15:15] Egypt. Come now, therefore, and I will
[1:15:18] send." Being sent. Now, I want to We're
[1:15:23] going to start focusing down. Now being
[1:15:26] sent is not being contracted
[1:15:31] or being retained.
[1:15:33] We retain lawyers and retain certain
[1:15:36] people.
[1:15:37] Uh
[1:15:39] being sent isn't somebody that just
[1:15:41] collects a fee. Being sent isn't being
[1:15:44] hired. Being sent there's something
[1:15:47] already within the person that is that
[1:15:50] has put them in this position. I will
[1:15:54] send you.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't feel sent hurting sheep, but
[1:15:57] he said, I'm going to send you and
[1:16:00] you're going to do this. You're going to
[1:16:01] bring out my people. So, a person could
[1:16:04] be experienced all of these things, but
[1:16:06] the Bible says this that we are workers
[1:16:10] or we are laborers together. We are
[1:16:13] workers. we have and I want to separate
[1:16:18] uh you today and I'm going to finally
[1:16:21] come to the quote I have it in two
[1:16:23] places where brother Brandham said of
[1:16:25] himself that he came to the realization
[1:16:28] he came to the place where he realized
[1:16:31] he was not the son
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; of Charles and Ella Brham
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; he was a son of God
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; he was sent with a mission He was sent
[1:16:45] with a purpose. And I believe friends
[1:16:47] with everything that's in me, it is one
[1:16:50] realization you and I need to come to.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; We are not here just by our natural. In
[1:16:58] fact is I would say that in the in the
[1:17:01] view of God, God ordained everything. He
[1:17:04] watched over everything and and and
[1:17:06] coming on down from generation to
[1:17:08] generation to generation. But we are too
[1:17:10] attached to our natural heritage. We're
[1:17:14] too attached to our natural qualities or
[1:17:18] weaknesses.
[1:17:19] We're too attached to them. We need to
[1:17:22] be separated from them. And the thing
[1:17:24] that should dominate our minds is, I've
[1:17:26] been sent here by almighty God. I was
[1:17:30] sent here by design. God ordained that I
[1:17:34] would hear a certain truth that would
[1:17:37] turn my life around and perhaps move me
[1:17:40] physically from one place to another and
[1:17:43] perhaps take me from the heights to the
[1:17:46] depths or from the depths to the
[1:17:48] heights. That's all irrelevant. But once
[1:17:51] I surrendered my life to God, I became a
[1:17:54] son of God. I became a daughter of God.
[1:17:57] And that's what I am.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I am. By the grace of God,
[1:18:04] I'm a daughter of God. You women want to
[1:18:07] say that today. I'm not just preaching.
[1:18:09] I'm instructing you. I'm a daughter of
[1:18:12] God.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the men would say that. I am
[1:18:19] a son of God.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Will the daughters please say I'm a
[1:18:23] daughter of God?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; And that's why I came.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I came here with a special design. Moses
[1:18:31] came to to meet the burning bush.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't come just to be saved by
[1:18:36] Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That only set the, you know, the
[1:18:40] paradox.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Almost unbelievable yet true.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It was necessary that the crocodiles
[1:18:48] wouldn't get him.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; It was necessary that his mother and
[1:18:52] father saw him as a fair child and put
[1:18:54] him in a basket. It was necessary that
[1:18:57] Pharaoh's daughter find him. It was
[1:18:59] necessary that he be learned in all the
[1:19:01] wisdom of Egypt. Why? So he could forget
[1:19:03] it.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; That was part of that was part of the
[1:19:09] quality of God. So he could forget it.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Some of you have turned down
[1:19:15] maybe being, you know, with your family.
[1:19:18] Some of you perhaps turned down uh
[1:19:20] prosperity or you turned down a better
[1:19:23] life or you turned down who knows what
[1:19:25] you turned down.
[1:19:28] And it's not always that way.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; God can put great things in a person's
[1:19:34] hand, but it is only to be a tool for
[1:19:39] him for the kingdom of God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And I see you young men and young ladies
[1:19:44] here who you do not you do not know your
[1:19:48] future. And I certainly don't know your
[1:19:50] future and your parents don't know your
[1:19:52] future. But you need some principles. If
[1:19:54] anybody needed principles in their life,
[1:19:56] it's you young people.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You needed principles. You really need
[1:20:00] to listen and hear, brother Biscll this
[1:20:02] morning. You need principles in your
[1:20:05] life?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Because you're the ones that's going to
[1:20:07] face should I or shouldn't I?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Do I go this way or don't I go this way?
[1:20:12] Do I take this great opportunity or
[1:20:14] don't I take it or what do I do? You
[1:20:17] need these principles.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I don't need them so much. You need
[1:20:21] them.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching for you. I'm not preaching
[1:20:24] for my own good. I'm preaching for you.
[1:20:26] Preaching for the families
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; of this congregation and whoever may
[1:20:30] hear this. We need the principles of the
[1:20:33] scripture
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; and they are here
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and to send. He says, "I will send you."
[1:20:42] And that's send in the Hebrew. I will to
[1:20:45] send one. But it's also to stretch out
[1:20:49] to stretch out as God says concerning I
[1:20:52] will stretch out my hand.
[1:20:55] It was amazing
[1:20:58] because God says I will stretch out my
[1:21:00] hand over Egypt.
[1:21:02] And then he said to Moses, you stretch
[1:21:05] out your hand.
[1:21:07] That's how God stretched out his hand.
[1:21:10] God. If God has ever stretched out his
[1:21:13] hand to a generation, it was in this
[1:21:16] hour.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And I found it really, you know, almost
[1:21:21] uh peculiar that the first thing the
[1:21:24] prophet of God did, he said, "You'll
[1:21:26] have two signs like Moses."
[1:21:28] And he started taking people by the
[1:21:30] hand. And I, it all came back to me. I
[1:21:33] sat there and I saw the prophet stretch
[1:21:35] out his hand. That was God stretching
[1:21:37] out his hand to this generation. And now
[1:21:41] his hand is not here, but yours is here.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You stretched out your hand and gave out
[1:21:46] a track. You stretched out your hand and
[1:21:49] gave out a book. You stretched out your
[1:21:51] hand and shook someone's hand. It's God
[1:21:54] stretching out his hand. You might think
[1:21:56] that is humorous, but it's not. It's
[1:21:59] very real. It's God stretching out his
[1:22:01] hand in your life
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; to this lost generation.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; A light shining through you to in a very
[1:22:11] dark place.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; God stretching out his hand.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; I trust it's doing something for you.
[1:22:20] And the scripture says Jesus saying,
[1:22:22] "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[1:22:25] harvest that he will send laborers as
[1:22:28] workers
[1:22:30] into the not just preachers but workers.
[1:22:33] When when someone is sent from God, they
[1:22:37] definitely have a purpose.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I want to impress this congregation. I
[1:22:43] want to impress the young people. You
[1:22:46] are here with a purpose.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I wish someone had told me that when I
[1:22:50] was 10, 12 years old.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, you have a purpose.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Are you young fellas listening to me?
[1:22:58] You have a purpose. Your parents don't
[1:23:01] know what it is. You don't know what it
[1:23:03] is. The preacher doesn't know what it
[1:23:05] is. But you have a purpose.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make a separation. Your
[1:23:09] purpose here is not just to live a tr,
[1:23:12] you know, a traditional Christian life.
[1:23:14] Your purpose here is to understand God
[1:23:17] sent me here.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; That's your purpose. That's where you
[1:23:22] start. God sent me here.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. How are you up in the
[1:23:29] balcony? You're getting it. Glory to
[1:23:32] God. God sent me here.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You are what you are. You're doing what
[1:23:37] you're doing because God wants you there
[1:23:40] for his purpose,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; not for the purpose of your employer
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; or the purpose of of someone else or the
[1:23:48] purpose of your family. We're we're
[1:23:50] there to, you know, serve the people,
[1:23:52] but that's not our purpose. We're here
[1:23:54] with a divine purpose. And I that could
[1:23:57] become as a reality. And I pray that the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost makes that a reality within
[1:24:02] you. I'm here because God sent me here.
[1:24:05] I'm not here because mom and dad decide
[1:24:07] to have another child. I'm not here
[1:24:10] because I'm an accident. I'm not here
[1:24:12] for any other reason. I'm here because
[1:24:14] God sent me here.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your background is.
[1:24:18] There may be somebody here who says, "I
[1:24:20] don't even know who my parents are. I
[1:24:21] don't know who I've been adopted. I
[1:24:23] don't know who my mother is. I don't
[1:24:24] know who my father is, but God knows who
[1:24:27] you are.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; God sent you here. And you might come
[1:24:32] from the most perfect, the most
[1:24:34] understanding home and family and all
[1:24:35] the rest of it that has great uh hopes
[1:24:38] for you. And that's beside the point.
[1:24:40] That's irrelevant. It's God that's got
[1:24:42] plans for you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And I want to make you aware of God's
[1:24:46] plans today. I'll tell you what,
[1:24:47] friends. I am burning up.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I couldn't hardly wait to get to this
[1:24:51] pulpit to give you this message. God
[1:24:54] sent you here.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; This bride is here with a mission.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And the things that have happened in
[1:25:02] your life, God's not God's not unaware
[1:25:05] of it. God knows every detail.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he can use the most
[1:25:10] catastrophic thing. He can use the death
[1:25:13] of someone in your family. And I know
[1:25:15] there are some here lost your loved ones
[1:25:17] and you lost your you lost your
[1:25:19] partners. God understands all of that.
[1:25:22] God can understand and he not only that
[1:25:24] he has a plan and he can take he can
[1:25:27] take the things that the most reversal
[1:25:29] what more reverse could you think of
[1:25:31] than the palaces of the super country
[1:25:34] and to be a shepherd
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I don't think any presidents of the
[1:25:40] United States went from the presidency
[1:25:42] to be a shepherd
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; but here we have a here here we have the
[1:25:46] pharaoh of the Egyptian country and
[1:25:48] sometimes we are inclined to think you
[1:25:51] know I've been a failure I don't want
[1:25:52] anybody to think of that. I want you to
[1:25:55] think first, I'm a son of God. And if
[1:25:58] I'm a failure, I'll let my father turn
[1:26:00] it around.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I'll let my father instruct me.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll let my father show me
[1:26:08] the way.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my heart in the right
[1:26:11] place so he can do whatever he wants to
[1:26:14] do. Oh my Jesus, I love thee. I know
[1:26:18] thou art mine. For thee all the follyies
[1:26:21] of sin I resign. My gracious redeemer,
[1:26:24] my savior art thou. If ever I love thee,
[1:26:27] my Jesus is now.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's the attitude.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "And God doesn't call a man to
[1:26:45] judgment without first warning him."
[1:26:48] said, "God has put us here on earth." I
[1:26:51] want you to absorb this. I want you to
[1:26:53] put me in there. God has sent me here on
[1:26:56] earth for a reason.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And that reason that he has put me here
[1:27:01] for, we are responsible to him for that
[1:27:06] reason.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; You should go to him and find out what
[1:27:10] he wants you to do. And I think perhaps
[1:27:13] there's a number in the congregation.
[1:27:15] You're sitting there today. You need to
[1:27:17] ask him, "Father, I've heard today from
[1:27:21] the man of God that preached the word of
[1:27:23] God that I'm here for a divine purpose,
[1:27:27] and now I ask you, what would you have
[1:27:29] me to do?"
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You should find out what he wants you to
[1:27:37] do. He said, "If you're working for a
[1:27:39] man, you find out what your duty is."
[1:27:42] And then
[1:27:44] if our life on this earth here, he said,
[1:27:48] "And then if our life is on this earth,
[1:27:52] the earth here, then we should go to the
[1:27:55] one who put us here."
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Young people, it's not necessarily going
[1:28:02] to your parents. You honor your mother
[1:28:04] and your father. That's what this word
[1:28:05] says. But the one you need to go to is
[1:28:09] your heavenly parent. Father, what would
[1:28:12] you have me to do?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And listen, he doesn't talk about great
[1:28:20] people. He says, "What must I do? Why I
[1:28:24] why am I here?" If it's to be a
[1:28:27] housewife,
[1:28:30] that's number one that he talks about.
[1:28:33] If it's to be a dishwasher,
[1:28:36] if it's to be whatever God wants you to
[1:28:39] be or to do, then he says, then you do
[1:28:42] that very best that you know how to do
[1:28:45] it.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get these dishes the very
[1:28:48] cleanest I know how to get them.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a huge amen to all of that.
[1:28:56] I'm going to be the best housewife in
[1:28:58] the world
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a daughter of God.
[1:29:02] I'm going to be the best whatever.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how little Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; No matter how little it is, you must do
[1:29:20] it.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Thus said the prophet God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the secret. Here's the
[1:29:31] secret. You want me to let you in on a
[1:29:34] secret?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. The secret's the spoken word, the
[1:29:38] original seed.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; At least that's where it comes from.
[1:29:45] Jesus never did anything until he seen
[1:29:47] the father or the father showed him.
[1:29:51] Wasn't Mary or Joseph or the synagogue
[1:29:53] or the archbishop that showed him. It
[1:29:55] wasn't the pastor. It wasn't the father
[1:29:58] showed him first. John 5:19.
[1:30:02] So will the bride.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Your bride.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; So will the bride.
[1:30:08] He shows her his word
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; of life.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; He shows her. He said it again. And she
[1:30:15] receives it
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; and she never doubts it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; He shows his bride his word.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And she will receive it
[1:30:27] and she never doubts it." And he said,
[1:30:30] "Here is the secret."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a secret.
[1:30:38] The word is in the bride.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you need to find out that
[1:30:44] secret.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; The word is in you.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. to know what he wants done with
[1:31:01] the word.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hello folks.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I'm either wasting my time or you're
[1:31:07] wasting your time. But if this is true,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; If this is true, the word which is which
[1:31:13] is actually Christ the being
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; the creator
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; who created all things
[1:31:21] is in you.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have to take this beyond
[1:31:26] preaching.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And you have to take it beyond just
[1:31:30] hearing something.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; If this is just a Sunday morning
[1:31:34] service, that's tradition.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive anything by
[1:31:39] tradition.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You've got to say this is a reality.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; These words are absolutely true. I don't
[1:31:45] know about all the scientific things out
[1:31:48] there. I don't know all about this
[1:31:49] world. I may not understand everything
[1:31:50] about economics and politics and all the
[1:31:53] rest of it, but we have to know one
[1:31:56] thing. God, I am a son of God. I'm a
[1:31:59] daughter of God and a prophet of God.
[1:32:02] God, I do know he was sent.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; I don't doubt that he was sent.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; If he was sent, who was he sent to? He
[1:32:13] was sent to us. He was sent to me. And
[1:32:16] he was sent to say, "Here's the secret.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; This is the secret.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; The word is in you."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[1:32:27] you know what to do with it.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "What shall I do with it?" He
[1:32:33] will show you what to do with it.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I have to believe that this morning.
[1:32:43] Exactly.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I have to believe that before I could go
[1:32:46] up here and preach.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Here's the secret."
[1:32:52] And he said something furthermore, which
[1:32:54] I know this is a reality to you. No one
[1:32:59] can persuade them different.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; They have thus saith the Lord.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, what wonderful realities these are.
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; This is the secret.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; The word is in her and she knows what to
[1:33:15] do with it and she will not doubt it.
[1:33:17] And she has thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Who else has that?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Where else is it?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It's not in the place that you work.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; It's not in the mall.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; You can't buy it.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; It's not at Walmart.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's not any place else. It's not in the
[1:33:38] school system.
[1:33:40] Thank God for the schools school
[1:33:42] building we have.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; We won't get into that.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm I this is at a different level,
[1:33:49] friends. This is at a different level.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You'll only find this you talk about
[1:33:54] mysteries and so on. I'm going to give
[1:33:56] you a scripture in just a moment. In the
[1:33:59] Pergamian church age, brother Brandham
[1:34:01] also says, "Here is the secret of this."
[1:34:04] Now, it almost sounds the same. This
[1:34:06] from the original spoken word in 62 and
[1:34:09] then in the Pergamanian church age which
[1:34:12] he spoke even spoke this much earlier.
[1:34:14] He said here's the secret of this. The
[1:34:17] word is in the bride as it was in Mary.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; So now he brings a little different
[1:34:23] slant to it. The word is in the bride.
[1:34:26] So you say well you don't have to even
[1:34:27] imagine that. He said like it was in
[1:34:29] Mary.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; So she had a conception. The word was in
[1:34:33] her.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Before it was a seed. It was a word
[1:34:36] because it was Isaiah, the word of God
[1:34:38] through Isaiah, thus sayeth the Lord. If
[1:34:40] we can just catch a a an understanding,
[1:34:43] a revelation of the power of that word.
[1:34:46] When a prophet of God speaks it, it's
[1:34:48] not the man speaking, his voice, but not
[1:34:51] him speaking. It's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:34:54] And Isaiah said, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:34:56] conceive." We don't know who the virgin
[1:34:58] was. We don't know what the
[1:35:00] circumstances. We don't know what era.
[1:35:02] We don't know what day. We don't know
[1:35:04] how old she's going to be. We don't know
[1:35:06] anything. All we know is he said it
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and he's a vindicated prophet and it's
[1:35:12] going to happen
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; and we'll discover it at some point in
[1:35:17] time. It's going to happen. So now the
[1:35:20] prophet says the word is in you
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; like it was in Mary.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; It's a conception.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; How was it in Mary? It was life in Mary.
[1:35:31] It's not just the word in you like you
[1:35:33] read a book
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; or that you heard a tape
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; or that you heard a heard it on disc.
[1:35:39] It's not the word is in you just like
[1:35:41] that. It's not the word is in you like
[1:35:43] you got it in in school or in your
[1:35:45] studies. That's not it. The word is in
[1:35:47] you like it was in Mary.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; It came to life.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; A supernatural life.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I wonder what Mary thought.
[1:36:02] when in her short life
[1:36:04] she be to say, "See
[1:36:08] and hear." They want to make him a king.
[1:36:12] Did you hear? He multiplied the bread.
[1:36:15] He he broke the bread and he only had
[1:36:17] five loaves and and and some fishes. And
[1:36:19] he fed 5,000 people and I picked up 12
[1:36:22] baskets afterwards.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He was in me.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He actually was in me. I actually gave
[1:36:29] birth to this man.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I gave birth to this I gave birth to
[1:36:34] this man. But this is not my life.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; This is something to this is something
[1:36:39] supernatural. This is something divine.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. I'm looking down
[1:36:43] to your faces and I know from uh I know
[1:36:47] that what some of you have gone through,
[1:36:49] you'd have never been persuaded. You
[1:36:51] couldn't be persuaded away from it
[1:36:53] because it became such a reality to you.
[1:36:56] And you would never have chosen this
[1:36:58] unless God had done something so divine
[1:37:01] and supernatural within you.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I want to bring this very very very
[1:37:14] personal to you as it was in Mary the
[1:37:18] bride. And if you can put your hand up
[1:37:20] and say, "I am a member of the bride of
[1:37:24] Jesus Christ." The bride has the mind of
[1:37:28] Christ
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; and she knows what he wants done with
[1:37:32] the word.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, she performs the
[1:37:37] command of the word in the name for he
[1:37:41] for she has thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, those are so powerful.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; She has it. has his mind, has his
[1:37:50] secret, and knows what he wants done.
[1:37:53] Let me ask you, who else knows it?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; How many people know and have a have a
[1:37:58] word from God, have the most vindicated
[1:38:01] messenger that's perhaps ever walked and
[1:38:04] had the opening of the seals, and you
[1:38:07] have it.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And other minds are totally blinded.
[1:38:10] They they don't believe it to begin
[1:38:12] with, but you have it.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "This is
[1:38:15] the secret. Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to go from this
[1:38:20] place saying, "I have a secret. I heard
[1:38:22] it this morning. I never really re
[1:38:24] realized it, but I have a secret." And
[1:38:26] the secret is his word is in me.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; The mysteries of God is in me.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The last message is in me.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And the life of that word is in me.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I know what to do with
[1:38:42] it.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know way into the
[1:38:44] future, but I know what to do with it. I
[1:38:46] know the burden in my heart and if I
[1:38:48] just keep uh pressing in that direction,
[1:38:51] God's going to cause me to live a a
[1:38:53] faithful life.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; All I want to hear is well done.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Thou good and faithful servant, enter
[1:39:01] into the joys of the Lord.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you want it?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that all that we live for?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe some man says, "Well,
[1:39:14] all I did was support my family." You
[1:39:16] did the word of God.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; A wife might say, "All I was was a
[1:39:20] mother." God bless you.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; God gave you to live your life before
[1:39:26] these children as a testimony and a
[1:39:29] witness. And they and they don't have a
[1:39:32] testimony like that anywhere in the
[1:39:34] world.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; You are one in a million.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; That's not just a song, friends. That's
[1:39:41] a reality. Here's one in a billion.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; So John was a man sent from God
[1:39:53] to finish the work.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; And we can say of all the church ages,
[1:39:58] of all the times of the church
[1:40:02] Christianity being present in the world,
[1:40:07] you are here, and I'm going to identify
[1:40:09] a few things. You're here to finish the
[1:40:11] work.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That last one I've seen, you know, I
[1:40:18] used to enjoy sports a great deal and
[1:40:20] and running and jumping and this kind of
[1:40:22] thing, track and field.
[1:40:26] And I'm always interested when I see I
[1:40:28] I'm I'm amazed at those that have
[1:40:30] endurance,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; you know, the 10,000 meter or whatever.
[1:40:36] But it's really exciting to see
[1:40:39] the relay
[1:40:41] and and and how the different teams they
[1:40:44] they save their they save their best for
[1:40:48] that last lap
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; and they run
[1:40:54] and hand that baton to them and away
[1:40:57] that speedster goes just like an
[1:41:00] antelope.
[1:41:02] It's so thrilling to see that last one
[1:41:05] and you talk about you talk about
[1:41:07] competition.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; You'll get competition in that last lap.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Uh it is really something wonderful. And
[1:41:14] here you are the last one. He said a man
[1:41:16] was sent from God. God would not let him
[1:41:19] be contaminated with it. You're talking
[1:41:21] about the systems. He reta he he trained
[1:41:24] him in the wilderness.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; He trained him in the wilderness. You
[1:41:28] think your wilderness experience, you
[1:41:30] know, don't don't fret about it.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; He trained him in the wilderness, not in
[1:41:36] the schools, not in the theology. John's
[1:41:39] coming was predicted in the scripture,
[1:41:41] Malachi 3. He would send his messenger
[1:41:44] before him. The prophet, the last
[1:41:46] prophet spoke of him. The last the last
[1:41:50] thing spoke of him. Remember the last
[1:41:52] book of the Old Test of the Old
[1:41:55] Testament spoke of the Elijah that would
[1:41:57] come to the children of Israel before
[1:41:59] the showing of the Messiah. But the last
[1:42:01] book of the Bible,
[1:42:04] Revelation shows us that there will be a
[1:42:07] return of him
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; in the last days to the gentile church.
[1:42:12] The signs in Malachi 4. You're the
[1:42:15] children of Malachi 4.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; You're the children. Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I I'll just read
[1:42:23] this scripture if you will turn with me.
[1:42:26] It's uh
[1:42:29] uh
[1:42:31] Romans,
[1:42:47] Romans, the ninth chapter.
[1:42:51] Paul starts out by saying, "I say of the
[1:42:54] truth, in Christ I lie not. My
[1:42:56] conscience also bearing me witness in
[1:42:59] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[1:43:00] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[1:43:04] heart. For I could wish that myself were
[1:43:07] a cursed from Christ for my brethren, my
[1:43:09] brethren, my kinsmen according to the
[1:43:12] flesh." And then he goes on to say, "Who
[1:43:14] are Israelites?
[1:43:17] to whom pertainth the adoption and the
[1:43:20] glory and the covenants and the giving
[1:43:23] of the law and the service of God and
[1:43:26] the promises uh whose are who whose are
[1:43:30] the fathers of of whom as concerning the
[1:43:32] flesh Christ came who is over all God
[1:43:38] blessed forever blessed forever so he's
[1:43:42] saying that who pertainth
[1:43:45] who are Israelites to whom pertainth.
[1:43:49] Listen to me friends.
[1:43:52] This is a
[1:43:59] kind of breaking news
[1:44:04] of all the peoples of all the religious
[1:44:06] people that's in this entire area and
[1:44:08] all the multitudes of churches and the
[1:44:11] tens of thousands of people that name
[1:44:13] the name of Jesus Christ today,
[1:44:18] they wouldn't be able to tell who sent
[1:44:20] them.
[1:44:23] Who shall I say sent me?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Because the God that revealed himself in
[1:44:29] this day has not made himself known to
[1:44:30] them.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Moses could not say it before he was at
[1:44:34] the bush. But once he was at the bush,
[1:44:36] now something supernatural was before
[1:44:38] him. And he was amazed at the that the
[1:44:41] bush wasn't burning. And then he heard a
[1:44:43] voice. I'm the God.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Now you know who he is. You couldn't you
[1:44:50] couldn't you you tried this religion you
[1:44:52] tried that you tried this you tried in
[1:44:54] your own strength to live a Christian
[1:44:56] life you tried all of these things but
[1:44:58] it wouldn't work you didn't know him but
[1:45:01] finally you met him
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; you meet this God face to face and if
[1:45:06] you're here and I'm sure there's some
[1:45:08] that are here you're perhaps too young
[1:45:10] or you haven't met or you're too old or
[1:45:12] whatever more but you haven't had that
[1:45:14] meeting with them don't you stop
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; till you have that meeting with him.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; And when you meet God face to face,
[1:45:21] you'll know who has sent you.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Who shall I say sent me? The God of the
[1:45:30] prophets that sent me. The God who
[1:45:32] revealed himself in this day. To whom
[1:45:34] pertainth as he as Apostle Paul was
[1:45:38] saying to them it pertained the
[1:45:40] covenants and and the glory and all of
[1:45:43] these things pertained. But you know
[1:45:45] what happened?
[1:45:47] They turned it into a tradition.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; The tradition has no power.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; The tradition is just dead works.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; The tradition makes someone feel
[1:46:02] righteous.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; But it's not righteousness.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And so they took a reality and I'm going
[1:46:08] to come to it. They took a reality. It
[1:46:11] this belongs to them. The adoption
[1:46:13] belongs to them.
[1:46:15] This reality belongs to them.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; The covenants, the word of God belongs
[1:46:19] to them. And the coming of Christ
[1:46:21] according to the flesh belongs to them.
[1:46:24] It's theirs.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; But they finally just got satisfied
[1:46:28] with, "Oh, you know what? It's Passover.
[1:46:31] Go get a lamb. We got to kill a lamb.
[1:46:33] Kill a lamb. Fix it up. The wife fixes
[1:46:36] it up. I fixed it up last year. I fixed
[1:46:38] it up the year before. My my mother
[1:46:40] fixed it up this way. My grandma fixed
[1:46:42] it up this way. And we all sit around.
[1:46:44] The kids all sit around and this is the
[1:46:46] Passover. Let the death angel pass, you
[1:46:50] know, and and
[1:46:54] dead.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; No power.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus came, I was
[1:47:01] interested. The the word tradition
[1:47:04] doesn't appear in the Bible until the
[1:47:07] New Testament.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; It finally developed into tradition.
[1:47:12] And the first ones to use it was the
[1:47:14] scribes and Pharisees.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And they said to Jesus, "Why do your
[1:47:19] disciples eat with unwashing hands?"
[1:47:22] Now, wasn't that terrific?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They could take a word
[1:47:31] that came from Moses and the law of God
[1:47:34] and reduce it down to washing hands
[1:47:38] before you eat
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; and with unwashing pots and pans. That's
[1:47:44] what their religion had been reduced to.
[1:47:47] And I can tell you that as far as
[1:47:49] Christianity is concerned, it's a it's a
[1:47:53] mockery
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; of true Christianity.
[1:47:57] And that's why people can go to church
[1:47:59] and have all of their hilarity and all
[1:48:02] their talk in the house of God and and
[1:48:04] travel and joke and all this kind of
[1:48:07] nonsense. It's just a mockery.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; As I'll put it in the prophet's words,
[1:48:11] it's a stink
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; in God's nostrils.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; But the bride of Jesus Christ has his
[1:48:18] secret.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And that secret is his revealed word is
[1:48:23] in her. And to her, to you, I'm telling
[1:48:27] you, and I'm putting you on notice, to
[1:48:29] you pertains the revelation of Jesus
[1:48:31] Christ as prophesied by Jesus Christ in
[1:48:35] Luke 17 and 30. To you, this pertains
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; you have this.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; To you pertains Malachi 4 and 6.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; To you pertains the manifestation of the
[1:48:49] sons of God.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; To you pertains the resurrection.
[1:48:53] To you pertains the rapture.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; To you children, to you brothers, to you
[1:48:59] sisters, sons and daughters of God. To
[1:49:02] you pertains this.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Don't reduce it to a tradition.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; It's not a tradition.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm in the message. Hello. Come on.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; There is no such phrase.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; This one is a such phrase to me. Christ
[1:49:32] is in me.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; This is a scripture phrase. I'm the
[1:49:36] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; I'm the wife of the lamb.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; And I know what he wants done and I have
[1:49:43] his seat in me like Mary had in her.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; That's truth.
[1:49:53] Brother Brandham has about three or four
[1:49:55] words and they're kind of
[1:50:00] equal with one another.
[1:50:04] One is tradition,
[1:50:07] one is systems.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. They made a system out of it
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; and that turned into a denomination
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; and God hated it
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; because it was only an image
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; of the real.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the reality.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; So he has about three or four words that
[1:50:27] are all equal to tradition.
[1:50:31] I'm going to say a mouthful.
[1:50:35] We as believers of this message and I
[1:50:38] say believers of the message whoever
[1:50:40] might hear me on the internet as I have
[1:50:44] traveled and I've been in many churches
[1:50:46] with a lot of people and pastors and so
[1:50:48] on. One of the greatest dangers
[1:50:52] that believers face today
[1:50:55] is to make certain that the message
[1:50:58] doesn't become a tradition. Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; The tradition only appears. It has the
[1:51:07] appearance
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; of righteousness, but it's not
[1:51:10] righteous.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It has the appearance of keeping the
[1:51:15] word of God, but it's not the word of
[1:51:17] God.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And so, I want to tell you what
[1:51:20] tradition is. What is a tradition?
[1:51:24] Traditions are systems,
[1:51:28] denominations,
[1:51:29] Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; A person who is keeping a tradition is
[1:51:33] an impersonator.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Of the truth that did come at one time.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; We don't want to live on brother
[1:51:41] Brandham's reputation.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; We want the God of William Brham.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; And we must have the God of William
[1:51:48] Brham here doing things amongst the
[1:51:51] bride and through the bride.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we're not asking for too
[1:51:56] much. This is the word of God.
[1:51:59] It's either that or I cease preaching.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. This is the
[1:52:04] seed of eternal life.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; We believe in the supernatural.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Here's what a tradition is.
[1:52:19] Traditions or systems or denominations,
[1:52:22] impersonators
[1:52:24] are all the same category.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you have read in the message.
[1:52:30] Can I have just a little more time? Not
[1:52:33] much longer. But you have read in the
[1:52:36] message
[1:52:39] and I'm going to use some names now
[1:52:41] because brother Brandham uses them.
[1:52:44] But he would say he would speak of Oral
[1:52:46] Roberts and that bulldog faith and
[1:52:50] brother Jack Cole and those men. I lived
[1:52:52] in that era and there were great things
[1:52:54] that were taking place.
[1:52:56] great things were taking place and uh
[1:53:01] brother Brandham because of the of the
[1:53:04] sign in his hand had to have prayer
[1:53:06] lines
[1:53:08] then everybody everybody I'm not just
[1:53:10] saying the brothers that I just
[1:53:12] mentioned a couple names but everybody
[1:53:14] had to have prayer lines
[1:53:17] and brother Brandham calls it
[1:53:18] impersonating
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; the brothers were good brothers
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; he called them brothers and he believed
[1:53:27] it and he wouldn't say that facitiously.
[1:53:29] He said it sincerely. These are
[1:53:32] brothers. He spoke so kindly. He said,
[1:53:35] "My ministries to have the brothers
[1:53:37] unite and so on and so forth." But they
[1:53:39] began to impersonate an original
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; ministry.
[1:53:44] And where is it today?
[1:53:47] Do you see big prayer lines? Do you see
[1:53:49] big meetings? No. It all faded away
[1:53:52] because the original passed off the
[1:53:54] scene and all impersonators because they
[1:53:57] were impersonating it. And where did it
[1:53:59] all go? Did they receive the message?
[1:54:01] Did they receive the secret? Did they
[1:54:02] receive the opening of the seal?
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; No, they didn't because they were caught
[1:54:06] up with, you know, doing what someone
[1:54:10] else was doing because that was big big
[1:54:12] success.
[1:54:18] And so it will want to kind of follow
[1:54:19] that pattern.
[1:54:24] They don't know. I don't even know if I
[1:54:26] should say this, but
[1:54:31] over 40 years, we've had quite a number
[1:54:33] of people, quite a number of people want
[1:54:36] to come and kind of get next to what was
[1:54:39] what's going on. I see people, you know,
[1:54:41] I where where did these young ladies
[1:54:44] come from? What are these nice such they
[1:54:47] don't even know what they're attracted
[1:54:48] to? Oh, beautiful long hair and they're
[1:54:51] just ladies. They're so feminine and
[1:54:53] these young men. I had my own uncle. My
[1:54:56] own uncle says, "Where do you find young
[1:54:59] men like this?
[1:55:01] They only see the result, but they don't
[1:55:04] see what produced it.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; They're not hungering after the life
[1:55:07] that produced it. They want they want
[1:55:09] the you know they want what would come
[1:55:11] out of it. They want the success or they
[1:55:13] want whatever they perceive it to be.
[1:55:15] Are you with me?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? And that
[1:55:18] will just be reduced to nothing. That'll
[1:55:20] only be a only be a tradition. It'll
[1:55:22] only be a mimic. It'll only be a copy
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; trying to copy. So how do you run
[1:55:26] things? Well, the first thing you run
[1:55:29] things on your knees.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; The first things you run your things
[1:55:33] having met the pillar of fire.
[1:55:37] Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; First thing, a bride has met him
[1:55:40] someplace somewhere along the line and
[1:55:42] trust you had more than one meeting and
[1:55:45] you heard the voice of God and you know
[1:55:47] it's God and no one can ever change you
[1:55:50] from it.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; She can't be convinced of anything else
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; but it become a tradition.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And so this is what a tradition is.
[1:56:01] A tradition is the transmission of
[1:56:03] knowledge,
[1:56:06] opinions.
[1:56:09] I've had people come and say to me about
[1:56:11] things in the, you know,
[1:56:14] they have developed as a result of Are
[1:56:18] you listening to me? You want to
[1:56:20] remember this? I'm I'm speaking some
[1:56:22] things are very very deep on my heart
[1:56:24] now. And young people, it'll mean
[1:56:27] something to you someday if it doesn't a
[1:56:28] whole lot this morning.
[1:56:31] But on down the road, people, you know,
[1:56:34] they set forth their opinion
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; or their idea and I don't think you
[1:56:39] should do this and then you start
[1:56:41] feeling guilty. Well, you know, should I
[1:56:44] shouldn't I? Well, where do you get it?
[1:56:46] Well, I I think you know somewhere the
[1:56:48] prophet said something about it and when
[1:56:51] you go to it, it's not there.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; It's not there. And some of these
[1:56:56] doctrines that have fled uh you know
[1:56:58] just spread around without within the
[1:57:00] message when you get the when you get
[1:57:02] the essence of the doctrine and you take
[1:57:04] it down it was designed by a man and
[1:57:06] when you get it down and say that did
[1:57:08] brother Brandham actually say that no he
[1:57:11] didn't say that it was developed
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; from what he said
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; and we must not compare ourselves with
[1:57:24] others. Amen.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, they do it and they get away
[1:57:27] with it." That's how you're getting into
[1:57:29] trouble.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Not because they do it, they get away
[1:57:33] with it. Well, this church does it. They
[1:57:36] allow it.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Is that our standard?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Is this church thus sayith the Lord to
[1:57:42] us? No. The message is thus sayith the
[1:57:44] Lord to the word of God is thus sayeth
[1:57:46] the Lord. Amen. Come on.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; I don't often say, you know, that you
[1:57:53] ought to agree with that, but I say
[1:57:55] today, you should agree with that.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; And so, it's a transmission of knowledge
[1:58:00] or opinions and doctrines, customs,
[1:58:04] practices.
[1:58:06] You're from the colonies.
[1:58:08] I even heard you tell me that the small
[1:58:11] dots meant something and the big dots
[1:58:13] meant something. If you had small dots
[1:58:15] on your dress, that you were unmarried.
[1:58:17] If you had big dots, you were married or
[1:58:19] whatever more. The ladies from India,
[1:58:23] uh, and if you're Indian hair, it's
[1:58:25] perfectly fine. I saw hundreds of
[1:58:27] thousands of them. They got a red dot
[1:58:29] here. And then the men sometime a man
[1:58:31] would have, you know, ashes down his
[1:58:34] down his forehead. I didn't know what it
[1:58:37] meant. I went in one place supposed to
[1:58:39] be so holy, holy, holy, and they just,
[1:58:41] you know, they just on everybody that
[1:58:43] went by. I went by whatever it was
[1:58:47] didn't make any difference to me. I got
[1:58:50] some ashes on my head. I have to take it
[1:58:52] out.
[1:59:00] You have to have a bonnet.
[1:59:04] No, you have to have your head covered
[1:59:08] some way just so it you know it
[1:59:10] satisfies and then people feel okay.
[1:59:14] It's a dead worthless tradition.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And the ladies used to always wear hats.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Wear all the hats you want. I'll come
[1:59:24] back next Sunday with hats. It's fine
[1:59:25] with me. But don't put any don't put any
[1:59:28] spirituality to it or I'll I'll knock
[1:59:30] the hat off.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; I've had them come to Bible way and you
[1:59:37] couldn't get rid of that hat for nothing
[1:59:39] because they came out of Catholicism and
[1:59:41] we wear hats.
[1:59:46] My wife, you won't forget this message
[1:59:48] anyway, so I might as well go full
[1:59:50] distance.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; My wife, we were over in Yugoslavia,
[1:59:56] was it there? Yeah. And we were in the
[2:00:00] church and they were receiving the
[2:00:01] message and so we were anxious to be
[2:00:04] there and and then they heard that, you
[2:00:06] know, we go in there. My wife's the only
[2:00:08] one that hasn't got a kerchief on. They
[2:00:10] all got a kirchief.
[2:00:13] That's important.
[2:00:16] You need to have a kirchief. And then
[2:00:18] when you have a kirchief, you're
[2:00:20] accepted because the scripture says your
[2:00:21] head is covered. And I guess they had
[2:00:24] that. Now, that was an opinion that that
[2:00:26] kirchief was the scripture.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; But if they read the rest of it down, it
[2:00:31] says, "Your long hair is given to you
[2:00:32] for a covering."
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; And then we had to have a secret come.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet come says,
[2:00:38] "Here's the secret."
[2:00:40] Your hair is your glory. Your hair is
[2:00:42] your covering.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; And we said,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; "Yeah."
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Of course.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; So then they found out my wife sang. So
[2:00:53] they said, "Sister Bisco, would you sing
[2:00:55] this evening?" You know, and uh as she
[2:00:58] came in the door, they presented her
[2:01:00] with a kchief.
[2:01:03] So
[2:01:05] she wouldn't put it on.
[2:01:08] in the morning when she didn't have to
[2:01:10] sing. Did you put a curtchief on in the
[2:01:12] morning or something? I think they gave
[2:01:14] her something. You know, as long as even
[2:01:16] you had a little square piece of cloth
[2:01:18] on top of your head, you're okay.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; But if you haven't got that cloth on top
[2:01:23] of your head, you talk about strong
[2:01:27] whole churches, whole organizations,
[2:01:30] whole movements within a country operate
[2:01:33] on traditions.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Don't look too I might
[2:01:37] start naming some right here.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm okay because I have a long
[2:01:43] dress. No, you're not okay cuz you have
[2:01:45] a long dress. Long. There's no
[2:01:47] righteousness with a long dress. Unless
[2:01:49] you have the life inside that's
[2:01:51] convicting you to do that.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; A lot of people have long hair cuz they
[2:01:56] like long hair.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe not a lot, but some do. You have
[2:02:00] to know why you have it. Amen.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; And there has to be something inside
[2:02:05] that says, I heard a voice from God.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; I met God and that's why I do it.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; And then they can say, well, who sent
[2:02:13] you? Who is this?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; You can tell them who it is.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; So, you know, Sister Biscll didn't put
[2:02:21] the Kirchief on. Guess what? They didn't
[2:02:25] ask her to sing.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to have that on if you're
[2:02:30] going to stand and sing.
[2:02:33] then you're okay
[2:02:35] with God.
[2:02:37] Didn't mean a thing to God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; To God, those traditions just stink
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; because they have taken his
[2:02:45] righteousness and associated it with
[2:02:47] that bonnet or with that curtchief or
[2:02:49] with a long dress or with something
[2:02:51] else. But when his life is in and the
[2:02:54] word is in the bride and she does things
[2:02:56] because it's a reality.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Who is this God? Just stay around. I'll
[2:03:02] tell you his name. I'll tell you who he
[2:03:04] is. I'll tell you about his life. And
[2:03:06] I'll tell you who I am.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; And these traditions, these traditions,
[2:03:18] the transmission of knowledge, opinions,
[2:03:21] doctrines, and customs and practices,
[2:03:23] they're handed down. A tradition is when
[2:03:25] it's handed down from one generation to
[2:03:28] another. And we've got we've got those
[2:03:32] here who you know said, "Well, I was in
[2:03:35] brother Brandham's meetings."
[2:03:38] How many were in brother Brandon's
[2:03:39] meetings?
[2:03:42] One, two.
[2:03:45] I know there's a few more. There's some
[2:03:46] that perhaps don't remember.
[2:03:54] So then we tell you
[2:03:58] and then someone tells you says, "I
[2:04:00] heard it. I heard it from a witness.
[2:04:05] I heard a preacher and he preached such
[2:04:08] a mighty message and I was absolutely
[2:04:11] convinced in my heart and my soul."
[2:04:13] Well, that's good. But you have to have
[2:04:17] a meeting with God. Your own meeting
[2:04:19] with God. Say, "I met him."
[2:04:21] It doesn't have to be something
[2:04:23] flamboyant or something dramatic or
[2:04:26] something out of this world, but it is a
[2:04:28] it is a something that's divine. It's
[2:04:30] something that's deep
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; and it's something that's personal.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; You have it and you become unmovable.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; So, it's handed originally by word of
[2:04:40] mouth and by example. Listen, I'm not
[2:04:43] done. Well, soon done.
[2:04:47] A tradition is the body or the whole
[2:04:50] body of Christian doctrine handed down
[2:04:54] through successive generations which is
[2:04:57] held by the church to belong to the
[2:05:00] deposit of faith of the word of God as
[2:05:04] the deposit of faith even if it may not
[2:05:07] be found in the scripture.
[2:05:10] A tradition becomes so strong.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; A tradition that can become so strong
[2:05:15] that it cannot even find it in the
[2:05:17] Bible, but yet people surrender
[2:05:20] themselves to it and succumb to it and
[2:05:22] become bound by it because this is what
[2:05:24] we do in the message. No, that's not it,
[2:05:27] friends. That's not it. We do what we do
[2:05:30] because there's something inside. It's a
[2:05:32] conviction within. Oh God,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I want to please you. Amen.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; I want to live a life that's honorable
[2:05:39] to you.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; All of you, make that your commitment.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Even if you may not understand
[2:05:50] everything,
[2:05:51] doctrines that are accepted as teachings
[2:05:54] of Jesus and the apostles without any
[2:05:57] evidence.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; There's no evidence that it ever was
[2:06:02] spoken by the apostles.
[2:06:06] I was in Jerusalem and looking, we were
[2:06:08] going down to one of the sites
[2:06:12] and there was a monk there from one of
[2:06:15] the Orthodox churches
[2:06:18] and we're going down the walls and there
[2:06:20] was some scratching on the walls, just
[2:06:23] different scratch marks
[2:06:26] and he had all the
[2:06:29] holy movements
[2:06:30] of a priest. Well, I'm not m I'm not
[2:06:33] mocking. I'm just saying I'm trying to
[2:06:35] describe how it was. And he's showing
[2:06:37] them all these these were supposed to be
[2:06:41] writings
[2:06:42] of people from ancient times. And the
[2:06:46] people all Oh.
[2:06:48] Oh. And they're looking at it. I tell
[2:06:51] you, tradition can take a person to very
[2:06:53] dark places
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; and they attach sacred things to it.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't read. I'm I'm not I'm
[2:07:03] not fooling now. I'm not just seeking to
[2:07:05] be humorous, but I have seen I have seen
[2:07:09] publicized and and it wouldn't be so
[2:07:11] serious it wouldn't even be worth that
[2:07:13] mentioning today in the service unless
[2:07:16] there were millions of people millions
[2:07:19] of people that were taken in and sucked
[2:07:21] in. How are they sucked in? How are they
[2:07:23] drawn in to believe this and and to
[2:07:25] become uh so devoted to it?
[2:07:29] is because they started someplace and it
[2:07:32] may have been just with the way they
[2:07:34] dressed or the way they appeared and
[2:07:37] they start with that and then they go on
[2:07:39] and on and on and listen to me friends
[2:07:42] that is why I want everybody to listen
[2:07:45] to me that is why we I the other
[2:07:49] ministers here and I know myself I have
[2:07:52] urged you with an urgency you hear it in
[2:07:55] the message
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; don't wait to hear it over the pull pit
[2:07:58] that
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; don't wait to get it from a man. You
[2:08:01] hear it in the message. You hear it. Not
[2:08:04] only that, it will strengthen you. It
[2:08:06] will guide you. This word has been sent
[2:08:09] to you.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; That is the prophet's message to you as
[2:08:12] an individual. You will enter into a
[2:08:15] relationship cuz that's Christ.
[2:08:22] I was talking to a young Catholic woman
[2:08:24] one time
[2:08:26] and she just said, "You know, if I don't
[2:08:30] get to confessional,
[2:08:33] if I don't get to the confessional, she
[2:08:36] just has such a guilt.
[2:08:38] She has such a guilt.
[2:08:41] Can you imagine? She just lives under
[2:08:43] such a guilt. A poor life, poor soul.
[2:08:45] But if you can get to confessional
[2:08:48] and another one says, you know, as long
[2:08:50] as long as I can get to mass, get to
[2:08:53] mass. I didn't talk about this because I
[2:08:55] was I was ra I was born into a Catholic
[2:08:57] family, but I didn't understand it, you
[2:08:59] know. And my parents weren't living
[2:09:01] around a Catholic church. So I guess and
[2:09:03] so I went to visit my relatives and they
[2:09:05] and I'm walking in a boy about about
[2:09:08] Jack's age, I guess.
[2:09:10] Come Jack here with me.
[2:09:13] So, we're walking into church and now
[2:09:15] here's a bunch of idols
[2:09:18] and they go bend over and they kiss it,
[2:09:20] you know, and they kiss it and then they
[2:09:23] put their hand behind me and tried to
[2:09:25] get my head down there to kiss it. I
[2:09:28] tell you what, I did just what you did,
[2:09:29] Jack. I put some resistance in there.
[2:09:34] But as long as you kissed it, you are
[2:09:36] okay.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[2:09:41] As long as we get to mass, we're okay.
[2:09:43] As long as we get to confessional, we're
[2:09:45] okay. As long as we look right and we
[2:09:47] come into the we look like a believer
[2:09:49] and we act like a believer and we sing
[2:09:51] believer songs, we're okay. That's not
[2:09:53] what's okay. What's okay is when you met
[2:09:56] God,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; and you can't be persuaded differently.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't gotten it, stay here.
[2:10:05] Stay with it till you do have it. Amen.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; You have a meeting with God.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; And without that, let me tell you,
[2:10:16] especially young men, young ladies,
[2:10:18] young people, without that, you'll never
[2:10:21] survive this age.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; It will suck you in. It will draw you
[2:10:26] in. It will attract you. It's too
[2:10:28] attractive.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said it's too beautiful.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said he's a slicker.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said he knows the Bible
[2:10:36] better than we do. That's right.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; But he hasn't got an ounce of
[2:10:39] revelation.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish right now. I've got
[2:10:50] more I want to say.
[2:11:00] Now I want to tell you I want to read a
[2:11:02] little story to you. This is a very
[2:11:04] different service for me, but I want to
[2:11:06] read a little different story to you.
[2:11:08] And sometimes we may think that brother
[2:11:10] Brandham went into very very juvenile
[2:11:14] stories,
[2:11:15] but he's bearing out a very powerful
[2:11:18] principle.
[2:11:20] And we're right on to traditions now.
[2:11:24] And this is in the message, the world is
[2:11:26] falling apart.
[2:11:30] He said, "Look, a little while ago, he's
[2:11:33] he's relating something that happened
[2:11:34] just a a little." He said, "Calls it as
[2:11:37] the little form form." Not long ago when
[2:11:41] little David and I remember in my young
[2:11:44] years, little David was a young fellow,
[2:11:47] a child preacher,
[2:11:50] and oh, people were he'd get up there
[2:11:52] probably, you know, 12 years old. I
[2:11:53] think he was 12 or 13 years old and
[2:11:56] preached like a house on fire and people
[2:11:59] came by the thousands
[2:12:01] and that's what brother Brandham's
[2:12:02] referring to. He says is formed when
[2:12:04] when little David and he called it
[2:12:06] system came out.
[2:12:10] What did I say? System was equal to a
[2:12:13] tradition equal to a denomination. And
[2:12:16] now he's describing and he says the
[2:12:18] little David system came out and every
[2:12:20] church had to have a little David boy
[2:12:23] preacher.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; What was it? Comparing comparisons
[2:12:29] trying to impersonate
[2:12:33] And there were many others
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; and they all this was kind of an
[2:12:36] original thing God was doing. I I don't
[2:12:38] understand it but this was now everybody
[2:12:41] had to compare and personate. He said
[2:12:43] that's what got us into the mess that
[2:12:47] we're now in.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; He says what you made Assemblies of God.
[2:12:53] Now he goes right from that right to the
[2:12:55] greatest movement that was happening
[2:12:58] which was the Pentecostal Assemblies of
[2:12:59] God. He said, "Assemblies of God," he
[2:13:02] said, "go back into an organization." He
[2:13:05] said, "What made you," he asked the
[2:13:07] question, "What made you Assemblies of
[2:13:09] God? Go back into an organization when
[2:13:12] that's the very system that God brought
[2:13:15] you out of. You tried to compare with
[2:13:17] the Methodists or with the Baptists.
[2:13:20] What made you oneness with your new
[2:13:22] issue? What made you go into an
[2:13:24] organization? The same thing that he
[2:13:26] brought you out of, it's the same thing.
[2:13:28] You just keep doing it over and over and
[2:13:31] over again, over and over and over.
[2:13:33] Handing it down, handing it down,
[2:13:35] comparing it with this church, comparing
[2:13:36] it with that church, comparing it with
[2:13:38] this young people's convention,
[2:13:39] comparing it with, oh, oh, I was down
[2:13:41] another convent. I don't care about
[2:13:42] another convention.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; I care about what he said.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you go to Europe or
[2:13:52] Brothers John's going to be preaching to
[2:13:54] to to Australia and young people's
[2:13:57] convention down there. That's
[2:13:58] irrelevant. I preach at conventions all
[2:14:00] over the place. It's that how people do
[2:14:02] it. One one person does it a little
[2:14:05] different than the other person. That's
[2:14:06] fine. But we're not going to make a
[2:14:08] tradition out of it.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I hope this means something to you.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; He says God don't call you by your
[2:14:15] organizational brand. He calls you by
[2:14:18] your birth.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Certainly, that's what God calls you by.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; He says God knows our needs. We've got
[2:14:27] to accept it the way he has it, not
[2:14:30] according to our traditions. We just
[2:14:32] can't receive it that way because God
[2:14:34] won't receive it. God won't have nothing
[2:14:37] to do with it. You see, uh, somebody,
[2:14:40] Brother Brandham, I see some person that
[2:14:42] can do this and some that. Glory to God.
[2:14:46] Lord, he says, if he did, he'll do it.
[2:14:50] If he calls you that, you won't have to
[2:14:53] tell anybody about it. it'll show
[2:14:55] itself.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we have it. You won't
[2:14:58] have to tell anybody about it." He says,
[2:15:00] "Now, we find out in our denominational
[2:15:03] politics and we've accepted politics and
[2:15:07] let religious politics
[2:15:11] lead our ministers instead of the Holy
[2:15:14] Spirit leading our ministers.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; A man see a truth that he believes, he
[2:15:20] can't go to it, his church will put him
[2:15:22] out."
[2:15:24] Amen.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; This exists. This exists right in the
[2:15:30] message.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have to We don't have to be
[2:15:32] warned about what is going to be. We're
[2:15:35] dealing with it already.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I can't fix it.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; God has to fix it.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You can go to any place you want. I said
[2:15:44] to brother Vin once, I said, "How many
[2:15:46] different groups are there in Trinidad?
[2:15:48] How many how many different churches are
[2:15:49] there?" He said, "42."
[2:15:51] I said, "How many different angles to
[2:15:53] the message?" He said, "42."
[2:15:59] So, and even a minister gets into it. He
[2:16:02] get So, he can't I can't go there. I
[2:16:04] can't go over there. I can't Somebody
[2:16:07] might hear that you were over there or
[2:16:09] that you fellowship there. And then
[2:16:12] right away they got some kind of concept
[2:16:15] in their mind. Listen
[2:16:20] friends, this is what the prophet, you
[2:16:22] know, sometimes it stings. It stings me
[2:16:24] before it stings you.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; These are realities.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; These are things these are things that
[2:16:30] ought not to be.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; And the reason I'm saying it is not
[2:16:35] because, you know, we're going to go out
[2:16:37] and fix it. We can't fix it. I'm But I'm
[2:16:40] saying that so that we don't get caught
[2:16:42] up in it.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; We say,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; "Amen. That might be
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know. And you know, you say,
[2:16:48] "Well, where do you finally end up,
[2:16:50] Brother Bisc?" This is where I end up.
[2:16:52] The Lord knoweth them that are his,
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; and he will not lose one of them.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; What about this? What about that? What
[2:17:04] about this person? What about that
[2:17:06] church? That's not my business. My
[2:17:08] business is to know that I have met him
[2:17:11] face to face, that I hear his voice,
[2:17:15] that my life is surrendered to him.
[2:17:17] That's my business. That's all of our
[2:17:20] business. And what God does with someone
[2:17:22] else, we're not comparing with anybody.
[2:17:24] We can't compare with them because we're
[2:17:26] not going down that road.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] I saw the ecumenical movement move. You
[2:17:41] talk about spirit man, spirit,
[2:17:43] anointing, tongues, prophecies,
[2:17:45] interpretations, anointed preachers, all
[2:17:48] the rest of it. And and then I saw
[2:17:50] Pentecostal women, I'm talking about
[2:17:52] Pentecostal women who who I saw wipe
[2:17:56] their wipe the lipstick and wipe the,
[2:18:00] you know, the rouge and all the makeup
[2:18:02] off their face with their tears.
[2:18:06] I saw that
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; not once, many times in repentance to
[2:18:12] God, having a birth, at least as far as
[2:18:15] I know, they're having a repentance and
[2:18:17] they're wiping it off their tears. And
[2:18:18] then on down by the time, you know, it
[2:18:21] got handed down,
[2:18:23] maybe their daughters and maybe
[2:18:25] themselves, the same women come in and
[2:18:27] they got the makeup on, they said,
[2:18:29] because how is that? Well, here's all
[2:18:32] the others coming in. are coming in from
[2:18:33] all of these other churches and and God
[2:18:35] accepts them.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; And not only that, God accepted them
[2:18:43] when they were in their trousers and
[2:18:44] pants.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; And so, praise God, we can do it, too.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying.
[2:18:50] That's what got them into the mess.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Now, you thought I was going to be in
[2:18:58] Exodus 3. I'm actually in 2012.
[2:19:02] Come on.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; I want to leave this with you.
[2:19:18] He ends up, this is all out of the world
[2:19:21] falling apart. And here's where he ends
[2:19:23] up. Now, he talks about little David and
[2:19:25] the preacher and everybody had to have
[2:19:27] them. A little story. And he continues
[2:19:30] on down. and we've accepted politics and
[2:19:33] religious politics. And then he goes
[2:19:35] into, you know, the Methodist and the
[2:19:37] Baptist and all of this and he says, "As
[2:19:40] long as it's a system,
[2:19:42] as long as it's a system,
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; as long as it's a tradition," he said,
[2:19:48] "As long as it's a system, it's a system
[2:19:50] and the whole system's rotten." And get
[2:19:53] away from the thing.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; So he said, "What do we do in the
[2:19:58] message? Get away from get away from
[2:19:59] comparing
[2:20:01] Well, they do it. Those young people do
[2:20:03] it. We're not. They're not our example.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; That church does it. Those women do it.
[2:20:09] That has nothing to do with it. Get away
[2:20:11] from it.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Get away from that very concept.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Well, God accepts them. How do you know
[2:20:18] God accepts them? God accepts his own
[2:20:21] children and God will convict his
[2:20:23] children. God will guide them.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; And he says, and then then he comes down
[2:20:34] to this. And God sent them prophets down
[2:20:36] through the age. Every time their world
[2:20:40] system would fall apart, their world
[2:20:43] system, all the all the comparisons and
[2:20:46] all the denominations and all the
[2:20:48] organizations, their system fell apart.
[2:20:52] And God would send them a prophet and
[2:20:54] and and their religious system. And God
[2:20:56] send them a prophet. And you put them to
[2:20:58] death. He's talking going back now to
[2:21:00] what Jesus said. Just stay with me
[2:21:01] another two three minutes. And the and
[2:21:03] and God sent the prophet and you put him
[2:21:06] to death and in the tomb. And then about
[2:21:09] a generation
[2:21:11] you wake up.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; And realize
[2:21:16] that that was a prophet.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; And then what do you do? You garnish the
[2:21:22] tomb.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Well, do you know what? this message
[2:21:25] wasn't so bad after all because, you
[2:21:28] know, we we thought you were just a
[2:21:30] bunch of, you know, a bunch of uh bookw
[2:21:32] worms or tapew worms and we said bad
[2:21:35] things about you, but you know, we're
[2:21:37] all kind of, you know, we're kind of
[2:21:40] sorry and we're all kind of one now and
[2:21:46] we said all kinds of nasty things about
[2:21:48] you.
[2:21:50] I've had people in this message call me
[2:21:51] serpent sade.
[2:21:54] That's fine.
[2:21:56] Maybe we'll sit across the marriage
[2:21:57] table. I don't know from each other. But
[2:21:59] if we do, there'll be there won't be no
[2:22:01] serpent seed there.
[2:22:04] And I don't know about you, but you
[2:22:06] know, friends,
[2:22:08] I'm to tell you as humbly as I possibly
[2:22:10] can.
[2:22:14] And you heard me in my testimony tell
[2:22:16] it. I did meet the pillar of fire.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; And I met him with the prophet in the
[2:22:21] automobile.
[2:22:23] And now just while I studied this
[2:22:26] message is all came as a reality. You
[2:22:28] say it wasn't a reality before. It was a
[2:22:31] very real experience. And people would
[2:22:32] say what was it like and so on so forth.
[2:22:34] I'll tell you
[2:22:37] I understand now
[2:22:40] why Paul fell to the ground.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; I hung my head quickly
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; and I thought my next breath was going
[2:22:47] to cause me to pass out of this world. I
[2:22:50] felt I was at the very edge of death.
[2:22:52] Whatever whatever this life was, I was
[2:22:54] leaving it.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; You may not have that experience, but
[2:22:58] you'll have an experience. You say, "I
[2:22:59] met him.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; My life was transformed.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; I met him.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's all you need to know."
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say
[2:23:10] that they garnished the tomb. And what
[2:23:13] do you do? He says, "Make a tradition of
[2:23:15] his life,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; of the prophet's life." Yeah.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Israel had done.
[2:23:22] Had taken
[2:23:25] the prophet Moses and had made a
[2:23:28] tradition of his life. And he goes on to
[2:23:31] say, "And that's that's the way they we
[2:23:33] do with Martin Luther." And now he goes,
[2:23:35] "That's the way we do with Martin
[2:23:36] Luther, John Wesley. Other men were
[2:23:39] always looking back. See those things."
[2:23:43] And you make a tradition of their life.
[2:23:47] Now I I know where the caribou was shot.
[2:23:51] I know where the grizzly was shot.
[2:23:54] I've never taken anybody back there. I'd
[2:23:55] like to go back, but it wouldn't be
[2:23:58] anything spiritual to me. It would just
[2:24:00] be a nice experience.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; So, I don't care what kind of belt
[2:24:06] buckle you have.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the pictures on your
[2:24:10] wall. They're perfectly fine. Some of
[2:24:12] them are so lovely to me. I have the one
[2:24:15] Marilyn has painted and I have that
[2:24:17] experience. I hope you see where I'm
[2:24:19] coming from. But it is we don't we don't
[2:24:22] look back just on the prophet's life and
[2:24:25] say, "Well, that's the way they did it.
[2:24:28] You know, this is the way they did it in
[2:24:30] another church or
[2:24:36] how many here have been to Israel?"
[2:24:39] Quite a number. Do you know who controls
[2:24:41] the places that they think Jesus was
[2:24:44] born
[2:24:47] and where he died
[2:24:50] and the resurrection, the tomb?
[2:24:53] All churches,
[2:24:55] denomination churches, systems
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; because there's no sacredness back at
[2:25:01] that spot.
[2:25:06] Amen.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; We're happy. You know, we can talk about
[2:25:12] Sunset Mountain.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; We can talk about the desert in Arizona
[2:25:15] where the cloud came. You could go and
[2:25:17] stand at that very spot and it might not
[2:25:20] do a thing for you.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; You can meet that God here this morning.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; You can meet Nick and have that same
[2:25:27] experience. That's absolutely the truth.
[2:25:29] And when they heard the word of God,
[2:25:31] they believed and that's what happened.
[2:25:33] Then the Holy Spirit came to them. So
[2:25:36] we're not talking about historical.
[2:25:37] We're not just looking back. And neither
[2:25:39] are we just looking into the future, but
[2:25:41] we're looking at a reality. And neither
[2:25:43] are we going to make a a a tradition
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; of the message
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; because the minute we make a tradition
[2:25:51] out of it, the spirit of God just
[2:25:53] departs it. Because then all it is is
[2:25:55] it's an activity that we do. I'm
[2:25:58] closing. It's an activity that you do.
[2:26:01] And because you do it, you feel
[2:26:03] righteous.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; You feel okay. You feel okay with God.
[2:26:09] And if it's not okay with God, that's a
[2:26:11] deception.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; And that's why you'll now I hope this
[2:26:18] will explain it to you. That is why
[2:26:20] exactly why precisely why brother
[2:26:23] Brandham spoke against denomination so
[2:26:25] much because the people were locked up
[2:26:27] into a system into a man-made tradition
[2:26:30] and they kept doing it over and over and
[2:26:33] over again and felt righteous
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; and there's no righteousness to it.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Who will I say sent me?
[2:26:50] He knew who sent him.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, I stand
[2:26:54] behind this pulpit. I stand behind this
[2:26:57] pulpit.
[2:27:00] And I wouldn't do so if I I hadn't had a
[2:27:05] could tell you of all truth. It's a
[2:27:07] reality.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And we seek to bring you
[2:27:11] into an atmosphere where you know it's a
[2:27:13] reality. Amen.
[2:27:15] I'd like to have brother Ryan if you'd
[2:27:18] come and help me. I'd like to sing we'll
[2:27:21] walk in the light, the beautiful light.
[2:27:24] Come where the dew drops of mercy are
[2:27:27] bright.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Shine all around us by day and by night.
[2:27:32] Jesus the light of the world.
[2:27:34] Understand?
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Now you see I don't need you to get
[2:27:41] excited here. You go home and get
[2:27:42] excited. You get in your car and get
[2:27:45] excited.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; You read a message. You pick up the
[2:27:49] Bible. And you could read you could read
[2:27:52] if you would also uh 1 Corinthians 10.
[2:27:56] And Paul again will tell
[2:27:59] he just couldn't
[2:28:01] he couldn't explain it. I think he
[2:28:03] couldn't make it any clearer.
[2:28:05] He talked about his, you know, he talked
[2:28:07] about his heritage and and what he'd
[2:28:10] been taught
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; and they were all baptized under Moses
[2:28:14] in the sea
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; and they all drank the water from the
[2:28:18] rock
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; and the rock was Christ
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; but they didn't know the rock was Christ
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; and he was, you know, I'm sure if I was
[2:28:26] Apostle Paul, I would be scratching my
[2:28:28] head and saying, "How did they get from
[2:28:30] there to here?"
[2:28:34] Hallelujah.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Dear friends,
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; you have been entrusted with the most
[2:28:43] supernatural
[2:28:45] message.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to make you feel
[2:28:48] good. I'm saying that so that you'll
[2:28:50] know that there's nothing there's
[2:28:53] nothing that can deceive the bride of
[2:28:55] Jesus Christ. Whoever the bride is,
[2:28:58] nothing can deceive her. If you have a
[2:29:00] revelation, nothing can persuade you
[2:29:03] away from it.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to substantiate it.
[2:29:07] You don't have to try to make and say,
[2:29:09] "Well, that mountain is solid." No, it
[2:29:11] is solid cuz God made it solid. This
[2:29:13] revelation is an absolute revelation. It
[2:29:16] is something that you know that you know
[2:29:18] that you know. I have never questioned
[2:29:21] ever
[2:29:24] in my life
[2:29:27] ever questioned that I'm the son of Fred
[2:29:30] Biscll.
[2:29:33] Why would we question that we're a son
[2:29:37] of God?
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Something doesn't relate. Why would we
[2:29:42] question we're a daughter of God? Right?
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; That has to be
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; listen to me. That has to be a greater
[2:29:51] reality than your natural birth.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Has to be a greater reality to you. I
[2:30:01] know. Do you know who your mother and
[2:30:02] father is? If you know that,
[2:30:06] you've got to know that God's my father.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; My father.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Teach us, Lord. Teach us how to pray.
[2:30:14] Amen.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; First thing, our father
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Not my father that's here on earth. Our
[2:30:25] father
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on
[2:30:34] earth. God bless you friends. I trust
[2:30:36] this was I made something real to you
[2:30:39] this morning. The Holy Spirit makes it
[2:30:41] real to you. We'll sing.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Come where the new drums
[2:30:58] of mercy
[2:31:00] are.
[2:31:02] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[2:31:10] Jesus
[2:31:12] the light of the world. First verse
[2:31:18] all
[2:31:22] the way.
[2:31:25] Jesus the light of the world.
[2:31:31] The light and mercy
[2:31:34] in his face.
[2:31:38] Jesus the light of the world. Much love.
[2:31:43] Now we'll walk in the light.
[2:31:50] Oh God
[2:31:54] of mercy.
[2:31:57] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[2:32:04] Jesus the light on the world.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; I want to dispel something that maybe
[2:32:12] tradition gave you.
[2:32:15] Well, one day I'll get into a place. One
[2:32:18] day I'll, you know, or it takes a long
[2:32:21] time. I got to find my way and get into
[2:32:24] the presence and get into the spirit.
[2:32:27] You know how long that takes? About that
[2:32:29] long.
[2:32:32] You can just come into that attitude. I
[2:32:34] want to dispel that. The church would
[2:32:36] have you believe that because the devil
[2:32:39] wants to use tradition
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; to keep you away from it. Well, I
[2:32:43] haven't got time. I'll do it now. You
[2:32:45] know, I'll do it the next meeting. I'll
[2:32:46] do it the next time. God can meet you
[2:32:49] right this moment
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; in just a moment.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. with all your mind and all
[2:32:57] your heart and all your soul.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:33:03] I'll walk in the light as you are in the
[2:33:06] light. And then we have fellowship one
[2:33:09] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:33:12] cleanseth us from all sin. That is true.
[2:33:15] That is true. You met me back there,
[2:33:18] Lord. I remember when you met me. I
[2:33:21] remember when you spoke to me. and his
[2:33:23] presence will start to surround you
[2:33:24] right away.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Right here,
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; just now.
[2:33:32] Heavenly Father,
[2:33:36] we love your presence and you have sent
[2:33:40] the Holy Spirit and your messenger told
[2:33:43] us some of these secrets. how you tore
[2:33:46] yourself apart, putting it in a language
[2:33:49] that touches us so deep and you tore
[2:33:51] yourself apart and you gave a little
[2:33:55] piece to every one of us. The Almighty
[2:33:58] God, I wish to say before you, Father,
[2:34:01] and before these people and all who will
[2:34:04] ever hear this message, you are in your
[2:34:09] children. You are in me. And I trust
[2:34:11] that everyone Lord that's under the
[2:34:13] sound of my voice will say you are in
[2:34:15] me. You are in me Lord Jesus. And you've
[2:34:18] given me your word and you've opened up
[2:34:20] your secrets to us and thus we can live
[2:34:23] in this life. Oh God. Oh God we say thy
[2:34:29] will be done. Thy will be done in the
[2:34:32] earth in this body of flesh. Lord let
[2:34:34] your earth let your let this creation
[2:34:37] Lord be in the representation of you.
[2:34:40] bless your people. I'm asking in Jesus
[2:34:43] Christ's name. Amen.
[2:34:48] Leah, my granddaughter, is here.
[2:34:51] And she had she had a kind of a very
[2:34:54] unusual experience in the last few days.
[2:35:00] Can I tell it, dear?
[2:35:07] a man came was came to the door or
[2:35:11] whatever and said, "Uh, may I clean your
[2:35:14] driveway? I have a piece of equipment.
[2:35:16] May I clean your driveway?"
[2:35:19] And she said, "Well, I really haven't,
[2:35:22] you know, I I haven't got the money for
[2:35:25] you to do that." And uh
[2:35:30] and Ava, her daughter, says, "Well, I
[2:35:32] got some cash."
[2:35:35] And so Leah says, "Well, if you'll clean
[2:35:37] it for $10 and a good cup of coffee."
[2:35:40] Yeah. I said, "I'll do that." And then
[2:35:43] they started talking. He says, "Well, I
[2:35:45] live over here in Fort Langley and I go
[2:35:47] to Are you a Christian?" "Yes." She
[2:35:49] said, "I go to a Pentecostal church over
[2:35:51] in Fort Langley." "Oh, okay." So he
[2:35:54] cleans off her drive.
[2:35:58] That's one experience.
[2:36:01] And then she goes shopping to Savon
[2:36:04] Foods or Safeway or someplace and she's
[2:36:07] standing at the cash desk just waiting
[2:36:09] to go through the cash desk and she's in
[2:36:11] a lineup and a voice from behind her
[2:36:14] says,
[2:36:16] "You have such beautiful hair." She
[2:36:19] turns around,
[2:36:21] the lady says, "How long is your hair?
[2:36:23] Is it down to your waist?" And a woman
[2:36:26] looked really quite rough. And she had a
[2:36:29] young man with her, a young a son
[2:36:30] apparently. And and they just really
[2:36:32] looked like they had a real rough life.
[2:36:36] And she said,
[2:36:38] "Is it down to your waist?" No, she
[2:36:40] said, "It's almost down to my knees."
[2:36:43] Oh, she said, "My daughter had long hair
[2:36:46] before I cut it off."
[2:36:49] And she said,
[2:36:52] and then she began to express what is
[2:36:54] inside. She wished she could live a
[2:36:57] godly life. And she says, "You know,
[2:37:00] there's a man."
[2:37:02] She says, "There's a man. He's a He goes
[2:37:04] to Pentecostal church and he's been
[2:37:05] trying to invite me over to his church."
[2:37:08] And she said,
[2:37:10] "Does he remove snow?" Yeah. She said,
[2:37:13] "That's what he does. He removes snow."
[2:37:16] And it was her neighbor.
[2:37:20] And now I was connecting with both of
[2:37:21] those people. But here this woman,
[2:37:24] what spoke to her? She's standing there
[2:37:27] to pay something at a cash desk. Listen
[2:37:29] to sisters
[2:37:32] when you do it because you met God and
[2:37:35] it's a reality to you. God's going to
[2:37:38] use it.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; He's going to use it. Hallelujah.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; And when a person does it of their own
[2:37:45] accord,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; nobody's trying to convince them. They
[2:37:48] do it to their own accord. They can't
[2:37:50] forget that. They'll remember that.
[2:37:53] Hallelujah. Whatever you do, whatever
[2:37:55] you say, we do it all in the name of
[2:37:57] Jesus. We'll just sing the chorus once
[2:37:59] more. We'll walk in the light.
[2:38:04] It's a beautyful
[2:38:06] light. Oh come where
[2:38:11] have mercy our bride.
[2:38:15] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[2:38:23] Jesus
[2:38:24] the light of the world. Would you shake
[2:38:28] hands with one another as we sing it
[2:38:30] again? We'll walk in the light. Well,
[2:38:35] there it is.
[2:38:56] Brilliant. So, God bless you. You're
[2:38:59] dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:39:01] Amen.
