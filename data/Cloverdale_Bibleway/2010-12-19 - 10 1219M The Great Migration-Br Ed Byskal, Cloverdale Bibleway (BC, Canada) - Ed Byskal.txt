So we want to remember them this morning that the Lord would be their portion. Amen. And if you have a need upon your heart or need in your body, the great physician is always on hand. Brother Peter, why don't you come as we remember these requests and prayer this morning. If you have an unspoken request, maybe make it known to the Lord just by an uplifted hand. Our heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we're so grateful to you that we can call you our father. &gt;&gt; We can call you our redeemer, &gt;&gt; our savior. &gt;&gt; Lord God, you've done so much for us. Lord Jesus, as I was just reading before the service, Father, oh Lord God, when you were here, you were just you're walking with the people that you've redeemed, the people that you said that they were your sheep and they were hearing your voice, oh Lord Jesus, and when you came to the grave of Lazarus, Lord God, how you wept and it was just a man just standing there. But your prophet says that was more than a man when he spoke. Lazarus come forth Lord Jesus. You you have called each one of us Lord Jesus out of your our traditions out of our sins out of out of where whatever we came from Lord Jesus. You've resurrected us to new life Lord Jesus. You are redeemer. You are savior father. You are healer Lord God. Oh Lord God you are the resurrection and the life Lord God. We worship you and we love you Lord Jesus for what you have done and what you are doing amongst us Lord God. Thank you for the message of the hour. Thank you for the word that you've given unto us Lord Jesus. Oh Lord God, because by your word is the only thing that we may live live by, Lord Jesus. Not by anything of this world, Lord God. By by the spoken word that was promised for this generation, Lord Jesus, that you've proven once again that you're alive, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord Jesus. And we pray that you'd come down once again this morning, Father. And you speak to us, Lord God. May you ignite our hearts, ignite our faith, Lord Jesus. You know exactly the need of every person that is here, Lord Jesus. May you abide with us, Father. May you walk with us, Lord Jesus. May you draw near unto us, Lord Jesus. We're so thankful to you and we're grateful to you, Father, that you answer prayer, Lord God. And we ask that you, Father, you answer, Father, these requests are repent down, Lord God.

May we receive all the glory and praise in the name of Jesus Christ we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may have your seats this morning. Brother Isaac, why don't you come and get ready? Brother Isaac's going to sing a special for us. Amen. I think I'll uh wait till all the Sunday school kids come in for the announcements. One of them pertains to them. Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Those on the internet hook up and telephone hook up. We want to say God bless you to you. Those in the visible congregation, say God bless you to you as well. Just trust that you enjoy the special this morning. And Brother Isaac, are you ready? All right. [Music] Beyond the sun set, oh blissful morning And with our Savior, heaven is begun. Earth's toiling ended. Oh, glorious dawning beyond the sunset. When day is done beyond the sunet, no clouds will gather. No storms will threaten. No fears annoy. Oh day of gladness, oh day unending beyond the sunset, eternal joy. Beyond the sun set, a hand will guide me to God my father whom I adore. His glorious presence, his words of welcome will be my portion on that fair shore. beyond the sun set. Oh glad reunion with our dear love ones who've gone before. In that fair home land, we'll know no parting beyond the sunset forever more. there with my Jesus forever more. [Music] Amen. Thank you, brother Isaac. Appreciate that very much. Amen. Well, I've got a couple of announcements. So, why don't I go ahead and read those and we'll turn the service over to Brother Ed. I think Brother Ryan, you've got a special for us. I don't want to forget that. So, if I hurry things along too much, Brother Ryan will hit a key. It'll remind me he's going to sing. All right. Remember, although there is no Sunday school classes next Sunday, please have your children in the fellowship hall no later than 10:15 so they can practice for the special. Sunday school will resume at 9:45 on January the 2nd. All right, so we've got that announcement in. How many senior campers do we have here? Let me see a show of hands. Get them up high, guys. All right, this one's for you. Camp winter registration forms are now available at the tithe and offering boxes in the back. They are due by Sunday, January 9th. So, that gives you a couple of weeks to make sure that you get your registration forms filled in. How many would like to get the registration form filled out in the box before the end of the year? All right, I got six. I think three here, one over there, and two back there. All right, I saw a counselor get his hand up. So, praise the Lord. Let's make sure we get those forms in timely so we don't have to remind you once again that it's time for camp. How many know how far away it is? It's less than 40 days. Inside of 40 days. It's not at the end of February. It's at the 1st of February. Basically the end of January. All right. We're excited for camp. Those that would like to sing a special during watch night. During the watch night service, we would like to have you contact Brother Ryan or Sister Elena Hendrickson personally or by email so that we can kind of formulate a plan of attack as to how we're going to get everybody fit in. I know Brother Ed's uh working very earnestly on getting the uh folks from overseas connected with us. So, we're not sure how it's all going to orchestrate together, but we know the mind of the Lord is to have things happen in an orderly fashion. So if we can have you get in contact with brother Ryan if you'd like to sing. So that'd be really great. It's also the end of the year 2010. So tax receipts uh say that you need to have any tithes or offerings or uh things that you would like to have a receipt for in by the end of the year. So, you've got uh just a couple more weekends to get your tithes and offerings and uh love gifts in for the receipts before the end of the year. So, make sure you get that done so that we can have that well taken care of. Service this afternoon, it'll be at 400 p.m. We'll have a communion service. Just looking for a really wonderful time with the Lord today. Amen. Why don't we sing Your Love is Life to Me. Maybe brother Ed can just take over the service after brother Ryan sings. Your love is life to me. My truest longing my deepest me. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe it? For your love is life to me. Oh, your love is me. My true and longing my deepest without you know I don't know where I your love is to me. God bless you all. Just a quick word about this song. I was um Lord was dealing with me once on the the phrase to worship in spirit and in truth. And as I thought about it, it's like Lord, I don't honestly know if I know in the fullness what that means. And I it kind of developed into a prayer. Teach me to worship. And the more that I thought about that, it just began to unfold into other things. Teach me to love. Teach me to pray. And uh then this song kind of ended up as a result of that. And it's just simply called my prayer. I hope it's a blessing. I believe it's something we all identify with. When in my daily life, you lead me into the world to those that need thee. and I'm surrounded by all those who cannot see. Give me a heart that beats as yours does and a life that shines with your love and a grace that testifies of how you love me as I was. And teach me to love. Teach me to love. And when you lead me through the valley and desperate need is all around me and I am called to stand when standing breaks my heart. Oh, let me bear my soul before you as I yield this vessel for you. And with tears stained eyes turn toward you, knowing you will hear my cry and teach me to pray. Teach me to pray. [Music] And when the wind and storms are blowing and I am filled with such a knowing and all around me strife and Questions fill the air [Music] in the midst of all the noises. Through the multitude of voices, give me faith that still rejoices. Then I see you in this storm and teach me to trust. Oh, teach me to trust. And when I humbly bow before you and offer all that I am to you and give you thanks for all you've done and are to do. Give me words for thoughts unspoken. Give me songs when I am broken and a heart that's yielded and open as I surrender all to you and teach me to worship. Teach me to worship. Teach me to worship. [Music] This is my prayer. [Music] [Applause] Why don't we stand together this morning as we invite our pastor to come? I stand and all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the age is alive. from whom the raging of the sea subsides. A living sacrifice. The only source of life. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I forever more. His tender mercies come with every rising sun. to meet the sinner in his brokenness. offer healing and for those who trust me in Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Oh forever is my My is forever more. Let's sing the first verse again. I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the aesthetic forever. Oh, you sing that chorus again. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. is alone forever more. It's my hope is in the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh my home is in the Lord forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Derek. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; for being here. &gt;&gt; And we thank the Lord Jesus Christ for all he's done. Otherwise, we couldn't be here. &gt;&gt; That's why our hope is in him. &gt;&gt; If your hope is in just each other or your family or the preacher or whatever, uh that'll that'll fail. &gt;&gt; But our hope is in him. It'll never fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a wonderful message we have. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gospel. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we're the service this afternoon is going to be at 4:00 because uh the different ones are here from they come from further or away perhaps Seattle, Tacoma and different places. So, we want them to be able to have a little extra time on their drive home. We certainly appreciate all the believers to come and appreciate you coming this morning. We believe if you've come with expectation then God will not disappoint you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful? Uh I also wanted to just say in in reference to uh the announcement that brother Derek made uh with regards to the giving almost every year we have people who give after the first of the year and uh uh and then would like to backdate the receipt and we're not permitted to do that. But if your giving takes place, I would say even up to Sunday the 1st because the accounting and so on will be making deposits after that. But it's preferable uh that you consider your giving and what you want to do with regards to regards to the congregation, your tithes and offerings for the operation of the church and for if you wish to give to missions. uh that's that's the only way that it happens. You know, we we're just a conduit and what the people give not only you here but those on the internet and they give towards the uh missions and we're able to do that. Also, I'd like to uh make make special notice. You see the building is progressing the we call it the school building which is largely what it will be used for. But I want you to think about as I do, I think about the children in the in the as as believers family. Do you know that, and I'll just take this moment while you're standing, but do you know that we have people coming in on a fairly regular basis wanting to put their children in this school because they see them out on the parking lot, they look at them, and I can also tell you, if you were not here on on the other night when they had the uh Christmas concert, certain so on that the inspectors were just here spent a whole day that's the British Columbia government inspectors they were here for a whole day in November and they've given us just a first class rating they think the school and the last time they were here they said we want to take your format and suggest it to other schools in other words there's other schools that need this you know friends even the just the basic fundamental strength that's within the message. There's other people who believe it but not able to produce it. &gt;&gt; It's not your strength. It's the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And if we give ourselves to that, we will express that and other people will see it. They actually want to participate. They want we're not able to accommodate them. So the congregation here should be so so grateful that that God has put it on the hearts of people and uh and uh brother Terry Tatch as the principal and Sister Shelley working in the office. I don't know another principal in the world that drives the bus and picks up children and brings them to the school and delivers them home. &gt;&gt; I tell you I don't know. Do you know anybody? &gt;&gt; No, there's nobody. you you don't have uh anyone who's an educator do that kind of thing. That's the kind of devotion that I say comes with the message. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason people are consumed with that. &gt;&gt; And I'd say God bless the school. So, those of you that were in the meeting and and you uh committed yourself to uh contribute to the building, please don't forget that on a monthly basis because we're paying now every month to uh to have the contractor paid and and everything is looking fine, but we we need the support of the people. And that's what it was all based on. And it's a you're going to see a big difference the first week of of uh January. I understand the walls. You may not understand, but when the walls are being prepared that they're already poured, they're all laying down there in the basement and around the building. And there's just one more pour this next week. And the first week of January, all the walls are going up and it's just a uh really truly amazing. Uh and and the church will be able to use the facility there. uh all I can say is you know as far as my own personal vision is concerned I believe this thing is of God and there are things that I could say about it that I don't want to say just at at this time but I can tell you that this is what I believe in my heart I'm speaking now just from my heart I believe that there's going to be believers families all across North America will be blessed from the educators that will will be able to give the atmosphere and stream it right into other homes where children are sitting around being homeschooled and all the rest of it and they're just in a little enclave by themselves. Why not bring them right into the atmosphere? I mean, we're doing it right this minute. &gt;&gt; You're creating an atmosphere for people sitting by themselves. Maybe some are not well. They're in in in far away places. I know that this service right now is being listened to in Europe because it's a it's their evening time and they just rejoice. We get emails every week. The effect of it and I say God, let's give the message a mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we say, God bless all of you that are streaming at this time. And we trust that you'll be able to say amen and be a part of us. And incidentally on on a watch night service, what the brothers have been working at, they say that I've been working hard. I can tell you there's other brothers, brother Michael, brother Darren, and brother Aaron, and all of these other brothers, brother Nathaniel Iverson, and these brothers been working very, very hard. They're going to try and attempt to connect. We have the we have things in place, but we've never done it before. and actually connect some other congregations, two or three of them in China where the where the people will be right there and the and the minister will be there and we'll be able to have two-way uh conversation. We want them to sing for you and you sing for them and why not? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, whatever God has in his mind. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I'd like to just sing a little chorus. Uh, I I just feel he's so wonderful. I like to sing. Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful. You help us out, Brother Derek, please. Amen. And then we're going to go right to the word. Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful. I see a Jesus my wonderful king. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful. My eyes have seen my ear was recorded in God's word. Isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful? I'd like to sing it just one more time, but I'd like you to turn around and use you're you're saying it, so you shake hands with as many people as you can. And with that on your lips, isn't he wonderful? That's a good testimony to hold this morning. Let's greet one another. Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful. [Music] Wonderful. Wonderful. I have seen my reward in God's word. Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful. And the people said, "Hallelujah. Praise the Lord." Well, now that's that created an atmosphere. I'm ready to preach. Amen. So nice to have brother Timothy Honor Tokco here with us all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa. But the families here, Sister Chantel and Brother Paul and Michelle, we're so happy to have them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to turn in your Bible and thank you for standing to Hebrews the 11th chapter and we're going to read a few verses starting with verse five. I would like to speak to you this morning on the great migration and for a subject I want to direct the thoughts to they seek a country. And the verse starts out verse 5, by faith Enoch was translated or we could say migrated because migration is to go from one place to another. So by faith Enoch was translated or he migrated from one place to another that he should not see death to a place that's in other words beyond death and was not found a place beyond the visible because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. By faith, Noah, being warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness, which is by faith. By faith Abram, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whether he went, by faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him in the same promise. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful, who had promised. Therefore sprang there even of one and and him as good as dead, as so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them aar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things, they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer. Father, this is your word. &gt;&gt; Your Holy Spirit authored is the author of the word. Faithful holy prophets wrote and they spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They desired to look into these things which we see and they were prevented from it. But now you have made them open. You have sent your messenger. You have revealed your word. You have opened the seals, oh God. You have made clear things which were in a short time ago were not clear. We're obscure. But you have cleared our vision. Oh God, we thank you for it so much. Bless the people from the youngest to the eldest in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. The Bible records the movement of his children over the face of the earth in search of a permanent home. We can say with the songwriter, this world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just traveling through. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that are traveling as well, but they're not traveling through with the same purpose and intent that we have. Hebrews the 11th chapter, and we could have read on, but you know the chapter well, is uh a record of some of those that were directed from one place to another. Now, you'll have to really lay hold of my thought today because it's it's it reaches out into a into a sphere of it deals with our instinct. It deals with a supernatural instinct. And brother Brandham refers to he ties faith to that instinct, that sixth sense. It's something else. It's something that the believer possesses. Not everyone possesses it. The believer possesses it. And I want to single uh and and and make that very very distinct. And uh so I have referred to for my own reading and my own study. I've seen that the 11th chapter of Hebrews, the Bible tells about how they wandered in the deserts and so on so forth. I just see a a uh humanity uh a movement of humanity within the sea of of humanity is is currents and these currents are moving and and and currents are under different influence in a in a river in a body of water. And now we're talking about a body of people and but there are some people that have they're moving they're they're being directed by a a a different uh something a different something within them a different instinct within them and uh the believers uh I want to bring that out as the believers have that now the reason for migration and we're familiar with it but the reason for migration and those of you from the continent of Africa when you have come from there. Uh it is such a wonderful wonderful continent and it is so blessed by uh the the creatures and the animals and the birds and so on and they have some of the greatest migrations and I have sat with awe as I have looked at them and I'm going to just show a few on the screen a little later on. But the marvels of the creatures that are moved by instinct, there's no one that can really fully grasp because it it it goes beyond our understanding. They do they do what seemingly is impossible humanly speaking. It's impossible. And we marvel at their at their determination to do certain things. Feats of nature which are so mysterious to us. Even though we, you know, we know everything that we have discovered about them, but all we can do is just watch them and watch them with awe. I wonder if the Bible speaks in Hebrews the 12th chapter that we are encompassed, surrounded, we are looked upon by a great host of witnesses. I wonder if some of those witnesses, if they're able to view us today, if they would look and think of the t era that they lived in in the simplicity of uh uh uh of movement by animals, by horses, by oxen, by camels and whatever more. and and they look at us today and see this mass of humanity, you know, uh hundreds of thousands in the air at any moment traveling at such speeds as the jet travel allows. And I I wonder if they look at and see the enticements and the soft living and the pressures of life. And I wonder if they just don't look upon uh this host of witnesses and look upon it with awe, seeing that there's a still a body of people holding fast to the same faith that they held to and making their way through all of these currents and all of these influences and being undeterred going whether it means life or whether it means death, I'm going to reach my objective. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They do it for food. They do it for survival. They do it for reproduction. They do it for different reasons. But whatever instinct is in them, they are driven by that instinct and cannot be deterred. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, God bless God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. By instinct, they migrate away from the cold of winter &gt;&gt; and head directly to where there is food to sustain them. By instinct, we have moved away from the cold formality of denominations that have been established for hundreds of years. We've moved away from those denominations. We've moved away from the walls that have come crumbling down. They have not supported the people these walls of cold formal uh denominations and I we've moved away from them &gt;&gt; and we've moved away from them and we have we have migrated hallelujah to another place where we found food. &gt;&gt; Our souls were fed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we found a sense of protection and we knew that we'd have food to take us through this famine era. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've experienced this migration &gt;&gt; by instinct. The cattle and the birds moved away as brother Brandham spoke a number of times in India where they were uh the cattle moved away from the walls. The birds moved away from their nests which they had actually, you know, they made their homes in the nest and they moved away from it and sat out in the trees out in the middle of the field and the pastures and very very hot and the and animals moved out to the middle and sat in the heat hours before maybe a day before the earthquake came. And when the earthquake came, the walls crumbled, the birds would have been crushed. Their nests were crushed. The animals would have been killed from the walls that fell down. In other words, there was a sense within those animals, which we call dumb animals. I don't call them dumb. I call them that they were very much guided. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were guided for the preservation of life to move away from those crumbling walls. And even though it even though it meant standing in the heat, though it meant doing something that wasn't pleasant, they were driven by an instinct that preserved their lives. &gt;&gt; And we're being driven, friends. This isn't just some uh, you know, a sloppy agopy thing. This isn't something in the emotional realm where we're just coming to church to have a nice little handshake or a a good feeling with one another. We're being driven &gt;&gt; because there's a consciousness within us. &gt;&gt; This is life or death. &gt;&gt; And if it's not life or death to you, you don't understand what the situation is. &gt;&gt; This is a this is a matter of life or death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got a slide or two. Every year there's the reindeer up in the Arctic and uh they perform what is difficult for most any other animal. They might travel more than 5,000 kilometers or 3,000 over 3,100 miles in the extreme cold of the Arctic. In fact, is one of brother Brandham's dearest friends called Chris Berg. How many know of Chris Berg? He was a very dear friend of ours as our family. My wife and I have known him ever since we were children. He wasn't all that much older than myself, but when I was taking brother Brandham Hunting, he said, "Do you think we could get Brother Chris Berg to go with us?" And I said, "Uh, oh, absolutely. He'll drop everything." And he did. So, he was on the the hunts. Brother Chris Berg took a contract with the provincial government and I'll just take this back to her reindeer to her the reindeer they call her the Arctic caribou and he he took a contract for five years to herd these animals and uh the Canadian US government made a arrangement I think where the US government contributed a bunch of the animals to come over to the eastern in Arctic. Brother Chris was a man of prayer. He had never married. He had never didn't have any other responsibilities than just to serve God in the way that was available to him. When he was hurting reindeer, just one or two accounts, and you may have heard me tell this before, but there's many that perhaps and some on the internet which have not heard it. He was a man of prayer. then you have an idea why brother Brandham loved him and he was in prayer in his tent and he got so intensely in prayer but the stove pipe going through the tent he he the metal collar head was gone and so the canvas uh caught on fire and if you know anything about canvas it burned very quickly but he was so intense in intent in prayer in the tent And they have it walled up with snow around it. And he was he was he was in caught up in prayer and uh the tent burnt down just just gone. And when he came too out of his prayer he looked up and all he saw was the heavens and the stars at night and he thought, "I've crossed over." Said, "I've already crossed over." He didn't realize that the tent had burned down around him. I tell you it's it's a it's wonderful to get locked into prayer like that. I had one more experience and I because I I don't want to go on with these accounts but these are true accounts and I think why the prophet loved him is uh he was there for 5 years and he witnessed all he did was witness and pray. He just witness and tell people with such in earnestness and sincerity that they need to love Jesus and they need to be saved and and he would just tell them everything that he knew. He never saw one soul saved. Sometime later after he'd been there 5 years, we had a a missionary to the Eskimo people, Inuit they call now, and they he was at our church and he said to me, "Do you know Chris Berg?" I said, "Yes, of course. When he's here, he comes here to this church." Oh, he said, he said, "There's been a sweep." And they had the pictures and showed pictures of the Arctic and they had a revival amongst the Inuit people. And he said, "You when you're just up speaking, they would come and they would run down and tears streaming down their face and give their lives to Christ. The Holy Spirit came on them and swept over the whole Arctic. This man flew a Sessional 180 plane and would land where the where the Inuit were because they would travel with a caribou. And he would and he said he said as soon as they got up and God had brought salvation to them, they'd say, "Where's Chris Berg? &gt;&gt; He's the one who told us about this." And he said it was because that man's witness &gt;&gt; over the whole Arctic in five years that God poured out his spirit upon the whole place. One man. Hallelujah. Can we say praise be to God? &gt;&gt; And God hears your witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where you are, you don't know the effect of it. You might not even be around when the effect happens, but it will surely happen. &gt;&gt; And that was his testimony. &gt;&gt; Five years. Never saw a soul saved. But I tell you what, he became a friend of the prophet of God. They say also every year there's a a million wilderbeast in the Serengeti. And uh these wilderbeast they migrate from the southern Serengeti in search of grass and water that they need to survive. And they will travel 2,000 miles devouring 4,000 tons of grass a day. But when you see them jumping into that river, and I have seen, if you have an opportunity to see it at IMAX, you see some that aren't making it. They're not making it, but they died trying. &gt;&gt; That's a big difference, friends. There are those that have died in the faith. There are those that have laid down, and some of them died at an early age. They burned out their life for God. But I can tell you that at the great gathering, they'll be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at them. Brother Brandham said, "God has so provided." He spoke of the horses as an instinct. Horses has an instinct. They can smell storms for miles away. &gt;&gt; He said another time, he said, "You find you read in the newspaper the weather forecasters and they say beautiful weather in the next few days." He says, "If you have a a a s hog, just a pig, and she getting her the corn husks from the north side of the hill and bringing them around to the south side and making her bed on the south side." He said, "Don't you believe the newspaper. You believe that hog." &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are butterflies. Monarch butterflies. They come from way up in northern part of Canada and they fly all the way down to southern California to around Mterrey and fly down into Mexico. Their wings are 4 in across. And now here's a absolutely amazing thing which I didn't know until I just began to read a wee bit about them. But they spend their summers in the Great Lakes and uh and in the fall they migrate southern California, Mexico and even into Florida. Uh on route the same trees on route the same trees are chosen as resting places every year. And of course, none of the insects uh none of the insects have seen these trees before. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's in the genes, folks. &gt;&gt; And they rest on the same trees. And yet they land and mass on the same branches generation after generation, migration after migration. And down in California, they they rest at the same place and they only feed on one weed called the milkweed. That's their food. And because of the cycle of life, some of them because they some of them do not make this trip. And then the young ones are born and the young ones fly exactly the same place, land on precisely the same trees and rest at the and and and go to the same place for the for the winter to come back. Now this is this is the uh some of the migration and he said by and large these are the ones destined for the round trip south once more without leaders and without any prior experience millions of monarch butterflies will make their way south toward their Pacific Grove winter sanctuary year after year instinct draws them back to the identical trees where their ancestors passed previous winters. Isn't it amazing? They were saying also about instinct. I'm just taking a few minutes. They were saying also about instinct that We'll just shut those off now, please. Thank you. this instinct that these creatures have and so many of them have it and I related that to uh the people but they were they brought the honeybee uh what he does by instinct what they do by instinct and they spoke about the marbles they were speaking about what is instinct and we have it as humans, but we don't understand it. Perhaps we don't understand it in the creatures. And they said that some creatures, there's all kinds of ants and termites and all kinds of creatures that migrate. They have incredible migration and go incredible distances and expend unindescribable energy and strength and do it for survival for different reasons, but mostly having to do with food, having to do with protection, having to do with the create their their uh reprodu reproduction of others and and that drives them just uh uh it indescribable. So they scientists say, well, it seems that some of them are pre-programmed and they can't do anything else because that's what's programmed within them. But they say there are others that that certainly have a degree of of of knowledge because they can actually make some decisions and they have decision making uh uh abilities. And here we are as humans. And now I'm going to go into the message now with that as a background because brother Brandham even says that the Holy Spirit put it in the animals. &gt;&gt; Now just to give you a bit of understanding. Follow this real close. The Bible says this is going to come to you sideways. The Bible says as it was in the days of Noah. Now what actually happened in the days of Noah? A preacher preached for 120 years. He was not a very successful man. After preaching for 120 years by the by the standards of the world. After preaching for 120 years, he had eight souls &gt;&gt; in the ark. &gt;&gt; That was a wicked time. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, Jesus said as it was. And I can tell you it's a wicked time. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're sitting here in a congregation. I want to say to you young people, you're living in a very vile, wicked time. &gt;&gt; It's unclean. It's unclean as it can be. And I want you to look deep within yourself and and ask yourself, do I have something? Why am I here? Why am I in this service? Is there something deep within that speaks to me? Is there something? Brother Brandham says, "I love nature." Because he saw God. I just wasn't showing you some pictures of some creatures, but he saw God in the animals. He saw God in the universe. And when we look to the heavens and when we look and see these things, even these few little slides today, I'm not trying to describe what what what possesses these animals, but it's good for us to look at them and say, "That's God in his creation. That's God in his universe. This is God in his word. And this is God that has come in flesh today. God has sent his God has sent his word. The God that sent his word and made all of these things. The God that even put the instinct within these creatures. What What has he done for man made in his image? What kind of instinct do we have? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the scripture says, "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead. So that they are without excuse." God is saying the world is without excuse because God is visible in creation. And he said, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened." Amen. &gt;&gt; I I want you to ask yourself the animals that came into the ark. God said to Noah, "You will take two of every creature and and and seven of the clean, but two of of all the creatures of all the animals and creatures that went into the ark. I want you to ask yourself this morning, what was it that caused the two &gt;&gt; of all of them, all of the species were there. Perhaps thousands and thousands of them, but two, &gt;&gt; something spoke to two. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they came and they came to Noah. &gt;&gt; What What drove them to Noah? &gt;&gt; What caused them to come to Noah? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had the word &gt;&gt; to preserve them. &gt;&gt; And God had a greater plan to preserve the creatures &gt;&gt; and they must come out into a new world. &gt;&gt; And the seven the seven the seven of the others &gt;&gt; and they came to Noah. Seven came to Noah. &gt;&gt; Seven walked into the ark. They were driven to go. Something was in them. Something motivated them. They were listening to an inner voice. And that inner voice was going to take them out into a new world. They're going to walk out of the ark one day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there's been something that's driven us into the ark. Christ the word. &gt;&gt; We're not here because, you know, we just have a certain appetite for it. We're here because it it answers to something within us. &gt;&gt; And we find there our food. We find there our preservation. We find our protection. &gt;&gt; We find what satisfies us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you were first converted, the prophet said, "And show us the father." He said, "You remember when you were first converted, how different things looked. The trees looked different. &gt;&gt; The birds sounded different than they ever had before." He said, "God had just come in here." &gt;&gt; And God speaking out in his universe. &gt;&gt; You just got converted. You just got into a different location. You got into a different sphere and everything looked different and things sounded different. It was because God had come into you &gt;&gt; and God in that nature and God in creation started to mean something different to you. If you haven't experienced that, I hope that you will. He said, "How I love to watch him in his nature." How, and that's a prophet. If he loved to watch it in nature, how much more even we should, God, how he provides things. These little ducks come up from the north down south and go there and make their nests on this lake. He said the little ducks are raised there. They're hatched out. And in September gets cold, the first breeze comes down across the mountains and there's real cold breeze. He says, "Well, those little ducks." He says, "Now, he has never left that lake." &gt;&gt; He was born there. He has never left that lake. And he says the first cold breeze, and I know what I'm talking about. I have been up in the north, lived so much of my life there. And that first cold breeze just goes by like that. He says that little Drake, he'll put his bill up in the air. &gt;&gt; Smell that? He said he'll give a few honks and all the other ducks, ducks on the lake will just come right gathering around him because he's a leader &gt;&gt; and he knows that he knows that winter's coming. And he says he'll lift up off that lake and fly as straight as can be right to Louisiana or down to the rice fields in Texas. What is it that caused him to do it? What is it in him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this great leader of the Holy Spirit that that gave the word of God and and and and so some people hear the prophet and he's just another preacher. Some people heard Jesus Christ and he was just a great teacher. He's a great man. But to another one, he said, "You have the words of eternal life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a different sound. I hear a different sound, friends. Glory to God. This message, I'm consumed with this message. It's a different sound. It's not just some other teaching. It's not some just some other doctrine. It's a different sound. It's speaking to an instinct. And I know that that instinct is going to guide us because it's the Holy Spirit guiding you &gt;&gt; from here &gt;&gt; to a new world. &gt;&gt; Behold, I make all things new. That instinct that's in you is guiding you to that place &gt;&gt; where he who put the instinct there says, I have created all things new. Oh, what a place. We don't want to miss that one. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says it's God working in his nature, working among his animals. And if you can give a d give a duck enough sense to know how to get out of the cold weather, what ought it do to a man that's born again of the spirit of God? &gt;&gt; A woman born of the spirit of God. Yeah. I &gt;&gt; tell you kids, there's a lot out there. Every demon force, every enticement, &gt;&gt; every kind of pleasure, every kind of thing that will appeal, if you lean for a moment to the world or the things of the world, if you lean for a moment just to what makes you feel good or or what will make life better for you, it'll guide you in a wrong direction. But you listen to that instinct. You listen to that voice. You listen to the sound that God sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "When they leave northern British Columbia," speaking in a super sign in ' 63, he says, "I hear those geese going over screaming the way they go going south." He said, "I can listen to them and cry because I see God guiding them." He said, "What what guides them through the pathless air? What guides them? They've never been that way before. What guides them through the pathless air? They know precisely where they're going. He said some kind of instinct draws them together and they get together and swarm before they fly and before they go south. What is it? He said it's a revival time. I wonder what it is that has gathered people around this message. I can tell you friends uh I I I got another message. I don't want to get on to it, but I hear another voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've heard the voice of the shout. &gt;&gt; A lot of people heard brother Brandham preached, but only some of all the masses. We're We were guided into the ark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it's been ordained to step out into a new world. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil trap you. Don't let the devil deaden that instinct or cover it over. You listen to that instinct. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't want to be on down the road and say, "I should have listened." You want to be up there and say, "I'm glad I listened." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to speak about 11th chapter of Hebrews. Enoch. &gt;&gt; He migrated from one place to another. And the Bible says, now we're talking about this migration. The Bible says that by faith Enoch was translated, but before he was translated, he had this testimony that he pleased God. And I asked myself and want to ask you why did he why did he do that? Why did he please God? It wasn't because it was easy. It was because he had an instinct within him. I want to please God. I want to walk with God. &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice, friends. Listen to that voice. I want to walk with God. Forget every other voice. Listen to that voice and just do what that voice tells you to do. Don't do what the world or anything else. Don't listen. and don't be moved by the pressures of this life. &gt;&gt; Satan's got lots of pressure. &gt;&gt; And then Noah, following the flood, following the flood, the earth began to be populated through the three sons of Noah, Sham, Ham, and Japheth. And brother Brandham said there's only three nationalities of people in the world, three classes. Ham, Sham, and Japheth. Ham, Shem, and Japheth. The whole human race. this side of the flood came from them. You believe that? The countries we lived in changed our colors. Black, white, brown, yellow, whatever color that has nothing to do with it. We come from we come from three children. And that's Jew, Gentile, and Samaritans. And I think of uh when brother Brandham was uh now just please c catch this when he talked about Jesus revealing the secret of the heart and it goes to the woman at the well. She was a Samaritan and brother Brandham said Jesus did and he demonstrated this revealing the secret of the heart to the Jew and the Samaritan. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never did do it to a gentile until this day. &gt;&gt; And now he leaves Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; in the day when the son of man will be revealed. He reserves that for this time. And he sends one messenger, &gt;&gt; one leader. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One leader and pours through him the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ. And he comes with even the same characteristics. He came out of poverty. He came out of being not known by anyone. He came on the scene doing miracles, doing the impossible. And that's precisely the same pattern. Why is it? Because Jesus, I'll come to it in a few moments. He came on the scene to an institute to initiate a a migration. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. This message came to initiate another migration. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was here, I call it the first phase of the epic journey. And now in this day, it's the final phase of this epic journey from this world to a new world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By a Holy Ghost instinct, by a faith. Hallelujah. It's in our genes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in our genes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Here's the spirit of God &gt;&gt; in God's provided way." He said, "Now, here's here's the spirit of God in the animal life brought the animals into the ark. The spirit of God on the animal life brought the animals into the ark. And how much more ought the Holy Ghost to men and women today who believe God, who hear the scriptures, people who think of the Holy Spirit, oh, I got filled with the Holy Spirit and it's so far beyond that. It's so far beyond a feeling and a chill down my back and and all these little trinket signs. It's way beyond that, friend. The Holy Spirit we got in this day came said, "I'm the author of this word. I'm the one who's revealing this word." And the instinct within you says, "I want to understand that." [Music] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not satisfied to take a casual look at it. &gt;&gt; It is this very word that's going to move you, &gt;&gt; going to protect you, going to feed you, and going to see that you succeed in your journey. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might get hurt and wounded along the way, &gt;&gt; but if you listen to that inner voice of the Holy Ghost, you'll make it. &gt;&gt; If you listen to this voice and that voice and the other voice, do you hear me? If you listen to that voice, this voice, and another voice, there's all kinds of voices. And the prophet said, "There's so many voices in the world that it will dull &gt;&gt; the true voice of God." I'm interested in the true voice of God. And the only assurance I have of the true voice is God came in behind it &gt;&gt; and vindicated it. &gt;&gt; And that's the voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Among all the animal life, there were a few that were elected &gt;&gt; to go into the ark. &gt;&gt; And our ark is Christ. There's a few that are elected to go into the ark. I can't answer for everybody else. And the Bible says Genesis 7:9, there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark. Two and two of all the masses. They went into the ark. They went in unto Noah, the one who had received the message of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. male and female as God commanded Noah. The Bible tells us a little further in this migration of humanity. And the whole earth was of one language when they came out into the new world, another part of it. And they were of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. And they said, "Go to let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach into heaven, and let us make a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth." So they had within their own mind, let us prepare ourselves so that we're not scattered. We're not sent into some kind of a migration over upon the face of the whole earth. And so let us go down. And God said, "Let us go down there and confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech." It's really amazing how God, he didn't take them by force to change uh their program. He just changed their language so they couldn't understand one another and they got a they got a babble out of it and then and that scattered them. And the Bible says, "So the Lord the Lord scattered them abroad from fence upon the face of the earth and they left off to build the city these that built a city and a tower of Babel, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the earth." And so the Lord scattered them. And God God commenced another migration. &gt;&gt; And the families of Shem, Ham, and Japheth began to migrate in different directions. And God was the initiator of that migration. &gt;&gt; A migration of humankind over the face of the earth. I just want you to see this sweeping, this movement. Then we move on quickly and the Bible says by faith Abraham was called. Now we've got people over the face of the whole earth as a result of the after the flood. But now we have Abraham. And when he was called to go out, one man he was called to migrate, one man into a place that he should after receive for an inheritance. He obeyed and he went out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not knowing whether he went, &gt;&gt; he was being guided. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By some force, &gt;&gt; by some instinct, but he'd heard the voice of God. leave your place and go out. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said it was difficult for him. He was comfortable. &gt;&gt; You know, we have our homes. You have your homes, you have your friends, you have your families. &gt;&gt; And now God by the word of God, &gt;&gt; Abraham is being called to go out and to leave his comfort zone &gt;&gt; to a place that I will show you. &gt;&gt; So that was his faith. I've heard it. I'm listening to it. I don't know where this message is going to end up. I don't know where it's going to take me, but I've heard it and I'm going to follow it. &gt;&gt; It may cost me my friends. It may cost me my family. It may cost me a lot of things, but this is what the vindicated word is said. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to stand with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll never be popular. Right. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he went out not knowing whether he went and by faith he sojourned. He sojourned in a land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob and the heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker was God. So now he's he's he's he's in a state of uh of wandering as it were, but he's being guided and he goes from one place and if you read the life of Abraham, it will say that God met him and God spoke to him and he built an altar and he was a great altar builder, but he's in a constant migration. He's migrating. He's not found his resting place yet. And he keeps going uh in in this uh being driven. And and so I say from the time of Abraham, from the time of Abraham, the world could never be the same because God, are you listening? God was introducing a faith seed &gt;&gt; in the midst of that migration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw in this man a certain quality, a a quality of faith that would become a friend of God. and he entered and a faith seed entered into the human scene. And this would change the whole dimension of human life from that time forward. And we're sitting here today. Listen folks, you're not just sitting here in Cloverdale Bible Way. You're either sitting here as a member of the faith seed. &gt;&gt; And Abraham is your father in the faith. &gt;&gt; Are you connected? &gt;&gt; Then I want to say to you, what was in him is in his kids. What was in him is in the genes, &gt;&gt; faith genes, supernatural genes &gt;&gt; brought down by God himself. &gt;&gt; And the two seeds, two seeds or two streams of life began flowing out now from Abraham. &gt;&gt; He's got a natural seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even after Sarah was gone, he remarried and had several children. He's got a natural seed. He's got natural children, but he has a faith seed. And brother Brandham is very specific. And Apostle Paul is very specific. He does not he does not say and to thy seeds plural, but to thy seed singular. &gt;&gt; It was a seed. And it's it and and it was going to move down. In other words, what's in you is going to be passed on to Isaac, &gt;&gt; thy son. He says, "Take thy son, thy only begotten son." And he had Ishmael. He had other children. But take because that son was a son of promise. That son was a promise was a son of the word. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say to yourself while you're sitting here, I am here because of the word. &gt;&gt; I'm not here because there's a nice church. I'm not here because of the music. I'm not here because of a certain preacher. I'm here because the word is here. It's being preached in its undiluted form. And what's in me answers to that word. &gt;&gt; That's an instinct. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, that instinct is what's going to carry you from this place to another place. &gt;&gt; This building's going to be nothing but ashes. And I say as the prophet said, taking the words from the song, "What then?" &gt;&gt; When this is all gone, what then? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When friends are gone, &gt;&gt; what then? &gt;&gt; When families are no more than teaspoons of ashes &gt;&gt; in a grave, what then? &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say, "I'm of Abraham. I'm in the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have been returned back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; And then I will be in the bosom of God who sent me here. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; God does not say that his seed will be better than others, &gt;&gt; but that they will be different. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say your seed will be better than all the other s all the other people, &gt;&gt; but they will be different. &gt;&gt; They'll react different. And God said, "Between me and thee." Those are the two main words, "Me and thee." Between me and thee and thy seed, singular after thee. Genesis 12:1 17-7. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee. Listen friends, I'm not talking about something that is historical. How long have the wilderbeast been doing this? How long has a monarch butterfly been doing this? &gt;&gt; They've been doing this for centuries. &gt;&gt; They did it long before you and I were here. And if time will go on, they'll continue long after you and I are gone. &gt;&gt; That's how important we are. But after we're gone from here, I plan to go either in the faith or in the rapture. One of the two. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will establish my covenant between me, he said, God, and thee, and thy seed after thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as that seed would continue, thy seed singular faith seed after thee. The messenger, the last verse, the last chapter and the last verses of this Old Testament, the word of God says that he will send Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the children. Here we are. &gt;&gt; Back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To thee and thy seed after thee. Here we are. We're the after thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have made my covenant, God said, between me and thee, Abraham, and your seed after thee. We're the seed after thee. We've been in a a great migration. [Music] flowing out and the seed of brother Brandham says the seed is not in in the message the seed is not the shock will not be heir with the shock he said here this seed one one seed not seeds but one seed &gt;&gt; these others were not seed of Abraham because Abraham's seed was his faith seed that God was speaking of not his natural seed seed. And so we have a natural seed. We've got populations of people in the earth. If you would raise up and perhaps see it through God's eyes, you'd see masses of humanity. &gt;&gt; And they all have their own little world that they live in. They all have their own struggles. They all have their own concerns. They have their own battles. They have their own temptations. They have their own ambitions. They love their children like we love ours. The world is just a mass of humanity just moving like constant moving over the face of the earth. But in that stream of humanity, there's a current of eternal life. And God has promised and given covenant to not only Abraham, but he's promised to himself. Some of that down there is my children. &gt;&gt; And it's not just this flesh and blood. It's not that. It is the faith seed. Some down there believe me. &gt;&gt; And and God says to Abraham, And he said unto Abram, is this all right? &gt;&gt; He said unto Abraham, know of assurityity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge. And afterward shall they come out with great substance. In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham, saying, Unto thee unto thy seed have I given you this land from the river of Egypt under the great river, the river Euphrates. And now something else is taking place here. And this is why I really need you to follow with me very very close. It's a it's a lesson to the young people. If you can remember, I'm I'm going in a sequence. I'm going in continuity. Now, we've gone through the the migration after the flood &gt;&gt; to the time of Abraham and then another part. And now he has his seed. And and and then the days of Lot, which I mentioned last Sunday, and the children of these two men, the nephew and his uncle, and their families begin to go in different directions. It went before the days of Lot, the days of Sodom. Actually started before the days of Sodom. There was uh there was distress in the family. &gt;&gt; Have we had distresses in families? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there was a distress in the family &gt;&gt; and it was so severe that it it it rippled out to the workers and the servants and the employees, the shepherd people &gt;&gt; and they began to, you know, struggle between themselves. And so Abraham, he says this, Lot, if you go this way, if you migrate this way, I'll migrate this way. If you say I will go this way, then I will go this way, &gt;&gt; and you can choose first. And Lot beheld the well-watered plains, and he says, I'd like to go this way. Abraham said, "That's fine." And he took the lesser and they parted and away went Lot in his direction and begins a migration. Then the two angels come to him. And this is where I cut in from last Sunday. And then the migration continues, but he's being led by something else. He even says to the angels, "Can they said we're going to destroy this?" said, "Well," he said, "Can I go to this little one? Can I go here to this little one?" his wife has already turned back and been turned into a pillar of salt and he still wants to go to a little city. There's something something is drawing him &gt;&gt; that's different &gt;&gt; than Abraham &gt;&gt; because Abraham's being guided by faith &gt;&gt; and he's wandering through a land that has been promised but there's no evidence that he actually possesses it and wi with Isaac and Jacob and he's wandering through this land the Bible says but faith was guiding him when you say faith was guiding him what was it was an instinct I want to walk with I want to walk with this God that talked to me. I want to stay where I can hear his voice. &gt;&gt; I I want to be in a condition. I want to be in a place where I can continue to hear from him. &gt;&gt; That was Abraham. &gt;&gt; And Lot, he wanted to have whatever benefits that the world could give him. And so he continued on. And Abraham said, "Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wil take the left hand, then I will go to the right. If you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes. And beheld all the plain of Jordan. It was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zor. And then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan. And Lot journeyed east. He migrated east and they se separated themselves one from the other. There's something that triggers there's something that triggers a migration as you see in the pictures of these animals. And brother Brandham says about the little duck says it'll be the first breeze that comes the first cold breeze &gt;&gt; that comes and it triggers a migration. &gt;&gt; I got to move away from this. I say this without apology. When you feel that cold negative breeze coming your direction, hear me folks, you move away from it. &gt;&gt; You take your God-given wings &gt;&gt; and move away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not talking about individuals. I don't care who the individual is. I don't care if it's my family. If you hear a negative and something that is not according to the word of God, you move away from that cold thing because that'll do you damage. Satan wants to use those things &gt;&gt; to create situations that will leave you wounded. &gt;&gt; Just move away from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something triggers the migration to the promised land. And here's what the scripture says. Are you able to follow me? &gt;&gt; Paul, Apostle Paul said in Galatians, "Wherefore then serveth the law." What did this law do? &gt;&gt; Thou shalt thou shalt not. Thou shalt thou shalt not. What good was the law? What did it do? He said it. It was added because of transgression. Because there was if there's no law then there's no transgression. So God gave a law and then the people become guilty and they say oh I'm not supposed to do this. Now the law made the transgression. It gave and it brought a guilt. But he said this that wherefore serveth the law. He's asking a question. What did the law serve? said it was added because of transgression because the people were committing transgressions, but they didn't know there were transgressions till the law said. You can go down the street here if there wasn't a 30 mph zone out here, you could drive 50. And so some would drive 50, some would drive 60, some would drive 40. But it's dangerous. And so the they they with their science and everything put in a law and says it's 30 or in Blaine it's 25 or it's it's 50 kilometers or whatever it is. This is a speed limit. This is a safe that we're trying to keep it safe for the people. And then if you go beyond that, you feel a little guilty. You're wondering if there's a a cherry light blinking behind you because you're breaking the law. And soon as you're breaking the law, there's a sense of, you know, everything's just not right. And you feel a wee bit condemned only because you know that there's a sign there and you go past the sign and it says 30 and you're going 40. You feel that? Bunch of you are smiling. It's all right. That's what it came. But it says that's not the end of the verse. It says till or until the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. &gt;&gt; And the reason for this is we're not talking about speed limits. We're talking now about a law that people can't keep. &gt;&gt; You can't keep. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man once. He was a 7th day Adventist and he says, "I I I live by I I live by the commandments." I said, "Oh, do you? You live by the commandments?" I thought I'd just zero in. I said, and I talked to him about the commandments. I said, "No man can keep all the commandments." And the Bible says in the New Testament, "If you break one, you're guilty of all." &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're guilty all, including the one on the Sabbath." He said, "Well, I keep the Sabbath. I keep Saturday." No. If you break one of the others, then you've broken them all. &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're not living by the law." &gt;&gt; I said, "No, man. The law is fulfilled in Jesus Christ." And so the script- the scripture tells us that the law was added because of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made. And so when the seed came on the scene to whom the promise was made, the promise in the seed triggered that migration &gt;&gt; and they began to they began to now we had Abraham's children, his children in in Egypt and there has to be what's an exodus. If you look up the word migration, you'll find out one of the meaning of migration is Exodus. There's a people there that had to migrate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they wanted to migrate long before they did. &gt;&gt; And they cried to God. &gt;&gt; Send a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Send a Messiah. Send somebody who can lead us out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so how what was the process? &gt;&gt; There was a burning bush. There was a voice in the bush and then the voice was in the man &gt;&gt; was in Moses &gt;&gt; and Moses went down and he didn't feel very adequate. So he spoke and God the voice had told him speak to Aaron your brother. He's good speaker. So he spoke to Aaron and then Aaron knew what to do. Speak to the Levites his sons and then they will know what to do. But it all came from the bush. &gt;&gt; It came from the voice in the bush. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know about the voice in the tree that says to the voice in the tree that spoke to a prophet and said, "Don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. When you get older, you'll have a work to do." I am the result of that older work. &gt;&gt; I'm the result of whatever spoke to him out of the tree. How do you know it was God? Well, I wasn't there to be I could never I don't have any special equipment to tell that that was God. But when the voice came out of the tree to the man and the man preached it to the people, there was an instinct within me and said, "That's the truth." &gt;&gt; I've had questions in my heart concerning this word, who God is the author. And then and then when this man speaks, the questions were answered. And then it's it's not a big it's not rocket science to say the one that was in the tree who spoke to the man, one man on the earth, he has to be the author of this word. &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; That's not difficult. &gt;&gt; So, so, so the seed was there. Now the people were there and the and the one who gave the promise spoke and he came now and he said uh that I've heard from God and God has sent me and the time of deliverance the seed was there and so the law was there until the seed should come on the scene. Help me now so I can get through this as quickly as I can. And it triggered another migration called an Exodus. I hope you're getting to see it. When God speaks, there's always a migration. When God speaks, he wants to transfer you from one place to another &gt;&gt; spiritually, sometimes physically. But just remember, don't allow any physical Don't allow any physical migration to impede your spiritual migration. [Music] &gt;&gt; So much said, &gt;&gt; and there's a migration of the people that possess the promise. They didn't understand it. And he says and the mighty God unveiled Jesus is our Moses of today. Moses veiled was the living word to the people today. Jesus veiled is the living word to the people. Jesus is Jesus in the church the Holy Ghost the son of God in the people revealing the world word by the promise of this day makes it just exactly the same. And he says and remember &gt;&gt; Moses did this and manifested this not to all the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say, not the voice that came to Moses didn't go to all the animals. &gt;&gt; The voice that came through the prophet of God in this day didn't go to all the animals. &gt;&gt; The voice that God spoke in the day of Noah didn't go to all the animals. It went to those that were ordained to come into the ark. Oh my brother, my sister, if I could just impress this upon you &gt;&gt; that God has made a way and God has has laser accurate &gt;&gt; brought the word to you &gt;&gt; wherever you were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought the word to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you were ordained to go into the ark. You're ordained to come into the word. &gt;&gt; You're not ordained to join a church, &gt;&gt; this church or any church. You're ordained to come into Christ the word. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's I feel such a responsibility to make known the word of the hour to emphasize the word of the hour. That's all that counts. [Applause] Whether that word brings us joy or whether it brings us heaviness or whether the word brings us whatever it brings us sometimes it brings us peace. Remember now the same word oh my the words of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said I didn't come to bring peace. &gt;&gt; Here's the prince of peace speaking but a sword. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Remember also that the lamb, he was the lamb, was he not? He was the lamb of God. Go and read about the lamb. It's not just tenderloin roast. &gt;&gt; It was also the inward parts. &gt;&gt; Do I have to eat that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the bitter herbs. I don't really care for that. This isn't a smorgus board where you take what you want. &gt;&gt; This is you take the lamb &gt;&gt; and eat it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And there is a time of such joy and such peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Boy, I just feel completely you know my whole inards are in are just bursting with such joy and happiness. But then there's the other time of that you're still eating the lamb &gt;&gt; and it'll really show who you are. &gt;&gt; It says, "And Moses did this and manifested this not to all the world but to the Exodus people." &gt;&gt; Hello Exodus people. &gt;&gt; Hello people in migration. Hello people who have been triggered into this movement into this final epic journey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By an instinct &gt;&gt; called the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I haven't time because our time is gone. &gt;&gt; But the the whole scripture God said in scripture because I have so many. He said, he said, I will scatter you. You'll go under migration &gt;&gt; by God's scattering. &gt;&gt; And the same God says &gt;&gt; and I I will gather you. &gt;&gt; You'll be in another migration. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send you one direction, &gt;&gt; not from the Serengeti, but by the word of God. I'm going to send you in one direction, &gt;&gt; and by the word of God, I'm going to bring you back. God sent the Jews over the whole face of the earth. &gt;&gt; They were all over Europe. They were all over the entire earth. &gt;&gt; You from South Africa, they were there. You from Congo, they were there. They got into this business, into that business. Why? Because God scattered them &gt;&gt; over all the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; And he scattered the peoples of the earth &gt;&gt; over the whole face of the earth. But he promised in the end time, I'll gather them. &gt;&gt; I'll gather them back. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not the Jews that gave themselves the flag back again and the money back again and everything. It It's the word of God that gave it. I'm going to gather you back &gt;&gt; to the same land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I must I must just say that and say no more. And then out of them he scattered them. They went into Babylon. They came out of Babylon. They went into Egypt and they came out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; They went into Egypt by the word of God. They came out of Egypt by the word of God. They went into Babylon by the word of God. They came out of Babylon by the word of God. But an instinct. And all through this masses of people was a faith seed. There were some that believed and one was called Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that instinct caused her to say, "Let it be unto me according to your word." &gt;&gt; I don't understand how I, as a virgin, going to conceive a son. &gt;&gt; That's never been done before or since. &gt;&gt; But I know I will receive what you speak. Let it be unto me. That's the kind of people that God is his family. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth a son. Never was one like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never was one like him, friends. &gt;&gt; Who speaks like this man? &gt;&gt; Tell you, my heart is moved. &gt;&gt; We sing the choruses and they're lovely courses to be like Jesus. But when we're singing it sometime, we may be thinking about, I want to be like him, you know, as I picture him at a certain time. But do we want to be with them when they were accusing him and sending him out of this place and whipping him and saying all kinds of all kinds of nasty things and saying and and he and he began to speak. Hey, it wasn't just at the cross. No, he began to speak and he said, "Except eat my flesh and drink my blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had just had 5,000 people in a meeting. 4,988 left him. Right. &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. To be like Jesus. This is what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Will you also leave me? &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; You have the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of eternal life. &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I yearn for eternal life so great. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of eternal life. I'm in a migration this morning. You're in a migration this morning. &gt;&gt; Headed for eternal life. And there's nothing else in this world that means anything. &gt;&gt; And Jesus commenced another migration. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; I've got to take a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; He's just ready to leave now, but he's initiating a migration. He's a mo he's a prophet like under Moses and he initiated a migration. Moses did. And now here's another one. He said, "Go ye &gt;&gt; into all the world &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel &gt;&gt; to every creature." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they that believe and are baptized, they'll have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Heal the sick, cast out devils, raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Freely you've received. freely give and he began a migration [Applause] &gt;&gt; and they began to go &gt;&gt; into all the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With this gospel &gt;&gt; and the migration picked up motivate uh uh picked up uh in increase &gt;&gt; of people &gt;&gt; and they begin to move this mass of people, &gt;&gt; this group of people Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to go you into all the world and preach the gospel. And then Jesus said, "How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because along the way, &gt;&gt; we're going to have some, we've got to have some guidance. &gt;&gt; I cannot determine exactly where my next footstep is. And neither do you know where your next footstep is. &gt;&gt; But he has promised us. He has promised us. He said, "You will have it within you." &gt;&gt; Amen. and he will tell you what your next footstep. Listen to that voice. Whatever you do, [Music] &gt;&gt; brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. friends, those of you on the internet, whatever we do, I can say on the authority of God's word that Holy Spirit will give you an instinct. &gt;&gt; Gives it to the horses, smells a storm miles away before it comes. Gives it to the pigs, gives it to the ducks, gives it to the butterflies, gives it to the insects and some of the lowest, and gives it to these animals. And they know where to go. They know exactly what their food is. Surely the same God of creation has given us this instruction has given us such a fine-tuned guidance. And I don't believe that I am here by accident. I don't believe you're here by accident. I want to believe I've been led here and you've been led by a divine laser has nothing to do with this. This is accurate beyond laser beam. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If we ever needed a leader, we needed one in this end time. &gt;&gt; I would have not have known. There's a scripture that ministers and those have read. They've read it for centuries. While the animals have done all their migration thing, there are times when the people read the scripture, but it's not for their day &gt;&gt; till the seed will come to whom the promise was made. &gt;&gt; And how this is a blessed promise. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. &gt;&gt; You and I are not going to hinder those that have are asleep in the faith. For the Lord himself &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven &gt;&gt; with a shout &gt;&gt; and with the voice of the archangel, &gt;&gt; and the trump of God, &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them &gt;&gt; in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, &gt;&gt; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; We needed a leader &gt;&gt; that could tell us what that meant. &gt;&gt; And now in the very closing one of the prophets last messages called the rapture. &gt;&gt; He refers to this scripture. &gt;&gt; And he says this is the order, the great order. And that's the only time he used that phrase, the great order or the order of this great rapture. And the order is there is a shout. We knew nothing about that. It's quite common to many of us that read the message today. But the shout &gt;&gt; will be first &gt;&gt; and then the voice and then the trumpet. And that's the order. And the sh for the apostle Paul says, "We who are alive and remain, &gt;&gt; they hear the show." He says, "The show is the message." &gt;&gt; The show is the message. Now, the message has already been declared and it was at the end. Oh, I hope you can grasp it. It's not difficult, but let me get it across. I pray the Lord will help me. At the very end of the message, the messenger only has maybe six hours left of preaching &gt;&gt; out of thousands. &gt;&gt; Six for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now, here's the order &gt;&gt; of the rapture." Amen. &gt;&gt; As I started out about 3 weeks ago &gt;&gt; and was speaking upon the instructions and applying the instructions, &gt;&gt; you have to read the instructions. And now God is giving us the instructions for the rapture. Read the instructions. Hear the instructions. Do exactly what the instructions say and you have the result. the one who gave the instructions and stands behind it and he he confirms it and the instructions are there will be a shout and the shout is the message and the message had already been essentially concluded. &gt;&gt; There was only three more services to speak and the message was already concluded and it had already gone out. We have we have been the recipient somehow. And I'd like to ask you, you know, why you're here. Not so much why you're here, but what is it that ignited something? &gt;&gt; What is it that caused you to be perked? &gt;&gt; Something came your way. And as I look across this congregation, I see from north to south to east to west and there's been already a physical migration. But the physical migration doesn't mean they say the whole world is a community today. It's just become a village. That's fine. But amongst that whole sea of humanity that is going to and fro throughout the whole earth. And the scripture says the days will come when they will be be young men and young women will be seeking for bread. &gt;&gt; And there will be a famine in the land. And the famine is for hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh God help me. &gt;&gt; The famine is for hearing the instructions. But you can't hear the instructions without the leader. &gt;&gt; And Moses was concerned about being the leader. He says, "How? They won't hear me. They won't listen to me." And God didn't change his mind. Says, "I'm still going to use you. It'll be Aaron. Speak to Aaron." Brother Brandham, he didn't he didn't really want he didn't choose the kind of life &gt;&gt; that he lived &gt;&gt; that was ordained of God. And friends, it was not an easy life, &gt;&gt; but it was lived for you and I. &gt;&gt; Jesus life was not an easy life, but he lived his life for you and I. &gt;&gt; Is this coming across to you? &gt;&gt; But now come the last phase, just the last phase of this journey, this great epic journey from mortality to immortality. I look on you young people. Hey, doesn't take very long. I look upon some here that were a lot younger as I was a few years ago. But we've been on a journey &gt;&gt; and it's a great journey. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't want it any. We're migrating. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not just migrating to another city to a better place or, you know, a better life. That's not it. We're migrating to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I desire that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about something in the end time message is to get the bride ready &gt;&gt; and prepared for the rapture. &gt;&gt; And according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back &gt;&gt; to the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Bring them back to the faith of the fathers. There's something strange, &gt;&gt; a strange presence that begins to move within the believers. And it's a it it's not a timid, weak strength. &gt;&gt; It's something that's very strong. &gt;&gt; I want to actually preach on it as well, Lord willing. I want to preach on the aspect this generation, you know, is a very soft, &gt;&gt; limp, &gt;&gt; generation. But you read those in the scripture. We talk about David's valiant men. &gt;&gt; We talk about the believers and read Hebrews 11 when you're done. They wandered around in the dens and caves of the earth of whom the world is not worthy. &gt;&gt; They were saw aunderder. They were tortured. They were slain with the sword. And others would not even uh they said that they desired a better resurrection. So they didn't want to escape the sword. To me, friends, that's not the group of people that grew up in this generation. We we we've got a different pressure. We got one of soft. But I think that I want to bring across to you, Lord willing. There's something tenacious, tenacious about the people, the believers. And we we are to be a a not merely a strong people, not merely veilant people, but aggressive &gt;&gt; with our faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because uh when I when I went and saw I I actually listen quite a long time ago. I saw these animals I in their in their journey and I even asked myself why are they doing this? Why are they doing this? And you know it helped me to understand myself because then you start asking yourself why am I doing this? Why are we in this journey? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I guess the better question is could you quit? &gt;&gt; Could you let go? I can't &gt;&gt; say, "Well, to whom would we go?" &gt;&gt; I urge you with everything that's in me, live it. &gt;&gt; Live it &gt;&gt; with greater force. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Live it with a greater zeal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you be too on fire? I don't believe so. &gt;&gt; I don't believe so. Live it with everything that you have because the day will come surely and you'll remember these words when you will not regret having lived it. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I want to sing. If the musicians will come, please. I want to sing. I feel the pull &gt;&gt; and I've I've heard the call &gt;&gt; and the spirit. I love those words. It's calling me to give my all. Let's just stand. Let's bow in prayer a moment, please. Dear father, thank you for your kindness. Thank you for your grace that has called us and brought us here, Father, by the Holy Spirit. And we we've heard many references of the Holy Spirit. The fire he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and fire. &gt;&gt; Lord, I feel that fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I sense that burning within. &gt;&gt; I sense that determination, oh God. Not merely in the animal kingdom and the creatures of the earth, but we you have spoken to us. &gt;&gt; You have sent a powerful message to us, oh God. And I say publicly before this congregation, before all that will stream or ever hear this service, I feel the pull. I hear the call. And Lord Jesus, more than just hearing it, we're here to say, Oh God, I'm here to listen to it. I'm here to obey it. &gt;&gt; I pray that your will will be done. Oh father, and now this after service and as we prepare for this evening to receive the bread, the wine, and the Lord's table and the washing of the feet of the saints, Jesus, as you did, I pray that we will heed your word and love and embrace your commandments in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless this people I pray oh God in a way that we as humans cannot bless one another but bless them father I pray in Jesus name for your glory. Amen. I feel the I hear the call. [Music] And his spirit moving me to give my heart. He speaks to me. [Music] And I agree. [Music] Lord, please come and take control. I feel the Lord. Are you agreeing with the pull? Do you agree with the pull? &gt;&gt; Have you felt the pull? &gt;&gt; You have, obviously, because that's why you're here. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to lift your voice up and make this a declaration. Lord, not to me, not to anyone else around, but I'd like you to speak it to the Lord. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I hear your call. &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And my spirit is answering &gt;&gt; to that call. If you'll take these moments and give yourself, I know that God will confirm it to you. Wonder if we can just pick it up just a wee bit, please. I feel the call. I hear the call. Oh, and his spirit is moving me to give my own. He speaks to me and I agree. Hallelujah. Take control. I feel the once and once again I feel the I hear the in his me speak to All that I am, all I ever can be. Oh God, [Music] I feel I'd like after this service that you'll never be the same. I want you to walk out of here. I want tomorrow morning. I'm praying and I believe and I'm asking you, you walk out into this world and you say, "I'm in a divine migration. &gt;&gt; I'm moving. I have a voice that has called me and has beckoned me and has taken me in a different route than all of these people that I'm around. &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, [Music] &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that God will come in behind that &gt;&gt; because you have honored the word that's been spoken even today. God will come behind it and he will he will cause your life to have a different testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we cross over, as I was saying to the brothers the other night, we had a gathering of the trustees, the deacons and the ministers and the workers in the office and so on just in recognition of their work and labor. And I said, "We have one goal. I'm not going to keep you now. We have one goal and one thing is certain. When the prophet went beyond the curtain of time, when brother Brandham went beyond the curtain of time and all these people were there, he said, "Who are these people?" Said, "They're your people." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are they Brandhams? No, they're your converts to Christ. &gt;&gt; And one place he said, just one place he just dropped and he said, "I saw you all there." &gt;&gt; There's no time with Gloria. I saw I saw you all there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that time comes, what do we really want to what what do we want to have as individuals, as people? You're all individuals. I don't care about your age. We're all individuals. What What do you want really to have happening at that time? Say, "Well, one thing for sure, we all want to have. I was true. I stood true with this word. &gt;&gt; It was a costly word, but I stood true with it. &gt;&gt; And I've given it all I can. I've given my all. And that's what this course is all about. We're going to do it and then we're going to have a word of prayer and be dismissed. I feel the fall. Oh God, I hear the call and his spirit is moving me to give my all. He speaks to me and I'm going to bring my Lord and I are free for come and take the truth. I feel the cold. &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Dave, brother Dave Jabberov, would you come please and dismiss us in prayer and was he this afternoon, Lord willing, ponder these things, would you please just ponder them very, very deeply. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. We just bow our heads, saints. Lord, it's been an incredible experience to be here this morning. Father, Lord, when I came here this morning, I just thought in my mind, Lord, I'm I feel like I'm just going to sit down on the grass by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Lord, and hear from the very voice of my savior, Lord. And Lord, I believe I have had that experience this morning, Lord. I've heard from your very voice this morning, Lord. We want to thank you for your word this morning, Lord Jesus. We want to thank you for a God-given instinct, Lord, that's that's brought us from around the world and has brought us, Lord, to this place. &gt;&gt; Not this building, but this place, the ark of your word, Lord Jesus. this place where we can hear your word through the &gt;&gt; through the ministry that you have called us under. Lord, &gt;&gt; we are truly eternally grateful. Lord, &gt;&gt; we look out in the world and it has nothing for us, Lord Jesus. This is our diet, Lord. This is our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, there's so much to say. It's just &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to believe and do what we've heard today. Lord, &gt;&gt; this migration, Lord, we're on a migration, Lord. We just want to keep migrating, Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't want to &gt;&gt; stay stagnant, Lord Jesus. We want to keep moving, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray for every life in divine presence from the oldest to the youngest, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Especially the young ones who are just starting out in life, Lord. We just pray that you would impart them &gt;&gt; with a stabilizing force in their lives, Lord, that would keep them from the hand of the enemy, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we just don't want to see one life in this building that Satan can get his dirty hands on, Lord Jesus. We pray that you would put a hedge about them, Lord. Just fill them with the Holy Ghost. Lord, that is what they need. That is the stabilizing force. Lord, I pray that you would put the Holy Ghost into every young life in this building this morning. Lord Jesus, let not a one of them leave this place, Lord, without that inner life that will guide them through this journey. Lord, &gt;&gt; like brother Ed said, it's it's life and death. It's life and death. They It's not maybe they need it. It's they need it. They need it. They have to have this Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give it to them. We pray Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you for this time. &gt;&gt; Lord and we just go with us. Prepare us for tonight. Lord, we pray. We thank you for your servant, our brother Bisco. Lord, how we appreciate, Lord, just decades, decades of service. Father, God bless your servant, &gt;&gt; and give him many, many more days as we're here on this earth. Give him strength. Give him revelation &gt;&gt; in his body. I pray, Lord, &gt;&gt; and we pray that, Father, as a &gt;&gt; as his sheep that you've placed us under. We pray for our pastor this morning for Lord, bless him, &gt;&gt; and his family, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother David. Thank you. Will you sing this anthem with me? It take less than 2 minutes and then we'll be going home. I believe the true reward. Hallelujah to the lamb. Oh, glory be to God. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I live in the presence of the king. With that on your lips, I dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. We'll see you this evening 4:00 at the Lord's table. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music]
