We ask you all this blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. As you have your seats as the Sunday school children are making their way in, we're going to have the choir come right up. So, I've just got as the choir comes up, we've just got two announcements, have everybody coming in. If I make the announcement while everybody's coming up here, 50% of us miss it. That's a pretty big risk. If you're in risk management, that's a probably a risk you don't want to take, right? There's probably insurance people out there that would say that's not a that's not a safe bet. I wouldn't go with that statistic. All right. So, two announcements this morning. So, a late afternoon lunch is being provided by the sisters of the church here in the gymnasium of the school. That'll be next Sunday afternoon at 4:30. So for the sisters and the families, please bring all prepared food and coolers to the church fellowship room and place on the tables provided. If you have any questions, you may contact the office. I believe an email has gone out. Phone calls have been made. So if you haven't been contacted and you're not sure what to do, just make sure that you um touch base with somebody in the office. And we certainly appreciate all the labor of love that's going into these meetings next weekend. It's going to just be a real wonderful time. Now, for those that missed it, happy Mother's Day for the mothers that didn't make it in. The last announcement we've got is we want to take a photograph um of everybody in the congregation immediately after the service after it's been dismissed. So, if everybody can just go outside on the east side of the building, we'll take a photograph for the collage of photos that we want to have for the meetings this weekend. Is that clear? &gt;&gt; I got two. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; All right. Right. Well, we're going to enjoy a wonderful special this morning. Brother Ryan, God bless you.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ryan, for that song and the choir. Thank you. God bless you each one. We I enjoyed that. I I just are worshiping with you. I don't know what the next line melody is, but I just sang with it anyway because it kind of flows along. You can kind of sing in the spirit, you know, just kind of get on the note and stay with it. Is that all right? Hallelujah. Uh I know that you've heard the announcements and uh we want to get right into the word as quickly as possible, but we do certainly want to honor and greet our the mothers in the congregation. Uh mothers, grandmothers, whatever more. And we're we appreciate you. Uh if it wasn't for our mothers, we wouldn't be around, would we? So we thank them. And uh a lot of the mothers perhaps are not here. There may be elsewhere. And we want to give thanks to God for godly women and mothers in the congregation. &gt;&gt; No service this Wednesday as you have heard before announced. No service this Wednesday and people actually are beginning to arrive on Thursday. Some ministers will be arriving on Thursday as well. and Friday from 2:00 to 5:00 over in the gym auditorium. And that's what I call it, not the gym, but I call it the gym auditorium because the church is going to be using it. Also, we will have a get acquainted time, just a little informal time if you like to slip by and meet some of the people that perhaps have arrived by that time. And that will be that will just be from 2:00 to 5:00. At 5:00, it's over. And uh at 7:30 will be the service. Brother Tim Puit will be preaching at 7:30. Saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. Brother Ron Spencer will be speaking. And then Saturday evening at 7:30, Brother Timuit again. Sunday is a full day and we want this time to be a time of thanksgiving and worship. And so what we're doing, the services are intended. And I I trust that the word will come to you in such a way that you will be lifted up to give glory to God. And that's the only thing that we're really interested in. To him be all the glory. &gt;&gt; Anything that's been done, he has done. &gt;&gt; Anyone who's saved here, he has saved &gt;&gt; and he's the author of salvation. And we give him praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's all these meetings are about. But on Sunday morning, we have announced on the announcement 11:00 service, but we want to just move that up a wee bit. And I would like for as many as possible, the whole congregation if possible. Uh we should be here by 10:30. We want to start the song service as soon after that as possible. and and by 11 or just ahead of 11:00 uh we want to it's not a presentation but it is to give an overview of the 40 years of time and there's been quite a bit of work that's been put into it. I haven't put a lot into it. Just have had the concept and the idea. But I believe that you will hear things that you hadn't heard before, discover things you had not heard of, and see things perhaps you hadn't seen before. We encourage you to be here. It will be a wonderful, wonderful service. And uh that part will probably take uh maybe close to an hour or just a little better. And we're going to get the service directly over to brother Tim Puit who is going to be preaching the um main that will be the main anniversary service. Uh I've spoken with brother Puit. I spoke also with brother Ron Spencer and uh it just the grace of God both on their own have said God has given them a direction for the service &gt;&gt; and I thank God for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Yesterday was a wonderful day. Also, we uh we have uh I perhaps should just finish with this. Uh after the morning service, then as has been announced late in the afternoon, later in the afternoon, there will be a lunchon for everyone. And uh uh I want to thank Sister Karen Ashdown for taking a hold of that. We were just going to have like coffee and desserts because it was such a mammoth task to try to feed everyone and you know you start having trying to feed five or 6 hundred people. But we just decided we might as well bite the bullet. At least they decided that and are going to set up tables over in the gymnasium. Uh the subfloor is down and uh brother brother Derek I believe is going to bring the excess carpet that uh from the camp and so we'll be able to lay the carpet down and just roll it out and have the tables there and be able to feed everybody and I understand that's been announced as 4:30. Is that right, Sister Karen? 4:30. So I want to thank you ladies for uh your contribution and bringing the food and so on and we want you to be able to have a wonderful time. We trust that this will be uh etched in our memory &gt;&gt; and let us remember what God has done &gt;&gt; and the Bible encouraged the people you tell your children &gt;&gt; so what God did &gt;&gt; and tell them how God delivered you. out of bondage. And this is one thing, friends, we never want to forget. &gt;&gt; It always comes alive again. Tell them how tell the children how God delivered you out of bondage and where you came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and then that will merge right into the evening gathering. We're going to remain over in the auditorium. Uh there will be some singing and perhaps some uh greetings and there's going to be a number of ministers here that won't have an opportunity to speak but we would want to be able to have a chance to have them presented before you and give a greeting to you. Now I have another uh an announcement which is going to be a surprise to most everybody. Uh we were going to have uh we were going to have the dedication of the school on either the first weekend of J of June or the second weekend of June and I had invited brother Donnie Reagan to come and be with us and uh I gave him the two weekends and he I before I did I said we'd like him to come and do a dedication. and he said, "I will certainly pray about that and thank you for the invitation." And then when I gave him the two weekends, he said, "Well," he said, "I'm so sorry." The first weekend he has brother Paul Laf Fontaine coming down and having special meetings and the ne and the second week they actually are having like a a Bible youth Bible school for the church and the and then they have a special uh a series of services at the second weekend with the young people, the senior young people and he just wasn't able to come. So, I just I just left it like that and uh I I started to feel directed to move the dedication up close right behind the anniversary services. And so, we're going to have on the following Friday, the 25th, there will be no Wednesday service that week either. And we'll following Friday on the 25th, we're going to have the dedication of the school. And one of the reasons for that is we already have uh uh we'll have the platform there uh all set up. It's a portable platform and it'll be set up as a result of the anniversary meetings. That way we'll just be able to leave the platform there and go directly into the dedication service. So that will be on Friday evening on the 25th of May. Amen. I see a few people freeze up. They think we have to have all of that ready. There's nothing really to be ready. We just go there relaxed and just do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to give glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and give you a chance for some of you people who haven't been in there to see where half of this congregation is, at least half of it's been working for the for the last couple years. And we're thankful to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for standing and remaining. Um we're going to turn to the word, but just before we do, I wonder if you would bow your head and let us pray together. Dear Lord Jesus, this service would be nothing without you. We thank you for your divine presence. &gt;&gt; We sense your nearness. You have heard the worship. Not only heard the worship, you have received the worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our prophet has said that's what made you God. when you created angels and they worshiped you. And Father, we willingly and with all of our with all of our hearts and souls, we worship you. &gt;&gt; You're the only true God. You're the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. You're the holy one of Israel. You are the God that has restored your word to us. Where would we be, Lord, if we did not have this restored word? Thank you for an uncompromising messenger, prophet, messenger delivered. Thank you, oh God, for your clear uh proof and and and vindication that you just would not allow any of his words to fall to the ground. We thank you for it. And now we can come with such confidence, oh God. And we pray that you will bring this reality to our hearts. Anoint your servant, Father, and anoint your servants that hear the word of God. May we be strengthened thereby the name of Jesus Christ. And let the congregation join together in how the Lord Jesus taught us to pray. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen. and the people can say once again, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank you for standing. Turn in your Bibles if you would please to Isaiah the 40th chapter and we'll start at verse 15. Read down to verse 18. Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance. Behold, he taketh up the isisles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will we liken God? Or what likeness will you compare unto him? Look down to verse 24, please. Yay, they shall not be planted. He was speaking now of Israel. Yay, they shall not be sown. Yay, their stalk shall not take root in the earth, and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. I would like you to turn to the book of Daniel, please, the fourth chapter, and we'll read from verse 29. Daniel 4:29. And now as we begin to read, if you would please remember that Daniel and his friends have been taken captive and uh Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, one of the most majestic and uh greatest of kingdoms. Uh this is written of him and Daniel, he has had a dream. not Daniel, but the Nebuchadnezzar has had a dream and he's seen this great tree uh spread out and the fruit and so on and so forth and he was troubled about it and there was nobody that could interpret the dream uh and he called Daniel. He always had confidence in Daniel and so Daniel has interpreted the dream and this is part of it. Verse 29. At the end of 12 months, he walked in the palaces palace of the kingdom of Babylon that is Nebuchadnezzar. The king spake and said, "Is not this great Babylon that I have built for this for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?" And while the word was yet in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, "Oh King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken, the kingdom is departed from thee, and they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. They shall not make thee to eat I rather they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxmen. And his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like bird's claws. And at the end of the day, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me. And I blessed the most high. And I praised and honored him that liveth forever. Uh whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing. And he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, "What doest thou?" At the same time, my reason returned unto me, and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honor and brightness returned unto me, and my counselors, and my lord sought me unto me, and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful reading. You may be seated. I I would ask for your full attention, please, and just as little movement as possible because not for my sake, but for the sake of those that are around you and I I need your full attention as I'm I'm striving to move in a thought and I would like to convey it to you. I want it to have its full depth of meaning as it has impressed myself as well. I want to say as a beginning all nations and humanity is truly in God's hand. God lifts up who he will and God destroys who he will. He lifts up who he will and he puts down who he will. All kingdoms rise and fall. Civilizations rise and fall and uh uh they rise to the heights of their majesty and disappear in the sands of time and God is in control of it all. &gt;&gt; Nothing is out of God's hands. &gt;&gt; Uh the Bible says, and this is for our certainly for I I trust will be for your benefit. I just trust it'll be more than a message to you. Jesus said when he told of the tears and the wheat that was sown, he answered and said unto them, because they had asked him, he that seth the good seed is the son of man. And I want to say to this congregation and all that are listening, you are not in control of your own life. &gt;&gt; God planted you here in the earth. And for those that are the elect predestinated of God, God had a design and a plan and a purpose in bringing you here at this time, &gt;&gt; at this season. And we want to I have titled this message, thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this. the words of Mori to Esther when she thought that perhaps she would get by without the uh wi-i without the persecution that was coming upon the Jews h in the kingdom at that time and her her uh they say uncle it wasn't her uncle but one who had adopted her daughter daughter Mori he said to her that you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this and don't think for a moment that you'll escape and if you do not do what God has called you to do. God will raise up someone else from someplace and he will do it. &gt;&gt; So he was giving just absolute confidence in God that this is going to happen anyway. God is not going to permit his people to be destroyed and God has raised you up for such a time as this. And I want to say to this congregation and I trust it will just go right down to the very depths of your soul. There has not ever been a people that has had the word revealed to them through such a profound ministry as we have had. And we are accountable for what God has given us. &gt;&gt; And do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Everyone understand that &gt;&gt; this is not something that God has taken lightly. There is you can search church history if you want. And there has never been a time that there has been such a messenger with such a proof of ministry, such a vindication that went on for so many years. And and if you even have a hesitation at what I'm saying, you need to ask yourself uh can I find such a thing? And if not, why did God do that? Because that is a supernatural act of almighty God &gt;&gt; is great as anything you can read in the scripture because it was none other than the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he said he that sweth the good seed is the son of man. &gt;&gt; The son of man has sown the good seed. &gt;&gt; Your mother and father did not sow the good seed &gt;&gt; by by your mother's death. And we thank God for Mother's Day. But by mother's by mother's uh by our birth, by mother's by our mother, we die. &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; We're all aging and we will die. &gt;&gt; Unless we're changed and go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; But by our by the birth, by the second birth, we live. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "The field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom and the tears are the children of the wicked one to &gt;&gt; and a subject." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Those are the words of Jesus Christ. And we accept that. &gt;&gt; Now to kind of set the scene just a wee bit, I read also from Isaiah 61 and3. And this is the uh this is brother Brandham's text for shalom. So he says, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, &gt;&gt; and his glory shall shine upon thee." Amen. &gt;&gt; This is such a paradox &gt;&gt; uh that arise and shine for your light has come but darkness and gross darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; Uh this and another scripture I want to read is setting a stage. I won't apologize for reading these scriptures but please catch the theme of them because I need to make a a curve in my service just immediately. He uh God spoke to Jeremiah and told him, "Go down to the potter's house and I'm going to speak to you there." So, he went down to the potter's house and he watched the potter when making a a vessel, but the vessel had a mo in it. And so, he he took it apart and and uh and restarted all over again and remade it so that he didn't have a mar in it. And uh he said Jeremiah said, "I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels." &gt;&gt; And and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he made it again another vessel, &gt;&gt; another vessel. &gt;&gt; So it had perhaps a different form, a different shape, a different something, but it was another vessel &gt;&gt; as it seemed good to the potter. And then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter, sayeth the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh house of David." I want to say to the waiting congregation that God sent this word and we can say perhaps different people uh we differently may have a different emphasis upon the message. Some of you have been born in in message believing homes and you maybe don't have you don't see it from the same perspective and others uh such as myself I've seen it for many years and am just amazed I'm amazed I'm amazed at the grace of God I said what grace is this why are we worthy to have such a such a incredible ministry I want to say that whatever you view or see within the message or within the movement ment of the of the people of believers of this time as I viewed Pentecost and viewed the denominations and we viewed what is happening. Whatever it is that you view, I just want to make one declaration very clear. God is going to achieve exactly for the whole purpose that he sent this word. He's going to achieve it &gt;&gt; whether you're in it or I'm in it or not. He's going to achieve it. He's going to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; And I and because I know that because I have that confidence in it, I say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; allow your grace, &gt;&gt; allow your sufficiency to come to this poor soul &gt;&gt; that I and you might be in that." &gt;&gt; I want to say with the messenger, don't miss it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to miss it. And that's not something that is should bring fear to anybody. But don't miss it. In other words, put your whole focus. That's why you're here. That's why God planted you in the earth. &gt;&gt; He planted you for that purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not not from some human purpose. He planted you here for his purpose. &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh God, thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Whatever your purpose is, let it be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a writer, he's a Jewish writer, and he's written a little history of the Jews. And I wonder if you would just bear with me as I read. Uh, has anyone here read the indestructible Jews? This man had a I won't say much about it, but I think he had a has an incredible grasp of uh of the Jews within world history. And and so this is not a bunch of dry history, but he explained the difference and I have gone into also the difference between between dynasties. He said uh world history is not a succession of dynasties. Dynasties being like they have in England for example. You know it's a family a royal family goes on down from you know father to son or mother queen to son and whatever more and there's all you know the papers are always full of who's going to be the next one in England to sit on the throne. That's a dynasty. But this gentleman, he says, "The world history is not a succession of dynasties, but rather tidal waves of civilization." And he says, "The and he just starts in this very brief, and I'm going to read it. The Aadian, Sumerian, and Egyptian, he's speaking of their civilizations. these civilizations sweeps in on the shores of the planet earth followed by the emergence of the Babylonian and Assyrian emperor empires and that was very much in Daniel's time and also Esther's time. These give wave to the Persian title wave of success. Persia is washed away by the Greek idea and then the Greeks are engulfed by the legions of Rome. And next the Byzantine and Islamic civilization flood o flood over the shores of history and feudalism arises in Europe. Finally, we see the modern age weighed in on the wave of capitalism and industrialism. But where are the Jews? We have raced through 5,000 years of history and not beheld a single one. We know that they are there somewhere. So we look again and more closely and we do see them riding cultural surfboards on the crests of these tidal waves precariously bobbing up and down with the rising and falling fortunes of these civilizations. And after the flow of a civilization has reached its high point, we see it slowly eb and ultimately sink into the depths of historical oblivion. And we see the Jew in that civilization go down with it. But whereas each sunken civilization, I want you to listen close now. This is where I'm coming to. Whereas each sunken civilization remains submerged, the Jews emerge time and again from seemingly doom, riding the crest of a new civilization, &gt;&gt; rolling in where the old one flowed out. &gt;&gt; We see the Jews make their first appearance in history in the Babylonian world about 2000 BC. when the Babylonian state disappears. And I just want to stop there. Daniel saw Babylon and he said to the king of Babylon, "You've seen this great image with the head of gold and the arms and the breast of silver. And each of the four were inferior." and your prophet told you that you are in the toes of iron and clay. &gt;&gt; Don't forget and don't think for a moment that we are living as the elites of civilization. &gt;&gt; The elite was a head of gold &gt;&gt; and the majesty and the glory and the power of that kingdom of head of gold. We don't we're not even hardly in the picture. We've got a lot of fluff. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of plastic. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of illusionary things. &gt;&gt; And Satan has set up in this age of deception to make us think this is so glamorous and that it's empty and it's vain and it is nothing. That kingdom of the head of gold was certainly a great Babylonian. And that's when the Jews appeared as Jews, not Hebrews necessarily, but the Jews. And he says, "And the state disappears and the Jews make their entry in the Persian Empire. As the Persian as the Persian world disintegrates, they announce their debut in the Helenic drawing room. And when Rome conquers the world, they settle in Western Europe, helping the Romans carry the banners of business enterprise into the barbaric Gaul. And when the star of Islam rises, the Jews rise with it to a golden age of intellectual creativity. And when feudalism settles over Europe, they open up shop as the bankers and scholars. And when the modern age struts in, we find them sitting in the architectural staff shaping it. What can we make of these events? Are they mere accidents of history? Are they but meaningless facts? Or does this improbable succession of events have a predetermined purpose? If so, who drafted such a blueprint? &gt;&gt; God or the Jews themselves? I want to go from there to say that God planted not only the Jews in the earth at a certain time, not only Esther and Mori at that critical moment and she was finally possessed of a spirit say if I perish I perish. But I go in at this critical moment and as I closed last Sunday and two people saved a nation &gt;&gt; and I want to say to you uh unequivocally you do not know what your sole purpose is in earth and you will not discover it until you've crossed over. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says every person influences somebody. You are influencing somebody. May God anoint you and fulfill you and fill you with the spirit of God to send someone upward &gt;&gt; to send someone into this rapture &gt;&gt; place condition &gt;&gt; in the message show us the father and it'll satisfy us. He says, "To you that are born again of the spirit of God, when God planted you in Christ Jesus, which is the inexhaustible fountain of life, &gt;&gt; everything you have, everything you have need of was put in you when you received the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Everything you have need of was placed in you when you receive the Holy Ghost for your life's journey, for your healing, for your joy, for your happiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to have the big picture. I enjoyed so much our brother Killet spoke on uh Wednesday evening &gt;&gt; and he he he spoke on and I I I really uh trusted you were listening close and for those you that weren't here you can hear it on the archives but he just said you know it's it's one thing to see the big picture to see he wasn't using those words but to see you know the bride the whole body of believers etc etc but we need to identify ourselves individually and he spoke to the individual and I really appreciated that. Now I now I want to just take the big picture and I want to be able to say that you know you need to see the big picture but you need to see yourself as an individual within that big picture. &gt;&gt; It's not enough just to say you know the Christians or the bride or the message that's not sufficient. You got to see me in that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need to see that. Brother Brandham says, notice closely. He says, "I'm an American. I'm an American." And yet he was part of a bigger picture. He carried that forward in his testimony in the message testimony said, "I'm an American. Generation after generation back to the third or fourth generation uh been American. Many brands been planted and he breaks it. See how the other day he says I was walking through France and many of them laying there fell in the war. I had four brothers uh in this last one in this last war. He says one of them helped me in the prayer line. In fact, as I was in a meeting and I saw that was his brother Howard saw helped him in the prayer line. He says where he has had four years in the Navy and give up as a hopeless case, hundreds disabled. And he got on to speak about, you know, those that had suffered and so on. But then at the end, he said, "That's right. I'm an American, but just as sure as I'm the minister standing in this platform. We're heading for judgment." &gt;&gt; So on the one hand, he says, "I, as an individual, I'm an American." But he didn't get he didn't lose sight of the big picture. But as a nation, we're heading he said, "As sure as I'm standing here, we're heading for judgment." &gt;&gt; Now listen to me, friends. Please listen to me today. And I want this to be inscribed into your very mind and soul. We are in a civilization that's in demise. Amen. &gt;&gt; This civilization is heading for disintegration. &gt;&gt; This civilization is heading for death. &gt;&gt; As certain as you're breathing God's free air, &gt;&gt; this civilization is headed for death. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, if you open your eyes, you'll see death everywhere. &gt;&gt; You'll see it expressed in the minds and faces of the people. &gt;&gt; You'll see it on the streets. You'll see it in the malls. You'll see it in the young people. You'll see it in the elderly. This this is a civilization not heading to majesty and glory, but this civilization is heading for death. &gt;&gt; It's everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's laden with sin. &gt;&gt; It's being washed with sin and iniquity and evil. And we certainly have come to the days of Noah where it says that the thoughts of men's hearts was only only evil evil continually. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham speaks with a sense of pride about his country. He does say I'm thankful to be an American. He says I'm glad that I'm an American and thankful for it. He said he'd sooner be there or in Canada. He said they're twin sisters or their sisters. And then he says, uh, and I'm glad to be an American and thankful for it, but I tell you, it certainly needs a counter revival. It sure does. And it will not get it. Isn't it incredible how truthful and how forward? And if you get those nuggets, you can you can just say, "Thus sayaith the Lord after it." They need a revival but they will not get it. And he speaks also that it turned it aside. He even gives a year 1956. And after that he said they turned it aside. And I can tell you, I was living at that time, just married a couple of years at that time, and the country was absolutely a wash with great revivals and tents and speakers and healings and miracles of every kind, north and south, and other places in the world. But did they get a revival? No. And then God came with a revival for the bride, a revival of the restored word of God. And those multitudes that were there, just a sea of humanity for the most part missed it. But one here, one there, one over there. And I thank God I can say one here. And it took a while to find out you've come to the kingdom for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; I sat as a young person where you young people are sitting. I sat as a young married man with young babies and children where you people are sitting. I've sat also as an elder in the churches and listen to men preach. And we've come to the realization that we have come as a body of people to such a time as this. God raised up this congregation to send a word around the world and you have given of your tithes and of your offerings. And I want to say we have tried to be and before God true stewards of what God has given to us. We've sent people out. We've sent ministers out. someone that probably would be a surprise to you, but brother Dominic Sangamina, who we married here, uh I didn't find out after he'd been here about a couple of years, came into my office one day and let informed me that he had actually started a couple churches over in Africa and Kenya and Tanzania. Came originally from Uganda. He has been out on a on a ministry mission. He'd been asked to go and minister at different places. He's been in Sarnia, Ottawa, Lexington, Kentucky, Georgetown, Kentucky, Quebec, and right today, this Sunday, he's speaking at Danny Fars in Manitoba. And he is uh he he sat up there for a long time. Now, he sits with his wife at at the back, Sister Astrid, and uh and he just came, but had such honor and respect. came in came into my study and said he'd been asked to go and to speak and he would be taking this trip and uh it didn't ask for any assistance or anything just going to take this trip and go out and minister been sitting here quietly amongst you and I know probably 99% of you didn't even know he would stand behind the pulpit and preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to hear and I'm sure you want to hear what Jesus said to the woman &gt;&gt; who gave the oil to pour over his feet. &gt;&gt; And it always has moved me. She was a nobody &gt;&gt; as far as the people. She wasn't one of the disciples. She not even called one of the great women of the Bible. But Jesus said great words about her. She hath done what she could. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to lift your hand and say, "I want to join. I want to join. I want to hear that." &gt;&gt; She have done what she could. &gt;&gt; You'll influence somebody. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you and listen very closely. I don't care what the state of your what the state of your life is. You have come to this kingdom at such a time as this. This civilization is fading away. This civilization is going to dust. [Applause] [Music] I want to refer to because of the shortness of time. Even before there were Jews, even before there were Jews, we see the elect of God riding in on the waves of humanity and cresting everyone. Does that phrase sound familiar? There will be trials. There will be all kinds of things that will happen to you in your lifetime to try to take you down. &gt;&gt; And you may crest a wave and you may go down with the wave, &gt;&gt; but you are a spiritual Jew and you will bob back up &gt;&gt; and you'll crest the next wave &gt;&gt; and you might just be riding the wave of humanity. If the country prospers, you may prosper. If the country goes into a decline, you will go into a decline. If the country goes bankrupt, you possibly go bankrupt with it. We don't know and we don't care. &gt;&gt; It's all in God's hands. But one thing is certain, we will bob back up &gt;&gt; out of the bottom end of it. &gt;&gt; Before there was a Jew, there was a Noah. who would be used as a time and Noah was at a time when they planted and they builded and they married and they were given and marry and they lived in hilarity and they had a great time. It was more than the roaring 20s. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it was a society and a civilization far advanced over ours. &gt;&gt; We can't build pyramids. They did. We don't know how to embomb people to last thousands of years, but they did. We don't know how to have ink and color uh that will last for thousands of years, but they did. He said it was a civilization far beyond ours, Noah's time, and that civilization sunk. &gt;&gt; And he rode in an ark on top of that sinking. He was part of that sinking, but he bugged back up. and he washed onto the shores of a new world &gt;&gt; until the Lord Jesus himself would say, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in this time." &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you and announcing to you, this generation is sinking, &gt;&gt; but we will bob back up. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; When we see this immorality, don't you assign your young people or your children to it or your families. We shall overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not just Martin Luther's song. That's our song. &gt;&gt; We shall overcome. &gt;&gt; And to them that overcame, says it, to all the church ages. Seven church ages. To them that overcame. to them that overcame and in Leo Deceia there's a people that overcome and I say to you on a public declaration by God's grace I am in that number and you want to say I am in that number and if you can't say that where are you are you going down in this in the in the dash and ashes of this civilization young people young men young ladies think about it think about it. &gt;&gt; Where are you going? &gt;&gt; Where are you headed? &gt;&gt; You want to turn it around today? &gt;&gt; While the minister is speaking, &gt;&gt; I don't care who's speaking behind the pulpit. We're coming into some meetings, but don't wait for those meetings. I'm speaking today by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Directed right to you. &gt;&gt; Noah wasn't a Jew, but he was an elect of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There were no Jews yet. &gt;&gt; There were no Hebrews yet, but he was an elect of God. &gt;&gt; You may not be born a Jew, but we are an elect of God. &gt;&gt; Placed here in this time, at such a season as this. &gt;&gt; Oh my people, &gt;&gt; listen closely to these words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Noah found grace &gt;&gt; in the sight of God in the eyes of the Lord. And when Jesus Christ, the son of man, whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Colossians 2:9, &gt;&gt; he spake of this time that you and I are in. &gt;&gt; He spake of this hour. And he said as it was in the days of Noah and this is what he lived in. They eat and they drank. &gt;&gt; We are living in that time. &gt;&gt; Go to any restaurant. Go to any place. We walked out of one yesterday. &gt;&gt; This is too vile. &gt;&gt; These girls are too unclean. &gt;&gt; They're just too naked. &gt;&gt; And we resist it. &gt;&gt; And my wife says, "This makes me sick." I said, "We'll leave here." &gt;&gt; And we told the girls, "Forget the reservation. and we're walking out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's this nation. That's not one place. That's every place. &gt;&gt; You have to look for a place that has any wholesome wholesomeness to it &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. He said, "What kind of a world were they having?" speaking of Noah's time, eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage, all kinds of different things just as they're doing now. &gt;&gt; He said they had a civilization even was greater than what we've got now. &gt;&gt; You know something, folks? You've heard me say this before and it's kind of humorous perhaps, but really it's not humorous. I don't have a coin in my pocket, but you if you have any coins in your pocket, I guarantee you they're just pot metal. &gt;&gt; Worthless pot metal. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I could take you home and at least I had enough cents to save some silver ones. Silver. 99.99% silver. That's what we had. We didn't realize it. We didn't think it was anything. We just had silver and the dollar was worth something and the coin was worth something and but today it's it's all Canada's just done away with their pennies cuz it cost them 2 point some cents to make a penny and the penny isn't even got any copper in it. &gt;&gt; They used to call them coppers. They're not coppers. This is some pot metal. And so they quit making them &gt;&gt; here a few days ago. Anyway, but he says, "But in the midst," he said, "they produced the pyramid and they built this and the sphinx and the mummies and the Egyptian mummies and the embalming and all of these things and in the great coming revival and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost message." He spoke. He said, "I see the signs of destruction hanging everywhere." says, "We're in the midst of it all." &gt;&gt; And this great civilization we have here is what he said. This great civilization we have here, &gt;&gt; I see the destruction hanging everywhere. That's &gt;&gt; right. Well, if Noah rode the waves of destruction and judgment coming onto the shores of a new world, Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Noah." And that'll be as it was in the days of the revealing of the son of man. I so I just say to you, not in not to be harsh or not to be but to be very direct. What has the revealing of the son of man done to you? &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. The revealing of him is the difference between washing on the shores of a new world or or perishing in the judgment of the old. &gt;&gt; Take your choice. &gt;&gt; That is the choice. There is no other choice. It has nothing to do with going to church. &gt;&gt; Going to church is only feeding that that life that you have received. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the scripture tells us the disciple preaching, the apostle preaching in Acts, you are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. The Jew has blessed all the kindreds of the world. He said, "Art, art thou art not thou our God?" This is in Chronicles. "Who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest to the seed of Abraham thy friend?" And Isaiah said, "But thou, Israel, art my covenant." Jacob whom I have chosen, a seed of Abraham, my friend. Although they were his children and the friend of God, they went into terrible bondage. They went into terrible uh calamities and catastrophes and they were they were at the time of the Inquisition and they'd been slaughtered and in the time of Esther and Mori the whole nation was to be everybody in the nation was to take up arm and kill the Jews in one day. &gt;&gt; Mark that day and Hmon went his way and Mori and Esther went their way and they were victorious. But yet God did allow them to suffer incredible things. Daniel, I'm just taking a moment here because I'm skipping quite a bit. Daniel was a Jewish captive in Babylon. And he interprets the king Nebuchadnezzar's dream. It was a head of gold and a breast and arms of silver and a belly and thighs of brass and legs of iron with feet of iron and clay. Don't look lost in history. You're in the iron and clay. &gt;&gt; Daniel was in the head of gold and you're in the toes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God declared it. Daniel a prophet spoke it, interpreted it. And we have to recognize where we are. But as he was called to be there at such a time as that, Esther and Mori at such a time as that, I'm saying thus sayith the Lord. You're here for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The truth. &gt;&gt; God has not made a mistake bringing you here. And your heart needs to be stirred. Your soul needs to be moved. And you need to have a confession out of your mouth. I am here by design. I am here by the design of the almighty God. And I will not let conditions of this world, I will not let the influence of the world, I won't let anything adulterate that design and that that desire that I have. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Young people, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it till you believe it. Daniel lived during the reign of the head of gold and he saw all the civilizations of the gentile world. &gt;&gt; These were not Jewish world. This was a Jewish civilizations. These were gentile civilizations which Max Diamont the historian which I just quoted from a wee bit. He he gave he gave a history of those civilizations and their demise and washed out and none of them came back. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another person by the name of William Brandham who spoke on these great denominations and once they denominated they died he said and they never come back. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes. &gt;&gt; And this prophet &gt;&gt; saw thousands of visions. &gt;&gt; Thousands of visions. &gt;&gt; Not one of them failed. &gt;&gt; And he saw a vision of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he saw them in their dress. He saw them how they were clothed. He saw their hair. He looked in their eyes. And they were looking at him as they passed by. Why? because he was the messenger who brought them the voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. He was the source of that word. &gt;&gt; He was the instrument that spoke that word. &gt;&gt; And as they passed by, they looked at him. And then they went off the scene and he sees another group. And the voice says to him, "Now you'll see the church." And he left and sees the church coming. Oh, he said it was so so disheartening. He said his heart wept. &gt;&gt; And he said they were barely clothed. Probably about what we saw in a restaurant yesterday. &gt;&gt; And I don't have themselves covered. &gt;&gt; And he said they had something like this like almost like a a a newspaper type of skirt and and naked. And I won't describe it. And he said he couldn't describe it over the pullpit. I won't try to describe it. &gt;&gt; It made him sick at heart. &gt;&gt; He wept. Oh God, is this what we have produced? &gt;&gt; After all of his preaching, is this what we've produced? &gt;&gt; And they passed by. And he says, "Furthermore, they as they heard a ter awful sound as they went down and down and he heard the sound of this place." Friends, [Music] &gt;&gt; you do not want to go there. &gt;&gt; That's why I say with all the strength that's in me, this cannot merely be a church. We're not here just with a few revived doctrines brought by a great man man of God called William Brandom. We He had to be an instrument of the almighty God who spoke his own thoughts through that vessel. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to say amen to that? Yes, sir. and he saw the church come by and it was such a such a disheartening. He saw it friends. &gt;&gt; This is as clear a vision as any other vision. &gt;&gt; And the people went by and went down and he was in that state his head and he was like feeling ashamed and he said, "You'll see the bride again." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was a phrase that blessed my soul yesterday. He said, "The bride came back." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She didn't go down with the other crew. &gt;&gt; They went down down into the abyss of darkness like the civilizations they lived in. &gt;&gt; They lived in the glamour and the glory of those civilizations. this civilization of nothing but entertainment and Hollywood and fashion and beauty and all of this nonsense. It's going down into the ashes of hell itself. &gt;&gt; But the bride came back. Oh God. Oh God. Let me be in that number. Let me be in that number. Don't ever forget this. Whatever you do after this service, if you miss it, you'll not be able to blame me. It'll be your own blood on your own hands. Whatever you do, don't miss that. &gt;&gt; The bride came back. Noah came back. &gt;&gt; Moses was a headed for the Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; He would have been a Pharaoh of the land. Being the daughter of of Pharaoh's sister, he was headed for the throne. He was headed for a throne, not the presidency of the United States, absolute monarchy, &gt;&gt; of the greatest superpower of the earth, &gt;&gt; that had many of the things we can't even think of making. &gt;&gt; We haven't got the intelligence. Are you listening to me, folks? You think America's great, Canada's great, it isn't even in the It's not even peanuts &gt;&gt; compared to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Egypt truly was a great Egypt isn't what Egypt is today. Egypt was a very great nation. &gt;&gt; Control a big part of the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, they had magicians that could do all kinds of things. Make rods go into snakes. &gt;&gt; How? I don't know. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they did. They did all kinds of things and they had wisdom and wise men of those times. We're not even in that class. Don't even think of it. It's a plastic tin generation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This a pot metal age. &gt;&gt; There's nothing genuine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the clothes you wear some if it wasn't for some chemicals to put together to put the thread together. Perhaps hardly any of us wearing a true linen. &gt;&gt; And the linen of Egypt, I even read where the linen of Egypt was of greater value than an ounce of gold. &gt;&gt; It was such beautiful cloth. And I have seen some of it. I've seen the our people and the and the clothing and the flowing of those garments. We don't have nothing like that. The stuff you have in the malls is just junk. &gt;&gt; Absolute garbage. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, but I'm letting it all out today. This civilization is headed for a demise and we're in the midst of it. But the believers of this message are going to bob back up. I can declare that to you because a prophet who I believe in saw that happen &gt;&gt; and because he saw it I say I want to be in that number. I got my eyes on that group of people. [Applause] Moses, one of the Hebrews, went from the throne to a sheep herder. Went from the royal robes to the stinking robes of you got to be willing to do it all. We've been looking back over a few years of this church. You're sitting on nice pews. I was the president of a company. But I felt that God was sweeping amongst the young people. &gt;&gt; And they're searching for reality. And I knew in my heart that I had that reality. I knew I had what they were searching for. &gt;&gt; What they were taking drugs for. Their drugs didn't bother me. They're they're trying to find some reality or trying to escape what the world said was reality. And I don't blame them for that. &gt;&gt; People drink themselves into oblivion. They're trying to escape the world that they're in. And you can't really blame them for that. &gt;&gt; But there is a reality. &gt;&gt; There is something that's true. Yes, &gt;&gt; you're sitting on nice seats. But this man you see standing here and a few others in this congregation walked into a house which you'll see uh next Sunday. Just a quick shots of it and sat on rough unplained planks, just planks sitting on blocks of wood. Why is that all you could afford? No, but that's what we had to put together. Cuz the young people wanted to come in &gt;&gt; and they did. And God's spirit, we didn't have to go out and invite them that God's spirit moved on them. &gt;&gt; One of them was so drunk when he walked up to the hedge of the house, he collapsed and fell over the hedge. &gt;&gt; About tall as you, David, about 6'5, 6'6. He just fell over the hedge. And he was want to speak to my daughter Marilyn and and and and try and, you know, make her embarrassed over something. And I said, "Invite him to church. invite him to come to the meeting and he didn't want to come. And I said, "You look up into his face and you tell him you're a chicken." That's what I preach to the girls at home. You tell them you're a chicken. If you don't, don't talk to me about, you know, what you're trying to get me to do to take your drugs and stuff. You come to church and if you don't, you're a chicken. &gt;&gt; And so he was standing outside of the house because he felt like he was a chicken. He had to prove he wasn't a chicken. and he fell right over the hedge klunk. That's how drunk he was. That didn't mean nothing to us. He came in and got saved &gt;&gt; and got delivered &gt;&gt; and found really what he was looking for. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Glory to God. This is the same God. &gt;&gt; And I don't care whether it's a hippie movement or some other movement. civilization just waves and waves and waves and then some of the great civilizations and this one is the prophet of God has said it. I believe it and I have seen it witnessed in my own life. It's going down the tube. &gt;&gt; It's going it's in the demise. You young people, you live to see it and someday you'll remember what brother Biscott's preaching to you today. You shall see the demise of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you remember this word and you'll remember what a prophet of God has said. But I'm showing you from the scripture that the believer for the word of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth shall pass away, but my word shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; And if you take that word into the womb of your mind and down into your soul, you shall never pass away. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The civilization may demise, but you shall bob back up. &gt;&gt; Where's Egypt today? &gt;&gt; They just had riots over there. &gt;&gt; Their president had to flee and in his 80s they're they're taking him to court for cruelty to humanity. &gt;&gt; Mubarak. What's it all about? It's total chaos over there. &gt;&gt; So filthy you don't want to go over there. That was a great nation &gt;&gt; at one time. &gt;&gt; A great nation. Where are they? And where's Pharaoh? He went down. &gt;&gt; He's gone into the sands and of oblivion. Where's Moses? He was on Mount Transfiguration. He bought back up. He came back up. Elijah the prophet lived under the most wicked reign, the most wicked president, the most wicked prime minister, whatever you want to call him. The title doesn't mean anything, but he lived under the most wicked of people. &gt;&gt; Ahab. Where's Ahab? I don't know. But Elijah came back. &gt;&gt; Elijah was there with Jesus &gt;&gt; on Mount Transfiguration. He bobbed back up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the prophet of God saw the church world go down. But he saw the bride come back again. Said the bride came back. Oh, hallelujah. The bride came back. &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to hold her down. I don't care what this system around us, what they do. If they even cast us into prison, &gt;&gt; so be it. &gt;&gt; But the bride will come back. &gt;&gt; Destroy this body, Jesus said. Destroy this body. He knew he was going to bob back up. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be disrespectful of the resurrection, but nothing could keep him in that tomb. For he had that word &gt;&gt; that it flesh shall not see corruption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was because he believed that word he raised his own body back up. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You can do that." &gt;&gt; Why? Because we believe a word that is not meant for the grave. &gt;&gt; We have a life that's meant for the sky. [Applause] You think God is going to allow this in flesh to go into a grave &gt;&gt; and sit in the grave? &gt;&gt; Not on your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We weren't meant for the grave. As the songwriter said in the it is well with my soul. The grave is not our goal. The sky. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Daniel saw these civilizations and maybe don't don't lose the inspiration, please. when he lived and saw these in he saw these uh the interpretation he received the interpretation and brother Brandham Gibbs and I have taken time to abbreviate it for you in the Pergamian church age quickly and I'm just going to read little segments please and he says thus by the time the third church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with but with a bitter difference between them. &gt;&gt; One is departed from the truth, married idols, and has no life in her church. &gt;&gt; She is powerful with many members. She is favored by the world and the other is a little persecuted group. Now watch this, please. But she follows the word &gt;&gt; and the signs follow her. &gt;&gt; The sick are healed and the dead are raised. &gt;&gt; She is alive with the life of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And she loves not her life but holds her holds his name and his faith unto the death. &gt;&gt; Those are two groups. Terrible persecution of official Rome fell upon the true believers until Constantine arose and granted freedom of spiritual worship. These were persecuted little group. Now watch a persecuted little group and at even to the risk of death and they were thrown into jungle into jails and into prisons and before animals and finally a leader arises and says you know it's okay I'm going to give you freedom of worship. Constantine had a very different very difficult battle ahead of him. So he was a military man in taking over the control of the empire. So now his desire was to take over the control of the empire. That's why he gave freedom of worship to these people to gain their favor. &gt;&gt; What they thought was a blessing from God &gt;&gt; was actually a trap. &gt;&gt; You have freedom of worship. I don't mean to be nasty, but I will tell you in places where they are under oppression, &gt;&gt; they appreciate being able to get together more than we do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I was so humbled and not long ago, just a few years ago, China has opened up. But when China was real restricted and Sister Tracy knows about that, and they come in, little knock on the door, someone goes and looks through the peepphole, opens the door, and a couple people walk in. They sit down, quiet, knock on the door, go to the door, look at the people. Another one walks in and then finally gathers 20, 30 people. And when they come in, they have to go over to a closet and they take out the chairs, little plastic children's chairs, little ones like this. And and because they're stacked because they can put them away quickly. I see Sister Tracy nodding her head. That's exactly right. And take those chairs out and set those chairs like that and then they sit on those little chairs like this and look up at you. I can see some of them are in business suits. The day we were arrested, the woman that was right in front of me who wanted didn't service the next night and asked if I would speak on the rapture. The policeman that arrested me months later wrote and said the reason he was so disheartened at having to go in and do that arrest said because his grandmother and this took him months to get out. His grandmother took him to a house meeting when he was a boy 8 years old and he said they were such nice people and they called each other brother and sister and their leader was a very kind man. He just put it in his words, not religious words, but his words. And he says, "And when I came into the room, about 25 police with the cameras and everything. And when I came into the room, he says, "The lady right in front of you was my son's kindergarten teacher." And there was a teacher. You sisters here are teachers. You brothers are teachers. and they're sitting on a little plastic stool listening to words they had not heard before. They're mouth so eager. Would you speak on the rapture tomorrow night? Please stay over one more night. I don't hear that here. Do you know why? We got freedom. We know we're going to have a service next Wednesday. We're going to have a service tonight. Brother Tom's going to preach. Brother John's going to preach. That's a trap. &gt;&gt; That doesn't do us any good. &gt;&gt; What does the prophet spoke of? Rugged. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't care. Rugged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the expense, I'll believe here. I'll be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll be here tonight because of rugged. &gt;&gt; This lacks of days called an easy thing. easy life to say what's a great life I came here to announce to you this great life &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that you're so you're so attached to &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; is going down in death &gt;&gt; what can we do well I I would say it it's not enough to talk about the negative side what can we do positively I would say the positive thing is number one give yourself unreservedly &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God and yield yourself unreservedly and say Father, let thy will be achieved in my life. &gt;&gt; Don't slide along with this age. [Music] I trust. I pray. I have daily examined my life daily. Do you know why? I want him to be pleased. I want somehow him to be pleased. Once in a while I get to go hunting and when I go through the woods or ride the quad, I ride my quad. You think, "Oh, that's so much fun. You just ride your quad." I ride that quad. I just let it putt putt along. I say, "Father, all I really want to know, I just want to know if you're pleased. I want to know if what I'm doing is pleasing to you. &gt;&gt; If I see something, that's fine. If I don't, that's fine. I'm just out there. I want to talk to him &gt;&gt; that made all of that. &gt;&gt; I want to feel connected. I want to know he's hearing me. &gt;&gt; Is my life pleasing to you? If you can't do anything further, you can do that. &gt;&gt; That's in everybody's reach. &gt;&gt; It's in everybody's reach. That's in your boy's reach. Father, is my life pleasing to you? I want to be in that number. &gt;&gt; I want to be in that group. &gt;&gt; And I want to still be looking at that messenger that that source where that word came from. I want to be saying it as he said it. &gt;&gt; I want to be be believing it as he believed it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just close. So, here's these two churches. Here's these two groups. Here's one, the persecuted little group. And I thought I would just throw in that what really is liberty and what is not. And he says one night in a dream, and brother Brown talks about this often, one night in a dream, he sees a white cross appear before him. And he felt that this was an omen unto him that if the Christians prayed for victory for him, he would win the battle. He promised freedom for them in the event that he was victorious. He was victorious and the freedom of worship was granted. The whole thing is the wrong it's the wrong basis. &gt;&gt; He wanted to win a victory. He got the people to pray. They won the victory and the people got freedom. And you had brother brother Timothy Maw here the other day and when he referred to freedom he said evil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mentioned it here. I'll just mention it again. I was living and I saw the paper and I read the article when President Krushche, the one who hammered his shoe down, what the prophet spoke about, hammered his shoe down at the United Nations and brother Brown made a significance out of that and the president of America wanted to take him why why would they take him to a can can dance where all the can can ladies are dancing and swinging. their naked legs way up in the air. Oh, this a land of America is a land of freedom. Look where freedom took them. &gt;&gt; And a godless which prophet said a godless nation whose god was science had to chastise and rebuke &gt;&gt; the head the leader of the land of freedom &gt;&gt; because freedom took him to corruption &gt;&gt; and to immorality and into death. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; That just happens to be the way it is. And the scripture says, your Bible, if you care to look at it, your Bible says, "It shall wax worse and &gt;&gt; worse." &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Worse. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. It shall wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're coming to 40th year. And I'm sure Brother Ken Ardel won't mind me saying this. just after he gave his life to Christ. And he was the organist, organ player across the street at the United Church. And my neighbor, the woman, the house of my neighbor where I was living was the choir leader. And I'm not using any names other than Brother Ken's. And she was an alcoholic. And on Sunday morning, he would come hung over from doing what he did the night before and maybe some dope and drugs or whatever more. Maybe nothing heavy. I don't know. And she was there with a hangover from alcoholism. And the organist is hangover from his party and the choir leader and they're singing. He's supposed to be singing worship to God. And Ken's father was dean of men at the at the church. So now I'm just relating a few early days that you won't get during the meetings. So his mother and dad came over to see me and they were troubled and they'd seen and read perhaps a little bit of the books that he had, message books, and they're very troubled because he's going to quit his education. He was heading to be a school teacher or something and he's going to quit university. He's in his second year and he's going to quit university. and it's kind of it's it's my fault and it's the message fault or whoever whatever this thing is and I said well you know you're talking to the wrong person really has nothing to do with me and I began to speak of the conditions of the world and they were getting worse and worse and God bless brother Kent has a wonderful mother wonderful mother even though his father's passed away at I think 57 years old and she has lived uh uh alone and has lived a very honorable life and she's a wonderful woman. I want to say that and she said in all sincerity because that's what she's probably told. And I said as the world is getting worse and worse and she says oh I don't think so. Oh really? I said what do you think is happening? She said I think it's getting better and better. Well I I couldn't go any further. There's the end of the road. Anyway, Ken held on to his direction and they rem remained so loyal and years later that church took the blood every song of the blood of Jesus Christ and cleansed it out of their system and don't have a song about the blood. And when Linda was witnessing to him and he was trying to, you know, he was verbally much sharper than she was and was trying to debate with her about spiritual things and she just couldn't say anything anymore. She says, "Well, you need to be washed in the blood." Washed in the blood. You know how gross that sounds to some people? Washed in the blood. And that was the end of their conversation. Next thing he knew, he came to a service and the Holy Spirit, this same Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; this same God, &gt;&gt; this same Christ, &gt;&gt; begin to deal with him. And that night, he was changed and transformed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I think if you were to talk to him, you'd find out the very church he walked out of has gone down is going down that very slope that the prophet, his prophet saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful, brother Ken, you headed a different direction &gt;&gt; when that church is long gone. These denominations are long gone in the seven church ages. And what happened? What happened with civilization? As I'm closing now, what happened in civilizations is exactly what happened with the believer. There was a small elect group. They believed Martin. Small elect group believed Wesley. Small elect group believed Luther. And when they denominated and died and went down and never rose again on him, the next move of God, the next revival, here they were. The spiritual Jews bobbed up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Through all the seven church ages. And here you are. You're not just members of Cloverdale. By the way, that doesn't mean anything. Spiritual Jews, &gt;&gt; born of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ordained to bob up again. Moses came back. Elijah came back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After all the civilizations, the Jews kept bobbing up. And here we are. &gt;&gt; Here we are. And I want to close this service by saying you on the authority of God's word. God has ordained that you should come to the kingdom for such a time as this. God has a God has a a job description for you. God has a place for you to fill. And whatever you do, you say, "Father, thy will be done." [Applause] &gt;&gt; I can talk about some very people who feel very insignificant. What's the name of the woman that washed his feet and anointed his head with oil? &gt;&gt; What's her name? You don't know her name. She's not named in the Bible. But her act was &gt;&gt; her act is written in the Bible. We don't have to be notifi we don't have to be noted and we don't have to be recognized and we don't have to become highly visible. God knows who we are. &gt;&gt; We just do what we I I can tell you a faithful a faithful sister in Christ, a faithful mother in Christ, you'll receive award. We don't receive rewards for what we achieve. We receive rewards for being faithful. And a woman that's faithful at home will receive the same reward as far as I'm concerned as a man and stand behind a pulpit. If she's faithful in her call and God called her to be here, called her to be a mother, called her to be a wife, whatever it was, called you to be young people. I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ, you pick up the sword. You pick up this desire that you have in your heart and live it. Live it for everything that's within you. Hallelujah. Here's what he said. He saw this group and I close with this. Her eyes She was the cleanest and sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life. She passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes up watching as she passed by said she was so beautiful. I looked at her and as she passed by, he said, "Now we shall review the churches." And when they come up, each one looked like they got worse. That's what the That's what the civilization you're living in right now &gt;&gt; gets worse. &gt;&gt; In my lifetime, it's got worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's more worse. There's more struggles. There's more war. There's more road raids. There's more uh violence. &gt;&gt; True. Is a very wicked age &gt;&gt; we live in. And only the blood of Calvary &gt;&gt; can keep you. And hold the Holy Spirit can hold you &gt;&gt; in this day &gt;&gt; because Satan has successfully infiltrated every segment of your society to infiltrate your mind. Right. &gt;&gt; And you'll not be successful on your own power to keep it out. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you have confidence in the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Have confidence in him, friends. &gt;&gt; You may be burdened this morning. Have confidence in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now we'll review the churches. And when they come up, each one looked like they got worse. I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life. And all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here. But he said the top was just had a strap, just about a a little about a half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this. Absolutely nothing but looked like street prostitutes. And they were singing this here. twist and roll songs and you know every what you call it going down singing. Do you understand what he saying? They were singing while they were going down. &gt;&gt; They're oblivious. &gt;&gt; Tell me a church. Show me a church. Friends, this is I know a very serious service. Show me a church that doesn't think they're going to heaven &gt;&gt; and they're actually singing while they're going down. &gt;&gt; You need to read the read the vision yourself and let it speak to you like I do. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And it's going down and it kind of twisting. And he says, "And he asked, is that the church?" And I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and they went off to the left and disappeared into chaos, still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies. One side, I don't even know how they do it. I don't know whether where it came from, but whether it's And I'm I'm not timed that way. And I'm kind of glad I'm not timed that way, but perhaps some are. I see these little kids, just little kid like that, and they're just walking down the street, and they go, &gt;&gt; that spirit's already on them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And do they think that's wrong? No. No. And there there's mother and dad, and they're just oblivious to it, &gt;&gt; and they'll get right up in the service. And this now the prophet saw this right in church. &gt;&gt; You know what's happening over in Christian life assembly? Langley's Got Talent. That production with celebrities and everything is happening in Langley in LCA or CLA Christian Life Assembly in Langley while you're sitting here in the next few days. Langley's Got Talent in a Pentecostal church. Right. &gt;&gt; I say wake up. &gt;&gt; Don't let sleep and heaviness of eyelids &gt;&gt; come upon us in this day. &gt;&gt; It's happening down the street. &gt;&gt; It's happening next to your home. &gt;&gt; It's happening in your shopping center. &gt;&gt; Where you buy clothes. And don't ever forget that the people that designed those fashions &gt;&gt; are the most possessed you could ever ever imagine. I've seen them at their tables working in Los Angeles. It is unbelievable. I couldn't get out fast enough. And he says, "And I started to bow my head and he said, "Wait, the bride must come again." &gt;&gt; And I looked and here they come again. &gt;&gt; And they passed by. Let me tell you friends, these are people who've even gone to the dust and the ashes of the earth. &gt;&gt; These are people who've been buried in concrete boxes. &gt;&gt; These are all kinds of people. These are people who lived in the midst of sin and immorality. &gt;&gt; And one day while they're walking down the street or walking wherever they were walking, but they had the word of God, they wear the word in flesh. &gt;&gt; And that word transformed them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word took control of the atoms of their body. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I feel such a surge of it. I just It almost seems like it happened at this moment. It just is in a moment. In a twinkling of an eye, they're transformed and start their upward movement. Friends, this isn't just a Sunday school picnic. I'm preaching wholesome word of God to you today. And if you reject this, &gt;&gt; you're rejecting God's invitation. &gt;&gt; It's that plain and that simple. &gt;&gt; And we all ought to say amen as believers. &gt;&gt; I say that's my kind of preaching. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart and soul. &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. And it says, "And the church came into view once each nation, the church, but the bride came in twice &gt;&gt; and then I and the seed fell in the ground at Na." That was the original seed. And she came and she's come through the process of these denominations. I rode the wave of the denominations. I was born in the Catholic or the great Catholic church. I was glad I only wrote it for about three or four years. And God in his grace got my mom and dad. They were born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And even even at four years old, &gt;&gt; I could look on them and I could tell something had happened &gt;&gt; in our home. Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain Calvary or all these things to me. I just knew something happened. &gt;&gt; My mom was a different mom. &gt;&gt; It's still the same. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan Hillbrand. Still the same. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And there isn't one of you young people that looked in the face of your godly mother and father that'll ever have an excuse. &gt;&gt; You'll never have an excuse. That's right. &gt;&gt; Make your choice now. Change it now. Change your direction now. &gt;&gt; I knew something had happened. Then I then then you know then came Pentecost that moved in. Great waves of glory singing new kinds of song and I'm free. I'm free and all of these wonderful things. And oh we so rejoiced in it. And I've seen it go all the way from that. Langley has talent. I joined with a prophet. He's gone. I'm still here. You're still here. &gt;&gt; I tell you, when I hear those things, Brother Tom, Brother John, I hang my head. &gt;&gt; I I want to do better. &gt;&gt; I want to make a greater sound. Give the winds a mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God for every message book, Brother &gt;&gt; Matthew. that's been distributed. And brother brother Solomon from Seattle just sent me a a text. He said, "And with all the list of the churches from Nigeria and from Ghana and from all over Africa that received 86,000 books, they handed them out. Send them over in a container. We don't make a big issue out of it, but it they were stored in India." And brother Kim Dingwall had them sent over there. Some I don't understand how everything happens. I'm just thank God it happens. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we rode the wave of &gt;&gt; I'm talking my own testimony now. Just bear with me. One to two minutes. I riding the wave of Pentecost. And I went down. I started going down. I was going down with it. And it came to nothing. came to finally the place where the word could come right out of a vindicated prophet's mouth and &gt;&gt; they turn it away. &gt;&gt; And even and I I can't say everything I'd like to tell you cuz sometimes these things are happening right around you and you don't know it &gt;&gt; by nice people, &gt;&gt; by good people, &gt;&gt; and they're denying the message you love. And Satan is working in very cunning ways to suggest doubt &gt;&gt; concerning the message. &gt;&gt; Just trying to sew a seed of doubt. &gt;&gt; Name it. It's a demon. &gt;&gt; Congregation ought to say thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've even spoke to them face to face said that's a demon and had good righteous men stand say you say that's a demon. I said does God do that? Do you tell me does the Holy Ghost do what you're engaged in? Does the Holy Ghost do that? &gt;&gt; And I fell silent. Listen folks, you have to come to I'm calling every one of you on the scene because you're going to hear all this again. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't do that trying to So, it's the same. You you don't don't just sit here and think we talk of history. I'm talking about right now, &gt;&gt; right now. Right here. &gt;&gt; And when you hear that little whiff of doubt come in and they're questioning something within the word, you cast it off. You have nothing to do with it. and identify it. It doesn't come from the Holy Ghost. And there's only two powers in the earth. There's only two powers in the earth. One is God and one is Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the sooner that we identify and say that's the enemy, that's the devil. &gt;&gt; And it looses them from you and you're free from it. &gt;&gt; Says it came and I underline this. It came through the process of the denomination. So that was me. &gt;&gt; And Pentecost went down and somewhere at the bottom. I was at the bottom. Not just myself emotionally. The organization was at the bottom. Ministers could tell offcolor jokes and stories and all kinds of things going on. and to even question it or to withstand it. And because of that, I went to two churches. I went to a full gospel Pentecostal church in Vancouver Island in Victoria and left it finally because of the improprieties that were taking place. And I went to an apostolic church. I believed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That God was one God. Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. believe in the infilling the Holy Spirit. When brother Brandham came there, they refused to come. Both of those churches refused to come. That's how low it got. &gt;&gt; But in the midst of that, &gt;&gt; and I'm just giving a testimony now. In the midst of that, friends, the word came by my way. In the midst of that, the word came by my way. Hallelujah. In the midst of that, the resurrection went by. Hallelujah. And I said, that's for me. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to end this service by saying, I bobbed back up. I thank God. I thank God I'm not part of that. I thank God I'm not part of that on the platform. Langley has talent or some other place has talent. I'm glad I'm not part of that mixture of Hollywood church and all this kind of business. I thank God and people want to put it discredit this message. I thank God for this message. I thank God for this word. I thank God for the original seed, the spoken word, the original seed. I thank God for where would we be without it? That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; Father, our hearts, my heart is so filled with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Whether I live or die is immaterial, &gt;&gt; it's irrelevant to me. God would just step over. I want to step into that vision and fulfill the other part of it. I want to walk by, oh God. I want my eyes to be fixed, oh God, on that where that source of that word came from. Lord Jesus, it's all you. It's all you. You're the designer. You're the author of all of this. And we thank you for it. I thank you, Father, for the people that's had grace to listen to me today and unburden my heart. And I just pray that somehow something has been said that will move them. Move them. Oh God, move someone. Oh father, move them in the name of Jesus Christ to making a sound declaration and a decision which will last all of their life. &gt;&gt; And let them not be moved by this uh fickle generation, this time that we're in. Oh God, I haven't got words to even express how empty and is. And the great great wise person Solomon could say it's vanity. Vanity. All is vanity. Give a revelation of that to the people, Father, so we can see we're in the world, but we're not of the world. We're living here. We work. We pay our bills. We have to eat. We have to have strength. We thank you for that. Is any sick among you? You're still the healer, Lord. Heal them in the name of Jesus Christ. Any here not filled with the Holy Ghost, I pray that you shall fill them, Lord. Fill them not in the meetings coming up. Fill them now, Father. Fill them to overflowing. And I can't do it. You do it, Lord. It's something that you do. Help us to sing and worship, Father. And any that may be in the valley of decision, may they make that decision like a true, courageous man or woman. Let them make that decision, Father. They can make it on their own right where they are or kneel at their chair or at their at their bans or kneel here at the altar. Whatever. We're here, oh God, to be the benefit to your people. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, we thank you, Father. Oh, we bless your name, oh God. Could we sing? We bless your name. We bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's lift it up now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Give you honor. &gt;&gt; Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. Let's bless his name together. God bless your name. In prisons change and prisoners change with bleeding stripes. Then Paul and Silus, Paul and Silas, pray that night. And in their pain, began to sing. Their chains were loose. Hallelujah. and they were free. Oh, I bless your name. Bless your name. I bless your name. I give you praise. We want to praise you. [Music] The truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Some midnight hour. If you should, you will find your real present in your life. Reach out and reach out. Reach out.

I give you honor. I give you praise. You look up and just say it to him. Don't even you don't even need the words on the screen for that. Dedicate yourself. And I'm going to have a prayer. And for those of you, I know that God is speaking to some very, very definitely. I want you to say, "This is the hour. This is the time. I'm making my choice. I will see you again. I will see you again. if not here on the other side. And the same prophet said, and if you can't believe me, believe him. He said, we will be sitting with him. [Music] Those that went by and came back again will be sitting with him looking down at others that went the other direction. Don't put me in that place, please. I'd look down, look in the same faces I'm looking at now. Say, "Remember that night? Remember that morning? Remember that day you heard this? You looked down from the balcony. You saw my heart bleeding. You had that opportunity. Don't Don't make that happen. Just make your decision a eternal decision. Now, &gt;&gt; not based on anything emotional, based on a business transaction with God. This scene will repeat again. [Music] And that's what the prophet said and that's what I believe. some midnight hour. [Music] You're in a prison in your mind. Reach out and pray. Defy those who chase. Yes, they will fall in Jesus name. I bless your name. [Music] I bless your name. I give you [Music] praise. the truth. I bless your name. I bless your name. We just bow our heads. I want to thank you for your kindness, for your true Christian spirit, for you faithful, faithful believers. I love you. Our Lord Jesus loves us with an undying love because we love his word. We love his messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We love his message. We love the words. Oh, they're sweeter than honey in the comb. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; You have spoken to our hearts. And there are some I know that you have spoken. We're not being backward or bashful about it. You're speaking very, very deeply. Don't let Don't let anyone you're dealing with depart this place in a state of turmoil, oh God. And don't let the voice of Satan continue to ring in their ears. But may they defy the chains. &gt;&gt; And they shall fall in Jesus' name. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All they have to do is speak with their mouth and confess with their lips, oh God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and claim you as Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; you are Lord. You are Lord. You're Lord of my life. You're Lord of my future. &gt;&gt; And by your grace, I will be in that number your messenger saw. Oh God, let me be one that f fulfills that vision. &gt;&gt; I believe I believe I believe he saw me. I believe he saw me. And the devil's trying to tell me something different and I deny his lie. &gt;&gt; In the holy righteous name of Jesus Christ, liver every doubt, flee. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you. I pray that now Lord as victory comes joy will come &gt;&gt; to the lives of those it only takes a moment &gt;&gt; as a prophet has spoke to people so many times and ask them if they believed and they went from an unbeliever to a believer in a few moments of time &gt;&gt; Jesus do it now in this close of this service I pray you'll do it now &gt;&gt; and prepare us not only for this evening as brother Tom Ray will speak oh God when you have been dealing with him about &gt;&gt; and we want to hear it &gt;&gt; and father we also are preparing ourselves for the services this week &gt;&gt; oh God and we do not want to become encumbered just with the logistics we want to give ourselves body soul and spirit oh holy spirit roll in in a great tidal wave &gt;&gt; upon this congregation without you we're poor we're poppers but with you we are rich we thank you father I I pray you'll dismiss us now with your grace and continue to abide.
