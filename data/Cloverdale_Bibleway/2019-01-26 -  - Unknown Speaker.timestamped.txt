[0:02] just before we turn to the word and
[0:04] carry on with the scripture I thought
[0:07] I'd like to just also mention we we have
[0:12] a look at the website that her brother
[0:15] Robert Wilson has and really amazing
[0:18] what God is providing to especially
[0:22] english-speaking people and I'm maybe
[0:27] I'll just have you have your seats for
[0:28] just a moment and be easier this way we
[0:35] had an unusual thing in fact as I had
[0:37] never if you had told me a few years ago
[0:38] that this is what I was going to
[0:40] experience I would could never have
[0:42] believed that such a thing was going to
[0:47] take place this what happened since the
[0:51] work started in China which is about 12
[0:54] to 15 years ago and then into Vietnam
[0:57] and our whole focus was on India we
[1:00] printed in India for messages untold
[1:04] millions from 1980-81 all through up
[1:10] till just recently and then the messages
[1:14] now have gone onto the Internet and
[1:17] what's called the message hub and it
[1:20] would surprise you there's a 60
[1:23] languages we have 60 languages and it's
[1:28] end and as translators wherever they are
[1:31] in the world they could be in Mongolia
[1:33] they could be another southern tip of
[1:35] South America they could be in the
[1:36] Arctic they could be wherever anywhere
[1:39] on earth
[1:39] that they're translating there just a
[1:42] certain format they have to put it in so
[1:44] the titles write that and the date and
[1:47] so on and so forth and then they can
[1:49] they can just click it like that and
[1:51] that message goes on the internet and
[1:54] can be accessed read printed listen to
[2:00] providing it's got a voiceover at this
[2:03] time and many of them do not but many
[2:06] them do there's now 60 languages on the
[2:10] internet this you
[2:12] just from 2:13 till now in the first
[2:16] part of May there was 1 million 145,000
[2:22] 197 downloads these are not books
[2:26] printed where people just print masses
[2:29] of books and send them out over the
[2:30] country which we did in India and people
[2:35] got books maybe they didn't even want
[2:37] but these are people who want books
[2:38] these are people who print the book they
[2:42] want and the title they want and and so
[2:46] it and this this is a faith challenge
[2:49] report which it just printed I just got
[2:51] it off they pressed from the office just
[2:54] before I came and it speaks about Gandhi
[2:58] and Africa and the center spread is of
[3:03] China and then the next spread is print
[3:07] stations in Mexico and let me let me
[3:10] just you might just be here he say well
[3:12] I'm just over farmer I'm a mechanic this
[3:16] is the brother I've never met that I
[3:19] know of he wrote from Trinidad when he
[3:22] heard about the hub station and on his
[3:26] own salary
[3:27] he bought hub stations the station the
[3:31] printer the whole thing is a printers
[3:33] only about five six hundred dollars its
[3:36] HP you can buy it at any office depot
[3:39] and they're workhorses their duplex
[3:43] printer and he tastes those printers and
[3:46] a computer if he needs to to South
[3:49] America and has put print stations in
[3:52] every country of South America at his
[3:54] own expense and he just goes and he
[3:59] leaves it he eat leaves a here's where
[4:02] we're going and he sends a report back
[4:04] and he says gone to Bolivia in Bolivia
[4:07] met this brother met that brother had a
[4:09] meeting met brother to train them in the
[4:12] hub station and and loaded and
[4:14] downloaded something and then he puts
[4:17] mission accomplished he goes the next
[4:18] place and that's the kind of reporting
[4:21] sense
[4:23] this is what has happened in in China
[4:27] the translators if I could just describe
[4:29] to you how diligent they are and I'm
[4:31] going to be very brief
[4:33] they started translating and they have a
[4:36] Bible that's called the Union Bible of
[4:38] China and that's the one that government
[4:41] allowed them to have and I have to
[4:43] describe something to your friends China
[4:45] was in existence long before America was
[4:48] discovered you understand that as
[4:51] hundreds of millions and the Bible says
[4:53] that the eyes of the Lord go to and fro
[4:56] throughout the whole earth not just
[4:58] North America or America or Canada or
[5:01] Europe to throughout the whole earth and
[5:03] there are people there that are so so
[5:07] intensely it just humbled me to tears to
[5:12] see people that were they were teachers
[5:15] they were professional people they were
[5:18] common people everything you could
[5:20] imagine educated or more educated than
[5:23] any person in this building and I know
[5:25] that some of you are highly educated and
[5:27] they they go into a closet door and
[5:30] bring out little kindergarten plastic
[5:33] chairs because they have to be put away
[5:35] real quick if there's a wrong knock on
[5:37] the door
[5:38] and I know I was there my wife knows she
[5:41] was there and I happen to be there when
[5:44] the police walked in and the rest is
[5:47] history but we were in and we were in
[5:50] prison for some days and that they will
[5:53] if there's a knock on the door and it's
[5:55] a wrong kind of knock and they looked
[5:56] and say the police are here they put
[5:59] scoot all those chairs away and they get
[6:02] around the table have a cake and have a
[6:03] birthday havin they're havin a birthday
[6:05] gathering and there's a cake there and
[6:08] so on so the friends are here around
[6:10] this birthday we couldn't do that
[6:12] because there's about 80 people there
[6:14] and during the arrest but some of these
[6:19] people I will say almost all of them
[6:23] they they print these message books
[6:27] print finer books than we have here they
[6:31] actually said they didn't complain to me
[6:34] they don't complain to anybody they just
[6:35] said
[6:36] these books we're out too fast because
[6:38] they that's they read them and pass them
[6:40] around and they print a book for the
[6:43] sake of giving it out and it's just
[6:45] going like a prairie fire we can't even
[6:47] begin to keep track of it but they
[6:49] laminated beautifully laminated the
[6:52] covers the covers are just beautiful all
[6:55] different and they printed all our own
[6:58] books they don't ask for any help we
[7:00] give them help because we know that they
[7:02] need it but they don't ask for any help
[7:05] they just say we'll do it ourselves and
[7:08] they print the books one little print
[7:10] station itself printed over fifty
[7:13] thousand books they burn out though they
[7:15] burn out their printers and all of us
[7:17] would just replace it and keep on going
[7:19] but while they were doing that while
[7:23] they were translating several
[7:25] translators working under brother Murphy
[7:27] Wong and they would find what the
[7:30] prophet of God and they so believed that
[7:32] prophet of God said this is what he said
[7:35] look in their Bible that's not what our
[7:37] Bible says so they died arised those
[7:40] hours and then they would look there's
[7:42] one scripture first John five and seven
[7:46] for there are three that bear record in
[7:48] heaven the word the father the word and
[7:51] the father the spirit in the word and
[7:53] these three are one that verse isn't
[7:57] even in the Bible that verse which the
[8:00] Prophet emphasizes not even in their
[8:03] Bible at all and and they found so many
[8:08] hours so they they began to die rise
[8:11] those errors unbeknown to me I didn't
[8:13] know it I wasn't aware of it at all and
[8:16] finally a Chinese brother who's a deacon
[8:19] in our church walked into my office and
[8:21] he want to know if he just talked to me
[8:23] a few minutes and he told me how many
[8:25] five hundred million people have cell
[8:29] phones
[8:29] he said the Chinese people have an
[8:31] insatiable this insatiable desire to
[8:34] just read in their reading walking down
[8:37] the street and reading some have two
[8:38] phones and they're just reading and he
[8:41] says we are going to make a Bible reader
[8:43] and a message reader so they can read
[8:46] the Bible and the message on a reader
[8:49] similar to what brother Wilson was
[8:52] saying today I didn't see that the but I
[8:57] heard a little bit of it and and and and
[9:01] then what they did was he said we are
[9:07] we're going to translate the Bible just
[9:11] floored me I said translate the Bible
[9:13] that's an enormous enormous task why
[9:16] you're going to translate the Bible they
[9:18] haven't in Chinese no he said we haven't
[9:21] he got that we got to King James but
[9:23] it's a it's a uni Bible they call it a
[9:25] uni Bible and it's not accurate
[9:28] in fact it's fundamental Christians real
[9:30] fundamental solid Christians in Hong
[9:32] Kong did the Old Testament and he says
[9:35] they've offered it to us just free just
[9:38] take it have it and he says we're doing
[9:40] the entire New Testament and he said
[9:42] we'll be done by April that was a year
[9:45] ago April and that's how far they were
[9:48] along then they discovered there were so
[9:51] many hours in what these people had done
[9:53] even though they had improved it they
[9:55] did thirty thousand corrections in the
[10:00] Old Testament and so he said we're
[10:03] having to do it again and he said all I
[10:05] can tell you is that the Uni Bible is
[10:07] nothing more than a reference book
[10:10] believers discovered listen believers
[10:14] believers discovered the errors
[10:17] believers are translating the entire
[10:20] Bible from Genesis to Revelation it's
[10:23] just rate of the doing a proofreading
[10:25] right now in our office and believers
[10:29] are going to make this Bible available
[10:31] to the entire world Chinese population
[10:36] on the internet free it's going to be
[10:39] printed as a Bible and and also almost
[10:43] identical to what brother Wilson has
[10:46] this the search engine has already been
[10:50] finished and completed and the search
[10:52] engine will not only work in Chinese
[10:54] it'll work in any language but as a
[10:57] person is reading the Bible just catch
[10:59] this as they're reading the Bible
[11:02] and they say little I can't like to know
[11:04] what does this scripture mean they just
[11:06] touch that icon takes them right to the
[11:09] message hub and has the Prophet
[11:11] interpret that scripture for them how do
[11:15] you like that that is well thought out
[11:18] we don't even have that ourselves as yet
[11:22] and takes them right and then gives them
[11:26] a list of all all the messages that
[11:29] brother branham refer to that scripture
[11:32] and I thought that was quite remarkable
[11:34] they're just finishing just finishing it
[11:37] now we don't even have that how many
[11:43] remember the old books that brother
[11:47] David mama was dead
[11:50] absolutely and that's the one I meant
[11:52] mention to your brother brother Robert
[11:55] that he did all of that work and it's
[11:59] been resurrected now because that's
[12:01] exactly what they needed to do and so
[12:04] they don't have to do it that's
[12:06] wonderful
[12:07] amen are we rejoicing the Bible says
[12:11] that even the angels of God rejoice over
[12:14] one soul isn't that what he said so
[12:17] we're so thankful for wherever they are
[12:19] whether it be in America or Europe or
[12:21] Canada or or over in Asia someplace
[12:24] we're just so thankful for it god bless
[12:26] you thank you for inviting us thank you
[12:30] for coming if you didn't come we
[12:33] wouldn't have much of a service and
[12:35] thank you for accept my apologies for
[12:40] the long service this morning and we we
[12:43] kind of put a lot in there and this
[12:46] evening might be a bit of a little
[12:49] strange but at the end of this service
[12:51] today I'm going to give a part of my
[12:55] testimony and to to maybe correct some
[13:01] things that have been improperly or
[13:04] wrongly propagated even on the internet
[13:08] and it's not accurate and the reason I
[13:11] can correct it is because I was there
[13:16] you know what song I was there when it
[13:18] happened and I guess I ought to know
[13:21] Alleluia all right why don't you stand
[13:24] to your feet and we're going to just
[13:26] look to the Lord and then we're going to
[13:27] read a scripture and move along real
[13:29] quickly let's bow our heads father hell
[13:33] we thank you for the kind warm
[13:38] attention of the people thank you for
[13:41] the reception that we've been given and
[13:43] once again I pray that you will touch
[13:46] our precious brother IV Lord what a
[13:49] responsibility the pastor and in their
[13:52] condition you know exactly how to touch
[13:55] that nerve and how to heal it and to
[13:58] remove the pain I pray father in the
[14:02] name of Jesus you said whatsoever we ask
[14:04] that we should expect it that it will
[14:07] take place and so I believe that that is
[14:10] exactly what will take place just touch
[14:12] our brother father in a supernatural way
[14:15] and by whatever means you choose we just
[14:18] ask that you will do it and do a
[14:21] marvelous healing and for everyone that
[14:23] is here tonight Lord I pray that you
[14:26] will send a special portion and let us
[14:29] as we hunger after you and we do hunger
[14:32] after you God be glorified in Jesus
[14:36] Christ's name Amen amen
[14:40] I'll have you turn with me to the Book
[14:42] of Isaiah the 14th chapter this morning
[14:49] you recall I stressed the point that for
[14:55] the Brenham made he said in the back
[14:58] part of God's mind remember that I said
[15:02] the Prophet you know whether it's Future
[15:05] past or present it's irrelevant because
[15:07] God is timeless now we're going to read
[15:10] in Isaiah where the Prophet speaks about
[15:14] how are the fallen
[15:16] Lucifer how would their fallen from
[15:18] heaven how did he know he was fallen
[15:20] from heaven he's way back into the
[15:23] eternity someplace and then John John in
[15:26] the revelation he
[15:27] Pence's that he goes forward and he sees
[15:30] them thrown into cast into the lake of
[15:32] fire so I mean you know with God we have
[15:35] to understand the kind of God do we have
[15:37] there isn't he marvelous praise be to
[15:40] God so in the 14th chapter we'll just
[15:43] read in the 12th verse how art thou
[15:46] fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the
[15:50] morning how art thou cut down to the
[15:53] ground which didst weaken the nation's
[15:55] for thou hast said in thine heart I will
[15:58] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[16:01] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[16:04] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[16:06] in the sides of the north I will ascend
[16:09] above the heights of the clouds I will
[16:12] be like the Most High yet thou shalt be
[16:16] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[16:19] pit and they that see thee shall
[16:21] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[16:24] thee saying is this the man that made
[16:26] the earth to tremble that did shake
[16:29] kingdoms you may be seated
[16:39] it's very very different I have never
[16:41] only spoke this at my church one other
[16:45] place and it's very very recent from
[16:48] last month but I want to speak to you on
[16:51] the evolution of Lucifer think about a
[16:56] moment and a subject the characteristics
[17:02] of Lucifer brother branham speaks in one
[17:07] place he talks about the evolution of
[17:09] the spirit and the the way that the Holy
[17:14] Spirit has worked from age to age in
[17:17] time to time but now I want to just draw
[17:20] your attention to the evolution of
[17:23] Lucifer because what what the Prophet is
[17:27] said not once but many times he said we
[17:31] need to know our enemy and I want to ask
[17:36] you as a congregation do you know your
[17:39] enemy you know him well the Prophet said
[17:44] we need to study his moves study how he
[17:47] did things and study how he he said even
[17:51] a boxer will stand back as brother
[17:54] Branham was a boxer and stand back and
[17:57] study the other boxers licks he called
[17:59] it on how he moved wise so he doesn't
[18:02] get hit so he doesn't get it doesn't get
[18:05] pounded by that and I think we as
[18:07] believers we sometimes have suffered
[18:10] some real hard knocks and we didn't need
[18:14] to we need to study him and say ah
[18:17] that's that's that's him in fact is in
[18:23] counseling we have counsel I've
[18:25] counseled with many many people in my
[18:28] ministry but and and you might be here
[18:31] this might just be for someone I didn't
[18:32] intend to say this but I have counseled
[18:36] and a person will be well in the medical
[18:41] world they would say their manic
[18:42] depressant but that's not in the Bible
[18:45] that spirit of depression is just
[18:47] nothing but the devil you say well that
[18:50] may be simplistic
[18:51] over-simplistic no I think your
[18:54] overcomplicated if a person wants to
[18:57] take some brother Brent says you call a
[18:59] cancer it's a devil and I would say we
[19:03] need to heed him and he starts talking
[19:06] way back in the 50s hello how a cell
[19:08] becomes wounded and then it and then it
[19:10] attaches and fastens itself and then the
[19:13] enemy takes ahold of it then and he said
[19:16] it is a devil and for someone who had
[19:19] such success as he had at casting that
[19:22] demon spirit out and the cancer dying I
[19:25] tell you what friends that's the message
[19:28] I want to listen to and so now there
[19:33] have been these that have been they said
[19:35] well they're just I'm I'm depressed and
[19:38] there may be somebody here goes through
[19:40] this and fights that I fight depression
[19:42] uh-huh and and I can tell you what
[19:45] happens and I just tell these people
[19:47] without knowing with necessarily knowing
[19:50] their individual situation I said you
[19:53] get up up a morning and maybe things
[19:55] don't go just exactly right but you you
[19:58] begin to feel just a heaviness just a
[20:00] cloud you just feel dark and heavy the
[20:04] other said we do I do I said that is
[20:08] that demon spirit that's the presence of
[20:11] that one and now he's an opportunist and
[20:14] he'll just wait till this goes wrong and
[20:16] that goes wrong and you just go deeper
[20:19] and deeper and deeper and soon he's got
[20:21] control of your thoughts in your mind
[20:23] and you just go into pits of depression
[20:25] as soon as you feel that heavy like you
[20:30] need to turn around and say I know you
[20:33] I've experienced that before and you've
[20:37] made my life miserable and now I'm
[20:39] identifying you and I am naming you guys
[20:43] where Jesus said what's your name
[20:45] you might as well know that's a mortal
[20:48] enemy and God is here to give you an
[20:51] absolute victory and if you've ever been
[20:54] bothered with that and that fits of
[20:56] depression and whatever more shake it
[20:58] off
[21:00] hallelujah I mean business friends I'm
[21:03] not here I'm not here to just exercise
[21:06] myself but I mean business
[21:08] shake that thing off say well I've had
[21:10] it for years that doesn't mean anything
[21:12] just shake it off be rid of it
[21:15] refuse it what does the Bible say what
[21:18] does your Bible say my Bible says rebuke
[21:20] the devil or resist the devil and he
[21:24] will flee from you is that what it says
[21:28] we ought to rejoice I'm going to take
[21:34] this subject from Lucifer to the serpent
[21:40] from the serpent to Satan and from Satan
[21:45] to the devil and from the devil to the
[21:49] dragon now we may think of oh the dragon
[21:52] some fear saying flaming fire out of its
[21:56] mouth no no no no the Greek word for
[21:59] dragon is a fabulous animal fabulous
[22:03] animal the Bible says Howard though
[22:07] fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the
[22:10] morning Sun of the morning and the
[22:14] Hebrew word is dawn as soon as I read
[22:19] that and heard that dawn and the Prophet
[22:24] said now the message is the key and
[22:27] you're gonna have to this is a this is a
[22:29] bit of a study but it's an incredibly
[22:31] important one because I want to on your
[22:35] behalf if I'm able I pray that God will
[22:39] allow me to put something into your hand
[22:41] that will disarm him render him helpless
[22:46] and you've got those doors tonight that
[22:49] you'll be equipped such as you've never
[22:51] been equipped before say Satan I'm
[22:54] prepared to meet you and stand my ground
[22:56] I'm not going to be just defensive now
[22:58] but I'll be offensive I have reason I
[23:01] have family I have friends I have
[23:03] children I have husband I have wife I
[23:06] have my own body to care for I am going
[23:10] to resist you
[23:11] I'm going to effectively resist you
[23:14] according to the Word of God do you have
[23:17] another Kingdom it's a kingdom of
[23:19] darkness but I am of the day I am of the
[23:21] light I'm of this resurrection power and
[23:24] you have no place with me whatsoever
[23:27] amen so over the years our Christian
[23:32] walk we have studied we've desired we
[23:36] have believed for the nature and
[23:38] character of Jesus Christ but this
[23:41] prophet said in the questions and
[23:43] answers and 61 he said study the enemy
[23:46] what he's going to do what's his move
[23:49] and then know how to meet him and he
[23:53] said and that's what we're here for
[23:56] now I've preached here several times but
[23:59] I've never preached on study your enemy
[24:01] but tonight this is not a negative this
[24:04] is not a negative message this is a
[24:06] positive message and you need to know
[24:09] and the Prophet said study your enemy I
[24:11] can tell you he certainly knew he
[24:13] certainly had studied him and he said
[24:15] that's what we're here for and study
[24:17] your enemies moves and knowing how to
[24:18] meet him and the thing that will
[24:21] overcome him so the Word of God is
[24:27] always the focus of Satan's attacks the
[24:31] message and the integrity of the message
[24:34] and the integrity of the revealed word
[24:36] is being questioned by some in this
[24:40] message is being questioned and now they
[24:44] have the tool of internet and all of
[24:47] these access and bring it into people's
[24:50] homes and so doubt Satan is using these
[24:54] technologies to him to the ultimate and
[24:57] maximum purpose for the kingdom of
[24:59] darkness and we need we're not
[25:02] interested so much in the technology for
[25:06] the kingdom of God as I am that God
[25:08] chose to preach the word and the word
[25:11] that we preach being the truth has got
[25:13] power to overcome that
[25:16] and God's not going to have any of his
[25:18] children to see but they are using all
[25:22] of these things than this is part of the
[25:24] reason why I perhaps will give testimony
[25:26] tonight this prophet said that he
[25:29] speaking of Satan hates all scripture
[25:32] and it's the whole Canon of Scripture
[25:34] but if anything he desires mostly is
[25:38] revelation that he despises I'm sorry he
[25:42] despises mostly is revelation in Genesis
[25:45] because Genesis tells the beginning and
[25:48] revelation reveals what's going to
[25:51] happen to him in the last day and to
[25:55] understand the subject we need to start
[25:57] at the beginning and in the beginning
[25:59] God the scripture the Prophet says God
[26:02] was alone with his thoughts in the
[26:05] beginning God dwelt alone with his
[26:08] attributes and that's his thoughts there
[26:12] was nothing just God alone but he had
[26:15] thoughts he created the angels to
[26:20] worship Him and the Angels worshiped him
[26:23] and he said and that made him God he
[26:26] said his own being now if you have a
[26:28] question and you want to jot down some
[26:31] places of Scripture that's perfectly
[26:33] fine as well because I have some
[26:34] scripture some locations of Scripture
[26:38] that might be a very interest to you of
[26:41] keen interest to you but he said he his
[26:44] own being created creatures to worship
[26:47] Him he said them to my opinion the first
[26:52] thing that he made was angels and then
[26:54] they worshiped him and that made him God
[26:57] and he started from there
[27:00] he created angels so he could be God he
[27:06] said in order to be God there had to be
[27:08] something to worship Him so he created
[27:11] angels and beings and cherubims and so
[27:14] forth
[27:15] to worship Him now you may think that
[27:17] I'm repeating being repeated repetitious
[27:20] but not so because there was some added
[27:23] added word so he created cherubims and
[27:26] serves an order of
[27:28] angels in fact and Lucifer was part of
[27:32] the heavenly creation
[27:34] you followed me now have you God was
[27:37] alone with his thoughts now he's got a
[27:40] host of angels and Lucifer was one of
[27:45] those from the initial creation in fact
[27:47] is I will give you quote in a few
[27:50] minutes where brother Branham says this
[27:53] and it certainly ties in with Isaiah
[27:56] saying the son of the dawn
[28:00] perhaps the dawn of creation and the
[28:04] prophet said that the only thing that
[28:06] Satan couldn't do was create he couldn't
[28:10] create I believe in my own heart of
[28:15] hearts is not a doctor and I just
[28:16] believe that he was standing there while
[28:19] God's Word went out and through Jesus
[28:24] Christ he created all things and without
[28:28] him was nothing created you believe that
[28:32] so the scripture tells us now that there
[28:35] was war in heaven and Michael and his
[28:37] angels fought against the dragon and his
[28:40] angels and the dragon fought and his
[28:43] angels and prevailed not neither was
[28:46] their place found any more in heaven I
[28:50] asked the question why was Satan cast
[28:54] out into the earth and his angels with
[28:56] him I mentioned this morning why was he
[28:59] not cast to perhaps the outer reaches of
[29:03] the soul of the universe and into some a
[29:08] dark abyss why wasn't he why wasn't he
[29:11] well he was cast in fact is it it is a
[29:14] great plan I personally believe that
[29:19] time was created and the creation took
[29:23] place to draw Satan into this all-time
[29:28] battle because I believe that God has
[29:31] set aside this time to destroy him I
[29:35] don't want to go to heaven or there's
[29:37] another war
[29:38] I want to go to heaven knowing Satan has
[29:43] been destroyed and my elated all his
[29:46] angels everyone he deceived and that we
[29:49] are free from Sam and that's what God's
[29:54] promised so why was he cast to the earth
[30:01] now you can you have to listen to the
[30:05] whole service very closely because the
[30:09] battle that started in heaven
[30:12] was not one yet your prophet said and I
[30:18] keep saying your problem so you'll know
[30:19] it's not me saying it your prophet said
[30:21] that the battle that was angels angels
[30:25] battle fell on humans how many humans do
[30:31] we have here oh your field your prophet
[30:39] said the battle of angels fell on you
[30:46] you're not gonna you're not gonna just
[30:48] get mind-over-matter and say you know
[30:51] III don't have it no no that battle fell
[30:55] upon humans we're humans so he said the
[31:02] this great first battle that was ever
[31:05] fought begin in heaven when Michael and
[31:09] his angels fought against Lucifer in his
[31:11] angels it first started the first battle
[31:14] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[31:17] on earth it originated in heaven and
[31:20] then was thrown down from heaven cast
[31:23] out of heaven to the earth and fell on
[31:27] human beings then the battle from angels
[31:30] became human battles and he said in
[31:33] another place has been raging ever since
[31:39] amen
[31:40] doesn't matter how quiet you are still
[31:43] the truth
[31:44] still the truth God sent a messenger to
[31:48] alert us to this and if we don't know
[31:54] and we don't understand and we don't
[31:56] make it our business or we don't at
[31:58] night but well be that we live a
[32:00] defeated life and Satan can defeat a
[32:04] person with a lot of things he can he
[32:08] breath brother ban says he takes them to
[32:10] an early grave it's not God's will say
[32:14] oh well you know I can't go to God pulls
[32:17] my number well that's only part of it
[32:19] the other thing he said some go to early
[32:22] grave
[32:23] don't let them go he prays that and then
[32:27] some some are taken by success you know
[32:32] the Satan uses success so oh I you know
[32:35] I've got to keep reaching out here
[32:37] because I've got scholarships and I've
[32:39] got this and I've got but what about a
[32:41] scholarship in the Word of God what's
[32:44] wrong with that what's wrong with
[32:45] studying this
[32:46] what's wrong with studying and knowing
[32:48] the enemy and say I faced you before uh
[32:51] yeah you've tried that before you you've
[32:54] got a friend of mine you've got a family
[32:56] member of mine you have someone you
[32:59] should be praying for do you have
[33:00] someone we should have victory over I
[33:01] believe that they the Prophet also said
[33:04] that God hates a powerless church he
[33:07] expects a church and I've given you
[33:09] power don't live powerless amen now now
[33:15] you can believe with I'll tell you in
[33:18] advance Satan doesn't want me to preach
[33:20] this but I'm gonna preach it anyway he
[33:25] doesn't want to be exposed he'd sooner
[33:28] have us ignorant about his moves and
[33:30] what his tactics but we won't be so now
[33:34] the first the first human that this
[33:37] battle fell upon was Adams wife she was
[33:43] the first human to come under the effect
[33:48] and the Prophet said I'm going to give
[33:51] you the quote later on the problem
[33:54] brother branham said that Satan loose
[33:57] her was right next to God you you were
[34:02] calling it said he was his right-hand
[34:05] man almost co-equal only in creation he
[34:13] could not create dozen friends he is our
[34:17] prophet said he was a slicker
[34:19] don't try and debate with him he knows
[34:22] more about the Bible and we do you talk
[34:25] about worship he was created to worship
[34:27] he knows all about worship and that is
[34:30] why even even into even into the music
[34:34] realm and they are trailing him that's
[34:36] why he dwells there probably even said
[34:40] that Hollywood was this was the seed of
[34:42] Satan it just moved it from Paris or
[34:48] someplace
[34:48] so now Lucifer needed a vessel Lucifer
[34:54] needed a vessel I hope you can follow me
[34:58] and so he who stood right next to God in
[35:04] heaven and has cast down now he goes and
[35:10] there's a God on the earth which is Adam
[35:13] the son of God and he takes and he takes
[35:17] and uses the vessel that's right next to
[35:21] him who is the serpent the serpent and
[35:24] it took a prophet to expose it he's not
[35:27] a snake he's a creature and he says
[35:33] perhaps more handsome and more appealing
[35:37] than even Adam what kind of a creature
[35:41] and he stood on his feet what kind of a
[35:45] being and ended and Satan Lucifer knew
[35:49] he was the only one with seed that would
[35:52] mingle with the woman you talk about an
[35:57] intelligence he knew some things so now
[36:01] the one that was right next to God in
[36:03] the heavens and is cast down
[36:05] earth he goes right next to the one that
[36:07] was next to man and uses him as a vessel
[36:12] and approaches not him
[36:14] than her because he didn't have the he
[36:19] didn't have the facility
[36:21] she had the facility to carry the scene
[36:23] oh my I'm just holding back a wee bit
[36:31] friends Satan when he came to Jesus
[36:36] Christ he came to the man Jesus Christ
[36:40] overcame him and stripped him and it is
[36:45] Jesus Christ speaking through this
[36:47] messenger you want to listen to me now
[36:51] and saying to you making a declaration
[36:53] your moon is sealed Alleluia
[36:59] he can come in with all of his attacks
[37:02] and do whatever he might do and pass
[37:04] through your mind and torment you and
[37:07] hound you and all the rest of it but the
[37:11] elect of God cannot receive his saint
[37:15] because Jesus Christ died to seal your
[37:19] wound your mental woo hallelujah do you
[37:23] believe that you believe that she'll
[37:27] thank God I'm sealed sealed sealed
[37:32] there's nothing else in this world
[37:34] that'll do it so he chose the closest
[37:40] thing to the human race the serpent now
[37:44] the Lucifer's the son of the morning
[37:47] that's his characteristic the front of
[37:51] the morning don't confuse them all now
[37:54] now he comes and uses an the facility of
[37:59] the serpent and the serpent even the
[38:01] name indicates he was one of cunning and
[38:07] and even the name means our divination
[38:14] so now
[38:17] being the son of the morning that isn't
[38:19] gonna work down here he has to use that
[38:23] cunning deception on Eve's mind and he
[38:30] has a question I want you to be fully
[38:33] awake now he has the question and many
[38:39] some have raised up in the message with
[38:41] the question you can have a question
[38:45] I've had questions but this is a
[38:48] question with an agenda behind it the
[38:52] agenda is to get this person to
[38:54] disbelieve and I can proclaim and tell
[38:59] you that there are those that have
[39:00] raised up that within the message and
[39:03] they're asking questions but the
[39:06] question is to get the people who read
[39:08] the question to disbelieve the word if
[39:12] you agree you can say America and I say
[39:17] to you give no place to the devil I
[39:20] wouldn't even take time to read the
[39:23] garbage I don't I really don't i'm just
[39:27] been made aware aware of others that are
[39:30] tormented by it and whatever you do
[39:39] don't give me the impression that you
[39:42] don't know anything about it
[39:46] be truthful
[39:48] so yeah I'm aware of it and I will say
[39:52] to you give no room to him give no space
[39:55] to him I do with people that they spend
[39:58] their time reading all about all the
[40:00] trash and stuff that all the accusations
[40:03] and everything else why waste her time
[40:07] with you spend that kind of time
[40:11] studying the message and all these
[40:18] network things hundreds and hundreds of
[40:20] millions tell your friends hello friends
[40:25] tell my friends yeah all those people
[40:27] out there aren't my friends they're not
[40:30] your friends
[40:37] angels are skilled and worship friends
[40:41] they're skilled and worship
[40:49] that's what they were made for so now
[40:55] here's brother branham's description
[40:57] I've gone to a lot of a lot of work to
[41:01] have this just down concise he said the
[41:06] serpent which was of being more like a
[41:08] man
[41:10] all right upon his feet just like a man
[41:16] in heaven Lucifer was right next to God
[41:20] and on earth he entered and used the
[41:22] serpent which was right next to man who
[41:25] was God of the earth and in the mark of
[41:29] the beast he said Satan could not have
[41:32] been the serpent he said Satan could not
[41:34] have been the serpent said in
[41:36] Corinthians it speaks the Bible said
[41:39] that transformed himself into an angel
[41:41] of light he said you just underestimate
[41:46] Satan we don't want to do that we'd want
[41:49] to underestimate him
[41:51] we're not glorifying him but we don't
[41:52] want to underestimate him he's our enemy
[41:55] he's an arch enemy he's God's enemy he's
[41:58] a Prophet's enemy he's the enemy of this
[42:00] message he said if he could come into
[42:05] the kind of substance like meeting made
[42:08] an angel of light and here's what
[42:10] brother Benton says if he could come
[42:11] into that kind of substance then why
[42:14] could he not come into a beast
[42:16] the next thing to a man next thing to a
[42:19] man so now notice Satan changes his mask
[42:26] Corinthians says Paul speaking in
[42:29] Corinthians lest Satan should get an
[42:31] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[42:34] of his devices we know his scheme in
[42:38] other words we know his methodology we
[42:42] understand it says put on the whole
[42:45] armour of God that you may be able to
[42:47] stand against the wiles of the devil is
[42:50] that the scripture put on the whole
[42:53] armor of corn that you might be able to
[42:55] withstand the wiles of the devil and the
[42:58] wiles of the devil is ax is the scheme
[43:01] or the craftiness the strategy and the
[43:04] deceit for we wrestle not against flesh
[43:06] and blood but against principalities
[43:08] against powers against the rulers of
[43:11] darkness of this world and against
[43:13] spiritual wickedness in high places how
[43:16] the Prophet says know your enemy
[43:18] he said a real good fighter usually
[43:20] knows and studies his opponent he
[43:24] studies his licks or his blows study the
[43:29] enemy and questions and answers again he
[43:32] said what's he going to do
[43:34] what's his move and then know how to
[43:36] meet him and that's what we're here for
[43:39] I have some slides but I think I'll just
[43:46] omit these after these first slides he
[43:51] says in the seal of the Antichrist the
[43:54] right-hand man of Almighty God was
[43:58] Lucifer at the Sun of the morning the
[44:00] first I want this congregation to think
[44:05] of that the first let's think about that
[44:12] a moment the right-hand man of Almighty
[44:15] God was Lucifer the son of the morning
[44:18] or the son of the dawn the first I
[44:23] assume and I believe that perhaps he was
[44:26] the first one created and the Bible the
[44:30] Prophet said another place in the
[44:32] beginning when God spoke and Satan was
[44:35] standing there and heard it in the
[44:37] beginning when God spoke Satan was
[44:40] standing there and heard it if I saw
[44:44] that word let the let there be light I
[44:52] don't know eons of time what light
[44:55] appeared let the earth bring forth let
[45:02] the water dry out and he sees the power
[45:07] this word of power going forth and the
[45:10] Prophet said to give you some concept to
[45:12] give you a concept
[45:14] and I think we need this I really do I
[45:17] believe we need this to give us some
[45:19] concept we also want to know our God
[45:22] they said ah like a little sacred light
[45:26] way back when he was alone a second how
[45:31] can the Prophet go back well Isaiah went
[45:33] back Zico went back John went forward I
[45:36] don't have any trouble so the Prophet
[45:39] went back way back in the back part of
[45:41] God's mind way back when God was alone
[45:43] and he said to give you some concept in
[45:46] Christ the mystery said because this
[45:49] great being that fills all time and
[45:51] space fills the space between you and I
[45:55] sometimes we want to pray and ask old
[45:58] God send your virtue down his virtue and
[46:01] all of his attributes are right here
[46:02] closer than your breath if I get you to
[46:06] see that be it be nothing impossible for
[46:09] us you get this group of people to
[46:12] believe that we absolutely nothing
[46:14] impossible all healing mercy forgiveness
[46:17] is everything God God fills all time and
[46:23] space his Phyllis Phyllis building with
[46:30] all the attributes of God
[46:31] no wonder the prophets so strained if he
[46:35] could just get the people to accept that
[46:37] to receive it it was right here and it
[46:39] just speak the word and as they wouldn't
[46:41] believe it whatever they would believe
[46:42] whatever you would say it will happen
[46:45] according to his will hallelujah
[46:57] and Satan was standing there and the
[47:04] prophet Isaiah picked up the scene and
[47:08] he says Lucifer said Allah said I'll do
[47:15] that there was the only thing that he
[47:19] couldn't do so he left it after that
[47:21] power of the spoken word o believers
[47:26] friend I want you to grasp this tonight
[47:30] this message that came out of a prophet
[47:33] is not his words it is the words of
[47:37] Almighty Claudius
[47:40] Alleluia and I'm going to tell you of an
[47:43] experience now tonight I hear him say a
[47:46] word and say something happened in the
[47:49] in actual the the whole span of of the
[47:53] of the whole weather system say a change
[47:58] and I'll give it to you I was there it's
[48:02] not happen when you think of a man
[48:05] speaking in the elements of the world
[48:09] the elements of space begin to obey then
[48:13] we need to awaken and shake ourselves
[48:15] and say this message is not just a book
[48:18] or a tape this message has come from the
[48:21] eternities from Almighty God and I'm
[48:24] going to believe it that way I'm going
[48:26] to walk out and act on it that way
[48:29] alleluia alleluia
[48:32] you know sometimes healy and things like
[48:34] that move us a great deal you know a
[48:36] very very short time ago just very
[48:38] quickly just a short time ago a doctor
[48:41] because he's kind of watching me over my
[48:43] age and he says I want you to go through
[48:45] this I want you to go through that so
[48:47] it's okay okay fine we'll go through
[48:49] this test go through that test
[48:51] he called me in after a bunch of
[48:54] bloodwork and so on he said were you
[48:57] sick when you had this exam this blood
[48:59] test I said no he said are you diabetic
[49:04] he knows me well said are you diabetic I
[49:07] said no I don't think
[49:09] said you are now really he said but he
[49:17] was concerned he says your white blood
[49:19] cell count is not good so I don't
[49:24] understand all this stuff as three major
[49:25] things and I said well he said I'm gonna
[49:30] send you for another test so I go into
[49:33] the lab and I said to the young lady in
[49:35] the lab I said you folks ever make
[49:37] mistakes and she said well no she said I
[49:43] don't think so why I said well did this
[49:48] this blood test report that went to my
[49:51] doctor sounds like a different person
[49:53] doesn't sound like me at all
[49:56] okay so she she let me stand right there
[49:59] and watch in a while she took the piece
[50:01] of paper and glued it on and let me read
[50:04] it says my name is on there okay fine so
[50:06] she did all the bottles you know and did
[50:09] another blood test and I go back to the
[50:11] doctor and he said well this is better
[50:15] this is better and this is better you're
[50:19] just a little just watch it and I'd like
[50:21] you to just go and talk to the nurse
[50:23] about diabetes and so on said okay fine
[50:25] so you know they had me prick my finger
[50:27] for about a month and whatever they want
[50:29] fine but the Prophet tells us that
[50:32] healings in the body I say god I'll look
[50:36] after this body you give me and you do
[50:38] the rest
[50:39] amen hallelujah glory to God I believe
[50:44] it with all my heart I'm just kind of
[50:49] rejoicing because it wasn't that long
[50:50] ago I was exactly in in brother IV state
[50:54] so I told him all about it I said then
[50:57] put an injection there right to the
[50:58] nerve and all the rest of it and they
[51:00] told me you'll be here every three
[51:02] months every three months you have to
[51:03] have that I said brother IV that's
[51:05] that's two years ago I've been hunting
[51:09] I've been on the quad we've been
[51:10] shooting moose we've been packing meat
[51:12] we've been going over logs and
[51:14] everything else hallelujah hallelujah
[51:18] I believe what I'm
[51:20] beating friends glory to God and if God
[51:24] chooses for me to go however he chooses
[51:26] to go that's fine with me but my god
[51:28] healing is I believe it healings between
[51:31] you and I my brother my brother healing
[51:33] is between you and I
[51:35] forgiveness is there all the mercies
[51:37] there and some preacher yet I'm saying
[51:39] or mercies no more mercies no more
[51:42] that's my saying God's no more he can't
[51:45] he can't diminish he can't diminish in
[51:47] love he can't diminish and mercy he
[51:50] can't diminish than anything he can
[51:52] change the access how you have access
[51:55] you can't go to your old dead dead
[51:57] formal Church and get it but you can get
[51:59] it where the spoken word is you believe
[52:02] that and I can tell you where the spoken
[52:05] word is Satan is not very far away he's
[52:08] right there handy he wants that he
[52:10] desires that and he despises the fact
[52:13] that use a little little piece of dust
[52:16] as a human can believe God and have that
[52:19] spoken word act and he can't make it
[52:22] work
[52:23] Lori to God hallelujah friend humans
[52:28] will be happy I'm going to preach anyway
[52:31] so he comes down and now he's with the
[52:34] serpent and he he works let's just
[52:36] follow that guy that serpent for a
[52:38] moment the serpent to practice
[52:41] divination insight or foretelling like
[52:46] he always like he has some kind of
[52:48] wisdom seeking knowledge by supernatural
[52:51] means to discover hidden knowledge this
[52:55] is his nature I'm talking about the
[52:56] characteristics of the Lucifer
[53:00] and the mark of the beast he says
[53:03] further Satan was kicked out of heaven
[53:05] and came to the earth there was nothing
[53:07] else he could do he could get into the
[53:10] animal would be too far from him seed
[53:13] wouldn't mix so he had to get into this
[53:16] serpent which was a being more like a
[53:19] man he was the most subtle most shrewd
[53:23] cunning wisdom smarter than the animal
[53:27] he was right next to the man now you
[53:31] didn't had to hear from brother Bissell
[53:33] you
[53:33] from the prophet of God right next to
[53:36] the man in the questions and answers he
[53:38] said 64 said the Satan the serpent
[53:41] almost almost almost had a soul it's
[53:50] impossible for us to determine how close
[53:53] that was almost had a soul and he stood
[53:58] upon his feet just like a man he says
[54:00] then that seed which was next to the
[54:02] human seed and he goes on to say and you
[54:04] better believe this Satan himself the
[54:06] spirit knew that there was only one seed
[54:10] that that was the only seed that would
[54:13] pregnat the woman hey that's how he got
[54:17] into the human race but now listen
[54:21] closely and the serpent I want to say
[54:24] the serpent in Moses ministry Moses the
[54:28] first word prophet oh my you've got to
[54:32] let me preach for the first word prophet
[54:36] the people had heard the voice of God in
[54:39] the mountain and the Prophet says so
[54:41] many times they said don't let God speak
[54:43] to us anymore that's too fearsome you
[54:46] speak you go up and meet him you hear
[54:49] him and then come and speak and I was
[54:51] the first time Moses is the first
[54:53] prophet of that nature and he hears the
[54:56] Word of God speaks and God speak it
[54:59] mouth to ear to him and sends him down
[55:01] and speaks of the people and when Moses
[55:07] first heard saw the pillar of fire and
[55:10] met that God in the burning bush I'm the
[55:13] God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the
[55:15] God of Jacob take off your shoes you're
[55:18] standing on holy ground he says I'm
[55:23] gonna send you I've heard the cry of the
[55:25] people I'm gonna send you any now he
[55:29] begins to make excuse that's what's in
[55:31] your hand
[55:33] rod catch that rod and it became a
[55:37] serpent serpent
[55:42] lujah because the serpent you're looking
[55:46] at me earnestly the serpent had already
[55:49] been judged and God spoke to the serpent
[55:53] and said because you have done this
[55:56] I'm putting Emily between you and the
[55:59] woman and between your seed and your
[56:02] seed anybody ever disputed you above the
[56:05] serpent seed take him to Genesis 3:16
[56:08] and say what is this vein but what is
[56:11] this seed
[56:11] I'll put enmity between you and the
[56:13] woman and between your seed and her seed
[56:16] and the seed woman doesn't have a seat
[56:19] as a prophetess said but she has a field
[56:22] she has a field Oh hallelujah love to
[56:29] preach it right now on the field of Boaz
[56:31] hallelujah Ruth was Boaz is field we are
[56:36] the bridegroom's field he soldiers see
[56:41] hallelujah you were meant for his seed
[56:44] you are not meant for the Serpent's seed
[56:47] and so God through Jesus Christ and not
[56:51] just by a messenger your mind your see
[56:55] move womb has been sealed alleluia
[57:01] because it was made for one scene you
[57:07] might have known others who were in a
[57:08] denomination but their seed wouldn't
[57:10] work they were dead and Jesus went
[57:13] because you were united to sin by birth
[57:16] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[57:20] and the only way in the invisible union
[57:24] we that was our first union and Jesus
[57:28] Christ that union could only be broken
[57:30] by death that's the only way your Union
[57:34] could be broken every man woman and
[57:37] child in this place and on earth was
[57:39] born in sin and shapen in iniquity and
[57:43] married to that sinful nature that was
[57:47] the first husband and in order to have a
[57:50] legal separation with
[57:52] husband he had to die and so our Lord
[57:55] Jesus Christ came and went to Calvary
[57:58] and died to break that million and said
[58:03] you and I free hallelujah and he rose
[58:07] again so the Apostle Paul said so you
[58:10] can be married to another even Jesus
[58:13] Christ raised from the dead and bring
[58:17] forth fruit unto Him all my goodness
[58:21] help me out hallelujah
[58:29] and Satan was the serpent the serpent
[58:33] now we're saying Satan but we don't want
[58:35] to interchange the names the serpent he
[58:39] said he's already been judged and so
[58:42] when he put it on the ground had become
[58:45] a serpent and the Bible says and Moses
[58:47] fled from it just take it up by the tail
[58:51] he reaches down and takes it by the tail
[58:52] and emissions of rot again becomes as
[58:55] his staff again and the staff was always
[58:58] an emblem of the Word of God now I may
[59:03] create more questions than there will
[59:06] answers but I want you to think of it'll
[59:08] set your thinking and it becomes a rowdy
[59:10] game then he comes before Pharaoh and
[59:13] the Prophet said Satan was in the
[59:16] Pharaoh and God was in Moses you believe
[59:19] that God was in Moses God is in you God
[59:24] was in roses Satan was in Pharaoh and so
[59:27] Moses does one of the plagues a cheap
[59:31] magician trick come on magicians they do
[59:33] the same thing false anointed ones Moses
[59:36] did something they did something he did
[59:39] something they did something he cast
[59:41] down his rod he'd become a snake they
[59:46] cast their rods down they become snakes
[59:49] and his slate snake his serpent saw it
[59:54] all aresult and the Prophet said what
[59:58] did Moses do he said he took the rod
[1:00:00] that had just swallowed all airs up and
[1:00:02] went out and went out in the wilderness
[1:00:04] and did miracle
[1:00:05] withered hallelujah our trouble is we
[1:00:12] got two smaller God hallelujah
[1:00:16] hallelujah I'm gonna grind it down
[1:00:20] friend I'm gonna say strong things he
[1:00:22] said strong things I'm gonna repeat what
[1:00:24] he said he said sim shim there is
[1:00:28] anybody free from sin but sin he said
[1:00:31] once it's confessed when it's confessed
[1:00:33] I'm talking about a real confession it
[1:00:36] drops into the bleach of the blood of
[1:00:38] Jesus Christ and he says and you cannot
[1:00:42] find it again because it breaks up it
[1:00:44] breaks up it's even in even the
[1:00:46] construction of the chemistry breaks up
[1:00:50] and you can never put it back together
[1:00:52] again you can never find it again and he
[1:00:56] says furthermore that it actually
[1:00:58] becomes bleach and you'll never find it
[1:01:02] again say well I don't know if I got
[1:01:05] that big well my god is that big you can
[1:01:07] never find it again no he was praying
[1:01:10] and asking God to remember something in
[1:01:12] the past that he's already forgotten
[1:01:15] hallelujah he has the capacity to
[1:01:17] completely forget and annihilate the
[1:01:20] thought of it
[1:01:20] hallelujah that's my god amen
[1:01:29] so Aaron suited down the rod of Moses
[1:01:32] before Pharaoh and it became a serpent
[1:01:35] and demonstrating that the serpent
[1:01:38] identified sin already judged he was
[1:01:43] demonstrating before Farrell this is
[1:01:45] already judged and Moses serpent
[1:01:48] swallowed theirs up and the Bible says
[1:01:51] in Moses also the Moses made a serpent
[1:01:55] of brass and put it upon a pole and it
[1:01:59] came to pass that if a serpent had
[1:02:03] bitten any man when he beheld the
[1:02:06] serpent of brass when he beheld sin
[1:02:10] judge
[1:02:14] when you behold Sinjar soon as something
[1:02:19] begins to cause you to quiver or to
[1:02:23] tremble or to you feel you're going to
[1:02:27] be overcome just look and look at the
[1:02:30] Word of God look at the promise and see
[1:02:33] sin judged and if you behold sin judged
[1:02:38] and you can say Satan you have already
[1:02:41] been judged you are doomed and you keep
[1:02:48] holding to that you keep confessing that
[1:02:51] you're going to be a free man a free
[1:02:53] woman in no time
[1:02:55] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:03:04] the two that fought in heaven now as
[1:03:15] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:03:17] wilderness jesus said even so must the
[1:03:20] Son of Man be lifted up and whosoever
[1:03:22] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:03:24] have eternal life he's dealing with the
[1:03:26] consequence of death he'll not perish
[1:03:29] and no Marvel he said for Satan himself
[1:03:32] is transformed into an angel of light at
[1:03:35] first Corinthians 2nd Corinthians 11 and
[1:03:38] 14 but now I want to come to Satan who's
[1:03:43] the adversary and one who withstands one
[1:03:47] who opposes another in a purpose or act
[1:03:52] the first time are you interested miss
[1:03:56] the first time that Satan is mentioned
[1:03:59] in the Bible is in chronicles 1st
[1:04:06] chronicles 2 and 11 and Satan stood up
[1:04:10] against Israel and provoked now he
[1:04:15] doesn't come and show himself as an
[1:04:16] angel of light he doesn't come with
[1:04:19] divination of the serpent he's coming
[1:04:23] now to all pose
[1:04:25] you see the characteristics if he can't
[1:04:28] come and show you more light but even
[1:04:30] when he came through the serpent to Eve
[1:04:32] he said he offered her more light
[1:04:35] there's people and trouble that has
[1:04:39] arisen even within the ranks of the
[1:04:41] message because people come and our
[1:04:44] offering said oh if you believe this you
[1:04:47] have more light to say excuse me folks
[1:04:49] I've got an entire message I've got the
[1:04:53] entire message opened by a prophet of
[1:04:55] God and that is the light of the hour
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] hallelujah glory to God I tell you what
[1:05:05] I can say that with and I do say that
[1:05:07] with some force because I have heard all
[1:05:10] kinds of wins that have come through oh
[1:05:12] this is like a special light there's no
[1:05:15] special light Christ is the light he the
[1:05:18] revealed word is a special light but he
[1:05:23] offered eath more light and now he's
[1:05:31] changed his characters that has changed
[1:05:33] from a messenger of light to one of
[1:05:38] divination and a question did God say
[1:05:41] now that doesn't really sound terrible
[1:05:43] does it did God say it's not the words
[1:05:48] that sound so terrible if the agenda
[1:05:51] behind it well how will I know that's
[1:05:56] where you need to really be in tune with
[1:05:59] God
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:02] what's behind the question and the Bible
[1:06:09] says and Satan stood up against Israel
[1:06:11] and that's the first time the term is
[1:06:14] used for this dark enemy of the Church
[1:06:19] of the brighter Christ and Satan stood
[1:06:22] up against Israel and provoked David to
[1:06:25] number Israel and I don't know exactly
[1:06:27] why but that was a grievous sin to God
[1:06:29] that he would number Israel
[1:06:31] I suppose it showed some lack of trust
[1:06:35] the the term Devils first mentioned in
[1:06:41] Leviticus and three or four times in the
[1:06:43] Old Testament is in direct reference to
[1:06:47] sacrifice to Devils he use the term
[1:06:51] Devils but singular devil the devil does
[1:06:55] not appear in the Old Testament and the
[1:06:59] first time it appears in the Bible is
[1:07:01] when and the devil you want to be
[1:07:07] interested in this the Bible says then
[1:07:10] was Jesus led up of the spirit into the
[1:07:13] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:07:17] had not been before you're seeing it up
[1:07:22] there all right
[1:07:23] and the devil now it's not it's not late
[1:07:29] Sun of the morning
[1:07:31] it's not health God said I can show you
[1:07:37] a better way it's not that now and it's
[1:07:40] not Satan who's opposing how he's coming
[1:07:44] he's opposing God's king who posing the
[1:07:49] truth and and causing him to do
[1:07:54] something that's contrary to God but now
[1:07:58] now oh I want this church I want the
[1:08:05] people to see what I'm speaking now the
[1:08:09] two
[1:08:10] that were in eternity back in the
[1:08:15] eternities and one one of the word and
[1:08:18] now the word has become flesh and now
[1:08:22] they look at each other again
[1:08:24] eyeballs her eyeball and now it's the
[1:08:29] devil and the Bible teaches us to be
[1:08:33] tempted of the devil and the devil is an
[1:08:37] accuser see he didn't come just to show
[1:08:41] you more light he didn't come just to
[1:08:44] entice you in some nice things that's
[1:08:46] what people say oh they feel it you know
[1:08:48] this might even be glod come on wake up
[1:08:52] what's the end they're off which
[1:08:54] direction is it taking a person say no
[1:08:57] I'm not going there I'm not going to
[1:08:59] some old hold formal thing I'm not going
[1:09:03] to become lacks and lukewarm I'm gonna
[1:09:05] be aggressive with this word I'm gonna
[1:09:08] believe it I'm gonna have zeal in my
[1:09:10] heart
[1:09:13] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you
[1:09:20] believe it sir Amen you believe it with
[1:09:23] all your heart
[1:09:24] Alleluia I'm looking for that kind of
[1:09:27] response we believe it I want to see
[1:09:31] that there's believers here I want to
[1:09:33] take a stand
[1:09:34] Moses said come and stand by me stand by
[1:09:37] your prophet steinbier a pastor whoever
[1:09:41] it is stand by and realize that this is
[1:09:43] a devil now he's gone from son of the
[1:09:46] morning son of the dawn but we need to
[1:09:49] know what his agenda was his agenda says
[1:09:52] I want that spoken word and when he gets
[1:09:55] down and now he's facing with the
[1:09:58] creature of the spoken word which is
[1:10:01] Adam and Eve God the God of the earth he
[1:10:04] comes as just how I can show you more
[1:10:06] light and this is more wonderful and
[1:10:09] this is more enticing and did God say
[1:10:12] you shouldn't protect you this well this
[1:10:14] is this is going to take you you'll be
[1:10:16] sure he didn't take it in the wrong
[1:10:18] direction
[1:10:20] come on folks that's exactly so well
[1:10:26] this doesn't hurt does it do any good
[1:10:32] and now to be tempted of the devil and
[1:10:35] here's here's Christ himself made flesh
[1:10:40] facing the enemy that he faced in the
[1:10:44] eternities to be tempted of him now now
[1:10:50] the word has become flesh do you think
[1:10:53] the for a second that that the enemy
[1:10:55] didn't know that that that that body now
[1:10:58] the word was in the body and the word
[1:11:00] became flesh and there are certain
[1:11:03] restrictions he's not tired he got
[1:11:06] hungry and after 40 days the scripture
[1:11:10] says he was unhung word that didn't
[1:11:12] happen in heaven that happened here and
[1:11:16] not the same one that looked they looked
[1:11:18] at each other eye to eye over there now
[1:11:21] they're on earth where he's been cast on
[1:11:24] earth and and and what does Jesus use
[1:11:27] what does Jesus use against him the very
[1:11:30] thing he lusted after the spoken word of
[1:11:33] God and your prophet happened to say
[1:11:37] listen to me folks your prophet happened
[1:11:40] to say Jesus did not use any of his
[1:11:42] grand and wonderful gifts he used what's
[1:11:45] available to you and it's your fault my
[1:11:49] fault if we don't use it it's like
[1:11:51] having your armory full of assault
[1:11:53] weapons but we won't use them I tell you
[1:11:56] take a hold of the Word of God said my
[1:11:59] prophet sent from God our Lord Jesus
[1:12:02] spoke through him and the same one who
[1:12:05] denied you and rebuked you there is now
[1:12:08] rebuking you because he dwells in me and
[1:12:11] you have no part of me
[1:12:14] Alleluia and my God has said I am sealed
[1:12:18] and you don't even have any access to me
[1:12:26] Alleluia
[1:12:29] and I hear you maybe somebody's saying
[1:12:32] well you don't know what I go through
[1:12:34] yeah I do I know what he goes through I
[1:12:38] can tell you that he's one fellow that
[1:12:40] doesn't leave the minister alone because
[1:12:43] he's afraid we might say something of
[1:12:45] eternal worth he might say feel that
[1:12:48] we're going to use something of the
[1:12:50] spoken word of God
[1:12:51] and speaks the word hallelujah I've made
[1:12:55] real enemies of his I told you this
[1:12:58] morning I just read one line this is a
[1:13:01] wounded one and her husband doesn't know
[1:13:04] she's read this listen friends because I
[1:13:06] obeyed that to the letter
[1:13:09] I flew four and a half hours with my
[1:13:12] wife in Reverse by jet to come to that
[1:13:15] town of Geneva Switzerland
[1:13:17] and two strangers total strangers picked
[1:13:20] us up there were the two that I'd got
[1:13:23] emails from and drove us to their home
[1:13:25] and took us up into the bedroom which
[1:13:28] they had prepared and I stood there in
[1:13:30] my suitcases right there my wife is
[1:13:32] right here I'm standing here and they
[1:13:36] closed the door and said refresh
[1:13:38] yourself and we'll come down have coffee
[1:13:41] I said to my wife what are we doing here
[1:13:47] what are we doing here for five days

[1:13:52] with people we never stay with people

[1:14:00] doing here but because of that a
[1:14:03] convention because some people came over
[1:14:08] and I told them no meetings
[1:14:09] I won't preach no meetings but they said
[1:14:12] well is a little we literally building
[1:14:14] here it's a quaint cute little Church in
[1:14:16] a town of about 150 people where we are
[1:14:19] and we're just gonna have our family
[1:14:20] gather there alright and I spoke to the
[1:14:24] family and because of that two of the
[1:14:27] brothers said you must come back we must
[1:14:33] have a service
[1:14:35] you know gather the people could you
[1:14:37] come next spring
[1:14:38] the pray about it we did
[1:14:42] and with a magnificent place in the
[1:14:45] windows along that side there's a grand
[1:14:49] mountains of Switzerland and snow in the
[1:14:52] valley all green and the pasture land it
[1:14:55] was just picture-perfect and God spoke
[1:15:00] to me and said conference with God and I
[1:15:07] went and got the message says and God
[1:15:09] will choose a beautiful place Sunday
[1:15:11] like Geneva and get people aside away
[1:15:17] from their families and away from all
[1:15:19] other things because of her because of
[1:15:22] crisis because there's a crisis God had
[1:15:27] already said these people are wounded
[1:15:29] you're talking about bruised Reed's
[1:15:32] bend over to the earth not knowing how
[1:15:37] we'll ever straighten up the game and so
[1:15:40] we had a gathering about 120 hundred
[1:15:44] thirty hundred forty people and I tell
[1:15:47] you it's the only time in my life it was
[1:15:48] like came into the room but there's many
[1:15:52] people are like a blanket fell over and
[1:15:56] there was people from all kinds of
[1:15:58] doctrines this doctrine and that
[1:16:01] doctrine and people who are afraid of
[1:16:03] each other and it kind of looked around
[1:16:05] the room and God and I said converse
[1:16:08] with God God said you'll call people to
[1:16:11] a beautiful place something like Geneva
[1:16:13] I said look at that and I said the
[1:16:16] reason he calls them is because there's
[1:16:18] a crisis and you people are in a crisis
[1:16:25] and it's like God brothers threw a
[1:16:28] blanket over the place and it was a
[1:16:30] witness even to senior men who came from
[1:16:33] Belgium they came from Holland they came
[1:16:36] from Germany they came from Italy they
[1:16:38] came from Romania they came from Croatia
[1:16:40] they came from all over the place
[1:16:43] and the next year even before we left
[1:16:45] they said when is the next meeting and
[1:16:47] it's like God drew a blanket around and
[1:16:50] said this is my convention nobody's
[1:16:54] going to town
[1:16:55] with this said Oh God happy way every
[1:17:00] way these people have been beating these
[1:17:02] people been bruised these people have
[1:17:04] been gone after this personality gone
[1:17:07] after that personality and I spoke very
[1:17:10] straight to them and God gave them a
[1:17:13] heart to receive and we just finished
[1:17:15] the fifth year of glorious almost 300
[1:17:18] people and that blanket is still over
[1:17:20] the group hallelujah I tell you what
[1:17:24] friends I said this is a neutral country
[1:17:26] it's known as a neutral country and let
[1:17:29] people come from all over the country
[1:17:31] even want to come from my church and
[1:17:33] they did and they flew from different
[1:17:35] places to be there in a neutral place
[1:17:37] and hear the word of God with no agenda
[1:17:41] no agenda we have one agenda that we
[1:17:45] will fall in love with the bridegroom
[1:17:47] that's our agenda hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:50] and we won't let Satan we deny Satan the
[1:17:54] right to tamper with this kind of love
[1:17:56] affair hallelujah glory to him I won't
[1:18:03] say forgive me but at least pray for me
[1:18:05] I have such an urgency within myself and
[1:18:16] so who you was to be tempted to the
[1:18:19] devil Jesus in the form of the second
[1:18:23] Adam by a new creation uses the same
[1:18:27] word that Lucifer desired to have and
[1:18:32] defeats him and he perhaps did not
[1:18:35] realize that the very word of creation
[1:18:37] that he listed to have would destroy him
[1:18:41] when the word became flesh hey man our
[1:18:47] Lord Jesus took of this earth that had
[1:18:50] been cursed because of him and our Lord
[1:18:53] Jesus even took him to cursed earth and
[1:18:55] and then lived in a body God in flesh
[1:19:00] and he took it to Calvary
[1:19:03] listen friends I'm going to say
[1:19:05] something perhaps you've heard it before
[1:19:06] but in in the servant that we have as
[1:19:09] the servant of God our precious brother
[1:19:11] branham God took a man that was born in
[1:19:15] sin he said he was a sinner
[1:19:17] we know that born in sin in shape
[1:19:20] iniquities and took him to a place of
[1:19:23] adoption where he where he was wholly
[1:19:26] surrendered to the will and the word of
[1:19:29] God and he wasn't interested in any
[1:19:31] denomination he wasn't interested in
[1:19:33] wealth in those things
[1:19:34] and showed us another way and we are
[1:19:38] virgin born as Jesus was virgin born but
[1:19:42] we are born in sin but now we have an
[1:19:45] example that you can be born in sin and
[1:19:48] overcome the enemy and live in
[1:19:51] overcomers life that's why the message
[1:19:54] came the message didn't come just to
[1:19:57] have us with churches dotted across the
[1:19:59] landscape the message came that there's
[1:20:02] going to be a people these buildings
[1:20:04] going to be empty one of these days
[1:20:05] there's going to be people that's going
[1:20:07] to depart them and go to some unknown
[1:20:09] place gonna be taken into another realm
[1:20:13] into another dimension I will come again
[1:20:16] and receive you unto myself that where I
[1:20:20] am NOT where I will be where I am there
[1:20:23] you shall be also do you believe that
[1:20:26] I'm rejoicing in that brother hallelujah
[1:20:29] we're gonna be there I believe that with
[1:20:34] all my heart and soul and then as
[1:20:43] Lucifer came and used the one next to
[1:20:52] Adam now we have the second Adam and we
[1:21:00] have one next to him his name is Judas
[1:21:05] and they are in the Last Supper looking
[1:21:12] over the table together
[1:21:16] he is not afraid of your home he is not
[1:21:21] afraid of this church he's not afraid of
[1:21:24] this building he's not afraid of just a
[1:21:27] lot of person others from their lips but
[1:21:29] when a person by the inspiration and the
[1:21:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost speaks the
[1:21:34] Word of God he is he is disarmed
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:40] hallelujah
[1:21:41] and now think of it friends I'm moving
[1:21:46] on down now it comes right next to the
[1:21:48] one the second Adam and I look right
[1:21:55] across the table I won't look at any
[1:21:57] person they look right across the table
[1:22:00] at each other and Jesus says what thou
[1:22:05] doest do quickly and the Bible says read
[1:22:14] it in your Bible then Satan entered him
[1:22:17] and he became the son of perdition and
[1:22:23] the son of God had four died one took
[1:22:28] worm to Calvary at Calvary son of God
[1:22:31] took one to heaven a son of perdition
[1:22:34] took one to hell that's the account of
[1:22:38] the gospel of Jesus Christ and the devil
[1:22:42] is an accuser now he's moved from one
[1:22:47] that opposes you to one who accuses you
[1:22:50] oh you think you're in the rapture you
[1:22:55] think you're going to heaven you think
[1:22:57] you're especially let group that's
[1:23:00] exactly that sounds just exactly like
[1:23:02] him and he's an accuser I know he'll dig
[1:23:12] up stuff he'll dig up some weakness
[1:23:14] something something you said a long long
[1:23:16] time ago and repented over a multitude
[1:23:18] of times just say you said that you
[1:23:21] think you're a believer
[1:23:25] what's what what should we answer them
[1:23:28] for the biskits what should we answer
[1:23:32] I'll answer him with yes I've been
[1:23:36] cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:38] which you haven't I repented over my sin
[1:23:42] which you can't I've just done a whole
[1:23:45] lot of things that you can't do and I'm
[1:23:48] a son of God which you are and I'm
[1:23:51] destined for heaven which you are
[1:23:53] hallelujah there's a big difference
[1:23:55] friends glory to God hallelujah so the
[1:24:04] two were face to face again in a
[1:24:07] different form and the Prophet said in
[1:24:10] the first seal and in this act tonight
[1:24:12] in this act tonight is that we're going
[1:24:18] to see that if Satan changing his mask
[1:24:20] he changes Sun of the morning to
[1:24:27] divining creature offering more light
[1:24:31] something more more knowledge in a
[1:24:35] brighter kingdom now and then he moved
[1:24:38] and he's opposing now he's opposing you
[1:24:41] feel that opposition same one same one
[1:24:45] and now he takes another position to
[1:24:49] accuse all how he can accuse he knows
[1:24:53] the scripture he's a sucker
[1:24:56] he knows the Word of God and he uses
[1:24:58] that and twisted around and his intent
[1:25:03] is to degrade you to deny you your claim
[1:25:14] and one of the things and is why I'm
[1:25:18] coming to it now that he's attempting to
[1:25:24] do is find and he raises up those to
[1:25:29] find things that they say are
[1:25:31] irreconcilable in the message and the
[1:25:36] saying
[1:25:37] is this what your message says does it
[1:25:41] say this and and and if you were to say
[1:25:44] well yeah yeah it does say that I guess
[1:25:46] you know the it's not the question its
[1:25:51] what is the agenda don't forget it what
[1:25:54] is the agenda behind the question is get
[1:25:57] you to disbelieve the messenger if the
[1:26:03] same serpent asking a question with the
[1:26:07] intent of getting the person the
[1:26:09] believer the one that God has put his
[1:26:12] hand on to question the source of the
[1:26:16] spoken word because that's the thing he
[1:26:20] despises so says the second writer was
[1:26:31] exactly the same as the first horse he
[1:26:33] says what happened he changed his
[1:26:35] ministry another place he said he
[1:26:37] changed his position but now before I
[1:26:48] come to my testimony just hold it a
[1:26:50] moment
[1:27:02] I'm just questioning
[1:27:10] there's a tactic of war and war
[1:27:13] certainly something of Satan and during
[1:27:18] the Second World War horrific things
[1:27:20] took place the Holocaust
[1:27:24] I understand 54 million young men and
[1:27:29] people perished 54 million that's a very
[1:27:33] sizable country let alone a city
[1:27:38] perished some of our finest of young men
[1:27:42] and young ladies perished for what here
[1:27:47] we are a few years later so it hardly
[1:27:50] know what happened war but there was a
[1:27:55] tactic of infiltration infiltration
[1:28:00] rather a tactic of infiltration which
[1:28:04] was first implemented during the first
[1:28:06] world war or the first birth pain I
[1:28:10] prefer to use the prophets language and
[1:28:13] was used to gain further in the Second
[1:28:16] World War but infiltration attacks began
[1:28:19] with brief and violent bombardments of
[1:28:21] the enemy front lines to suppress and
[1:28:24] demon and demoralize the soldiers
[1:28:27] stationed there Satan knows this tactic
[1:28:30] very well it doesn't just come with one
[1:28:33] and the reason why people perhaps become
[1:28:37] a little quiet in and withdrawn when I
[1:28:40] come to a subject that's so close to
[1:28:42] home is because it is so revealing and I
[1:28:45] can just hear there's somebody here that
[1:28:48] has felt the bombardment come from one
[1:28:51] direction in another direction in
[1:28:53] another direction in another direction
[1:28:55] I'm not talking about succumbing to it
[1:28:58] I'm talking about overcoming it have you
[1:29:01] felt that you would be ashamed to raise
[1:29:04] your hand would you you've had the
[1:29:06] bombardment okay I'm preaching even for
[1:29:09] a few of you the bombardment also
[1:29:13] targeted the enemy re areas rear areas
[1:29:17] to destroy and disrupt roads and
[1:29:19] artillery and command units this was
[1:29:22] done to confuse the enemy and
[1:29:23] to reduce their capability to launch an
[1:29:25] effective counter-attack I have people
[1:29:29] that have you know maybe they start to
[1:29:31] get cool and then they're not in the
[1:29:33] service and not in the church in the
[1:29:35] house of God and go and talk to this
[1:29:37] person that person and and and maybe
[1:29:40] there's a question first but before long
[1:29:42] they're questioning the minister the
[1:29:46] pastor that's not sufficient then they
[1:29:48] question the church then they question
[1:29:51] the message then they question the
[1:29:53] Prophet himself and that's the pattern
[1:29:56] that it usually takes and from there
[1:29:58] next time you'll find them there in the
[1:30:01] world absolutely in the world and I've
[1:30:06] had them laden with Sam dark with Sam
[1:30:12] say I'm okay that's the next one I can't
[1:30:17] even believe the deception that has
[1:30:19] completely swallowed them completely
[1:30:21] swallowed them up completely in the
[1:30:23] world say hey I'm okay my kids are okay
[1:30:26] and you know their kids are drunkards
[1:30:28] and prostitutes they were okay I tell
[1:30:32] you what your children your family you
[1:30:36] may have loved ones in that state
[1:30:37] there's only one remedy and that is that
[1:30:40] the Holy Ghost will draw them to a place
[1:30:43] of repentance and they will find peace
[1:30:45] with God once again I'll be personal
[1:30:52] with you right now
[1:30:53] I'll be personal with you I have a
[1:31:02] half-sister that has experienced a lot
[1:31:06] of trouble in her life but she's done
[1:31:08] very well she's a professor and teachers
[1:31:11] in a university but she was going
[1:31:14] through a very very difficult times very
[1:31:17] very Grievous time in her teens that's
[1:31:20] right when I was with brother Benham and
[1:31:25] it so happened that I had to ride out
[1:31:27] and leave brother Branham in the hunting
[1:31:29] group we're in this beautiful place of
[1:31:31] the mountains and I had to ride out
[1:31:35] about 30 miles on
[1:31:38] and I couldn't believe that brother
[1:31:40] Southwick was gonna let me go alone at
[1:31:42] least he'd have a son go with me to lead
[1:31:45] the way I mean I'm in grizzly infested
[1:31:47] country I'm in absolute you haven't got
[1:31:51] wilderness perhaps have seen wilderness
[1:31:53] like this and I am I am I have some fear
[1:31:59] yes I do I've gotta cross rivers where
[1:32:02] the horse may have to swim I don't know
[1:32:04] and so I said buddies is Blaine gonna go
[1:32:08] with me now I said the horse knows the
[1:32:10] way hey I've written horse when I walked
[1:32:12] into never thirst and put their head up
[1:32:14] against the tree and I want you to tell
[1:32:16] them what to do they don't know which
[1:32:19] way to go and I wouldn't help for me if
[1:32:21] I don't know which way to go
[1:32:22] so here we are and I wake up that
[1:32:25] morning and the great big snowflakes are
[1:32:27] coming down total whiteout of snow
[1:32:29] coming down and they're all in the
[1:32:32] cookhouse and brother branham Billy Paul
[1:32:34] and all them in the cookhouse and I went
[1:32:36] the next tent was one year where brother
[1:32:38] branham and I and I believe I bleep her
[1:32:41] this off man was there and we I was
[1:32:43] rolling up my head my bag my sleeping
[1:32:45] bag did on my hands and knees and
[1:32:49] rolling up sleeping bag and brother
[1:32:54] Brent crawls in on his hands and knees
[1:32:56] part of the tent he sits in squats down
[1:33:01] he said well brother Eddie said I really
[1:33:06] hate to see you're going and I said yeah
[1:33:09] I hate to go - he said oh he said just
[1:33:14] be nice if we could just be up here for
[1:33:17] a month or so and the Sun would come out
[1:33:19] and shine nice and warm and we'd go up
[1:33:23] and see some big Rams in these mountains
[1:33:24] and I bit my lip because I was starting
[1:33:27] to tremble a wee bit and I was saying
[1:33:30] within myself for the Branum don't do
[1:33:32] this to me you're just killing me you
[1:33:37] know and then he turned real serious and
[1:33:39] he said but I know he said you know
[1:33:41] you've got a family and you got to work
[1:33:43] and you've got responsibilities
[1:33:45] I understand they said and I understand
[1:33:48] about the church
[1:33:50] in Dawson Creek the UPC was trying to
[1:33:53] take it away and he said I understand
[1:33:57] about the church in Dawson Creek and
[1:33:59] about your sister that's all he had to
[1:34:02] say I'm here preaching tonight and I
[1:34:07] told that sister of the prophets words
[1:34:10] praying that they would anchor in her
[1:34:12] heart that she could never have peace
[1:34:15] till she has received this Lord Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ amen friends I'm where I'm with
[1:34:21] you we're all in this together I'm
[1:34:25] holding fast hallelujah
[1:34:27] we've got battles to fight and I'm
[1:34:29] saying she's not yours devil she's not
[1:34:33] yours
[1:34:34] God's pokes her prophets mouth and spoke
[1:34:38] some things and said some things says he
[1:34:40] has another intention amen now give you
[1:34:49] part of my testimony now do we have
[1:34:55] about twenty minutes is that Alright
[1:34:59] you have never heard this has it never
[1:35:01] been written in a book and I only give
[1:35:07] it because there have been those who
[1:35:10] have took it upon themselves to go
[1:35:17] public and to say some things which I
[1:35:21] think are not right and I feel it it
[1:35:27] would be good to alert you and make you
[1:35:31] to know it as well and this concerns the
[1:35:39] brown bear vision the brother Brown
[1:35:43] spoke of and there's no record of it
[1:35:46] happening how many have that have had
[1:35:52] that question for you understand you
[1:35:55] heard about it
[1:35:57] quite a few how many raise your hands
[1:35:59] all right
[1:36:01] I want to be forthright and yet honest
[1:36:11] this is my testimony and I speak it
[1:36:16] because I was there these men who I'm
[1:36:23] familiar with and acquainted with took
[1:36:25] it upon themselves and on on the
[1:36:29] Internet have gone on a site called
[1:36:34] believe the sign when these men put that
[1:36:37] site up they were indeed professing to
[1:36:41] be believers but I say without any
[1:36:45] hesitation they have since become
[1:36:46] enemies of the message and still
[1:36:49] maintain that site to me it is so
[1:36:52] cunning that people would come on and
[1:36:55] with it with the heading believe the
[1:36:58] sign the web the website the web page
[1:37:01] believe the sign when in fact those
[1:37:03] behind it have their full intention to
[1:37:06] see that you don't believe the sign and
[1:37:09] I am here to be truthful to be honest
[1:37:12] with you and to show you in the message
[1:37:14] so that you are never shaken by such a
[1:37:17] thing
[1:37:46] on the site you will see in May 1962
[1:38:00] possessing all things brother Branham
[1:38:03] said many of you remember the vision
[1:38:04] that I had where I had shot the grizzly
[1:38:07] bear 9 foot grizzly bear and the church
[1:38:10] remembers me telling it here and the
[1:38:13] caribou I was in that that took six
[1:38:15] hours that vision to be fulfilled so I'm
[1:38:18] not speaking of that I am the one in the
[1:38:20] green checkered shirt that was waiting
[1:38:22] for him said I had another remember it's
[1:38:26] on tape here and I seen a great huge
[1:38:29] brown bear that might be a Kodiak and it
[1:38:33] wouldn't have worked down here there in
[1:38:35] Canada because they're not there you see
[1:38:39] but wherever it will be it will be
[1:38:42] it'll be it will be that's thus saith
[1:38:46] the Lord it will be in the next slide
[1:38:52] then he comes out now may 1962 now this
[1:38:56] is June 1962 the next month now I'm
[1:38:59] going back into the country that you
[1:39:01] might know when I come back next year
[1:39:05] I'm going to get a brown bear that's
[1:39:08] almost twice that size you see if it's
[1:39:12] right or not
[1:39:13] I seen it when we were standing put my
[1:39:17] hands on his haunches laying on the
[1:39:19] ground like that and I could put my
[1:39:22] hands on his hips like that and him
[1:39:24] laying down now you find out if that's
[1:39:28] right or not then in August she just
[1:39:40] just hold that one off a moment would
[1:39:42] you please in August of 1962 we went up
[1:39:50] on the hunt and these people who put the
[1:39:56] sign up
[1:39:58] said william branham william branham
[1:40:03] returned to british columbia in July of
[1:40:05] 1962 these are their comments and
[1:40:09] preached six services on Vancouver
[1:40:12] Island those are the services which we
[1:40:14] arranged my wife played the piano and I
[1:40:19] was on the platform but did not fulfill
[1:40:22] the vision of the tie at that time he
[1:40:26] returned in British Columbia to British
[1:40:29] Columbia again in October 1964 with
[1:40:32] Perry green but did not fulfill the
[1:40:36] vision at that time either when william
[1:40:39] branham passed away on December 25th
[1:40:42] 1965 the vision had never been fulfilled
[1:40:46] what does that mean the question it
[1:40:51] means that when william branham said in
[1:40:53] 1962 that he would shoot a brown bear in
[1:40:57] british columbia and that this was thus
[1:41:00] saith the lord
[1:41:01] he spoke presumptuously and
[1:41:05] presumptuously is to infer that someone
[1:41:09] is speaking beyond the realm of
[1:41:10] authority their realm of authority he
[1:41:13] was speaking presumptuously
[1:41:15] now if you'll go back please to
[1:41:17] September 1962 and the reason I
[1:41:21] understand this is because this was
[1:41:23] after the hunt that I'm going to
[1:41:26] describe in a few moments and now
[1:41:29] brother Branham says so I in these
[1:41:31] thirty going on thirty two years of
[1:41:34] ministry I have tried to stay true to
[1:41:37] the word I don't know of one thing I've
[1:41:41] ever had to alter on because I just read
[1:41:44] it out of the Bible just it said just
[1:41:49] what the Bible said and let it go like
[1:41:52] that and so I haven't had to try to back
[1:41:55] or rearrange because I just said it the
[1:41:58] way that the Bible says it and I find
[1:42:02] out if God now notice if God has spoken
[1:42:07] anything then we must go with that word
[1:42:11] in or
[1:42:12] to make it be fulfilled he said we seen
[1:42:22] that as I told you last night of a
[1:42:25] vision just recently see that it I had
[1:42:30] to be there I had to be there he's just
[1:42:35] finished saying you have to you must go
[1:42:38] with that word in order to make it be
[1:42:40] fulfilled and he said now I had to be
[1:42:43] there and warning to be there
[1:42:45] and telling me six months before to be
[1:42:49] on that spot and stand there and saying
[1:42:53] go down there three times with them and
[1:42:57] I just walked on with the other men and
[1:43:00] the vision passed right through exactly
[1:43:04] God's part and I was left standing
[1:43:09] you understand so we want to remember
[1:43:14] you've got to stay on the word just stay
[1:43:18] right with the word and where the word
[1:43:20] leads you go right with the word and
[1:43:23] it'll bring you out all right
[1:43:26] I'm sure now the reason why I understand
[1:43:30] that is because I was there in August
[1:43:34] with him
[1:43:35] and this is what happened it's my
[1:43:39] testimony brother Branham did not
[1:43:44] describe in detail the brown bear vision
[1:43:49] like he did of the caribou in the
[1:43:51] Grizzly which he told him very fine
[1:43:54] detailed the measurement of the horn and
[1:43:55] so on and however he did say that he was
[1:44:01] out with some small fellows when he got
[1:44:04] this particular bear and here are the
[1:44:07] details as it happened we traveled on
[1:44:11] horseback about 25 miles and we made
[1:44:17] camp way far into the Rocky Mountain
[1:44:19] trench mountains on all sides beautiful
[1:44:23] place mother Brown said it was just like
[1:44:26] beyond the curtain of time and we made
[1:44:31] camp and the next next day we looked and
[1:44:36] we we just saw you know it was a
[1:44:40] beautiful day and brother brother
[1:44:44] Southwick he said to his son Blaine
[1:44:46] there was Blaine his son Billy Paul
[1:44:49] brother branham son myself brother
[1:44:51] Southwick and brother branham and
[1:44:57] brother brother Southwick suffered with
[1:45:02] angina a little bit so he couldn't exert
[1:45:05] himself too much and so climbing he was
[1:45:08] slower than us younger fellows we were
[1:45:10] about half their age I was 27 brother
[1:45:13] branham was 52 I might have been 28 and
[1:45:16] he might have been 53 our first time I
[1:45:19] was 27 he was 52 so brother Brown is a
[1:45:23] brother Southwick said Blaine he said
[1:45:26] you take her brother Billy Paul and
[1:45:30] Eddie and to a certain direction he
[1:45:33] directed us and he said and I'll take
[1:45:36] brother branham and we'll go here on the
[1:45:38] hill a mountain right behind the camp is
[1:45:41] beautiful grass not much trees and
[1:45:44] willows and easy climb much easier than
[1:45:48] where we were going and so we left we
[1:45:51] left that morning and walked we walked
[1:45:56] to a place down this beautiful
[1:45:58] magnificent Valley and then a mountain
[1:46:02] was here and there was a small valley
[1:46:05] like a v-shaped valley which came up to
[1:46:07] a ridge and a saddle down from this
[1:46:10] mountain and went up between these two
[1:46:12] mountains and so we'd climb partway up
[1:46:15] and what we'd call the first ledge the
[1:46:18] first bench of this mountain and it just
[1:46:20] came around like this in this valley
[1:46:23] going this direction big valley vast
[1:46:27] vast areas and we got up on this bench
[1:46:31] and we just just as we started to walk
[1:46:33] on this bench we look up and here's a
[1:46:36] massive bear coming down equal
[1:46:40] to us but he's coming down just on the
[1:46:42] other side of this little V and it's
[1:46:45] widening out a wee bit until here when
[1:46:48] it flows into this valley
[1:46:50] it turns this way and this arse turns
[1:46:52] this way and so when we saw him coming
[1:46:54] down we got behind some willows and and
[1:46:59] kind of hid and because there wasn't any
[1:47:01] trees or bushes such but just these
[1:47:03] willows and we got down behind the
[1:47:05] Willows and he's coming down we watched
[1:47:08] him for perhaps as long as a half an
[1:47:10] hour and he's turning over stones and
[1:47:12] they're looking for rodents and looking
[1:47:14] for they also eat roots these big big
[1:47:18] grizzly bears and so he just moseying
[1:47:22] his way down feeding as he came and he
[1:47:25] came right down across from us dead
[1:47:27] across from us I have never seen a bear
[1:47:32] like this I've lived in the north most
[1:47:35] of my life I've been in the woods I've
[1:47:37] been in camps were as I said in the
[1:47:41] meeting I haven't had dogs as a friend
[1:47:43] but I've had bears because they were in
[1:47:45] camp every night dumping over the
[1:47:48] garbage cans and so on they were so
[1:47:50] common black bears and whatever more but
[1:47:54] this bear I have never seen a bear like
[1:47:55] that he was massive absolutely massive
[1:47:57] I'm not exaggerating but the outstanding
[1:48:00] feature of him is from he was dark he
[1:48:03] was dark in color but right behind his
[1:48:06] ears came a band from his hump as the
[1:48:12] Grizzlies have a hump a band about I
[1:48:14] would say about a foot wide coming right
[1:48:17] down and down over his chest over his
[1:48:20] Cape area like this and it was the color
[1:48:24] of golden wheat absolutely ripe harvest
[1:48:29] wheat it was gold I have never seen an
[1:48:32] animal like that in my life
[1:48:34] brother Blane Southwick who still lives
[1:48:38] has told me that that is the largest
[1:48:41] grizzly he's ever seen are the largest
[1:48:43] berries over same and he thought it
[1:48:46] probably would go a thousand pounds that
[1:48:49] was a massive massive animal and he just
[1:48:53] stood
[1:48:53] and he was on this Bluff and we're on
[1:48:56] this one right across so Blaine and
[1:48:59] Billy both are they're saying shoot him
[1:49:02] brother Eddie
[1:49:03] shoot him why don't you shoot him and I
[1:49:05] said no no I'm not I'm not gonna shoot
[1:49:07] him I said brother branham heaven I
[1:49:09] don't think even fired a shot and I I
[1:49:12] you know we want want him to get
[1:49:14] something and so we just watched him and
[1:49:17] we watched maybe 10 15 minutes and they
[1:49:21] were after a while I said why don't you
[1:49:23] shoot him take a shot you know I said no
[1:49:25] I don't want to shoot him it's quite a
[1:49:26] distance but I had a very flat shooting
[1:49:28] gun and I said no IIIi won't shoot him I
[1:49:32] said I want brother branham to get a
[1:49:34] shot first and get an animal and then
[1:49:38] that bear he just stands there like this
[1:49:40] and he goes his head massive head goes
[1:49:44] up and it just waves it from side to
[1:49:46] side like this and I know that he's got
[1:49:49] a wind of something and he's smelling
[1:49:52] their eyesight is very poor but boy
[1:49:55] they're scent of smell is just
[1:49:57] incredible and he's going like this and
[1:50:00] we're over here he goes like this
[1:50:08] just like that I he's zero driving on
[1:50:12] where we where we were probably five six
[1:50:14] hundred yards away he just looked like
[1:50:16] that and then he just wheeled around
[1:50:18] this way and started straight up this
[1:50:21] mountain and he and he a ram came
[1:50:25] through the glacier went right over the
[1:50:27] glacier great big paw marks we're
[1:50:30] watching him in our scope and went over
[1:50:32] the top he was gone somewhere between
[1:50:34] twelve and fifteen minutes over over
[1:50:36] that mountain peak it was the most
[1:50:38] incredible thing so we continued on that
[1:50:42] and then that evening when we got back
[1:50:45] to camp we said well we saw this
[1:50:49] magnificent barren and they haven't shot
[1:50:53] anything and so that night some
[1:50:56] somewhere in the night started to rain
[1:50:59] and it rained rain steady rained the
[1:51:07] next day clouds hanging down rained the
[1:51:11] next day rain the next night rain the
[1:51:14] next day rain the next night rain never
[1:51:18] let up rain the next day one two three
[1:51:22] four days and nights and just rained
[1:51:26] everything was just sobbing let heavy
[1:51:30] clouds cold miserable and
[1:51:36] brother-brother Southwick he I was the
[1:51:39] kind of the point man because I arranged
[1:51:41] the Hunts bought the food and so on and
[1:51:45] you actually when you buy the food for a
[1:51:47] hunt you count how many eggs you're
[1:51:49] going to eat a day each how many slices
[1:51:52] of bread because you got to pack it on
[1:51:54] horses all that distance so if there was
[1:52:00] any message brother branham want to get
[1:52:02] to butter something yeah they would talk
[1:52:04] between themselves butter there's
[1:52:05] anything having to do with the
[1:52:06] arrangement they would generally say
[1:52:08] well you know so bud says to me just in
[1:52:10] an attempt we're all in the tent but he
[1:52:13] says he's I guess brother Brandon wants
[1:52:15] to go home I said what I turn around
[1:52:19] brother Brown was over
[1:52:20] here his brother branham I said you want
[1:52:23] to go home all he said we've had a
[1:52:26] wonderful time brother Eddie I would my
[1:52:28] heart just went down to this my boots I
[1:52:31] said we just got here we just started
[1:52:34] you haven't fired a shot he said that
[1:52:36] means I can come back next year that
[1:52:40] didn't satisfy me I just thought I said
[1:52:43] well you know I didn't know what to say
[1:52:48] I just didn't couldn't believe that he
[1:52:52] was going to leave and then he said well
[1:52:55] you know he said by the time I get home
[1:52:57] I've been gone quite a while and I
[1:52:59] started to think yeah a day we rode in
[1:53:02] today we ride out that's two days four
[1:53:04] days sitting in there that six days he
[1:53:07] drives up probably three days you know
[1:53:10] one has to drive back yeah he's it's
[1:53:12] over two weeks by the time he gets back
[1:53:14] I said I understand so we start to
[1:53:19] dismantle things we have to pack
[1:53:21] everything and but he just does one job
[1:53:24] he did not like and he began to pack all
[1:53:27] the food and the stuff and we're all
[1:53:29] working around we had to pack everything
[1:53:31] up in the tent roll up our bags and get
[1:53:34] all ready and then in the horses now let
[1:53:36] me tell you folks in case you don't know
[1:53:38] horses hate to be packed up when they're
[1:53:41] wet and cold and get those saddles and
[1:53:45] cinches on their wet cold skin they're
[1:53:48] just like humans they don't want to they
[1:53:50] don't want that and so we have to start
[1:53:52] finding the horses and bringing them in
[1:53:54] and tying them up and putting the saddle
[1:53:56] blankets 100 the saddles pack saddles
[1:53:59] and cinch it up and our riding horses or
[1:54:02] you know there's there's 35 of us and so
[1:54:07] I I got on my horse I just sitting on
[1:54:10] the horse
[1:54:11] everything is so cold and Bud is
[1:54:14] starting to pack the panniers as the
[1:54:16] side boxes on the horse and the Blaine
[1:54:19] has to help him it it's a two-man job
[1:54:21] and brother branham came out he says
[1:54:24] brother Eddie he said where did you
[1:54:26] brother see that bear I said right down
[1:54:30] here I said you just go down this valley
[1:54:34] and that first first little Valley that
[1:54:37] you see going up into the mountain he
[1:54:39] was right there on that first ledge
[1:54:40] that's where he was right on the edge of
[1:54:43] it
[1:54:43] and so he said I wonder I wonder how
[1:54:46] much longer we're gonna be bud he says
[1:54:48] how long will it be before we have to
[1:54:50] pull out but says oh you've got all
[1:54:53] kinds of time he says we're not leaving
[1:54:55] here for two-three hours or whatever he
[1:54:58] said you know it'll be noon before we're
[1:55:01] gone he said just go on you know and
[1:55:06] just go you got lots of time so brother
[1:55:09] branham just took off in that direction
[1:55:10] and I just saw him disappear in the
[1:55:14] Willows and he was gone and there's not
[1:55:17] much that I could do because you know
[1:55:19] we're just helping out and whatever more
[1:55:21] and then and then when I bought maybe
[1:55:24] hour and a half to two hours later
[1:55:26] brother branham came back I was sitting
[1:55:29] on my horse at that time in rain gear
[1:55:33] but the bud was just up a few yards from
[1:55:36] me and brother branham came up and stood
[1:55:40] right beside my horse right here and he
[1:55:43] looked up and he says brother Eddie he
[1:55:46] said I'm the Jonah in this group now all
[1:55:49] I can tell you is the truth
[1:55:50] I'm the Jonah in this group and he
[1:55:54] pointed to the sky said this is on
[1:55:55] account of me he said it's only the
[1:55:58] second time I know in my life that i
[1:56:00] disobeyed a vision he said you know that
[1:56:03] first time was in in Africa and then he
[1:56:07] started talking about Africa and and and
[1:56:10] he didn't I remembered that there was a
[1:56:12] time when the ministers and different
[1:56:14] men were trying to persuade him to go
[1:56:17] someplace or have meetings or whatever
[1:56:19] more and then I think that's when he got
[1:56:21] sick and he said and it's the only
[1:56:24] second time that I know that i disobeyed
[1:56:27] a vision and he said just like this but
[1:56:32] it's over
[1:56:32] and we'll ride out of here dry friends
[1:56:39] but it's over and we'll ride how to here
[1:56:43] dry
[1:56:46] there's the most unbelievable words that
[1:56:51] you could possibly hear and I didn't
[1:56:56] even respond I didn't know about the
[1:56:59] other vision I didn't I didn't know that
[1:57:02] this was part of the vision that had
[1:57:04] taken place but now he's identified it
[1:57:07] and said it's on account of me and so
[1:57:12] I'm sitting on my horse and I'm just I'm
[1:57:15] just I'm pondering the event caught in
[1:57:20] kind of the vortex of something but it
[1:57:22] was not unusual to have this kind of
[1:57:25] experience with this servant of God
[1:57:28] and while I'm sitting there I think
[1:57:32] probably 10 12 15 minutes I'm just
[1:57:39] sitting there and it was a puff a puff
[1:57:44] of air I it's not a wind but it was just
[1:57:49] a puff a movement of air if it passed me
[1:57:53] that way I remembered like it was five
[1:57:56] minutes ago
[1:57:56] I thought that was warm it was so nice
[1:58:00] and warm and and and and then there was
[1:58:05] an air movement but no wind no breeze
[1:58:08] just air movement and it just increased
[1:58:12] and kept moving around like the action
[1:58:14] clouds all hanging down low and
[1:58:17] everything just soggy wet and now this
[1:58:22] air movement going in and then kind of
[1:58:24] turned into a bit of a breeze in a few
[1:58:27] moments and and the Willows were right
[1:58:29] about where this wall is in here where
[1:58:31] this brother sitting that's where the
[1:58:33] Willows were and the horses were tied in
[1:58:36] there and we were to pack them and and I
[1:58:41] notice a leaves on the Willows starting
[1:58:44] to shake like that hear me now two
[1:58:49] minutes walking through those bushes
[1:58:52] you'll be soaked to the hide everything
[1:58:55] was so soaking wet
[1:58:57] and now I see the leaves are just moving
[1:59:00] and shaking like that and and I was just
[1:59:05] sitting there on the horse and right out
[1:59:07] in front of me probably where these
[1:59:10] sisters are sitting maybe a little
[1:59:11] further they're just a big a big ah
[1:59:18] sunshine
[1:59:20] struck the earth and I thought now
[1:59:24] looked up like this and there was a like
[1:59:27] just big hole in the sky and I was
[1:59:29] looking for the first time at blue sky
[1:59:31] hadn't seen blue sky for days I didn't
[1:59:35] think anything spiritual I just thought
[1:59:36] isn't that nice you know for sunshine
[1:59:40] I've seen in days and and that Suns and
[1:59:44] little balmy air moving around I thought
[1:59:47] it's just great and before long that you
[1:59:50] know the whole of sunshine got bigger
[1:59:53] and bigger and finally it was you know
[1:59:56] surrounding us and I take off my rain
[1:59:58] gear and take off that in and I'm
[2:00:00] finding in my shirtsleeves and before
[2:00:03] our horses took one step it was I I
[2:00:10] cannot tell you there wasn't a cloud but
[2:00:12] I never saw a cloud the sky was just
[2:00:15] blue from from one peak to the other and
[2:00:19] we rode out of there that day the next
[2:00:22] eight hours in hot sunshine of the
[2:00:26] northern and up there that Sun doesn't
