I'm going to ask Brother Tom if he'd come. &gt;&gt; Sister Judy Floren wants us to remember Brother Roy this morning. Not well in his body. also a family of uh friend of theirs, Averil Newbie, who passed away last Tuesday. If we remember the family, our sister Barb Cantalon's wanting us to pray for brother Ally is going in on Wednesday for spinal fusion surgery. God would give him peace and relief from pain. Sister Carmemella is requesting prayer for a friend who's sick and needs the Lord so much. Man, we all need him. Amen. Remember, Sister Carmemella's friend. If you've got a need this morning, whatever it would be, just remember it. Take it before the Lord this morning as we come to prayer. Amen. Tom, [Music] what a wonderful, wonderful song that is, Lord, to know that you've already provided. You were wounded for our transgressions. By your stripes, we are healed. Lord, you've already provided that. And we are so thankful that we are believers this morning that we can claim you've already provided my healing. You've already provided my deliverance. You've already provided for our needs for your Jehovah Gyra, an everpresent God. Jehovah Shama. Lord, you know our needs before we'd even speak them. So Lord, as brother Rod had read the song, we praise you this morning. We praise you at the rising of the sun. especially the bride in this last age when the sun has arisen again to the evening light time. Lord, we want to praise you this morning. We want to lift up our voices. We want to lift up our hands. We want to thank you for our deliverance. We want to thank you for touching your people. We want to thank you for a word that's been open. Want to thank you for a message, Lord, that means more than life to us. We thank you for your messenger. We thank you for that angel that was in attendance, Lord. And you gave to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. Lord, we're thankful for a pastor this morning that will stand behind the sacred desk. Anoint the man of God and anoint our ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church. Anoint brother Lance tonight, Lord. These are gifts to the church. And may we hear what you would speak to us, Lord. Father, for every need, we pray that you will minister, Lord, knowing that the word of God has come to heal the people. Heal them by the word. And Lord, these burdens that have been spoken, Lord, meet these needs. And these people that have a great need, we ask that you will provide for them. And you be glorified through the testimony that you hear us when we pray. We commit now this service to you. Be glorified in Jesus name we pray. Amen. [Music] And you may be seated. And we've got a baby dedication this morning. You taking it, Brother Tom? Brother Bisc's taking. Okay. Well, we'll wait till he's out.

And as they uh, says, "Brother Biscll comes, let's sing together. Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so. Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so." They jous [Music] loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. [Music] The second verse. So Jesus loves me. He who died. Heaven's gates to open wide. He will wash away my sins. When you little child, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells Sing force again. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Well, that should put a smile on anybody's heart and life and mouth and face. Jesus loves us. If he hadn't, we we wouldn't be here, would we? And now we have uh Brother Craig and Sister Yola Novakowski. And they're not their latest edition, their first edition. There's always something special about the first edition, isn't it? Uh I was uh I was thinking about how brother Greg and Sister Yola uh I I heard brother Greg, he went back to Poland to find a wife. Of course, I don't know any other details too much, but he'd already been communicating with her. And uh the way things happen is just so so miraculous. you know, she's in Germany and he's going back to Poland and I don't I don't know what's happening. I just kind of took my hands off of the thing. And here Greg goes over and finds Yola. I mean, that's a And her daddy's a pastor uh of a work over there and and Yola's mom and father are here today. And I thought that is just lovely. Uh so the grandparents of this little one they have and I wonder if we could have uh Yola's mother and father stand and uh brother Greg's mother and father stand as well if we could please. So, it's our brother Wesley and sister Anna Kupka and uh they will be flying out on Thursday. God bless you. Thank you. It's been so nice to have brother Andrew and sister Dorothia and Novakowski and to raise young people like this. Uh to to you, Brother Greg and Sister Yola. Uh I was thinking when I was thinking I wasn't trying to be humorous about Greg going to Poland and finding a bride. Uh there's been stranger things in the Bible, but it's pretty close to some of them. And uh I think you did real real well. Did real real well. You found a real jewel and we're very proud that you're here. But brother Brandham said this. He said uh regarding uh how how uh we have children and how you and I came here because each one of us are a child of somebody. And God spoke to us and he said like a man that is building chimes or making chimes the molder. I'm glad we have a molder. Not just a father and a mother, but a moulder behind them directing things. And uh each bell has got a different ring from the other one. And the same materials, but so much iron and so much steel and so much brass to make it and give the right thing. And he says, "And that's the way God did. He bred this one to that one and this one to that one and this one to that one until he got what he wanted. &gt;&gt; And I thought of who guided, you know, brother Greg to go far far away and guided sister Yola's life here and there and different events in their life. But it was the molder &gt;&gt; wanting to get just exactly so much of this and so much of that and so much of this and so much of that and bring forth one. &gt;&gt; And they've called this one Yan Isak and Yan is the precious. God is gracious and uh Isak he laughs or laughter joy. And I thought of how God the moulder has brought just so much all down through the centuries until this one. Yan will come on the scene and give the right sound. I never heard a grandpa grandpa like Andrew Novakowski said the other night. He said, "This boy, he has the most wonderful voice." How old is he? &gt;&gt; One month. &gt;&gt; One month. So, this grandfather discovered that and I pretty well know. I've had some children. I know what they do in the first month. And I said, I've never heard a grandpa yet find it was so wonderful to hear a voice in the first month. But anyway, we'll take it because all grandfathers uh believe that, I guess. But that's the first time I heard it confessed. But I am asking and going to dedicate Yan Isak. I'm going to ask that if the Lord Jesus carries and he comes of age that he will give the right ring in the high family and in the house of God, it'll be the right ring because God has brought together just so much of each characteristic. and I pray he will have a terrific voice we can do with them. And they brought the young children and Jesus took them up in his arms. I'm a poor substitute for him, but I'm going to take little Yan Isac and dedicate them to the Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, I hold this jewel, this prize, this gift that you have given to our brother Greg and sister Yola and to their parents also how they would treasure him. And I pray, Father, as the Holy Spirit watches over him, that you will give mother and father wisdom, that they will be guided, instruct him, train him up in the way that he should go, and when he grows up, he shall not depart from it. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that you'll protect him and watch over him. And I ask that he will indeed be a joy in the family and an a joy and and an example to his peers, Lord Jesus. And I pray that when he comes of age, he will know the name of Jesus Christ and the purpose of your life here on earth. I ask, oh God, you will use him and make him a blessing in the house of God as well. I pray father you will give him a voice that he will bring a joy to others and laughter father and uh may he have a spirit on him the holy spirit that will bring such comfort and joy to those that he's around keep him in good health I pray that you'll give sister yola wisdom Lord in the home and brother Greg oh God to guide his footsteps may he set an example for him in the name of Jesus Christ as you have given him to them. They now stand here and dedicate him back to you. We give him to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Sister Noah. God bless you, Greg. Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. Well, we stand here today with a great deal of joy in our hearts for the ministry also that has gone out from the church today. There's so many that are out ministering and brother Dier's in Phoenix. Brother John Andes will be taking his place in Seattle this afternoon. Brother brother Murphy is still overseas. He's uh finishing his last service now in in Switzerland. Uh they're actually having the meeting this afternoon. Brother Frasi Pakar's church. They had it last night in brother uh Jeanjac's church. You remember we prayed for brother Jeanjac. Isn't it marvelous? A man that was right. Just within the clutches of death, unconscious uh menitis in the brain. We talked to a nurse. We talked to a nurse over there that's actually relative. And they said that that that menitis and the fluid that was around his brain, it's it's absolutely impossible for it to dissipate within the system. Uh that that type of uh fluid that is has got menitis in it and he was completely unconscious and was that way for some time and God brought him from the doors of death. He and he stands today actually is has done some ministry gaining in his uh gaining in his strength. Nothing. If he was here today, you wouldn't you wouldn't even know that he even had that. You wouldn't even know that he was laying at death's door unconscious. You wouldn't know that. And so we're rejoicing. Brother Murphy had uh a meeting there. And then they're having uh communion Lord's table also after he preaches today in at brother France's church. And what God is doing is really really remarkable. Uh brother Murphy I emailed him and I said if you could just send me a note back and let me know how the meetings are going because they've had a very heavy schedule for him. He was at brother Gear Rudol's on Pentecost Sunday which was last I meant Monday last Monday and on Tuesday they uh he went to East Germany and had and had meeting there brought him back Wednesday and then Wednesday night he preached and I think Thursday went down to Switzerland and had service either Friday or Saturday at least Saturday and Sunday and uh he said that he was so so caught in the spirit of the meeting that He he he just was lost and after after speaking he had to sit down and said you know what has happened and uh God can take you know that God can take control of a person &gt;&gt; and so they had announced that he would give report and have the slides of China which are so so gripping and he had his computer there and he's he's he's preaching and he got caught in the spirit and uh and He he went to, you know, to begin to show the slides cuz it had even been announced. And he said it was like God said to him, "Don't you touch that button." And so he just kept preaching. And every time he tried to touch that button to start the slides and they never did show them, just uh caught in uh God, you know, God's God &gt;&gt; and he can just decide what what he wants in a meeting and he knows exactly what he wants. I want what he wants this morning. I'm not interested in anyone else re myself or anyone. We just want what God wants. &gt;&gt; We have needs. Amen. We have needs both in the congregation, outside of the congregation. We have our brother, see sister Sally Powell there, and I think of brother Edwin Dods. Uh we think of brother Tony and Rebecca also in Lebanon. We we are just thankful for not only the ministry that goes out, but we're thankful that we have a God that knows exactly what our need is. &gt;&gt; Amen. My Jesus knows &gt;&gt; just what I need. Amen. Why don't you stand with me? And I wonder if we could sing that, Brother Rod. My Jesus knows just what I need. And I'd like you to make that personal. Would you do that, please? If you'll make it personal, I'll make it personal. He knows just what I need. And then we pray, "Father, even we being mortals know how to give good gifts to our children, to our loved ones. How much more? How much more? With so much perfect wisdom, you'll give just what we need." How many here want him to do that? [Music] &gt;&gt; My Jesus knows just what I need. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he knows. He knows just what I need. be satisfied every supplies. Yes, he knows just what I need. My Jesus knows just what I need. Oh yes, he knows just what what I need. He's satisfied. And everyone [Music] just what I need. And I wonder for me if we could sing together, blessed assurance, the first verse, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine air of salvation and purchase of God. This is my story. &gt;&gt; This is my song. I I'd like you just to bring your thoughts into captivity today and say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, take control of me." Amen. That's what we have need of. Bring my spirit into control of the Holy Spirit. And then we're going to turn to the word. And before we do, I'd like to also announce not next Sunday, but the following Sunday, June the 21st, we'll also be having the Lord's table communion, footwashing on June the 21st. So just mark that on your calendar if you would, please. All right. Let's just sing this verse for me, brother. &gt;&gt; Bless Jesus Christ. Oh, our glory divine of salvation and is the God of his wash in his blood. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my This is my story. [Music] This is my song. Praising myior. [Music] Heavenly Father, we stand before you and we believe we're standing on holy ground. And we know that there are angels all around. And we know that Christ is here. We know that the presence of God by the Holy Spirit is here. And you're here, Lord, not to be idol, but to bless, to provide and prove yourself as Jehovah Gyra. Take human lips now, Lord, and speak words, utter things by the Holy Spirit, penetrating words, I pray, oh God, that will come and sink down into the deepest parts of our soul and our being. I pray you'll anoint, Lord, both speaker and the hearers in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory and your glory alone. Amen. Amen. I'm going to read from 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and uh verse 17 and 18. And tonight we're going to be favored by hearing brother Lance Laroo speak to us. Amen. It's always good to come ready and be prepared and know who to pray for. Amen. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, excuse me, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Let's read together the 18th verse, please. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. God bless you. And you may have your seats. If you would like to, please keep your Bibles handy. We'll be looking at some other scriptures as well. The things which are seen are temporal. They're enduring only for a short while. They are obviously temporary. They're for a season. Those are the things which are seen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; That's good. The things which are unseen are eternal. They're without beginning and end. and that which always has been and always will be. You have eternal life. You didn't get eternal life. You have eternal life. Have always had eternal life. At some point in time, God made you aware of it. &gt;&gt; God brought you and made you aware that you were a sinner. That Christ died for you. He was your sacrifice. that the price of and the penalty for your sin has been paid and that you are a son or daughter of God. That's what God made you to know. But you always had eternal life. In the message awakening Jesus, brother Brandham says, "The whole armor of Christianity is faith. Everything that we have is unseen." I'd like you to notice these words very, very closely. And I'd like your kind, undivided attention because you'll need to follow me very, very close this morning. Everything that we have is unseen. The only things that's real is unseen, unexplained. &gt;&gt; The things that can be explained are not real. They're superficial and die. But the things that cannot be explained are immortal. The whole realm, you know, that is such a if that's an incredibly scientific statement. If you were to go into and read what uh you know the mathematicians and the intellectuals, the Einsteins, the Stephven Hawkings and and a whole list of them and I've list I've read over, you know, over years and even more recently and even now as I was approaching this message, just reviewed and read what some of these men say. They're trying to understand the the universe and they want to try to grasp excuse me try to grasp the smallest particle and they feel if they could just discover the smallest smallest of particles then they would understand the entire universe and it it but as you read anything that they say generally speaking there's more questions that arise than even answers because they they are actually void of a of an absolute and they use the word realities uh the realities because what is a reality when they speak of the entire cosmos the entire universe uh what is real and what is not real and I want to speak on this subject of realities this morning I will be using the word many times. But now that's where brother Brown said what you see is not real. What you can explain it's it's that's that's temporary and it's a thing that can't be explained that you believe because you can believe for things &gt;&gt; that cannot be explained. &gt;&gt; You cannot understand these things that are truly realities. And I am entitling this a title that's in my heart, hungering for the realities of God. That's where I want to come from. And I I would like to think that I'm amongst a company of people today that we don't just want to know or get some more information about the realities of God. We want to be hungering for those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hungering for things that are beyond this mortal life, &gt;&gt; this beyond this temporary life, &gt;&gt; things that are a moving target. &gt;&gt; They're not eternal. &gt;&gt; And people today, we hear and perhaps you've said, "What is real? Uh, I want reality." Or we have a term, and I hear it amongst the young people, get real. You know, well, what is it that they're really saying? I I guess they want people to, you know, uh come to a a reality of of of their circumstances or their surroundings or whatever more. But the scripture tells us also Paul speaking in 1 Corinthians 7 and30. He said, "And they that weep as though they weep not, and they that rejoice as though they rejoice not, and they that buy as though they possess not." In other words, we we can be involved in things. We can be a part of things as you are. But is this life even real as far as a reality of God is concerned? And because it's a passing, because you're only passing through this season of time, this allotted time that God has given you. I would like to say that what we are mostly consumed with is not a reality. &gt;&gt; What we spend most of our time at is not a reality in the even in the scientific sense and certainly not in the spiritual sense. So is something real because I believe it. I'm just asking some questions. Is it real? Because I had what is can be termed some kind of spiritual experience. I I felt a jiggle. I got a goosebumps. I saw a flash of light. I heard a thunder or you know some physical thing happened or some emotional. I wept till I my eyes were swollen shut. Uh nothing wrong with those things. But is it a reality because I had that experience? I don't think so. Is it a reality because I changed my ways and I quit doing a whole lot of things that I began to feel guilty about and I thought was wrong and so I quit my carousing or my drinking or my smoking or things that are bad habits. I I quit those. And so I've had is that a reality? All kinds of people do that and they have all kinds of different beliefs. And so then we get to something that says what is a reality? uh a person an individual maybe has a certain experience that I oh this is so real to me but is it actually a a reality of God and then perhaps two people will agree on on a certain uh subject or a certain perception see things a certain way say well it this must be because we've agreed on it and then we could have uh a group of people a greater number of people that would assemble and began to believe along the same line and believe the same thing. And then we have a general consensus uh and and we have something now is it real? Because now there's a larger group that believe it. And so we have a a structure of belief. And for that we could say that will largely explain all the different churches and organizations and societies and and denominations and on and on. And all of them all of them believe what they believe because they believe it's the truth. And absolute truth is a reality. But there cannot be 3,000 realities. &gt;&gt; There cannot be 3,000 truths. They can say I could say there could be truth because people believe it's truth. And so from their perception we'll say all right we say it's truth plural but it is not truth singular. There can only be one truth singular. I say as a prophet of God said God is a reality &gt;&gt; not gods because there are many gods and many different beliefs in God but I'll say God whoever that God is is a reality and when God that God when he speaks and it happens that's a reality. So I'd say his word is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I say, "Now, if that God speaks and he actually comes forward and confirms that he's the one that's speaking, then we we we have a confirmation of that reality." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you might think that I'm venturing out there, but just stay with me. Now you know people have we can speak about all kinds of great names and great evangelists and great uh leaders and every organization every group got the great leaders but when you have now I've just quoted brother Brandham here I just want to say something when you have a man and I'm going to read in a little bit how the angel came to him and the simplicity of it and how difficult it was for him to believe it. Said, "You're going to stand before kings and monarchs. You're going to preach. You're going to bring a a ministry of healing." And he said it was a shock to him and it was hard for him to believe, hard for him to accept. But and then he because he said, "I don't even know how to speak. I don't know how to I only have a grade seven education. I don't know how to present. I don't know how to put words together. I don't know how to bring my thoughts out and I speak so halting and so on. Those aren't exactly his words, but that's essentially what he said. And he said, "How is this going to be?" And the angel of God, who is the angel of the Lord, none other than the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, said, "I will be with you. Have no fear. I'll be with you." Then he said, "Then I'll go." Now then you have the opportunity to sit and you listen and hear a man speak. And here we are today and I'm really laying this down to your address. You're either here as a you know just a uh because my friends are here. I'm here because my parents are here. I'm here because somebody's here. I'm here because you know this is where I always go. I've been here for years. But if we're not here because you believe it's truth, &gt;&gt; then you're in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; We need a reality of truth. &gt;&gt; And so when I hear a man who confesses, I speak with such halting English. I don't know proper words. I don't know how to put the things together. But then when he speaks it is it is almost like uh it it it fits into phrases that he makes fits into the scientific realm. Phrases that he makes fits into the medical realm fits into all kinds of the realms of the intellectual people. But then he says now &gt;&gt; if the God &gt;&gt; if God if I have told the truth &gt;&gt; not truths plural but if I have spoken the truth then let that God come now and prove that that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And on one occasion if you haven't if you haven't seen the DVD of the interview that we have with with Mr. Mitchell. Uh, I know Mr. Mitchell. He's passed on now. I know Mr. Mitchell. I've got the quote here. I'm going to read it, Lord willing, later on. But I interviewed him in Roman Oak, West Virginia at the television station. And we sat down and uh uh he began to tell he had never heard of Brother Brandham. He never heard of William Brham. He is a mine worker. He worked in the mines in Virginia. and uh and then he he he got a a a tumor in his lung the size of a man's fist and they had him to Bristol and to two other hospitals and they confirmed that tumor and said that and and then the mining company want to know what kind of liability they had with this man's situation and they uh sent him to these various hospitals three of them and said that tumor has to come out immediately. And he said, "Uh, well, just wait." And his pastor, who was Brother Ernest Fulture at that time, or his friend, Brother Fulture knew of Brother Brandham, and he said, "I'll take you down there." And so, he doesn't even know where he's going. And they take him. And Brother Fulture drives him to Jeffersonville. And brother Brandham is preaching this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. And that man is sitting down in the down in the auditorium in the church there. And brother Brandham preaches this day is this scripture. And he takes it back to when Jesus read certain scripture. And now he's declaring that that same Jesus is present now again revealing himself. And he begins to speak and he says this day, it comes to the end of the service. They had no prayer cards. This day is the scripture. He said, "Let the God &gt;&gt; that spoke the word, &gt;&gt; let the God that brought the message, if he be God, let him go, let him come forth now." &gt;&gt; And he does. &gt;&gt; And he calls this man out. And he says, "There's a man there." And you have a uh you have been a mind worker. And the reason and that is so profound to me because he had been a mind worker. He was a mind worker. But from that time on he became a pastor of a church. And how accurate and how how marvelous it was that God begins to speak. You have been a mind worker. See, God doesn't only know what you wear. He knows what you're going to be. Amen. And he says, "You have been a mind worker." And he said, "You have a tumor and it's in your left lung." And he told them all about and he says, "Go back to Virginia, Mr. Mitchell, &gt;&gt; and be well." And the man went back to the same hospitals and they couldn't find that tumor with the X-rays. And he's standing right there. Now I tell you what friends, now you have, now you have not a scientist, &gt;&gt; not a scientist, not one who's trying to figure out, you know, the the influence of the quarks on things and has has reduced things down to the most uh minute particle and beyond what even can be seen because they say they can't see quirs. They can only see their influence on other on other material and they're trying to determine gravity and and the how light curves and one effect and all the planetary system and if they could figure that out then they they figure then we can discover what the true reality is. What is the reality in these things? I say we have discovered not because I'm saying it. It's not truth because I say it. It's truth because God confirmed it. &gt;&gt; What tells this man, there's a man there with a tumor in his lung and he's from Virginia and he has been a mine worker and he's going to go home and you're going to be well. That's an absolute. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is his name Mitchell? Yes. Does he have a tumor? Yes. But but the tumor is not a reality. Your sickness is not a reality. &gt;&gt; Because the reality does away with the sickness. &gt;&gt; Our mortality is not a reality. Your life here is not a reality. Because it's not absolute. It's passing. You are a moving target. You're only here for a season. Everything you touch is only for a season. I'm here to declare today, these things are not realities. That's why natural and mortal things and and the things of this life can never satisfy you. &gt;&gt; One person is strong and healthy and handsome and uh maybe a young lady has got her youth and she's beautiful. Forget it. It's a moving target. If time goes on, you're going to be gray-haired and and you're going to be stooped over and your breath's going to come short on you because it's not a reality. &gt;&gt; The things which are seen are temporal. &gt;&gt; And the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to be consumed with things that are eternal. I think that we ought to have our minds on where we're going, &gt;&gt; not where we are today. &gt;&gt; Reality. They say that a reality is the state of things as they actually exist. You say, well, here I am. This is the, you know, this is the order of things in my life. This is what I'm facing. This is where I work. Your profession is not a reality. &gt;&gt; Your life here is not a reality. &gt;&gt; A reality is what is real and what is actual fact and what is truth. A reality is the aggregate sum of real things. Could be the total sum of real things. Listen to this now. A reality is the substance that lies back of form and external appearances. So here we are now. We are here in our appearance. We have a certain physical appearance and you may feel very real but that appearance is not a reality. There is a substance which lies behind the form which you are just projecting. There's an unseen that is in you. That is why the prophet of God says we have never seen one another. &gt;&gt; You only see the physical external appearance that declares the person &gt;&gt; but you have never seen the person. We have never met one another. Never seen one another. We have met, shook hands, perhaps embraced whatever more, married, have children and all the rest of it. But you have never seen each other, &gt;&gt; the real person. &gt;&gt; And that is why regardless of even how long you've lived together and how close you may become as husband and wife or as a family member or in the church as a church member, you never really have seen one another and cannot fully fully there. There's a restriction. You can't fully describe and say everything that's in the inner person because that inner person's even a mystery to you. in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God, it came from the eternal God. &gt;&gt; And I hope it doesn't offend you or surprise you if I say there's much of humanity that are passing over the earth like waves of the sea that is not a reality. They appear. What is your life? It's even as a vapor &gt;&gt; that appears for a little while &gt;&gt; and then vanishes. &gt;&gt; What is your life? That's what the God word says in in James gospel. A reality therefore is the absolute. And also in the encyclopedia it says that it is that which is selfexistent. How many times have we heard the messenger say that God Jehovah almighty God is the self-existent one who fills all time and space. He's the self-existent one. He is a reality. And when out of his bosom comes the word of God, the logos of God, the very logos which is a part of him. That is a reality. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, &gt;&gt; the scripture says, "And God said, let there be light. The the reality was speaking." &gt;&gt; And God created a heavens and an earth by the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was a reality. But then by sin, everything fell. &gt;&gt; The creation was lost. &gt;&gt; Man's fellowship with God was lost. And man lost his way. And now the reality was gone. &gt;&gt; If you can follow me, the scripture, I'm just going to leave that for a moment. The scripture says, "Now faith, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of things that are not seen. &gt;&gt; Faith, in other words, is a uh it is a channel. Faith is the six sense. Faith can reach out into the unknown. Faith can reach out and believe that which is not seen. Faith can reach out and take a hold of that which cannot be comprehended with your mind and it can bring it down and can be seen. &gt;&gt; I hunger &gt;&gt; for the realities of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in religion. I'm not interested in church anity. I'm not interested even in this church. I'm interested in the realities of God. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in people that hunger for the realities of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in human baggage. I'm not interested in that which accumulates in this life. &gt;&gt; Be they possessions or be they uh achievements &gt;&gt; or some great uh fame and goal, we're not interested in it. Whatever God gives you, you hold it loosely in your hand. &gt;&gt; If he gives you little, you thank him. If he gives you much, you thank him. But you don't hang. You don't hold it. You don't grip it and hold it like that's a reality. It's not. &gt;&gt; We came into the world with nothing and we leave with nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not real. Friends, &gt;&gt; you that are in hardships right now, let me tell you, your hardship is not a reality. &gt;&gt; I can say this too shall pass. &gt;&gt; How can it pass? Because it's not a reality. You that are in the good times and you're having the good life, let me tell you that's not a reality. &gt;&gt; I say that with all the authority of God's word. It's not a reality. The good life is not a reality. The bad life is not a reality. &gt;&gt; They're passing. &gt;&gt; There's something in the human heart that hungers for simplicity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When brother Murphy showed the slides of China and he showed this one woman and this one woman was searching and she wanted she'd heard something about this message, an elderly woman and she told her daughter, "Get on the internet and search and find out where this message come from and this prophet of God and I need to discover more. And anyway, the girl found on internet site, found our website, our Chinese website, and she got some messages. And then that woman witnessed to another one and another one, another one, and a short few months down the road, here's a group of women. They're poor, extremely poor. And brother Murphy was just he wasn't he wasn't making any specific point. He was just saying this is the group of a year or so later. He says and they're 99% widows. They're just by themselves in this village. They're 99% povertystricken. They get about $100 a month in some kind of a pension. And Murphy says he doesn't even know how they survive buying food on $100 a month. And he says, "And yet when they had this meeting just recently, the first time they had a meeting in China with no outside minister didn't call Murphy, didn't call anyone else. And they said, "We want this to be a made in China meeting. This is by the Chinese and for the Chinese." And so they had this gathering for the first time and groups of people came and workers and ministers and as you know everything has to be on a very small scale little house meetings and so on so forth and they gathered a group of people there. These women contacted I guess brother Murphy and the brothers over there and said we have put together we have saved our money and we've saved $2,000 that we want to contribute. We want to be blessed also. They said, &gt;&gt; "We just don't want foreigners to be blessed. We don't want others to be just blessed. We must have a blessing. And we want this to go to get this same message, which we love, to get it to other Chinese and other remote places and sent $2,000." There were brothers that sitting in Germany came to me and said when they showed those slides and we heard and saw the sincerity of the people said we were stunned I could never be the same one brother said to me a businessman there's something in us that when we see that kind of simplicity we even see that what we would call poverty, extreme poverty. They have it's like nothing. It becomes nothingness. And when we say that there's something down in the inner being that craves that kind of simplicity. And when we see those kind of people that don't have access to, you know, the medical clinic and this specialist and that one and can go down to the emergency and show their card or whatever more, have the state or whatever more and and can get access to right away medical treatment and so on. And they don't have that. They have a simplicity. This is what God said &gt;&gt; and this is what God did &gt;&gt; and this is what the Bible says &gt;&gt; and God can't lie. &gt;&gt; And so we and it just says do this and so we'll do that. Just lay hands on someone. So we'll lay hands on them and it'll all be over. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It works. Amen. &gt;&gt; What has happened is faith &gt;&gt; has taken a hold &gt;&gt; of the realities of God and brought it down into this realm. &gt;&gt; And thus they have it. And that's why we look at it and we say that simplicity is wonderful because there's something within our own being that craves and desires that &gt;&gt; and that goes way beyond. We're not worried about how the piano sounded or how the music or how the how the deacons were or how the temperature was in the church. Doesn't make any difference. Maybe you're sitting on a little plastic. Maybe you're sitting on a mat or like it was in India or we were in even in New Delhi, India and everybody had wool parkers on and and and were blankets around them and sitting on the concrete floor and it couldn't hardly move in there. It was so cold, so frigid. And while you're while I was preaching preaching then all the lights go out and it's total blackness. You think anybody left or anybody made light of it? No. They were just sitting there waiting hungering waiting for the rest of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And there's something in us that hungers for that simplicity. &gt;&gt; Because we can find in that realm it it seems that we have a a clearer channel for our faith to work. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we get into this cluttered life, &gt;&gt; do you call it that? Is that all right? This cluttered life, this uh life that's filled with so many labors and so many concerns and so much confusion and crosscurrens of every direction. It's hard to find the channel. But oh my brother, my sister, I want you to agree with me today. God, open up that channel. I hunger for the realities of God. Faith is the substance &gt;&gt; and the substance is that which has foundation. The substance is that which is firm. The substance is that which actually exists. &gt;&gt; And that's what the scientists say a reality is is something that actually exists. Faith is the substance. Faith is that which actually exists. In other words, I say faith is either the reality or will bring the reality to you. &gt;&gt; By faith, we move from the negative to the positive. &gt;&gt; By faith, we move from that which is temporal and passing &gt;&gt; to that which is eternal &gt;&gt; and lasting. By faith &gt;&gt; we pass from the from the seen to the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know this is hard because you know we speak about these things and I know that you know you mothers and you've got families, you've got children, you've got concerns and you you know we've got activities and schools and and we've got uh meetings and we have all kinds of home life that we daily life that we need to look after. But let me take you into the scripture just briefly for a moment. You know what is really number one needs to be number one on our agenda and that is that you recognize the person of Jesus Christ presently. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is number one. Thank you for your amen brother. When Jesus was here, they had their concerns. They had their families. They had their jobs, their loss of jobs. They had their fish. The nets were broken. They were mending their nets. They had their old parents to care for. They had all their concerns. They had to buy things. They had to feed people. Those people, they had to wash. They had to sleep someplace. They had they had their natural burdens. The scripture says very little about it because it's not a reality. &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't say don't don't pay any attention to that. Don't have it, you know, don't do that. You don't have to care for that. Of course, they had to care for that. But the key question was when Jesus finally said to them, who do men say I am? &gt;&gt; And who do you say I am? And the prophet comes in his days and says, "Who do you say this is?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "Who who is this Melkazedc?" &gt;&gt; He says, "What shall I do with this Jesus called Christ?" &gt;&gt; What is the whole message? The whole the whole uh the whole out of the message is that it's not Christ back in the Bible 2,000 years ago. It's Christ now. And who do you say this is? In other words, who have you recognized? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is it that you're feeling? Because that's the only reality that we actually have. &gt;&gt; That's what substance real substance. &gt;&gt; That's what's not passing away. &gt;&gt; That's what's eternal. &gt;&gt; So I got this certain achievement or I I I you know I was successful here or I was a failure there. the failure or the success. In my books, according to the message that I'm speaking to you this morning, neither is a reality. &gt;&gt; I failed my grades. Maybe your parents are displeased with you or I got straight A's. Wonderful. And I pray that you I I feel we need to do our best. And whatever we do, we should do it as unto the Lord. We should do it as a real Christian. What I'm speaking today is is not uh uh forgetting that we have a a natural life but what it is saying we have friends and I have to say it far too much emphasis on this life. It fills our conversation. &gt;&gt; And when you think of it according to the word of God, &gt;&gt; when you speak about this life and all the activities and all the things, just remember Apostle Paul's words. It is not eternal. &gt;&gt; It is temporal. &gt;&gt; It is passing. And it will leave your hands. It will leave your mind. It will leave your life because it is not a reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are a number of places in the message brother Brandham talks about the word and the word the word which is a reality the word materialized. So then it became physical &gt;&gt; or became it became something that was visible. It came down into this realm. And that's why I believe that science is still trying attempting to understand the realities in the creation. And I tend to believe that the word of God and what the word brings is the only substance and is the only reality and substance or material things can only testify to the word &gt;&gt; for an allotted time. I'm only here, you're only here. We have an allotted period of time and you're going to testify to something and one day if time should go on there'll be a marker on your grave &gt;&gt; saying whatever year you started to the year you ended that'll be it. &gt;&gt; May you rest in peace. May you go on to his reward and somebody will get up and say some nice things about you. But if in this life that God has allotted us so much space of time, the greatest thing that we could do is to give expression to something that is actually a reality. &gt;&gt; And that is why I'm speaking about what a reality is and what a reality isn't. And I hope you don't think I wear the word out. Please, here's a little what the what some of the wise people say I guess about this. The term reality in its widest sense, this is what people who have a lot more human wisdom than I say about it. The term reality in its widest sense includes everything that is whether or not it is observable or comprehensible. Whether you can see it or you can't see it. The term reality in its widest or broadest sense includes everything that can be observed or whether it's not observable or comprehensible. The term reality is real existence actual being or existence as opposed to an imaginary mere appearance. You know when I say imaginary. Hey, churches across this land are absolutely packed with people and they are absolutely convinced &gt;&gt; that they're believing the truth. Many are absolutely convinced they have eternal life. They are convinced even though they may believe in a trinity which they cannot explain and it's something out there uh that has come down been filtered down through all the church ages uh a a baptism that is not in the scriptures and they'll hang on to that. How can it be a reality? How can baptism be a reality of father, son, and holy ghost? They say, "Well, Jesus said it." Isn't it amazing that Jesus said it and told Apostle Peter that I give you the keys to the kingdom? And Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost, full of the Holy Spirit, which is the very spirit of Jesus Christ, and goes directly against what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; If you believe a trinity doctrine, Baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost. How can intelligence people say the word the first word in the name and say well isn't it natural to say what is the name? &gt;&gt; What is the name of the father? What is the name of the son? What is the name of the holy ghost? Father, son, and holy ghost is the lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now if we don't grasp that, I want you to stay with me now. If we don't grasp that, if the words, if Jesus was the word made flesh and he spoke directly out, the word speaking directly out, I'd say that the life of Christ was the only reality on earth at that time. And what he spoke and what his word brought forth also is a reality. &gt;&gt; And it says it's a imaginary as opposed to imaginary or mere appearance. All that exists or happens. Everything that actually does or could exist or happen in real life speaking. This is what the world is saying. A a reality is in proof of the resurrection. Now to comprehend says what that can be comprehended. The human mind can't comprehend spiritual things. &gt;&gt; The human mind can't comprehend it. &gt;&gt; I mean understand it fully. So we see it out there and and it it brother Brandon brings it this way. It it comes into the mind but then it has to fall down into the heart. Says there's one channel to the soul and in that channel we either believe or we disbelieve. &gt;&gt; If we disbelieve it's it it cannot be a reality. If we believe that faith can bring us &gt;&gt; to a re a real experience. So in proof of his resurrection, brother Brandham says, "So in order to get the truth to man to God, God sent his own son made in likeness of sinful flesh and he was born here on earth. And he was a propitiation for our sins, offered up at the day of Calvary to take away our sins and to give us liberty and to set us free from the prison houses that we've been in. Now man is a prisoner. God said that a man was a prisoner. So until something has happened to the man I he said and he says now I want you to get this now &gt;&gt; that before this certain thing called the new birth. So before this certain thing called the new birth ever happens to the man, he can he cannot no way at all understand or ever understand God &gt;&gt; or have any knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; Listen now. Though the word speaks it, his mind can't comprehend it. I can tell you friends, brother Brandham is actually speaking scientific language &gt;&gt; and that you can hear it and then you imagine now here I'm speaking today and all this group of people here you know one sitting right next to another the reason why what we receive is not a reality just through the hearing of the ears is because your perception one person's perception of what I say oh they're getting this next person sitting right beside them oh it's this way it's this way. &gt;&gt; But when when what is spoken for faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God, faith cometh by hearing. And so a person hears the word of God and by faith they lay hold of that even though they can't comprehend it completely and their mind is unfruitful in their understanding. They say, "I know God said that. That's God's word. God has proven that." And that faith reaches a hold of it and brings it down to you. And now you have a reality. &gt;&gt; That is why two people can come in. You know the night I gave my life to Christ, my best friend was right beside me. We did everything together. Within one week, I was still hungering for God. Within one week, he was at a dance and in the arms of some girl. &gt;&gt; And as months went by, he continued that direction. We were such close buddies. We lived together, roommed together. We had all of our enjoyment together. And at 35 years old, he was built he was built like a wrestler. Just an incredibly strong. At 15 years old, he was carrying green railroad ties and loading them. At 15 years old, he was so strong. He was very quiet. And he used to say, he said, "You do the talking and I'll hit them." to anybody he had, I'd feel sorry for them. It just real quiet. Became a truck driver. Came home at one evening and uh his wife or the woman he had or whatever it was uh he she said, "Well, I'll fix you something to eat." And he just he said, "Well, I'm not too hungry." He had a sandwich and just went up and laid on the sofa and his heart just stopped. 35 in a prime of health. His heart just stopped. I talked to his brother after they did an autopsy and the doctor said there was nothing wrong. His heart just stopped. I've always been very thankful for the grace of God that the next week I kept hungering for the realities of God. Your life here is very uncertain. You think you have it and you you've got plans. And I'm here to announce to you today, it is not. This life is not a reality. &gt;&gt; This life is real. It's not real. And when it passes and when you pass from it and then we enter into the place that God has ordained, the Bible also tells us of the rewards that God has given or God has promised rewards. We want to live a life and uh brother Brandham said we should be thinking about that. So he said here that we can't comprehend it because it's a human mind. He's got to have the mind of God in him to understand godly things. &gt;&gt; In God's covenant with Abraham, he said, "It's such a little thing. How little finite minds can try to comprehend the infinite mind of God." &gt;&gt; I think we need a balance. We do need a balance between this life, this world and the world to come. I think we need to have a balance between the needs of this natural life as it relates to daily life and the fullness of the life to come because the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Are we all right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was speaking of uh in the unfailing realities of the living God and he said there's so many precious brethren here and uh that we are grateful to God that has given given the Holy Ghost to these various brethren. He said and it's begin to be a talk among us. They're in their local church said it's begin to be a talk about among us. Oh my, it revive us to a spot that we'll go to searching, hungering, &gt;&gt; and pulling for the realities of God. God is a reality. &gt;&gt; So he was speaking, here's people here and there's a reviving going on and they're, you know, we're speaking about the infilling of the Holy Spirit and he said it set up a a a movement. And it set up a a revival amongst them to the spot where we are searching and hungering and pulling for the realities of God. And and God is a reality. And I said as I read that, I said, "God, let this congregation of Cloverdale Bible Way. Let them leave this building this morning. And I pray that you will be uh so gripped that your mind will be consumed not with the burdens of this life. We can be consumed with that. &gt;&gt; We can be consumed with all of the things of this life, but let us be consumed with the things which are unseen, the things which are realities, or consumed with that which will bring us to the reality. Brother Brandham speaks of God allowing his son and permitting him to hang between heaven and earth. And he said in the message, "Go tell my disciples, hanging there between heaven and earth, crying." Think of it now. Crying, "I thirst. I thirst, he says. And he even turned water to wine. The very creator of water standing there screaming for water. &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus could look at the suffering of the cross &gt;&gt; with joy. &gt;&gt; Because he saw what it would attain. &gt;&gt; He saw what it was going to do. He saw that this purpose of his life, he came to be a redeemer and he'd be doing the redeeming act right there. And that the cross was not a reality. It was just there for time. The suffering was not a reality. It was just for a moment of time. And this is what I must do because I am claiming a reality. I'm purchasing a people. I'm purchasing my own my bride uh the body of Jesus Christ. I'm purchasing them. And so with joy, he went to the cross because the cross was not the reality. &gt;&gt; What he was purchasing you &gt;&gt; that are seated here today purchasing you &gt;&gt; a reality. &gt;&gt; And so we as his body do not want to become consumed. Quite a number of you are being you have graduated and you're we'll have graduating ceremonies and different things taking place and gatherings. Don't call them a party if you have a gathering. So we want to gather and I want to thank God that he allowed me to live. &gt;&gt; I want to thank God for the testimony he allowed me to leave. Some of those kids I'll maybe never see again. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Some of some of my girls went to I think a 20 or 25 year celebration. Young men and young ladies and one young man walked up. He's not young anymore. Baldhead had lost most of his hair and put on a lot of weight. and another lady, one of the girls they went to school with. You know what the question was? Are you still the same? &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; Are you still the same? &gt;&gt; I had a preacher's daughter. I lived in her home as a vagabond kid as I was shuffled from place to place. I hardly knew sometime where I was going to be staying. And I was staying in this preacher's home and he had five children. I'm talking about real things, friends, &gt;&gt; but not realities. This is passing. &gt;&gt; And she decided to the world was what she wanted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she lived in the world and enjoyed life. lived in the Okonogan over here. Went down into the on the US side to a dance to have a great time and coming back. She's in the back seat and the the car left the road and passed right through a high tension telephone pole, took about a 5-ft section of the pole out, went into a farmer's orchard, flipped over on its lid, and she's thrown out of the car, part out of the car, and part of her body, lower body's in the car. And I don't know what happened to the two in the front seat. And they didn't find them for several hours because they were down over this embankment and couldn't be seen from the road. They finally found her. She was a young girl. She was just in her 20s. She was beautiful. But from that day on, she walked on two crutches like this the rest of her days and committed suicide here in New Westminster. jumped out of a building, a preacher's daughter that I lived I lived in their home. Say, is this the kind of story? This is this is what happened. And I look at that and I can tell you her life. She says, you know, I'm going to live this kind of life. That's not a reality. There's nothing real about it. People think I'm having real fun. I'm having You're not having real fun. That devil's got plans for you. He's got plans to ring every ounce of life out of you. He's got plans to send you to hell. &gt;&gt; That's his plan. That's his program. &gt;&gt; And did she hear the gospel? Thousands of words of the gospel. Thousands of realities. &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; but failed to give herself to it. Brother Brandham says that the new earth will put on its new Eden again. We're going green, so we can have a whole lot less pollution in the air. We're going green. I talked to someone the other day, Brother Andrew. It was you, I believe, and he's in a Starbucks or someplace and having a cup of coffee and they got a wooden stick. You might say, "Is this a gospel?" This is right in line with what I'm preaching. And uh so he's stirring is stirring his coffee with the stick and a woman right next to him says, "Well, let me use your stick for saving trees. And then you open up your newspaper and you got a you got a you got a goodsized tree right there in the advertising &gt;&gt; and throw it in the garbage. &gt;&gt; We're saving trees. I tell you, God's going to save the trees. &gt;&gt; God is making, he says in the closing of the scripture, "Behold, I make a new heaven. and a new earth &gt;&gt; for the old earth &gt;&gt; which has been is passed away. &gt;&gt; And God will destroy those who destroy the earth according to the scripture. I tell you, God is going to go green. &gt;&gt; God's the one who's going to restore it back again. And when Jesus hung between heaven and earth and his blood spilled on the earth and he was crying out, "I thirst. I thirst. The creator of the tree that he hung on. &gt;&gt; The creator of the iron that was in the nails. The creator of the air he was breathing and his lungs crying out, "I thirst. I thirst. Father, forgive them. They don't know what they do." And his blood spilling to the ground. He was claiming this earth. &gt;&gt; He was claiming for you a reality. You'll have a new heaven and a new earth to dwell on. And oh friends, friends, I'm not just enthused about this. I am so I'm so happy. I'm so inspired because there's something deep within me that tells me uh although I'm not worthy that purchase of his blood is taking me to that and that life is a reality &gt;&gt; and that's what we have to be looking towards and that's what we have to be spending our life &gt;&gt; towards. &gt;&gt; Help me. I'm trying to move through here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says, "When Christ came to become man here on earth and to be a kinsman redeemer, he redeemed man. To everything he lost in the fall, Christ restored it to him in the kinsman redeemership. Everything the human race lost in Adam was redeemed when Christ, God himself, became kinfolk with the human race and redeemed it back to his maker. All that was lost, he redeemed back again. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that Calvary wasn't a reality. &gt;&gt; That was a reality. &gt;&gt; One of the greater realities of God. and a new earth will put on its Eden beauty again. So I say the world that Jesus came to and was in and lived in and that's why he didn't he didn't he didn't put any emphasis on it because it wasn't real. He said, "Then sin and suffering, listen to what the prophet of God declares. Sin and suffering and everything must come to a place where it has no existence." &gt;&gt; Sin and suffering must come to a place where it has no existence. And even science will tell you a reality is that which exists. And a prophet of God is declaring in scientific language sin and suffering. Think of all the suffering of humanity. Sin and suffering must come to a place of non-existence. &gt;&gt; You might be sick here. &gt;&gt; You might be afflicted. You might have some some hurt. You might have some pain. You might have some inner turmoil. You might have something that you say, "Oh, God, when when will this end?" I can tell you one thing. It is not a reality. And that too shall pass because only that which is eternal that cannot pass into that land where there will be no sin, &gt;&gt; no death, no crying, no tears, no pain, no suffering. That is a place that he came and purchased. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He said because it had a beginning. There was a time when there was no sickness, no sin, no sorrow, no death, and then it came by perversion. So all the perversion must end. &gt;&gt; And all that has had had the was at the beginning has to end so that the eternal can ever exist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that you can as as I studied this, friends, I became so gripped. I had to come out and talk to my wife because I just had to declare all of these things, these things that we become, you know, that are that uh uh possess our our mind and our being and our concerns and these burdens and and whatever more. These things are not reality. &gt;&gt; They're not real. So it's not real but it's sure &gt;&gt; sure on my mind &gt;&gt; the things which are seen are temporal. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's the reason it's totally impossible for any person to ever be saved outside of the new birth because men are born again of the spirit of God and become a part of God. &gt;&gt; Their existence is eternal as God is eternal. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Their existence &gt;&gt; is eternal. There's a part of you, my brother, my sister, and all that are streaming. Let me tell you, there's a part of you that has an existence. And I can say concerning that existence, it's as eternal as God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. People who study and practice yoga, they will tell you that you know uh just in my language that they try and get in contact with the universe and and somehow feel the vibrations and moving through their body and they talk about a consciousness and and and and it's semi quasi spiritual language but it's not a reality because it's it's from the human perspective and but they do speak about the, you know, the great and about God and and so on and so forth. But I tell you what, friends, you say, "I'm not ridiculing them. I'm not even speaking negatively about them. I can only tell you that they need and they have all kinds of prophets. There's prophets. The Muhammadans have a prophet. Mormons have a prophet. All kinds of people in India have prophets. They've had all kinds of prophets that have walked over there. Israel has prophets. But I can tell you a prophet, the only one I'm interested in that can say, "Thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; and let the God who spoke the word, and if he said, if I have told you the truth, let that God come forth now &gt;&gt; and prove that he is God." &gt;&gt; Friends, I trust that's why you're in this meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And humanly speaking and spiritually speaking and if you're even a thinking person, that is the first time you have a person that's actually bringing bringing on the scene an absolute &gt;&gt; and an absolute is a reality. &gt;&gt; And so now here a prophet is standing. I'm only using one example of literally thousands. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just before brother Brand calls Mr. Mitchell out, he says, "There's another man." Another man was sitting right there. He said, "And and you got you're real nervous." He said, "You got a trouble in your throat." That didn't sound like something profound, but he says, "The reason why is because you're a minister." And he says, "And you feel real nervous right now. And the reason why you're nervous is because you have an appointment and you got to get out of this meeting and get to that appointment." Listen, friends. And your name, Reverend Mr. Smith, go now. Now we have a reality. &gt;&gt; Now we have an absolute. And that is why the messenger said so many times, is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if that's the truth. Because the truth is an absolute. &gt;&gt; That was God's channel for bringing a reality to a person who's experienced something that's not real. &gt;&gt; Say, "What do you mean? I'm sick with cancer. I'm dying. The doctor said, "I haven't got I haven't got a hope to live." And that's not a reality. No, it's not a reality because it's passing. &gt;&gt; But if you believe God's word, you can reach through by faith. &gt;&gt; I I've run out of time and I have pages left. I'll have to take probably another service. But that the scripture says the uh message of heroes of faith in the 11th chapter of Hebrews starts out by saying faith is the substance of things hoped for. It is the substance of things hoped for. And then it goes on and says through faith through faith we understand that the worlds were formed &gt;&gt; through faith. Because in the very beginning it says, "And God said," Brother Brandham says, "And God said, let there be light." If a fog came, it wasn't God speaking. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; If God says something, then it has to happen that way. Let the earth bring forth. And it did. &gt;&gt; Let the waters bring forth. And it did. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the reality was speaking. And then the external came on the scene that we could see and we could touch in our senses. That which your senses declare is not a reality. Said, "Well, I saw it with my eyes." People asked me when I saw it. The pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord came right into the car. Said, "Did you see it?" I said, "No, if I could, I wouldn't have believed it &gt;&gt; because my eyes, your eyes have not been given you to declare spiritual things." &gt;&gt; But in your soul, you have a realm that can believe God. &gt;&gt; And faith is not an emotion. Faith is a quiet conviction of the truth. &gt;&gt; God said it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. And that settles it. &gt;&gt; That's faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a feeling. You don't have to have a jiggle. You don't have to have a goosebump. You don't have to have a chill down your spine. You simply have to have a confession out of your mouth. God spoke that &gt;&gt; and I believe what he said &gt;&gt; and he confirmed it by a messenger in this hour. And we've seen it happen. And I know that it's God's word. &gt;&gt; So through faith and by faith Abel and by faith Enoch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by faith Noah &gt;&gt; and by faith Abraham &gt;&gt; and by faith he sojourned. &gt;&gt; And through faith also Sarah received. And these all died in the faith. By faith Abraham again. By faith Isaac. By faith Jacob. By faith, Joseph. By faith, Moses. By faith, he forsook Egypt. Through faith, he kept the Passover. By faith, they passed through the Red Sea. By faith, the walls of Jericho came down. By faith, the the harlot Rahab. And I say, by faith, a bride of Jesus Christ has risen up in Leodysia. By faith, we heard the word. By faith, we have accepted it. We have believed it and it is that belief that's made the change. &gt;&gt; We don't say we have a reality because I believe we don't have a reality because I had a change. That's not the proof of a reality. That's what I said. Many people change. Many people start a good life. &gt;&gt; My wife's daddy in his early days and a young man, he liked to gamble. So he was gambling and they smoked and drank and whatever more and he's gambling starting out a young businessman and uh the two older children than my wife she's the youngest. So his son and daughter came down in the morning and said what what was going on last night? What was that racket? He just said that's it. He was a very strong willed man. That was end. No more gambling. No more crowing in the house cuz my his family was first. That's end. End of it. Was that a reality? No. Wasn't a reality. He just said, "My kids don't need that kind of a home. They don't need that kind of a life and I'm quitting." Some people say, "You know what? I'm killing myself with these cigarettes. I'm going to quit." So they quit. That's not reality. They just did it for their health. &gt;&gt; But then the next person hears the word of God. They actually hear the word of God. They don't know what the changes are going to be. &gt;&gt; The changes aren't even in their mind. They just hear the word of God. They know God is speaking to my soul. &gt;&gt; And they know I hunger for this kind of life. I can't comprehend it. I can't understand it. It desire it. [Applause] I don't know where it'll take me. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it'll cost in my life, but that isn't even in my mind. I hunger for these things. &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation, I see one after the other after the other all across this congregation who left the most beloved loved ones &gt;&gt; because they were separated from them by accepting and receiving the word of the Lord in this hour. And then they believed that and that spirit came upon the word they believed. &gt;&gt; The light sprung forth and changes begin to happen. &gt;&gt; Those changes are a reality &gt;&gt; because they came by the word of God. &gt;&gt; The change was a result. The change was not a cause. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The change is a result. Amen. &gt;&gt; So by faith and by faith the Bible says that they obtained a good report. And I'm going to just close now. I have a little thing I want to read for you. This is in when brother Brandham spoke these words. He had he had uh maybe four four more hours of life that he preaching life that he was going to preach. This is in things that are to be. Things that are to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "We build a hospital. It's ever so good." That's fine. Talked about building schools, building hospitals. He said that was not the program. We build a hospital that's ever so good in practice with the best medicine we got and thousands die in it daily. But oh my, in the kingdom of God, there is no death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no sorrow. Amen. There's no need for these things of the world. But we've passed &gt;&gt; from this thing into the realities of God. &gt;&gt; Said, "They're all right, but we've passed from this." Not that we don't not that there's anything negative about a hospital or a school or those things. Those are part of this life. They're part of, you know, part of our daily movement through this life. But we need to see ourselves in a whole different light. We need to see ourselves as passing through. &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up &gt;&gt; somewhere. &gt;&gt; They say beyond the blue. And then he says, we've passed from this thing into the realities of God where we struggle so hard to try to find through science and more scientific we get, the more death we bring on ourselves. We're fighting a losing battle there. So turn loose of it. This is my concluding &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; phrase to you today. Turn loose of it and by faith &gt;&gt; believe Jesus Christ, the son of God tonight and accept him. He's the one. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look where Jesus sits on the right hand of God tonight, ever living to make intercession on our confession of what we believe his word to be the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I'm I'm not believing this message because uh there was nothing else to believe. I'm not believing it because my mind said, you know what, that sounds all right. Or that sounds reasonable. Why are you believing it? Well, I'll tell you what, friends. There's many times perhaps we would have chosen if if it had been up to us, we said, you know what? I'm going to live an I want an easier life. I want an easier life. We haven't been called to a picnic. &gt;&gt; We've been called to a battle. &gt;&gt; A battle royal. &gt;&gt; A a real mortal struggle. &gt;&gt; That's what we've been called to. In fact, as we've been called to, it's not easy to just keep looking to the unseen. Oh my, I mean, you know, I could even just start preaching now, but it's 20 to1. And I want to close right away. A Abraham, the Bible says that they looked to the unseen. Moses, he looked to the unseen. I mean, these are men that were not even going to they were not even going to physically materially inherit what was promised to them. &gt;&gt; Says, "I give you this land." Abraham never got the land. How would you like to be called to something and never actually obtain it and never get it in your hands and live your entire life that way? That's the faith of Abraham. And because Abraham had that kind of trust, that kind of faith, God said, "You're my friend." &gt;&gt; That's worth a whole lifetime. That's worth a whole lifetime of struggle. Have God come down and say, "You're my friend. You believed me." &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with this material thing. They had struggles and arguments with with uh, you know, Lot servants and and all kinds of things and other armies that were around. That's just a part of life. We have that. &gt;&gt; I pray that today, this is my earnest desire that something has been said that causes you to have clarity of sight and an inner vision that will see those things that are actually real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those things that actually do exist. your life, &gt;&gt; your body, your theophony, &gt;&gt; your home. As brother Tom preached on Wednesday night, and I so enjoyed the service, this land is your land. &gt;&gt; This is your place. I go to prepare a place for you. And there has to be and my whole purpose of this message this morning, church, Cloverdale Bible Way, you people that come here, you come here Sunday morning to hear the word of God. And by God's help and grace, I've sought with everything that's in me to bring the word that God would have you here today. Do not go from this place and let Satan through the world. This is Satan's Eden dictate everything to you. Uh, you know, he'll tell you, you know, how much time you have for your family and where you're going to go and what you're going to do and everything else and just keep keep you on his treadmill. It'd be nice to announce to him, you know what, devil? I'm getting off your treadmill. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to let my life be run by my inner conviction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you abundantly and come this evening and be ready for the word. And I I I don't want to just close. Maybe we have the musicians come, please. I I don't want to just close without giving you an invitation. And the invitation is this. join me as I seek also to to move in the same direction. I think it would be good to take a hold of our agenda and say my agenda needs adjustment. &gt;&gt; I need to see more clearly the unseen. Give me, oh God, and fix my vision on the things that are eternal. &gt;&gt; Let my thoughts and my mind be consumed with that. Even I, my wife, we have wonderful health, but we pray for things in the physical realm. We have things that we pray for earnestly. You have things. I need to say to you today, those things are not realities. it has come along in this life and we can say well because I'm getting older or because I did this or because I had this kind of accident or I you know this happened to me and and and now I've got this injury and I am this way and it it may be you you may you may be the way that that way the rest of your life but I have to I have to say to you I cannot look at that infirmity and say that's real. I'm talking about personal things. &gt;&gt; You know, I I have to be very personal with you. You know, my I my wife wants to travel with me when I go to meetings. He said, "You need me and I need to be there. I need to have your clothes ready. I need to be with you. I need to, you know, when you have need a little bit of lunch or something to eat because she just monitors everything and have your suits ready and and and watch and make sure make sure that you have a rest and so on and need to be there. But she doesn't have a balance. Many of you people know that, but most of you don't or many of you don't. They they they discovered at the University of British Columbia that that her balance system, her mechanism, balance mechanism somehow was totally destroyed and doesn't exist in her body. I stand here today, I say, as far as God is concerned, she's not going to be that way across the river. &gt;&gt; She's not going to be that way where I look into the unseen. That's that's not I don't see a woman that has no balance. &gt;&gt; I see a woman that has is exactly as God ordained it to be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so I'm here believing. I don't I don't want to even wait for that. I'm believing for it now. God who gave that balance system in the first place can replace that today before she walks out those doors. &gt;&gt; I I say that that is not a reality. &gt;&gt; The reality, what is the reality? You say the reality is the creative power of almighty God by the word of God that can give it back. &gt;&gt; That's the reality. And I'm seeking here that my faith can reach out and take a hold of that thing. &gt;&gt; Take a hold of that promise and bring it down into our existence and and that we can experience it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let this whole church in the name of Jesus Christ believe for the true realities. And let us say with the messenger of this hour, we have passed on into the realities of God. &gt;&gt; We hunger and thirst for that. &gt;&gt; God bless you, precious people. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand and bow our heads, please. If you'd like to be included in a prayer and you wish to raise your hand just to identify what's in your heart, we'll pray together. Father, how true. Truth. Truth. Your word is truth. Jesus, you said that you came you came to earth to testify of the truth. &gt;&gt; You are truth. Oh God, and I hold in my hand the word of God and truly it is a a a reality. Almighty God, you are the self-existent one. &gt;&gt; You are real. We thank you, Father, that you have made yourself real. Oh, open our eyes and open our understanding that we may grasp more perfectly your will. Lord, how we thank you for the message that you sent in this hour and the messenger that has declared it. And for the first time in history, have we had anything of this nature where someone could say, "If God be God and if God has spoken these words, then let that God come." And you did come, oh God. You did come. You're the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You're the God of the living and not of the dead, as our Lord Jesus said. You're the God that has created, and you're the God that has brought us forth to this time. You have a purpose. You have a design. And I pray that we will fulfill that. Lord, let every man, woman, and child within the range of my my speaking today and those that are streaming, I pray you'll go into the rooms where they are. And may the very presence of Almighty God, sweep down and permeate them and right here, Lord, today may there be a may there be a general reception, Lord. see receiving you saying, "Oh God, come and do thee abundantly, exceedingly abundantly above all I can ask or think." For we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. And let us say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have asked him for. Oh, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How wonderful you are. Lord, &gt;&gt; you're worthy of all of our praise. We enter into your courts with thanksgiving. We bless your name. We bless your name. We bless your name. &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Ryan, Joanne, if we can sing. We bless your name. We bless your name. We bless your name. Your name. Okay. Your name. I bless your name.

I thank you Jesus for my soul. &gt;&gt; And the people said, "Praise the Lord." [Music] &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; how we love you, Lord. Father, words escape me right now, Lord. But all we can do is just praise you and thank you, dear God, for this amazing grace that you've given to us, Lord. Grace, the grace upon grace that's been poured upon our lives. Father, you're unveiling yourself before us in this end time hour. You've opened up our eyes, dear God. Think of the multitudes, Lord Jesus, that have blinded eyes. Ones we've testified to and they can't see this great Jesus Christ has been unveiled before us. But Lord God, you've unveiled yourself before us, Lord. You've called us to this great mystery, Lord. And Father, I want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, &gt;&gt; that every area of our lives, we could praise you. We could thank you. We could worship you, Lord. that we could seek first the kingdom of God and and your righteousness, Father. And all these things, Lord, that are around us. All these things that, Lord, seem real to us, you though they're not realities, Lord, you said they'd be added unto us, Lord. If we need healing in our body, Lord, if we seek first the kingdom of God, it'll be added unto us, Father. If we need salvation for our loved ones, dear God, that will be added unto us, Lord. If we need a job, Lord, if we need financial needs, Lord, you said you would add that unto us, Lord. But you said to seek first the kingdom of God. And Lord, that's our desire. That's our hunger, Lord. How we may please you in this hour that is so late, Father. And I'm praying, dear God, that we could just set aside the cares of life, the busyiness of life, dear Lord, and to seek you first, to seek your will for our lives, Lord. What you would have us to do, Father. Lord, we so appreciate this service. We appreciate our pastor. We appreciate the attendance of the Holy Spirit, Lord. And Father God, just speaking to our hearts today. Lord, I pray that you'll go before us. Father, be with us this afternoon in our fellowship, the time that we would get rest and prepare our hearts for the service tonight. Lord, that once again that we can come and not to be casual, dear God, about this word that you've given to us, Father, but Lord, tonight as we approach you again, Brother Lance coming to bring your word. Father, help us be on the edge of our seat. Lord Jesus, there could be a night that one here that is needing salvation, dear God, that they would hear Jesus Christ speak to them. My children need salvation, Lord. Many here that need salvation. Many that are hungering and crying for salvation, Lord. And Father, you said they that hunger and thirst, Lord Jesus, they would be filled. So fill us tonight, dear God. All the things that we have need of, you're our provider. We love you, dear Lord Jesus. All that we have need of, dear God, you've already provided it for us, Lord. So, we're just waiting on you, Father. Father, for you to open up the windows of heaven and pour down that blessing that we wouldn't be able to contain it, Lord, but that we can just be released from this world, dear God. Be released into your presence and and freedom of worship and freedom of praise, dear God, to receive the revelation, dear God. You're just waiting to pour into our lives, Father. just help us to get aside, Lord, to quieten our spirits, Lord Jesus. Oh God, for you have something in store for us even tonight, even this afternoon, Lord. And so, dear God, we pray that you'll just anoint each one of us. And Father, as we prepare our hearts, Lord, as we prepare our hearts for more of you, strengthen Brother Ed, dear God, we're so thankful for the man of God. So thankful for a man who has held out, Lord, who has been, Lord, so uncompromising with your word. Father, holding the banner high, dear God. &gt;&gt; We see the testimony, dear God, that he's lived before us, the testimony of his dear wife. And Lord, we just pray that you'll meet their desires, that you'd meet their prayer requests, Lord, what they have asked for in privacy, dear God, that you would make it manifest, Father. Lord, we thank you for their lives. We thank you for your people. We just ask, dear God, that you'd go before us now. Walk with us, Lord. We want you to be our friend, Lord. You said you'd be a friend that stickketh closer than her brother. We thank you for it, Lord. Asking your blessings upon us now in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. All we can say is the best thing we can say. God bless you. and you greet one another and we'll see you this evening. Come early. Have a good seat. God bless you. You're dismissed. [Music] Heat.
