[29:46] [Music]
[29:51] Let's bow our heads.
[29:55] Gracious heavenly father,
[29:58] once again we find ourselves, Lord,
[30:00] sitting at your feet.
[30:02] Lord, how we just want to be Mary's this
[30:04] morning, Lord. Not like Martha's, Lord.
[30:07] We be Martha's all through the week,
[30:09] Lord, but this morning, Father, we just
[30:11] want to sit at your feet just to hear
[30:14] those wonderful words of life. Words
[30:17] that will transform us, Father, that
[30:19] will change our appetite, that will
[30:22] cause a greater hunger and a greater
[30:24] thirst, Lord Jesus, to have that
[30:26] intimate relationship with you, Lord.
[30:29] Father, the world knows nothing of it.
[30:31] strange to the world, but to us, dear
[30:33] God, it's something we long for,
[30:35] something we so hunger for, Father. Just
[30:37] more of you, that you'd reveal yourself
[30:39] to your people this morning. Lord, as
[30:41] we've come expecting, Lord Jesus, to
[30:44] meet with you this morning, not a God of
[30:47] wood or stone, but a living God, a God
[30:49] that lives within his people. We've come
[30:52] this morning, Father, packing the Holy
[30:54] Spirit, packing that lick of fire, dear
[30:56] God. Lord, that we just combine our
[30:58] faith this morning to pull upon the
[31:00] gift, Lord. That word that you have for
[31:03] us this morning, a word in due season,
[31:05] Lord, that will answer every need, that
[31:08] will answer every request, Father, that
[31:10] will meet, Lord Jesus, each person, Lord
[31:12] Jesus, where they're at, right down to
[31:14] their address, Lord. Father, we remember
[31:16] these prayer requests, Lord God. We pray
[31:18] that you go to each one, Lord. Make
[31:20] yourself known to them, Lord. Make
[31:22] yourself known as the mighty God
[31:24] unveiled before them, Lord. That you
[31:26] would raise, Lord God, those who are
[31:27] sick, those that are afflicted, Lord.
[31:29] Father, those that are combating the flu
[31:31] and the colds and other ailments, Lord.
[31:34] Father, we just so thankful, Lord, that
[31:36] we can turn to you, Lord. Man doesn't
[31:38] know, Lord God, what they're doing
[31:40] anymore, Lord. Things are too
[31:41] complicated, Father. But we're so
[31:43] thankful that we can turn to you, the
[31:46] author and the finisher of our faith,
[31:47] Lord. So increase our faith this
[31:49] morning, Lord. For faith cometh by
[31:51] hearing, hearing your word, Father, not
[31:53] the words of a man. We pray that you'll
[31:55] take our pastor, Father. Move him out of
[31:57] the way, Lord, and allow the Holy Spirit
[32:00] to minister unto us. So may we just sit
[32:02] on the edge of our seats, Lord. Father,
[32:05] may we just be under great anticipation,
[32:07] Father, for what you're going to speak
[32:09] to us this morning. Lord God, would you
[32:11] just bless our brother Ryan, Father,
[32:13] just Lord, lead us, Lord, to create an
[32:15] atmosphere, Father. We're creators this
[32:18] morning, Lord. May we just create that
[32:20] atmosphere, Father, where you just
[32:21] couldn't help but come down, Father,
[32:24] into our midst, Lord Jesus, to dwell
[32:26] with your children this morning,
[32:28] speaking to our hearts, oh God,
[32:30] individually, Father, so so intimately,
[32:34] Lord, we so love you. We just pray you
[32:36] bless the musicians, bless all that's
[32:38] done or said this day. We pray in Jesus
[32:41] Christ's name. Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:51] So humbling every time he comes. We're
[32:53] so thankful. He promised he would never
[32:56] leave us nor forsake us. I mean,
[32:59] heavenly father, I appreciate you. And
[33:01] just as the Sunday school children are
[33:02] finding their way and why don't we just
[33:03] continue to worship,
[33:06] oh heavenly father,
[33:09] I appreciate
[33:12] you.
[33:15] Oh my heavenly father,
[33:19] I appreciate
[33:22] you.
[33:25] Lord, I love you. I adore you.

[33:58] to me.
[34:02] Oh, you lead me.
[34:05] You guide me and your dwelling
[34:10] inside me. Holy Spirit,
[34:14] you're a comfort
[34:16] to me every father. Oh my every heart
[34:23] I receive.
[34:29] Oh every heart I receive.
[34:39] Lord, I love you, adore you, and I bow
[34:45] down
[34:46] before you. Heavenly Father,
[34:51] I appreciate
[34:54] you.
[34:57] Amen. I'm just going to ask the brothers
[34:58] if they get ready for the morning
[34:59] offering this morning. And while we sing

[43:24] [Music]
[43:31] Let Jesus fight your battles for it's
[43:34] written in God's word. He'll make a way
[43:38] to hold your ground.
[43:42] Oh, this message gives us power to put
[43:46] the devil on the run. It's the only way
[43:50] to bring him down.
[43:54] You got to stand toe toe with the devil.
[44:00] You can't walk hand in hand with
[44:03] disgrace.
[44:05] You got to fight them every day. Get
[44:08] down on your knees and pray where you'll
[44:12] meet the Lord Jesus face to face.
[44:16] Oh, you got to stand toe toe with the
[44:20] devil.
[44:23] You can't walk hand in hand with
[44:26] disgrace.
[44:29] You got to fight them every day. Get
[44:32] down on your knees and pray where you'll
[44:35] meet the Lord Jesus face to face. One
[44:39] more time. You got to stand toe to toe
[44:43] with the devil.
[44:46] You can't walk hand in hand with
[44:49] disgrace.
[44:52] You got to fight him every day. be down
[44:55] on your knees and pray where you'll meet
[44:58] the Lord Jesus face to face.
[45:03] You got to fight them every day. Get
[45:06] down on your knees and pray and the Lord
[45:10] will ride forth and take your place.
[45:13] [Music]
[45:19] Amen. I like that. Stand toe-to-toe with
[45:22] the devil. How are we going to do that?
[45:24] By the word of God.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, last week we gave you a little
[45:28] bit of a report from China and Brother
[45:31] Biscllow got on it right away and he
[45:32] said, "You know, you said they did the
[45:34] book so well in China. Why didn't you
[45:36] have any books?" I said, "That's right."
[45:40] So, we got on, we got on. I had Sarah
[45:42] get a hold of Brother Ivan and uh we
[45:45] just wanted to show you the quality
[45:48] of the This is just part one of the
[45:50] church age book. And I showed you the
[45:52] brother that did the uh publishing of
[45:54] it. And that is an amazing amazing uh
[45:59] book, of course. But then we've got all
[46:02] these other ones. Brother Ivan does a
[46:04] design. And these are ones you would
[46:06] love to have, but you don't understand a
[46:09] word it says.
[46:12] I thought I'd just get a whole
[46:13] collection of them, just have them in my
[46:14] bookshelf. And say I Those are just just
[46:17] tremendous. Brother Ivan has has got a
[46:20] special machine that he laminates the
[46:22] the cover so the cover will not actually
[46:24] break apart. And I said, "You know what,
[46:27] Brother Ivan? I want one of those." I
[46:30] said, "I've got I've got books that are
[46:32] 30 years old, 35 years old that are
[46:35] falling apart and I could laminate every
[46:37] one of them and they would be my own
[46:40] special books." So, if you want to do
[46:42] that, you let me know and I'm going to
[46:44] order one of those machines. But if you
[46:46] just see these books that they have
[46:48] printed and they do this by this is all
[46:51] volunteer labor
[46:53] &gt;&gt; 12 little some of them are are just 12
[46:56] year olds all the way up to sisters and
[46:59] brothers and they've done a collection
[47:01] of all these books.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy will be home.
[47:08] God bless brother Ivan. They do that off
[47:10] the hub. Brother Murphy will be home,
[47:13] Lord willing, March 27th. So keep
[47:15] brother Murphy in your prayers and
[47:17] brother Ivan, God bless you.
[47:33] Apparently that was a COOD book, not a
[47:34] church age book. But you know, I don't
[47:37] know if any of us would be able to tell
[47:38] the difference. Amen. When I was saying,
[47:40] "Can't you see why I'm happy as we turn
[47:42] the service to our pastor?"
[47:44] Oh, can't you see
[47:47] why
[47:49] I'm so happy?
[47:52] Oh, for I've accepted
[47:55] the word of the Lord.
[48:00] Oh, it's the revealed
[48:04] word that was spoken
[48:09] by the prophet.
[48:13] Very thankful for that message. Sing it
[48:15] once more. Can't you see why I'm happy
[48:18] to see
[48:20] why
[48:22] I'm happy?
[48:25] Oh, for I accepted
[48:28] the word of the Lord.
[48:33] It's the redee
[48:36] word that was sold.
[48:41] [Music]
[48:53] God bless you.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; I'll try that again. God bless you.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be in the house of God.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Enjoyed that service. Uh, brother Kyle
[49:07] Wednesday.
[49:10] We're trying to get ourselves all
[49:13] arranged here. Hooked up
[49:17] that battle.
[49:19] Are we coming through? Hello. My fault.
[49:25] Uh,
[49:27] yeah. I think when I when I saw those
[49:29] books, I I uh I think we're in a third
[49:33] world country.
[49:36] you you don't have to tell them how to
[49:38] do anything. They just take it and run
[49:40] with it. And it's so wonderful. So
[49:43] wonderful because they're they're doing
[49:45] it out of uh the not just inspiration
[49:48] but the joy. When you get something
[49:51] good, you want to share it with
[49:52] somebody. And that is so wonderful. Uh
[49:56] we
[49:57] are young people and uh others are still
[50:01] in Africa. And I thought I would just
[50:03] like to show you some of the
[50:07] a few of the pictures that are there.
[50:08] And I have also an email from Brother
[50:11] Tim D I got just this morning.
[50:20] Maybe we could turn the lights down just
[50:22] a wee bit. That'll be fine. Thank you.
[50:25] Uh oops.
[50:30] This is uh at the airport apparently
[50:33] where they had 64
[50:35] 64 bags of luggage
[50:38] and I think they're coming back with
[50:40] about 16.
[50:42] So they have left a lot of stuff over
[50:45] there and uh then uh they the the the
[50:50] fellas there they asked the brothers
[50:52] they said well in order to do this
[50:53] ceiling and work on this building we'll
[50:56] need ladders. Where's the ladders? said,
[50:58] "We don't have any ladders. You have to
[51:00] make them." So, so here they are making
[51:03] their ladders before they can go to
[51:05] work. Uh
[51:08] I think Eli Ellie is saying, "What am I
[51:10] doing up here?"
[51:15] And uh there's uh some of the sisters
[51:17] even getting involved. There's Eli and
[51:20] Leona's daughter. Um
[51:25] they said they heard that one of the
[51:26] brothers had started a school. So they
[51:29] went to the school and there were 600
[51:32] students,
[51:34] 79 per class.
[51:41] I'm just going to let brother let
[51:44] brother Terry and all the all the
[51:46] teachers know that there they have 79 79
[51:50] students per teacher. have the same
[51:53] number of teachers we have in BCA.
[51:59] Uh but the group sang for them. Uh our
[52:03] young people sang for them and brother
[52:06] uh brother Tim Dodd spoke to them and I
[52:09] said it was really wonderful. This was
[52:11] just something added added in addition.
[52:13] They hadn't expected that.
[52:16] uh learning to cook Ugandan style and uh
[52:21] they seem to be very happy. I got word
[52:24] from some of the brothers and they said,
[52:26] "Hey,
[52:28] we're we're learning things. We're going
[52:29] to bring back some good ideas." They
[52:31] said, "Uh, it's 30° in the daytime and
[52:34] about 20 at night. So,
[52:38] sleeping's a little bit difficult, but
[52:40] they said the beautiful thing is just we
[52:41] step out of our bedroom door in the
[52:43] morning, just a few feet away is a table
[52:46] just piled with the fresh fruit. He said
[52:49] we could get along with this
[52:54] and uh
[52:57] there it's a beautiful spot really. this
[53:00] sister here lost a baby and uh and she's
[53:06] not able to have children now and they
[53:08] asked us to really pray. Her her husband
[53:11] is not a believer and he's determined
[53:14] that he needs to have children. So, you
[53:17] know, it's it's brought quite a problem,
[53:20] but she's a very very wonderful believer
[53:23] and unmoved.
[53:27] Here's Sister Hedi Dingwall teaching the
[53:31] uh sisters and see that sewing machine.
[53:34] I think they brought five of them. They
[53:36] said that those are the finest sewing
[53:38] machines in Uganda in the country. So,
[53:42] praise the Lord.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; I just say praise the Lord. And they
[53:45] they were sewing up skirts for the
[53:48] sisters. Brother Tim preaching in a a
[53:52] church. There's there's uh just an
[53:55] incredible amount of ministry and this I
[53:58] believe is probably the building. Uh
[54:02] there's about 200 people there and
[54:04] that's in a village. I have a picture of
[54:06] the building a little later on.
[54:10] And this is a training session. They
[54:12] said the pastors are coming from all
[54:14] over and they are just so happy,
[54:19] so thankful that you know that we're
[54:22] interested and concerned enough to teach
[54:24] them how to handle the hub and how to
[54:27] maintain the equipment and how to print
[54:29] the books and they were printing them
[54:31] for the people in their language. And
[54:33] then more than that, they've gone to
[54:35] audio. And right now they're seeking
[54:38] that, brother Kim is seeking to put the
[54:41] uh messages which are in audio in their
[54:45] tribal language on the radio and uh and
[54:50] we're seeking to we may underwrite
[54:54] he's looking for it and underwrite it
[54:57] for a year and then the churches would
[55:00] gradually take over the cost. It was
[55:03] about $600 a month for the radio. That's
[55:07] the church. They had about 150 to 200
[55:10] people in uh where all the group were
[55:13] down there.
[55:20] All right.
[55:22] I think that's that's it for the
[55:25] picture. Thank you.
[55:29] Uh, brother brother Tim just said if I
[55:33] could share this with you. We are just
[55:36] on our way to Sunday services
[55:38] about a 2-hour drive. We will be with
[55:42] brother Charles Odipio today. Another
[55:46] one of the elders in the country. I've
[55:49] heard his name and I probably met him as
[55:52] well. I think he was close to brother
[55:54] Harold Hilderbrand.
[55:56] He said perhaps you know him. He was
[55:59] brother Ibali's pastor. Brother Steven
[56:02] Ibali and his wife were here and he has
[56:05] uh one of the main works there. The
[56:08] young people are holding up well. They
[56:10] have labored hard this week and much was
[56:13] accomplished in translation, audio
[56:16] translation, uploading the hub,
[56:20] instruction on print stations and
[56:22] construction work. The widows have been
[56:25] trained on the use of sewing machines
[56:28] for use as micro business.
[56:32] They will be uh today will be our 11th
[56:36] and 12th services with the with the
[56:39] group being present in most of them. A
[56:43] lot of travel has been absorbed uh with
[56:46] with most uh with most to come.
[56:50] Uh with everything falling into place
[56:52] the first week, my burden is growing to
[56:54] find a means to reach the illiterate
[56:58] with the message. One advantage of
[57:00] gaining information in the second week
[57:03] is the wedding. The hand of God is
[57:06] clearly seen in this way because
[57:09] ministers are gathering from all over
[57:11] Africa for the wedding and it will be an
[57:14] opportunity to discuss uh this need with
[57:18] brothers from many countries. Just last
[57:21] night I sat with a brother from
[57:23] Zimbabwe.
[57:25] Please pray for us in this region.
[57:28] And so they said they that was the news
[57:32] that we are able to give you as of this
[57:35] morning.
[57:36] Wonderful to be a part of it, isn't it?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; I just I I I sent word back to them late
[57:42] last night and I said, "Well, there has
[57:44] to be somebody," and this is a message I
[57:46] have coming up in the future. There has
[57:49] to be somebody stay home with this
[57:50] stuff.
[57:53] Did you know the Bible talks about the
[57:55] stuff? Yeah. Yeah. The Bible talks about
[57:58] the stuff. So, I thought I'd look and
[58:00] find out what the stuff is. And there's
[58:03] got to be somebody here pounding out
[58:05] swords
[58:07] for the guys on the front lines to have
[58:09] otherwise they don't have the swords.
[58:11] There has to be somebody working in the
[58:13] blacksmith shops and somebody making the
[58:15] uniforms and somebody doing something.
[58:18] So, we got to stay with the stuff.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But that's how come they're out there.
[58:22] So, I say praise God. Let's give a hand
[58:25] to all the people that stay home with
[58:27] this stuff.
[58:31] God bless you. God bless the people.
[58:35] Amen. God bless them. But God bless the
[58:37] people that stay home with this stuff.
[58:39] Hallelujah.
[58:41] There won't be they wouldn't do very
[58:43] good in the front lines if there wasn't
[58:44] people home doing some hard work.
[58:48] Hallelujah. Well, if you want to stand,
[58:51] we're going to read some scripture.
[58:54] And I'm going to read from the same
[58:56] chapter we read last week, but I'm going
[58:58] to read less of it out of Colossians,
[59:01] the first chapter.
[59:09] And just before we read, I'll be
[59:11] starting starting at the 24th verse.
[59:17] And just before we read, let's speak to
[59:20] the author.
[59:22] Oh righteous
[59:24] heavenly father,
[59:27] I always feel such a sense of
[59:30] thanksgiving
[59:31] when I can say the God of Abraham, the
[59:35] God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This
[59:39] is how you introduced yourself
[59:43] &gt;&gt; to Moses and you told him, "You're not
[59:45] the God of the dead. We heard from our
[59:47] Lord Jesus. You're the God of the
[59:49] living."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Father, we're here in our
[59:53] journey of life.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; We're here facing life's trials. We're
[59:58] here facing life's battles. But we know
[1:00:01] that you are great in battle.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And greater is he that is in us than he
[1:00:06] that is in the world. Lord, I pray
[1:00:09] tonight this morning that you will
[1:00:11] inspire us. Especially may the Holy
[1:00:13] Spirit give us a an open mind and
[1:00:17] understanding.
[1:00:18] And we pray you'll blow all the human
[1:00:20] cobwebs away. We pray you'll blow all
[1:00:23] the old religious and denominational
[1:00:26] teachings and thoughts. And may we
[1:00:28] receive the pure word of God, the
[1:00:31] vindicated word of God, the engrafted
[1:00:34] word of God, the word of God that has
[1:00:37] the power of transformation in it. Bless
[1:00:40] us today, Lord, as we are associated
[1:00:43] together. And we just want you to know
[1:00:45] that we love you in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus.
[1:00:55] I want to sing that chorus. Uh
[1:00:59] what's the title of it?
[1:01:02] Yeah.
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Help us out, brother.
[1:01:14] for letting me hear your word.
[1:01:20] What have I done to return? Such glory
[1:01:25] revealed indeed.
[1:01:29] Thanks for that special night.
[1:01:34] When I saw your glorious light, came
[1:01:38] face to face with eternal life. Lord, I
[1:01:44] thank
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; once again in thanksgiving. Now, I just
[1:01:49] want to thank you, Lord,
[1:01:53] for letting me hear your word.
[1:01:58] But have I done
[1:02:01] the glory
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:08] for that special night
[1:02:12] when I saw your glorious smile
[1:02:16] face to face with eternal life. Lord I
[1:02:22] thank you.
[1:02:27] Now we'll read in Colossians the first
[1:02:29] chapter
[1:02:31] starting at verse
[1:02:34] 24.
[1:02:37] Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[1:02:41] and fill up that which is behind of the
[1:02:44] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[1:02:47] his body's sake which is the church.
[1:02:50] whereof I am made a minister according
[1:02:53] to the dispensation of God which is
[1:02:56] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:03:00] of God. Even the mystery which hath been
[1:03:03] hid from the from ages and from
[1:03:06] generations, but now is made manifest to
[1:03:10] his saints, to whom God would make known
[1:03:13] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:03:16] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[1:03:20] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Let me
[1:03:23] just stop there for a moment. You see,
[1:03:25] this was this was a spectacular and uh
[1:03:31] doctrine that was almost a phenomena
[1:03:33] because the Jewish people did not
[1:03:36] believe that the Gentiles were part of
[1:03:39] it. And so the apostle Paul is
[1:03:42] introducing to them. This is a great
[1:03:45] mystery that Christ wasn't only in the
[1:03:49] Jews, but he's in you
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; and Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:03:55] say, "The mystery among the Gentiles,
[1:03:58] which is Christ in you, the hope of
[1:04:01] glory, which we preach, warning every
[1:04:04] man, and teaching every man in all
[1:04:07] wisdom, that we may present every man
[1:04:10] perfect in Christ in in Christ Jesus,
[1:04:13] where unto all I also labor, striving
[1:04:17] according to his working, which workketh
[1:04:20] in me mightily." You may be seated and
[1:04:24] please keep your Bibles open and ready
[1:04:27] because I have a number of places that
[1:04:29] we would like to refer to. Now this
[1:04:32] morning
[1:04:34] I do not want to preach as such but I
[1:04:38] want to really take my time. Uh this is
[1:04:41] the third part of this message the
[1:04:44] interpretation of God's word in your
[1:04:48] life. So this will be part three.
[1:04:53] I have been pondering for a very very
[1:04:55] long time. And I when I say long time,
[1:04:58] I'm talking about many years. Many
[1:05:00] years, decades.
[1:05:03] We've pondered because we've heard so
[1:05:05] much about the coming of the Lord and uh
[1:05:11] the how and the when and being ready for
[1:05:14] it. And back in, you know, we've we've
[1:05:17] all been touched or tainted somehow with
[1:05:19] denominational teaching. And brother
[1:05:22] Brandham speaks about they expected the
[1:05:24] Jews expect them to come down and maybe
[1:05:27] from the heavens in a a rolled out
[1:05:30] carpet and they would come right to
[1:05:31] Caiaphas, the high priest, and all these
[1:05:34] things. And uh the Gentiles have
[1:05:36] believed, well, it's going to be in a
[1:05:38] cloud somehow. And we try to envision
[1:05:41] it. and and and others have multitudes
[1:05:44] have the dirt and earth of the graves
[1:05:48] flying out of the graves and piles of
[1:05:50] dirt everywhere and trains crashing and
[1:05:53] cars and airplanes crashing with pilots
[1:05:56] are suddenly gone and uh operators are
[1:05:59] suddenly gone and it's it's it's so
[1:06:02] difficult and we wrestled they may sound
[1:06:05] a little bizarre but we wrestled with
[1:06:07] those things and how is this going to
[1:06:09] happen and how are we going to be
[1:06:11] changed and and so all of these things
[1:06:14] have been and somehow I always have felt
[1:06:18] that that scenario is not biblical. It's
[1:06:22] not really scriptural and we we search
[1:06:24] and try to find out and and then when we
[1:06:27] read the Old Testament, it seems that uh
[1:06:30] you know the things of God and the life
[1:06:32] it they just kind of lived it out and
[1:06:35] they were all you know somehow in the in
[1:06:38] the plan of God and they were did very
[1:06:42] ordinary things and lived a very
[1:06:44] ordinary life. And so we have been
[1:06:47] inclined to say oh well that was back
[1:06:49] there when everything was uh you know
[1:06:51] just uh in a natural way but now it's
[1:06:55] everything's spiritual. So we tried to
[1:06:57] spiritualize everything and almost
[1:07:00] spiritualize it to the point that this
[1:07:03] life well this is kind of a bad natural
[1:07:05] life and we kind of hate this life and
[1:07:08] we just don't you know we're just
[1:07:09] wanting that spiritual life and until I
[1:07:12] have said to uh in earlier times to uh
[1:07:17] some of our
[1:07:19] young men who are so eager and just
[1:07:22] can't wait till this life is over and
[1:07:24] get out of this mess and get out of this
[1:07:26] thing and I said, you know, hey, you
[1:07:28] know, God put us here.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; God put us here for a witness. God put
[1:07:32] us here for a testimony. We're living it
[1:07:34] out. This is, you know, this is God's
[1:07:36] doing. And so, the rapture is not an
[1:07:39] escape.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That's not it. It's just a an unfolding
[1:07:44] event. The rapture and the resurrection
[1:07:47] is just going to be an another unfolding
[1:07:50] event. So you may remember last year a
[1:07:53] few months ago I spoke on
[1:07:56] uh the events of the redemption and that
[1:08:00] the scripture is is essentially a series
[1:08:04] of events
[1:08:07] all playing out
[1:08:09] redemption. And then that evolved in my
[1:08:13] mind as I spoke it and and and pondered
[1:08:16] it prayerfully and waiting on God. not
[1:08:19] for days but over these months and over
[1:08:22] a long time and perhaps even years I've
[1:08:25] pondered it and and we've seen also when
[1:08:28] you know things have have come in and
[1:08:29] come into the message and people have
[1:08:32] seen that you know he's come oh okay and
[1:08:36] now oh well he's here and well my
[1:08:39] response to that well wasn't he always
[1:08:41] here well but he's here in a different
[1:08:44] way now and so we we try to assimilate
[1:08:48] that okay is here and what is what is
[1:08:50] changing and what is happening and then
[1:08:52] we find that people go off and go to
[1:08:55] seed on not that the doctrine is wrong
[1:08:58] but that the thing is they eroded in the
[1:09:02] New Testament saying the resurrection
[1:09:03] was already passed well the truth of the
[1:09:06] matter is part of the resurrection was
[1:09:08] passed but but they were expecting a
[1:09:12] resurrection I suppose and and I don't
[1:09:14] know when the scripture says they aired
[1:09:16] what they did was they just went to seed
[1:09:18] on it took it too far. And not that
[1:09:21] there wasn't truth in it. People within
[1:09:23] the within the message, there's been
[1:09:25] very much said about the thunders, the
[1:09:27] seven thunders and and what it meant.
[1:09:30] And then some go way off base and go to
[1:09:32] seed on it and and that's all there is.
[1:09:35] They take a few choice phrases out of
[1:09:38] the message and and that becomes their
[1:09:40] main pillar doctrine. And then while the
[1:09:43] other people says, "Oh, because they
[1:09:46] went to seed on it or they took it too
[1:09:49] far and I can't see that and can't
[1:09:51] believe that." So then they pull back.
[1:09:53] That's exactly what the devil wants.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; He wants somebody to go too far so the
[1:09:57] rest will pull back and and and he wins
[1:10:00] on both sides. So there isn't anything
[1:10:02] that the messenger has said that we
[1:10:05] should be afraid of.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:09] And we need to really determine and
[1:10:12] discover what it is he said. And you
[1:10:15] can't just do that by saying, "Well, I
[1:10:17] read a book today." That's not it.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; That just isn't it. It is what was the
[1:10:23] what was the thought of God? What was
[1:10:25] God trying to say to us?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; And I think you can only do it by being
[1:10:30] prayerful and digesting and take it. And
[1:10:34] we don't want to be lazy in our minds in
[1:10:36] in this day. We don't want to be leo to
[1:10:39] sin in our thoughts. We just want to say
[1:10:43] we want to say this and and and now I
[1:10:46] I'm reaching way way back to bring some
[1:10:48] things forward that have uh haven't
[1:10:51] bothered me for years but have have u
[1:10:54] had a big effect on me. Now, when I f
[1:10:58] first came into the message and began to
[1:11:00] realize, you know, and was actually
[1:11:02] spending some time with brother
[1:11:04] Brandham, I I I knew that that was a
[1:11:07] forerunner.
[1:11:10] And so, you naturally go back in your
[1:11:12] mind, as I did, I went back to the first
[1:11:15] forerunner, John the Baptist, before his
[1:11:18] first coming. And there has to be
[1:11:20] similarities between the two.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; There has to be similarities. And that's
[1:11:26] the spirit of Elijah. This is the spirit
[1:11:28] of Elijah. He's a rugged man. There's a
[1:11:30] rugged man. He likes the wilderness. He
[1:11:32] likes the wilderness. He didn't have a
[1:11:34] great education. He didn't have a great
[1:11:35] education. So there's similarities. And
[1:11:38] the forerunner can't be very far ahead
[1:11:42] of him who is forerunning.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's not a forerunner. And
[1:11:47] then you come up with uh uh statements
[1:11:49] that brother Brandham says, you know, uh
[1:11:52] that he would introduce the bride to
[1:11:54] Jesus Christ. Well, that can't be
[1:11:57] something in millenniums up in the
[1:11:59] future. It has to be something when and
[1:12:03] then he have statements uh that he he he
[1:12:07] really labored on to separate the the
[1:12:12] angel of Revelation 10:1, for example.
[1:12:15] Now, we don't want to weary about
[1:12:17] talking about 10:1. That's Christ. We
[1:12:20] never want to weary. He said that was
[1:12:21] Christ. And he said, "That's a heavenly
[1:12:24] messenger." And in Malachi 4, now this
[1:12:27] is a earthly messenger. 10:7 is an
[1:12:30] earthly messenger, but this messenger is
[1:12:34] on the earth. The earthly messenger is
[1:12:36] on the earth when the heavenly messenger
[1:12:39] comes.
[1:12:40] So now you have to put that into a
[1:12:42] context into a spiritual context and
[1:12:45] then we have he's descending and we've
[1:12:47] spoken a lot about that. So my my
[1:12:51] concept today and I'll just drive I'll
[1:12:54] just give you the punchline right up
[1:12:56] front and we have an awful lot to say
[1:12:59] about it and that is that
[1:13:06] the prophet said Christ was in
[1:13:10] Moses, Christ was in Abraham. Christ was
[1:13:12] in Joseph and we'll read some of those.
[1:13:16] Christ was in and then I found places
[1:13:18] where he said that he was he was coming
[1:13:21] he didn't say he was coming down but he
[1:13:23] was coming forward it was and then in
[1:13:26] Christ as the mystery of God un revealed
[1:13:28] he said it's unfolded itself down
[1:13:32] to this time and the scripture which I
[1:13:36] will read a little later on
[1:13:39] when God was instructing Moses about the
[1:13:41] children of Israel going into their
[1:13:43] inheritance. Now, God had already
[1:13:46] declared what he was going to give them.
[1:13:47] He's already told us what he's going to
[1:13:49] give us. We don't want to sit here
[1:13:52] feeling that th this is the end all here
[1:13:56] or this life here. No, what we're here
[1:13:59] for is for eternal life.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We all want to confess, I have believed
[1:14:05] on Jesus Christ and I have eternal life.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; We all want to believe that if we pass
[1:14:11] away, we are going to be resurrected.
[1:14:14] And those that have passed away and died
[1:14:16] in Christ shall rise again.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And we that are alive and remain, we
[1:14:24] shall be changed.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of a Sunday
[1:14:30] morning service and all the services.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of the messenger
[1:14:35] coming is to let us know we have arrived
[1:14:38] to this time.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That to me is the what the message is
[1:14:43] about.
[1:14:44] And so all all the people of the Old
[1:14:48] Testament and I'll give you a quote on
[1:14:50] that brother Brandon first of all all
[1:14:53] the acts of the believers in the Old
[1:14:56] Testament
[1:14:58] they were they were uh unfolding this
[1:15:03] great mystery and don't and when I say
[1:15:05] great mystery don't let your mind fog up
[1:15:08] when I say great mystery the secret
[1:15:11] mystery you think the coming of the Lord
[1:15:16] and I want to change your concept
[1:15:18] perhaps for some at least as I've been
[1:15:20] changing my mind Christ was coming all
[1:15:23] down through the Old Testament
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; he was coming all the time
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; coming coming and when and when he was
[1:15:33] born by the Virgin Mary and now was in a
[1:15:37] body and became a young man 30 years old
[1:15:41] that was simply
[1:15:42] And I don't want to say simply, but that
[1:15:44] was simply the culminating act
[1:15:48] of all of the Old Testament part of
[1:15:50] redemption.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That was just the culmination of it.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "I have to leave.
[1:15:57] If I don't leave, the spirit won't
[1:15:58] come." So he leaves. The spirit comes.
[1:16:01] And now the church is born.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And now we have part two.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And he's and and all the acts of the
[1:16:09] disciples. And they were looking for
[1:16:11] him. They believed he would come then,
[1:16:14] but they were playing out a part of the
[1:16:18] second act or shall I say the second uh
[1:16:21] series of events of redemption.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And that is why in the end time, Apostle
[1:16:28] John, he gives the book of revelation
[1:16:32] and now he sees one uh on the throne
[1:16:35] that is holding the book of redemption.
[1:16:38] And the whole Bible is simply an account
[1:16:42] of that redemption and who's acting it
[1:16:45] out and who's a part of it and who's
[1:16:48] going to be there.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's all they're acting out. And this
[1:16:51] one is holding the book of redemption.
[1:16:54] And one stands, a lamb stands and takes
[1:16:57] the book of redemption that is sealed
[1:16:59] with seven seals. And only the lamb can
[1:17:02] do it because it was the lamb that shed
[1:17:04] the blood and paid the price. So he
[1:17:06] takes the book of redemption and and and
[1:17:10] in the uh that it says the lion of the
[1:17:13] tribe of Judah which is one office and
[1:17:15] the lamb is the lion is a kingly office
[1:17:18] and the lamb and both are appearing in
[1:17:20] the same scene because there's a
[1:17:23] ministry right at that time that that
[1:17:26] turns the whole gives the last uh part
[1:17:30] of redemption to the gentiles and
[1:17:34] through Ruth who was a gentile
[1:17:36] who was pregnantated by uh Solomon I
[1:17:40] believe it was and and brought forth a
[1:17:42] child which was the kingly lineage. So
[1:17:46] it went from red it went from the
[1:17:49] kinsman redeemer to the king. So now I
[1:17:52] don't want to get into that but there is
[1:17:54] a ministry at that time when uh when
[1:17:58] redemption is coming for the gentiles is
[1:18:00] coming to a closure.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; There has to be closure.
[1:18:06] And the book of redemption, each each
[1:18:09] part of the each part of the book of
[1:18:12] redemption was lived out by the elect of
[1:18:17] that age.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Now get this. And in their ordinary life
[1:18:24] that is called out that they were called
[1:18:27] to live, they are actually living out
[1:18:31] their own part of redemption.
[1:18:34] because you're living out what was
[1:18:36] written in the book.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But it's in the end time only that it's
[1:18:41] made known what the whole scope of the
[1:18:44] picture is. And thus you have a message,
[1:18:47] especially a spectacular message. Christ
[1:18:50] is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And the mystery is that not that Christ
[1:18:55] was mysterious, but it was Christ that
[1:18:59] was coming. Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Coming in the Old Testament and coming
[1:19:03] in the New Testament and the
[1:19:05] resurrection and the change of these
[1:19:08] bodies will simply be the culmination of
[1:19:11] redemption in the New Testament as his
[1:19:14] physical coming through a virgin birth
[1:19:16] was in the Old Testament.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; That's the concept.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Just to just so you know that I didn't
[1:19:27] go wacko.
[1:19:30] Uh we'll we'll continue on.
[1:19:34] Paul said in the Ephesians that the eyes
[1:19:37] of your understanding
[1:19:39] being enlightened
[1:19:42] that you might Why would they be
[1:19:43] enlightened? That you might know what is
[1:19:46] the hope of his calling. What is the
[1:19:49] hope of this calling? Why did you have
[1:19:52] to open my eyes Lord? Why did you why
[1:19:54] did you give me a heart to believe? Why
[1:19:57] did I hear this message? And and and
[1:20:00] what is the hope of his calling? And
[1:20:02] what the riches of the glory of his
[1:20:05] inheritance in the saints? Right.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just step back a moment, and
[1:20:10] you'll forgive me if this is a little
[1:20:11] chopped up, but uh and you'll have some
[1:20:15] questions after this, and it'll be good
[1:20:16] if you just jot them down. But when God
[1:20:20] was instructing Moses about the people
[1:20:23] going into their inheritance,
[1:20:25] now please realize that your inheritance
[1:20:28] is also God's inheritance.
[1:20:34] the land that the uh the the promised
[1:20:37] land
[1:20:40] that was God's land.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But it became the people's inheritance.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; He gave it to them.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; All right? Uh and so he gave instruction
[1:20:52] to them and he said to Moses this. Now
[1:20:55] don't worry because you'll have to keep
[1:20:57] your minds alert. I'm trying to crowd in
[1:21:00] months of uh uh you know so I'm gonna
[1:21:04] insist on you be alert.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So he says when you go into the land
[1:21:11] you'll not you'll not inherit the land
[1:21:15] you'll not possess it suddenly.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You'll just possess it little by little.
[1:21:24] Now we sitting here are of all different
[1:21:27] ages
[1:21:29] from young children to the older ones.
[1:21:33] And we actually possessed our life
[1:21:37] little by little.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child,
[1:21:43] thought as a child. When I became a man,
[1:21:46] I put away childish things. Not that the
[1:21:49] childish things were evil or bad or
[1:21:50] wrong. You have to be a child. You have
[1:21:53] to be carefree. You have to be foolish.
[1:21:57] Foolishness is is just in the heart of a
[1:22:00] child. We do crazy things.
[1:22:03] You know, when I was on the boarded out
[1:22:07] on one of the farms. Uh I had an old
[1:22:10] bicycle and uh the boys had a horse. And
[1:22:14] I may have told you this and but it'll
[1:22:16] just help you. I mean, I think sometimes
[1:22:19] it's not a guardian angel, but it's a
[1:22:21] whole herd of angels that have to come
[1:22:23] and protect you. And I didn't I had
[1:22:25] trouble pedaling and that they're riding
[1:22:27] this nice horse and sometime I'd ride
[1:22:29] the horse. But we we got an idea, you
[1:22:32] know, you're always you always got that
[1:22:34] idea that this this labor of pedaling is
[1:22:37] too much for me. It's almost a cane
[1:22:39] syndrome. And uh so I said, "Well, let's
[1:22:42] take the lariat rope and we'll put it
[1:22:45] around the st around the handlebars."
[1:22:47] And so there's a knot on the end of this
[1:22:49] lariat rope and I'll just hold it on my
[1:22:51] thumb and you'll pull me. Great idea.
[1:22:55] You know, this was horsepower,
[1:22:58] the first initial horsepower. And so,
[1:23:01] but when we when they pulled and would
[1:23:03] jerk and would run or trot or gallop,
[1:23:05] they'd want to pull the handlebar off.
[1:23:08] So I said, "Now what we need to do is
[1:23:10] put it around the center post of the
[1:23:12] bicycle so it'll get pulled straight and
[1:23:15] then we'll just bring it up over the
[1:23:16] handlebar a couple twist and I'll still
[1:23:18] hold the knot." And you know what? It
[1:23:20] just worked beautiful. Well, it worked
[1:23:22] beautiful till one day we were going
[1:23:24] down just a little hill and there's a
[1:23:26] bridge and the bridges on these little
[1:23:28] farm roads. Uh they they never make them
[1:23:31] even. It's a big bump coming on and a
[1:23:34] big bump going off. And so when we went
[1:23:37] on to that bridge, he decided to, you
[1:23:39] know, foolishness is built built in the
[1:23:41] heart of a child. And he and this was a
[1:23:43] cutting horse. If you know what a
[1:23:45] cutting horse is, one that just Well,
[1:23:47] all you had to do with this horse is
[1:23:49] touch it behind the front flanks like
[1:23:52] that. Just had to touch it with your
[1:23:54] toes and it was gone. I mean, yesterday,
[1:23:56] even today, was history. That thing
[1:23:59] would go so fast. and her and so he just
[1:24:03] touched her and said and she was gone
[1:24:06] and I was on the bicycle
[1:24:10] and man what a jerk and what a what a
[1:24:12] revelation that was. It just went down
[1:24:14] this little dip just just so
[1:24:18] I mean the air just blowing in your hair
[1:24:21] and and when I hit that bridge I was
[1:24:24] somewhat airborne and it took me a time
[1:24:27] to get my self straightened around but I
[1:24:29] I managed it and I hit that bridge you
[1:24:32] know and by the time I just hit that
[1:24:33] bridge we were going off the other end.
[1:24:36] Well, I woke up in a farmer's pasture
[1:24:40] and my bicycle over there. I don't even
[1:24:42] know how I got across the barbwire
[1:24:44] fence. I got over there and and people
[1:24:47] who hear this story, this says, "What
[1:24:48] did you do then?" I said, "Well, we we
[1:24:50] got up, you know, I I didn't even have
[1:24:52] the wind knocked out of me." So, I got
[1:24:53] up and put the lariat on the bike away
[1:24:56] and carried on.
[1:24:59] Foolishness is bound in the heart of a
[1:25:01] child. We do silly things but somehow
[1:25:04] God manages. And yet in life in life
[1:25:10] the prophet says and you'll have here's
[1:25:12] where you have to get the words and I'm
[1:25:14] going to come to it later on. He says
[1:25:16] all the acts of the believers
[1:25:21] of the Old Testament
[1:25:24] that are in the Bible.
[1:25:27] Not all the acts of the believers. We do
[1:25:30] silly things. We do wrong things. We fly
[1:25:33] off the handle. We uh you know do things
[1:25:35] we're ashamed of. All the acts
[1:25:39] of the believers are not expressing
[1:25:43] Christ.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we all here have expressed the
[1:25:48] flesh
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; many times. But all the acts of the
[1:25:53] believers in the Old Testament that are
[1:25:55] in the Bible
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; all spoke of Christ. because he is the
[1:26:01] Bible.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And all the acts of the gentile
[1:26:06] believers, all the acts of the elect
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; that they have lived out that are in the
[1:26:12] scriptures.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, am I in the
[1:26:15] scriptures?" You better believe it. A
[1:26:17] prophet came and told you there's a part
[1:26:19] of the scriptures that's allotted to
[1:26:20] you.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; It's already been given to you, and no
[1:26:23] one else can live it out. You're going
[1:26:25] to live it out. And that part is
[1:26:27] Christ's coming.
[1:26:33] How else is it going to happen?
[1:26:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:49] The first part of of Colossians that we
[1:26:53] started to read, it starts out and this
[1:26:56] is the first verse of who of Christ is
[1:26:59] the mystery of God revealed.
[1:27:02] And that first verse simply says
[1:27:07] uh
[1:27:10] 12 and 15
[1:27:13] who is the image
[1:27:15] of the invisible God the firstborn of
[1:27:20] every creature. That's what this is all
[1:27:23] about. The God restoring the original
[1:27:27] image of his own son which he had on
[1:27:30] earth. The first Adam fell. The second
[1:27:33] Adam did not fall.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And we sit in bodies
[1:27:39] here today. Every human sitting in
[1:27:42] bodies that are human brought about by a
[1:27:45] sexual birth. And thus we are connected
[1:27:48] to the first Adam.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But every son and daughter of God
[1:27:54] that is a believer has been born again.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And by the first one we die. By the
[1:28:00] second one we live.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said by the woman we
[1:28:05] die.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; We came into this life through a mother
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; and by that we have a death. Not because
[1:28:14] of the mother but because of the
[1:28:17] original sin in the Eden and the whole
[1:28:20] plan of God was perverted. But by the
[1:28:23] man we have life
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and we are have our second birth through
[1:28:28] Jesus Christ
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ is the whole
[1:28:34] complete word
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; but he sends a part for every one of his
[1:28:39] children in their generation.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So the prize and the goal and the secret
[1:28:48] and the mystery that we're speaking
[1:28:50] about that that is God's great secret.
[1:28:55] And in uh in Romans the scripture says,
[1:28:58] "And not only they but ourselves also
[1:29:01] which have the first fruits of the
[1:29:03] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[1:29:06] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[1:29:10] whit the redemption of our body." That's
[1:29:13] what's it all about, folks. Maybe when
[1:29:15] you know you're 8 n 10 years old or in
[1:29:17] your teens and feeling all your vigor a
[1:29:20] young man young women couple you're
[1:29:22] married couples and you're looking to
[1:29:24] your immediate future but let me tell
[1:29:27] you something friends and I trust that
[1:29:29] you will accept what I am saying now I
[1:29:33] in my short lifetime
[1:29:36] have seen incredible
[1:29:38] indescribable
[1:29:40] changes in this world not just events
[1:29:44] But deterioration,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; deterioration until one of the phrases
[1:29:50] that I and my wife say every once in a
[1:29:53] while in a car, it's gone beyond
[1:29:55] recovery.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And a prophet said that many, many years
[1:30:00] ago, it's beyond recovery.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And he said something as far as
[1:30:06] America's concerned. And that gives a
[1:30:08] con that gives an example for the rest
[1:30:11] of the world. If you were you if you had
[1:30:13] a Abraham Lincoln in a Washington
[1:30:17] Abraham Lincoln I believe in Washington
[1:30:19] said in every county.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You won't turn it around.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's saying it's on a
[1:30:29] decline that cannot be recovered.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; In fact, this Billy Graham said very
[1:30:35] very similar things. He said he really
[1:30:37] believed that America was at the
[1:30:39] crossroads and had gone beyond recovery.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; So the coming of Christ,
[1:30:51] I'm not being repetitious. I feel I need
[1:30:54] to say it a different ways. The coming
[1:30:57] of Christ is redemption in process.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] In the Old Testament, it was. In the New
[1:31:08] Testament, it is. It is redemption in
[1:31:12] process. It's redemption in progress.
[1:31:15] For you that go on the internet and you
[1:31:18] might go to a certain page and they'll
[1:31:20] say under construction.
[1:31:23] It's just not ready yet, but they're
[1:31:25] working on it. And you come back to that
[1:31:28] site later on and you might find it
[1:31:30] there, but it's under construction.
[1:31:32] Brother Brandham says, "God's a great
[1:31:34] contractor.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He lays out all of his material and
[1:31:38] you're a part of it.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And he's moving towards the ultimate
[1:31:44] kingdom of God."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; The physical arrival of Jesus Christ on
[1:31:50] earth was the culmination of all of the
[1:31:54] events of redemption throughout the Old
[1:31:56] Testament. Christ was coming through the
[1:32:00] Old Testament saints.
[1:32:03] And now the prophet here in the message
[1:32:06] in the Hebrew series
[1:32:09] says, "When Abraham took took after the
[1:32:12] enemy that he had that had took his
[1:32:14] brother, that was Lot, his nephew, and
[1:32:18] he pursued him all the way across the
[1:32:21] nation to Dan, and brought back
[1:32:23] everything that he lost in the fall.
[1:32:27] He's referring now. He just goes to the
[1:32:29] old to Genesis language. He he recovered
[1:32:32] and brought back everything that he lost
[1:32:34] in the fall. He said, "What a beautiful
[1:32:37] picture of Christ who heard from heaven
[1:32:41] that we were lost and came and pursued
[1:32:45] the enemy all the way to hell
[1:32:50] and captured the lost souls and brought
[1:32:54] us back and restored to us everything
[1:32:57] that we had lost in the fall."
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I was speaking about Joseph. Now I'm
[1:33:04] speaking about Abraham. Abraham wasn't
[1:33:06] going out after these and saying, "I'm a
[1:33:08] perfect type of Christ. I'm going all
[1:33:10] the way to hell if I need to go. I'm
[1:33:13] going to get Lot back and I'm going to
[1:33:15] bring back all the stuff." He didn't
[1:33:17] know he was living it out.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He's living out an important part of the
[1:33:22] coming of Christ.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Just in his daily battle.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That he wasn't going clicking his heels.
[1:33:34] This was probably one of his lower
[1:33:36] points. All these kings had come invaded
[1:33:41] and came against Sodom and Gomorrah. But
[1:33:43] they made a mistake and they took Lot.
[1:33:47] Now they tampered with something that
[1:33:49] concerned Abraham. Abraham was a chosen
[1:33:53] son of God.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A man of the faith. And
[1:33:57] there was just something in him. I'm
[1:33:59] going to bring him back. I'll gather the
[1:34:01] men out of my own own own uh farm and
[1:34:05] I'll go men trained and I'll go after
[1:34:08] him. And that spirit was the spirit of
[1:34:10] Christ
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; in him
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; driving him
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; to do something he perhaps normally
[1:34:16] wouldn't have done
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; and he may not even understand why am I
[1:34:20] doing this? Lot who went down there
[1:34:23] could have said it's good for him. He's
[1:34:25] getting his medicine.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; That was his choice. No, he has to live
[1:34:31] out this thing surging through him is
[1:34:34] not Abraham. It's Jesus Christ
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; in his coming.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Because that's what Jesus Christ is
[1:34:43] going to do. He's going to go all the
[1:34:46] way to hell.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And take the keys of death,
[1:34:50] hell, and the grave
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; off of the enemy
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; and be able to come up and announce
[1:34:55] because I live,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; you live also.
[1:34:59] Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; And he said this,
[1:35:05] we backsliders,
[1:35:08] we that was born to be sons of God,
[1:35:12] that's perverted into the sons of the
[1:35:14] devil and made and went after the things
[1:35:17] of the world and did wrong and ran
[1:35:20] greedily like Lot did, selling out our
[1:35:23] birthrights and going after the things
[1:35:26] of the world. Christ came down.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Christ came down. These are his words.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Though fallen, God knowing in the
[1:35:39] beginning who would be saved
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; and who would not.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Therefore came down. Why? Because some
[1:35:47] were to be saved.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And he came down and pursued the enemy
[1:35:52] through life, through death, through
[1:35:54] paradise into hell. and all the way from
[1:35:57] glory to hell and took over the powers
[1:36:00] of hell and the keys away from the devil
[1:36:04] and rose again restored to mankind that
[1:36:08] he can be sons and daughters of God
[1:36:10] again.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "See,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; listen to this now.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I have it highlighted. See the spirit in
[1:36:18] Abraham there, the spirit of Christ
[1:36:22] coming with him." Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you don't know how that
[1:36:29] thrills me.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ coming in.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I just want you to get the principle. It
[1:36:35] was the spirit of Christ. Christ coming
[1:36:37] in.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; What spirit is in you?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Not all of our acts are written in the
[1:36:44] Bible, but there are some things that we
[1:36:47] are doing that's written in the word of
[1:36:49] God. And we're doing it because we're
[1:36:51] sons and daughters of God.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; See, so you might just say as a matter
[1:36:56] of life, I just spoke to a person. I had
[1:36:58] an opportunity to witness and I was
[1:37:00] talking to them and they were really
[1:37:01] really uh uh they were really quite
[1:37:04] hungry and so on so forth. Oh,
[1:37:09] was that something you got from your
[1:37:10] mother and father?
[1:37:13] Did that come down from your
[1:37:14] greatgrandfather?
[1:37:16] I'll say no. Not a chance. as the spirit
[1:37:20] of Christ
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; in you
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; living out
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; a part of this coming
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; because part of my coming is I've got to
[1:37:28] reach this person.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; A part of this coming is I've got to
[1:37:32] bring them in
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; because they're part of the elected and
[1:37:35] this one that's even speaking isn't sure
[1:37:38] but I'm using them
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; part of his coming. We're acting it out.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And somebody's going to talk to the last
[1:37:49] elected one,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; the last one. Somebody's going to talk
[1:37:52] to them. And it's going to play out a
[1:37:54] part of the culmination of the coming.
[1:37:57] Because when the last one's in, we go
[1:37:59] home.
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Is it all right if I preach once in a
[1:38:08] while?
[1:38:12] The spirit of God from the beginning
[1:38:14] finally works down in the message the
[1:38:16] mark of the beast. He said and as the
[1:38:18] spirit of God
[1:38:22] as the spirit of God from the beginning
[1:38:24] finally finally works down and I'll say
[1:38:28] little by little
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; down through Moses.
[1:38:36] Do you believe Christ was in Moses?
[1:38:39] Certainly was Christ in Joseph.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on, he's put in a
[1:38:44] ditch. And we spoke quite a bit about
[1:38:46] Joseph and how he was acting out Christ.
[1:38:50] None of these people, the closest thing
[1:38:53] we have to anybody even believing it.
[1:38:56] Moses said, "A prophet shall the Lord
[1:38:58] God, Lord your God, raise up like unto
[1:39:01] me."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And that's the closest that that's the
[1:39:04] only statement you ever have. But now in
[1:39:07] the end time,
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; it has to be said clearly
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; to the end time people that was Christ
[1:39:15] and Moses.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; That was Christ and Abraham.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And tell us exactly what he
[1:39:23] was doing, chasing Satan all the way to
[1:39:27] hell to get you and to claim you and to
[1:39:30] claim me and to claim those that were in
[1:39:33] paradise.
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:36] And Eve would say, "Who is this?"
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Says, "The seed of the woman."
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not the seed of Adam, but
[1:39:43] the seed of God, the seed of the woman.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Who is this? Ezekiel said,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It's the wheel within the wheel."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; The rock that's cut out of the mountain
[1:39:55] without hands.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[1:40:00] And we could say if we were in the grave
[1:40:03] and and happened to be there and had
[1:40:06] this experience, which we won't have,
[1:40:08] but we'd say, "Who is this?" We can say
[1:40:10] it in life. This is him that descended.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; From the heavens with a rainbow over his
[1:40:17] head,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; having the covenant of God.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; This is him. This is him who revealed
[1:40:24] the mystery of God. The mystery is his
[1:40:27] coming.
[1:40:29] how he's doing it
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; and how his brethren, speaking of
[1:40:38] Joseph, how his brethren was made to
[1:40:40] know him, how they wept and said, "This
[1:40:42] is our sin." And how that he was
[1:40:46] portrayed letter by letter of Christ.
[1:40:51] Even in Joseph's life, it was little by
[1:40:54] little,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; by little,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; but he portrayed Christ.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; My message to you today is, and I
[1:41:02] perhaps have one more message coming on,
[1:41:08] but we spend too much time
[1:41:11] looking at our natural life
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; and our failures.
[1:41:17] That's why I didn't say very much the
[1:41:19] other day, Brother Mark.
[1:41:22] I was sharing this with Brother Mark and
[1:41:24] Sister Rachel, and I got to preaching a
[1:41:26] little bit at the at the dinner table,
[1:41:29] but and it was so burdening on my heart.
[1:41:34] There isn't anybody here that hasn't
[1:41:35] failed.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; So, we want to major on our failings.
[1:41:39] We've been in all kinds of situations
[1:41:43] and things that we don't want to make it
[1:41:46] public.
[1:41:47] We we don't want to bring these shameful
[1:41:49] things out. God knew that.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; God knew that when he brought us here.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I will provide something
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; that is sufficient
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; to not eradicate.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Not just so I'll forget it." No. Not
[1:42:04] just so I'll forgive you. No. So that I
[1:42:07] will annihilate it.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And I whom the creator will never find
[1:42:13] it again. and you can't find it again.
[1:42:16] And in fact is if you need to know, I'll
[1:42:18] send a messenger that will tell you that
[1:42:21] the ink turns to bleach.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I'll say such strong things that you'll
[1:42:27] have a hard time believing it. But if
[1:42:30] you keep saying it enough, you'll
[1:42:32] finally believe it. God took all those
[1:42:35] old doctrines and turned them to bleach.
[1:42:38] God took all our old failures. God took
[1:42:41] our sin, the ink, and dropped it into
[1:42:44] his blood, and it vanished
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; and does not exist anymore.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; A part of Christ coming.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I remember it." That's you
[1:43:02] that remembers it.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet gave an answer to that,
[1:43:06] too. He said, "You need to have the Holy
[1:43:08] Spirit,
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost blow that flu clear."
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; This old memory stuff
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; that presses you down and makes you
[1:43:22] almost impotent and makes you almost
[1:43:24] like a weakened. You got to get rid of
[1:43:27] that thing and say if you don't get
[1:43:29] anything else in life, say, "Holy
[1:43:31] Spirit, blow this channel clean so that
[1:43:34] this thing will never come back to my
[1:43:36] mind."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; We need that.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; We need that here this morning.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; We need people to say that.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; cleanse this. cleanse this memory
[1:43:52] channel
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; and and purify it with the fire of God.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; So little by little
[1:44:15] we are living out
[1:44:17] our part.
[1:44:19] Let me just give it to you in a natural
[1:44:21] sense for just a moment. Just a moment.
[1:44:30] I'll give you a secret mystery in your
[1:44:32] own life.
[1:44:34] It's called tomorrow.
[1:44:38] And the scripture says, don't say that I
[1:44:41] will do thus and so and so forth. You
[1:44:43] don't know what you're going to do.
[1:44:45] You say, "If the will, if the Lord
[1:44:47] wills, I will."
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Boast not thyself that tomorrow, for
[1:44:52] thou knowest not what tomorrow may
[1:44:54] bring.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; And what is your life? It's even as a
[1:44:57] vapor.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; It appearth for a little while, then
[1:45:00] vanishth.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; So, we don't know when it's going to be.
[1:45:02] We don't know. And it's not even that.
[1:45:04] We We don't know. So, tomorrow is a
[1:45:07] mystery.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Now, if I get this across, you'll be
[1:45:12] able to really understand it.
[1:45:15] Yesterday's not a mystery.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; What's the difference between yesterday
[1:45:19] and tomorrow? You lived yesterday out
[1:45:22] already
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; and your life interpreted.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; What you did was an interpretation of
[1:45:29] your life.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I did I did certain thing yesterday. I
[1:45:37] actually did a certain thing that made
[1:45:39] up part of your life.
[1:45:42] your life.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; That's your life.
[1:45:49] So now, not all of those acts are in the
[1:45:52] Bible,
[1:45:58] but there are some acts and and I could
[1:46:01] get very very deep now where you'd get
[1:46:03] swimming. There are some acts
[1:46:06] that look like they're total defeat and
[1:46:09] that you lost it. And yet God takes a
[1:46:13] hold of that act and turns it around
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; to his own glory.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; And I don't know how. I just say that
[1:46:23] does happen. Yes,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; but I don't I wouldn't even play God or
[1:46:27] even attempt to play God to say well
[1:46:30] some of these things you know to so let
[1:46:32] me just stay with what I do understand
[1:46:34] and that is in this life I want to make
[1:46:36] a very important point in this life
[1:46:39] that's you this is your life there was a
[1:46:42] time when you you were a complete
[1:46:44] mystery but you were coming
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; you were born
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; and your mother held you in her arm and
[1:46:51] said how sweet and how innocent and how
[1:46:54] lovely and so on and so forth, but they
[1:46:56] didn't know some of the things you were
[1:46:57] going to do.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Or they might have wailed on you right
[1:47:01] at the beginning,
[1:47:05] but you were just so innocent and so
[1:47:06] sweet and so cuddly and lovely and and
[1:47:09] uh you know the hell but your life your
[1:47:12] life your life which is from the
[1:47:14] beginning to the end of your life that
[1:47:16] was a mystery
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; but it became interpreted by you living
[1:47:21] it out.
[1:47:24] Now Jesus came born of a virgin and
[1:47:28] lived just a very short time and only
[1:47:30] ministered for three and a half years.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Most of it was left and in his life he
[1:47:37] was typed all the way through the Old
[1:47:39] Testament by the saints by their acts
[1:47:43] that were written in the Bible. And now
[1:47:46] most of his ministry would be going to
[1:47:49] his his disciples, the apostles, and the
[1:47:53] church. And the Holy Ghost came in now.
[1:47:56] And so now we're living this life.
[1:48:01] And in this life, we're actually
[1:48:05] that's what transforming power is all
[1:48:07] about.
[1:48:09] And there's probably people sitting here
[1:48:12] who said, "When I got saved, when I gave
[1:48:14] my life to Christ, I was certain I could
[1:48:16] never raise my hand. I could never clap
[1:48:20] my hand. I could never worship God like
[1:48:22] these people." But you know what? After
[1:48:25] a little while, you did
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; because it just came natural
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; and you began to worship.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That that's all part of the scripture.
[1:48:34] And they will worship him.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's all part of the scripture. Do you
[1:48:38] see where I'm coming
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; now? Now, now we want to come down, and
[1:48:41] this is what I want so badly to do to
[1:48:44] come down to this end time season that
[1:48:46] we're in. There are certain things.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; I'll be very specific. Who's in China?
[1:48:54] You say Murphy Wong's in China. I'm
[1:48:57] going to correct that and say Jesus
[1:48:58] Christ is in China.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Who's in Vietnam?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is in Vietnam.
[1:49:08] who's in Uganda. Jesus Christ is in
[1:49:10] Uganda
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; and those young people and the minister
[1:49:15] himself and brother Kim and all others
[1:49:18] and the other ministers of this message
[1:49:21] and the different places around the
[1:49:23] world. They we we know them by name.
[1:49:26] That's their natural name. But who's in
[1:49:28] that country? Jesus Christ is in that
[1:49:31] country.
[1:49:33] Very few people have a revelation of
[1:49:36] that.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; We were, brother Milo and I and my wife
[1:49:41] were in Yugoslavia
[1:49:43] and met Martin Lon who was here and some
[1:49:46] of you remember him and we were with his
[1:49:49] mother and were taken to her house when
[1:49:53] she was just a 15year-old girl and
[1:49:55] looked at the mantle big mantels that
[1:49:58] heated the place. There was actually
[1:50:00] sufficient room for a girl, her at 15
[1:50:03] years old, to sleep on that mantle. And
[1:50:06] she said that she was one night, late at
[1:50:09] night, she says about the middle of the
[1:50:10] night, a heavy knock came on the door.
[1:50:15] So just a heavy poundering on the door
[1:50:18] and there was snow on the ground. It was
[1:50:20] winter time. And uh her father,
[1:50:23] stepfather was an alcoholic.
[1:50:26] and her mother and dad went to the door
[1:50:29] to open it and she jumped off the mantle
[1:50:32] who's coming at this time of the night
[1:50:35] way up in the mountain. We've been to
[1:50:37] that place and they opened the door and
[1:50:40] she said there was a large man. It
[1:50:42] looked like he filled the doorway and he
[1:50:44] stood there and with a thunderous voice
[1:50:47] he said Jesus Christ has come to this
[1:50:51] house tonight.
[1:50:53] He had a revelation
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and he was called the Bible man, the man
[1:50:58] of God. And five years, she was 15, he
[1:51:01] was 35. No, he was 50.
[1:51:05] And he came back five years later and
[1:51:07] married her and she became his wife.
[1:51:12] And she had three children. Two of them
[1:51:14] became Baptist ministers and one became
[1:51:17] the woman became a Supreme Court judge
[1:51:20] in Alaska. I met them all. sat in her
[1:51:22] home, have had lunch with them and
[1:51:24] dinner. And that woman said to me, said,
[1:51:27] "How did Brother Brandham say to have
[1:51:30] the Lord's table?" I said, "It's the
[1:51:34] communion and the footwashing." She
[1:51:37] said, "That's right." And she just some
[1:51:40] something within her. And so we say,
[1:51:44] "It's Jesus Christ. Who is it that's
[1:51:49] sending this message out?" That's right.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Say it's Jesus Christ.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just Jesus Christ in me moving,
[1:52:00] inspiring me. No, it's Jesus Christ in
[1:52:03] his coming.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the secret mystery.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; We don't realize it.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; We don't know it
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; until a prophet had to say it in such
[1:52:13] explicit terms and over and over and
[1:52:16] over again in just a line here and a
[1:52:19] line there. Let me tell you friends,
[1:52:21] Jesus Christ has indeed come
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; to us and in this generation in a
[1:52:28] different way to conclude his great work
[1:52:31] of redemption.
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes, please?
[1:52:41] So finally the spirit of God
[1:52:45] and in the and it now we're in the
[1:52:47] crisis the mystery of God revealed.
[1:52:51] I might have some of this for you.
[1:53:02] The coming of Christ is redemption in
[1:53:05] prog process or in progress. The
[1:53:09] physical arrival of Jesus Christ on
[1:53:11] earth was the culmination of all the
[1:53:14] events of redemption in the Old
[1:53:16] Testament. Christ was coming through all
[1:53:19] of the Old Testament saints.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; The hidden mystery. There's not a
[1:53:26] Christ. The mystery God revealed.
[1:53:31] I can't read. Thank you.
[1:53:34] the hidden mystery of God
[1:53:38] that he had in his mind before the world
[1:53:40] ever began
[1:53:42] and how that it's unfolded. Now, here's
[1:53:45] a prophet speaking. How that it's
[1:53:47] unfolded. So, he's saying the hidden
[1:53:50] mystery has unfolded.
[1:53:54] Unfolded itself. He didn't say I
[1:53:56] unfolded it or any man or church
[1:53:59] unfolded it. it unfolded itself right
[1:54:03] down to this present hour that we're
[1:54:07] living. He says then you will understand
[1:54:10] clearly then you see on uh I believe
[1:54:14] what is being done
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; now
[1:54:18] God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:54:23] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knew
[1:54:27] nothing about it. Even the angels didn't
[1:54:30] understand it. See he didn't reveal it.
[1:54:33] And that's the reason under our seventh
[1:54:37] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[1:54:41] there was silence.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; You read the seventh I've talked to a
[1:54:44] lot of people said I read the seventh
[1:54:46] seal and I was a I I was I was
[1:54:49] disappointed cuz they're expecting some
[1:54:51] great explosion. No, you can't get all
[1:54:55] the revelation at once. It must be
[1:54:58] little by little. You'll understand.
[1:55:01] You'll be faithful. You'll come to the
[1:55:02] house of God. You'll hear it from this
[1:55:05] side. You'll hear it through this
[1:55:07] vessel. You'll hear it through the
[1:55:09] messenger. And little by little, you'll
[1:55:11] possess and inherit your inheritance.
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And what you're actually doing is acting
[1:55:19] out what's written in the book of
[1:55:22] redemption. You are a part of the book
[1:55:25] of redemption. That's why the book of
[1:55:27] redemption had to be opened up, made
[1:55:30] known by a prophet messenger. Because
[1:55:33] then when the message was spoken, you
[1:55:35] had something to believe.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Now this is critical. Not something to
[1:55:40] think about, not something to argue
[1:55:43] over. You now had something to believe.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; You had a message. Not something that
[1:55:49] you could perform yourself. Not
[1:55:51] something you could physically do. You
[1:55:54] had something you could believe.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; And by believing, you are transformed.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And by believing, you better believe it.
[1:56:03] One of these days, by believing, you'll
[1:56:06] be transported.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason. So there was a
[1:56:18] reason why it even had to be silent. It
[1:56:21] has to be silent because it can't be
[1:56:24] told. It the whole record can't be told
[1:56:28] of the coming of Christ as a great
[1:56:30] secret mystery. The secret mystery is
[1:56:33] his coming and how he comes.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; He's coming through the bride of Jesus
[1:56:39] Christ.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet says in the seven
[1:56:43] seals and listen close. He says the
[1:56:45] seals is him. Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; the seals is him? In other words, he's
[1:56:55] unveiling himself. He's taking the cloak
[1:56:58] off. The seals is him.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; But further on in the message, you'll
[1:57:03] find out the prophet saying that she is
[1:57:06] him.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when he made himself known,
[1:57:11] she believed it and she became it.
[1:57:19] So then she became him.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Which is what it was in the beginning.
[1:57:25] There was a time when when Adam when Eve
[1:57:28] came out from him, he said he would call
[1:57:31] her, you know, bone of my bone and flesh
[1:57:34] of my flesh.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Everything had its origin in at that
[1:57:40] first Adam.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And and now we have our origin in
[1:57:45] Christ. Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; That's where we originated.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; We didn't originate in a natural human
[1:57:51] sperm. We originated in the mind of God
[1:57:55] who said this individual will come
[1:57:57] forth. All of this farm, all of this uh
[1:58:01] lineage is just it's just something I
[1:58:04] put in motion to bring this individual
[1:58:07] and that individual is going to act out
[1:58:10] part of my great secret which I'm
[1:58:13] holding with and the secret is I'm going
[1:58:16] to buy it back.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; This is the secret of redemption.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it back. I'm going to
[1:58:22] bring it back to its original state. I'm
[1:58:25] going to bring back original sons and
[1:58:27] daughters of God. Spoken word is the
[1:58:31] original seed.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; And so I'll speak the word. They'll
[1:58:35] believe it. They'll be born again.
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus when he was on earth, they wanted
[1:58:56] to know when he would come as a subject.
[1:59:00] And he said it's not even the son
[1:59:02] himself doesn't know when it's going to
[1:59:05] happen. See, God had all of this to
[1:59:08] himself. It's a secret. And that's the
[1:59:11] reason there was silence in heaven.
[1:59:14] That's the reason. Notice there was
[1:59:16] silence in heaven. I read a number of
[1:59:19] commentaries. I just scanned them
[1:59:21] because I don't study them, but I I read
[1:59:23] them to and because they said, "Well, it
[1:59:26] might be this one. It might be that."
[1:59:27] And you're going all over the map. I
[1:59:29] like to be able to read a message that
[1:59:31] doesn't leave me going all over the map.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says, "This is what it
[1:59:36] was."
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And they But they all agreed on one
[1:59:40] thing.
[1:59:41] The half hour silence. If we don't
[1:59:43] understand the half hour silence, but
[1:59:46] they said one thing is certain and they
[1:59:49] all agree on this. Something stupendous
[1:59:53] is about to happen.
[1:59:56] I said, "Boy, if you boys only knew what
[1:59:58] you were saying. Something stupendous.
[2:00:00] What could be more stupendous than in
[2:00:03] this degradation, in this filth and sin,
[2:00:06] I'm going to bring a spotless people to
[2:00:09] show the power of my blood, my
[2:00:12] sacrifice, my new creation, the
[2:00:14] beginning of the new creation. This
[2:00:16] isn't going to be a church. This is
[2:00:18] going to be spotless ones.
[2:00:21] This is going to be the redeemed ones.
[2:00:24] This is going to be the Exodus people.
[2:00:27] Hallelujah. And I'm going to come upon
[2:00:29] them with my own spirit until they know
[2:00:32] for certain they are sons and daughters
[2:00:35] of God.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And they also will have a part of me.
[2:00:42] They will actually live out my life by
[2:00:46] the Holy Spirit, thus living out their
[2:00:49] own redemption.
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:01:05] And the seven thunders uttered their
[2:01:07] voices and John was forbidden to write
[2:01:10] it. See the coming of the Lord. So he
[2:01:14] couldn't write it.
[2:01:17] That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[2:01:19] of how he will come and when he will
[2:01:21] come. It's a good thing that he doesn't
[2:01:24] know. He has showed or revealed it in
[2:01:28] every type that's in the Bible. So the
[2:01:32] types, but we didn't know what those
[2:01:34] types were till a messenger come and
[2:01:36] says, "Now there's Christ.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Here he is."
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; When did you hear Abraham chasing uh you
[2:01:45] know going after the kings? Was Christ
[2:01:48] going after Satan?
[2:01:52] You ever heard that? It had to wait till
[2:01:54] this end time. And and therefore, the
[2:01:57] entire Bible is the revelation of God's
[2:02:00] mystery in in Christ. And the entire
[2:02:03] Bible is an expression of one goal.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; How many goals?
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; One goal. Say it again. One goal that
[2:02:12] God had, one purpose he wanted to
[2:02:15] achieve in the entire Bible. And here it
[2:02:17] is.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You can memorize it if you want. And all
[2:02:21] the acts of the believers in the Bible,
[2:02:25] not all the acts of the believers, they
[2:02:28] did all kinds of bad things, but all the
[2:02:31] acts of the believers in the Bible. And
[2:02:34] the Bible even records some very, very
[2:02:37] nasty things, evil things, and sinful
[2:02:42] things that the believers did. Their
[2:02:45] acts are recorded in the Tamar's Tam
[2:02:49] Tamar's act of seducing her
[2:02:52] father-in-law is in the scripture.
[2:02:55] Listen to me.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ in her,
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; forcing her because it was Christ that
[2:03:05] had to come as a lion of Judah.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And Judah had no more sons
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; to give her seed. and she must she must
[2:03:16] restore the seed of the tribe of Judah.
[2:03:21] She wasn't wanting a man. She wasn't
[2:03:23] wanting a sexual experience. She wasn't
[2:03:26] wanting motherhood. She wasn't
[2:03:28] whimpering over anything. She knew this
[2:03:32] Christ must come.
[2:03:35] [Applause]
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; This is part of his coming. And if it
[2:03:39] means I have to be a harlot, so be it.
[2:03:43] If it means I have to lose my
[2:03:45] reputation, so be it.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; But that seed must come.
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let me put it in today's language.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it up to today.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; There's people who could go out and make
[2:04:02] a nice living.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; There's people who could go out and make
[2:04:05] a fortune. There's people who could go
[2:04:07] out and and and and become educated. And
[2:04:10] there's nothing wrong with that. There's
[2:04:12] nothing wrong with any of those things
[2:04:13] depending how. But there's one goal and
[2:04:15] that's God's goal.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; That's the only goal is God's goal.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; The only goal is God's mystery.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And as long as it's Christ in me that's
[2:04:26] doing these things,
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; whatever whatever it is, if I must lose
[2:04:30] my reputation, so be it. Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; If I must have a small church or small
[2:04:36] group of people or if we must meet in a
[2:04:38] house or if we must meet in a garage
[2:04:40] someplace, so be it.
[2:04:44] [Applause]
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks, I know what I'm talking
[2:04:47] about. We're in You're in a nice church.
[2:04:50] You're sitting in a nice pew.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; I in the success of business came to
[2:04:55] church four times a week and sat on
[2:04:58] unplaned
[2:05:00] planks.
[2:05:01] 2 by12 planks sitting on blocks of wood.
[2:05:06] You remember it,
[2:05:09] don't you?
[2:05:11] How many remember it?
[2:05:15] One,
[2:05:17] we got chairs later on.
[2:05:21] What were we sitting on when you were
[2:05:22] there, Violet?
[2:05:24] Chairs. I think it was a chair.
[2:05:29] God bless you, Violet. You're here.
[2:05:32] still here.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes through my
[2:05:38] mind.
[2:05:40] One day she's a young lady at 19 years
[2:05:43] old
[2:05:46] and she came and got saved as a result
[2:05:49] of her mother.
[2:05:51] Her mother, and you forgive me, Sister
[2:05:53] Violet, I'm sure you won't mind, but her
[2:05:55] mother was a cleaning woman
[2:05:57] in the P& exhibition grounds.
[2:06:01] And some of our young people, just like
[2:06:03] you young people, had a booth with a
[2:06:06] banner, Truly Elias shall first come.
[2:06:09] And some books of Brother Brham, not
[2:06:12] unlike what will be at the Lynen Fair.
[2:06:14] Brother Matthew
[2:06:18] and my daughter Marilyn went down to use
[2:06:20] the washroom in the horse barns, and the
[2:06:24] animal barns.
[2:06:27] And she's in the washroom and this
[2:06:29] little woman comes up to her and says,
[2:06:32] "Are you with those young people from up
[2:06:34] there at that booth?" Said, "Yes." She
[2:06:37] says, and she was real, she was real
[2:06:40] feisty in one way. She says, "I want
[2:06:43] what you got."
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; And she was in church up at the house
[2:06:47] and we baptized her. And then along come
[2:06:50] Violet.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Violet came in
[2:06:57] And she had a very good friend,
[2:07:00] a lady friend, girl friend I believe it
[2:07:03] was, out here in the valley someplace. I
[2:07:05] don't know all the details, Violet, but
[2:07:06] I knew that you were weighing out
[2:07:10] very much weighing out
[2:07:13] this whole thing.
[2:07:16] And we knelt at a chair. You remember
[2:07:20] it? I remember it well.
[2:07:23] And we knelt at a chair and just began
[2:07:26] to pray.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; And she sobbed and that was it.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Violet,
[2:07:34] that wasn't brother Ed.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; persuading you.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ in you
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; acting out
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; part of the book of redemption.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; You're living it. You're living it.
[2:07:51] Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; You are living it.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; I felt I'm here today to tell you forget
[2:07:57] about this life.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; The ultimate thing is you believe the
[2:08:02] word
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; that God sent.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; We believe on him who God has sent.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; We believe the vindicated message.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Where else is it?
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; There is no other place.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Simply by believing it. And you'll find
[2:08:18] all through the scripture when people
[2:08:20] simply believed it and lived it, just
[2:08:24] loved it, they're the ones that moved
[2:08:27] on.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm able to make myself clear.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine. Shut that off now.
[2:09:17] say
[2:09:20] who brought the message to you? If I was
[2:09:23] to ask you that question, you might say,
[2:09:26] well, so and so brought it to me.
[2:09:29] I would like to change your thinking
[2:09:31] this e this morning.
[2:09:34] And I want you to think on it the rest
[2:09:36] of the day.
[2:09:39] Some of you have been born. And I look
[2:09:40] at some of the young people, I say,
[2:09:41] "You've been born into homes that are
[2:09:44] believing homes."
[2:09:46] Say, "Well, my mother and dad, they
[2:09:49] believe the message." There'd be a lot
[2:09:52] more young people who would probably be
[2:09:55] in the house of God today if they
[2:09:57] realized that God in his divine mercy
[2:10:02] arranged for you. For whatever reason,
[2:10:05] he didn't want you to be all tied up and
[2:10:09] all ins snared and all tangled up in the
[2:10:14] world. So, he protected you from it.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Others for his own reason, he wanted
[2:10:20] them. Listen, the Apostle Paul, I want
[2:10:24] you to listen very carefully because
[2:10:26] Satan will work on
[2:10:30] your failures or your past and his he is
[2:10:36] so determined
[2:10:38] so that you don't see what the great
[2:10:40] mystery is and that you are part of that
[2:10:44] mystery.
[2:10:46] you. The mystery is Christ's coming.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; And you are part of that coming because
[2:10:51] you're bringing him on.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; You're bringing him on and and and I I
[2:11:02] want to bring you to Apostle Paul.
[2:11:04] Apostle Paul says of himself,
[2:11:09] and I don't know if you'd want to write
[2:11:10] it in a book, and maybe you're not uh
[2:11:13] you're not uh accountable for it, but he
[2:11:17] said, "I was a blasphemer."
[2:11:22] You know that he said that
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; I was a blasphemer
[2:11:27] and I consented to the persecution of
[2:11:30] the church
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; and he stood there and let the clothing
[2:11:36] the garments of Steven be at his feet
[2:11:41] while the people stoned him and killed
[2:11:43] him.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; And what a brutal thing it was
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; with stones crashing in. say you don't
[2:11:50] make it too vivid. You it'll never be
[2:11:52] vivid enough for you. And stones
[2:11:54] crashing in on that young man's head and
[2:11:57] to see him kneel down to ask God to
[2:11:59] forgive them and his his face shining
[2:12:02] with the glory of God that burned into
[2:12:06] the very soul region of Apostle Paul.
[2:12:10] And he said, "I was a blasphemer and I
[2:12:13] consented to their death and I
[2:12:15] persecuted the church and I put them in
[2:12:18] prison." But he said,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; "But I labored more than they are.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; I drove him.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; I failed God.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; I did things I'm ashamed of.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give my life so
[2:12:34] unreservedly.
[2:12:36] I'm going to do this kingdom of Satan
[2:12:39] damage.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; And you can say, you might say, what can
[2:12:48] I say? You can say, I've been birthed in
[2:12:51] the darkest of ages.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; I've been birthed in the most deceived
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; of the ages.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I've been birthed amongst people who are
[2:13:00] completely given over to satanic
[2:13:04] vulgarity.
[2:13:06] It's in the school. It's in the school
[2:13:08] library. It's in It's on the streets.
[2:13:11] And the people love it.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Is it so?
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you believe that.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And God has brought me here.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; I will give myself unreservedly.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Against the kingdom of
[2:13:26] Satan. I will give myself unreservedly
[2:13:30] to him who brought death to the people.
[2:13:33] And I will declare by my living I have
[2:13:36] life,
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; eternal life.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; And I shall
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; defeat
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; by his grace. I shall defeat death
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; either by a resurrection
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; or by a change of this body.
[2:13:58] I'm seeking that I might by God's grace
[2:14:01] invigorate you somewhat tonight or this
[2:14:04] morning
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; prophet said and he I'm I'm giving you
[2:14:13] some of these things that sounds like
[2:14:14] I'm being repetitious but I'm not. I
[2:14:17] want to give you some of the quotes. And
[2:14:19] he said, "I'll not give you this." And
[2:14:21] God talked to Moses and I'll give you
[2:14:24] the land in one year. I have an
[2:14:27] important point to make with this.
[2:14:31] I'll not give you the land in one year.
[2:14:34] For if I give you the whole thing to you
[2:14:36] in a year, that's the inheritance. If I
[2:14:40] give the whole inheritance to you
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; at one time, the wild beast will come in
[2:14:46] and consume you.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; But little by little
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; as you're able,
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; I will give you the land.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Now when they said, "I will drive out
[2:14:57] the enemies, the Hittites
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; and the Canaanites,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; they were sons of Ham
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; and sons of Heth. their lineage
[2:15:11] and he said I will drive them out.
[2:15:15] In other words, he said he would send
[2:15:17] hornets
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; and we we have to we have to put it into
[2:15:22] our language,
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; put it into our understanding. Okay, I'm
[2:15:27] I've come now I've come into the
[2:15:29] message. We sing the same as others and
[2:15:31] we worship the same and there's other
[2:15:33] churches and I have the same Bible. They
[2:15:36] have a King James and I have it and many
[2:15:38] of them have watered down translations
[2:15:40] etc. Listen close.
[2:15:43] There were all kinds of people, nations
[2:15:46] of people and cities of people enjoying
[2:15:50] the blessings of the promised land, but
[2:15:54] they were not the children of the
[2:15:56] inheritance.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the difference.
[2:16:01] Amen.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people that are
[2:16:04] good people that are Christians that are
[2:16:07] Catholics, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses,
[2:16:09] whatever more may be healed.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Harlot on the street can get healed
[2:16:15] because God honors faith.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean they're spiritual.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; That's part of the blessings
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; and people receive the blessings from
[2:16:23] God. That's not what it's about.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; It's not about blessings. And it's not
[2:16:28] about someone standing behind the pulp
[2:16:30] and I'm anointed. Of course you're
[2:16:32] anointed.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; But do you do you receive the word of
[2:16:37] God that God sent? Well, no. I found
[2:16:39] problem with that. Well, fine. The
[2:16:41] anointing is genuine. You're false.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it's the genuine
[2:16:52] Holy Ghost anointing. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Says it twice in false anointed ones. A
[2:16:58] genuine Holy Ghost anointing. And that's
[2:17:02] what makes us so deceptive.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, he's anointed. I know
[2:17:06] he's anointed." These are my words to
[2:17:08] brother Brandham. I know they're
[2:17:09] anointed because I know what the
[2:17:11] anointing is.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The rain falls." He just
[2:17:15] took four scriptures. The rain falls on
[2:17:17] the just and the I said the unjust.
[2:17:20] Right. In the last days, Peter said, "In
[2:17:23] the last days, sayith God, I'll pour out
[2:17:25] my spirit upon all
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; all flesh." Not all flesh is saved.
[2:17:31] He'll pour his spirit upon all flesh.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I've seen drunkards. I've seen all kinds
[2:17:37] of people want God and they they weep
[2:17:40] and they sobb and they beg and they want
[2:17:43] God and they want deliverance, but they
[2:17:46] don't want deliverance. They want help.
[2:17:49] They want to get to manage their sin.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; And Satan has just run rough shot over
[2:17:55] their lives.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm giving you good good advice this
[2:17:59] morning, friends.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Don't let any of the gods and God warned
[2:18:03] them. Don't let any of the gods of the
[2:18:05] land, don't let any of the gods, don't
[2:18:09] let the god of money, don't let the god
[2:18:12] of science, don't let the god of
[2:18:14] education, don't let the god of of uh uh
[2:18:18] popularity or fame or beauty.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Don't let those gods start to dictate to
[2:18:23] your life.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let the god of business dictate to
[2:18:27] your life.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; You're to be the master of it.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; And wherever whatever happens to you in
[2:18:37] the world, fine. But don't let those
[2:18:38] gods I've seen people who have allowed
[2:18:42] themselves to be dictated by the gods
[2:18:46] and the life spirals, just spirals
[2:18:49] downward.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Has this helped you this morning?
[2:19:01] I'm going to close now.
[2:19:10] I just rehearse now.
[2:19:15] Your life. Your life.
[2:19:18] And the reason I'm saying so much about
[2:19:21] this, your life is a mystery.
[2:19:24] Say really? Yeah. Tomorrow's a mystery.
[2:19:26] If
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; anybody can stand up here and say, "I
[2:19:29] have a thus sayith the Lord about
[2:19:31] tomorrow."
[2:19:33] I'll say, "First, you're either ignorant
[2:19:34] or you're a liar
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; because nobody knows for sure. You have
[2:19:39] aspirations.
[2:19:40] You might even be making preparations."
[2:19:43] But uh you don't know what's going to
[2:19:45] happen.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Anybody have their day or the schedule
[2:19:50] interrupted in this last week? Let me
[2:19:53] see your hands.
[2:19:54] Wow, there's a few h humans here.
[2:19:59] We had our schedule interrupted.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; And we went completely another
[2:20:03] direction. Isn't that amazing?
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; You know what that proves? It was a
[2:20:07] secret.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; And then then this thing, I'm trying to
[2:20:12] make his coming very simple. And then
[2:20:14] this thing come up
[2:20:16] and and there was really nothing you
[2:20:18] could do. So you just Well, I didn't
[2:20:21] expect this. I don't even know what's
[2:20:22] going to come of it. But you just
[2:20:26] waddle your way through it,
[2:20:29] you know. You just plow ahead. Plow
[2:20:31] ahead. And how many? I thought that just
[2:20:35] sounds silly, but it's absolutely true.
[2:20:37] Then you turned around and looked
[2:20:38] through said, "Wow, look, I just came
[2:20:40] through that."
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; You didn't know what that was till you
[2:20:45] lived it out. And then your life
[2:20:47] interpreted what it was.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's why it was silent.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:53] because God was going to take a group of
[2:20:56] people and live out this part of his
[2:20:59] coming.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; We are here for the closing chapter.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; and that's to take the mystery out of
[2:21:10] it.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[2:21:28] Amen.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; So in a sense we say well
[2:21:37] Christ is the whole book.
[2:21:40] That's exactly right.
[2:21:43] But and we hear about the open book.
[2:21:46] Well, the book had to be open.
[2:21:48] And the mystery or the secret of the
[2:21:51] book because the secret of the book was
[2:21:53] that this is the book of redemption.
[2:21:56] I've got I'm say I'm way out of my place
[2:21:58] here, but this is the book of
[2:22:00] redemption. It's called the book of
[2:22:01] redemption. That's God's great secret.
[2:22:04] How I'm going to redeem it back.
[2:22:07] I'm going to redeem it back to myself.
[2:22:10] So Christ's first coming to who who
[2:22:13] could who could predict? Isaiah said
[2:22:15] he's you know who's believed our report
[2:22:18] and to whom is the arm of the Lord uh
[2:22:21] shown and he says and how he comes and
[2:22:24] he'll be wounded and he'll be he'll be
[2:22:26] beaten and he'll be marred more than
[2:22:29] that of any man his visage will be
[2:22:32] marred more and and that they how could
[2:22:35] how could they ever understand who is
[2:22:38] listening that would be the son of God.
[2:22:42] How could they ever understand that?
[2:22:43] They couldn't understand. It's a total
[2:22:45] mystery.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; But it was all his coming.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; And here we are now. I'm just I'm
[2:22:51] closing right away. But here we are
[2:22:53] today and we've come into the knowledge
[2:22:56] of the message. And we've heard some
[2:22:57] very very astounding things been spoken.
[2:23:02] Brother Bran will reach out there and
[2:23:04] and say something and you'll just say,
[2:23:07] you know, where'd that come from?
[2:23:10] He'll make statements. And so there's a
[2:23:13] tendency just to disregard it. Don't
[2:23:14] disregard it. It fits someplace.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; And God will anoint some man behind the
[2:23:21] pulpit to make it fit.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; And it'll just come, you know, to me to
[2:23:26] me it's if you just even got this that
[2:23:29] he is those seals. You hear so much
[2:23:31] about the seals, the seals, the seals.
[2:23:33] What is that all? It's his coming. Amen.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; And the other part is he had to reveal
[2:23:38] it and have it spoken and told you
[2:23:42] clearly that this is the this is the
[2:23:44] season. This is the time. That's why it
[2:23:46] had to be made known. And when it was
[2:23:48] made known in a message, then you could
[2:23:51] believe it.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's what God has called the world to
[2:23:54] do, to either believe it or reject it.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; And you've seen and I I hear from
[2:23:59] different ones and they say, "Well,
[2:24:00] there's so much in the message and
[2:24:01] there, oh, forget it. there's only one
[2:24:04] message
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; and we just believe it. And they try to
[2:24:09] make philosophy out of it and tradition
[2:24:11] out of it. And that's old stuff.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; They've done that for generations.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; So I say to the people of God, I say to
[2:24:18] the people of this church, I say to the
[2:24:19] people that are that are streaming, just
[2:24:21] don't even pay attention to it. Don't
[2:24:23] give it any time.
[2:24:25] God has confirmed his word
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; and he has opened up the secret
[2:24:31] mysterious things. And the mysterious
[2:24:34] things was simply this. That was him all
[2:24:37] the time. You said, "Well, I thought
[2:24:38] that was me." No, that was him.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I thought that was me witness. I had
[2:24:43] such a wonderful witness. No, no, it
[2:24:45] wasn't you. It was the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; And that one had to hear it either to
[2:24:50] reject it or to accept it because that
[2:24:52] was him and his coming. We're in his
[2:24:55] coming. We're living out his coming. And
[2:24:57] that's why the prophet spoke about the
[2:24:59] bride coming of Christ. It's not the
[2:25:02] apostles coming. It's the bride coming
[2:25:04] of Christ. Because the bride is living
[2:25:07] out another part of redemption.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; The bride is the one that carries the
[2:25:16] seed.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; The bride is the one that becomes
[2:25:20] pregnantated.
[2:25:22] The bride is the one that brings forth
[2:25:24] Jesus Christ.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; As Mary did
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; in the culminating act.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; I know some are getting it, some aren't
[2:25:36] getting. I'll say it again. The bride is
[2:25:38] the one that carries seed.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; That is why when Eve come, Eve was the
[2:25:44] vessel for seed.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; That's why the serpent never came to Mo.
[2:25:49] Never came to Adam. He didn't have the
[2:25:51] facility to carry the seed.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; He came to Eve
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; because she had the faculty of the
[2:25:58] facility to carry seed
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; and pregnant her with the seed.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; And in the end time, our Lord Jesus
[2:26:05] Christ descends into Satan's Eden
[2:26:10] and finds his bride and pregnant with
[2:26:15] his seed.
[2:26:17] [Music]
[2:26:19] Hallelujah.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And restores it all back
[2:26:24] again. And you say, "Well, I had this
[2:26:26] experience. I had that experience. This
[2:26:28] happened. That happened." It It's not
[2:26:30] just something happened. I heard a good
[2:26:31] sermon. No, no, no. I want to get you to
[2:26:34] understand it's Christ and his coming.
[2:26:38] That was Jesus Christ I heard that
[2:26:40] morning in church. It's Jesus Christ
[2:26:42] that used me to witness to that person.
[2:26:45] Get the revelation that old brother in
[2:26:47] Yugoslavia got this day
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has walked in these doors
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; and you'll have a different kind of a
[2:26:55] meeting.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; You say this day I go here to church.
[2:27:00] Everybody goes to some kind of church.
[2:27:02] That's not what it's about. This day
[2:27:06] Jesus Christ walked here cuz I want to
[2:27:08] fellowship with others of my own kind.
[2:27:15] Hallelujah.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; I enjoy the word.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for my wife because I just
[2:27:38] get in locked in there and
[2:27:41] I just stay there hour. I I just say
[2:27:43] it's just amazing. I think I I just got
[2:27:45] five more minutes and man, I look at my
[2:27:47] clock and two hours has gone by. So when
[2:27:50] I'm when I say here I'm just going to be
[2:27:52] another couple minutes. Uh
[2:27:56] don't always feel it's going to be two
[2:27:57] hours, but we we're going down to
[2:27:59] Seattle tonight to be uh with the saints
[2:28:02] down there. And uh I only got to page
[2:28:06] four, so I got a few pages for them as
[2:28:09] well.
[2:28:10] You'll remember us in prayer.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, shall we?
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, we sang the chorus. I just want to
[2:28:20] thank you, Lord.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to sing that again because
[2:28:24] I just want to thank you.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you for bringing us this word.
[2:28:30] I want to thank you, Father, that your
[2:28:32] servant, your prophet, your messenger
[2:28:35] was uncompromising
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; and he would not waver with this word.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; And even though it was costing him not
[2:28:42] only friends, it was costing him
[2:28:44] reputation, they were saying all kinds
[2:28:47] of evil things. I'm so thankful that he
[2:28:49] was unmoved.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Where would we be if he had been moved
[2:28:54] or if he watered this thing down? We
[2:28:56] need to hear it in its full strength.
[2:28:59] And Lord, because we hear it in its full
[2:29:01] strength, we see the glorious light. And
[2:29:04] truly, we can say that the glory of God
[2:29:06] has shone upon us. Truly, we can say
[2:29:09] there has been a resurrection. We see
[2:29:12] dead bodies everywhere. We see violence
[2:29:15] everywhere. We see, oh God, we see
[2:29:18] something else. And we see a people
[2:29:20] rising out of the earth. Oh God with the
[2:29:24] sun has shone upon them and life has
[2:29:27] come back the original life to the
[2:29:29] original seed not in the shock anymore
[2:29:32] as your prophet said it's not in the
[2:29:34] shock the glorious saying it's in the
[2:29:36] word it's in the seed and here we are
[2:29:39] here we are people that have come forth
[2:29:42] father I pray you will bless this
[2:29:44] congregation
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; give them a mighty afternoon and a
[2:29:47] mighty day and I ask especially Lord a
[2:29:50] special request that your Holy Spirit
[2:29:53] will bring these things to them to
[2:29:55] ponder. May they ponder upon them
[2:29:58] deeply. And that as they read and read
[2:30:01] your word and as they study and read
[2:30:04] your message and they hear your servants
[2:30:06] preach, I pray father you will spark uh
[2:30:10] the realities of this glorious gospel to
[2:30:13] them in Jesus name. take these words
[2:30:16] that have been spoken, Lord, as perhaps
[2:30:19] uh broken up, but I just felt to talk to
[2:30:23] the people this way today. I ask that
[2:30:25] you'll make it a great great part of
[2:30:28] their spiritual life in Jesus name.
[2:30:31] Amen.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:39] I just want to thank you Lord
[2:30:43] for letting me hear your word.
[2:30:48] Why have I not deserve such glory?
[2:30:57] Thanks for that special night
[2:31:02] when I saw your glorious life
[2:31:06] came to me with eternal life. Lord, I
[2:31:12] thank you.
[2:31:16] didn't have to open my eyes
[2:31:20] to the early
[2:31:22] past.
[2:31:25] All the age I were living in was fresh
[2:31:31] and mine.
[2:31:34] Then I heard recognizing your name.
[2:31:39] the sweet and perfect
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:43] for the tree and the blessing.
[2:31:47] Lord, I thank you. Let's rejoice now.
[2:31:52] And I just want to thank you, Lord,
[2:31:57] for letting me hear your word.
[2:32:02] What have I done?
[2:32:05] The glory you reveal is me.
[2:32:11] Thanks for that special night.
[2:32:15] And I saw your glorious high
[2:32:20] to face with eternal life. Lord, I thank
[2:32:26] you.
[2:32:29] God even my wildest dream.
[2:32:34] I think I cease
[2:32:38] at the time of the Lord. After
[2:32:43] my
[2:32:47] I
[2:32:49] now I see
[2:32:51] God is in this
[2:32:56] one word in your
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:01] I thank you
[2:33:05] and just thank you Lord
[2:33:09] for letting to hear your words.
[2:33:14] What have I done to deserve such glory?
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:23] Thanks for that special night.
[2:33:28] When I saw your glorious life, he made
[2:33:34] eternal life. Lord, I thank you.
[2:33:40] [Music]
[2:33:42] going to dismiss in just a moment, but I
[2:33:44] want to say we've got brothers that are
[2:33:46] ministering behind me, Brother John,
[2:33:48] Brother Tom, Brother Tim, and others. I
[2:33:51] can just preede that time by a wee bit.
[2:33:56] I want to tell you, I'm here now giving
[2:33:58] part of my own testimony. And there are
[2:34:00] times when I took this book
[2:34:03] and I was just as sincere as I am today
[2:34:07] reading it.
[2:34:09] And I would spend time I remember one
[2:34:13] time I was in the I was in the furnace
[2:34:16] room of a church out in the states
[2:34:19] someplace and I was on the concrete
[2:34:22] that's on my face before God cuz I had
[2:34:24] to preach that night. Not that I didn't
[2:34:27] have a message. I just praying that God
[2:34:30] and and I get behind the pulpit and just
[2:34:32] become absolutely electrified. But it,
[2:34:35] you know, it was maybe one simple page
[2:34:37] of a few notes
[2:34:39] and then then it happened. Then it
[2:34:43] happened. When I sing glorious light, I
[2:34:46] mean glorious light. When I say I don't
[2:34:50] you didn't have to do it, Lord. I know
[2:34:52] what I'm talking about. And now here we
[2:34:55] are today and these these men of God
[2:34:58] that are ministering. We got a fountain
[2:35:00] that is just flowing and it's available
[2:35:03] to you.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking that you as a result even
[2:35:07] of this service today. You if you
[2:35:09] wonder, well, what should I read? What
[2:35:11] should I Well, you could perhaps take
[2:35:14] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:35:16] So, well, I've read it. You want to You
[2:35:18] can hardly hold the pages together. My
[2:35:21] message book Christ it is you take it
[2:35:24] seriously
[2:35:26] don't worry about studying your exams
[2:35:28] you young people in school sorry brother
[2:35:31] Terry but
[2:35:34] you read this one and you read it
[2:35:36] prayerfully line by line
[2:35:39] and then you will understand even more
[2:35:41] what we're saying there it is I heard
[2:35:45] that over the pulpit there it is and you
[2:35:48] could read uh sers Sir, is this the
[2:35:50] time? And take the title. Brother
[2:35:53] Brandham is saying, "Sir,
[2:35:55] is this the time?" And then he gets on
[2:35:58] the message and he comes right to the
[2:35:59] seven seals and he says, "Uh, you know,
[2:36:03] almost like I almost hope not, but are
[2:36:06] we there? Is this where we're at? Is
[2:36:09] this what's happening?" I mean he just
[2:36:12] was and then and then he says in the
[2:36:14] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[2:36:15] says and then then you might understand
[2:36:17] what it's been trying to you know trying
[2:36:20] to hold all these things and trying to
[2:36:22] say it and trying to make it then you'll
[2:36:24] understand when you understand what it
[2:36:26] is you'll understand the pressure it's
[2:36:28] been on him trying to hold it glorious
[2:36:31] friends we're going to walk through the
[2:36:33] streets hallelujah of a new city of a
[2:36:37] kingdom that'll have no war no trouble
[2:36:40] That's where we're headed. That's this
[2:36:42] great thing and it's unfolding right now
[2:36:44] and you're part of it. That's a great
[2:36:47] honor. Hallelujah.
[2:36:50] Brother John, why don't you come and
[2:36:51] close in prayer? Would you please pray
[2:36:53] for us this afternoon? Would you please?
[2:37:01] Wonderful food. It's good food. It's
[2:37:04] eagle food. Let's thank the Lord for it.
[2:37:07] Lord Jesus, we're so satisfied this
[2:37:09] afternoon. We're so grateful for the
[2:37:11] word that's been coming to us, Lord.
[2:37:14] It's eagle food. It's rapture food. It's
[2:37:17] food getting us ready for a body change.
[2:37:20] Lord, this world is so sloppy, so
[2:37:22] corrupt, killing their own people. Satan
[2:37:25] is so happy with the kingdom he's tried
[2:37:28] to pervert over the ages. And Lord, it
[2:37:30] seems like right in the middle of this
[2:37:32] darkness, your word is coming to us
[2:37:34] stronger and stronger, getting us ready
[2:37:37] to get out of here. Lord, we feel like
[2:37:39] we're standing on the top of the stature
[2:37:41] of a perfect man, that great pyramid
[2:37:43] revelation, asking, Lord Jesus, let your
[2:37:46] presence make this real to us, Lord. Let
[2:37:49] it soak down into the vitamins of our
[2:37:52] lives, down to our fingertips, down to
[2:37:54] our toes, Lord. Don't let it be
[2:37:57] intellectual. Don't let us just be in
[2:37:59] church, God, but may these meetings
[2:38:01] begin to move in our hearts in a greater
[2:38:04] rapture, catching our children, catching
[2:38:06] those that are single, the older ones.
[2:38:08] Lord, we're getting caught away. Lord,
[2:38:11] you're bringing this down to where we
[2:38:13] can understand it. It's not a mystery no
[2:38:15] longer. It's not just silence no longer,
[2:38:18] but Lord, you're speaking the voice of
[2:38:20] the resurrection. You're talking to us
[2:38:22] along the road, God, and our eyes are
[2:38:24] coming open. We're recognizing our day.
[2:38:27] We're seeing the messages for us. And
[2:38:30] Lord, we want it to mean something daily
[2:38:32] as we surrender and as we yield. Lord,
[2:38:35] we don't want it to be fantasy. We don't
[2:38:37] want it to just be imagination. We don't
[2:38:40] want to make our ministers or even our
[2:38:42] pastor just a superstar. Lord, we want
[2:38:45] it to come down to us, Lord, where we're
[2:38:47] living in our homes where the message is
[2:38:50] becoming real to us. God with skin on
[2:38:53] it, Lord. Lord, would you get with
[2:38:55] brother Biscoll this afternoon as he
[2:38:58] travels across the border how so many
[2:39:00] times we've done it ourselves and to
[2:39:02] come to an evening me meeting weary and
[2:39:05] body but I pray the Holy Ghost would
[2:39:07] pick him up Lord may the shepherd of the
[2:39:10] flock Lord minister to the believers in
[2:39:12] Reon Lord at these junctions at these
[2:39:15] changes how we need your divine hand
[2:39:18] your leadership we want to see the guide
[2:39:21] Lord reach his hand out of the clouds
[2:39:23] clouds out of the fog. Just get our
[2:39:26] attention and say, "Sheep, this is the
[2:39:28] direction. This is where we need to go."
[2:39:31] And Lord, we believe it's going to take
[2:39:33] us back to our future home, back to all
[2:39:36] those things that are dear to us. Lord
[2:39:38] Jesus, bless the congregation today,
[2:39:40] Lord. Lord, we so are reveling in the
[2:39:44] presence of God. We just, Lord, desire
[2:39:47] to see it, Lord, in our lips, in our
[2:39:49] fellowship, in our conversation. I pray
[2:39:52] in the fellowship hall today and
[2:39:53] throughout this building and as the
[2:39:56] those go to their separate homes or
[2:39:58] places of fellowship that you would just
[2:40:01] raise the level of our anticipation that
[2:40:04] even our fellowship would be around the
[2:40:06] things of God that it would surprise a
[2:40:08] mother, surprise a father, surprise
[2:40:11] other of the young people in fellowship
[2:40:13] that someone is speaking about the Lord,
[2:40:16] speaking about the word. But let it
[2:40:18] become common. Not in a a common way,
[2:40:21] but let it just become our way of
[2:40:22] speech. Let it just become our way,
[2:40:25] Lord, that we're living off of the food
[2:40:27] that you're giving to us. Lord, take us,
[2:40:30] Lord, and heal bodies and bring homes
[2:40:32] together, Lord. Bring lives that are
[2:40:34] just confused. Bring it back to their
[2:40:37] rightful place, God. May eyes come open,
[2:40:40] Lord Jesus. Even out over the internet,
[2:40:42] Lord, there's many needs. There's many
[2:40:44] that are hungering and thirsting for God
[2:40:47] in their midst. Lord, would you bless
[2:40:49] them, Lord, with a divine visitation? Go
[2:40:52] with our pastor this afternoon. Just
[2:40:54] strengthen him as he goes along the road
[2:40:56] that the saints in Reton would have a
[2:40:59] wonderful time. And bless all of us,
[2:41:01] Lord, as we see the day approaching.
[2:41:03] This morning service is now history. But
[2:41:06] Lord, we want to see more of your
[2:41:08] greatness, more of your simplicity in
[2:41:11] our lives flow through the body. Lord,
[2:41:13] even as we close this meeting, God, may
[2:41:16] someone's heart just be filled with that
[2:41:18] anticipation that this is the truth.
[2:41:22] Someone could be born again, changed,
[2:41:24] filled with the Holy Ghost as they're
[2:41:27] walking out of this church. Lord,
[2:41:28] something could be moving in within
[2:41:30] their breast, Lord, that you have spoken
[2:41:33] to them. Lord, bless our day. We commit
