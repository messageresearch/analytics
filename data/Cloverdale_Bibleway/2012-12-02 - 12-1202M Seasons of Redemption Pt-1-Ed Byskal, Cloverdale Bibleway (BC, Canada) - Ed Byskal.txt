Come now and receive. Amen. There [singing] is [music] a fountain open in [music and singing] the house of David. [music] Oh, [music] and there [singing] are sweets of grace [music] slowing down from now and [music] [music] saints. Let's um let's go to him. Every single person here has a need. [music] There's people who are in the hospital. There's people who've been diagnosed with different things. [music] Everyone has a need. Let's pull one for another. No matter what the situation, let's [music] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we're here. We're loving you. [music] We're praising you. And even when this flesh fights against it, [music] we ask you, Lord God, to forgive us. We get slothful. We forget. [music] We forget about one another. But I've just been reading, Lord God. [music] We can't leave one behind. We're holding for one another, no matter if we understand the situation or not. and nothing's too big for you. You've done something for every single one of us in all of our lives. Lord, you healed me. You healed my brother. You healed my sister. We're all going through different things, Lord. But we're asking you to come, Lord God. That you not just be the guest of honor, but that you put the brother who's going to be speaking to the side and speak directly from your heart to our heart. Lord Jesus, we have need of you. We are failures in ourselves, but we are more than conquerors in you, Lord Jesus. So, we're asking you that whatever demon tries to hinder us, whatever demon tries to hinder the minister, Lord God, break the ways open. Give them liberty, Lord God, to speak what you have to speak to us, our young people, Lord God, from our youngest to our oldest, not holding anybody out. Father, speak directly to our hearts. Change our lives, Lord God. We're going forward. We're going on. We love you, Jesus. And we can't say it enough. We ask you to be with every prayer request, Lord God. [music] With every need, Lord God, regardless of the situation, [music] whether they pinned it down or not, there's somebody here, Lord God, who's saying, "Remember me. Remember me. Remember my son, remember my daughter, remember my uncle, remember my grandfather, remember my grandmother." We're putting every single one of them, Lord God, before you, asking you to hit the situation, Lord God, right on the head exactly where it is. We love you, Jesus. And we're just asking, Lord God, not for theatrics, Lord, but we're asking from the depths of our heart. Continue [music] to deal with us, Lord God, to don't leave us, Lord. We need you. We love you, Father God. We commit every single thing before you, Lord God. Take full control of this service. And your blessed name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. [music] [music] And God bless you. You may have your seats. Amen. It is so sweet to trust in Jesus. Brother David, want to greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're happy to have you here this morning. Looking forward to a wonderful day. And I trust you've put your order in. We're here to give 100%. We know that God never disappoints. Amen. So, let's just take a few moments, prepare our hearts for the ministering of the word as our pastor is going to come. [music] Amen. It is so sweet to trust in Jesus. Have you found it so? Praise the Lord. Oh, it is so sweet to trust [music] in Jesus, just to take him at [music] his word and just to rest upon his promise. [music] Just [singing] to know the simple. Oh Jesus. [music] [singing] Jesus, how I trust [music] him, how [singing] I prove him more and more. [music] Jesus, Jesus, precious [singing] Jesus. Oh, more grace [music] to trust [singing] him all. And know how sweet [music] to trust in Jesus. us to trust [singing] his cleansing [music] blood and just [singing] in sinful [music] way to bless me [singing] healing cleansing [music] blood. Oh Jesus, [singing] Jesus how I trust him. How [music] I prove more and more Jesus. [singing] Jesus preious [music] Jesus. Oh, grace to [music] trust [singing] in Lord and yes to trust [music] in Jesus. Just from sin [music and singing] and self to see and just [music and singing] from Jesus simply say life [music and singing] and joy and peace. Oh [music] Jesus, Jesus, [singing] I trust [music] him and now I prove him all and [music] Jesus. Jesus Christ [music] for grace. I'm so glad I learned to trust my soul. [music] And I'm so glad [singing] I learned to trust. [music] Precious [singing] Jesus, Savior, [music] and I know thou art with me [music] will be with me till the end. Oh [music] Jesus. Jesus, [singing] how I trust him, [music] how I tr Jesus. [music] Jesus, bless. [music] Amen. We're going to sing that fourth verse again. I'm gonna ask our sister Lois, does she come? [music] Get ready to sing for us. I'm so glad I learned to trust thee. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] and I'm so glad I learned to trust. Precious [music and singing] Jesus, Savior, and [music and singing] I know that thou art will be till the [music and singing] end. Jesus, Jesus, how I trust thee, how I [music] all Jesus, [music] Jesus, rest, all [music] the way to trust in glorious &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The streets were dark and empty in Jerusalem [music] that night as silently the Old man made [music] his way. [singing] He'd heard a lot of rumors, so to put [music] his mind at rest, he'd see just what the master had to say. [music and singing] Some heard him say that you're a [music] man come from God. And I've been searching for some peace of [singing] mind. I've looked into [music] philosophy, my custom and my creed. But peace of mind is something I can find. Surely I say unto you, you must be born [music] again. A new birth of the spirit is the key. There's no other [music] way by which a man can enter in. You are the way [music] the kingdom he can see. So I beg forgiveness, but I just don't [music] understand how it is that man is born [music] again. [singing] Can it be that he must die and then to live again [music] or go a second time into the world? Surely [music] I say unto you, you must be born again. A new birth of the spirit is the king. [music] There's no other way by which a man can enter in. [music] No other way the kingdom he can see. I am but mortal [music] flesh, yet my spirit it can live. [singing] Such a thing I've never heard before. [music] Oh, the marvelous mystery that I should have that key and with it [music] I can open heaven's door. Surely I say unto you, [music] you must be born again. I knew by the spirit is the key. [music] There's no other way by which a man can enter. No [music] other way [singing] that kingdom you can see. [music] Surely I say unto you, you must be born again. A new birth of the spirit is [music] the key. There's no other way by [music] which a man can enter in. No other way the kingdom he can see. [music] No other way the kingdom he can see. [music and singing] Hallelujah. Thank you, Sister Lois. Amen. We're going to take the offering. I want to sing blessed be as I prepare to take the offering this morning. [music] Amen. Blessed be your name. Oh, [singing] blessed [music] be. Oh, blessed be. [music] Oh Lord, blessed be your name. [music and singing] Oh, blessed be. Blessed [music] be blessed. Blessed be [music and singing] blessed be. Oh blessed [music] be. Blessed be your name. [music] Oh, blessed. Oh, blessed. [music] Oh, blessed. You are and you Lord are a [music] strong and mighty tower. Oh yes, you Lord are a strong and mighty [music and singing] tower for an ever present help in my [music] darkest hour. You're my hiding place [music] of pain. You are the rock [singing] on which I'm standing. You are worthy of [singing] my praise. [music] Oh, blessed me. Oh, blessed [music] me. Blessed be. [music] Oh blessed be. Oh blessed [music] be blessed be. [music] Amen. Just before we continue say I'm going to ask brother Tim if you come bless the offer. Ask the blessing on the offering this morning. [music] Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly [music] Father, Lord, what an honor to lift up this giving as a sacrifice unto you, oh God. Lord, that we might worship you through the [music] giving from the blessing that you have given us from how you've kept care of us, watched over us, provided for our needs, made sure, Lord, that we had that which [music] was necessary to provide. And we acknowledge you, Lord, first this morning. And we ask Lord your blessing now upon all that is [music] given. May you use it to your glory Lord. We're giving it to you Lord and we're asking Lord that you would be pleased with it. And Father we know that you'll bless the giver. We know Lord that you shall provide for each one of our needs. And so Lord [music] we commit this time of worship through giving into your hands for the glory of the kingdom of God in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, you, oh Lord, are the deep that I have [music and singing] searched for. You're the evering fountain [music] that my heart always thirsts for. You're the one who makes me whole. [music] You're the lover of my soul. And whatever [music] comes my way, I know you're in control. [music] So I sing blessed [singing] you. Oh, blessed [music] you. Blessed be your name. [music] Blessed be, blessed be. [music] Blessed be. And let your people proclaim. Let your people proclaim. [music] You are holy. Oh, we sing. [music] You are holy [singing] God. We lift up [music] your name and we glory. We [music] give you your name. [music] Let your people proclaim. You are holy. [music] For you are holy [music] God and we lift up your name and give holy [music] glory to you. You sing it again. Let your [music] people sing. and your people proclaim that you are holy. [music] Oh, you are holy [singing] God and spirit of [music] your name and you glory. [music] You glory. Oh, singing [music] blessed be. Oh, blessed be. Oh, blessed be. Blessed be [music] your name. [music] Blessed be blessed. [music] Blessed be your name. Hallelujah. [music] Amen. As we invite our pastor to come, why don't we sing? In everything, give him thanks. In the [music] good times, we'll praise his name. In the bad times, we're still going to praise his name. Amen. In everything, [music] everything [music] we give him [singing] thanks. Give him thanks [music] in everything. [singing] [music] Everything. Give [singing] him praise. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Give us a good time. Praise [music] his name and in [singing] the best time we'll [music] do the same. In everything we give [music] the king of kings all [music] [music] everything. Give him [music] thanks. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; for you. Every [music] just [music] praise his name and [music] the night. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; in everything the king [music and singing] of kings all [music] the good time [music] and that time [music] we will do and everything. Give [music and singing] the king of kings all the way. [music] [music] Isn't it wonderful? Hallelujah. I was just thinking while we were singing, I don't know if there is any bad times for the believer. God turns them into uh productive times and positive times. And sometimes we have to go through a little while and then we look back and uh I think it was Tom that preached a subject that I doubt any of us really forgot. Who said it's bad? you remember that it's been repeated many many times. Well, God bless you all for being here this morning. Uh I just feel different about the service, feel different about the word. Sometimes we just experience a little something that causes us to look differently on things. And I I trust that will be your experience also uh this morning. Amen. And perhaps something can be said that from today forward &gt;&gt; you we can look at things differently. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the message differently. Look at the word of God differently. Uh this last week as many of you already know our brother Jonathan Wman passed into the presence of the Lord. Brother Jonathan had had a a a stroke as a result of a quite a massive bleed in the in his brain. But uh there was good reason to believe that he was uh somewhat conscious of what the people around him and what was being said and so on. Uh he passed into the presence of the Lord yesterday at about 3:00, a little bit after 3:00 in the afternoon, and the entire family was around his bedside at the time. And and they simply said, "All was peace." &gt;&gt; And we're happy for that. Uh we don't have uh full details of a memorial services as yet, but we're anticipating Tuesday, this coming Tuesday. Uh we'll we hope we can make the announcement tonight. Uh but we're not we're not absolutely certain, but we will attempt to make it tonight. And if we are unable to give the exact time and place, then you'll have to phone the office. And I'd like to make a special request because we haven't got a meeting between this evening and Wednesday evening that uh if if we're able to notify you or you're able to determine exactly the time and the place, please take it upon yourself to phone as many others as you can also and let them know. But we hope that we will be able to let you know this evening uh after the service. Uh and I'm sure also many of you know brother uh brother Jonathan was not able to uh work just part-time and different jobs um in this last few months. So we're going to take an offering after the service this morning. We're just going to I'm asking the deacons to have some baskets out in the foyer and if you'd like to just be able to give to Sister Clara and help her at this time, it would be very very much appreciated. And I'm sure we all can uh sacrifice a little and remember our sister Clara uh at this time as you leave this morning. Also, our brother Lonnie Jenkins is uh in the hospital. He had been in the hospital and then uh was taken home. The doctors said they weren't able to do any more for him. Uh cancer had uh taken uh a large cancer area and they said that they weren't able to do anything more for him. However, uh while he was uh while he was home and just fully alert and coherent and so on this last week, I felt I just felt uh very very impressed one day to uh write him. Of course, I knew that the any communication was going through brother Jeff and uh so I sent it to brother Jeff and asked him please take this and read these words to your father. I just began to relive and feel uh the times that we were together. Um we traveled much of the world together and ministered uh oh I don't know how many times probably eight or 10 times the conventions in Norway where the people from Sweden, Finland and Denmark would gather for the convention in Norway and uh we ministered there ministered in Sweden in Finland in u Malawi uh I remembered So well uh he and I driving and having a brother drive us in the jungles of Malawi with elephant grass that must have been 12 or 15t high. The path we were on was a was a path that people walked on. So, anything beyond the path, we just mowed down with a car uh this grass and looking for uh a village and village as you can scarcely see with that tall grass and so on and and our driver got out and and he was looking, you know, trying to see where where we're supposed to be going and it was a all I know it was above 80° and our windows had to be rolled up because if they didn't, the grass just came back on and all the uh seeds and bugs and whatever more might be in the grass was coming in the car. So, we had the car sealed up and I was melting. I just didn't know if there would be anything left of me when we got to wherever we're going. So, I said to our driver, I said, "You know, where are we going?" Well, he thinks it's out this way. Anyway, long story short, we uh came to a village, just a tiny village, and they were waiting waiting for us to speak to them about this message, a man and his wife and family. And it was just quite an experience. And I just wanted to say once again, it's not only to pray for the family, you know, and pray for brother Lonie's family, but uh something more than that. I think we ought to give glory to God that he allows a life like this, a real soldier. You don't have to look far, friends. They are around us. Real soldiers. I mean, Brother Lonnie's been a prisoner of Jesus Christ. He's been a prisoner to this word. And of all the years that I was with him and they were here, brother Lonnie and brother Jeff were part of this congregation for perhaps two and a half or three years. And uh I can say that you talk about an even uh just an even character. I never saw him ruffled. I never saw him uh and when you're traveling it it it can get pretty trying sometimes. So, we're thankful that God has sent these kind of people along and we're we're thanking God for the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we just pray that God will bless the family that are together. Uh, brother brother John Andy's and brother Kyle Morton, they are in Lima today. So, I don't know if they'll be able to make any contact or whatever, but they're having meetings with brother uh Craig Boore, who was our camp speaker this last year. And I have been also speaking with brother Craig in the last few days. So, uh, we we have lots to be thankful for &gt;&gt; and we have lots to pray about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, you feeling good? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll give the glory to Jesus &gt;&gt; and tell of his love. &gt;&gt; Did you just come to church today or are you expecting? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you expecting? &gt;&gt; Cuz anything that I have to say depends on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If this is a flop, I'm going to blame you. Hallelujah. Why don't we stand? Why don't we sing? We'll give the glory to Jesus. I just feel like giving him praise. Hallelujah. Uh, I can tell you that Jonathan Walman, though he was a man of few words, [music] right now I believe he's saying some words. I believe he's thanking God. [music] Hallelujah. Maybe looking over the banister. I don't know. We're rejoicing. [music] &gt;&gt; It said, "Rejoice with them that rejoice." And we perhaps sorrow with them that sorrow. But anyone who sorrows on this side, [music] there's no sorrow over there. You believe that? You're believers, aren't you? [music] Amen. All right, let's just sing it. We'll give the glory to Jesus [music] [music] and tell his love, his wonderful [music] love. We'll give our glory to Jesus [music] and tell his [singing] wonderful love [music] to give the glory to Jesus [music] and his love. His wonderful song will give his [music and singing] glory to Jesus [music] and tell his wonderful love. &gt;&gt; Before we turn to the scripture, let's bow in a moment of prayer. [music] Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth, [music] giver of every good gift, the author of life. We thank you for the lives of your children, the redeemed. For none can be redeemed outside of the blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice [music] for sinners came into the world, oh God, to redeem the world. [music] We pray, Father, today you'll make things so abundantly clear. I pray that there will be a spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, the spirit of adoption that will come upon the people. [music] And may their understanding, oh God, be more than just an understanding. May it be a revelation, something that's revealed to the inner man. Lord, I pray you'll give us uh not only understanding and clarity of thought, [music] but may we be illuminated by a divine light and power in the name of Jesus Christ. [music] For you'll anoint both speaker and hearers in Jesus name. Amen. I'll invite you to uh turn with me to book of Romans the 8th chapter. We were in Seattle last Sunday evening and had a nice time. And for those of you that were there, and there was a number that came down with us, uh, I'm going to be saying some things that we spoke there and also spoke here. I want to put some things together. I have been and I I I trust you just feel at home this morning. I feel very much at home and don't be too time conscious but I want to I want to say some things and I would ask that those that are uh students you know what study is I want you to really put your thinking cap on this morning and because I want to uh declare some things of my own convictions and why we believe and I believe we should be able to say why we believe certain things should we not &gt;&gt; every man should be ready to give an answer. We'll be reading uh starting at the 18th verse. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy uh to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willing, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to the redemption of our body. And I'm calling that the final act of redemption. &gt;&gt; The redemption when everybody's acquainted with death, but we're not all acquainted with resurrection. But when there will be a resurrection of those that have died in Christ in the faith and those whose bodies, as the scripture has declared, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; And friends, that is something that is so incredibly important. We ought to make that the object of our lives, &gt;&gt; the resurrection. and to participate and to be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I do not want to be in a hole in the ground &gt;&gt; when a resurrection takes place. &gt;&gt; When there's a resurrection that's promised, I think that ought to be a fervent uh that ought to be the fervent objective of every person regardless of what age we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. A scripture that we used also in the previous uh services uh was out of Ephesians and just one line the we're uh instructed by apostle Paul there also redeeming the time because the days are evil so we don't know we don't need anyone to tell us the days are evil but redeeming the time which is uh simply from the dagot the original securing the season for yourselves and that has inspired me very much. Securing the season for yourselves and I've called this seasons of redemption. I thought before I would even speak, I want to make a a comment to your personal declaration. Uh why do I believe this message? Because I believe that I could prove to you if we had time and we have over the years I could prove to you that the one who spoke through God's prophet in this generation was exactly the same one who spoke through Isaiah the prophets of the Old Testament. And the reason I say that is because God came in behind and confirmed that the intelligence that was causing him to speak and utter words was not man's intelligence. &gt;&gt; And that is there's been great leaders and great men and great women I suppose in the past and and men that were gifted and this is not a gifted man merely. That's not a gift. people who want to say and that's where the denominations went completely all sideways and wrong. They thought well it's a gift. uh there's all kinds of gifted people. But when a person uh can can stand in front of the multitudes of people year after year after year from the beginning to the end and to any intelligent person, I'm talking about a person with normal intelligence. Look at that and hear what is being said and assimilated in your mind. And you have to come up with the conclusion that this is not a man speaking. &gt;&gt; And that's where I'm coming from. And where the scripture I've I've mentioned this many times. I'm taking my time in incidentally. I'll just go as far as I can this morning then stop and we'll take pick it up later. But the reason I say that is because as brother Brandham has said, a prophet is a reflector of God. &gt;&gt; He's made so that he cannot speak his own words. It has to be God's words that he speaks. He's just a reflector and he's God's mouthpiece. And so therefore he said a prophet said now you know that you've heard these things many times but now I want you to take them because this is going to be a lesson and I'm going to move uh from one thought to another. You need to link them together. So the prophet Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive. Brother Brandham said he probably didn't understand that. Now, brother Brandham could say that from experience is speak things that he didn't understand. The prophet spoke things they didn't understand. Sometimes we do also, but he said he couldn't understand it, but God had spoke it through him. And finally, listen class, finally those words anchored in the womb of a virgin, and she conceived and brought forth Emmanuel. It was not some thunderous voice from heaven or some strange spectacular phenomena. God's words that he spoke through human lips &gt;&gt; that had prophesied a virgin shall conceived. Those words lodged &gt;&gt; in the womb of a virgin and she conceived and brought forth &gt;&gt; the man son of God Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why he's called the son of God because God spoke it hundreds of years before said a virgin shall conceive. Once God said it, it must come to pass. He's the creator. The man isn't the creator. Isaiah is not the creator. William Brandon's not a creator. They are vessels through whom God has chosen said, "I'm going to speak through you." &gt;&gt; And then when men receive it or when men hear it, they can take all kinds of positions on it and say, "Well, um, I don't understand it." That's fine, but I respect it. Uh, others might say, "I believe it. I believe it because something within me witnesses." And you don't know, but it's the very spirit of God in you that's witnessing. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. How can you explain the phenomenal things? How can you explain supernatural things with a natural tongue? You cannot. &gt;&gt; See? So then then the scripture says concerning the birth of Jesus Christ, we're just coming up to Christmas season. We know that this isn't the season of his birth, but nevertheless, here's the here's the scripture now. And it just details everything concerning the the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. This is how it happened. And there are several verses in Matthew starting in the first about starting about chapter uh chapter 1 verse 22. But don't look to it now. I'm just that's what I'm going to detail it. Now all this was done. All what was done? All the details concerning the birth of Jesus Christ. All this was done. You following me? &gt;&gt; That it might be fulfilled. Now, we did all of this. That's what the Bible's saying. All this happened for one purpose, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. So that was in the season of his birth. on down the road as Matthew's recording the life of Jesus and then he's coming towards he's coming now to where where all the great things have have more or less ceased and he and people don't know and his own disciples don't know why he's not continuing on with the supernatural uh supernatural miracles and all of these things and then uh you know they're being troubled over it and even wanting to protect him from it. Peter wants to protect him from it. And the Bible tells us, "But all this was done." Now this is at the other, this is coming out of the season of suffering. All this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. So one is his birth and one is his This is why I believe this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. is because I am more than convinced more than convinced given my whole life to the fact that that's the same God &gt;&gt; that spoke the things in the scripture that uttered the things that we hear today and there are things we don't understand. There are things that have happened and taken place and things that we still look forward to. I haven't experienced uh the resurrection of the dead. But the same God who said that a virgin shall conceive. He's the same God who said that he would take and open up seven seals. and the and although I read the seven seals book, you have read the message and perhaps you might say, well, I don't understand and all of this and it seems to come from different directions and so on and there's so much in here and it's perhaps against denominationalism. Let me say it could you a person could do an an an analysis of the seven seals and you'll find that he's talking about denominationalism because he's taking the covers off of Satan's deception. And what does that mean to us? He may talk about national things and political things so that we don't get all wrapped up and looking for some kind of savior to help us. and and uh and he speaks about those things so that we will have clarity. You could just summarize it all and saying it's protection on one hand. It's a it's revealing our situation and telling us what is going to happen and telling why Israel is where they are and what is happening over there nationally. And people get all engrossed in in in the dayto-day things. friends, this whole thing's passing away and we're a we're a group of people here, but you're just a teaspoon of ashes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now I go on from there now securing the season that we are in. Prophet said that God allotted his word to each age. And as the age comes along, now I'd like to just say something during this service and that's why I mentioned students earlier is because I have spent an incredible amount of time just to get one line out of here and one line out of there and put them together. So that the continuity of thought is that's the very best I could do for you. So I really appreciate your real close attention. So now God has allotted a certain amount of time to each age and as the age comes along. He said he sends someone there to vindicate that word. So God has allotted a certain amount of word to each age and he sends someone along to vindicate that word. And when you see a supernatural vindication that no man can do, this isn't some man's claim. This is what God allows some man to do. &gt;&gt; It happens. And you can look at it as critically as you want. And you're going to have to come up to a conclusion that is supernatural. Right. &gt;&gt; Then if God puts it on in this modern age that we're on when in the first message brother Vom we have recorded says now they have a a new recording gadget and and and that's a very specific purpose so that we in this age would be without excuse. we would know that this is a supernatural and then when we determine it is that kind of voice that it is God Almighty speaking then it's incumbent upon us what does it mean to me and what [clears throat] am I supposed to do about it and he says and in the days that we are now living in there is an allotted word not only a lot of time but there's an allotted word a promise for this age and we believe that the Holy Spirit is here on earth now trying to find hearts. He's doing it this morning trying to find hearts. I heard that brother Tom spoke to the students at the school and gave each one a piece of paper. They took a piece of paper. I don't know exactly. And who could say that they knew they were born again? They didn't have to put their name on it. did not have to identify themselves. Who is born again and who may not know that they're born again and who are not born again. And I understand that there was far too large a percentage for our school and our students who come here and listen that could not say they were born again. Perhaps as many as half. Uh, I would say that if you're sitting here and you are, this service is for you, that you need to have something. If your teacher stands up or your principal comes into your room and says something or a minister stands behind this pulpit and says something, we're not here to to eat up some of your time. &gt;&gt; We're here to speak truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here to present something to you that you can say, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it, then you need to know why you don't believe it. But you need to give yourself. You'll never come to believe it unless you give yourself to believe it. &gt;&gt; And we would not want to think that we brainwash anybody. We want to present you. And I'm presenting you with supernatural. If you want to turn away from supernatural things, well, I don't believe it anyway. Well, brother Brown said it's like going down the basement and a man saying, "I don't believe the sun is shining." &gt;&gt; You can you can just be willingly ignorant if you want. The Bible says that. But I want to be willingly willing to hear truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when a when a message has and you are able to say as believers uh I don't the reason I believe this I don't believe this just to be you know uh uh uh kind of a light light think about these things lightly but because there is uh 1100 almost 1,200 messages recorded where you can hear live and there's been live witness and live testimony. 20. Now, you might say, "Well, Brother Ed, I I know all these things." No, it's not that we know it. It's what we do with it. &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture says in Ephesians that we grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby we are, you're sealed until the day of your redemption. You are sealed until the day of your redemption. And he said that's the genuine true Easter seal. It shows that number one, sin has been paid for. And number two, that God has accepted you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And number three, that you're sealed into Christ. And Christ is the word. We're not sealed into a paperback book. We're not sealed into some mythical story, but we're actually sealed into one that can do more supernatural things in the next few minutes than we could even expect beyond our expectation. To be sealed is number one, for security. For security from Satan, you're sealed. Things that are sealed up are concealed. They're also hidden and held secret. &gt;&gt; Think of it for a moment because of what I will say in a in just a couple minutes. And kept in silence or kept secret. Things that are sealed in order to prove in order to prove or confirm something beyond any doubt. When it's unsealed, it's proven to as a testimony that he is what he professes to be. if something is sealed. All right. Uh now, if you should try to say to me, we don't believe you're the son of Ed Biscll, uh or the son of Fred Biscll. We don't believe I I would just smile and that's fine. You You believe what you want to believe. I happen to know where I come from. I happen to know who used to spank me. I I I'm very very well acquainted. I'm happy to know who brought the uh you know the the bacon home and and the food home. I happen to know that because I lived it. I experienced it. &gt;&gt; So a security that you know something is still I know when I was young and when we were young as as as some of these young people uh you know they don't know exactly what they're going to become. uh because it hasn't been developed yet. They don't know exactly what uh what traits, what characteristics are still in them that just have to be developed. And God is a great creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh so we were sealed. Maybe I'll just say this ahead of time. The bride body of Jesus Christ was sealed in Christ just like Eve was sealed in Adam. &gt;&gt; She was sealed both body her body and her entire character. All that she was, all her feminine traits were sealed in Adam. Would that be right? &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that we are sealed in Christ. We are hidden in Christ. &gt;&gt; We've been kept secret in tr. Now uh [clears throat] God help me here to just give you the scope of it because my mind is racing so many ways. Now the Bible says that Christ that he was the creator of all things. By him were all things made that are made. So it's a continuing. We're in time. We're mortals of time. I mean we're creatures of time. We're in the season, as the prophet said, we're in the season of mortal life. &gt;&gt; He is immortal. So, we can't put God into a box and say, well, uh uh you know, in in our time zone and things begin and things end. He's timeless. There is no time with God. So uh so God was in uh as Jesus said to the religious people of that time to the scribes and the Pharisees he said uh if you had believed Moses you'd believe me &gt;&gt; because he was a reality back in Moses time. He talked about Abraham and and and who Abraham worshiped. He says before Abraham was I am. So he was the reality back then. Here's the reality all the way through. All the scriptures that were written were spoken of him. And here we are now. We're in another season. We're not in a season of prophesying. We're in a season of fulfillment &gt;&gt; of those things that have been prophesied. So all I'm trying to say now in summary is that this is a this is a a a season. We talk about the season of redemption. There was a season when Jesus came and paid the price. Now, we're in a season where he's claiming what he paid. That's simple. You go to a pawn shop and you go in one time and and say, "Well, here's something here. You know, I want to pawn this off. I want to pawn this piece of jewelry. I want to pawn this piece of equipment off. What do you give me for it?" And well, they they give you a ticket and they give you $5 or 5,000 or whatever more and you leave it there. Then there comes a time when you're coming to claim it. Here I here's the ticket to show I paid the price and I'm I'm paying for it now and I'm receiving it to myself. So there's a a time of claiming it. So now he the brother Brandham said he is the one who opened the seals. &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say he is those seals. &gt;&gt; So now my question is what was sealed there? Oh, I'm going to read the seals book. The seals book isn't just a bunch of words. Like this just isn't a bunch of words. This is a person &gt;&gt; and he was sealed. That it is simply indicating that a portion of this book right here was hidden and sealed. And if it had to be sealed, it had to be unsealed at some point in time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saying and I'm de making these declarations to you. We are in the season. We are in the season when it was unsealed and when he was speaking there's so many things that indicate uh we can bring it for for example in the seals which is the the breach they have the uh God and simplicity and then the breach and right after the breach seals 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then the questions and answers and the seventh seal. So we say now is is this just a book? No, I want to say this is a record of a people. &gt;&gt; This is a record of a people. We don't understand everything, but if you are a believer elected for this age, you were sealed in there. &gt;&gt; The seals are Christ. &gt;&gt; So, it's like a a lot of people get married today, but they're not too sure who sure who they get married to. It's a great discovery. Marriage is a great great discovery. But I always say to couples, time is your best friend. And it is a it's a very very wise thing to get to know one another as the best you can prior to marriage because the more you find out before, the less you have to discover later on. Maybe that's just, you know, maybe that's just the way I am. But I, you know, it it's a great time of discovery. And so when there when there's a a young man, young woman, and and she's uh, you know, this is my fiance. I say it to so many, don't don't find out things later on. Find it all out ahead of time. I had a young man working for me one time and he he was going to get married and he wasn't he wasn't saved but he also came to church and he he really wanted to he admired our lives that I and my wife and my children. So he took me out for dinner and he said he said uh brother Ed. He said he didn't call me brother but he said he said do you think that he named the girl he was marrying. He said do you think she needs to know about all my bank accounts? And I said well it's hard to have things hidden. You know if you're going to take someone she's going to be you. You know you're going to become one. and he thought about it that you know he says well I'm not going to tell her he said I said well have a happy marriage you know he he going to start right off even before he got married holding some secrets about now there might be some of you here have a little secret bank account all I'm I'm not preaching at you I'm just simply saying what I believe I'm not I'm not going to tell her he pounded and even the dishes bounced on the table he hit it so But there was a time when the Lord Jesus just simply said, "I'm not going to have any secrets." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to unseal myself. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come and call her my bride and I will call her out of the churches. I will call her and she will know it's my voice. &gt;&gt; She will know it's not a man's voice. She will know it's not a preacher. It's not even just a prophet, but it is me myself and I will call her and she'll know my voice. And that's part of the book of the song, Song of Solomon. She says, "My beloved, it's the voice of my beloved." And all the other girls on the street says, "Who's your beloved?" &gt;&gt; Who who's your beloved? It was a total stranger to her to them. But to her, it was his voice. I hear the voice of my beloved. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking about that voice today. &gt;&gt; So he's he is those seals. He's the one that opened the seals and he is the seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened. And what was the opening of the seals then? He says the revealing of Jesus Christ. That's what it's all about friends. It's not a book on the shelf, but it's a person. So when the seals were broken and he said in one place, then you can seal see exactly what's in there. He talked about a box car being sealed, but it's full of full of material. It's full of commodities. It's all kinds of stuff in so someone can stand outside and say, "I want to tell you what's in that box car. This is what's in that box car." this. Brother Brandham says, "But when the seal is broken and you open it up, then you see exactly what was in there. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to come from left field, which I've been trying to do." I said that you were sealed in the seals &gt;&gt; because the seals were Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, if you can't put it together, that's fine. Just say amen anyway. and and and from the time of your birth all the way through there we in the time of this mortal season we have human life and human character and human frailties and human weaknesses and things we like about ourselves and things we dislike about ourselves. There are some things I think we probably hate about ourselves and we some things we would like to really change about ourselves. Well, there are things that are Christlike and things we display that are not like Christ. Well, I want you to know anything anything that was in Eve. Watch now, please. Eve was sealed in Adam when she came out. when she was brought forth and the Bible says that God brought the woman to the man and so whatever I know I don't know anything of the uh of of that season but I do know then then the serpent who was the most subtle came to her and through deception deceived her and I can tell you that the fall of mankind happened &gt;&gt; you accept that &gt;&gt; that will never happen again &gt;&gt; because this Eve, this second Eve, this bride of Jesus Christ is not deceivable. &gt;&gt; She cannot fall. &gt;&gt; Now, we carry some traits of the fall with us. But but but the scripture says and tells us that we are made new creatures in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so even though I may not see, the Bible says that we have risen in Christ. We're already risen in Christ. The prophet speaks of it all also. But I haven't I haven't experienced all of it yet. &gt;&gt; Okay, listen. Now, God said to Abraham, "You go walking through the land, and wherever you walk, that's yours." &gt;&gt; So he walked through the land. He just kept walking. Every place you put your foot, that'll be yours. And he never inherited one. He didn't inherit one meter of it, &gt;&gt; even though it was his. And then Isaac came and Abraham told Isaac, his son, all this is ours. And he didn't he didn't inherit it. He didn't have like ownership of it. And so what had been told him and what was in reality seemed very very different. But he kept believing what had been told him. &gt;&gt; And then came Jacob. And Jacob never inherited any part of it. &gt;&gt; But he remembered what had been told him. &gt;&gt; So it was what was promised. I have been promised and you have been promised. I've been promised a completely supernatural nature and fullness of the character of Jesus Christ. I've been promised that &gt;&gt; when you lose it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you lose it. &gt;&gt; Sometime you become irritated or impatient. I'm telling you that the promise declares that I am headed for a place in Christ. I have a place in Christ right now. That Christ is the same word. It's a He's promising me. He's telling me, you have to go through this. You have to take this journey. You have to walk this mortal life. You have to experience these weaknesses. You have to experience these trials. You have to experience these things. But there is coming a time because I promised it to you. you won't have this anymore. And so if we as believers, if we if we don't look at the promise and keep the promise in front of us, you're not supposed to keep all the failings in front of us and all the all all of the labors in front of us. If you keep that in front of us, you'll certainly have a very miserable life. But if you keep the promise in front of you, and Abraham could only say, he promised it. He said it. I don't even have a son yet. I don't even have someone to inherit it yet, but he promised that. &gt;&gt; He promised it. It's not up to me to fulfill the promise. He's going to do it that it's up to me to confess the promise. &gt;&gt; So, I confess the promise. IT WAS PROMISED. MALACHI 4 was promised. And you and and you CAN JUST LAY IT DOWN AND FORGET IT. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED. HE'S ALREADY SENT HIM. The world may have missed it, but he's already sent him. and and and Malachi 4 has spoken certain things and he said that the seals would be opened and so you can say the seals are open. Well, I don't even know what they mean. That that's just like Abraham saying, "I don't know what's over the hill, but just keep walking. You'll find out what's over the hill." YOU'LL FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE supposed to inherit and you'll find yourself becoming stronger in the faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So class &gt;&gt; please just hold fast to this. So the bride, her body and character, I will say that the bride body of Jesus Christ, the elect of God, our our our change, our body change, which we're so looking forward to, that body change lays in the promise because he has promised it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the original image. I've got to take my time. If I feel right, I won't be able to do it. But are you with me? All right. The original image. Now, I said this in Seattle, and I'll I'll I want to dwell on it just a little bit. You listening? When God said said, "Let us make man in our image, in the image of God created he him." Let us make man in our image and in our likeness and in the image of God made he him. Male and female created he them. And when he was done, he only had one he only had one image in front of him, &gt;&gt; one one that represented him, &gt;&gt; a son called Adam. And in God is all his attributes. And in Adam is all his attributes. God desired a family. He knew that Adam also would have the same desires because it reflected him. And so he took out from Adam. Now you're you're you're adult and I'm going to speak to you as adults now. So he took out from him a woman a place for his seed. &gt;&gt; God had created the whole earth as a womb. It was a place for his seed. Let it come forth. Let the waters come forth. Let the earth bring forth. Let it all bring forth. It wasn't let it die. Let it die. Let it die. Let it live. Let it live. Let it live. He's the author of life. It's man who brought the death. &gt;&gt; He's the author of life. Let it live. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when Eve came forth a place for Adam's seed and then she fell and brought brought the fall her husband with her and then God had a conversation with the serpent and this he said now I want you to follow with me very closely. He said to the serpent, he didn't say, "Why did you think this?" He didn't say to Eve, "Why did you think this?" He said to why have you done this &gt;&gt; this act? Why have you done this? And I'll put enmity between your seed and the seed of the woman. Now, the woman didn't have any seed. That's right. So God spoke then through the prophets &gt;&gt; said, you know, I'll give her a seed. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; So now that was God's seed coming and he's already told the serpent, I'm going to put enmity between your seed and her seed. Then came forth Jesus Christ and his seed held stones in their hand to slay him. Exactly like Cain held something in his hand to slay Abel. So it's identically the same thing. And then he said he said to uh the serpent he said dust shalt thou eat. Now he had just taken the bodies of Adam. Out of the dust the Bible says and out of the out of the dust of the earth he created a body for Adam. Now he said to the serpent, "Dust shall you eat." In other words, you will eat of death. You'll just eat of death. You'll feed on death. Is very important. Now, the only body that he has now fed on was the body of Jesus Christ. Because when the two men in their physical bodies ran to the tomb and the Bible says very clearly that the garment was rolled up here and the napkin around his head was placed over here, but the body they could not find. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it now for just a moment. Think about it because I have a I have a little distance to go. The body they could not find. Now friends, we've just announced here. Brother Wman has just passed and gone to have a burial of some kind or whatever more. Satan feeds on death, &gt;&gt; but he never can. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can never have the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to feed on. And the Bible says, now here's the promise. We can sit here. I'm white-haired. Some are white-haired. Some have lost their hair. Some of you are young and the beauty of your youth. But the scripture says he will give to unto us a glorious body like unto his body. &gt;&gt; Not the body that was bleeding with thorns in his head and mutilated. Not the body that had the beard pulled out of it. Not that body, but whatever came out of the tomb. AND THAT WAS A CHANGED BODY. Changed body. Because when they went and LOOKED IN THERE, THERE WAS NO BODY. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to ask you, you know, I'm filled with QUESTIONS ALSO. AND I'M ASKING YOU QUESTIONS. WHO CLOTHED HIM? &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're silent. Who clothed him? cuz he left the robes there to SHOW THAT NOTHING OF THIS WORLD. NOTHING OF THE OF THE LIFE THAT CAME BY A NATURAL BIRTH. Nothing was needed on the other side. &gt;&gt; And he was on THE OTHER SIDE. HE WAS FULLY CLOTHED. And Mary saw him and he looked like a gardener in THE GARDEN. WHERE HAVE YOU TAKEN HIM? SHE DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE CLOTHES are something newly created. OH, HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE WE OUR MINDS ARE SO CORRUPTED BY THIS WORLD. WE WE CAN HARDLY EXPAND THEM TO THINK AND I'D LIKE THIS CONGREGATION TO SAY THAT'S SO GLORIOUS, BROTHER ED. THAT'S SO MARVELOUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. &gt;&gt; How many believe he came out of the tomb? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CLOTHED? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID HE WILL GIVE US A GLORIOUS BODY, LIGHT UNTO HIS GLORIOUS BODY. THAT'S THE PROMISE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE. I'M NOT LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE HERE. I'M NOT LOOKING AT THIS FLESH AND CLAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE PROMISE FROM GOD'S WORD. We shall not ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT and in a twinkling of an eye. That is the promise. AND FURTHERMORE, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD SEND A MESSENGER TO ALERT US THAT THIS TIME WAS COMING UPON US. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, YOUNG PEOPLE. WE I MAY NOT LIVE TO SAY IT, BUT SURELY YOU WILL. I EVEN ANTICIPATE IT BECAUSE I HAVE EVERY reason to anticipate it. GOD SAID HE WOULD SEND A MESSENGER AND HE WOULD OPEN the seals and the lamb would open the seals. Isn't it amazing? WHEN THIS MESSENGER COMES, HE BEGINS TO speak about Boaz. &gt;&gt; Boaz, the kinsman redeemer. Now, here comes the last messenger, and he's talking about kinsman. Boaz, the kinsman redeemer, goes to the Old Testament, refers to him in I think 59 or 60 or perhaps a few more than 60 times refers to Boaz as the kinsman redeemer. What is the redeemer doing? He's redeeming. And then Boaz didn't only come and identify her. Boaz didn't only come and was introduced to Ruth. Boaz finally came and he went through the ceremony of purchasing her AND THEN HE CLAIMED HER. &gt;&gt; God sent you a messenger. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it right. GOD SENT YOU PERSONALLY a messenger to tell you about this thing. Maybe you haven't read it. Maybe you haven't studied it. But now you can at least believe me as one who's given his time to find out these things. And of the many times, 59 or 60 times he spoke of Boaz, only twice after the seals. &gt;&gt; All the time before the SEALS CUZ HE'S ANNOUNCING BOAZ IS GOING TO COME. &gt;&gt; Boaz is going to do the redeeming. Boaz is a kinsman redeemer. And then when he COMES TO THE BREACH JUST BEFORE THE SEALS, IT'S BOAZ and Ruth. And Boaz and RUTH AND BOAZ. WHY? BECAUSE THE TIME ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; He's telling YOU AS A CONGREGATION, HE'S TELLING HIS PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; And this ONE THAT HE HE HE HE DEMON THIS ONE THAT HE EXPRESSED AND DEMONSTRATED AND MANIFESTED who had THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE. IT WASN'T HE SAID THAT'S NOT A MAN. THAT'S HIM. &gt;&gt; And now HE HAD TO COME INTO HIS OFFICE OF BOAZ AND DO THE REDEEMING. AND HE SAYS TWICE IN THE TWICE in the breach, HE SAYS, "WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT WHAT IS IT DOING NOW?" HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK. THE BOOK'S IN the hands of the lamb. HE SAID, "WHAT'S IT DOING?" HE SAID, "WAITING FOR REDEMPTION'S CLAIMS." NOT WAITING FOR REDEMPTION. WAITING FOR THE CLAIM. &gt;&gt; THE CLAIM IS COMING WITH THE TICKET AND SAYING, "YOU'RE MINE. I HAVE THE PROOF. HERE'S THE SUPERNATURAL PROOF. I BOUGHT YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO ME. AND NOW HAS COME THE TIME OF REDEMPTION CLAIMS. AND ONCE THE SEALS THE NEXT YEARS AFTER THE SEALS FROM 63 TO ALMOST 66, &gt;&gt; he mentions Boaz once in ' 64, ONCE IN ' 65. WHY? BECAUSE THE WORK WAS DONE. &gt;&gt; THE WORK WAS FINISHED. I'M TELLING YOU FOLKS, IT WAS ALREADY FINISHED. AND IF THAT WAS BACK THERE IN ' 65, 64, you say, "OH, THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO." THAT ISN'T EVEN A BREATH TO GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN A BREATH TO GOD. HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT TIME. AND SO, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE season that we're in. AND THIS IS THE SEASON, THE SEASON, THE SEASON OF REDEMPTION. WE ARE IN THE FINAL ACT OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED ALREADY. CLAIM. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SAID THAT, I CAN TELL YOU I WAS WAITING. &gt;&gt; I was one that was WAITING FOR REDEMPTION CLAIM. I'M not waiting anymore. I'VE ALREADY BEEN CLAIMED. &gt;&gt; BUT I and a lot of other people AND ALL KINDS OF CHURCHES. YOU WENT THROUGH THIS CHURCH, THAT CHURCH, THIS THIS BELIEF, THAT BELIEF. AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING, THERE WAS SOMETHING YEARNING, YEARNING, YEARNING. And and because you YOU YOU WERE ONE THAT WAS TO BE CLAIMED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; No prophet &gt;&gt; or angels could open the book. In other words, no one else. And in the book, I want to put it this way. I want to get away from the book for a moment. Said your name was in the book. Your name, which I've said many times, is simply your character. &gt;&gt; That's what your name is CONNECTED TO, IS YOUR CHARACTER. That's why brother Brandham even said that some of them that God called, they had to change their name. I'm not telling people to change their name, but I'm saying God changed their name because Abram Abram couldn't bring FORTH THE KIND OF SEED THAT ABRAHAM COULD BRING forth &gt;&gt; because God ASSOCIATED HIS NAME WITH HE THE H HE PUT IN THERE and that associated it with God. &gt;&gt; And that should mean something also to us. When he talked about Billy Graham, he had his part to play. He was a messenger to the world. And Branham was a messenger to us &gt;&gt; and we SHOULD NEVER SHY AWAY FROM THAT. GOD ASSOCIATED THAT NAME WITH DIVINITY. HALLELUJAH. Because that which WAS IN HIM WAS A DIVINE ONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT THAT IS IN YOU AS A BORNAGAIN, HOLY GHOST FILILLED, holy ghostfilled son or daughter of God, YOU HAVE DIVINITY DWELLING IN YOU and never back away from that. PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A CULT. SAY I LOVE THAT CULT. AND YOU'VE GOT TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE A DIVINE one in me. IT'S CALLED GOD, THE CREATOR OF HEAVENS AND EARTH. He's in me. And he's GIVEN ME AS HIS CHILD. I AM HIS SON. I AM HIS DAUGHTER. AND YOU MUST NEVER MOVE FROM THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; If you move away from that, Satan loves it. &gt;&gt; When you move away from that, &gt;&gt; he says, "Man was a secondary God on the earth. He was given the power to control things, all elements of the earth. And that was Adam. Adam was given the great powers. But then notice now what he said. I read this once to you and I felt it kind of went over the heads of most people. Adam was given great powers, but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam could not reproduce himself in the original form. &gt;&gt; And I've been pointing out to you when the men ran to see the tomb and the tomb was empty. Now, we've gone all the way from the birth to the tomb and the tomb was empty. It was a different KIND OF A BODY that came in that came out of the tomb than went into the tomb. &gt;&gt; We already have a body like went into the tomb. He got hungry. WE GET HUNGRY. HE SWEAT WHEN HE WAS HOT. HE PROSPERSPIRED. HE WAS HE he he needed to sleep when he was tired. THAT'S THE BODY we have. BUT WHEN HE CAME OUT of that tomb with a GLORIOUS BODY, THAT'S THE ONE HE PROMISED US. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIS PROMISE. &gt;&gt; AND THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING WELL UP WITHIN YOU SAY, "Oh God, I WANT THAT BODY. I WANT THAT PROMISE. THAT IS MY PROMISE. I WILL NOT DENY IT. I WON'T LET THE ENEMY I WON'T LET THE ENEMY DILUTE THAT. I'M GOING TO BELIEVE THAT. Now just to kind of summarize and and and uh let this be distilled and this is the best and one of brother Brandham's last imagine God's prophet giving his last words to the age in message things that are to be. &gt;&gt; So he says so a prophet is a reflector of God. He is made so that he cannot speak. Now, you need to hold these words very close and listen very, very close. Don't be distracted at all because then I'm going to come to something scientific in a moment that's right in your time. In fact, it's research that hasn't been completely concluded and finished. They're just waiting to put it now into actual into practice. And it was for medical reasons is what they were discovering these things for. But he said a prophet is a reflector of God. He is made so that he cannot speak his own words. &gt;&gt; It has to be God's words that he speaks. &gt;&gt; He's just like a reflector &gt;&gt; and he is God's mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; I know that you've heard these words. You've you've agreed with them before, but now I want to go beyond agreement. &gt;&gt; So, I believe that with all my heart and soul, &gt;&gt; and that's the only way it'll work for you. &gt;&gt; That's the only way it'll work. &gt;&gt; It's not, well, I believe that, but you know, I have some questions. No, then you're defeated right before you start. &gt;&gt; He says he's just a reflector in his God's mouthpiece. So, and so therefore, he said, "A virgin shall conceive." He probably could not understand it, but God had spoke it through him &gt;&gt; because he promised that. That's why he spoke it through him, through Isaiah, because he had promised it. &gt;&gt; Promised it way back in Eden. He would do nothing until he revealed it to his servants, the prophets. Then when he said that, it was 800 years before that ever came to pass. But it had to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Finally, those words anchored in the womb of a virgin, and she conceived and brought forth Emmanuel unto us the child is born, a son is given. His name shall be called counselor, the mighty God, the prince of peace, the everlasting. He said that had to be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. That had to be that way because God had spoke it &gt;&gt; through the mouth of his prophets and all the words of God had to be fulfilled. Now that explains why I said at the beginning why I believe &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word I believe &gt;&gt; is because it is it has been proven. And if anyone wants to doubt it, they first have to explain the supernatural in brother Brandon's ministry before they can deal with any other subject. &gt;&gt; And you notice all these critics, they never deal with the supernatural because they cannot explain the supernatural. &gt;&gt; So they explain some other reasoning OR WHATEVER. LISTEN, THEY reasoned away the death of Jesus. They reasoned away his resurrection. What are we going to do with it? They reasoned it away &gt;&gt; and they believe it. &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THAT HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND STOLE HIM AWAY. THEY LOVED HIM TOO MUCH. THAT'S a very nice story. Which I was told by a very well-educated businessman in Morocco. And I just stopped him and I said, "Regardless of how holy a man I might be, I could not purchase you even a moment in eternal life." He said, "No, that's exactly right." I said, "And regardless, I don't know you, but regardless of," and he was vice president of the BA Oil Company. I said, "Regardless of how righteous a man you may be," and I believe of the Muslim faith, and he he probably prayed five times a day, which was more than I was doing. But I I said, "Well, regardless of how holy or you might be, you couldn't purchase me any time in etern as eternal life." And he got very sober. He said, "That's true." I said, "Listen, sir. Here's my children, my wife, and myself, and all of us in this room." I said, 'If that was not the son of God that hung on that cross and died as a sacrifice for our sins, we are all lost. &gt;&gt; Completely lost. &gt;&gt; And this is what he said to me. He said, "That's very interesting. We've never heard it that way before." &gt;&gt; That's the supernatural aspect. Yes, &gt;&gt; he died a death like a human dies. He had to die because it was death was the sentence &gt;&gt; in Eden. &gt;&gt; HE ALSO WAS FULFILLING THE SCRIPTURE, THE SAME SCRIPTURE WE FULFILLED. BUT WHEN HE WAS MOVING TO THE CROSS, HE SAID ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHETS. HE DIDN'T HAVE A HE didn't have a problem with what the prophet spoke. HE SAID, "ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED." AS FAR IN REALITY, HE WAS he was HE HAD A HUGE CONGREGATION, 5,000, and they left him. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he's left WITH THE HE'S LEFT WITH JUST HIS DISCIPLES. AND ONE OF THOSE IS A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THOSE IS GOING TO DENY HIM. ONE OF THOSE IS GOING TO SELL THEM OUT FOR 30 PIECES OF SILVER, NOT REALIZING. And the PROPHET EVEN SAID, JUDAS DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO GO THERE. HE DIDN'T EXPECT THE CROSS. HE DIDN'T EXPECT THE cru cruelty. And that's why he came back with the 30 pieces of silver in repentance AND THREW IT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND SAID, "TAKE IT BACK. I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS." NO. They said, "What you what what's done is done. &gt;&gt; You've made your denial." &gt;&gt; You talk about sobering time. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. God is just not some wimpy kind of being &gt;&gt; where you can just treat him any way you want and oh, he'll love me and take me back. You better take him while he's calling because he may never call again. &gt;&gt; And if he calls some of you young people, some of you young boys and girls, HE CALLS YOU, YOU GIVE YOURSELF TO HIM AND NEVER TURN AWAY FROM IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "God came down in a blood cell." Just quickly because I'm not I'm I'm not right quite at my point yet. He came down in a blood cell, not through a man, but by the Holy Ghost. And in that virgin womb, a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built. &gt;&gt; A tabernacle for the purpose of death was built. Now I want to loosen loosen up your mental your mind a moment. I'll have your attention. researchers are developing a system and brother Brandham says in countdown. He says in countdown he said the happenings on earth how the happenings on earth always in this earth are representing something that comes from somewhere else. Happenings on this earth are always representing something that comes from somewhere else. But when it strikes the earth, it's usually in a perverted condition because it is in the world of darkness and sin. But then there is a true representation in the spiritual realms of other dimensions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, we are a supernatural people. &gt;&gt; We are a people that must while we're on in this earth and while we're walking and claiming certain promises, our promises must not be limited &gt;&gt; to our jobs and our life in our marriages and our relationship and our families. That's just a small part of it. This is only representative. We are even our life our whole scope of our life here is only a reflection of something that is taking place &gt;&gt; and you have a BODY HERE BUT YOU HAVE A BODY THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You have a king. You have a savior. You have a redeemer but ONE DAY IT WILL BE IT'LL BE IT'S FACE TO FACE NOW BUT IT'LL BE MORE FACE TO FACE IN THAT YOU WILL PHYSICALLY YOU'LL BE IN A BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And I BELIEVE THAT BROTHER BRANDON'S MESSAGE CAME TO ALERT US TO THE TIME THAT WE'RE IN. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, HE OPENED THE SEALS." I'LL TELL YOU, CHRIST OPENED THE SEALS AND ALLOWED HIM TO SPEAK IT. AND WHEN HE SPOKE IT, YOU HEARD YOUR NAME BECAUSE YOU YOU SAW A REFLECTION OF A LIFE. THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU LONGED FOR, SOMETHING YOU DESIRED. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT DESIRE, YOU WEREN'T THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S HARD TO SAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Researchers are developing a system for persons that are handicapped. This is what they're working towards. Handicapped with paralysis whereby they will be able to communicate with a computer through mental thought or intent. Now, if you've got good memories class, you remember I spoke on in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and God said, and I stopped and asked you, what did God say? He didn't say in English, let there be light. Did he say it in Hebrew? I doubt it. Didn't say it in Greek. What What did he say? Did he just grunt? Did he make any sound at all? God said, "Let there be light." And the word and God said is he could have thought it, he could have uttered it, he could have just intended it. This was his intent. You know, my hearing is not that good these days, but it's good enough. And I can tell if my wife is happy or pleased or displeased. I don't even have to understand the words. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard something say, "Oh, why did you say, "Oh, because you understood what was intended. Whatever it was in the beginning, God said, "Let there be light." You can't tell me what he said. But I can tell you what he intended because whatever he said and and the prophet said, "If it if it just came a fog, then he didn't say light." That's right. &gt;&gt; If he said a light, then the proof of that is that light came. &gt;&gt; All right. And the researchers are working on something now. In fact, as it's been developed, it's already developed. They've they've uh they've put all of this to work and it and it functions quite well. I'll I'll continue to read. The human brain sends out signals which translate into commands that the body responds to. So the human brain sends out signals. Well, this is old stuff to a lot of you young people. The human brain is sending out signals. I wrote down the signal, mental signal of faith. [snorts] Hallelujah. I believe that sends a signal to my hands. Glory to God &gt;&gt; to my feet. I am free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord to my mouth and my lips. Hallelujah. Why? Because I believe it. &gt;&gt; So I might even preach on the signal of faith. And then the medical research has succeeded has succeeded in causing patients to activate certain physical movements by act sending signals to the brain. Today man can create a computer voice which is signals sent through a mechanism that speaks a sound we understand. It's just a signal in a com in in a computer world. This is out of their magazine apparently. Researchers at Northwestern University that is in Utah have developed a device that they say can deliver me messengers messages from the brain directly to the muscles. Listen close. Skipping over the spinal cord. So they're passing over the nervous system and sending the signal directly to the muscle and the muscle will do it. We're just starting and don't forget countdown skipping over the spinal cord. He said we are eavesdropping on the natural electrical signals from the brain that tell the arm and hand how to move and sending those signals directly to the muscles. They're actually easedropping on the brain sending the signals. Don't move around, please. Researchers have been able to translate brain signals into speech using sensors attached to the surface of the brain for the first time. The breakthrough which is up to 90% accurate offers a way to communicate for paralyzed patients which cannot speak and could eventually lead to being able to lead to read anyone's anyone thoughts. We are based, we are beside ourselves with excitement when it started working, said Professor Bradley Greger, a bioengineer who led the team of researchers. We have been able to decode spoken words using only signals from the brain with a device that has promised for has promised for long-term use in paralyzed patients who can who cannot now speak. They can't speak. So this is the key. How is it going to happen? I would call it, he said, brain reading. And we hope that in two or three years, and this is two years ago, so it's coming right up, that it will be available for use for paralyzed patients. The computer picked up the patient's brain waves as he talked and did not use any voice recognition software. Because just thinking a word and not saying it is thought to produce the same brain signals. Professor Greger and his team believe that soon they will be able to have translation device and voice box that repeats the word you are thinking. What is more, think of countdown now. The brain of people who are paralyzed are often healthy and produce the same signals as though they were able-bodied people. It is just they are blocked by the injury from reaching the muscle. This is proof of concept. We have proven these signals can tell you what the person is saying well above chance. But we need to be able to do more words and more accuracy before it is something a patient really might find useful. People who eventually could benefit from a wireless device that converts thoughts into computer spoken words include those paralyzed by stroke, disease, and injury. Professor Greger said, and I want to just conclude now quickly. He said, "People who are now locked in." I want you to think of this spiritually because I'm going to come from left field and surprise I think many of you. People who are now locked in often communicate with any movement they can make. Blinking an eye or moving a hand slightly. Thought of your father, sister Paulo Sally. to arduously pick up letters or words from a list. The new device would allow them freedom to speak on their own. They simply think it because in thinking it, it sends a brain signal. You might think just now, I'm not getting anything out of this. Uh God heard it. &gt;&gt; And if you think it enough, you'll find it will bring action to the body and you won't want to come to church. &gt;&gt; You say you're my friend. Okay. Come here, Timothy. You're a young man here in the church. We've known each other a long time and you're my friend. So, I'll shake hands with you. &gt;&gt; Cuz my brain is saying I I'm not a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Neither are you. &gt;&gt; Good. So, we can do that in reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. Am I squeezing your hand? It's because my signal is saying squeeze his hand. make him know that. Now, that's fine. Now, if I ever start thinking, I don't know if I really care for him anymore. That sends a signal and I may not shake his hand next time. And fact is, if I allowed that to continue and say, "You know what? He didn't shake my hand. He didn't even look at me. I think what I'll do, I'll just go the other side. I'll take another hallway here so I don't meet him because my brain signals are telling my body what to do. &gt;&gt; Person might be sitting here and you might not even be born again. And you might say, "Wow." I mean that God even knows. No wonder the scripture says now in fact is here's what I wanted to come to at the beginning but I need to lay all this out. The Bible exploded to me. Verses started coming from all over the place and things in the message and you don't know what I went through. in fact is I'll tell brother Aaron while he's here that's where I was and I my computer started acting up and I was saying devil get out of this thing even to this morning that's the first time in my life the computer my printer failed to print this message wouldn't want to print it I can tell you why he wouldn't want to print it &gt;&gt; he doesn't want you to hear this &gt;&gt; and furthermore it says here in this study that they have been able to translate the brain signals further. Just listen now for just a moment. And that uh an individual although he might be completely paralyzed and mute mute mute cannot say a word. He can just have in his mind an incant. And the signal that comes from a human brain that's going to lie motionless without thought in a grave someday that that brain will send a signal an intent and his intent will speak out of the computer and say the word. Okay. Now we have a messenger and that's why I started out this morning saying this is why I believe what I believe. Now we have a messenger and he stands before someone. He says, "Are we strangers? Raise your hand." They raise your hand. I don't know you. You don't know me. And then he starts to say now just to help you believe. &gt;&gt; They aren't at the place of believing yet for healing. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; to help you believe. &gt;&gt; And he says to one woman, I have it here. So remarkable. He said, "Uh, now I see fields stretching out in front of me." It was in Chicago. He's in surrounded by concrete. He says, "I see fields stretching out in front of me. He said that it looks like it's fields of wheat. He said you are not from this place. You have come from Canada and you're not standing here for yourself. You're standing here for another woman. And that woman is dying with cancer. And she tried to get to me in a meeting. And I was not able to be there because I was held up by a snowstorm. Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; Where where where is this man that's human that's standing in front of us? Where is he? &gt;&gt; Who knows those kind of things? &gt;&gt; Who did it once, twice, a hundred times, a thousand times, thousands of times? Why? And what he's doing is telling her exactly what's in her heart. &gt;&gt; And the same prophet said, "When the seals were opened, you opened the seal to find out." And and then he said, "Your name was in there, but but you were not able to live your exact nature. You were not in your ought to be condition." As brother Tom preaches, you were not able to be in your ought to be condition. But when the seals were opened and opening the seals, it was the bridegroom himself says, "This is what I see about you. This is the way you were intended to be." And furthermore, believe me, because I have never told a lie in my life. This is the way you will be. &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR OUGHT TO BE CONDITION. THIS IS YOUR TRUE NATURE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S BRIDE. YOU'RE MY BRIDE. AND I'M TELLING YOU, AND HERE'S THE VESSEL THAT I USE TO TELL YOU THAT. AND HE'S NEVER FAILED. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF. YOU CAN HEAR IT YOURSELF. IT IS TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE. THEN THIS PROMISE IS TRUE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And if science at this time has come to the place where a man who's completely mute and cannot speak can simply intend intend something. He wants something. He needs something or he intends something and a mechanism will speak his intention of what it is he needs. And they're looking upon it as a great discovery which it would be for paralyzed people or people with lugaric disease or whatever more. But now here HERE ARE YOUR SAME MESSENGERS SAYING THEY WILL DISCOVERED HE SAID THEY ARE THEY ARE uh scientists they are achievements making achievements in this world. But he and he said another place in the countdown HE SAID THIS IS A WARNING. ARE YOU TAKING THE WARNING? THERE'S A WARNING THAT SOMETHING SPIRITUAL IS TO FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, what your mind, what your thoughts and the signals that's coming from your brain at this moment, we have one THAT'S A CONTROL CENTER. WE HAVE THE ALMIGHTY God &gt;&gt; that HAD AS A HAS A CERTAIN INTENTION FOR THIS PEOPLE &gt;&gt; AND FOR YOU SITTING HERE. I'VE BEEN SENT THIS MORNING TO TELL YOU GOD HAS AN INTENT FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL LIFE AND ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS AGREE WITH IT. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SAY YAY AND AMEN. I BELIEVE IT. AND THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if YOU TAKE IT CASUALLY, IT WON'T HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE SAYS TO BELIEVE WITH ALL YOUR HEART, &gt;&gt; IF YOU BELIEVE IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOU, &gt;&gt; but if you have fear AND YOU HOLD BACK, IT WON'T HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY OF US ARE ROBBED SO MUCH OF THE TIME, IT WON'T HAPPEN. AND WHEN THE ENEMY COMES AROUND AND HE'S TRYING TO HOLD YOU UP, HE'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU FROM BELIEVING WITH ALL YOUR HEART. SO HE HE HE has no problem. WHEN JESUS SAID, "WHO DO MEN SAY I AM? Who do we say this is?" And that's why brother Brandham GOT UP AND PREACHED. WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS? YEAH. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, by my life, the disciples said, "Oh, some of you believe some some of us some of the people believe you're Isaiah or Elijah even." He didn't say, "Oh, that's wonderful. They've come a long way." No, he said, "But who do you say I am?" Right. &gt;&gt; Said to the woman at the well, she said, "Oh, if I were a prophet," he could have responded that that was a rare compliment. That's very nice that you say that. No, but she says, "BUT I KNOW WHEN I know when the Christ comes, &gt;&gt; HE WILL TELL US WHEN THE MESSIAH COMES, he'll tell us all things." And he DIDN'T HAVE TO PREACH HER SERMON LIKE YOU'VE HEARD SO MANY TIMES. IT SAID, "I THAT SPEAK UNTO THEE AM HE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SHE BELIEVED IT. &gt;&gt; AND THE BRAIN SIGNALS CONNECTED. AND SHE DROPPED THE WATER BUCKET. AND THE BRAIN SIGNALS TOLD HER HER FEET TO RUN. AND THE MUSCLES WERE ACTIVATED. AND SHE RAN INTO THE CITY. AND THE BRAIN SIGNAL SAID, "SPEAK." AND SHE OPENED HER MOUTH AND SPOKE. SAYS, "COME SEE A MAN &gt;&gt; THAT TOLD ME ALL THAT EVER I DID. &gt;&gt; IS NOT THIS THE CHRIST?" &gt;&gt; I'm saying TO YOU AS BELIEVERS, WHAT HAVE YOU RECEIVED? WHAT IS IT YOU'VE RECEIVED IN THIS HOUR? &gt;&gt; I wish I had THE YOUTH THAT SOME OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE. I TELL YOU, I'D BE MAKING PLANS for the KINGDOM OF GOD, NOT FOR THIS WORLD THAT'S PASSING AWAY INTO CORRUPTION. I'D BE MAKING PLANS FOR the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you might remember this. Brother Brandham said, "That's my voice, &gt;&gt; but that's not me speaking." &gt;&gt; It wasn't his brain signals &gt;&gt; producing the words. &gt;&gt; In fact, I've got several quotes here, says this microphone &gt;&gt; is mute. &gt;&gt; There's no words in this microphone. This microphone CAN ONLY PICK UP SOMETHING I SAY THAT ORIGINATES IN MY BRAIN AND SENDS OUT A SIGNAL TO MY LIPS SPEAK AND THE MICROPHONE PICKS IT UP AND YOU HEAR IT. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE FULL INTENT BEHIND IT. And brother Brandon would say to people, "If I could, I'd heal you." &gt;&gt; That was the signal from his brain. But then would come another brain, ANOTHER THOUGHT, ANOTHER SIGNAL. I CALL IT A FAITH SIGNAL. &gt;&gt; Comes to a mute instrument. HE SAYS THE MICROPHONE IS MUTE AND I am a mute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE OF HIS OWN. HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAPABILITY OF HIS OWN. SO HE GOES INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND HE SEES OTHER THINGS HAPPENING AND AND AND HE'S A MUTE. AND WHEN HE COMES OUT OF IT, HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS SAID. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S A MUTE. THIS MICROPHONE DOESN'T KNOW what I say. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO BE MUTE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO BE A WITNESS &gt;&gt; AND HAVE THE WORD OF PROMISE SPEAK THROUGH US. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL? NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL. BUT THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME TO SAY. &gt;&gt; HE TOLD ME TO CONFESS THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IN MY HEART, &gt;&gt; MY BRAIN IS SAYING, &gt;&gt; SPEAK THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; Not be silent. &gt;&gt; SPEAK IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY IT. &gt;&gt; CONFESS THE IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; CONFESS WHAT YOU DON'T EVEN EXPECT. CONFESS THE PROMISE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; He said, "I want everyone in here to be aware that the things that I speak is not myself. &gt;&gt; That's not my voice." He said, "It's my voice, but not I'm not using it." &gt;&gt; DON'T GO. DON'T LET YOUR BRAIN WAVES THINK, "OH, THAT'S FINE FOR HIM. THAT'S WAY BACK THERE." THAT SAME ONE WHO SPOKE THOSE WORDS SPEAKS TO US AND SAYS TO YOU AND I, "CONFESS IT." &gt;&gt; HOW LONG DO I CONFESS IT? UNTIL YOU BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; CONFESS IT UNTIL IT'S THE MOST SURE THING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; You young ladies, YOU NEED TO CONFESS WHY GOD SENT YOU HERE. HE DIDN'T SEND YOU HERE JUST to have long hair or wear a modest dress. That isn't it. HE DOESN'T DIDN'T SEND US YOUNG men and I say us young men. I'm only 18 coming on 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He hasn't called us just to make a certain profession &gt;&gt; and we go to a certain place etc. Do you know why you're here in Cloverdale by the way? BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS WORD. We believe it with all our heart and soul. We do not believe it as just a place to gather. THIS IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO HAVE A SOCIAL EVENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. In fact, as I can tell you, I woke up early in the morning. I see brother Terry and sister Shelley here. We didn't build the brothers didn't labor on this school just to give you a better building, &gt;&gt; to give you a nicer place. It is that YOU MIGHT COME UNDER A CERTAIN ATMOSPHERE. WE WANT YOU TO RECEIVE SUPERNATURAL A SUPERNATURAL INSTRUCTION FROM HERE. WE WANT IT TO PASS ON TO THE TEACHERS. WE WANT THE TEACHERS TO GO INTO THOSE ROOMS WITH THAT KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE. Already had this included. WE AND I HAVE SUCH confidence in the brothers and sisters that are part of the school system. But we don't go over there TO JUST BE PART OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. The supernatural and the spiritual guidance comes HERE OVER THE PULPIT BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that? THAT'S WHAT MY BRAIN SIGNALS ARE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF. So we can see our young people and children grow up in the admonition and the and the purpose of God in in instilled in their lives. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'M GOING TO CONFESS THAT BECAUSE I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We labored there for that purpose. And you parents that are sending children there, let me tell you something, friends, that's the MOST GLORIOUS THING. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT SAME PLACE. NOT EVEN BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE. THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT QUALITY AND THAT STANDARD of school and that standard of education. And you never want to you never want to forget that people ought to LOVE PRODUCED THIS. PEOPLE OUT OF LOVE PAID and gave years and time of their energy and strength. And brother Kim Ding Walter, no one else told me TO SAY THIS. GOD TOLD ME TO say it. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE JUST TO PUSH YOU THROUGH AN education up to from kindergarten to K from K to to grade 12. That's not the purpose of it. The purpose is TO GIVE YOU AN ATMOSPHERE. You don't have to hear cursing and damnation. You don't HAVE TO HEAR VILE STORIES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE DEMONPOSSESSED TEACHERS. &gt;&gt; Hey friends, I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I had grandkids in school where the teacher was so had such a a a naked legs and and sit up on the table and show her undergarments and have a fully fully mature young man standing there looking at her. I said, "She's demonpossessed." Soon as I heard it, I SAID, "SHE'S DEMONPOSSESSED. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE JUST BULL for the gospel. WE'RE HERE TO BE BOLD AGAINST THE AGAINST unbelief as well." &gt;&gt; And now, let me tell you, let me tell you the rest that's on my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith is brother Brown talks about mental faith and the state of the mind. And the Bible tells us, "Let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; which WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT BROTHER ED SAYING THAT. THAT'S A COMMANDMENT OF THE APOSTLE PAUL. LET THIS MIND BE in you. &gt;&gt; Though he was equal with God, &gt;&gt; he made himself of no reputation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, and what and A FEW OTHER THINGS, THINK ON THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; Your mind, let your mind go into action. I want your lips to speak. Think on these things. &gt;&gt; Will you say that with me? &gt;&gt; Think on these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's three classes of people. I've got I got pages. I'm not I'm going to close very quickly, but there's three classes of people. What are they? &gt;&gt; Let me hear it. &gt;&gt; All it is is three classes of people that think differently. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's all it is. &gt;&gt; Some are going to say, "I don't believe that. One man says to brother Bradom, he says, "I don't care how many people you raised from the dead, whatever more, I still wouldn't believe it." He said, 'Of course not because you are an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be persuaded one way or another. &gt;&gt; But there's such a thing as you could sit here this morning and and and I'll tell you what happened to me in the last few days. My whole mind I just began to think of all these things. Brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham is standing there and he's starting to speak and he says, "Don't think that &gt;&gt; even says to some, I could I could identify you." &gt;&gt; What was HE PICKING UP? &gt;&gt; GOD IN THE MAN &gt;&gt; picking up THE BRAIN SIGNALS. IF GOD WOULD ALLOW A MAN TO PICK THAT UP, THEN I AM HERE TO TELL YOU, ALMIGHTY GOD HAS PICKED UP OUR THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE LIKE AN OPEN BOOK BEFORE HIM. AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS PRECISELY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU THINK THE RIGHT THING AND BELIEVE THE RIGHT THING AND CONFESS THE RIGHT THING, YOU SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT THING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We shall identify the the season of redemption that we're in. &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN A SEASON WHERE WE'RE NOT CHURCHGOERS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT people that go to Cloverdale Bible way. We're not just people who say we believe the message or we're in the message. We're a group of people that have taken that upon ourselves. When you READ THAT WORD, THAT IS ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WANT YOU YOUNG PEOPLE TO START CONFESSING STUFF YOU'VE NEVER CONFESSED BEFORE. As you read the message and you're in the message and something strikes YOUR HEART, YOU SAY IT &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY, "GOD, YOUR MOUTHPIECE SAID THAT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOUR MOUTHPIECE SPOKE IT &gt;&gt; AND IT MUST be &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we talk about that's why we talk about especially you may think I talk too much about the change of the body. You can have this world. I'll take the next one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Or you you don't want to stay here, do you? This isn't getting any better. It's getting worse. And then my Bible says it'll wax worse and worse. And I believe it and I'm confessing it. &gt;&gt; But I THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's not your home. &gt;&gt; You brothers and sisters that have struggled AND HAVE STRUGGLES, PUT IT BEHIND YOU. THIS WORLD IS NOT YOUR HOME. &gt;&gt; AND LET THE BRAIN WAVE SIGNAL START DECLARING HEAVEN IS MY HOME. &gt;&gt; OH FATHER IN HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; HALLOWED BE THY NAME, &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come, thy will BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. Forgive us all of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver US FROM EVIL. FOR THINE is the kingdom. Thine is the glory. Thine is THE POWER FOREVER AND ever and ever. Amen. And the people said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. when you have someone who said, "I'm a mute, but he stands there and tells people what they think." I believe on that ministry. &gt;&gt; And if he says this is the way conditions are going to be, that's the way they will be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thine is the kingdom &gt;&gt; the power and the glory &gt;&gt; forever and ever. Hallelujah. God bless brother Wulman. &gt;&gt; He got the crossover yesterday, but we're still here fighting the battle. &gt;&gt; And we'll say to brother Wman and all others. We'll say to brother Lonnie, I'm happy Brother Tim Dodd here on the platform. has been a week up in up in Grand Prairie with the people, but someone who's staying close in contact and has had much to do with India. I want to say to the people in India and to the bride of Jesus Christ, we're not letting go. &gt;&gt; We're not slowing down. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'LL PRESS THE BATTLES OF THE VERY GATES OF HELL. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. ARE YOU WITH ME? HALLELUJAH. WHO'S ON THE LORD'S SIDE? AMEN. HALLELUJAH. LET'S STAND TO our feet. We're on the Lord's side. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. [applause] Thank you for your time and thank you for your attention. And I pray that it will have the same effect on you that it's had on me. Oh my, the Bible has just exploded to me. The message when you read it, think of this message. When you read a line and you read a paragraph, I want you to ask yourself, what is my brain cell signal? What what signal is it sending? Now, &gt;&gt; I know you read something and say, oh, that was kind of hard. Or, oh, that kind of convicts me. You say thy will be done oh Lord. Hallelujah. My brain is sending out signals. My and let the mental faith, intellectual faith come down to be a spiritual faith. Hallelujah. And your body will will respond to it. &gt;&gt; Father, we just feel as though we've emptied out all that we should at this time. I pray, oh God, that people will ponder this so deeply that it'll be a life-changing experience for many. Oh God, let them not think this is just another message or another sermon. And I pray you'll just prepare the people, Lord, for what you will speak tonight and what you have laid on brother Tom's heart. Oh God, as brother John and brother Kyle will be ministering there in Lima, I pray, Father, you will come upon the people and endure them with power &gt;&gt; from on high that is not from this world. Lord, I pray that you will anoint, oh God, our principal, brother Tat and his wife, oh God, Sister Shel, as she labors with him and everyone who stands at their post of duty within the classrooms. May they know they stand amongst those that are redeemed &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ. And Lord, why they have while as teachers they have certain intentions and objectives for their children and young people, I pray they will never never be unconscious to the fact that you have an intention. Hallelujah. You intend to put these young people around the marriage supper of the lamb. You intend to take them and gather your family to them, Lord. And I pray all that are here, all that are to here now. And some may be in need of prayer and they're saying in their heart, "Oh, brother Biscll, remember to pray for me." I want to ask while our heads are bowed, while our eyes are closed. Is there some here that want to h have be remembered in prayer at this time? While we're praying and while this anointing is upon the people, you want to be remembered in prayer. You don't know him the way you'd like to know him the way that you should know him. Tell change your thoughts and change your direction. Father, as hands have been lifted and how your messenger has said there's something in the heart, oh God. And we think of the we think of the words, oh God, that tells us of the scripture that as a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Oh God, the thoughts that come and arise from the heart, the hunger and the thirst, AND YOU SAID, "COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT HUNGER AND THIRST, and I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, for everyone that has got their hands raised up, and their mind is registering certain things. Their mind already told the muscles in their arms to lift them up against gravity and raise them up to heaven from whence we have come and from to whence we will go. I pray oh God that you will take every individual every individual request and you will decipher it. You'll send an assurance to their heart that you have heard and you shall surely answer. and let them also have a hope and an anticipation that this shall surely come to pass. Oh God, let every desire raise before you. Let the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So let it be &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. It has been spoken &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. So let it be fulfilled. We thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Honor brother Ryan, are you here? You can help me. This world is not my home.

I took it all to my, you know, this is really something. They've tapped into God's laboratory &gt;&gt; and they're able to communicate through a computer [music] the thought of a man. But it takes the mind of God to put that service together. &gt;&gt; Takes the mind of God to be able to speak that kind of word that would open it up in such a way that it's not man's thinking. I was thinking natural. I did not tap into that spiritual to be able to connect it with the word that we hear every day.
