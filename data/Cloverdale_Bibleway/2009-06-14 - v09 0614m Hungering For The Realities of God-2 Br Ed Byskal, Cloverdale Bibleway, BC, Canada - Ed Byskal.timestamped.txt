[15:57] grace. Amen. I'm uh I know brother John
[16:02] Andy's is here. I know if I saw him or
[16:05] not, brother John, if you'd come and
[16:06] take the request this morning. Um
[16:10] there's a request from Sister Janice
[16:12] Clark from North Carolina called to
[16:14] request prayer for her husband, Brother
[16:16] Eugene, who was diagnosed with
[16:17] Parkinson's disease three years ago.
[16:20] He's very weak and uh is requesting
[16:22] prayer for strength and healing. We got
[16:25] testimony from our sister Grace Bey
[16:27] wants to thank the Lord for healing.
[16:29] Amen. We're thankful for that. How many
[16:31] can testify to the healing grace of our
[16:33] Lord? Amen. So, we want to remember this
[16:35] request. If you got a need this morning
[16:37] and you're here looking to the Lord, you
[16:39] just take it before the Lord. If you're
[16:41] listening in on the internet this
[16:42] morning, the Lord's able to touch you as
[16:45] well. Brother John.
[16:48] Jesus.
[16:50] Hallelujah. Jesus God.
[16:56] Hallelujah.
[16:58] El Shi,
[17:01] we come to you, God.
[17:04] We come to you.
[17:08] We lift up our hands, God, as mortals,
[17:13] but knowing in our souls there's a
[17:15] sanctuary.
[17:17] Yes.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; You laid these songs on Brother Rod's
[17:20] heart, Lord. But when we sing them,
[17:23] Lord, it is so true.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; You're our only place of refuge.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; In the natural, we're standing here, but
[17:34] in the spiritual, we are running.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; We are on our faces, Lord.
[17:41] Our feet are around our hands are around
[17:44] your feet, Lord.
[17:46] There's nothing in our heart of guile.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in our hands we bring.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; There's no pride. There's nothing
[17:57] against any person.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; And if there is, would you take it away,
[18:03] God? If there's unbelief, if there's
[18:06] sin, if there's things that would keep
[18:09] us from your
[18:11] presence from you, would you even now
[18:14] with just a brush of your hand, deliver
[18:18] us, God, set us free.
[18:22] Lord, your prophet said in every
[18:23] gathering, there's three type of
[18:25] believers.
[18:27] But Lord, we are believers. God, we're
[18:29] confessing. Our heart is reaching up
[18:32] through the blood. that our voices, our
[18:34] thoughts are coming up through the
[18:36] blood.
[18:39] Oh Jesus, would you come this morning?
[18:43] We're reminded in the scripture, Lord,
[18:45] when things were going
[18:48] sideways as it was and you were being
[18:50] challenged
[18:52] and you consumed those the hearts were
[18:55] not right, but then you anointed your
[18:58] ministry to run through the
[19:00] congregation.
[19:02] Lord, would you run through this
[19:04] congregation today?
[19:06] Lives that might be broken or being
[19:10] swallowed up or sickness or sin or
[19:13] Satan's grip. Would you anoint your word
[19:16] to run through the congregation? Let
[19:19] there be healing. Let there be
[19:20] deliverance. Let there be chains broken.
[19:24] Let there be hearts set free.
[19:29] souls that are
[19:31] &gt;&gt; away from you. Let there be an
[19:34] awareness. Let there be a dermatitizing,
[19:37] a new birth. God, you're gathering your
[19:40] seed to yourself. So would you go
[19:43] through this meeting today, through this
[19:46] assembly, Lord, through this gathering
[19:48] of eagles, Lord, as we cry out your
[19:52] name, Adonai, God of grace, our Lord
[19:56] Jesus Christ, the only real God, the
[20:00] only one that satisfies our hungry,
[20:03] thirsty soul. And we do hunger for more
[20:06] realities. God,
[20:10] there's times we need to close the
[20:12] Bible, close a message book, and say,
[20:15] "Jesus, we want to see you in our day,
[20:19] in this atmosphere, in these hearts, in
[20:22] these lives. Not a God of history on
[20:25] paper or on tablets of stone or history,
[20:28] but a God of June 2009 that you would
[20:32] come through this congregation, God, and
[20:35] make yourself so real that lives could
[20:38] be healed, lives could be delivered,
[20:41] lives could be mended, that you would do
[20:43] the supernatural in this service. Lord,
[20:46] I lift my hand and witness that you are
[20:48] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[20:51] and the generation that you thought in
[20:53] your mind and in your heart to manifest
[20:56] the change of the bodies that we are
[20:59] here God that we are responding to your
[21:02] spirit God and would you go out today
[21:04] and do what's in your heart to do may we
[21:08] respond appropriately God may every
[21:11] unbelief and every fear every question
[21:14] and every influence from that demonic
[21:17] realm that its powers would be crushed
[21:21] that he would be demoralized, that he
[21:23] would be defeated, that the sword of the
[21:26] word would go to the heart of the matter
[21:29] and that your people would be set free
[21:32] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord that
[21:34] as you speak our name and our address
[21:36] and your word that is precious and we
[21:39] will be impressed Lord with your word
[21:41] that you God would be so manifested in
[21:45] our souls in our spirits and our bodies
[21:48] that your glory would fill this earth
[21:50] today. May this be an unusual meeting
[21:53] this morning God as we are reverencing
[21:55] Lord what you've done through the ages
[21:58] and believing it's coming to a harvest.
[22:02] May we wave under that presence, God.
[22:05] And may we, Lord, be benefic
[22:07] beneficiaries
[22:09] of that resurrection word, Lord, as
[22:11] you're coming to take mature people in a
[22:13] rapture. Let us be a mature people,
[22:16] Lord. Just have your way in these spoken
[22:19] requests. Our brother Rod read an
[22:21] unspoken request, Lord. Those that are
[22:23] needy, those that aren't with us, those
[22:25] that are here but are cradling in their
[22:28] heart desires. May you come and meet
[22:30] with us today Lord
[22:33] in Jesus name.

[30:14] Now, there's a note about a
[30:15] presentation. Who's doing the
[30:16] presentation? I think they want Brother
[30:18] Ken Buckles up here. You're doing the
[30:20] presentation. Brother Ken, you here?
[30:44] Brother Ken, on behalf of Bible
[30:47] Christian Academy, I'd like to present
[30:49] to Cloverdale Bible a check for $773.
[30:54] This is to go towards the purchase of a
[30:55] message hub for the church in Hanoria,
[30:57] Mexico.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm very privileged this morning to
[31:13] to receive this uh presentation
[31:17] uh behalf of uh Bible believers message
[31:20] hub. And just a little background,
[31:24] uh the school uh chose this as their
[31:28] project for this year back in September.
[31:32] They um wanted to uh sponsor a uh a
[31:36] print station and they chose to sponsor
[31:38] this print station in to go to uh
[31:41] Mterrey Cal or Mterrey, Mexico.
[31:45] And uh they work very hard throughout
[31:47] the uh the whole year to to uh
[31:51] accumulate the uh the funding and uh I
[31:54] they even
[31:56] in their physical ed uh portion of the
[31:59] schooling uh you may have seen that um a
[32:02] map on the wall that we're walking to
[32:04] Mterrey. Well, this is part of I think
[32:06] putting you know footprints our
[32:09] possession, you know. So, and I think
[32:12] this was a constant reminder and and you
[32:14] may have monitored their progress and
[32:16] and via the route that they chose, it
[32:18] was something like 4,700 km. And they
[32:21] achieved that goal physically by walking
[32:24] to Mterrey, but they also by selling uh
[32:28] popcorn, having special clothing days,
[32:31] uh you know, pay a dollar to wear a hat
[32:32] to school. I mean, we weren't allowed to
[32:35] wear hats to school, but uh you know uh
[32:37] or or jeans, which again, I mean, we
[32:40] never wore jeans to school, but you
[32:41] know, pay a dollar, wear jeans to
[32:43] school. And and this is how they raised
[32:44] the money. And then in addition to that,
[32:46] they just they just made offerings and
[32:49] the fulfillment of it is they have
[32:52] sponsored a print station in Mterrey,
[32:56] Mexico. And I think that's just a, you
[32:59] know, they they a lot of dedication, a
[33:01] lot of hard work, perseverance, and I
[33:03] think they deserve a great round of
[33:06] applause for what they're doing
[33:14] [Applause]
[33:17] now.
[33:20] Now, what they haven't seen and what you
[33:22] haven't seen as well is the the
[33:25] fulfillment of this uh project being a
[33:28] reality in Monterey. Brother Jake Dick
[33:31] was uh privileged to take that uh print
[33:35] station down to Monterey and set it up.
[33:38] And he has just a couple of slides that
[33:39] have never been seen seen here before.
[33:42] And he'll just show those now. and uh
[33:44] perhaps make a comment or two about what
[33:48] your efforts have done in Mterrey.
[33:51] Brother Jake, please.
[33:58] God bless you all. I think uh if we can
[34:01] turn the slides on. Mterrey, I think I
[34:04] gave a report here a couple months ago,
[34:07] but uh here's the print station set up
[34:09] in Mterrey. Let me just see if I can
[34:12] figure this thing out.
[34:15] There's uh what they did. First of all,
[34:17] they dedicated the Prince Station to the
[34:19] Lord. There's uh by the way, the brother
[34:24] down here on the left or on the right,
[34:27] he's the pastor. That's brother Estraa.
[34:33] There's another picture. And you can see
[34:35] in the background the box with the
[34:38] printer
[34:41] unpacking the printer.
[34:43] There's uh
[34:47] from left to right, brother uh the
[34:50] son-in-law to brother Estraa. Next is
[34:52] brother. He's the pastor down there.
[34:54] Another brother from uh way down south,
[34:57] San Louise Pisi. He's very interested in
[35:00] the Prince Station. Myself and another
[35:02] brother. It's a doctor
[35:06] unpacking the print station.
[35:11] Uh there it is in the printing the first
[35:14] books.
[35:17] First one in hand.
[35:20] They're very excited about this.
[35:24] And then uh brother Estraa he he printed
[35:27] out about 20 copies of the uh certain
[35:31] message that he hadn't had before and
[35:34] passed it out to all the different
[35:36] families in the church. That was the
[35:37] first thing he wanted to do.
[35:41] There it is.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[35:46] It's been a real blessing,
[35:50] tremendous blessing to the people. And I
[35:53] just one quick report the last uh two
[35:56] weeks ago I believe it was they took
[35:58] printed about uh 30 messages out put
[36:02] about six packages together of books and
[36:05] took a 5,000mi trip to the east coast
[36:08] and passed them out to the different
[36:09] brothers. So you know that's just a
[36:13] little part of what's happening. God
[36:14] bless you.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you wonder what individual
[36:19] effort collectively can do. Uh in you
[36:23] know additionally has it made a
[36:26] difference? Absolutely. From before this
[36:28] print station the print station that
[36:31] our younger brothers and sisters paid
[36:35] for from before that print station was
[36:38] in Mterrey. the number of of um website
[36:43] hits and activities
[36:46] increased three over 300%.
[36:49] From before to now. So has it made a
[36:51] difference? Absolutely. And it's your
[36:55] efforts that may have put the message of
[36:59] the hour into the hands of someone
[37:02] that's going to be saved and it's going
[37:05] to be a crown or or a jewel in in your
[37:08] crowns. So all I can say is Lord bless
[37:12] these young brothers and sisters and and
[37:15] they should be an inspiration to all of
[37:17] us.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; As they go down, we'll turn to the word.
[37:30] Brother Biscll, come. Why don't you lead
[37:32] me to the rock? Number 3:15. We can sing
[37:34] it together.
[37:38] Why don't you lead me to that rock that
[37:43] is higher than I
[37:46] me?
[37:48] [Applause]
[37:51] Why don't you lead me to that rock that
[37:55] is higher?
[37:57] Oh, thou shelter for me. And don't you
[38:04] lead me
[38:06] [Music]
[38:07] higher. Lord, lead me, Lord. Lead me.
[38:15] Why don't you lead me to that rock that
[38:18] is higher than high?
[38:22] Now I feel shelter for me. I don't you
[38:28] me
[38:30] that is higher
[38:33] lead me
[38:38] why don't you lead me to that rock that
[38:42] is higher than I
[38:47] shelter for me
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] I
[38:55] I was getting so inspired there in the
[38:57] study
[38:58] seeing what the young people the school
[39:02] has done and just imagine
[39:06] what it was in eternity.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's some rejoicing taking
[39:11] place. I really believe that. Uh and I
[39:15] have a a few quick slides also. I wish
[39:19] we had all day. Maybe we do.
[39:23] haven't got anything better to do
[39:25] &gt;&gt; and happy to see everyone here and God
[39:28] bless you. Uh tonight, Brother Murphy's
[39:31] going to be speaking and uh you want to
[39:34] be sure and get here early. Have a time
[39:36] of prayer and get refreshed this
[39:38] afternoon. Uh he's uh just returned back
[39:42] and was, I'm sure, quite weary and
[39:44] tired. Uh just a steady series of
[39:46] meetings and uh we're happy. I I heard
[39:50] some reports back and so that's I
[39:53] thought it's nice to have it while
[39:54] everything's fresh and then you heard
[39:56] the announcement I'm sure already next
[39:59] Sunday communion and footwashing next
[40:01] Sunday evening and uh now we just have a
[40:04] few slides of the Moscow church people
[40:07] here have been giving people out on the
[40:09] internet have been giving and I would
[40:12] like you to see uh the hard work that
[40:15] the people are doing there. So,
[40:19] uh these are
[40:22] uh the roof trusses that are going on
[40:25] now
[40:27] and we're just going to go through them
[40:29] quickly. Uh it was really really
[40:32] marvelous because the brothers in Ria
[40:36] and brother Dennis Dennis from Ria is
[40:39] coming to help them to actually put the
[40:41] roof on and uh I can see the hand of God
[40:44] because this whole second floor is
[40:47] because of Dennis's father and Ria who
[40:49] is a who's a builder and a contractor
[40:52] and he told them just with six more
[40:53] loads of concrete block you get a whole
[40:55] second floor to this building and that's
[40:58] exactly what they've
[41:00] Uh and and there you see it's very very
[41:04] becoming a very uh you know very
[41:06] respectable building. Uh
[41:10] just quickly
[41:16] there you see the roof tile starting to
[41:18] go on. And that was a that's a an
[41:21] amazing story within itself. They had
[41:24] costs for a roof on this building that
[41:27] were in the many many thousands of
[41:29] dollars and they found a a source for
[41:32] these tile and the tile are actually
[41:35] better than the other other product they
[41:37] were going to put on as brother Garrett
[41:39] Rodald and brother Sergey the pastor
[41:42] uh and uh the other tiles that were
[41:45] going to go on or the other roofing
[41:47] material that was going to go on was
[41:49] much inferior to this and they got this
[41:51] for about a quarter of the cost. So I
[41:53] think that's just absolutely wonderful
[41:57] and the brothers are working very hard.
[41:59] I think you recognize uh our brother
[42:02] Anatoli right here in front and that
[42:05] would be about half of the half of the
[42:08] group that's meeting there
[42:10] uh
[42:12] because the other side and this is in
[42:14] not in that building because that
[42:16] building's not finished. This is the
[42:18] place that they are meeting now. And uh
[42:23] brother brother Sergey
[42:25] here to the left, not right on the left
[42:28] but uh the three brothers on the left.
[42:31] The third one is brother Sergey and then
[42:33] then his brother Dennis
[42:35] uh to his right. And he's a wonderful
[42:39] interpreter also in the rush. And
[42:41] there's the tile. So my brothers
[42:44] hoisting it around. They're smiling.
[42:51] So, I'm just clicking through these
[42:53] very, very quickly because we don't want
[42:55] to take any more time than we need to.
[42:57] And that's that brings you up to date
[42:59] where we're at. And so, we're happy
[43:01] about that. Uh you have given and and
[43:05] the Lord has
[43:07] uh put it in the in their hearts. Uh you
[43:11] know, they're going to have a place to
[43:13] meet. And I would say like one brother
[43:15] here in the church said, "We we've got
[43:17] to see them in the building before the
[43:19] snow flies, I'll ask you to pray about
[43:22] some other things."
[43:24] Uh when I was with brother Sergey just a
[43:26] few days ago in Germany, he said uh to
[43:29] connect the water is going to cost like
[43:32] maybe 10 112,000
[43:35] just to connect the water to get a
[43:37] connection. they have to get the
[43:39] connection from another man who paid
[43:41] $30,000
[43:43] to have a uh have a connection. And so
[43:47] he he got this connection in
[43:49] anticipation that two or three others
[43:51] including the church would uh assist him
[43:54] and then they'll just break up that
[43:55] 30,000 between them. But he said even if
[43:59] I say today that we want to connect he
[44:03] said it could take four to 5 months to
[44:05] get the connection because things are
[44:08] just so ponderous and so bureaucratic
[44:12] and so slow. It's just really amazing.
[44:16] And he said it could take four to five
[44:18] months. So I'd like you to pray that it
[44:20] won't take four to five months.
[44:28] Do you believe it?
[44:31] &gt;&gt; One of our sisters went in to get a
[44:33] passport
[44:35] and uh you know what that can be
[44:38] and it just happens that there was a
[44:40] sister working in the passport
[44:44] and I think they're both here this
[44:45] morning and when the sister working
[44:48] there said oh just give me your form.
[44:52] got the form. Bang, bang, bang. Here's
[44:54] your passport. I said, 'Why don't they
[44:56] do that with everybody?
[44:58] You know, they can do it with one
[45:00] person, they can do it with everybody,
[45:02] you know, but you know, we've got the
[45:04] system and we got to stay in the system
[45:06] and so we stay harnessed to the system
[45:09] and and as far as I'm concerned, it's a
[45:12] it's just a ponderous thing. And that's
[45:14] what they're that's what they're
[45:15] concerned with there. They've got to go
[45:17] through a whole process of getting the
[45:19] water, getting the gas, getting the
[45:20] electricity, those three things. And if
[45:23] you would pray, it's also very costly.
[45:25] Uh but I I just believe that they shall
[45:28] be in this building and worshiping God
[45:30] and using it. Let it be a lighthouse.
[45:32] There isn't any in this area. There
[45:35] isn't anything in this area. It isn't as
[45:36] though they've got all kinds of churches
[45:38] in the area they don't have. And so
[45:40] we're very, very happy. in the people.
[45:42] Incidentally, it has done just wonders
[45:45] for them as there was three
[45:47] congregations that came together and
[45:49] it's just done wonders for them and
[45:51] brought them unified them and brought
[45:52] them together and focused them on on one
[45:55] purpose. So, we're thankful for that.
[45:58] All right. Uh
[46:01] I wonder if you could uh stand with me
[46:04] and we're going to turn to the
[46:05] scripture.
[46:09] I wonder perhaps uh if we could just
[46:12] sing there is none like you, no one
[46:14] else.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, if you help me.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; There is none like you.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; No one else can touch my heart like you
[46:35] do.
[46:38] I could search for all eternity,
[46:43] Lord,
[46:45] and find
[46:47] there is none like you.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; There is none like
[46:59] there is none like you, Lord.
[47:03] No one else can touch my heart like you
[47:07] do.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; I can search for all eternity
[47:17] and find
[47:19] there is
[47:21] like you.
[47:25] Let's bow our heads together.
[47:28] Oh loving father in heaven,
[47:33] we have come this morning, Lord, that we
[47:36] might worship you. And I trust that our
[47:40] worship has been acceptable
[47:43] as we've entered into your courts with
[47:45] praise and thanksgiving.
[47:47] We thank you for the school children,
[47:49] Lord, for the teachers that have that
[47:52] have spent their time teaching and go
[47:54] the extra mile. for our brother Randy
[47:57] Timberman's Lord, the principal. We
[48:00] thank you for him and the efforts, oh
[48:03] God, of each family and the parents and
[48:06] everyone in the in the assembly, oh God.
[48:09] And we thank you, Father, for your
[48:12] guidance and your leadership and above
[48:15] all for your protection. You've kept us,
[48:18] oh God. And we say, keep us from the
[48:21] temptation and keep us from the evil, oh
[48:24] Lord. preserve your people, oh father.
[48:27] And uh we ask also that the Holy Spirit
[48:31] will just cause the flame in every heart
[48:35] for you have said you shall be witnesses
[48:37] unto me. And we want to be faithful
[48:40] witnesses, Lord. We want to declare this
[48:43] truth. We want to be good examples of
[48:45] it. And that's why we're here this
[48:47] morning. Teach us, Lord. And I pray
[48:50] you'll take me and let me be in the
[48:53] hollow of your hand. Let me be
[48:55] protected, oh God, that I may speak only
[48:58] what you would have spoken. Let the
[49:00] sheep be fed, Father, for this is your
[49:03] flock, the flock of God that led Israel
[49:07] out of bondage. You've led us out of
[49:09] bondage. You've led us out of darkness
[49:12] and confusion. And we're here to lift
[49:14] our voices and give you praise and
[49:16] thanksgiving in the name of Jesus
[49:18] Christ. Anoint the people as they hear
[49:21] and may we father with one spirit say
[49:24] speak Lord and I will answer in Jesus
[49:29] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[49:34] If you wish to take your Bibles and
[49:35] follow through the three places I want
[49:39] to read the same text we read last
[49:42] Sunday because I'm carrying on from last
[49:45] Sunday.
[49:47] 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter we'll read
[49:50] verse 17 and 18
[49:53] and then I'll be reading Hebrews 11
[49:56] and13
[49:58] and Philippians 3 and14
[50:06] 2 Corinthians 4:17
[50:09] for our light affliction
[50:12] which is but for a moment
[50:15] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[50:18] eternal weight of glory. I think that
[50:22] that verse, that scripture is so
[50:26] powerful. I trust we can grasp its
[50:29] depth.
[50:31] Our light affliction, anybody who's
[50:33] going through affliction, it's it's hard
[50:35] to call it light affliction, but I
[50:39] believe that Apostle Paul is speaking
[50:41] relatively
[50:42] in comparison with what the affliction
[50:45] is doing. and achieving in our lives
[50:48] that it's a light affliction, but and
[50:50] it's and because it's just for a moment,
[50:53] it workketh for us a far more exceeding
[50:56] and eternal weight of glory, while we
[50:59] look not at the things which are seen,
[51:03] but at the things which are not seen.
[51:06] For the things which are seen are
[51:08] temporal, they're transient, they're
[51:12] passing, they're short-lived. But the
[51:15] things which are not seen are eternal.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Then in Hebrews it speaks of the heroes
[51:22] of faith. And the 13th verse reads these
[51:25] all died in faith. And this was just
[51:29] after speaking of Abraham,
[51:32] Sarah and uh and and the seed that was
[51:36] to follow. These all died in faith,
[51:40] not having received the promises, but
[51:43] having seen them aar off. What was it?
[51:47] They saw the promises
[51:50] and were persuaded of them. I love that
[51:54] they were persuaded number one of them.
[51:57] And number two, they embraced them and
[52:00] number three and confessed that they
[52:03] were strangers and pilgrims on the
[52:05] earth. Apostle Paul says in Philippians
[52:09] 3:14,
[52:11] "I press toward the mark for the prize
[52:14] of the high calling of God in Christ
[52:18] Jesus." And I think we could all join
[52:20] Apostle Paul in his writing and in his
[52:24] confession and say, "Amen."
[52:26] &gt;&gt; We join with you in this.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh you may be seated.
[52:37] And I'll ask for your full attention.
[52:39] Not that you don't normally do so, but
[52:41] try not to be distracted by any
[52:43] movement. And let's not have any more
[52:46] movement than absolutely necessary
[52:48] because I have a ways to go and I want
[52:50] to go as quickly and as and and so have
[52:53] have the service as intense as possible.
[52:56] The Bible is a record of the
[53:01] supernatural.
[53:04] Is a record of those people who looked
[53:08] and did see the unseen.
[53:12] Their lives were directed.
[53:16] Their decisions were made not because of
[53:20] the circumstances that was surrounding
[53:23] them but because of what they saw. I
[53:27] think of the I think of the goals that
[53:30] people set for themselves.
[53:34] and the young people that have just
[53:36] graduated and and young families that
[53:39] are just beginning more or less they
[53:42] have by natural standards they have a
[53:46] future ahead of them and we all are at
[53:49] different uh different locations on the
[53:52] uh you know the ladder of time. Uh we
[53:55] have uh uh we we have perhaps some
[53:59] people are more uh have more foresight.
[54:03] Uh others perhaps are not so concerned
[54:05] about the future. But all of us have
[54:07] some goals. And uh uh there's nothing
[54:10] wrong with having goals. But we need to
[54:14] have a goal. We need to have our
[54:17] ultimate goal. And then you know you
[54:19] have goals along the way. We are we are
[54:23] told and and it's a common thing in in
[54:27] business practice or practice of uh uh
[54:30] in natural affairs that we set goals
[54:33] that are achievable. Don't try to have a
[54:36] goal that you can't make. You you set
[54:39] and you set a number of goals and you
[54:41] have you know you have targets along the
[54:43] way and say okay all right now we've
[54:46] achieved that and then we move to the
[54:47] next one and hopefully move to the next
[54:49] one. But with us in in life, we're not
[54:53] going to get away from having uh need to
[54:57] deal with uh this natural life.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; We we we're going to have to deal with
[55:02] it. Young people are going to have to
[55:04] deal with their education. They're going
[55:05] to have to deal with their uh make
[55:07] decisions about what they're going to do
[55:09] and their profession and and what
[55:11] they're going to do for uh the kind of
[55:13] work and the kind of income. And young
[55:15] couples are getting married and we're
[55:17] having a number of marriages this year.
[55:19] And there's planning and there's
[55:21] decisions that have to be made and where
[55:23] are we going to live and where are we
[55:24] going to work and all of these things.
[55:26] And I want to contend today that we can
[55:29] make those decisions without being uh
[55:32] overcome by them. We can make those
[55:35] decisions by uh and yet keep an ultimate
[55:38] goal in view. We can make those
[55:42] decisions by having and yet keep the
[55:45] ultimate prize as the prize and that as
[55:49] our all-consuming desire. This is our
[55:52] desire. This is our ambition. This is
[55:55] our goal. This is our purpose. And all
[55:58] of these things are just peripheral
[56:00] things. These are just things that we
[56:02] have to go through in achieving that
[56:05] one. We're here. We have certain
[56:07] responsibilities. And I would like to
[56:08] say also very very quickly that the
[56:11] things that God's word calls on us to do
[56:14] is not something that is of in the
[56:17] natural world. Now,
[56:20] uh, I'd like to say this as quickly as I
[56:22] can, but you I've had I've counseledled
[56:25] with so many many people and they've
[56:27] given their life to Christ and then they
[56:29] say, "I'm just so all these natural
[56:32] things that just I I just, you know, all
[56:34] these things of the world, all these
[56:35] natural things." They think their job is
[56:37] natural and and women caring for their
[56:39] families is natural. That's not natural.
[56:42] That's spiritual.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; The It's the word of God that calls on a
[56:45] man to provide for his family.
[56:49] It's not just some idea of the
[56:50] government. It's the word of God. The
[56:52] word of God tells us to and and the
[56:54] prophet brings it out that you know, if
[56:56] you're called to be a housewife, be the
[56:58] best housewife there is. Called to be a
[57:00] farmer, be the best farmer you there is.
[57:03] Where I think we should be the best and
[57:05] believers should be the best in the in
[57:07] the even in the what they call the
[57:09] natural. And that is why a believer can
[57:12] keep the unseen before them.
[57:16] Uh
[57:18] so I just as I said a moment ago that
[57:20] the Bible is a a record of those that
[57:22] looked through the eyes of faith and uh
[57:26] here's just a few that I selected.
[57:28] Brother Brandham says uh uh regarding
[57:31] the prophet Joel. He said looking down
[57:34] through eyes of faith he saw this vine
[57:37] coming up out of Genesis.
[57:40] He said of Job through the eyes of faith
[57:44] 4,000 years ahead. And he said uh that
[57:48] he saw what the lamb meant. He saw what
[57:50] you mean. And and and he saw the
[57:53] promise. I know that my redeemer liveth
[57:56] and at the last days he'll stand on the
[57:58] earth. And those skinworms take me back
[58:01] like it did that flower yet in my flesh
[58:05] shall I see God. Paul, he looked through
[58:08] the eyes of faith and he looked across
[58:10] the seas of time and said that in the
[58:13] last days perilous times shall come. He
[58:17] looked through and he didn't only see
[58:19] good times. He saw perilous times by
[58:22] eyes of faith. And he said they would be
[58:24] high-minded and lovers of pleasure and
[58:26] more than lovers of God. Sooner go out
[58:29] on a Sunday afternoon, he said, and play
[58:31] golf then come to church because it's
[58:33] too hot. He saw those kind of
[58:35] conditions. He saw people become that
[58:37] kind of lax and and pleasure mad. I'm
[58:40] glad we're able to say that's not our
[58:43] part.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're interested in. He
[58:46] he says to another sister that he's
[58:48] speaking to, sister by eyes of faith.
[58:51] Let's look there to Calvary. Are you
[58:53] stand on a platform and look to I and
[58:56] look with eyes of faith to Calvary. It's
[58:58] entirely possible.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It's entirely possible to focus on
[59:02] Calvary. It's entirely possible with
[59:06] eyes of faith to reach through to a
[59:08] finished promise and bring it down into
[59:11] this realm and experience the realities
[59:14] of God.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And as I spoke last week on hungering
[59:17] for the realities of God, that's what
[59:20] I'm hungering for. And I'm I'm speaking
[59:22] the second part two on that same
[59:24] subject. Without faith, it's impossible.
[59:28] Uh the works is without faith, works is
[59:30] dead. And he said, "By eyes of faith, we
[59:33] look there and see that there's where
[59:35] the debt was paid." Every person in this
[59:38] building needs to look with eyes of
[59:41] faith and see that your debt was paid
[59:44] &gt;&gt; and see it so well stamped paid that
[59:47] Satan cannot at any point in time lay
[59:51] any charge to you.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The debt was paid. Jesus Christ the same
[59:57] yesterday. He said, "We're looking
[59:59] towards Calvary. By eyes of faith, we
[1:00:02] believe that he's here."
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We're not just seeing Calvary,
[1:00:08] but we're seeing that the one that was
[1:00:09] on Calvary has been raised from history,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; and he's here to do the same things that
[1:00:15] he always did
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; in expectation.
[1:00:21] I want to just read a few more of these
[1:00:25] just to start with. He said, 'You know,
[1:00:28] I feel religious now.
[1:00:30] I really do. He said, I wasn't expecting
[1:00:33] this, but to think of God, he said,
[1:00:36] Abraham called those things which were
[1:00:40] not as though they were. He didn't look
[1:00:43] at the natural thing. Now, that's our
[1:00:45] father in the faith. He didn't look at
[1:00:47] the natural thing. He looked at the
[1:00:50] unseen. He looked by eyes of faith what
[1:00:54] God said. And what God said God would
[1:00:57] keep. He knew he could keep it. So he
[1:01:01] believed it and testified of the things
[1:01:03] that he didn't see as though they had
[1:01:06] already happened.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I hope you get it."
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we get it, too.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I always look at things.
[1:01:21] Brother brother Brandham preached in
[1:01:23] Chicago
[1:01:25] on Wednesday
[1:01:27] in uh this back in 1955. He preached on
[1:01:30] the power of the devil.
[1:01:33] Then the very next night he came and he
[1:01:35] preached on the power of God.
[1:01:39] And I can tell you I just know in uh in
[1:01:42] the mind of God he just had him he had
[1:01:45] him putting it in that order. Let the
[1:01:47] people hear the power of the devil. And
[1:01:49] in that he says, "And when we see Satan
[1:01:52] in all of his corruption and making you
[1:01:55] young ladies and men and old and
[1:01:57] everything out here on the street drunk
[1:02:00] and cursing and swearing and acting the
[1:02:02] way that they're doing under Satan's
[1:02:04] domain." But he says, "But we can look
[1:02:07] beyond that.
[1:02:11] All the things that are so cumbersome,
[1:02:15] so dark, so vile, so perverted, so
[1:02:19] corrupt. And it is friends. You live in
[1:02:22] a very dark world.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And you are very bright lights
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; in a very dark place.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You know that. Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; But we can look beyond that with eyes of
[1:02:42] faith
[1:02:43] and see a perfect world
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; with a perfect people
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; during a time of a millennium
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; not up in the future. I'm saying to you
[1:02:56] on the basis of this word you can see
[1:02:59] that now. Apostle Paul says we are not
[1:03:03] to look at the natural things. For the
[1:03:06] things that are seen are temporal. These
[1:03:09] bodies are temporal. This building is
[1:03:12] passing. All that we see, all that
[1:03:14] you've accumulated, all that you are or
[1:03:17] known as, it's all passing. But there's
[1:03:20] another place.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; There's a perfect world where there is
[1:03:24] no sin,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; no devil, no temptation. It's a perfect
[1:03:29] world. perfect world
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; and we're either headed there or we're
[1:03:36] headed for a very dark chaotic place. I
[1:03:39] don't want to I don't want any part of
[1:03:41] the tribulation.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want any part of being away from
[1:03:46] God. I can't even comprehend what it
[1:03:50] would be to be out of fellowship and out
[1:03:52] of the presence of God. I can't
[1:03:54] comprehend that. I can't even
[1:03:57] comprehend. I think about the
[1:03:58] congregation. I think about the offices
[1:04:01] of the church. I think about my own
[1:04:03] family. I think about my grandchildren,
[1:04:05] great grandchildren. I can't comprehend.
[1:04:08] I cannot accept
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; as long as God has given me his word and
[1:04:13] said, "Believe.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; For all things are possible. I cannot
[1:04:19] comprehend that a man or a woman has to
[1:04:22] accept anything outside of the promises
[1:04:25] of God."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And I believe that
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; with all that's within me. I believe
[1:04:34] that sir.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; It may be and may look impossible.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; But that goes against the scripture.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; For the scripture says nothing shall be
[1:04:51] impossible.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; You agree with that?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be impossible. Why don't
[1:05:01] you make that confession with me?
[1:05:03] Nothing shall be impossible. Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] To him that believe it.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here this morning.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; We're here as a even our physical bodies
[1:05:13] sitting here in seats. We're saying
[1:05:15] something. We're making a declaration.
[1:05:17] We're not saying that, you know, well,
[1:05:19] here I am to have some some extend my
[1:05:22] social life or my friends or my
[1:05:24] influence. We're not here. I'm not here
[1:05:26] to gain any brownie points. I'm here to
[1:05:28] make a declaration. I was happy when I
[1:05:31] thought of coming to church this morning
[1:05:33] and being able to say something out of
[1:05:35] the word of God. Something that's
[1:05:37] worthwhile. This is the life.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And this world is passing away.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I was thinking of the goals the goals
[1:05:48] that we have and we have you know points
[1:05:51] of reference
[1:05:53] and if you read in uh in the in the
[1:05:55] seals message and the opening of the
[1:05:56] seals brother Brandon speaks about the
[1:05:59] opening of the seal and then a a seal is
[1:06:02] opened and a and a thunder is a thunder
[1:06:05] roars and and then a a plague falls and
[1:06:09] brother Brandham says and he says this
[1:06:12] is the plan of it And after each seal is
[1:06:15] opened, it follows the same process. And
[1:06:18] then a plague falls. He sends his
[1:06:20] messenger. He sends his message. The
[1:06:22] seal is open. You hear the thunder and
[1:06:24] the voice of God. He sends his messenger
[1:06:26] for that age and declares the word for
[1:06:28] that age. And it's rejected. And then a
[1:06:31] plague falls. And he says a temporary
[1:06:34] judgment.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; There's a temporary judgment. And the
[1:06:38] world has gone through those temporary
[1:06:40] judgments. But God, he's not he's not
[1:06:43] satisfied with temporary judgments.
[1:06:46] There's coming an ultimate judgment.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And in that ultimate judgment, he's
[1:06:51] going to finalize the redemption of the
[1:06:54] earth.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; I can tell you the perfect earth's not
[1:06:57] going to be raped of its mountains and
[1:07:00] its forests and so on and so forth. It's
[1:07:03] not going to be polluted and
[1:07:04] contaminated. They talk about pollution.
[1:07:07] Man is the greatest pollutant. It's man
[1:07:10] that's polluting the earth.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; The earth keeps trying to renew itself.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Man is the pollutant.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He's the one who's invented all of the
[1:07:19] plastics and the chemicals and all of
[1:07:21] these things and take all the oil out
[1:07:23] and bring more death all the time. Man,
[1:07:26] he's the main pollutant. And how God is
[1:07:28] going to clean up the earth, he's going
[1:07:29] to clean up man.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have any of that
[1:07:34] scientific stuff over there. We're going
[1:07:36] to have a science in a world that's so
[1:07:38] far beyond that this isn't even in the
[1:07:40] thinking of it.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; So he said with eyes of faith we can see
[1:07:52] a perfect world and a perfect per people
[1:07:54] during a time of a millennium
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; where there won't be any cursing and any
[1:07:58] swearing and drinking and any death and
[1:08:01] sorrow.
[1:08:03] It's all wiped away because of the
[1:08:05] redeemer
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; redemption has taken place. And then in
[1:08:09] the very next night, the power of God,
[1:08:11] he said, when eyes of faith, what a
[1:08:14] power faith has. Oh, it goes so far
[1:08:17] beyond the devil's power. He just
[1:08:19] preached that the night before. I want
[1:08:21] you to I want you to you might as well
[1:08:24] have sat there and preach it one night
[1:08:26] and the next night because this word's
[1:08:28] eternal word and the it it goes there.
[1:08:32] It goes so far beyond the devil's power.
[1:08:35] The devil takes you to death, but faith
[1:08:37] looks beyond that.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; This a reality, friends.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; We've had our funerals.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; We've gone to our gravesides.
[1:08:49] We've lost our loved ones. We've lost
[1:08:52] precious people. But faith
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; looks beyond that. Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; This word of God declares we shall not
[1:09:02] all sleep.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; It's not just some mind over matter.
[1:09:08] It's a reality because today we are like
[1:09:11] our forefathers. We look beyond. We must
[1:09:14] look beyond. And that must be our focus.
[1:09:17] We must look beyond it. We see all this
[1:09:20] chaos down here. We hear all this rumble
[1:09:23] and all this noise.
[1:09:26] Oh, I even take my wife and I just taken
[1:09:30] out for a walk and bunch of young men
[1:09:32] like these young fellas here. How glad I
[1:09:35] am to see your clean faces and know your
[1:09:39] hearts are clean. And here just spewing
[1:09:42] out all kinds of vulgarity which should
[1:09:45] be against the law.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It used to be against the law. I'll tell
[1:09:49] you what, if you raise up today and say
[1:09:51] very much, you might be stabbed for it
[1:09:53] right on the street. And I thought, "Oh,
[1:09:56] God, we're uh we're on our way to a
[1:09:58] place that'll never be heard again.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That vile voice will never be heard
[1:10:06] again. That demon who's even inspiring
[1:10:08] it, he's going,
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I want a ringside seat
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; when God destroys cancer.
[1:10:17] Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; When the serpent, Satan himself, is cast
[1:10:22] into the lake of fire, I want a balcony
[1:10:25] seat.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be able to see it. And the the
[1:10:29] Bible says the redeemed are going to
[1:10:31] shout glory.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; They're going to say, "Hallelujah."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You might as well start it right now.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I read today where brother Brandham
[1:10:40] says, "If you don't like shouting, don't
[1:10:42] go to heaven. Don't plan to go there.
[1:10:45] Going to be a lot of noise over there.
[1:10:47] People are going to be shouting. They're
[1:10:49] going to be singing. They're going to be
[1:10:50] dancing on the streets of glory.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And it can be a reality even now.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; You can see it now. And you need to see
[1:11:00] it. If you keep your eyes down here,
[1:11:02] you'll be heavy-hearted. You'll be cast
[1:11:05] down. And he'll use those things to drag
[1:11:08] you down. When you can say, "I'm looking
[1:11:10] beyond that. I look beyond death. I look
[1:11:14] beyond the tombstone. I look beyond the
[1:11:17] sickness and the disease. I look beyond
[1:11:20] the affliction which is just for a
[1:11:22] moment. I look to the realities of God.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; And there are they are a reality to me
[1:11:29] by faith.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] And the last one he said in the the
[1:11:39] message the darkest hour then Jesus
[1:11:41] comes along.
[1:11:44] And today he says when we go to the
[1:11:46] grave with our loved ones and hear the
[1:11:48] minister say ashes to ashes and dust to
[1:11:51] dust and earth to earth and hear the
[1:11:54] clouds dropping in upon the casket. But
[1:11:59] he says, "But we could look at that and
[1:12:02] by eyes of faith, we can look across the
[1:12:04] sea, yonder, and see the empty tomb."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you had that experience,
[1:12:10] but I I thought if I ever have to go to
[1:12:13] another graveside, I'm going to look
[1:12:15] across that casket. I'm going to look
[1:12:17] across and with eyes of faith, I'm going
[1:12:19] to look at an empty tomb.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; That is why our faith is different from
[1:12:24] every faith on earth.
[1:12:26] Muhammad is still in his grave.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Buddha is in his grave. Probably a
[1:12:31] teaspoon of ashes. All these great
[1:12:34] leaders who've been holy men to their
[1:12:37] people are still in their grave. You and
[1:12:40] I have an empty tomb.
[1:12:43] And the one that came out of that tomb
[1:12:45] is here on the platform today. The one
[1:12:47] that is in that was in that tomb is here
[1:12:49] in this building today. He has raised
[1:12:52] from Calvary from He is raised from the
[1:12:55] from the tomb.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And he sent his messenger and proved
[1:13:03] that he's a son of man revealed again
[1:13:06] today.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:10] forever.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And what he did back there, he'll still
[1:13:13] do today.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of his word. Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And so we look beyond these temporal
[1:13:25] things
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; which are enduring only for a while,
[1:13:30] short-lived,
[1:13:31] only for a season, transient, and
[1:13:35] temporary.
[1:13:36] Lord,
[1:13:38] the psalmist David said, "Man is like a
[1:13:41] van is like to vanity. His days are as a
[1:13:45] shadow that passeth away."
[1:13:49] Paul said in Corinthians, "And they that
[1:13:51] use this world is not abusing it. For
[1:13:55] the fashion of this world,
[1:13:58] fashion of this world passeth away. The
[1:14:02] fashion, the design, not the fashion as
[1:14:05] the fashion industry so much, but the
[1:14:07] the order of this world, the arrangement
[1:14:10] of this world, this cosmos, it's passing
[1:14:13] away. That's why it keeps changing.
[1:14:17] Even in our short lifetime, it changes
[1:14:19] dramatically.
[1:14:21] And John said, "The world passeth away,
[1:14:25] and the lust thereof, the desires
[1:14:27] thereof, lust is strong desires, but he
[1:14:30] that doeth the will of God abideth
[1:14:32] forever."
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; And as you believe it, you may say,
[1:14:34] "Amen."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven. John said in
[1:14:39] Revelation 21, "And I saw a new heaven."
[1:14:43] He saw it.
[1:14:45] He was on Patmas,
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; but he saw something else.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't see the vipers
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; and that dry piece of rock that he was
[1:14:54] on and Patmas, but he saw a new heaven.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And a new earth.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And he saw the first heaven and the
[1:15:03] first earth were passed away.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And there was no more sea. He said in 21
[1:15:10] and4 and God shall wipe away
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; all tears from their eyes
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and there's nobody here I don't think a
[1:15:18] single person here but what has struck
[1:15:21] that moment in life where tears welled
[1:15:24] up in your eyes over some situation or
[1:15:29] over some desire or maybe over some joy
[1:15:33] that you had. I hope you had tears of
[1:15:35] joy. But even brother Brandham says that
[1:15:38] the marriage supper of the lamb will sit
[1:15:40] across from one another
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; and we'll look at one another
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; and we'll begin to weep for joy
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; to know we've made it
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; and it's all over.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't want anybody, you
[1:15:54] wouldn't want your best friend to call
[1:15:56] you back.
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; We don't want our friends to come back.
[1:16:02] I don't want my parents to come back and
[1:16:05] go through what I'm going through or go
[1:16:07] through what you and I have to go
[1:16:08] through. We're so glad it's over. And
[1:16:11] we'll weep. We'll we'll have tears of
[1:16:13] joy, not sorrow. Joy will run down our
[1:16:16] face
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; and we'll grip one another and embrace
[1:16:20] one another.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That is our vision. That's what we see
[1:16:24] because that is a reality.
[1:16:28] you're going to go to a restaurant today
[1:16:30] or go to a home and and have your
[1:16:32] dinner, whatever more, that's not a
[1:16:34] reality cuz it's passing.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; The music you hear in the thumping on
[1:16:39] the in the cars and the automobiles is
[1:16:40] not a reality.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Your pain, your sorrow, your affliction,
[1:16:46] your death that is experienced is not a
[1:16:49] reality. It's a passing vanity.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; And the Bible calls them lying vanities
[1:16:55] because it's not true. If it's not true,
[1:16:58] it can't be a reality.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'll weep for joy
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; and the king will come out
[1:17:14] and he will wipe those tears from your
[1:17:16] eyes." Just imagine.
[1:17:20] Don't cry anymore, children.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; It's all over.
[1:17:30] We don't want some of these goals
[1:17:33] to be beyond
[1:17:35] or think it's beyond reach.
[1:17:38] You must never think it's beyond reach.
[1:17:45] As we've pondered this
[1:17:48] and thought about this, I have
[1:17:49] encountered
[1:17:52] scripture
[1:17:53] and the approach of God's prophet to the
[1:17:56] scripture
[1:17:57] and the things and because we feel we
[1:18:01] are so far from attaining it
[1:18:04] must never lose sight of it.
[1:18:07] Must never lose sight of it. I said
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; regardless of how impossible it may seem
[1:18:14] for you say I'll never attain to that.
[1:18:17] I'll just tell you that's not your
[1:18:19] problem.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; What is your what is your your your
[1:18:24] commission is to see it to believe it
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; and to set your face towards it.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's that's your pro that's your task.
[1:18:33] That's your job. That's your challenge.
[1:18:35] Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; It's God's responsibility to bring you
[1:18:38] there.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; So, we do not look at the things that
[1:18:41] are temporal, but we are looking at the
[1:18:43] things that are eternal, the things that
[1:18:45] are without beginning or end.
[1:18:48] I'm going to read the same quote from
[1:18:50] last Sunday once again, please. I think
[1:18:53] it's striking. The whole armor
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; of Christianity, and you do need armor.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; The whole armor of Christianity is
[1:19:02] faith.
[1:19:04] Everything that we have is unseen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's a staggering statement.
[1:19:10] Everything that we have
[1:19:13] that you actually possess is unseen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The only things that's real is unseen,
[1:19:22] unexplained.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; The things that can be explained are not
[1:19:27] real.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; They're superficial,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; right? and die.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But the things that cannot be explained
[1:19:37] are immortal.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; The whole realm, the things that can't
[1:19:42] be explained. And that's what they say
[1:19:44] about realities. There are things that
[1:19:47] we are they're not even we're not even
[1:19:49] made to comprehend them. It goes beyond
[1:19:52] our comprehension.
[1:19:55] And I know it gets still in here and it
[1:19:57] gets quiet because you're pondering it,
[1:19:58] but those words are true.
[1:20:02] And that's why the Apostle Paul says we
[1:20:04] look not
[1:20:06] and that's a challenge. We look not at
[1:20:09] the things that are seen
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; because they're temporal.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I can't be consumed
[1:20:17] with the technical parts
[1:20:20] of of life. If you are consumed with
[1:20:23] that say, "Oh, you have a goal. You may
[1:20:26] have a goal in education. You may have a
[1:20:28] goal in your profession. You may have a
[1:20:30] goal in your business. Fine. Just keep
[1:20:33] moving on and let that goal only be a
[1:20:37] an intermediate.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Uh let it be just something that you're
[1:20:41] going to achieve and go on from there.
[1:20:43] But what is driving you? And I'm going
[1:20:45] to be coming to this in just a few
[1:20:47] moments.
[1:20:49] We're being driven.
[1:20:51] Believers are driven people.
[1:20:54] There's a call on our life. And I'm
[1:20:58] going to approach that in just a few
[1:20:59] minutes. And that call is driving us to
[1:21:03] the realities of God. And that is why if
[1:21:06] you get into Hebrews in the faith
[1:21:09] chapter and I took the one of my text uh
[1:21:12] scriptures from that
[1:21:15] and the and Paul said in Hebrews 12, but
[1:21:17] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:21:20] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:21:23] that was set before him endured the
[1:21:25] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:21:28] down. Do you think that Jesus looked to
[1:21:30] Calvary and the suffering as the goal?
[1:21:33] No. He looked beyond that.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; He looked to the joy
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; of the achievement of Calvary.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says of of Abraham,
[1:21:46] Abraham says, "For he looked for a city
[1:21:49] which hath foundations whose builder is
[1:21:52] and maker is God." I'm going to just
[1:21:54] dwell on this and taking a slight shift
[1:21:56] for just a moment. says he looked for a
[1:21:59] city. And the Hebrew word is he he
[1:22:02] waited in expectation for the city. The
[1:22:06] prophet of God says he looked for the
[1:22:08] city because he had met the king of the
[1:22:10] city. He had met Melzdc who was in a
[1:22:13] theophony form who appeared in the
[1:22:16] priesthood as king and priest high
[1:22:19] priest of the most high God. He had met
[1:22:22] him and it and and and Melzdc came to
[1:22:25] Abraham who was his prophet and all
[1:22:28] those three offices converging at that
[1:22:30] moment prophet priest and king at one
[1:22:33] time on earth. Oh, I've said it many
[1:22:35] times, but it was the father coming to
[1:22:38] the father. And then brother Brandham
[1:22:39] says, you don't see, you don't hear any
[1:22:41] more of me become because he became
[1:22:44] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ where the father came
[1:22:49] to the father in the form of Melzdc.
[1:22:51] Then Jesus Christ came to Abraham's
[1:22:54] sons.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; In the form of a son,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; the son of man,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; the son of God, and the son of David. So
[1:23:01] the father came to the father and the
[1:23:02] son came to the sons.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; That's why Abraham Abraham the father
[1:23:10] mechazedc came to Abraham and Abraham
[1:23:13] now looked for the city because he says
[1:23:15] this is a king of the city.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You and I have met the son
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; and now we must look
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; because we've already met him.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; So we know there's a place. He told us
[1:23:30] there's a place.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; He told us that you believe in me,
[1:23:34] you'll never die.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where we look.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And we wait and we expect it.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say to this congregation,
[1:23:49] don't be consumed with all this that is
[1:23:53] passing.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Don't be consumed with it. We've got to
[1:23:57] we we we've got to work our way through
[1:23:59] life, but this is not the this is not
[1:24:01] the important thing.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; He says Abraham in the future home. He
[1:24:08] was looking for it. And he professed
[1:24:10] that he was a pilgrim and a stranger.
[1:24:13] That's what Apostle Paul said in
[1:24:15] Hebrews. For he looked for a city whose
[1:24:17] builder and maker was God. That prophet
[1:24:21] knowing it was somewhere.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; John saw it coming down. But Abraham
[1:24:26] thought it must be on the earth right
[1:24:28] then.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Why? He had met
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; When he met Melzdc, he thought this city
[1:24:35] is already here.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And there was nothing wrong with that.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; The king of it. And gave him a tithe.
[1:24:49] Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] So we we we look to the we look to the
[1:24:54] resurrection.
[1:24:55] We look to the catching away. We look to
[1:24:58] the redeemed. We look to the wedding
[1:25:00] supper because we have because we have
[1:25:03] met him.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Because we've been wedded to him.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I trust you have experienced that.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; We look not at the things which are
[1:25:16] temporal and passing.
[1:25:19] And it is this
[1:25:21] it is this
[1:25:24] uh something that takes place and I have
[1:25:28] a hard time defining it
[1:25:31] but I don't have difficulty experiencing
[1:25:33] it and I want to I want to just talk to
[1:25:39] you about it and that is the call
[1:25:44] the call of God
[1:25:47] because God Jesus Jesus said, "The
[1:25:49] world, they don't see me. They won't see
[1:25:52] me,
[1:25:53] but you will see me."
[1:25:57] God spoke about Abraham
[1:26:01] and that and the Bible says, "And they
[1:26:02] saw the promises a far off." Brother
[1:26:06] Brandon breaks that down. And I have the
[1:26:09] quote. I'll probably come to a little
[1:26:11] later. And he says he looked
[1:26:15] he looked to the unseen and he saw
[1:26:18] Isaac.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He actually saw Isaac. He was looking to
[1:26:23] the unseen. He saw Isaac. Now that was
[1:26:25] the father of the faith. So Isaac
[1:26:30] and Isaac was a type of Christ. We are
[1:26:33] children of Abraham by faith. Is that
[1:26:36] correct? Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; So now, and we have the same faith of
[1:26:40] Abraham.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; We don't see the Isaac that he saw,
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; but we see the Isaac that that Isaac
[1:26:47] reflected.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; That Isaac spoke of Christ.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? We need to have
[1:26:53] our vision cleared up.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; We need to see him
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; as he is
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; today. We need to see him not just to
[1:27:04] hear certain words. Not just to know
[1:27:06] that Luke 17:30 has been fulfilled. In
[1:27:09] the day when you see Sodom in the days
[1:27:10] of Noah returned, even thus shall it be
[1:27:13] when the son of man is revealed.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And when we see him actually see him
[1:27:20] revealed, we see a person.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; We see the person that the word has
[1:27:25] defined. God has always defined himself.
[1:27:28] His most accurate definition of himself
[1:27:32] has been in word form.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; That's why he always came in word form.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul saw a bright light. He
[1:27:38] might have got up and said, "Oh, what an
[1:27:41] experience. I saw a light that struck me
[1:27:42] to the ground, turned me blind." No,
[1:27:44] that wasn't it. He knew that was God. He
[1:27:48] knew that was the same presence. He knew
[1:27:50] that was the holy presence of almighty
[1:27:52] Jehovah God. Who art thou Lord? Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And he had to define himself in word
[1:27:58] form. Paul knew about Jesus.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; He he was even on his way to to do
[1:28:04] destructive things to the followers and
[1:28:06] disciples of Jesus. He knew who Jesus
[1:28:08] was,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; In a in a passing way, in a temporal
[1:28:13] way. Now he's struck down by a light.
[1:28:16] Who art thou, Lord? And a voice comes.
[1:28:19] He hears a voice and it says, I am
[1:28:22] Jesus. Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the
[1:28:27] pricks. And in that one experience, God
[1:28:31] has defined himself. And then the light
[1:28:34] goes on inwardly. He's still blind. But
[1:28:37] now he knows that it's Jesus Christ.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; So he looks beyond even those that he's
[1:28:42] going to persecute.
[1:28:48] God has defined himself. Now here,
[1:28:51] listen to what the scripture says.
[1:28:55] Abraham asks God, "How will I know?
[1:29:00] You know, you you've promised a seed.
[1:29:02] I'll have a seed. I'll have a seed." And
[1:29:05] the Bible says that they looked to the
[1:29:07] promises
[1:29:09] even though they were a far off. They
[1:29:11] looked to the promises.
[1:29:13] Abraham's faith.
[1:29:16] That's the kind of faith we have. That's
[1:29:17] the kind of quality of faith that's in
[1:29:20] the believer. We can look at a promise.
[1:29:23] If it happens tomorrow, fine. If it
[1:29:26] doesn't, it doesn't change anything.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; The sooner we go, the sooner the
[1:29:39] catching away of the bride of Jesus
[1:29:40] Christ, the better. But if it doesn't
[1:29:43] happen, and sometimes people get very
[1:29:45] disheartened if I say maybe you got 50
[1:29:47] years, oh, shows you're looking at the
[1:29:51] natural.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not destroying your faith. It shows
[1:29:56] that you're looking at the temporal
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; cuz you want to escape it. The scripture
[1:30:01] says we don't want to. We're not
[1:30:03] groaning to be unclothed.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; We're groaning to be clothed upon.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; We don't groan because of our
[1:30:14] circumstances.
[1:30:15] We don't groan because we're here in
[1:30:17] this world. God put you here.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; We're not groaning over our
[1:30:21] circumstances. God allowed you to be in
[1:30:24] your circumstances.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And God wants you to be victorious over
[1:30:29] it. How can I be victorious, Brother Ed?
[1:30:31] You can be victorious by looking beyond
[1:30:33] the circumstances. I look over the head
[1:30:36] of the dust
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; and the den and the noise.
[1:30:41] Hallelujah.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; I have I've had a lot of experience and
[1:30:51] I'm
[1:30:53] going to relate a little bit today.
[1:30:57] I had a man that I counseledled with
[1:30:59] over a period of years. You know what
[1:31:01] his big problem was? He says, "I hate
[1:31:04] working for my I hate working to provide
[1:31:07] for my family."
[1:31:09] That was always his problem. I hate
[1:31:11] working to provide for my family. I just
[1:31:14] can't. Well, why do I have to work for
[1:31:16] them? Is you know where he is today? I
[1:31:18] don't know. He's certainly not here.
[1:31:25] Why would he be here?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely contrary to the word
[1:31:29] of God.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You'll be quiet.
[1:31:37] You'll really think these things
[1:31:39] overach.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; If we look at these things,
[1:31:45] we will most certainly be distracted.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And most certainly I I think that if a
[1:31:52] man has his has his priorities right and
[1:31:55] he sees what his purpose is on earth, he
[1:31:58] just love
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word of God. Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Whether his responsibilities are few or
[1:32:04] many,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; he'll he'll love to fulfill the word of
[1:32:08] God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says this of Abraham
[1:32:13] because he said, "How will I know that I
[1:32:16] inherit this land?" I'll maybe just uh
[1:32:20] uh turn to it quickly. You can turn with
[1:32:22] me if you would. It's in um
[1:32:44] It's in Genesis 15
[1:32:58] and and uh in the second verse says,
[1:33:01] "And Abraham said, Abram said, Lord God,
[1:33:05] what wilt thou give me seeing I go
[1:33:08] childless and the steward of my house is
[1:33:11] this Eleazar of Damascus?" And Abram
[1:33:14] said, Behold, to me, thou hast given no
[1:33:17] seed. And lo, one born in my house is
[1:33:21] mine heir. And behold, the word of the
[1:33:24] Lord came unto him, saying, This shall
[1:33:26] not be thine heir, but he that shall
[1:33:30] come forth out of thine own bowels shall
[1:33:34] be thine heir. And he brought them forth
[1:33:37] abroad and said, "Look now toward heaven
[1:33:39] and tell the stars if thou can if thou
[1:33:42] be able to number them." And he said
[1:33:44] unto him, "So shall thy seed be." And he
[1:33:48] believed in the Lord. And it was counted
[1:33:50] to him for righteousness. Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; And that is where God then answered him
[1:33:55] and said, "Take a ram of 3 years old and
[1:33:59] take a heer 3 years old and a goat of
[1:34:01] three years old and uh a ram of three
[1:34:05] years old and turtle dove and a young
[1:34:07] pigeon." And this is where he divided
[1:34:09] the pieces and that's where God made a
[1:34:10] covenant with him.
[1:34:13] But he was asking, "How will I know?"
[1:34:15] And God showed him Calvary, which we
[1:34:17] have spoken on that, but we don't want
[1:34:19] to take the time for it right now. But
[1:34:21] then in in uh 21 Genesis 21 and 12 and
[1:34:26] God said to Abraham, "Let it not be
[1:34:29] grievous because what was grievous now
[1:34:31] is Ishmael had come on the scene."
[1:34:34] And there was contention and Sarah uh
[1:34:37] would not have Hagar and his s and and
[1:34:41] her son mocking Isaac at this time of
[1:34:44] the weaning. And God said unto Abraham,
[1:34:47] verse 12, "Let it not be grievous in thy
[1:34:50] sight, because of the lad, and because
[1:34:53] of thy bond woman,
[1:34:56] in all that Sarah hath said unto thee,
[1:35:00] hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac
[1:35:04] shall thy seed be called." Now, I'm just
[1:35:07] going to need your full attention for a
[1:35:09] for the next few moments.
[1:35:12] when God said to Abram and Abraham was
[1:35:15] saying how will I know that uh you
[1:35:20] haven't given me any seed and it was
[1:35:23] after this then he's given he has and
[1:35:27] Sarah had said take Hagar
[1:35:30] so he takes her counsel and has a child
[1:35:33] by Hagar and has a son so now he does
[1:35:36] have seed and it's Ishmamail
[1:35:40] all Right
[1:35:42] then now the same one who told him take
[1:35:46] Hagar now is saying I won't have her I
[1:35:49] won't have this bond woman and her son
[1:35:52] mocking my son now the one that came by
[1:35:55] her
[1:36:00] the the
[1:36:03] without getting into it but we find that
[1:36:08] Cain
[1:36:10] Cain
[1:36:12] was the wrong seed in the right womb.
[1:36:18] Abel was the right seed in the right
[1:36:21] womb. And he was righteous.
[1:36:27] Ishmael
[1:36:28] was the right seed in the wrong womb.
[1:36:33] Isaac was the right seed in the right
[1:36:36] womb.
[1:36:38] And so when Sarah now
[1:36:42] when she receives this
[1:36:45] her son which is the right seed in the
[1:36:47] right womb,
[1:36:50] she will not allow the wild one because
[1:36:55] ca Cain was wild. Ishmamail was wild
[1:37:00] and she will not tolerate him mocking
[1:37:03] this right one the type of Christ
[1:37:07] and so he can't be and so now
[1:37:12] Abraham is caught in the midst of this
[1:37:15] and God said then don't let it be
[1:37:18] grievous to you
[1:37:22] because of the lad and because of the
[1:37:25] bond woman
[1:37:27] in all that Sarah hath said. Now Sarah
[1:37:30] has a has something that she is uh
[1:37:34] putting forward and Apostle Paul refers
[1:37:38] directly to her words and brings it on
[1:37:40] into the New Testament.
[1:37:43] Hearken unto her for in Isaac shall thy
[1:37:47] seed be called.
[1:37:49] Now, Isaac was a son of promise.
[1:37:55] Ishmael,
[1:37:57] he took a bond woman who was capable of
[1:37:59] conceiving.
[1:38:02] Sarah was not capable of conceiving.
[1:38:05] So now this goes way beyond the natural
[1:38:08] ability.
[1:38:10] So he becomes a son of promise.
[1:38:15] And then Apostle Paul breaks it down and
[1:38:18] he says the children of God are not the
[1:38:20] children of the of of Isaac after the
[1:38:24] flesh.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; So even though God gave Isaac
[1:38:30] through a natural birth to a woman and a
[1:38:33] man who could not possibly have it
[1:38:35] without a supernatural act.
[1:38:38] But even then it was not the seed that
[1:38:42] should come from Isaac. say, "Oh, now we
[1:38:44] have Isaac and Isaac takes a wife and
[1:38:47] I'm Jacob and he takes a wife and on
[1:38:50] down now we have a holy lineage." No,
[1:38:53] not at all. Because because Apostle Paul
[1:38:56] says clearly, it's not the natural seed.
[1:38:59] All of Israel is not Israel.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; It's not the natural seed. the power
[1:39:05] that God is as the the the the the
[1:39:09] creative power, the the very power that
[1:39:12] would make you sinless,
[1:39:14] the very power that would give you
[1:39:17] eternal life or cause you to know that
[1:39:20] you have eternal life. That very power
[1:39:22] did not lay in a natural seed. It laid
[1:39:25] in a promise.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; And they saw the promises of God a far
[1:39:30] off. They actually saw reality. And
[1:39:33] Abraham saw Isaac, but he looked even
[1:39:37] beyond Isaac.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul now brings this and
[1:39:40] says it's it's not the natural seed.
[1:39:44] It's not the children that are of the
[1:39:46] flesh. That's they're not the seed.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; It's the children of the promise.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; So, so we didn't come by any natural
[1:39:55] lineage from Abraham.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; But we came as a product of a promise.
[1:40:01] We are actually children of
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your name is
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; or where you came from
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; or what your background is or what your
[1:40:11] heritage is. I I have no interest in
[1:40:14] that and you should have very little
[1:40:16] interest in it. It's not your roots,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; natural roots that's important.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; It's the fact that God uttered a word
[1:40:25] and he gave a promise.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; He he he promised himself. Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; He He said it in his word that he would
[1:40:32] have a people in this end time that
[1:40:35] would actually believe the promise. They
[1:40:37] have to believe the promise because they
[1:40:39] came out of the promise.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have anybody convince me
[1:40:45] who my father is and my mother. I came
[1:40:49] from them. I am of my father's natural
[1:40:52] seed and I came out of the womb of my
[1:40:55] mother and nobody has to give me uh you
[1:40:58] know some kind of studies you don't have
[1:41:01] to give me a book about it I just know
[1:41:03] that because I came from them and and I
[1:41:06] oh no other things I have traits that I
[1:41:09] saw in my father when I was a boy I saw
[1:41:11] certain traits that my father did and
[1:41:14] here I find out these many years later
[1:41:16] I'm doing exactly the same thing put my
[1:41:18] finger to my face exactly like my father
[1:41:20] did. Swallow just like my father did. Or
[1:41:24] stand sit at the table and and and and
[1:41:27] my wife says, "Well, you know, you you
[1:41:30] play with your knife and fork and
[1:41:31] things. That's just what your dad used
[1:41:33] to do." Well, so I don't need a that's
[1:41:36] not a revelation to me. He did it. I do
[1:41:38] it. So So So
[1:41:42] that's the thing. But on the other hand,
[1:41:45] now that's that's the temporal. He's in
[1:41:48] a grave someplace in Saskatchewan. My
[1:41:50] mother's in a grave in northern
[1:41:52] Saskatchewan. And and and so but I look
[1:41:54] beyond that. I I can look over the
[1:41:57] tombstone.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; We look beyond that.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That was a temporal. And these are
[1:42:02] natural traits
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; of this body that's going to pass. But I
[1:42:05] have a heavenly father
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; who has spoken a word.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; He's given a promise. Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; I know that my dad desired, he prayed
[1:42:14] that, you know, perhaps I would be in
[1:42:16] the ministry or do something and he
[1:42:18] thought maybe that I would, you know, go
[1:42:21] to school and get some advanced
[1:42:22] education, maybe be a doctor or be a
[1:42:25] lawyer or something. He he just desired
[1:42:26] that naturally because he never had the
[1:42:28] opportunity of that kind of an
[1:42:30] education. And unfortunately, I didn't
[1:42:32] have that kind of an opportunity either.
[1:42:34] I would have loved to gone on to further
[1:42:36] studies. I didn't have that kind of
[1:42:38] opportunity. But we have to look beyond
[1:42:40] that. Because the thing is the direction
[1:42:42] in your life is not dictated by what you
[1:42:46] have learned in this life. What you have
[1:42:48] studied in this life or the
[1:42:49] opportunities that have come to you in
[1:42:51] this passing life. Your your your future
[1:42:54] is in the call of God.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; What has God called you to do?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Even if God said, "Well, God's only
[1:43:02] called me. I'm just a farmer. I'm just a
[1:43:04] I'm just a housewife. I'm that." As long
[1:43:06] as we are in the call of God,
[1:43:11] I said, "God, help me."
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says, "And God said
[1:43:16] to Abraham, let it not be grievous,
[1:43:19] because for in Isaac shall thy seed be
[1:43:23] called in the promise. In Isaac, your
[1:43:26] seed will be called in Isaac." And
[1:43:30] Apostle Paul then tells us
[1:43:33] and then this call, let me just stop
[1:43:35] here for a moment because I'm feeling a
[1:43:37] little pressed for time. But th this
[1:43:39] call is a it's a summons.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, it's like being accosted.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul was he was apprehended. He
[1:43:52] uses the word.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; He was literally apprehended on the way
[1:43:55] to Damascus. He was on his he he had his
[1:43:59] own duty. He had his own mandate. He had
[1:44:01] his own commission. I'm going here. I've
[1:44:03] studied for this. I've studied at the
[1:44:06] feet of Ga. I've been under the
[1:44:08] greatest.
[1:44:09] These people are heretics. They're
[1:44:11] opposed to the law, which I am a I'm of
[1:44:15] the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a I I'm a
[1:44:18] Hebrew of the Hebrews.
[1:44:21] Uh I've been a Pharisee. I'm a Pharisee.
[1:44:24] That's what he said he was. He was all
[1:44:27] of these things and now he's on a
[1:44:29] mission
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and God apprehends him.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Literally accosts him.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't care whether
[1:44:38] you've been born
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; born in this church or born in a
[1:44:41] believer's family. There needs to come a
[1:44:43] time when God literally arrests you
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; and you realize you have now become a
[1:44:50] prisoner.
[1:44:51] Not to your own ideas, your own
[1:44:53] thoughts, your own opinion, but you
[1:44:55] become a you become a prisoner to the
[1:44:57] promise of this hour.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; To the promise.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; One of the things that has been a
[1:45:05] disappointment to me, you say, "Well,
[1:45:07] have you been disappointed?" Yes, I've
[1:45:08] been disappointed. I find it there's
[1:45:10] there are people that I encounter in the
[1:45:13] message and and and their strongest
[1:45:15] opinion or their strongest conviction or
[1:45:18] their mission in earth can't be found in
[1:45:22] the message.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; That is a disappointment.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Say you got such a marvelous word.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; You've got such an incredible evidence
[1:45:33] that the Holy Spirit has been sent to
[1:45:35] guide you. And and we have this
[1:45:39] a abundance that's been given to us and
[1:45:42] then we get focused in on something that
[1:45:44] is entirely something that's in the
[1:45:47] visible world. Something that consumes
[1:45:50] us, eats us out, just gnaws at us, and
[1:45:55] it's all in this temporal world.
[1:45:58] And I turn around say they're wasting
[1:46:00] their time.
[1:46:02] I feel bad they're wasting their time
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; because it's I'm not talking about
[1:46:08] working because that can be a spiritual
[1:46:10] thing
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; but we get consumed
[1:46:14] people have uh uh say friends I' I've
[1:46:17] come I've had a lot of meetings in the
[1:46:19] last even in the last year
[1:46:22] and I found that people become
[1:46:24] absolutely consumed with something that
[1:46:27] they cannot find in the word of God it's
[1:46:29] not in the scripture but they become
[1:46:31] just consumed with that I say we need to
[1:46:35] don't be touched by that
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; for in Isaac
[1:46:42] for in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:46:46] in other words God summons he doesn't
[1:46:50] only invite you but he commisss a person
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be as strong as I possibly
[1:46:57] can because I don't intend to come back
[1:46:58] to this
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; this congregation ation.
[1:47:03] I feel that we have a mission.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I feel that we have been accosted. We
[1:47:10] have been arrested by Almighty God.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You've heard me perhaps approach these
[1:47:15] things before. This is not just a a
[1:47:18] brother Biscll,
[1:47:20] but I believe that God has raised up
[1:47:22] this work and has raised up whatever
[1:47:26] people have come to this work to provide
[1:47:29] in some way contribute by your presence,
[1:47:32] by your prayers, by your giving, by
[1:47:36] being a part of the body of Christ,
[1:47:38] being part of this unit of the body of
[1:47:40] Christ. And if there's any
[1:47:43] identification mark that that that
[1:47:46] should come to this group of people that
[1:47:48] gathers here, I believe that God has
[1:47:50] raised us up
[1:47:53] to send forth this word
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; to places that otherwise it would never
[1:47:58] reach.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Furthermore, I'm obsessed. I'm
[1:48:03] absolutely possessed of that. And I
[1:48:06] believe that that possession is a Holy
[1:48:08] Ghost possession. Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm commissioned by God. I
[1:48:12] believe that you are likewise
[1:48:14] commissioned by God. And we are not to
[1:48:19] uh use up our energies and use up our
[1:48:22] mental resources and use up all of our
[1:48:25] resources for things that are of
[1:48:27] nothing.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; They're not.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And once again, I'm not speaking of your
[1:48:33] your job or the tasks that we have to do
[1:48:36] from day to day. But you know it's
[1:48:38] really amazing.
[1:48:40] It is really amazing. You'll find out.
[1:48:44] And one of the things that people are
[1:48:46] finding out even in what we call this
[1:48:48] meltdown,
[1:48:50] you know, it's brought a lot of
[1:48:51] difficulties. I thank God for it.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I actually thank God for it. It's good
[1:48:56] when all the some of the leaves got
[1:48:58] shook out of the trees.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; It's good when we find out you can do
[1:49:02] with less.
[1:49:04] It's good when you find out you don't
[1:49:06] have to go
[1:49:08] to McDonald's every day.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to Starbucks every
[1:49:12] day.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; It's good when you find out you can
[1:49:15] actually live on less.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Some of you are smiling.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Some are not.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. It could even get a lot
[1:49:25] worse.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; God never spared his people even of
[1:49:30] famine. In the New Testament of the book
[1:49:32] of Acts, the people sent from one place
[1:49:34] to another, even by the apostles, by the
[1:49:37] hands of the apostles for those that
[1:49:39] were in famine.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; The bottom could drop out.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; We could be very much depending on one
[1:49:47] another. Oh, we're not there yet, but we
[1:49:50] could be. Am I predicting it? Not at
[1:49:53] all. I I wouldn't be so foolish as
[1:49:55] predict anything. You might come to the
[1:49:57] rosiest time and things might go roaring
[1:50:01] uh you know the economy roaring again.
[1:50:04] It could do that. You'll have a greater
[1:50:06] challenge then to control your spiritual
[1:50:09] walk
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; at that time than you do even at this
[1:50:13] time. And that's why I said that we
[1:50:16] showed the pictures and I said I think
[1:50:18] last week and the week before uh we see
[1:50:21] the pictures of this group of people
[1:50:23] that brother Murphy told us of these
[1:50:25] sisters and and just to take this moment
[1:50:28] 99% are elderly sisters. They're
[1:50:31] retired. They're living on uh $100 a
[1:50:35] month and barely have enough. and and
[1:50:37] they scraped enough money between them
[1:50:40] to send $2,000 down to the brothers that
[1:50:44] were having the uh meetings and they
[1:50:46] said, "We want to have a part." Brother
[1:50:48] Murphy said, "I don't even know how they
[1:50:50] could gather that much. I don't even
[1:50:51] know how they could give that much and
[1:50:53] they hardly have enough to live on." But
[1:50:55] when we see something like that, you
[1:50:57] know, and I've seen people in very, very
[1:50:59] poor places and there's something in
[1:51:01] your heart that
[1:51:03] you know that craves that kind of
[1:51:05] simplicity.
[1:51:09] And I find something about those people
[1:51:12] that they also have a simple faith.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, God said it."
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And if he said it, well,
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; then we can expect it.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm right at the crux
[1:51:34] of one of my hungers.
[1:51:36] says, "Oh God,
[1:51:42] I would prefer that you remove
[1:51:45] all these things that are like
[1:51:49] crutches
[1:51:51] and make us dependent upon other things
[1:51:54] and ourselves and so on and so forth."
[1:51:57] And I would like to just have the Holy
[1:52:00] Spirit.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; I would like such a simple faith. And
[1:52:04] I'm convicted, friends. I'm convicted.
[1:52:06] I've been reading as I've been studying
[1:52:08] for this message. And Brother Brandham
[1:52:10] says it very, very clear. I'm convicted
[1:52:13] because we have things right here
[1:52:16] and we can speak about it. I don't want
[1:52:18] to just speak about it. I want to be
[1:52:20] able to say it. I want to be able to
[1:52:22] declare I believe that.
[1:52:25] I want to be able to declare I believe
[1:52:27] that by seeing, not because, you know, I
[1:52:30] got something within myself this isn't
[1:52:31] right and it's got to be made right or
[1:52:33] that, you know, my I think of Ella Joy
[1:52:36] all the time.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; There's no reason in the world why that
[1:52:40] girl should not walk perfectly.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; That's just myself. I'm I'm now I'm
[1:52:45] speaking about personal. I said I would
[1:52:46] get personal
[1:52:48] and I don't see any reason in the world
[1:52:49] why that little girl should not walk
[1:52:51] perfectly.
[1:52:58] My challenge is to be able to look at
[1:52:59] the promise.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; That might be a far off. And I'm not
[1:53:04] talking about timewise. I'm talking
[1:53:06] might it might seem so far. It might
[1:53:08] seem so impossible.
[1:53:10] But I read where this messenger, this
[1:53:12] prophet so simply stated time after time
[1:53:16] after time and he says it so simply,
[1:53:19] it's the simplicity that convicts me.
[1:53:22] and faith somehow reaches out.
[1:53:26] One of the things that happens when
[1:53:28] difficult times come is people can
[1:53:30] become a little more desperate.
[1:53:38] I'm just going to digress for a moment.
[1:53:44] Brother Nathan, Sister Karen, I'm going
[1:53:46] to use your testimony.
[1:53:51] We have a family here,
[1:53:54] Brother Nathan and Sister Karen
[1:53:56] Hildebrandt.
[1:53:58] And after I spoke last Sunday
[1:54:01] on the realities of God and how it's in
[1:54:05] that other realm and that other
[1:54:06] dimension,
[1:54:08] she felt to send this to me.
[1:54:11] Before they moved here, they were in
[1:54:13] Saskatchewan and they went up to
[1:54:14] northern Saskatchewan for
[1:54:16] uh to spend a day at the lake with some
[1:54:19] other people.
[1:54:21] And uh they were just getting ready now
[1:54:25] to leave and they had the little trailer
[1:54:26] hooked up to their car and everything
[1:54:28] was packed and they were just getting
[1:54:29] ready to leave. And it was a very very
[1:54:31] hot day.
[1:54:33] And so brother Nathan said, "Well,
[1:54:37] uh you know, and the other families with
[1:54:39] him, we'll just go and you know, splash
[1:54:41] in the water a wee bit." What they
[1:54:44] didn't know is that this lake had a had
[1:54:46] a cliff and a drop off dropped off like
[1:54:49] this.
[1:54:50] And none of these people were swimmers.
[1:54:53] I think I'm saying it correct.
[1:54:57] And they said they mostly just wanted to
[1:54:59] wait out in the cool to cool off. And
[1:55:02] none of us were aware that the bottom
[1:55:05] dropped off at a certain point.
[1:55:09] And brother Nathan with uh another boy
[1:55:12] was in the water
[1:55:15] and they were just splashing around and
[1:55:17] so on so forth.
[1:55:19] and uh dropped off this edge.
[1:55:24] And the boy began to panic and and uh
[1:55:29] get into trouble and is trying to climb
[1:55:32] on top of Nathan.
[1:55:35] And the other brother that was on the
[1:55:37] lake shore, he he thought they're just
[1:55:38] having fun.
[1:55:42] And in the meantime,
[1:55:45] uh,
[1:55:48] Brother Nathan sunk to the bottom
[1:55:56] and he started climbing on top of
[1:55:58] Brother Nathan in his panic. And Nathan
[1:56:01] kept going down and then he just didn't
[1:56:04] come back up after a while.
[1:56:09] And Sister Karen began to scream
[1:56:14] and uh the boy was staying still above
[1:56:17] the water kind of dog paddling
[1:56:21] and uh was struggling to stay up as
[1:56:23] well.
[1:56:25] And the brother started heading in our
[1:56:27] direction. He had an inner tube, but the
[1:56:30] inner tube was had a hole in it. Wasn't
[1:56:33] holding air very well.
[1:56:35] and he yelled at me to get out of the
[1:56:37] water and go for help to Sister Krenn.
[1:56:41] She said it was a fair ways to the shore
[1:56:43] of the camp where there was a camp area
[1:56:48] including a long boardwalk built across
[1:56:51] a swampy area
[1:56:54] and uh I'm just a bridging this a wee
[1:56:58] bit. It says I got to the top of the
[1:56:59] hill where the truck was parked and I
[1:57:02] couldn't go any further. She was running
[1:57:05] and it was like I couldn't move once I
[1:57:08] got there and I started screaming for
[1:57:10] someone to help.
[1:57:12] I began to cry to God
[1:57:16] asking him to help us save my husband.
[1:57:21] And in the meantime, the brother had
[1:57:23] taken the tube and went down to look for
[1:57:25] Nathan.
[1:57:27] and he pulled him out using the inner
[1:57:30] tube
[1:57:32] and to to bring him to carry him to
[1:57:34] shore
[1:57:36] and then he tried mouth-to-mouth
[1:57:38] resuscitation
[1:57:40] and was unsuccessful in reviving Nathan.
[1:57:45] He then had to leave Nathan to go and
[1:57:50] pull Christopher because he was losing
[1:57:53] the battle to stay up.
[1:57:58] And as he was going out for Chris, he
[1:58:01] made up his mind that he would pray for
[1:58:04] Nathan upon his return to shore.
[1:58:08] In the meantime,
[1:58:10] Sister Karen is up at the truck and she
[1:58:13] says, "Something happened
[1:58:15] and it was like I broke into another
[1:58:18] dimension or something. I was in another
[1:58:21] place and I was standing and it was like
[1:58:24] I was in a vortex,
[1:58:28] a heavenly vortex." These are her words.
[1:58:32] And all around me, word was swirling.
[1:58:35] And I could hear the word being spoken
[1:58:39] and it was a voice saying, "I am he.
[1:58:45] Do not fear.
[1:58:47] Only believe all things are possible."
[1:58:51] And she said, "I screamed out, Father,
[1:58:55] my husband, save him. Then more only
[1:58:59] believe. All things are possible." And I
[1:59:03] said, 'Lord,
[1:59:05] this is a reality.
[1:59:08] Pick him and me too. This is the
[1:59:11] reality. Lord, take us, Lord. And then a
[1:59:16] voice came back saying, "It is not yet
[1:59:19] his time. Only believe. All things are
[1:59:24] possible." And I and I screamed, "Yes,
[1:59:27] Lord, I believe. I believe." And at the
[1:59:32] same instant that I screamed this out, I
[1:59:34] was backstanding
[1:59:36] by the truck and could hear the brother
[1:59:39] who was by this time on his way back to
[1:59:42] Nathan. And he could see him begin to
[1:59:45] move. And he screamed out praise to God
[1:59:49] for giving back Nathan his life.
[1:59:52] And they took brother Nathan to a
[1:59:54] hospital.
[1:59:57] And the doctor said somehow his lungs
[2:00:01] collapsed and didn't allow any water in
[2:00:04] his lungs
[2:00:06] and there was no water in his lungs.
[2:00:09] I say that God
[2:00:12] and Sister Corin felt to send this to me
[2:00:14] just after the service as I was trying
[2:00:16] to convey to this congregation. There is
[2:00:19] another land. There's another dimension.
[2:00:22] It's closer to you than you can imagine.
[2:00:25] Yeah.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Even if you let your mind loose right
[2:00:28] now, you cannot imagine how close it is.
[2:00:31] Faith is nye. Even in thy mouth.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, I believe.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; This is reality. Take us. Take us."
[2:00:40] Didn't want to come back. Take us. This
[2:00:43] is what's real.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, just one breath
[2:00:47] away is reality.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Just one breath away. And a prophet of
[2:00:51] God is saying to us, young and old,
[2:00:54] don't look at these natural things. You
[2:00:56] hear this pain and sorrow and cursing
[2:00:59] and all of these things which is that's
[2:01:01] of this world.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; We have a high calling. Believers,
[2:01:06] friends, we have a high calling.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; I thought I would look and see what the
[2:01:11] prophet of God I was interested in
[2:01:13] knowing what was his purpose in life.
[2:01:17] You know, one of the things he repeats
[2:01:18] over again, he said, "My purpose,"
[2:01:20] because I decided before I even would
[2:01:23] read it, I would give myself to the same
[2:01:26] purpose. He said, "My purpose in life is
[2:01:30] to stand between the brethren."
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And bring unity amongst them.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen to God."
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; If that was his purpose, that can be my
[2:01:41] purpose as well.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. not give myself to these little
[2:01:46] dissensions and little things and
[2:01:48] insidious things that can be said that
[2:01:51] only divide people rather than unite
[2:01:54] them.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, you got
[2:01:57] a challenge before almighty God that we
[2:01:59] must not look at these things that are
[2:02:01] temporal and passing.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Oh, I have an ulterior
[2:02:06] motive." I forgive you for that.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I don't have an ulterior motive. I say
[2:02:12] that's what this congregation needs to
[2:02:14] needs to believe and needs to practice.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; You need to practice it.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; There's no end, absolutely no end of
[2:02:23] gossip. There's no end of tailbearing.
[2:02:26] There's no end of what you can point the
[2:02:28] finger at at one another unless you make
[2:02:31] an end of it
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; by saying, "I don't see those things.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to look at the eternal."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; What do you see? I see a perfect place.
[2:02:41] I see a perfect people.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; And I believe that man, that woman is a
[2:02:45] son and daughter of God.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; That's what I see.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; You want to find fault,
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; you're in the right place.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; You want to find fault, you'll go no
[2:03:09] place. That's right. That's right.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Until you and I learn that we must look
[2:03:16] beyond
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; this. We must look to that which is
[2:03:21] eternal.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; We must look to the unseen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Because the whole Bible from one from
[2:03:26] Genesis through to Revelation is of
[2:03:29] people. The whole book of Revelation
[2:03:31] isn't anything that was temporal.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; The Apostle John didn't see that which
[2:03:37] was temporal. The whole book. Amen.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "That's our book."
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; And we take these things too lightly. We
[2:03:52] take these things. Oh, that's what the
[2:03:54] Apostle Paul said. Oh, yeah. While we
[2:03:56] look at the things, well, I but I live
[2:03:57] in a different life and I have I'm in a
[2:03:59] different age and I'm Yeah, we sure are
[2:04:01] in a different age. But we need it more
[2:04:04] than even they did.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've got more enticements.
[2:04:10] We've got more temptations. That's
[2:04:12] Satan. This is Satan's Eden.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; And he has developed it
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; to the ultimate degree.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And I say friends, we need by God's
[2:04:21] power to cut that down
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; in every life and give ourselves to what
[2:04:27] the word of God has promised.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And I have a promise of this age.
[2:04:33] And I just decided I would see what what
[2:04:36] the purpose of God. in brother
[2:04:37] Brandham's life was
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; and he said you know he said this he got
[2:04:42] down he said
[2:04:44] he was in he was a Baptist
[2:04:47] and then out of that and then the
[2:04:48] Presbyterians offered him something
[2:04:50] offered him the moon
[2:04:53] and different groups and I lived in that
[2:04:55] time when they were offering him things
[2:04:59] and some of the others that raised into
[2:05:00] great ministries at that time they caved
[2:05:03] into it
[2:05:05] and they went the way of prosperity and
[2:05:09] big things.
[2:05:11] But brother Vanom, he turned it down and
[2:05:14] turned it down. Then he says,
[2:05:17] "Then I found myself among the
[2:05:19] Pentecostal people."
[2:05:22] And he said, "They were despised people.
[2:05:25] They were called holy rulers
[2:05:28] and they had all kinds of nasty names
[2:05:31] for them."
[2:05:34] and he was preaching on Moses and he
[2:05:36] said this.
[2:05:38] Moses didn't merely become a sympathizer
[2:05:43] saying, "Well, I feel sorry for the
[2:05:45] Hebrews and they're out there and so on
[2:05:46] and so forth and I believe they're right
[2:05:48] and I believe they're God's people." No.
[2:05:50] He said he went out and became one of
[2:05:52] them.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when I saw the Pentecostal
[2:05:56] people," he said, I decided that I would
[2:05:58] become I wouldn't just be a sympathizer.
[2:06:00] I would go out and become one of them.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:04] So he took this marvelous gift and he
[2:06:06] took this incredible calling that he
[2:06:08] had. He knew he knew he was called to be
[2:06:13] the messenger, the second coming of
[2:06:15] Jesus Christ. And I will call I will go
[2:06:17] out and be a part of them. And he came
[2:06:19] out and was a part of them. And then he
[2:06:21] said, I found that they were as broken
[2:06:24] up
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; as the others.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; And I decided to stand in the middle.
[2:06:30] Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; I decided to stand and bridge the gap.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; I decided to give myself to uniting the
[2:06:39] brethren together.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; And whatever you think and whatever you
[2:06:44] you you can be given over to your own
[2:06:46] decision, but I've dedicated myself to
[2:06:49] that long time ago. And and I'm
[2:06:52] personally I am absolutely
[2:06:55] unmovable, unshakable. I'm too far down
[2:06:57] the road to be moved. this message as
[2:07:00] far as we can thrust it. That's what I
[2:07:02] intend to do.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I don't intend to get caught up with my
[2:07:06] own little world or or my own little
[2:07:08] ministry or some other little thing. I'm
[2:07:10] going to get this message out. I don't
[2:07:12] have some little uh subject to promote
[2:07:15] or something. I want to get the message
[2:07:17] out to people. I want to be able to walk
[2:07:19] up on other side and we are going to be
[2:07:21] there just like we're here even more
[2:07:23] real than we are here. And I want to be
[2:07:24] able to take people's hands. I want to
[2:07:26] be able to embrace them. And I would
[2:07:28] like, if God would grant us, I say, "Oh,
[2:07:31] God, grant me the opportunity to get
[2:07:34] this word into more hands and more
[2:07:36] people, I'd like to see whatever color,
[2:07:39] whatever race, I'd like them to be able
[2:07:41] to read a message book and have it touch
[2:07:43] their heart like it touches mine."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't give me any joy. I read I
[2:07:49] read and studied this week and oh, how
[2:07:51] wonderful some of these things are. And
[2:07:53] it opens up the scriptures. It makes the
[2:07:55] scriptures alive. And I begin to read,
[2:07:58] "In Isaac, in Isaac shall I see be
[2:08:01] called." And I realized I'd been called.
[2:08:04] A promise from God, right? The very
[2:08:08] essence of that that very promise, there
[2:08:10] was a voice that ran out and arrested me
[2:08:13] someplace.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And it went out and arrested you when
[2:08:18] you least expected it.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; And God obligated us. We've received
[2:08:24] much and we have to much has been given.
[2:08:26] We must give much.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we're doing everything that
[2:08:30] we can to get the message or get a place
[2:08:32] from where the message can spread. Even
[2:08:34] in Moscow, wherever it is, that sounds
[2:08:37] like old. I hope that doesn't sound like
[2:08:40] old humrum to you. I'm glad for every
[2:08:42] breth, and you'll hear probably more
[2:08:44] tonight. I'm glad that God has allowed
[2:08:47] ministers, young ministers to raise up
[2:08:49] out of this message
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; and send them out from this place.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:56] Hallelujah.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; And if people look to this place or look
[2:09:00] to you, you should be thankful for that.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; I think God's given us a great
[2:09:08] privilege.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; He's given us a highest honor.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want I wouldn't want to just
[2:09:15] be enclosed in a little group, us four,
[2:09:18] no more. and we just no matter what we
[2:09:21] say and how we rejoice in it, it
[2:09:23] wouldn't do me any I wouldn't have the
[2:09:25] satisfaction. That's just me. I wouldn't
[2:09:27] have the satisfaction. I don't want to
[2:09:29] sit at the marriage table.
[2:09:34] And if someone look across and said,
[2:09:38] "You could have sent it to me.
[2:09:42] You had the you had the wherewithal to
[2:09:44] get it to me."
[2:09:47] And God did it anyway.
[2:09:51] I don't know how this is going to work,
[2:09:54] but the scripture says, "Don't let any
[2:09:55] man take your crown." Don't let any man
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; take your crown.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; There's rewards.
[2:10:09] And a prophet of God said, "There's too
[2:10:11] little said about the rewards."
[2:10:14] There's a reward for you.
[2:10:18] friends. I don't I I really don't care
[2:10:21] how it goes out. You may wonder why
[2:10:25] perhaps why we do certain things.
[2:10:28] Not long ago, brother John Brother John
[2:10:31] Stall senior
[2:10:33] took four of his grandchildren
[2:10:37] went back to the colonies.
[2:10:42] And maybe some of you from the colonies,
[2:10:44] you have your opinion about that. And
[2:10:45] that's fine. I I'm here. This is this is
[2:10:48] my my place to be able to say say, "Why
[2:10:51] did I do that?
[2:10:54] Why' I assist? Why would we assist as a
[2:10:57] church to send them back there?
[2:11:00] I just think it's just that important
[2:11:03] that somebody who's bound and crying
[2:11:08] finding is there something real.
[2:11:11] Even if that young person doesn't say a
[2:11:13] thing that they can look into the face
[2:11:14] of somebody say they're different.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; That's a different kind of a young man,
[2:11:19] different kind of a young lady. What
[2:11:21] makes them like that?
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what. It's not just a
[2:11:26] long dress that makes them. is not the
[2:11:27] polka dots that make them. It's not some
[2:11:29] man's doctrine that makes them. It is
[2:11:32] something that from the unseen realm,
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; they have been arrested.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; At some point in their life, they became
[2:11:38] arrested.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; You young men and young women, I declare
[2:11:42] to you, you have a tremendous
[2:11:44] responsibility. If time goes on, I may
[2:11:46] not be here. Some of these other
[2:11:47] brothers may not be here. Who's going to
[2:11:49] rise up?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Who's going to give themselves to this
[2:11:52] unseen realm?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; This unseen realm. Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see it?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; And the unseen. I I have to speak from
[2:12:05] memory now. And my memor is not that
[2:12:07] good. But brother Brandham comes in that
[2:12:09] message looking at the unseen.
[2:12:12] And this catches me. He says, "But I
[2:12:15] see." Said, "Oh God, I want to see what
[2:12:19] he saw."
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see a church."
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:25] He saw a church rising.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; He saw a millennium.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; He saw a perfect church.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And with all that chaos that was going
[2:12:36] on and all that confusion and all that
[2:12:38] ridicule and all that criticism and he
[2:12:40] was waiting his way through, but he
[2:12:42] wasn't looking at that.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, he could have filled
[2:12:45] books. He could have filled many more
[2:12:47] books in his messages. He could have
[2:12:49] filled them on all of the troubles and
[2:12:51] the things and the people that came
[2:12:53] against him. He could have filled books
[2:12:54] on it. He ignored it.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And he looked to see a church. He looked
[2:12:59] to see a people.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Many of these brethren are
[2:13:02] not here now. They've gone."
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I saw them
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; over there."
[2:13:09] [Music]
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; I hope he saw me.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; I hope he saw me.
[2:13:27] See, I'm not just preaching, friends.
[2:13:30] I'm done. I've got to quit.
[2:13:33] I'm too burdened.
[2:13:36] I'm so burdened.
[2:13:40] People wonder why you go away.
[2:13:43] Why do you go and have these meetings?
[2:13:46] Because what I can never never tell you
[2:13:49] this influence and I happen to know this
[2:13:51] influence blew through and this doctrine
[2:13:53] blew through and that thing this
[2:13:55] hardship blew through and this thing
[2:13:57] blew through.
[2:14:04] People are hurt.
[2:14:06] People are wounded.
[2:14:09] People are discouraged.
[2:14:11] And I just think if I can just do
[2:14:14] something,
[2:14:16] maybe I can just pour some oil.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe we can do something
[2:14:25] to pull them together.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that even in this
[2:14:30] last 12 months, we've seen some
[2:14:33] astounding
[2:14:35] victories.
[2:14:37] Hallelujah.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; And I say to those that, you know,
[2:14:40] sometimes come along with me, I say, you
[2:14:43] know what's the saddest thing? I can't
[2:14:45] tell the church this. I can't it can't
[2:14:48] go out to the world. I just can't go
[2:14:49] everywhere. I can't tell I can't tell
[2:14:52] the congregation that the most glorious
[2:14:54] things not able to tell them. All I can
[2:14:57] just tell you in a veiled way,
[2:15:00] incredible things.
[2:15:04] people who haven't fellowshipped
[2:15:06] together for years.
[2:15:10] Coming together, not just coming
[2:15:13] together suspiciously, coming together
[2:15:15] and rejoicing,
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; coming together and hugging one another.
[2:15:18] Come together. Isn't this worth it?
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Say, hallelujah.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Want to be doing that to the last moment
[2:15:31] that we possibly can.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:35] And I'm doing everything I can. I want
[2:15:37] to say to this congregation, I trust
[2:15:39] that you'll do everything that you can
[2:15:42] to look to the unseen. Don't fret. Don't
[2:15:44] worry. Don't stress. Don't be overly
[2:15:47] anxious. Just say, "Lord, I'm here. What
[2:15:51] I heard this morning, I want to I I want
[2:15:54] to do my part. I want to be part of
[2:15:57] that." It might be the person that's
[2:15:59] sitting next to you. It might be another
[2:16:01] family. How no Who who knows how God
[2:16:06] keeps track of things? God's depending
[2:16:09] on you.
[2:16:11] Oh, I just want to bear my heart so
[2:16:13] much.
[2:16:15] There's a lot of people in sitting in
[2:16:17] this congregation.
[2:16:21] You You just don't know who you're
[2:16:24] affecting. And I trust you'll affect
[2:16:26] them positively.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll close with this.
[2:16:34] There's one person, I'm sorry. I think
[2:16:37] Sister Lan, I just had to leave.
[2:16:42] But I know she's a sister that prays.
[2:16:45] I know she's a sister that's burdened.
[2:16:50] My wife and I have lived here
[2:16:56] for almost
[2:16:59] over 40 years, I guess.
[2:17:03] We've never gone down into Vancouver and
[2:17:05] just get a hotel and stay overnight.
[2:17:11] My wife was a little nervous. She says,
[2:17:13] "We got all these points with British
[2:17:15] Airways. We're going to lose them.
[2:17:18] Unless we fly someplace, we got to we
[2:17:20] got to activate it and then it'll be
[2:17:21] good for another year."
[2:17:24] Says, "Or the only other thing we can do
[2:17:26] is go and stay at a hotel."
[2:17:29] So I said, "Okay,
[2:17:31] let's do it."
[2:17:36] So they gave me a nice hotel and they
[2:17:39] gave it real cheap and they and then
[2:17:41] they said, "And this will include your
[2:17:42] full breakfast as well." Well, it's
[2:17:44] getting better all the time. And when we
[2:17:46] got there, they gave us a uh gave us a
[2:17:49] coupon says 25% off your for your dinner
[2:17:51] tonight. And I said, "This is getting
[2:17:52] better all the time. Maybe if I stand
[2:17:54] here long enough, I might get this whole
[2:17:56] thing free."
[2:17:58] And uh and I said, "Well, you know, one
[2:18:01] thing, my wife's been wanting a pair of
[2:18:03] needing a pair of sunglasses. She
[2:18:04] doesn't know it, but I she has a pair,
[2:18:06] but I said, "They're no good, and I want
[2:18:08] you to get another pair of sunglasses."
[2:18:09] So, we're going to look. So, here we
[2:18:11] are. And I thought, "Oh, there's, you
[2:18:13] know, there's frame." You don't mind me
[2:18:14] telling this? I said, "There's frame
[2:18:17] places all over the place." You know, I
[2:18:19] I we'll go here to Pacific Center. We'll
[2:18:21] go down there. So, anyway, we go into
[2:18:23] the mall where we're at, and there's no
[2:18:25] there's no glass place there. Okay,
[2:18:27] let's get out of here. We go down the
[2:18:29] street cuz I want to get back first
[2:18:31] Saturday, you know, I give over to my
[2:18:32] studies. And this was first thing in the
[2:18:34] morning after breakfast. And so we we go
[2:18:36] over to Pacific Center. And I mean, you
[2:18:38] know, this is hundreds of stores there.
[2:18:42] So we're walking down Pacific Center. We
[2:18:43] go to one of these things that tell you
[2:18:45] what's all in there. There's only two
[2:18:47] only two places that sell glasses.
[2:18:49] Wow. My goodness. Okay. So we go into
[2:18:52] the first one. They said, "We don't sell
[2:18:54] prescription glasses. we only sell
[2:18:56] sunglasses. I said, "No, it's no good.
[2:18:58] My wife needs a prescription." So, he
[2:19:00] says, "Well, just across just across the
[2:19:02] lake, just across the alleyway here.
[2:19:05] Store's on the other side." So, we just
[2:19:07] walk over there, walk in the store, one
[2:19:09] one girl standing there.
[2:19:11] So, we walk up and she's real nice. And
[2:19:13] then she got busy with somebody else and
[2:19:15] we waited and then so she starts to show
[2:19:18] us and works with my wife and everything
[2:19:19] else. And we're all we're there about a
[2:19:21] half an hour and we're we're all done.
[2:19:24] So I said, "Do you have a card? We'll
[2:19:27] have to tell you what our my my wife's
[2:19:29] prescription is." "Oh yeah, here here it
[2:19:31] is. Right here." Hands me a card. And I
[2:19:35] could see it was Italian.
[2:19:38] So I was just going to tell her we were
[2:19:39] in Italy not long ago, but before I got
[2:19:41] to that, I I tried to pronounce her
[2:19:44] first name. I said, "Is that am I
[2:19:46] pronouncing it right?" "Yeah."
[2:19:48] And my wife says, "You wouldn't be
[2:19:50] Lana's sister, would you?"
[2:19:53] "Yeah." She said, "I'm Who are you?" I
[2:19:56] says, "I'm her pastor." "Pastor Ed, you
[2:19:59] brother Ed, reach across and and you're
[2:20:02] Ruth?" "Yes." "Yeah." So, we say, "Oh,
[2:20:05] that was a nice accident. I don't think
[2:20:07] it was an accident." It brought a whole
[2:20:09] flood of things. We're able to talk
[2:20:10] about her mother in the hospital and all
[2:20:12] these things. And and I haven't even had
[2:20:13] a chance to tell Sister Lana yet. I know
[2:20:15] that Lana has prayed for her sister. And
[2:20:18] here once again once in 40 years you go
[2:20:22] down you stay in a certain place and you
[2:20:24] walk into the second store and talk to
[2:20:27] one of our sister sister in the flesh
[2:20:30] and it all comes back again the whole
[2:20:31] flood
[2:20:33] sraise
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; we don't even know
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; you say who guided our footsteps the
[2:20:39] holy spirit guided our footsteps that's
[2:20:41] how that's who's guiding you
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; don't even know it but he the same
[2:20:46] sovereignty is guiding your footsteps.
[2:20:48] Hallelujah to God.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; we're going to close. Long ways to go,
[2:20:57] but I'm going to close cuz we got
[2:20:58] Brother Murphy tonight and I know he's
[2:21:00] loaded.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get someone like Brother
[2:21:08] Murphy,
[2:21:10] Brother DJ, some of these brothers,
[2:21:11] Brother John, some of his young
[2:21:13] brothers, you don't have to pray that
[2:21:15] they'll get loaded. You have to pray
[2:21:16] they'll be able to get unloaded.
[2:21:24] Pray brother John is making having to
[2:21:26] make a decision right now too. The
[2:21:28] brothers and brother
[2:21:30] Milco just came back from Serbia and
[2:21:33] this is the third year they're having a
[2:21:36] annual meeting there just for the third
[2:21:38] time. I was there the first time and
[2:21:40] some other brothers last year and now
[2:21:42] they've asked for some a couple of
[2:21:44] brothers and brother John to go there
[2:21:46] and that'll be end of August Lord
[2:21:48] willing and he'll be speaking there. So
[2:21:52] we need to we're happy we can
[2:21:55] participate in this. The same thing is
[2:21:57] happening there. Brother John God is
[2:21:59] bringing people are going to come from
[2:22:00] Romania. This has never happened like
[2:22:02] that before. and come from Romania and
[2:22:04] and all different countries, maybe from
[2:22:06] Hungary and different places in there
[2:22:09] and are really looking forward to it.
[2:22:12] Amen. Why don't we stand? Would you
[2:22:14] stand with me, please?
[2:22:23] Brother Rod, I wonder if you can help me
[2:22:24] with the song. I looked for it in the
[2:22:27] book. I couldn't find it. There is an
[2:22:29] unseen hand.
[2:22:32] Do we have it on the screen? Okay.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Before we sing, let's Would you pray
[2:22:37] with me?
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, there were times and
[2:22:44] there are times in every minister's
[2:22:47] life.
[2:22:49] He just bears his heart and the people
[2:22:51] understand. You've given us such
[2:22:53] wonderful, encouraging and understanding
[2:22:56] people. And we do not know, Lord, how
[2:22:59] near we are to our going home, whether
[2:23:03] it's in the next five minutes or the
[2:23:05] next five years or whatever it is, but
[2:23:08] we want to be faithful. And like your
[2:23:10] messenger said, he wished that he had
[2:23:13] so many lives to live and so many more
[2:23:16] years.
[2:23:17] And the people that you've gathered
[2:23:19] here, Lord, some are visitors.
[2:23:21] And I pray that they will understand
[2:23:23] also that they didn't come to visit by
[2:23:26] accident. They came that something might
[2:23:29] touch their hearts as well. Lord, uh the
[2:23:33] people that were gathered today, they
[2:23:35] didn't know what they were going to
[2:23:37] hear. And I didn't know exactly how it
[2:23:39] was going to come out, but I did pray.
[2:23:42] And we had prayer this morning in the
[2:23:44] study, Father. And I felt your presence
[2:23:47] as brother Rod prayed, oh God, that we
[2:23:51] would just utter and say the right
[2:23:53] things. I pray even now that you will
[2:23:55] send Lord, Brother Murphy, to this
[2:23:57] pulpit tonight, if you give us this
[2:24:00] hour, this time together. And I pray,
[2:24:03] Father, wherever this message is being
[2:24:05] declared, give your servants, Father, I
[2:24:09] pray you'll give them supreme control
[2:24:13] and power in the Holy Spirit. And may
[2:24:16] they utter your word. May they declare
[2:24:18] it, Lord. Give this message a mighty
[2:24:20] voice in these last times. Oh God, we're
[2:24:25] not getting caught up just in some
[2:24:28] church order or some format, but we want
[2:24:31] to be caught up with what you're doing.
[2:24:34] Do the exceedingly abundantly above all
[2:24:36] we could ask or think, Lord. And we
[2:24:39] thank you as I gave the testimony of
[2:24:42] Sister Karen and brother Nathan. We're
[2:24:44] thankful, Father, you kept that water
[2:24:47] out of his lungs. We're thankful that he
[2:24:49] can stand here and sing to the glory of
[2:24:51] God. We're thankful that we're not
[2:24:54] talking about a God of history, but
[2:24:56] we're talking about a God of the now.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; What you did yesterday, you'll do today.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Inspire all those that are listening,
[2:25:04] Father, in streaming. And there may be
[2:25:06] needs and sickness and whatever more. I
[2:25:09] pray that you'll send a mighty force and
[2:25:12] power out. And Lord, I pray that your
[2:25:15] people will be much much builded up and
[2:25:18] benefited in Jesus name. Bless us now as
[2:25:22] we come to a close. Amen.
[2:25:27] There is an unseen hand.
[2:25:32] There is
[2:25:34] a
[2:25:37] seed hand to me
[2:25:43] that leads in ways
[2:25:48] I cannot see
[2:25:54] while going through
[2:25:59] this world
[2:26:01] Oh,
[2:26:04] this still messes
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:09] me as I go.
[2:26:16] Trusting to
[2:26:18] [Music]
[2:26:20] the sweet
[2:26:25] that guides me through
[2:26:30] this
[2:26:33] [Applause]
[2:26:36] And so sweet
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:51] the unseen
[2:26:56] this hand has laid.
[2:27:01] through shadows
[2:27:04] dream
[2:27:07] and wildly
[2:27:12] I have no fear
[2:27:17] I don't will lead
[2:27:22] me to thy home
[2:27:27] with sin
[2:27:28] The soul
[2:27:33] can come.
[2:27:37] I'm trusting you.
[2:27:40] [Applause]
[2:27:42] to the unseen
[2:27:45] hand
[2:27:47] that guides me through
[2:27:52] this
[2:27:58] and some sweet
[2:28:06] [Music]
[2:28:08] guided by
[2:28:13] the unseen.
[2:28:18] I want to leave this with you before we
[2:28:21] sing the last verse in chorus.
[2:28:26] When a man once catches that vision of
[2:28:29] the invisible God
[2:28:32] and know that he's always present,
[2:28:37] there is something that stabilizes
[2:28:40] that man's thinking.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; I think that there could be a 100% of us
[2:28:46] say, "God, grant that to me."
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; It stabilizes his actions.
[2:28:57] Say, "Oh God,
[2:29:00] do that for me."
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; And in the time of distress and trouble,
[2:29:08] it'll still make him look upward and
[2:29:10] above the things that are happening
[2:29:14] around him
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; because he's looking at the unseen yet
[2:29:21] by promise. Amen.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; And then
[2:29:25] this is what I was trying to quote to
[2:29:26] you and now I want to give it as he said
[2:29:28] it
[2:29:31] said this is where I didn't come to be a
[2:29:33] sympathizer but I came to be a part of
[2:29:35] them. He says and now I'm a holy roller
[2:29:40] and by faith I believe that that's the
[2:29:43] bunch
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; that will go in the rapture.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; And I would rather have it than all the
[2:29:50] PhD and the DDS. that the church world
[2:29:53] can afford. What's he talking about? So,
[2:29:55] I'd sooner have that than have all this
[2:29:58] that I can see, all this fame and all
[2:30:00] this attention. I'd sooner have that.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, become so so focused on
[2:30:07] a on a vision of the unseen.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not filmy. It's not flooy
[2:30:13] stuff, friends. It's reality.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; I declare to you that is what's real.
[2:30:19] And this is what he concludes by saying.
[2:30:22] He says, "Then then when by faith you
[2:30:26] walk by faith by the unseen."
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Listen, I walk by the
[2:30:31] unseen." He said, "I see
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; a church going in the rapture."
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; God, give me that prophet's eyes right
[2:30:42] now.
[2:30:44] I pray that God give this congregation
[2:30:47] those prophetic eyes. I see not just
[2:30:50] something we learned, but I see it.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; I see a church going in the rapture.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus coming for his bride.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; I see a little neglected bunch of people
[2:31:06] who are laughed at and made fun of go in
[2:31:10] the rapture one day. I'd rather be with
[2:31:12] them than all the groups that I know of
[2:31:15] in all the world. For by faith we see by
[2:31:18] the unseen. Hallelujah.
[2:31:21] [Music]
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; When you shake hands with the people
[2:31:25] today and greet them, I trust there'll
[2:31:29] be something even different beating in
[2:31:31] your heart because you won't just see a
[2:31:34] man, a woman, a brother or sister, but
[2:31:37] you'll see beyond that. You'll see them
[2:31:42] sitting at the marriage. You'll see the
[2:31:44] rapture taking place. You'll see the
[2:31:46] atoms in their very bodies being
[2:31:48] changed. That's what the word has
[2:31:50] declared.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; We're looking at the promise.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; We shall be, my dear friends. I probably
[2:31:59] won't get to shake your hands, but we
[2:32:02] shall be
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; changed.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Transformed
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; in a moment,
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; in a twinkling of an eye.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the promise for that has
[2:32:17] already been delivered.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; God sent Elijah and delivered your
[2:32:22] promise.
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing these last verse and I urge
[2:32:31] you to
[2:32:33] hold to this un
[2:32:36] unseen hand.
[2:32:38] I
[2:32:42] I long to see
[2:32:48] my Savior's
[2:32:50] face
[2:32:53] and sing the story.
[2:32:59] Sing my grace,
[2:33:03] my grace and there
[2:33:11] is.
[2:33:15] Oh, I'll praise him for
[2:33:20] his
[2:33:22] [Music]

[2:34:36] strength
[2:34:40] still
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:45] the
[2:34:50] I want you to turn around and shake
[2:34:52] hands with as many of those as you can
[2:34:54] from where you're standing and not only
[2:34:56] say God bless you but with that
[2:34:58] handshake you're declaring I'll see you
[2:35:01] on the other side too. We'll do this
[2:35:03] again. Amen.
[2:35:06] Why don't we sing the chorus one more
[2:35:07] time, brother Owen, please?
[2:35:12] God bless you in the
[2:35:15] earth.
[2:35:17] hand
[2:35:19] that guides me through
[2:35:24] this wey
[2:35:27] land

[2:35:40] you guided
[2:35:42] by.

[2:40:04] Never weary of thinking about it. never
[2:40:07] weary of looking at them. That means
[2:40:10] everything to us.
[2:40:13] We just say in this atmosphere when you
[2:40:16] feel free, you're dismissed in Jesus
[2:40:18] name. We're going to have a glorious
[2:40:20] day.
