Description:
63-1219E Look Away To Jesus: William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long for at least many years four five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be it cannot be now it's inexistence and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
