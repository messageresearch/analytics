[17:46] work.
[17:48] Hallelujah. For you to have a prayer
[17:50] request on your heart this morning. Just
[17:52] make it known by the uplifted hand. We
[17:54] want to remember the Lei family. Sister
[17:56] Jenny Lelay, her sister-in-law has
[17:59] requested that we pray for her family. a
[18:02] brother and her brother and his wife
[18:05] were killed yesterday in an accident and
[18:08] 17-year-old son is left with no parents.
[18:10] We ask that the Lord would give them
[18:12] strength and above all that God's love
[18:15] would shine through. Amen. If you have a
[18:18] need upon your heart this morning in
[18:20] this atmosphere, Brother Tom, would you
[18:22] come this morning?
[18:25] [Music]
[18:27] Our dear heavenly father,
[18:30] Lord, as we've sung the songs and are
[18:32] singing the songs of glory and praise,
[18:38] Lord, I love that song, all hail the
[18:40] power of Jesus name. Let angels
[18:43] prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal
[18:46] diadem and crown him Lord of all. That's
[18:50] what we want to do this morning, Lord.
[18:51] We want to crown you with our praise. We
[18:54] want to crown you, Lord God, this
[18:55] morning. We want to lift up that holy
[18:57] name, Lord. We want to praise you this
[18:59] morning for you're worthy of all praise
[19:02] and glory and honor. Truly, God, you
[19:05] have said in your word, because I live,
[19:06] you shall live also. What a promise that
[19:09] is. And what a hope that is, Lord, when
[19:11] we see a dying generation that that
[19:13] resurrection life can be our portion
[19:15] this morning that you have given us this
[19:18] glorious hope and promise within our
[19:20] hearts, Lord. And father, as brother
[19:23] Derek has read these requests, Lord,
[19:25] there's only one that can give the bomb
[19:27] of Gilead. There's only one that is the
[19:29] mighty conqueror. There's only one that
[19:31] can give that comfort and that is you.
[19:33] Lord, would you come riding on this
[19:34] scene and minister to that family that
[19:37] with this great loss at this time,
[19:40] Father, we just pray for every need and
[19:42] divine presence. We just pray God that
[19:44] your presence will come down. Lord, as
[19:46] your prophet so often said, a greater
[19:48] than Solomon is here, a greater than
[19:51] Jonah is here. Lord, we're not looking
[19:53] to a God of 2,000 years ago. We're
[19:56] looking to a resurrected king that is
[19:58] walking, Lord, in this generation. May
[20:00] we reach out and touch the high priest
[20:02] this morning. Lord, let our minds not go
[20:04] back, Lord, in history, but may we see a
[20:07] living God that is present and amongst
[20:10] us, and we want to rejoice in that.
[20:12] Father, would you bless Brother Biscell
[20:14] as he'll bring the word? Anoint the
[20:16] vessel. Anoint him, Lord God, to speak
[20:19] to us, sayeth the Lord, the word of God
[20:21] that we have, spiritual food in due
[20:24] season at this time. Anoint him and
[20:27] anoint us to hear what the spirit would
[20:30] say to the church. Lord, I've come this
[20:32] morning with great anticipation, the God
[20:35] that I'll hear from the throne of grace.
[20:38] Here's my cup. I lift it up to you. Fill
[20:41] it this morning, Lord. And every heart
[20:44] that has come in need this morning. May
[20:47] you, the supplier of all our needs, come
[20:50] on the scene and minister life to each
[20:53] and every one, Lord, as we commit all
[20:55] things now to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[21:02] God bless you this morning. As you have
[21:04] your seats,
[21:06] we're going to have the Sunday school
[21:08] children come right in this morning.
[21:11] They've got a couple of songs for us and
[21:14] I believe that brother Richard's going
[21:16] to be uh presenting the ministry with
[21:19] the missionary offering from the Sunday
[21:21] school for the year.
[21:24] Another summer's approaching a spring
[21:26] has passed and the I believe this is the
[21:29] last day for the Sunday school children.
[21:31] So, we're real thankful for them.
[21:34] Brother John gave some statistics a few
[21:36] services ago, and this is a very
[21:38] critical time in a young person's life
[21:41] for their future walk with Jesus Christ.
[21:44] In the years between, I believe it's
[21:46] five and and 12 or 13 years old. 80% of
[21:51] those that will ever give their life to
[21:52] Jesus Christ do so by the time they're
[21:55] 13 years old. So, it's very important
[21:58] that we have our children in Sunday
[21:59] school and it's a real blessing to us.
[22:01] We do have a new member of the
[22:03] congregation. Eugene and Gina and Lily
[22:06] Ivano are very proud to announce the new
[22:08] addition to their family.
[22:10] Paul Pavle,
[22:13] however you say Paul, the various
[22:14] languages. Vladimir
[22:17] Evini Ivano,
[22:19] &gt;&gt; born June 20th at 9:53 p.m. The Ivanenko
[22:24] family, this Ivanko family, I had to get
[22:26] that right, is very blessed and happy
[22:29] and all are doing amazingly well. So we
[22:31] want to give them a hand this morning.
[22:41] Amen. If you're visiting with us this
[22:43] morning, we want to certainly say God
[22:45] bless you and greet you this morning.
[22:47] Trust that it's wonderful time in his
[22:49] presence with us this morning.
[22:53] We almost have them all set.
[22:55] Aren't they wonderful? Amen. Why don't
[22:58] we give the children a hand before they
[22:59] start to sing?
[23:05] God bless you.
[23:22] [Music]

[28:03] truth and know
[28:06] the way to heaven. We want to see, we
[28:10] want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted
[28:14] high. We want to see, we want to see, we
[28:19] want to see Jesus lifted high.
[28:29] [Music]
[28:36] See Jesus lifted high up and fly across
[28:41] the land.
[28:46] He is the way to heaven.
[28:49] We want to see Jesus lifted high

[30:34] We're going to see We're going to see
[30:37] Jesus lifted high.
[30:47] [Music]
[30:54] [Applause]
[31:12] As Christian families, our basic goal is
[31:14] to lift Jesus Christ higher in our
[31:16] lives, in the lives of our children. Um,
[31:20] when the word of God is placed in its
[31:22] proper position in our lives and family,
[31:26] then we're within the perfect will of
[31:28] God to prosper both spiritually and
[31:30] naturally for ourselves and of course
[31:32] for our families.
[31:35] Go ye into all the world. The great
[31:37] commission was Christ's command.
[31:40] It begs to bring up the question,
[31:43] have you spread the gospel to all of
[31:46] your world?
[31:49] And I was thinking about it this
[31:52] morning. I thought, you know, who knows
[31:55] the gifts or the callings that God has
[31:58] laid in the lives of these our children?
[32:03] who will spread the gospel that you the
[32:05] parent have swn into their hearts
[32:08] through your example in Christ.
[32:11] So the purpose of the Sunday school
[32:12] missionary offering is to assist in this
[32:15] regard uh because our personal world
[32:18] here is actually quite limited. Perhaps
[32:21] by God's grace, we can help to expand
[32:23] that world through others that we help
[32:24] along their way by making the gift of
[32:27] the word of God available to other
[32:29] parents so they have the perfect word of
[32:32] God to influence their families. Also,
[32:35] &gt;&gt; having said that, brother Joshua, you
[32:37] can go and and uh sister Sabrina and
[32:40] brother
[32:56] Thanks, Josh.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; This one's mine. That one's yours.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[33:12] Missionary offering. Cloverdale Bible

[33:18] Way would like to present their 2012

[34:20] I told brother Richard that that case
[34:22] that they put all the
[34:25] offering in looks like a a bullet case.
[34:28] And he said it is.
[34:31] So I guess we're going to send a lot of
[34:33] bullets over.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] Bless you, brother.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Let's sing together while the Sunday
[34:42] school children are going out. This

[35:15] "Yes,

[35:20] I'm going to let it shine.
[35:23] This light of mine,
[35:26] I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine.

[35:45] neighbor.

[35:50] Shine it around my neighbor.
[35:53] I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine.
[35:57] Let it shine. Let it shine. Jesus come.
[36:03] Let it shine. Till Jesus come. I'm going
[36:06] to let it.
[36:08] Oh, let it shine till Jesus comes. I'm
[36:13] going to let it shine.
[36:16] Let it shine till Jesus comes. I'm going
[36:19] to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it
[36:23] shine. Let it shine.
[36:29] Praise the Lord. You sound like a
[36:31] victorious church this morning.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has the word prepared you
[36:36] &gt;&gt; for such a time as this?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand together this
[36:40] morning as we invite our pastor
[36:44] just been away ministering.
[36:47] Amen. We want to pray that God will
[36:48] anoint the gift this morning.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Give us ears to hear.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; It's a great darkness throughout the
[36:55] land, but he said that there would be a
[36:57] light in the evening time.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could sing together as we
[37:02] just desire that the Holy Spirit would
[37:04] come and anoint the word this morning as
[37:05] the deer pandeth for the water. Do you
[37:09] have a deep desire this morning?
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:13] As the dear plant is home,
[37:19] the water so my soul longeth after
[37:26] thee.
[37:27] [Music]
[37:30] You alone
[37:33] are my heart's
[37:36] desire and I want to worship
[37:42] thee.
[37:43] [Music]
[37:46] For you alone
[37:49] are my strength, my shield.
[37:54] For you alone
[37:57] as my spirit.
[38:00] [Music]
[38:04] You have
[38:08] my
[38:10] higher
[38:14] to worship
[38:16] thee.
[38:20] Amen. And that's why we've gathered here
[38:22] today
[38:23] &gt;&gt; to worship him and in spirit and in
[38:26] truth.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] Well, we have a testimony I I need to
[38:32] read. And just before I do, I I want to
[38:35] say with regards to the meetings,
[38:37] Brother Benny Perry called this week
[38:39] after the meetings were over and he said
[38:41] about five different ministers have come
[38:43] and spoke to him.
[38:45] uh they were just a uh we had an unusual
[38:48] set of meetings and I guess one of the
[38:50] main reasons was that they haven't had
[38:53] some services for perhaps two or three
[38:56] years. I haven't been there for several
[38:57] years and the people came with I don't
[39:01] believe I've ever seen a group of people
[39:03] come with such expectation and that
[39:06] makes all the difference. They were
[39:08] literally filled with expectation. Even
[39:10] they picked us up in the car. The
[39:12] drivers in the car said, you know, we're
[39:15] just we're just so expecting in these
[39:18] meetings. We've been so anxious to have
[39:20] these meetings. And that was one of the
[39:22] things that I thought soon as I started
[39:24] to hear that, I just heard it from
[39:26] everybody. I just said, "It's going to
[39:28] be different.
[39:30] That's all it takes. Going to be
[39:31] different. Hardly hardly makes any
[39:33] difference who's standing up behind the
[39:35] pullpit. God's not going to disappoint
[39:37] the people. Amen. And it depends on how
[39:40] you came this morning. God's not going
[39:42] to disappoint you, friend.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; He's a good shepherd.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows exactly what we need.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; We have a testimony, and this is from
[39:53] Sister Maria Rosales.
[39:56] Uh she said, "I just want to thank the
[40:00] the Lord for his grace and mercy.
[40:04] 5 months ago, I went to the doctor and
[40:08] had some tests done.
[40:10] And the doctor was concerned
[40:13] uh
[40:15] because about something in my body that
[40:19] wasn't normal.
[40:21] And the doctor said he it might be
[40:24] cancer. So, he sent me to a another
[40:30] specialist for more serious tests. And
[40:34] during this time, I was going through a
[40:36] big battle,
[40:38] but I was coming. I was claiming my
[40:40] healing.
[40:42] And the Lord said to just rest in him.
[40:47] Finally, on June 22nd, and that's
[40:51] just now,
[40:54] I went for my final results and the
[40:57] doctor said that there is no cancer.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to praise the Lord
[41:04] and I know that
[41:05] &gt;&gt; and I know I have have done the devil uh
[41:10] I have the done the devil under the feet
[41:14] and he is defeated.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the ministry for praying
[41:19] for me and for the saints who knew and
[41:23] were praying too. And I also want to
[41:27] thank the ministry because all the
[41:29] services being preached are such an
[41:32] encouragement. God bless all sister
[41:34] Maria Rosales and the family.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; And it was some time ago that brother
[41:41] Jose and sister Maria Maria came here to
[41:44] the front and we had prayer with them
[41:48] and they described what was taking place
[41:52] and I could see the heaviness on uh on
[41:54] on the face. not discouragement, just
[41:56] heaviness, just the weight of these
[41:59] tests and everything else. We're all
[42:00] human and uh and we're when we're facing
[42:04] the unknown,
[42:06] it it's good to face the unknown
[42:09] sometimes because then we can we tend to
[42:13] get more serious
[42:14] &gt;&gt; with God. God needs to get us in a
[42:17] serious place.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; And so we're we're rejoicing. uh brother
[42:22] Jose and sister Maria and I I felt that
[42:26] it was just exactly appropriate and
[42:28] right. You came forward with your wife
[42:32] and they didn't make a big declaration
[42:34] amongst the people as such. Just had a
[42:37] few of their friends I suppose I don't
[42:39] know outside of just ourselves who knew
[42:43] but I haven't told anyone and we just
[42:46] waited because we believe that
[42:47] everything will be all right.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that way.
[42:53] So we're happy to have and I'm sure
[42:55] brother brother Tom and Joanne are happy
[42:58] to have Joel back from China. Uh I
[43:01] haven't seen him yet myself but uh yes
[43:04] he is there. Do you want to greet the
[43:07] people in Chinese or No, not not this
[43:09] morning.
[43:12] He's been learning some. So that's good.
[43:14] Maybe you're going to be missionary back
[43:16] there. Who knows?
[43:19] Hallelujah.
[43:21] We want to be remembering uh we have
[43:23] brother Ivan who's been there now for
[43:26] quite some weeks and time and 10 months
[43:30] last year. Brother Murphy left on last
[43:34] Monday. We have emailed back and forth
[43:37] uh since he's arrived and in fact as he
[43:41] met brother Joel there just before Joel
[43:44] was coming out and then brother Timothy
[43:47] Ma is in Vietnam and will be for
[43:49] probably the next couple months.
[43:53] You know people talk about making trips
[43:54] to some of these foreign countries. This
[43:57] this is not just going over, you know,
[43:59] for a week or two. This is they they hit
[44:02] the ground with their running shoes on
[44:05] and uh made in China and they they're
[44:09] made to run uh and they keep them
[44:12] working and we're very very happy to be
[44:14] able to be behind and support in prayers
[44:17] and I want to ask this congregation
[44:20] every time they come across your mind
[44:22] you pray for them would you?
[44:25] &gt;&gt; The devil hates this message
[44:27] &gt;&gt; and we love it.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's got people in his company
[44:31] that are very willing workers against
[44:33] it. And God has people in his company
[44:36] that are burdened people and are very
[44:39] willing,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; more than willing to give themselves.
[44:42] Amen. Uh,
[44:46] Brother David McAdams, God bless you.
[44:50] Brother David has been waiting some
[44:52] weeks to get things in order so he could
[44:54] come across the border. And we're so
[44:56] happy. And I was so happy, brother
[44:58] David, that you uh have that all fixed
[45:01] up and can be here in fellowship.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] Uh for some of you that possibly have
[45:10] heard and others have not heard, but
[45:12] brother Lee Vale passed away. He passed
[45:15] away on Friday. He was 97.
[45:19] I was talking to brother Roger Smith
[45:21] some weeks ago and we thought that he
[45:23] might make 98.
[45:26] Uh he was in a wheelchair at this time
[45:29] rather weak but it's amazing how his
[45:32] mind remained so sharp. We're thankful
[45:35] for brother Vale's life. Thankful for
[45:39] the labor, the time he spent to put the
[45:42] church age book. How many have read the
[45:44] church age book?
[45:47] Lots of hands. And we we've we've
[45:50] enjoyed it. And uh in fact is I never
[45:54] forget you don't mind standing for a
[45:56] moment. I don't forget what brother Surl
[46:00] said about the church age book. He said
[46:02] it was it was one that he could he when
[46:05] he gave it to someone he knew that it
[46:08] had it encompassed the major doctrines
[46:12] of the godhead and the baptism and the
[46:15] serpent seed. it encompassed those major
[46:17] doctrines in such a way uh that it was
[46:21] it's really hard to escape and and I
[46:24] appreciated that. I thought of that each
[46:26] time I've read in the church age book
[46:28] and I've quoted from it many times and
[46:31] so we thank God for brother Veil's life.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; And his contribution to this message.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God rest his his soul.
[46:53] All right, I think that
[46:55] Are we ready for the word?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that. Of course, I'm
[47:01] amazed that he loved me.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed that he loved me.
[47:14] Yes, I
[47:20] [Applause]
[47:22] [Music]
[47:23] preious
[47:25] blood I have my
[47:34] [Music]
[47:37] way.
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] Oh,
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:50] [Music]
[47:53] heat,
[47:57] heat.
[48:05] I
[48:07] [Music]
[48:10] see
[48:13] there wash away all my s.
[48:20] [Music]
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[48:33] Heavenly Father, we bow reverently,
[48:37] respectfully,
[48:39] &gt;&gt; and we're such a privileged people
[48:42] &gt;&gt; to be able to have come to know the
[48:44] living God.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Whom to know is life eternal.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; We pray that you will take the human
[48:50] vessel, oh God in your hand and the
[48:54] human vessels, your body. Pray that you
[48:57] will take us, Father, and let your Holy
[49:00] Spirit brood upon us. Pray Lord you will
[49:03] take your word and just sink it down
[49:06] into the good ground of the soul. Let it
[49:10] bring forth ground. Let it bring forth
[49:13] fruit, Lord. I pray, Father, you'll
[49:15] bless this people. We thank you for this
[49:18] glorious testimony, Lord, of the defeat
[49:21] of the enemy for our sister Maria
[49:23] Rosales. Thank you, Lord. Our brother
[49:25] David McAdams is with us. We thank you
[49:28] for these various victories, Lord. and
[49:31] we pray that your name will be glorified
[49:33] here this morning. We are standing in
[49:36] your presence on holy ground. And now,
[49:39] Lord, let your word be quickened to us
[49:41] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to read out of First
[49:47] Peter,
[49:48] the first chapter,
[49:51] and we're going to start reading at the
[49:53] 18th verse.
[50:03] I don't know if it's been your
[50:05] experience, but it has certainly been my
[50:07] experience. And I would appeal I appeal
[50:11] a great deal to the young people, young
[50:14] men, young ladies because of the I look
[50:18] upon you to have alertness of mind and
[50:21] retention
[50:22] and to see things from the perspective
[50:25] to be not only alert but to be
[50:28] perceptive
[50:30] to see where the Holy Spirit is seeking
[50:33] to bring us to because uh you can move
[50:37] into it
[50:38] &gt;&gt; and you don't have a bunch of baggage.
[50:41] You don't have all kinds of
[50:42] responsibilities.
[50:44] You're much more flexible
[50:46] &gt;&gt; and and and a congregation needs that
[50:49] &gt;&gt; and the other families and the older
[50:52] ones and mothers and fathers and elder
[50:55] we need that.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; We need that movement. We don't we don't
[50:58] need a bunch of dishes. We and not that
[51:00] you are, but uh we we need even more.
[51:03] I'd like to have a greater commitment
[51:05] from you.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. a greater commitment from the
[51:08] young people.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be very very committed to the
[51:11] message.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; To Jesus Christ.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Uh be committed to the congregation, to
[51:17] the church.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; To the bride of Jesus Christ both here
[51:20] and abroad.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't just wait till you
[51:24] know somebody is, you know, spoon
[51:26] feeding you. No, no. Just take it and
[51:28] and and take and say, "I'm I'm stepping
[51:31] forward."
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; I'm in manhood now. I'm in womanhood and
[51:35] I'm stepping forward.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just show me the way and I'll do
[51:39] it.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[51:44] For as much as you know
[51:47] that you are not redeemed with
[51:49] corruptible things as silver and gold
[51:53] from your vain conversation received by
[51:56] tradition from your fathers,
[51:59] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[52:01] a as of a lamb without blemish and
[52:04] without spot, who verily was fore
[52:07] orained before the foundation of the
[52:09] world, but was manifest in these last
[52:11] times for you.
[52:13] who by him do believe in God
[52:18] that raised him from the dead and gave
[52:21] him glory, that your faith and hope
[52:24] might be in God.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Seeing ye have purified your souls in
[52:29] obeying the truth through the spirit
[52:31] unto unfeigned love of the brethren. See
[52:35] that you love one another with a pure
[52:36] heart fervently.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 23, especially
[52:42] being born again, not of corruptible
[52:45] seed, but of incorruptible,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; by the word of God, which liveth and
[52:50] abideth forever.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; For all flesh is as grass, and all the
[52:55] glory of man, as the flower of grass,
[52:58] &gt;&gt; the grass witherth, and the flower
[53:00] thereof fallth away. Don't let's not
[53:03] forget that.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; But the word of the Lord endureth
[53:06] forever. Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And this is the word which by the gospel
[53:10] is preached unto you.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless his word as you
[53:14] have your seats.
[53:22] So now we just give you a moment get
[53:23] settled and have your minds focused.
[53:28] I want to uh bring you
[53:31] to this 23rd verse. being born again.
[53:37] You know, it's a phrase that everybody,
[53:38] it's a catchphrase. Everybody has it.
[53:40] Born again, born again. Uh the message
[53:44] really gives it a completely different
[53:46] depth
[53:47] &gt;&gt; and uh and uh I I've been the message
[53:50] has been something different for me in
[53:53] the last few years and even more so more
[53:57] increasingly
[53:59] potent
[54:01] &gt;&gt; and different. And I would really like
[54:03] to
[54:07] like to have your not only your full
[54:09] attention but uh that you will have and
[54:13] be in full expectation also as I am sir.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Now there isn't anyone here that
[54:19] understands the you can understand
[54:22] perhaps the process of birth natural
[54:25] birth but we really don't understand it.
[54:27] It's it's called one of the greatest
[54:29] mysteries
[54:31] and and how a child is formed and and I
[54:34] was thinking this morning in the study
[54:36] while I was there how
[54:39] brother Brandham was saying and I said
[54:40] to the people down in South Carolina
[54:43] how he took all those cells of your body
[54:46] and those 100 trillion or so cells that
[54:50] you have. Brother Brandham takes it
[54:51] down. And he says, "Now, if we got if I
[54:53] take you down to one cell,
[54:56] &gt;&gt; just one cell."
[54:58] And he said, "I still can't find you. I
[55:02] still can't find you because
[55:06] somehow God
[55:10] by his spoken word
[55:13] pregnant,
[55:15] impregnated
[55:17] the seed of man that would come to a
[55:19] woman, there be a conception. we don't
[55:22] understand it. I wanted to say it that
[55:24] way. I want to say it very plainly
[55:27] because if we don't understand that how
[55:30] can we possibly comprehend
[55:34] that the instead instead of what God has
[55:38] placed in a man that comes to a woman
[55:41] instead of that God pregnant
[55:45] sounds
[55:47] called words
[55:49] and he pregnant that with a different
[55:51] kind of life. this life by this life you
[55:54] might live to 40 50 60 70 80 90 or as
[55:58] brother Devale was he was 97
[56:02] that had very long life but this life is
[56:05] a diminishing life
[56:06] &gt;&gt; right
[56:08] &gt;&gt; we're going to go into that and but if
[56:09] we don't understand and somehow the
[56:11] world and I want to I want to try to
[56:13] succeed I've been very very moved to
[56:16] attempt to succeed in getting the people
[56:20] to understand the supernatural natural
[56:22] birth and when brother Brandham speaks
[56:24] about the genes about the cells and at
[56:27] the end of his life he just punched that
[56:30] home that you are a gene of God the same
[56:32] as you are a gene in your father you're
[56:34] a gene of God and somehow the churches
[56:37] and Satan I will say Satan in the church
[56:40] has kind of got you know h human
[56:43] existence as a reality and spiritual
[56:47] birth is some it's kind of some you know
[56:50] mystical foggy thing It's not foggy.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; It's more real than this one.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Your eternal life is more real. And it's
[57:01] not something say, "Well, it's just so
[57:03] mysterious. I don't understand it." But
[57:05] you're sitting here in a body and your
[57:07] birth was totally mysterious. Your
[57:09] conception was completely mysterious.
[57:11] The prophet says, "Well, you start in
[57:13] the womb as a back as a backbone or a
[57:15] spine or something." I don't know how.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it was formed. I don't
[57:20] know how conception took place, but I do
[57:22] know one thing. It happened and I'm
[57:24] here.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And the supernatural, the spiritual
[57:28] birth is exactly the same.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And I was saying, I've been just saying
[57:32] it to my wife over and over to impress
[57:34] myself and impress her. The spiritual
[57:37] birth is as literal as the natural
[57:40] birth.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And it's it's more real. It's more
[57:45] effective. And we do not want to keep it
[57:48] up in some mystical dream world. It's
[57:51] not a dream world. It's a reality. And I
[57:54] said, if the prophet said, "As you were
[57:55] a gene in your father and your
[57:57] greatgrandfather,
[57:59] so were you a gene in God."
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And it's and that gene in God is just as
[58:04] literal,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; more so literal, literal than the gene
[58:09] that was in your father.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And so, let's just get that settled.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the beginning when
[58:19] God had completed
[58:21] his creation. He looked upon it and he
[58:24] saw that it was very good. And the
[58:27] scripture says, "And God saw everything
[58:30] that he had made and behold it was very
[58:33] good. And the evening and the morning
[58:36] were the sixth day."
[58:39] listen to this uh description that
[58:42] brother Brandham gives in the rising of
[58:44] the sun and I want to read it because
[58:46] it's absolutely magnificent. It's to me
[58:50] it's just beautiful literature and so I
[58:53] just wanted to read it.
[58:56] He said there was a time when the world
[58:57] was laying in utter darkness. It was
[59:00] without form and was void. And it was
[59:04] all covered with water and was laying
[59:06] there in the dark, dismal, gloomy
[59:10] atmosphere.
[59:11] And the spirit of God moved upon that
[59:14] water and said, "Let there be light."
[59:17] God had a reason to do that, for down
[59:20] beneath that water there was seeds that
[59:24] he had planted, and it had to have the
[59:27] sunlight to make it live. And the first
[59:30] light that was ever given in the word
[59:33] earth was God's spoken word.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; So don't forget that was the first
[59:39] light. God spoken word.
[59:43] The first light that ever struck the
[59:44] earth was God's spoken word. He said,
[59:46] "Let there be light." And there was
[59:49] light that turned darkness into light in
[59:52] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[59:56] and life upon the earth. Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Then the spirit of God as it moved with
[1:00:01] love and compassion at that great day,
[1:00:05] the first day of the dawn of the
[1:00:07] creation upon the earth, the sun rose
[1:00:10] and its rays swept across and dried up
[1:00:13] the waters from the earth and made an
[1:00:16] atmosphere above.
[1:00:19] And for its first time, it was to bring
[1:00:22] joy and life to the earth by a seed.
[1:00:26] That was a great hour. But oh, it wasn't
[1:00:30] nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on
[1:00:34] that Easter morning. This time with the
[1:00:37] sun leaping into the skies, it brought
[1:00:40] forth a greater uh sunrise than ever
[1:00:43] because it came greater news with this
[1:00:46] sunrise than it did with the sunrise at
[1:00:49] the beginning. This sunrise brought a
[1:00:51] news that he is risen. He is quickened
[1:00:55] from the dead as his promised. He's
[1:00:58] risen from the dead.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; The first time the sun rose in Genesis,
[1:01:04] it was bringing a message that there
[1:01:06] will be life upon the earth. Mortal
[1:01:10] life.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; But this time when the sun rose, there
[1:01:13] was a dual sun rising. Another sun
[1:01:16] rising. It was not only su n rising. It
[1:01:20] was a s o n had risen to bring eternal
[1:01:24] life
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; to all God's promised seed that by
[1:01:29] fornowledge he seen laying upon the
[1:01:32] earth.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; No more could the botany life live back
[1:01:36] there at the beginning without the su n
[1:01:39] to bring it to life. No more than today
[1:01:42] when sons of god is upon the earth. It's
[1:01:46] take the s o n light to bring them to
[1:01:49] eternal life.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; This chose his chosen ones
[1:01:54] that he knew before the foundation of
[1:01:56] the world. He had chosen them in himself
[1:01:59] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:02:02] on Easter morning, then in in this dirt
[1:02:06] somewhere laid our bodies. The body
[1:02:09] you're sitting in this morning
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; laid in the earth
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; when he rose out of the tomb. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And every son and daughter of God when
[1:02:18] he rose out of the tomb, there was a
[1:02:21] dual rising not only of the of the of
[1:02:24] the first res first uh creation when the
[1:02:28] sun came. But if this was a dual rising,
[1:02:31] I'd like to just add one thing to it
[1:02:33] because further on further on the
[1:02:34] message and other places, brother
[1:02:36] Brandham said, "You were in him at
[1:02:40] Calvary. You were in him in the
[1:02:42] resurrection." And so I want to say you
[1:02:45] were laying in the earth and God
[1:02:48] somewhere amongst humanity had a literal
[1:02:50] seed that was going to come on down on
[1:02:52] down on down on down until you sit in
[1:02:55] Cloverdale Bible way. But that same
[1:02:58] morning was a dual resurrection also
[1:03:00] because you were also in him who was the
[1:03:04] consequence or the result of the spoken
[1:03:06] word of God. For he was the fulfillment
[1:03:09] of the prophet's words and then those
[1:03:11] words were going to keep coming down
[1:03:13] down down
[1:03:15] until would come a spoken word in this
[1:03:17] time
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; that would answer to that seed in you
[1:03:22] and give light to that seed and you
[1:03:24] would come to life.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's the dual purpose.
[1:03:28] There's a mortal life and there's an
[1:03:29] eternal life. There's a first birth,
[1:03:32] your natural birth by which you die. And
[1:03:34] there's another birth, it's a literal
[1:03:37] birth by which you live.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; And one is mortal life and one's eternal
[1:03:41] life. And those two things happen to be
[1:03:44] such a reality. One is not a figment of
[1:03:47] your imagination.
[1:03:48] It's as real and more real than the body
[1:03:51] you're sitting in. And if we get that
[1:03:53] real, Satan doesn't want you to
[1:03:54] understand it that way. But God wants
[1:03:56] you to see it that way. You were a
[1:03:58] literal seed in him.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He thought of you even in
[1:04:02] your present body. And he made a way for
[1:04:04] you to come here so you could be a
[1:04:06] witness of the truth because he knew
[1:04:08] that there would be a fall. He knew that
[1:04:10] there would be an enemy. He knew he had
[1:04:12] an enemy. And he knew that he was going
[1:04:14] to destroy this enemy. But he knew also
[1:04:16] that he was going to be expressed in the
[1:04:18] earth.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; We are the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; He is the tree of life. He's still the
[1:04:26] tree of life.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; I would like you to think of the tree of
[1:04:29] life as the body of Jesus Christ. In his
[1:04:32] body, he came, he came being the spoken
[1:04:35] word of God. He came to be the sacrifice
[1:04:38] so he could pay you, pay for your
[1:04:40] redemption. And then his spirit then
[1:04:42] came and the spirit brooding upon the
[1:04:45] earth as it is even now. And I'd like
[1:04:48] you to see the body of Christ around the
[1:04:51] whole globe as the fibrous roots of the
[1:04:55] tree called the tree of life.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And it's just gone and encompassed the
[1:05:01] entire earth in what we would know as
[1:05:04] believers of the message. And I don't
[1:05:07] know who all it's up to him where his
[1:05:09] roots go. But just the fibrous roots in
[1:05:13] the earth in this earth around the
[1:05:16] entire earth and bringing forth of the
[1:05:20] fruit of the bride tree.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a precious thing to me.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible tells us from that
[1:05:28] time from the fall from the time of the
[1:05:30] fall when death came
[1:05:34] when death was introduced and came upon
[1:05:37] fallen man and all creation came under
[1:05:41] the sentence of death.
[1:05:44] Everything began to decay. Now if you
[1:05:48] went on to search on a computer and a
[1:05:51] Google or what whatever search engine
[1:05:53] you wish to use and you just put the
[1:05:56] decaying earth or decaying humanity or
[1:05:58] the decay of civilization, you won't
[1:06:02] have you won't live long enough to read
[1:06:04] it all. I didn't spend any time on it
[1:06:07] because I simply know from the
[1:06:09] scriptures that we are in a decaying
[1:06:12] dying civilization
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; and you are faced with death everywhere.
[1:06:18] Death has permeated every corner and
[1:06:21] every part of humanity, every nation,
[1:06:24] every government, the best people and
[1:06:26] the worst people all are dying people.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; There has to be a hope somewhere.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could say that something has
[1:06:36] seriously gone wrong
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; when we look at what we see around us
[1:06:40] has gone wrong with creation. Creation's
[1:06:43] dying. And that's why the scripture says
[1:06:45] creation is groaning. The creation that
[1:06:48] a holy God looked upon and saw it as
[1:06:51] very good. Something has certainly
[1:06:53] changed because God looked again within
[1:06:56] a few generations. He looked again in
[1:06:59] the time of Noah. And the Bible says,
[1:07:01] "And God saw the wickedness of man, and
[1:07:05] it was great in the earth already, and
[1:07:09] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[1:07:12] heart was only evil continually." And it
[1:07:15] says in verse 11, "And the earth also,"
[1:07:18] that's Genesis 6:1, "and the earth also
[1:07:21] was corrupt before God." And I want you
[1:07:24] to hold that word corrupt for a moment.
[1:07:27] It was corrupt before God. And the earth
[1:07:30] was filled with violence. See, one
[1:07:32] follows the other.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; There's no anyone who thinks that there
[1:07:37] I'm going to manage, you know, I'm going
[1:07:40] to manage the evil part of my life.
[1:07:43] That's the biggest joke in the world.
[1:07:44] That's the biggest lie in the world.
[1:07:46] That's the biggest deception in the
[1:07:48] world. It's like saying, "I'm going to
[1:07:50] manage the devil.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to manage evil powers. I'm
[1:07:54] going to manage that." You're not going
[1:07:55] to manage. They're going to manage you.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; you don't have another, if you don't
[1:08:00] have a greater than he, greater is he
[1:08:03] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:08:05] world. You'll never manage that.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And so it says that the earth was
[1:08:12] corrupt and to and the the word corrupt
[1:08:14] in the Hebrew is to destroy
[1:08:18] uh to go to ruin. It had already reached
[1:08:21] a place of ruin to decay
[1:08:25] to be spoiled or to pervert. And Satan
[1:08:29] had already with the increase of
[1:08:31] mankind.
[1:08:33] He had already spoiled and brought to
[1:08:36] ruin and brought to corruption, marred
[1:08:39] and spoiled the creation that God had
[1:08:42] created.
[1:08:45] And the scripture tells us now in 2
[1:08:48] Timothy 3, we want to bring it forward
[1:08:50] to this time. Yay. And all that will
[1:08:53] live godly in Christ.
[1:08:56] All that will live godly in Christ. And
[1:08:59] I am certain that that's in your heart
[1:09:02] and that's why you're here.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; But the scripture says all who will live
[1:09:06] godly in Christ shall suffer
[1:09:10] persecution. Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And the persecution may not be a
[1:09:14] persecution of our own of our own
[1:09:16] thinking because it tells why it's
[1:09:19] persecution. It says, "But evil men and
[1:09:23] seducers
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; shall wax worse deceiving and being
[1:09:27] deceived."
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I had someone say once, "Which is worse,
[1:09:32] being deceived or deceiving?" And they
[1:09:35] said, "Well, being deceived is worse
[1:09:36] because the one that's doing the
[1:09:38] deceiving at least knows he's doing
[1:09:40] wrong. He knows he's trying to deceive
[1:09:42] somebody and there might be hope for
[1:09:44] him. But if you're deceived, you you
[1:09:46] know, there's really no recovery because
[1:09:49] you think that it's right.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's what being deceived is. But one
[1:09:54] who's deceiving, he knows he's not
[1:09:56] right.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; He just trying to do someone else for
[1:09:59] some reason." But he says, and this is a
[1:10:02] and and and those that live godly will
[1:10:04] suffer persecution, but evil men and
[1:10:07] seducers shall wax worse and worse,
[1:10:10] deceiving and being deceived. So it says
[1:10:13] evil men,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; evil men is ponderous in the Greek. It's
[1:10:18] full of labors, annoyances.
[1:10:21] uh evil men, men who annoy, hardships,
[1:10:26] pressed and harassed by labors
[1:10:29] of of a time of peril. Evil men speaks
[1:10:33] of a time of peril to Christian faith
[1:10:35] and steadfastness
[1:10:37] causing pain and trouble. These are
[1:10:40] troublesome times. And I see within a
[1:10:43] congregation, there's it comes from
[1:10:45] every direction. It may come from the
[1:10:47] political side. It may come from the
[1:10:49] educational side. It may come from the
[1:10:52] economic uh department or division. It
[1:10:55] may come whichever way it comes. But
[1:10:58] it's all one thing. It's because the
[1:11:00] world is decaying.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And we're dealing with death.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; We're dealing with evil powers. We're
[1:11:08] dealing with evil men and seducers
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; of the truth. Impostors. This. It says
[1:11:15] they're actually impostors. And s a
[1:11:18] seducer is is one. It's a strange thing.
[1:11:21] It's a juggler.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Someone who juggles or an enchanter to
[1:11:27] delight and to fascinate and to charm.
[1:11:30] See, Satan doesn't come right up and
[1:11:31] said, "Ah, I'm bad."
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; No, no. He says, "This is nice."
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Eve, look at the tree."
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And she got distracted. You heard me a
[1:11:40] couple Sundays ago. She got distracted.
[1:11:42] She was looking at the tree. It's a nice
[1:11:45] tree. It's pleasant. and it's it's uh
[1:11:47] you know it's it's good and it's good
[1:11:49] for food and it'll make you wise and all
[1:11:52] these things. She got distracted. It
[1:11:53] wasn't the tree he was interested. He
[1:11:56] wasn't interested in getting her to look
[1:11:57] at the tree. That was a distraction so
[1:12:00] he could seduce
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; and have her disbelieve the word of God.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's the intent. Come on.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And this troublesome and this weariesome
[1:12:09] and and all of these things come upon a
[1:12:11] per burdens and you know if he can't
[1:12:14] entice you he will do something else.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; See that's what he attempts to do. So he
[1:12:20] said it's it's of a time of peril to
[1:12:23] Christian to their faith and
[1:12:24] steadfastness. So I say to you in the
[1:12:27] name of Jesus Christ remain steadfast.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Any of you had anything that even
[1:12:32] brought a little tremble or a little
[1:12:33] shaking deny it. know where it comes
[1:12:35] from. Satan wants to he if he can't rock
[1:12:38] you to sleep, he'll try to shake your
[1:12:40] roots.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; But when he shakes your roots, just say,
[1:12:43] "Praise God, I will let them go further
[1:12:45] down."
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; This enchanter, a juggler, a seducer, to
[1:12:50] charm. But it is the intent is to
[1:12:53] mislead.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; A deceiver, an impostor. And an impostor
[1:12:58] is one who deceives by false pretenses.
[1:13:02] So it it's a it's an brother Brandham
[1:13:06] uses the word uses the word and he's not
[1:13:08] referring to any specific person but he
[1:13:13] he uses a word because you know there's
[1:13:16] a genuine that comes first an original
[1:13:19] that comes first and then there are
[1:13:21] others that come on behind it and
[1:13:24] they're not counterfeit as such that
[1:13:27] isn't the intent of them and I don't
[1:13:29] want to I'm just uh
[1:13:32] Brother Brandham used the word
[1:13:33] impersonators.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And so he sees, you know, they see
[1:13:38] something says, "Oh, that works. I can
[1:13:39] do that." And but they're not appointed
[1:13:42] to it.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; They don't have a God- called ministry
[1:13:45] to it. And so they say, "Well, we'll
[1:13:47] duplicate this." But it's not a it's not
[1:13:50] a godscent word like that.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; All right. I hope you're just getting
[1:13:55] that. And then I'll continue with the
[1:13:56] scripture. Now he says, "But evil men
[1:13:59] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[1:14:01] deceiving and being deceived, but
[1:14:03] continue thou."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; And and the reason I took this, it says,
[1:14:08] "But evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:14:12] worse and worse." We're not talking
[1:14:13] about the Eden now. We're not talking
[1:14:16] about what happened there. That was the
[1:14:18] fall. That's where death was introduced.
[1:14:19] We're not talking about Noah's time.
[1:14:21] We're talking about our time. We've come
[1:14:23] all that distance. Listen, this is our
[1:14:25] time
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and there isn't a person here, but what
[1:14:28] you have some some burden or some weight
[1:14:32] that comes upon you because of the age
[1:14:35] and the time we're in. And don't let the
[1:14:37] devil just try to tell you, well, it'll
[1:14:39] be better tomorrow. No. As far as the as
[1:14:42] far as the believers concerned, uh what
[1:14:44] is happening, the decay will be even
[1:14:47] greater.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; It will wax worse and worse.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. In a few short years, I can
[1:14:55] tell you by my own personal testimony,
[1:14:57] in a short lifetime, I can't even hardly
[1:15:00] grasp I and my wife, we speak together,
[1:15:02] can't hardly grasp where the world has
[1:15:05] gone in one lifetime.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Where is it going to be by
[1:15:10] the time our our children or those that
[1:15:12] are in BCA in school or any other
[1:15:15] school, where is it going to be uh when
[1:15:18] they get up? when they get grown up. I
[1:15:21] want to say to this congregation, all
[1:15:23] that uh have a moment to hear on the
[1:15:26] internet, you remain steadfast.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; And that is what Apostle Peter is saying
[1:15:32] or Apostle Paul rather to Timothy. But
[1:15:35] continue thou in the things which thou
[1:15:38] hast learned and hast been assured of
[1:15:41] knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Know where this came from.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] I can tell you that what we're believing
[1:15:52] and what you have been heard and remain
[1:15:54] steadfast in has been something that has
[1:15:56] been vindicated.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; And we're not talking about vindication
[1:15:59] in some, you know, glossy type of way.
[1:16:03] But the vindication, friends, the
[1:16:05] vindication, I want to come to it in in
[1:16:07] a few moments, Lord willing. The
[1:16:09] vindication is actually the proof
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; that it's the word
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; of the second birth.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] hear that one.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The vindication is the supernatural. I
[1:16:23] have been I have read a number of things
[1:16:26] and over the years, you know, have
[1:16:27] encountered people that have come
[1:16:29] against the message and they know all
[1:16:31] about the message and so they they get
[1:16:33] all the the the contradictions and and
[1:16:36] and the prophet of God said, "How could
[1:16:38] it be prophet? He said this and he said
[1:16:40] that and and so on and so forth." I'm
[1:16:42] coming directly against that thing
[1:16:44] because the one thing these men never
[1:16:46] do, they never come to the vindication.
[1:16:50] Said, well, he said this to this person
[1:16:52] and it was false. They never will come
[1:16:54] to it because that devil is scared of
[1:16:56] that
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; because that in itself, that vindication
[1:17:00] is the spoken word of God.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And that is God giving his proof that
[1:17:05] this is not the word of a man, but it is
[1:17:08] the word of almighty God. And that word
[1:17:10] is the same one who said, "Let there be
[1:17:12] light."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And there was
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; there was
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; In him was life.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; When that word became a man.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; In him was life.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; What was in him?
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; No death.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; No death.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; No decay. No corruption, only life.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; And it's still in him.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And he was that spoken word of God that
[1:17:47] came into existence, the son of God. And
[1:17:50] from him came the spirit to give life to
[1:17:54] all the other seeds.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And we are here as those seeds. Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And that spoken word had to come in this
[1:18:02] end time so that something would
[1:18:04] register to the predestinated seed in
[1:18:07] you. That is the truth.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Here is life.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I have found life.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; In a decaying world, I have found life.
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Life has found me.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:28] Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even in the natural birth,
[1:18:32] you didn't find life. You didn't find
[1:18:34] conception. Life found you.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Life brought you on the scene.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And so thus, you're sitting here. Mortal
[1:18:43] life, decaying life in a decaying world,
[1:18:47] in a corrupting world, in an evil world,
[1:18:50] and one that is waxing worse and worse.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But in the midst of this
[1:18:57] darkness shines a greater light,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; a literal light.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Not just some, you know, phenomena, not
[1:19:04] just something imaginary, not some
[1:19:07] illusion or delusion, a reality.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you because it's the
[1:19:13] truth. And if you'll believe it, you'll
[1:19:14] become a participant of it.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; You'll find out that it's more real than
[1:19:19] this body you're sitting in.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I want you to hang on to that.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And I addressed you young men, young
[1:19:30] ladies. You get a hold of that. It's
[1:19:32] more real than the body. You can pinch
[1:19:34] your body. It's not It's more real than
[1:19:37] that.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And you need it.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You need it. You know why? This body
[1:19:45] you're sitting in is decaying.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These cells won't work the
[1:19:50] way when you get a little older, they
[1:19:51] won't work the way they're working right
[1:19:52] now. and you'll find that out in such a
[1:19:55] short time.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But continue thou in the things which
[1:20:02] thou hast learned and hast been assured
[1:20:05] of, knowing of whom thou hast learned
[1:20:08] them.
[1:20:10] And verse 15, and that from a child thou
[1:20:13] hast known the holy scriptures, you that
[1:20:16] are children, you young people, you
[1:20:19] young ones here right on the front
[1:20:21] seats, I'm going to address you just
[1:20:22] this moment.
[1:20:24] And that from a child,
[1:20:28] from a child, want all the young
[1:20:30] children watch me from a child. Apostle
[1:20:34] Paul is talking to you.
[1:20:38] You have known the holy scriptures
[1:20:42] which are able to make you wise
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; unto salvation.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Through faith
[1:20:50] which is in Christ Jesus.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And I say to everyone here
[1:20:57] without any hesitation
[1:21:00] the scriptures which you have heard from
[1:21:02] a child and now many of us are all at
[1:21:05] different stages of life. I heard them
[1:21:08] as a child and they're still work.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You're half my age. You heard them as a
[1:21:14] child and they're still work.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; And generations have fallen silent and
[1:21:20] it worked for them. And I read their
[1:21:23] books and it still works for them and it
[1:21:26] works for me and it works for people
[1:21:28] half my age and it works for you. It
[1:21:30] works for teenagers. It works for
[1:21:31] everybody. Remain steadfast in the
[1:21:34] things you have heard and remember from
[1:21:37] where you heard them.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; In this meeting, I was speaking on a
[1:21:44] similar subject, some of these same
[1:21:46] things and speaking on the gene of God
[1:21:49] and and here a prophetist speaking about
[1:21:52] it and so on and so forth. And uh and
[1:21:54] there was a Baptist minister in the
[1:21:56] meeting. We had some nice audiences and
[1:21:59] visitors at every service. And there was
[1:22:01] a Baptist minister sitting over to this
[1:22:03] side and he just couldn't handle some of
[1:22:05] the things that are being said and but
[1:22:07] you know God was helping me and I was
[1:22:09] just able uh to punch one line after
[1:22:12] another after another and so he was
[1:22:14] mumbling something and so one of the
[1:22:16] deacons said you know having a problem
[1:22:18] with that and deacon and deacon told him
[1:22:20] he said because he came to me right
[1:22:22] after the meeting the deacon says just
[1:22:23] keep listening you just keep listening
[1:22:25] you just keep listening you know yeah
[1:22:27] and they walk around you know the deacon
[1:22:28] just walking around said you just keep
[1:22:30] listening listen to what he's going to
[1:22:32] say, you know. And and about that time,
[1:22:34] I says, "You never got this out of a
[1:22:36] Bible school."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Shocked him. You never got this out of a
[1:22:41] theological seminary. It's come divine
[1:22:45] from Almighty God.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And man, he just rocked back.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; He said to the deacon, he says, "Where
[1:22:51] does he get all these things?"
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; People around you, they wonder where you
[1:22:58] got all these things. It's not just some
[1:23:00] outward appearance. It goes way beyond
[1:23:03] that. It's some that's down in the soul.
[1:23:05] Where did we get all these things?
[1:23:07] Remember from whence you learned them?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, my mom told me this.
[1:23:12] Where'd she get it? My dad told me this.
[1:23:13] Where did he get it?" Well, I heard it
[1:23:15] in the in the church. Where'd he get it?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. Keep asking where it
[1:23:20] come from. Said, "Well, it came from a
[1:23:22] vindicated voice. It came from a
[1:23:24] supernatural voice."
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said things we don't
[1:23:29] understand. I didn't understand it. I
[1:23:30] didn't understand the birth. I didn't
[1:23:32] know anything about my birth.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I just came into the world.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how they fed me.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I know. One of the first things that I I
[1:23:45] was almost my mother thought I had died
[1:23:47] with double pneumonia. And I'm just
[1:23:49] laying there lifeless. And an old farmer
[1:23:52] type man, Holy Ghost man came in and and
[1:23:58] my my mother said, you know, I was in
[1:24:00] this state. He laid his hands on me and
[1:24:02] I was healed.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And didn't even have damaged lungs after
[1:24:08] that.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says about America. He says
[1:24:21] we wouldn't even have any America
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; if there wasn't any Lord Jesus here to
[1:24:26] help us be America.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And after after all he says the backbone
[1:24:31] of every nation is its morals.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; The backbone of any nation is its
[1:24:36] morals.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; He says and when the morals drop in a
[1:24:40] nation then the nation's gone.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Motherhood broken. you just might as
[1:24:44] well fold up. All other nations have
[1:24:47] done it and ours is no exception. In God
[1:24:51] making his promise, he says that's
[1:24:52] what's the matter with America today.
[1:24:54] Back in 56, the morals of it is
[1:24:57] corrupted and gone. The very foundation
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; the world is a again falling apart. He
[1:25:04] says now that's not only in America
[1:25:06] here, but that's all over the world
[1:25:10] wherever you go. And I say that's
[1:25:13] absolutely the truth.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Strife and war and killing and people
[1:25:19] butchering one another. What kind of
[1:25:21] humanity is this? It's a fallen
[1:25:23] humanity. It's a decaying humanity. Our
[1:25:27] only hope
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; is in the God of this word.
[1:25:32] And our only hope is to know to know and
[1:25:35] how thankful you ought to be that you
[1:25:38] ever heard this message because that's
[1:25:40] the only one that I know of or ever have
[1:25:42] heard of that's had such a powerful
[1:25:45] proof and vindication beyond all
[1:25:48] argument.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I would call all any men who find
[1:25:53] something something that they think's an
[1:25:55] hour of the way, let them go out in
[1:25:57] their world and straighten it out first.
[1:26:01] Hallelujah. You talk about illusion or
[1:26:04] delusion. You talk about demons in
[1:26:06] flesh. It's on the streets of Vancouver,
[1:26:09] Bellingham, Seattle, or wherever you
[1:26:11] want to go. It's everywhere.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; I say, "Go and fix that up."
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Leave me alone.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; I got a I got a messenger that spoke and
[1:26:23] declared the absolute truth
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; supernaturally.
[1:26:30] and trace people's lineage back.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; You're not from this city. You're from
[1:26:35] another city. Where'd that come from?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; You're not from this town. I see you
[1:26:40] coming from the west traveling east.
[1:26:42] You're not from this city. You're not
[1:26:44] from this state. You're not from this
[1:26:46] country. Tells one man
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; in conference with God. A doctor.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You ought to listen to it. I mean,
[1:26:54] friends, I tell you, that other world,
[1:26:56] that other dimension is so close. It's
[1:26:59] so close to us.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Father Brandon, get somebody begins to
[1:27:02] speak about doctors and how kind they
[1:27:06] are and how with tender hands they try
[1:27:10] to make life easier and better for
[1:27:12] people. You talk about understanding.
[1:27:14] You talk about being compassionate. You
[1:27:17] talk about being just understanding with
[1:27:19] with humans in in their suffering. And
[1:27:22] he said, "And doctors try to make things
[1:27:25] better for them." them. Then he goes on
[1:27:26] and preaches conference with God for
[1:27:28] about an hour and a half. And then they
[1:27:31] call a prayer line. It's about an hour
[1:27:33] and a half or more later. And the first
[1:27:35] man, you have to listen very close.
[1:27:37] First man, he says,
[1:27:40] "You believe it, doctor, don't you."
[1:27:43] Do you know what I can tell you and
[1:27:46] someday you'll find out? Brother Brown
[1:27:48] knew that before the service started.
[1:27:52] He knew that when he started talking
[1:27:53] about doctors and how kind he spoke
[1:27:55] about them. He knew that first man is
[1:27:58] going to be a doctor.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; You know how I know? Because he says,
[1:28:02] "You know, you believe it, doctor, don't
[1:28:04] you?" Mhm. Mhm. Mother two. Mhm.
[1:28:09] You're not from You're not from this
[1:28:11] place. You're not from this city. You're
[1:28:13] not from this country.
[1:28:15] You come from Canada.
[1:28:20] Vancouver.
[1:28:21] But you're not from You're not from
[1:28:23] Vancouver. You're not from Canada. You
[1:28:25] come from Finland. Tell you what, when
[1:28:27] he got to that place, I just said,
[1:28:29] "Amen."
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he knows I'm not from
[1:28:32] this country and I'm not from this city
[1:28:33] and I'm not from this state and I'm from
[1:28:35] England, I'm from uh Finland, then he
[1:28:38] surely knows I came from eternity.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; I believe the same one says, "Then you
[1:28:42] came from the mind of God. Wouldn't you
[1:28:46] accept that?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you accept that?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; As thus saith the Lord.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And in the mind of God, he thought of me
[1:28:54] in my in my mortal life. In the mind of
[1:28:56] God, he thought of me as a son of God,
[1:28:59] in my eternal life.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And so, he sent a gene through the
[1:29:02] fathers and through the through
[1:29:04] humanity. Sent a gene all the way down
[1:29:06] that gave me a body so that he could
[1:29:09] come in with the Holy Ghost and express
[1:29:12] himself.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And that would be his spoken word that
[1:29:19] would give life and light.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And this body goes out and goes outside
[1:29:24] almost every morning. Say, "Where's the
[1:29:26] sun?"
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Don't be so quiet. You all do the same
[1:29:32] thing.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; We like the sun, don't we? Not too much,
[1:29:41] but we like some sun.
[1:29:45] in him
[1:29:47] says. So now we've talked about the
[1:29:49] corrupting part, but he said there's
[1:29:52] coming a kingdom whose founder, a city
[1:29:55] whose builder and maker is God, and
[1:29:58] these things has to give way.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Everything of this corruption,
[1:30:02] everything that you're next to,
[1:30:04] everything, even some things that are
[1:30:06] really nice, you know, we don't want to
[1:30:08] go back.
[1:30:10] Okay, kids.
[1:30:12] I used to my my mom and dad they got a
[1:30:16] washing machine. A washing machine. They
[1:30:20] actually made machines. They invented
[1:30:22] machines that would wash clothes. So my
[1:30:24] mom didn't have to over the scrubboard,
[1:30:28] you know, like the I saw her do that.
[1:30:31] Then they got a washing machine, but it
[1:30:33] had a handle on the side and it was
[1:30:36] Armstrong
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and that was my job.
[1:30:42] Then as time went on, man got smarter
[1:30:45] and wiser and they invented one that
[1:30:48] would work by itself. And I could just
[1:30:51] look inside and see the thing go. Isn't
[1:30:54] this fantastic?
[1:30:56] And now they just throw all the clothes
[1:30:58] in a machine and zip zip and walk out
[1:31:01] and forget it. And they I said, "What's
[1:31:05] that? That's a dryer ready for another
[1:31:09] load."
[1:31:10] Oh, we've come a long ways. But outside
[1:31:14] in the midst of all of this,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; in the midst of all of this is trouble.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; In the midst of all this wonderment is a
[1:31:23] decaying world.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; But this same messenger is able to
[1:31:28] confirm to us with supernatural sign
[1:31:31] there's another one coming.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And this one has to give way.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said it's waxing worse and
[1:31:41] worse. This one has to give way.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to be part of the
[1:31:46] worse and worse.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; You can be part of the better and
[1:31:49] better.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He says the great sculptor, I'm going to
[1:31:58] try to watch my time. the great
[1:32:01] sculptor. When he seen the fall of his
[1:32:03] humanity or the fall of his masterpiece,
[1:32:07] he wasn't willing to leave it lay there
[1:32:09] face down and ruin. He went to work
[1:32:12] immediately
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; to build it up again. He wasn't willing
[1:32:16] that it should perish, lay there like
[1:32:19] that in the in in all the time because
[1:32:22] he's God and he will not be defeated. So
[1:32:26] he went to work immediately and be to
[1:32:29] build again uh unto his own image a man.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And then identified masterpiece said
[1:32:36] once again he's seen his own reflection
[1:32:40] when one man was born on the earth from
[1:32:45] the womb of a woman. Now I'm I'm taking
[1:32:49] this a little slowly. I have I have if I
[1:32:53] have time to come to it. Brother
[1:32:56] Brandham said some
[1:32:58] said some powerful uh staggering made
[1:33:02] some staggering statements very early in
[1:33:04] his ministry
[1:33:06] and you have to be mature to even hear
[1:33:09] it.
[1:33:12] He said, 'I saw his own reflection born
[1:33:16] on the earth from the womb of a woman.
[1:33:19] That was God's masterpiece. That man,
[1:33:22] that was God's masterpiece. It was the
[1:33:24] son of God, Jesus Christ. The reason he
[1:33:28] was because he was perfectly the word.
[1:33:32] In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:33:34] was with God and the word was God and
[1:33:37] the word was made flesh. The word
[1:33:42] was made flesh.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I understand all of you that are
[1:33:48] here that the sperm
[1:33:52] was made flesh.
[1:33:58] That's not a stunning surprise.
[1:34:02] The sperm was made flesh
[1:34:06] and your mother ate of the things coming
[1:34:10] out of the earth and you began to form
[1:34:14] in a body of flesh
[1:34:18] and the sperm was made flesh.
[1:34:21] But this prophet says even if he got
[1:34:24] that first cell,
[1:34:26] that smallest cell, he still can't find
[1:34:30] you
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; because you're more than a cell
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; God the creator in the creation in the
[1:34:43] beginning in the first creation the one
[1:34:46] that fell he he pregnantated
[1:34:51] that sperm with cells,
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; trillions,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; till your body would come and you're
[1:34:59] sitting here as a result of that.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; But God, that same God said, "Now I'm
[1:35:05] going to put my I'm going to put this
[1:35:08] eternal life that was mortal life and my
[1:35:10] enemy was able to deceive it." Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And my first son, Adam, fell.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And by falling, death came.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Corruption came.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; A world is going to decay. It's going to
[1:35:25] spoil. It's going to ruin.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; But I am I am the master.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; I am the author.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to speak another word.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; And this is eternal life.
[1:35:42] one that he can never deceive.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to put it into sounds
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; in whatever language is spoken in. It
[1:35:52] will mean the same thing.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And they will never be able to discover
[1:35:58] it and Satan will never discover it. I'm
[1:36:00] going to put my word of eternal life, my
[1:36:03] eternal life. I'm the author of life.
[1:36:05] I'm going to put it into sounds. I'm
[1:36:07] going to put it into word form. And that
[1:36:10] word was spoken by the prophets, not
[1:36:13] even in English or any of the languages
[1:36:15] we speak, I suppose. And the languages
[1:36:17] from the earliest time, they made sounds
[1:36:20] and they spoke word. But the thing was,
[1:36:22] there were people that believed it.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Believe these men,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; believe these men.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And out of their mouth came the seed.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And into the heart was a faith.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; And they believed it and the two met and
[1:36:43] there was a conception
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; and the eternal life was born again.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; The man, the woman became born again.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now then this man, this
[1:36:58] eternal life man, Jesus Christ,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came as a result of that. He
[1:37:04] he w he he was not from a human sperm.
[1:37:08] Right.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; He was from the word of God.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; He was from the other side.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was from the spoken word.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And the life that was infused in the
[1:37:19] spoken word lodged in the womb of Mary
[1:37:22] who believed that word and brought forth
[1:37:25] a son.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And in him was life.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; No more decay, no more death,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; nothing to wax worse and worse, only to
[1:37:36] wax better and better.
[1:37:38] In him was perfection. In him was grace.
[1:37:41] In him were all the attributes. Am I
[1:37:44] speaking too loud? Is this all the
[1:37:46] truth?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, friends? Do you
[1:37:48] believe it? You must believe it.
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; This is the only way out of this
[1:37:55] corruption.
[1:37:57] There is no other way. Jesus said, "I am
[1:38:01] the way.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I am the truth. And I am the life.
[1:38:06] No man comes to the father but by me.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You must believe that.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; There's no other way.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; You'll go the way of the grave and
[1:38:16] you'll become a teaspoon of ashes. And
[1:38:18] where your spirit is, who knows? But God
[1:38:21] has made a way for you to come back to
[1:38:24] him.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter of God,
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; they begin to build his masterpiece. And
[1:38:34] and there was a son, a man called Jesus
[1:38:37] Christ. And it says of him, and he said
[1:38:41] of himself,
[1:38:43] the prophet said, "He is the beginning
[1:38:46] of the creation."
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You heard me speak on it, but now I'm
[1:38:50] taking it further. He's the beginning.
[1:38:53] He's not just kind of a to replicate
[1:38:56] what happened in the beginning. No,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; this is a whole new beginning. This is a
[1:39:02] complete different Genesis.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; of eternal life.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Eternal life has come back out of the
[1:39:10] earth.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What God intended in the
[1:39:13] first place now has been restored.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Has come back. The original has come
[1:39:19] back.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; You can't have two originals.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; The first creation fell,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; right? and the and and and the author of
[1:39:29] the first creation has began a a an a
[1:39:33] creation, a beginning of what he
[1:39:34] intended. That's why he's called the
[1:39:36] second Adam.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He's the beginning of the creation of
[1:39:43] God.
[1:39:45] And how could God be created that he is
[1:39:47] a spirit? How could he be? He's eternal.
[1:39:51] He never was created. He never will be
[1:39:54] created because he was God at the
[1:39:56] beginning. But he that is the beginning
[1:39:59] of the creation of God was Jesus Christ.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ was the beginning
[1:40:05] of the creation of God. Do we accept
[1:40:08] that?
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; We need to accept that
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; in a simplicity when he was made
[1:40:13] manifest when God lived in him.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; He said he's God's creation. You accept
[1:40:19] that?
[1:40:23] The first, the last, the amen, the
[1:40:25] beginning of the creation of God. When
[1:40:27] God created himself a body, he came down
[1:40:30] and lived in it. And that's the
[1:40:32] beginning of the creation of God. When
[1:40:34] God created himself a body and came down
[1:40:36] and lived in it, that's the beginning of
[1:40:39] the creation of God.
[1:40:41] In him was life.
[1:40:44] It says in John 1:4, "And the life was
[1:40:46] the light of man."
[1:40:49] Life, no death. The incorruptible seed
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; came from the bosom of the father.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the new creation came
[1:41:00] from an eternal life resource.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And in him, now hang on to this. In him
[1:41:09] was the literal seed of God.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; When he came out of the bosom of the
[1:41:16] father, it was a literal seed.
[1:41:20] And now this had to be somehow
[1:41:22] transferred through the process of
[1:41:24] redemption. Transferred to you.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Your body still laying on the earth.
[1:41:30] Just elements of the soil.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Just elements of the soil.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; But it was going to come forth somehow.
[1:41:39] And if God didn't know that you were
[1:41:40] going to be here, then who does?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be here. God
[1:41:45] knew exactly every footstep.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. There isn't anything that
[1:41:49] surprises him.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And the only way that you can be a son
[1:41:54] or daughter of God, this is things that
[1:41:57] are to be
[1:42:00] one of the last messages that he spoke
[1:42:05] because you have eternal life. The only
[1:42:08] way that you can be a son or daughter of
[1:42:10] God because you have to have eternal
[1:42:12] life.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And there's only one form of eternal
[1:42:15] life and that's God's life.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We accept that.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; We believe that
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; only one form of eternal life. He said
[1:42:22] that was God.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; That was to be a son of God. You had to
[1:42:26] be in him always.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Because it's eternal life.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And the gene of your father, the gene of
[1:42:34] your life, the spiritual life tonight
[1:42:37] was in God.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Was in God the Father before there was
[1:42:42] even a molecule.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; I I say amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are nothing but the
[1:42:48] manifestation. You are nothing but the
[1:42:51] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:42:54] was in God as a son of God.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; I
[1:43:00] want to emphasize that.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to memorize that
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; you are nothing but the manifestation
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; of the gene of God.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; You should say that to yourself. I am
[1:43:14] the manifestation of the gene of God.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; That was in God as a son of God.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Or a daughter of God. And you're
[1:43:25] expressed after his word has come into
[1:43:27] you to light up this age.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; John said further, "At that day, you
[1:43:35] shall know that I am in my father and
[1:43:37] you in me and I in you.
[1:43:44] I was surely with him. The prophet says,
[1:43:47] I was surely in him at Calvary.
[1:43:50] I must be identified with him at
[1:43:53] Calvary.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; I was there when he died.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; I died with him.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And then I was with him when he raised
[1:44:04] up from the dead. Now listen friends,
[1:44:08] this is I was preaching and I was almost
[1:44:10] beside myself and you sometimes you say
[1:44:13] things and you have to think back about
[1:44:16] what you said after it was all through.
[1:44:19] But I came to this point while I was in
[1:44:21] South Carolina and what actually
[1:44:23] inspired this message to me is that this
[1:44:27] seed this he was incorruptible.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; He could not be corrupted.
[1:44:37] He could never become a part.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he aged." Yes, he aged.
[1:44:43] He deteriorated
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; as his body. But when the disciples came
[1:44:50] to the tomb, that body was not there.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what was surpris the tomb was
[1:45:00] empty.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That body was not there. And so it had
[1:45:05] gotten older,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; but something happened. Something
[1:45:09] transpired and men and women both
[1:45:12] witnessed. He's not there.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; This body has changed.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; The incorruption,
[1:45:21] the incorrupt, it could not be
[1:45:23] corrupted.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; The corruption. And that's why Apostle
[1:45:27] Paul says this corruption must put on
[1:45:30] incorruption.
[1:45:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're in a
[1:45:36] decaying world and you're sitting in
[1:45:38] bodies. I don't care how young you are,
[1:45:40] how strong you are, how beautiful you
[1:45:42] are, how anything you are. You are in a
[1:45:45] you're in a corrupting state.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; But this corruption must put on
[1:45:51] incorruption. And that cannot just be a
[1:45:54] nice phrase. We say, "How how does that
[1:45:57] happen?" It happens because God sends a
[1:46:00] word. God sends a word to those that are
[1:46:03] predestinated and they believe that
[1:46:06] word.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know how.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; I don't I can't understand it, but I
[1:46:13] believe it anyhow because there's
[1:46:15] something inside that has come from a
[1:46:18] divine resource that says that is the
[1:46:21] truth.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; That says to me that's your only way
[1:46:24] out. Amen.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; I've read of accounts of people that
[1:46:29] have come into into just disastrous
[1:46:33] situations, catastrophic happenings on
[1:46:36] Earth, and and something has happened,
[1:46:38] and they they find within themselves a a
[1:46:42] resource of strength, and they call it
[1:46:44] adrenaline, a rush, or whatever it was,
[1:46:46] but they go and leap over a wall. They
[1:46:49] go and do some things that normally
[1:46:50] would kill a human and they save
[1:46:53] themselves
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; and they say afterward, "I don't know
[1:46:55] how it happened. I don't know what
[1:46:57] happened. I don't even know what
[1:46:58] overcame me, but I just I just found a
[1:47:01] resource of strength and I just went and
[1:47:03] did it." That was They never knew they
[1:47:06] had it even in this human body. But you
[1:47:08] have it in there.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; But you have something else in there. If
[1:47:12] you're called as a son and daughter of
[1:47:14] God, God has put a He's put a something
[1:47:16] in you. It is his own word. It is a
[1:47:19] seed. Brother Brandham calls it a seed.
[1:47:22] Well, I don't understand it. I don't try
[1:47:24] to understand it. I just know it's
[1:47:26] there.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; And that is why when I still hear what
[1:47:31] they call it discernment. I don't call
[1:47:33] it discernment. I don't even I the
[1:47:35] prophet said it's not discernment. He
[1:47:38] said the word of God is quick and
[1:47:41] powerful
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[1:47:44] What is it? Say it to me.
[1:47:46] Word of God.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; What is it that's sharp and powerful?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Word of God.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Is it English? Is it Hebrew? Is it what?
[1:47:54] I don't care what it is. It's the word
[1:47:56] of God.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Whether he thought it, whether he
[1:47:59] intended it, whether he spoke it, or how
[1:48:01] he said it, or what sound he used is
[1:48:04] irrelevant to me. God pregnant sound
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; and he let his thought come out into
[1:48:10] some process. And I don't try to figure
[1:48:13] out the process. All I know it was in
[1:48:15] the mind of God. A prophet told me it's
[1:48:17] in the mind of God. And the word of God
[1:48:20] is a is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:48:22] intents of the heart. And I heard a
[1:48:24] sound. I heard a word. It was something
[1:48:27] that spoke to me as a young man in my
[1:48:30] teens. And I I knew it was God.
[1:48:33] Hallelujah. And when I heard this
[1:48:35] messenger begin to speak and even to
[1:48:37] this day, 60 years later,
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. I'm still moved exactly the
[1:48:43] same way because I'm I'm I'm hearing a
[1:48:46] voice from my own beginnings.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, those beginnings
[1:48:51] are true.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I can say it more powerfully today
[1:48:54] because I have proven it.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; I proved it in my 20s. I proved it when
[1:48:59] we were married. I proved it raising a
[1:49:01] family. This God is God.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; This is his word.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be afraid to believe it.
[1:49:10] Don't you ever be afraid to commit your
[1:49:12] all to it.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This will help you out of
[1:49:15] your dilemma. This world, don't forget
[1:49:18] this world is corrupting and you came
[1:49:20] into it in a corrupting birth and by the
[1:49:22] woman we die. But by this man, the
[1:49:25] masterpiece Jesus Christ who returned
[1:49:27] back to the spoken word of God. By that
[1:49:31] word, we live.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And it can penetrate between the spirit
[1:49:36] and the soul.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is more than emotion.
[1:49:40] Even though I'm an emotional person,
[1:49:42] it's more than emotion.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than excitement.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; It's more than a theory.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; It's a gene of God.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when it comes into
[1:50:00] your being, you know that you're a new
[1:50:02] creature in Christ Jesus. Old things
[1:50:04] have passed away. And don't ever be
[1:50:07] don't ever let it become crowded and
[1:50:09] clouded over with this life.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; This life's a passing life.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. This life is a
[1:50:15] life of darkness.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; This life is a is a decaying life.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And when he came out of the grave, sir,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; you were there.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Every son, every daughter were there in
[1:50:30] that tomb
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; with him. Yes. Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; But when you were there
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; and corruption was trying to set in,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; but you could not be corrupted.
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't somebody yell hallelujah?
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; You couldn't be corrupted.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And if you couldn't be corrupted in the
[1:50:50] tomb, you won't be corrupted now.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I say that with all authority. Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; If Satan could not corrupt me in the
[1:51:02] tomb,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; then he cannot corrupt me in this life.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the same life dwells in
[1:51:09] me.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet could say, "We
[1:51:12] rose with him."
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We rose with him. Why?
[1:51:17] Because corruption couldn't claim our
[1:51:20] bodies.
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And I have a sign sealed document. They
[1:51:27] can lay you in the tomb. They can bury
[1:51:29] you in the sea. They can burn you at the
[1:51:31] stake and become just gases. But that
[1:51:34] word of God will call those elements
[1:51:37] back again. And you'll stand in the
[1:51:40] presence of God because God the creator
[1:51:42] said, "You're my son. You're my
[1:51:44] daughter. And you're going to stand in
[1:51:46] my presence."
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my enemy, my enemy can
[1:51:51] never never defeat that purpose.
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:57] Hallelujah.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; So you were there when he came out of
[1:52:10] the tomb.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; You were there when he crushed. Said,
[1:52:14] "Well, the devil this, the devil that."
[1:52:16] Hey, let me let me just fix that once
[1:52:18] and for all.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; You were in him when he crushed the
[1:52:21] devil's head.
[1:52:25] You were there participating.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I don't understand. I don't
[1:52:31] remember it." You don't remember
[1:52:32] anything in your mother's womb. You
[1:52:33] don't remember anything when you were
[1:52:35] born. You don't remember anything while
[1:52:36] she was feeding you for the first few
[1:52:38] months.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Didn't you have a mind? Well, well,
[1:52:42] yeah. I I guess I had a mind. Well, how
[1:52:43] come you don't remember it? I don't
[1:52:45] know.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; How come you can't figure it out? How
[1:52:48] did it happen? I don't know how it
[1:52:51] happened. Well, then forget it.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; But you believe it. Yeah, I have to
[1:52:55] believe it. I'm here. That's the same
[1:52:57] thing spiritually. I received eternal
[1:52:59] life and it was a it was a clearer birth
[1:53:02] than this birth.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And it's a better life than this life.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you were in him. A
[1:53:09] vindicated prophet said it. And that
[1:53:11] proven that proven word, that
[1:53:13] supernatural word, not a gift is a
[1:53:16] supernatural word.
[1:53:18] Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; These people are trying to say, "Well,
[1:53:20] brother Ben Brandom used a gift."
[1:53:22] Listen, it's more than a gift.
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it?
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; When he was when he was doing that, when
[1:53:29] he was doing what they call a first
[1:53:31] pull, he was actually demonstrating the
[1:53:34] proof of your life.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "How so?" Because that was the
[1:53:39] seed.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, how many times they say, "Would
[1:53:44] it help you to believe?" Yeah.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Why did he want the people to be helped
[1:53:48] to believe? Because by helping them to
[1:53:51] believe, they come to life.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; If you believe,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; do you believe, young people? Do you
[1:53:59] believe?
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe, young man? Do you
[1:54:01] believe?
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; I'm putting you on the spot. Do you
[1:54:04] believe it?
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; So shall it be.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It's done. Is more than a song.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; It's more than a course. It's already
[1:54:16] done.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; You believe it, friends. There'll be
[1:54:20] nothing in this world. This world is a
[1:54:22] world of corruption. But you have come
[1:54:24] from an incorruptible source.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; You came out of the bosom of the father
[1:54:29] with him. And he could not be corrupted.
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; For thou will not leave his soul in
[1:54:43] hell.
[1:54:44] Not only him, but every seed, every
[1:54:47] every cell that was in him.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; If God wouldn't leave your soul in hell
[1:54:55] or the grave back then,
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; how do you ever expect he'll cast you
[1:54:59] into hell now?
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; We've passed
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; from death unto life.
[1:55:09] My brother, my sister, I'm going to
[1:55:11] preach till every doubt is nailed to the
[1:55:14] wall.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It was nailed at the cross.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Don't you think for a moment this is too
[1:55:20] strong? You need every ounce of this
[1:55:22] strength
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; and you need more.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; You pray for the preachers that they
[1:55:27] will come with the full uh the full uh
[1:55:30] demonstration and the full expression of
[1:55:33] who you are in Christ.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:38] That's true.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; We all know what we aren't.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; We all know our failures.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; But when we pray, see who you are.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; You see that devil who's been hounding
[1:55:48] you
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; as a defeated foe.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Writhing with a crushed head
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; and you realize I was in my Lord Jesus,
[1:55:57] the masterpiece when he crushed his
[1:56:00] head.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; I was in him at Calvary. I was in him in
[1:56:04] the tomb. I am the beginning of the new
[1:56:06] creation. And you can say, I'm part of
[1:56:08] the new creation. And the word of God
[1:56:11] says, I'm a new creature in Christ
[1:56:13] Jesus. Old things, old things,
[1:56:16] corrupting things, hallelujah, have
[1:56:18] passed away.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And behold, all things are new.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Not all things are band-aided. Not all
[1:56:26] things are patched up. Not all things we
[1:56:29] somehow deal with it. No, all things are
[1:56:32] new.
[1:56:35] Hallelujah.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do you preach like that,
[1:56:38] Brother Ed?" "Because it's the only way
[1:56:40] out for me."
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; And it's the only way out for you.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; It's the only way out for the future.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; So, I believe that beyond my
[1:56:55] understanding, I believe that because I
[1:56:58] believe where it's coming from.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; This is not something from brother
[1:57:02] Biscll's mind. This is not even
[1:57:04] something from William Brandham's mind.
[1:57:05] This is something from the mind of
[1:57:07] almighty God and sent his proofs
[1:57:10] continually his proofs so that the
[1:57:12] people who would hear could say it's God
[1:57:16] speaking.
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And then there are many that want to
[1:57:21] say, "Well, it wasn't God. He said this.
[1:57:23] They said that and it didn't happen."
[1:57:25] Well, let's go to all the places it did
[1:57:26] happen.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Who then was speaking?
[1:57:35] Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, I almost feel
[1:57:39] like dancing
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; down in South Carolina. Brother Roy,
[1:57:43] they were dancing.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; And I just let them dance. They came
[1:57:46] right up to the front and they just had
[1:57:48] a hallelujah time. Glory to God. Just go
[1:57:51] to it, fellas.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Have a great time.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Two sisters got up and just had a jig
[1:57:57] together.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; What kind? I don't know. wasn't invented
[1:58:01] in the corrupting world.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; It was something divine. I just let him
[1:58:05] rejoice.
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close in just a few
[1:58:18] minutes.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; The beginning.
[1:58:25] The beginning. I want you to get this
[1:58:27] now.
[1:58:29] is the first version.
[1:58:32] It's the first or unique item from which
[1:58:36] copies
[1:58:37] or alternative
[1:58:39] versions are made,
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; the original or the first version. The
[1:58:45] beginning is the start. Jesus said, "I'm
[1:58:49] the beginning." And he tells John the
[1:58:52] apostle, "Tell the seventh messenger,
[1:58:55] thus saith the true and faithful
[1:58:58] witness,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not untrue. I'm true
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and I'm faithful."
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; What I said, I will do.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; The beginning.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Tell the messenger, the
[1:59:11] seventh messenger, the last one, the
[1:59:14] prophet messenger, not a reformer, a
[1:59:16] messenger who I will speak the truth and
[1:59:19] I will give him the proof.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; In abundance,
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; it'll be such a tidal wave.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; It'll be a an a tsunami of evidence
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; and it'll be in private. It'll be in the
[1:59:35] interviews. It will be everywhere. Amen.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; It will be amongst the hundreds of
[1:59:40] thousands. It'll be when there's just a
[1:59:41] few orund or two sitting on a log.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; You have three three questions in your
[1:59:49] heart. Not three and a half or four.
[1:59:52] Three. That's exactly what I had.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the truth.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Who is that? That's the word of God.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; That's not a man looking into my face
[2:00:02] trying to read. He said, "You think I'm
[2:00:04] reading your mind? That's not reading
[2:00:06] your mind. I caught that thought.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Who is that? The same Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:10] that walked here on earth. The
[2:00:12] masterpiece
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; and the word
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; became flesh.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Not sperm became flesh. The word became
[2:00:25] flesh.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; I think you'll never forget that
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh. The Bible says
[2:00:34] made flesh. Process. I don't know.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; I don't even know the process of the
[2:00:39] sperm being made flesh.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; But this is and that was but I I I
[2:00:44] believe it because you're here
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm here
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and we accept it.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; We just believe it. Do you believe that?
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; You have believed unto mortal life.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Now, how about the other one?
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to believe it. I want you to
[2:00:58] see it. I want you to glorify God in it.
[2:01:01] You were a gene in almighty God.
[2:01:05] Not just some mind thought.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; No, not just a thought like you think,
[2:01:10] but a thought that became substance.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And that thought remained in the word
[2:01:16] when he was made flesh.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; And Jesus went to the cross thinking of
[2:01:20] you. No wonder the songwriter said, uh,
[2:01:24] I was in his mind.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you still with me?
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; In a literal form. Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; How literal God knows even the number of
[2:01:37] the hairs of your head.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; How's that one?
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that one?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; If he knows the number of the hairs of
[2:01:44] your head. And as the prophet of God
[2:01:46] said, he didn't lose any of them.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone who's lost hair and I'm losing
[2:01:51] a lot myself. I just have to rejoice.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I will say what the messenger did.
[2:01:56] Haven't lost one.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Haven't lost one.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, haven't lost one.
[2:02:01] Hallelujah. He's rejoicing. Brother Sam,
[2:02:04] are you rejoicing?
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We haven't lost one.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; They're all coming back.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; That's a reality.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; We haven't lost one. He knows He knows
[2:02:16] the number of our hairs of our head.
[2:02:18] What about our problems? Does he know
[2:02:20] your problem? Does he know your
[2:02:21] difficulty? Oh, forget it. He knows
[2:02:24] every detail of it.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Is he interested in you? He carth for
[2:02:27] you.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Believe that.
[2:02:32] Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, does your wife care for you?
[2:02:37] Does your husband care for you? Does
[2:02:39] your mother or father care for you?" I
[2:02:40] know that they do, but you know, there's
[2:02:42] a limit to what they can do, but there's
[2:02:44] no limit to what he can do.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; And you must believe on him
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; and hold steadfast,
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; knowing from whence you received it.
[2:02:55] Lord.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And so the beginning is the point in
[2:03:00] time.
[2:03:01] Oh,
[2:03:05] is the point in time or space at which
[2:03:08] something starts
[2:03:10] comes into existence. Brother Brandham
[2:03:13] said God thought of himself as being
[2:03:16] human
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; and that materialized him.
[2:03:24] Glorious.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Marvelous statement. You don't even have
[2:03:28] to understand it.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; God saw you here in a body
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; of flesh.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm going to come to them. I'm
[2:03:38] going to send my spirit into them."
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; They're going to be born again.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Of eternal life seed.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; They're going to have eternal life
[2:03:47] because that's the only life I have. And
[2:03:49] I'm just going to let them know that
[2:03:51] they've always existed.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that goes way beyond me."
[2:03:58] Well, I'm glad it does, cuz if you could
[2:04:01] figure it out, I wouldn't want it.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I can figure it out, I
[2:04:09] don't want it.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I want something I can't figure out. I
[2:04:12] want to believe it.
[2:04:18] Hallelujah.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; My time is slipping away, but there's so
[2:04:24] many things that we we don't understand.
[2:04:32] You've all heard the word arch or arc,
[2:04:36] whichever way.
[2:04:39] uh brother
[2:04:41] uh Aras Toms I believe it was he was the
[2:04:44] pastor who was pastoring in Victoria
[2:04:46] when we had brother Brandham come over
[2:04:48] there he was the one who invited brother
[2:04:50] Brandham and sponsored the meetings in
[2:04:52] Saskatoon Saskatchewan 1947
[2:04:56] Toms and he was pastor of the apostolic
[2:04:59] church where we attended a short time
[2:05:03] and he was he was he was himself British
[2:05:09] on your size, brother Frank.
[2:05:14] So he called the archbishop.
[2:05:16] The archbishop was where the queen
[2:05:19] always went to Christ Church Cathedral,
[2:05:22] you know, because there has to be a lot
[2:05:24] of, you know, lydah. Everything has to
[2:05:27] be just right.
[2:05:29] when the queen goes to church. So
[2:05:31] whenever she's in Victoria, it might be
[2:05:34] decades, but when she's there, she goes
[2:05:35] to Christ Church Cathedral. And uh and
[2:05:39] there has to be an archbishop there. So
[2:05:41] brother Tom's had some reason to call.
[2:05:44] And brother Tom, he was quite quick. Oh,
[2:05:47] hello. He says, "Is this the bishop?"
[2:05:49] And the phone just went silent.
[2:05:52] And he hears the archbishop.
[2:05:58] Don't forget the arch part,
[2:06:01] the archbishop
[2:06:03] because that's the first. That's the
[2:06:05] beginning. That's the highest.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; The arch.
[2:06:12] Well, the arc archangel appears twice in
[2:06:16] the Bible. Just twice.
[2:06:20] and the ark angel. It says, "For the
[2:06:24] Lord himself
[2:06:26] shall descend from heaven with the shout
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; who himself
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Lord himself
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout."
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; The shouts the Lord himself.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; With the voice
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; of the archangel.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Don't forget arch here. This is the
[2:06:49] archangel.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hello. Are you an angel?
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; The archangel.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the Lord himself
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; with the voice of the resurrection.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; And the trump of God.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And that's the rapture.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; That's the rapture.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; We had to have the kind of profound
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; uh absolute proofs.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; It had to come in this generation. All
[2:07:18] children of this age, children of the
[2:07:21] rapture, children of this uh generation
[2:07:24] of the seventh age, children who
[2:07:26] experience these things. Who have ever
[2:07:28] who ever heard who ever heard anything?
[2:07:31] Who heard about Revelation 10:1 and
[2:07:34] another mighty angel? Who ever put that
[2:07:36] together with Thessalonians?
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; You are so privileged.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. It's
[2:07:43] just what the Bible says. Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And who is he coming to?
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; I know I got here in mortal life. He was
[2:07:53] coming to you.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; You were ordained to hear it.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you heard it. I don't
[2:08:01] even try to figure that out. I don't I
[2:08:03] don't know how come, you know, all the
[2:08:05] millions of cells that were, you know,
[2:08:08] there and finally, bang, one hits and
[2:08:12] and it's you.
[2:08:14] And brother Bradam even describes that.
[2:08:16] He says it's not the first one.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; So there's a whole bunch died
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; even in that sperm so you could live.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; It might have been one right at the back
[2:08:27] of the wall
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; right the back of the egg
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; and it just wiggles its way through and
[2:08:33] bangs into this one into that one. This
[2:08:35] one's you know this one's a certain
[2:08:37] features and whatever more. I won't go
[2:08:39] into that.
[2:08:41] And then bang, it hits one. Conception
[2:08:44] took place. Figure that one out. I don't
[2:08:46] know. But here the gospel came down and
[2:08:49] millions were destroyed and millions
[2:08:52] were martyed and 168 million and but the
[2:08:55] word kept coming down.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; The seed kept coming. You couldn't stop
[2:09:01] it. Oh, are you with me friends?
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Until you would come here on the scene
[2:09:07] in natural life. And God in his mind
[2:09:10] said, "I ordained that one to be there.
[2:09:13] Now I'm going to move on somebody. I'm
[2:09:15] going to move on a preacher to preach.
[2:09:16] I'm going to move on a neighbor to give
[2:09:18] him a book. I'm going to move on
[2:09:20] somebody to say something.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to move say on Jonathan Largo
[2:09:25] just to walk by a girl in the in the in
[2:09:28] the walkway of the university say it
[2:09:29] wasn't an apple."
[2:09:33] Hello. That wasn't a very big message,
[2:09:35] was it? She wasn't an apple. Today she's
[2:09:39] his wife.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Quite a message, wasn't it?
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; No, it was a seed laying there.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Bang, something happened. Wasn't an
[2:09:56] apple. My goodness. What even caused it?
[2:09:59] Hallelujah. She became a wonderful,
[2:10:02] wonderful believer
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; and a wonderful wife.
[2:10:20] Well, I'm going to I'm just going to
[2:10:22] stop
[2:10:24] cuz you know one one one thing I think
[2:10:26] when Jesus got to the end he just quit
[2:10:29] and uh somehow I'm I'm at the end. I
[2:10:33] just got down to the beginning. I got
[2:10:35] I've been pondering for days and days
[2:10:37] and Tom was supposed to preach this
[2:10:39] morning and I felt bad. I texted him
[2:10:41] yesterday, do you mind if I just I got
[2:10:43] this I can't get it, you know, out of my
[2:10:45] head. I just got to say it. I got to
[2:10:48] preach it to somebody. So, thanks folks
[2:10:50] for coming. Thanks for listening.
[2:10:53] [Music]

[2:11:03] and tell you you're beyond corruption.

[2:11:27] right now. I just had to feel so happy.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; You couldn't even leave my soul in hell.
[2:11:32] And the devil comes around tries to tell
[2:11:33] you you're this or you're that or the
[2:11:35] other thing. Well, now you know what you
[2:11:37] can tell him. You can tell him to go to
[2:11:39] hell cuz that's where he's going. You're
[2:11:41] not going there. I'm not going. But
[2:11:44] you're going for sure. You're destined
[2:11:46] for the flames. And I'm going to sit
[2:11:48] there and I'm going to rejoice with all
[2:11:50] the saints
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; at the victory of my Lord Jesus Christ
[2:11:54] and your ultimate destruction.

[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Just give him thanks. Whatever you
[2:12:30] caught in the word. Don't let someone
[2:12:32] take it from you. Don't let yourself be
[2:12:34] distracted. Just say, "I want to just
[2:12:36] thank him."
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank you, Lord.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; For letting me hear your word.

[2:15:23] again.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Just going down those titles. Oh my. I
[2:15:28] never forget Mike Hunt. He He got in a
[2:15:31] little closet. It was Sister Dao, Sister
[2:15:34] Glattis Dao's, Sister Tammy Laroo's
[2:15:37] great aunt, and she was giving us tapes
[2:15:41] that we could use to clear the tapes,
[2:15:43] clean the tapes, and she had some of the
[2:15:45] best. I was so glad. She was so full of
[2:15:49] vim and vigor and energy. She just oh
[2:15:53] she come out there a little frail woman
[2:15:55] and go to the hospital at 6:00 in the
[2:15:58] morning and donate her time. And she had
[2:16:00] one pen that was 15,000 hours and she
[2:16:02] said but this was a little too heavy on
[2:16:04] my clothes. So I have this one at 6,000
[2:16:05] hours and you know she had all these
[2:16:07] pins. Uh she just gave years and years
[2:16:10] and years of her time and I'd come in
[2:16:13] and meet her. She'd get back at noon and
[2:16:15] the police would drive her to the
[2:16:17] hospital cuz she had a wreck once. She
[2:16:20] said, "It was my fault. I ran right into
[2:16:22] him." She t-boned a car. So then the
[2:16:25] police said, "No, I'm we're going to
[2:16:26] drive you." So they drive her and bring
[2:16:28] her back at noon and she'd sit in there
[2:16:31] and had her little outfit and she was
[2:16:34] way up in her 80s and she say, "I was
[2:16:37] witnessing to an old fellow today." She
[2:16:39] said he was just there, you know, and
[2:16:41] and I I don't She has a prayer brother
[2:16:43] Brandham gave her. So, she would give
[2:16:45] this prayer and say this prayer with the
[2:16:47] people, have them pray this prayer. And
[2:16:49] uh I said, "Well, how old was he?" Well,
[2:16:51] I know probably 778 and she's 10 years
[2:16:55] older, but she he was an old guy. She
[2:16:57] wasn't old. You know, that was
[2:16:59] wonderful. And she she'd sit in that
[2:17:01] chair and I'd sit right beside her in
[2:17:03] the chair and she'd say, "Well, Brother
[2:17:05] Bis, what's new?"
[2:17:07] I thought, wasn't that great for someone
[2:17:09] that's 88, 89, 90 years old? What's new?
[2:17:12] She want to know what's happening.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Brother, Brother Mike would sit in her
[2:17:24] closet and had all those tapes and he'd
[2:17:27] just read the titles. He said, "All you
[2:17:30] have to do is read the titles." He said,
[2:17:32] "You just have to read the titles.
[2:17:33] They're all so inspired." He he felt
[2:17:36] like he just wanted to preach when he
[2:17:37] got out of the closet.
[2:17:40] Hallelujah. Have you ever read the
[2:17:41] titles? I asked the people in South
[2:17:42] Carolina, a lot of people never read the
[2:17:44] breach. I said, I want everybody to read
[2:17:46] the breach in the next two days. It's so
[2:17:48] wonderful. If you haven't read the
[2:17:50] breach for a long time, you should take
[2:17:51] that up. You ought to say to yourself,
[2:17:53] I'm going to read the breach.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, even the brother that drove us in
[2:17:57] in the van, he didn't know where the
[2:17:59] breach was. I said, do you have a sales
[2:18:01] book? Yeah. I said, it's in the sales
[2:18:03] book. It's the service before the first
[2:18:05] seal, the breach. Go home and read it.
