TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in this series of episodes I would like to relate to you the things that I saw the things that I heard and the things which I experienced the purpose of these episodes is to acquaint you with the supernatural that's very essential to acquaint you with the supernatural which God did in and through the Ministry of William Branham and how God continues that's what's very significant how God continues to produce the supernatural through the ministry even to this present time proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that's the key believing that this Jesus Christ who spoke and who was recorded in the in the Bible and that Jesus of the Old Testament or God of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new and we have the Holy Spirit today it's the same God in all of those events and it shall come to pass the scripture says if they will not believe thee God speaking to Moses neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and if the supernatural doesn't have a voice that follows it a voice that reveals Jesus Christ to the people I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world is that true then Sam to disbelieve strictly stranger to me you're from away from here you come from another city you've got a lot of trouble all in your heart you got heart trouble if you begin with that right there's a whole lot of blackness must be a black sheet keep following you like that what's the last number I sold allowance and that was a man was professor divine healing he said uses the wind is that true and you got a horse turn your church there's nothing about it in that rap your pastors sick right so I've got polio is that right sister don't feel tension well then people tell you they're alive and the only thing wrong with your hearts that nervous condition got your heart worship world home and peace and God bless you you're all ours ask now that ever demons power in this feeling of evil we were not defeated taken after the in the name come out of the people and a few crippled people although we occur in Psalms God spoke through David and he said lo he doth send his voice and that a mighty voice Jesus when he came and there was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself jesus said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me that just couldn't be clearer my sheep know my voice I know them and they follow me and then speaking of the voice that would come in this last time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared it to his servants of prophets we say what is this mystery it is so that the voice will be in the bride so the prophet of God has said God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and we can quote the words of Jesus when he said it is not you that speak but the Spirit of your father which speaketh in you and if all believers of this message would take those words that I've just spoken concerning it's always been the voice revealing they Almighty God to us and to realize it's not just something that we heard and we received this is what has connected the same Bible I don't read another Bible but the same Bible has just become alive and the opening of the word the opening of the scriptures things that we could not see or understand have become so clear and this is our great ambition to make this known and furthermore I would like to advise anyone regardless of what you have heard and way regardless of what you've heard positive or negative I can tell you that I would recommend to you to do the same thing that I did if the angel of the Lord was at the platform and I am a witness of these things I was there I saw it on the platform I saw it as the prophet of God spoke to the people and I knew the people some of them were from my church and I knew that the angel of the Lord would not use or human vessel to speak things that were not true it had to be absolutely true and God is a God of truth and it speaks of Jesus Christ he was full of truth and grace and I can say that in the revealing of himself it was absolutely true until you have somebody that can stand in the public year after year after year for many years and reveal the secret of the heart only God can do that tell where the people were till the war they were standing tell them what their suffering with tell them whether they live or they will die I mean that kind of that kind of voice is the voice that I want to hear and follow and that's the voice that a person will hear long after this life is over that's the voice that's the voice of Almighty God and I can tell you that that is what I experienced and it is true
