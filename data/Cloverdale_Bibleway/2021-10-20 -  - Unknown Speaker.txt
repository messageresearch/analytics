stream lord that's all we desire we want that same god lord here tonight the same one that could deliver souls the same one that could heal the wounded could bring blind eyes to sea and deaf ears to

oh jesus we desire a move lord may this be a fresh offering of praise tonight lord not just in every day wednesday night service but a service lord with a living god is present among us oh god lord

lord move amongst us in jesus christ's name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen that's why we've come tonight saints [Music] that he would move amongst us and deal and heal deliver seek save the lost amen amen we'll have a testimony tonight we prayed for the saint or i should say for sister and hope butter jeremiah for the little baby on sunday and maybe some have heard but they text in and we were got the testimony on monday he said at the time of prayer things turned around and mommy and babe are home the baby gained weight amen my goodness at the time of prayer by when the saints i know we're called to pray in different areas get down on earth's prayer that's the god we serve tonight that's the one on the scene and so we give him all the glory and the praise for that tonight amen we don't want to take any glory away from him all right well we can turn our scriptures thank you musicians i'm as nervous as all get out tonight just doesn't change huh it's brutal maybe tonight i know what the lord has i just pray he just gives us the words that he desires to speak i was pondering he said man i feel like i'm a bit of a shotgun notes tonight you know those guns that were like a big blunderbuss you know they kind of you know it is everywhere but whatever the lord desires he can fine-tune that into a real fine sniper if he's so designed so whatever it is a big blunderbuss or a big shotgun or a sniper he'll do it all tonight amen we're going to turn to genesis 18 have a few scriptures that will read maybe a little bit from last time we spoke but then moving onwards that's why i said it might feel like a shotgun but lord help me genesis 18 verse 9. this is abraham and sarah when the lord himself came to meet him so we'll just we'll start at verse 9 and he said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him i know abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed and herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i sure of a surety bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord imagine imagine he was speaking imagine taking that question my goodness is anything too hard for the lord no nothing at the appointed time at the time appointed i should say i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son amen you may be seated i'll read a couple other scriptures as we go forward here the baxter good to see you family welcome send our greetings back home you give that michael dexter big big bear hug for me amen i'm just going to speak to this little little subject lord give us liberty and on the time appointed for life at the appointed time the scripture says that the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life it was a prepared time it wasn't a given date didn't say at this exact time but it was an appointed time god knew i'm going to return and there's going to be a there's going to be life come forth amen but we're hitting abraham here at a bit of a way forward in the story because abraham had been waiting he'd been waiting there had been some waiting i just want to read a couple scriptures if we go back to last last service we've spoken on uh hindered unhindered i should say in hebrews 12 1-2 we spoke from that scripture wherefore seeing we're also our compass about with so many was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight we spoke on that amen i pray the cement bags are dropped cut off and we kept running amen and the sin that so easily beset us and let us run and we're running but the next part of that is with patience with patience all right so we're running but with patience now with patience the race that's set before us looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and set down the right hand amen he endured the cross endure that that is to remain or abide not to recede or flee it's to preserve under misfortunes and trials to hold fast onto one's faith so this is the word endure there and if we keep we read a couple other scriptures for the vision is yet for an appointed time there's a time ahead you're going to have to endure or you're going to have to run with patience but there's an appointed time amen uh galatians 6 8 9 says for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap corruption he that sowed to the spiritual reaper of the spirit or shall reap everlasting life and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season don't be weary but in due season there's a time appointed somewhere up ahead run with patience all right and and it actually in the amplified says an appointed season we shall reap if we faint not don't loosen don't relax our courage all right and don't be faint that's really patience in this age probably it's a little waxing thin not only to see a patience are you kidding me you know i got to put the ate my food on an eight-second ride it needs to be hot fast right you know it's not hot fast enough for you know our coffee long are the days of roasting over the fire right for a coffee to percolate unless you go hunting to our hunters but now it's keurig man boom snap pop dribble dribble done coffee now right patience that's hard it's against us run with patience it's against everything here is against that creation of patience you know it's a virtue people i mean my goodness my brother had a road rage incident in front of his driveway just a few nights ago and impatient trying to cut off get around someone doesn't like that you know i think i'm going too slow we'll take this and you know nobody's patient anymore and i'm very pretty sure the pandemic has probably changed that got even worse people are on edge big time fuses they're like this long there's nothing there what do you say when they blow up you know it's just there's nothing no wick no patience but you know this patience if we look at the word patience you know we think have patience who knows the song we all know the song right actually i think some of our little ones don't know that song so we might need to teach in sunday school does everybody don't have patience we all listened to that when we were kids probably none of you little ones did but i did it was like a snail right no nobody even heard okay some of you nodding your head showing my age that's where i learned the song but that's actually patience ain't passive we think patience i'm going to sit there i'm just going to you know abide my time you know not make any noise just be nice kind of put that mona lisa smile on you know is she is she smiling is she frowning what's she doing that's not the patience that is in the scripture to run with patience that's not it it's actually the the the word is hupo mene or in greek i'm no greek but what it's actually saying is constancy under suffering in faith and duty another one says is having the quality to stand facing the storm struggling against difficulty and opposition or another one is active spiritual resistance against satan this world and our own carnality that's a very different run with patience than what was probably just prior in your mind 10 seconds ago it's a very different patient that you're running with right so the word hoopo actually means underneath or to be under something heavy the word mino means to stay or to abide so you're abiding or staying under something that's a bit of a heavy load it describes a resolute decision to remain in one spot i'm blowing your mind on patience right now that's good but when you bring those two together and you bring the compound meaning together it's a person who is under some type of heavy load who refuses to stray from his position he's like it is not happening in the face of a storm because my position is commit i'm committed to my task that's running with patience regardless of how heavy the load how fierce the opposition how intense the stress how much the weight is thrown against you this person running with patience looking ahead at an appointed time a promise is ahead of him abraham ran with patience inwardly resolved that he's not going to move amen he's committed he's staying put and he'll never surrender for any reason that's some serious patience that ain't no snail slowly going across the street this is a whole nother level of patience amen so we're running when you think i'm running with patience or i need some more patience there's your definition it's an active it's an active word amen so we're just hanging we're hanging in there never giving up refusing to surrender and those in christ have this virtue because we're trusting in a god that has a plan set for us he knows each step we take he knows the plan he's ordained our footsteps for the footages of the righteous are ordered of god and so we can stand in the face of all obstacles and run a patient race all right man now brother branham says do you think the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though satan has done what he's done he says it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything that's why we can run in the face of danger that's why we can commit to the cause and we can stand in our position underneath the heavy load because his purpose that he's placed in your lifebuilder tim or any of your life it's going to come to pass is he scared is he going to be defeated god's purpose will never be defeated so in that take your rest and run with patience knowing at the appointed time promise will come to pass but so often we don't really now when we talk about promise i just want to we're going to tuck patients and and running with it here here but when we're looking at a promise that god has has given you and you're standing in it and you're running indeed with patience it can get it can get difficult because we're not seeing maybe something happening it's just there's not i see no signs nothing's transpiring there's nothing there to give me some feedback that that i'm making headway it's not there it's invisible i was pondering that a little bit and i was thinking about the process of life and actually the growth of human life and what is happening and you have no clue what's going on right like what's going on and so i have a little video just hold just we'll hold it there for a second and i'll take this three minutes because i want you to realize as we just go through this little message tonight little simple wednesday night that regardless of what you may see or hear or what your five senses here feel something very well could be transpiring you just have no you don't have a sense to see it except your faith accept your faith the sixth sense do not rely on your emotions and your affections and your memories and your you're you're touching you're feeling you're hearing all of that because you you're gonna miss the fact and the strength that you actually need knowing by faith it's actually happening but i don't see it happening so you're gonna look at an example that this happens so why don't you throw up the video yeah all right so we have a human cell and it's been fertilized and has just split this is just as fertilization and now the cell is splitting you have no clue this is happening this is like within hours 24 hours actually it begins to divide so this has happened within 24 hours of fertilization and every 12 to 15 hours it continues to divide in about five days there's about 100 cells you're saying what's happening i don't see life coming you know what's happening at such a microscopic level you don't know here's about 100 cells and it breaks forth from this coding and this protection it has and these cells now break forth and they implant themselves onto the womb and they actually don't just plant themselves there it actually then goes right into the lining of the membrane and now starts to grow continue to grow and the cells now which called is called gastrulation this is what's happening here and it's going to actually now start splitting and there's different layers of the cells that now start to grow and one layer starts to become you'll see in the little little video one becomes certain aspects of the body a third the middle layer becomes a certain aspect of the body and a bottom layer becomes a certain aspect of the body showing here lungs this is all happening and you have no clue you have no clue that life is in in formation as we as as you're living and you're like where's the problem where is it but it's happening here now you have a teeny teeny little not even an embryo yet this is his brain cells you can see the brain is still open and all the different cells are being formed and they're reaching out to each other and it's kind of now your organogenesis you're seeing the cells form of blood vessels as vessels and cells start going to their their areas of what they're what they're meant to become here's your heart the little little one's heart now beating very early in development he's about at about uh four and a half weeks in or so he's about five a fifth of an inch long in 30 days he's about the size of a red currant and here his little arms now are starting to break forth and butt out from the from the main body organs start to go in place and we have this teeny teeny little aspect of a child that's being formed that's barely even at the at the end of about 60 days they're not even an inch long and a third of an ounce in weight cells start to recede and where it was webbed one time they started to recede and now they're not webbed the cells diminish in certain areas and each cell has a function to play and this teeny little one you say he's like very small it's like this big you have no clue no clue that this is happening [Music] that's incredible i marvel at life i marvel at it and you see something like this how on earth can someone say there's no god how on earth can someone look at that and see the form who tells those cells to go and be an arm who tells that cell to be a blood vessel and go to the brain and form the brain cells who gives it that intelligence you're telling me evolution it's garbage it's god himself that does that who who is what is the life that gives those cells that unction god god amen and a miracle of life it takes his time and all the while someone says i don't my mama doesn't really feel anything and in the first 30 days she has no clue what's really going on but it's happening there's an appointed time of life it's happening even though you might not see it or feel it but god has it ordained and his purpose will come to pass i want you to take that into your own situation say i don't know if you have a need and i'm not seeing it come to pass but maybe it's just like that little one maybe cell upon cell maybe little arm cells maybe little liver cells that little heart starts to pump life is starting to pump just a few weeks deep and some life now is forming and your answer is on the way hallelujah amen all along life is growing inside hallelujah now abraham we're going to step back to our opening scripture abraham been in this waiting period for a long time abraham's been spoke on a lot but it's there because it's eternal god's word is eternal and it wouldn't matter if you've spoken it but i branham spoke talked about preaching on job for a very long time because god's word is eternal you could preach on abraham every service and something would strike your soul you could take the same scripture but it's eternal and so it will do something for you every time so do not do not say well i've heard about abraham over these years many times god's got something for you amen so here he was 25 years in the waiting and it's like nothing was happening and we're just going to walk through that here's 70 janet abraham is 75 years old when he leaves all right genesis 12 i'll make thee a great nation now bless thee thy name make thy name great this is the lord speaking him out bless them that bless thee and curse them that curses thee so he's going to be a great nation here in 12 he's leaving he leaves his family behind he takes lot and his in different ones in his family sarah 65 abraham 75 it's not that they're really young right out of the gates right we're already starting like really a great nation i'm 75. that's not abraham's response that's not his response abraham staggered not at the promise as the scriptures say amen and as far as abraham was concerned the appointed time was now i want you to hold on to that if you walk out of this service and you remember only one thing the appointed time is now my faith is believing for now it might be working and god has an appointed time ahead but your faith is anchoring lord this hour this next day this next minute that's where my faith is and abraham walked with a current faith every step of the way by my appointed time is now amen and so he ran patiently hey man he ran patiently enduring in the face of this you know dismay and questions and whichever doubt i'm sure as we'll get into things that i'm sure were said to him he didn't have it easy but he ran patiently genesis 13 and the lord said our neighbors the lord is speaking to him through the different chapters and said unto abram after lot has separated now lift up thine eyes and look to the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for the land which thou seest i'll give to the end thy seed forever see the promise is again raised up in front of his face and he's still believing amen you've confirmed it again lord and i'm believing it it's today i could have a baby in nine months from today he was he was believing for it current faith unhindered faith for all the land which i'll see us to thee i will i give thee thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth thy seed shall also be numbered he was getting a lofty promise a lofty promise and he was drinking it in he was drinking it kept believing hey man he continued to live he continued to fight because now he had to go down he had to go get lot out and what if he died i got a promise i'm going now why could he take his 318 men because he knew i got a lot of seed coming i've got a mighty nation that i'm promised so guess what lord i'm coming to get you and my 318 trained servants and i'm going to take the kings and annihilate them and bring bring you back because he was promised a mighty nation and mighty seed so my he could he could go with quite caught with some serious confidence genesis 15. after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward abram said lord god what will doubt give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is eliezer of damascus and abraham abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he shall come forth out of thine own bowels and shall be thine air oh thank you lord he reaffirmed it again oh god where's where's the promise it's coming i've got to heir for you out of your own bowels amen lord and so he kept going current faith again he kept going a staggering knot at the promise it was an appointed time amen current always looking so here he goes and we hit chapter 16. chapter 16 is where we have sarah saying listen i'm not having a child take hagar anytime you inject your own thoughts or your own ideas into god's plan you're gonna get an ishmael any time and it brings disruption oh does it bring disruption never inject our own idea never well i don't know what god promised it and abraham staggered naught at it he didn't even know how it happened and here sarah and i was saying hey just to take agar it isn't going to be me it's going to be haggard it's not your scene no that was not the perfect plan that was not the perfect way and here hagar he's 86 he's 86. okay we've been like 11 years that he's been staggering not 11 years letter brown says and sarah even to who the promised sarah being a woman which is the type of the church gave doubt to the original program of god's promised word you abraham my husband take under this beautiful maid and be her husband and god will give this seat a promise through her and i'll take the child bypassing one little i o to change the whole program he said therefore we've got to take every word of god as thus saith the lord every word of god don't mix it don't bring in man's that's why that's why this message came and you drew a fine straight dividing line if it was the word that's the word if it's man's ideas if it's on baptism serpent seed i don't care what it is if there's just something a little bit off it's an iota off and it's of the devil himself and it's there to disrupt the plan of god and sarah thinking that god would not be able to keep all his promises true oh my i highlighted that and sarah thinking that god would not be able to keep all his promise true and so she told abraham to take hagar lord help us not to doubt in the power of our god she actually doubted that he couldn't fulfill that promise my goodness and god it got a lot of issues out of it got an ishmael out of that careful one little aspect of our thought major major mess and you combine your direction things think things going to work the plan of god i said be careful because you might have an ishmael on your hands and brother braham says two wives doubted the promise he's talking about hagar and he goes but what kind of man was he the bible said speaking of ishmael was a wild man lived by his bow no man would conquer him untamable unconvertible and unregenerated he could not be tamed and that's exactly what would happen to your own ideas or what comes out of it it's untameable it's unconvertible because it's it's it's been combined you've mixed the word of god with your own ideas and it's just like that it would not be tamed and it's wild a wild thought and anything that's contrary any preacher any lame member any church that's contrary to god's word will bring forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly hollywood who can't not stay with the unadulterated word because it's not even included in the promise that's as straight as it gets moral the story stay with the word that's where it is you don't want that you do need not need someone coming in with sarah doubting are you coming in with the devil throwing in some thoughts doubting the promise no sir nothing anything contrary that will bring forth an adulterous bunch of worldly hollywood don't mix your ideas and water things down well i think i could do that and you know it's okay to to listen to these kind of things it's okay to watch that kind of thing it's an adulterous bunch of hollywood stay away from it genesis 17 again god speaks and says it's coming and abraham's got current faith he is believing that it's coming as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name more be called abram now he's getting a name changed but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and god then says about sarah and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her now he's reconfirming it more i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations all right and so abraham now is is continually saying god helping him maybe he's dropping a word it's coming the promise is coming you're anchored your faith is holding on to it lord i believe you i believe you come you've brought me this far you've kept me this far i'm still believing you have a promise my sons my daughters my healing whatever it is i believe it i believe it but there is gonna come a point in time an appointed time in season in genesis 18 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and here's now abraham brother brown says a hot day it wasn't an easy time he says perhaps a lot of complaints been coming in lately from the herdsmen grass is all gone it's hot grass has dried up land is drying up the cattle's very thin water supply is about gone it found water hole in the holes but now it got so low they're trying to dig it out of the out of the ground where the water was seeping through the rocks the cattle still didn't have enough water and it was a tough time and he's hearing all this and he goes to his tent door and sits down brother bram says many times we see disastrous things happening like that especially to believers we must bear this in our mind it's satan trying to block the blessing that's on the road glory you see that happening all the troubles and strife and this is going on and this is going on this is battering your mind and your weight down oh god what's going on in this situation what's happening in this situation this is happening in my home oh what and he goes to his tent and he sits down but abram says he's probably praying and he said just just think it's just satan trying to block the blessing that's on the road same was trying to tempt them to feel that they'd done wrong let's let's think he goes let's he goes let's think that sarah being that she'd done what she did let's think she was kind of a little fussy that morning i love brother brennam's when he goes into the details my goodness it's beautiful fussy that morning she says you know abraham you know the supplies are getting low here and herdsmen says the patches are all dried up and the water holes and i think you made the wrong decision when you chose to come up here and let lot and mrs law and their family live down there with plenty while the other day or some time ago rather i went to the city and missed lot and had one of the prettiest dresses i ever seen it was styled by them egyptians and while a camel caravan came through and she got new styles there's just no such thing as them caravans and styles coming through here not up in the dry plains of mammary don't begin to rise on the things of this land right we don't belong here we don't belong in this life of ease and trying to make it easier on us this is not our home a man i'm just passing through i'm not looking at the passions of the egyptians or the fashions of wherever in france and who who knows who cares where and here brother bradman is giving a little insight he's saying maybe you made the wrong call maybe this isn't where we should be maybe we should have gone somewhere else it's real tough work out here trying to make a living and he's sitting now here praying at his tent not an easy morning anybody have those kind of mornings sometimes or sunday mornings right things is to get all fussy right because you're coming but there's a blessing on its way you're coming to church you're coming to service and satan's fighting you hard because he knows there's something down the road for you amen look at the spiritual realm don't look at this natural realm all these difficulties it's hard i get it i live there too i'm human i got flesh and blood it worries our minds but it's look up for your redemption draw of nigh let's get our eyes off this land get our eyes off these troubles and say god get me out of here [Music] my but she knowed butter brown says but if she just knowed if she just know there was more than a caravan coming through oh my she just knowed what was coming down the way just a little down the path around the bend that she couldn't see she's all fussing and wondering and worrying but down the road was something more than a caravan there was a host of the lord coming their way glory my goodness just around the corner could be the host of the lord that angel's been striving he's been fighting against the prince of persia and he's coming to give you your answer hold on don't fuss it it's coming your way and little poor abraham faithful brother didn't shake him one bit glory amen how we don't get all fussed up not shaking thought abraham says he gets in his chair sits down i see the old faithful servant bows his head maybe sarah a little fussy but he just let it go and he began to think back now here's here's a here's a little truth here's a nugget for you and he began to think back in the thick of the troubles sarah might have been all right she was all she was right the herds were having issues the grass was drying up there wasn't this wasn't false stuff but it wasn't shaken abraham won't shake sons and daughters of god that's what the word comes for to girl us up and he says but abraham says he began to think back how many great blessings god has given me he started to encourage himself in what god has done for him you get in that moment and all that fussing and all the issues of life you just take a step back you take your seat you put it by your doorway you sit down and don't you get on it yeah that's right oh that's brutal how do how are we going to get through that you sit down say wow all the goodness god has done for me all the blessings he's given me look at my home he saved me he's kept me back there he healed me back there he delivered me here he delivered my son here he healed my wife that's what he pondered on there he led me there he provided my herds with when i was in need that's what abraham pondered on oh the blessings of the lord amen and here is he's doing that as he's in his mind he's worshipping and he's praising the lord in his thoughts and he's encouraging himself in what god had done for him and here he looks up and lifts up his eyes and who is coming his way lo three men coming down when he saw them look at the thoughts he was in he was already in an atmosphere he was already in the presence of god so when he looked up and he saw god himself coming down the pathway with two mighty angels he ran forward and what did he do the scripture says he ran to meet them from the tent and bowed himself on the ground and worshipped him glory when you're in that situation then you're pondering what god has been doing get up then and run to him and worship him first [Applause] hallelujah bow down to the crown say oh god i'm needy but you are the great one set my knees aside put them behind me at first i'm gonna give you the praise that first and foremost i'm gonna honor you for you're the king of glory you're the great i am you're the rose of sharon oh god i adore you and that's where abraham went that's how his encounter began was in worship when god came his way amen hallelujah [Music] oh he said my lord my lord if i found favor and thy side pass not away oh cleave to his feet god don't go past me don't just come and come by say hi abraham oh god he said pass not away oh my i say if you reach out tonight god coming by your way tonight say i need to i've come out i'm running for my tent i'm running from my door god is coming by there's an appointed time for me fall down and speak tonight and say god don't pass me by hallelujah hallelujah this is your time hallelujah and now the promise is drawing nigh to abraham the promise is drawing nigh he's been holding his faith he's been steadfast this whole time but little does he know like that mama didn't know something was growing inside of her cell upon cell but there's now coming a time something it's very near to where he's gonna feel it hallelujah is anything too hard for god oh sir now the promise comes once more and abraham worships him worships the lord communes with him breaks bread brings a calf bake some cakes and they commute around the fire and this in our opening scripture god then it says again the promise once more but now it's a little more detail now it's a little more detail i had the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life so it's now narrowed down a little bit it's not just out there but now with the time appointed all right lord you have an appointed time okay at the time of life and so now abraham is he's now he's his faith is rising up a little bit more now and the promise to him has come and the appointed time was right around the corner right around the corner you know there's a right place in the right time and as we said don't settle for ishmael we need isaac wrong place wrong time right wrong time and wrong person hagar wrong time but here we had abraham with hagar was actually the right seed but it was wrong place his wrong womb at the wrong time abraham was sarah all past right seat right womb wrong time there was an appointed time for a pointed season don't rush god's plan just stay in it abraham stayed in it he staggered not he was running patiently but then the appointed time came to pass amen everything now was in place for the promise to now move forward amen and impatiently they were enduring but now now the appointed time life was now coming forth hallelujah there's an appointed time that god has an and your faith may it be so fervently anchored that it could be the next day it could be the next hour and there abraham at some point then we'll get to it here we won't get ahead of ourselves i'm going to ask you do you think abraham had mind battles all right so now when you sing father abraham had many abraham staggered not for 20 years he had mind battles too just like you do he was 99 when this moment happened he was 86 or so with ishmael and from 86 to 99 with ishmael my goodness i can only imagine how he must have kicked himself man goodness what does it do how often would he have con felt the condemnation you jesus got outside of the promises satan would come there and hit him and hit him hard you think that happened happens to you it happened to him but he ran patiently he staggered not at the promise of course satan's gonna come of course he's gonna try to put condemnation on you of course he's gonna throw the thoughts on you but stag or not oh my my goodness what do you think his camp was saying all about it he's been saying he's the father of many nations he's been holding the promise in front of him and hear that what do you think the campus said well now you have an ishmael here and who's leading you abraham you know it's been like 15 16 years and you got an ishmael all the cheated chatter come on what a mistake he made put in your circles you know the chatter you know what's in your mind you know you know you know what you lived through but ram says speaking about abraham when he said come out from amongst the people he says think of it doubters unbelievers they'll they'll have you in the same fix come out and separate yourself he said leave all your conscience and your senses behind like that open your mind and remember me come live with me speak with abraham coming out but he goes god's calling abra every seed of abraham this morning to the same kind of life great battle is on now worldwide god wants his children separating themselves from what see taste smell here imaginations conscience memories reasons affections everything set it aside abraham had to set it aside whatever that is i'm staying in the promise god has promised i might have he might have made a hiccup there but he didn't waver from it he says i'm moving on from it i'm running patiently now you know faith has no hindrances i read this quote last service brother brown says faith holds on faith holds it it wields it he says now you may not be strong enough he says that arm of faith to cut a hole all the way somebody might have some great big large faith and just rock and there's a big hole in this in in the situation he goes but he goes all and walk through it some candy goes but just keep punching just keep puncting you might be able to wield some big strong arm and whack it and make a big hole but give it a speed bag and that beat by beat you're going to keep put you're going to put a little hole in there you just give the devil make him a speed bag hang him right there hang him in here hang his doubt right in front of you every morning get into prayer get your faith going you might not have the big monster arm whap but you might have enough little faith to rattle that speed bag rattle that devil amen but without faith it doesn't say without great faith it just says without faith you've got mustard seed faith that's all you need to move mountains without faith it's impossible to please him all right for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen you ain't coming to him on your affection or on your imagination you come to him on faith in his word amen well i don't feel good today feelings that's how we're coming it's a hindrance i tried but it just didn't work out you know i tried and never nothing happened memory cast aside well what if it just doesn't happen this time and this and this could happen imagination cast it aside amen if he doesn't agree with the word get rid of it abraham had to do the same thing i'm sure he had a whole lot of doubts he had a whole lot of opportunities for people to give him some reasons too but he had to set it aside i'm seeking a city who's builder maker is god he's making me a mighty nation god spoke to him god speak to you anchor on it mine may your faith rise i was thinking and we mentioned again but i just wanted to ponder just mention it this service as well thinking of that little lady who came before jesus verbum says she had many hindrances this little greek woman and fate and but her faith didn't have any as we said faith don't have hindrances nothing can hinder faith lots of things can be hindered you can be shaken away at your memory and it can rattle but faith is not rattlable it i don't care what random says don't care what anybody else says nothing hinders it let let's see he says some of these mites that could have happened to her she was a greek not even a jew and you can imagine she would have been very scorned scorned in the crowd what is she even doing there she would have been a misfit in that area being a greek in that in the jewish crowd and brother brown says but even when she got there jesus said i'm not even sent to your race this is better brown's words i'm not even sent to your race and besides they that they are nothing but a bunch of dogs oh my come on dude i know we've read the scripture you've read the story but dear goodness put yourself in the shoes and put your personality there put you put you there and say you're a dog and i'm not even coming to your race in this day and age that should hit home come on now but nothing your feelings your affections your ideas of what the culture aspects of the day it don't care what it is her faith is what was unhinderable oh my what would that have done what would you have done ask yourself that and be honest somebody snubbed why if you don't even get prayed for the first night you claim you ain't coming back no more this is better brandon saying that he says oh if i don't get prayed for fine then then you've got faith he says yeah now remember this tape goes all over the world i'm just not pointing my finger here i'm pointing it everywhere he says no he says no you can't even sit and listen to the meeting through you see yeah i've got faith and you can't even sit through a meeting or lots of faith this is your prophet what if she had stopped what if she hadn't pressed what if she had she had what if she hadn't worked to the crowds as we said in the scripture from last service you ran well but what hindered you as we were speaking but she didn't she was running with patience it didn't really matter what the obstacle was she had that stick-to-itiveness it was her faith that was unhinderable like abraham who said there's a time appointed for me and i'm pressing in it with my faith that i'm gonna go forward i don't really care what he calls me i don't care if i'm a greek i don't go to your race all she cared she said lord yay lord but even the dogs get the crumbs is that your faith tonight i just need a crumb god i don't really care of the situation but my faith is reaching well i'm going to be people are going to call you names if you follow him but abram goes on he says oh well you go to that church your family's going to leave you oh i follow that you follow that man jesus and mock you and scorn you nothing nothing hindered her she could have been the only greek there and that was probably was but there she was pressing through it all with patient faith reaching through and obtaining the promise amen amen now i'm have to gird up my loins for this next part because i either go by really fast or you shut her down lord help me i'll just come to uh work our way to a close here wow i love his word it goes by too fast up here i sure hope it's not dragging down there glory glory amen amen isaiah 9 6 said a virgin shall conceive and it sat there for a long time dormant nothing was happening so it seemed nothing was happening but waiting for an appointed time when that word that was spoken by a prophet would land on the correct betting ground it went forth through time and there had to be a seed in this person and that person that this wasn't quite right so god was guiding the lineages guiding where was he had a purpose in mind he had appointed time i'll tell you what he had appointed time he had appointed time for life jesus christ was to come on the scene in flesh and he's like i gotta work this out i've spoken my word but there's somebody that's gonna receive it with a with a betting ground of faith that's gonna believe exactly what i've said amen and mary received that word into her womb but abram speaks about into her virgin mind into her womb and received it first in her mind and believed it and then it started to work inside of her amen brings forth and what did it bring forth but it brought forth christ brother brahma says mary by no relationship at all but believe the promised word when she was a virgin knowing no man and the angel lord met her hail mary blessed art thou amongst the women for god is with me and she's like how is these things how shall these things be shiva said she was actually troubled troubled my goodness she said an angel lord said the holy ghost shall overshadow you it had never been done in the ages this wasn't like well you know i could see it happen before there you know oh so-and-so was healed of cancer there and so i can point back and draw strength from that no no it had never happened before she was believing something that was completely undone it was never transpired a virgin shall conceive never done in the ages but mary believed god amen mary believed god and she said behold the handmaid of the lord amen he said but here she's asked to believe that a contribution to the faith that was in abraham who believed the impossible as long as god said so that makes it right glory the appointed time for life was now coming amen but it needed a vessel it needed a vessel that could believe the impossible god needs a vessel that will believe the impossible i don't have time to go through it but there is an appointed time there was a word that came down the ages and god is looking for a virgin bride that will receive his word because the eve fell and doubted and sarah and hagar and all the types through but god said there will be a bride at an appointed time my goodness who's that it's a people that can receive the impossible and believe it well you know satan they'll all laugh at you little rosy cheek girl they'll laugh and you say oh yeah you're the bride you're going to be in a rapture you're going to be the spoken word who's the original seed uh-huh that's exactly who i am oh but they'll all laugh at you it don't really matter i ain't paying attention to it i don't have any plan to stay here right and up in judea she went you know i'm going to have a baby and before she left felt anything before she felt anything that was happening the womb was being stirred the holy ghost had planted a seed and an egg of the holy ghost and it was starting to move and she didn't feel a thing i'm having a baby because the word had already been set there you are for ordained before the foundation of the world there's a seed inside of you it's been their pre-plan and when the word of the hour came across your path it ignited something and it started to work it started to grow so i don't feel nothing you might have been in this bits of sin and then someone dropped a book or someone spoke something and something started to grow life started to grow started to manifest and at some point it started you started to see it amen glory amen better read yes sir that's where we are today lord be it unto me according to your word oh my brother brown says i don't care what i'm called has nothing to do with it oh if people could really from your heart all of us could say see be it unto me according to thy word that's a big line oh mary said be according to me she was walking out of there going to be scorned and ridiculed for the rest of her life it wasn't like today where someone has a illegitimate child people don't bat an eye wasn't so then death death be it unto me according to your will put yourself there death i could be stoned be it unto me i don't know he just told me that that he i would conceive of the holy ghost it's his word it's hit gabriel came and spoke to her my goodness be it unto me you say well if i had an angel like gabriel the mighty angel the son of man revealed through a son of man came and spoke to you and me yes sir be it unto me according to thy word o god hallelujah hallelujah we are not in the dormant years of isaiah 9 6 to mary's day as it was in the days of lot was spoken the scriptures as it was in the days of noah who spoke in scriptures we aren't at the beginning of isaiah 9 6 where it was 400 years until mary we are at the revealing of the son of man he has been revealed we are here at this day it isn't dormant anymore it hasn't been sitting there for hundreds of years we're at a very different time i wrote news flash it ain't dormant this isn't dormant seed oh sorry because when elohim appeared the promise was moments away when elohim came before abraham it was just around the corner in fact what happened we talk a lot about abraham and him staggering not of the promise but i want to tell you i can just imagine what would have happened when elohim left sodom was burned but guess what was happening up on the plains of mammary a little tinkling started happening in sarah about 30 days hence uh-huh i'm feeling a little different you are uh uh-huh things started to change i can imagine the next nine months were pure joy in that in that tent in that camp abraham was moving around i believed him and there's a promise it was growing it was growing a little bit more it was going on every day and he was really come on there was a lot of rejoicing as the word was manifesting itself and there's the same amount of rejoicing because this day when this word has been revealed to this hour it's growing and manifesting at harvest time there's a maturing going on and the word of god the seed has entered the wood of a virgin bride and it's manifesting time hallelujah it's happening inside you saints god is being manifested through his bride in this last day the song we've caught the revelation amen what to produce the word the pure word of god hallelujah [Music] this is the appointed time for life god's word has manifested itself in this day and he's given us everything we need every promise in the book is ours it's been manifested before us it's been shown before us the same god that abraham that brought foreseed the same god oh my i was thinking and i had in my notes of georgie carter how she waited for nine years and six months and brother brandon went through that poor little thing she said was ravished at a piano lesson my goodness and here she went and got tb and was in a bed for nine years but there was an appointed time there was a time when god was coming back on the scene for her she was praying desire i want to be baptized i want to be baptized that little girl named nail and here she was god moved on a prophet and here she came he came at the appointed time oh my may that be here tonight say lord i am crying out i have a need in my soul i have a need of my body i don't care what it is but lord jesus is here on the scene i pray oh god the same pillar of fire that was there but back in brother branham's day that's here in this day in every church message church he's the same god may he be present here today oh my the time has come saints brother branham says gospel

miraculous is taking place it has to we're at the junction we're at the junction the time is here don't just sit still and say well you know maybe it's not today it's today the time is now the time

god's word has been revealed if we are saying we are the word bride made manifest that word inside of us is manifesting speak the word hallelujah hallelujah help us lord help us lord let's not miss our moment like sarah who's back there and missing what god was doing and right in front of her can i have a baby i can't i mean i'm old and here was elohim himself saying you're gonna have a son

god you have what on your heart you rise and claim it tonight i don't come to wednesday night i don't come to sunday morning just to sit around and listen to some preachers speak loudly i pray that god comes and he speaks something to your heart you've been holding it there lord i've had a promise lord i've been holding on to something i've been holding on to my kids i've been holding on to my healing i say stagger not like abraham for the appointed time has come oh god hallelujah heavenly father tonight holy spirit move amongst us lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh god brother branham says oh so shall i be in the coming of the son of man god help us wake up the day of hesitation is here you say god don't send angels no more he says the holy spirit is that angel he says the holy spirit is that person the holy spirit jesus said he the holy ghost when he comes he'll do the works that he did he'd be in us even with us he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught us and would show us things to come the works that i do ye shall do also that's the time he says we're living in we're living in that time oh god hallelujah glory glory glory jesus jesus jesus whatever you desire from us tonight lord what if you desire for us tonight lord jesus oh that life he says the life you cannot hide life if there's something in your soul there's something deep down you can't put concrete on it that little blade of grass because when the s-o-n of god starts to shine down there's something starts to bubble up he says you cannot hide it hallelujah of that seed inside of you when it comes in contact with the s-o-n he says it it starts to burst forth like that little living breathing cells those cells start to compound and the son of god this word goes on top and it starts to grow and burst forth oh may the promise of god so strike your soul tonight may it become a reality that your faith anchors on the promise of god help us o god yes lord hallelujah lord hallelujah

different pathways that god had led him in and he'd just be saying it's already done the promise is here my family is sealed i have a son already it's already done oh my goodness i'm sure that song and those words were anchored in his heart he could come back and say there was an appointed time where it came to pass hold on a little while longer let's sing it now oh it's already done [Music]
