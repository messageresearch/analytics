TRANSCRIPT
========================================
One by one they chose to die the son of God. They would not deny that like a great angelic wise. I can almost hear their voicees ring. I pledge alle with all my strength and with all I am. I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge allegiance to the land. Now the years have come. Now the years have come and the years have gone. But the cause of Jesus still goes on. And now our time has come to count the cost, to reject this world, to embrace the cross. For one by one, let us live our lives. For the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that final day. Let us proud he stand and oh say that I pledge allegiance to the land. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb to the lamb of God. To the one who bore my pain, who took my place in all my shame and seek to honor the king's command. I pledge alceence to the land. The journey that we travel is a winding narrow road. And there are times we stumble or contained a heavy load. Always there's a voice to tell you you'll never make it in. Reminding you of all your failures and longforgotten sin. 1097. You know within your heart God's blood has washed you white as snow. Still in your mind the battle rages and redens all. Amen. But even if you're pushed but even if you're pushed beyond where you feel you feel you can stand. Just remember you can put your faith. You can put in God's unfailing hand. Unfailing hand. You may bend. You may be. But you won't break. And you may stumble and even feel you've lost your way. But you won't fall. Cause remains. You won't be bound. My broken chains, you can be bound. My broken. Amen. Sing the next verse if you know him. Even though and even though a thousand storms may rage against your life, you will find a resting place. Will find a resting place within the arms of Christ. Hallelujah. We've risen far beyond. We've risen far beyond the realms of lying circumstance. when nothing formed against this bride will ever stand a chance. Now you don't have to listen. Now you don't have to listen when that voice says you. Amen. For God's ordained that you and I. For God's ordained that you and I should walk in liberty. Hallelujah. Amen. Freedom's been proclaimed. Freedom's been proclaimed to all the captive at the bound. And in Jesus name. Amen. You can hear those chains fall broken to the ground. Fall broken to the ground. Oh, fall broken to the ground. You may be but you won't break and you may stumble. Oh, and even feel you lost your way, but you won't fall. God's word remains. You won't be bound. My broken chains you can't be bound by broken chasing the course again. You may bend. You may bend, but you won't break. And you may stumble. Oh, and even feel you've lost your way. My broken chains you can be found. One more time. Broken chains. Oh, you baby, but you and you may stumble. Oh, and even you lost your way, but you won't fall. God's word, I know his word made you found. My broken chains, you can't be bound. My broken chains. Hallelujah. You're a free people this evening. Amen. God bless you, saints. Welcome to the service tonight. Amen. We just have a very full evening tonight. Many of the specials that wanted to be sung and we'll just get to those that we can. And I trust that you'll forgive us if we don't call you this evening. And why don't you stand with me, we're going to turn the pulpit to our pastor. Amen. And just before we do that, I'd like to sing together, fill my cup, Lord. We're going to take the offering a little bit later, so we'll just hold off on that for now. Amen. But I just wanted to sing sing an old song of prayer and consecration. It's my desire tonight that the Lord would fill my cup once again. We know the prophet told us that if there's a desire in your heart for more of God, then there's more of God for you to have. Amen. I just want another drink from the fountain tonight. Amen. Let's sing this together as our pastor would come then. Oh, fill my cup, Lord, for I lift it up, Lord. Oh, come and quench, quench this thirsting of my soul. Oh bread of heaven, just feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Once again, let's just ask it in a prayer now. Oh, fill my cup, Lord, for I lift it up. Lord, please come and quench. Quench this thirsting of my soul. Oh bread of heaven. Feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me. The words of that course very much express what was in my heart last night. I was impacted by the word. In fact is I said to my wife, we'll go home tomorrow. I didn't tell her why, but I just wanted to be alone. I just wanted to think about the service last night. And after the activities of the day, I was concerned that some of you young people or a lot of you may be so tired and wearied and you be sleepy during the service. But I I want to compliment you. You were so &gt;&gt; aware, so alert, so eager, so pulling on the word. And our brother Ron Spencer was certainly inspired by the Holy Ghost and spoke to many many hearts. I just uh looked at the uh number of you that were here filling the whole front of the service and I I was thanking God &gt;&gt; that others were spoken to. I saw one stand over here, then another one, then one over here, and someone over here. And finally, many of you, if not all, were standing. And I want to say the music continues. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make any difference what happens. And uh last night while brother Spencer I believe was praying just at the at the reading of the word and began to uh pray for brother Ken Ber in Calgary. And brother Ken Ber has had a a tumor on his uh on his face or on his brain and he was very very ill, very sick and in his bed in the bed and he was very very sick. Brother Ken Boyer's father-in-law and mother-in-law are here tonight. Brother Meadow Fzen, pastor in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Brother Meadow, we're going to ask you if you'd come up and and offer prayer and also thanksgiving. We have some prayer requests here. I'd like you to pray for this service. Pray that God uh will come and meet you individually. We prayed for brother Ken Ber last night. Brother Fzen tells me he was up walking today and uh has he gone home? &gt;&gt; He's home. &gt;&gt; He's home. &gt;&gt; He never left home. &gt;&gt; We just pray that God will continue. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; A deacon is here, Brother Gindo. Emanuel Gindo, he sent me an email not just a few weeks ago and he said, "My wife has been confirmed to have leukemia. I wish to bring her up to the front of the church and have you, brethren, pray for her." And just a few weeks ago, we prayed for sister Francine Gindo. It was her Sharon was her daughter is his daughter that sang also on night before last. But let me tell you friends, this is not just a ceremony. &gt;&gt; This is not something that brother Gindo had to do, but he wanted to do it. It was in his heart to do it. the God of this message is a living God to him &gt;&gt; and to his wife. And so they brought her up and went back to the same doctor and they cannot find a trace of leukemia in her blood. I can tell you friends, we're a very happy group of people and I personally am very happy. I'm happy for the Gindo family. I must say that perhaps I don't have the same level of faith as they had. But they said, he said, I want to bring her up and she'll be delivered from this. And I was trying to give the testimony tonight. And he said, that's what we did. There's nothing. There's no trace of it. I say, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And that God, I believe, will speak through our brother, our brother Ron Spencer tonight. And I believe he'll speak directly to your heart and directly to your cry. And if we are calling out to God and I must say, I am I'm calling out to God for specific things and say, "Oh God, if you'll just do this for me, I will be so thankful. I'm glad for the servant of God. I'm glad for the message of the hour." And for those of you that have played the original uh believers when they sang as believers and cut several records, our brother Ben Freezen is one of the that were singing. But I can tell you he's still singing another song in spite of the sickness of his son-in-law and the answer of God to the need of that prayer. I don't know how many people are praying. I'm sure they're praying from all over the world, but tonight, Brother Fzen, we're happy and thankful that you're here. Please, if you'll just pray for us. &gt;&gt; We're glad to be here. &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; We're glad to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Fzen says he's happy to be here. God bless you. We're happy to have you. Thank you for your &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you so much for praying for Brother Ken. Uh just got a text today. They've been keeping us posted and um uh he was up and went downstairs and he was uh he's one of those uh gentlemen that has a real strong bull faith. He kind of took the approach that Esther took when she went before the king. She said, "If I perish, I perish, but I will not I will do my duty." and Ken's that way is strong and I thank you so much for your prayers and around the world people have been praying but above all I thank the Lord for hearing the prayer &gt;&gt; he's the one that hears the smallest humble &gt;&gt; cry we're good so glad to be here today this my first time ever this way and u it's good to be here &gt;&gt; you know give me a key of key of D you mind &gt;&gt; to the fame He giveth power through the mountain and makes the way and define it. The waters in the desert turns the night to golden day. And I know, yes, I know that Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean and I know. Yes, I know. Jesus blood made the vile sinners and in temptation he is near thee turns the path hell leads me to the past and he gives gives me grace for every day. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vent sinner clean. And I know. Yes, I know Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we thank you so much that we can mimic and say these words. &gt;&gt; What you said, I am the Lord God. I change not. &gt;&gt; I am the word and my word can never change. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will never pass away. It will accomplish that which I send it for. Lord, how thankful we are tonight to be in this kind of an atmosphere where your spirit is present, where you're here to hear the slightest murmur. &gt;&gt; They might not be able to speak it, but you already know what lays in their heart. Father, we thank you for your healing virtue, but above all, we thank you for redeeming us. For the covenant is the same. Whether to take up thy bed and walk or thy sins be forgiven thee. They are the same covenant and we are forgiven. We thank you so much. But more than forgiven justified as if we never did it. How we thank you tonight Lord for your grace. Bless the continuation of these this meeting this weekend. Bless tonight's p as our brother speaks. Lord, it takes that both speaking and hearing that one union. Bless all the exercise of all the saints in the nature tonight and that have been read and we thank you so much for brother Ken how you've raised him up today he's already walking and out of his bed and he's walking and sitting in his chair Lord and begin to speak again his voice was gone but he begin to speak again how we thank you Lord how marvelous how wonderful how glorious you are &gt;&gt; thank you for hearing the prayer as we just heard the testimony &gt;&gt; how you love to walk among the midst of the people &gt;&gt; being glorified in the presence of your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your name. &gt;&gt; To you be the praise and the glory forever and ever. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my savior love for me. Amen. You may have your seats. Sister Naomi, fair the weather. Why don't you come at this time? We're going to have you sing a special for us and we'll take up the offering after that if the brothers would like to prepare. And maybe as she comes, let's just sing that course. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. Amen. You're justified. I'm justified. I'm justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. You're justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're just one more time. Justified. Oh, justify. Oh, justify. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. You're justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. I Some folks I know by their name. Some I just know their face. Some are known by their fame. Others are known by their race. But in the kingdom of our Lord, each soul has its place. And in my mind, I have no doubt by name. I've been called out. And we've been called out for a purpose. Called out to be a servant. Call out to live the standard. He called you out to raise the better. Call out to be a witness. Called out to show forgiveness. Call out from the world. child. You've been called out within the prison walls. That day, the jailers bound up their feet, stripped off their garments. There they lay, bleeding from where they were be. Then along about midnight, Paul began to pray. Silence started to sing. The earth shook all about the door swung open wide. Been called out and we've been called out for a purpose. Called out to be served. Been called out to the standard. We called you out to raise the better. Call out to be a witness. Called out to show forgiveness. He called us out from the world. Child, you've been called out cuz we've been called out for a purpose. called out to be a servant. Called out to live the standard. He called you out to raise a better call out to heal witness. Call out to show forgiveness. Call down from the world. Child, you've been called out. You've been called out from the world. Child, you've been called out. Amen. Maybe we could just stand for a moment. We're going to invite the brothers to come. Take the morning or the evening offering, excuse me. And we're going to turn the service to our brother Tim. And why don't just play bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy name, Eflat. We did have a prayer request that I didn't get to earlier. I beg your pardon. We is a request that we please pray for brother Paul Neighbor as he had had eye surgery yesterday and she's asking for a healing touch from the Lord and that God be with him as he recovers. And have you been blessed so far in the meeting, saints? Amen. I trust that God blesses you in your giving tonight and continues to minister to you. Just as we turn the service to our brother Tim, let's just sing this chorus together. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, for he has done great things. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy, bless his holy name. Once again, bless the Lord. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul and all that is within me. Bless his holy, bless his holy name, for he has done great things. Oh, for he has done great things. For he has done great things. For he has done great things. Bless his holy name. Amen. And has he done great things? &gt;&gt; What a tremendous camp meeting we are having. It's hard to believe we're already here on Saturday night. We want to take up an offering. The we took an offering last night for the ministry and show our appreciation for the ministry. But you can't have a meeting like this. You know, we may charge fees for food and for accommodation, but you can't have a tent and equipment like this without renting it and supplying it and everything. And there's all kinds of expenses to go with it. But I'll go further. Brother Brham says you can't have a meeting without giving the people an opportunity to give towards the meeting. that's a part of our worship. And uh he said, "I tried to do that one time. I tried to have somebody sponsor the whole thing and no offering was taken." He said, "It was the most failure of the meeting that I ever had because there's something in it that the people have to give towards it." And so we want to do that tonight. We want to give our offering as a form of worship towards the expenses of these meetings. And we also want to give as worship unto the Lord. So, let's bow our heads together as we commit this to the Lord and remember this prayer request tonight. Wonderful heavenly father, Lord, there's none like you, oh God, and we could just spend the rest of the evening just thanking you for what you have already done. So many great things individually that you have moved amongst the people. You have touched my heart. I know. And Lord, you know how you've dealt with me. And Lord, I know that there's many in hearing their testimonies, how you've dealt with them, things that have been restored, people that have been healed, lives that have been delivered from the hand of the enemy. And we give you praise and honor and glory for that. And Lord, we want you to continue tonight. We want you to take the preeminence once more. Take Brother Ron into your hands. Lord, may you glorify yourself through the vessel that has been anointed to take this service tonight. We want to yield ourselves. And Lord, we're remembering our brother Paul Neighbor tonight as the request has come in. He's had some surgery on his eyes and he needs Lord a healing touch from you. A doctor can operate, but there's only one healer and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. And we ask Lord that your healing virtue that was loosed at Calvary would come to our brother Paul even right now. Lord Jesus, may he sense your hand upon his life and every other need that's represented here. Lord, may you meet each need. And Father, as we give what we can give, we ask, Lord, that you'll take our offering. We lift it unto you as a form of worship. And we pray, Lord, that it would be pleasing in your sight. And may you use it for your glory. and may you bless all of the labors that have gone into these meetings. We love you, Lord, and we commit it to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats as we take up the offering. Let's continue to sing that together. And just before we turn the pulpit to our brother Ron, I'm going to ask for brother Seriel to come and prepare to sing for us, please. Bless the Lord. Amen. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord once again. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless his holy name. For he has done great things. I know that he has done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things. Bless his holy name. Amen. We did have one announcement from brother Matthew Redell. Starting on Monday, October 13th to Saturday, August 18th, the Lynen Fair witness and outreach booth will be set up and open to all who are convinced of the wonderful gospel and end time message and concerned for all those who need the Lord. So, please contact Brother Matthew for additional details and days and shifts you you would like to be available. Amen. We always look forward to that time. We'll be remembering those who will be serving at the booth. Come, brother Sarah. And then afterwards, we will turn the pulpit to our brother Ron. Are you for the and me the be love when you make me so for me corre. Cru s the Lord. Oh s be your foreign. B Cru leave us tendra. for me corre. in the cruise soul. Oh, is be loose. pre. Disreg. Amen. Can we sing that chorus together as our brother Ron comes? I claim the blood. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those precious blood stains were made there just for me. for all my sins, my sickness, and my I claim the blood. Let's stand as we receive brother. I claim the blood. Jesus glory. Most precious days were just for me. My sickness and my heat. We thank the Lord Jesus for a wonderful time, haven't we? &gt;&gt; I don't know what to expect, saints. I really don't. We've gone to mark the spot for service. Morning service when kings come out to war. Second service. Third service. Can't hurt this music sheet. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Music's going to come through. That hurts. &gt;&gt; This morning, we heard a message. He was there all the time. I don't know what the Holy Spirit has planned for this evening, but I'm just so happy to be here because he's got me in mind. And you must well, you might as well say, "Well, he's got me in mind, too, brother Tom. God put you here. I didn't put you here. And so now we're here to rejoice in the presence of the king, to look not to a man, but to look to the vessel himself, the God that's in the vessel, that the Holy Spirit will have his way. David said, "My cup runth over." Now young people, I want you to know I've been around a few years now and I have been into a lot of meetings, but I want to say through this set of meetings, my cup runth over. And may your cup run over tonight, whatever you desire when you pray, ask and you shall receive it. I believe the Holy Spirit has been from the beginning of the camp and it will be till the end of the camp. And we want to welcome those that have been uh coming to this camp over the last few days to see you here. It's nice to see you. You've made the camp special by being here. We thank you. Look around the room and you can see different ones that have been added. Their uh work is over. They've come to meet with God on a special camp meeting. This is our 10th anniversary of owning this camp. And to the God be the glory. We thank him for that. &gt;&gt; We thank you for the vision that we've had with our pastor. Because without a vision, the people perish. We know that scripture. We also understand that scripture to mean without a redemptive revelation the people will perish. And I believe that God has done his redeeming work and is doing his redeeming work within all of our lives through these meetings. It's been a blessing to have brother Ron Spencer and to have Andrew Spencer in the morning services. I feel I'm a very blessed man to be in these kind of meetings where men of God have separated themselves that the Holy Spirit could use them to speak to you and I. How many has been spoken to and dealt with? We can let the devil know that. &gt;&gt; We can let the devil know that God has specifically delivered you in these meetings. How many young people can wave their hand and said, "I've been delivered by the word of God." We give him glory tonight. These brothers could be somewhere else speaking some other meeting, some other camp meeting, but God has designated that they would be here. Brother Ron Spencer, pastor in Elk, Virginia, a long ways away, brought his dear wife and brother Spencer Junior. I called brother Ron Senior this morning and that didn't go over well. Not with you. It didn't go over well with him. But we love him. We love the gift of God in him. And he brought Sister Connie. And we want to thank you, Sister Connie, for coming. Brother Andrew brought Sister Katie and children. We thank them for coming. And I want to thank each and every one of you that's come from all over Canada, United States, even Europe to these meetings. To God be the glory. We are attracted not to a camp. We are attracted to the word himself. And we believe the word will have its way this evening. Lord, I lift your name as we invite brother Ron Spencer to come and speak to us through the word of God. Lord, I lift your name. your holy name. Jehovah God. Hello. You're the great I am my king. Lord, I lift your name. Holy name God. and my king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; So good to see you in the house of the Lord. And I'm just honored to to stand here. We love you. And I just know that this night has some incredible things that's laying in front of us. So good to see brother Menow freezing. Amen. Hallelujah. A lot of words could be said right there, brother Mow. We love you with all of our hearts. And I was a much younger man when you came to Christiansburg and sang with the believers and and I was that boy drummer and I certainly love you. It was an honor the other day to have brother Logan in the meetings in Edmonton and we had a very brother Bisco. We had a very word wonderful moment at the end of the service. The power of the glory of the Lord just came in a special way. And it was just special. And he just he just came in. And I begin to sing on the wings of a snow white dove. And brother Logan, brother Kenboy, your son, was sitting about where you are. And I said, "Only God could orchestrate this." He had sat in the back of the building for the other services. I said, "Come, Brother Logan. Come and let's sing this together. On the wings of a snow white dove. We have a covenant with God. &gt;&gt; And it was as though the dove of the Holy Spirit just come and &gt;&gt; just fluttered his wings in the building. And &gt;&gt; we just know that he's here. &gt;&gt; That same God is here. &gt;&gt; God is brother Ken's healer. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; He's his healer. And and I I'm so thankful as as as brother Biscll stood and greeted me just a moment ago, God's his healer. &gt;&gt; And the music continues to sound. Two years ago today, Brother Michael Andes had one of those experiences where Satan tried to destroy his life. &gt;&gt; Today, we celebrate life today, Brother Michael. &gt;&gt; We celebrate life and we're so thrilled. We heard you the other morning and or the other evening and we were so thrilled that what God is doing and maybe we can share something tomorrow for a 10th year anniversary. That would be wonderful. I hope I don't get in trouble, but I invited brother Michael Ray to set on the platform tonight. Last year, last year something very supernatural happened and I have been thrilled to watch the progress of what God is doing. &gt;&gt; I've heard every I I shared with him just a moment ago, Brother Biscll, I've listened to every word he said from the pull pit and I shout 3,000 miles away. I am thrilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am thrilled. I just told him something he already knowed. And so we're just thrilled. God God's a great God. &gt;&gt; He's just a great God. Maybe you have a need tonight that you'd just like to say, "Brother Ron, I'd like to reach out and touch him tonight. I walk to the pull pit tonight with not one but two brother-in-laws laying in the hospital with heart conditions. And as I walked out of the room this evening, I reminded the devil that he is a defeated enemy &gt;&gt; and we are disputing with a conquered devil. &gt;&gt; And so I would like for you to take not only brother Kin Boyer on your prayer, but brother Thomas Frasier and also brother Harold Shifflet and both with heart issues this afternoon. But I don't feel discouraged or defeated here. &gt;&gt; I feel like God is getting ready to do some real work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you agree with me this evening tonight that &gt;&gt; I would like for you to just reach out and touch him? Now, &gt;&gt; our prophet has taught us a few principles. We get what we expect. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, you'll see something tonight that you'll be critical of. &gt;&gt; But if you come to see Jesus &gt;&gt; beyond the realm of mortality, I believe that you'll see him. &gt;&gt; Because you see that we've invited him to come &gt;&gt; and he has came. &gt;&gt; We're already aware of his presence. &gt;&gt; Now, let's just talk to him just now. And I'd like for you to call your need before the Lord, your personal need, and touch the hem of a garment just now. &gt;&gt; Let's talk to him. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, we bow our heads before you now. And we sense the presence of the Lord as as you're here. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan has bombarded and tried to attack in a lot of different directions. But we stand here by the authority and the commission of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we remind the devil that he has no barrel, no arrows for his bow. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't even have a key to his own gate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you're a living God, not a historical God, but you're an I am God. and you're the one that gathered this meeting and draw these people. And &gt;&gt; it's not even an accident of where we're sitting in the building, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, when men would line up chairs and place chairs, you knew who would sit in those chairs. You knew exactly where people would be sitted at tonight. Father, Lord, you know our need before we even call, &gt;&gt; but you ask us to call and you will answer. Oh, Father, just now I ask you that you would anoint the gift of &gt;&gt; as a speaker. Father, &gt;&gt; anoint my vocal cords this evening. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you bring this body strength this afternoon, Father. Now, I ask you, Lord Jesus, that you would anoint this audience. &gt;&gt; Satan, we we charge you in the name of Jesus Christ. Take your hands off of God's children. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use the term God's property in the name of Jesus Christ. He's nothing but a squatter anyway. And we rebuke him right now. And we send your word to Ken Ber and Sister Shelly tonight, Father. Lord, Brother Thomas Frasier and Brother Harold. Lord, we believe your word. You're a supernatural God tonight and we invite you to come by our way &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like for us to look to St. John chap 11 this afternoon in verse 32. If you could help me tonight, I'd like to speak to you on roll away the stone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John 11 and verse 32. Then when Mary was come to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou had us been here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews and also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said, "Where have you laid him?" And they said unto him, "Lord, come and see." Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, "Behold how he loved him." And some of them said, "Could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused even this man that should not have died?" Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, "Take yee away this stone, the stone." And Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinkketh, for he had been dead four days. And Jesus saith unto her, said I not unto thee, and if thou wouldest believe that thou shouldest see the glory of God, then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee that thou has heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the people which stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me." &gt;&gt; And when he had thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, &gt;&gt; bound to hand and foot with grave clothes, and his face was bound with a napkin. And Jesus said unto them, "Loose him and let him go." &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. Oh, how tormenting it must be in the kingdom of hell &gt;&gt; to hear those scriptures read over and over again. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And how that he might even think that if I was a politically correct speaker that I would get to the point and avoid some of the verses and just announce a text and move forward. How difficult it must believe be that all of the circumstances of humanity is presented to us this day. Here are believers in Jesus Christ. Message believers, modern day message believers of that day. &gt;&gt; People that had recognized more than a man that was standing among them. They had recognized that he was the resurrection and the life. Why? Brother Brandham would bring to our attention that it was Lazarus that had taken Jesus to John's baptism. &gt;&gt; So Lazarus had saw some incredible things in Jesus's ministry. No doubt this had been a home to which when Jesus was weary that he would go by and spend days with. And we can find out that he he had been a friend. &gt;&gt; Why? When you're a friend, a friend of Jesus, it's always a good place to be at. &gt;&gt; I I would like to think that just like Abraham, he was a a friend of God. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to think that brother Brandon said that to be a friend, uh God had to have confidence in you. and he has confidence in the seed that he placed on the inside of you. And so Jesus enjoyed Lazarus's company. He enjoyed Mary and Martha, their home and their situation of life there. He enjoyed them. I want you to understand sometimes our circumstances seem to consume us. &gt;&gt; They seem to overwhelm our humanity. We look at the scene realm so many times and it if we're not careful, it'll override our faith if we're not not attentive to it. We'll begin to get worn and because of our energies begin to run dry. We'll begin to question certain things or try to place prophecy in the wrong spot or or we'll begin to wonder why this and why that. Lazarus begins to get a little bit weary and sick. They notice the sickness that is come coming on him. This sickness is just not a common sickness. They they see that this is beyond anything that they've seen happen. &gt;&gt; And they send word. There's a meeting that's going and they send word to where Jesus is at. Your friend Lazarus is sick. &gt;&gt; And Jesus does not deter from his mission or his plan. &gt;&gt; Now, no doubt some of his disciples thought, what's he going to do about that? Then he gets word again, Lazarus is sick. And he even plans and goes a different direction. They question earlier in the scriptures. Can you imagine the critics of that day? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the blogs of that day? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if we he'd have had media in that day? &gt;&gt; Of what they would have begin to scream out by text and email and Why? If Jesus was the friend, if he was so close to Lazarus, look, he can't even maintain a a close relationship. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And when the man really had needed help, &gt;&gt; he didn't go to where he was at. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And Jesus made his way in a complete different direction. You see, God's got a plan. And it's just like the resurrection, the rapture. It's right on time. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Don't get ahead of God. Don't get in a hurry with God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Men have proved when they get in a hurry, they produce the wrong kind of seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Abraham got in a hurry and he produced an Ishmamail. David got in a hurry and he murdered a man. Moses murdered a man. How many doctrines have been raised in this message by men that got in a hurry? &gt;&gt; Whoops. &gt;&gt; Jesus made his way. And as he makes his way, no doubt back at the house now he's slipping away. He's slipping away to another dimension. He's slipping away. Their hope that Jesus would come is now deteriorating. And Lazarus begins to slip into another dimension and he begins to lift into another realm. And it seems like all hope is lost now. Death in the Old Testament was an insurmountable door. Job would ask about it, &gt;&gt; what death was like. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Since Adam, death had reigned. It was a terror. It was a vicious, seemingly dark, unimaginable thing that would happen to which that this life is over and and and there would be a seal somewhere standing in a great gulf. To this point, &gt;&gt; you can only believe in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; You can only hope for a resurrection. &gt;&gt; But to this point, no one had paid the price to get to that resurrection. &gt;&gt; They had a promise in Genesis chapter 3 that there would be a resurrection. They had promises through the scriptures like Ezekiel that would say, "Son of man, can these bones live again?" And the breath of God begin to breathe across the house of Israel and raise it back up. I want you to understand it was by revelation that you could believe in a resurrection. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus turns to his disciples now and and begins to make his way back. Word comes he's dead. And Jesus begins to make an interesting statement. He's sleeping &gt;&gt; and I must go awake him. &gt;&gt; You see those disciples that had seen incredible miracles happen. &gt;&gt; I just have to tell you, you and I seen some incredible things happen. But I I I just have to say now, brother Brandon begins to talk about even some small things. Said Peter, he was a fisherman. And being a fisherman, every time they got around the water, he would put his hook in the water. &gt;&gt; You find that in the scripture anywhere? Brother Brandham begin to bear out. He said they talked about taxes, had to go pay their taxes. And Jesus turns around to Peter and he said, "You have a hook." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have a hook. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And he and he tells him, he said, "Go down to a certain place and &gt;&gt; you're going to catch a fish." &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And you're not just going to catch a fish, but in his mouth. &gt;&gt; All right. any smile there's &gt;&gt; enough money to pay the taxes. &gt;&gt; I've been on a couple guided trips. &gt;&gt; I've never had that kind of a guide. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, you want to take me on a fishing trip one day? By God's grace, we'll give you that opportunity. You heard that from the pull pit. But I can guarantee you, no matter how good the guide would be, no guide can guarantee catching a fish. &gt;&gt; First of all, catching the fish. &gt;&gt; Second of all, open his mouth and there's enough money to pay the taxes. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So many times we want to sew reason things together and put put science and put all kind of physics and all kind of laws and all kind of legalism. Figure that one out. &gt;&gt; Just figure that one out. Figure out just the small things that happen. There's a boy comes to school and he's got a he's got a lunch with him and everybody's hungry. There's no motel. There's no restaurants. There's no Walmarts. And Jesus said, "Bring a little fellow up here." He said, "What do we have amongst us?" And a little guy comes with some fish and and a few loaves. And brother even says, "You skipped school." And Jesus takes this bread and this fish &gt;&gt; and he blesses it. &gt;&gt; This was more than a man. &gt;&gt; This was more than a man that blessed that fish and blessed that bread. &gt;&gt; Those men took their hands and begin to pass it out. Yes, &gt;&gt; they read the scriptures about a mill barrel that never run dry. &gt;&gt; They could read the scriptures and what the prophet says about a about a a prophet that said, "Give me a double portion." &gt;&gt; And he was still lacking one miracle. And they buried him in a tomb. &gt;&gt; And they throw a dead soldier in on top of him. And God had made that man a promise. And he brought that dead soldier to life. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is a is a confirmer of his word. &gt;&gt; He's that same God tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They saw some incredible things. &gt;&gt; But maybe even in their mind would be kind of like what's in this audience. Sometimes we don't get what we expect &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Have you ever got disappointed? &gt;&gt; You ever got disappointed? &gt;&gt; I I want this to this part to be very sobering. You ever got disappointed? &gt;&gt; You prayed and asked a prayer to God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it didn't happen. And you even you even had prophetic word that said it's going to come to pass. I've got scripture for that. God himself came to a man after he had believed God for now 25 years. &gt;&gt; And he even told the testimony &gt;&gt; that I'm going to have a son. Right. &gt;&gt; And he took God at his word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, he challenged us on that just a little bit. You want to get patient with God? He said, "Try 25 years." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say, when God says something's going to happen, &gt;&gt; you can bank on it. &gt;&gt; You can absolutely bank on it. And don't even try to figure out how God's going to do business. He's going to do business. &gt;&gt; Don't analyze it. Don't try to put the hat in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said there'd be an animal with 42in horns. And I believe it. &gt;&gt; Your pastor was a part of it. &gt;&gt; And we still believe it today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word said there's going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I believe it. &gt;&gt; That there will be a physical corporal return of Jesus Christ. And I'm going to take a step half a step that way. And our resurrected saints is going to take a half a step this way. And we're going to meet right here. &gt;&gt; And go to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; That's our promise. &gt;&gt; That's what believers believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Jesus arrives where where they are at and they begin to present some some questions to him. Lord, if you'd have only been here our brother would not have died. &gt;&gt; They were missing what God was getting ready to do. &gt;&gt; I want you to think sometimes we come to service whether it's a Wednesday night or whenever it is. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're sitting in the very thing that we need, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we're missing what God is wanting to do. If you'd have been here, &gt;&gt; our brother would not have died. And Jesus told them that I am the resurrection &gt;&gt; and I am the life. &gt;&gt; They even said said it correctly. The master is come. &gt;&gt; If I could say it tonight and just just talk to you, the master is here. &gt;&gt; The master is in the building right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you could reach out, the greatest brain doctor is in the building, brother Men. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; We've seen him do incredible miracles in our life. And he's here. &gt;&gt; He's the same God. Now no doubt that those people that was around they were there and they had a lot of chatter and in their chatter they were chattering doubt and unbelief. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's talks about Jesus weeping. He said as a man he wept. He wept because of their unbelief. &gt;&gt; I have to be very honest with you. Sometimes I stand and in my study and I weep &gt;&gt; because of people's unbelief. &gt;&gt; They got great needs. They got great situations in their life and they're standing in the right place. But they allow the enemy to rob them of their victory and their joy. &gt;&gt; I was with brother Roy Shrewsbury one time and we had a phenomenal meeting. Brother Roy is now in his 90s and preaching every Sunday. He's quite a man. They walked into the study with him and he was just standing there weeping. He said, "Brother Ron," he said, "So many times I'm thrilled by who comes to the altar." He said, "I'm just thrilled." &gt;&gt; He said, "But what makes me weep is those that really need it." Yes. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Sit right there and in a dry eye, &gt;&gt; they're not moved. &gt;&gt; Service after service after service, they just sit in the atmosphere &gt;&gt; and they really miss what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Oh, to God, tonight I ask for a Holy Spirit to quicken our attention. Brother Benos use the term get desperate. &gt;&gt; Shake yourself and pinch your conscience. &gt;&gt; These meetings are not just to just come and gather a people just to see if we could have a meeting. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? There's been huge congregations of phenomenal people gathered. Great audiences. But it's God that has gathered you &gt;&gt; from all realms of the earth. He's gathered you sir &gt;&gt; on this side of the resurrection. Gathered you to give you a charge of the dynamics of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Don't miss what God wants to do. &gt;&gt; Don't miss. &gt;&gt; How many times do we hear our prophet go, don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it now. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it now. actually leaving a patient that's in the audience actually calling him out and talking to him &gt;&gt; going to another patient and then go back to that man &gt;&gt; and say don't miss it &gt;&gt; are you with me &gt;&gt; now listen that same God's here tonight &gt;&gt; but he might not use me in the same way but I want to say this to you don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Don't miss what God wants to do for you in this meeting. You've driven an incredible amount away. Don't let the devil &gt;&gt; rob you. &gt;&gt; Don't let him rob you. &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes on humanity. &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes on who's here, who's not here, what celebrities in the building. I could care less about celebrities. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could put all the celebrities in the world in a bag. I wouldn't give you a nickel for them. &gt;&gt; I want Godfilled sons and daughters of God that has a passion to serve God. &gt;&gt; Jesus wept. He wept. Now Jesus thanks God for their sake that he heard his prayer. Now Jesus could have rolled the stone. &gt;&gt; You know tombs are called the final resting place. Tombs are the spot to where that we bury our dead. Tombs are the spot that we say goodbye &gt;&gt; in this realm. &gt;&gt; Tombs are a difficult place to visit. So they choose certain headstones for a certain purpose to seal the st the tomb and they roll that stone into place and they seal it. It's seemably sealed to the resurrection. in sealing it. It has purpose, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because that body is going to deteriorate &gt;&gt; and it's going to go back to the ashes and the gases. &gt;&gt; They wrapped it and put perfumes in it, not going into all of those things, but Lazarus's body began to deteriorate and go back to the dust which he came. Brother Brandham would give us another scene. He said Lazarus had went to the realm where Abraham was at &gt;&gt; and he said there they begin to fellowship. I can just imagine their conversations as they begin to exchange stories &gt;&gt; and Lazarus would tell Abraham and Isaac and Jacob what it was like to be with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Abraham would say, "I I met one like that." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of days or ending of nights. And he knew my name. And he came and said, "And there was never a man like that man." &gt;&gt; And he spoke to me, "Sarah, come listen. We're listening to the same kind of a man." &gt;&gt; And during the conversation, there's another conversation going on in another room. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus asked his sisters, "Roll away the stone." &gt;&gt; Jesus could have spoke that stone away. &gt;&gt; The same way that he could speak your storm away. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The same way that he could just just take your problems away in a moment's notice. &gt;&gt; But he asked those girls. &gt;&gt; Roll the stone. &gt;&gt; Roll the stone. Now, let me just say this to you. As long as it's your favorite preacher, anybody can. Amen. And it's your favorite quote. It's easy to Amen. &gt;&gt; Your favorite singer. Everybody can get in the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You've enjoyed dinner with Jesus. You've enjoyed miracles with Jesus. You've enjoyed the parables with Jesus. You've enjoyed incredible phenomenal times with Jesus. But now he's just asked you to identify yourself with him. Because now all of those mourers that have been such sympathetic with you &gt;&gt; are going to watch you participate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're going to watch you take personal responsibility. &gt;&gt; Now you got responsibility with him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you're going beyond the human element to believe. &gt;&gt; You're challenged to believe. &gt;&gt; How many squirrels do you want? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How many He's walking away after the second one. He said, "You asked for three." &gt;&gt; How many times have you asked God for things &gt;&gt; and you're challenged to believe? Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're challenged to confess &gt;&gt; and step out of the realm of faith and take God at his word &gt;&gt; to take the book and eat the book &gt;&gt; and identify that I'm a part of this message. &gt;&gt; Everybody can enjoy the burden until it's theirs. I can hear the critic go, look at him. He's going to let women move that stone. He could have asked his disciples. &gt;&gt; He could have asked Peter, strong man. &gt;&gt; Well, he could have put his hands on it. Roll away the stone. You see, that was as great a miracle as Lazarus is coming for &gt;&gt; is when they actually put their hands on it. &gt;&gt; You see, once you put your hands on it, you're part of it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You won't get many critics standing off to the side. Everybody can be a Monday morning quarterback. &gt;&gt; You know, if I was the pastor, I'd do it this way. &gt;&gt; You know, if I was running the show, I'd do it this way. If I was making a call, I'd do it this way. &gt;&gt; So, we stand in audiences just like Jesus was standing there. And they put their hands on the stone, Lord. But now he stinkketh. Notice where they said he stinkketh when they put their hands on it. Cuz now they knew something was getting ready to happen. Have you read the doctor's report? Yeah. And they push and they step back. Now, brother Brandham said that Jesus called him by name. &gt;&gt; You know, I marvel I'm preaching something so simple to such a vast crowd because the Lord put it on my heart to preach this tonight. But I feel like I'm standing in front of some tombs. Some dead in sin, &gt;&gt; trapped. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And even sitting amongst meetings like this, the enemy's held you. &gt;&gt; And life hasn't been breathed to you. &gt;&gt; You see, sin brings death. It doesn't look like death, but it brings death. It takes you somewhere. sin. We can attribute it to many different things, but it's really unbelief. &gt;&gt; And I wonder sometimes how many times we even said in our in our our assemblies, and unbelief fills our heart. &gt;&gt; We can believe it for others, but what about oursel? &gt;&gt; We can believe it for others, and we we just wonder what in the world's going on. &gt;&gt; Maybe things have got us trapped. I understand about a coma and I share this with you. I understand about a coma. A coma is a person that's alive and very much alive and in many cases very much aware but the body is trapped and it can't move. It can't respond. But the senses are very much aware. It can hear. It can understand. didn't comprehend. I told Sister Connie conversations that people came in the room and had with her. There were people that told Sister Connie, "You're young enough, you're young enough when brother Ron dies, you can marry again." Their hearts were filled with unbelief. Jesus, &gt;&gt; we you can smile at that. But listen, that's a pitiful story. &gt;&gt; Instead of taking God at his word &gt;&gt; and brother said, "Never think a ne negative thought." &gt;&gt; Instead of burying me, pray for me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, I'm going to challenge you tonight. &gt;&gt; Instead, instead of looking at the negative side, take God at his word and believe God. It's easy to just dismiss where brother Brandham's off the scene and God don't do those things anymore. God's still very much alive. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if there ever was a group of people that ought to believe in God &gt;&gt; and the miracle working of God, it ought to be the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe it's music. I was I was in prayer the other day and maybe this will be this will be kind of eyeopening for you because it was for me. I was in prayer about suicide spirits and how those things want to come amongst our young people to steal their life &gt;&gt; and to tell them they're not worthy just literally try to end their lives and it's not worth living no more. &gt;&gt; After much prayer, God spoke in my heart. It's the music. &gt;&gt; It's the music from the realm of hell. &gt;&gt; It's the music that echoes, whether it be country or whether it be rock or whether it be some kind of a rap or some kind of crazy music calling out from a dark dimension, &gt;&gt; destroying marriages and destroying homes and destroying lives. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Amen. &gt;&gt; That music begins to call out to that dark realm. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll find ourselves in the tombs of movies. If &gt;&gt; we're not careful, we'll find ourselves in the tombs of denomination and &gt;&gt; before long settling for something less than what we've got &gt;&gt; and listening to another voice, &gt;&gt; a voice that is contaminated. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Listen. When you've got a pure voice to listen to and you've got Godqualifist to hear preach, we have no shortage of phenomenal speaking in this world that have been been dipped in the oil and have ate the book and preached the word with purity. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Why should our eyes toward turn toward systems that have let down the bars &gt;&gt; and ate from the filth of Leoa, &gt;&gt; knowing that one word wrong &gt;&gt; separates us &gt;&gt; from fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; That'll cause you to go into a tomb. Maybe your marriage is in a tomb. This is a family camp. I hope this is all right. I feel that. And so here we are. I'm sure Dr. Dobson was a good man. But we don't need psychology to fix our marriage. &gt;&gt; Your amen should have been better than that. &gt;&gt; You don't need to go to Barnes & Noble to get a a a book marriage for dummies. I'll tell you, your marriage should have a a prayer life in it. &gt;&gt; You should never get too busy to have a prayer life going on in your home. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? That altar should be a home that's got an altar, a prayer life that is going on in that home. That that home can be a sanctuary. Whether it's a town or a castle, it should be a sanctuary where almighty God dwells at. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It should not be a home of fussing and fighting and arguing over a dollar. &gt;&gt; Preacher. &gt;&gt; Our best friend should be our wife or our husband. That's who our best friend should be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But I'm afraid too many marriages have been killed by entertainment &gt;&gt; or the drive for money &gt;&gt; and their marriages have been murdered. I have a table that seats 18 at my home. It was made by the Amish. It's maple. It was cheap. That's why I bought it. It's a nice table. 18 chairs. Many people come to my table and sit and look and my family's all around and they go, "What a wonderful family. &gt;&gt; It's not an accident. Right. &gt;&gt; It's not an accident I have a wonderful family. I dedicated my family to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We dedicated our family to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I refuse to give one. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to negotiate and say, "Well, I'll give you this one and I'll take this one. I'll give you this one and I'll take this one." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's non-negotiable. &gt;&gt; I want every one of them. &gt;&gt; So I come against that spirit of hell. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We had something very supernatural happen in our home. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; So many I've had people say, "You shouldn't tell personal stories." What you tell me what I can tell if I can't tell personal stories. &gt;&gt; The same person that told me that I went back and listened to their tape of what they just told and they don't live up to their own word. God's a personal God. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim's granddaughter's here. I don't know where she's at. I can't find her. Thank you. She's a short girl. I like short people. I hope that doesn't add to your complex. But Adriana You can remember the night that there was a prayer line at your granddaddy's meeting. We actually sat in the back and and we actually talked about we present this service to the Lord. You see your I I guess it would be your cousin Drew that had received the miracle of I saw a vision that Drew would walk and he didn't walk immediately. Many of you know the story, but I'm not going to take the time. But it would be sometime later that Drew, who had been born with a debilitating bone situation, that Sister Karen Puit had had a brain bleed and and God spared her life and and she was sitting and and she was kind of kind of had the blues about not being able to do all the things that she used to do and not be able to feel as good as she used to feel. You know, sometimes she just felt trapped in her body of what it was like. I know what it is to feel kind of trapped in your body and would like for it to do better and like for it to do more and like to have more energy or like to be able to do this or that. And she something just come on her and she began to worship the Lord and and the presence of God dropped in the room and Drew was at her feet. And when the presence of God came and healed her, it also healed that baby. &gt;&gt; And Drew began to run all over the room. And &gt;&gt; she began to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; I came to that meeting that night. Brother Kim, I I walked to the pull pit like I've walked to this pull pit and I asked, "Where's Drew at?" And Drew was in the bed. They put him to bed and I said, "Could you go get him?" And they brought him in pajamas. I think I don't know remember the color. Do you remember the color? Maybe orange. I like orange pajamas, too. And I took Drew out of his arms. And you talk about a miracle. He came to me &gt;&gt; and I begin to tell that audience, we're going to have a prayer line here in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; I don't know what God's going to do in this meeting, but he's here. &gt;&gt; And I took Drew and I began to walk him across the stage backwards and forwards. And I said, "Some of you are going to walk in these same steps that this little boy used to not be able to walk, but he's walking across." &gt;&gt; And we walk backwards and forwards. &gt;&gt; Can I share with you just a few events that happened that night? &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yes. &gt;&gt; How many knows the story of Mariah? Mariah had a disease and it was a disease that had taken the hair off of her body. Alipcia alipcia. I'm from Virginia. alipcia and her hair was leaving her body. Brother Tim had prayed for him months before. She came to that prayer line. She only had a strand. Now she's wearing a a knit tob bargain nice hat and she's wearing that but she comes with bobby pins. How many knows what bobby pins are? &gt;&gt; She comes with bobby pins into that prayer line and she's carrying them. &gt;&gt; I believe after tonight I'm going to need these bobby pins. I want you to know that tonight her hair is thick &gt;&gt; and long &gt;&gt; and beautiful. &gt;&gt; We saw one miracle after another take place that night. I begin to weary. Brother Wendell Martin's wife, her name. &gt;&gt; Jessica, thank you for all your help. Like brother Brandham said, I didn't know all of you were from Kentucky. She walks across the stage amongst the other hundreds. I felt the spirit of the Lord speak to her. I give you your son. &gt;&gt; I don't know even right now where he was at, but he was way out in sin and it seemed hopeless. &gt;&gt; You're talking about calling out of a grave. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That boy is now a believer. &gt;&gt; That boy's married. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It was God that called him out of the grave that night. &gt;&gt; I stepped off of the stage a bit later, very weary, and fell into the arms of Brother Tim Wyers and carried me. And Brother Aaron Oglesby and Andrew that's sitting behind me on the stage would carry me to the room and he can confirm all of these things. And as they carry me into the room where I was at, I turn to brother Aaron Oglesby and I tell him, "You'll never be the same from this night forward." &gt;&gt; Here's the reason I have you on the stage, Brother Michael. It was a night like your night. And brother Aaron Oglesby, he's a big boy. I don't know. Everybody over six foot tall's giants to me, brother Aaron. I said, "God's called you to preach the gospel to carry the greatest message that there's ever been on the foundation of the world." I began to pray with him and he laid back against the wall and he be to worship and he went back to the meeting and he was all over the place. I'm to Today's different. Today's different. I'll never be the same. I'll never be the same. &gt;&gt; You can go listen to it. It wasn't a man called him. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a man's anointing that called that boy, &gt;&gt; but he's a powerhouse. &gt;&gt; Because we got the greatest message that there's ever been on the face of the earth. Scream it from the echoes of your heart. Scream it. Maybe your job's not to be a preacher. Maybe your job's to be a singer. Your job's to be an amen. Just do the job that God's given you to do. &gt;&gt; Glory. These things are true that I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I lay back on the bed, I saw a vision of a little boy in our family. And I said, "Andrew, we're going to have a little boy." He said, "Not me, Daddy." Sister Connie comes in the room. She be to rejoice. My daughter couldn't have children. My son-in-law had been crushed in an accident. She in her own womb couldn't carry a child. My son-in-law had been crushed in an accident. His shoulder was crushed. His ribs were crushed. His pelvis was crushed. And I heard the doctor say, "It's crushed worse than any other man that I've ever put back together." He said, "But we'll put them back together, and God will do the healing." &gt;&gt; My son-in-law's back to work now. He's quite an avid hunter. He's back to hunting. It was in August. They came through a prayer line at her own church. I think one of maybe two that we've had in our own assembly, quite on that order. And she came down through the prayer line holding Davey's hand. And I said, "Witney, tonight's the night. God's going to give you that baby that you've been desiring. &gt;&gt; The sister that was behind her brother Ed, her and her husband had their hands a hold. Only God can do these things. &gt;&gt; Anything else is just hopes &gt;&gt; it's more than reading somebody's spirit. &gt;&gt; More than some convenient situation. &gt;&gt; This ain't some denomination trying to work a gift up or manufacture. You don't have to manufacture for Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I told her, I said, "The same angel of the Lord is visiting your house." Now, &gt;&gt; you can't make this up. &gt;&gt; They went to the baby doctor on the same day at the very same time. And they walked in the office together and said, "Oh, you're pregnant." And one of them said to the other, "We were in the same prayer line." Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, you're either standing on one side or you're standing on the other. &gt;&gt; You're either enjoying the miracles or you're standing and doubting. You didn't realize that even those personal stories were a trap to you, &gt;&gt; but you don't have to stay there. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you don't have to stay there. You can believe for your own situation. &gt;&gt; What about your lost children? What about your lost brothers and sisters? What about your backsliding condition? What about your life that's been stripped? &gt;&gt; So many times we can put quotes together, but we can't believe for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; We want sermons preached on the seventh seal. when I'm standing here preaching third pull to you. &gt;&gt; You don't need a label. &gt;&gt; You don't need a label. &gt;&gt; So many times we want to give somebody a book and give them an intellectual ability. &gt;&gt; If I can intellectually give you something, Satan will come along and give you an intellectual something stronger. &gt;&gt; But if you receive Jesus Christ, If you receive this by revelation and you put your hands on the rock yourself, &gt;&gt; come on. Your computer can quote this message. &gt;&gt; Your computer, your phone can quote this message, but it can't live it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Your computer can do all of those things. It's good to have pictures. It's good to have tapes. It's good to have books. But this message wants to live in your life. &gt;&gt; Son of man, can these bones live again? &gt;&gt; So I'm prophesying to you tonight. Let it live. You know what the interesting thing is? That God not only showed me the vision, but he gave him gave me his name, Isaac Jackson. And I never did tell Whitney or Davey what God showed me, but I wrote it down. &gt;&gt; That's not a great big thing. Don't Don't even think that's a great big thing. God wrote your name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Right here. &gt;&gt; Right here is What do you call that? Is there a nurse here? Ultrasound picture. &gt;&gt; I knew you had to be here. It's an ultrasound picture. I carry it in my Bible of Isaac. &gt;&gt; I do it for a reason. &gt;&gt; Man saw him before he was born. Right. &gt;&gt; God saw him &gt;&gt; like he saw you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Were you surprised it was a boy? No. At the gender to reveal party, I didn't even fill out a thing. I thought it would be unfair. What do you think his name would be? I didn't fill it out. I thought that would be unfair. &gt;&gt; When I held him, I'm going to share something with you. I was writing the notes for that dedication service. And I was writing down everything that I just told you in my study. Sister Connie was doing her hair all the way on the other end of the house and she felt a wind like I felt when it came through the rooms. When I wrote down Jessica Martin, give you your son, I felt the wind come through the building. Oh, may that wind come through this building. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a man sitting in our church that was died in our service. His name's Doug Hill. He died. We didn't get excited. We just walked over to him and laid our hands on him. Just what the word said. I don't know what God will do, but I know what God's able to do. We said a simple prayer and I said, "Brother Doug, stay with me. Come back to me." And he'd been gone now minutes now. And in just a minute, he sat up. He said, "I'm here." &gt;&gt; I'm here. &gt;&gt; What was it like, Brother Ron? It was a phenomenal &gt;&gt; feeling. It's a very sobering feeling. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the resurrected one was was sitting now among us. &gt;&gt; He saw himself slipping away. &gt;&gt; God called him back. &gt;&gt; You see, Lazarus was in another realm &gt;&gt; and he was talking about him and all of a sudden he heard his name. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did. Brother Brandham said, "Had he not called him by name, &gt;&gt; he would have called a general resurrection." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I go to Europe, Brother David. I was in Ireland not long ago and I walked I walked into where John Wesley or Columba spoke and Cola had been the pastor of that church and there's deacons that were buried that were there and their names is almost gone from the stones and I stood over top of those graves and I thought hundreds and thousands of people have walked by these graves and no doubt their bodies and their bones are gone. They're nothing but dust. But one of these mornings, &gt;&gt; you'll think those miracles that you just heard are phenomenal. But what are these warnings? &gt;&gt; He's going to call And there's not a devil in hell &gt;&gt; can stop them &gt;&gt; from coming forward. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming &gt;&gt; and devil. The devil has put every bit of unbelief that he could try to put on you. &gt;&gt; Challenge you in your circumstances. challenge you in your situations. &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone tonight. &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; We want to ask you, do you now believe? &gt;&gt; Because you're one part of the rapture. You happen to be the live and remain. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll, he talked to you personally &gt;&gt; about what that land is like. I don't mind saying it. Brother Ed Bisco is one of my favorite preachers, too. I take all of my money and put it put it in his account right now if he'd preach in the morning. Brother Kim, I've heard him tell about how brother Brandham talked to him about that land. I set feet from him like you have as he tells the stories of how brother Brandham talks about what it was like here. for his grandson. I asked where's Sam? Sam's in the building. I asked brother Sam today. I said, "Do you guys know who Ed Biscll is?" Is that okay? Does your children know who he is? Now, I'm going to a real key right now. You know who he is. &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes while we've got an incredible gift among us, if we really appreciate the gift, &gt;&gt; I'm not out on a limb now. I've still got scripture on my side. you shake his hand with Walmart on your mind or where you going to eat. I think sometimes we miss the moments. Brother Menow, you've been a pastor for many years. I wonder if people miss the gift that God put in your life. Brother Tom, brother, on your way out on a limb. Really? Cuz people missed Jesus. &gt;&gt; They missed Jesus. They saw a not so good robe. not Hollywood hair, &gt;&gt; rugged skin, &gt;&gt; and they missed who he was. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can I finish this evening with these thoughts? In John chapter 12, there's a meeting like tonight. And Jesus is there and Lazarus is there. &gt;&gt; This is mind-blowing to me. &gt;&gt; This is &gt;&gt; This is absolutely mind-blowing to me that Jesus is in the building and Lazarus, the one who was dead and now alive, he's in the building &gt;&gt; and people came. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And many were led to Jesus because of Lazarus. But there was people there that wanted to put Lazarus to death. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; There was people that wanted to kill Lazarus. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; you know, he had to thought that was amusing. &gt;&gt; You're right. You know, he had the thought, "Really? That's not so bad. I was just there a few days ago. I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; That's the same as here tonight. That's the same as here tonight. The tombs have been opened. &gt;&gt; The stones have been rolled away. &gt;&gt; And some of you are alive, but there's others that like to put you back to death. &gt;&gt; Stupid devil. &gt;&gt; Stupid devil. Once you have tasted of life, you won't know part of death. &gt;&gt; Once you've heard his voice, it settles every sin question in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once you've been in his presence one time, &gt;&gt; you can look at the stone and it could be a memorial. It was a dungeon for me, but it became my best of you to walk into life. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. Let me finish this sermon the way that I started it. It must have been disappointed in hell. Every time you read John 11, it reminds the devil we had him. &gt;&gt; We had him. Every time ministers read, Brother Brian talks about, "Oh, when when Jesus came to to Satan's kingdom, walked up to the gates and told him that he was a virgin-born son of God and his blood was still wet on the cross. &gt;&gt; And he took the keys of death, hell, and a grave." And he stood there in Revelation chapter one and he said, "I am he that was dead and I am alive forever more and I have the keys of death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; I would like to ask you tonight to put your hands on your stone." By now you stinkketh. By now you stink. But if you can just put your hands on the stone &gt;&gt; and give it a push, &gt;&gt; this camp meeting will never be the same. Sister Adriana, you came a long way. Put your hands on the stone. You got little hands. Put your little hands on the stone. Push by faith. &gt;&gt; Fighting things. fighting things before you came here. Won't you put your hands on it and say, "You're not going to hold me bondage no more." &gt;&gt; What about your marriage? What about your marriage? What about your relationship with family? Satan's tried to steal your children away. Take them back. What about your brothers and your sisters &gt;&gt; that have tried that seemingly are slipping away? Put your hands on the stone. &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone. &gt;&gt; And what seems insurmountable to move, &gt;&gt; Jesus is behind you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your children might be saved. Call out somebody else's children. &gt;&gt; Put your hands against the stone. &gt;&gt; I'm honest. I put my hands against the stone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For and I call some names before this service. I'm not going to make it that personal, but I refuse to let Satan &gt;&gt; run rough shot. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I refuse. &gt;&gt; We're not some mambby pamby little powerless church. We're the church of the living God. The sword is in your hand. Take God at his word tonight. You're the invincible army that God knew that was going to be here. Nobody else is coming. You're here. You've been challenged. &gt;&gt; How many gifts do you have to be shook in front of you that you come alive? Take God at his word, Sister Emma. Take God at his word. Believe God. Take him at his word. Jesus. Sister Anne, take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Joanna, take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jessica, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jonathan, I just called their names. &gt;&gt; Brother David, sorry to point your children out, but just use him an example. Take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Prayer line. No, it's already went on. Oh, brother one, I'm expecting a prayer line. He's among you right now, &gt;&gt; and he's going wave after wave after wave after wave across you right now. &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone. Somebody will see me. It don't matter. &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone. What? Brother Ron, somebody will make fun of me. Roll away the stone. &gt;&gt; Spirit of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, I bow my head before you now. I have delivered the word that you have asked me to deliver. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; You are the breath behind the voice. &gt;&gt; You're the anchor to our soul right now. Oh God, may life come. May life reb breathed across this audience. It's important that the tent went up and it's important that all the music is set right and it's important all the helpers have did their part. &gt;&gt; It's important that the ministry are at their post of duty and the deacons are everywhere. &gt;&gt; But God, we didn't come to see one another. &gt;&gt; We didn't come to hear some poetic words. &gt;&gt; We come that you would come to our tomb. of all of the tombs, you went to Lazarus's tomb &gt;&gt; and you've came to our spot tonight. You've come to our home. You came to our situation as we sit and we listen to the word, &gt;&gt; backsliding, habits, &gt;&gt; situation, &gt;&gt; unbelief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. wrong kind of expectations, looking at the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; I defy the armies of hell right now in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Satan, you're a cruel taskmaster and we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We refuse to be your slave another night, another day, another hour. &gt;&gt; I claim healing. I claim deliverance. &gt;&gt; I stand in Kim Boyer's place tonight &gt;&gt; and I claim deliverance for him in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's hands went up all over this building tonight. You see their needs right now. &gt;&gt; And you're a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; You're the doctor that worked on brother Ed Bisll's heart. You arranged the doctors. You arranged the nurses. You arranged the place where it would happen. Knowing that you would be the healer, knowing that you would raise him back up again. May you raise up young men and young women by the power of the resurrection tonight. Death can't hold them. The grave can't hold them tonight. Sin can't hold them. bondages of hell can't hold them. At the name of Jesus Christ, Satan, take your hands off of God's property right here this evening in Jesus Christ's name. House of hell, give way in the name of Jesus Christ. Worship him now. Worship him now. Roll away the stone now. Let him come by your way now. This is your opportunity. This is your moment now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I claim sons and daughters tonight. &gt;&gt; I claim brothers and sisters tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May families be restored. May there come a revival in our lives like never before with a passion in our life to serve God like never before. in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Won't you worship him while he's here? &gt;&gt; The moment to worship him while he's here. &gt;&gt; Won't you let him come to your home? &gt;&gt; Won't you let him change your life? &gt;&gt; It don't take long in the presence of God. Lord Jesus Jesus. Glory to God. Godless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stake your claim tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have to do, if it's come to the altar, whatever you have to do, just raise your hands before him. He's right there where you're at. &gt;&gt; Get desperate before God. &gt;&gt; Don't let the Jesus of this day weep for your unbelief. Don't let him weep for your unbelief tonight. Oh Godlord. Hallelujah. Reach. Reach and touch him now. Reach and touch him now. &gt;&gt; Reach and touch him now. Let the Holy Ghost just saturate your soul now. Don't get robbed in this moment because of your unbelief. &gt;&gt; I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Reach to him now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Touch him while he goes by. Jesus is passing this way. &gt;&gt; I say it in the name of the Lord. He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here among you. The angel of the Lord is among you. The ark of the covenant is among you. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel's in this building right now. &gt;&gt; He's here for your need. &gt;&gt; Pour your heart out to him right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are worthy, oh God. powerless. &gt;&gt; You are worthy tonight, oh God. &gt;&gt; You are worthy tonight. You are worthy tonight. &gt;&gt; This is more than some kind of emotion or sensationalism. He's come to your Won't you just call out to him now? Jesus stood back and watched those girls push away the stone. Brother Ron, I want a preacher to lay his hands on me tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you in the name of the Lord to take God at his word. And you put your hands on the stone tonight. Nobody can push your stone but you. You know where you're short. You know where your back's sliding. It's not where you used to be. It's where you are right tonight. &gt;&gt; It's not what you used to do or what your hands have done. Is where your revival's at right here tonight. &gt;&gt; Shake off that unbelief. Shake off the hounds of hell and run like that rabbit into the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; Run. Run in the name of the Lord. Run. &gt;&gt; Don't let the hounds of hell their hot breath against you. Run in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Into the hole in the rock now. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Jesus waited on them to roll away the storm. I got I'm not even &gt;&gt; He's standing at your tomb tonight. He's standing where near where you are. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. Whatever you do, don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't miss it. Save your savior. Save your savior. My heart cry. others thy do not pass Saveior my savior. We are grounding to pass me by a gentle s my Oh, power. Do not sing. Why don't you just lift up your hands? Lord Jesus saveior. to God. He touched me. Oh, he touched me and all the joy that my soul. of his head. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Shackle my heavy of guilt and sh just let him touch you tonight. Blood of Jesus touched me and now I am no longer the same. Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me and all the joy that my soul something something happened and now I know He touched me and made me whole. So since I met this blessed Savior and since he cleansed me I shall never cease to praise and I'll shout him while eternity. I think we can praise him tonight and thank him for what he's doing. And he touched me. Oh, he touched me. and all the joy that loves my soul. Something something happened and now I know he touched me and made me. Let's just sing that last verse again. Since I met this blessed se and since he cleansed me, I shall never cease to praise him. I shine my eternity. He touched me. Oh, he touched me and all the joy that loves my soul. Oh, something else happened and now I know he touched me. How many roll the stone back? How many put your hand to the stone? You can you can confess it. I think when they put their hand to the stone, there was a little bit of motion that came with that. There was something that said, "He's the resurrection and the life. He's the one that spoke life and Lazarus came." I'm sure there was a little bit of happiness, a little bit of joy, little bit of worship. And it wasn't something that had to be told. They saw the dead raised up again. They loved Lazarus. That was their brother. And I love you. And I got a little bit of joy tonight because Jesus spoke to you and told you to roll back a stone. and you lifted up your hand and said, "I rolled my stone away." Well, I wonder whether you could praise him. I wonder what Mary did. I wonder what Martha did. I wonder what they did. I wonder what kind of meeting they had at the that day. I wonder what kind of was not looking at the preacher. They weren't looking at the people around the room. They were looking to the lamb of God. They're looking to life himself. He spoke the word. And by him speaking the word, I got life. I got my brother back. Look around the room. I got my sister back. Look around the room. I I got my brother back. I got my daddy back. I got my mommy back. Praise the Lord. Why? because the resurrection has come by your way. Brother Bram said that's what this message was all about. The resurrection came by your address and you received it this evening. I just want to give him all the glory. Is he the worthy lamb, David? Is he the worthy lamb? He's worthy of all praise and glory. Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy the lamb. Oh worthy. So worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. He's worthy. Worthy, worthy. The lamb that was. Let's just sing that chorus again. He's so worthy. He's so worthy. Worthy. The lamb that was slain is worthy. My Jesus is worthy. Worthy. The lamb that was slain. Let's just sing it now without the musicians. He's worthy. He's worthy. &gt;&gt; Worthy. The lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; Worthy. Worthy, worthy. The lamb. &gt;&gt; Hear the cry. Go ahead, Ryan. Hear the cries of the shackle. From the onset of time, from the chains of defeat, there's no key. See the tears of the broken. The cryal of the slaves. Is there no one worthy to set us free? And then the crying is still as the chorus rings out. The shackles are released from their chain. and thousands of voices are. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want my voice to be perfect. The lamb that was slain. He's worthy. Worthy. Worthy. I am that was So he's worthy. Worthy the lamb that was. Is he worthy? Isn't his presence wonderful? I'm just looking at different people this evening, different men, different young ladies that came into the service. And the voice of God said, "Roll your stone away. Put your hand to that stone." In your own heart, you know exactly what you rolled away by the word of God. And there should be something welling up within your heart. Lord, how wonderful was to be in your presence tonight. Not because the minister got excited, but there's something that's now beating in my soul. And this is a reality. I'm free tonight by the word of God. I'm free by the words I heard this morning, last night, day before. I'm I'm free by the word that has been spoken. And there's a joy unspeakable and full of glory that is now welling up within my heart tonight. I wonder if we rolled back the stone for these for these young ladies saying, "I'm not I'm not now chained down to fashion that has bound you so much." Young men so influenced by Hollywood haircuts and all these things that try and entrap us to take away our joy. and all of a sudden we become imprisoned in some sort of tomb that was man-made. But I believe that Jesus came by. Jesus spoke the word of God and rolled back your stone and now life is coming forth within your own heart. It's not just the deacon or the elder young people, but something's happened very deep within my heart. You must make your confession. Say, "My stone's been rolled back. The tomb's empty. And he's alive within my heart." Can you say that? He's alive. &gt;&gt; He's alive in my heart. Let's bow our heads. Bow our heads. And if you want to give him a thanksgiving offering from your hearts, you speak to him now. You speak to him. You speak to him as he's a father. You speak to him with your lips and say, "Father, thank you for coming and speaking to me. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that you can thank him from your heart." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some time that you can thank him. &gt;&gt; Because just in a few more minutes, we're just going to be out of the maybe this little gathering, out of this presence. But Jesus is passing by your way. Maybe you just want to thank him from the depths of your soul and say, "I'm not I'm not going to rob him. I'm not going to I'm not going to rob him of my thanksgiving. I'm going to praise him. I'm going to thank him. I'm going to worship him. It's a very great secret young people that we need to learn is he loves to hear. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you. You're the worthy one. &gt;&gt; I bless your holy name. &gt;&gt; I thank you for what you're doing in my life. Nods are wonderful, but he loves to hear your voice. He loves to dwell amongst the praise and the praise is just a thanksgiving from your heart. Heavenly Father, how can we say thanks for the things that you have done for us service after service after service tonight Lord very special because Lord the word went out and as the scripture says it healed the people. Heal your people tonight, Lord, as they've opened up their hearts and opened up their lips of praise and thanksgiving. It only takes a moment in your presence, Lord. How often your prophet said, "Just go rejoicing. Just go rejoicing." And they went rejoicing. And Jesus said, "Just go believing. Go rejoicing." And so Lord, we want to rejoice tonight that the word of God has been anchored deep within our hearts. God, make it a reality. Make it a substance faith, Lord Jesus.
