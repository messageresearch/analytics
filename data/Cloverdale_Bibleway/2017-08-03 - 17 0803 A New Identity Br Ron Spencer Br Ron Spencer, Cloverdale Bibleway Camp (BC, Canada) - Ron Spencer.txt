Who's happy to be here tonight? I am too. Praise the Lord. Nice to see you all here. I think we're going to need a little bit um some trouble on that rather than base. We welcome you away camp 2017. Each that have made it, we feel honored that you're here. From the youngest to the oldest, from as far away as Europe, all the way across Canada. God bless you. The bride is indeed coming together. &gt;&gt; This could be the very last camp we'll ever see. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be marvelous? &gt;&gt; Just think that God has waited for all this time. I see the uh Marian and Michael's sons up here and brother Ed Hammermeers boys up here. I knew them when they were that small. I'm getting scared. Time is going on, but we're ready for one thing. We're ready for a change. &gt;&gt; We're ready for rapture. &gt;&gt; That's what the camp's all about, young people. To catch the vision of why God has called us and where we are going. &gt;&gt; We feel very privileged and honored to have brother Ron Spencer here at this camp to be our speaker. Brother Ron is from Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle in Elton, Virginia. That's a mouthful. He's a wonderful friend of mine, a wonderful man of God, and we feel honored to have brother Ron for him accepting our invitation to have Sister Connie here as dear wife. We thank God for their lives and what they've meant to all of us over the years. We can go back to many camps where God has moved on our behalf and we want to give God the glory and we want to say, "Lord, one more time, would you move?" &gt;&gt; We're not coming here to see a minister. minister, you've come here to pull on the gift of God, &gt;&gt; and we want to see God move. I don't want you looking around the tent. I want you to be focused on the word of God and what the man of God, what God has laid upon his heart. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning, we have our brother David Mayor all the way from Switzerland. Brother David, Sister Anne, would you stand please? Brother David will be taking the morning devotion. We feel privileged to have you here. God bless you. We're looking forward to it. Glory. I don't know how come brother Derek welcomed me. I've been a fixture here for 32 years at every camp. Just a fixture. And I feel privileged to be able to be a part of it. And it doesn't happen by one man. It happens with a group of people that have a vision and the mommies and the daddies and the sacrifice that you have made. But there is a guest that's not here tonight. Our pastor, Brother Ed and Sister Ruth, we want to welcome you on the internet. We want to show you our love and your appreciation for your vision to have this camera. Praise God. I think you can say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; PRAISE OUR GOD. WHERE WOULD WE BE IF GOD WOULDN'T COME IN A CAMP LIKE THIS? Move on our children's behalf and move on our behalf. Brother Biscll, Sister Biscll, we can't thank you enough. &gt;&gt; We can't thank you enough. &gt;&gt; And that's not raising up a man. That's recognizing the gift. And he's a man of God whether anybody likes it or not. And I'll stand behind him. I have these many years and I know you do, too. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother Ed and Sister Ruth. Our lovely Lord Jesus is here, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know he's here. &gt;&gt; I know he's here. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you. I don't know what God's going to do the first night, but I'm expecting the unexpected. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting God to do exceedingly abundantly. I don't even know if there's going to be a Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's my expectation. May God use Brother Ron Spencer in a supernatural way. Let's go throw away our churchianity. We've come to camp. WE'VE COME TO HEAR FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what camp's all about, isn't it? We can have fellowship one another. We can go off the grounds and praising God. Nobody has to tell us what to do except you got to listen to me. But isn't that marvelous that we can concentrate now fully God has given us now from now to Sunday to keep our minds focused on thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; on the word of God. We want to welcome all those on the internet around the world on those that will be on the archives. May the Holy Spirit bless you as he has blessed us already in this service. I want the campers to realize the camp does not happen just to happen. We want to be able to we'll be taking up offerings every night and that will be for uh love offering to our our precious brother Ron and for expenses. So don't this is this don't get seized up. I'll tell you what, if if we were like our pastor, we would be a very given church. And you are a given church. And young people, you need to grow up into that. So, we want you to expect that. I see those three and $4 coffees. Throw them down a double makiato. I don't even know what if I'm even saying it right. Makiatta. Whatever. We can buy a coffee. We can give offerings to God and watch God come down. It's warm. &gt;&gt; Anybody told you that lately? &gt;&gt; It's warm and I understand that it's warm and we were we're going to have water stations outside uh the tents coming into the camp or into the tent. I would like you if you feel that at all you're dehydrated at all, please take your water before you come in into the service. And I'm 63 years old. I've never left church for a drink of water. I've preached in the hottest places around the world. And I respect God that much that I don't want to interrupt the moving of the Holy Spirit. And so you can think the devil just said, "You're thirsty." Of course, we're all thirsty. And especially when brother Ron takes a drink, you'll be more thirsty. Get over it. We have come to meet with God. &gt;&gt; And so we want the least amount of movement as possible. God bless you young people. You've had a blessed day today. You will tomorrow. And we just want you to have the most glorious camp you've ever had. But we have come to meet with Christ. And so we want to thank God once again. We want to welcome brother Ron Spencer to the pulpit. And we just ask God to have his will and his way. Let's all stand as we welcome brother Spencer, my friend, minister of the gospel. I'm amazed that you love me. Well, I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed how you preious I found you. And I see &gt;&gt; I see the world are all washed away. All I see. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just lift your hands to him? Why don't you tell him? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm amazed. Oh, I'm amazed. You love me. I'm amazed. I preface. I to your preious I sash away all my sins. God bless you. Amen. Certainly good to be with you and certainly thank you for all that you have done for me. So good to see each and every one of you friends from a lot of places. We I appreciate what brother Tom said about brother Ed. Brother Ed is a dear friend of ours and he's been a a legend and a hero in our lives for way long time &gt;&gt; and u the first time I ever met brother Tom was in Murphy'sboro Tennessee and he was there to be with brother Ed in the meetings and I had red hair then and uh so that's been a few days ago we thankful to have sister Connie with and we're just honored to have her. I see some Edmonton faces that that was at Edmonton last week and we had a wonderful meeting there and uh good to have brother David Mayor with us and and that Switzerland attraction and so we're so glad that that to hear from him this week. We love you with all of our hearts. I happen to believe that God is going to do some incredible things. &gt;&gt; I I just I just I just believe that with all my heart. I believe that the same God, the same God that many years ago when I brought my son Andrew and Matthew, my daughter Whitney to this meeting, Andrew was a boy that was just floating along. And in his floating along, he he had become married and he'd been raised right. He had heard the message of the hour. He never missed a service, but he was the kind of young man that had different draw. He just didn't have that it. He came to this meeting and his wife, they they were kind of a fixture about where Sister Connie would be in that in that tent setting. And as the meeting would go on, there'd be something things begin to take place. I believe it was on Monday after that meeting. Maybe I've got that date wrong, but on Monday after that meeting, we were to take a day off. And that day, Brother Joel Ray, God would come and supernaturally in just a matter of a few moments changed his life. And I would hold that very dear to my heart. And and uh and a couple hours later, we were standing and I was standing in the street and I looked down the street and there stood Brother Tom Ray with Brother Andrew. God supernaturally touched that young man. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take four services. It doesn't take a lifetime of trying to get it figured out. &gt;&gt; He can come to your pew even right now. &gt;&gt; And all the questions and all of the struggles that you have been fighting through, &gt;&gt; maybe even today or this week or this year, &gt;&gt; and you've come to the end of your rope, I want to tell you tonight, you're not the one that's hanging on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is determined to have his seed. &gt;&gt; That's what this meeting is all about. &gt;&gt; God is after his seed. &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly where you're at. &gt;&gt; And he's not embarrassed. &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; And in just a moment, I believe that he can touch your life. &gt;&gt; That's why this meeting means more than life to me. because I've seen him &gt;&gt; so many times. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't have to beg him to come. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I want to see something supernaturally, just look around. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here." &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you see him by your your eye or why are there you feel him by your fleshly senses. I want you to become aware &gt;&gt; that he the unseen guest is in the building. &gt;&gt; Now I just have one request to you just before we would go to prayer. I want you to invite him just now. I want you to invite him. &gt;&gt; So many times we want our favorite preacher to to invite him. But I want you to invite him. I want you to personally invite him to where you're at. Let's pray. Almighty God, just now I stand behind this sacred desk and only eternity will tell us what has happened in this meeting and what will happen even this week. Lord, I stop to give you thanks for Brother Ed Biscll and all of his incredible work, his vision, his mission. Lord, for the team that has been impacted by Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may the Jesus that he met come in this building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank you for every worker that has that has put in untold hours untold hours to prepare this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord, help us just now to get ourselves out of the way &gt;&gt; that we don't miss you passing by. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're more than our favorite preacher's voice. Lord, you're more than the entertainment of song or even a the preacher saying certain words, but I pray just now that you would come to every heart, &gt;&gt; not just in this tent, but around the world. Father, &gt;&gt; oh God, I ask you to ignite my my lips and anoint our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you even as this meeting progresses, strengthen our vocal cords. Yes, &gt;&gt; the enemy would like to stress those and cause them to deteriorate. &gt;&gt; But I believe in a God that you can give us favor &gt;&gt; till they would even strengthen as the weak goes. &gt;&gt; And at the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, WE BIND every enemy &gt;&gt; that would try to block the visitation of God. &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you'd come among us in a mighty way, oh God. Lord, we sense your presence even now. &gt;&gt; Now we ask you to take these words of eternal life and let it live in our hearts. &gt;&gt; May we be faithful representatives of your gospel. Help us this afternoon. We pray &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We ask you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And an amen and amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you for your patience with me. I'm from the south and it takes us a long time to just say hello. If you will turn with me to John chapter 4 and verse 6. Certainly love you. Certainly hope that we can shake your hand before this meeting is over and and uh spend a moment with you. But if I don't get the chance to in eternity, we'll sit down and talk it all over with you. Amen. We love you. John chapter 4 and verse 6. I want to speak tonight if the Lord can help me, and I know he will, on a new identity. John chapter 4 and verse six. Now, Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, set thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour, and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus sth unto her, Give me to drink. For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat. And then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew, askketh drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. And Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest. I'd like for you to just look at those words. If thou kneest the gift of God, and who is this that saith to thee, give me to drink? Thou wouldest ask of him, and he would have given thee living water. You may be seated. Is that okay? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We live in a world that it tells us in Leotaa to discover ourself. Tells us that we should explore so many things and not be held back or restricted from anything. Here was a woman that that was coming to the well today and her past was quite a story. Every one of us have a story here today. &gt;&gt; Every one of us has has a story and sometimes our story is much like the scriptures. There are individuals in the scriptures that maybe just one word is said about them. one word in the entire scripture. But I have to say you this to you that would be a cite quite an honor that your name be written in the sacred writings of God. &gt;&gt; And by revelation we realize that our names are written there. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of them have maybe a sentence &gt;&gt; that is written about them. &gt;&gt; Some a few scriptures. Some will be chapters and maybe even books, men like Abraham, Moses, they will they will have an innumerable amount of scriptures that will be written about them. David, some of those scriptures are very complimentary, if we could say it, complimentary to them of their lives. But there are or other portions that maybe if they were able to to be in control of the writings, they might say, "I I would rather that that's not written there." &gt;&gt; Because being human beings, we we can look in the mirror. There's some things that we're disappointed about oursel. I sat beside behind a young man last night in service and I looked over at my wife and I said, "You know, that young man is probably was probably taller than me at his birth." You know, if I'd have had some control over it, I I would have liked to been just a bit taller. There's some things I can't reach. There were times in the services last night, there was times I couldn't see. &gt;&gt; There's things about us we would all like to change about oursel. &gt;&gt; But you see, we were not in control of that. &gt;&gt; God knew what he wanted and how he wanted us to look. And maybe tonight you're sitting here, you're thinking, "Well, you know, Brother Ron, I I've been invited to this meeting. I've came to this meeting. I've been raised up in church and and I've said as a family member of the church and, you know, maybe I'm a new I'm a new person in the congregation and and you know, God's never did anything for me and I've never seen anything great. I I hear the stories and you know the stories that are just that that are so familiar to me, but there's really no reality. I want to remind you just to get you here is a great big deal. &gt;&gt; You see, God pre-planned you before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knew when you would be born and what you would look like and how long your nose would be and what color eyes that you would have and your height and your stature. He even knew the weaknesses that you would struggle with all of your life. &gt;&gt; He knew all of that. He knew the choices that you would make. &gt;&gt; But he did not predestinate you on your choices. He elected you on his choice. &gt;&gt; And when he thought of you before the foundation of the world, God is an infinite God. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know about time. And and time doesn't make a whole lot of difference to him. You see, God thought of you in the eternities. So if he ever thought of you, &gt;&gt; you are as eternal as Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand tonight, it isn't you that was seeking for God. &gt;&gt; You were born in your family. You took on your family's nature. Some of those things you're very proud of. Some of them you're not so proud of. Brother Random talks about his own mother and father Charles and and Ella Brandham and he he says you know uh at one place he said you know he said I have a I have a a a earthly mother and father he says but there's some things I'm not so proud of but I'm real proud of my heavenly father &gt;&gt; you know he even fought some of the things that they handed him in their personal DNA &gt;&gt; as it came through their natural lineage. There was things that he had to struggle with all of his life and scars that he had to deal with. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WAS BIG enough &gt;&gt; to help him with every one of those things. &gt;&gt; That same God has come to where you're at tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so many times we look at our personal identification of maybe what our name is. &gt;&gt; And we we we know our name because our mother told us our name. We know our name because it was rehearsed to us over and over again. And you're just thankful there's not 26 letters in your name. It would. And I apologize for those that are. I'm not throwing a stone. But you begin and you the governments begin to give you certain numbers that you go by. It is told to us that every one of us have a different fingerprint. Every one of us have a different image in our eye. Our eyes are different. Uh there we have a signature that we deal with. You see nobody is like you. &gt;&gt; Nobody else on the earth. Even if you have 14 identical twins or whatever you want to say, none of them are exactly like you. &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS, &gt;&gt; where you're at, &gt;&gt; and what your situations are. &gt;&gt; God comes seeking for you. You didn't go seeking for him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me just now? Amen. &gt;&gt; In the scriptures, we we read about a man that was named and literally the scriptures even identify him &gt;&gt; as blind Barabus. &gt;&gt; You see, there's many characters in the scriptures that will tell us of Rahab the harlot. &gt;&gt; You understand the names identified who they were and their old book told us a lot of things about their THEIR LIFESTYLE. BLIND Barameus it's very easy to understand that that he he had grew and he had become accustomed THAT THIS WAS HIS LIFESTYLE. Now understand his community realized that he was the blind man that was in the city. &gt;&gt; He was the man that other people looked out for. He was a man that was he was they that they had become accustomed to. He was blind. They had become to the that this is just life. children would grow up and understand that's blind Barameus. &gt;&gt; Blind Barnameus always would have someone that no doubt that would lead him to the place to where he begged for umps or where that he stood every day. But I want you to understand WHEN HE WAS JUST A CHILD, only a prophet OF GOD WOULD LOOK BACK IN THIS day and begin to tell a story about blind Barnameus and tell us that when he was a child, &gt;&gt; THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD TAKE HIM UP ON HER LAP AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT JEHOVAH, GOD, &gt;&gt; a living God, a a God of reality. And though THE CIRCUMSTANCE BE AS DIFFICULT as he was, let me just understand that this today. His difficulty OF BLINDNESS DID NOT BOTHER GOD'S PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. &gt;&gt; God knew this was the condition that he would be born in. He knows your condition. &gt;&gt; He knows your disease. He knows your genetic CODE THAT YOU FOUGHT THROUGH THROUGH YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How about I come unclipped there, Brother John? &gt;&gt; He knows all of those things in your life. &gt;&gt; God doesn't get nervous with that. &gt;&gt; God understands that. Today, blind Barnameus would be standing. He'd be standing at his place. Brother Brandon said it was kind of a chilly day. That's not here tonight. It was kind of a chilly day. And so he backed up against the wall to warm himself in the presence of the sun. And he said there was there was some noise that was coming. Wherever Jesus is, is always a lot of noise. And so and so Bardameus that morning was thinking about what his mother taught him. &gt;&gt; And she WAS THINKING HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT HE TOLD SHE TOLD HIM OF all the prophets told him all the the things of the miracles. She rehearsed these things in his ears. Today he would hear some miracles coming up the way. NOW YOU SEE HIS PAST life had a lot of restrictions. &gt;&gt; But after HE WOULD LEAVE THE WALL TODAY, &gt;&gt; he would no longer be known as blind Barameus. &gt;&gt; He would GET A NEW IDENTITY TODAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This woman that WE JUST READ TO YOU ABOUT WAS A HARLOT. She came to the well only at this time of day. I find it absolutely interesting that that our prophet would talk about her almost every service. &gt;&gt; Almost every service he would begin to talk to about her. Maybe in the great eternity she might understand what really happened to her on that day. But you see, up until THIS POINT, SHE STRUGGLED WITH THE circumstances of life. &gt;&gt; She had a weakness with men that that there WAS NOTHING ABOUT SIN could quench the thirst that she had. &gt;&gt; Let me JUST SAY THAT HER BOOK &gt;&gt; had a lot of scars in it. It had an incredible amount of difficulties in it. MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING HERE TONIGHT AND SAID, "BROTHER RON, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW MY STORY." I DON'T, BUT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU BROUGHT SOME EXCUSES to the tent. And let me just say this. I may not be talking TO ANYBODY HERE, BUT I BELIEVE I am. I'm talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; This little woman had great difficulty in her life. Now, let me just say, God deposited something on the inside of you, and you can try to drown it with all of sin's vices. &gt;&gt; You can try to drown it with SOME OF THE DRUGS and the sins and the the dope and and the world and its rock music and all of its nonsense and all of the education that you can get. BUT THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT A PREDESTINATED SEED. THERE'S A LONGING THAT'S INSIDE OF THERE THAT'S way beyond yourself. &gt;&gt; And there's NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT WILL QUENCH THAT BUT HIM. &gt;&gt; There's nothing THAT WILL QUENCH THAT BUT HIM. &gt;&gt; NOW, LET ME JUST SAY SOME OF US are real good runners. We can run from God. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just SAY THIS. YOU GOD'S A VERY PATIENT GOD. HE KNOWS WHERE TO meet you at. This woman goes to the well. Well, Jesus understands the circumstances. He also understands humanity that would be around him. So, he sends the rest of the disciples away because they might have some some attitudes about this woman. But I want you to understand, God knows &gt;&gt; and God is not ashamed. &gt;&gt; NOW, SATAN TRIES TO KILL, TO STEAL, and to destroy. And if there is a chance that there's a predestinated seed inside of there, he will try to take your first nature &gt;&gt; and try to bury you &gt;&gt; in SCARS AND EMOTIONS AND TURMOIL OF your life. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S A PRESENCE WITHIN this room tonight &gt;&gt; THAT CAN WASH AWAY EVERY bit &gt;&gt; of the enemy's destruction. This woman would leave her house known as the harlot. BUT PASTOR JESUS WOULD COME BY. &gt;&gt; Pastor Jesus would come by if we could say this. &gt;&gt; And this is a woman that's going to be represented in his church. NOW UNDERSTAND, GOD KNOWS what's going to happen in this tent tonight. This is not news to God. &gt;&gt; He's only been waiting for you to come to your position. &gt;&gt; You see, he was here way BEFORE YOU ARRIVED IN your seat. &gt;&gt; He knew the color of shirt, the color of dress that you would have on, how your HAIR WOULD BE DONE. HE KNEW HOW your attitude would be. He was just waiting on you to arrive. &gt;&gt; I want you to UNDERSTAND THIS IS WAY BEYOND HUMANITY. This is way BEYOND GIFTS OF PREACHING. THIS IS GOD IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS how to find you. &gt;&gt; I can just see Jesus's eyes as she begins to arrive at the well. You see, he knows. &gt;&gt; He's been sent here on a mission. &gt;&gt; He's watching. He's watching her. And he begins to talk to her and she begins to shrug him off. How many times have we shrugged him off before? &gt;&gt; How many times we've sat through meetings? How many times that we've listened to our pastors preach to us &gt;&gt; and literally give portions of their lives and we SAT THERE AND SHRUGGED IT OFF. &gt;&gt; WE JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF ANOTHER NIGHT. WE SHRUGGED IT OFF another night and we ONLY INCREASE THE paperwork &gt;&gt; of our old life. &gt;&gt; We only increase the turmoil that's happened in our lives. &gt;&gt; What's going to fix me? LET ME JUST SAY A LIBRARY BOOK OR A BOOK AT BARNES & NOBLE, A BOOK OFF OF AMAZON OF OF SELF-HELP, THAT WILL NOT FIX YOU. &gt;&gt; That will not fix you. WELL, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? A matter of a few moments &gt;&gt; and he begins to talk to her and he picks up her weakness. And he begins to say some words, "Go get your husband." And she quickly responds, "I have none." You hear brother Brandham in this in the prayer lines. He begins to talk to people and he tells them, "Don't get nervous. There's something standing between you and I." You recognize that. Don't let that make you nervous. That's him. That's him. And you see, you can see it in deep. Call it through the deep. how how that people begin to react in that presence and then our prophet begins to tell them what their name is. Well, that shouldn't shock them though that they know that. Then he tells them their address. &gt;&gt; Well, well, they know that. Then he begins to talk about and sometimes you can listen to him tell them between 14 up to 20ome different things that are about them &gt;&gt; to increase their faith &gt;&gt; that they recognize they're standing in more than the presence of a man. And if you're careful tonight, God will take his his anointed word of God and begin TO TELL YOU NOT JUST ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF, BUT HE'LL TELL YOU MULTIPLE things about yourself. Even to the POINT THAT YOU THINK SOMEBODY HAS WENT AND TOLD ON ME. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, IT'S NOT THE man that knows, it's the God that knows. And if you can ever get your turtle shell to kind of get loose a little bit and just realize that this IS GOD THAT IS TALKING to me &gt;&gt; and this is an important meeting with God. &gt;&gt; For the patients on the prayer line, if they don't get what they need, many of them are going to die. the cancer that they've walked to the to the to the platform with that cancer will eat them up. &gt;&gt; And if they don't touch Jesus &gt;&gt; and if their faith doesn't arise, &gt;&gt; they they can have thus sayeth THE LORD SET OVER THEM multiple times, but if their faith don't arise to the challenge of the hour and they MISS JESUS CHRIST, THEY'LL ONLY GO HOME AND DIE. OH, IF YOUR FAITH CAN'T ARISE TONIGHT. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; OH, IF YOU CAN GET BEYOND YOURSELF AND REALIZE HE'S HERE TO MEET YOUR NEED. &gt;&gt; He's here to call your name. He knows where YOU LIVE AT. HE KNOWS THE TURMOIL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH. &gt;&gt; You do not HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS RAHAB THE HARLOT. &gt;&gt; You do not HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS JACOB. HE'S HERE TO MEET YOU AND TRANSFORM your life. &gt;&gt; Brother Random tells about a place that he read that there was a man and the religions of the world had gathered together, Buddhist, Muhammad amongst many other religions. They each gave their their speech of of what they their gods was and the power of him. And this man stood to his feet and he began to present them a story of of Lady Makabe. She came from Oklahoma. She lived during the days of of of of wagons and horses. And she had been identified as a murderer. And she had been identified as a very bad woman. They would even want to tarn and feather this woman and they would even want to refuse to even put their hands on her. He begin to present this horrible story of this life, this life. And he begins to tell them about this horrible story of life and how this woman has lived. HE BEGINS TO TELL THEM OF WHAT A DEGRADATION that sin has caused. And then he begins to challenge them. Which of your gods &gt;&gt; which of your gods &gt;&gt; can wash your hands &gt;&gt; of all of our sin? &gt;&gt; I realize I'm preaching to a to a congregation that is in the internet. I realize that there are believers that are listening and amening. Some of my favorite people are watching from a far distance, but I also realize some of my critics are. Some of Jesus CHRIST'S CRITICS ARE. &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHICH OF YOUR GODS OF THEOLOGY? &gt;&gt; Which of your institutions OF SEMINARIES? WHICH OF YOUR GODS CAN COME AND CLEANSE HEARTS AND transform souls? &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT TO PUT SOME BOUNDARIES HERE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT a learn behavior. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A YESTERDAY'S DOCTRINE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TRANSFORMING OF A NEW LIFE &gt;&gt; WHERE A DROP OF INK CAN GO DOWN INSIDE OF A BLEACH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND GOD CAN TRANSFORM YOU FROM A FROM AN OLD FILTHY HABITS AND TRANSFORM YOU AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN THE SAME ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Now I want to SAY THIS TO YOU. MY GOD &gt;&gt; IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE. &gt;&gt; I want to JUST TELL YOU MY GOD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALCOHOLIC SYNONYMOUS. You don't have to go who through a rehab center. &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO SIT FOR 45 years &gt;&gt; and GO THROUGH A COUNSEL SESSION EVERY WEEK OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; BUT MY GOD CAN CLEANSE YOUR habits &gt;&gt; and cleanse your lifestyle. &gt;&gt; And literally IN ONE AFTERNOON SESSION WITH HIM, &gt;&gt; IT'S AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT MY FRIENDS, BROTHER, ANYBODY THAT TAKES YOU AWAY FROM JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; is not your friend. &gt;&gt; ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM GOD IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I've had a lot of friends, a lot of associates, a lot of businessmen, a lot of people around me that have been my my friends, friends that that I that I have to occupy this this world with. But you see, WE'RE ON TWO DIFFERENT COURSES. &gt;&gt; I may have to live in THIS WORLD, BUT I'M NOT OF THIS WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND I REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T me giving up my friends. My friends got rid of me. I realized when I WENT TO A SERVICE LIKE TONIGHT, my grandmother, who had read about everything at print at that time, she was in her 60s. She could outcurse most sailors. Forgive me if I have to tell you that. She was a hightempered woman. She was a stubborn individual, but she had been a a supervisor of a major manufacturer for many, many years. I'd lived a horrible life at that point. For some reason, only God knows that evening there was going to be a weekend special services. And that evening, I looked at her and I told her, "I'll go if you'll go. Now, I'd heard a lot of incredible preaching. Your pastor had preached to me before as a boy. I'd enjoyed his his preaching. And of all of the men that that I heard preach as a boy, he's the one that I remembered. And I did a lot of bad things. And I don't want to go into it tonight, but I'd wound up homeless. I'd wound up in drugs. But here I have returned home. When I saw a play this week about returning home, would my family receive me? &gt;&gt; You see, I knew what was real. &gt;&gt; I knew what was real. I'd been raised in that which was real. &gt;&gt; I went home and was living with my grandmother and I told her, I said, "I'll go to church if you'll go." I never expected her to go. She went, SHE SAT ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. I sat on the other side of the building. You see, I THOUGHT I'D DROP MY GRANDMOTHER OFF AND go to a party later that night. So, so I had picked up some alcohol and put it in the back of my car, and I was armed for battle. I had intentions of what I was going to do. I was going to satisfy my mother and father by coming to church and surprise them. I never thought my grandmother would COME. AND THERE WAS A service that was preached that night. I couldn't tell you what the sermon was, BUT ALL I KNOW WHO I MET IN that building. &gt;&gt; Who I met in THAT BUILDING WAS MORE THAN MY DADDY OR MY mom or my fa the the speaker that would be there that night. I'd never hear him ever preach again. But but you see, I met him. &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF FINDING THE DOOR TO LEAVE, I FOUND AN ALTAR. &gt;&gt; WHEN I FINISHED SOBBING MY WAY to Calvary, I looked to my right and there was my grandmother down at the altar. &gt;&gt; When we left that service, I MADE A STOP at a trash can. And I emptied that car. &gt;&gt; You see, I didn't need that habit no more. &gt;&gt; I didn't need those things no more. &gt;&gt; Because he came in the room. &gt;&gt; If you could only identify the voice that is behind the voice. &gt;&gt; There was a man that could be maybe qualified as a believer. He'd even been with Jesus for for now over three years. &gt;&gt; This man had seen some incredible miracles. &gt;&gt; This man had been a participant in some phenomenal things. As a matter of fact, there was a revelation that was dropped into his heart that Jesus was the Christ. But you see, it would TAKE MORE THAN JUST BELIEVING. It would take more than just identify him as the Christ. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN JUST TELLING STORIES. &gt;&gt; You see, you see, we need MORE THAN JUST GOD TO ANOINT US. &gt;&gt; We need MORE THAN JUST TO COME INTO a meeting and and then continuously leave the same way. Right. &gt;&gt; We need more than just to be able to rehearse the stories of our pastor &gt;&gt; and and brother Brandham stories. &gt;&gt; But we NEED TO HAVE THAT JESUS &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS LIVE in our lives &gt;&gt; where IT BECOMES A PERSONAL TESTIMONY &gt;&gt; OF WHAT THAT JESUS DOES FOR YOU. Jesus one day turned around to him and said,"Simon, &gt;&gt; Simon, Satan hath desired to have you." &gt;&gt; That he might sift you. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; As wheat? &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you tonight. I don't know your name, so I want you to just call your name right here. Run. Run. Audience participation will be real nice. &gt;&gt; Run, run. &gt;&gt; Behold, Satan has desired to have you. &gt;&gt; Well, why would he want me? Now, LET'S JUST ASK A QUESTION. WHY WOULD HE WANT ME? &gt;&gt; Why would he be giving me &gt;&gt; RON SPENCER SUCH A HARD TIME &gt;&gt; TO ENGULF ME IN DRUGS AND alcohol and the things of the world? &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, SATAN DOESN'T HAVE FORESIGHT like God does. You see, GOD WOULD SEE US AS A PART OF THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD SEE US AS A PART OF THOUSANDS OF MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; SO, THERE'S JUST UNLIMITED POTENTIAL IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THAT OUGHT TO ME. THAT MAKES ME ALMOST feel like getting a little excited. &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT KNOW OUR BEFORE. &gt;&gt; ALSO KNOWS OUR AFTER. &gt;&gt; NOW, you're sitting here and I don't know your ages. Wouldn't want to guess. I'm not good at it. and you're sitting here and and you say, "Well, Brother Ron, I'm I I'm a believer and I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I received the Holy Ghost." But it's more than just one feeling. It's many refillings. &gt;&gt; Now, many sitting in this building has had great victories, &gt;&gt; incredible victories. I could stop and talk about brother Kelvin and Sister Melody &gt;&gt; whom I've been a part of their lives for several years now and and I COULD STOP AND TALK ABOUT SEVERAL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Is Joel in the building? Joel here? I don't know. Well, I I don't either. Joel's wife's here. Now you're real real thankful. A name. What's her name? &gt;&gt; Kim. Sorry, brother Glenn. Now, Sister Kim is thankful. She's thankful for the story of the before and the after. But you see, her life would have been much different. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Her life would have been much different had there not been a meeting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME IN HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND HIS HIS MOM AND DAD WERE DESPERATE. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter WHO HIS FATHER WAS AND mother was or his grandfather AND HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS. IT DIDN'T MATTER. &gt;&gt; Satan had an ambition to destroy him. And he WAS LITERALLY JUST TAKING JOEL'S own ambitions. &gt;&gt; Joel, you can FORGIVE ME LATER. JOEL'S OWN AMBITIONS and his own desires and he was just living them up and he was just LOOKING FOR THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY in life &gt;&gt; AND MOM WAS DESPERATE AND DAD WAS DESPERATE &gt;&gt; CUZ WE WANT MORE THAN SUCCESS FINANCIALLY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We want you to have MORE THAN THE BIGGEST HOUSE AND THE BEST CAR AND THE BIGGEST DEGREE. YOU can have A DEGREES OF SO MUCH ON THE WALL THAT YOU have more than a thermometer. &gt;&gt; BUT LET ME JUST SAY WHEN IT COMES TO ETERNAL LIFE, THAT DOESN'T MATTER NONE. &gt;&gt; You can have the best car THAT THERE IS. YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST HOUSE THAT THERE IS. That don't matter to God. Eternal life is not inherited. &gt;&gt; And I say this to you and I'll repent before God one day. His grandfather is a great hero to me. And I've listened to him preach masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece. And I hope you've appreciated that. But all of that, all of those sermons DOES NOT EXTEND DOWN TO THE SUCCESSION OF eternal life. &gt;&gt; Get mad at me, throw a stone if you want to, but it doesn't matter what your last name is. &gt;&gt; There's no free pass here. Even Jer John uh Jesus turns to to to to &gt;&gt; Nicodemus &gt;&gt; and he PREACHES HIS FIRST DOCTRINE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND HE PREACHES IT TO A MAN THAT KNOWS the entire scriptures. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you even now. You can have done all the good works. &gt;&gt; You can work your way. You can work 20 hours a day for church. You can work your way. Do you know that you can work so much you backslide? And I find even technical people and even people that are very helpful around church, I may be preaching now, &gt;&gt; will find THAT THEY WORK UNTIL THEIR PRAYER LIFE diminishes &gt;&gt; and THEY BECOME STAGNANT and literally become BECOME TO THE PLACE AND TO where they lose THAT REAL ZEAL FOR GOD. THEY FORGET WHAT THE IMPORTANT PART IS. The basis for that is I was sitting in the room this afternoon and God dealt with me to go just that way. Don't get secure. Don't get secure thinking I'VE SAT IN CHURCH ALL MY LIFE and everything's all right &gt;&gt; because many time we've seen people backslide &gt;&gt; people that has never missed a service &gt;&gt; but they're sitting THERE COLD AS AN ICE CUBE &gt;&gt; WITH NO RESPONSE TO THE word &gt;&gt; and feel entitled &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THEIR POSITION. And they're missing who's really appearing in the building. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm going to need a little BIT MORE THAN THAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE SAT ON THE PLATFORM WITH BROTHER BRANDHAM? &gt;&gt; HUNDREDS OF PREACHERS SAT ON THE PLATFORM WITH BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THEY WATCHED INCREDIBLE SERMONS PREACHED &gt;&gt; AND HOW THAT HE THROW HIS LITTLE SHOULDERS BACK AFTER A BIT AND SAY, "I'M WAITING ON SOMETHING." AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then when he would WHEN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WOULD COME IN THE ROOM, HE'S HERE. I TAKE EVERY SPIRIT UNDER MY CONTROL. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT A STATEMENT THAT IS? &gt;&gt; No human being can make that statement. &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD CAN TAKE EVERY &gt;&gt; SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Cuz let me just say this to you, YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR OWN SPIRIT. Can't control a dog hardly. &gt;&gt; Thousands of people sitting there. But how many men sat behind the prophet of God and missed who is this Melzdc? &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain? &gt;&gt; Maybe their names were called. I'm not being facitious tonight, but let's just think about this. If we gain the whole WORLD AND WE LOSE OUR SOUL, WHAT PROFITS? &gt;&gt; Jesus is looking at ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES LIKE I'M PREACHING TO YOU tonight and he realizes SIMON DOESN'T HAVE IT. I didn't come to play games. &gt;&gt; I could care less if my name's ever called in your conversations. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know him. &gt;&gt; I want you to know Jesus. I want you to know this Jesus who's God &gt;&gt; that fills all time, space, and eternity. &gt;&gt; He wants to live in your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. He does. &gt;&gt; He wants to be more than your favorite scripture. &gt;&gt; He wants to live in your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Simon, Satan has desired to have you. He's desired to have you. How many of you ever sometimes get up and you're living a normal life and then all of the sudden just something feels like almost moody. It's just swept into your life. just feels like what's wrong with this whole picture today? Satan's come to try you. &gt;&gt; He's come to war with you. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're attracted to the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you're attracted to the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; And you just pick it up. You're a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You pay your tithe. You go to church. You've been filled with the spirit of God for years. &gt;&gt; Satan knows I've only got a short time to work. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I can be filled with the HOLY GHOST AND STILL BE TEMPTED. ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHY YOU MUST HAVE HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU MUST HAVE HIM. AMEN. But &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I I've fallen over and over and OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DON'T LAY THERE. GET UP. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M ASHAMED TO BE IN THIS BUILDING. GET UP. &gt;&gt; GET UP. I DON'T NEED YOUR HISTORY. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPENT TO ME. Just get up. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; JESUS KNOWS YOU'RE IN THE BUILDING. GET UP. NOW, let me just say something to you that maybe we we know, but sometimes we're just not consciously aware of. Seems like sometimes they're just blocks that come on us. You see, he's very much aware of what's happened with you personally in the last just few moments, last weeks, last months, no matter your spiritual walk with God, how long you've been here, he knows the struggles that you've been going through. This is not just for the sinner tonight. &gt;&gt; This is for even men sitting on this platform. &gt;&gt; Even the speaker, &gt;&gt; our help is him. &gt;&gt; Our help is him. &gt;&gt; And he's just waiting for us &gt;&gt; to ask him for help. Simon, Satan desires to have you. What a trophy he would have been. &gt;&gt; What a trophy Tim Dodd would have been. &gt;&gt; What a trophy these men would have been. What a trophy you would have been. &gt;&gt; But God had different plans. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. You can't hold on yourself. &gt;&gt; You can make vows and YOU CAN MAKE PROMISES. David did. &gt;&gt; David continued to disappoint. Psalms 139, PSALMS 51 TELLS US, "CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART, OH GOD." &gt;&gt; He begged God, he wanted to build him a temple, but he really needed God to live inside of here. &gt;&gt; He really needed God to be in here. &gt;&gt; David knew David. And Simon, though he had been a part of a lot of things to today, he's looking at Jesus and he looks in his eyes like he's looked many other times and he knows. He knows. And Jesus said, "I I prayed for you. I prayed for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray for you. &gt;&gt; I'd like to tell this audience tonight, &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you, I prayed for you. &gt;&gt; I've interceded for you. &gt;&gt; I've mediated for you. &gt;&gt; I've become YOUR HIGH PRIEST FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I WENT TO CALVARY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; You all KNOW THE STORY HOW HE WOULD BE BESIDE OF A FIRESIDE AND PEOPLE SAY, "OH, YOU'VE BEEN AT one of those random meetings." Oh, I mean Jesus meetings. You go to that church down there. No, no, no. I It must be somebody looks like me. One, ARE YOU SURE THAT'S not you two? And after the third time, &gt;&gt; Jesus told him a clock would crow and somewhere there was a rooster that crowed &gt;&gt; that identified THE PROPHECY. THAT SIMON WOULD KNOW. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew this would come. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THIS would come. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME. &gt;&gt; He knew this HOUR WOULD COME. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED A ROOSTER to crow to you tonight. &gt;&gt; JUST REALIZE THAT THE WORD HAS SOUNDED FORTH &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS SHOWING YOU MERCY AND GRACE TONIGHT. Many of your parents are home or maybe your parents has driven multiple maybe 15 hours, 16 hours to bring you here, spend a lot of money, &gt;&gt; it's worth the investment. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Parents, I want you to understand tonight. &gt;&gt; If you're weighing your hourly WAGES AGAINST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS BUILDING, &gt;&gt; let me just SAY THIS IS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE. &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN AN ETERNAL LIFE. Joel stepped out on the on the balcony with me and he sat down. Now Joel probably didn't identify what was happening for a bit, but I felt a little wind stir, a little bit familiar with that wind. So, I just started talking and the Lord just led me down a path and I began to tell a story and Joel was just sitting listening. I'd like to hear how he saw this whole story. As I kind of looked out of the corner of my eye, Joel realized I wasn't talking about somebody else. &gt;&gt; That more than a buddy or his father's friend was talking to him. I can't rehearse what I told him, but all I know is Joel got up out of his seat. A complete different God. &gt;&gt; There's another young man I want to use here tonight before I finish this afternoon. I was sitting in my study. It was January and God was just pouring notes like I have on my page here today just pouring notes down. As I was writing these notes, his voice speaks to me. You will speak this sermon on a Wednesday night at Harold Hildebrance. I heard that and I thought, you know, I don't know so much about that. And I I must have heard that wrong. I have absolutely no plans ever in my life to be at brother Harold's on a Wednesday night. When I speak as a meeting, it's generally Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I'll never be there on Wednesday night. That's just me. One of my buddies is sitting here on this platform tonight. Brother Tim Dodd. About a month later, he calls me and said, "Brother Ron, I'd like for you to come and preach our meeting." And he says, "Now, you'll have to travel through Edmonton and you'll you'll come." And he said, "I want you I want you to come." And he I believe it was one of the first times ever coming to your place. So, uh, I just felt the tug in my heart to go. Was a week or so later, Brother Harold calls me and he said, "Brother Hon, I heard you going past our place going to brother Tim Dots." He said, "NOW THERE'S JUST NO USE in wasting the trip." He said, "I WANT YOU TO STOP, COME IN EARLY enough that you can preach Wednesday night service &gt;&gt; and then go on to brother brother Tims and preach that weekend." Almost immediately I &gt;&gt; I thought, "Here it is. &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I we we arranged the the setting of it, got the tickets, and I went just like tonight. I knew I was commissioned to be there. &gt;&gt; You see, I I I knew like tonight, I wouldn't preach the prettiest message in the world, but all I would do was present Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as I was preaching, there was a man that's a friend of mine named Brother Kim Dingwall. And here's how he's explained the story. His son's named Ben. AND BEN HAD DECIDED, I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE UP ON ALL of this and I'm going to go my own way. And and Brother Kim begins to explain to him, I'd really like for you to go to the service tonight. One of your favorite preachers is preaching, Brother Ron Spencer. And brother Ben somewhere SOMETHING RESPONDS IN HIS HEART beyond his own choices AND HE THINKS HE'S making the choice. &gt;&gt; I'll go one MORE TIME. WELL, THAT'S ALL GOD NEEDED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, I REMEMBER PREACHING there and Brother Kim's been a friend of mine for years and and I remember preaching and and I was I was preaching. I'd stayed in their home before and I remembered what it was like one time when I was in their home and one of the girls had gave up her bedroom and she was she was going to sleep somewhere else in the house and they were taking me to the airport the next morning. I REMEMBER GETTING DOWN ON MY KNEES and praying beside of their bed and I said, "Lord, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONE OF THEIR DAUGHTERS gave up their bed so I COULD SLEEP HERE, BUT I PRAY THAT YOU WOULD SUPERNATURALLY TOUCH THEIR LIVES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That next morning when I got up, brother Kim would take me to the airport and I said, "How was your night?" He said, "I was up all night." &gt;&gt; He called his daughter's name. HE SAID, "GOD CAME and met her during the night." And I've been praying with her all night. &gt;&gt; And that night as I was preaching, they were sitting to my left or I would be to their right or so to speak. They'd be sitting over in this direction. I remember brother Ben was sitting near a pole. HE WAS SHRUGGED DOWN IN THE SEAT. The best that my my look would be. HE WAS SHRUGGED DOWN IN THE SEAT. IF HE COULD ONLY endure one more promise. &gt;&gt; HE HAD PROMISED TONIGHT'S HIS LAST NIGHT. Is that right, brother Ben? You see, but God had different plans. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Ben was a good friend of my boys. My boys at that time could really identify with Ben cuz Ben was cool. My boys was in that phase of being cool. Ben was ADVENTUROUS AND THEY LIKE THAT ADVENTUROUS PART. They could, you know, those spirits could connect. Ben had came to service tonight. Ben no doubt had heard a lot of incredible preaching. Maybe even the po all the ministers sitting behind me. But tonight Jesus came. &gt;&gt; Though it be a Wednesday night service, &gt;&gt; though it might be a chance meeting, YOU SEE GOD knew &gt;&gt; months before. &gt;&gt; You see, God knows how to make things happen. Right. &gt;&gt; HE'LL DEAL WITH BROTHER TIM DODD to bring Ron Spencer. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S got a plan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't even know specifically everything that happened at your meeting, Brother Tim. I I don't remember. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; But you see, GOD HAD A PLAN. &gt;&gt; And God KNOW HE HE HE moved on BROTHER HAROLD CUZ GOD HAD A PLAN. THEN HE moved on, brother Kim. &gt;&gt; Cuz God had a plan. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WORKERS IN THE KITCHEN, ALL THE GROUNDS CREW, GOD'S GOT A PLAN. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GO COME WHERE YOU'RE AT &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S GOT A PLAN. &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD IDENTIFICATION HAD YOU BOUND AND YOU COULDN'T FIND ANY SATISFACTION. THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT JUST SEEMED THERE HAD TO BE MORE AND MORE AND MORE. &gt;&gt; As I finished toward the end of the sermon, I turned and watched the guy come up the altar. He didn't need to come to the front right here. Made his way to the altar. Brother Ben sets here tonight because of new identification. I don't know what kind of work he does. That doesn't matter. I don't know how much money is in his bank account. That don't matter. I'm sorry. I don't even know how many children that you got. That doesn't matter. I think two, right? So I only know that by a double double scooter today and I can count. But you see, God knows everything. &gt;&gt; God knows everything. &gt;&gt; You didn't know that we'd drive by and I'd see you sawing wood today and I already had you down in the notes. and he was bringing that saw down like this right here. I thought that's kind of interesting. &gt;&gt; He's in my notes tonight and he's up here sawing wood. You see, God knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you fought you didn't even want to come in this meeting. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU STRUGGLED. GOD KNOWS you struggle. Maybe you're a young man. I don't care whether your grandfather's a preacher or what. God wants to come to where you're at. &gt;&gt; He wants to come to your world where you're at. He's got plans. &gt;&gt; He's got plans for you. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'll just shrug it off. Okay. But how much longer will he deal with you? I would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had come to Christ at a young age like many of you sitting in here. I would not have to deal with many of the scars of my life if I would have only come. But you see, God didn't give up. &gt;&gt; You see, the God that knew my past continues to know my future. &gt;&gt; How did these two people get married? God knew. How did this one come from way over here? God knew. The greatest witness that you will ever be is a life that's met him. &gt;&gt; A life that's met him. &gt;&gt; Andrew preached in Edmonton with me last week. And as I sat there, I thought about this first service. the end of the service on Sunday night, the altar was packed all the way back through the aisles. It was packed and I thought Satan was trying to destroy him. We called Andrew our troubled child. He was one that was into everything. Ben, you might identify. I anointed his pillow. prayer cloths could have stuffed his pillow or even his mattress or the prayer cloth that I put in his bed. But all I knew was &gt;&gt; if he would ever meet him, &gt;&gt; he would ever meet him, &gt;&gt; he'd never be the same. Brother Tom, sometimes we just don't understand what's getting ready to happen. When a young man turns around to us and says, "I don't know that God. I don't personally know that God." Now, listen. I just want you to be honest with me just over the next few seconds because I'm finished. Would you just be honest with me now? Is it you trying or him living? &gt;&gt; Are you trying to Are you having to make yourself sit in that pew and make yourself go to church next week and make yourself do what's right? Or is it him living? Is this just a learned behavior or just something that's just the right thing to do? He's here to meet you. &gt;&gt; You can quote everything that brother Brandham said and that don't give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; You can be able to QUOTE ALL OF THIS RIGHT HERE and that will not give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the devil believes this right here. &gt;&gt; The devil withtood brother Brandham night after night after night. He believes this message. He's a real fighter of it, but he really believes it. &gt;&gt; The difference is him. &gt;&gt; The difference is him. &gt;&gt; Could I ask you to bow your heads just now? I apologize for being so long, but I've watched the spirit of the Lord move across this audience tonight. He's came to your pew. He's came to where you're at. You don't have to wait till the last service of this meeting. I would like for you to be honest just now, every eye closed, every head bowed. Would there be one here that would like to say, "Brother Ron, I need him." Let Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I need him. I really need him. They need him. Hands continued raised. Maybe you've been a Christian for a while and you just got a little cool on God. You'd like to say, "Brother Ron, I need a refreshing of the Holy Spirit tonight." Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Hallelujah. Now, I came to a very difficult part of the sermon tonight where he led me to workers, moms, dads, could you participate just now? Maybe maybe you've grown a little bit cool on God. You've did a lot of work, but you too have grown cool. You'd like to raise your hand before God. It don't matter what your name is. That's right. That's right. Won't you just raise it high just now? Nobody's looking. Nobody's looking. Nobody's looking. Thank you. Just now. Almighty God, I bow my heads before you now. I learned a long time ago, it's not about a pretty sermon. It's about presenting you. I've watched the spirit of God brood across this audience just now. &gt;&gt; The word of life has been spoken. Now, Satan, you take your hands off of God's children. &gt;&gt; You tried to bind this service a couple of times. Even as I preached, &gt;&gt; I felt your cold wind come through to try to bind. &gt;&gt; I pray that, Lord, THAT YOU'D BREAK THAT CYCLE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; MAY THOSE DARK CHAINS BE BROKEN TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; May those prison doors be be loosed tonight. And at the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; I PRAY THAT FOR THOSE that have met you, Father, before &gt;&gt; and their altar has become cool &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the Lord has diminished in THEIR LIFE. OH GOD, MAY THERE BE A WELCOME SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; LORD, I'M NOT INTERESTED ABOUT PRIDE OR who we are. WE ALL need more of you. Oh God, right now &gt;&gt; at the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Spirit sweep across this audience just now. &gt;&gt; OH, SWEEP ACROSS THIS AUDIENCE JUST NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You've raised your hands across this building. I want to invite you to this altar just now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've walked to altars before. &gt;&gt; Break the chain. Now, I'm going to speak very honestly to you tonight. Some of you know that I know &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord is is here in this building. He's called your name while I preached and you're still sitting there. You've allowed your life to get cold. Don't miss this tonight. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this tonight, brother. This is the first service. I DON'T HAVE A service to waste. He waited on the well most of the day. He's patient. He's patient. Wherever you're at in the world and you're watching this just now, maybe you're in a living room, the spirit of God's tugging on your heart. Why don't you just go on your knees right there where you're at? &gt;&gt; I don't care where you're a preacher, you've allowed things to slip in your life that's not right. Let the spirit of God soak our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about yesterday. It's &gt;&gt; not about what WE DID 10 YEARS AGO. IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR LIFE right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Somebody will see me. It don't matter about seeing me. It's about him seeing me. &gt;&gt; It's about him. &gt;&gt; It's about him. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, I've never felt the way that I felt as I stood on this platform tonight. I feel like Noah screaming his last sermon. &gt;&gt; Just feels like our prophet preaching souls now in prison. &gt;&gt; Sir, is this the time? My Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is about your children. &gt;&gt; This is about rapture. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT DESTROYING THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; This is about God's purpose. &gt;&gt; YOUR PURPOSE WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; You're on a mission tonight. &gt;&gt; You brought me here WITH PURPOSE. ALL I'VE DONE IS SURRENDER TO YOUR PURPOSE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT INTERESTED IN POPULARITY. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PRESTIGE. I'M only interested in pleasing you. &gt;&gt; If it's simple, I WANT TO PREACH SIMPLE. WHATEVER YOU WANT me to do, I want to preach it. &gt;&gt; Oh God, all I know is the SPIRIT OF GOD'S BROODING ACROSS THIS AUDIENCE. &gt;&gt; These are your children. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; As they've walked to this altar just now, &gt;&gt; may they pour their heart out to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You promised that you'd hear our voice. &gt;&gt; Nobody's got a voice like ours. &gt;&gt; Nobody's got fingerprints like ours. Nobody's got eye prints like ours. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. May we become lived voices. TAKE OUR OLD BOOK, FATHER. &gt;&gt; MAY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST BE APPLIED TO OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Oh God, JUSTIFICATIONS AS THOUGH WE NEVER DID IN the first place. May the Holy Spirit just come down and cleanse habits out of our lives, weaknesses out of our lives. come and BRING US AND BREATHE ON US THE BREATH OF THE HOLY Ghost tonight, &gt;&gt; OH GOD, THAT WE CAN LIVE AS OVERCOMERS. FATHER, &gt;&gt; oh God, tonight, &gt;&gt; I believe you can take a hold of our our shoulders tonight. &gt;&gt; I believe you can take a HOLD OF OUR HEARTS TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; And in a matter of moments, change our lives and we'll never be the same. Lord, we surrender to you this afternoon. &gt;&gt; We give you our hearts. &gt;&gt; You already know our weaknesses and we just confess to things to you that you already know. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED OF US. And Father, we give it to you. &gt;&gt; Now, God, I ask you that you'd give us the grace to rise and overcome. If we if we live 10 years till the rapture or TWO DECADES TO THE RAPTURE, HELP US TO BE overcomers and witnesses of the power and the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We serve a God that can not only wash our hands, BUT CAN CLEANSE our hearts tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, sweep across this audience &gt;&gt; from the front to the back. Oh God. Oh God, create a revival in our hearts this weekend. &gt;&gt; Oh God, create a revival in our hearts. May we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we've met you.

I'll never forsake you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we pray this evening at this altar and across this audience, &gt;&gt; we've raised our hands to you. We've defied gravity. We've left our pride at deceit &gt;&gt; and we walk forward not by just an exercise, &gt;&gt; but we identify to the devil, I am done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am done with THAT SLAVERY. &gt;&gt; I'M DONE WITH THAT SIN IN my life. &gt;&gt; Satan, I'm finished with you. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God, come sweep across this audience just now.

My son and brother Ben Dingwong, they have never been the same again. &gt;&gt; They have never gone back. &gt;&gt; You make your stand. You make your confession. You don't do it by emotion. &gt;&gt; You say, "That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I'm set free. &gt;&gt; He's the healer of the broken pieces, and I'm never going back again." Can I hear an amen, young people? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you've laid at the altar, you leave it there. Don't ever pick it up again. &gt;&gt; It's finished. It's over. It's done. &gt;&gt; SAY, "PRAISE GOD." &gt;&gt; IT'S OVER, DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I take God at his word tonight. &gt;&gt; I am free. &gt;&gt; Free. &gt;&gt; We're just free. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, DEVIL. You can't have me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had me long enough. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He was HERE BEFORE I CAME here tonight. &gt;&gt; He was there at the well before she got there. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The angel beat Eleazar. &gt;&gt; He beat Rebecca to the well." &gt;&gt; I say, "My God beat you here before you came to camp and knew what the first meeting was to be." And saints, it's only going to get better and better and better. And so, you might as well praise him tonight. You might as well rejoice and say, "How great is our God. GLORY." &gt;&gt; I love to see the devil get defeated. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; I LOVE TO TELL THE DEVIL HE'S THE LOSER AND I'M THE WINNER. &gt;&gt; I was elected before the foundation of the world. He tells you you're A LOSER, I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE THE ELECTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I can do all things through Christ Jesus that strengthened me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. &gt;&gt; So now whatever happened, whatever you laid down, never pick it up again. &gt;&gt; Say it is over. I'm tired of your complex. &gt;&gt; Oh, did he did me? He did. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; When you know God met you, you know he met you. It's not a mind game. It's a heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need somebody to start throwing doubt into your mind. You need to hear the word of God to faith upon faith upon faith. &gt;&gt; Get me preaching, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We might go all night yet. &gt;&gt; Don't get scared if we're the if we're the Remember there's another book of Acts. &gt;&gt; What happened in the first books of Acts? &gt;&gt; They preached all night. &gt;&gt; And even if you fell asleep and died, we'll raise YOU BACK UP. OH, HOW I love Jesus. &gt;&gt; Healer of my broken heart. &gt;&gt; Loved me before I even knew God was around. And God must have loved you very much to lay this kind of message on brother Ron Spencer's heart to speak to us so profoundly. I want you to say to yourself tonight, Lord, you must love me very much. Go ahead, say that to yourself. &gt;&gt; Lord, you must love me very much to affect me by the word so strongly. And now I just want to thank you, Lord. I want to give you the offering and sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you young people haven't done it often enough. All you do is this. It's very, very simple.

We love you and we thank you for the eternal work that you have done tonight in the hearts of your children. We bless you. We thank you. We love you and pray, Father, that your grace will go before us. Whether it be in our cabins, whether it be on the road, may the presence of God that is here, may it continue on into the morning and into the afternoon and tomorrow evening, Lord, build us up into the faith. Build us up into the presence of God. And may that heavenly place that we love so much become a reality to every young person that is here this evening. Bless us now as we prepare to go.

Be careful on the road campers and you'll go out with your counselors and that will be fine. And we love you all. Thank you for making this night so special, for your presence, for your prayers, and for your desire for the things of God. Michael, why don't you come and close in a word of prayer? Let's just thank him. Heavenly Father, Lord, truly we are in awe of you this evening. In such an age of identity crisis that you could tell each one tonight, sons and daughters of God, you could take the harlot out of Rahab's name. You could take out the blind part out of Bardameus's name and show them who they are. Just a moment. Blind Barnameus reached out and he son of David have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Lord, tonight I believe as some came to the altar this evening in their heart who was crying out trying to stop you in your tracks. Like brother Brandham said just that moment changed his identification forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord truly we're in awe of you. &gt;&gt; We're in awe of what just a few moments in your presence can do to change from past just a few minutes in the present can change the future forever. Oh God, &gt;&gt; truly Lord, we believe this is just a taste of what you're going to do this camp. So we pray that you would just set aside the vessel, Brother Ron Spencer, take his body, his spirit and soul, make him so keen and in tune with your spirit that you would be able to speak through his vessel, speak through his lips. We pray, oh God, be with each one now as we depart from this place. We thank you for your presence and we look forward to what you're going to do for us in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Michael. Tomorrow morning, I believe morning devotion is a half hour early. So, we can we'll be breaking a half an hour earlier before lunch because I believe they're going to be going up the mountain. So, we'll have morning devotion at 9:30. We're looking forward to seeing you all there. God bless you. God be with you until we meet again. May the Lord Jesus go before you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Thank you, young people. Heat. Heat.
