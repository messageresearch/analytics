[2:48] We're thankful that 2020 is over.
[2:51] We're looking forward to what 2021 has
[2:54] in store. Amen.
[2:56] Um 2020 was interesting, but we know
[3:00] that the Lord was with us. He saw us
[3:02] through and he's going to see us through
[3:03] all the way. Can we sing together? He
[3:07] leadeth me.
[3:09] Oh blessed thought.
[3:13] He leadth me. Oh blessed thought.
[3:19] Oh words with heavenly
[3:23] comfort for all.
[3:27] Whatever I do, wherever I be,
[3:34] still his God's hand that leadth me.
[3:42] He leadth me. He leadth me. By his own
[3:49] hand, he leadth me.
[3:55] his faithful
[3:57] follower I will be. For by his hand he
[4:04] leadth me.
[4:08] Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom.
[4:13] Sometimes
[4:15] where Eden's power gloom
[4:20] by waterers still or troubled sea
[4:27] still is his hand that leadth me.
[4:34] He leadth me. He leadth me. By his own
[4:42] hand he leadth me.
[4:47] His faithful
[4:49] follower I would meet. For by his hand
[4:55] he leadth me.

[5:07] murmur nor rep
[5:12] content whatever
[5:15] lot I see
[5:18] since his my God that leadth me.

[5:32] own hand he leadth me.
[5:38] His faithful follower I would be. For by
[5:44] his hand he leadth me.
[5:50] And when my task on earth is done, when
[5:56] by thy grace the victories won.
[6:02] Even death's cold wave I will not flee.
[6:09] Since God through Jordan leadth me,
[6:16] he leadth me. He leadth me. By his own
[6:23] hand he leadth me.
[6:28] His faithful follower I would be. For by
[6:35] his hand he leadth me.
[6:41] There a day my soul did need that anient
[6:48] flame of fire to leave.
[6:53] When every light on earth grew dim,
[7:00] the Lord returned to lead again.
[7:07] He leadth me. He He leadth me by his own
[7:14] hand. He leadth me.
[7:19] His faithful
[7:21] follower I would be. For by his hand he
[7:28] leadth me.

[7:36] I'm trusting to
[7:41] the unseen
[7:44] hand
[7:47] that guides me through
[7:52] this weery land.
[7:58] In some sweet day
[8:03] I'll reach that strength
[8:08] still guided by
[8:13] the unseen
[8:16] hand.
[8:19] There is an unseen
[8:24] hand to me
[8:29] that leads in ways
[8:34] I cannot see
[8:39] while going through
[8:45] this world of Oh,
[8:50] this hand still leads
[8:55] me as I go.
[9:00] I'm trusting to you.
[9:06] The unseen hand
[9:11] that guides me through
[9:16] this weery land.
[9:21] And some sweet day
[9:26] I'll reach that trail.
[9:32] Still guided by
[9:37] the unseen
[9:39] hand.
[9:42] His hand has led
[9:47] through shadows.
[9:52] And while it leads,
[9:58] I have no fear.
[10:03] I know will lead
[10:08] me to that home
[10:13] where sin nor soul
[10:19] or where can come.
[10:24] I'm trusting to
[10:29] the unseen hand
[10:34] that guides me through
[10:39] this weery land.
[10:44] And some sweet day
[10:49] I'll reach that strength.
[10:54] Still guided by
[10:59] the unseen. Maybe we can stand together
[11:02] as we sing this last verse.
[11:05] I long to see
[11:10] my Savior's
[11:12] pain.
[11:15] and sing the story
[11:21] saved by grace.
[11:26] And thereupon

[12:46] And I know that there are angels
[12:53] all around.
[12:57] So let us pray.

[13:06] now
[13:09] for we are standing
[13:13] in his presence on holy ground.

[14:10] Maybe we can just pray together.
[14:13] I haven't got any written re pray prayer
[14:16] requests written in this morning, but
[14:20] we're just going to bring our needs
[14:23] before the Lord.
[14:26] For he is a God that supplies all of our
[14:29] needs.
[14:31] Heavenly Father,
[14:33] truly, Lord God, we believe that we are
[14:35] standing on holy ground.
[14:40] Father, in this situation that we're in,
[14:42] Lord, it may not feel like it, but
[14:46] we stand with our prophet this morning,
[14:49] Lord God, who told us that we don't go
[14:51] by feelings.
[14:53] We don't look at circumstances. We don't
[14:56] look at symptoms, Father, but we look at
[14:58] one thing, and that is your word, Lord.
[15:01] For your word is true, oh God.
[15:04] Your word will never fail, Lord.
[15:08] Your word stands sure, Lord. When all
[15:10] else crumbles and falls, Father, your
[15:14] word remains standing.
[15:16] We're so thankful, Father God,
[15:19] that you have birthed us. You have
[15:22] birthed your little bride by that spoken
[15:24] word, oh God, and it's transforming us,
[15:28] Father,
[15:30] from glory unto glory, Lord God, into
[15:32] your image, Lord. And we pray, Father,
[15:34] that you would stamp your own image,
[15:36] Lord, deep on our hearts, oh God.
[15:40] Father, we need you more than ever,
[15:42] Lord. We need you in this new year, oh
[15:45] Lord. 2021, oh God. Who would have
[15:48] thought that we'd be here at this time,
[15:50] Lord?
[15:52] But, Father God, you knew
[15:56] and you prepared us for for this time,
[15:59] Father.
[16:00] So, we're trusting in you, oh God, and
[16:02] we place our trust in you. We cast our
[16:05] cares upon you, Lord. We bring our needs
[16:08] to you, Father. Bring our all our needs
[16:11] to the altar, Lord.
[16:14] We pray, oh God, that you would just
[16:16] have your way, Lord. every life. Father,
[16:20] would you move into every home, Lord,
[16:23] wherever people are gathered, Lord, to
[16:27] hear your word this morning to log in,
[16:29] Father, to connect with us, oh Lord
[16:32] Jesus, as our pastor would come to
[16:34] minister this morning, oh God, I pray
[16:37] that your Holy Spirit would descend
[16:40] upon your children, Lord, and oh God,
[16:44] and that the word would be anointed to
[16:46] the very heart of every individual.
[16:50] Father, touching lives
[16:53] deeply, Lord, and rooting us and
[16:56] grounding us, Father,
[16:59] in the midst of all this upheaval, Lord,
[17:02] is rooting and grounding us, Lord, like
[17:05] a tree that's planted by the living
[17:07] waters. Oh God,
[17:10] we love you, Lord. We just give all
[17:14] things to you, Father. every exercise of
[17:17] this service. Lord, anoint our pastor,
[17:20] oh God. Strengthen him, oh Lord, and

[17:34] the gift of God that you have placed in
[17:36] our midst, Lord. We want to draw from
[17:39] you, Father, all that we have need of,

[30:44] Uh, we heard from Switzerland.
[30:47] We heard from down in the southern
[30:50] United States. We heard from
[30:54] in fact is I got a email from from uh
[31:01] some people I don't want to mention by
[31:04] name but they were in Port El Bernie and
[31:07] they said could you tell us where
[31:10] brother Brandham preached in 1962
[31:14] and we were not able to identify the
[31:17] building but I can tell you it was there
[31:21] and we were there and I was on the
[31:24] platform. In fact, is I drove up every
[31:28] night from Victoria
[31:31] for the meeting and back home to work
[31:34] the next day and then again the next day
[31:38] and uh it was just supernatural. So
[31:43] people are still putting a great effort
[31:46] forward and we did at that time and we
[31:49] never thought it was an effort. We just
[31:52] this is what we do. And I want to say
[31:55] one thing about all of this struggle
[31:58] that you're going through at this time.
[32:01] And I see you sitting there and you're
[32:03] streaming the meeting. But uh God bless
[32:07] you. And with that blessing comes a
[32:11] special thanks because we will we will
[32:17] continue and we will prevail.
[32:21] That's the word I was struggling for. We
[32:24] will prevail. And when this is all over,
[32:28] &gt;&gt; we will say, "Well, what what did you
[32:31] do?" Well, we had church all the way
[32:34] through. We never stopped for a moment.
[32:37] We had a service and we rejoiced and we
[32:41] thank God for his victory and his
[32:45] deliverance. Amen. All the way through.
[32:48] And that's the way I have been
[32:50] approaching this. We'll be victorious.
[32:54] And when this is all done and finished
[32:57] and through, we will be able to say,
[33:00] "Praise be to our God."
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Praise be to our conquering king Jesus
[33:07] Christ. And he did not only conquer back
[33:11] then when he rose from the dead, but
[33:14] that resurrection has taken place in our
[33:17] hearts. And that's why you're there
[33:19] raising your hand and rejoicing. And we
[33:23] are rejoicing with you. We just rejoice
[33:27] to see you. God bless you. Uh, brother
[33:30] Karen, brother, sister Karen, and
[33:33] brother Doug. God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[33:38] Well, I would would like to just uh
[33:43] send our greetings to all the people
[33:46] throughout the land. And uh like I said,
[33:50] we had we had uh people from
[33:56] Switzerland
[33:58] and connected with us and they're
[34:00] connected now.
[34:03] they will be listening to this service
[34:06] and uh I want to take a
[34:09] uh a portion of scripture.
[34:12] If you will
[34:15] if if you can't follow,
[34:19] you'll jot it down if you wouldn't mind.
[34:22] I would like to have you do that because
[34:25] there are some things which I read
[34:28] yesterday even and I said I've never
[34:32] heard that before but we want to take
[34:36] time to allow the Holy Spirit to make
[34:41] known to us these things. I'm going to
[34:45] read a scripture out of Isaiah. And now
[34:49] remember that this is a prophecy. For
[34:52] unto us
[34:55] a child is born.
[34:59] Isaiah 9 and6.
[35:02] Unto us a child is born.
[35:06] Unto us a son is given. Now that second
[35:11] phrase
[35:13] that uh identifies more closely not only
[35:18] is is a child born there's a lot of
[35:20] children born but unto us a son is given
[35:26] and if you had not been given that son
[35:31] then I can tell you you have something
[35:34] to expect and to believe in unto us a
[35:39] son is given and the government. Now
[35:42] this isolates it even more. And the
[35:46] government shall be upon his shoulders.
[35:49] Not every son, not every one that's born
[35:54] has the government put upon his
[35:56] shoulders. And I I just I say, "Thank
[36:00] God,
[36:02] we're going to have a righteous
[36:05] government,
[36:09] &gt;&gt; and the government shall be upon his
[36:11] shoulders." The prophet of God speaks
[36:13] about that in the
[36:16] in the
[36:19] uh revelation of the church ages. and
[36:24] his name shall be called
[36:27] Wonderful Counselor,
[36:30] the Mighty God,
[36:33] the Everlasting Father,
[36:37] the Prince of Peace. A lot of sons are
[36:40] born, but they do not have that name. I
[36:44] want you to say with me,
[36:48] praise be to God
[36:50] &gt;&gt; for this son
[36:52] &gt;&gt; for this child, for this son that
[36:56] brought forth and I want to speak about
[36:59] him.
[37:01] this we are celebrating him
[37:06] and I'd like to speak today on God
[37:10] condescending
[37:13] and unfolding himself.
[37:16] He speaks of this in the inside man.
[37:20] God condescending
[37:23] coming down unfolding himself.
[37:28] Then God appeared there in the pillar of
[37:32] fire.
[37:33] Then the next time he appeared in a
[37:37] visible form was when he appeared in his
[37:41] son Christ Jesus. He overshadowed a
[37:46] virgin, created a blood cell in her womb
[37:51] that brought forth the son of God. And
[37:55] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[37:59] to himself. And that's why
[38:03] you and I are able to attend this
[38:08] meeting and be together
[38:11] and be gathered together.
[38:16] It's very special the inside man. And
[38:21] then in uh 1945 54,
[38:26] brother Brandon preached the seven
[38:27] church ages.
[38:29] And I would like to speak I would like
[38:32] to uh re refer back to that. Wish we had
[38:37] time to get into the deity of Christ.
[38:42] The deity
[38:44] of Christ.
[38:47] days when so many people are trying to
[38:51] make him just another teacher,
[38:55] &gt;&gt; just a philosopher
[38:58] or merely a prophet.
[39:01] He was God.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; He was either God or the biggest
[39:07] deceiver the world ever had. If he was a
[39:12] prophet, his blood was a man. If he was
[39:16] a teacher, an educator, his blood was a
[39:21] man. He was God and his blood was
[39:27] divine.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So I want you to see that there's a
[39:32] separation.
[39:34] If he was God, this is deity. Yeah,
[39:39] &gt;&gt; it the Virgin Mary,
[39:42] she conceived by the power of the Holy
[39:46] Ghost overshadowed her. And it says and
[39:50] uh he said in this statement,
[39:55] he was divine. Almighty God overshadowed
[40:00] the Virgin Mary and created the blood
[40:03] cell in her womb that brought forth the
[40:08] son Christ Jesus.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; And God condescended
[40:14] and lived in that body. God Emmanuel
[40:18] made flesh among us takes away the sins
[40:23] of the world. And now I want
[40:28] you to ask yourself,
[40:31] brother and sister Biscll,
[40:34] we
[40:37] I thought we would like to see what the
[40:40] nations of the world,
[40:42] how they remember Christmas.
[40:45] Now you can look back and see how you
[40:48] remembered it. And I'm happy to see you
[40:54] looking this way and rejoicing in the
[40:58] Christmas, the true Christmas.
[41:02] And we we looked around the world and
[41:06] they went they had all kinds of
[41:09] ceremonies,
[41:10] all kinds of people and celebrities
[41:15] and all different things going on. Not
[41:18] one word about the Christ child. Not one
[41:21] word about he taking our sins. Not one
[41:24] word about the divine blood of God in
[41:30] that vessel. Not one word. But how we
[41:36] have been made known, we've known uh we
[41:40] have been made to understand
[41:43] that Christ has come. Yeah.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; The Savior has come
[41:48] &gt;&gt; and he took my sins. He took your sins.
[41:52] He took our sins
[41:54] &gt;&gt; all of us.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; And washed us in his blood and made us
[42:00] white as snow. How I thank him. Oh my my
[42:05] what a celebration it is. God bless you
[42:09] each one for the word you have you're
[42:12] holding in your hand. And I'm going to
[42:15] say, "All right, musicians, we're done."
[42:20] And God bless you. And I've got I've got
[42:23] some more reading that I want to take,
[42:25] but you can have your seats. God bless
[42:28] you.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Now, as I read,
[42:40] you'll want to put some notes down.
[42:45] because I'm not going to read this again
[42:49] and I I don't want to make copies of
[42:51] these notes.
[42:54] I want to
[42:56] have you absorb it while we read it. And
[43:01] the message that I have been in is
[43:05] the original seed.
[43:08] The spoken word is the original
[43:13] seed.
[43:15] And the original is that it was existing
[43:20] all the time.
[43:23] The original seed.
[43:26] And we are born
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; of the original seed.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; You are born of the original seed.
[43:35] That's why you're connected. You want to
[43:38] hear what he has said about it's not
[43:42] just a son that's been born. Not just a
[43:46] son, not just a teacher, not a
[43:49] philosopher,
[43:50] not a rabbi, not even a preacher. It's
[43:54] not that. It's not that. It's more than
[43:57] that.
[43:59] It's God himself,
[44:01] &gt;&gt; right? made himself known
[44:04] &gt;&gt; and has come down and condescended
[44:08] into your realm, into your life, into
[44:12] your home until you can say, "He's my
[44:17] God.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; That's my redeemer. That's my savior."
[44:23] Hallelujah.
[44:25] Amen. God bless you.
[44:30] All right. Now this in this message the
[44:33] spoken word is the original seed.
[44:38] Brother Brandham asks the people to turn
[44:41] to Matthew 25
[44:44] 24 and 35.
[44:48] He says as we search through the
[44:51] scriptures
[44:52] for a little while and I'll see how much
[44:55] time we have.
[44:57] And I want to read here a word that
[45:01] Jesus said. Matthew 24 and the 35th
[45:05] verse and 24th chapter 35th verse
[45:12] show how eternal
[45:15] is the word.
[45:17] what we have been talking about.
[45:22] Uh and he says, "Verily I say unto you,
[45:27] this generation shall not pass till all
[45:31] things will be fulfilled. Heavens and
[45:35] earth shall pass away, but my words
[45:39] shall not pass away." So, I want to draw
[45:43] your attention to this mystery that's
[45:47] been made known to you. That's God
[45:51] condescended until he came down into the
[45:55] flesh to a place that you could
[45:59] recognize him
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and thank him.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; He comes three times.
[46:09] First, the physical first coming of
[46:13] Jesus Christ was as a kinsman redeemer
[46:20] and the second coming to claim what he
[46:24] had redeemed.
[46:28] In each case, God in his immeasurable
[46:33] grace did
[46:37] attribute the coming of Christ to a
[46:41] people
[46:42] that could not within themselves
[46:46] bring him forth within themselves.
[46:50] Within yourself, you could not bring him
[46:52] forth. Your redeemer had to be made
[46:56] known to you. And thirdly,
[47:00] God confirms his acceptance
[47:04] of his children by revealing himself to
[47:09] them.
[47:11] I want to say that again. God confirms
[47:16] his acceptance of his children by
[47:21] revealing himself to them in the future
[47:25] message of the future home. Jesus comes
[47:30] three times. The he says he comes once
[47:34] to redeem his bride, next time to get
[47:38] his bride, and the next time with his
[47:42] bride. Oh, I I'm so looking forward to
[47:47] that time. I want to come with his
[47:50] bride. Amen.
[47:55] God attributes the life of his son to
[48:00] those that believe on him in John's
[48:04] gospel the first chapter 12th verse. But
[48:08] as many as received him to them gave he
[48:12] power to become the sons of God
[48:18] even to them that believe on his name.
[48:22] And then John 3 and:16,
[48:26] he that hath he that believeth on the
[48:29] Son hath everlasting life,
[48:33] and uh he that believeth not the Son
[48:38] shall not see life, but the wrath of God
[48:43] abideth on him. Now I want to speak
[48:46] about the image,
[48:48] the image of God. this God
[48:52] from the root word,
[48:55] something that has been cut off, a piece
[49:01] from the original. And I want to say to
[49:04] you,
[49:05] you that believe
[49:08] and the reason you're there and the
[49:10] reason you're connected is because
[49:14] God, this God that I speak about
[49:19] is the original. And he spoke, "Let
[49:23] there be." And there was
[49:27] this God. He said, "Let there be.
[49:31] Let the light appear.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Let the earth appear. Let life appear.
[49:37] That was the original word. And Jesus
[49:40] said that the father's word are eternal.
[49:45] They are eternal. And
[49:49] he said we're words, our words, man's
[49:53] words, they're just in passing. But
[49:57] God's words are eternal words. And if
[50:01] we've been born by the word of God,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; that's the original seed. And that's the
[50:09] one that spoke and it was said, "Let the
[50:13] earth bring forth." And it brought
[50:15] forth. It brought forth what? Of its
[50:19] kind. Of its own kind. It's original is
[50:24] of its own kind.
[50:27] Amen.
[50:35] So the first image
[50:40] he made man and set him over the works
[50:45] of his hands.
[50:47] The image fell, but God would not leave
[50:51] his image, his family image,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; to lay on the ground in the dust of the
[50:59] earth. He did not leave it that way.
[51:04] I'm so glad he picked us up. I'm so glad
[51:07] he picked us up out of the mire and out
[51:11] of the darkness and out of the confusion
[51:14] of this age or we'd have been out there
[51:17] with a with all the multitude of people
[51:21] in their confusion. But God did not
[51:24] allow that. He picked us up. He said,
[51:28] "You are elected for something higher.
[51:31] You're elected to a light. You're
[51:34] elected to see something.
[51:37] You're elected to understand it.
[51:41] And there's nothing that will
[51:45] take the believer. Nothing. Amen.
[51:50] The image fell, but God would not leave
[51:54] his image to lay. And this is in the
[51:57] masterpiece message.
[52:00] than this masterpiece
[52:03] when Satan broke through the walls and
[52:07] marred this masterpiece.
[52:10] But the great sculptor
[52:13] when he seen the fall of his family, the
[52:18] masterpiece,
[52:20] he wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[52:23] there.
[52:25] Oh, hallelujah. He wasn't willing to
[52:29] leave it lay there face down and ru in
[52:33] ruin. He went to work immediately to
[52:38] build it up
[52:41] again.
[52:43] He wasn't willing that it should perish.
[52:48] Lay there like that all the time
[52:52] because he he's God and he will not be
[52:58] defeated.
[53:00] Oh my confidence is in that friends.
[53:05] He's God
[53:06] &gt;&gt; and he will not be defeated.
[53:09] Maybe we feel defeated sometime, but
[53:13] he's not defeated.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; He's not done. He says, "I'm not done. I
[53:20] I will work with your family. I will
[53:23] work in your life. I'm not done. I'm not
[53:27] finished."
[53:29] Amen. And he'll keep revealing himself
[53:32] to you and making himself known. I urge
[53:36] you to come and in in
[53:39] with all the courage you can possibly
[53:43] muster. Have courage. Have confidence.
[53:47] If you haven't got confidence in
[53:49] yourself, have confidence in him. If you
[53:52] haven't got confidence in your family,
[53:54] have confidence in him. And look up and
[53:57] just say, "You will do you'll do the
[54:01] impossible.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You will do what I cannot do, what I
[54:05] cannot achieve. You will do it. You've
[54:09] promised to do it. You will not leave
[54:12] this masterpiece family.
[54:15] And let me tell you, friends, God has
[54:20] called you.
[54:22] God has called your families.
[54:24] God has called you
[54:27] to be a light. Even in this dark hour,
[54:30] even in this hour of confusion, God has
[54:34] called you to be a light.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has called your families to be a
[54:41] light. Has called your children to be a
[54:44] light. And has called you to a true
[54:48] light. And you'll be a a a real example.
[54:54] If God would not leave his image to lay
[54:56] face down in defeat back in Eden, the
[55:01] dust of Satan's Eden. And now we have
[55:05] Satan's Eden and the dust of Satan's
[55:08] Eden. But God who is not willing to
[55:12] leave his family there in the beginning.
[55:16] He's not willing to do that even now.
[55:22] the image of his son. All through the
[55:25] Old Testament, God began building the
[55:29] image of his son. All through the Old
[55:32] Testament, Christ coming down. If you
[55:35] had said to Abraham, "Unto us
[55:39] a son is given." He'd say, "Where is
[55:42] it?" I don't say it. There's no evidence
[55:46] of it. But unto us the son is given.
[55:50] unto us
[55:53] a child is born.
[55:56] Hallelujah. And there's such a joy and a
[55:59] reach uh
[56:02] such a an accomplishment.
[56:05] And you that have families,
[56:10] you that have families,
[56:13] and you have children around you,
[56:17] and you that may perhaps will have
[56:20] families.
[56:22] You just don't know
[56:25] what God has gifted and God has given.
[56:30] But God has given so much.
[56:34] You that are deacons,
[56:37] you that are trustees,
[56:40] you that are ministers,
[56:43] let me say to each one of you, you are a
[56:47] gift to the body of Christ.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; You are a gift to the body of Christ.
[56:54] And what that gift will do, you will not
[56:57] know. If you had told me that you'll be
[57:02] in those meetings in Port Al Bernie
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and you will drive
[57:07] many miles
[57:09] all through the night and arrive to that
[57:14] to that place where the meetings are. If
[57:18] you had told me then that we will hear,
[57:23] brother Bham, speak to the people and
[57:27] tell the people there's a boy down
[57:30] there. There's a young man down there in
[57:34] his early 20s or about 19 or 20 years
[57:38] old and he's was having epileptic fits
[57:42] about four a day and they said he cannot
[57:46] live. He'll be lucky to live it through
[57:50] his 21st year. My wife and I went and
[57:54] saw him recently
[57:56] and I said to his name was Stephen.
[58:00] Steven Tate. And he and his his mother
[58:04] came from h a family near
[58:10] uh
[58:12] it was a a Steven Tate was
[58:16] a knitnot. They're from the knitnot
[58:21] village.
[58:23] A knitnot. and he came up to Yullet and
[58:27] he came into
[58:29] Port Bernie and then my wife and I went
[58:32] and saw him. He was 72 years old and I
[58:38] said, "Do you remember when brother
[58:40] Brandham was in Port No Bernie?" He
[58:42] said, "Yes, I do." I said, "Do you
[58:45] remember when he spoke to you?" It was
[58:48] at the end of the service. Do you
[58:51] remember that? Yes, he remembers that. I
[58:55] said, "How how have you been?" He said,
[58:58] "I've never had a fit since I've never
[59:02] had this epileptic thing since." Listen
[59:05] to me, friends. He's greater than
[59:08] anything that can attack your family.
[59:11] And you that have had sickness come into
[59:13] your home. He's greater than that
[59:16] sickness. He's greater than all of that
[59:19] fam and any affliction that comes from
[59:23] the enemy. Just resist it in the name of
[59:26] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. We have a
[59:30] right to rejoice and sing because our
[59:35] Lord Jesus, he conquered all. He
[59:38] conquered everything. And there's not a
[59:40] virus. There's not a plague. There's
[59:44] nothing that can take the believer.
[59:48] Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] Well,
[59:53] forgive me for getting excited, but
[59:59] God began building the image of his son
[1:00:03] all through the Old Testament. Christ
[1:00:06] coming down through the corporate body
[1:00:09] of Old Testament saints. If you had told
[1:00:13] them they were going to be a part of the
[1:00:17] salvation
[1:00:19] uh to the people, they would never have
[1:00:23] believed you. But to bring forward by
[1:00:27] the word of God spoken through the
[1:00:30] prophets,
[1:00:33] Israel at Kadesh Barnea,
[1:00:36] Christ was in Abraham. Christ was in
[1:00:40] Isaac.
[1:00:42] C Christ was in Jacob. Christ was in
[1:00:47] Joseph.
[1:00:49] Christ was in Moses. He was all down
[1:00:53] through the Old Testament. If he's able
[1:00:55] to do that, then Christ, I can say on
[1:00:59] the authority of this word of God,
[1:01:02] Christ is in his body. Christ is in his
[1:01:06] bride. Christ is in his people. And
[1:01:10] that's why a prophet of God came and
[1:01:13] declared it to you.
[1:01:16] And that is why Jesus Christ made
[1:01:19] himself so known so that he could be uh
[1:01:23] recognized
[1:01:25] as the one that was. And in the message,
[1:01:29] the blessing prophet, he said all down
[1:01:32] through the Old Testament, God appeared
[1:01:35] to man. God appeared in Abraham
[1:01:40] as a faith believer. God appeared in
[1:01:44] David as a king. He appeared in Joseph
[1:01:50] as righteousness. He appeared in Moses
[1:01:55] as a prophet, priest,
[1:01:58] lawgiver. He appeared down through the
[1:02:01] ages in the prophets. He always made
[1:02:06] himself known in man.
[1:02:10] I say this to you. He always made
[1:02:14] himself known in man. That's all that
[1:02:17] he's done. God bless you, brother
[1:02:20] Timothy and your wife. God bless you and
[1:02:23] your children. God bless brother John
[1:02:27] Andes and his wife. Amen. God bless
[1:02:31] them. I can tell you
[1:02:35] and I said it with confidence.
[1:02:38] I say it with great confidence.
[1:02:43] And they can have all of the failures
[1:02:47] that they wish to have in the world. But
[1:02:50] God is not a failure. Even the cross is
[1:02:54] not a failure. It's a great victory. And
[1:02:57] the prophet of God of this generation
[1:03:00] said that was the greatest week in
[1:03:02] history
[1:03:04] when that Christ Jesus Christ I've
[1:03:08] thought of it even uh even when he saw
[1:03:11] the wicked coming and he he said to them
[1:03:15] go fill up the fill up the vessel fill
[1:03:19] up the cup with the suffering and get
[1:03:23] this thing over with. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] Until the perfect image of the invisible
[1:03:34] God stood on the earth in the fullness
[1:03:38] of the Godhead bodily,
[1:03:41] a bridegroom waiting for a bride.
[1:03:47] A piece was struck off from him.
[1:03:52] the building of another masterpiece
[1:03:56] began
[1:03:58] because
[1:04:00] that's just the way it is. Amen.
[1:04:05] Happy to see you rejoicing over that.
[1:04:11] So perfect, a redeemer of man. so
[1:04:15] perfect, so godly, yet there was no
[1:04:20] beauty that we should desire him.
[1:04:23] When this virginborn
[1:04:26] son of God of the living God become so
[1:04:31] perfect
[1:04:32] and humble
[1:04:34] and in the image of God until the great
[1:04:39] master who had brought him had brought
[1:04:44] his life up through the prophets and he
[1:04:48] was the fulfilling of all the prophets.
[1:04:53] He was the perfect
[1:04:57] until God
[1:04:59] seeing this, he smoked his smokeote him
[1:05:04] and cried out speak
[1:05:08] as Michelangelo did speak.
[1:05:12] I've been 4,000 years
[1:05:16] bringing him to this. And now he is so
[1:05:22] perfect.
[1:05:24] I've got to
[1:05:26] smite him
[1:05:29] so he can speak.
[1:05:32] Hear ye him.
[1:05:36] Think of it, friends.
[1:05:40] This
[1:05:42] perfect
[1:05:44] bride has been smitten
[1:05:48] and God wants it to speak.
[1:05:51] Hear ye him.
[1:05:55] Hallelujah. It's him speaking in us.
[1:05:59] He's the perfected one.
[1:06:02] He's the masterpiece.
[1:06:09] The bride body
[1:06:11] of Jesus Christ
[1:06:14] is another masterpiece
[1:06:17] of his own making.
[1:06:22] And this, the Bible says in Ephesians 5
[1:06:25] and 27,
[1:06:27] that he might present to himself a
[1:06:31] glorious church, not having spot or
[1:06:35] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[1:06:40] should be holy and without blemish.
[1:06:45] Thanks be to God. And you that were
[1:06:48] sometime, this is in Colossians 1 and
[1:06:51] 21, you that were sometimes alienated
[1:06:56] and enemies in your mind.
[1:06:59] We were we were certainly that. And we
[1:07:03] were enemies in our mind.
[1:07:06] Uh
[1:07:08] alienated
[1:07:10] and enemies in your mind by the wicked
[1:07:13] works. Yet now
[1:07:16] hath he reconciled in the body of his
[1:07:21] flesh through death. Oh, I thank God
[1:07:25] that he suffered and died in mystead.
[1:07:30] That I could have life, eternal life,
[1:07:34] and through death to present you holy
[1:07:40] and unblameable
[1:07:43] and un unreprovable
[1:07:47] in his sight. Listen, do you hear those
[1:07:51] words?
[1:07:53] that he could present you, present you
[1:07:58] holy,
[1:08:03] present you unblameable,
[1:08:07] present you unreprovable
[1:08:11] in whose sight? In his sight? That is
[1:08:15] God's almighty sight.
[1:08:18] the bride masterpiece bringing forth the
[1:08:22] son of God. I tell you friends, we have
[1:08:26] a privilege.
[1:08:29] And I often think of uh the privilege we
[1:08:34] have
[1:08:35] to uphold this message,
[1:08:38] to uphold this beautiful word, to uphold
[1:08:42] this beautiful Christ, to uphold him
[1:08:46] before the world
[1:08:49] and say, "If you knew him, you would
[1:08:52] love him, too. If you only knew him, you
[1:08:57] would love him as well.
[1:09:00] My oh my,
[1:09:14] you have to forgive me. We We enlarged
[1:09:18] this so I could read it more clearly.
[1:09:23] And it
[1:09:24] it may not seem that way, but that's
[1:09:27] what we have done.
[1:09:44] This Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ,
[1:09:49] you have not been redeemed by the blood
[1:09:51] of a man.
[1:09:53] You have not been You've not been
[1:09:56] redeemed
[1:09:57] by the blood of a good man, a good
[1:10:02] preacher.
[1:10:03] You've not been redeemed by that. You've
[1:10:06] been redeemed by his blood.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:12] Amen.
[1:10:30] I had some statements that I want to
[1:10:34] leave you with.
[1:10:37] Speaking of Jesus Christ, he was not
[1:10:41] genetically
[1:10:43] related to either Mary or Joseph, for
[1:10:49] both had an inherited
[1:10:53] sin nature.
[1:10:56] But you and I have been genetically
[1:11:01] birthed
[1:11:04] to Jesus Christ.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. who himself was a virginborn
[1:11:11] son of God.
[1:11:13] Amen. Virginborn
[1:11:16] son of God. And how I thank him. We're
[1:11:20] not genetically
[1:11:22] connected to
[1:11:24] viruses of man and sins of man. We've
[1:11:29] been set free from it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] Amen. Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I keep saying amen because it is
[1:11:39] true.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; It is true. We are not genetically
[1:11:43] connected
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; to this world.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[1:11:55] Jesus was not the blood of a Jew nor a
[1:11:59] Gentile. A prophet said in harvest time.
[1:12:03] He was a creative blood of Jehovah
[1:12:06] himself.
[1:12:08] He was the blood of God. The Bible said
[1:12:12] we're saved by the blood of God, not the
[1:12:16] blood of a Jew or blood of a Gentile.
[1:12:23] It all be
[1:12:25] it all be sex. But this was the blood of
[1:12:31] God. I want to say, oh, blessed be the
[1:12:35] name of almighty God.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; We've been saved by the blood of God.
[1:12:43] By the physical, the physical body of
[1:12:46] Jesus was clearly a special creation of
[1:12:51] God placed in Mary's womb.
[1:12:56] This is the doctrine of the virgin
[1:12:59] birth. He said he wanted to take more
[1:13:02] time on it and this is he has taken more
[1:13:06] time. I thank God he has taken more time
[1:13:11] and that was an important birth.
[1:13:15] Ye must be born again. And we can say
[1:13:19] praise God. I've been born again.
[1:13:23] I've been born of the Holy Spirit of
[1:13:26] God.
[1:13:30] Thus he said, "Neither Christ's spirit
[1:13:34] nor his body resulted
[1:13:37] from the DNA
[1:13:39] of Mary's egg
[1:13:42] or from
[1:13:45] any man's sperm.
[1:13:47] Both would have contained inherited
[1:13:52] genetic defects
[1:13:56] and the sin nature.
[1:14:00] And we we struggle with that, don't we?
[1:14:03] We struggle with that.
[1:14:06] But I don't want you to struggle over
[1:14:08] it. I want you to recognize
[1:14:12] he bore it all. He took all my sin. Did
[1:14:17] he just take a part of it or did he take
[1:14:19] all of my sin? He took all of my sin and
[1:14:23] he's offered what? Maybe we haven't the
[1:14:26] faith to uh to activate it as we ought
[1:14:32] to.
[1:14:34] But his righteousness
[1:14:36] has been
[1:14:38] replaced and given to us. We didn't have
[1:14:42] righteousness of our own. His
[1:14:44] righteousness
[1:14:50] As scripture tells us, Jesus was truly
[1:14:54] the second Adam. The first Adam was a
[1:14:59] special creation of God, not related to
[1:15:03] any human being. And so was the second
[1:15:07] Adam. Romans 5 and 12 to 19. Jesus was
[1:15:13] just as fully human
[1:15:17] as the first Adam.
[1:15:20] And just like the first Adam, he had no
[1:15:25] sin nature, no inherited sin, no sinful
[1:15:31] flesh,
[1:15:32] which was always been passed from one
[1:15:36] generation to the next. Since Adam and
[1:15:40] Eve sin,
[1:15:43] he was absolutely pure without sin from
[1:15:48] the day he was born till the day he
[1:15:52] died.
[1:15:55] And the Bible tells us,
[1:15:58] the Bible tells us
[1:16:01] that he no corruption and no bone would
[1:16:05] be broken in him.
[1:16:08] He had he had to be he was the lamb of
[1:16:13] God without blemish or spot
[1:16:17] the sacrifice for sin. John 1 and 29.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:41] I'd like to just thank him.
[1:16:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:16:46] I want to thank you at this moment, at
[1:16:48] this time of this in this reading of
[1:16:52] this scriptures
[1:16:54] and reading these things. How I thank
[1:16:57] you father that you have given us
[1:17:03] not just given us of your nature but you
[1:17:06] have given us a portion of yourself. We
[1:17:11] have come from the uh main article.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you have spoken your word.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you've uttered your word.
[1:17:22] And we have come about as a result of
[1:17:26] the spoken word of God. Why did we
[1:17:30] believe it? We don't even know. But we
[1:17:33] believed it because we were ordained to
[1:17:36] believe it. Hallelujah. We thank you,
[1:17:39] Lord. We thank you for the
[1:17:41] righteousness.
[1:17:44] We thank you, Father, that you have
[1:17:47] caused us to
[1:17:51] look to you.
[1:17:53] Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it.
[1:17:57] Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And Father, how we thank you for your
[1:18:06] word just now.
[1:18:18] You have said in the scripture, for I
[1:18:21] say unto you,
[1:18:23] that this
[1:18:25] that is written
[1:18:28] must yet be accomplished
[1:18:31] in me. and he was reckoned
[1:18:36] among the transgressors.
[1:18:39] For the things
[1:18:41] concerning
[1:18:42] me have an end
[1:18:45] which I wish to say to you today.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] that these things
[1:18:52] which seem so designed by the enemy and
[1:18:58] thrust upon
[1:19:00] our lives.
[1:19:03] They are without
[1:19:06] they are not written in the word of God.
[1:19:11] They are without purpose.
[1:19:15] and thank you
[1:19:18] for your faith
[1:19:21] and believing.
[1:19:23] Hallelujah, heavenly father.
[1:19:39] I wish to take
[1:19:41] just another few moments and I'm looking
[1:19:46] for a certain place.
[1:19:52] Now I want to ask you a question.
[1:19:56] What made you believe? What caused you
[1:19:59] to believe?
[1:20:01] What caused you to be the way you are?
[1:20:07] What caused you to believe?
[1:20:10] What was there in this message?
[1:20:14] And I wanted to give you a a testimony.
[1:20:20] I trust it'll be meaningful to you.
[1:20:25] I sat down
[1:20:29] and I never, as I said in one of the
[1:20:32] episodes
[1:20:34] of my testimony, I I never had the
[1:20:39] prophet of God. Can you imagine
[1:20:42] someone with that kind of word?
[1:20:47] He never ever tried to cause me to
[1:20:52] believe it.
[1:20:54] He never tried to cram it down my
[1:20:57] throat.
[1:21:00] And that's a great secret is just live
[1:21:04] the life before the people. Just live it
[1:21:08] before the people and have confidence
[1:21:11] yourself that that God that spoke to you
[1:21:16] and unfolded it to you, that same God
[1:21:21] will make it known to them or make it
[1:21:25] known to him or her or your relatives or
[1:21:29] your children or whoever they are. You
[1:21:33] live it in front of them
[1:21:35] and then God will make it known to them.
[1:21:41] Amen.
[1:21:46] Now in closing, I just want to mention
[1:21:49] this to you.
[1:21:52] There way back in the Old Testament,
[1:21:56] there was something that God had the
[1:21:59] people do. And he said, "What you'll do
[1:22:02] is you'll take the the first grain
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; that come to its ripeness.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; You'll take it and wave it as an
[1:22:14] offering to God. and wave it to God as
[1:22:20] an offering
[1:22:22] saying
[1:22:25] that you know and the prophet of this
[1:22:29] day gave an explanation to that. He said
[1:22:32] there's more like this.
[1:22:36] There's more that are ripe
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; right
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; in the field.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; There are more that are ripe.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "They have they have
[1:22:47] passed. They have lived their life out
[1:22:50] and they have fallen into the into their
[1:22:54] graves for a time, for a season, but
[1:22:59] they're not there. They'll be and this
[1:23:03] is being waved
[1:23:06] before God Almighty.
[1:23:09] And there's a just one that has waved
[1:23:11] it. And Jesus rose
[1:23:15] and he was waved.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; As an emblem,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; there's more like me.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; In the earth.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And the soil
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; because you've said, "Let the earth
[1:23:32] bring forth."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm going down to the seeler, but I
[1:23:39] will not remain there.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And anyone that believes on me
[1:23:44] will not remain there. They will come
[1:23:48] out and be way before the Almighty.
[1:23:53] And friends, there's nothing in this
[1:23:56] natural birth, but they that have been
[1:24:00] born again by the spirit of God,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; they shall come out. They shall come
[1:24:06] forth and be waved before the Almighty.
[1:24:10] Heavenly Father, how we thank you for
[1:24:13] this promise that we have.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We have been we have been resurrected.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And that's what we have experienced
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; in this day with this message that you
[1:24:27] have given. Lord, we've been
[1:24:30] resurrected.
[1:24:32] We've been brought up off of our beds of
[1:24:34] affliction,
[1:24:36] out of our denominations of affliction
[1:24:39] because it has left us indeed
[1:24:45] afflicted when we did not know
[1:24:50] how we should live. We did not know how
[1:24:55] to believe. But you have caused us to
[1:24:58] believe. You've caused us to believe
[1:25:01] your word,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; oh God. You've allowed us to believe it
[1:25:08] and you have caused us faith in our
[1:25:11] hearts to believe it and trust
[1:25:15] your word
[1:25:17] for our complete
[1:25:20] deliverance and our complete
[1:25:23] resurrection
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you father. Thank you
[1:25:29] father. Thank you allless
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; for sharing this day and sharing this
[1:25:37] time with you. God bless you is my
[1:25:39] prayer. God bless you in your work for
[1:25:42] the kingdom of God. I'm going to turn
[1:25:45] this service over to brother Nathan,
[1:25:50] brother Tom.
[1:25:59] Okay.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy the word this morning.
[1:26:24] I enjoyed it immensely.
[1:26:28] Musicians, why don't you come and then
[1:26:30] we'll we'll sing a song. Do you know
[1:26:35] who you are? Do you know who you are?
[1:26:38] Amen. Brother Abby Bisco was saying
[1:26:40] about the uh born again of the
[1:26:42] incorruptible seed of God. And if you go
[1:26:45] into the the the message, of course, as
[1:26:47] you have over the years, we understand
[1:26:50] if we're born of that original seed,
[1:26:53] every seed will bring forth of its kind.
[1:26:57] And so that wave, that wave chief
[1:26:59] offering is is an indication we're going
[1:27:02] up, Brother Doug. We're going up in that
[1:27:04] resurrection. It's it's been waved over
[1:27:06] us, and we're just waiting for that
[1:27:08] sweep to move us, and we can say, I'm
[1:27:12] one of them. I'm one of them. One of
[1:27:15] them.
[1:27:18] One of them.
[1:27:21] One of them.
[1:27:24] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:27:28] them.
[1:27:30] I'm one of them.
[1:27:34] One of them. Praise God. I can say
[1:27:39] I'm one of them. There are people There
[1:27:43] are people almost everywhere whose
[1:27:47] hearts are awed with the fire that fell
[1:27:51] at Pentecost baptized in Jesus name
[1:27:56] burning now within my heart. All glory
[1:27:59] to his name. And I'm so glad that I can
[1:28:03] say I'm one of them.
[1:28:06] I'm one of them. Halleluah. One of them.
[1:28:12] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:28:16] them.
[1:28:18] I'm one of them.
[1:28:21] One of them. Praise God. I'm so glad
[1:28:25] that I can say, "Oh, come my brother.
[1:28:30] Come my brother. Seek this blessing that
[1:28:33] will cleanse your heart from sin. that
[1:28:36] will start the joy bells ringing and
[1:28:39] will keep your soul a flame. It is
[1:28:42] burning now within my heart. All glory
[1:28:45] to his name. I'm so glad that I can say
[1:28:49] I'm one of them.
[1:28:53] One of them.
[1:28:55] One of them.
[1:28:58] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:29:02] them.
[1:29:04] I'm one of them.
[1:29:07] one of them.
[1:29:09] I can.
[1:29:13] I'm one of them.
[1:29:16] And the church of the living God said,
[1:29:18] "Amen. I'm one of them. Birthed and born
[1:29:22] again by the word of the living God."
[1:29:26] Brother Brandon makes the statement,
[1:29:29] "When two omnipotence meet, the
[1:29:33] omnipotent God and the innipotent God
[1:29:36] that is within us, when two omnipotence
[1:29:40] meets," he said, "Things start to
[1:29:42] shake." And saints of God, I want to see
[1:29:45] the devil shake this morning. We've
[1:29:47] heard the word of God. He's a liar. The
[1:29:50] word is true. We're at harvest time. The
[1:29:53] bride's coming to manifestation. And I
[1:29:56] want you to say in your heart of hearts,
[1:29:58] Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus
[1:30:01] Christ. We were talking over the New
[1:30:04] Year's Eve service and different family
[1:30:06] members maybe not away or away from God
[1:30:09] and not serving God, whatever. I,
[1:30:12] Brother Bram said in a token message, he
[1:30:13] said, "Send a token after them." And I I
[1:30:17] want you to say this morning, if I'm one
[1:30:19] of them, if I am a son of God, I can
[1:30:22] send the Holy Ghost after a loved one,
[1:30:25] Brother Roy, you got family, you got
[1:30:27] different ones, you just say, I claim
[1:30:29] them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:30:32] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:30:34] prayer. Heavenly Father, what a word.
[1:30:37] What a promise.
[1:30:39] What a message that has come in this
[1:30:41] hour. so clear, so clean, so pure, so
[1:30:46] holy. Lord, we can say, "I'm washed by
[1:30:50] the blood of the lamb." It wasn't the
[1:30:53] blood of a man. It wasn't the blood of a
[1:30:55] prophet, as we heard our pastor say, but
[1:30:58] it was the blood of God that has washed
[1:31:02] us and cleansed us. And we can truly say
[1:31:05] from the depths of our soul, I am one of
[1:31:08] them. We ask Lord as we close in this
[1:31:12] time frame
[1:31:14] that our loved ones that are wayward,
[1:31:16] Lord, we claim them in the name of Jesus
[1:31:20] Christ.
[1:31:22] Lord, there's those that need
[1:31:23] deliverance.
[1:31:25] There's those that need a a real
[1:31:28] experience in Christ. They need to be
[1:31:31] born again by that incorruptible seed.
[1:31:35] We indeed send the Holy Spirit after
[1:31:38] them, Lord. and seeing the various ones
[1:31:41] on the screen this morning and knowing
[1:31:43] their families and those that are weward
[1:31:45] and how heavy they've been on our hearts
[1:31:48] over the years. There's a time when we
[1:31:51] will have our complete gathering. Lord,
[1:31:54] gather our families around this body
[1:31:58] word of the son of man himself. Bless
[1:32:02] your children
[1:32:04] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We agree
[1:32:09] together. Just give me your hand. Let's
[1:32:13] agree together. Amen. Brother John, I'm
[1:32:17] agreeing with you. We agree. Just give
[1:32:20] me your hand. Just give me your hand.
[1:32:26] Let's agree together
[1:32:31] that all of our enemies
[1:32:35] will crumble at our feet.
[1:32:40] Whatever we bind on earth
[1:32:45] shall be found in heaven
[1:32:49] at the name of Jesus.
[1:32:53] Satan has to flee.
[1:32:59] We've got the power
[1:33:02] in the name.
[1:33:05] If you're going to claim that, maybe
[1:33:06] you've got a loved one on your heart and
[1:33:08] you just want to stand or lift up your
[1:33:10] hands and say, "I claim them in the name
[1:33:12] of the Lord."
[1:33:19] Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] We will not be defeated.
[1:33:26] We've got the power in the name of Jesus
[1:33:28] Christ.
[1:33:30] Oh, for many years now. For many years
[1:33:35] now,
[1:33:36] Satan tried to stop us. Come on. Ride.
[1:33:41] But the bride of Jesus,
[1:33:45] Lord, were still alive.
[1:33:50] But like a mighty army,
[1:33:54] we keep marching onward,
[1:33:59] fighting every battle
[1:34:03] for the Lord's on our side.
[1:34:08] We've got the power
[1:34:12] in the name of Jesus.
[1:34:17] We've got the power
[1:34:21] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:30] We cannot be defeated.
[1:34:35] We've got the power.
[1:34:38] Let's just sing it one more time with
[1:34:40] real meaning now. We've got the power.
[1:34:44] We've got the power. I claim my son.
[1:34:50] I claim my daughter,
[1:34:55] my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law.
[1:34:59] Oh, saints of God, claim yours.
[1:35:10] We've got the power
[1:35:15] in the name of the Lord.
[1:35:21] Hallelujah.
[1:35:23] That's the kind of message that just
[1:35:25] starts welling up within me, Brother
[1:35:26] Kyle. It starts bubbling and bubbling
[1:35:29] and bubbling because I start to see my
[1:35:31] inheritance. I I start to see who really
[1:35:34] I am. You're not floating down a river
[1:35:36] no more. token up no more. No sir, we're
[1:35:39] in the presence of almighty God,
[1:35:41] cleansed by the power of God and now
[1:35:45] enjoying the benefits of Calvary.
[1:35:48] Looking at your sweet little family
[1:35:49] there, what the benefits of Calvary,
[1:35:53] sane mind, beautiful wife, lovely
[1:35:57] children. I say, man, we I I could I
[1:36:00] could sing and shout and dance about.
[1:36:02] Why? We've been born again by the
[1:36:05] incorruptible
[1:36:07] seed of God.
[1:36:10] Oh, it's just lovely seeing you again. I
[1:36:13] think we're going to keep this format.
[1:36:15] We got to keep this format. Juan Carlos,
[1:36:18] God bless you. I see you down there. God
[1:36:20] bless you. There'll be singing,
[1:36:23] shouting, dancing, praying. Give me that
[1:36:27] old time religion. Can we sing that?
[1:36:29] That's an old time way. You might have
[1:36:31] to stand actually to enjoy this song.
[1:36:35] Oh, give me that old time religion. Give
[1:36:40] me that old time religion. Give me that
[1:36:45] old time religion. And it's good enough
[1:36:50] for me. Give me Give me that old time
[1:36:54] religion. Give me that old time
[1:36:57] religion. Give me that old time religion
[1:37:02] and it's good enough for me. It's the
[1:37:07] old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't
[1:37:12] go near it. That's the reason people
[1:37:16] fear it. But it's good enough for me.
[1:37:20] Give me that old time religion. Give me
[1:37:24] that old time religion. Give me that old
[1:37:29] time religion. I love this verse.

[1:37:43] start the devil flying. And it's good
[1:37:47] enough for me. Give me that old time
[1:37:51] religion. Give me that old time

[1:38:05] religion. Give me that old time
[1:38:09] religion. Give me that old time religion

[1:38:24] Amen. Born of the incorruptible seed of
[1:38:29] God. The devil can't go near it. Brother
[1:38:32] John, we cannot overtake a son of the
[1:38:35] living God. That's why Jesus said you
[1:38:38] must be born again, born by his spirit.
[1:38:44] And if you're born by that spirit, that
[1:38:48] demon spirit cannot overcome us.
[1:38:53] God bless you. Have a wonderful week.
[1:38:57] And Lord willing, Brother John Andy's
[1:38:58] will be ministering from this pulpit
[1:39:00] here on Wednesday night. And you know, I
[1:39:05] might as well say it. You know,
[1:39:06] neighbors aren't happy even with us
[1:39:08] here. We have nobody in the church and
[1:39:10] the neighbors aren't happy because we
[1:39:12] got too many cars in the parking lot.
[1:39:15] Well, I'll tell you what. We've got the
[1:39:16] oldtime way. Singing, shouting. We got
[1:39:19] the old time way. And they might not
[1:39:22] like it, but the seed are drawn to it.
[1:39:26] And that's what the bride's attracted
[1:39:28] to, the word himself.
[1:39:32] Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time.
[1:39:34] Father, closing this part of the service
[1:39:36] now. What a wonderful word we've heard
[1:39:39] this morning. We're thankful, Lord, for
[1:39:42] a a man of God, a man of vision, a man
[1:39:45] that has, Lord, set a course. We're
[1:39:48] thankful for a God called man who loves
[1:39:51] the word of life. And so, Lord, as that
[1:39:54] word was spoken this morning, you've
[1:39:57] prepared good ground already. We're not
[1:40:00] the wayside. We're not the thorny side.
[1:40:02] We're not the stony side. Lord, we're
[1:40:04] the good ground. It's been prepared by
[1:40:07] the hand of God. May it bring forth a
[1:40:10] hundfold within these wonderful
[1:40:15] God called sons and daughters of God
[1:40:18] that have joined with us this morning.
[1:40:20] We ask your blessing upon them as we go
[1:40:23] our way. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1:40:29] Amen. One more song. Do you know what it
[1:40:32] is not to have one guilty feeling?
[1:40:35] That'll that'll sing. That'll make you
[1:40:37] smile on your face. Do you know what it
[1:40:42] is not to have one guilty feeling? Not
[1:40:47] to wonder where you're going when you
[1:40:51] die.
[1:40:54] Not condemned. Let that old year go by.
[1:40:58] Not afraid of what tomorrow
[1:41:02] store.
[1:41:04] and know the reason why.
[1:41:08] That's just how
[1:41:11] it feels when you go down in the water
[1:41:16] cuz by faith you believe in what you've
[1:41:21] heard.
[1:41:24] It's not impossible
[1:41:26] dream. You can start over clean.
[1:41:33] When you're washed by the water of the
[1:41:37] Lord, God bless you, saints. You're
[1:41:39] dismissed. Are you washed?
