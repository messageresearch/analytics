I'm going to ask brother Matthew Redell, if you'd come open the service for us in a word of prayer. We do have a [music] few prayer requests we want to remember. Amen. But the blood will never lose its power. You believe that this morning? [music] Praise the Lord. Let's remember our brother Alan King. He has a very bad infection in his left leg and he needs a touch from the Lord at this time. And also our brother Andy Wymer just asking that we would please remember him in prayer. He's lost the first half inch of one of his fingers and he's going back to the doctor on the 23rd. [music] Just asking that the Lord would restore his finger, that there be no infection. He needs it for work. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's remember our brother Andy this morning. And then also our brother Marcus Becker. We want to continue to remember him. who was in an accident and almost lost his hand this [music] past week, but now he has movement back in his fingers. Just asking for a complete healing. And also, my family's just asking that we would please remember [music] my uncle Henry, Henry Hayes Jr., he's starting chemotherapy this Tuesday. God's already moved on his behalf in a supernatural way. They can't find [music] any cancer, but doctors want him to go through the chemotherapy. And we're just asking that the Lord would give him strength during it and give him a complete healing and that he would not be just completely out of commission during it. Amen. [music] So, if there's something on your heart, maybe just as we sing this song, you just raise a hand and confess that you believe it'll never lose its power. Amen. As our brother Matthew comes, let's sing. The blood will never lose its power [music] or it reaches. Oh, for it [music] reaches [singing] to the highest [music] mountain. Oh [music] my [singing] might [music] ever [music] [music] glory to the highest [music] mountain and [music] [music] valley. [music] [music] I know everything to [music] the highest [singing] [music] might [music] give me [music] forever. [music] Let's pray [music] for us. Let's bow our heads. Lord, this is our highlight of our life, Lord, is to be here this morning, Lord. This is what we live for. Where would we be but for the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ? Each one of us, Lord, we think about it often, Lord, where we could be if you didn't keep us. You didn't choose us. You, Lord, we thank you for that, Lord. And this morning, Lord, that blood never loses its [music] power, Lord. These needs that were mentioned, Lord, we know that you knew each situation and you know the end result of each one, Father. So Lord, we commit each one Lord. Hayes brother, Lord, we know it's serious. Lord, we pray you'll come by our brother, Lord, and do what only you can do in these situations, Lord. And each of us, Lord, we have our hands raised, Lord. [music] There's burdens, there's desires, there's needs that we have pressing on our hearts and looking to you, Lord, for the answer [music] because you're the only one that has the answer in these situations, Lord. And we trust it to you, Lord. And Father, we commit this day the word, Lord. We know our pastor, Lord, has labored and looked to you, Lord. And you give him a thought direct from the throne of God. And Lord, we will take it from you, [music] Lord. Bless our brother, Lord. We love him and appreciate him, Lord. And Father, there's so many things going through our hearts and our minds, Lord, but we commit them to you, Lord. Each one, Lord. We're so thankful, Lord, that we have this place to [music] come to, Lord. Would you also just bless the offering, Lord? Lord, you know each one what they can and cannot do. And Lord, we've just seen the track record, Lord, of how you've used, Lord, the ministry and our pastor, Lord, to direct these funds, Lord, and used them around the world, Lord, to so many fruits and so many lives that have been affected because of it, Lord. So, Lord, we commit all that said and done this day into your hands. And we thank you for this privilege and opportunity to be here, Lord, in your name. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe just as they take up the offering, why don't we sing? Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. [music] Heavenly Father, you may have your seats. [music] Appreciate [singing] you. You may be seated.

Maybe just as we prepare to turn to the word now, we can sing this. [music] I [music] have journey [music] through the long dark night [music] out on the open sea. [music] By [music] faith alone, [music] sight [singing] unknown. [music] And yet his [singing] eyes [music] watching me. The [music] anchor [singing] holds [music] though the ship is better. [music] Oh yeah. The sails are [music] tall and I [singing] have fallen [music] all my knees as I [singing] face the raging [music] seas. the anger of hope [music] in spite [singing] of the storm. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I've [singing] had visions [music] and I've [singing] had dreams [music] and I've [singing] even held it in my [music] hands. But [music] I never knew. [music] Then they would slip right [singing] through. [music] Oh, like they [singing] were only brings the sand. [music] Oh, praise the Lord, the anor. [music and singing] All of the sin is [music] matter. I know the [music] wall. for the sail. [music] And I [music and singing] have fallen on my knees [music] as I [singing] face the raging seas. The [music] anger holds. for spite of [music] the storm. Oh, [music] and I have been young, but I am [music] older [singing] now. Oh, when [music] there has been beauty these eyes [singing] have seen. [music] [music] But it was in [singing] the night through the [music] storms of my life. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; For that's where God proved his love to me. [music] Amen. While we stand, let's sing it. The anchor [singing] hold [music] the [singing] savior [music] and the anchor. all [music] the sins I [music] have on my knees that [music and singing] I praise is the endless [music] [singing] soul. [music] This day once again is a testimony. [music] Thank you Lord. [music] My go [singing] [music] [music] and I [singing] have fallen on my knees [music] and I sees the &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you Lord [music] in spite [singing] of the storm. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah to our God. [music] How we thank you father this morning. [music] We are here to testify. The anchor is sure. I have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure. We thank you for this congregation of people. [music] Lord, we thank you for the testimony. We thank you for the witness of [music] the Holy Spirit. Oh, God. These these things are true. Your word is true. Your promises are yay and amen. And we have proven and tested them over time. And we can say [music] so. And we say collectively, glory to our God. [music] We bless your holy name. You're worthy of all praise. [music] Thank you that we can be in the congregation of the living with breath in our lungs and words upon our lips, words of praise. Glory be to the Holy One of Israel. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that you will take this time that we set aside. This is your day, the day of the Lord, [music] and we dedicate it to you, oh God, and we pray that you will be pleased with all that is said and done and the songs [music] how we sense in your presence and nearness. Your name be praised. Bless the word now we pray. [music] Speaker and hearers alike, all that are with us and fellowshipping on the internet or will be in the future. We pray you'll bless, oh God, the saints in Africa, in China, in India, South America, and don't forget us here, Lord. How we need you. [music] We pray, oh God, that in this very wicked time, you'll remember us. And we know that you have shine upon us, oh God, with your glorious light. [music] We shall rise and shine for the glory of God has shone upon us. And now, Father, your will be done in this service in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother Ryan. That was just perfect. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those you that may be visiting, [clears throat] perhaps you're not visiting, you may be here by divine order. We believe that this is God's plan for us to be here. So, he has something in mind for us. I want to say to all of you who were in the wedding yesterday, uh not well yesterday, but Thursday, it seems like yesterday to me. Uh I just want to thank the congregation. I'd like to uh thank the families, the Andes and Caldwell family. Uh I I want to say something about the wedding. It was it was spiritual. There was nothing frivolous. &gt;&gt; It was divine. It was it was just sacred. &gt;&gt; And I thought it was an honor to God to have that kind of a ceremony. And you that uh ever anticipate marriage, I would make that as an example. &gt;&gt; Have a godly, holy, something that God is pleased with. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I want to thank the congregation. I want to thank you all. Thank you young people that were there present. Uh it's very very much in keeping with the service this morning the comments that I made. Uh I said and I would just remind you and for those of you that weren't there that brother Tim had asked me to make a few comments and uh take about 10 minutes and I said that after he had asked me at some time days later I was pondering just exactly what you know thought or looking to the Lord and kind of scanning the horizon the spiritual horizon for what he might have me to say. and and and a thought was inspired to me. [clears throat] So as I began to look into that here, it just expanded and if not exploded and I was I started to write and I started to make notes and then as I was doing that I realized that it was a message. It's the message I preached this morning. And so I just barely touched on it and and you'll maybe pick up a a thought or two as we go along, but it was uh this was inspired to me and I I thought how fitting it was that the young man asked me to say a few words and has such a deep respect and and uh I I felt an honor to be able to say a few words and then as I'm looking to God to say something here here a whole Sunday morning comes out of it. And so I believe that that is of the Lord. And so those of you that are visiting, you're not really visiting. God ordained that you are here. And I I pray that those that aren't here will perhaps uh will uh feel a sense of conviction and want to be here. God bless you all. Are you happy? &gt;&gt; That's the main thing I would like to just say. our our brother George and sister Hope uh that are going back to Nigeria this week. We are going to miss you. &gt;&gt; We're going to miss the singing. &gt;&gt; Brother George is a song leader at their church in Nigeria. And you can see that's why he he gets up. And so someone was asking uh brother George uh how how do you sing? And uh he has all those songs so ready because they sang. And he says, "Well, uh we clap a lot and we dance." [laughter] And that's just what you should have done right here. There'd probably be some that would join you and you might loosen up some of us Canadians and Americans and we could do that. Amen. I enjoy it. I've been in Africa enough. I just really love it. Thank you, brother George. and we're going to miss you and we love you and your family. Uh they're so lovely and come back soon, stay longer. [laughter] Amen. Uh there's been a number of people and we've had a request here and we have prayed for brother Marcus Becker. Uh, brother Marcus Becker is one of the associate ministers at brother Garrett Rodal's church and he had an accident with a chainsaw and he was off himself and you may have heard some of this but brother Hughes message has been in touch with uh the people back there because he spent time in Germany and speaks German and has been doing a lot towards further translations of the German messages. Uh, and we appreciate that. However, I wrote I had heard right away as the same source I think brother Hugh had and uh then I wrote brother Becker and I have a a note short note from his wife, [clears throat] but he was off in the woods uh by himself and had an accident with a chainsaw and almost cut off his hand at the wrist and cut the arteries and ligaments. And uh so he ma he was holding that and trying to phone and he managed to get a a phone call to someone who came and they got a helicopter and flew him to the hospital and have apparently they said everything went very well and he's he's able to get some movement in his fingers. We're thankful for that. And this is what uh sister Becker has said. Dear brother Biscll, very warm greetings from my husband. He will send you a note as soon as possible. He was very touched in his heart. Uh heard about your friendship and concern. The operation went very well and we are thankful to God that the Lord spared his life. They said he had about 15 minutes to live. who was bleeding to death. Many greetings to you and to the saints around you. Uh your thankful sister Martina. So, praise God. We're happy. Marcus Becker was the one that put out a book of all the different places and where phenomena different phenomenal things happened in brother Brandham's life and ministry and a CD with it as well. We we don't have the book here. I have a copy but uh nevertheless they are available from brother Jeff Jenkins church Bible believers there. Thank you musicians. Thank you. If you'd like to open your Bible please to First Kings the 18th chapter. And thank you for standing. And before I read, I'd just like to forewarn you that uh I want to speak [clears throat] on a subject that involves absolutely every person here because you're here and you're living. You have a heart that's pumping. And I want to speak about the heart. But uh my subject this morning is Elijah and the altar. And I'm I'd like to draw a comparison and relationship between your heart, which is not the muscle that's pumping blood just now, but you your heart as the Bible speaks of it. It is such a vast subject. I can scarcely uh touch or give an introduction this morning. But I'm praying that God I've already prayed much that God will give you divine spirit of understanding and revelation that you that that some part of the service even if it's a word or a sentence will just connect with you and that you'll remember it for the rest of your life. That's what I pray. sec first Kings 18 and we'll start at verse 21. Verse 21. And Elijah came unto all the people and said, "How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him. But if Baal, then follow him." And the people answered him not a word. And an opinion is experiencing contradictory and opposing emotions toward the same person at the same time. That's what opinion is. And especially to love and hate at the same time. You may wonder about that, but it's directed to the same person. So on one hand, they love God. on the other hand, they wouldn't serve him. So he said, "How long will you halt between two opinions?" Then said Elijah unto the people, I even I only remain a prophet to the of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men. Let them therefore give us two bullocks. Now, I'd like you to notice as we go through how Elijah gives the order of things. Let them give us two bullocks, and let them choose one bulock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under. And I will dress the other bulock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under. And call ye upon, call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord, and the God that by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, "It is well spoken." And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, "Choose you one bulock for yourselves, and dress it first, for ye are many, and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under." And they took the bullock which he uh was given them. And they dressed it and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, "Oh Baal, hear us." But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. And it came to pass that Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry aloud uh for he is a he is a god. Either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or pre-adventure he sleepeth and must be awake." And they cried aloud and cut themselves after the their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. Notice until the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any that to answer nor any that regarded. And Elijah said unto all the people, "Come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him. Great evangelistic meetings. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. I want to stop there for a moment. Wasn't it amazing that these 400 prophets didn't have any didn't have any conscience that the altar was broke down? Here they're taking the bulock and they're cutting it up in pieces and they're preparing the wood and they're doing all these things. The altar's broken down. &gt;&gt; The basic fundamental is gone. It's not there. They have no conscious of it. They have no awareness of it and they're carrying on with all of his prayers and prophesying and all of these things. the altar's broken down &gt;&gt; and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. And Elijah took the 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name. And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. And he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in order. And he cut the bulock in pieces and laid him upon the wood and said, "Fill four barrels with water and pour it upon the burnt sacrifice and on the wood." And he said, "Do it the second time." And they did it the second time. And he said, "Do it the third time." And they did it the third time. And the water ran round about the altar and filled the trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel. Let it be known this day that thou art God of Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. The heart in the Bible is the inner man. And the scripture says that in Malachi that Elijah would be sent again. There's Elijah number one. Right after him was Elisha, Elijah number two. Then John the Baptist, Elijah number three. And in this day, Elijah number four. And will appear back to Israel, Elijah number five. Five times he comes. And uh he will turn the heart. And the heart is the inner man. And I just like to lay some emphasis. He will turn the inner man. &gt;&gt; He will turn the inner man because the inner man needs to be turned. &gt;&gt; The heart is the mind. He will turn the mind. He will turn the will. The heart is the will. We all have a heart. We all have an inner man. We all have a mind. We all have a will. Oh, I've prayed so many times. God help us to bend our will, turn our will. &gt;&gt; We have uh ideas that we're going to do certain things and God needs to turn that and he has sent a message to turn that and he will turn the heart. He will turn the understanding. The heart is the understanding. We have a certain understanding. Many of us have had all kinds of understandings and this message turned that understanding, &gt;&gt; did it not? &gt;&gt; The soul, the knowledge. Oh, what knowledge we had that needed to be turned. &gt;&gt; Turned where? Turned. He would send a specific word to turn that knowledge to the knowledge of God that our understanding would be correct. We have such even within this congregation sitting here today and those that are on the internet, we've had so many thoughts and so many ideas of God and so much preaching. And I hear I've heard ministry even within the message and they have all kinds of types and all kinds of shadows. There's one type and shadow and that comes from the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And because that has been designed by God, sent by God to a generation whose hearts needed to be turned, whose minds needed to be turned, whose wheels needed to be turned, we were so set in our ways, we needed to be turned. And still even today within our congregation, we need things. We need that uh supple. We need to be supple and ready and flexible so that God can take and turn our minds and our thoughts and our hearts &gt;&gt; have an effect upon us. That this will not just be a Sunday morning service, but it'll be a time when God, the hands of God will be felt within your heart. &gt;&gt; The reflection and the memory. Oh, the memory, the memory that's in that memory channel, your heart. God needs to turn that from what we remember, what we hold in our memory and turn that our inclination, our resolution. We become resolute. I'm going to do a certain thing. I'm going to go a certain way. This is my direction. This is my direction. And if you absorb yourself and give yourself to the message of the hour, you'll find a power starting to twist and turn. The power of transformation turning you from your resolution, what you're going to be, what you're going to do. And you'll find that your interests are changing &gt;&gt; by the power of God. God sent by Elijah. And he turned in his first coming of the spirit of Elijah turned the hearts of the people and they still doing it. It's one of the fundamental things &gt;&gt; of Elijah's ministry &gt;&gt; and you might say [clears throat] he already did. That's what I experienced. I came to believe the message. I can tell you that there are most of us in the message need to still have the effects of that turning power, &gt;&gt; the determination and the conscience and the moral character to turn the conscience to sharpen our conscience. I don't want to sound at all harsh. I don't want to sound that. But I want to say from a burdened heart what I have seen, what I observe of recent times, when I say recent times, perhaps the last number of years, maybe five or more years, but even more pronounced uh more pronounced even now. People still maintain, oh, they believe in a prophet. Don't go to church, &gt;&gt; don't fellowship, &gt;&gt; don't participate, don't contribute anything. &gt;&gt; And uh uh the standards of the world creep in &gt;&gt; and there's even a sense of pride. I'm still a believer. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Not by not by my understanding. Yeah. They need to give themselves &gt;&gt; to the word that God sent &gt;&gt; so that they can be turned from their own thoughts, their own will, their own direction and their and that God may give them a conscience, a quickening to their conscience. I was at the wedding Thursday and I just observed everyone and I was I wasn't saying too much but I observed a lot and this message was heavy on my heart. God. The people need a fresh outpouring of the spirit of God by the spirit of Elijah to renew their conscience. There should have been people convicted, &gt;&gt; about the way they lived, about the way they dressed, about the way they spoke. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about those that spoke at the wedding. Understand me? But our conduct, our moral conduct, &gt;&gt; I'll continue on. The heart is the seat of appetites. It's the seat of emotions. It's the seat of courage and the seat of passions. The heart. Friends, don't ever forget this service. Only the spirit of Elijah that was sent today can turn those passions. &gt;&gt; Turn. Turn. He did it in his first coming. Said come near to me. We need to come near to who God has sent. It won't be popular. And this is what is said in the seven church ages. He said, "Just as Israel came or come in its beauty back in the beginning under Abraham, come on down through the patriarchs. And in the day of Ahab, which was the day Ahab was ruling, right where we read, and in the day of Ahab, it went into the dark ages. and the darkest age that the church sang. And in that time, how that Ahab married Jezebel brought idolatry into the Orthodox church. The same thing the Protestantism married Romanism in the 1500s of dark ages in the Pergamist church came come out with idolatry under the form of Christianity going on out into the into lukewarm age that's coming on before us and we're in it right now. We're in that lukewarm age. Now, I'm not saying in the sense I I recognize that there's believers and we are gathered here because this message is the most precious thing. But I want to say that the age is a lukewarm age. And if there's anything uh that Satan would do, he's so subtle. He want to bring so so that the heat is is lessened so that the zeal is lessened &gt;&gt; and so that our intensity for God's word and our hunger and desire is somehow uh lessened &gt;&gt; because it has a cooling power. It has a cooling effect upon us. And so what we need to do as believers, we need to keep our keep our focus on remaining hot, &gt;&gt; remaining zealous, remaining holy &gt;&gt; because it would try to make us unholy or just not not whirly. We're not like the people on the street, but you know, you can just see the influences of it. It it it's it's it's more of the fashion of the day. It has a cooling effect. &gt;&gt; It has a cooling effect. And then he went on. He says, "Now I want to be very careful here. I want you to be very careful here and see this. God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Just a moment. I have this for you to uh see and read along with me. God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled. [clears throat] Jesus referred to it. It is just before Christ comes the second time. And by the time Jesus comes, all scripture must be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; The gentile age, the gentile dispensation will be in its last church age when the messenger of Malachi comes. He will be right with the word. Did we get that? Now, here's the next one. And I want you to follow very very closely. He will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation. He will start at the serpent seed. And thank God for that &gt;&gt; and carry on to the messenger in the latter reign. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a messenger and that messenger is Christ &gt;&gt; in the latter reign. &gt;&gt; But he will be rejected by the denominations. &gt;&gt; It's like Samuel. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee." Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; They've rejected Samuel. They've rejected his old whole order of of worship. They've actually rejected the office of God's prophet. But they haven't they haven't rejected uh worship as such or religion as such or an order as such. They just want a different order. And God is saying hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected the thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them. I just want to get one thing there. God is actually telling his prophet, give the people what they want. &gt;&gt; Give the people what they want. And so people try to, you know, when you're when you're in the message and you're reading the message, sometimes you hear things you you've got to ask yourself, who's he speaking to? It may be speaking to Pentecost or speaking to and then that's why it says sometimes I'm not speaking to you sisters that are here. These tapes go around the world. You understand? It is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come. Then in the latter rain, then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown. That's what we read today. That is a Mount Carmel showdown. So it's not back in history in First Kings. It happens to be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; At our time, &gt;&gt; we may be standing around looking, but we don't perhaps aren't aware of really what we're observing. Jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown. Now, just before Jesus had a mount transfiguration showdown, the spirit of Elijah came and introduced him. So there was a messenger that came &gt;&gt; but then the messenger Jesus Christ came and had the showdown. The second forerunner of Christ will sew for the latter reign. The second forerunner which is none other than William Brham will seow sew the seed for the show for the latter reign and Jesus Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and the creeds. It wasn't William Brandham. It was Christ in the word &gt;&gt; who was the he he he he was the he he he was the showdown between the denominations and the creeds for he will come to back up his word and take the bride in the rapture. &gt;&gt; So that's a whole that's consummates the whole thing and we're part of that. We're part of that. That's why we're here. He will come for that purpose. And that is why he said uh the messenger will take it all the way to the messenger in the latter reign. John the Baptist came but Jesus was the one who had the showdown. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; John the Baptist came but Jesus was the one that had the showdown. Mount Transfiguration. Now we have another showdown between the denominations and the creeds and whatever. You say, "Well, why are we speaking that we're not a denomination?" That's exactly right. But it's the effect of the world and the religious and our religious past that somehow in our memory. That's why the memory needs to be turned. The will needs to be turned. The spirit of God in the message of the hour needs to turn us. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the age tells us we all have a right. We're in the age of rights. I have a right to believe what I I have a right to say what I want to say. I have a right to be the person I want to be. But maybe the spirit of Elijah wants to turn us from our rights. &gt;&gt; Can you agree with me? &gt;&gt; We need that turning power. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "I want you to be very careful to see this." And so we trust to see and not only see but to be mindful in the message the uh Pergamian church age. He said our forefathers left this land uh left left this land to worship and live in freedom and they pushed back the natives and took over the land. mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up. But after a while, other men of such poor caliber succeeded, these worthy men that soon Ahab was set in the presidential chair. Now, Brother Brown's not back in the book of Kings. He's up in his day and he's identifying it so that we can we don't just see it as a historical figure 40, 50 years ago now. He said, but he had a a a Jezebel behind him to direct him. It is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come. And he did. Uh then the latter rain will come. And it has. A mount caramel showdown. And it has. &gt;&gt; Watch this carefully now to see it in the word. [clears throat] John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. He planted uh planted the former reign and was rejected by the organization of his day. Jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown. The second forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter reign. Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds and he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture. Now I say to you to those that find question and and credibility of the prophet's message, where are they going to go when it's the only word that God has sent to turn the heart? &gt;&gt; Then the heart will not be turned. &gt;&gt; It will be just going straight forward and and affected by the influences of uh of the day of the age. And that leads to lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; And that is the most dangerous. And the furthermore, if the conscience, if the if the if the if the power of transformation that God has put in the spoken word doesn't turn the conscience, then the conscience becomes seared &gt;&gt; and a person continues on. You young people be especially concerned. Then the person just carries on. Well, this is the way I brought up. So, you know, I I I I wear my hair this way or I live this way or I, you know, I I I I live a a a good uh family life. So do the Mormons. &gt;&gt; They probably live a lot better family lives than many people in the message. They live great family lives. &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't I wouldn't trust Joseph Smith. Excuse me. Brother Brandham gives him respect, but I wouldn't trust him with my soul. &gt;&gt; Not for one minute. That's right. &gt;&gt; I certainly have a right to say, God, you vindicated. You vindicated the apostles and you stood and vindicated Jesus Christ that we may know who he is. And he demonstrated the invisible God. And we see this power. We see this. We see this God, the supernatural God doing the supernatural all down through the age. And surely we can expect to to put our anchor &gt;&gt; for our soul. in something that is supernaturally vindicated. &gt;&gt; I have another project I might want some of you young people to assist in. And that is I would like to have I would like to have a a a count. I don't need a a specific count, but I would like to know how many times this prophet of God stood in public and revealed the secret of the hearts of people. Sometimes six times, sometimes twice, sometimes 20 times specifically specific things. Each one of them would be one in a million or one in 10 million or 100 million. and tell that person exactly precisely &gt;&gt; what they're there for, what they're praying for. &gt;&gt; I was so moved. He talked to a little girl in a in a message I was reading in this for this service. Talked to this little girl and he just talked to her so sweetly and so on so forth and said something I've never heard. I don't remember ever reading it before. And he said, "Uh, well, I see that you have uh your eyes water and red and your your nose." Oh, he said it's because you have you either have a cold or hay fever. No, he said it is hay fever. You have hay fever. And he says, you know, there's three layers of skin. Some people only have two. Some people only have one. talking about in the nose. Thought where in the world did he get that? And he says, "And some people only have one and those little birds get in there and that's the trouble." And he says, "But there's something else. There's something else." He says, "Your father, he has a hernia." And he talks about her father. And then the the trouble that her his her mom has. Your mother's not well. And he gives every detail about her mother. And then he says, "Now you go and lay this hand." Cuz he has her by the hand. So you go and lay this hand on both of them and they'll be healed. I'd like a count of how many instances. And then all these people that want to rise up and say, "Well, this, that, that, the other thing." So, no, first, first answer these, &gt;&gt; answer these 10, 12,000 of these. Answer one or two of these. Duplicate this. &gt;&gt; Let me say this again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say to this congregation, that's holding power. &gt;&gt; That's turning power. And I appreciated what I saw on the Lord at the wedding day. Saw you young people and saw this congregation. And I am so delighted and happy that we can preach the word and have a people that'll say amen to it. I want to do that. I want to live by that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Little signs appear. Little signs of slippage &gt;&gt; appear. And slippage is especially a movement away from an original or secure place. Little signs of slippage. We don't want to move away from a secure &gt;&gt; or a safe place. &gt;&gt; Things have changed. Thought I'd see just what what does brother Brandham say. Now, this is a different service and so you we only have one service today. I'm not going to be particularly long, but I want to say what I have to say. Brother Bam talked about old-fashioned. So I thought, what what did he say was oldfashioned? Says what he liked about oldfashioned. He talked about old-fashioned revival. Old-fashioned sassifras preaching. Don't ask me what sassifras is, but I know it's oldfashioned. An [clears throat] oldfashioned handshake. Old-fashioned Holy Ghost gospel. Yes, sir. Old-fashioned Holy Ghost church, old-fashioned conviction, old-fashioned mothers, old-fashioned Holy Ghost songs. Thank you, brother Ryan. Old-fashioned testimony, an old-fashioned cleaning up &gt;&gt; and old-fashioned praying mothers, &gt;&gt; old-fashioned prayer meeting, &gt;&gt; old-fashioned experience of the living God, &gt;&gt; and old-fashioned banners of holiness. I say there's nothing wrong with all of that. I delight in that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God bless this church with all of these things. &gt;&gt; In Clamoth Falls, Oregon, he said, "But today, our men and women, our women are getting away from that. They're getting away from the oldfashioned landmarks &gt;&gt; we used to go by. He said, "You ought to get back to that old Pentecostal landmark. What you need here in this valley, as I looked around today, is an oldfashioned God sent, sky blue, sinkilling religion. the power of the gospel back in the churches again, back through the blood of the L of the Lord Jesus into the fellowship by relationship by being born of the Holy Ghost entering into the Pentecostal shakina. Amen. Not talking about a denomination for sure. I'm not beside myself. He said, "I know where I am." Oh, but brother, sister, to get caught away into the shakina glory where just you and God alone are standing, fellowshipping. That's the only approach that I know of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel like praising God. &gt;&gt; I feel like shaking off all formality. feel like shaking off all order of the service, saying, "Glory be to God." &gt;&gt; Would you like to do that? &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We praise your wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Turning by the power of the Holy Ghost, both to the right way and from the wrong. Both. It's a double-edged sword. Both to the right way and away from the wrong. Following the altar through the scriptures, I found that Noah, that's the first time altar is mentioned in the Bible. That the altar is mentioned in the Bible. Brother Brandham says Cain and Abel both built an altar. But it's the first time it's mentioned in the Bible. And Noah immediately following the flood, Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. alters. I'm comparing it to your heart, your inner man, your inner being, your inner person, your will, your conscience, your memory, your resolution, your determination, or that inner person. It could be of wood or earth. Earth, simple things that everybody can get a hand on. Or wood or stone, unhuman stone, brass. The I'm talking about the heart now, which was brazen in the Bible. and gold. Those the items. Now, let me put it in a message language. Earth or wood, the common simplicity within everyone's reach. Stone, the revelation that takes place here in the heart. brass, a place of judgment, a place where things are judged in the inner man. No one can judge it for you. You must judge it yourself. And under the deep conviction of the Holy Spirit, you waste something out. And perhaps this comes back by the Holy Ghost in your memory and you say, "That isn't right. And I need to change that. Then bear with me now. Then comes a time of I must sacrifice this. That's what the altar is all about. The altar is for sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That's what the altar is made for. &gt;&gt; The heart is made for sacrifice. And the Bible speaks of the heart as being exceedingly wicked. &gt;&gt; And out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. &gt;&gt; And yet on the other hand, it's the very place where God puts his seat. It's a it's a place of most holy things. So it can have either one or the other. But then comes the time when a man or woman or a young person weighs it out and said, "I I've been so resolved. I've been so desiring to do a certain thing and there's something that keeps rising in my heart and I perhaps it's the Holy Spirit and you read in the message and something twins something clicks and it's turning you slowly because there's resistance there and as you read the message and you realize who it is that's speaking and this has come from eternity. This man did not speak of his own will. He spoke things that cost him all of his friends. &gt;&gt; He spoke things that caused him to be rejected. &gt;&gt; He spoke things that people wanted the great gift and the power and the all of the revelation of the uh of the secret of the hearts, but they didn't want this word. And he was being cast out and doors closed &gt;&gt; because it was Christ that was being closed out. and it's trying to get it to the people. And here we are and we say, you know, I I just I have that set I've had that set in my heart for a long time. And finally, one day we just break. Okay, God. I'm done, right? I give it all to you. &gt;&gt; And that's when that thing becomes a sacrifice. And when you sacrifice it, it never comes back to itself again. That burnt animal remains burnt, goes up in gases, and it never becomes an animal again. It's given over to God, and you settle it with God, and you go on from there, and you're done. That's a sacrifice on God's altar. And it came to pass there were burnt sacrifices. There were peace offerings. There's incense that was a sweet smelling savor to God. There was common simplicity, revelation, and judgment in character rises from the altar. of the heart. And it came to pass at midday that midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the evening sacrifice and there was no voice and no answer and none that regarded. I've spoken to individuals that have left this message and I said there will be a day &gt;&gt; you'll need to call on God. There will come a time, you know, I find that also there's a there is a a searing there's a the world has a way of searing the conscience &gt;&gt; and people can be immersed in the world and completely going to pieces and hell is swallowing them up and yet you hear from their lips, I'm fine. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? the world and powers of hell have deceived the individual to feel I'm fine and yet in line in in in in the in the view of the scriptures in the view of the message of the hour they're going completely the opposite direction and the world is swallowing them up completely and yet in the mind the consciences has has not been subjected to the message so they say I'm I'm I'm okay my family's okay and the Kids are going to hell. &gt;&gt; They're going the way of hell. &gt;&gt; They say, "I'm okay." We're not okay. &gt;&gt; It's not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking from a burden heart, friends. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I'm not one who's rejoicing over those things. &gt;&gt; I'm spending my life and all my energy and all my strength to echo this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've even had emails since the wedding saying, "Thank you for the godly stand. Let this church as brother Tim Dodd preached on Wednesday and I was standing here and there was something that spoke to me and I I urge you if something speaks to you, try to follow my pattern. At least I'll give you what I do." I I catch a hold of that phrase. I hold it in my heart. I will not let it go because I believe the Holy Spirit has made it real to me. &gt;&gt; And he said one phrase when Esther came in before the king while she was uh uh while she was hesitant and so on so forth. And yet it was her privilege to come in, but she thought it was not. She thought she could die, but he was waiting for her. And when she came in and the king and I could see it so real and I I'm giving you now a personal testimony to you to you as individuals. And brother Tim said and the king said to Esther, "What is your request?" &gt;&gt; And I stood right back there and I said, "Oh God, what is my request? I've got things I could ask for. I got people I'm very burdened for. I've got things I could ask for very much in my heart. I thought, what would I ask for? What is my request? So my request, my request, oh God, is that you will so pour out your own spirit within this congregation and within this sanctuary that these people will taste and come to know the reality of things that I have experienced and things that are greater than I have ever experienced. Let it come. Let this congregation, this assembly rise as a flame and as a torch within this message of the hour. Let them shine with the glory of God and so that the that the testimony will reach far and broad and even around the world. That would be my request. &gt;&gt; That's my request. And so I appeal to you. Give your heart &gt;&gt; as an altar to God and search your life. Is there anything that needs to be sacrificed? And if there is, lay it there &gt;&gt; and sacrifice it before God. And Elijah took the 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob under whom the word of the Lord came. Who do the war of the Lord come to? The word of the Lord comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. He just heard all this prophesying and all this going on. Listen this is the friends this is in the life this is in the life of the prophet this in the life of brother Brandham here and that's why it talks about there were you know blood on her hands and all kinds of signs and all kinds of phenomena that was happening and right at this time and thousands of people coming to his meetings and all of these things great aal and all these men were having such great meetings and so on and so forth and calling on God and everything. And yet he said to me, he said, "It's over. These big meetings are over and I'm in I'm including my own." Because he knew that the spirit of that had lifted. There was a change. A a change had come &gt;&gt; had already arrived and he was even speaking it in advance because of meeting some of them were still Jimmy Swagger and all these people were still going on great big he said it's over. &gt;&gt; Thank God. for a current message &gt;&gt; that is more alive today this morning than it was even then. People didn't even know what it was. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the opening of the seals. Thank God for the opening of the word. Thank God for the third pull. We didn't even know what the third pull was. &gt;&gt; And so we received revelation. Oh, I got such a revelation. You still need the message of Elijah &gt;&gt; to place that stone. &gt;&gt; Only Elijah knew. Those stones had already been laying there. There was no one else who knew anything. They they were just a pile of stones. &gt;&gt; All of these truths were always laying here. &gt;&gt; We didn't know those truths. And then when we say, "Oh, now I got a revelation." You still need the prophet to to set that stone. &gt;&gt; Well, what will it be when he's done setting it? Well, he'll place this revelation and he'll place that one. And what God requires and calls for, he'll place them all. And when you're done, you'll have an altar. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray that with everything that's in me. Oh God, hear me. I pray that for you that you will give over and let God that you will find out. Give yourself to this message. You cannot find your own way. That's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You cannot determine your own direction. You will not find your own way. Furthermore, you say, "Well, I'm okay. Be careful of that." The world tells you that. The world is telling you, "I'm okay." &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have I have my family. I have my car. I have my things." That's nothing. That's rust and ashes. &gt;&gt; That's going to pass away. &gt;&gt; I'll say with the songwriter, "What then?" &gt;&gt; What then? &gt;&gt; Then where are you? Don't stand before God having disregarded the very word he sent to you personally. &gt;&gt; Not to tickle your emotion. Now, I'm going to dig deep, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm going to dig deep. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We'd say, "Well, we I begin to see this and oh, I see the serpent seat and I see these things and I I I I see the I I see the opening of the word in the ministry of the son of man. And I see that you need him &gt;&gt; to set those &gt;&gt; in a proper place." And when they finally are set and built up into an altar, say, "What was this altar for?" It's for sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It's for sacrifice. And the prophet said, "The altar is your heart." God even ordained that you would have it as a place of sacrifice. Maybe at the level that we've lived. May I suggest to you it's not sufficient. What what should I be doing, brother Biscll? I think you should think about these things seriously when you leave here. Lay your life down on the sacrifice. Can I say a few things about the altar? The first one was of Noah. Do you mind? Abraham built an altar. There was altars down through and they just God just met them and they just made an altar right then. whatever was there. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it was made from clouds of dirt. Sometimes it there's no special place. You don't have to have you don't have to find a, you know, wait for some special uh high-grade moment. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't expect the service. I didn't expect it, &gt;&gt; but here we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we believe if you believe we are as late as we are in time and if you believe that we are as close to the rapture change, I say the power of the message needs to do some more turning within the body of believers. So only Elijah could take hold of the great stones of Revelation and begin to shape them into the form of an altar for sacrifice. If you read earlier, you find that they the people even were leaping on their altar. &gt;&gt; It didn't even come to their mind. The altar's been broken down. They didn't have anybody to repair it. &gt;&gt; And now Elijah knows that God who he serves is going to answer by fire. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks and talks about Isaac and he's actually carrying the wood because he's a perfect type of Christ. He's carrying the wood. He's carrying his sacrifice. He's carrying his own altar and he is the sacrifice and Jesus carrying his cross. And then Isaac literally climbs up onto his altar as Jesus. They took him and laid him down on his altar of wood. And there your sin, &gt;&gt; my sin that we can we can say I'm without sin and it's gone. It's gone. But there all the judgment of almighty God had to come with the fires of the fire almighty fire of God's justice. And there he was judged at that altar on his altar. And there righteousness sprung like a fountain to make us not only clean, but to take our sin and bring it into an annihilated state. &gt;&gt; Don't let the world come and and impose it back onto you. &gt;&gt; See, as Leo is saying, church age, you might say, "Well, we're way beyond that, brother. I'm glad that we are or you are. But in this age, way beyond that. Say, well, we've gone way beyond that. It's it's not that the people become that the religious people became rank ranked sinners. No, he said you become lukewarm. &gt;&gt; They hadn't lost everything. They become lukewarm. And because of that, God would spew them out of his mouth. Here's a couple. I'd like to leave you with these quotes before I move on. In revelation chapter the fourth fourth chapter he said but when Christ comes you've created an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily and the great St. Paul said, "I die daily. Nevertheless, I live. Not me, but Christ liveth in me." In Jehovah Gyra 64, he said, "We have no altar to come to." Speaking of the place he was preaching, he said, "Your heart is the altar." He speaks of stones. Now, I want you to think about that. I know that I'm speaking to uh mature Christians, mature believers, but in the light of what I've said, he said, "What good is what good is stones?" I'll say, "What good is revelations?" What good is a revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got a stonemason to shape them, &gt;&gt; confession is stones. We make our confessions. He says, "And when Peter made his confession, Jesus said, "Thou art Peter a little stone. But what good is a stone if there isn't a stonemason there to shape him into a son of God?" &gt;&gt; He made that confession, but then the Holy Ghost had to come upon within him and God that that power that word transformation transforming power begin to shape him into the kind of apostle that God would have him to be. The stones were there while 400 prophets were prophesying or preaching and all the people. There's churches that are upholding themselves as voices of this message who have gone away from the message. Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, where is the power now to turn the hearts of the people? &gt;&gt; And if that power doesn't exist, then the hearts of the people have one way to go. Listen to me. Only go can go to the world &gt;&gt; because there is no holding power. Don't think within yourself, well, somehow we're going to sustain ourselves. You will never sustain yourself outside of the me. That's why it was sent. &gt;&gt; Turn the heart from that. &gt;&gt; And if that is relegated to some lower place and and well, we we don't but we need this plus psychology or we need this plus something else. I've seen all of that. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the prophet was here. We we need the gospel plus we need the Bible schools and we need to give the diplomas out and we need all of that before they can go out preaching the gospel. And it was the plus problem. The plus that they had plused to themselves which actually was cold water on the on the hot and turn it lukewarm. &gt;&gt; You know that's true. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that's true. &gt;&gt; I experienced it. I saw it. I've lived through it. And that is why I hold so fervently I say, "Oh God, if if you don't keep this fire burning, there's no way for it to burn. &gt;&gt; If you don't hold this congregation, there is no power that can hold it. &gt;&gt; There is no intelligence. Satan is a slicker. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he knows more about the Bible than we do. &gt;&gt; He knows how to handle and articulate it and and and introduce it and give meaning." Think about it, friends. They're being introduced to people all over on the internet and everything. I wouldn't give it a minute. &gt;&gt; I don't read it for a second. I'm not interested in what the unbelievers say. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what the unbelievers say. &gt;&gt; You ought to support that. &gt;&gt; You ought to have the same conviction. I'm not preaching to you. I'm I'm counseling you from this pullpit. I wouldn't give it a second thought. &gt;&gt; When you know the source of it, &gt;&gt; I would forget it. &gt;&gt; Are they men of God? &gt;&gt; No. People are going to find all kinds of fault and all kinds of things. I've had them come here and and and uh I've been interviewed here by the ecumenical newspaper and they said, "Well, we understand uh you know, they always come up with the same things 1977." &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, did you read did you read Brother's message?" "Well, no, but they they have all of the things that have been said about it." I said, 'Well, to be a good journalist, you need to find and go to the source. What did he say about it? Did Did you Did you print and say what he said? What? He said, "I do not prophesy." Well, they said, "But prophesying and predicting is the same thing." If you look in the dictionary, I don't look in the dictionary. Look at what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not prophesying. I'm predicting." And furthermore, as far as you you can put me down as a fanatic, but when he said 1977 ought to usher usher in, &gt;&gt; and I said, did you read that word usher? I said, the bride is being ushered in. Where is she? Is she in the parking lot? &gt;&gt; Is she at the foyer? Where's the bride? She's being ushered in. Has she just come into the foyer? Is is she into the port kosher? Where is she? Is she just coming out of the automobile? Where is she? And then they begin to get a picture. I said, "Is he just coming down the aisle? Where is she?" &gt;&gt; He used exactly the right word. &gt;&gt; The bride is being ushered in. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let us go home. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; take us home. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go? Can you say, "Take me home." You ought to be able to say that. &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to say that. &gt;&gt; Take me home. I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; I'm happy for the unadulterated gospel. &gt;&gt; I'm happy that a prophet would say he ought to take and preach this gospel barefisted. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A prepared altar. A prepared altar. There isn't a man, woman, or child in this building that doesn't need a prepared altar. &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman, you have a heart within you. You have lots of ambitions. You've got zeal. You've got, you know, you've got your beauty. You've got plans. You've got a future. You need someone &gt;&gt; to build your altar. &gt;&gt; You've got a heart. You absolutely have a heart. I'm talking now to you young people. You've got some strength within. You've got plans. You've got uh something you've thought about and you're going a certain direction. I'm not saying it's wrong. You boys have a heart. There's only one person I know. That's the messenger in the rain. None other than Jesus Christ. who the prophet was sent. And he sent it with the word. &gt;&gt; And that word, if you hear it, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; if you stay under the sound of it, you'll find your life, you'll find it almost imperceptibly, you'll find it changing &gt;&gt; and indexing and things you once desired will start to dissipate. And then strong ambitions will be turned. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; I'm still going to close. Here's some things I just know spoke to you very personally. You have a heart. That heart you have ambitions. And I talked about the things that need to be turned and they will only turn them Godward only turn it the right direction. But also the heart is especially and here's the things the Bible says about the heart can be filled with fear. There isn't anybody here. But what down in your heart has experienced fear. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We fear things. We fear the future. We fear will we be able to people will get older. They fear whether will there be a medical will the medical system be there for them. Will will there have enough for retirement? Uh they they that are raising children, how will my kids turn out? And they and they have a concern as it's it's all right to be concerned as long as we don't turn it to fear and to start to fear our future. And brother Brandham says when the angel came on &gt;&gt; always came he would say first fear not. &gt;&gt; And I know what that is friends. I sat beside brother Brandham when that angel of the Lord came right in the vehicle. That presence of that one came right in the vehicle. Just a little bit forward. Not right between us. Just forward like this. Nothing visible to the eyes. Far more than visible. I was completely frozen. And I thought if I breathe I will die. If I exhale, I'm going to pass into some other place. And I just cast my eyes sideways. And brother Brandham had lost all the color in his face. And we had several days beard on. And I have seen one man that was right at the edge of death that had just just had missed death by a hair. and he didn't have much of a beard, but his beard just stuck out prickly from the shock of the body. And I just cast my eyes sideways and brother Brandon was driving and his beard just was prickly all over his face and his face was ashen and the shot and the thought just shot through my mind. He looks like a man that's near death. And he just rolled his head back like this and cast his eyes to me. He said, "Brother Eddie, I guess he's come to me 10,000 times." 10,000. And it's every time the same. It's just like I could die. That was exactly what I was going through. I thought I was going to die and that was the experience. No wonder from that incredible presence of the angel of the Lord which is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ in that form &gt;&gt; the holiness is so intense you just can't. And he said to me at another time he said it's like a like a fine wire with 10,000 volts going through it. said we're not these bodies aren't made for that. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to have a change in your body to live in his presence. &gt;&gt; Oh, and we have sent he sent his word to change your body. &gt;&gt; We will need to be changed and that is why he always would say first fear not &gt;&gt; it is me be not afraid. This word will sever from you. And this may not apply to everyone, but grief. Somebody may be in grief or despair. This word will also not only turn you in one direction, but turn you away from the despair and the discouragement. I know the world we live in and we're faced with such insurmountable things and we say, "Where's the answer?" Christ, the word is still the answer. &gt;&gt; Still the answer. I'm not preaching to make you happy. I'm preaching so you might realize the things that have been made real to you is nothing other than Elijah. the spirit of Elijah building up and placing the stones. &gt;&gt; He'll take the heaviness and the remorse, the brokenness. These are all things from the scripture. A broken spirit, a broken heart, a weary heart. We get weary with the toils of life. But your altar is a place of sacrifice where what was in the heart dies. Apostle Paul said to a group of people, notice what he said. He said, "I observed your place of worship and I beheld your devotions and I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God." You know what? There may be somebody here today, even though you're a believer of the message, you may say, you know, I really don't know God. You need to know him by knowing him. I know in him. I know him in whom I have believed. &gt;&gt; We need to know who God is. &gt;&gt; And listen, God is this word that's been revealed. That is the only God that I really know. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I've observed this and in this inscription to the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you. Him I declare, not not the church or the or just the worship, but him, the person I declare unto you." And then when Jesus came embodied in flesh and the scripture says, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." And I'm going to close in just a few moments, but I want you to see this. He was the lamb slain. Perhaps you can finish it. He was the lamb slain. &gt;&gt; Perhaps we could say it again. And he was the lamb slain &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet could say Jesus Christ was God's heart. &gt;&gt; The very heart of God. &gt;&gt; Catch it. The very heart of God was on an altar &gt;&gt; in heaven. Jesus Christ, the very heart of God. And he allowed him to be judged with all the severity of the holiness of Almighty God. And there he was on an altar in eternity, the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. And the prophet said he came out of the eternities wounded cuz he'd been he he had been in battle, but he came out victorious &gt;&gt; for you. for you young sisters, for youth families, for you senior people, for congregation of Cloverdale Bible Way, for the believers of this message, wherever this gospel will go and wherever this message will be preached, this heart of God, &gt;&gt; God laid his own heart &gt;&gt; on his own altar &gt;&gt; and sent him down &gt;&gt; with a message. to you. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it, but he did it. &gt;&gt; And he let even the messenger, he let the vessel be detested and cast out and spoken evil of and every kind of thing that was not so, but he allowed it. So that message, tell you what friends, nobody knows what that messenger went through. We think our trials are big and brother Brandham often refers to it Samadair, Dr. I'm a dare. Tell him, "Billy, you better come down quick. Your little baby's dying." "Oh, no. No." He said, "That can't be." And go to her bedside. He's all twisted up with spinal menitis. And he's crying out to God. And he said his prayers just the heavens are like brass. Brass. And God wasn't going to hear it. And he said, "The pain is so excruciating. Some of you are young fathers. How would you manage to say you're a child? This is a real friends. How how would we deal with it?" and finally see the eyes cross and just in such excruciating pain and the eyes cross and the child and you're calling out don't do it God don't do it don't do it and just slips away from you and brother Brandon said he prayed for 400 children with crossed eyes there wasn't one of those parents who walked away with their child healed from crossed eyes. He said, "Not one of them." But what God healed it, there wasn't a parent, there's not one parent that knew the cost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What did that cost for him to be molded and pray with such such intensity? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And that's what was in his mind is little Sharon Rose and all twisted up with that spinal menitis. What am I talking about? I'm talking about a sacrifice &gt;&gt; and to come to a place where he would allow that and let that go &gt;&gt; and never hold that against God. Thy will be done. &gt;&gt; And Jesus on his way to his altar. The sacrifice has to be prepared. And in Gethsemane, the sacrifice was being prepared for the prepared altar. Father, if it's possible, &gt;&gt; if it's possible, let this cup pass. Nevertheless, not my will, thine be done. and the sacrifice the prepared sacrifice I don't want to talk about personal things because it's so infot it's insignificant and it doesn't matter but each of us have our own and it seemed like mama's my whole world it's going to disappear I never forget I never forget that I thought I'd finally that the will of God for my life had finally been achieved and I didn't have any profession. I didn't have any special skills but I managed to become executive in the company and and I could travel and the president just thought everything was fine and I was he was so happy he said I don't care as long as you look after the business you do. I went and preached. I took churches while pastors were away. I went to Jamaica and had a convention. And I I thought this was the this was the answer to all of my prayers. One day God just said, "Leave it. You're going to leave this. Do you mind if I tell you? I thought this is impossible. It's impossible. But God was starting to prepare made a sacrifice &gt;&gt; thing that I thought was the answer to God that God had given me all of this and given me this nice job and so on and gave me favor with the pre president of the company and he wouldn't let me pay for anything. Wouldn't let me pay for the newspaper to my door. wouldn't let me pay for the telephone, wouldn't let me pay for my car, and they bought a house. Bought a house for me, gave me the house for $125 a month, beautiful fourbedroom, four-level brick home on the edge of a creek. And I just thought, you know, isn't this wonderful? God has finally smiled on me. I'm through hard 30 years of hardship. Said, leave it. Took me nine months. Took me nine months. And part of that was I drove down just to attend a meeting with brother Brandham. And Doc Brandham came out in the crowd and said, "Brother Brandham is here and he'd like to see." And I stepped into his office. And he took a hold of my hands and he said, "Brother Eddie, every time I see you, I see Indians." And I wanted to come back west so bad. And yet I was having and I finally laid it down on the altar. Sometime we have to find that place. It may not be here. I'm not going to have an alter call, but you may I'm going to pray with this congregation just now. I pray that God will prepare you prepare your sacrifice. Can I say it? &gt;&gt; God has a greater work for this congregation to do. This message needs to go out with more force &gt;&gt; and more power &gt;&gt; and more dedication. &gt;&gt; It needs to be lived on the streets. It needs to be witnessed. It needs to be lived exactly as the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; And God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, this congregation. God bless all under the sound of my voice. I have felt directed by Almighty God. And I say God bless you &gt;&gt; and make each of you a flame and a torch. &gt;&gt; And if you have not surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, you should do so. &gt;&gt; You must do so. &gt;&gt; We cannot leave you here. &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Terrible times coming, friends. Terrible times. And it'll come in so subtle, you'll think this is just ordinary stuff. It's not. It's wicked. You know why that school is there? Because the schools are hell holes. &gt;&gt; Know that there's teachers. I don't say this of all teachers, but many of them are literally demonpossessed &gt;&gt; and come with the intent of deceiving his children &gt;&gt; and the system is corrupt. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether they say they've just legalized they've just legalized and there's a big ad in our little local paper right here. to the legalized marijuana. And they put a warning out if anybody or any organization wants to wants to have a voice against it, let it be known as going to cost them something. It's going to cost them money and you must be prepared to pay for it. Isn't that incredible? Why don't they say to the people, "If you want this, it's going to cost you something to get this passed." No, they tell those that are opposing it, it's going to cost you something. I can show you the ad. It's so foolish. Somebody wrote it in hell. &gt;&gt; Some demon out of hell inspired it. Listen, folks. We live in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; That just happens to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time. Would you stand with me? I'd like you if you would bow. And perhaps something was said now that remains fast in your heart. Hold it. Hold it. And now I'd like each person to pray and ask the Holy Spirit, spirit of God, author of this word, Almighty God, author of the message that has been sent. &gt;&gt; This is not This is a sanctuary, but it's not just another church. No, this is a place that upholds something that very few treasure, but we treasure it. Lord, we treasure it with all of our heart. I thank you for the stalward hearts of the people. I thank you for this loyal support, oh God, and they come with their presence. They come with their conviction. The people come with their courage. You have indeed turned our hearts uh from the uh ways of the world. Not merely the ways of the world, but the lukewarmness and the inconsistency and the just the wavering uh as waves driven of the sea. But you have given us a stability, Lord. We're so thankful for that. We're so thankful for the standard that you have put within the hearts of the people. And yet, Lord, we feel that you would move us forward. There has been things that have hung on, things that have impeded, things that have hindered, things, oh God, which have uh taken our thoughts and have distracted us in different ways. In the name of Jesus Christ, Satan, I come to oppose you. You are the archeneemy of my Lord God, the God of Israel. You're the archeneemy of my Lord Jesus Christ. And he, Michael, cast you out of the heavenly region. You have come here to earth. You found your way into Eden. And now through the science and the people eating from the tree of knowledge, oh God, uh, keep us from eating from that tree. Oh God, cause us to feed at the at the table of the Lord. Cause us to feed at that supper table that you've prepared. This glorious seven course meal that you have given. May we eat and may we digest. May we be strengthened. May we be given guidance and leadership. I pray in the holy name of Jesus Christ. in the holy name of Jesus Christ. While we're pondering these things, I would like to sing, "Open my eyes that I may see. I'd like you to prayerfully [music] sing this. That's been on my mind all morning. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My [singing] eyes th glimpses [music] of truth thou has for [music] me and place in my hands the wonderful [singing and music] king that shall God was and set me [music] free. Silently now [music] I wait for thee. I'm ready [music] by God. Thy [singing] will to see. Open [singing] my eyes [music] in you and [singing] me. Spirit [music] [singing] once again please silently [music] now I wait for thee. &gt;&gt; Listen to these words. [singing] &gt;&gt; Pray my God. [music] I will to see. Open [singing] my eyes to [music] me. Spirit [music] divine. [singing] [music] Open my ears that [singing] I may [music] hear. Voices [singing] of truth. [music] Thou send it near. And while the wind [singing] knows what I [music and singing] break will I credit it Lord silently [singing] [music] now I wait for thee my father I &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; See, open [singing] my eyes [music] to be spend. [singing] Open [music] my mouth and let me pray. [music and singing] Glad to be the Lord through everywhere. [singing] [music] Open my heart and let me prepare. [singing] Love with my [music] children. [singing] Silently bound I [music and singing] wait for thee. Ready [singing] my God. [music] I will to see. Open [singing] my [music] eyes to me. See, [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; I'm not just going to say a closing prayer. I feel I would disobey and grieve the Holy Spirit if I did that. There no doubt is some here that's right on the cusp of a decision. [music] You may have already settled it in your heart. Please understand our culture, the culture of this nation, the culture of America, the culture of the world [music] has not been designed and cultivated by God, &gt;&gt; by a Holy Spirit. [music] The world has their standards and the world has their and they've imposed that upon us. And perhaps perhaps you may be here. Perhaps you may be here under the effects or in influenced by the age that we're in. I pray that God will wash that away. Perhaps you say, "Well, I was raised in a certain culture and certain things were accepted. Are they accepted by the message?" You want to ask that. you want to ask yourself, whatever you do, don't put that in second place. Put it in number one. &gt;&gt; And I appeal especially to you young men, young ladies, the young people of this congregation. You will have to take this gospel. [music] You'll have to take this standard and you'll have to hold it high and you'll have to declare it in life and declare it in word. It will be on your shoulders to raise families [music] and to have homes that are God glorifying. It's not enough for us to stand here and preach and and for you to look on at that. You got to say that'll be me. &gt;&gt; That's my place. I must do that. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And so if you have that something that perhaps you feel I I need I need a nudge. I just feel to be strengthened. And if you feel urged to come and stand or to come and kneel as our sister [music] has. It's open. This is not the altar. The altar is in your heart. That's the altar God's looking at. This place won't do anything for you unless it's right in here. And so God, if God's been dealing with you and speaking to you and calling you, he has a plan. I don't know what that plan is, but he has a plan. So we'll just sing it once again. Silently [music] now [music] [singing] for thee. I'm ready. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm ready, oh God. &gt;&gt; I will. &gt;&gt; I [music] will to see. Open my [singing] eyes. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; is [singing] worth [music] I [singing] wait for thee. My God, [music] thy will to see. Lord, [music and singing] open my eyes to you and me. [music] [music] Say, "Savior, Savior, pass me down. [music] Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry. You that have come and you that are standing, just release [music] and let that cry of your heart go up to quad. [music] You're here for a divine purpose. I'm taking this service so seriously. May this be a lifechanging moment. [music] May this be a life-changing moment. I speak it in the name of the Lord. And it's for the purpose that you have come that you shall receive your answer from the hand and heart of almighty God. [music] They will see your heart. The altar of God. Father, these altars stand here at this human altar. But this is not the altar. God, you're the one that looks upon the heart. You said, "I look upon the heart, not the outward mind. I look upon the heart." Lord, I pray that you'll find the answer in the sacrifice, saying, "Not my will. Thy be done. [music] Not my will. gentle [music] for [music] my heart. [music] [music] [singing] Holy [music] not [music and singing] [music] Oh, [singing] [music] save [music] my heart [singing] from [music] another &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; are the calling [music] for you are passing [music] and ask some that would come.
