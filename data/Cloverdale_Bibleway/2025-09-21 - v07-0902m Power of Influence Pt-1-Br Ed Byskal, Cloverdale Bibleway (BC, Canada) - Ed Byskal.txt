Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to your name, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father. And I'm going to ask our brother Dave Chabernoff to come and lead us before the throne of grace this morning. We don't have any written requests, but I know there's lots of need needy people in our midst. And if you've got a need, if you're listening in on the internet, you've got a need. We've got a God here this morning. You know, regardless if it's big or small, and I just this past week, I sat down Thursday night. I've been wrestling with this. We were trying to get Jeremy's website, which is all done, finished. And it's going to be going up as soon as we can get it up. So, but we had to move it on to a new thing. And I've been doing all the technical stuff. I had virtual machines and virtual appliances and all this stuff. I know nothing about. And I've been m messing with this stuff for a month. And I just said, Lord, I don't have time to spend another month doing this. We need to get this up. And uh Lord, I don't have a clue what I'm doing. I know given enough time, I could probably get there, but you know, I don't have time. Lord, I need your help. I need you to get this thing done. I started 7:30 Thursday night. By 9:30, the whole thing was done. And I've been working on it for a month. I just said he started me heard me yelling downstairs. I just praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's He's here for whatever your need is. &gt;&gt; I mean, he knows it. He knows finances. He knows phys physical needs. Whatever your need is. Somebody think, well, God, you what do you know about? He knows. I mean, when you think there are billions, I was reading this week said if you took a sandbox and all of those grains of sand in it are stars, that's the Milky Way. And then you took the earth and filled it up all inside and out with sandboxes. You're starting to get some kind of comprehension. Each one of those sandboxes got a billion, couple of billion, 50 billion stars in it. He made it all. He put all those physical laws in place so that everything would run. I &gt;&gt; mean, if you've got a need this morning, he can meet your need, saints, whatever it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you just come before him, lift it before him as we come to prayer. Brother Dave, let's bow our heads. Our precious heavenly father. Lord, even as our brother Rod was just encouraging us this morning to believe, Lord, &gt;&gt; singing the song only believe, all things are possible, Lord, that to those that believe, Lord, just Lord, we believe that this morning, Father, we know that you're here. We feel your presence, Lord. It's just so good to be in your house, Lord. To be able to open our mouths and to give glory to the God of our salvation. Lord, to open our mouth and give praise to a God who has delivered us from this everpresent world. Lord, let us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; What a blessed people we are this morning, Lord. We want to open our mouths. We want to give you glory, Lord Jesus. Lord, even reading the scriptures this morning that our life is but a vapor, Lord, &gt;&gt; it's passing quickly, Lord. But while we're in this vapor, Lord, we want our lives to be a glory to you, Lord Jesus. We realize, Lord, we have a great hope laying before us, Father. We just want to bless somebody while we're in this world, Lord. Father, we thank you for your presence this morning. We thank you for the brothers and sisters of like precious faith, the children that you have plucked from this evil generation. Lord, what a what a great holy calling it is, Father, to be gathered with your children, the bloodbought, the redeemed. Lord, we praise you for this, Lord Jesus. We praise you that we can be here in this group, Lord. Be called, elected, chosen, placed. It's a high and holy calling, Lord. We want to live a life worthy of the gospel. Lord, &gt;&gt; meet every need in divine presence. Let faith rise up to you this morning. We stand agreeing for every need. We want you to take control. We want to just pray that you would take divine control of this service. Take your servant and put your word in his mouth, Lord, &gt;&gt; and give us ears that would receive what the spirit wants to say to the church this morning. The spirit has a voice. The spirit wants to speak and we want to hear that voice Lord this morning. Give us a receiver we pray Lord as we commit this all to you now in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And you can have your seats. Neighbor family has a song for us this morning. If they could just come and get ready. Well, we do. Uh when I do, we want to just welcome everyone who's visiting with us. Got a special welcome this morning for uh Sister Jennifer Leonard from West Virginia who's uh the new school teacher for the uh Bible Way Academy. May we get her to stand so we see who you are. And glad to have you here. and uh sister uh Shelley Tatch's mom and sister are visiting with us. We're happy to have you here. Uh and uh get you to stand as well. Everybody knows who you are. Amen. Anyone else visiting? We just uh are happy to have you here this morning. We're we just trust you'd feel welcome. A couple of announcements. Um, the Sunday school is tentatively starting Sunday, September the 9th. So, I assume that's next Sunday, 9:45. They're going to confirm it on Wednesday. It's Brother Richard. Um, so, uh, show up, be ready to show up on Sunday, but, uh, um, young people's announcement, they're starting, young people's services are starting Friday night, September the 14th, and then they're continuing on the September the 28th. They will be the second and fourth Friday of each month. And those that are uh, welcome to attend are those that uh, at senior camp uh and then all the way up to 30 years old, but it's for singles. So, if you're married, you've got yourself out of the group. Amen. Amen. How how many people here are thankful for what the Lord's done for you over the past uh months and years? uh in the scriptures uh you read about 10 lepers that came to Jesus one day and only one of them came back and gave him thanks and uh I think that's not very good odds. So maybe you could we heard this song a while back and uh maybe you could just thank the Lord with us as we sing it. [Music] [Music] When I look around and see the good things he has done for me, well, I know I'm unworthy of them all. But his blessings he freely gives. I owe my whole life to him. I've got so much to thank him for. I've got so much to thank him for. So much &gt;&gt; to thank him for. You see, God has been so good to me. &gt;&gt; And when I think of what he's done and where he has brought me, I've got so much to thank him for. Well, sometimes along last way I kne and I stop and say thank you Lord for all you've been to me. Oh but when I reach heaven please let me once more. I've got so much to thank him for. &gt;&gt; I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see, God has been so good to me. And when I think of what he's done and where that he has brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. &gt;&gt; I want to thank him for letting me see this last day in time. And I know that my name is on the book for the sins they have been revealed any day now. My body change I'm going to feel. I've got so much to thank him for. &gt;&gt; I've got so much to thank him for. so much to praise him for. You see, God has been so good to me. &gt;&gt; And when I think of what he's done and where that he has brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. [Music] I want to thank him for letting me see this last day in time mystery. And I know that my name is on the book. &gt;&gt; For the seals, they have been revealed any day now. That body change we could feel. I've got so much to thank him for. I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see, God has been so good to me. [Music] And when I think of what he's done and where that he has brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. And when I think of what he's done and where that he has brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Mark. Family. That's a wonderful song. &gt;&gt; You're thankful. Man, the next song I had written down here was how can I say thanks. So we maybe we should sing it just before brother Ed comes for the things you have done for me. Things so undeserved. I mean all the things that the Lord does for us. We don't deserve it. Amen. It's his grace shown in our hearts. Amen. [Music] How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me [Music] so undeserved. Yet you gave to prove your love for me. The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude. [Music] All that I am and ever hope to be, I owe it all to thee. To God [Music] be the glory. To God be the glory. To God be the glory for the things he has done. With his blood he has saved me. And with his power he has raised me. Dear God [Music] for the things he has done. Just let me live my life. Let it be pleasing Lord to thee. And should I give any let it go to town glory with his blood. He has saved me and with his power he has great God [Music] for the things he has done. [Music] to God be the glory. To God be the glory to God. be a glory for the things he has done. With his blood he has saved me. And with his power he has me. [Music] Let's stand as we sing it again. To God be the glory. [Music] Be the glory [Music] to him. [Music] Be the glory for the things we have done. with his heart. He has [Music] to go [Music] &gt;&gt; for the things he has done. &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you Lord. Hallelujah. We give you glory. Alm mighty God. Hallelujah. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. We give you glory, oh God. You're our sufficient one. You're Jehovah Gyra. Our provider. Hallelujah. How you provided for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We praise your name Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise your name. Has he been a great provider for you? Maybe we could just sing that chorus also, brother. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. Jehovah Gyra. Let's hear your voices now. My pro. My profile. [Music] my healer. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Let it be Oh, now [Music] I need You are more than [Music] You are. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's our God. We love him &gt;&gt; more than that. He loves us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wouldn't do much good today if we only loved him. But he loves us. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he first loved us. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way we can love him. How wonderful. How wonderful. I so enjoyed the song that Mark and Elizabeth family sang. God bless them. Amen. It's a also a pleasure to hear that uh Sister Shell's mother, Sister Alice, is here. And uh we go back a long way, but I won't say how far back, but a lot of folks here probably don't know that Sister Shel's mother or sister Alice Grant is brother Neville's daughter. So, Now, you know, Brother Neville, I was pastor at the tabernacle for so many years as one of his three daughters. Amen. Good man. Three daughters. Real man. God bless you, sister. Well, it's wonderful to be back home. Amen. And uh uh we'll be saying a little bit about the services as we go along. But while you're standing, I'm going to have you turn in your Bibles because I want to go directly to the word and take my time in the word. And uh if you don't mind, we'll just uh be relaxed, take our time in the word. Amen. Sometimes it's not easy to convey what it is you want to bring. So, but if you take a little bit extra time, you you can be thinking about it while you, you know, with me as you move through the scripture. We'll turn in Isaiah to the book of Isaiah, the sixth chapter, and we're going to read from verses 1 down through 8. In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the saraphims. Each one had six wings. With twain he covered his face, with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts." And the whole earth is full of his glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts. Then flew one of the saraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the thong tongs from off the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who shall go for us?" Then said, "I here am I, Lord. Here am I, send me." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's wonderful process that's taken place there. We'll just have prayer once again before we begin the service. Almighty God, you're the one that has called. You're the one that has brought this great redemption about. And even as you said here to the prophet Isaiah, born a prophet, he could do nothing uh about it. He was called to that work. We are each one called to our place. We have a distinction, Lord, in your body, and that is that no one else can take our place. You've called each one of us and we're praying for your grace to be upon this entire congregation and all that are live streaming and all who will hear the service on the archives. May the same anointing and the same power, the same effect be upon them, Lord. And as you took the tongs and and touched the lips of the prophet and it is you that had declared now he was clean, now he was purged. Nothing to do with him. You did it all, Lord. We can say today, now we are clean. Hallelujah. Now we have been purged. Oh, the living stream of blood, oh God, has has cleansed us. And I pray that you'll now give us a divine revelation in your word in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint both speaker and hearers. I pray, Lord, as each of us are at our posts of duty. We thank you now, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. I want to thank you for your prayers while we were away and uh it uh certainly meant a great great deal to have your prayers. Uh we had we're in an outstanding time in Congo. what is taking place there is uh uh difficult to describe but we I want to say a little bit about it just in in the context of the service itself. So I want to take this uh subject and uh speak on the power of influence. Brother Brandham used this scripture and I'm going to refer also to that. He referred to it a number of times. I don't want you to think so much of this as a a a message or just a scripture text. But I believe that you would recognize that the written word, the word of God, that's God on written page, is actually in a divine order. It's not just a a scattering of thoughts. It's not just a scattering of men who wrote. There's a divine order to the way it's laid out in the Bible. Number two, when the word was made flesh in the body of Jesus Christ and walked here on earth, he walked by a divine order. He went to the well when he was supposed to go to the well. He saw the lepers when he was supposed to see them. He he he came at the precise moment when he was to be born. And he knew when he was coming to his crucifixion and his death, he set his face, the scripture says, towards Jerusalem. Everything happened in a divine precise order. You believe that? Now the spirit of this word, the spirit of this word that authorized it and and and it is the author. He is the author. Jesus said, "I Jesus, he he authored the book of Revelation, which is our book." Now if that be so then the revealing of this son of man, the revealing of this same person cannot be just haphazardly taking place. There has to be a divine order. And if God has brought and sent a prophet, a vindicated messenger to be able to speak it, then he spoke it in a divine order. And also also the choice of the scripture text came at the right time and in the right place. It's just for you and I to absorb that &gt;&gt; and I believe that's something that we need to really ponder very deeply. I with God's help I would like to uh bring the service into this type of a context so that your thought will be not only what the scripture text is and how we will build or bring out truth from that and how it will apply to you but how God brought it when he brought it and what is it that he's trying to convey to us by doing it in that special kind of a way. It's like a father maybe taking his son or daughter when they've got maybe 16 or 17 years old and and sit down and say, you know, uh time has come. I want to talk to you about some serious things. I want to talk to you about life. I want to talk to you about your future. I want to talk to you about your plans. I want to want to talk to you about your decisions because Now the time has come. They might say, "Oh, wow. You know, father never spoke to me like this before. This this is a special moment." And that's exactly the way that it is. And brother Brandham talked about influence. Now, just to uh I want to just get into uh this here. Maybe have you just bring it in from up there. This is what influences the meaning of influence is the process of producing modifications especially when slow or permanent. It is to exert or maintain a mental or moral power upon or over others. This is an influence. And then it is the flowing into I want you to really notice this one. It is the flowing into of power whether in the form of a motive or ability. And when God the anointing remember I spoke on the anointing and it is actually the pouring the word pouring all that God was he poured into Christ. But when he poured into Christ he also had a a motive and Christ also had the ability. He was given ability. You say well Christ was God. That's that is exactly correct. But also Jesus said I can do nothing except the father show me the father if he does it. What I see the father do I do what he saw the father do then he knew he was enabled to do it. Brother Brandham said about the visions he said I can't make it happen but if the vision comes he said if god gave him a vision told him George Washington was going to rise he said he called the world to see it. Why? because he knew it was going to happen. He he would know then if the vision came, he would know that God a had the motive to do it. Whatever the result is, he may not know, but God has a motive and God is going to give the ability to do it. See, when God called us to the life that you have right now in Christ, God had a motive &gt;&gt; and he's going to he's giving you the ability to produce what he's intended you to produce. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; So, it is an inflow. It's an inflowing of power whether it's in the form of motive or ability. And I say it's both in this case. Next slide, please. So the flowing into of power whether in former or motive. Now the scripture but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Now this uh for the Holy Ghost the Greek word is numa which is like wind the holy ghost and it is the influence which fills and governs the soul. It's the influence the holy spirit is the influence that fills and governs the soul. It is the efficient source not just partially efficient. It is efficient. the efficient source of any power, affection, emotion, or desire. So, anything that God puts within a person, Brother Brand talks about the desires that an individual has, you have those desires. You're living a godly life because God puts the desire there. And God has a motive for putting it there &gt;&gt; and he has the ability to produce it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, we'll just move from the slides just now. I don't want to go any further with the slides. So, if your brothers will hold it, please, and just give us the the lights once again. Now, it's impossible for us to trace the effect of influence. Just impossible. We can't possibly see the ripple effect of it. Uh, brother Brandham talked about uh living after the first lady's example, the first lady of America, the president's wife, living after her example. In other words, he's saying that her example, maybe the way she does her hair or the way she dress, who can she'll put on one hat or have her hair cut a certain way and then it's just it just ripples throughout the entire population. You can't you can't pull it back and there's no way to determine the effect or the power of that influence. But it's it's gone. Brother Brandon makes reference to the living people living after the first lady's example. He said like a lot of us Pentecostal people do as he was saying at that time because he was talking to a Pentecostal group. He spoke about the Beatles and the influence of those renegades. The first reference that I can find that he made concerning the Beatles. Now you might a lot of young people say, "Oh, well I'm way back in history." Well, I'll just tell you the effect of them is not back in history. The effect of them still here today &gt;&gt; very very much alive because it's not it's not men, it's spirits. &gt;&gt; It's not just spirits, it's demon spirits. And they've gotten into every form of entertainment, every form of music, every form of of activity. and they're very very much uh the effect of the influence of them. It's impossible to determine the amount of it. One man who uh is a he's a a fundamental Christian, he he said this on February the 9th, 1964, the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show and captivated the youth of America. after hearing their music. Now if you can just see that the fourth dimension of the ether waves and the radio waves and now the television which has become visual and become so much more powerful because now it had become visual. Don't worry, Satan knew what he was doing. He brought the theater right into the home. See? And so now he's using it because 80% of your knowledge that you retain comes through the eye gate and 20% through the hearing. So you're hearing right now, but visually you have to remember Satan uses the visual, the things you see in the stores and the shops and the color and all of the things and the design and and the things that are, you know, designed to enchant the population. Satan had a a purpose. He had a motive in presenting these young men at that particular time. And he says after hearing their music and seeing their look and seeing their look, he says, "I did what millions of young American boys did. I I begged my parents to let me grow my hair." And so he just saw them on a Ed Sullivan television show. And now here's just one youth from a good Christian home. He's wanting immediately to have that hairstyle. Now Satan has communicated to him something and feeding a desire in his heart to do the same thing and to look the same and act the same. Well, it's still with us today. Whether you see it in a magazine or whether you see it on your on your computer, it doesn't make any difference where you see it or you see your peer, you see your friend, you see your the young lady that you uh you young ladies are with or your young fellows that you're with and you see them do it and you think, "Yeah, that's kind of cool." And then you start imitating that, but you're following the tracks of a spirit. And so he asked his parents to let him grow his hair. And then he says, "Along with my best friend Tommy, I started a garage band." The Beatles performance had such an impact on us that we intentionally tried to be like them. It was a significant introduction to the power of influence. And I never got my title from this after God gave me the title power of influence. I just was doing some research on it and found people very very much affected by influence. He said years later the power of influence came to mean something far more significant to me as I began my journey as a follower of Christ. I had the desire to live under the influence of Christ. But I also wanted to be an influence on others pointing them to the savior. So now we want to think about two things. We want to think about the who might be influencing us and who we may be influencing and the one who's influencing us where who is influencing them. &gt;&gt; So you say this person is really influencing me. Where is that person getting their influence? Because whoever wherever the source is, you got to trace it back to the source. Wherever they're being influenced from, that's what's influencing you. And you're just going to be a conduit to influence somebody else. And once the influence is gone, you can't pull it back. You can't say, "Oh, I'm sorry." You know, that is the influence. We do influence somebody. You are influencing somebody. &gt;&gt; Here's just a few quotes. He said, "Do you realize being a son or daughter of God that you are a minor creator? Do you know that you create the atmosphere and you live in it? Do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in, you influence somebody else?" So whatever atmosphere a person lives in, if you live in a you know a grumbling atmosphere or if you live in a gossip atmosphere, if you live live in a victorious atmosphere, you live in a you know a a peaceful atmosphere, people will see that and they're influenced by it and you're create you create your own. Don't don't think now well I'm just preaching and it has nothing to do with you. It has very much to do with you because a messenger prophet messenger said this is the conditions of this age &gt;&gt; and we are each one creating our own atmosphere and influencing somebody by that atmosphere. In the message influences, he said, "Especially you people who are claiming to be Christians, separate yourself from the things of the world. Have nothing to do with the world. Shun it." You might say, "Well, what is the world?" Well, I would sure pray about it. If the prophet says, "Shun it," then I would say we ought to pray. Pray about it and say, "What is it, Lord?" And then I want to shun it. Give me a give me a sensitivity. give me make me sensitive because I can't always tell where did this influence I oh I that's really appealing well who made it appealing where did it come from &gt;&gt; that's a good thing to ask ourselves young people where did this originate is this something that came out of a holy God is this something that came flowing out of eternity is this something that came to uh do something that is a positive thing for me in my spiritual life and that's the thing we want to ask. He said have nothing to do with it. Shun it. He said for some person is watching you. There isn't one individual within the sound of my voice or in this building. But what this holds true to you for parents, your children, your where you work, you're a student, someone who's next to you. I tell you what, I've been around enough of the students that have graduated and years and years later gone back to a gathering at the school and uh I I know when the girls go back, I always hear accounts and someone walks up and they're, you know, their whole demeanor has changed and their shape has changed and they've lost their hair and a big, you know, overweight some of them and come walking up And you know I what Joanne was telling me I and she couldn't recognize you remember me? No I don't remember you. Well I'm so and so. You're what? I can't believe that. Yeah. And they want to know are you still the same? You still religious? &gt;&gt; And they find out that that even back then 25 years ago it left an impact &gt;&gt; and it left an influence. &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile? Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile to influence somebody? Let it go. &gt;&gt; Let that influence ripple out. &gt;&gt; Let it testify of Christ. You're only walking this way once. You might as well do it good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Might as well burn it up. You won't be able to burn it up the second time. You can't go back and say, "Oh, I like to redo that. I like to relive that." We can't. So, we might as well do it now. Just resolve in our heart. I'm going to be an influence for God. gonna be an influence for holiness. Gonna say something, do something, but be an influence. &gt;&gt; Some person's watching you. Somebody's watching you. He said, "And you're going to not only stand yourself there, but going to take them to the bad place." Talking about a bad influence. And you're going to have to answer for your influence. Now, let's just turn the look at the other side of the coin. You're going to stand there. Do you think that there's a possibility? You're going to stand there and see someone else standing there. Have them look. You think that this is I'm I'm You think this is just a myth? You think this is just dreaming? to have someone else stand there and saying the effect of your life, the effect, the influence that you had on my life is what gave me such a desire to turn my life over and to be here. Uh when I saw God do for you, that encouraged me &gt;&gt; influence. Just just just one more. He said, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Let me humble my pride." Now he starts to quote the words of an old song. "Let me humble my pride and call on his name. Let me wait, Lord. If you will if you will never do no more than uh for me than save me, that's what I want." So he said, "If you don't do anything more for me, then save me." He said, "That's what I want. If you have need for me, show me. And so that I'll know and then I'll go. But you tell me first, I'm here, your servant. He says, do that and your influence will be great. &gt;&gt; No, you don't have to be a preacher to be an influence. You don't have to have you don't have to be highly visible in a congregation to have an influence. There's every single person here from the youngest to the eldest, from the strongest to the weakest, you're having an influence. You're influencing somebody. Sometime people feel strong. They say, "Well, I'm strong. I can I can handle it." But maybe you're influencing somebody who can't handle it. This is the beginning of school this next week. And I hear brother Brandham saying this. He addresses you young ladies first. Oh young lady, you might not live that kind of a life, but oh, if you could only meet this one I'm talking about, what your influence will be to your classmates. young man like Saul, educated, smart, what an influence he was to the whole Christian world. He was sent as an apostle to the Gentiles. When he met his when he met this Jesus in the pillar of fire that day, knowing that that was the same God that brought his people out of Israel, out of Egypt, Israel out of Egypt, he said, "You could meet this you could meet the same God. That's either a lie or it's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's not just some hysterical statement. You can meet the same God. &gt;&gt; You know, the reason that we don't really meet him the way we would like to meet him is because we do not approach him the way that people have approached him. I looked at the words when when Isaiah when he saw that God he saw this experience that he was entering into. And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but he said, "Wo, woe is me." And I began to look into the Hebrew of what it meant when a man would say, "Woe." It's like saying, "I'm hopeless. I'm undone. I I I'm I'm nothing. Whoa, it's me." It's like all is lost. It's like I've come to the end. Where's an answer? when he saw the holiness of God and saw saraphims who even covered their eyes and covered their feet and and with their wings. When he saw that holiness and only could hear, "Holy, holy, holy." And the other answered, "Holy, holy, holy," he said, "Whoa is me." &gt;&gt; That's what was giving him entrance into the into the holiness of God when he realized his condition. And that's the way we need to. We can't feel that we're strong. We're self-sufficient. We're self reliant. We're capable of handling ourselves. You're not. You need to come to the place we say, "Woe is me, oh God. I can do nothing for my I cannot lift myself up. I cannot conduct my own affairs. I need you. I need the Holy Spirit. I need that power. I need that dunamis." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need that breath of God. See, we need to get desperate about things. Then you begin to have an answer. He said, "You'll influence your schoolmates and how Saul was educated, but he had met God." He said, "You can meet the same God." That's the Bible manifested proving that he is God. the vindication of him right on earth now that his work is made known for he's the same yesterday today and forever. What an influence you'll be to your church to this congregation. This paragraph is absolutely true. What an influence you'll be to the church, to your community, to the entire everybody you come in contact with. You'll be a changed person. Listen, every person, I want your attention. There isn't a person here that does not need to be an influence. We need to be an influence. The people around you are depending on it. Your friends are depending on it. You got somebody here say that's my friend. You have a responsibility to be an influence. Move them. Do everything you can in all of your action and all of your words and all of your conduct to influence them husband to wife and wife to husband. Influence them to parents to children and even young people to their parents. But you can be an influence in the home. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Decide on that. Now say, I'm going to listen to the rest of the service. I'm going to anchor that in my heart. I'm going to I'm going to make that a purpose and make that a resolve. I can't do within myself, but oh God, &gt;&gt; cause me to be an influence &gt;&gt; to affect people. I only have this one life. You're living another day out right now. Only have this one life. We want to be an influence. When the prophet Isaiah this experience greatly transformed him. He brother Brand said the effects of the vision on the prophet what it did do to this man who was born a prophet. He said remember he wrote the entire Bible. See now that have such an effect on him. Isaiah wrote the entire Bible in that it has 66 books as the Bible has has 66 chapters as the Bible has 66 books and it starts out like Genesis. He said in the middle of the book comes the New Testament and John the Baptist is spoken of in Isaiah and it ends up over in the millennium. great prophet. One of the greatest of the prophets said we ever had was Isaiah. And when he stood in the presence of God, what did it cause the prophet to do? The prophet said, "Woe is me, for I'm a man of unclean lips." To come into the presence of God and see a truly anointed vessel of God. It caused the prophet to confess that he was a sinner. It ought to do us that way. the anointed presence of God. When he seen that and the crying and the post, the post of the doors shaking and these angels going back and forth, proving they were before God and they were the servants of God, anointed, and he cried out he was a sinner. Now, Brother Brandham spoke from this text several times. I'm coming to a very very important point and I want you to really pinch your conscience and your thoughts now. He spoke from this passage, this very scripture several times and I believe that there was as I said earlier there was an order and I I felt an impulse to look at this order. I spent quite a bit of time and I was pondering it very very deeply. on on December the 30th of 1962. This is a a milestone moment in brother Brandham's life when he preaches sers. Is this the time he actually there's several titles that he gives uh to that and I think we can put that up if you like. Uh he called it sers. Is this the is is this the sign of the end? Sir, what time is it? And what is the time? Can you take that off, please? And In this message, he relates now in vision form the meeting of the seven angels. Now, this is December the 30th, 1962. And this is these are a few comments that he made which I've just selected for you so that you can get a a grasp this morning and a feeling. And I pray that you'll be able to absorb the event that he was going through. Because here's the whole context. What kind of influence was God bringing him under? And what was the purpose of that influence? And next, and even more important, am I being sufficiently affected and influenced by the influence he was under? &gt;&gt; Got it? He said, "And as soon as they left," speaking of this constellation, not of the angels now, but he saw little birds, little warriors like in a tree and they're jumping back and forth. And he says, "And then they left and they went eastward." He says, "Then a constellation of larger birds because he's talking about the first, second, and third pull of his ministry." his ministry in three phases as Jesus also did. He said uh they look like doves, sharp pointed wings, kind of gray color, a little lighter color than what these first little messengers were. And they were coming eastward swiftly. And no sooner than they got out of my sight, I turned again to look westward. And there it happened. There was a blast that actually shook the whole earth. Now I said I now don't miss this. And you on tape. You be sure and get this right. First a blast. He says, "But it shook the earth. And when it did, I was still looking westward and way off into eternity, I saw a constellation of something coming. uh it looked like it might have been little dots. They could have been no less than five and not more than seven. If you read standing in the gap, he speaks about five and he describes it and so on. But listen what he says here. No less than five and no more than seven. But they were in a strange they were in a shape of a pyramid like these messengers coming. And when it did, the power of Almighty God lifted me up to meet them. And I can see it. I It's It's never left me. Eight days has gone by. Now, he's telling this one week later. Eight days has gone by and I can't forget it yet. I never had anything to bother me like this, like this has. Now, now listen. We're talking about the most phenomenal ministry that has struck the earth. and ministered for 33 years. But now he's he's uh he's he's identifying this as something that is very remarkable for himself. It's bothered him and he hasn't been able to even I'll speak a little later. He he said, "I didn't even minister. I didn't want to minister." He never had come to a time like this. He had never had an experience like this. Isaiah had never had an experience like he had. And that transformed his life to be the kind of prophet he needed to be because of what he was being ordained to do. Eight days have gone by. He says, "And I could see those angels, those shaped back wings traveling faster than sound could travel." He says, "And they came from the eternity in a split. I mean, &gt;&gt; oh my God, to see these mighty angels coming from eternity in a split. He said, like in a twinkling of an eye, not enough to bat your eye, just twinkle. And there they were. He said, I didn't have time to count. He said it was no less than five and no more than seven. But he said, I and I've had critics rise up and say, well, they preached a whole message. said it was five and four, two on each side, one at the top, and describes the whole thing. Oh, he just he's false. They think that that's false. He I'd like to have taken that fellow and put him in the presence of just one of those angels. And I think he'd be graveling on the ground. He wouldn't know if there was one or if there was a hundred. &gt;&gt; You don't even hardly know your own name. In the presence of that holy we poor humans creeping around on the brittle threads of life. What what can we know about this kind of a experience this kind of visitation? I couldn't even count he said and they came like in a split. I didn't have time to count. He said I didn't have time no more than just to look. mighty ones, a powerful angel, snow white, wings set in the head, and they were, he said to like, he said, I was caught up into the pyramid of the constellation. And I thought, now is it it? He said, I was numbed all over. And I said, oh my, this means that there will be a blast that will kill me. I'm I'm at the end of my life now. And then he he continues on. He said that Lord God, what does this vision mean? And I wondered and then and then it came to me. Not a voice just came to me. Oh, that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new men, my new commission. And when I thought that, I raised up my hands and said, "Oh Lord Jesus, what will you have me to do?" Exactly. Isaiah when he came to think when he saw that saw that in manifestation oh send me Lord I'll go &gt;&gt; what will you have me to do and the vision left and for almost an hour I couldn't feel he said it feels like a reverent fear I was so scared till I was paralyzed in the presence of those beings I tell you the truth He said, "As Paul said, I lie not. You never caught me saying anything wrong about something like that. Something's fixing to happen." He said, "I found myself somewhere over in a corner and I had a I had a Bible open and it was reading." He said, "I don't know, but it was in I believe Romans the 9th chapter. the last verse. Now see even that I can have this open. I have the my Bible. I'm opening it now here. I'm at Romans and I'm at Romans the 9th chapter. But that wasn't all. If you open your Bibles to Romans the 9th chapter, it doesn't open to a verse. But now it's open to a verse. &gt;&gt; You see the Bible, his Bible is open, but he that this this influence, this powerful effect he was under was so specific. It wasn't just that the Bible was open, he's just even drawing it from memory now, eight days later, but it was open to a certain verse. And the verse is, as it is written, behold, attention, I, Almighty God, lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense. And whosoever believeth on him, not it. &gt;&gt; A stone could be it, but this stone is a himymn. &gt;&gt; This stone is Christ. And this whole vision and the coming of the angels is announcing to his own servant, his prophet messenger who is the valid the one who who's who's validated to be able to speak the opening of the seals. He's telling him, I'm laying in Zion. This whole thing happened because I am laying in Zion a stone. It's a stone of offense, a rock of offense. And whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. He says, "And I thought it's strange that I be reading that." He said, "The spirit still packing me in the room." And I closed the Bible and stood there. I went over to the window. It was about 10:00 in the day or better. And I raised my hands and I said, "Lord God, I don't understand. This is a strange day to me and I'm beside myself almost." And I said, "Lord, what does that mean?" This next slide, please. Three months before this event, Brother Brandham took this text and he preached in his presence. And then two months before he took the text again and preached on the influence of another. And then he preached on influence four times in 1963 which is the year that of the preaching of the seals and two times in 1964. He may have read the text after. I haven't researched all of that but he took influence. And now I want you to before I go any further, I would like you to see here's here's December. You can take that off now, please. Here's December the 30th in this incredible experience. two months before and three months before he's directed. In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and the saraphims came in such reverence and such fear and that that is coming now before then he has this experience and he reads serves as this the time he takes Revelation 10 the opening of the book that it will be open And that is such a sacred thing to almighty God. And he's confirming it to him. And even after the experience, he's saying, "I don't know what it means." But he's chosen now. He's directed to choose Revelation 10 1-7 for sers, is this the time? Saying, "Is this the time?" He's asking, "Is this the time for this to happen?" And now he's it's almost like a preparation work. And he's he's spoken in the year King Uzziah died, he saw the Lord high and lifted up. Then two months before and then he he steps into this experience. Then immediately in January, he speaks influence again because there's something that's taking place. And then uh three more times in 63 he takes influence and then uh two more times it's like it's like the opening of the seals is caught in a vortex of him speaking the influence because I will say this brother Brandham's entire ministry was transformed from that time &gt;&gt; and the proph prophet that you know became the prophet who he was because of that experience &gt;&gt; and the meeting of those angels in reality. Now we're just sitting here in a service and you're trying to assimilate. I pray that God will give you not the mental powers but give you spiritual power to be able to open your heart and to grasp what God has done in this. I challenge any person to show me wherever anything like this ever happened. People claim it, people profess it, but then to have a to have that vessel stand at the platform and begin to relate the very secrets of the hearts of the people one after the other after the other. I just listened while I was away and he's in Chicago and he preaches and he begins he calls up one person. You can hear it. He calls out another person and and calls out I think about a third person and then he points down to a woman. Points down to a woman that's on a stretcher and he says you're paralyzed. Says you're a paralytic. He said if if I were you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up off that c. He says there she is. Someone just give her a hand. Give her a little hand. And she gets up and the audience just becomes totally electrified. just a roar. He said, "There's another one." Another one gets up. He says, "There's a man getting out of a wheelchair and the place just goes wave after wave." He says, "Here's a man on the platform." He's come up on the platform. There are people who couldn't walk. People are paralyzed. That's the kind of proof that come behind this ministry. And he says, "I lie not. I tell you the truth." &gt;&gt; Then I say amen to that. &gt;&gt; That paralytic woman, she'd say, "That is the truth. There's the secret of your heart. That is the truth. &gt;&gt; We sat in the meetings. We give testimony to it. This is not just, you know, some flash in the pan or some pie in the sky. This is something that God did. It was a holy, holy thing that God has done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm standing here today. I'm not here to preach a service. I'm here to tell you what God is dealing with my own heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God is requiring even more out of this congregation, more consecration, more dedication. He's expecting it out of us for the things that he's made known to us. He said now on March the 17th, we've just gone from December 30th, January, February, March 17th, and he's speaking the breach. He just coming to the seals. I have the seals book with me here. So, he just coming now. preaches God in simplicity and then the breach because the breach is that segment that portion that's between the church ages if I had the church ages here is between the church ages and the seals and for those of you that are just perhaps newer visiting prophet of God said things about the seals he never said about the church ages the church the church is always a woman and is always in the feminine gender So the church ages, ages are time. So that was the woman's time. So down from when uh when the Holy Spirit came down into the church on the day of Pentecost, the church was born as a young woman, as a young girl, and then comes up all through the ages. And God takes an elect out and a left out. And it keeps moving down to about 2,000 years. Then the end time, the last messenger comes. He's not a reformer, but he has to be a prophet. And the reason he has to be a prophet is for this very reason &gt;&gt; to be able to speak the contents of a sealed book where people have probed. Do they go through the tribulation? No. One argues yes, they do go through the tribulation. Next one says, "No, we don't go through the tribulation." Next one says we go halfway up in the halfway through the tribulation. We go in the rapture. Well, it's three. How long's the tribulation? It's three and a half years. No, it's seven years. It's this that. How do you baptize? Well, hey, you should go down three times forward and three times backward or in the trinity or this or that or one or just the name of Jesus. Just a total mass of confusion, just a kaibos. We needed thus sayaith the Lord. And here's the proof of it. So, it could all be settled. And we have an absolute. &gt;&gt; And if you don't take the absolute, that's up to you. But when God confirmed it, God's going to call you up short one day and make you answer. I spoke. You heard it. You've read it. You You had it available. You said, "I I I never heard it." What do you mean? 1100 tapes and you never heard it. &gt;&gt; I gave I I allowed a I allowed the whole civilization to become advanced and to tap into my laboratory and you never heard it. &gt;&gt; All right, young people. Here I am. I'm laying a challenge to you. Never heard it. sent the greatest wave across the across the history. I was reading I I pulled up from a voice of healing magazine that was on the web. I did never knew it was there but I just Brother Brandham mentioned a certain man certain minister. So I just typed it in and his name came up in the Voice of Healing magazine which I have several of them original voice of healing magazines but brother Brandham is is named in there as as one of the associate editors. He's not an editor, but he was a a contributor and many people contributed. And so then I looked at the the announcements for the special meetings. Oh my goodness. I thought I knew everybody. I didn't know any more than half of them and just names of and having meeting in this this city and that city and in England and all over all over the country. just lists of the names and pictures of AA Allen's tent and maybe 15 20 30,000 people in it and Oral Roberts was there and Gardner and WV Grant and Tommy Osborne and Tommy Hicks and on and on and on and Jaggers and all these names just dozens of these men all listed up and then you see say where is it now with all this wave &gt;&gt; where's the influence of these men now where's the voice and this club foot being healed and pictures of it, this being healed and that one being healed. Those were great things. But the prophet says, "If there isn't a voice behind the sign," he said something else, forget it. &gt;&gt; Forget it. If there isn't a voice behind the sign, forget it. But I would say, if there is a voice behind the sign, remember it. not forget it. Not lay it aside. Not let not be casual with it. But what does it say to you? &gt;&gt; There isn't a man or woman, not a person here. But what are you going to stand before God someday? And you know what you'll see? God's not going to come with a great big finger down. &gt;&gt; You're going to see yourself sitting in this service. Your mental powers will be so clear, you'll remember exactly where you sat. Your mental powers will be so clear, you'll remember exactly what I preached. And you'll hear this voice again say, "You're going to be called before God and give answer for this service. What influence are you under?" I'm thinking now of this happening that actually took place. Now on March the 17th, brother Brandham begins to speak on the breach and he refers back to December the 30th. This is just March. See a tremendous amount happened just two three months on this side and two three months on this side and this is caught in the vortex of it. So he refers back and he asks the people now he's just he's just about two and a half months later and he asks the people how many in here has read what time is it sir or has heard it you know what time is it sir said that's bothered me quite a bit if you haven't I wish some way if you could get to hear it or some way kind of bothered me. He said, "I just wanted to drop this before starting the service about a week or 10 days ago. I was so disturbed. I just wouldn't take services or anything because I didn't know." I'm bringing you to I'm bringing to you a a a real tight period of time when the prophet is speaking influence. One man's influence serves as this time right after influence. Influence the opening of the seals and a couple more times influence. I would say without being a very very intelligent man that God who put this Bible in its order and who caused Jesus Christ and lived in him, God was in Christ, God walking in a certain fashion, meeting a Nathaniel, meeting a disciples, he met them at exactly the right moment, in the right exactly the precise this moment in time and had the effect upon their lives and others looked on him when he did certain things. They said, "Belabove." He just looked at them. They'll hear their own words one day standing in that holy presence. And that same God, then they came to Luke 17:30. Jesus standing here on the earth saying to people who knew well about Sodom and Gomorrah, knew well about the days of Noah. Said, "As it was in the days of Noah, they builded and they planted and they were economically prospering." Very much describes today. Said that's the way it was and that's the way it will be when the son of man is revealed. And as it was in the days of Sodom, the revealing of Christ himself, God himself in a body of flesh to Abraham his his elected saint, telling him, and giving of the secret of his wife's heart, and saying, I, personal pronoun, shall surely return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Amen. &gt;&gt; And two servants go to Sodom said, "Even thus will it be in the day when the son of man is revealed." Now we have the vessel on earth revealing the son of man. Everything coming in its divine order. And I say to you, brother Brandham went to Isaiah the 6th chapter at the precisely the time he was supposed to. He preached it and said what he was supposed to say. He came to it again. He came to it again. Came to it again and just sandwiched the seals in between there. Why? Because now is a servant of God. This uh prophet messenger being impacted, influenced, influenced. Are you following me? And it went then a spoken word and out of his mouth and onto tapes and so on. And it began to ripple out and it found you someplace some way somehow. It found you. And it meant maybe nothing to the person next to you or to someone else in the family, but it found you. And when it when that influence when that impulse and that effect come and struck your soul said, "Oh my God. This is none other than God himself. This is the revealed Christ. This is the word." And people tried to talk you out of it. And he said, "You can't talk me out of it. It's already in me. It's already alive. It's a part of my being. It's a part of my whole spiritual lif stream. No way to talk yourself or be talked out of that. &gt;&gt; Said one early morning I got up to go into Sabina Canyon. This is at the same time eight or 10 days before this. So I say it's the first week of March which from the house is only about 30 minutes drive or 40 to the head of Sabina Canyon. I just clear something up. I can so relate to this because I lived just 30 40 minutes all my young manhood 30 40 minutes from hunting and on I had to work till Wednesday noon in the store. Wednesday afternoon it was store was closed so I just borrowed a gun. It wasn't even my own. I just threw it in the back of the car and drove my car out in the country and and shot my first deer. Come back. I was at work the next morning. Next Wednesday, you know, or Wednesday or two later, threw the gun in the back of the car again, drove another 20 miles. It only took me less than 30 minutes. Drove out there. It had snowed the night before. And within within probably 30 minutes or so, I had a moose. My first moose. I was 16. I had my first moose now. I wish I'd had some of you young fellas there. I said, "Now what? Now what do I do?" People say, "Well, Brother Brandham wasn't out in the desert on the 28th because he was in he was in Houston on March the 4th and preached and said, "After I got back when I got back from Houston, I went out hunting with the brothers in uh uh and with brother Sothman and so on." And brother Sothman was there during this time. What is the big deal? 30 40 minute drive. So he's up there in February and March the 4th he had to fly to Houston to intercede for that boy on death row and comes back after and goes up again. That's nothing. I understand that perfectly. They did all the time. Throw the gun on the back and drive up and go hunting with the brothers 20 30 minutes away at and and people make a great big issue and try to figure that out. I'll tell you what, the prophet said he was caught up in that constellation of angels. And I don't care how people put the time or anything else. He said this, "I tell you the truth and I lie not." That's that does it for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And furthermore, what happens after that is this book, this book that's been so disputed, this book that has been so confusing, now a life comes out of it. &gt;&gt; And I feel an impact of a of a influence. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, congregation. What a privileged people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are. think that God would take one man and put him into such a situation to impact him just till he's numb while he knows who he is or where he is and to give him that uh uh bring him into that atmosphere of holy angels and then to sit eight days and have them come one after the other one after the other because I say eight days because he spoke also the questions and answers ers and here they come and and opening he said tomorrow night seal I don't know what it is he said another time he said I would have made the most horrible mistake until he came &gt;&gt; he came that was the very Christ he was revealing came and and open what the seal was &gt;&gt; you know for those of you that haven't thought about it this book right here happens to be 579 pages 579 pages. And when he got to the end of it, he just said second from last paragraph, he said, "I can truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the revelation, the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord." Amen. You &gt;&gt; know, he preached he he preached he preached uh influence several times. So as we would see Jesus and different things when he was done with this 579 pages. He never went back and enlarged on any one of the subjects. He never went back and tried to correct. Can you imagine a 579 page book? I challenge any theologian. I challenge the smartest man in the earth to to to speak in public for 579 pages and send it to the press and say it's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; We had about 5,000 people in India and we were in the Baptist compound and the this whole section right here was all Baptist theologians all in their long robes and I made that exact statement to them. I said, "Which theologian?" And I said, "We we've got a book here and there's a million books." One million books in the University of British Columbia theological department. I understand one million books. I said, "There's not one book in that in that million that compares with this book." I said, "To think that a man speaks publicly 579 pages and then puts it to press and doesn't change one thing, doesn't change one sentence, doesn't correct it, say, "I'd like to I'd like to refine that a little bit." That's a book you ought to read. That's a book that you can study. That's a book that that's a book that God intended to impact your life, your home, your entire future, &gt;&gt; a holy God, &gt;&gt; and I'll say it, yes. A holy prophet &gt;&gt; and a holy people &gt;&gt; to change us and to affect us. &gt;&gt; We're to We've come under a an incredible influence. went up into the canyon. Can I just take a few more minutes, please? &gt;&gt; He said, climbed as high as I could go. And I asked the Lord while sitting up there, "What all this meant?" He's still asking, "What does all this mean?" I was kind of bothered and I didn't know just what to do. And I was standing there in prayer and something happened. And now he said something fell in my hand. But something struck in my hand. &gt;&gt; And when I looked, it was a sword. And while holding it in my hand, a voice from somewhere said, "That's the king's sword." And then it left me. He said, "Now if it said a king's sword," he said, "I could have better understood that." said, "This is the king's sword. &gt;&gt; This is the word of Almighty God." Now comes a sword is for opening. Now comes the opening of God's word. The secret which he's held in the brief just a little further on said, "I'm not just making that up. That's thus say the Lord. I read it to you out of the book. &gt;&gt; The sounding of the seventh angel's message, the mystery of God should be finished. That's been declared by his holy prophets. That's the prophets who gave who have wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age, the last church age. All the loose ends that through these ages, church ages have been probed probed at will be wound up together. Just listen closely now. And when the seals are broken and the mystery is revealed, down comes And when the seals are broken and the mystery is revealed, down comes the angel, the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head. Now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have lived. &gt;&gt; Many of you people have lived &gt;&gt; and you didn't know it, but Christ himself &gt;&gt; came down and set one foot on the land and one foot on the sea. Hallelujah. And had a mouthpiece cuz he wasn't coming into a human vessel, but he had a mouthpiece that he could that he would come to and speak his word through that mouth. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; You've lived. &gt;&gt; You've happened to live in that time. God's going to ask you. He's going to actually ask you, going to ask every one of you, what did you do? What did you do with that? You had a you have confidence in. There's something in the atmosphere of the church that causes you to come and I like to go to Bible way. Why do you like to go to Bible way? It's nothing with the name. Nothing special. All kinds of churches, bigger churches, finer churches, better singing, better preaching, all the rest of it. Why do you come? God's going to ask you. You through the doors and that's what you heard. I was trying to influence you. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to influence you on things that really matter. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to influence you on things that are above these things that are down here. &gt;&gt; Don't be consumed. Don't be consumed with all of this riff raff because it's going to go on forever. I just say, "When is it going to stop?" It's not going to stop. It's going to carry on. How long is sin? Sin's going to go on until God is done with it. &gt;&gt; When am I going to have my bills all settled? When am I going to have When's this all going to When am I going to be out of pressure? You're never going to be out of pressure as long as you live down here. But I can tell you one thing. There's an influence that God has poured down into the church. &gt;&gt; I just came from Congo. You can write it off to however you wish to interpret it. The Congo has vacasillated between number one poorest nation to number three poorest nation. And you from the Congo, you forgive me, but I want to relate it. You drive along and there's just multitudes of people, just sea of people, many millions of people, maybe up to 10 million people in the kinshasa. And you go along and there's little rivlets of water and people picking through the scraps of paper. Boys like you fellas here picking through the scraps of paper and trying to find maybe a piece of plastic or something. You see somebody with an old tire. An old tire would mean nothing to anybody here, but they'll sit beside that tire and hope that they can find somebody to buy that tire. And then the next person is carrying a bunch of eggs on their head. They're trying to make a living. And then come the traffic was terrible. The traffic was gridlock. And the air and the pollution in the air is just it's a fog. And we come to the church. I walked into brother Dio's church just from the last three years. I think it was three years ago we were there at the opening and they had to extend it. They just took this wall out and put roof over it and made the church about 50% larger. They were seating 4,400 people before they put that out and the balcony went about halfway because it was the old balcony went all the way around like that. And I I walked into because the meetings were already in progress. There isn't even any space. There isn't they're not sitting like you are here. They're packed shouldertosh shoulder and it's just a sea of black faces. And I I tried to look from where I was sitting and he had to take the platform and he two nights before I the meeting started two nights before he had several hundred men and they removed the entire platform, smashed it out, smashed the wall out, moved it back and built some rooms on behind and finished it in just on Friday night in time for the meeting. And he thinks they maybe had a thousand men working. It was all done like in two days. and marble. They had marble on the wall and did an excellent job. And I sat on this new platform back there and I looked over to the far corner. I said, "That is that is further than a ball stadium. That's further than a football field." And you just can't even hardly make out the faces at the other end. And then at that time, three years ago, four years ago, was 1,576 ministers. 1,576 ministers. And they didn't even have an actual count this time, but there was around 2,700 ministers, coming right on to 3,000 ministers. I felt numb. I felt numb. I feel sorry for Canada and I feel sorry for the United States. We're under the curse of soft living. Those people have to walk so far and they're nicely dressed and they're clean. And when you come and they had young men and young ladies and young men in white shirts, dark trousers and a red tie and at the stadium went to the national stadium on on Saturday night. And I tried to count the attendance, just the attendance, men and women, a man, a woman, a man, a woman, a man, a woman. And I counted, as far as I could see, I counted just under 200, all young men, young ladies. Man, it just felt like heaven. I thought this is just like in heaven. And then the massive crowd they just kept flowing in flowing in and rivlets and taking their seats till in this stadium which seats 60,000 people from over here to over here was all full of people and they began to sing. Then they would have some that led in songs and their worship was heavenly. They sang in every service. Nearer my God to thee. They sang it so slow I could barely sing with them. Nearer my God to thee. Nearer to thee. You should have heard 15,000 voices. I felt like I was in heaven. Just to hear that lifting up to God. I got home and I said three years ago was 1500 ministers. Now it's 2700 ministers. every night. There wasn't even a space in the building. They said it was seating 10,000 people. You should have seen them come in trucks and vans and but they said the doors open at 8:30 tomorrow morning. The meeting would end at 2 in the afternoon and then they said the service starts at 5 tonight. I don't know where the people are even going to go. don't even know where they're going to begin to eat. But you got five at night. That place you can't even find a space to sit. 10,000 people night after night after night after night and day after day after day. I'm I'm closing now. Few minutes. I said, "You know what did this?" God directed me back to this scripture influence. This one little man, Brother Deio, God bless him. And he's he's not taken up with just he couldn't even begin to talk to the people about their marital problems or about their children or raising their families or anything else. He's got he he's got one focus and that focus is get this message into the hands of the people. And as I sat in the stadium then I saw these young men. I saw lines of them carrying something and they're walking way up in the balconies and one right behind the other like a whole army and they were carrying boxes and I knew right away they're carrying message books. And there's a row over there and there's a row over here packing these message books up because there was maybe maybe thousands of people that knew nothing about the message and brother Dio got up and preached and I was really proud of him. He had ministers from all over all those preachers but he stood up there and preachers from overseas and he stood up there and preached that entire service. I just said God bless him. And he laid out the message and the messenger of this age and like like just it was absolutely perfection. And then he said, "Now we have books. We have the message in a book for you and you must take a book. Please take a book and find out these things are not true. You the books are ready for you." And he told that whole mass of people. And I tell you what, it was no it's no mystery. It's no secret that's that's that's how come Congo's under such an effect. They've made the message and I am I'm dedicated. That's been that's been the call of my heart ever since a young man and since I came in contact with the message is get this message into the hands of the people that want it, into the hands of the people that are hungry. Hallelujah. Brother Tovi, your father spoke a message. He spoke a masterpiece. Brother Caillou and I told him I said when he comes here I want him to preach that message at three take three services if he needs to but this is what is happening you say it's not sufficient for me to come and say oh this is a glamorous report of what's happening here's the pictures here's the video it's better that you don't need to see all that but see people right from children not very many children they're off in some other place but I was so impressed with young men and young women, this message is for you and it got a hold of their hearts. And if that has such what happened, what happened to the people? They don't they don't have a car to step into and drive home. They don't have a bunch of friends. They're not going to go to Earls or go to some other ungodly place. They don't have any place. They don't have the money to go there. And one pastor stood up and he said, "In America, you have wonderful roads. You have highways and freeways. In America, you have nice homes. In America, you have all of these things." And he enumerated a bunch. says in the Congo we have this &gt;&gt; and that said it all. &gt;&gt; We have Christ, &gt;&gt; we have the message and it means absolutely everything. And if you have not met him, you really need to meet him. &gt;&gt; If you've not come under that influence, that's the influence you need to come under. Don't let your life be influenced by the world, especially here in this country, this North America. Don't let ourselves be influenced by that. Yes, we have to work. Of course, we do. We've got to pay our bills and all the rest of it. But I say to you in the name of the Lord, you can live above that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can live above it. &gt;&gt; Live be godly &gt;&gt; wherever you are. Be that effective influence there. Be an influence for the message. You don't have to be an influence for the church. We don't need any more members, but be an influence for the message. They'll come then wherever they need to come to be fed, but be an influence for Christ. Don't ever be ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. I want to sing in a moment. The more that I surrender, Brother Ryan, let's just bow our hearts, our heads. Father, I feel dreadfully incapable of bringing the people to where I would love to bring them and to enter also myself into that sacred sacred place lifechanging place. How Satan has crept into this pleasure-loving generation. But life won't go on forever. It will certainly end for all of us. And as you've said in your word, it's appointed unto man once to die and after this the judgment and as the songwriter said, "What then?" Lord, I I feel privileged and also feel a sense of fearful reverence at the responsibility of standing here today before the living before those that will certainly experience what your word has declared. to stand before the purchased the purchase of your blood. To think that you came and so freely gave yourself. And as I have pondered throughout this week of the divine order and how how perfectly you brought the revelation and here we are Lord &gt;&gt; study for years to become engineers or accountants or or whatever more machinists and we study for years and even some of our sisters take some further education some adv advance to advance ourselves just so we can cope with life. But what about the life that's after this one? How much studying have we done? How much prayerful consideration have we given? How much advanced How much have we advanced ourselves in your word, oh God? We're not here just for a hoop and a holler. We're here, oh God, to your word sinks down into every fiber of our being, Lord. Some that have have struggled with things in their lives and Satan has bombarded them and he has no right to them. I'm standing today shielded by the blood of Jesus Christ and coming against the enemy, the Satan. Satan, Lucifer, who is has been cast down to the earth but has no right in this place. Has no right with these people. Satan, you have no place in their lives. You have no place. I declare you to be a liar. I declare you to be an adversary. I declare you to be condemned. I declare your head has been crushed by my savior, by my redeemer, by my Boaz redeemer. He has crushed your head. And I declare he has purchased us. We've been purchased by the blood of the lamb. The blood was spilt. The price was paid. And we have been redeemed. We are redeemed. We can say we are redeemed by the blood of the lamb. And Satan, you cannot go beyond that veil. &gt;&gt; Name of Jesus. I pray that every sick person will be healed &gt;&gt; in this presence and atmosphere. I pray that every bound one will be set free. &gt;&gt; I pray that Satan's hand will be wrenched and will say, I'll quote the prophet's words, Satan, take your hands off of God's property. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ's name. And now people, all we need to do, all you need to do is whatever God is speaking to you, surrender to it. Not to me, to him. Just surrender to him. Surrender to him. Call out on them. Take Congo as an example. If they can do it, we can do it. If they can call out in prayer, I can open my mouth and call out in prayer. What if somebody heard me? What if you're What if you're facing death in the face? Then would you call out? Then would you call? Of course you would. Well, do it now. &gt;&gt; You have no guarantee of your time. You don't even know if you'll see the sunset this evening. Don't know if you'll see tomorrow morning. Call on him now while you have a chance. I beg of you. I plead with you. I don't want to look across the faces of the people and see you standing in a number of the condemned. Having poured my heart and soul out as we have now. Make your peace with God in the name of Jesus Christ. I command you to do it. Surrender now. Call upon him now. Woe is me. I'm at the end of myself. But come, oh God, lay the coal from the altar upon my lips. Let me hear you say, "Now you are purged. Now you are cleansed." [Music] &gt;&gt; Name of Jesus Christ, the only worthy one.

We're going to sing the chorus just once again. And by coming standing, kneeling, you'll be saying, "The more that I surrender, the more I surrender myself, the more he'll lift me up." You'll be saying, "Oh Lord, what I need, I need to be lifted up. I need to be set free. I need to lay that thing down." &gt;&gt; Is the congregation with me? Are you pulling with your faith now? The more that I surrender, [Music] [Music] it's a time. When is the time of God time worthy oh [Music] I love [Music] all the more. So all we can do is surrender. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord.

Lord, you know the desires that were on our hearts coming into service this morning. Father, to touch you and to be led by you. And Father, you're so faithful to come among us, Lord, and speak to our hearts. We worship you this morning, Lord. From the bottom of our hearts, Father, we just wanted to offer a sacrifice of worship unto you this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you're so worthy, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, when we look at how you've blessed us, Lord, you've touched us when we're sick. Lord, you've lifted us up, Lord, when we've been ins snared by the enemy, Lord. And you've set us free to worship you this morning, oh God. &gt;&gt; Father, you've saved our children. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've saved our souls, God.
