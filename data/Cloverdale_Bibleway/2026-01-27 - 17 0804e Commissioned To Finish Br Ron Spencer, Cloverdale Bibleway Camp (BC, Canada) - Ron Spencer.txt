So don't leave without getting it. Amen. Amen. I just pray you'd be blessed this evening. Brother John, would you come please and pray for us? Let's just continue to worship God in our giving. Now, if you have a need as we bow our heads and you'd like the Lord to speak to you, this is your time. Let's just praise him together as we give thanksgiving. Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, God. As we heard this morning, you've given us breath and we want to cry out, Lord, and thank you and praise you, Lord, for this wonderful day that you have given us here at Mount Baker Bible Way Camp to be able to come together and worship, to be able to forget about the world and the things of life, be able to come into this little tent, Lord, and to know that when we leave, supernatural things are going to happen tonight, Lord. just sensing that expectation and that desire and that hunger in the people. I know our hands are lifted up. There's needs among us, Lord. But we just want to thank you already for going out and meeting our needs and satisfying our thirst. Jesus, want to thank you for this morning's service, Lord, as you used our brother David Mayor to speak to us that we are champions and we are heroes. We pray that that would be more than words, more than a sermon, but as we hear the word tonight, it would respond within our souls of healing and life and deliverance for every person here that our souls would cry out, Lord, and respond together, Lord. We love you tonight, Jesus. Oh God, may this tent tonight be filled with adoration and praises and hallelujah. that when our brother Ron comes, Lord, there be an atmosphere where the supernatural could take place. Bless this offering, God. As you've given to us, we want to give back. Some cannot give. Maybe tonight they've forgotten, but I pray you put it in our hearts. And as tomorrow night and Sunday morning we give again, may you, Lord, multiply and continue to work through the body. Every need supplies. If it's spiritual, if it's physical, if it's mental, emotional, financial, Lord, you are here to minister to us. And we want to roll out the carpet as it was and let you walk in among us. Bless the remainder of the service, our giving, our worship, the ministry of the word. Just a moment in your presence could change a life forever. And if that life is ours or someone next to us, we want to create an atmosphere. God, come tonight, Jesus. We give you this service, the offering in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Let's just sing that chorus together. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. Eflat. So glad I'm yours, Lord. Lord, I'm so glad I'm yours. So glad your mercies has followed me.

Oh, without you we would be failures and &gt;&gt; we would have been wrecks on the on the road, a highway somewhere or another. But God, you were rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; It was your great love that you you came and Lord touched our lives. Oh father, I ask you that this afternoon you see each hand that is raised be and defied gravity. We realize we need something beyond our self. Father, I ask you today that you would come and minister to us in a in a special way. Touch all the new friends that have come among us tonight. And I ask you that you would anoint, bless each individual. You see our needs and Dear God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you're a God that's so special that you can touch each and every one of them. I ask you tonight that you would anoint, Father, this vessel as I speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I pray that you would strengthen our vocal cords. &gt;&gt; May they just get stronger. &gt;&gt; Lord, our precious brother Ed, I ask you that you'd send your word and heal him today. &gt;&gt; Strengthen him, Father.

Whether we're the speaker or the hearer or the technicians, I ask you that you would just come among us. And may your presence be known in this tent tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And amen. Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me to Luke chapter 9 and verse 57. I would like to speak this afternoon on commissioned to finish. &gt;&gt; All right. Our prophet ex declared unto us and it doesn't mean much to the rest of the world but it means something to us &gt;&gt; that we are the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. &gt;&gt; And so we realize that we're the finishing of the gentile dispensation and there's not another messenger coming. There's not there's not another message that is even coming. This is the final message that will call the bride of Jesus Christ together. &gt;&gt; Now, the message is more than just the messenger. It's to a group of people that grab the vision for themselves. &gt;&gt; Glory to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they begin to realize that they're a part of it. And it's individual. Two in the bed, want to be taken, want to be left. I know which one I want to be. &gt;&gt; Two at the meal, want to be taken, want to be left. I know which one I want to be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the rapture is not that's just the finishing of it. &gt;&gt; While we're here on the earth, &gt;&gt; we've got a race to run. &gt;&gt; A message to live. &gt;&gt; The prophet would use a term called lived voices. &gt;&gt; I pray today that God would just speak to us in a special way. In Luke chapter nine, Jesus is going to share with us a real a real principle. And it came to pass that as they went in the way, a a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whethersoever thou goest. And Jesus said unto him, "Foxes have holes, birds of the air have nest, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head." And he said unto another, "Follow me." And he said, "Lord, suffer me first to go bury my father." And Jesus said unto him, "Let the dead bury their dead, &gt;&gt; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but let me first go bid them farewell which are at the home at my house. And Jesus saith unto him, No man, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this afternoon. Jesus would pray this prayer and his disciples would capture it and it would be here even for us today. And Jesus prayed and taught them how to pray. And he said after this manner, therefore pray ye. Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Not my kingdom come, but thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. Not my will. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul would write it like this. Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize. So run that ye may obtain. &gt;&gt; And every man that striveth for the mastery is tempering in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we incorruptible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch Paul now as he begins to just share these words with you. I therefore so run, &gt;&gt; not as uncertainly so fight I, not as one that beatth the air, but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to others, &gt;&gt; I myself should be a cast away. The prophet of God shares this with us. He said, "The greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God. &gt;&gt; When you can't do nothing about it, &gt;&gt; just commit it to him &gt;&gt; and God will take care of it." &gt;&gt; I want you to understand commitment. commitment is is is is wholeheartedly. God asked for first place in our lives in our in our age today of leosia that you and I have to combat with in this age. It it contest us. It contest our will. It contest our ambitions. It contest everything that there is about being a a Christian. But God wants us to be totally committed to him. &gt;&gt; Totally committed to him. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand there's many people that are talented. There's many people that have great ability. There's many people that have great names and love. But listen, God has a predestinated seed that is on the earth that God deposited and pre-planned that you would be here. He knew when you would be born and what hour that you'd be born, the nature that you would have carrying from last night. He knew that you would be here, but he had a purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan will throw everything that he can at it to defeat that purpose. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I do not mind if he defeats my personal purpose. But listen, God's purpose can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; In life, there are many people that could write great volumes of books of the could have been. Yes. &gt;&gt; Prisons hold people &gt;&gt; that could have been great lawyers. &gt;&gt; They could have been great doctors. &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been presidents. &gt;&gt; They could have been great family men and women. &gt;&gt; But because of some choices &gt;&gt; that they made in their lives, It held them captive. &gt;&gt; It held them captive till now they serve under a warden. Under that warden they must eat when he tells them to eat. &gt;&gt; They must they must wear the clothes that he tells them to wear. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They must go to bed when they are told to go to bed. There's certain medias that they cannot watch. &gt;&gt; They are known maybe by their last name or a number that is on the back of their jerseys. &gt;&gt; Many of them will never know what freedom is ever about. &gt;&gt; Some of them are sentenced anywhere from days to months to years to lifetimes. Some of them were incredibly good people. Some of them had great ambition and great purpose in their life. But somewhere or another emotions or friendships entangled them &gt;&gt; and it bound them &gt;&gt; and their life's ambitions that they may have wrote down in school that this is what I want to be. Their life's ambitions was tangled by just incredibly horrible choices. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been the greatest athletes. Some of them could have been great great artist. &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been a lot of great things. But they sat in prison behind walls. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They said entangled. What does that have to do with tonight's service? Brother Ron, Jesus is talking about there are many that will take a hold of the plow. &gt;&gt; There are many that will hear his voice and they will make a start. &gt;&gt; They will make a start. Oh, we as the bride of Jesus Christ realize that we're elected and predestinated that God's going to see this through. But I want you to understand, we're not just talking to the bride of Christ tonight. &gt;&gt; But you too are at a war. &gt;&gt; You too are at war. &gt;&gt; You too must fight Leotaa. And Leoa has many entanglements that goes along with it. The cares of this life can ins snare you. The busyiness of this life. All of us have the same 24 hours in the day. Rich or poor, biggest house or the smallest tent, all of us have 24 hours in the day. The richest man in the world does not have an extra second. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The greatest educated person in the world does not have an extra second. Right. &gt;&gt; But if God is going to give me this appropriated time, &gt;&gt; I want to give all of my energies &gt;&gt; and all of my days unto Almighty God. &gt;&gt; I too stand here and just share with you this afternoon. I have looked back at days that I have wasted. I have looked back and looked back at days where my energies has been directed in in other things may not maybe not sinful things but they I've been drawn in in different things just because of life. Life just sometimes does that to us. But let me just say this to you. I cannot do anything about yesterday. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach in this tent. I can't do anything about yesterday, &gt;&gt; but I can commit. &gt;&gt; I can commit. &gt;&gt; It's like someone joining an orchestra. Now, let me just say this to you. Gifts and callings are without repentance. And we can only be what God called us to be. &gt;&gt; That's all that we can be is what God called us to be. But neither do I want to be any more than what he called me. &gt;&gt; But neither do I want to be any less than what I call. &gt;&gt; So if my job tonight is to be the preacher, I want to be the best that God will allow me to be. &gt;&gt; If it's to be the a maner, I want to be the best that God called me to be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, if I was in a in an orchestra and I had a part to play, I had a I had a specific job to do, if I was the first chair, you see, it would take someone to place me in that spot. I would have to be anointed and elected to that position. But you see, even being the first chair, I must make sure that I'm properly in line with the composer and the director. &gt;&gt; I must make sure that I do everything possible to make sure that I did it right. &gt;&gt; That doesn't happen by chance. It has to be 100% right on. &gt;&gt; Now understand understand this. Are we okay? All right. Here's what Satan knows. He knows he's in trouble tonight. &gt;&gt; He knows he's in trouble. I already I got him targeted. Are we on? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Better give you this. Satan knows he's in trouble. It's going to be a tough evening for him. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me better? &gt;&gt; Have you heard everything I've said so far? &gt;&gt; Good. But I don't have to go over it again. Now, we must understand that when we get a the sheet music, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; as being a part of the orchestra, we must understand that we can't negotiate with the sheet music, &gt;&gt; the sheet music is what it is. &gt;&gt; And it isn't it isn't aware that we can change it &gt;&gt; to fit us. You see, Elisha had to be trimmed to fit Elijah's rope. &gt;&gt; And so, we don't we can't change the message to fit us. &gt;&gt; It is us that have to be trimmed to fit the message. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And and and and let me just say this to you. There's no great eyes or little news. There's no there's no one among us other than Jesus Christ. He is the great one that is in the building tonight. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another great leader to come on the scene. We're looking for the voice that is behind the voice. &gt;&gt; I just want to remind you, he's in every service. &gt;&gt; We invited him here and he keeps all of his appointments and he's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to anyone that makes a national orchestra or a universal orchestra, they have to be committed. &gt;&gt; If you would make the Olympic team, you would have to be committed. &gt;&gt; God is expecting nothing less. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any accidental raptures. There's not going to be, "Well, I I hope I make it." That's not how this works. &gt;&gt; That's not how this works. God's going to have a committed bride of Jesus Christ that lives every day of her life committed wholeheartedly to him. &gt;&gt; It's not part of the world and part God. &gt;&gt; It's 100% him. So my book is not going to be started out with could have been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I neither believe in in a half-hearted religion. You're &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus askked us, "Take up your cross and follow me," there's going to be some self cost. that's going to have to be paid by us as individuals. There's going to be some self-sacrifice that we're going to have to make. &gt;&gt; But so many times we want to be like a 40year-old still living with mom and dad, paying no grocery bill, no electric bill. &gt;&gt; If you're in that condition today, wake up. taking no responsibility for their own selves. &gt;&gt; You see, they're an indebted to their own family. &gt;&gt; They're carrying the family name. You can get mad at me later if you want to. Right now is not a good time. &gt;&gt; Become an indebted or a literally a a weight on the family because you've got no responsibility. You don't want to take any commitment. &gt;&gt; Don't cook. Don't clean. &gt;&gt; Don't even clean your own room. I don't know who I'm talking to, but evidently I'm talking to somebody. Well, maybe I'm not talking to anybody in this building tonight, but let me just bring it up just a little bit closer. &gt;&gt; Many times people sit in pews. We'll not call it basement, but people occupy pews &gt;&gt; that refuse to have any vision, &gt;&gt; refuse to accept their purpose in life. &gt;&gt; It's all about me. &gt;&gt; The church ought to be glad that I just sit here. &gt;&gt; If my name is not called, I'm not a part of this thing. If my idea is not projected forth, I I'm just going to walk away. Well, let me just say there's some benefits that goes along with this. It's called tribulation. Period. &gt;&gt; You see, there's groups of people that sit around the bride of Jesus Christ that has not been defiled by denominational systems &gt;&gt; who did not get a new birth. &gt;&gt; Right. But by association they were they were elected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they never caught the vision. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Lord, you're the one who told me to go here. So here we are. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. We are here tonight. Brother Tom, is this all right? cuz I we're here tonight as your family has sent you here. They paid your way. Many of you paid your own way. Some of you came hours. Some of you came literally many flights just to get here. So, you know the cost of getting here and the the immeasurable time that that it took to get in this building. Sometimes even as the days would progress in a meeting, you become fatigued. Maybe wanting entertainment, maybe wanting the services to be a certain way, but God wants to bring you to a level tonight. &gt;&gt; That it becomes more than a protractive meeting. &gt;&gt; It becomes more than who you're sitting beside. It becomes more than friendships or family reunions. It becomes more than music or more than even a favorite preacher. God is calling and declaring tonight. I want total commitment. &gt;&gt; And so tonight, I want to speak to you on challenged &gt;&gt; to finish. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Many many of your mothers and fathers have great testimonies. Testimonies that can be written down in the annals of eternity as as phenomenal overcoming testimonies of Leo. But that is not your testimony. &gt;&gt; You see, God doesn't have coattail religion. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as coel religion. The scripture says to him that overcometh, &gt;&gt; "Will I grant to sit with me in my throne?" &gt;&gt; As I taught my children that is not here tonight, as I taught my children, I would show them the pictures on the wall that they passed by over and over again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sister Marilyn's picture of of Brother Brandham sitting by the fire &gt;&gt; passed by Hoffman's head of Christ. We have several pictures of Jesus. We have a lot of a lot of her message pictures that are in our home. And I've taken them before, especially Sister Marilyn's picture that she painted. And I've I I've I've shared this conversation with them more than once. It is important that you know who William Brandham is, &gt;&gt; but it is more important that you know the God that lived inside of William Random. &gt;&gt; It is important that you realize that I'm your father. &gt;&gt; It's important that you realize that I'm your pastor. But I want you to catch who God is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just share a few scriptures with you. Jesus is going to come to some final moments with his disciples. In Matthew 28 verse 16, he said, "Then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. &gt;&gt; And when they saw him, they worshiped him. But some doubted." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? and you met &gt;&gt; and Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say, at this point, it doesn't matter what the skeptics say. &gt;&gt; At this point, I want you to understand tonight, I could care less what Facebook Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not one to be very dainty &gt;&gt; and I'm not about politics. I could care less what Believe the Sign says. &gt;&gt; At this point, it don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations. &gt;&gt; So now he's going to commission them. You got a job. &gt;&gt; I have preached to you. You have seen the works of God, but now it's going to be your turn. &gt;&gt; Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. And this scripture is going to trip up every trinitarian in the world, &gt;&gt; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Now, God made a promise. &gt;&gt; And that promise is still real tonight. &gt;&gt; So, as I stand here, he anoints the word that he has delivered to the people. &gt;&gt; He made a promise to be in this building tonight. Yes. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 16. Afterward he appeared unto the 11 even as he sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and the hardness of heart because they believed not them which had had seen him after he was risen. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world." That's what this church, that's what's this camp, that's what our churches, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; have took up and become commissioned. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. But he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils, and they shall speak with new tongues, and they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 and verse one. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face were as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. Verse seven. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared unto his servants, the prophet, and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, saying, Go and take the little book which is open in the a hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to have it. &gt;&gt; Give me the little book. And he said unto me, take it and eat it up. &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And he said unto me, thou must prophesy. Hallelujah. Again. After you've taken this message and you've ate it and it cleaned it up and it's took all of your denominational theological ideas out of you and it's washed you by the washing of the word &gt;&gt; and you come under the inspiration of more than a prophet but under the inspiration of the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Grab a hold of that inspiration tonight. and become a lived voices. &gt;&gt; I'm not a preacher. I'm going to address you tonight. Revelation chapter 3. These are all familiar scriptures to you. Behold, I stand at the door knock. &gt;&gt; If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and s with him and he with me. To him &gt;&gt; that just slides through. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; To him that survives. &gt;&gt; To him that gives his half of his heart. &gt;&gt; To him that overcomes, &gt;&gt; which means to wrestle with and prevail. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some serpent bruisers tonight. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some overcomers tonight. will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne. &gt;&gt; Revelation 12 and verse 10. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down. Satan, I want you to listen tonight. &gt;&gt; He has cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him. &gt;&gt; I read the scripture and Ron Spencer overcame him. &gt;&gt; Tom Ray overcame him. &gt;&gt; How Hilderbrand overcame him. Ed Biscll overcame him. Read your name in it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "If you can't read Jesus in every scripture," he said, "Read it again." But remember this, if you you are in him, you're also in every scripture. &gt;&gt; And Ron Spencer overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen to the prophet of God. I'm trying to behave. God's strategy is to take empty human vessels &gt;&gt; and shake the world with them. &gt;&gt; Brother David Mayor this morning, if you didn't hear it, go back and listen to it. &gt;&gt; He brought us heroes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He brought us men like Shamgar. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; A man that was a descendant of the inheritance of Abraham's promise. &gt;&gt; He was not a preacher. &gt;&gt; We don't know anything other than he must have been a farmer. &gt;&gt; And the enemy continued to come and rob him of blessing after blessing after blessing after blessing. But one day he recognized who he was. If you can only recognize who you are tonight, &gt;&gt; not because the preacher told you who you are, but you recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is my day. This is my hour. This is my opportunity. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to do this for me but me. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. At Pentecost, what did he do? He taken them 10 days to get all emptied out up. They was all standing there with their vessels turned up. And God took himself and filled them up. That's all. And they shook the world. He poured himself into them. That's the need of today. That's what we need today &gt;&gt; is the empty vessels. Yes, sir. So God can fill them up &gt;&gt; and you cannot take them. He says God cannot use them as long as they're already filled up. &gt;&gt; If you're full of theological training, God can't use you. &gt;&gt; God's got to have empty vessels that he can fill them. Oh, hallelujah. Elijah, he said, "Go get," he said, he didn't say, "Get some of those vessels and borrow a lot of oil. We'll see if we can get a good sale price on it. You got to get more and pay the neighbor back and back." Just get empty vessels. &gt;&gt; So, tonight I'm looking for some vessels. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; That need the Holy Ghost in it. Well, well, brother, how does that work? Well, let me just give you the more than a recipe, &gt;&gt; but an inoculation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; This will follow Jesus's sermon that he delivers in Matthew 28 and then what he delivers in Mark chapter 16. Now, they couldn't do that on their own. They had showed us what they could do on their own. We talked last night about Peter denying the Lord. Your ability shows failure. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, and they were all in one accord in one place, and suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them clothed in tongue, like as a fire, as it set upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham said, "Even Mary, &gt;&gt; right? Right. Even Mary, for a for lack of a better term, the mother of Jesus was in this. And he said, "If Mary had to have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you'll have to get the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." Verse 36, Peter being the spokesman of the church that day. And he said, "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus." &gt;&gt; Whom ye hath crucified, both Lord and Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this, &gt;&gt; they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" I'm taking time right here. Maybe this is the first time you've ever walked into a tent meeting like this &gt;&gt; and you feel this presence and you know that there's something real about this and you say, "Brother Ron, what must I do? It's the same and it's never changed. Man has tried to change the recipe and only produce death, &gt;&gt; but it has never changed since day one. Repent. &gt;&gt; That's not sorry that I got caught. That's repent &gt;&gt; and turn away. I am done with that devil that I have beencome a slave to all of these years and I have been behind prison doors all of these years. I am done with him. &gt;&gt; A lot of reason people don't overcome filthy habits is because they're still in love with that demon &gt;&gt; and they have a love affair with that demon. If you can ever come to a spot to where the devil is your enemy &gt;&gt; and you refuse to live another day with him, &gt;&gt; too many people want the pastor to counsel devils out of our lives. &gt;&gt; Devil's in for a real rough night. too many times want the pastor to cough or breathe or lay his hands on us. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. We can cast out devils, but you got to keep them off. &gt;&gt; We're commissioned to cast him off. &gt;&gt; But I have learned a long time ago, you don't negotiate with devils. &gt;&gt; There is no room to negotiate with him. &gt;&gt; You allow him to move in your life. Sometimes we just stop for a moment like that little Saunders girl did. Stop to live the just listen to the music just a little bit and all of the sudden we get we get just literally so involved until we find ourselves in the arms of another man. That can be a website. &gt;&gt; That can be the wrong kind of a voice. Some of those voices will tell you, you know, it's not that hard. You, you know, you don't have to be that fanatical. &gt;&gt; Our church, you can cut your hair. &gt;&gt; You can wear pants. You don't have to have a closed line religion. So, they present to you an easier way. I like it when the devil's right square in the crosshairs. &gt;&gt; Before long, the token of our home becomes things that we settle with. &gt;&gt; Prayer is absent. &gt;&gt; Listen to the tapes is absent. &gt;&gt; Reading our Bibles become absent. As a matter of fact, it's difficult to get to church. &gt;&gt; Let me just say church don't start at church. It starts at home. &gt;&gt; A victorious overcomer, a hero that we can talk about don't just accidentally happen, but they have become committed to the cause of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You guys may not want me to preach tomorrow night, but here I am. So, Satan presents us an easier way. He will offer even Jesus a kingdom without a Calvary. Now, so he will offer you believe in this message without a new birth. &gt;&gt; But I want to say this to you. You can hand out a million tracks. If you don't have a new birth, &gt;&gt; Y, &gt;&gt; you've missed the whole purpose. &gt;&gt; It's got to be life inside of here. &gt;&gt; We got to see more than books and tapes and pictures on a wall. I want to see life. &gt;&gt; Cuz books and tapes and pictures on the wall does not scare the devil. But Peter's standing there and says, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." And let me just say this to you. If you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, your sins have not been remitted. &gt;&gt; And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For this promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." And brother Brandham said, "And he's still calling." &gt;&gt; And he's still calling. &gt;&gt; I can hear Belgium say, "He's still calling." Yeah. &gt;&gt; I received a testimony today of what's happened in your home. I don't know how I didn't get that mail, but I received a testimony, Sister Connie, and I just had a oldfashioned shout right there in the room. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. Us as moms and dads cannot hold our children. But if he comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; if he comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; a greater than Solomon is here. And listen, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? 2 Timothy 4 and verse one. I charge thee, but therefore before God in the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick of the dead of at his appearing of his kingdom? Preach the word. Be instant in season and out of season. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine. We are there. But after their own lust heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and they shall turn be turned unto fables. But watch, thou in all things endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make proof, full proof of my minis, of thy ministry. For, watch how he says it. For I am now ready to be offered. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; boy. I I have looked at those words over and over again. I am now ready. &gt;&gt; What a spot. What a spot. I am now ready &gt;&gt; to be offered. And at the time at the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day. Not to me only. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not to me only. But unto them also that love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's talking about me. &gt;&gt; Preacher. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He's talking about me. &gt;&gt; I find myself in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. I'll never forget this. This is one of the first sermons I heard your brother Tom preach. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended. But this one thing that I do sir, &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind &gt;&gt; you can do absolutely nothing &gt;&gt; about yesterday &gt;&gt; but ask God to forgive you. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just forgive you for the neglect. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's forgive you for sherking your responsibility. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's forgive you for not giving your all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for not being committed enough. &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time. &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time. Just shake yourself right now. &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time. Paul could say it, I am now ready. &gt;&gt; I am now ready. I'm ready. When they come to take my head off, I'm ready. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for shouting. Do you &gt;&gt; I'm so excited. I feel like I just bust out of myself. &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; Oh my God, &gt;&gt; Ron. But I'm scarred by my history. I'm scarred by my faults and my failures. I'm scarred by the weaknesses that I have succumbed to. Well, let me tell you what God thinks about that. God so loved you, he provided a blood &gt;&gt; that would wash that completely away. And that blood would be so powerful till even an infinite God that can count all the gnats and the chiggers and the flies that could knows how round this world is. How many people's ever lived on the earth, how many hairs that they had on their head, &gt;&gt; every dimple in the chin &gt;&gt; knows how many horses has been on the earth. how much hair that they've had. That God cannot even find your sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Don't point me to my mistakes. Don't point one another to your failures. Quit digging up your own bones. &gt;&gt; Quit digging your own bones up. Quit digging up your old failures. Quit digging that up. &gt;&gt; Quit walking around like some scarred human being. You got work to do. &gt;&gt; Get up and go to work. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry about what you've been through. Get up. Get up. Get up. We got war to take care of. The fight is on. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure you can point out somebody that's been publicly known, &gt;&gt; but what about you, secret sinner? &gt;&gt; They have found you on sites that you shouldn't have been on. I knew that quietened the enemy. We were taught by a prophet of God to kick out the television, &gt;&gt; but he but the enemy pulled one over on us. &gt;&gt; And we don't need a 51 in screen now. We got a four. We talk about television and all its things, but it's censored. &gt;&gt; But there's websites that takes you to places. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I find it amazing all of the advertisements that come up in the news. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I bow my head and say, "God, forgive me for even looking at the news. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Satan will rob you of your victory. &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me just say this to you. So many times, we want to blame the teacher. &gt;&gt; Follow me just a moment. &gt;&gt; We want to blame the teacher for our children's failures. Our child has not turned out to be a scientist or a doctor, a lawyer or a great engineer. And we want to blame those sorry outfit teachers for their failure of giving not giving enough attention to our individual children. You get a report card. It tells you progression, right? &gt;&gt; And it begins to talk about what you've done for them the month. &gt;&gt; My daughter's a teacher. &gt;&gt; I'd say she's a good teacher, but there are times that when she comes home and she comes over to the house, I can just see it on her and I I can see that she's had a bad day. So I just take her and I hug her and I begin to pray for her. Pray that God would just st her, minister to her. God gave her the gift and the opportunity to do what she is doing to be a blessing to multitudes of children. And she'll guide them. She'll be a light to them in a very dark age. &gt;&gt; But I remind her that one bad apple &gt;&gt; is not to distract her. right &gt;&gt; from teaching the entire class. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to rehearse this before this whole world and say it. &gt;&gt; Men of God &gt;&gt; one bad apple &gt;&gt; that is all about their self that refuses to overcome their pet devils &gt;&gt; is not worth wasting your ministry for. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He's seen it before. &gt;&gt; I heard brother David this morning as he began to preach on boys becoming sissies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. Absolutely true. &gt;&gt; Now listen, I'm a real man and God must have took all the dainty out of me. But when I go to buy a suit or go to buy a dress shirt &gt;&gt; and they have went away from the classic fit &gt;&gt; that it takes real men to get their gut in. I don't want my navl showing. &gt;&gt; I need to be able to breathe while I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; I want a real man's shirt. &gt;&gt; I don't want my pants so tight. You can see my knees sweating. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Well, that's just the way the new fashions are that's taking us forward before a a feminist men. God's calling for real men. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about the muscles in your arms. I'm talking about the scars that's on your knees. Hallelujah. I believe there's young men in this building that can go on their knees and shake the kingdoms of hell. &gt;&gt; We are committed. &gt;&gt; I heard brother David talk. I'm blame on you, brother David. I heard brother David talk about hair dos and hairstyles. Before long, we're using more gel than all the girls do. We got hairs. &gt;&gt; We got colors. &gt;&gt; We gave her an imaginal fix. Before long, we bring it to church and say, "Acept me as I am. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; We are not a bunch of compromisers. &gt;&gt; But God's calling for real men. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; In the charismatic realm, they have what they call promisekeeper conventions. &gt;&gt; Where men gather and they they make a promise. I'm going to be a better daddy and I'm going to be a I'm going to be a better father and I I I'm going to be a better Christian and I'm going to be a better provider at the church and I'm going to do my part only to come home &gt;&gt; and to repeat the process over and over again when Jesus came to Legion. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let me just say he came a long way and there was some supernatural things that happened on his way to get to Legion. But he had one man on his mind to get to. He's came to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Paul would say it. I will repeat it, but I want you to look at it tonight. forgetting those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; Forget them. &gt;&gt; Forget them. Your enemy will never forget it. &gt;&gt; People that are against you will never forget it. &gt;&gt; But you're not that person no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now. &gt;&gt; So many people come late in life. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? I I don't even I I didn't look what time I started. So you ought to help me. So many people are late bloomers in our lives, late enemies in our lives only to point at our past failures. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. I was a drug addict. &gt;&gt; I was identified with that. I was a horrible person to be around. But this may look like the house that that man lived in. &gt;&gt; This might look like the house that he lived in, but that man don't live here no more. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you came to camp, but I want to say this to you. If there's a transformation that can happen in your life, what you have struggled with last week, you don't have to struggle with it no more. &gt;&gt; I have done preached too many years now to know that I have watched prostitute after prostitute after prostitute walk into tents like this and walk into churches, sat down in a pew, and the spirit of God called them and they never return to that ever again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sitting in our church is six cheerleaders that were worldly cheerleaders that found their way into our church. They don't look the same no more. They don't act the same no more. They are not the same no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things become new. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul said, "I press toward the mark for the high for the prize of the high calling which is in God in Christ Jesus." Listen to the prophet of God. Give me a preacher. Give me a Christian. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Give me a housewife that's a Christian. Give me a farmer or a factory worker that'll put God first in everything. &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? Everything. &gt;&gt; I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil can put on him. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, you don't have to buy another book on how to be successful. You don't have to check out nothing else from Amazon on how to be successful. &gt;&gt; God will provide you a job that you never thought was attainable for you. &gt;&gt; God is the best banker that you can ever have. He is the best real estate broker that you can ever have. He is the best marriage counselor that you can ever have. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You don't have to find 52 books on communication between a man and a woman. Men are from Mars and women women are from Venus. You just need to fall in love with God. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. And Jesus Christ came down from heaven to glory down here to build a church. And the material that he's putting in it to it is a time-t tested material. You might come to the altar and make a confession, but when he finds blow holes and everything else in there where the world's blown the maggots into you and so forth, you cannot stand. He just pitches you to one side. God wants a timetested church. &gt;&gt; Not somebody that's a Christian today and a backslider tomorrow &gt;&gt; and it's in and out and up and down it. He can't place you nowhere. But he's got a church that's tested, that's went through trials, through losses, through sicknesses, &gt;&gt; with a testimony. That's the man. That's the man that he's looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus looking upon them said, "With men it is impossible." &gt;&gt; But with God all things. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. are possible. The prophet of God said, "I'm so glad that there is a 10,000 octane power, the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that he he said that shoved that Cadillac down the road yonder under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people at the day of Pentecost, making them the same yesterday, today, and forever. There has got to come one. There has there has been churches churches and brides brides and churches and brides bride. But there's got to come one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe she's here. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for her. I believe I'm preaching to you. &gt;&gt; I believe that, brother Ken. watching 1965. A lot of what people would like to excuse this quote. It's real difficult to do. Invisible union of the bride. A true picture of the modern church today. Neither does the modern church want any of them these years. Screaming, shouting, tongue speaking. Acts 2:38, young ones around her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother kind of. Yeah. Self right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz he can see where the church is going. Even Pentecost is going. Even the church that he was preaching in was going. &gt;&gt; They're becoming just dead morgs. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; She don't wanted them whooping and crying and screaming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Now, let me just say this to you. This is more than about a birth. &gt;&gt; There's times that we need a breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We need to break through in our homes. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, we need a revival in our church. What about a revival in your home? &gt;&gt; I'm calling to you tonight. We're challenged to finish this race. &gt;&gt; We're challenged. This is more than this is more than just for the preachers. &gt;&gt; Moms and dads and young people. Listen, if your mom and dad don't serve the Lord, it's no excuse for us tonight. &gt;&gt; I believe that we can so pray and so be so power packed that our moms and dads will come in. &gt;&gt; I don't care what religion they are. I believe that God can break the chains off of their lives. The God that's in this building can break those chains and break those prison doors. &gt;&gt; There can be such a presence in your home and in your life till when your friends come in, they can feel that holy presence of God that you have been talking to him. Brother Ron, you're preaching like a chip on your shoulder. Yep. I sure am. I'm tired of people that want to argue quotes and can't live the life. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of people that want to be critics and can't live the life. &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldiers. &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldiers. born with Christian soldiers marching as to war. Wow. Such a child would would immediately be put out of their denomination. They had one like that in the churches. Well, they throw her out real quick. Why you letting such a thous go on? You see, she's pregnantated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time. But she don't want them none of them screaming, hollering, blabbering Acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are. It would certainly embarrass her and it would ruin her educated, ethical, scientific society church that she belonged to here. They would throw her out at the next council. She can't have it. She don't want to be impregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth. &gt;&gt; That's the only kind. &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "By their fruit you'll know them." So if you can look back at your life and realize it's not you that's living, &gt;&gt; it's him that's living. If stop and evaluate the music &gt;&gt; that is being played from your life. &gt;&gt; Help me preach just a few more minutes. Now &gt;&gt; we blame the teachers. And you thought I left that subject, but I thought I'd bring it to right here. We want to bring preachers for our problems. But you see, men of God can only be directed by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to deliver the word of God in the hour. &gt;&gt; Men of God many times don't know what's going in your home, &gt;&gt; but he does. So by the discernment of the spirit of God through the word of God, he will begin to give you one sentence after another that attaches to you. Now you can say who told &gt;&gt; somebody's been gossiping &gt;&gt; or maybe that man knows and so he's picking on you. Well, let me just say somewhere you ought to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; Look at what your children are producing. Look at the relationship with your husband and your wife. &gt;&gt; Wow, you're a quiet group. Look, look, look at it. Look at your life. &gt;&gt; Take responsibility of your life. Take responsibility. I don't think I told this last night, but I think I told it in Edmonton a few weeks ago. We were we were away with our family for a few days. I think it was four days. We was away with our family and we were gathered in a breakfast area and all of our family, our children would come around and they would hug me and you know it was just a normal day. They would hug me. My babies would tell call me papa. They'd tell me they love me and I'd tell them I love them and my children would was around us and we was talking backwards and forwards talking about the daily events and and we were just kind of just rehearsing backwards and forwards. We were there for about 40 minutes every morning. One morning I didn't walk up the steps with Sister Connie and the rest of the family. I got on an elevator. I got on the elevator. I got on the elevator with a man that was a had a walker and he was very nice dressed man and he he looked at me and he backed up against the back wall of the elevator looked at me and said, "Could I speak to you just a moment?" I said, "Sure." He said, "I want to I want to congratulate you and I want to commend you on the family that you have." He said, "You're to be honored. You're to you're a blessed man." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're to be commended and congratulated for having that kind of an atmosphere with your family. &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, sir." I said, "That's no accident. knows that &gt;&gt; that's no accident. &gt;&gt; I don't tell our children, "All right, now let's behave because we're in public." &gt;&gt; I definitely don't tell my little grand and grand how to behave in front of Popo. Don't embarrass Paulo. Now, that's just life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just real life. &gt;&gt; Real life. &gt;&gt; That's real love. It's no make love. It's a This isn't artificial. This is real. &gt;&gt; This message that I have believed all my life, that I've had a passion for, it lives every day. &gt;&gt; It lives. I want to share this with you tonight. It lives. &gt;&gt; It didn't start two weeks ago. It started years ago in our lives. Now, &gt;&gt; don't you point your poison darts at me and try to throw a fire. It's your fault if you don't have that. &gt;&gt; You need to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, and I want to give you the answer for it. It's on your knees. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's on your knees. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I turned to the man and I said, "My name is Ron Spencer. That don't probably don't mean nothing to you, but may I ask you your name?" And he told me his name. I said, "What do you do in life?" He said, "Well, I'm retired now." And he said, "Some of them call me the president of the University of Tennessee." something. &gt;&gt; And he said these words to me, "Of all of my life, I've never seen a family like that." &gt;&gt; Marvelous. Marvelous. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's what this message produces. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's what this message produces. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; That's what this atmosphere produces. &gt;&gt; That's what this Jesus that's among us produces. &gt;&gt; That's what that produces. &gt;&gt; We were leaving the same day and we were putting our bags in the car. We went out the door together. So happened we went out the door together and he looked at me and he shook my hand and he said, "It's been an honor to be with you this week." And his wife walked up to me and she began to talk to me. She said, "You have moved my husband." &gt;&gt; She began to share some words to me that was very nice. And I just looked at her and I said, "It was Jesus." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's what produces. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel it just kind of &gt;&gt; just come to a spot here just now. I don't know where you're at in your life, but he's come in this building &gt;&gt; in this place. And I've become very aware in the last few moments that he's dealing with souls all across this building. And the best that I know about this convention is not about preaching to you mysteries. &gt;&gt; The greatest mystery that you can have &gt;&gt; is to have him &gt;&gt; living inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe it's more than the disciples being commissioned or your preacher being commissioned. But now you and I have a mandate. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If the prophet of God said, "Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville tonight thousands of live voices." &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean for us to move to Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; But what about where you're at? &gt;&gt; You've got a sacred responsibility where you're at, on your street, in your neighborhood, in your schools. &gt;&gt; In your community, on your job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To witness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To witness &gt;&gt; to witness. And your life is the greatest witness that you can possibly have. &gt;&gt; I didn't give a man the track or I didn't give him a book. &gt;&gt; I presented him a life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've led literally thousands of people to Christ. But one of the greatest ways to lead people to this Jesus is for him to live. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; That's why people call brother Brandham God is because he so surrendered himself unto God &gt;&gt; until they couldn't see the man anymore. &gt;&gt; Oh, that we could be guilty of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Legion came home clothed and in his right mind. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us that he became a real family man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what you did yesterday, and I don't care. I don't want to know. But all I know is God commissioned me this afternoon to walk to this pull pit to challenge you with what you'll do with tonight and tomorrow &gt;&gt; and the next day and the next day. We don't have a minute to waste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe this has not ended like you thought it would. &gt;&gt; But now it becomes your turn. &gt;&gt; You see a director all he can do is present the music. Right. &gt;&gt; The music is not negotiable. &gt;&gt; But it's your responsibility to play. &gt;&gt; And if it's the triangle, be the best triangle &gt;&gt; that you can possibly be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a man in my church that stands about that tall. &gt;&gt; He considers me a very tall man. I love that man. He may never hear this sermon. His name is Roy. Royy's a real Christian. He's a real Christian. Roy many years ago. He's never been a deacon. He's never been a trustee. He's never been an officer of the church, but he's my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's become our custodian of the church, lives on the property, but Roy many, many years ago took up a job of open the door for everybody at church. And he said, "Every person that walks into this church needs to be greeted with a smile." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's the best sermon that can be presented. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that no matter what you are in life that when you come to this church, &gt;&gt; the first thing that you can see is a life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Roy would be very embarrassed if he knew that I was calling his name tonight. But somewhere in the great eternities Amen. &gt;&gt; I can hear the great prophet of God say, "If it's to be the doormat, I want to be the best doormat that I can be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it live. &gt;&gt; Let it live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your position is in life, whether you're the door greeter &gt;&gt; or what you are, but I have preached to little women that hardly whispered an amen, but they could pull on the gift of God so incredible it feels like you're preaching just to them. just sitting rock under the Holy Ghost and you just know that they've been in contact with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They're kind of like a woman that says, "Where is my Elijah at?" &gt;&gt; And God comes on the scene for them. &gt;&gt; I know you've had a difficult day. You've climbed mountains. You've did something that I have difficult to do. You've got on water. You've canoed paddles. Paddle canoes. I like water. It's in a shower. Or to drink it. I've been invited to a really nice fishing trip and it'll take God and and 40 angels to be with me to go on that fishing trip. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God knows where we're sitting at today. &gt;&gt; So I want to pause and I hear the prophet of God say, "Stay in line." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I hear him scream, "Stay in line. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. Stay in line. Stay in line, little pride." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not 1964, 1965. That's now. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. This is finishing. &gt;&gt; I want to finish. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just start strong and run strong. I want to finish. &gt;&gt; I don't want to give out. I don't want to come to the end and just give up. &gt;&gt; I want to finish. Anybody can start out and run a little while. &gt;&gt; Anybody can get some momentum from one another. But it's finishing the course. &gt;&gt; I want to finish. &gt;&gt; Now just pause and just reflect for a moment. Stop blaming somebody else. Stop looking at your own faults and failures for a little bit and put it under the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come to a place that you can pray, "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Brother Ron, this service has not been so deep really &gt;&gt; for you in your mind's eye. I have just preached your life story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have just preached your life story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, &gt;&gt; how are you running? &gt;&gt; Yeah. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; It's not about what we used to do. &gt;&gt; It's about what you're doing right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at yourself. How committed really are you? Are you letting other things get in your way? Now, school is fine. It's got its place. Jobs are fine. They've got their place. Businesses are fine. They got their place. Hobbies are fine. They got their place. But anything that gets between you and God, &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Becomes idolatry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more statement? And I hope it don't make nobody mad. Billions of dollars are spent on how to eat right and lose weight. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Feel a spirit all over this building now. &gt;&gt; But 99.9% of us &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; feed our own self. &gt;&gt; I have been married. I'm not an idiot. 30 some years. Oh, brother Tim, that's easy for you to do. 30 some years. And but my wife only but just a short period of my life fed me. It was during that period where I was burned and my hands wouldn't work. I lost weight. But you see, I have to take responsibility of what I eat. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I thought you was finishing. I have and you just don't realize it because you've got to take responsibility of what you eat spiritually. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You got to take responsibility what you eat. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you tonight as we come to the close of this service, &gt;&gt; have you been blaming other people for your spot where you're at? Have you been committed like you should be committed? It's easy to go with the flow. It's easy to become part of a church and be part of a community of a church and just kind of fall in line. It's easy to be conformed to all of this. &gt;&gt; But what about your personal transformation with Jesus Christ? We can talk about what we have done, but what are we going to do? &gt;&gt; Maybe let's bow your head just now. I wrote a statement down to end this with today. I want to lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beset me. And I want to be more determined than ever before in my life. I want to be more determined than ever before in my life. How many could say, "Brother Ron, I really, really needed that tonight." Hands, hands before God. Hands before God. I really I really needed that tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I really needed that tonight. Brother Ron, I I just need deliverance in my life. I just I I personally just need deliverance in my life. Won't you just raise your hand to him just now? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I want to make a challenge to you tonight. It's a challenge to finish. You've sat for quite a while listening to me preach, but now it's your turn. Maybe you just like to stand to your feet just now with the hands that's been raised and say, "Brother Ron, I'm determined. This message tonight's going to change my life. This message tonight's going to change my life. &gt;&gt; I've heard powerful sermons, but tonight, this message &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; has asked me to take personal responsibility. And I want him to have an open channel to draw to me. I want to get it unclogged. I I want to get everything unclogged out of my life. &gt;&gt; I want to lay aside some weights in my life. &gt;&gt; I want to get rid of some shadows that's in my life. I need to get rid of some influences that's in my life. I need a proper diet spiritually in my life. And I want I want to just tonight I want him to come and change me. I want more than an emotion to change me. I want him to come. &gt;&gt; I want him to come and have a personal conversation with me. &gt;&gt; That's what he's done this afternoon. Don't let this evening be wasted. Don't let it be wasted. Just look at your life. God, what do you want to do with me? What do you want to do with me in my life? If it's to be an a manor, definitely a better prayer warrior, develop me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Get me beyond me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get me beyond me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My job's not to speak squirrels into existence. Not to speak storms out of existence, but to get beyond myself. &gt;&gt; If I can have dominion over my flesh, &gt;&gt; if I can get beyond my own opinions, &gt;&gt; if I can get beyond my own thoughts, &gt;&gt; help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh spirit of God, we bow our heads before you now. God, &gt;&gt; like a father, you've come and talked to us. Lord, I knew in the room this afternoon when you came. There's just none like you when you come. &gt;&gt; How you turned this sermon, I thought it would go a complete different direction. how you turned this sermon. It's because of your care for your children. &gt;&gt; Not just here, but around the world. You care for your children. &gt;&gt; And your children are struggling. They're fighting with their own selves. Oh, God. But you've walked into this building tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. to let us know you're here to help. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. &gt;&gt; He was looking at disciples. Everyone but one would die. A martyr for him. &gt;&gt; But every one of them would leave the earth with a testimony that he lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know particularly many of us trust to make a rapture but may we leave the earth with a testimony he lived he lived in Ron Spencer &gt;&gt; he lived in Ed Biscll who lived in Tom he lived in the ministry he love lived in that little woman down the street &gt;&gt; oh God the greatest compliment that any of us could have &gt;&gt; is I see Jesus in that individual The message lives inside of that person. &gt;&gt; A real humility, a real godliness. That's a real comer for overcomer. If I've ever seen one, that's a real overcomer. Satan, we bind you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You don't have the keys to your own house. You were stripped at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Now you take your hands off of God's children. &gt;&gt; You may have held them captive for many, many years. But tonight, we recognize who we are, what we've been called to do, what we've been elected and ordained. You placed us in this age, Father, to overcome this age. We'll be the final voice to the final age. You'll echo your voice out of our lives. Oh God, come and fill our hearts where we're standing right now. May the Holy Spirit permeate this tent. &gt;&gt; May the atmosphere of this building be charged with your presence. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh, spirit of God move. &gt;&gt; Spirit of God move in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we give you free course this afternoon. We ask you, we surrender ourselves to you tonight. We give ourselves wholeheartedly to you. We ask forgiveness, Father. Oh God, soak down in our lives just now. Go God, look at every closet of our lives. Father, &gt;&gt; take anything out of us that's not like you. Every spirit of unbelief and disobedience and rebellion, &gt;&gt; break those chains tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Ghost, break the chains of our old nature. Bring a newness in our lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Oh God. Oh God. God. Oh God, the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God. Oh God. Now I'm going to ask your favor. I preached and sweated and I've delivered what God's laid on my heart tonight. But now it's your turn. It's not your neighbor that you can do anything about. It's not even the man that's sitting on the platform. It's you. I want you to lift your voices just now and talk to God. &gt;&gt; Now, nobody else can do this for you but you. &gt;&gt; I want you to talk to him. I want you to talk to him. I want you to invite him to the chambers of your soul. I want God to meet your expectation right here tonight. Maybe it's to be a better daddy or better mama, be a better Christian. Whatever it is here tonight, won't you just go ahead and surrender? say, "I refuse to take that spirit home with me. I refuse to take this sickness home with me tonight. I refuse to worship that spirit anymore. Tonight, I am an overcomer through the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Just invite him to where you're at now. Oh dear God, don't leave me out. Pass me not, oh gentle Savior. Hear my humble cry. Meet me here tonight, Father. Don't leave me where I'm at. Jacob said, "Oh, I'm going to hold on to you until you change me. I'm going to hold on to you until I'm no longer Jacob. I want to finish my course, but I don't want to do it as Jacob. I'm not going to let you go until you bless me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let you go till you bless me. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God, come fill our lives. Oh God, come break through our shells tonight.

I give you my life. &gt;&gt; I give you my life. &gt;&gt; My life is in your hands. &gt;&gt; I surrender my life. He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; It's here to meet your need. Mighty angels among us now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh, I thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's me. It's me. It's me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hear my vocal cords, Lord, as I call out to you. &gt;&gt; Let it break through Leotaa. Let it break through the cares of the world. &gt;&gt; It's me, God. I want to respond back to you, Father. &gt;&gt; I want to worship you in this moment.

Just close your eyes and say, "Lord, I've heard from the throne of grace. I've heard God speak this evening. It has not been the instrumentality of man. &gt;&gt; But if you'll just be honest with your own heart tonight, I believe the word of God has sought you out. I believe that with all my heart the way the Holy Spirit moved from one side and to another side in another area, this area in that area. And if you're just willing just to open the door of your heart one time, just this one time, this one moment, God can do exceedingly and abundantly. I'm This is called the family camp. Now, we're talking about the young people that are here at the front. I know there's parents in the back that really need a touch from God. Really need a liberating move of the spirit where now it's not just church and I'm old and I don't lift up my hands and I don't I'm not a participant anymore because I I've been in this thing 30 and 40 years. Saints, it doesn't matter how long. &gt;&gt; A son is a son from the mind of God back to eternity. And I know in the mind of God, we praised him. I know when we go to heaven, we'll praise him. I know tonight there should be something in your heart that is willing to say, "Lord, that demon that has held me is not worth keeping me back from glorifying the God of glory. And I deny Satan in the name of Jesus Christ. I receive what I heard tonight. And I am delivered in the name of Jesus. Amen. I am delivered. I am set free. I am the church of the living God. I believe what I heard tonight. I am not going through a tribulation. I am going in a rapture. Hallelujah. That's what the rain is all about, saints of God. Not to regurgitate our problem again and again and again. It's to stomp the devil. Take the word of God. Know who you are in Christ. Amen. You are now children. You call yourself children. You are young men. You are young men. You are young women. And we've got many examples in the Bible. And they weren't wimps. And they weren't whiners. They were sons of God. And if you don't want to be a son of God, then you're in the wrong place. But if you want to be a son of God and liberated and know that you're more than a conqueror, then take what you heard tonight and tell that devil that's on your shoulder, get behind me. Get behind me. We've heard enough word in three services right now, saints of God, we should be conquering every spirit. There shouldn't be one of you looking down and say, "I don't want to hear what Brother Tom or Brother Ron or Brother David to say." You should be looking me square in the eye and say, "That's nothing but the truth, preacher." &gt;&gt; If you want the world, have at the world. But give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me the word. &gt;&gt; You want popularity, go have at it. Because one day you won't be popular. You want to be the macho man, go have at it. But I'll take somebody that Brother Ron said today that has got muscles on his knees that's got a walk with God that knows who he's talking to because you say, "Well, I'm just a young person right now. In just a few short years, you're going to be married and you're going to have a baby and you're going to you're going to need to know the God of your salvation. That baby's going to get sick. Your wife is going to get sick and you're going to say, "Where's God? Where's the preacher?" No. Where are you? Where's your walk with God? &gt;&gt; You call heaven down. &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to be married. I want to see men." Then I want to see men that know how to handle a word. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I'm looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking for I I I tell you what. I'm looking for a son of God. I'm looking for a daughter of God." That's what we're here tonight. That's your challenge. That's your challenge tonight. Everybody wants to be first fiddle. We heard. Everybody wants to be numero uno. I'll tell you what, I don't want to be numero uno. Everybody wants to be the first guy wants to be recognized. I read an article years ago, years and years and years and years and years ago. You cannot change the music sheet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot change the music sheet. Everybody wants to be the boss. Really? This guy was the second he was the second violinist in the greatest the symphony there was in America. And they did an interview with him and said, "You could be a first violinist anywhere in the world that you want to be." He said, "Why aren't you a first violinist?" He said, "Because God called me to be the second violinist because without me there's no harmony. Oh yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you get it? &gt;&gt; Without you, there is no church. &gt;&gt; Catch the word. Don't try and be number one. Just be who you are. &gt;&gt; You cannot be a brother Ron Spencer, a Tom Ray. You can't be these brothers here. You be what you are and what God's called you to do. &gt;&gt; Don't get jealous over somebody else. You just say, "Lord, make the best me there is." Is everybody with me tonight? You heard the word. How many received something from God tonight? &gt;&gt; I sure did, saints of God. I sure did. And we've put in a lot of work and a lot of effort. And you, as brother Ron said, you've come a long way. You won't outgive God. &gt;&gt; There's no one of you I was going to say, God, I did more than what you did. God has given us gracious, gracious, gracious words of life. Wonderful words of life. And I just say all I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is him. &gt;&gt; That's all I want to see. I don't want your theology. I don't want your thought of what it is. I want Jesus, the living word, living in me. That's what the whole message is about. Can we sing that little chorus before we go? All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is in me. All I want to see is Jesus shine through me. Oh, I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consume me fire. All my words and all my deeds and every breath and all my needs will lay before the holy consuming fire. All I want to see is Jesus. And all I want to see, &gt;&gt; I want to see him in me. All I want to see is Jesus shine through me. And let me hear him say, and let him say, well, it's well All I want to hear him say is well done, Saint. All I want to see is Jesus. And all I want to see is him. All I want to see is Jesus. Oh sh. One more time. Let's hear him say, "Well done." Let's lift up our voices to him and hear him say, "Well done, my preious one." Oh, well done. Well done. Amen. Well done. &gt;&gt; Well done. How many really felt the word of God came to your address? And whenever Jesus comes, the supernatural starts taking place. I've got a quote here I was going to read. In fact, I got a whole message that I want to preach when I get home. Brother Ron gave me a message and I thought, "My goodness, I can't wait." And then these brothers know that's not me. I'm not running to preach, but I've got a message burning in my heart. &gt;&gt; And I think we better issue out some seat belts. Amen. I tell you what, that's inspired word that you heard tonight. That's inspired word you heard this morning and last night. I'm can't wait for tomorrow. Brother David, &gt;&gt; we're feasting. &gt;&gt; Feasting. And this is the secret rapture. People don't even know what we're doing here tonight. They're out in their places and they're doing their thing. They don't have a clue. We're getting caught up &gt;&gt; and we're getting carried away. We say, "Well, it's a secret rapture." It is indeed a secret rapture because some of you don't have a clue what I'm talking about, but most of you do. &gt;&gt; And we just want to get out of here. &gt;&gt; And so we say, "Lord, anoint the men of God to minister the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. Till we raise into such heavenly places. Brother Matthew, you won't have to go to the Lynen Fair. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something? All their preparations for what? We're going to heaven. &gt;&gt; How many want to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; How many want to pledge allegiance &gt;&gt; to the lamb? &gt;&gt; Can we sing that at our last song? We heard the word and I pledge allegiance to the word of God. That was we made a challenge to tonight. I pray to you. Oh, I pledge al to the I heard how longer where I find they were here's a challenge if they would never the name of Christ One by one they chose to die the son of God. They would not like angel sing. I can almost hear their voice with all my strength with all my I will sing to all is our glad to the lamb to the lamb of God. Oh my go to all his I to the Let's praise him. Amen to the lamb of God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't you know that Jesus is here? Don't you know that King of Kings is present? Hallelujah. You know, the world has never had the devil's never had an original thought. &gt;&gt; They never He's never had an original thought. You know, you go to a sports game and they do the wave. Really? Really? We've been doing that a long time. &gt;&gt; We've been raising our hands and we've been giving him the wave of surrenderance. That's the real wave. &gt;&gt; We've had a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; I'm thanking you all that have come, all that have come down this highway. I remember my boys when we first came to this camp from Kuwamas. We went to here and they were just little tikes at the time and now they're old tikes. But by the time we got up to Maple Falls, they're giggling, they're laughing, they're jumping. We're going to camp. And I told you and I've told you many, many, many, many, many times when the pastor stood behind the pulpit at Kowama's camp. I've got it on the my Bible. And he got under the anointing at the close of the service. And he says in the first person, I give you your children. I was a deacon at the time. I was standing by a pole like where brother Jonathan was standing at. an old tent, an old blue tent. Tears were streaming down my eyes. I just had little boys. I had the privilege to have Sam come to have lunch with the brothers today. And when he walked in, people misunderstand it. They're thinking I'm saying son, but I'm saying hun. They're my boys. and I love them dearly and God gave them to me each one sovereignly and I can say to a parent that is sitting here today that their son hasn't come you call him hun you call him darling I don't care what you call him say that's big sis you fight I got them &gt;&gt; Jesus gave them to me amen and Jesus can give you your children Jesus can give you your mothers Jesus can give you your fathers. Amen. They come out of the world and they've never gone back. They're not a bunch of yo-yos. &gt;&gt; Oh, I met God at camp and then after camp, you become a a backslider again. What kind of You didn't meet God at camp. You meet God once, you're never the same. &gt;&gt; Moses never went hurting sheep again. I know that if you can believe that that word comes to your address and you catch a hold of that one time, &gt;&gt; you will be a man and a daughter of God &gt;&gt; forever. And it doesn't have to be emotion. It has to be faith. &gt;&gt; And by faith, Noah built an ark to the saving of his household. And that's what we have camp for, for the saving of our household. Brother Peter, I have an ankle. Would you come and close us with a word of prayer, please? Precious Lord Jesus, we just want to say, Lord God, how we love you, how we appreciate your word, Lord Jesus. Truly have spoken to every heart this evening, Lord God.
