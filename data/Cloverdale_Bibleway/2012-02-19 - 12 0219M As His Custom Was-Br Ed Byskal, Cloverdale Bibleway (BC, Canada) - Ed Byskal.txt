Listening to Kinsman Redeemer last night and just a paragraph that jumped out at us. He says, "The word made a human being become a kinsman. He become a man. Oh, he become death that through his death I might become life. He became a sinner that through his righteousness I might have life. He became poor that I through his poverty I might be made rich. He became what I was so that I might through his grace become what he is. Oh my. Then talk about powers of God. Now that's exactly the scripture. That's what the scripture says. That we might be what love the father has shed upon us. that we which were sinners, aliens away from God, might be drawn nigh unto God in so much that we become sons and daughters of God, not servants. Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful that we've been made sons and daughters of God? Amen. Today, we've come to remember the sacrifice that he made for us with communion tonight. Believe we're going to start the service at 4:00 this evening. So, those who have come to be with us have a little extra time. We're looking forward to a wonderful day. Amen. Why don't we stand and sing, Who can cheer the heart like Jesus? Oh, who can cheer the heart like Jesus?

Hallelujah. We have a couple testimonies this morning. And we just want to rejoice with our brothers and sisters. Sister Shannon Smoutz has a testimony. A month or so ago, I brought my six-year-old Elizabeth out for prayer for a kidney reflux. We thank God for his healing power. She began to exhibit evidence of another infection. So, we called on the saints to pray and within about 2 hours, the symptoms were gone. Glory to God and thank you to all who pray. Amen. Also, a testimony from my brother Dominic Gonzalez. I'd like to thank God for keeping me safe and watching over me. On Thursday, I was in a wreck that completely totaled my truck, but by the grace of God, I came out of it unhe hurt. God still watches over his bride. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We do want to remember a couple prayer requests. Excuse me. Our brother Ricardo has asked us to remember sister Shante. She's home with a stomach flu. Also a request from our brother Alan King. Please pray for my daughter and sister who are having exploratory procedures this week. and also brother Milo's wife. At the same time, we'll be having the same procedure. We just pray that the God that our Lord God will speak to their hearts. Amen. Also a request from our brother Norm Wood. He requests prayer for himself for healing and strength and asked that we would remember his wife, Sister Luis, in prayer. She is having cataract surgery this Tuesday. Amen. I just wonder, Brother John Andes, would you come open the service for us in a word of prayer if there's something on your heart? Amen. healing streams of life. Amen. We just sang the song. It about sums it all up. Everything we have need of. Amen. Just hold it before the Lord as we go to prayer at this time. Brother John. Thank you. Let's just hold our re request up to the Lord Jesus today. Heavenly Father, oh God, we're just under such an anticipation today of your presence, Lord. already sensing you're among us. Lord, I wonder what kind of day it was when Abraham was sitting in the tent door. God, all of a sudden, over the horizon came your presence in Melzdc. Lord, by the end of that day, Lord, the promise had already been spoken that had the power to change his body, Sarah's body. Lord, the promised son was on the way. Judgment was coming to Sodom and Gomorrah. But Abraham was having fellowship, breaking bread, having communion, fellowship, bread and wine and the oil, God. And today we've approached your house, God. Oh, what a day, Lord, as we sit in the tent of your house. What kind of day is it going to be, Lord? &gt;&gt; Is today the day when the dead in Christ shall rise? Will it be a day like today, Lord, when our bodies will be changed? &gt;&gt; It's a day, Lord, when the victory and the battle must be won for our fallen brother, Lord, our brother that's gone astray. I pray the Holy Ghost God would co so come into this room Lord into this building out across the internet Jesus for we have come into another season when the bride recognizes who she is and that the battle is raging Satan is fighting and a great attack against the bride of Christ and it's in that season that you've called a communion table Lord Lord Lord, our hearts rejoice, Lord, that we are not of the world and we're not just drifting with Leodysia, but you've called us into a secret place. That our pastor, Lord, could feel led to have a communion service. And that you could create a hunger and an expectation, God, and in the body here that we all could draw together in our faith, God. And we pray even now forgiveness and repentance of any sin. Jesus, we don't want any hindrance. God, I pray if there's any flesh, any hindrance in our hearts, God, that right here today, God, we could start as we closed Wednesday night as our brother Tom brought the message of the Lord. That we could end this service at the altar, God. that we could start this meeting the way we ended it Wednesday night God right at the altar God just repenting God just laying it all out Father for you come to those that are honest and broken those that are willing to say Lord I want to take all the cup Lord &gt;&gt; whatever is in this cup Lord I want to drink it all Lord &gt;&gt; we take the bread Lord as you Melzdc king of Salem peace distributed out today. I pray that our hearts would be quivering, God, for your presence is so near that every request and every hunger as we just lift up our hands throughout the congregation and out across the the internet and the phone hookups, Lord, the supernatural is taking place. Lord, thank you for the testimonies this week. Lord, &gt;&gt; our brother Gonzalez, Lord, saved from what could have been a tragic accident, Lord, and you saved him, Lord. We want to rejoice with the family today, God. And thank you, Jesus, Lord, for keeping our teenagers, Lord, and keeping our families, Lord, and healing the sick, Lord, and raising the dead, Jesus, and open blinded eyes, and the crippled are walking today, God. There's needs in the body, Lord. Our brother Norm Wood, Lord, that's given himself, Lord. And I pray you'd strengthen him today, Jesus. Sister Louise with his cataract surgery. Bless her eyes, Lord. Touch her, Jesus. Touch our brother Alan King's family, Lord. His daughter and his other relative, our brother Milo's family, Jesus, as we lay hands on these requests. And many hearts are are needy today for your touch, Lord, and for your provision, God, and families. Our hearts are burdened, God, with many needs, Lord. But you're a great God, Lord. And I pray that you'd blow out all the flu of unbelief today. May there be no hindrance, God. As our pastor stands behind the sacred desk, may the Holy Ghost go to every soul and every life. May bodies be delivered, God, from the chains of sickness. May doubts and fears leave the people. May the chains and and and the bars be broken, Lord Jesus Christ. May souls be saved. May hearts be filled, God. May your revelation be flowing freely today, God. Lord Jesus, would you meet with us today, this whole day, Lord, that the atmosphere would be one of your very great nearness. As we kiss you, Lord, as we embrace you, as we pray, God, for your nearness, may today be a wonderful day, God, of communion and fellowship and relationship, God, greater than we've ever had before, Lord. That by the end of the day, we like Abraham and Sarah could look out through the same tent door and say, "How great is our God? How great is his word? He's the greatest one. &gt;&gt; We're looking for you to manifest it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Be glorified today in every situation in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, brother John. It's already done. Amen. We've had prayer. Just before we have our seats, why don't we sing It's already done. Amen. The battle is over. The victory is won. Oh, it's already done.

Tonight we'll have communion, Lord's supper, foot washing. We want to welcome and we're so thankful to have our brother Ivan and sister Aanth back after. Brother Ivan, where are you? If you stand up, please. You're right there. Sister Aenth. [Music] So good to have you, Brother Ivan. God bless you. Uh you've traveled so much. Uh Brother Ivan, maybe you can at least just come down here so we can everyone can see you. Sister Is God bless you. I know you have your babies and they've just had a long trip. They just arrived home yesterday and uh many lives have been touched &gt;&gt; in China. Many many lives have been spoken to, touched by the message. We are so thankful uh through our brother Ivan's burden and he's had a real burden to see that the message gets out and uh we are part of that. We are part of that. Come up here, brother Ivan. I have to give you a hug. Oh my goodness. Praise the Lord. Why don't you greet the people? Just say a word of greeting. And we have time for all of this, don't we? Yeah. Just give a word of greeting. &gt;&gt; Uh great how everyone. Uh really really wonderful to be back uh to sing the wonderful songs and you don't know when you don't sing those songs for nine months. It's really makes different when you worship together and you know everyone is have the one chord and one faith and that's really really wonderful thing when you go to face the opposite against the &gt;&gt; and you when you go go back to your own people I mean go back to your family really family that's um exciting exciting to see all of you thank you for your prayer support and love and uh so that we can come back safely without you and support everything and we won't uh make that trip so success. So um thank you. God bless all of you. God bless you daddy. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say God bless you in Chinese so they can understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That sounded almost better than English. Well, it'll be fine for the music. Um, and we want to be show our appreciation also for the saints that are here from Seattle, Tacoma that have come. We say God bless you. We pray that today will be also special day for all of you as well. We're so happy when we're able to come together like that. Want to also mention once again even though we have uh spoken of it a wee bit on on Wednesday night but so that you can make your plans accordingly. We are having special uh 40th year anniversary meetings. That'll be our 40th year here in this area in Cloverdale, Pacific Northwest. And uh that will be May the 18th, 19th, and 20th, and the 21st. 21st is Monday, but it's a long weekend here on the Canadian side. The following weekend is a memorial day on the US side, but we're going to uh have uh special things. Perhaps we may I have invited a a brother over from Africa, a young man, and he's probably streaming the meeting right now. Uh I've just been impressed over the last several years, probably three, four years. He has he has worked tirelessly taking the message and ministering and whatever more and uh has sacrificed a great deal. And I thought it would be a wonderful thing for young men, young women, especially senior young people to perhaps just hear his testimony and hear what God is doing in his life. He ministers most every Sunday. So, uh we're we're really thankful uh for that. Uh tonight, although we're having the Lord's table in communion, I have felt something on my heart. And so I thought I would just mention it. Uh I want to have a prayer line tonight. Uh not just to pray. I do not want to have those come say I just want to be closer to God and you know, I need the Holy Spirit. We know if you need the Holy Spirit, you you do the praying. You you pray. But there are people that are sick, people who've been afflicted, people who have not gotten an answer from God regarding that. And I would like to uh when we have the emblems of the Lord's table here, that can that must uh speak very very powerfully to us. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It must say to us, "I am the Lord that health thee." &gt;&gt; All the promises of God must just come to life and explode with meaning &gt;&gt; at such a time as that. &gt;&gt; And uh so I I have just felt I was in prayer this morning and I couldn't get this off my mind the last few days. Uh I was thinking of what we have uh available to us. This will be in line. And I'm almost getting you prepared for the message this morning. But if we are if there's anyone here or any one of us and I think we all get to this uh all of us arrive at this point at some time where we feel we just like we need a spiritual cleansing. We just need a spiritual cleansing. Well, I know one &gt;&gt; and we have a resource &gt;&gt; that can cleanse the most stubborn stain. &gt;&gt; Amen. and cleanse us and make us free. Just think about it. There is there's no one that we know of. You know, the world's always coming out with new cleaners and new cleansers and this will take this stain and this will remove the stain from grout or concrete or whatever more. We have a source &gt;&gt; that will cleanse the stain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the soul of men and women, &gt;&gt; young people, we have a source. &gt;&gt; We may have need of healing. the doctors haven't been able to resolve it and medication hasn't been able to really bring a a complete healing to it. Uh but we have a remedy and we have one. We have a physician. Sometimes these phrases just become all too common to us. But we have someone and we've had some very stubborn uh uh afflictions that have been here in the congregation and I want to declare openly that as far as Calvar's concerned those things are broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan's power is defeated &gt;&gt; and I think we need to come tonight with an unity of spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. throughout this entire congregation. Even if you feel 100%, I feel fine, but I'm burdened for it. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to see people afflicted when they don't need to be afflicted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel like we need to go on the war path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to go on the offensive. &gt;&gt; We need to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have questions that just nagging questions. uh about our lives. Well, we have one who's a dissolver of doubts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have one who's a discerner in the thoughts of the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Right? I was reading in in one of the messages this morning and uh you know I was just reading some of the prayer line at the end of one of the services and I just thought United States has has had a son born in Kentucky and that nation's going to have an awful lot to answer for. &gt;&gt; That's right. I thought they have never had one rise out of the soil of that nation that did these things. And when we got in the car, I just said to my wife, just start at paragraph 170 and keep reading while I drive while I drive to church. And I just kept thinking about that. Wherever whenever did that ever happen in 200 years history of United States? Never. And God's going to call those leaders up. He's going to call those presidents up and ask them in the judgment, "What did you do with that?" &gt;&gt; And here we are today, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And this message has gone to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he and and and we're so we're so privileged &gt;&gt; that it came and God gave us a heart. There was something in us that said would say yes to that. &gt;&gt; Amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bypassed our reasoning and just said amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I give myself to that &gt;&gt; wholly and completely. I can tell you friends that would be the highest calling that that I can think of. &gt;&gt; What we have available to us. You know, a person may possess certain abilities and certain skills. And I'm just talking to you and it's kind of a prelude to the service or the message. But we have here a a wide variety of abilities and talents and gifts and uh you know resources and skills amongst the people. I was thinking of you that are teachers in the school and I was thinking of the principal or brother Terry Tatch and the other staff members that work there. I want to just give a word right from the very depths of my heart to this congregation and to those of you that work in the school. I want to say to the teachers that is not a teaching job. That is a ministry. &gt;&gt; It's first a ministry. I want to say to the students that happen to go to this school, uh if you are privileged and are able to go to the school or have been able to go to the school, you have either sat under a ministry or are sitting under a ministry. That is a calling and it should not be compared with other other jobs or similar jobs in the world. The world is on another planet &gt;&gt; and we're on another planet. We're according to this scripture, we are in a heavenly place. &gt;&gt; We're in another dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I want to encourage the teachers do not look on it as just another profession. &gt;&gt; It's far more than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Far more than that. &gt;&gt; I just sometimes the world is so invasive &gt;&gt; that it wants to uh make comparisons. &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. There's no comparison with the world. There's no comparison with what they cha teach and there's no comparison with the spirit that is to be in this school as compared to that school or this church as compared to other churches. There is to be made no comparison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's no comparison with the message. &gt;&gt; There's no similar message. And if we go back to Jesus Christ when he was revealing the invisible God to the people, he was he was in another world. &gt;&gt; He was in another world. This message did not come to us from any teaching, any learning of man. &gt;&gt; It's a divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And friends, we're going to wade through this thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until this becomes a reality to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just give a couple of quotes here. I'm going to have you just while you're still sitting to read these with me. What does the vine do? It furnishes energy to the branches. Is that right? And the branches bear the fruit. Our hands are his hands. Our eyes are his eyes. Our life is his life. &gt;&gt; He puts his life in us. &gt;&gt; Now you folks believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you compare that with something else? &gt;&gt; We live the life that he would live if he was here on earth in a physical form. &gt;&gt; And while the body is sitting at the right hand of God making intercession for us all the time. Oh, isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; That just knocks all the kinks out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like everybody to say that phrase with me. That just knocks all the kinks out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knocks all the kinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; To me, he said to to me, it is it just makes it so real. &gt;&gt; Amen. There should be in my thought that if we have Zoey, God's life in us, we become sons of God and and amateur creators because he said, "Whatever you say, believe that what you say you shall have." And I've noticed that a lot of times I'd say things that I couldn't hardly think myself, but I'd say it anyhow. I come to find out it did happen just that way. I'd say things that I didn't hardly didn't mean for it to happen that way, but it did anyhow because I'd said it. A man could not heal the sick because it doesn't lay within a man's power to heal sick people. A doctor does not heal the sick. He only gives aid to the sick. God heals all the sickness. Amen. &gt;&gt; A doctor can set an arm if you broke it or sew up a place if you had cut it or move a tooth if it's bad or appendix out. But he cannot heal the place it come out of. Healing is a multiplication of cells that grows and mens and its life does that. Its life does that. And God is life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says that's in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be thinking about while I speak this morning about what's in you. And I want to speak on the subject as his custom was. But the context of the service, the context of the message is the law within. We might say and you've heard Christ is in you and healing is in you and all these various things are in you but I want to define it and bring it much more succinctly if I can. A law is in you &gt;&gt; and a law these are the laws of God &gt;&gt; and all we need to do is appropriate them. You may stand if you would please and turn to Luke's Gospel the 4th chapter. Just before we read, we'll have a moment of prayer. Almighty God, how gracious you are. You have gathered this group of people that is that are here today. Others will be connected streaming and into their room into their homes into the place where they are perhaps a group of people together and whatever wherever we have gathered Lord and whatever is in our hearts or minds at this time. I pray, oh God, creator of heavens and earth and giver of every good gift, you'll take supreme control of every mind and every thought and bring everyone into subjection, Lord, &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God, what you have in in mind for this moment, for this service, Lord, and may it be accomplished. Let it be achieved, oh God. Let this day be a blessed day in your presence, I pray. And now anoint us for service Lord that your will shall be done and your name will be glorified in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Starting at the 14th verse. And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into into Galilee. And there went out a fame of him through all the region roundabout. And he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. Jesus was a man who I have pondered upon him uh deeply because we are so worship him and honor him. But he was a man as I read the scripture that was intently observing uh what was happening around him outside. And besides that, I believe that he also was uh also looked very deeply within himself because in this account that we just have here, and I'm I'm going to probably labor for a little while, just getting your minds into the same channel that I've been pondering for a few weeks now. He he read a certain scripture. He read the scripture and he opened up the scroll of Isaiah and he the Bible says and when he had opened the book, you can just see him opening the book and then he's going through the scroll looking for the place because he was seeking the place that was matching what was in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew he knew that he was supposed to be there for that moment, but he was looking for a scripture that referred to him. And we have made the phrase in the past and we've heard it by other ministers, the word was looking in the word for the word for that very moment. So that because he needed to say this day is this scripture fulfilled. So he couldn't find any other place. He had to find that place. He was the He was the manifestation. He was the living manifestation of that word. The people were looking upon him. The Bible says that they they looked upon him and they marveled at the words that he was speaking. But now uh uh it was the Bible says that it was his custom. Uh he he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. This wasn't his first time in the synagogue. Uh this Jesus Christ is still presently living because he he he it's eternal life. He's living in his people. And we say he's living in his bride. He's living in his body. You are his body. &gt;&gt; You've come to church before. You've come you as as you have been accustomed to. You've come here. The last time I spoke, I spoke on tradition and less they make a tradition of a prophet's life. He said they made a tradition of the people's life. And I want to by God's help to bring a very clear distinction even though it is a little bit difficult, but a clear distinction between tradition and custom. And I think it'll be startling for you as well. But his custom of going to the synagogue to read the word, he was that word in waiting. So I want to put that phrase in your mind. A word in waiting. &gt;&gt; The word was in him, but it was waiting for that moment. &gt;&gt; Uh because and and we have some quotes of what is in you. The life of God is in you. Zoe is in you. And we can say all those things. But I believe that believers, believers of this message of all people in the world need to be introspective. We need to look very deeply within ourselves. &gt;&gt; Uh contemplatively we need to look and contemplate and meditate. Why am I here? Why did God bring this message to me? Why has he revealed that this is the living Christ? &gt;&gt; Why is this so set apart from everything else? &gt;&gt; Why in fact is this a message that is hated? &gt;&gt; Its standards are hated. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that he was hated in the world and you will be. &gt;&gt; We never can garnish this up with tradition and make it acceptable. &gt;&gt; It's not an acceptable gospel with the world. And we cannot homogenize it with the with the thoughts of the world. It just will not mix. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are here this morning and we've come to the house of worship as our custom is and I want to declare we are we have not gathered here as our tradition and I don't want to ever have it um made a tradition uh as his custom was in the uh in the Greek it's really quite simple and this may sound laborious just for a little bit. But please hang keep your thought conscience right there as as his custom was or as his manner was. This was the manner of life. Now you you that are young people, young families, you'd say, "Well, I know my my children or grandchildren or yours, we'd say, well, I am here." Now I'm speaking directly to some of you young people say I am here because this is where my parents brought me. This is this is what we do. I go to church Sunday morning. That's fine. Must go deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Must mean something more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus I'm I'm telling you now I'm making a complete comparison. Jesus went there when he was a young boy. &gt;&gt; He went there because he was accustomed to going there. That was his manner of going there. But he was not going to the synagogue simply to go to the synagogue. There was something within him that was causing him to attend to go because he knew from what was within him. And I need you to look within today. I need you to look why has God done these things. What is it that he placed? We've heard now. We've heard if I can just tie these things together. I just said a few moments ago that there never has been a message. You've heard that. Never has been a message like this. But then why would God take that message and that messenger and touch your life &gt;&gt; if there wasn't another purpose to it? &gt;&gt; So we're not here simply because somebody brought us here or somebody introduced us. There's nothing special about the building or about the name or about anything else. What's special is Christ who is the word who touched your life and my life. &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference. And we're not here because people come here or that we came here last Sunday or last year or for the last 20 or 30 years. That has nothing to do with it. We do it because as we look inwardly, we are absolutely thoroughly convinced that this is something beyond this world, this town, beyond this Pacific Northwest, beyond these nations. This is something that's eternal that came from heaven. &gt;&gt; Came from God &gt;&gt; and came here to collect us, &gt;&gt; came here to call us, &gt;&gt; came here with a special calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not just an educational call or a call to some kind of a a special profession and and we we find that uh that's why I made mention of the teachers and so on uh of the school. It's not just a school. Listen friends, when when as far as the natural is concerned, there are people who had particular talents or skills in their life as they grew up as young people. It takes someone who's I won't just say qualified, but it takes someone who is is very perceptive and they look at another person or they see a child, they see a young person and they they they can identify certain qualities. They identify certain skills that even the individual themselves don't know that they have. But those skills need to be identified. Those skills need to be cultivated. Those skills finally need to uh the person who possesses them has to finally realize I must give myself to this. This is going to require time. This is going to require years. And friends, listen, I'm not just talking to some humans now. I'm talking to some bornagain spiritual beings. and we will identify some human natural skills and give the next 10, 12, 15 years to it. &gt;&gt; Look into yourself today and see what God deposited in you and what this gospel has cost and that we ought to look on every day. And that we ought to give ourselves that we ought to allow the great teacher the Holy Spirit to cultivate in us and shape us according to this word according to the message that he sent us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as his custom was this is his this was his manner of life. Jesus was not just going up to the synagogue because he had been taught that way. This custom was in fact I like to use this term a life force in him. It was a life force within him. And that's why I'm calling it the law within. You have a law within you. and we're going to be speaking about it. There was another power that was directing him. A custom is not the same as a tradition. Why is this important? Why am I saying that this morning? Why is it important? Because they are very similar. and brother Brandham. Furthermore, I wouldn't I I wouldn't even have the time. And listen, friends, I'm not going to I'm not going to shy away from saying what he said, &gt;&gt; but he he literally blasted &gt;&gt; the denominational system. And we may say, well, Methodist, Presbyterian, you know, denominations and Pentecost and whatever more. He says, every move of God denominated and died. &gt;&gt; And he literally spoke of traditions hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. &gt;&gt; That's right. And a tradition is something that is handed down from one to the other. So it's almost like he went to the synagogue as his custom was. It's so very very similar and yet it is very different. A tradition is a long and I'm not speaking on tradition but a tradition is a long established action or pattern of behavior. I don't cut my hair or I dress this way. I live this way. We speak this way because we're believers. Well, is it is it just because we're believers? What is it that you believe? &gt;&gt; Uh is it that you believe that this is this is what we're taught? This is what our parents have taught us. This is what the church this is what the message says. Well, it needs to go a little bit further than that. It needs to go and say, "This is what's inside." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a law from within. Amen. &gt;&gt; I do this because I can't do anything other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We had just a few words yesterday just speaking together with Tom and Joanne drop by. Uh we were just sitting around. I've pondered this a whole lot. As I got older, I think about my youth and uh you know, Sister Biscll, this might surprise you, but Sister Biscll, she skated very, very well when she was uh in her teens. and uh she was going to fancy skate do fancy skating with a with another girl as a partner. Okay. And I've seen her skate. She was a excellent skater. So she's going to fancy skate. Now this is a Pentecostal pastor. Not a not a Pentecostal denomination. We didn't care about denomination. But a new pastor had come in and he just said to her, he said, "Do you think that that's what a Christian girl should do?" He said it like that. That was the end. You know what she did? She they they were they they were all practiced up for a carnival and she was going to skate as part of the program of the city carnival. She dropped right out. She left the girl high and dry. &gt;&gt; Do you think it was that preacher? He didn't pound her. He didn't try and bring her under deep condemnation for, you know, you skating and you listening to the music and all of this and it's all part. He didn't give her a great big lesson. She didn't have to go to camp. &gt;&gt; I so appreciate Wednesday night, but I I I don't want you to get any conflict. She didn't even have to come to the altar. &gt;&gt; There was a law within. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all it took was that word. She didn't have a prophet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Didn't have a messenger. didn't have the kind of ministry that you sit under. &gt;&gt; Didn't have the word revealed to her. &gt;&gt; I want you, you can have all of these things. You can have all these messages and have all this preaching and have all of these things taking on and be moved and moved and moved, but you need to look not what's happening outside. You need to look inside. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to try to have you look within. Say, do I have that seed? &gt;&gt; If I have that seed, then you have the law of God in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that will keep you in all the storms of life and all the turmoil and all the testing and all the friends. My friends, friends, friends. I had friends. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; I had good friends. &gt;&gt; In fact, as you talk about, oh, well, when you live, so hey, I lived when drugs were just being introduced. and good friends and they wanted to go that way. I had good friends that they they drank all the time, you know, they'd have have a beer, you know, it was just a social thing to do. Good friends. Somehow &gt;&gt; I just couldn't relate to it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the church that held me. It wasn't Christian friends that held me. It wasn't a tradition that held me. I'm here today to say there's a law within and you need to look into your soul and see that law that there's a law of God. It's a law of life. It's a law of eternal life. It's not being persuaded. It's not being moved by anything. It is a looking and saying, "I'm not a part of that. I don't even know why I'm not a part of it. I don't relate to it. It doesn't relate to me. I must be of another breed. And when Satan would come and say, "You're not a believer." I'd say, "So, uh, I don't know what I am then &gt;&gt; because I know I'm not you. &gt;&gt; I know I'm not that. I'm not part of the beer crowd. I'm not part of the sports crowd. I'm not part of the world crowd. I'm not part of the money crowd. I'm not part of all this success crowd. I'm not part of all this intelligencia. I'm not a part of anything else that I see out there. So, I'm really an oddball. &gt;&gt; There's a law within. &gt;&gt; And I want you to look deep to that law within. I want you to be introspective and and have a look and be perceptive of what you have inside. &gt;&gt; Tell you what you determine. &gt;&gt; Amen. If anybody would have come around and said, "You're not the son of Fred Biscllow." I could have told them to your face, "You're a liar." &gt;&gt; And when Satan comes around says, "You're not a believer." &gt;&gt; You can say, "You're a liar. &gt;&gt; I happen to have a law within &gt;&gt; that's declaring that I am indeed a believer." [Music] Amen. like you to notice how a denomination or a brand for a person to say as we said I want to give explanation to it just to say well I I'm an I'm a message I'm in the message or I'm a believer it has to go deeper than that &gt;&gt; it has to it has to rise up from the fact that you say I have a law within me &gt;&gt; yes sir I'm different because I have a law within me. I can't even explain that. &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't go into the synagogue that day and say, "Well, now folks, this is a different meeting. This is a different kind of a meeting. I I have something within me and and and I'm going to identify this." No, he didn't he didn't pull any punches. He just read the scripture and all the eyes were fastened on him. He stopped. He started at the right place. He stopped at the right place and then declared this day is the scripture fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends on the authority of the message that has come. This day the me the seals have been opened. &gt;&gt; This day God has deposited in a believer an incredible deposit. And we need to look into that deposit. This deposit is not some books on the shelf. &gt;&gt; This deposit is not a disc on an iPod. This deposit goes far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That on the shelf or that on a disc or whatever more only came to identify something that you can relate to. &gt;&gt; Say this has always been there and now I'm discovering what is there. &gt;&gt; I happen to possess that. &gt;&gt; Now this has come to identify it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon spoke about He said maybe a fine Jewish man going down the road with his fatted bullock or a lamb under his arm on the day of the atonement and to offer it for his sin. And he was sincere when he killed that lamb. See, this was a custom. He did it before, &gt;&gt; but he was sincere when he took his lamb and he killed the lamb and the priest stabbed it and he held his hands on it knowing that the life was taken to save his life. And he was sincere in it. And as long as he was sincere, it was all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the time come &gt;&gt; when it became a family tradition. &gt;&gt; So it was there's and there's the dividing line. It was a it as his custom was and he'd take his lamb and he was sincere and see the priest having to slay that lamb and stab it and see the blood and see the thing quiver and him holding his hand on the head according to the word and it never would leave him. But then finally, you know, as time went on, as long as he was sincere with it, we're coming to the Lord's table tonight. You've done it before. This is our custom. But we we are we are coming as his custom was, not as his tradition was. And we take that bread. Say this is the body of the Lord &gt;&gt; broken for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm going to eat it. It's going to be assimilated into my body. I'm doing this as a testimony and a witness that even the broken bread of the Lord that has come in this generation, the world crucified it again, &gt;&gt; but I'm partaking of it. &gt;&gt; And I'm testifying by this that the life of this the life of this w life is in me &gt;&gt; and the law of this life is in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; A custom can be something that people always do or always do in a particular way and that's how we have are coming to this. But truth is more than just handing down doctrines or instruction for life. If the Holy Spirit of God does not confirm these words by a lifegiving force, then all the preaching is in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In birth pains said, if the Holy Ghost has made you a promise, the Holy Ghost has got to keep that promise. If it's really God, &gt;&gt; if uh if a man comes through and says a certain thing and God does not back it up, &gt;&gt; it isn't scripture to begin with, &gt;&gt; forget it. &gt;&gt; So, you can have all, you know, we we can have all the uh right uh jargon, the right words, the right phrases. It's got to be more than the right phrases. Gotta be more than the right dress. &gt;&gt; Gotta be more than the right association. Has to go beyond that. &gt;&gt; I am not questioning at all that you even some of you that may have struggled and some of you that have been up and down and a lot of you that perhaps were praying here at the altar on Wednesday night. I don't deny for a moment that there aren't some needs or you've had questions or you've had something else and that you are identifying it. But I want you to identify something else this morning. I want you to look deep inside. I want you to come to a conclusion and Satan will not bring you to this conclusion. And the conclusion is I want you to ask yourself some questions. I want you to answer those questions. Why did I respond? What was it that I responded to and why did I respond when this message came by my way? &gt;&gt; Answer that. If you answered and said, "Well, it just sounded right and I was it was my friends and so on so forth." Then you got a ways to go. &gt;&gt; But if you say, "Well, I only did it because I was forced to do it or my parents made me do it or or my friends or relatives or whatever more," then you've got a distance to go. But if you can say something something actually happened, a light, something happened inside. Something was illuminated. I saw the scripture. I saw it. I saw myself. It was it was a reality. It was real to me. And it has been real to me. And I know even though all the obstacles and all the trouble and whatever more, we're not even not even worried about it. &gt;&gt; I just say forget it. &gt;&gt; Forget all the problem. Forget all the exterior. I want you to look inside. Now &gt;&gt; if we all look outside, have we all got a problem or do obstacle or something? We all do. &gt;&gt; You do. I do. The one sitting next to you does. We all have our certain batch of problems. We all have our baggage. &gt;&gt; Stop looking outside and look inside for a while. &gt;&gt; While I was away, I thought of a lot of a lot of the families here, you know, families. And you've got grown children, you got grown young people, and maybe have it brought you disappointments. And if you just keep looking at the outside, some have financial problems, some have this who hasn't got problems. Everybody has problems. So if we continue to look at that, it will weaken us. &gt;&gt; But if you look inside, &gt;&gt; if you look within &gt;&gt; and say, "This law of God, &gt;&gt; this seed that God put in me has a law in that life, &gt;&gt; and that law will not stop speaking. That law will not stop drawing me. &gt;&gt; That law will not stop confirming &gt;&gt; who I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we may say, you know, well, and I'm going to come to it in a few moments. Brother Bram talks about the law. He said the fish has a law &gt;&gt; and that the fish was born that way. &gt;&gt; You had a law by the new birth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how many in this audience have been born again? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are testifying. You are stating that I have a law because there's no life without some kind of law. Even a fish has a law. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says he doesn't have to say, "Well, now I'm just going to go up and get some oxygen and and and and and try to make this law work and go down to the bottom of the sea." No, he said he can go down there because it depresses himself and he can go down where you can't go and kill you, but the fish is just fine. &gt;&gt; Just hold on because I have a couple of things to say about it. He says, "And then the bird, the bird has confidence in his wings. God gave him wings &gt;&gt; and he has a law. He can manage the air. He can manage the currents. &gt;&gt; I watched the yesterday, I guess it was, we took a a short walk uh down at down a white rock and the wind was blowing incredible and the waves were high and it was hard to even walk into it. And then and and I I I look at a seagull right beside me and and he's he's he's actually flying without flapping his wings wings. He's flying into the wind. And I just looked at them. I marveled. And And then you just take a little wave like this, you know, and then make some more. And he could fly faster without flopping his wings. And I could walk into the wind. And he's going into the wind. And I'm going into the wind. I thought, "Wow, I wish I could catch his secret, but I'm just not that kind of a bird." &gt;&gt; But you have a law. He has a law within him. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even trying. He wasn't educated. He not depending on a bunch of friends. &gt;&gt; Not depending on a church. &gt;&gt; He not depending on a brand name. I'm a I'm a I'm a seagull &gt;&gt; or I'm an eagle or whatever more. He just does it. He just does it because the law's in him &gt;&gt; and he gives himself and surrenders himself to that law and flies into the wind. &gt;&gt; Flies right into the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't see any out there fretting and squawking and yelling. They do that mostly when they have some food around. But I don't see any squawking. Say, I just wish I just got to run faster. I've got to I've got to, you know, I I've got to fly faster. why I'm not getting down here. No, they just, you know, they just go with it. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the people say, well, it's more vile. It's more wicked. And it may get the age you're living in may get far more wicked and things according to the scripture shall, and I want you to say, "Amen. They shall wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; But you have a law within you &gt;&gt; that can handle any storm." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you need more than this message to tell you that you need to look inside yourself. &gt;&gt; Say, well, I go through this kind of I'm going through an emotional upheaval. Well, don't look at the emotional upheaval. You need to look at what you got inside. &gt;&gt; You need to be able to say and say what the prophet said. He says things sometimes he couldn't quite understand, but he said it anyway. &gt;&gt; And then he found out it worked. You need to say, "I have a law within me that can handle this situation. &gt;&gt; I have a law within me that's going to carry me through this. &gt;&gt; I can't see daylight, but this law inside of me says it shall come to light." &gt;&gt; The law within. &gt;&gt; And that's why you're here in church. &gt;&gt; That's why it's your custom to come to church. This isn't your tradition to come to church. It's your custom to come to church. It's not a tradition that we'll have the Lord's table. It's our custom. But there's something within says I'm going to drive from Tacoma and be there because I am there. Yes, I've done it as a custom, but I'm there because there's a law inside there. And that law, I have a desire. &gt;&gt; I have a desire. I have a hunger. &gt;&gt; I want to be with God's people. I want a fellowship. &gt;&gt; This is going to come now a little bit from left field. You have to jar and I've had I've had a good deal of my own complications with it because our terminology we get so tunnel vision &gt;&gt; it's hard to break loose out of that tunnel vision of our terminology &gt;&gt; as is custom was the word custom and Jesus incidentally this is just in Luke the 4th chapter Jesus understood very clearly from the Old Testament what a custom was. Now, I'll just get you to think a wee bit. Many of you came across the border today and you have the immigration down there and you have customs. The custom, the custom actually is in the judicial sense. It was his custom. Judicial. Judicial is law. He went to the synagogue as was his custom. There was a law in him &gt;&gt; causing him to keep that appointment. And there isn't anybody who crosses the border but what you have to deal with the customs &gt;&gt; and they want to ask right away did you buy anything. Do you have anything that requires a payment a custom that just to incline your thoughts that way we want to take it further and I hope I don't lose you custom. There's several terms of it, but it is a judgment or justice. It's an act of deciding a case. Now, for those of you stay with me or listening real nice, just hold on close. It's an act of deciding a case. It's a place, a court, or a seat of judgment. And it comes from a second word and we're in the Hebrew to judge or to govern or to vindicate, to prove or to act as a lawgiver. Brother Brandham called Jesus a lawgiver. Now he comes into the synagogue as his custom. He must go there. There's a law within him. &gt;&gt; And this law within him now is going to say some incredible things that have never been said in the synagogue before. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the custom now is due. It's time &gt;&gt; for this to be spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right? &gt;&gt; If you come to the border, I don't want to dwell on that too much, but you come to the border that you've arrived. &gt;&gt; The moment is then, &gt;&gt; you may have bought something, you know, long before, but now is the time &gt;&gt; when things have to be coped with. &gt;&gt; And so now he comes to he comes to the uh uh here he comes the lawgiver himself coming to a moment. He he is a he is a a judge and a governor and and now there's a statute and an ordin ordinance. In fact is the Hebrew word comes also from a third a third foundation word and this one is absolutely fulfilled. It says that it is an ordinance prescribed task. It's a pre. And when we say prescribed, you think of prescription or something that's prescribed. Something that's prescribed has been pre-written. &gt;&gt; And now he comes to the synagogue as his custom was. He's the lawgiver. And now he's going to look through something that was prescribed. &gt;&gt; And he finds the prescription. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's the answer to the prescription. &gt;&gt; So he comes now as his custom was &gt;&gt; and he because this is a judicial thing. This isn't to make people feel good. This isn't even to make them happy. This isn't even to make them healed. This is to make an announcement. I am here because something was prescribed of this event. &gt;&gt; And I've looked into where it was written and I have found the place and now I will read the prescription. &gt;&gt; All of you have been uh to a doctor perhaps you got a prescription and then you'll go to somebody you perhaps can't even understand what was written. It's a mystery to you. But you get in front of someone who understands it, a pharmacist, and they will read the prescription. They will read that chicken scratch, and it means something to them, and they will hand you some medication, and you take the medication, and wa wa, you feel better &gt;&gt; or worse, whichever is the case. But he opened up the scripture and he found the place and he began to read the prescription. The spirit of the Lord is upon me &gt;&gt; because he has anointed me to heal the sick &gt;&gt; to cast out the devils &gt;&gt; and to bring deliverance to them that are in prison. &gt;&gt; The prescription &gt;&gt; prescribed &gt;&gt; and now he of whom it was written is standing there making the announcement. My brother, my sister, that's what this message is. This message isn't something we just come and keep and we dress a certain way or we speak a certain way or we worship a certain way. The message is the life of God in his word that causes us. And so we look in the word and we find it was prescribed. &gt;&gt; It was written in Malachi, &gt;&gt; "Behold, &gt;&gt; I send my messenger. Behold, I send you Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord prescribed. But we can say this day, that scripture has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This day stands evidence that that word has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This word, &gt;&gt; this day, &gt;&gt; this is a testimony. This people have heard that word by that Elijah. And we stand here and are seated here and worship here as evidence that that has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And furthermore that we are here with the same law of the same God who prescribed it. I am here now in as the fulfillment of that word. Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; This is our custom. &gt;&gt; Isaiah said in another place 49:16, God speaking, "Behold, I have graven thee. I've inscribed thee upon the palms of my hands, and thy walls are continually before me. I'll tell you what, friends. Go back with me for a moment. Jesus, the word in him. Who would dare even say for a moment, the word wasn't in him? He was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the living word is walking in flesh &gt;&gt; very very unceremoniously &gt;&gt; without displaying any great human skills or abilities or talents. He hadn't had some great meetings yet. But he calls and he sees some very lowly people just fishermen &gt;&gt; just bluecollar workers and less That's right. &gt;&gt; And fastened his eyes on one said, "Follow me." I want to declare to you today with every ounce of strength that's in my body, &gt;&gt; every ounce to believe the word of God. It was the law &gt;&gt; of God in them &gt;&gt; that caused them to drop their net, &gt;&gt; leave their father, &gt;&gt; leave their livelihood. Where are you going? I don't know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in the future? I have no idea what I'm going to do in the future. &gt;&gt; Why are you going to achieve something I don't know and I'm not interested. &gt;&gt; How am I going to live? I don't know. But I know one thing. There's a law in me that says I must follow this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Young and old, I'm saying to you today, I don't know how the word came to you. I don't know how the call came to you, but something happened inside. And if that's what happened inside, I must follow this. &gt;&gt; Then I say to you, thus sayith the Lord, you have a law inside of you. And that law has a life. &gt;&gt; That law will keep you whether you're a few or whether you're many. And but Jesus had identified in these men. He identified certain things and as time went on and they went through terrible terrible times. I would quite frankly I would like to be Peter on the day of Pentecost but I wouldn't want to to be him just 60 days two months earlier just two months before &gt;&gt; when he cursed. I don't know what he cursed. &gt;&gt; Said I don't know this man. I'm not part of this group. Even while they, you know, the world is very cunning. Said, "Yeah, but your language, you're saying things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes you sound like a believer. &gt;&gt; You sound like those people. He denied him. &gt;&gt; I don't know him. &gt;&gt; Even then, he had that law in him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Even then, &gt;&gt; even in that failure, &gt;&gt; he had that law in him. &gt;&gt; I don't care about your failures. I'm interested in you looking inside. And you need to say, I have that law in me. And that law is greater than any dismal failure. That law is greater than any circumstance. That law is greater than my backsliden children. That law is greater than any sickness. &gt;&gt; That law is greater. I have that law &gt;&gt; inside. &gt;&gt; You may not be in it just yet. Some of you perhaps are. You've come through very, very heavy waters. But all listen beloved friends there's a place just across the veil. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you 5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 seconds, one sec. One second. On the other side, you're going to do one or two things. Listen to me, young man. I'm talking to you. One second. One, it's gone. You're going to either rejoice &gt;&gt; in such bliss. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's one thing we all have in common. &gt;&gt; There's not a person here. But what's going to go beyond that veil? &gt;&gt; We're going to pass beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; And there's only two places to go. &gt;&gt; As brother Tom preached on Wednesday night, there's only two places to go. &gt;&gt; There's no in between. There's heaven and there's hell. &gt;&gt; And it speaks of it spoke of the place Jesus spoke about it a lot. He spoke about it more than he did about heaven where there's weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. And I don't need to interpret that. All I have, the law in me says I don't want to go there. &gt;&gt; The law in me says I wasn't even made for that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody that arrives at a place as though they feel like, you know, I'm okay. I don't need any cleansing. I don't need any forgiveness. I don't need any mercy. I don't. We all do. That's one of the first things. That's why I came to that part before the service this morning because I came in prayer and I just say, "I'm so glad, Father, that I have a place, &gt;&gt; we're cleansing. &gt;&gt; There isn't anything in the world, there's no physician, there's no specialist, there's no smart person, there's nobody that can provide this kind of cleansing that we need. There's no one that knows how to take this piece of clay and mold it. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that has the hands. &gt;&gt; And I want to surrender myself. I want to I want to put myself I want to just place myself on the potter's wheel &gt;&gt; and mold it whatever you want it to be. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, I don't even know, you know, just what all to say on this subject. There's so much is not just out there, but so much in my heart to be said. I'll be a few more minutes if that's all right. Brother Benham said there's a law that's given amongst everything. Amongst everything there's a law. The bird has a law and the fish has a law. I'm taking this very slowly. There was a law in Christ. I don't believe that. I don't believe there's a person here. There isn't a person here that'll be foolish enough to deny that there was a law that was in Christ. &gt;&gt; This is not another phrase. It's a part of that same phrase. And he said that laws in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a law in Christ and that laws in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. that law. God has a law and his word is the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is all out of the restoration of the bride tree. And he goes and he says, "If Satan has robbed you, Satan has robbed I think all of us at some point in time." And you may be in that situation right now. We say, "I've had a robbery. I had a breakin." He said, ' If Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God, and there were a lot that were praying here Wednesday night, I don't know your heart, but I'm speaking to this congregation today and many that perhaps are not even here. And if you're seated here and go and Satan has actually robbed you of being a son or daughter of God, now I take his words and imply it and say it directly to you. You have a right. Now you can you can disregard the right if you want to and then suffer the consequences, &gt;&gt; but you have a right. You have a right this morning, he said by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to enforce the claim of God. You can't enforce the claim unless there is a claim. You can't enforce something that is not a it's because this this custom that you've come here. You didn't just come to church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You didn't come and just sing some songs. &gt;&gt; That's not what this is all about. &gt;&gt; This is a legal process. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This is a custom in the legal sense. &gt;&gt; I am here to determine if there's something that is that should I should obtain that I have not obtained. I need to know if there is something that is rightfully mine. &gt;&gt; Hello friends. &gt;&gt; Is there something that's rightfully mine and I'm living below that standard? Then the prophet of God has said you have a right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if that's the word of God, then there's a law behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can enforce that law. &gt;&gt; And you that are afflicted physically and not so much physically, but you that are afflicted physically, I want to nail this down. I want you to say to yourself, as the prophet would say, I have a right. &gt;&gt; I have a right to be delivered and healed from this affliction. Amen. Someone might be out of harmony, out of fellowship with God and living below the standard say I I don't have this and the what is the reason then if I said what was the reason and asked you in the study what was the reason you perhaps could give me a whole series of things that are on the exterior It would ball be on the exterior on outside. &gt;&gt; You say well because of this and this happened &gt;&gt; and that was said &gt;&gt; and and this took place and now I I developed and came into this set of circumstances and it has taken me down. Of course it has taken you down. It will take us all down. It takes me down. If I can only think of things that are on the outside, think of things that have happened or things that are happening or whatever. My friends, &gt;&gt; it's not simple. It's not perhaps the easiest thing, but you need to look inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, how do I do that? Contemplate it. &gt;&gt; Ponder it. &gt;&gt; Go and sit in your chair. sit by yourself &gt;&gt; and ponder &gt;&gt; what was in the purpose and the mind of God. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at some of you that have been birthed into a into a into a believing house in a believing home. And you may be thinking about, you know, uh well, this was okay for my father, my mother. This was okay for my parents. This was okay for other people in the church. And then well then get reduce it down to the bottom line. And if you're cold and indifferent today, I want you to reduce it down to the bottom line. Am I a Judas? Now we're really getting squeaky tight. &gt;&gt; Am I a Judas? Am I a betrayer? Am I an abselum? Am I a son of predition? Look inside. &gt;&gt; In the heart of hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I destined for separation from God? &gt;&gt; Am I destined for hell? Is the rich man going to be my partner? Am I going to look up say Abraham Abraham or somebody come and cool? Dip your finger and cool. I'm in I'm in this torment. He said &gt;&gt; now either Jesus is a liar or you're a liar. That's right. &gt;&gt; I hate to say that &gt;&gt; Jesus was truth. And there is such a place. &gt;&gt; And there are people that will go there. &gt;&gt; But did you come to this service today as a tradition to end up there? I say no. &gt;&gt; Because why you say why can you have such confidence, brother Biscll? I know that God didn't call me here to preach to a bunch of serpent seed. I know that you're sons and daughters of God. And it is my duty to say the reason you're here is because there's a law inside of you. And that law is the law of God. That law is the law of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And people need to identify that. &gt;&gt; There are many people, you know, it happens all the time. Michael, he's not here. Probably upstairs. Michael Ray, you know, he has taken studies and tried to advance himself in in the medical field. He loved the medical field. He just wanted to be a doctor and he was he wanted to follow the medical profession and he's taken many many many courses and has uh has gained some quite some knowledge and could have a job in that field but he feels a call to be here. One of the one of the classes of the courses he was taken required that he have 12 weeks of practicum which happened to take place and the place he had to take it was at the Edmonton uh Edmonton is it Edmonton Jubilee or Edmonton it was the main hospital up in Edmonton and so he's doing because he's becoming you know taking nursing and everything and so on and they the people who are in charge heart said, "Michael, you're wasting your time. You're a doctor. You're a doctor. You're wasting your time doing this. You're a doctor." So, they were identifying certain skills and talents and so on and so forth. But that just he didn't feel led to do that whether it's not now or whatever. Brother Brham is not here. Uh, excuse me. But I I said to brother Brandham when we were together, just the two of us, I said, "Brother Brandom, if you ever see anything in my life, you know, if you ever see anything in my life that I was thinking in terms of something that would hinder me, something that was wrong, some weakness, I said, you know, I I sure would want you to tell me." And he and he just said, "Yeah, oh, Brother Eddie, I I certainly would. You know, he hasn't shown me anything, but if he did, I sure would tell you." And I guess kind of waited, you know, maybe for that time and something might come up and uh it it didn't happen that way. But you know the greatest honor that brother Brandham could give to me personally and give to you personally the same thing cuz one is he never said anything special to me along that line. But the greatest one is that something that God would speak out of his mouth and would do the same thing for you that it does for me and for this person here and that person there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that the Lord Jesus could say out of that message what say put it I'll put it in my words. He's saying come follow me &gt;&gt; and I will make you fishers of men. He will make you what he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; How will he do it? The law is in you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's a law within you, friends. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That would be another another moment. I'm laying a lot of this aside because I've been a great deal in the message the unveiling of God and I would recommend to this congregation if you take and perhaps read the unveiling of God again after this service. But in the unveiling of God, he begins to refer to who is this great person. Now, I'm not digressing from what I've said just now. Just hold it for a moment, but I would like to I would like to bring this to you by the help of God. We've talked about the law, the law of God, the law of life, and so on so forth. But can I take you a step further? Who I'm really talking about as a person? When we get to speak about law and judicial things, it it becomes kind of, you know, kind of something that's out there. But now I want to say that this is a person. And brother Brandham is talking about Abraham and he says he's speaking like on Abraham's behalf. He said, "Who is this great person? Who is this great unseen person? Who is this that Abraham seen? He seen visions." In other words, he had experiences. And right at the last, though he was manifested in flesh, before the son of God came, God himself came to Abraham in the form of a man at the end time manifested. He saw him in a little light one time. He saw him in visions. He heard his voice. Many revelations, but just before the promised son, he saw him in the form of a man and talk to him and and fed him meat and drank. And notice God himself veiled in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Children, saints of God, &gt;&gt; this is where we have come to. where you've come to a time and I could take you for the rest of the day and I won't I won't won't even tire you with it. But if this message has produced anything, if this message has declared anything, it has declared through this same mouth that not only God in flesh come to Abraham, God in flesh has come to his Abraham's children. And one of the greatest revelations that you could have &gt;&gt; is that the law of God which I've been speaking of now I want to convert it and say the person &gt;&gt; this person &gt;&gt; who has spoken &gt;&gt; this person who called me this person is visible in the flesh of his body &gt;&gt; called abide the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and this world This world is our enemy. &gt;&gt; This world is doing everything &gt;&gt; to obscure that person. &gt;&gt; And we see exterior. We see the weaknesses of one another. But he sees us as perfect. &gt;&gt; We see failures, everything on the exterior. We see all these kind of things. But he's not looking at that. And we are to see the person. &gt;&gt; Who is this person? Who is this great unseen person? &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, the congregation of people that ever arrive at the place that look at one another and see Jesus Christ in the flesh, &gt;&gt; that congregation, there will be nothing that will be able to stand before them [Music] &gt;&gt; because they do not see the failures. They do not see the silical up and down. They do not see the weaknesses. They see the man Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't forget friends, there were those when Jesus Christ, the perfect son of God, stood here on earth. He had enough weaknesses that some would call him beub. &gt;&gt; The prince of the devils. &gt;&gt; He had all kinds of failures and failings as far as the people were concerned. &gt;&gt; We cannot compare. We cannot have the world's standard. &gt;&gt; They don't know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Who is this person? &gt;&gt; We've come to the house of God, as is our custom. &gt;&gt; Who is this person? There's an old song. Who is this that's troubling me? Who is it that's calling? &gt;&gt; Who is it that troubling my sleep at night? Who is this great person? &gt;&gt; They wrote that song before and they didn't know what this message is. But who is this? &gt;&gt; We say we come into the house of God. We come in as is our custom. We came in Wednesday night. We've come in the previous services. Came in Wednesday night. I didn't know. You didn't know. Brother Tom perhaps didn't know. Brother John didn't know just how God was going to call. Who is this person? &gt;&gt; And my prophet said, "Talk about him &gt;&gt; and he'll come close. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Draw near, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Draw near, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Who is this great person? &gt;&gt; Who is this mech? &gt;&gt; You might be saying, I need a priest. &gt;&gt; You have one. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this is so far beyond church. Yes, &gt;&gt; we've come here this morning as is our custom. &gt;&gt; But as far as God is concerned, that custom is the judicial thing whereby the lawgiver, &gt;&gt; he who gave the law and imparts and allotss to each one their rightful place. He's the one you you'll you'll sit perhaps in your seat and uh and the deacons will come by and you'll take the bread and the wine off of the table. But I want you to be aware in that man, in that person in that office and in this congregation and in the song leader and in the person sitting next to you, &gt;&gt; in the person next to you, he's either one that might be in still in need, but I would say for the most part in that person next to you is this one, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in flesh. Yeah, weakness is because of the flesh, but because of the call of God and because of the because of the law of life that's in the individual. &gt;&gt; I spoke this whole service this morning and I had much more to say, but I'm quitting now. in a desire in a deep deep desire that God don't let the people just walk out the same again but let them walk out with these phrases upon them the law within. I want them I want you to look into into your own soul. I want you to get quiet. I want you to ponder. I want you to meditate. It would do you good. And then take the message, the unveiling of God. And in there you'll find that he will say, he will say, "This is Elijah saying to you, and he's veiled again now in you." &gt;&gt; Who is he? He's this great mysterious one. Who is he that stood on the platform? Who is he who revealed the secrets of the hearts of the people? Who is he that took your life and called you and brought you to this day? It is the same unveiled God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a woman and uh Brother Brandham was speaking to her and he had a vision and she said that she believed in her confidence. She anchored her faith in that vision because she knew the vision had to come from another place. Friends, I just close with this. I have a a wonderful wonderful place where brother Brandham it's an early early message where he he was trying to convey to the people what the vision was and he literally said that there are times he said and he was explaining there's someone here maybe has a dream someone here doesn't dream so he says here's one that doesn't dream because his conscious and subconscious too far away. And then someone dreams and they're they come close together. And so they have dreams. And then he says for a prophet both the conscious and the subconscious come right together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't dream to have that's where he has a vision. And now he said he said and when you wake up in the morning you've had a dream. Now, perhaps many even dreamed last night. Now, now I want to get right down where you live. What if you got up in the morning and said, "I just had a dream last night." And the rest of the family says, "Nah, you didn't have a dream." He said, "What are you talking about? Why are you questioning me?" Nah, you didn't have a dream. You just We don't know what happened, but you didn't have a dream. You could say, "I was there. I had the dream. I can tell you all the colors. I can tell you all the places. I can tell you every detail in detail. I had the dream. Why? Because you personally experienced it. &gt;&gt; And somebody somebody say, "Well, now I don't think there's anything to this message and da da da and whatever more." Just say, "Just a second, friends. This isn't even a dream. This is a reality. I had this experience. &gt;&gt; I've been there. Amen. &gt;&gt; John, I'm going to have you come up here for a second. You can probably even take your coat off. It's warm up here. &gt;&gt; How are you, Brother John? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. That's good news. How old are you? &gt;&gt; 22. 22 years old. Are you married? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Pretty sure. &gt;&gt; Very sure. You're not a father then? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; You're not a grandfather. &gt;&gt; What if I told you? You're not going to change a bit and you'll be a grandfather. I would too. I dropped my chain. Brother Brandham said now he said I was once a young man. Said now I'm a grandfather. &gt;&gt; But he said I'm still me. &gt;&gt; He said you might be here and you're not a grandfather. You're not a father. You're not married. said, "Just wait a few years and all of that will change." And you'll still be and I'll still put my hand if I'm still here and I'll say, "Hi, John. How are you?" You say, "Well, I'm not as good as I was when I shook your hand on the pulpit." Or you'll be the same person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; John's John was here and he was here in the church 15. Now he's a father, husband. &gt;&gt; My goodness. children growing up, but we're still here. &gt;&gt; That's the same. And brother Bren was talking about the God, the mighty God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Just the same person. &gt;&gt; He's the same person that he was in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; He's the same person that he was in Jesus. &gt;&gt; That same person dwelt in William Brham. &gt;&gt; That same person is here today. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're a few years down the road. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we've perhaps changed a wee bit the outward. So, we're not looking on the outward, the physical side. We're looking really what is inside. &gt;&gt; And you will still be you. &gt;&gt; Come and see me when you're married and after you get your children &gt;&gt; and say, "Hi, Brother Ed. I'm now a father." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said I'm still me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll go home and take this word and listen to it. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Sorry to cap you a little bit longer than usual, but the service this afternoon is at 4, so you'll just have time to get home and have a little time of refreshment. And remember this next week, our brother Benny Perry. I talked to him yesterday and he's very very uh shall I say he's very inspired about coming up. I don't know what God has put on his heart, but I'm anxious to hear what God has put there. Heavenly Father, I bow before you, the Almighty One. Father, you have brought us here into this life and into this time for a divine purpose. We do not know the fullness of it, but we want we do press ourselves, oh God, &gt;&gt; to the prize of the high calling that is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; We press ourselves, oh God, in a way of surrender. We want to do all that you would have us to do, all that I can be, all that we have. Oh God, take this congregation of people. I pray that you will meld them and mold them into a single unit. I pray father that you will take words that were spoken even this morning or previously or something that someone has heard but I pray that you will take words oh God and I have confidence in the life that is in that individual &gt;&gt; Lord whatever state they are in &gt;&gt; you're going to take and move them further &gt;&gt; you're going to take even the events and the circumstances that are around us you're going to mold the vessel to be a stronger vessel to be a cleaner vessel, &gt;&gt; to be a more usable vessel. &gt;&gt; Father, we can say, "Use us, Lord. &gt;&gt; We give ourselves to you without any reservation whatsoever. You're the master potter, &gt;&gt; oh God, and how we thank you. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I dedicate this congregation, my own life to you, Father, &gt;&gt; and these people that are standing here in Jesus Christ's name." And as we move towards this evening service, Lord, I ask that you will be mightily present to heal and to deliver your children. And as we have the Lord's table tonight, may it be a most blessed time in Jesus' name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to just sing that chorus uh we had the other night. I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. [Music] Thank you Lord for let me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? Thanks for that special night. When I saw your glorious light came face to face with eternal life. Lord I thank you. Let's sing the first verse and have to open my eyes. You couldn't even pass me by.

We're singing, I want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Would you go back in your own life before you heard the word and I'd like you just to project it forward and say, "Where would you be tonight &gt;&gt; if you hadn't heard the word?" &gt;&gt; It'd be pretty sad, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; I don't know where we would be. I don't know where brother and sister Biscllow would be. We don't know where we would be. So we can sing it with really some conviction and joy.
