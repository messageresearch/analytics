brother tom remember the needs amen if you have a need tonight brother john we've been remembering you and sister bev charman brother john charman just came out of a operation of a heart operation came out well doing fine amen there's many needs and we've got a god that can meet every need so why don't we just look to the lamb of god tonight that he alone is able to save he alone is able to deliver he alone is able to meet every need that's represented here this evening our dear precious heavenly father lord we indeed are looking to the lamb of god what a day that must have been lord when john on the banks of the jordan cried out behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world what a day that must have been at that junction of time the fulfillment of scripture was taking place and we can say today lord elijah has come and lord he has pointed us once again to the living resurrected jesus christ the living word so father that word has declared and is becoming materialized within the hearts and lives of the believers where you said ask anything in my name believing and you shall have what you ask lord let that thought be on our lips and let that word on our lips now materialize amongst the saints whether it be sister bev charm and lord and her condition whether it be brother john and different ones that have needs with in their body sister victoria whoever it might be lord may the word of life be on our lips claiming our healing in the name of jesus christ and father we just ask that you take brother michael your servant tonight as he will minister the words of life give him unction give him an anointing lead him in the word of life to feed the hungry souls tonight you could take a a little boy's lunch lord and break it to the thousands you can take the word of god tucked within michael's heart and you could break it to this little church lord feed our hungry souls we pray bless each one medie each need lord and speak to us now from your word for we ask it in jesus name amen amen [Music] thank you brother tom god bless you each and every one maybe we can sing i'm so glad he found me i believe that's still key of g just before we sing that i just uh been thinking today on the services that we've been having you know it's just an empty church just a few people here running things to put the services online and yet i've sat here service after service and i have noticed any difference in the manner or method or style of preaching it's the holy ghost ministering it's inspired it's anointed and it's just wonderful and i'm trusting that you're feeling that at your home wherever you gather to hear the word of god to join amen holy ghost doesn't know anything about time and space he made time and space that's you know where we're living right now but i'm just so thankful that we have men of god that are faithful that are at their post of duty and they're with the message with the message and the messenger of the hour i'm thankful for that i'm very thankful for that amen everybody agree with me hallelujah praise the lord we have a wonderful word and we have wonderful ministers preaching the word unto us and we're just happy for it amen let's sing it together well i'm so glad he found me [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh when i heard my savior calling me he said come to me relented and of your sins repenting [Music] put his arms all around me then it led [Music] [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah wow i just feel like we're walking in heavenly places tonight amen hallelujah maybe we can stand together and we'll just change the order of the service and i thought of this song while we were in prayer in the minister study tonight i'd like to sing i pledge allegiance to the lamb i feel it's a real fitting song for the time that we're living in we want to be counted we want to be standing firm and solid on the word of the living god amen pledge allegiance to the lamb my pledges to with all my strength with all i am [Music] the lamb i've heard [Music] their lives [Music] but one by one they chose [Music] [Applause] oh with all my strengths [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] to the lamb of god or to the lamb of god who took my place [Music] just amen god bless you brother michael [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] who gave us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] allegiance [Music] is [Music] amen god bless you god bless you i sure pray and believe that you mean that i pledge allegiance that is not a weak thing to say that that's something when someone pledges allegiance here i pledge allegiance to the flag or to the queen or to my country that is a that is like an oath someone's taking they're pledging allegiance there it doesn't matter what's ahead of them they're it's it's all in never wavering never quitting at that moment i pledge my allegiance it can never falter from there amen so i pray that's exactly the resolve you have tonight i pledge allegiance to the lamb my lamb of god amen god bless you wonderful to be in in his house again this evening and we're just going to fellowship a little bit on the word thank you musicians that'll be all for the beginning of the service here and we're and i pray the lord just meets us here especially tonight i told the brothers in the back study i said well it might be a 90 and 9 in the fold and we're going for the one tonight so if you're in the sheepfold and you're all just hunkered down and you're all bedded down nicely and you've gone through the door ah man you're just gonna pull on the word tonight you're safe in his arms but maybe there's just one and he just is lingering out there and we need to draw him lord needs to draw him in amen so we're going to the lord said he would leave the 90 and 9 for just the one amen so let's just pray the lord has his perfect way tonight you can get your your bibles we're going to turn to luke 14. very familiar passage of scripture i told my son it's gotten very very very old coming into the sanctuary empty yeah it's just so it was old a long time ago it was a long time ago but we will press on no matter what the battle no matter what the trial no matter what it is we've pledged allegiance and covet ain't going to waver nobody's allegiance to the lamb of god god bless you brother john good to see you amen all right we're going to read luke 14. we're going to start it verse 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at the supper time to say to them that were bitten come for all things are now ready verse 18 and they all with one consent began to make excuse they began to make excuses i'm just going to stop there we'll continue to reading but we'll just pray then we'll let you have your seats heavenly father lord lord one more time we've prayed much these last few days not knowing lord what you have in mind what is in store but only you alone do and so lord we as your people lord as your servants standing here lord tonight just want to give you our all and yield our every aspect of our being to you lord the people coming lord desiring lord a word from the great shepherd tonight so lord would you open your word to us lords parable as we would say that you spoke many years ago but just as real today as it was the moment you spoke those words lord somewhere in israel and so lord tonight would you speak to us and would you lord just bring us just a little bit closer to you lord find maybe that little lost lamb that's lord needing you tonight we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated amen all right so this is a like i said a parable that we've known very well and and here the the great supper the king matthew 22 also talks speaks jesus gives this account matthew 22 and he speaks of a great supper and a great invitation that goes out and bidding many to come and he says all things are ready but abraham says now god made everything ready you don't have to wait for a thing he said it's all fixed heaven's already prepared he said your healing's ready the jubilee is ready tonight he says hallelujah god's great healing campaign it's ready for you tonight he said christ has been slain his blood has been shed he said all things are ready right now hey man he said come come he's bidding he's bidding he said come and they're a bit and i was better brown talks about it he talks about eisenhower you know if eisenhower had sent out an invitation and i was thinking well you know there's probably different ones today that we would be compelled here we have the king of all kings compelling here a parable and it's i how ironic it is is that jesus christ himself was giving this parable and saying the great invitation went out and he's standing there the king and an invitation is going out as he was there on on on earth at that very moment as these words are being spoken he's saying come all come for all things already and i thought you know how would we respond i wonder how they all responded there they probably listened to his words and maybe some didn't really understand what what the parable meant and uh and it maybe went over their heads and and and i wonder what hap what's happening now even as as the call has gone out through the ages come come all things are ready jesus christ bidding come unto me all ye that are weary and are heavy laden i'll give you rest come and he's calling i i wonder how many have just ignored the invitation and and and passed it aside and how they how they would you know probably not even hitting their radar i wonder if if someone i just i looked up he said who who are the celebrities now or the you know the big people today if there was an invitation that went out you know someone blasted on and it hit your instagram uh account or your twitter account or your facebook account and you know and some some some who knows who i i wrote a handful of names down that i'm sure even right at the top of the list is still justin bieber still top of the list looks like uh i'm sorry but it looks like a devil in flesh with tattoos everywhere and everything else and 160 plus million people following him on one of his social media accounts but if he sent an invitation said come to my home for a feast i wonder what the response would be it would be just like instantaneous every seat was be filled done gone no more room at the inn because it would be filled and i went through just different people billy ellis she sings a song when she sings good girls go to hell that's the title of one of her songs good girls go to hell if any one of our children or anybody would even know that person or even have the two seconds time to even go beyond what i looked at you need an encounter with god someone is saying good girls go to hell saying that's satan himself singing through the flesh someone's that has given themselves over to a spirit a demon spirit singing songs anointed from the pits of hell good girls go to hell and that's exactly right olivia rodriguez ariana grande duane the rock johnson gave an invitation come to my house tonight i got a party that's going on oh you'd bet people would be there without a bat of an eye and as fast as they could but here the king of kings has sent an imitation out and it's like who who how many people don't even know who jesus christ is don't even know and here we drop into the next part of the scripture and they all with one consent began to make excuse my commandment make excuse now excuse is to explain a fault or an offense in the hope of being forgiven or to try and justify something and a lot of times then when we make an excuse we generally blame goes into that blame is par part of excuses many times they're really connected together because an excuse is blame happening and so people you know they have to declare um or feel they need to say someone or something is responsible for the fault or the wrong so in that justification or in that excuse they they start passing blame and assigning responsibility for something that happened maybe an unfortunate situation or some phenomena or something and so the the blame is very part of a part of an excuse and i'll use those maybe tonight a little bit interchangeably or together and just you know pray the lord just grant you understanding now blame it's an excellent excellent defense mechanism you know as we use it in excuses because it helps preserve your sense of of self-esteem because you're avoiding actually awareness of maybe a flaw of your own or maybe one of your own failings and so that's what blame does it that's why instantly something goes wrong and whoa but it's that that's the problem right there because it's a defense mechanism and it's all just easier straight up easier to blame someone else and accept the responsibility that's just human nature there and so it's you know there's more effort involved in accepting you know part of it or that you're actually at fault than just you know uh putting the blame somewhere else so so more efforts involved in accepting the fact that you're actually at fault and so instead of that you just blame someone else for it and so that's you know where blame and what blame really is and so a lot of ways again to separate your responsibility from something so you make an excuse and why you don't want to do something and it's a knee-jerk reaction for humans in in many ways you know we just don't want to do that we could be you know walking down a sidewalk we might slip or trip or maybe we're using our phone and we're walking down the road and you're losing the phone and uh any and you know what you're just you're so glued in that you walk into the car and it's like who parked the car there it's like well you're the problem you got your nose in your phone and you have no clue where you're going so it you know but instant it's just human nature just instantly wants to blame or make an excuse well that's the problem it wasn't me right you know how many people have been late for work [Laughter] you don't have to raise your hand but i can tell you generally the response is not you know it's totally my fault i slept in too late generally that's not the response it's something else you know breakfast spoiled it burned i had to clean this up something didn't have my clothes wash my spouse didn't do it for me they didn't iron my shirt it's something it's somebody else's problem generally why you're late for work and uh but nobody just wants to admit you know what i slept in got into bed too late and didn't get up to bed or get out of bed earlier right so we're just we make these excuses children if we do a bad test i can tell you the first thing you don't say is you know what i didn't even study at all it's the test was too hard the teacher's too strong it's a grade level above me it really is just not my fault that's probably where it usually goes it's instant it's just like immediate for a human to just throw the excuse out and you know even here we're living in covet right now and guess what they want to so find covert patient zero because they just want to point he's the problem he he caused this whole world the issue we got to find patient zero you know because no one wants to to barely any burden or you know responsibility for maybe that they they spread something or whatever you know nobody's you know i don't really have a i'm not pointing victims but that's the world is consumed to try to find that you know big groups of people trying to search out patient zero you know and so this this is because we want to cast blame or make excuse for you know for a problem and it eases somehow you know a lot of times in an excuse it actually it eases our conscience right it eases our conscience because you know it helps us dismiss or set aside the fact that we knew we had some responsibility and so we make an excuse we play some blame or over here and it just yeah yeah see that's the problem you know and and it kind of eases it and it and it pushes that down when really though deep down we know i'm actually i don't want to own up for maybe something i'm responsible for one person he said he said excuses are short-term vehicles of happiness they bring with them immediate satisfaction at the expense of something greater down the line and so there is a quote on an excuse short-term short-term vehicle of happiness but you know it can delay something that's coming down the pipe that that you really don't want to deal with and so here in ma in luke 14 we had some excuses being made and they all with one consent began to make excuse and i always wonder what you know why were they making excuse i just pondered that a little bit i wondered you know what is it they didn't they obviously did not even want to come they all had an excuse immediately of why why i don't want to be there like you know an excuse is usually is is there because you know a lot of people hey do you want to come here now you know what i got to i'm just tied up you know they don't generally don't want to you're not priority you know and and i'm circumstantial i'm generalizing but and a lot of times an excuse is made just because maybe it is not really any really desire to be there anyway and so they make this these excuses of the king and he says well the first one says i've got i've got some cows i've got some cows and i must prove them some oxen i must prove them my i've got a lot of work i've got a whole lot of work to do i got a new job and i need to you know i'm just so i'm just so zoned in and focused on it i got a difficult schedule uh pray go to church wednesday night nah i i got i i'm really in the zone here i you know kovitz on i've got i'm working day and night now it's the weirdest schedules and i got to prove i've got to prove these ox and i've got so many different cares of my life that's what his excuse was i've got these oxen and i must prove them i have these these uh these cares that i must must tend to and we're talking oxen back in the day like prove your oxen this wasn't like it was a major excuse you had four cows or four oxes and you had to you know these are these are to be honest these are also some nobles i'd imagine or something and you know you don't got to serve and i can go prove your ox and go put a put a yolk on them it's a weak excuse is what i'm trying to point out it was a weak excuse someone says i bought some land i bought some land leave my possessions i bought a little bit of land i got to go seek it out i got to go look at it he and he says what is his excuse he says i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it okay well that means you bought it sight unseen which is a very irresponsible and unstewardly like thing to do is just go buy a piece of land you've had to have seen it already i've got some potential in my land in my life i i gotta go try and achieve it it's maybe what he's saying i i got something that i that i that i need to do i got some talent some passion for something i i need that's more important right now i gotta go achieve or or maybe uh you know see how much further i can i can you know do whether it's my job or maybe some sport or something i got a plan for my future i've got this big investment and i go see it see what i can do with it and so he gave a another one person gave another weak excuse to reject the invitation to reject the bidding i must needs to go and see my land and if we go back in those days i'm trying to just give some simple little parallels very quickly but you know that's what it was said and they were sitting on a hillside somewhere maybe you're on a shore somewhere and he's saying i gotta go see my land i just that would have sounded so ridiculous as an excuse and i think that's i believe jesus was trying to show this was a pretty petty petty thing that he was putting out in front now next one he said i've married another said i bought oxen the third says i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come you know this one some some might say well that seems to be maybe a little bit more of the of the best of the three excuses uh you know there's but i thought about that i said you know if that man had married somebody that was worth her salt she would have wanted to see the king she said the king just called the king just wanted us to come who we're going no but instead that wasn't the case he used her as an excuse for one and maybe maybe because he had no desire to even bring her to the bringer to the king's court maybe the court king wouldn't even approved maybe with some wife from some other kingdom maybe it was some something that was uh you know not not actually if you want to get him saying maybe you're marrying someone that's not in the same line maybe not believing what he was believing how can two are together less to be a greed and he's married maybe somebody that he should not have and here his eyes have been turned maybe it's friendship nowadays maybe your eyes of his eyes were off the king suede is focused maybe maybe this relationship has swayed his focus and so the king wasn't important to him anymore what the king's desire was not important anymore it was all now this area of his life and it was an excuse that he made to not heed the bidding that the king had made and i asked was that of any of those valid excuses just give me thumbs up or thumbs down for everybody to say are those valid excuses no exactly thank you and did the king he said you know what that's okay i totally get it i completely understand those excuses you know i'll let it go now in matthew 22 he was so roth he destroyed them he was so roth he destroyed them and so i want you to just as we go through this portion of the evening service tonight i want you to lay your excuses down maybe that has been holding you back from accepting the invitation that jesus christ has sent and given out and ushered out through the through the word and through the message i want you to lay it down i don't care what it is i want you to through the course of the night if something if you've if you've been there something's been there and i want you to put it i want to imagine a bit of a scale and i want you to put that on a scale and when you say where is that where is my excuse level up where is that and i want you just to do that i want you i want you to push back all this that what satan is going to try and put in your mind and try and oh no it's because of this oh no but that blame this is why you have to do that no i want you to push all that side and try and go back to what you're actually responsible for and the king has said come come i'm inviting you and what is holding you back from that you know these were situations that in this in the parable that you know they have they had were a part of but you know there's many things i know that many people you're in certain life situations and maybe your your family life or some sort of uh relationship or something that you've grown up and it's actually not even your fault that you're in a certain circumstance you actually have justification it's you know justifiable blame it's like well because of this this is my circumstances that i'm in and i had nothing to do with this i didn't even make make the decision or make the choice to be here and you know maybe some hurt or maybe some issue and i was thinking a few services ago we speak spoke on wounds and and the wounds that have wounded you we spoke on that but in my mind and i almost i was just thinking yeah jesus knows you're wounded and you can go back to that service but the wounds still are no excuse the wounds are still no excuse for you to falter for you to step back for you to to wane in your faith for you to backslide and get cool nothing nothing that they that any of these these people in this parable gave in as excuse nothing that you've gone through in life no circumstance no no situation somebody hurt me somebody wounded me i'm in a family situation i can barely even get to church i can't even squeak no nothing is not one thing on this planet that is justification to say and so therefore i actually can't i i can't uh i can't live for christ there's not one thing not one situation not one broken heart not nothing that is that's going to be set there and god's gonna be like you know because i'll let that go nothing nothing will justify an excuse to backslide nothing will justify you for your cooling off nothing i don't care covet i don't care nothing well i can't go to church i can't i can barely um get get time work schedule is so weird uh we can't come and sit in the pews i don't see my friends i don't have my my social network at church i don't care that is not an excuse for you to cool off in your walk with god nothing i want i will repeat it over and over maybe through the service there's not one thing in this day and age that god is going to be like yup it's okay it's okay that you backslid it's okay that you stepped away and you and you cool down in your walk with me it's just it's okay never will that happen never and so do not use some situation like to prop up in your mind or put out there and allow the devil to be like well because of this it's okay and you and you kind of yeah your conscience is sued yeah i know i i cuz i do that or because of that situation no nothing nothing will be there and hold candle at the end of time woman at the well she had every excuse in the book i would think to say why she's had a rough time we've spoken her before you've heard her spoke on many times she had a rough life we spoke about it she probably had enough enough in her in her in her life to say look at all this surely this gives me a you know a pass there was no pass she had a burning desire there when grace came her way and he said if you have this water that i give you oh that sparked something in her and that's that's that's the seed inside that is like that's what i'm looking for regardless of all the situations around me that's what i need she was she was responding to the call immediately regardless of her situations regardless regardless of her hurts and her pains rahab brother brandon i think talks about her as well and her rough situations of where she went out and and why she maybe had to be in the streets etc excuses but when two messengers came by her way all her excuses didn't matter she says give me a token and if you on the internet sister chair you did such a phenomenal job as rahab i need a true token give it to me that's all she cared about not well you know i have a rough life and i know i if i put out there people are going to persecute me and i don't really put no no there's not no excuse or anything she says give me a true token and that responded to the messengers of her day amen you know the hebrew boys they were they were you know put in a situation foreign land captured slaves when in rome do as a romans right let's uh eat like the babylonians and we know we just got to fit in here a little bit went and laid to see it kind of got to do it like the latest scenes you know fit in and you know do no that was not their focus they didn't care about the surroundings they didn't care about what what their the circumstances around them were but when it came time to stand and when the pressure got hot and when covid came and it was said you got to do this and you've got to do that oh oh well well you must succumb to that bow that is not what they did they did not bow to the issues of their time they said my walk is just as strong now as it was when i was in israel my stand and my fervency for jesus my stand for jehovah has not faltered even though i got nobody around me but my two little brothers and when the fire got hot they didn't know the fire was going to come seven times hotter didn't really matter they were resolved well you know what should we should we it's just maybe too much maybe we should just let her cool down a little bit and then we can you know deal with it afterwards no all the way they pledged allegiance all the way didn't matter what it whether it was easy times medium times or really difficult times or you're burning to death time seven times harder it was all the way amen who's here all the way said i don't really care what's going on i don't care what's happening around me i'm going to be like shadrach i'm going to be like meshach i'm going to be like a bendigo and i'm going all the way seven times hotter because when it got really hot that's when the son of god the fourth man that we haven't been able to sing that song for a long time fourth man in the fire that's when he came on the scene is when they said i obey the word of god i'm standing like like a rock on my on my conviction and then god honored him and said i'm beside you in these hot times you know i said well you know my family is it's a difficult time you know it's a little bit cool you know mom and dad doing this and that and i know where my brothers and sisters are whichever maybe you got some family situation i don't know but i was thinking about gideon because i've just gone through i have a thompson chain bible you know and so when you look at a verse it changes you all the way through so when you're looking at excuses it weaves you all the way through i get all excuses right through the bible where did where did that where did that apply where did it apply so we just weave the scriptures to them boom hairlines gideon hairline's gideon if you want to turn we'll follow i'm going to be in judges 6 for a little bit all right gideon you know children of israel did evil on the side of the lord midian was there so was israel had sown and the medianites came up and the malachites and the children of the east and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth tilde coming to gaza left no sustenance neither sheep nor oxen or ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers just to give you an image there as grasshoppers they came which means they just came in and just just sucked the land dry pretty much of all of its sustenance and just just nothing left for the for the little little guys you know these grasshoppers come in and they take over and this is the scripture saying that it's grasshopper it's like a plague for the multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it so here they are coming in just like satan does trying to come in they they hadn't done israel hadn't done right on the side of the lord enemy comes starts coming in and he ain't gonna stop for nothing and so he's coming in now and suck and dry the substance of the land just like satan will try and come in and give you a you give him a little crack he's gonna blast the door down and he's gonna take a mile and he's gonna start sucking your spiritual life dry like a horde of grasshoppers okay that's what he's going to do why because their hearts turned away and so then satan finds a way in entering and israel wasn't greatly impoverished because the minionites and are cried unto the lord so they got to a point may you get to a point if your land your spiritual land is in this crisis moment may you get to the point where your heart turns back and you start crying unto the lord lord i need you now my life is in ruins i've got grasshoppers all around me satan is trying to suck me dry of my life i need you now that's what israel did they're crying out lord i need you now and the lord sent a prophet brother branham says it doesn't even have a name he said he sent a prophet with his word to them he said it didn't matter but it was god's messenger for them at that hour he sent a prophet on the children of israel saying thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you out of egypt trying to let him know i was i was the true god i brought you out of israel of egypt i i did these things i formed you i brought you forth out of bondage i delivered you from the egyptians out of the hand that oppressed you i drave them out from before you i was the one who parted the red sea i was the one who brought jericho's walls down he's trying to show them who what are you serving i am the true god i did this for you and he's saying i am the one that can take care of this situation amen but he said and he said to them i am the lord your god fear not of the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice so god's saying this is what i've done for you but he turned away from me and here gideon is an angel of the lord appeared unto him and he said the lord is with thee thou mighty man a valor david you got that slide for me almighty man of valor he was no screen okay mighty man of valor where was gideon gideon this are examples of a wine press okay on your left side if you're looking at this screen the other side this big open area is a threshing floor okay so gideon the mighty man of valor that the lord has just told him who he is is in a little hole somewhere these are just examples of a wine press threshing wheat now threshing wheat was something to be done wide open spaces so everybody can see and you're throwing the weed in the air and the chaff is going the air and it comes back down and it needs space it needs space but gideon is not this mighty man of valor is in a teeny little hole something like this trying to get thrashed wheat very very difficultly i'm sure in these the constraints of it why because he's scared he's scared of the midianites they're everywhere and if they see him threshing wheat they're gonna come and take it like a grasshopper so he's here in a you know in a wine press he should have been on a threshing floor just to give you an idea when you hear that and you read that in scripture all right because that's what it says and there came an angel of the lord unto uh under an oak tree was an opera that pertained to joash the abbasid and the son of gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and so he's hiding scared i gotta do this got a lot of excuses why he should be and now he's a mighty man a valor god sees way beyond your little circumstances and he sees writing the heart he knew there was a lot more there in gideon than just maybe the outside circumstances there now gideon something was in his heart again he might have been threshing there he said i just gotta eat my get some food up for my family and he's trying to trying to do this but i know in his heart he said lord i know he's a real god you're the god of moses you're the god that delivered us out of egypt he knows that because his question when the lord says you mighty man of valor and the scripture says and and he said oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is this all be following us and where be all his miracles he knew there was a real god he knew there's a god that could deliver because he believed the word that was had gone before him and brother braham says where are these things he says in other words i'm a man maybe 50. he said and i heard them talk about a god that worked miracles and i went to a church i believe the priest and i believe the prophets i believe the written word and the scrolls and i read in the scrolls where god when he come along his people something takes place amen gideon didn't know but that man sitting there under this oak tree amen was the g was the lord that's what it says in the scripture and the lord looked upon him and he said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i set thee thou mighty man of valor go in this thy might have not i sent thee and here's i'm sure i know well we know because the next verse i'm going to read it mighty man of valor he knows he's in this little wine press he's trying to hide he's he's probably he's trying to figure a man of valor mighty man because then he says unto him oh um wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor i got zero stature here i don't have any money to fund an army i got nothing i'm poor i have no sustenance other than this teeny little bit of wheat or whatever i'm trying to thresh in a little hole somewhere where i should be doing wine and he says i am the least i am the smallest i am nothing in my father's house but god has just said no you're a mighty man of valor and you're now going to save the uh save israel from the hand of the midianites here's his he's using his ex giving excuses right into god's face saying no no no you got you got it wrong i'm poor i got i'm the least i i i can't do this no no and you know the lord didn't say oops right wrong guy wrong area i'm gonna move on because somehow i made a mistake uh you're you're clearly not the right one you're hiding no that wasn't the case he knew exactly who gideon was he knew exactly what he placed in him the excuses that maybe he had in the front of his of his mind little circumstantial things but deep down gideon was indeed a mighty man of hour and i don't really care where you might be and you might be thrashing your little wheat somewhere barely squeaking out some spiritual existence in your little world but you are a mighty man or a mighty woman of valor and god sees a knock on your door and say no you're going to be delivered from the hand of the many nights you need to step up and accept my word because i'm telling you you are mighty and you will deliver i will deliver you by your hand out of the midianites god didn't say oops to him and he's not saying oops to you oh yeah you know you know you're right you're right here i picked the wrong one no you're going to conquer laodicea he said you're going to stand dominant in this age you're going to stand on my word you have the faith in you to defeat the enemy anytime anywhere any place that's in you and i'm telling you you are mighty in laodicea accept god at his word don't give some lame excuse that satan put it to your mind well look at what your situation is how do you do that you're you're low you're like you're you're way down there on the scale of families and and this and that that's what that's what gideon said my family's low you know he wasn't low in god's mind god came to him he didn't come to some other family he came to gideon in a little wine press in his little hobble somewhere fresh and wheat and said mighty man a valor you're going to go and conquer and you know who came behind him we'll skip way ahead just says my mind is going there because what it's how many boys have been i've been a child and said would they pull their sword out when they're a kid instead of the sword and the lord and of gideon who's done that me i have a man as a little kid because his gideon sword you knew he had a mighty hand but you remember he was in the winepress scared stiff at one point and that's the transformation that god can do in your life amen when you just believe on his word where begotten all those miracles gideon you know recognize that he was the miracle he was a miracle transformation that god was saying no no i'm taking you from here and you're gonna become the miracle the miracle that took place in him but he had to believe what the word said he was but abram says now they had to believe they had to believe the prophet's word and obey it before they could see god's miracles and today you can't go here under false makeup and saying wow jesus is not the same yesterday today and forever days and miracles have passed that doesn't really happen here anymore no such thing as baptism of holy ghost i don't see the lord dropping like fire and and tongues of fire it is just not true he says no you've got to obey it and when you obey god takes care of the rest that's first don't be some skeptic well no no god's saying you obey my word first and then i'll come behind it gideon had to obey god's word and step into that step into the vision that god had said you're a mighty man of valor he had to accept that and obey that and walk in that and then the manifestation of it came down the road israel had to obey jericho they had to walk around the walls god said i'll take care of it but you march they had a march they'd obey that first israel jericho didn't crumble immediately they marched day one to two to three to four to five to six and then seven times they had to do that obeying first noah had to obey it obey god a piece of wood by piece of wood and then the flood came then the miracle miracle rain who knows about rain no god no one had to obey first so you act on his word and you'll see a real miracle something will start to take place when you act upon it and gideon cast his fear down he cast all the excuses down anything that he had and he cast that down admitted or not and god's because god said you're going to take care of the midianites lord bram says throw talking about moses he says throw down your stick throw down your staff he said in other words he says get rid of everything that's around you amen he says let god saying let me have it he's saying oh i got an awful temper give it a god he says oh he knows how to quiet down he's like oh i got a whole lot of lust he says he knows how to take that away just put it in his hands and watch what a miracle can do just give it to him throw your excuses or some crutch or whatever down give it to him and he'll take care of it amen obedience comes before the miracles thank you david you can take that down everyone says well where's all these miracles we give a thousand dollars to anybody that will permit a permit it will produce anybody that will permit will produce a miracle you he says someone said i'll give you you know give a thousand anybody who will permit and will and do a miracle potter brown says you poured deliberated backslidden twice dead plucked it by the roots he says how are you ever going to see a miracle until you become one i love it a miracle of god's grace to take an unbelieving doubter and fill him with the holy ghost if you want to see a miracle he says become a miracle amen that's where the miracle for that's what gideon become he become the miracle and god said rise up mighty man of valor there was the miracle and he says where are all the miracles you just have to look right at him i'm starting to obey the word oh look at this i'm the miracle now my fear and all of my unbelief or my excuses of whatever it was for here but now he was taking his sword and leading the charge amen and that's exactly for you don't give a bunch of excuses you become the miracle by acting on god's word in your situation the same power that saves you heals you delivers you comforts you it's the same one same one he says and you know down in your heart that supernatural work has been done when jesus christ enters enters your body and you become a living oracle of jesus christ you entomb the holy ghost inside of you and you're walking like gideon did now on his word he says and you know then down in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you once drank you smoked you lied you and you women loved the world so much you kept wearing makeup and your long or short hair he says and doing other things you did and find out something happens that all the devils in hell couldn't make you do it again something happened it says that the god who performed miracles performed one in you what did he do he'd change her vile heart change your desires change your nature a supernatural word by a supernatural god made a creature of time to a creature of eternity that's a miracle i don't you couldn't get no bigger miracle than i say well i need to see some some some other you know miracles no no i have i have it for you here jesus said you think one i said you think one's easier than the other he said to the pharisees when they saw their faith he said unto the man of the palsy he says man thy sins are forgiven thee scribe says oh who can forgive sins but god alone and he perceives their thoughts jesus he says what reason ye in your hearts he says whether it's easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or rise up and walk saying so which one's greater which one's more difficult and he says just to show you that you know that i that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins rise up and walk he says unto the sick man with the palsy i say arise take out my couch and go to thine house amen which one was more greater he says i got both done for you now see who i am i am the son of god he proved who he was there and so you want to tell me which one is greater jesus said the saving of a soul the forgiveness of sins the supernatural transformation of someone's life becoming completely and holy sold out to god that's the miracle that god will do that's the greater miracle take the world out of you put christ in you the hope of glory and you're filled with the spirit and ready to meet him amen gideon says oh we'll go back a little bit he says my can i get a sign and god says uh-huh went got an offering put a little rock took his staff fire consumed it that's exactly what gideon needed because of the same sign of the god of elijah on mount carmel came and consumed the sacrifice and gideon knew right then this is god this is god i'm going to follow him i'm going to put all of my concerns and my worries and my excuses and everything else and i'm following this one because he is the lord god because he produced a sign that gideon knew was the word you can turn me down a little bit but i said lord we receive the same thing he said oh how do i know how do i know the word of god i was true to my age day and age no no god he sent a sign he sent a prophet with a message and he showed he's the same one he's the same yesterday today and forever and he showed it time and time and time again giving us no excuse to know this is the message of this hour he said to gideon you shall not die go in peace you shall not die my what a comfort it says you're gonna take you're gonna take on the midianites you're gonna you're gonna lay waste you're gonna retur you're gonna take back what is yours you and israel and i'm just going to give you this little comfort you're not going to die just go in peace oh my goodness i'm going to give you the same comfort tonight you will not die you might go down in a grave but you might just sleep but you will rise again when you have jesus christ inside you have nothing to fear little bride whether you will rise up when it when the time comes the trumpet shall sound the dead shall rise and those which are alive and remain shall be caught up together you will not die man you have the same thing because it's jehovah shalom is what he but it gave it an offering and a peace offering and he says jehovah shalom he is my peace that's where that is from you anchor that he said i have the same promise as gideon amen he's my jehovah shalom i shall not die you know but there's some work to be done and gideon couldn't dilly dally around because that same night and it says the same night the lord said unto him take thy father's block and the second block that's seven years old and he told him he needed to do some business because his family his father's family was not in order and so here now he had to actually do something he had to do something he had to start taking back he said i had to start saying okay we're not we're not all right here god's wanted to do a mighty work and something caught fire in him he says he's a god of miracles he's alive right now today but god's saying you got to clean up here you're gonna you're gonna do a little bit so you're gonna go down and you're gonna tear down the idols you're gonna tear down the groves you're gonna go down there with the bullock and you're gonna take the bullock to seven years to have a bullock of seven years old that's still in their possession this fellow was hidden for a very long time because he had been snatched very quickly by the immediate knights seven years okay he's gotta have been hidden somewhere or he wouldn't have survived so this was a precious block it doesn't really matter what it is how something that you've held is so present some some circumstance or some passion or some idol in your life god is saying take it all and he took his men and servants yeah he had some servants and he took him in the night he was he it was being a little a little cautious he took him in the night took him all down and tore down the groves and the idols and he took the bullock the groves has actually cut them down that would have been like trees and and like a an area they would have uh you know worship their idols in and such if you look into it it's it's like they would have been very precious uh groves because these are areas that they would worship their god and he cut him down and then used that uh for the for the for the fire for the for the sacrifice and took that seven seven year old bullock and sacrificed him on the lord gideon went in there with some fire gideon went in there with some fire getting well it's not my business and my family it's my father you know he's he's got his own no no no no no no you young men and young women i don't really know whatever is going in your family don't you dare be afraid to stand up and say whoa this house is not in order and if we want god to move we're going to have to clean house and bring it up to speed and god wants this all cleaned out y'all don't you what you're listening to what music or what movies or what books or whatever and you're consumed in romance or i don't care what it is gideon had to go through there and wipe it down the most precious things of his father he had to take this precious block and sacrifice it unto the lord you will be blessed the medianites were conquered once he did that that was the first thing he had to do was get it wiped out and there was no excuse of whose it was well my my father you know did this no no no gideon you deal with it you go in and you do it god's speaking to you you stand up just like a gideon i say parents don't even give we shouldn't be giving our kids even a reason or a need for them to be to standing up you be the gideon in your household and then and wipe it all down if you see someone's lack of resolves waning in your house it is no excuse it was no excuse for gideon good and you could say well it's not my not my duty it's not my issue and because my family's cold i'm cold too no no there is no excuse gideon stood on the word of god and gideon had a resolve set all that aside and had a walk with god and the other one other side of it is parents if your kids are on this uh having a tough time and god needs to meet their heart don't you dare falter or waver or back up or cool down or whatever you continue to be a guiding lamp you continue to be a stronghold of your house for the word of god you continue to have your resolve so they can look back and say no i might have gone through a tough time but there was never a faltering in my home i could always look at my daddy and he was still strong in the world i could look at my mama and she still had faith and she still they still prayed and they still held held a token over the house no matter if your kids slid backslide whatever it is cool down go away come back you continue to be a shining light for them don't ever let that be an excuse well my kids and then you falter down never never falter down never back up nev there is no excuse valid ever for you to do that amen lord help us you sang the song at the beginning i pray that judges anchors is a resolve there ain't nothing here there ain't no situation there is nothing i pledge allegiance to the lamb may that be a whole lot realer to you tonight are you saying no i'm not putting blame on anything i'm not making an excuse i'm going to stand firm in this day right to the end i'm going to be a gideon and take a resolve i'm going to cut down if there's any groves if there's any bail or whoever that's that's rose up in our home as an idol that's before the lord you cut it down it might and it might hurt because they came to take they came they wanted to kill them they wanted to kill who did this oh i was gideon gideon the son of joash okay we were going to kill him this is how it was they were that mad and the man the city said in jewish bring out their son that he may die because he has cast down the altar of baal and because he had cut down the grove that was by it bring them up here and we're going to die i pray if someone stands up in a home and says dad this has got to change our home is not in order we need a fur more fervent walk with god we need more prayer in our home we need to get this out of our home there's too many of this entertainment in our home there's too much of this in our home and if someone's stunned or daughter or whoever in a home stood up i pray that you would be like a joash or a mom would be like a joash and he would say this and he said josh said unto all that stood by him you're going to plead for baal he didn't stand on their side and be like yeah let's go get him he's going down he ruined everything this is my passion i love doing this i love watching movies all the time i mean i don't know no no he didn't do that he said will you save him will you save baal he said will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death while wilest it is yet mourning he recognized yeah you're right gideon we were off the word we were where we should be let's just get us out of here and let's do this and if and his response i believe was honored by god because that is the correct response not not the not the utters kill him he just ruined our whole life he just exposed us no george said you're going to plead for baal come on he's a mighty god no if he is let him do his work of course not because it was just an idol and joe said he who pleads for him let him be put to death may you be if that is somehow your position may you be like a josh you say lord i'm exposed to i've had an idol in my life but gideon may i may i pull my sword like gideon and be a mighty man of valor in this day and age cut it back scripture says god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise moses he blamed his inaccuracy inadequacies of his speech excuses we're talking excuses gideon has excuses moses he has excuses a lot of excuses god says no no i've chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise i've chosen the weak things of the world to confound them that are mighty so you think you're weak you think you're low you think you're you're inadequate that's god's way he put you in scripture and the base things of the worlds and the things which are despised hath god chosen yey and the things which are not to bring to not things that are amen he god chooses the weak so that he can show his power through a surrendered life that's exactly what he wants he said well i'm not spiritual enough who who's setting the level of spirituality is that just some excuse on your mind no no no god god came to the humble the poor and the wretched that's a good place to be the thing that i'm no no you'd be humble you think you're poor in spirit that's a god came god forgot the pharisees who thought they were wise and and high and in their in their inner religion no no god didn't come to that he came to the humble and to the meek and to the wretches and the poor he said well i can't live it nope you can't but you can with him you can with him problem is you maybe just haven't surrendered and you've held on to maybe maybe he's a little idol maybe it's a grove but you need to fully surrender and then he can do it through you i said well it's too early i've got life to live a life before me and then you go through that and then the devil was like no i'm too far gone say god doesn't even want me satan plays me on both sides you're too early so you can't forget about it now he goes now you go far in times too this is the devil he's the devil he's going to hit you on either side you need to recognize it's just an excuse because you know you need god and this is an excuse that he's put in it's just like i have cows i need to prove them i have some land i need to go look at it that's all it is you've put your excuse on the scale i don't think i've ever heard a christian someone else in here can tell me have you ever heard a christian say yeah you know what i should have delayed longer anybody heard that before no you ever heard someone who's on fire for god god filled them with the holy ghost and they are just consumed with jesus and they all want to be an ambassador for him they're a steward of his grace as we spoke on and they're just walking to victoria's life have you ever heard someone like that say you know what i just i should have delayed longer never never let satan tell you it's too early you you need to have some fun first because then he's going to play on you and be like yeah you're too far gone have fun bud you you missed it he'll play on you on both there are two rotten excuses that he's planting and trying to blame those situations you need to see what they are see through it say that's just a devil hindering me from a victorious walk with god and it's a barrier and you're living miserable because of it because you've tried to maybe give some excuse shift the blame out there try to justify your reason or faltering or backside whatever just to ease your conscience it's just an excuse and if i want to put it on the scale i would say as scripture your excuse has been weighed in the balance and has been found wanting that's where your excuses and i want you to keep that in your heart like i said it might be for one i stood on a pulpit several years ago and i had a man of god speak some very specific words to me and i said i don't have anything to say i got nothing to say he says he'll put the words in your mouth i said i said i can't do this but i said for one i said i'll do this just for one i don't care if it's one ten years from now i don't care if the one is already found i don't know but lower my focus i'll go for one so if the 99 are in that little sheet fold i'm calling for one i'm saying your excuse your excuse has been weighed in this balance and is found wanting and god is saying come come unto me you're heavy laden satan's pouring it on forget the excuses there's no excuse valid come unto me i will release you of your burden i'll release you of your sin and eternity is in the future for you if you just come and accept the bidding of my invitation i'm going to just go a little quicker now you know the rest of this parable of matthew 22 there there's different accounts of same parable and it goes to the end and uh and the robes are sent out scripture says to go there from the highways and the byways they they they dismissed it they excused it they they had some issues uh things better they had that they had they found better than to come to this great feast this great invitation and so king said go in the highways and the byways and compel them to come and i'm compelling god is compelling they rejected the imitation hey come god's saying come on to me he's now compelling from the highways and the byways and the lowly and the wretched and the weak he saying come come unto me come to my feast and he says in the king now he's going through his guests are here and he said unto him friend oh come as thou hither not having a wedding garment here's a person who came to the feast he heard the call he was intrigued maybe he had a desire of some sort you know hell there was a feast and he came but for some reason some reason some excuse that he made up in his mind i couldn't even contrive one he felt he didn't need to come by the way to come by god's provided way he felt you know what i'm good enough what i'm in is good enough i think we did a skit on it and i think that whoever was acting said he called me in this and so i should be just fine to be there in my same way in my same clothes if i was good enough to be called with this clothing on i'm good enough to be at his face with his clothing on you know i don't know he he's something in his mind some excuse he felt was valid that he did not come by the way he didn't have to come and i god forbid that something in your mind says you know i don't need it i didn't come you know i'm a good person i don't need to be baptized why you know why should i wear long hair i you know i fit in here pretty well i'm a good person you know why do i need to change my robes why do i need to adjust you know who i am a little bit no no no no i'm going to read to you the next bit of scripture i'm going to read you a quote first but ibrahim says the only they only had one way he said no not 960 different ways but jesus he said i am that way. the king's son the bridegroom stood there at the door received the invitation each one of them come with an invitation the bridegroom received the invitation the father had given he said he had handed out the bridegroom the bridegroom in return put a robe on he's just explaining kind of how this worked on the east oh my he put a robe on everyone that's good bad rich poor whichever he said now this rope is none other than the baptism of the holy ghost he says that's the robe and so just giving you just so you're very clear that's the robe you need for this great invitation for this great banquet for this great feast and there is no excuse because what happened what happened was the scripture says and he was speechless at that moment there was no valid excuse and he stood there and said friend why come a style sitter not having a wedding garment and everything that maybe he brought up in his mind through his life why he could be the way he was why he could live the way he did what he like he could do the way he did he justified it and he said well because of this circumstance because of that this is the way i am and then all of that came to play he said wait a second you're going to stand before god at one point and say well friend why didn't you come by though by by me why didn't you come through the way why didn't you come through jesus christ i i bid i called and even if you came i would have put a robe on you if you came the right way god's provided way and he stood there and scripture says he was speechless he said lord do not be there at that moment where you are speechless now i'm going to turn a little bit of a corner i'm going to praise help me this corner lord said on the adam we're gonna go back to the beginning he says where art thou and he said i heard the voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and hid myself we're talking excuses and he said who told me that that was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded thee that thou should does not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest the woman whom thou gavest he's speaking to god and he's making an excuse and actually putting blame but you gave me the woman and she gave me the tree and i didn't eat the lord said unto the woman what is this that that was done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat beguiled we know that's he's subtle he was a subtle and he and he and he he deceived her in in in uh in a way and he beguiled her into it and moments where she could say i really didn't even know what i was doing he beguiled me his fault be with him and the lord said unto the serpent because that was done this thou art cursed above all cattle above all the beasts of the field upon thy belly thou shalt go in the dust thou shalt eat you know he didn't even ask him he didn't say now why did you no he just said because he did this didn't even give him the time of day to speak god here i can hear them going down the garden eating he says i can hear him going down through the garden something like this clap clap you've read the quote he said what is his bloody skin slapping his leg and i could see all that great space less eternity come forming down like a funnel like four little letters of l-o-v-e and he loved his children so much until he couldn't turn them away and he says stop i'll put enmity between thy seed i love how brother bradham dramatizes that we can just read through the scripture and we can read through but he curses the serpent and he listens to their excuses curses the serpent and it's like all oh it's just everything's in chaos right there at the moment he's here god is in all this great eternity and it just funnels down into four little l o v e and he loved his children so much he could he said stop i'll put enmity between thee and the serpent seed thy seed in the serpent seed he said promising a redeemer amen and i'll it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel oh i'm so glad there was that extra scripture it didn't end right there he says no no no i'm going to take care of something here and he says stop and he places a promise and a prophecy and i want to just talk about that here now their excuses didn't stand anything e adam eve it didn't matter the penalty was you transgress you die and the blame didn't really matter you could pass the blame but abram says they tried why the woman you gave me the serpent beguiled me he was the one that had the affair he did this he said they went right on to judgment just the same and now the blame they tried to pass the blame on and here god is saying oh no no he said stop and he gives a scripture and he says no no i gotta do something and hear god i was reading just about us and he's and here if you read in leviticus they had this is what they had they had to put a they had two goats two kid goats and they had to do a um a ceremony they they sacrificed one and one was a scapegoat this is where scapegoat come is in the scripture and it says he shall take two goats present them before the lord of the door and abe and aaron will cast lots upon the two goats one lot for the lord one for the scapegoat and aaron shall bring the goat upon the lord at which the lord's lot fell and offer him for a sin offering and but the goat on which the lord fell to be a scapegoat shall be presented a lie before the lord make an atonement and let him go for his scapegoat and what he did aaron would take that goat that was chosen as a scapegoat and he would take both his hands upon the head of the live goat and he'd confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions and all their sins i'm reading scripture putting them upon the head of the goat and send him away by the hand of a fit man in the wilderness and that goat shall bear upon him all the iniquities all the sin unto a land not inhabited and he shall go let the goat go in the wilderness but ibrahim says his soul was cast in hell speaking of jesus because he was a castaway he was the scapegoat of the old testament who put their sins upon the people upon the scapegoat and turned them out into the wilderness to die jesus was the scapegoat who had the sins of the people upon him and was cast away and went into hell to suffer tortures and his body went in the great grave to pay the price and i was just pondering that he said oh lord because i was thinking of the blame here adam and eve were trying to put some blame and trying to make an excuse for what they did and they were there was no excuse they it didn't it wasn't valid here god was oh oh no no stop i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna make a way for this before the foundation the world is this was already on his mind and he goes and i just imagine here in israel someone if this they had done this and they let this goat escape go go into the into the wilderness here and some would say well uh you know bring up some issue or some circumstance or something they did and well you know i didn't know if i did that and someone maybe is bringing up some excuse of why they did or didn't do something but he said wait a second no no no no no that was late on the goat that was that was that was that those iniquities were laid on the goat that's what aaron did he laid his hands and confessed all the iniquities of the children israel and that person could say no no no that's in the wilderness that was put on that was put on the scapegoat i don't need an excuse cause it's already this but he took that he put it's on the goat it's the goat's problem he could say that he could say that and i just thought my my when you come to jesus christ when you come to jesus christ you can satan can throw on what about this what about that you're like oh well i you know i but i wasn't i didn't mean to do that but it was this issue no no no you don't need you don't need an excuse you don't need to worry about it there's no need to cast blame on nothing because jesus christ was our scapegoat oh my goodness i just said oh lord i can just imagine imagine that feeling of being able to say no no no he took my sin oh my goodness i'm just i don't want to speak in that just a little bit because i can imagine i had this happening in my notes here look i'm going to skip ahead hear the bleeding lamina i can just imagine and he's getting whipped and he's getting smacked and he's getting beaten and he's getting and here's the bleeding clam hear the bling lamp and you know what he didn't do he's the only one that could say it and he could get the weight of the whip him on the back and they're just tearing his skin and he can say oh it's not my fault it's michael's fault he's the only one that could say that because he was the innocent lamb of god and he could sit there and he took he could take the and he could have screamed out no it's not it's orang's fault why am i taking this pain but he didn't do that horn he didn't do that he took it all he took it all because the satan can come and say what about that no no i am blameless i am smallest he took it the scapegoat took it go deal with him he can't because he conquered death and hell in the grave stripped him of his keys and arose into heaven satan don't have even the opportunity and he couldn't even if he tried amen that's the scapegoat that's why you need to come that's why you need to be bitten that's why you need to say yes i'm running to through the way i'm running to jesus christ because if you cannot point to the scapegoat oh god your excuses won't matter and you will stand speechless because you'll have nothing to say i want to be able to say look to the lamb of god who bore my sin who bore my shame that's why the scriptures say who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect you can't satan can't because he took your blame and you don't have any that's why you're blameless and you don't need an excuse because he's had a lamb who took your sin and your shame hallelujah musicians you can come i'm so thankful he didn't say it's michael's sin he should be the one bearing this he should be hanging on this cross right now why am i taking his why no no he took it from me because he loved me he took it for you because he loved you and there's now now there's therefore now this moment this moment no condemnation you have no guilt no shame no excuses why you need to only have some something on your conscience because he took it all and he surrendered it down to him amen there will be one person that'll be one person one day we'll be rendered speechless i read the scripture the serpent he didn't even get any time and he didn't get he didn't get the time of day to even say nothing and i just kind of chuckled and said no and he didn't he was cursed so he couldn't even talk anymore nothing god took it away he couldn't even down the rest through history he couldn't even say nothing else he could never account to ever talk about the time he could never bring it before eve nothing god said he didn't even give him time today to say anything and cursed him to the ground and and took just completely changed him and it's nothing to say i just thought lord my he adam and eve probably had enough time in their minds oh what do we do to have to have that still being able to to confront them with their problem or what happened in the garden but god said no i rendered him to nothing but you know satan he took that role real well his accuser of the brethren and the scripture says day and night he's still trying to cast well look at that they doing this look at that they doing that look at this they're doing that he's still trying day and night before the lord that's what he's trying to do scripture says in revelations for the accuser of our brother is cast down which accused them before our lord god before our god day and night he tried he tried i don't know why he didn't get the fact that someone that has put their hands on the sacrifice said i'm sorry but my sins were laid upon the scapegoat and i don't have any excuse to give you because it's all on jesus he took it all for me i don't know what you're saying devil because he's trying to bring stuff up from god god's saying i don't i don't hear it either because it can't penetrate through the blood he just he must be standing there day and night and it just must be mute it just must be silence and he looks like he's speaking all the time but god's like i don't know what you're saying hey what a waste of his time but he's trying constantly constantly constantly and he i want you to recognize that that's the same he might do that to you but you need to realize just do it like god is doing in heaven sorry i can't hear you because it can't penetrate the bloodline that can't get through the stream of blood from calvary he he finished it it's over he's a mute may he be mute to you he's mute because you are blameless you are blameless and one day one day one day he will be rendered speechless and he'll have nothing more to say and be cast in a lake of fire and because of scripture after that the scripture after that says because they overcame him by the blood of the lamb that's how you overcome them and that's how you render him speechless and there's no valid excuse you stand there free free amen amen i always pray that you are here tonight and i pray maybe god has allowed just the fog to clear and you can get real honest and say yeah you know what i've put some excuses out there and they i want you to look at them real hard and say because i'm going to tell you again there's no valid excuse and by the grace of god i pray that you can set it there and say lord that's just not worth it it's just not worth it may i be a gideon tonight and may i be able to take you at your word lord has come across the pulpit tonight in some broken up way and maybe just have been able to shine a little bit of light said
