You just may have your seats for a few moments. Praise the Lord. Nice to see you all here and trust you'll ready to enjoy the presence of the Lord as we already are. Isn't it wonderful that we can worship him? &gt;&gt; We have breath in our bodies, &gt;&gt; brother. is not wonderful. We can just worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit and in &gt;&gt; truth. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Can hang on to that thought. That's what we're going to be speaking on in a little bit. Well, we were expecting a family. There's a family driving up from Sacramento and uh Brother Yuri and Sister Valentina. Have they Have they arrived? They've arrived. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, we just want to give them a moment to get in. I was just making that little comment because I didn't know if you had arrived yet or not. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Your wife and family is here. All right. All right. Well, we'll find them a good seat down here, brother Joe, when they come. We're glad that you're here. And uh they'll they'll find a seat for you and and we're just going to welcome when your family comes in. Uh so I I think it's just remarkable these these people have. Well, first I got an email from them just a few days ago and they said we're down here in Sacramento and we we've come from the from the Soviet Union or they've been there four or five years and uh you know just I could just sense some kind of a little hunger for so I answered them right away and and then uh came back another answer and and before I could get that one answered they said we're going to drive up for service. So, here's some folks come from Sacramento. Been driving a long time. I don't know just how far that would be, Brother West, but it's a long ways. Probably be 15 or more hours, I suppose. So, we want to just say God bless them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll greet them in just a few moments. Uh well, we they've came up to the meeting and this is brother Adam and sister Sarah Graham's last Sunday with us. They're going to they're they're not going to desert us. They're just going to take a recess down in Boisee, Idaho. And uh uh they're going to be with Brother Paul and Sister Jerry Hale and their church. And uh brother brother uh Adam is going to work with brother Paul. He's he's got a quite a farm industry and business there which he's been in for quite a few years. And uh brother Adam is going to help him. He needs he needs a good man. And Adam's a good man. Brother Adam, why don't you come up here and say a word of greeting to these people? You can't just leave us without saying something. Don't you all agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. We were over at Brother Adam and Sister Sarah's the other night and here's boxes piled all over the place and she fixed up a big dinner and I said, "Why don't you let us take you out for for dinner instead of having us here when she's doing all that work?" But Adam, well, you know, he's got a good wife. And I can say, Sister Sarah's been just, you've been an ideal sister in Christ and just a quiet spirited uh I'm saying that to you now, sister with a real quiet spirit and and a real example of a believer. Brother Adam. Amen. God bless you. G give us reason for your God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; boy, I was &gt;&gt; really hoping he wasn't going to do this to me. Um uh it's humbling to stand before you all and it's been good to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. for 14 years and um being under brother Biscll's ministry and the other ministers here, we've uh we've grown exponentially um had some failings and but we've had a lot of good results and um unfortunately our pathway seems to be separating at this time and um Um, but we look forward to our new direction that the Lord's given us and um, just to go into a smaller group of believers. There's it's a very small group. It would wouldn't even take up this little side over here. So, we're excited about going there and just putting our shoulder the wheel with brother Paul. And we've really appreciated his ministry and his life and his influence on me. and um believe we'll be able to learn a lot and gain a lot from his experience. Um what can I say? We just we haven't got the chance to fellowship with everybody here but many of you and um we just love you all and we appreciate you. And of course we'll be streaming a lot of the services too, you know, when we can and just um so stay in your places. So, we've heard it how, you know, people abroad want to see where you're at and um well, I guess we're going to experience it. So, make sure you're there on the front row and uh make sure you're smiling for us. And anyway, God bless you. Pray for us. We'll we'll be praying for you. And know in the times that we live in, things are difficult, but God said he wouldn't put any more on us than we could handle. And um &gt;&gt; more than handle, we we're more than overcomers. &gt;&gt; And um we just appreciate you. Love you. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to we'll miss you, Brother Adam, Sister Sarah, and your little ones. And uh I told brother Adam he'll probably be here in August because I I can't see a missing camp being here and and uh they're planning on that. At least I'm planning on that. Amen. A good Washingtonian. I guess that we could say it that way. Have to come back once in a while for this fresh Pacific air. Amen. Well, is as is brother Yuri and sister your wife in Sister I wonder if we could have you stand Valentina and brother Yuri and their four uh four children. God bless you. Thank you so much. Well, when you see them, you can shake hands with them and make them welcome. and the other people here that speak the Russian language and there are several here they're be happy to meet you also we'll see you after the service amen isn't he wonderful &gt;&gt; perhaps we could stand and I'd like to sing a verse of that song uh we just finished singing my hope is in the Lord I think it's the last verse Yeah. Do you have a mic there? Okay. mercies with every [Music] to the sin in his brokenness [Music] to offer healing and forgive and those who trust in him will find their Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, is it forever more? [Music] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Just bow with me in prayer, would you please? Our precious Lord Jesus, how thankful we are we have your name that has been given. the name that's above every name. &gt;&gt; And we can approach the almighty God, creator of heaven and earth in that holy and righteous name. Oh, in that name there's salvation. In that name there is rest and peace and there is comfort. Oh God, in that name is power to lift those that may be encumbered and bound and burdened down. Lift up, oh God, the fallen, I pray. and let your word come and minister today. I pray. Lord, we thank you for our sister Valentina, brother Yuri, and their children that you have brought them safely these many, many miles. Oh God, bless them abundantly. Father, in the day of fellowship that they're able to have, bless your people as we've gathered together, oh God. Bless your children wherever they are gathered, oh God. And may they be fed with the true word of God. We are here for that purpose, Lord. We're here with that single purpose in mind that we might be fed, strengthened, edified, and built up in the inner man. Oh God, enrichen us, I pray. Teach us, oh father, out of the great truths that have been unveiled in this hour. Lord, as I stand here, I stand, Father, with no ability within uh myself. And I pray as your prophet has prayed that he may move out of the way and be set aside and that you would come forward. And we've asked this already in prayer in the study. And I pray that you will glorify yourself. Make yourself manifest, oh God. Do those things which will get glory to your name. Show forth your power, I pray. Fill those that need to be filled with your spirit, oh God. Deliver those that are bound. Heal those that are sick. I pray that you will bring redemption and salvation to any that may not know you as yet. Draw them. Draw them. &gt;&gt; We thank you, oh God, for bringing our brother Kim home and for making his trip a successful journey. So much to do and you needed to give him wisdom, oh God. Oh, the Holy Ghost with the gift of wisdom, Father, still available to the believer. And now, Lord, I pray you'll just move us, move us into a higher plane &gt;&gt; and prepare us, oh God, in this rapture age that we are in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please take your Bibles and turn if you would to John's Gospel, the 8th chapter. We're going to begin reading at the 30th verse. And I would ask that you would be just as reverend and keep your thoughts focused because we uh sometime we approach subjects that go beyond beyond the minister and this is certainly one of them. And uh uh but we just like to bring some things that the Lord has made real to us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful time Friday night. Our brother after the prayer time and brother Daniel from down Tacoma, he gave his gave a testimony at least part of a testimony and he took it from when he was just a a young person. We didn't know what he was going to say, of course, but he took it from when he was just a child, perhaps six, seven, eight years old until he was 16 and had such a desire for God. And I was very, very touched. He said that his mother, his father was a Catholic, his mother was not a Catholic. She became a believer in this message and she was the only one of the family that did. And he said that she would read him stories of out of the Bible. He says, "And he learned to love God." He just fell in love with God. &gt;&gt; From hearing those stories from his mother. I want to say to you sisters, don't ever weary. Don't ever be wearied with telling your children about God, about the living God in the scripture. And we really enjoyed that, brother Daniel. And so, God bless you. All right, we'll read together now. I'm starting with the 30th verse. And as he spake these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, if you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed. Notice that the discipleship disciplehip depended on if they continued in his word. And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. They answered unto him. They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed, and we're never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?" Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committh sin is the servant of sin, and the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth uh abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my father, and you do that which you have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, if you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. But now you seek to kill me in a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God. This did not Abraham. You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, we be not born of fornication. We have one father, even God. Excuse me. Jesus said unto them, if God were your father, ye would love me. For I proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of myself, but he sent me. You do not. Why do you not understand my speech? Even because you cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lust of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it. May God bless his word. You may have your seats. Really uh some powerful statements here. I want to take from the words of our Lord Jesus and things which uh the prophet of God has spoken. But Jesus said uh that in verse 31 he said to those Jews because it said that many believed on him. So then he said to them if you continue in my word and to continue is to remain and to dwell. So if you continue, it's not just a visit in the message. It is something that is becomes now a part of your life. You are there and you have taken it. You're going to dwell with it. You're going to endure. And uh it also has a reference to the state or condition of a person to remain as one and not to become another or different. And uh and you that have been believers, you no doubt have experienced where where uh those have come uh they have received Christ, have come to the knowledge of the message, but over a period of time they change become something that's very very different from what they were when they received Christ. I think that the the program of God is that we uh come to the knowledge of the revelation of Christ in his word and then that revelation should simply increase get more wonderful more glorious should just have an effect on us and we should be transformed by that transforming power &gt;&gt; of the revealing of Jesus Christ. That's the program. That's the program. We don't come into the knowledge of of Christ and the knowledge of the word and then become more worldly. That's not the program. &gt;&gt; We don't come in with the fire and zeal of God and then cool off. That's not the program. It may not be the same uh you know, we may not be exactly the same in in our zeal for God. It may be something else that we are doing or it may be different. Uh as time goes on our children may be just babies at one point then later on they're teenagers but your desire never changes for God. You teach your children. You teach and you teach your uh your uh uh adult children and you are a brother and and a sister in Christ to those that sit beside you. And you were not only filled with the spirit at one time but remain filled with the spirit so that you can affect others. We are to be to edify the body of Christ. That's what he said. Continue. If you continue then indeed you are my my children. So then my disciples. So we're not to change. And then he said and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. How important is truth? And here's where I will uh certainly uh get into swimming water for myself and perhaps not be able to uh express adequately really what's what I see and feel. But truth is something that is so vital. I've titled the message absolute truth. And uh it's important that we have just a a a thought of what the scripture is. And in in the Old Testament when they spoke of truth, they spoke of something that was firm and stability. &gt;&gt; That was truth. Firmness and stability. So just have that in your mind. Truth is infallible. &gt;&gt; Truth is incapable of making a mistake. &gt;&gt; Truth cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Truth is supreme. &gt;&gt; Truth is un unadulterated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Truth is pure &gt;&gt; and truth is perfect. &gt;&gt; So all of these things are they're almost in the stratosphere as far as our human thinking is. something that's firm. This this world is not firm. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nothing around us is firm or stable. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going to be announced tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen in the world tomorrow. Today we may be relatively at peace and and you know have enough to eat and everything else and tomorrow the the bottom can fall out. We say well we've had an economic collapse. It can still collapse more. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen. We don't have any idea. And I am absolutely certain of one thing. Someone who tries to stay a breast of what is taking place just so I can, you know, have a have an understanding in the light of what the prophet has spoken about this age that we are in. I can tell you for myself, I don't believe anybody has a handle on it. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? Yes. &gt;&gt; Not the prime minister of our not the president of the United States, not any leader of the world, whether it's the G8 or the G20 or however many they gather around and they just had a a huge conference over in in in Europe and and they want to make some decision on the environment and etc. They couldn't even come to the first decision. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; All the leaders of the world couldn't even come to the first decision. couldn't even decide how to do it. &gt;&gt; Here we have Haiti on our hands and uh uh uh million a million or more people without a tart. Brother Andre Pati just emailed us a couple of days ago and and he's coming back now and they put a a committee together and here this people has been a month without food and without shelter and and uh the a million people living under tarps and now the rainy season comes and and I mean there's no no possibility even of the basic cleanliness. Listen friends, we're here. We got our homes, whatever we have, but it's not very many, not too many hours by plane. And there's believers there, several thousand of them. And we thank God we only have a record of 18 believers that went and they don't say they were killed. They said they went to be with the Lord, which is exactly true. &gt;&gt; That's the That's the truth. They went to be with the Lord. 18 out of several thousand believers. And brother Pat was gathered with about 4,500 in two or three different places. 4,500 believers. And God has spared them. And we have one testimony after another after another. It would take us too much time this morning of buildings collapsing. And and and do you know that they had a whole group of people and the pastor was speaking and the people were worshiping and the whole building began to collapse and he and he just instructed the people, "Keep worshiping. keep worshiping. And the people kept worshiping and the building fell down around them and slowly they brought they managed to get everybody out. I don't know how many were in there. And you know what the word they used? Not a scratch. &gt;&gt; Not a scratch. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, God is a living God. &gt;&gt; God protects his own. &gt;&gt; God does things right. And I am so so thankful for that. And yet here we have all the world uh you know community rushed down with all kinds of supplies to for the people and they can't quite figure out the system to get it to the people and that is you have it was just so amazing. Here was the airport was absolutely jammed with aircraft and uh and supplies piled high and medical supplies and just off the tarmac was a was a hospital, improvised hospital and people wounded and people needing amputations and every kind of thing. And they couldn't get the supplies from walking distance from the tarmac to that little hospital. Isn't this bizarre? &gt;&gt; You talk about not being able to put things together, not being able to come with a correct kind of decision, and we're not talking about that. This just is a small focus, but it's all throughout the world this way. &gt;&gt; People are starving that don't need to starve. &gt;&gt; People are in need that don't need to be in need. And then we have countries like we have here where we have too much. We may even think we're in need, but even in our need, we have too much compared to others. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; We have things too easy. We have things too grand, you know, compared to others in the world. And yet you you want to do something and you can't even find a channel because there's no channel provided. It's so difficult. So difficult. &gt;&gt; And so now I think of this world that we're in. I will say this, there's very little truth out there. &gt;&gt; Very little that's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you think of the original creation, I'll come into this a little later on, but the original creation is true &gt;&gt; in the fact that God said, "Let every seed bring forth after its own kind." &gt;&gt; And the pansy comes up and you know what? It's a pansy &gt;&gt; and the seed falls in the ground and the next year it's still a pansy. The next year it's not a carrot. &gt;&gt; It's not something else. &gt;&gt; That's what the that's what they were referring to when they say when we become a believer, we're not to become something else. &gt;&gt; When we become a believer, it isn't that we become later on a theologian. &gt;&gt; We should remain a believer. Yes, &gt;&gt; we come in in the fervor and zeal of the Holy Ghost. It isn't that we just settle back and we're at ease in Zion. That's not the program. &gt;&gt; Let every seed bring forth after its own kind. And so, every seed we find is true to itself. the life that's in the seed is true to what was spoken bring forth after its own kind. And so the animal kingdom and uh the creatures of the sea, they bring forth after their own kind. And we're not surprised at that. But now the scripture says this, and I'd like you to notice because it's going to verse 32 says, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." &gt;&gt; Not something that's diluted, not something that's perverted, not something that's like the truth, but the truth. Not something that perhaps sounds like the truth because you can have people use the same jargon, the same phrases, but the truth &gt;&gt; shall make you free. &gt;&gt; And then in verse 36, Jesus said, "If the son," now it's not you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. But now he's he's redefined it a wee bit. If the Son, because he's the one that's truth, &gt;&gt; if the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's if the Son shall make you free. You know, all of God's word is true. &gt;&gt; All of God's word is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we could say it another way as to say it in the prophet's words. God's word in its entirety is true. &gt;&gt; The entire the entire uh the whole composite word of God is true. &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with that. However, one of the foundation truths of the prophet's message is that it is the word in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we could say Christ in its season. Christ in his season. The word in its season is what's true because you could quote some scripture and that's that's why brother Brandham says that Moses could not use Noah's message. He could not say we'll build an ark and float the people down the Nile River. It wouldn't work because it was not the message for his season. &gt;&gt; It was not the word for his season. And neither could Christ uh use Moses' message. And so we could say, but was not the word the truth in Noah's time? Absolutely. And so it is it remains truth, but it's not applicable. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work for you because we're not in Noah's time or Moses time or the patriarch's time. We are in this season that we're in. And so the truth it must be qualified that the whole word of God is truth but it's not all truth for you uh in that comprehensive way because it was truth for the people in their time and there is a there is a portion of this word that is true for us in this time and so how do we identify truth if it's the truth truth that sets a person free. And my people people may say, "Well, I'm not bound. I'm not." You see, that's what this that's what the Pharisees felt. Those that had believed on him. And then Jesus said to them, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." They said, "We're not in bondage. &gt;&gt; We're not in bondage. We've never been in bondage to any man." &gt;&gt; And they believed it. &gt;&gt; And so they said, "We're not in bondage." And you notice that when uh when they when they spoke to him, they answered him. Notice their answer very I wished I had this on the screen for you, but I didn't have sufficient time. They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed," which they were, and were never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou, you shall be made free? Notice now when they said, "How sayest thou, you shall be made free." Uh um you shall be made free. They didn't ask about the truth. They didn't say, "Well, what is it that's truth?" So the subject was not the truth. The subject that they wanted to debate with him was we're not in bondage. We're not free. We can prove that we're not in bondage. We're free. We can do what we wish. we worship the way we want and so on. But that wasn't the point. The Jesus was saying to them, the subject matter, the crux of the matter was you shall know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth shall make you free. So they were jumping to the conclusion said we're already free but they were not free. And so it's possible to be in bondage and still believe that one is free. &gt;&gt; So then we want to say we're going to be free. what am I going to be free from? There may be even something today that uh you have even as a believer. A believer can have something in their life. They can have fears. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just speak about some things just for a moment. I'm just throwing a few things out. They can have fears. &gt;&gt; They can have questions or doubts. &gt;&gt; And God wants to dispel those. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by a preacher per se, but by the word of truth. &gt;&gt; The truth is what makes a person free. Oh, it's wonderful to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; And we'll come to it in a few moments. How can we know this mighty subject of truth? &gt;&gt; How will we be able to identify what's going to make us free? How can we identify it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Even as believers, you know, we have things that we bear unnecessarily. &gt;&gt; We have burdens we bear unnecessarily. We have fears. We perhaps have sicknesses. So God may allow us sickness. But on the other hand, we may have it simply because we are not reaching out for it. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. We we don't want to have a congregation where Satan pulls the wool over our eyes or over anybody's eyes. I say you do not have to live under his oppression. You don't have to live under his depression. You don't have to live under his disease and sickness. You do not have to be tormented by him. You do not have to have complexes from him. You don't have to have anything that comes out of his kingdom. for the truth will make you free from it. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to just I'd like you just to please really hang on to my words this morning because I uh I'm under a certain strain to bring it to you. The first thing, anything that anyone has or may experience outside of the kingdom of God is a result of a lie. &gt;&gt; A lie that Satan spoke through the serpent &gt;&gt; to Eve. Anything that you may experience of this world or that Satan would try to impose upon you has come because of the lie in Eden, &gt;&gt; the first lie. And that is why Jesus who was full of grace and truth came out of the bosom of God. And we could say as God spoke to the serpent and said that the woman's seed will bruise your head. You'll bruise his heel, but he'll bruise your head. And if you look in the Hebrew, it says he'll crush his head. &gt;&gt; So the truth has crushed his head. &gt;&gt; We say Jesus hung on Calvary. I'll say the truth hung on Calvary &gt;&gt; to dispose of and to do away with the lie of Eden. &gt;&gt; He was going to eradicate and we can't be his children and and still be under the influence that somehow we have to bear under the s under the Satan's lie. We don't have to. That's why Jesus came and we can say the truth hung on Calvary. We can say the truth stripped him of death, hell, and the grave. The keys. The truth did that not for himself. He didn't have to do it for himself. He did it for you &gt;&gt; and he did it for me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And so therefore, if the son will make you free, it was Christ in Moses back there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "Abraham rejoiced to He saw my day and he rejoiced to see my day." &gt;&gt; It was Christ back there. &gt;&gt; It was Christ in Joseph. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; It was the son. And what did Joseph do? What did what did he what did the son do in those people when he was revealed to those people? There was a deliverance. There was a a a movement. There was something of reality that took place. It wasn't true that the it was not of truth that the people should be in bondage to Egypt. So, it was truth that removed them out of there. Truth is a powerful thing, friends. So he said that th this is another day in the message the identified Christ of all ages. He said what would it what would it have done? Now I know that this is elementary for me many of you but just follow me please. But what good would it have done Moses to come with Noah's message? What good would it have done John the Baptist to come with Moses message? So we could say, "Was not Moses' message truth?" &gt;&gt; Or would we tear all that portion out of the Bible? &gt;&gt; No. Because it was truth, but it was truth for them. &gt;&gt; Not that it's not truth when you read it today. We read it, but it's a historical thing for us. &gt;&gt; And that is why people who said, uh, I've had people say, "I live by the Ten Commandments." Oh, that's a big lie. Right? &gt;&gt; Nobody's living by the Ten Commandments. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. The Ten Commandments came to show you you were a sinner. &gt;&gt; That's why they came. &gt;&gt; The Ten Commandments came as a policeman to throw you in jail and to give you a guilty conscience. Nobody's living by the Ten Commandments. &gt;&gt; And so John the Baptist could not come with Moses message. Not because it wasn't truth. It was truth for them back then, but it wasn't truth for John the Baptist day. And they said, "Brother Vandom saying, we haven't got Sanki's message." Many of you may not know Sanki. He was a great singer. We haven't got Moody's message. The Moody Bible Institute came from Moody's ministry. We've got the message of this hour. So he wasn't saying Sanki was false and Moody was false. He was just saying we haven't got their truth. &gt;&gt; Their truth won't work for us. &gt;&gt; We have the message of this day. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet is saying friends that there is a truth &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; And the truth isn't because we come to Bible way or go to any other message church. That doesn't make it truth and that doesn't make us true. Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes beyond that. &gt;&gt; We have to know. We have to be able to identify what is the truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "We've got the message of this hour. We haven't got Luther's message or Wesley's message." They were all right. &gt;&gt; That's right. But this is another day. &gt;&gt; This is another promise &gt;&gt; and this is another church age. &gt;&gt; So this church age simply cannot function or the the the tactic and the warfare that Satan will conduct upon the people of this day. We cannot be free from it. We cannot overcome him with some mere history &gt;&gt; that John the Baptist had or Luther had. That's why those churches go into bondage because there is not truth of this hour to set them free. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He said Jesus Christ the same yesterday. What was my message the other day? Today &gt;&gt; today &gt;&gt; today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not we're not concerned as we're sitting here about the forever part. And we're certainly not concerned with yesterday's part. That was for Luther's part, Wesley's part. We're concerned about the today part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That we that we can identify truth &gt;&gt; and we can say this is my portion. &gt;&gt; And this truth I don't have to take the truth and make wind it up and make it work. This truth will make me free. Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I sell that truth will transform you. &gt;&gt; Say, be free from what &gt;&gt; we want to be free. One thing I want to be free from is this old clay carcass. &gt;&gt; And truth will make you free. &gt;&gt; Truth will change your body. &gt;&gt; If a prophet hadn't said it that you'll feel a sweep over you, we couldn't be in expectation. But truth has put us into expectation. And it's the truth. You won't change your body. Truth will change your body. &gt;&gt; And those that are asleep in the grave, don't forget they died in the faith. &gt;&gt; Truth will free them from the grave. &gt;&gt; They certainly need to be set free. &gt;&gt; And we sitting here today, we need to be free from this old carcass. We need to be free from our old our own our own thoughts and the restrictions and the feathers of them. Oh God, I pray you'll take uh take the by the Holy Spirit and and defeat Satan in the battleground of our minds. &gt;&gt; If I ask for hands to be shown, there's a good number of you. I know it is you. I know it is true that there's a good number sitting right here in this congregation that that Satan wars in your mind. &gt;&gt; There's a battle goes on in your mind. But the God that I serve and the God that brought you into this message wants you to be free from that warfare. &gt;&gt; We have a battle, but we should fight the battle. Take the word of truth, defeat him, and then you're free from it. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be free from it. [Applause] That's why people go into drugs and they go into alcohol and they go into pleasures of sin and they go into just pleasures that may not be sinful as such but they go into pleasures. People are consumed with the Olympics and and and and I tell you what it's a huge huge thing now. It's just a Vancouver is a big party place. &gt;&gt; True. Right. &gt;&gt; I was saddened said in the newspaper that all the people that have come and especially international reporters from all countries of the world all the and dignitaries and former presidents and vice presidents and whatever more are here. It was much bigger than I thought it was going to be because we don't follow it that much. But they said they found that Vancouver is gay friendly, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Vancouver is pot friendly. &gt;&gt; Vancouver was something else friendly. And I thought I would to God that they could have said Vancouver is God conscious. &gt;&gt; Vancouver is God friendly, &gt;&gt; but it's a godless place. San Francisco, Los Angeles, these West Coast nations are godless places. It is so all over the world. &gt;&gt; But it just seems that we're conscious of it. &gt;&gt; Yes, truth has so told me. Truth has said that God's going to destroy this world. And I felt so compelled here in the last meeting or two, don't be found where that very good friend of ours, I and my wife used to be our pianist when I pastored in Dawson Creek, a Pentecostal pastor's wife. But when she heard of the earthquake in San Francisco, she was on the phone immediately. Why didn't she call some other Pentecostal pastor? No, she called me. What did brother Brandham say about the earthquake? Did he say, "I heard he said there was going to be three." Now she's trying to draw on what God's vindicated prophet has said because deep in her heart of hearts, she knew that was the source &gt;&gt; and she knew that ministry was true. &gt;&gt; And so she wanted to draw on it right away in the hour of need. I can tell you, don't wait till then. &gt;&gt; It'll be way too late then. We want to be walking in the fullness of it now. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here, friends, so we might gain some understanding of what God wants us to know. Not yesterday or forever, but today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Help me out. &gt;&gt; He said, "How astounding it is." Listen to the prophet saying, "How astounding it is how blind people can get in the age. But it's got to be that way. Lukewarm in this age. The Bible said that they'd be spewed out of his mouth in this leodyian age. &gt;&gt; Aren't you rejoicing today? Thank God that what I hear out of the very mouth of my bridegroom is his words of instruction, is his words of enlightenment, and I'm not being spewed out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; I am in Christ. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; But as many as he loves, he chastens and rebukes. &gt;&gt; He spoke it would be this way in the day of this day and age. And in the rapture message, he said, "Flesh and blood never reveal this to you." &gt;&gt; I say that to all of us that are here and within the sound of my voice and those that are on the internet streaming, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. and let us rejoice over that. &gt;&gt; But he said, "But my father &gt;&gt; uh which is in heaven has revealed this to you." He has revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; It isn't something you learn through going to a church or even just reading some book because you had have to do more than listen to a tape or read a book. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the father &gt;&gt; that reveals what you're reading &gt;&gt; because otherwise you might put it back 40 years ago or we read about, you know, what Jesus did and put it back 2,000 years ago. No, there is a message for this hour. There's a word for this season. &gt;&gt; There's a word for this people. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here in service this morning. And he says, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church." And brother Brandham injects here the revelation of the word in its season. &gt;&gt; That's what he'll do. That's how he builds his church. It's the revelation of the word in its season. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, I don't want to just preach a message this morning. I want you to I want to ignite something in your soul. Oh God, I want you to become desperate. Oh God, reveal what I need right in this season. &gt;&gt; Reveal what is my portion &gt;&gt; in this season today &gt;&gt; what I need today. We don't know what we're going to face tomorrow. &gt;&gt; But God wants to give you today &gt;&gt; what you'll need tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And God proves that it's his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By vindicating. So I asked Pilate said, "What is truth?" &gt;&gt; He like the Pharisees, he didn't really want to know either &gt;&gt; because when he said, "What is truth?" Then the Bible says, "And then he walked and left." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't even wait for an answer. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? &gt;&gt; I want you to think about this, please. &gt;&gt; That's right. Here is the supreme authority of the government order of that day. The supreme authority. And governments are supposed to function on the truth. &gt;&gt; And he was there to determine why is this man being condemned to be crucified? And he's struggling. And his wife has a dream, but he's struggling. And he's saying to them, I don't find any fault in this man. I don't find anything worthy of death in this man. And they're saying, "Crucify him. Crucify him." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And he's being persuaded. And then he said to Jesus, "Are you a king?" He said, "For this purpose came I enter the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Pilate went back out and said, "Shall I crucify your king?" And they said, "We have no king but Caesar." &gt;&gt; And they put they put fear into him because they said, you know, if you let him go, who's one who's declaring to be a king or the people want to make a king, you can't be a friend of Caesar. &gt;&gt; There'll be a problem, a political problem. and he submitted to their will and to his fear and whatever more and let Christ made a decision, a false decision, &gt;&gt; a decision from darkness. But God knew &gt;&gt; they were going to make that decision. That was all in the program of God. &gt;&gt; But still, and I find it such a paradox. The man who's supposed to have truth, the man who's sitting in the highest position of government is supposed to make a decision. He's a he's in the judicial system, but he makes a he makes a a decision based on falsehood, &gt;&gt; based on what the people are saying. And they even brought in false witnesses. &gt;&gt; And so he makes a decision based on false witnesses, even against his own conviction. So now I have been speaking these last series of services and I've even heard it I've gotten it from emails. I've gotten it from some of you that have spoken to me that there seems to be a certain emphasis seems to be a certain channel, a certain direction and there is and I can sum it up by saying this that what I've been stressing and what I've been emphasizing because I feel it. It's something it's not something I'm trying to teach people, but it's something that I've experienced within myself and I trust that others can lay hold of it. I'm emphasizing the importance of the message as being our absolute. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I want to deal with something here. I've heard ministers and they've said it to me and I've heard it over the pulpits and they said this is our absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the message but this word of God is our absolute. And I can say amen to that. But then I have another question. Why is he saying this is our absolute? &gt;&gt; And most of the time there's a second ulterior motive. is because he has a personal he has a personal doctrine he wants to bring forward that is not in harmony with the message. &gt;&gt; So he's wanting to take his own interpretation of the word and present it to the people as being the truth &gt;&gt; over and above what the prophet of God has said. &gt;&gt; But I cannot accept that. And the reason why I can say that the message is is the absolute because &gt;&gt; as brother Brandham said, did the angel tell you that? Did the angel say that? He said if the angel said anything that was contrary to the word of God, I would not believe the angel. So in that this is the absolute but the message is the absolute revelation of this word &gt;&gt; and the message will not stray away from this word. &gt;&gt; If you find something in the message that's outside of the word of God, you've got the wrong understanding. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; I want to deal with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I've I've experienced it. I've seen it. It's troubled me. And I wouldn't want anybody to, you know, to see that and stumble over it because, oh, is it the message is the absolute or is it the word of God that's the absolute? The word of God is the absolute. And the message is the absolute revelation of the word of God. for our season. &gt;&gt; God did not send the messenger now to give us a great understanding of everything that Moses did cuz that's not our season &gt;&gt; and that's not his commission. He's a seventh church age messenger to the Leodysian church age &gt;&gt; and the Lord Jesus speaking to him speaking to the messenger of the last church age and it would be it would be to brother Brandham. This is a this is a scripture to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And under the angel of the church of the Leodysans, write these things saith the amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the faithful &gt;&gt; and true witness. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying to him, &gt;&gt; what you are going to hear &gt;&gt; is the true witness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Not something different, but this is the truth of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it making clear being clear to you? &gt;&gt; So now listen close because I'm going to tie it down as tight as I can &gt;&gt; in a perfect message, perfect faith. He said he manifests his word &gt;&gt; to show that it is his word. &gt;&gt; So he manifested how with supernatural happenings. with supernatural things. We say, "Well, the world, Pentecost, all kinds, Catholics get healing, have supernatural things." But that that sign doesn't have a voice. &gt;&gt; The supernatural sign, the manifestation must have a voice and that voice must unveil the word of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; So even people within the message say, "Well, we must be true because we have this sign or we have this manifestation." That doesn't prove anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God come, and I'm going to give you now some very, very strong quotes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said that he manifest his word to show that it is his word. In other words, even the manifestation that God causes to happen, the supernatural that God causes to happen, he does that to prove that what is spoken is his word. &gt;&gt; He said a scripture fulfillment to prove that it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you believe it when you pass by, &gt;&gt; will you?" And he was asking the people to pass by and when hands were laid on them. So he said the word that God is vindicating, this is my statement now. The word that God is vindicating or proving now, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice, &gt;&gt; the voice of the sign, &gt;&gt; the sign has a voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Apostle Paul said these words, and I'm staying on this subject. study to show thyself approved unto God. &gt;&gt; A workman that needeth needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing &gt;&gt; the word of what? &gt;&gt; Truth. In other words, the word of truth can be wrongly divided. &gt;&gt; It's still the word of truth. But it's not being divided correctly. &gt;&gt; And so it's important that we see now what does this mean? dividing the word of truth. To divide it is to cut straight &gt;&gt; to hue to the line &gt;&gt; to proceed on a straight path. &gt;&gt; It's not this way and then that way and this way, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; oh, help me. &gt;&gt; Because I I I need to draw from some things and &gt;&gt; and sometimes I question whether I should or not. But I I had I had a tape from a man, a minister, this message and he's not ministering today and I just have to say, "Excuse me, but thank God he's not ministering &gt;&gt; because he had a tape on." He said, "Now this tape is to correct what I said last week." In other what I said last week was wrong. I admire him for doing that. But then persuade a bunch of people that that was correct and that was like a thus sayeth the Lord and then come a week or two later and say, "Well, forget that and now believe this." What confidence are the people going to have that what he's saying now is the truth. &gt;&gt; And that is why it's so important. That is why if I hear a man quoting from the message and supporting uh spiritual truth, you want to pay attention to it because we're taking the messenger word of the hour. To me, it's Elijah that was sent. &gt;&gt; It's a seventh messenger that was sent. &gt;&gt; It's Revelation 10:7 that's speaking. &gt;&gt; It's Revelation 3:14:15. It is Christ who's standing on the outside saying, knocking, trying to come in. He's the one who's speaking. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not William Brandom speaking. It is the Lord Jesus Christ himself using him as a vessel. I've been stressing that friends because I've been so troubled when people hear what he said and then lay it aside or disregard it. And that though that's not so important because right now we have to tend to this. Listen to me friends. You've got to be able to support your life by the life of the word of God. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said that if the life of uh uh Da Vinci was in him that he'd do great painting. If the life of Bach was in him, he would write symphonies. And if the life of Jesus Christ is in you, you will do what? The word of God, you'll live this kind of a life, &gt;&gt; not another life. &gt;&gt; We are being injected. &gt;&gt; Amen. By the message of this hour, we're being injected through the hearing of the word down into the channel of the soul. We're being inoculated with the very life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not another, but his life &gt;&gt; rightly dividing. And dividing is not only to cut straight or to proceed on a straight path. It's to hold a straight course. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that this messenger held a straight course. &gt;&gt; A million and a half dollars given to him. &gt;&gt; Which he would not accept because it he said, "For me to receive that," he said, "I'd go crazy." He told me, "I just go crazy." He said, "I'm not I'm not made to handle that kind of money." He said, "I just, you know, I have my ministry and I have a little little office and so on. and the popularity &gt;&gt; and the great denominational system that said, "We'd like you to represent us and you will never have to worry again about the paying for your meetings and the expenses. Your financial woes and concerns are finished." &gt;&gt; Said, "You'll have to make, we'd ask you to make two or three minor changes." &gt;&gt; And he said, "What are they? What do you consider a minor change? Well, they said, "Well, uh, baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the oneness of the Godhead." He said, "You consider that &gt;&gt; a minor change?" &gt;&gt; You see, Satan, friends, he will use the same tactic on us. &gt;&gt; He tries to make something that has been declared to us as kind of unimportant. Well, yeah, it's there. Yeah, you know, it is the word of God. Well, yeah, you know, the prophet of God said it, but but you know, it's just not that significant. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; It is significant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rightly dividing is to teach the truth directly. &gt;&gt; Amen. and correctly. &gt;&gt; But it comes from a more comprehensive a word with a more comprehensive meaning and it is to cut but not just to cut but it is exact as it were. And the word they used is to keep hacking and brother Brandham uses the word chopping. &gt;&gt; And God took his prophets to chop his word &gt;&gt; to chop his people out by his word. And quite frankly, some of us needed it to be chopped. &gt;&gt; Not we as an individual, but the things that was hanging on to us. We needed to be chopped free. &gt;&gt; And it says, "But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is Himanius and Felitus." But who concerning the truth, now listen once again, who concerning the truth have aired, &gt;&gt; saying the resurrection is passed already. Ah, this is very very important. I'm coming to now. So the truth can be absolute truth, but it must not be misplaced. &gt;&gt; The resurrection was truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is truth. &gt;&gt; But they're they aired by saying it's already passed. &gt;&gt; We've had it in this day. &gt;&gt; We've had it in the message. Well, that's all passed. We don't need anything to do with it. And I would say, and I have had personal conversations. I said, "Where do you find that in the message?" &gt;&gt; Well, they couldn't really find in the message, but they were caught up in a in a in incredible revelation. Well, that's all passed and this is all finished. There's people that send me. You ought to see some of the stuff that I'm sent here to the office that we're already in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. If we're in the millennium, I don't think I want to go. &gt;&gt; Do you? &gt;&gt; You want just more of this? &gt;&gt; No. The millennium, that's not what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; but they will take this quote and that quote, and listen, there's nothing wrong with the quotes, but it's how they link them together. And by the time they tie this quote and that quote and you get to the end of their quotes, then you have a doctrine &gt;&gt; that they're trying to put forward. But when you when you look at that doctrine, you cannot find it in the word of God. And you certainly won't find it in the message. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've had people say in the message, "No more people can get saved." They said it to me, no more people can get saved. It's all over. &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you that there's a good number of you that have come in since then. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I have a book in my bookshelf that this whole thing's all wrapped up back in the they took, you know, the figures number 17 and the 17 this and 17 that and they worked it up. I don't see brother Brandham making anything big out of the number 17. But they they had it all figured out and it was all over. &gt;&gt; Did they ever come and say, you know, Brother Biscll, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I want to repent over that. &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you what brother Brandham said. That's a that's a demon spirit &gt;&gt; that tells you that something is going to be &gt;&gt; and it's not there. You won't find it in the message, &gt;&gt; but they've taken this this this quote and that quote and and a few and even some even some sentences of brother Ben, they cut them right in half because the latter part of the half the latter part of the sentence doesn't fit. It may even go against what they're trying to bring forward. So, they just put the first half there. How many of you folks know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Sure, we're not ignorant. Those are Satan's devices to distract you from the truth &gt;&gt; to some man's thoughts. &gt;&gt; I say I deny it. &gt;&gt; If it's not in the message, just deny it. &gt;&gt; Say this is the way we're going or this is the way we worship or this. We want to find that in the word of God. &gt;&gt; The resurrection is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they'd misplaced it. &gt;&gt; And the and Apostle Paul says they've aired. They've aired concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection's already passed and it had a result. Listen to this. And overthrow the faith of some. &gt;&gt; So it had an effect. &gt;&gt; And they were saying the resurre resurrection's over. And the people knew there had to be a resurrection. It's over. Yeah. And and and they had good reason to say it. This this isn't long. They were walking in the streets of Jerusalem. Our people saw them. It wasn't only Jesus that raised, but many were seen in the streets of Jerusalem. The resurrection is passed. &gt;&gt; That's who the resurrection's passed. You know what also was the problem? They were not the messenger. &gt;&gt; Paul was the messenger. So they were trying to bring something that Paul wasn't saying. &gt;&gt; You know, we all have our opinions. Well, opinions are fine. That's okay. Doctrines and special revelations, etc. that divide in the message, not what the prophet said. Then if it's not what the prophet said, then just forget it. &gt;&gt; Just forget it. Leave it. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with saying I'm going to stay with what he said? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with a quote that he said, "Say what the message says. Say what the tape says." &gt;&gt; Say, "Why am I putting so much emphasis on that?" I'll tell you why right now. I'm coming to it. Because brother Brandham said, and he said it many times, now listen, you're here as believers of this message. Here's the source of this message. A vessel that would stand there and say, now I've preached, if he doesn't come now &gt;&gt; and prove what I've said &gt;&gt; as being the truth, &gt;&gt; he said, then you don't believe me. Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't say that, but I can say I'm hanging on as tight as I can &gt;&gt; to what he said. &gt;&gt; I've asked all kinds of believers, did brother Brandham say that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, no. They can't really find it, but this is their conviction. This is their opinion. This is so Why don't we stay with what he said? &gt;&gt; And if you can't find it there, forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I say that because that's not him speaking. That's Jesus Christ speaking to the bride &gt;&gt; to give you instruction for the hour that you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I said earlier that in the original creation, every seed was to bring forth after its own kind. Amen. &gt;&gt; From the plant life, botney life to the sea and the creatures of the earth. And then God said, "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness and every seed brought forth after its own kind. Whatever is planted, that's what is harvested." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But then, Brother Brandon puts it another way. He puts it cell upon cell. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he's coming into something that really speaks to our new body and speaks to our life that we have even right now. &gt;&gt; So he says, "And if you were ordained from the beginning of the earth to that word, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen." &gt;&gt; I want everybody's attention. If you were ordained from the beginning to that word, if you were if you were ordained to this message, ordained to that word, every word will come right on top of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you were ordained from the beginning, &gt;&gt; with a seed of God, &gt;&gt; the gene or the germ of God in you, &gt;&gt; every word, because that is word, every word of God for this season that you need will come on top of that word &gt;&gt; because it has to build a body &gt;&gt; in the rapture. He said, "You didn't become a human germ from your father and then the next thing you become a germ from a dog &gt;&gt; or the next thing from a cat or the next thing from a chicken." It was all human germs. &gt;&gt; So, this is a powerful spiritual truth. The very fact that you're sitting here, &gt;&gt; you're either sitting here filling a seat or you're sitting here because God called you. And if God called you, then for sure I can say God put a word in you from the before the beginning. &gt;&gt; And what you're here for is so that another cell can come on top of that. So that the word of God that has come by the messenger will come to that word. And word will come upon word until you're transformed into the very likeness of Jesus Christ. And that's why we're called the body of Jesus Christ. That's how that body is built. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said it's all human germ. &gt;&gt; And then he carries on and I have this highlighted red and yellow. And the body of Jesus Christ, the bride will be part of his body. &gt;&gt; So now his body is a word body. Amen. &gt;&gt; His body is made up of individuals such as you. &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet says you are word. &gt;&gt; We are word in flesh. &gt;&gt; How do we know &gt;&gt; that we have the truth? Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you I would have a big problem with the message if it didn't have the degree, the power, the indescribable proof &gt;&gt; that it was God. &gt;&gt; If I didn't have that messenger standing &gt;&gt; over and over and over again. If he doesn't come and confirm what I've said as being the truth, then you forget what I've said. &gt;&gt; Just go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like that kind of a preacher. &gt;&gt; I like that kind of a voice. &gt;&gt; Because he's saying it doesn't matter that all these people been healed. It doesn't matter that all these miracles have taken place. It takes more than miracles. We're not born again by signs and wonders. We're born again by the incorruptible word of God. So, how do we know? Now, that's a nice phrase that I can say because it's in the Bible. How do you know you're born of the incorruptible word of God? &gt;&gt; Because you must be able to confess, &gt;&gt; I have received &gt;&gt; all that he has said. &gt;&gt; All that he has said. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when we get right down to really where we live, it can be very quiet. [Music] But the sisters in the congregation need to be able to say, "My husband is the head of my home and he is the one that is to hear from God and he is the priest of the home." The husbands have to be able to say according to that same word, I have assumed that responsibility. I am the spiritual head of this home. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say to my children, "Walk in father's footsteps." &gt;&gt; And do as your mother and father do. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say, "I care for my people. I care for my family. I care for my children." That's the husband's responsibility. &gt;&gt; Those are Is that in the message? &gt;&gt; That gets down to where we live, doesn't it? And to you children and you young people, in order to say, "I'm a believer of this message," you have to be able to say, "I honor my father and my mother." &gt;&gt; I honor them. My dad and I, we disagreed on some points. We disagreed, but I never never ceased to honor him. That's my father. That's my dad. I had perfect sinners, total unbelievers, come up and say, "I wish we had the kind of relationship that you have with your dad." It isn't that dad said, "Well, this is the way it is and that's the way it is." And I said, "Yes, father. Yes, father. Yes, father." That wasn't the relationship. I honored him as father. And and and he honored me as son. And we had a wonderful, wonderful relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. I made mistakes, but I was still his son. He made mistakes and he was still my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But whether I made a mistake or he made a mistake, it never changed the level of honor. &gt;&gt; I honored him &gt;&gt; because that was the only dad I ever had and will have on this earth. And I honored him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean if he said, "Now I came into the message." He didn't come into the message. I gave him the church age book. He didn't rejoice in it as I rejoiced in it. That did not change my honor for him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But we walked different paths. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; But we were we there was no animosity between us, wonderful, loving relationship. And I just thought, well, maybe it's not for his age. Maybe maybe God is not going to reveal it to him. God is sovereign in his revelation. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I just dropped that in because to let you know that we're all human here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message leadership and incidentally, listen close as his last message, brother's last message. He said, ' And when a man has been born again by the word of God, not by his emotion or having a, you know, you know, running to the altar and maybe spilling tears on the altar, all of that is fine. But when he's been born again by the word of God, predestinated to eternal life called the elected, it'll be word of God on top of word of God, word on word. Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't be a man's idea or some other doctrine or something else or somebody's else's revelation. It'll be word upon word. Word upon word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how the body is built up. So it's vindicated, proven word coming for you as the word coming upon word. Word upon word. The germ that was in you, he said in the invisible union, the germ that was in you found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The germ that was in you at the beginning found you. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it wasn't me just finding God, but the germ that was in you and in me. &gt;&gt; That germ found us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we still all right for time? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I thought of a lot about this and I saw it a little different because I pondered and had to think about it. You know, Brother Brandham, he speaks in in in different layers. He'll talk about one layer and he'll talk about natural seed. And then he'll talk about what it produces. Then he'll talk about spiritual seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'll talk about what it produces. And he just keeps peeling one layer off of another off another. That's why I said he was talking about the cell in the womb of the mother. And he goes over and over and over. And he said that, you know, it can't be one cell a dog and one cell a cat and one cell a human. So he goes over and over. Now in in this case now he starts talking about the food that you and I eat. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you go down and I've had to you know because I and my wife the age we are and everything we we become more conscious. I never used to pay attention to the labels. I see people reading labels. I thought oh my goodness they're wasting their time. Now I'm studying the labels. How many calories does Oh high in cholesterol. Oh is that right? Oh, this has got sugar in it. This got three teaspoons of sugar. My wife said this morning. What? I don't believe that. Do you know why I didn't believe it? Cuz my taste wanted what he was saying I shouldn't have. So says, "No, if you have it that way, it'll be three teaspoons of sugar. You can only you can only have one." Brother Mike and Sister Debbie, I admire you. you you really I mean you really took a control of this thing and uh and so anyway she says I said well you know now I'd already studied and I had my studies done pretty well but brother Bram talks so much about hybrid food &gt;&gt; and he says I came past a a a field of corn I said beautiful corn he is all hybrid. Said there's no life in it. There's no life in it. &gt;&gt; Little statement. No life in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We just pump ourselves full, but there's no life in it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And that is why, you know, we get sickly and feeling the way because we're eating ourselves to death. &gt;&gt; Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; And then, you know, we could become fanatics and all the rest of that's why we bless the food &gt;&gt; because we haven't got control of all of it. Exactly. &gt;&gt; But then he says he he he he came past a field and it was just original corn &gt;&gt; and he and and uh it didn't look near as nice, &gt;&gt; you know. But then he talked about this hybrid stuff and he says when they try to have it produce again, now notice he doesn't say it can't produce. He said it can't reproduce itself back &gt;&gt; once it's hybrid and you have a hybrid corn from the hybrid corn you can never make original corn again. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; It isn't that you know that it won't that you eat hybrid stuff and you get some strength and live from it. But he said that this is what he said and I'll give you a quote in a few minutes. He said and it was a real revelation to me. He said that the he saw the stuff that they tried to reproduce and it was all dwarf. &gt;&gt; It was dwarfed &gt;&gt; and it wasn't looking good when they were trying to have it produce itself. It was all dwarfed. And I thought, and I put down my notes, you know, Brother Brandham preaches hybrid religion. &gt;&gt; And the people may look fine and nice, &gt;&gt; but inside &gt;&gt; there's a spiritual dwarf, &gt;&gt; all twisted up &gt;&gt; because it cannot produce itself. And he said, "That's why when they fell into denominationalism, they never could reproduce themselves back again. &gt;&gt; They could never come out of it again." &gt;&gt; He said, "We have things today that did not begin in Genesis." &gt;&gt; So we have things today, your supermarket is filled with things today that didn't begin in Genesis. He said, "Because it's been hybrid, &gt;&gt; and anything hybrid is a phony, &gt;&gt; it's no good. It cannot reproduce itself. Anything that's hybrid is man-made and cannot bring itself back again." &gt;&gt; And that is why friends I am I I I I want to conclude this message, but not yet for a few moments. It is absolutely critical. &gt;&gt; We cannot hybrid the message. say, "Well, the message says this, but you know, I think this." &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to inject what you think, I think, somebody else thinks into the message? If if God speaks to you in a certain way and you're to conduct yourself in a certain way, fine. As long as you live godly and live according to the whole council of the word of God. But if if if something comes to you that is directing you in another way outside of the word of God, then I can tell you friends, then it's being injected. It becomes hybrid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; You like to just bear with me a moment because I'm determined to pound this through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And that's the way that people gets away from the word of God." Oh, this is the way people get away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Could he possibly be talking even to believers? I guess so. How can you get away from the word of God if you weren't with the word of God? &gt;&gt; So, he's talking to believers. This is how people get away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; It becomes a hybrid affair. &gt;&gt; So, they don't throw the word of God out. &gt;&gt; They inject something to go with it. It must die. It cannot bring forth of its own kind of life again. The church that will refuse to believe the word of God is a hybrid church with dogmas, creeds, doctrines that's not scriptural. &gt;&gt; They may have he also said that the lie that Satan told Eve in the beginning, do you know what he said about that lie? 99% truth. Say amen to that. &gt;&gt; 99% truth. &gt;&gt; It was the 1% &gt;&gt; that brought Satan's Eden that you and I are living in. &gt;&gt; Think of that 1% because it was injected into the truth. &gt;&gt; 99% truth. We don't want 99% truth. I want to have a word that God came behind and confirmed. And that is why I read I read what brother Brandham I read after and you want to do that or you want to listen afterward where he said if what I've spoken is the truth and in in uh uh uh this days of scripture fulfilled. We've got the if you haven't seen it you need to see brother Charlie Mitchell's uh message. Incidentally his testimony incidentally brothers Charlie Mitchell he was dying. He was given about a month to live and he had a cancer the size tumor the size of a man's fist in his lung and he was just standing at the back and didn't think he'd even get up to the front. Brother Brandham called him out and told him exactly what had happened and that he had was going to have this operation. He has since gone on to be with the Lord. He became a pastor of a church he worked at. And brother Brandham says, "You have," he even stresses that you have been a minor. And that's exactly right. As far as brother Mitchell was concerned, he was a minor. And here the prophet is actually prophesying in that first statement. You have been a minor because he never went back to be a minor. He became a pastor. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; And just a few few days ago, I understand just shortly his son-in-law who took over his church, he has passed away. So they said, "Pray for the church." But in that message, brother Brandham says, "Let the God who gave the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the God who spoke the word, &gt;&gt; if he is God, let him come now. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger I like to hear. &gt;&gt; Let him come now. and and and prove that he's God. &gt;&gt; Just go to your computer, young people, and put in a and prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God proved it. &gt;&gt; Or let him come forward and vindicate it. &gt;&gt; You put those words in, you'll be surprised all through the ministry. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, you say, "Well, that's first pull, second pull." Listen, this this this vindicates a third pull. &gt;&gt; That's what authenticated him. That's what that was his authentication &gt;&gt; that he was the one to come with the word and that is why we believe that word &gt;&gt; not for the signs and the wonders not because Charlie Mitchell was healed but because God [Applause] &gt;&gt; came in behind &gt;&gt; and said you're from this city or you're from that place. Never never lose never lose your appreciation &gt;&gt; and thanksgiving &gt;&gt; that God who didn't have to do it &gt;&gt; listen did it in your season &gt;&gt; and folks if I could come right down to your seat and speak in your ear I would tell you he did it in your season because you would need it in this season and you would need to know you would need to know absolute wrote &gt;&gt; that this came from God because he said, "Who can do that? I can't do that. I'm your brother." Who did she touch? Who did he touch? Why am I saying this over and over and over again? Because God is confirming &gt;&gt; that this is God speaking &gt;&gt; so that we who believe it would know that word is to come. Word upon word upon word. It is the fact that you're being pulled that give proves that you were predestinated from the beginning. If you weren't predestinated from the beginning, that word wouldn't mean anything to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope I can pound that down. And if you come here and hear the word of God and say, "That doesn't mean anything to me." Well, then in all likelihood, there's no seed down there. &gt;&gt; But if you can say, "Something gets a hold of me. Something speaks to me. Maybe you're not as emotional as others. Maybe you're not demonstrative as others. But there's something down inside says, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; I hear I hear Brother Vanom when he's speaking to some of the deepest sinners and and people who are so grossly sick. But he'll just say, "Do you believe that, sister? Do you believe that, brother?" &gt;&gt; And they don't jump up and have a great hallelujah, thunder, and lightning time. They just say, "Yes." And you know what he says? God bless you. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I say to you today, &gt;&gt; you believe that this message come from God? &gt;&gt; I can say God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You have something inside that's saying yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, I receive it. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it, but yes, it is for me. God bless you. &gt;&gt; And there's something there trying to cloud you and keep you back. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; And you deny him. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Satan, I rebuke you. I've been made for this word. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I want you to receive it. That's why I'm preaching. I want you to be better. I want you to be strengthened. &gt;&gt; You tell him he's a liar. Some here that I know need to say that &gt;&gt; right now. You say, "Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're trying to put that question and that doubt on me. You're trying to cloud my life. I resist you." &gt;&gt; Why do you say it? Because the absolute says resist him. &gt;&gt; And it says he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; That's says the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You now it'll take a different meaning for you after hearing me speak this long. You shall know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth shall make you free. And whom the son Luke 17:30 whom the revealed son Revelation 10:1 whom the son that son sets free is free indeed. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's his word. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sing the song, the original life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The original word. &gt;&gt; Oh, it is the original life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message and you might put a note down, condemnation by representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said everything becomes a hybrid. &gt;&gt; But did you know that it's no good? It has no life in it. It cannot reproduce itself again. &gt;&gt; You You can't plant hybrid corn. If you do, you'll just get a little dwarf field because it's been hybrid. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The world is the field. &gt;&gt; And you're going to walk out of this church this morning. You'll find fine people as far as their physique is concerned, as far as their exterior appearance is concerned, you'll find perhaps handsome and fine and lovely young ladies and families and ordinarylooking people. But I have I have had occasion and there's places in the message where brother Brandham begins to speak about the soul of the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he begins to describe it said you you look in the mirror and see yourself the way you are. But he says your soul. How is your soul? I want my soul to be in better shape than my body. &gt;&gt; I want my soul to be strong. &gt;&gt; Your soul to be strong, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said it just brings a a dwarf field because it's been hybrid. He said he gave another place in the same message. He gave the Holy Ghost to the Pentecostals back there on the day of Pentecost. But that's not for us today. He said a hybrid faith condemned by God. Hybrid. No good. Stay away from it. For it's evil. What he's talking about. He wasn't talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost was no good. He was talking about what they did with it. What did the Pentecostals do with it? They denominated. And listen, you know what? You know what the messenger said about the prophet, about his own life? He said, "The prophet comes and then they make a tradition &gt;&gt; out of his life." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We're not here to make a tradition out of Brother Brandham's life. &gt;&gt; We're here to declare that was the highest order that God could send, the highest office that he could send. And I am prepared to say what came out of his mouth &gt;&gt; was truth. Even when my own mind and maybe your own thoughts don't agree 100%. You lay them aside. But what he spoke is the truth. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how you feel, &gt;&gt; you feel so dry. You feel so far away from God. You feel whatever you might feel. But if you will agree and confess his word, one thing is sure. If it's the truth, it will produce a deliverance for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; It will produce it. &gt;&gt; God's word can't lie. The truth shall make you free. &gt;&gt; And we have so many things. We have so many things weighing us down this day. &gt;&gt; So many things &gt;&gt; we need to be set free from. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be just, you know, happy in church. We want to be able to go out of here and find out if this thing works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to be another few minutes. &gt;&gt; Only one service today. &gt;&gt; Listen very very close. Brother Brandham makes a statement sometime we think we understand it. Like I just said about hybrid said it can't reproduce itself back. Some think that well it can't produce anything. No, it produces something but it's dwarfed. &gt;&gt; It's twisted and that hybrid can never come back to the to its original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then he says something else. He said because I'm thinking of the lie in the beginning. This is in my mind and I went back to it over these last days over and over and over. And I know he said that a lie is the truth. The a lie is the truth misrepresented. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not just a lie that has been conjured up and devised. I'll tell him a lie. Satan, he's too smart for that. &gt;&gt; A lie. He takes the truth &gt;&gt; and he just adjusts it &gt;&gt; and then presents that &gt;&gt; because the intent is so that you will believe a lie. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care how you get the lie. He doesn't care what you believe as long as you don't believe the truth. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You want to really think that one over? It's the truth misrepresented. &gt;&gt; So it's the truth that's presented, but it's misrepresented. It's just tainted a wee bit. &gt;&gt; And the intent of tainting it, the intent of just injecting something in it is to get you to believe a lie. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't care. You might believe one lie. I might believe a different lie. Someone else believes a different lie. But it all came from the same source. &gt;&gt; And the source was the truth. 99% truth was just an something injected so that it could be misrepresented. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Misrepresented is this. Is everyone listening? &gt;&gt; To give an inaccurate something inaccurate, it's not accurate. &gt;&gt; But it's being presented to you so that they don't care or he doesn't care what you believe &gt;&gt; as long as you don't believe the truth. 99% truth. The prophet said, you know, just just listen real close, friends. 99% truth &gt;&gt; isn't good enough, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because it's the 1% that brought on Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; It's the 1% that will keep a person still bound. It's the 1% that will allow your life to be clouded &gt;&gt; and to twist you all up. We cannot allow 1%. &gt;&gt; Say, "How do we know?" Then then this gets very serious, Brother Ed. That's exactly right. And that is why I poured over this service, poured over this message. How can I know, Brother Ed, if you and I were sitting across the table from one another, you'd say, "How can I know?" I'd say the only way that I can know and the only thing that I can do for I, my wife, my home is what did God confirm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did God come by? I I'm not interested how loud a man preached. I'm not I'm not interested in how much he thumped or ran back and forth in the congregation. I want to know, did God come in behind it and confirm this is me speaking? This isn't this man William Brham. This is me speaking. And that is why I hang on to that word so close, &gt;&gt; so tight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when winds would blow and to move us off course, you hang. This is my counsel to you. If it was my last service, hang all the closer to what God confirmed. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hold to it with all your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hang right on to it. I can tell one thing that is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you weary? &gt;&gt; Give me another moment. &gt;&gt; Why do you think brother Bradam said to these people hundreds of times, is that the truth? Is that the truth about simple things? We don't know each other. Is that the truth? You have a you have a a you have something wrong with your throat. Is that the truth? And often God would direct him in such a way so that it would actually encourage some who wanted to doubt to doubt. Wanted to criticize to criticize. It actually opened the door for the critics. That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my husband. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And then he'd say, "So that you might know that this is the truth. &gt;&gt; I see you coming, &gt;&gt; driving in a car &gt;&gt; and you're not from here. You're from Ohio and you're from a town called this or something else." We're not caught up. We're not trying to duplicate that. That is the proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because then we don't belittle that because that was God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was the creator. &gt;&gt; That was the one who even brought this whole earth into existence. &gt;&gt; That was the one who could create squirrels. &gt;&gt; That was the one who could create fish &gt;&gt; in Peter's time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cast your net on this side. &gt;&gt; He knew how to catch a whole lot of fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying amen myself cuz I believe it &gt;&gt; with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; And then when you know he said it, &gt;&gt; hang on to that. &gt;&gt; You might say this is a simple message, brother Bis. Why are you saying it? You know why I'm saying it? Because this congregation needs it. &gt;&gt; If you know the prophet of God said it, then you hang on to it. It's not what somebody said that he said, it's what he said that he said. and let God's word come to God's word, word upon word upon word to build you an eternal home that you can go to. Do you realize &gt;&gt; he said that God will call some preacher behind the pullpit &gt;&gt; to preach the message &gt;&gt; because your body, &gt;&gt; your body, your eternal hope is calling for it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very thing that you're hearing today is a result of somebody's eternal hope. &gt;&gt; You might even be sitting here not realizing, but your theophony is calling for this message. And your theophony is saying, "Stay with the word. Stay with the word." &gt;&gt; That's what your theophony is saying. Stay with it. Cuz that's what he's made up of. That's the real you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's a million ways. There's a million ways to become injured or to become crippled or to become blind or million ways to become afflicted &gt;&gt; spiritually, mentally. &gt;&gt; Million ways to become oppressed and depressed. &gt;&gt; It's a million things for you to worry about and be concerned about &gt;&gt; in this life. &gt;&gt; A million things. A million ways. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one way for you to be free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom the son. &gt;&gt; Not whom the history &gt;&gt; and not whom what we think of him in the future, but whom the son, the revealed son of God, &gt;&gt; whom the son sets free, &gt;&gt; whom this word sets free, &gt;&gt; shall be free indeed. &gt;&gt; This this truth hung on Calvary. This truth crushed your enemy's head. &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to you today that Satan, that serpent, the old devil, has been defeated and rendered helpless by this truth. By this one, truth hung on Calvary. It was truth that defeated Satan. And if truth defeated him back there, it's truth that'll defeat him right here. I want you to be able to say, Satan, &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm a product of the truth. &gt;&gt; I am in the truth for Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you cannot be a participant of truth. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. Think of it for a moment. When he the truth came, &gt;&gt; he said he's full of grace and full of truth. &gt;&gt; It was truth that came. Why? He had to undo &gt;&gt; the lie. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, &gt;&gt; he came to undo the lie. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, &gt;&gt; he came out of the bosom of the father. Truth proceeded &gt;&gt; from God. Jesus didn't need it. You needed it. &gt;&gt; You and I need it. &gt;&gt; This generation needs it. &gt;&gt; Don't be Don't be distracted. Don't be derailed. This is a message for this hour and for this season. &gt;&gt; And as I said, if this would be my last message, I would say to you, &gt;&gt; you hang tight. We tighten up closer and closer and closer to that word. You see people straying or going off on their own way or going off on their own die on their own desires. You stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; And by that I'm not saying and don't be mis don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying you stay with me. You stay with the message &gt;&gt; of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise wonderful name of God &gt;&gt; I do not believe in being moved &gt;&gt; because of my loved ones &gt;&gt; or my family &gt;&gt; or my children &gt;&gt; I said in the log church if my children refuse to you you believe this message and want to follow it anymore I said there's the doors &gt;&gt; I still feel that way &gt;&gt; when I came into this message friend there was none of my family in this message. &gt;&gt; None of it. In fact, they all forsook. &gt;&gt; They all stayed away. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. &gt;&gt; That's the message that I believe. &gt;&gt; Not hard, not harsh, not for a moment. Loving, caring. But the only the only solution the only solution for friends, family or whoever is to make sure number one that you and I &gt;&gt; are fixed &gt;&gt; fixed unmovable &gt;&gt; upon that word &gt;&gt; and if you don't have a full revelation say God reveal to me &gt;&gt; that's why this messenger says to us says to all of us we'll never be able to know what how important revelation is to us. &gt;&gt; Revelation is life. &gt;&gt; If you are argued into something or convinced into something that won't do any good because it'll con somebody can convince you out of it. But when when you have a revelation &gt;&gt; that is you [Applause] [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just want to see if there's anything I should be saying before I close. &gt;&gt; Maybe not everybody had asked or asks about the truth, wants to receive the truth. Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I'm a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear? Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that an intelligent man as Pilate needed anything further? &gt;&gt; Why would anybody need anything more? Are you a king? This is why I came into the world. I came into the world to bear witness of the truth. &gt;&gt; And everyone who is of the truth, of the truth, will hear my voice. &gt;&gt; And Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews and said unto them, I find no fault at all. Actually, he went out there and and and sentenced himself. &gt;&gt; He condemned himself. &gt;&gt; He went back out to the Jews after that kind of a statement. Isn't it amazing that students of the word, students of the scripture managed to get enough said against him. They didn't tell lies about him. They just misrepresented what he said. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "Destroy this temple. In three days, I'll raise it up." &gt;&gt; Why didn't they go back to him and say, "What did you mean?" &gt;&gt; Do you know why? They didn't want to know what he meant. &gt;&gt; Think about it. They didn't want to know what he meant. They wanted to take what he said and just misrepresent it. &gt;&gt; And so they said he said that he'll destroy this temple and raise it up again. &gt;&gt; And the manner in which they said it caused the people to disbelieve Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it wasn't lies that really sent him to the cross. It was exactly what Satan did in Eden. He simply misrepresented what had been said. And that's why he said, "Hath God said?" &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; That's the same. Why should I preach this? Because that's what he always does. Amen. &gt;&gt; Had a young man in Idaho right near where you're going, Brother Adam, just a few miles, Nampa, Meridian. And brother Adam was real shocked to find out Boisey was the first city that I spoke in. We started doing evangelistic work in the states. Boisey, the whole Boisee Valley and Nampa and Meridian and and Brother Roberts died in his 90s. Still a Pentecostal preacher down there. But all Satan didn't come and just say a bunch of lies about Christ. He he he was willing for 99% truth, but he just wanted to cause he wanted it either said in such a way or he wanted it presented in such a manner so that the hearer didn't care if you believed one thing and they believe another and this one believes and I believe another. Doesn't matter what you believe. Just so long as you don't believe the truth. &gt;&gt; And so it can be 99. And if you hear anything even in this day, you have a right to say where did that come from? &gt;&gt; What is the source? What is the source? &gt;&gt; I want to go first and find out if that's the truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you know what really hurts? If it's not the truth, you say, "You told me something that wasn't the truth. &gt;&gt; Do you think you think that a person's ready to repent?" No. They weren't ready to repent when they found out the truth. &gt;&gt; They weren't ready to repent. &gt;&gt; Judas, he wanted or he attempted to repent. He wasn't able to. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, don't forget, now this isn't what I said. You look and say, "That's exactly what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; not once, but over and over. It's the truth misrepresented." &gt;&gt; Satan comes to an individual. Now, you just hear a little voice and saying, "Well, you know, uh I'll talk about young people. We're not on your case now, but sometime people." Oh, and there was this one young boy I was going to tell about. He was about 16 and he would sit in the back in the meetings and and God was dealing with people and young people, teenagers were giving their life to Christ and surrendering themselves to Christ. And then they decided to go to a place they called it the place of the cross. And they would go up there and then pray. They just had like a special time out in the wilderness much like the camp. And they were all praying and all these young people were just wanting to give themselves to Christ, whatever Christ wanted. And I saw this young man. He was a minister's son. He was this minister had just died. It was his son. And his name was Benny. And I went and I just put my arm around him and I said, "Benny, don't you want to, you know, don't you want to surrender your life to Christ?" I see he was in a big struggle and he just exploded. He said, "They all want me to be a preacher. They tell me I'm going to be a preacher. I don't want to be a preacher. I don't want to be a preacher. I want to be a ball player. I want to play second baseman." I said, "Well, that's okay." What? Here's a preacher. Here's the guest speaker saying, "That's all right. You want to be a ball player? Great. If you want to be a ball player, I think he's the one that took over his dad's church. You know, the thing is the the devil, he doesn't care how he does it. &gt;&gt; But he just keep, you know, he'll just keep telling. And you know what he tells you? Well, you're going to if you if you surrender your life to Christ, you can't do that. You can't be that. You're going to be this. They're going to make you this. They're going to make you that. That's not the truth. God's not going to force you to be anything. &gt;&gt; He just wants you to be surrendered to him. &gt;&gt; And then the truth does the work. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; The absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't forget, &gt;&gt; brother Biscll, you think I I preached this for you? I have a wife sitting here. I have a family sitting here and probably Tom and Joanne streaming. I had the man I most respect that led me into the ministry and opened the doors for the ministry for me and I had him make a long trip from Portland, Oregon and sat in the front room of my house and the rest of the family. My wife felt like I guess she should stay in the kitchen. And this brother wanted to speak to me and he sat right beside me and let me know in no uncertain terms I am here to to get you out of this to get you out of this doctrine. He's very kind as far as a life. He just lived in the word and lived in prayer. He was like a daddy to me. His name was Chad. Some of you old-timers know him. I said, "Chad," I said, "I have surrendered the life of my wife, her soul, the souls of my three children. I've surrendered them to this message and my own soul and nothing can ever change that. That was the last time that subject was ever discussed. You know what they said? His wife said, "Weeping over my wife's shoulder, you're the only children we have." He said on another occasion, "You got the best church." He said, "I've traveled all over through California and all." He said, "You got the best church." Said that. And yet he would say, "I've come to get you out of this." But you know, when all was said and done, you know what? They requested that I take his funeral. And that wasn't because I was an enemy. I was still a friend, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I took his funeral. &gt;&gt; And I felt it it was a great honor to take and speak to his family and tell them what we believe. Friends, I'm here today because of my own soul. &gt;&gt; And far be it from me to try to tell you something that I don't believe &gt;&gt; and that I wouldn't do. My friends, beloved friends and brothers and sisters in Christ, I've hung my soul onto this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why maybe I don't say a lot of things and I won't allow my ears to be garbage cans for all kinds of rumors and stuff and trash. And I say to you the same advice. Don't do it. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. &gt;&gt; Just say I'm not here. We can be friends and do what I do. Just say as you as I said to brother Chad, the dearest of friends, I have surrendered my whole life, my whole soul in this message. And nothing can change that. &gt;&gt; I am thoroughly convinced. I am thoroughly persuaded. &gt;&gt; And nothing can change that. &gt;&gt; And it'll be over. &gt;&gt; It'll be over. I'll fellowship with you, but I'm not here because friends, whatever you get, and I'm closing now, whatever you get, you need to get it from the message. &gt;&gt; And that will guide your feet, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a bunch of the stuff and a lot of the things that you can hear and if you were come to me and say, "Is this right?" I I may be able to say that's even 99% right. But what was the purpose it was told to you? &gt;&gt; Was it told to you to make you more stable? Was it told to you so that you would be edified in your spiritual life? Is that the purpose? What is the purpose? like a brother standing up and saying and I've seen it several times and I've had people of the church of their church come to me and say he'd say this is the absolute they say what and they bring it to me would you say that this is the absolute I say absolutely that's the absolute that is the truth &gt;&gt; but then why is he saying it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; if I were saying to you this is God's absolute then you'd have a right to say that's exactly the truth But why is he saying it? Is he saying it because he has something else to slip in? Has he got something else to, you know, to convince us about? Is he trying to bring something else to us? That is exactly friends, my counsel, my my conviction, my experience to you. And it will keep it will keep you've got to have we got to have some guidelines. And that's absolutely the truth. And I close by saying, but the message that was sent is the season of the word in this hour, in this season, and it will reveal Jesus Christ. And furthermore, it will it will produce Jesus Christ in the individual. &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't, then it's not the word. &gt;&gt; If the message of the prophet does not produce the life of Jesus Christ, then it's not the word. If some perverted word is bringing out a excuse me, making a dwarf &gt;&gt; believer. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want to be anything but that. &gt;&gt; Wonder if we have musicians come. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a very some very popular thoughts today and I've heard it and I'm sure you've heard it. I just want to be true to myself. Whatever that means. I want to be true to myself. Brother Brandham was in one place and he was and and I'm just closing now with this, but he said and this was in Los Angeles, California. And he said, 'I'm very happy to be back in California again tonight with you people again. God bless you. I appreciate that. He said, 'I had quite a struggle coming this time. Please notice he, God's messenger, had a struggle. He said the struggle was not to come back to you, he said, but under the circumstances. And the circumstances was there was a great evangelist that was in the city having meetings. And here was here was brother Brandham with with uh the ministry that he had coming right to the city to a group of people right while this other minister was having meetings. So he had that struggle had a big struggle. You know what he says? He said but I felt I needed to keep my promise. He wanted to be true to his promise. And actually, when I started this message, I didn't even dream I was going where we went this morning. I thought about people I wanted to live true to my promise. And I thought of us living true to the word and our our conversion. Our How many groups and denominations were you through, Brother Ernie? &gt;&gt; Eight. &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; Eight. &gt;&gt; Eight. You You see how zealous Brother Ernie was is? And I'm sure that you were equally as zealous in all of them. Give yourself to it. You're just as positive in all of them. &gt;&gt; I'm sure of that. If I thought for a moment, If I thought for a moment that there was a possibility that I would have reason to leave the message or to forsake it, do you know what I'd do? I'd do it immediately. I wouldn't be a hypocrite. I wouldn't stay any longer. Say, "Okay, what have you pinned? What have you anchored your your faith to? What have you anchored, Brother Ed? Your soul. Your soul, young men. Your soul, brothers and sisters. What have we anchored our soul to? Well, I say, well, I've anchored my soul to the word of God. I'm not being philosophical now, but what is the word of God? You can read all kinds of chapters in the Old Testament. You can't see that. You can't produce that. What is the word of God? Said, "Well, it's not being sincere. The people up the street in the Baptist church, the people over here in the free Methodist, I can tell you they're every bit as sincere as you and I." Right? &gt;&gt; This is not sincerity. So, what is the word of God? Well, I wept and I repented. They did, too. Well, I've seen I God has spoken to me. God spoke to them, too. At least as much as you and I say. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what really separates us? Well, this is a big step. We have a prophet. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's a big step. Okay. Well, the Mormons just building a new temple up here, they could say, "We've got a prophet, too." &gt;&gt; And the all the all the Muslims could say, "We have a prophet." &gt;&gt; And how many people do you have? Our prophet has got 1.3 billion people that believe him. Well, we believe our prophet's coming back. They say, "We believe ours is, too." Well, our prophet, we got a whole bunch of messages. We got,00 messages. The Mormons would say, "Well, we got a book as well." Then all you'd find out is you got something to say. They got something to say. But here's something you can say. &gt;&gt; That they cannot say. &gt;&gt; No Catholic can say it because no pope ever did it. No Mormon could say it because none of their apostles or bishops or prophets ever said it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is we have a prophet that stood up. Now this is the dividing line. Stood up in front of multitudes of people and said if God &gt;&gt; doesn't come now &gt;&gt; and prove that what I've said is the truth then don't believe me. &gt;&gt; That my friends is the dividing line. That my friends is what separates you and I from all the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; That one thing. And that's why I say thank God &gt;&gt; that you came on the scene and prove who was speaking. &gt;&gt; You proved it &gt;&gt; and thus our faith is anchored in what God proved. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your keen attention. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a song here I want to sing. Just wait till I find it. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can sing 616, Brother Ryan. Faith of Our Fathers Living Still. &gt;&gt; Pound that piano and make an anthem out of this. And let's all stand. Let's sing it with the depths of our heart. Faith of our father living still in spite of judge and fire and sword. Oh, our hearts be high with joy when we hear that glorious word.

And may God grant that to you. That's my prayer. Brother John, I would ask if you'll ask God's blessing upon the people. Would you please? Heavenly Father, thank you for speaking to us this morning. God, we believe it was the same spirit that was in Jesus speaking to his disciples was speaking this morning to our lives. We believe it was the same spirit of truth that spoke through a prophet, the seventh angel, and that stood behind the pulpit for years and years, and you came behind and you vindicated it. We believe that same spirit was in this meeting this morning, God. And Lord, we're not afraid to agree and we're not afraid to pray. also if it was the spirit of truth that you would come behind it and vindicate it within our lives. &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands, Lord. I lift up my heart, God. We weren't alive 40, 50 years ago. That wasn't our season, but we are alive today. &gt;&gt; And we're asking that your word for this season would be manifested within our lives. We're not asking for a doctrine, a book, some quotes. We're not asking for a church building, or for sermons. We're asking for your word and the spirit of truth that brought it to now live it through our lives. &gt;&gt; We're not asking you to vindicate us. We're asking you to vindicate your word. And we've heard your word. &gt;&gt; We believe your word, &gt;&gt; Lord. We agree with the word. But now we're asking you and we're releasing to you and our faith that you would come behind your word and do the dynamics within our lives. Even at the close of this service, we believe that your word is true and you sent it out into the darkness and the void in Genesis 1 and now it's at the end time and you've sent forth your word, a mighty voice. It has power to put missing limbs back into a body. It has power to dissolve cancers and to dissolve things within it. The bodies that are within this service streaming on the internet. We believe if someone has not been born again that there is power in the word that we heard today. The power of the incorruptible word of God that a life could be totally set free &gt;&gt; by the hearing of what we heard today. God, we believe it on the same level. We believe it on the same level, God, as when you spoke it in John, as you spoke it 40 years ago, 50 years ago, you were in this service today. And Lord, we've been listening to the sound of your messages to our hearts over the years. &gt;&gt; And it is the same &gt;&gt; from a little boy myself being raised in the Bratam tabernacle under a prophet's message. What I heard today was the same voice. It's the word. It's the voice of the spirit speaking to our lives. And Lord, we're asking you once more to come behind it and vindicate it within our lives, within our children, within our sisters, our brothers, within this congregation, within the visitors that are here, within those that are on the internet. Lord, do a miracle within our lives. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; what our theophanes are crying for, you have spoken it, God. There's not a question in our minds that this is the absolute truth. That is why we're here. That is why we listen. That is why we obey, God. And our hands are lifted up. Our hearts are open, God. This is that which was spoken by a prophet's message that there would be a people that would receive thus, sayeth the Lord, and would go out and live this word. Then Lord in humility and in simplicity we say Lord be it unto us according to your word God. Be it unto us according to what we've heard God that we are living in a bride channel that we can get into. And it's not us speaking no more. It's not us living no more. It's you living with us. &gt;&gt; And we are your body God. And we are your people. May there come such a vindication individually to our hearts, God, as we go from this place today that there would be something that would stick with us &gt;&gt; as your word will not return it to you void. It has a life of its own. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you continue to go to our homes, in our vehicles. Let it be our conversation as the Holy Spirit feeds on the word, God. Let it become more real. Let it become more evident. and let it become more in reality. Jesus, &gt;&gt; we're not asking for emotion. We're not asking for a just a shouting happy time. We're asking for the truth that will set us free into a new body, into another dimension where our theophanes can come. Now, as we go this afternoon and as we even leave this place and something can just echo in our hearts, it is nothing but the truth. Stay with the word. Stay with the message. Stay in line and help us at this end time as your bride and as your people to stay in line. &gt;&gt; Lord, go with us now. Father, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit that spoke it now would get inside of us. &gt;&gt; We don't want to ignore it. We don't want to miss your presence, God. Is it that just brings forth a cooling off and a lethargy and a formalism? But let us stick a hold of every word of God that it that fire in our bones and the passion of this life could be very evident in our lives. We pray that others would say they've been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Go with us now and every need continue to manifest and prove your word, God, among us. And we'll be looking for that, Lord Jesus. We're going to be sensitive more and more to that manifestation. Let these words, God, not fall on empty hearts, but on good ground that it would change our lives, God. &gt;&gt; Go with us now. Continue to unfold your plan in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's been a good day. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We we dismiss you in the name precious name of Jesus and have a wonderful day. What's the rest of it and this week and see you Lord willing on Wednesday if not before. Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
