[0:06] [Music]
[0:25] You love the Lord. This morning,
[0:29] Ann and I were talking uh this morning
[0:32] about a school teacher she had and uh
[0:36] you know, he said, "You should be able
[0:38] to sing like no one's like no one's
[0:40] watching. You should work like you don't
[0:42] need the money, right? I want you to
[0:45] stand this morning and I want you to
[0:48] sing. I want you to praise the Lord."
[0:50] You say, "Well, Brother Rod, somebody's
[0:52] standing beside me, you know." Oh, well,
[0:54] close your eyes.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I had a I had a big win this
[0:58] week. I've been fighting a court case
[1:02] for my boss ever since I started with
[1:05] the firm. And this week, I won. I won.
[1:10] Now, I can tell you, I didn't see, you
[1:12] know, when I got this phone call from
[1:14] the lawyer and said, "Hey," they just
[1:15] caved. I didn't say, "That is very
[1:18] nice." I was sitting by myself in my
[1:22] office and I went, "All right."
[1:26] Right? Now, it's not even my money,
[1:30] right? I'm just happy.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; But I mean, now think of what you have
[1:36] &gt;&gt; in the Holy Ghost this morning.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have any sin,
[1:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41] [Applause]
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Then it's gone.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We should be able. And if
[1:47] you say, "Well, brother, I don't feel
[1:48] like," you know, I tell you, I feel like
[1:50] praising him.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this song's for brother Tony
[1:53] this morning. Amen.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; You sing it with me.
[2:01] [Music]
[2:04] When I wake up in the morning and think
[2:09] of the great things
[2:11] [Music]
[2:13] God has done for me
[2:19] in my heart there's such rejoicing
[2:24] to think that new day
[2:29] has gone on
[2:35] All the glorious mysteries in God's word
[2:40] he has
[2:43] [Music]
[2:44] allowed me to share.

[4:18] wise and the proof he has
[4:23] revealed unto his own.
[4:30] It's a message of preparation
[4:34] [Music]
[4:35] to take us
[4:38] to our eternal home.

[5:42] heavenly derid

[7:24] door for me.

[12:08] from his memory.
[12:13] By the blood of the lamb
[12:18] of Calary.

[14:24] [Music]
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for the work that

[14:42] time of grief and difficulty and uh
[14:46] thanks also to all who helped in other
[14:49] ways such we appreciate all of you. Our

[15:00] breakdown and needs a new birth.

[15:04] Brother John King is requesting prayer
[15:06] for Preston this morning. Uh he woke
[15:09] with 102° temperature this morning and
[15:12] just desiring that God would touch him
[15:14] and heal him. I'm going to ask our
[15:15] brother John Andy's, brother John, if
[15:17] you'd come and open the service in a
[15:18] word of prayer. How many others have a
[15:20] need this morning? They want to be
[15:21] remembered before the Lord. And if
[15:24] you're listening in on the internet this
[15:25] morning, you've got a need, you just uh
[15:27] take it before the Lord as we go to
[15:29] prayer with John.
[15:34] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[15:37] Lord, if we can worship you in a free
[15:39] spirit, surely we ought to be able to
[15:41] open up our mouths and pray to you in a
[15:44] free spirit, Lord. Like no one else is
[15:47] in the room, like it's just you and us
[15:49] alone. Lord, we've come here to worship
[15:52] you today.
[15:54] Lord, we're stepping outside of our own
[15:56] feelings, outside of our own situations,
[15:59] outside of whether we're male or female,
[16:02] bond or free, whatever skin color we
[16:05] have, whatever family strains we have,
[16:08] whatever national spirit we're from.
[16:11] Lord, we are one family. We are one
[16:13] body. We are one people. Lord, we want
[16:18] our voices to come into your presence
[16:20] this morning. We want to walk with you
[16:23] this morning,
[16:25] oh Jesus. Hallelujah.
[16:28] Hallelujah.
[16:30] Blessed be your holy name. We lift up
[16:33] our hands. We lift up our hearts. We
[16:37] lift up our voices.
[16:40] King of kings, Lord of Lords.
[16:43] Oh Jesus, you're worthy of our praise.
[16:46] You're worthy of our adoration.
[16:48] You're worthy, worthy, worthy. We thank
[16:52] you, Lord Jesus. Our hearts are
[16:54] overflowing with gratefulness, Father.
[16:59] Hearts are overflowing with your grace.
[17:02] Our hearts are overflowing with your
[17:04] mercy. Hearts are overflowing with lives
[17:07] that have been healed. Lives that have
[17:10] been touched. Lives that have been
[17:11] delivered. Lives that were bound that
[17:14] have been set free. What else can we do
[17:17] but cry holy, holy, holy, holy. Thank
[17:21] you, Jesus.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we love you this morning. We
[17:27] thank you for the testimonies,
[17:29] Lord. When your presence comes, when you
[17:32] come,
[17:33] &gt;&gt; the tempter's power is broken.
[17:36] [Music]
[17:37] When those virtues, Lord, coming from
[17:39] your back begin to come into a life,
[17:43] sickness has to leave. Cancer has to
[17:46] leave. Things that are wrong begin to be
[17:49] made right. Just in a moment, a light is
[17:52] turned on in a situation. We believe
[17:55] that sen has come in this hour. As we
[17:59] sang the opening song, Melzdc has come.
[18:02] Told us things that were, things that
[18:04] are, things that are to be. That is why
[18:07] we can rejoice. That is why in this
[18:10] season, our hearts are full of your
[18:12] presence and your spirit is
[18:15] &gt;&gt; bringing new creations. It's bursting
[18:17] out like a Roman candle. Lord Jesus,
[18:22] we're so thankful we can gather around
[18:23] the table. Gather around the presence of
[18:26] God like this in freedom, Lord. in
[18:29] worship and thanksgiving, God in a
[18:32] liberty and a spirit, Lord, with
[18:34] brothers and sisters that have made
[18:36] heaven their goal, that have made that
[18:39] eternal body part of their inheritance.
[18:42] We're so thankful there's men and women
[18:43] that's given up houses and lands and
[18:48] said no to the things of this world that
[18:50] we can come together like this our
[18:52] little licks of fire like they had in
[18:54] the upper room like your prophet spoke
[18:57] about a people and begin to recognize
[19:00] who they are that they would rise up a
[19:02] mighty army. God, we're standing at
[19:04] attention this morning. the great
[19:06] general has brought us together for this
[19:09] kind of a gathering, for this type of a
[19:11] meeting. And God, we believe in
[19:13] miracles. We believe that you're
[19:15] changing lives. We believe that you're
[19:17] healing sick. Lord, we believe that
[19:20] you're able to deliver and fill us with
[19:22] your spirit again and again and again
[19:26] and again. Father, may this meeting this
[19:30] morning, this afternoon be hallowed to
[19:32] you, God, as you come down and suck with
[19:35] us and walk with us. Let there be
[19:38] communion at the table, stimulation
[19:41] flowing, that when we hear truth, Lord,
[19:44] that we can get so under the impact of
[19:46] it, it can possess us. Lord, we be
[19:49] caught away into those heavenly places.
[19:52] Lord, there's needs among us. You
[19:54] brought our sister Judy back. You've
[19:56] touched our sister snow. For this, we're
[19:58] grateful. There's others that are here,
[20:00] God, even through the days as we receive
[20:03] the calls and there's miracles happening
[20:06] one right after the other. We give you
[20:08] glory for that, Lord. And mercies are
[20:11] new every morning. We're here to tap
[20:14] into some mercies, God. We're here to
[20:16] tap into some healings. We're here to
[20:18] tap into your presence, taking out the
[20:20] starch and taking out the us. That Jesus
[20:24] would step inside of this room. this
[20:26] morning. Jesus would flow through our
[20:28] lives. That Jesus would get a hold of
[20:30] us.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; We just love you, God.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Our sister's relative needs a a new
[20:44] birth. Lord, she's going through this
[20:46] situation. Pray that you'd come on the
[20:49] scene in her life
[20:51] as you did for so many. you're able to
[20:53] do again and again. Unspoken requests,
[20:56] those that are written in, those that
[20:58] are standing, some have their hands
[21:00] lifted up. Some are putting their hands
[21:02] over on the telephone or in the
[21:04] computer. Lord, they're connected with
[21:06] us. God, we just believe at any moment
[21:09] we could step into that other body, that
[21:11] other dimensions blending in so closely
[21:14] when our pastor steps behind the sacred
[21:16] desk. May the pillar of fire be so
[21:19] present that our names would be spoken.
[21:22] You know our needs. You are know our
[21:24] names, our addresses. Let us begin this
[21:27] service under the realization that you
[21:31] know all things. And the one that's
[21:34] speaking to us, the one that's breaking
[21:36] the bread, the one that's opening our
[21:39] hearts is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:42] Nothing's hidden this morning. Nothing's
[21:45] covered. We just want you to have your
[21:47] way and be pleased. There's been an
[21:50] expectation about this day, Lord. I
[21:52] don't know why in our own hearts, but we
[21:54] we're looking forward to this day, God.
[21:57] Something's going to happen today. We've
[21:59] just sensed it in the our expectation,
[22:02] Lord. There's going to be a move of God
[22:03] here. There's going to be divine things
[22:06] happen during the services today. Our
[22:09] pastor and brother Tom this afternoon,
[22:11] something divine is happening. God,
[22:14] we're taking another step, Lord. We're
[22:16] moving into a higher realm. We're
[22:18] believing for the impossible. May Satan
[22:21] be defeated. May the works of darkness
[22:24] be crushed. Let the King of glory come
[22:27] riding in and wave upon wave upon wave
[22:30] of your glory, oh God. That you would be
[22:33] glorified among us. That you would be
[22:36] pleased that we would stand back, Lord,
[22:38] and be under the impact of the presence
[22:41] of Jesus Christ. We give you your
[22:43] rightful place, first place today in
[22:47] Jesus name.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[22:56] [Music]
[22:58] Our sister Elizabeth Neighbor is going
[22:59] to come and bless us with a song. Sister
[23:01] Elizabeth, if you'd come at this time. U
[23:04] we've got an announcement and then
[23:06] Brother Tom's going to come with
[23:07] announcement just before Sister
[23:08] Elizabeth sings. Uh the young people's
[23:11] meeting this Friday. Uh remember Friday
[23:14] night 7:30
[23:16] um here at the church December 9th uh

[23:20] speaking and I know uh and let's be
[23:23] praying for it. I know um everyone's
[23:25] going to be really looking forward to
[23:26] what brother Wes has to said to say.
[23:29] Amen. Brother Tom,
[23:35] well I guess for the young people this
[23:36] is announcement for them. It's official.
[23:39] Lord willing, if we're still here, we're
[23:42] going to have a winter camp and that
[23:45] will be on February the 17th, 18th, and
[23:48] 19th, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And
[23:52] uh God's done some great things for us
[23:54] to make this uh available at this time.
[23:57] And you know, we've been wanting over
[23:59] the years to have a a winter camp just
[24:01] to continue what the Lord's doing at the
[24:03] summer camp. and it just hasn't never
[24:05] fit in, never worked, never really
[24:07] opened up to us until this year. And um
[24:11] we've uh uh the church now has a couple
[24:14] of old buses that we're using, one for
[24:16] the school and and that's going to be
[24:18] available. So we'll be able to transport
[24:20] about 100 children up to the camp. So we
[24:22] don't have 100 families taking the young
[24:24] people up. So um we'll be getting
[24:26] together with some of the people that
[24:28] we'll be uh needing to make this camp
[24:31] possible. And so be praying that God
[24:35] will just continue, as brother John is
[24:37] saying, wave after wave of his presence.
[24:40] And it's tremendous uh time for us and
[24:43] I'm looking forward to it. So God bless
[24:45] you. It's February 17th, 18th, and 19th.
[24:54] [Music]
[25:22] All I've heard about heaven
[25:25] [Music]
[25:29] makes me want to go.
[25:36] The more ties that I have there, friends
[25:40] and love ones who've gone on makes it
[25:45] harder
[25:46] to be
[25:48] [Music]
[25:52] in a world that's just passing by.
[25:57] [Music]
[25:59] With all its troules
[26:02] and cares
[26:04] that here seems so great
[26:07] when compared
[26:09] to my future home.
[26:14] There's nothing here holding me.
[26:22] I'm getting lonely
[26:24] for home.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so lonely for home.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; My eyes are aching to see
[26:34] &gt;&gt; the glory that awakes me.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; My bridegroom
[26:39] is here.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is here.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; And I know he longs too.
[26:49] Yes, he is longing
[26:52] for that fellowship
[26:55] we
[26:56] had
[26:58] before.
[27:00] When morning stars
[27:04] shouted for joy,
[27:07] I'm being called back.
[27:12] [Music]
[27:15] I'm going home.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:40] [Music]
[27:50] When a saint passes on,
[27:57] how it saddens our hearts
[28:04] for We still here.
[28:08] Feel the pain. Know the loss
[28:12] of one we have lost.
[28:19] But now imagine
[28:22] heaven.
[28:25] All the shouts of rejoicing
[28:29] that one has come home.
[28:34] It was one short breath, one small step
[28:40] that took
[28:43] them there.
[28:49] There's nothing on earth can be put to
[28:54] the test.
[28:56] No pleasure these mortal lives know
[29:03] to outweigh the bliss and the freom of
[29:08] soul
[29:10] that we the redeemed will soon know.
[29:18] Getting lonely for home. I'm so lonely
[29:23] for home. My eyes are aching to see
[29:29] the glory that awaits me. My bridegroom
[29:34] me is here. I feel him here. And I know
[29:40] he longs too. Yes, he is longing
[29:46] for that fellowship we had
[29:52] before.
[29:53] When morning stars
[29:57] shouted for joy,
[30:00] I'm being called back.
[30:03] [Music]
[30:08] I'm going home
[30:14] for that fellowship
[30:17] we had
[30:20] before.
[30:22] And morning stars
[30:25] we all shouted for joy.
[30:29] I'm being called back.
[30:33] [Music]
[30:37] I'm going
[30:40] home.
[30:48] [Music]
[30:55] Amen. Thanks, sisters.
[31:00] You headed for home.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[31:05] Let's uh we're going to be turning to
[31:07] the word now as brother Biscll's coming.
[31:09] He knows my name.
[31:11] John Andy's while he was praying that he
[31:13] knows your name. He knows your address.
[31:15] you know, and you might not think, well,
[31:18] you know, of course he's gone, but you
[31:20] know, if you're if you're walking down
[31:22] the street, you know, and and uh you
[31:25] know, somebody important went by, you
[31:27] know, and say it was the president of
[31:29] the United States
[31:31] and he looked over and he said said,
[31:34] "Hey, there's Randy Snow." Says, "I know
[31:36] him." And he calls you, you know, "Hey,
[31:39] Randy, come over here. I want to talk to
[31:40] you." You know, I know Randy would go,
[31:42] "Hey, I'm president." You know, me and
[31:45] him are friends. You know, he knows me.
[31:47] Or if the prime minister said, "Aaron
[31:49] Hardy, how are you doing?" He says, "You
[31:52] you know my name." You know, God knows
[31:55] everything about you. Man, he loves you.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He came and walked this earth and
[32:01] died for you, man. That you could have
[32:02] redemption this morning. Let's sing it
[32:04] as brother Eis comes.
[32:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[32:12] I have a maker
[32:16] [Music]

[32:25] and before
[32:27] even time began
[32:30] my life.

[32:38] He knows my name.
[32:44] He knows my everyone
[32:49] [Music]

[33:09] He calls me his home.
[33:13] Oh, and he

[34:27] and before even time began
[34:33] my life in his Hey

[35:01] Thank you Jesus.
[35:04] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[35:09] [Music]
[35:14] Oh,
[35:16] he
[35:24] call.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Daddy hears us when we call.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:40] We're happy indeed to be here again this
[35:42] morning. to bring the word. We're going
[35:46] to just have a few comments before we
[35:50] turn to the scriptures and we just want
[35:52] to maintain this spirit of worship.
[35:56] Amen. I believe that is the spirit that
[35:58] the that God loves.
[36:02] Do you believe that
[36:03] &gt;&gt; God loves that spirit of worship? He
[36:07] loves when we are just quietened our
[36:09] spirits and we forget all about
[36:12] yesterday and forget about tomorrow.
[36:16] Forget about everything.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Forget about everything. There's only
[36:20] one thing we're thinking of and that's
[36:22] him.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; How wonderful he is.
[36:26] Wonderful Lord of compassion. We are so
[36:30] grateful to what we are seeing God doing
[36:32] from day to day.
[36:34] And uh I believe in another week or so
[36:38] we're going to have
[36:40] uh one of the pastors from Brazil is
[36:43] coming through. I don't know just what
[36:45] day. Do we know brother Tony what day
[36:48] he's arriving?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Friday.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh be about another week and he'll
[36:56] be here with us. There's two or three
[36:58] brothers I believe coming. This was the
[37:01] first
[37:03] uh first church I was in in Brazil. And
[37:06] this is the brother that has had such a
[37:09] burden for the people of uh Mosmbique.
[37:14] He made many journeys to Mosmb beek.
[37:17] Mosmbique and Brazil speak the same
[37:19] language.
[37:21] also Angola.
[37:23] And he was so burdened because he would
[37:26] go there, little groups would spring up
[37:29] and there was nothing to leave them, no
[37:31] books to leave them. And he was so
[37:33] burdened over that. And from that time
[37:36] to this, I would say because largely
[37:38] because of his burden, I became burdened
[37:42] and immediately thought, well, you know,
[37:45] there's brother Dioa doing printing
[37:47] right in Africa. that shouldn't be a
[37:50] problem to get those books down there.
[37:53] The whole thing was to get coordinated
[37:55] and get the get the messages translated,
[37:58] the translated messages over to brother
[38:01] Dioa for the printing. And it just took
[38:04] some coordination. And brother Tony has
[38:06] been working very very hard over these
[38:09] this last year. And we can say when
[38:12] brother Dioa was here, he told me that
[38:15] they had now printed 26 26 messages in
[38:19] uh in the Portuguese language. and how
[38:23] how thankful we are to have been able to
[38:26] play a part in getting those messages.
[38:29] If you know I I stress that because I
[38:32] don't know I cannot tell what the
[38:34] message means to you but I know what it
[38:36] means to me. It's not just a title. It's
[38:40] not just a way of belief. It's not only
[38:44] just a few few loose ends that have been
[38:46] tied together, but to me it is a
[38:49] revelation of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[38:53] And it's a lifechanging life
[38:55] transforming word. And if we really
[38:58] believe that, then we feel that
[39:00] everybody ought to have an opportunity
[39:02] either to accept it or to reject it. Do
[39:05] you believe that?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; I certainly do. I know what it means to
[39:08] me. I know what it's done for me. I know
[39:11] what it's done for my family. I know
[39:12] what it's done for many of you. And I
[39:15] see what you have been. I see what you
[39:18] are today. And I can tell you it's not
[39:20] the not this building that did it. It's
[39:22] not the name Cloverdale Bible Way that
[39:24] did it. It's none other than the Lord
[39:26] Jesus Christ. But he had to be made
[39:29] known to you. Amen. And so we're we're
[39:32] so thankful.
[39:34] We are we're just so grateful that God
[39:37] is in the healing business. He's in the
[39:40] restoring business.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Satan's in the tearing down business.
[39:46] He's in the destroying business, but
[39:48] we're in the building business.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm happy to say to the congregation
[39:53] today, we have our brother Joey Wartz
[39:58] and his wife, Sister Stephanie, in a
[40:01] congregation with us. Uh, brother Joey
[40:04] wanted to uh he wanted to contact me and
[40:10] God was doing something supernatural.
[40:11] You know, God works on both ends.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Uh, one week ago yesterday,
[40:17] I called a I called a brother I called
[40:20] brother Daryl Hoffer
[40:22] uh brother Joey's brother-in-law and I
[40:25] said, "I want Brother Joey's telephone
[40:27] number. Give me his cell number."
[40:30] So he gave me his cell number. I was
[40:34] very busy on sat on on the very next uh
[40:38] one of the next meetings. Then I hadn't
[40:41] had a chance to phone him, but the next
[40:42] meeting
[40:44] I was just in the office. The door was
[40:46] open and brother Daryl was just going by
[40:50] and uh uh I I just kind of waved at him
[40:55] to let him know that I thanked him. I
[40:58] want to thank him for giving me brother
[40:59] Joey's phone number and uh he said,
[41:02] "Well, Sister Stephanie's here." And
[41:05] then just at that moment, she walked by
[41:07] the open door. And so I just waved in
[41:09] motion to her and I said, "I've just
[41:12] I've had brother Joey on my heart and I
[41:15] have gotten his phone number and I'm
[41:17] going to be calling him." She said, "He
[41:19] spoke to me just before I came out the
[41:22] door to go to church and said, tell
[41:24] brother Biscll I'd like to speak to
[41:26] him." I'm glad when God works on both
[41:29] ends. And we got together and spent a
[41:32] two two and a half hours together or so
[41:35] and had a time of prayer and uh uh
[41:39] repentance before God. And I want to let
[41:42] the congregation know that the scripture
[41:45] is true that the goodness of God leadth
[41:48] thee to repentance. That was one of the
[41:50] scriptures that God gave me to give our
[41:53] brother Joey. And he has with all
[41:55] sincerity
[41:57] uh made his life right between he and
[41:59] his wife and he and God. And uh I want
[42:02] the congregation to know that so that uh
[42:06] when a brother's restored, I believe
[42:08] that that's a full restoration. And we
[42:11] are in the restoring business. Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; God's in the building business
[42:18] and he's in the healing business. And
[42:21] when I see homes that are tore apart, I
[42:24] like to see God come on the scene and
[42:27] heal them up.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in that.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that cuz that's what I that's
[42:34] what the scripture teaches. We just
[42:35] believe it. And so we're so thankful and
[42:38] happy to have brother Joey and sister
[42:40] Stephanie in the in the service this
[42:42] morning. I'd like to have you stand and
[42:45] sing with me. He's the great
[42:46] emancipator.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, folks. I don't know if
[42:51] you're going to rejoice this morning,
[42:52] but I'm going to
[42:54] &gt;&gt; going to rejoice in our God.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And the people said,
[43:01] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[43:03] [Music]
[43:06] My heart and soul unfair.
[43:19] [Applause]
[43:31] Set
[43:32] me free.
[43:38] Oh glory, glory,
[43:41] glory. Hallelujah.
[43:56] He
[43:59] me
[44:03] and
[44:05] the song
[44:10] [Music]
[44:11] and my
[44:18] meat.
[44:25] Oh,
[44:29] the singing she
[44:39] might
[45:00] Please
[45:09] the song of the
[45:12] [Music]
[45:15] Hallelujah.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; That song was a favorite of our brother
[45:20] Amy Mulan who's gone on. I wonder if he
[45:23] was joining with us on the other side.
[45:26] Maybe some of the saints could just lean
[45:27] over the balcony and say, "My, how good
[45:31] it is to hear them sing that." Uh, join
[45:33] in with them. Oh, glory, glory,
[45:38] glory.
[45:40] Hallelujah.
[45:43] We lift it up.
[46:02] the song of the redeemed,
[46:09] gracious and loving heavenly father,
[46:12] we have sung the songs of Zion and we
[46:16] have prayed. We have lifted up our
[46:19] voices to you in worship and adoration.
[46:22] And this morning, Lord, we are not here
[46:24] to put in idle time. We're here to serve
[46:27] you. We are here to serve one another.
[46:31] We thank you for every person that's
[46:33] within the building, Lord, wherever they
[46:35] may be. And for those that are uh
[46:39] streaming the service, I pray, oh God,
[46:41] that you'll come into the room where
[46:43] they're at. And may the same atmosphere
[46:46] and the same power and presence of the
[46:49] Holy Spirit be their portion. Come and
[46:52] illuminate us. I pray. I pray that you
[46:55] will invigorate us with the energy of
[46:57] the Holy Ghost. I ask that you will
[47:00] anoint me, oh God, how I sense now your
[47:02] presence and nearness here. I pray,
[47:05] Father, that you will be glorified. Let
[47:08] your name be lifted up amongst the
[47:10] people. And when this people leave this
[47:13] building, I pray they will be at another
[47:15] plane, Lord, another spiritual level. I
[47:18] pray, Father, when they go out from this
[47:20] building, the glory of God, Shikina will
[47:23] be upon their face. I ask, Lord, you'll
[47:26] bless the saints everywhere. And now,
[47:29] anoint us for service and the people to
[47:31] hear in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:38] [Music]
[47:40] Take your Bibles if you would please and
[47:42] turn to Matthew's Gospel
[47:45] the first chapter.
[48:00] We're going to read from verse 18.
[48:04] And this certainly has really nothing.
[48:06] My message has nothing to do with the
[48:08] season that we're in, even though the
[48:10] text looks that way.
[48:14] Now, the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[48:16] this wise
[48:18] when, as his mother Mary was a spouse to
[48:21] Joseph, before they came together, she
[48:24] was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
[48:27] And then Joseph, her husband, being a
[48:31] just man, and not willing to make her a
[48:34] public example, was minded to put her
[48:37] away privy. And while he thought on
[48:40] these things, behold, the angel of the
[48:41] Lord appeared unto him in a dream,
[48:44] saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear
[48:46] not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for
[48:49] that which is conceived in her is of the
[48:52] Holy Ghost.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] That was one of the great scriptures
[48:56] that the prophet of God used. Uh with
[49:00] those that believe in a trinity you get
[49:03] here that knocks it in the head. You've
[49:05] got the third person conceiving the
[49:07] second person.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Then who was his father?
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; God himself was his father. Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; And uh and he shall and she shall bring
[49:20] forth a son, and thou shalt call his
[49:24] name Jesus, for he shall save his people
[49:28] from their sins. You may be seated.
[49:35] I'm carrying on actually from the last
[49:38] week or two just kind of tying into part
[49:42] of the subject I want to speak on.
[49:45] called by our new name
[49:48] to this morning and uh there's so much
[49:51] that can be said but I want to make as
[49:54] much headway as I can. Now the scripture
[49:58] which we have just concluded with says
[50:02] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[50:06] shalt call his name Jesus. I want you to
[50:09] notice that very important word for.
[50:13] for
[50:15] he shall
[50:17] uh
[50:19] for he shall save his people from their
[50:22] sins. His name will be Jesus because
[50:26] he's going to save his people from their
[50:28] sins. His name will be called Jesus for
[50:32] this is what he's going to do. What he's
[50:35] going to do and what his name is are
[50:38] synonymous. They are one and the same.
[50:42] As I said last Sunday, the nature and
[50:45] the name in the Bible are to correspond.
[50:49] That's what it's all about. Now, we all
[50:52] have names
[50:54] and
[50:55] when we were born, our parents gave us a
[51:00] a name and it's called a given name.
[51:03] That's our given name. When you fill out
[51:05] a form, you'll have a place that it'll
[51:07] say given name, and that will be your
[51:10] first or second name or third name,
[51:13] whatever. And then you have a family
[51:15] name, which will identify you with a
[51:18] family unit here on earth. And those are
[51:21] the names. And as it is uh was said in
[51:24] the Bible encyclopedia
[51:27] that the names that we have uh in the in
[51:32] our western culture really is nothing
[51:34] more than uh a name. It's just a it's an
[51:37] identification tag. Often it doesn't
[51:40] have a lot of meaning. You don't have to
[51:42] go back very very many
[51:45] uh generations before you find that. and
[51:48] and and some today also. But they had
[51:50] names had a a deeper meaning. They
[51:53] called people uh by a name because uh uh
[51:58] well, brother Southwick for example. Uh
[52:01] brother Southwick's he was H. Harvey
[52:05] Dawson Southwick because he was born up
[52:09] at Dawson Creek in that area. So they
[52:12] gave they always identified something.
[52:15] And then another one of his brothers was
[52:18] born right uh on uh Charlie Lake. So
[52:21] they called him Lake Southwick. And you
[52:24] know they have some kind of
[52:25] identification with their birth. Uh in
[52:28] the Bible we find if I should say to you
[52:32] for example if I say to you birthright
[52:36] who do you think of?
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Jacob.
[52:41] We think of Jacob. Soon as we say
[52:43] birthright, we think of Jacob because
[52:46] the birthright meant everything to him.
[52:50] He couldn't get that out of his mind.
[52:52] Brother Brandham said that birthright,
[52:54] even though he was a shyer, even though
[52:57] he was a deceiver, even though he would
[52:59] supplant his brother, even though he
[53:02] would be the kind of person he was, deep
[53:05] within him was the that absolute
[53:09] yearning. It wasn't just a desire. It
[53:12] was an obsession.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He had to have the birthright
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and that is synonymous with his name.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Birthright and Jacob are synonymous. But
[53:24] because of that which was in him, God
[53:28] had to change his name because Jacob
[53:30] would not fit what his future life was
[53:34] to be lived out. The future life that he
[53:37] was to be lived out. So I want to just
[53:39] suggest to you at the beginning of the
[53:41] service today and to all that are
[53:44] hearing me or ever will hear that your
[53:46] given name is so we can communicate and
[53:50] you can hear it called and answer it and
[53:53] and hopefully get to the dinner table on
[53:55] time or whatever more you need to do.
[53:58] And your family name has identified you
[54:00] with a genealogy in this life in this
[54:03] mortal life. But neither of those names
[54:06] really have any great significance with
[54:09] eternal things. Uh I believe that
[54:15] something within
[54:18] you
[54:20] deep deep within every being I'm talking
[54:23] about son and daughter of God. Now that
[54:27] thing that was in Jacob, wherever it
[54:29] was, could not be identified probably by
[54:33] its location, no medical doctor,
[54:37] physician could find that. No, no
[54:41] scientist could discover where that was.
[54:44] But somewhere within the inner regions
[54:47] of him was something that was very
[54:50] specific. He knew it was birthright. He
[54:54] knew that there was something that he
[54:56] had to lay hold of. It was something he
[55:00] was prepared to give up reputation for.
[55:03] It was something he was prepared to risk
[55:05] his life for and something that he was
[55:08] prepared to uh uh be the object of all
[55:11] of his brother's hatred to the point of
[55:14] wanting to destroy him. He was prepared
[55:17] to do all of that. So you can't say it
[55:20] was just some kind of nebulous thing
[55:22] that was in him. It was very specific. I
[55:25] would say that in itself was really his
[55:29] true name.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; That in itself because that was the life
[55:34] that he wanted to live.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; That was what he wanted to do. He wanted
[55:39] to do anything to get that. And it's
[55:41] written in the scripture. It's written
[55:43] in this Bible. Those things were eternal
[55:46] which was in him. That's why it's in the
[55:48] eternal word of God. And so I will say
[55:51] to you that that spiritual
[55:55] uh spiritual element, that spiritual
[55:58] characteristic, that spiritual thing
[56:01] which God has planted in us, we call it
[56:04] a seed. uh the seed of God. We we can
[56:07] give it different terminology, but
[56:10] without even being able to describe it
[56:12] fully, that thing which God put in us
[56:16] from the beginning, which God ordained
[56:19] would be in us. When God called us,
[56:22] that's what he was calling to. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; And when he called us, he very few
[56:28] people I suppose some have heard their
[56:30] their natural name called uh Moses did.
[56:35] God said to Moses, "Moses, Moses." He
[56:39] called Samuel, "Samuel, Samuel." Three
[56:42] times he has used that name. But when he
[56:46] spoke to Abraham, Abram rather before
[56:50] his name was changed to Abraham. The
[56:52] Bible just says and didn't even say it
[56:54] called him by name. It just said that
[56:56] and God spoke to Abram. Well, how did he
[56:59] speak to him? How does he speak to you?
[57:01] How does he speak to me? He doesn't need
[57:03] to call our name. But he the spirit of
[57:06] God begins to respond to something that
[57:08] is deep within us. And we hear that
[57:11] voice and we feel that pull because it
[57:15] is our real self. It is the real person,
[57:19] the real you. And many times the uh the
[57:23] outer shell and the and the man or woman
[57:27] that you are is at war with that or at
[57:30] least it appears to be at war. It's in
[57:33] conflict with it. The flesh is weak and
[57:36] the flesh, Satan uses the flesh and uses
[57:39] this physical mortal life. He uses every
[57:42] kind of thing he can to to uh suppress
[57:45] that and to push it down, but yet it
[57:48] won't be pushed down. It is the lily at
[57:51] the bottom of the pond. It is the grass
[57:54] that's under the cement block. It's
[57:56] going to come out somehow because the
[57:58] sun is drawing it out to life. It can't
[58:02] be. It can't be suppressed forever. It's
[58:04] going to come out. It's going to do what
[58:06] God has called it to do. We're going to
[58:08] be what he wants us to be. Amen. And
[58:12] that is your real name. That's when God
[58:15] was is calling you. That's what he calls
[58:17] to. And you hear it.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I hear the call.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[58:26] shall save his people from their sins.
[58:29] In the Philadelphiaian church age,
[58:32] prophet says, "And I will write," he's
[58:34] referring to this, "and I will write
[58:36] upon him the name of my God and the name
[58:40] of the city of my God."
[58:43] And what is the name of God? Well,
[58:47] he was God with us or Emanuel, but that
[58:51] was not his given name.
[58:54] Thou shalt call his name Jesus. So now
[58:57] that was his given name. Thou shalt call
[59:00] his name Jesus. Jesus said, I am come in
[59:03] my father's name and you receive me not.
[59:07] Therefore, the name of God is Jesus. For
[59:11] that is the name he came in. He is Lord
[59:16] Jesus Christ. And what name does a woman
[59:20] take when she marries the man? She takes
[59:23] his name. It will be his name that is
[59:27] given unto the bride when he takes her
[59:29] to himself. That is why we are presently
[59:32] called the bride. He has taken us to
[59:35] himself.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] In Revelation 21:9, it says, "And there
[59:41] came unto me one of the seven angels,
[59:43] which had the seven vials full of the
[59:46] seven last plagues, and talked with me,
[59:49] saying, Come Heather, I will show thee
[59:52] the bride, the Lamb's wife." Now, thou
[59:55] shalt the the the Lamb, thou shalt call
[59:58] his name Jesus, for he shall save his
[1:00:01] people from their sins. And I could say
[1:00:04] today without adding anything to the
[1:00:05] scripture, and she shall be called his
[1:00:08] bride or the lamb's wife, for she shall
[1:00:12] be his wife.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; For she shall do a certain thing. She
[1:00:16] shall live a certain life. She shall be
[1:00:20] a certain kind of a person, a people, a
[1:00:23] church.
[1:00:25] Revelation 2 and 17,
[1:00:28] he that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:00:30] the spirit saith unto the churches. To
[1:00:32] him that overcomemeth will I give to eat
[1:00:34] of the hidden mana and will give him a
[1:00:37] white stone. We spoke on it last week
[1:00:40] some. And in the stone, not on the
[1:00:43] stone, but in the stone a new name
[1:00:47] written which no man knoweth, saving he
[1:00:50] that receiveth it. And brother Brandham
[1:00:52] made a point on that. No one knows it,
[1:00:54] but you know it. You know, the kind of
[1:00:57] life, the kind of desire, the kind of
[1:01:00] the way that God speaks to you. And God
[1:01:02] speaks to all of us differently. We're
[1:01:05] all unique individuals. God speaks to
[1:01:07] you in a way he doesn't speak to me.
[1:01:10] Speaks to me in a way he doesn't speak
[1:01:11] to you. But he speaks to us as we need
[1:01:14] to be spoken to. You believe that?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And what God is responding to is not
[1:01:20] this outer man. This older man will be
[1:01:22] affected. But he is speaking to that
[1:01:25] eternal thing that he put in you in the
[1:01:28] beginning or from the beginning or
[1:01:30] before the beginning. That is that
[1:01:32] eternal part. I really need to turn you
[1:01:35] around and and have you focus on that.
[1:01:37] And that is going to be essentially the
[1:01:39] service this morning. So you can see
[1:01:42] that it's it's not know what we're
[1:01:45] called on here in life. And you're you
[1:01:48] you write your name every week many
[1:01:51] times, no doubt. And we're signing it
[1:01:54] all the time and identifying ourselves
[1:01:56] in this life. Surely it's incumbent upon
[1:02:00] us to come into the house of God and
[1:02:03] realize that we're not just, you know,
[1:02:05] an individual uh a number, a statistic
[1:02:08] of humanity crawling over the face of
[1:02:11] the earth, but we are a being that God
[1:02:14] has placed here. And we and God placed
[1:02:17] us here with a specific nature and
[1:02:19] character which is in his seed. And that
[1:02:22] is what makes us real sons and daughters
[1:02:25] of God.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; So we have our name, our given name, our
[1:02:30] family name. But because as sons and
[1:02:33] daughters of God, we have a seed within
[1:02:36] us that has a certain nature that is
[1:02:39] going to live out a certain life,
[1:02:43] certain characteristics which we did not
[1:02:45] inherit from mother and father. So it's
[1:02:47] not by our family name. Has nothing to
[1:02:50] do with our family name. And it has
[1:02:52] nothing to do with our given name. It is
[1:02:55] a certain character, a certain thing
[1:02:57] that we're going to exhibit. we're going
[1:02:59] to express in this life. And that is
[1:03:03] God's nature. That is of God. It is that
[1:03:06] divine part. And a lot of people want to
[1:03:10] they they want to do away with that.
[1:03:12] Say, "Well, that is cultish or that is
[1:03:14] some heresy that we believe there can be
[1:03:16] anything divine." I tell you what, if
[1:03:18] that seed within us isn't divine, we
[1:03:20] haven't got eternal life.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; We have eternal life by virtue of that.
[1:03:24] And that's the thing that calls out to
[1:03:26] father. And that's that's what father
[1:03:28] responds to.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And that is really
[1:03:34] our new name. And I'm not saying that's
[1:03:37] all there is to it. By far far be it
[1:03:40] from so I'm just referring to that is
[1:03:43] that's really the person that you are.
[1:03:45] In other words, the new man.
[1:03:47] The new man. We are new creatures in
[1:03:50] Christ Jesus. Your earthly name doesn't
[1:03:53] fit that new man. doesn't fit his
[1:03:56] nature, doesn't fit what he's called to.
[1:04:03] In Revelation 3 and 12, it also says,
[1:04:05] "Him that overcomemeth will I make a
[1:04:08] pillar in the temple of God, and he
[1:04:10] shall go no more out. I will write upon
[1:04:13] him the name of my God, and the name of
[1:04:16] the city of my God, which is New
[1:04:18] Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
[1:04:20] heaven from God, and I will write upon
[1:04:23] him my new name.
[1:04:28] Now, just quickly,
[1:04:32] uh, I'm just going to give these
[1:04:33] references. You don't have to turn to
[1:04:35] them because I'm I'm moving real
[1:04:36] quickly. in Genesis 17:5
[1:04:39] says, "Neither shall thy name anymore be
[1:04:43] called Abram,
[1:04:45] but thy name shall be called Abraham."
[1:04:48] For once again, you find the same thing.
[1:04:52] It doesn't just end. Neither will your
[1:04:54] name be Abram anymore. It'll be Abraham.
[1:04:56] Could have been the end. But that wasn't
[1:04:58] the end of the sentence. You'll be
[1:05:00] called Abraham. For a father of many
[1:05:04] nations have I made you. You wouldn't
[1:05:06] have Abraham if it wasn't for the rest
[1:05:08] of it. The rest of it is inseparable
[1:05:11] from the change of the name. You will be
[1:05:14] Abraham, for you're going to be a father
[1:05:16] of many nations. in Genesis 13-28.
[1:05:20] And he said, "Thy name shall be called
[1:05:23] no more Jacob, but Israel, for a prince
[1:05:29] hast thou, as a prince hast thou power
[1:05:32] with God and with men, and hast
[1:05:35] prevailed." You will be called Israel
[1:05:38] now for because there's something else
[1:05:42] that is being expressed in you that you
[1:05:45] didn't have before. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3 and 20, and Adam called his
[1:05:51] wife's name Eve because she was the
[1:05:54] mother of all living.
[1:05:58] That's why she was called Eve. Eve just
[1:06:01] wasn't a given name because Adam
[1:06:03] thought, well, I call my wife. No, he
[1:06:06] was called Eve because she was a mother.
[1:06:10] You've been called I've been called
[1:06:11] Edward. That's where it ends. I don't
[1:06:15] know why they called me Edward.
[1:06:17] It didn't say, "Well, we're going to
[1:06:19] call you Edward." Because
[1:06:21] they probably didn't have a clue what it
[1:06:23] was. If Well, maybe there's somebody way
[1:06:25] back in the family has been named that.
[1:06:27] I don't know. And there are there are
[1:06:30] names that uh
[1:06:33] have been given
[1:06:35] even family families who have given
[1:06:37] their children names and then they felt
[1:06:41] that their name was disgraced.
[1:06:44] So they wanted to get rid of that
[1:06:48] uh child and there's a a spot or two on
[1:06:51] earth where they sent them away. The
[1:06:54] aristocracy of Europe sent their bad
[1:06:58] boys, their sons to a place called the
[1:07:01] aisle of man and they were called
[1:07:03] remittance men because they just said,
[1:07:06] "Hey, you know, get out of our life. Get
[1:07:09] out of our home. You are a disgrace to
[1:07:12] the family." and we'll just go over
[1:07:14] there and we'll just pay you to stay
[1:07:16] there. And they paid remittance and had
[1:07:19] them paid to stay there. And that that's
[1:07:21] that's where the aisle of man have their
[1:07:24] background. And that's where my wife is
[1:07:27] from.
[1:07:29] I've always told her, don't go, whatever
[1:07:31] you do, don't go too far back in your
[1:07:33] history. you know, she went over there
[1:07:36] and with her mother and looked at a
[1:07:37] bunch of the tombstones and found the
[1:07:39] names of of her grandparents and etc. or
[1:07:44] family name on down, but we're not
[1:07:46] bothering to trace down our roots.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; The only roots we're interested in are
[1:07:51] on the other side. That's the roots
[1:07:53] we're interested in. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; But there were those that were wanted to
[1:07:58] eradicate, get rid of these people
[1:08:01] because they're shaming our good name. A
[1:08:04] good name in this world is is something
[1:08:06] to be desired. I think that that we
[1:08:08] should. But on the other hand, uh what
[1:08:11] the the biblical understanding and the
[1:08:14] biblical teaching of it is has nothing
[1:08:16] to do with the way we understand it now.
[1:08:19] And I I just I'm excited.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; In Romans, it says, "For whom he did
[1:08:27] forno, he also did predestinate to be
[1:08:31] conformed to the image of his son, that
[1:08:35] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:08:37] brethren." And moreover, whom he did
[1:08:40] predestinate, them he also called. This
[1:08:43] is where I started last Sunday. Them he
[1:08:46] also called. And this call was different
[1:08:48] from a call two verses further up in the
[1:08:51] scripture. But I just want to focus on
[1:08:54] this one. This them who who he did
[1:08:56] predestinate them he also called. And
[1:09:00] this is a loud call. This isn't just you
[1:09:04] know by the way if you want to I'd like
[1:09:06] to get your attention for a moment but
[1:09:08] this is a loud call. It is to utter in a
[1:09:12] loud voice. It has the uh the the uh
[1:09:16] thought of an invitation, but it also is
[1:09:19] to call you by name. And so whatever
[1:09:22] this call is,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; whatever this call is, and I'm sure you
[1:09:26] didn't hear Bill, Harry, E, you know,
[1:09:29] Ed, Susie, whatever more, Joel, so on.
[1:09:32] That isn't what you heard. You heard
[1:09:35] something when this call that came from
[1:09:38] the predestinated plan of Almighty God.
[1:09:42] When it came to your ear, it wasn't even
[1:09:44] the eard drum. It went immediately down
[1:09:48] to the very regions of the soul and you
[1:09:51] heard something that was so specific to
[1:09:54] you, you looked around and wondered,
[1:09:56] "Who told that preacher about me? Who
[1:09:58] told him what I'm thinking? Who told him
[1:10:01] what I experienced today?" That is so
[1:10:04] specific. It's because your father in
[1:10:07] heaven who know knows you from the
[1:10:10] beginning. He called you by your real
[1:10:13] name. Hallelujah. And you were trembling
[1:10:16] at it. It it was so revealing how this
[1:10:21] God how and then you thought maybe the
[1:10:23] person We've had it here all the time.
[1:10:26] We've had it here all the time. People
[1:10:28] thinking, well, you must have been in
[1:10:30] the car as we drove to church. You must
[1:10:32] have been around the table last night as
[1:10:34] we were talking in around dinner table.
[1:10:37] Uh uh did you talk to this brother or
[1:10:40] that brother? I just finished talking to
[1:10:41] them. I poured out my whole heart about
[1:10:43] those things and then you come and
[1:10:44] preached it. We had questions and you
[1:10:47] took the very question and gave the
[1:10:48] answer. Or did you speak to the visiting
[1:10:51] minister? Sometimes they think I spoke
[1:10:52] to the visiting minister. I never talked
[1:10:54] to a visiting minister.
[1:10:56] They come up here and sometimes they say
[1:10:58] things about pastor. You think I put a a
[1:11:02] bug in their ear to give a plug to the
[1:11:04] pastor? Not a chance. I know better than
[1:11:06] that. I let them just come up here, let
[1:11:09] the Holy Spirit say it here. It wasn't
[1:11:11] very long ago a brother got here and he
[1:11:13] preached his whole sermon and says, "Now
[1:11:15] just a just a comment and he started
[1:11:17] started saying some things about pastor.
[1:11:19] I thought that was incredible. Just
[1:11:22] incredible the way God does things." Or
[1:11:24] someone may just throw something out. I
[1:11:26] might do it. And and here it's something
[1:11:28] that is deep down inside. What is it?
[1:11:30] It's your father
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; calling you, speaking to you, advising
[1:11:36] you, cautioning you, guiding you. Don't
[1:11:39] we have a lovely father?
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And so, you're being called.
[1:11:49] It's to receive a and this call is not
[1:11:52] only uh a loud call, but it's to be
[1:11:55] called by name. It's not your earthly
[1:11:59] given name. It's not your family name.
[1:12:03] It's the name that God has given you.
[1:12:05] Whatever it is and uh perhaps we say
[1:12:09] Jesus. Now Jesus to us, we all identify
[1:12:12] with it in the English language. you go
[1:12:14] to some other place, it will sound very
[1:12:16] very different because it's not just the
[1:12:20] utterance of the of the sound that we
[1:12:22] make from our mouth.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; It's very different. And and those of
[1:12:29] you that speak different languages, you
[1:12:31] you can uh you you can understand what
[1:12:34] I'm saying. But when God calls, it is to
[1:12:38] call by name. Number one, it is to give
[1:12:42] a name. And we have been given a name.
[1:12:46] It's to receive the name
[1:12:49] or uh to to be called or to bear the
[1:12:53] name or a title. Now, as bride, that's a
[1:12:56] title. And as wife, it's a title. But
[1:13:00] the name
[1:13:02] I I I cannot give any pronunciation to
[1:13:06] the name because I don't have any clue
[1:13:09] what that is. But the name the deeper
[1:13:12] meaning of the name is thou shalt call
[1:13:15] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[1:13:18] people from his sin. Let's say that
[1:13:20] Jesus did nothing from that time forward
[1:13:22] to save his people from their sins. If
[1:13:25] Jesus had not lived the life he lived,
[1:13:28] died the death he died and raised again
[1:13:31] from the dead, what would the name of
[1:13:33] Jesus, man?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; What would it what value would there be
[1:13:36] that I can say Jesus
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; or you can say Jesus? What what good
[1:13:41] would that do you if he had not lived
[1:13:44] the life? So the important part is that
[1:13:46] the life was lived.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's Jesus.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He healed. That's Jesus.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; There were people who called out to him.
[1:13:57] Probably didn't even know his name.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And have mercy on me, Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; See, but he lived the life. It was the
[1:14:06] life he lived that was the real person.
[1:14:09] That was Jesus. The life that you live
[1:14:12] is the real you.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the life that you live by
[1:14:16] the divine power of God, by the Holy
[1:14:19] Spirit coming to that life and coming to
[1:14:22] that seat and giving you resurrection
[1:14:24] life. That is the person.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; That's the eternal one.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's the one that'll receive athophony
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; and go on into eternity in a glorified
[1:14:37] body.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] And unto the angel, Revelation 3:1, "And
[1:14:46] unto the angel of the church of Sardis
[1:14:48] in Sardis, write these things saith he
[1:14:51] that hath the seven spirits of God, and
[1:14:54] the seven stars. I know thy works,
[1:14:59] that thou hast a name. I know thy works,
[1:15:04] that thou hast a name, that thou livest
[1:15:08] and art dead.
[1:15:11] You have a name that you live. But
[1:15:14] notice how closely how it is. I know thy
[1:15:17] works
[1:15:19] that thou hast a name that thou livest.
[1:15:23] I know thy works. That you have a name
[1:15:26] that you live. What was their name? What
[1:15:29] was God looking at as far as their name
[1:15:31] was concerned? He was looking at their
[1:15:33] works in the life that they lived. And
[1:15:36] that's why, oh my, I have to just hold
[1:15:38] myself back a wee bit. But that's why a
[1:15:42] prophet come in this generation. Now I'm
[1:15:44] just taking a quantum leap forward. Then
[1:15:47] I have to come back. So I just don't
[1:15:49] want to hold it anymore. That's why when
[1:15:52] a prophet came forward, he he he just
[1:15:55] blasted and chopped with the sharp sword
[1:15:59] of the word of God. Presbyterians or
[1:16:01] Baptist or Pentecost or Catholic. What
[1:16:03] is it? He's just hacking at those given
[1:16:05] names cuz they don't mean nothing. Just
[1:16:08] names given by men to identify people as
[1:16:11] little groups. And so he just chopped
[1:16:13] hacked at them. They don't mean a thing.
[1:16:16] And because they had these names of, oh
[1:16:18] well, I'm Presbyterian or I'm Pentecost
[1:16:20] or I'm this. They're nothing. That
[1:16:22] doesn't mean anything. That just given
[1:16:25] names has nothing to do with eternal
[1:16:27] life.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; you want to listen to birth painans.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You just want to listen to birth
[1:16:38] painans. And brother Brandham lays it
[1:16:40] out for those people. And it's a big
[1:16:42] ecumenical. It is the very one where the
[1:16:44] Catholic priest came and gave him his
[1:16:46] Bible because brother Brandham couldn't
[1:16:47] find his place in that new Bible his
[1:16:49] wife had just given him for Christmas
[1:16:50] and he couldn't find his place. And
[1:16:52] Bishop Stanley came up and gave him his
[1:16:54] Bible. Here, you know, read it from my
[1:16:56] Bible. and he spoke some words to him
[1:16:59] and and brother Brandon just takes and
[1:17:01] he just dissects it all of these you
[1:17:05] know and it's so quiet it's so quiet
[1:17:09] and then
[1:17:11] says now that's right in line with my
[1:17:13] message he says now you know talking
[1:17:16] because we've come to the end time now
[1:17:20] he said read all of history you'll never
[1:17:23] find a place in history where there's
[1:17:26] been an international worldwide
[1:17:28] ministry, a messenger whose name ended
[1:17:33] with ham.
[1:17:35] Now he's actually come to a a family
[1:17:38] name.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; It's a very very unique thing.
[1:17:43] And he says never ended with ham.
[1:17:47] He just stops.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; He just silent letting them put two and
[1:17:52] two together. And then he says, "Graham,
[1:17:57] G R A H A M." And you I could just see
[1:18:01] their eyes probably just rolling in
[1:18:03] their heads.
[1:18:05] But he says, "That's only six letters."
[1:18:08] He says, "But Abraham,
[1:18:11] Ab R a H, has seven letters."
[1:18:16] He doesn't take it any further.
[1:18:19] And he talks about Elohim coming to
[1:18:21] Abraham.
[1:18:23] Abraham. Ab R A H A M. Elohim came to
[1:18:28] him in the flesh. God coming down in the
[1:18:32] flesh and saying and giving her name now
[1:18:37] and God identifying people by their
[1:18:39] name. So why did Sarah laugh? Why did
[1:18:42] Sarah laugh? And he's going through
[1:18:45] that. And then just as evidence, you
[1:18:49] want to listen to it. Get a hold of it
[1:18:51] and listen to it. It's so quiet. They're
[1:18:54] so They're hearing what they don't want
[1:18:56] to hear.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; But then he just ties it right into the
[1:19:02] day that we're in. And you cannot miss
[1:19:04] it. You cannot escape it. They're in the
[1:19:06] trap. And now begin to call the people
[1:19:09] out. Why was it that God was, you know,
[1:19:12] here we are in an age when name didn't
[1:19:14] mean really? Name doesn't mean a whole
[1:19:16] lot. Name means what does it mean to
[1:19:20] you? It's just your help you get through
[1:19:23] life. But you know they say that the
[1:19:25] sweetest music to a person's ear is
[1:19:28] their name.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; People love to hear their name. It's
[1:19:32] it's it's sweet music. Wouldn't it be
[1:19:34] terrible if you didn't have a name? You
[1:19:36] who are you? I don't know. Wouldn't that
[1:19:39] be something? Well, I want to have a
[1:19:41] driver's license. I want to have this. I
[1:19:42] want to have you. You wouldn't get along
[1:19:45] very far.
[1:19:46] Hey, I go down to the bank here every
[1:19:48] once in a while and some of these folks
[1:19:50] here from other countries, they they
[1:19:51] will appreciate what I'm saying because
[1:19:54] we know this last brother from
[1:19:56] Usbekiststan is brother Anatoli. So he
[1:20:00] said, "Well, you'll need your you'll
[1:20:01] need your passport to cash this check to
[1:20:05] open up his passport."
[1:20:07] Hey, where's Anatoli here? There's no
[1:20:11] name. That name's not here in the
[1:20:14] passport. Yeah, I know. you know, but
[1:20:16] this is my name here. Okay, I tell you
[1:20:19] what, it was a challenge. I didn't even
[1:20:22] try to say it, but we got down to the
[1:20:24] bank said, well, this this better be the
[1:20:26] name we better use then. We better stay
[1:20:28] with this passport name. Suddenly, a
[1:20:30] name becomes very very important,
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; you know, but we all know we all know
[1:20:36] him by a certain name. That just that's
[1:20:37] just the identification tag to get along
[1:20:40] through life. And then his real name was
[1:20:41] something else. until we get there. In a
[1:20:45] lot of countries as you know they use
[1:20:46] the last name first
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; and that's what it is
[1:20:51] in a lot of places or I won't say too
[1:20:53] many places now but a lot of place they
[1:20:55] just have one name and that's all they
[1:20:58] need
[1:21:01] exactly what the sound of your name is.
[1:21:04] I'm not worried about it. People wonder,
[1:21:06] oh I wonder when brother Brandham's
[1:21:08] going to reveal the new name of God.
[1:21:10] Well, if it was, it's probably something
[1:21:12] you can't utter anyway.
[1:21:16] And they say that even the name of God,
[1:21:19] that is why when the Jewish people write
[1:21:22] God, they G space D because nobody can
[1:21:28] say or utter. It's too holy. It's too
[1:21:31] sacred.
[1:21:32] But brother Bram says your name, that
[1:21:36] new name that you have, he says, you
[1:21:39] know it. You can't utter it, but you
[1:21:42] know, you know what's happened. Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; and he that overcomemeth the same shall
[1:21:54] be clothed in white raignnt, and I will
[1:21:57] not blot his name out of the book of
[1:21:59] life, but I will confess his name before
[1:22:05] my father and before his angels.
[1:22:09] The Bible speaks of Judas that by
[1:22:12] transgression he fell. He said he was
[1:22:16] given a part of the apostilhip
[1:22:20] but his name what was it? He he did not
[1:22:25] live out he did not live out any life.
[1:22:31] He did not exhibit he did not express
[1:22:34] anything to do of apostilhip. His name
[1:22:37] is not in the book. And it's not just
[1:22:40] that God took an erase and says, "Well,
[1:22:42] okay, here's Judas. I'm erasing Judas's
[1:22:45] name." That wasn't it.
[1:22:48] That's why I I have a tremendous amount
[1:22:52] of
[1:22:54] uh
[1:22:57] well, fear, I guess, would be the word.
[1:23:00] When I see people
[1:23:02] that will abandon
[1:23:04] their spiritual life
[1:23:07] and not live the life of this word and
[1:23:12] other good people that has nothing to do
[1:23:13] with it. That's just the same as having
[1:23:15] just a common name. Live good people,
[1:23:18] live good life, be just common, you
[1:23:20] know, Christians and all the rest of it.
[1:23:22] We're not called to that, friends.
[1:23:25] That's why we've been given the message
[1:23:26] that we've been given. We've been given
[1:23:28] that message because that when when the
[1:23:32] Holy Spirit, if you just put this
[1:23:33] connection together, when the Holy
[1:23:35] Spirit comes upon that word, upon that
[1:23:39] word for this hour that's been given,
[1:23:42] and that word has been received into
[1:23:44] your heart, you will be another person.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot live the same way you lived
[1:23:51] before. Can you say amen to that?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] Now I my I have a question or two here.
[1:24:01] What does God have in mind
[1:24:04] when he refers to a new name? What does
[1:24:06] he have in mind when he speaks of the
[1:24:09] new name?
[1:24:12] That's the question. And in the Bible,
[1:24:16] we know that the people had uh names
[1:24:19] that would had such deeper significance.
[1:24:24] And uh now as I said last Sunday, a name
[1:24:28] a name represented the whole person.
[1:24:32] And I I really want to labor this. I
[1:24:35] want to stay on it because uh in our
[1:24:38] society and in our culture, it's just so
[1:24:42] completely the opposite. We don't think
[1:24:44] of people, we don't think of them in
[1:24:47] association with the with the kind of
[1:24:49] life that they are to live. It could be
[1:24:52] said that the name was the person. Now,
[1:24:58] when the Bible speaks about
[1:25:01] in in Exodus, uh I think I'm I'm just
[1:25:04] have you turn there with me for a
[1:25:06] moment. Just come to my mind just now to
[1:25:08] the 32nd uh 32nd chapter.
[1:25:15] 33rd chapter.
[1:25:23] Now before we even read this for a
[1:25:25] moment, just think Moses has now he has
[1:25:30] been he has been a shepherd in the
[1:25:32] wilderness. He's been a next to the
[1:25:34] pharaoh. He's been like a son of the
[1:25:36] pharaoh. He's run now into the
[1:25:39] wilderness. He's slaying a man, an
[1:25:41] Egyptian. He's been in the wilderness
[1:25:43] for 40 years. He's been before the
[1:25:45] pillar of fire, the burning bush. He's
[1:25:48] heard the voice of God speak directly to
[1:25:50] him. He's already been back to Pharaoh
[1:25:53] with his brother Aaron. He has brought
[1:25:55] all the plagues throughout Egypt. He has
[1:25:58] cast down his rod. It has become a
[1:26:01] serpent. He's taken it up again. It's
[1:26:03] eaten up all the other other magicians
[1:26:05] rods. He has crossed the Red Sea. He has
[1:26:09] leading. All he's seen is supernatural
[1:26:12] after supernatural. He has seen the
[1:26:14] mighty hand of Almighty God perhaps like
[1:26:17] no other person uh certainly up to that
[1:26:20] time. And Moses said in the 13th verse,
[1:26:23] "Now therefore, I pray thee," he's
[1:26:25] speaking to God, "if I have found grace
[1:26:28] in thy sight, show me now thy way that I
[1:26:33] may know thee." Think what he's saying.
[1:26:36] That I may know thee. a man who has seen
[1:26:39] what he's seen. He but he but but is,
[1:26:43] you know, no matter how far we walk with
[1:26:45] God or what we see or what we experience
[1:26:47] with God, we recognize there's more that
[1:26:50] we don't know than we do know.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And the more we come to know, the deeper
[1:26:55] it is and the more greater that it is.
[1:26:58] And he says, "That I might know thee,
[1:27:01] and that I might find grace in thy
[1:27:03] sight,
[1:27:04] and consider that this nation is thy
[1:27:07] people." And he said, God speaking back,
[1:27:10] "My presence shall go with thee, and I
[1:27:14] will give thee rest." Now this word
[1:27:18] presence, panemium, it is actually my
[1:27:21] person. I will go with you. And it's the
[1:27:24] same word for face. I will. And that is
[1:27:27] why over in revelation the the the
[1:27:31] seventh uh description of Jesus Christ
[1:27:35] that his face was as the son. That's the
[1:27:39] last one because in the message uh the
[1:27:43] last messenger is to bring us into the
[1:27:46] very presence of the person. This isn't
[1:27:50] just an anointing. Now this isn't just
[1:27:52] some happy little thing. The prophet's
[1:27:55] ministry, the purpose of his ministry
[1:27:58] was to bring the people directly into
[1:28:01] the presence of almighty God, which was
[1:28:04] the same phrase as saying face to face.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; If you can understand, I'm not I'm not
[1:28:12] saying it too strong. I'm saying it
[1:28:14] because it's the truth. to bring a
[1:28:16] person into the presence and I'm talking
[1:28:18] about the presence of almighty God was
[1:28:22] to bring them face to face with the
[1:28:24] personal
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; and that's what the ministry that you've
[1:28:28] been brought under is to do. That's why
[1:28:30] we don't want to live way down at some
[1:28:32] lower level. You want to go out of here
[1:28:35] today if you if you don't get anything
[1:28:36] else. Go out of these doors today and
[1:28:38] say, "God, you called me
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; in this day. You didn't call me just to
[1:28:44] have a little better life, a little
[1:28:46] better better relationship, have a
[1:28:48] better home, have a better job. That
[1:28:50] isn't why you called me. You called me.
[1:28:53] I've heard the call. You called me by my
[1:28:55] real name. And you called me so I could
[1:28:58] be face to face with you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Brought into your presence.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "My presence shalt go with
[1:29:07] thee and give thee rest." And he said
[1:29:10] unto him, "If thy presence go not with
[1:29:14] me, carry us not up hence. For wherein
[1:29:17] shall we know? For wherein shall it be
[1:29:20] known here that that I and thy people
[1:29:24] have found grace in thy sight? Is it not
[1:29:26] that thou goest with us? So shall we be
[1:29:29] separated, I and thy people, from all
[1:29:33] the people uh from all the people that
[1:29:36] are upon the face of the earth." Hear
[1:29:38] what he's saying. He said in this be in
[1:29:41] this kind of a presence having this kind
[1:29:43] of a relationship we will be different
[1:29:46] from all people on the earth.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will say the people of
[1:29:51] this message are different from all the
[1:29:54] people of the earth. Not because we
[1:29:57] dress different. Not because we have
[1:29:59] different names. Not because you have
[1:30:01] long hair, long skirts. Not because of
[1:30:03] anything. Not because of any works. Not
[1:30:05] because of any form of worship words we
[1:30:07] have. But it's because we have been
[1:30:09] brought into the presence of almighty
[1:30:12] God face to face. Whether we believe it
[1:30:15] or not, that doesn't change the fact.
[1:30:18] The fact is that God is in this word.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; God is in this message. And those that
[1:30:24] believe it and the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:30:26] that word, they are transformed.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; They're called into it. They're invited
[1:30:32] into it. They have heard the call. And
[1:30:35] that call was their name. Their true
[1:30:39] name. You probably can't put any sound.
[1:30:42] You can't put any any particular sound
[1:30:44] to it because but you do know one thing.
[1:30:47] God called me. God spoke to me and I
[1:30:51] have answered that call. I'm telling you
[1:30:54] today that call was your real name.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's your real name. And your call. He
[1:31:00] called you so that because of that call,
[1:31:04] you'll be a different you'll be a
[1:31:05] different kind of a person. You'll be
[1:31:07] the expression that he desired. I called
[1:31:12] you shall be Abraham because or for a
[1:31:16] father of many nations. I'm making a
[1:31:18] father of many nations. You'll be called
[1:31:21] bride because you will live different
[1:31:25] from all other.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You shall do it.
[1:31:29] Hallelujah.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; It didn't say he'll earn a new name. I
[1:31:34] will give him
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; a new name. What I'm saying to you, it
[1:31:38] isn't that he's going to give you just a
[1:31:40] certain sounding uh that you'll be
[1:31:42] called. I will give him I will give her
[1:31:45] a new life. They shall receive it. And
[1:31:49] it's already been written. It's written
[1:31:51] in a white stone. It's a revelation. And
[1:31:55] it cannot be moved. They'll never be
[1:31:57] moved from this because it's a personal
[1:32:00] revelation and no man knows it but they
[1:32:03] know it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That person knows it.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; This is blessed friends.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It's blessed. Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And and uh down in verse 18 or we'll
[1:32:25] read verse 17. And the Lord said unto
[1:32:28] Moses, I will do this thing also that
[1:32:30] thou hast spoken for thou hast found
[1:32:33] grace in my sight and I know thee by
[1:32:37] name.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Wasn't he was he wasn't saying I know
[1:32:41] you by Moses. I know you by name. I know
[1:32:45] what you're going to be. Hallelujah. I
[1:32:49] know you're going to be the shepherd of
[1:32:50] Israel. I know you're going to lead
[1:32:52] these people. I know you're going to be
[1:32:54] a meek man, the meakest in all the earth
[1:32:57] because I have given you a name
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; and I know you by name.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy
[1:33:07] glory.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, he's walked through the Red Sea on
[1:33:11] dry land. He's seen the plagues of
[1:33:14] Israel. He's seen all of these things.
[1:33:16] He's still wanting to see his glory.
[1:33:20] And God knows what he's saying. And he
[1:33:23] said, "I will make all my goodness pass
[1:33:25] before thee. I will proclaim the name of
[1:33:28] the Lord before thee." Now understand,
[1:33:32] it's not God passing by Moses and
[1:33:35] saying, "The Lord, the Lord, the Lord,
[1:33:37] the Lord." That is what he's saying. So
[1:33:40] when we say we lift up the Lord, I lift
[1:33:42] up my hands, I I exalt your name, I'll
[1:33:46] tell you what then what comes out of our
[1:33:49] mouth has to correspond with the life
[1:33:52] that's been lived.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. If it isn't
[1:34:00] that way, then there's something that is
[1:34:03] has uh something is irreconcilable. But
[1:34:06] the name, we exalt his name. By exalting
[1:34:10] his name, it's the life that we live.
[1:34:13] Hallelujah. And we don't live at the
[1:34:16] level we'd like to live. That's the
[1:34:18] other part of it. But we live what God
[1:34:20] allows us to live. And we live simply.
[1:34:24] We live humbly. We live before him.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:29] And even that desire that is there to
[1:34:32] live closer to be more dedicated more
[1:34:37] consecrated to be more whatever it is I
[1:34:40] can't describe it cuz it's your desire
[1:34:43] that desire is driving you to fulfill
[1:34:46] your spiritual purpose on earth and we
[1:34:50] only have this season to do it and the
[1:34:52] devil would love to rob us by keeping us
[1:34:54] so engrossed with everything else of
[1:34:57] life. We have to do it. We have to pay
[1:34:59] our bills. We have to live. We have to
[1:35:01] And this is a tension time. It's a
[1:35:03] pressure time. We've got more to do than
[1:35:06] we have time to do. Is that not the
[1:35:08] truth? All of us do. It's a pressure
[1:35:11] time, isn't it? But that is Satan's
[1:35:13] trick also. We want to keep him in
[1:35:15] check.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to keep him in hand
[1:35:19] so we have time. Time to live out our
[1:35:23] real true life. what God has called us
[1:35:26] to live.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You're called to be a farmer, a
[1:35:34] carpenter, a plumber, a drywaller, or a
[1:35:37] housewife or whatever more. All the
[1:35:39] duties that we have, we're we're called
[1:35:41] because that is the part of our call
[1:35:44] where we are uh manifesting and showing
[1:35:47] uh Christ to the world. We have to do
[1:35:50] that. That is part of our life. But this
[1:35:53] other that life is not to dominate and
[1:35:58] dictate to the other life. It is our
[1:36:01] spiritual life that's to dictate to our
[1:36:03] natural life.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Show me thy glory." And he
[1:36:13] said, 'I'll make all my goodness pass
[1:36:14] before thee, and I will proclaim the
[1:36:16] name of the Lord before thee, and will
[1:36:18] be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
[1:36:21] and will show mercy to on whom I will
[1:36:23] show mercy. And he said, and God
[1:36:26] speaking yet, and he said, thou canst
[1:36:28] not see my face, for there shall no man
[1:36:32] see me and live." God knew what Moses
[1:36:36] was asking.
[1:36:38] Even though all of this has happened and
[1:36:40] you've been so merciful to us,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; let me see your glory.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Let me have I've seen all the miracles.
[1:36:51] I've seen all the supernatural
[1:36:54] and I've experienced it in my life, but
[1:36:57] let me see your glory. And at the level
[1:37:00] that Moses was speaking, God knew what
[1:37:03] he was asking. He said, "You can't see
[1:37:05] my face.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; My presence will go with you." In other
[1:37:10] words, we have in the Bible the the
[1:37:14] angel of the Lord, which was a very
[1:37:17] angel of his presence. And God appeared
[1:37:21] to Gideon and and to Monoah and others.
[1:37:25] He appeared as the angel of the Lord.
[1:37:28] That was the one that was God coming as
[1:37:32] close as he could come. Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And God had come as close as he could
[1:37:37] come to Moses, but Moses wanted him to
[1:37:41] transcend even further.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let me see your glory.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I want to see your face.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; I've heard you speak.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; I've heard your voice.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I've done all these things and all these
[1:37:57] people. And he he was overburdened with
[1:37:59] them. I I've heard it and I've I
[1:38:02] followed it and I went out and I felt
[1:38:04] your presence and seen your miracles and
[1:38:07] I want to see you.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; So, you can't see my face. That's what
[1:38:14] Job wanted. He wanted to go up to like
[1:38:17] brother Brandham said, he wanted to go
[1:38:18] up to God's door and knock on his door
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and have God answer. And I if I could
[1:38:24] see a if I could have someone come and
[1:38:26] and speak to me and I want to see him.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; That's always been that's in our heart.
[1:38:33] I tell you what, friends, I I don't want
[1:38:35] this veil of flesh here forever.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And when it drops, I want to be sure I
[1:38:40] enter in his presence.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, just imagine the
[1:38:44] life that he lived, the multitudes he
[1:38:46] saw healed, the names he called,
[1:38:49] supernatural that happened. And then
[1:38:51] when he sees his body sitting there in
[1:38:53] the bed 20 feet away from him and a
[1:38:56] voice is telling him and he's seeing
[1:38:58] millions and he tells me himself he says
[1:39:00] I I pinched my hand I bit my finger I I
[1:39:04] held those people friend said I held
[1:39:07] those people and he saw them in that
[1:39:10] glorious state.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; What come out of his mouth?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's still something
[1:39:19] missing.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And even if we crossed over today, all
[1:39:22] of us, it would be a glorious thing. But
[1:39:25] there's something still in that seed
[1:39:27] that is not satisfied yet. I want to see
[1:39:31] Jesus.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I want to see him. I want to see that
[1:39:36] perfect manifestation of the invisible
[1:39:39] God. It's not enough. It's not enough
[1:39:43] just to have healings. It's not enough
[1:39:44] just to have miracles. It's not enough
[1:39:46] just to have a a sweep come over me and
[1:39:48] be moved of God. I want to see him.
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; That's the real name of God.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Who that person was
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; and who he is. And that is why we come
[1:40:08] right down into this generation
[1:40:12] and we hear that message
[1:40:15] sometimes it comes so harsh and so
[1:40:18] cutting and in birth pains. He says he
[1:40:21] said I love people.
[1:40:25] He said I don't hate people. I love
[1:40:27] people.
[1:40:29] He said I wish I wish
[1:40:32] this message wasn't mine to give.
[1:40:37] That was William Brandham speaking. I
[1:40:40] wish this message wasn't mine to give.
[1:40:43] But he said, "I have a message from
[1:40:45] God."
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; I have to give it.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the
[1:40:49] Lord, you have a life to live.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And that life is is what God has brought
[1:40:54] put down into his seed. And from his
[1:40:58] seed, his spirit come upon that seed.
[1:41:01] Hallelujah. His word came to that seed.
[1:41:04] His word is that seed. And now you have
[1:41:07] a life to live. And you are the you are
[1:41:10] the lamb's wife.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; And that is your real true name.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're Mrs. Jesus.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Not Cloverdale by the way. Mrs. Jesus.
[1:41:27] Hallelujah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:40] Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:55] God changed Jacob's name, which we know,
[1:41:57] to Israel. And then Jacob
[1:42:01] just he had
[1:42:04] this wrestling he had with a man with
[1:42:06] the angel.
[1:42:09] This what he says. And Jacob asked him
[1:42:12] and said, "Tell me, I pray thee, what is
[1:42:17] your name?"
[1:42:19] They've been wrestling all night. It's
[1:42:21] getting to the break of the day. Says,
[1:42:23] "What is your name?"
[1:42:27] And he said, "Wherefore is it that you
[1:42:30] ask me for my name?"
[1:42:34] And at that point, he asked him, "What's
[1:42:36] your name?" Oh, the way you wrestle, the
[1:42:38] way you fight, and the way, "Hey, I want
[1:42:41] to know your name." At that moment, and
[1:42:43] he blessed him there.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; He got to a special spot.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to one that goes the other
[1:42:53] direction.
[1:42:55] And the word of the Lord came to Hosea
[1:42:58] the prophet.
[1:43:00] And the Lord said to Hosea, "Go
[1:43:03] and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms,
[1:43:06] a harlot to wife."
[1:43:10] How many people do you think of Israel
[1:43:11] understood that one?
[1:43:15] And I can say if you were living there
[1:43:18] and myself also I doubt if any of us
[1:43:20] would understand that
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; a prophet and he takes a a woman who's a
[1:43:27] harlot to wife
[1:43:30] and children of whoredoms for the land
[1:43:34] hath committed great whoredom departing
[1:43:36] from the Lord. The land and the people
[1:43:38] have departed from the Lord. And now
[1:43:42] says he wanted something living
[1:43:45] right amongst them,
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; living out,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; but he wanted them with a certain name
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; so that Israel would know what it is
[1:43:55] they were doing and God's new
[1:43:58] relationship with them would be
[1:44:00] expressed in that name. And uh and so he
[1:44:04] went and he took Goomer
[1:44:07] to wife and she conceived and bare a
[1:44:09] son. And now it wasn't wasn't Hosea and
[1:44:12] it wasn't Goomemer who said what we'll
[1:44:15] call him. And the Lord said unto him,
[1:44:18] "Call his name Jezrael."
[1:44:21] That is God
[1:44:23] sws.
[1:44:25] God sws. God is sowing a seed. Now God's
[1:44:31] going to bring something forth and call
[1:44:33] his name Jezrael for yet a little while
[1:44:36] and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael
[1:44:39] upon the house of Jahu and will cause to
[1:44:42] cease the kingdom of the house of
[1:44:44] Israel. Something's going to happen now.
[1:44:46] Something's beginning. And this is a
[1:44:48] natural conception of a natural seed.
[1:44:51] But God gave him a name because God was
[1:44:54] sewing it.
[1:44:56] And it came to pass
[1:44:59] uh that I'm sorry and she conceived
[1:45:02] again and bare a daughter. And God said
[1:45:05] unto him, call her name
[1:45:09] Lorama.
[1:45:11] Lorama,
[1:45:13] no mercy.
[1:45:15] God sws.
[1:45:17] Now this one is conceived. A daughter
[1:45:19] comes and say now no mercy.
[1:45:24] and she conceived again and bare a
[1:45:26] daughter. And God said, "Call her name
[1:45:29] Loruma and then and I will no more have
[1:45:33] mercy upon the house of Israel. I will
[1:45:36] utterly uh take them away."
[1:45:40] And and when she had weaned Loruma, she
[1:45:43] conceived and bare a son. And then said,
[1:45:47] "God, call his name Lo Ami. Lo, am I not
[1:45:52] my people? For ye are not my people, and
[1:45:57] I will not be your God. So now God has,
[1:46:01] get the picture, God has in the earth,
[1:46:04] three young people,
[1:46:06] three children.
[1:46:08] Oh, the prophet Hosea has some children.
[1:46:12] Yes. This one's Jezrael. God sws. This
[1:46:16] is Lo
[1:46:18] Auma.
[1:46:21] No mercy.
[1:46:24] And this one is low army,
[1:46:28] not my people.
[1:46:30] And those children walked through life,
[1:46:33] God sws, no mercy, not my people. Not my
[1:46:38] people. Everywhere they went in life,
[1:46:41] Israel was reminded God. And Hosea says,
[1:46:46] God said, that's their name. God said
[1:46:50] it's no mercy. Not me. God said it. And
[1:46:54] God said not my people. And that's what
[1:46:57] God had. He established it in the land.
[1:47:00] And now he had lives that were being
[1:47:01] lived out. Not my people. Not my people.
[1:47:04] Not my people. Every time their name
[1:47:06] sounded, it was not my people. No mercy.
[1:47:10] No mercy. Not my people. I tell you, God
[1:47:13] emphasized.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. what he was saying
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[1:47:20] And then
[1:47:27] quite frankly, I love this chapter. It
[1:47:31] sounds harsh, but you have to read the
[1:47:35] Bible. You have to read the scripture.
[1:47:38] And he goes on to say,
[1:47:42] "Therefore,
[1:47:44] behold,
[1:47:46] I will allure her and bring her into the
[1:47:49] wilderness and speak comfortably to
[1:47:51] her." Now, he's already established by
[1:47:55] the names of these three children what
[1:47:58] his relationship was. Are you following
[1:48:00] me?
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; What his relationship was with Israel.
[1:48:05] And I will and I will give her vineyards
[1:48:09] from thence and the valley of Acor for a
[1:48:12] door of hope. And she shall sing there
[1:48:15] as in the days of her youth as as in the
[1:48:18] day when she came up out of the land of
[1:48:20] Egypt. Now God's going back to the to
[1:48:23] the great deliverance he wrought and
[1:48:25] he's bringing it forward. Even though he
[1:48:27] has delivered his message and has let
[1:48:30] them know where they are, yet he's now
[1:48:32] he's telling them that they're his
[1:48:34] people. And it shall and it shall be in
[1:48:37] that day, say the Lord, that thou shalt
[1:48:39] call me ish
[1:48:42] husband,
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; and shalt call me no more Bali, which is
[1:48:49] my Lord.
[1:48:50] This is going to be some I'm going to do
[1:48:52] something in the land. I've let you know
[1:48:55] now that I've cut you off and I've swn
[1:48:58] this in the amongst you and I've
[1:49:00] expressed your your relationship with
[1:49:03] me. But now he goes and he says, "For I
[1:49:06] will take away the names of Bal Balum
[1:49:10] out of her mouth, and they shall no more
[1:49:13] be remembered by their name."
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he goes on to say, "And
[1:49:20] I will betro thee unto me forever." Yay,
[1:49:24] I will betro thee unto me in
[1:49:26] righteousness and in judgment and in
[1:49:29] loving kindness and in mercies.
[1:49:32] Hallelujah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; As he said to Jeremiah, "Can a man
[1:49:36] forget his wife? I can't forget her even
[1:49:39] though I have to I have to bring
[1:49:41] judgment down. I have to say it the way
[1:49:43] it is. I have to express it." See, he
[1:49:46] couldn't get their attention. Right.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; So he had a prophet marry a harlot and
[1:49:52] bring forth three children of harlotry
[1:49:55] from that uh three children of whoredoms
[1:49:57] it is and God sews God was sewing
[1:50:01] something else into the land. You
[1:50:03] understand how the names have such a
[1:50:05] significance. All right. I hope that
[1:50:08] you're able to follow me.
[1:50:13] And this was this was so significant
[1:50:17] because God was uh he was establishing
[1:50:21] his relationship or what that
[1:50:23] relationship was with the people.
[1:50:32] And Monoah
[1:50:34] I just I want to take a few more minutes
[1:50:35] now. That be all right with you. And
[1:50:38] Monoah said unto the angel the unto the
[1:50:41] angel of the Lord, "What is thy name?"
[1:50:44] And when and that when thy sayings
[1:50:48] come to pass, we may do thee honor. And
[1:50:51] the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why
[1:50:54] ask
[1:50:55] thou thus after my name, seeing it is
[1:50:58] secret? Or the word secret wi-i which is
[1:51:02] uh palei it is why ask my name because
[1:51:05] it is it is wonderful or it is too
[1:51:08] wonderful. Why ask my name? Because it's
[1:51:11] incomprehensible.
[1:51:13] It's extraordinary.
[1:51:15] And so it it's something that couldn't
[1:51:17] even be spoken. So why do you ask my
[1:51:20] name? And he told him and the angel of
[1:51:23] the Lord said unto him, why ask thou my
[1:51:25] name seeing it a secret? and Monoah he
[1:51:28] he had wanted to know his name. Now
[1:51:35] just to take you back for a moment now
[1:51:37] just hold this please. I'm I'm going to
[1:51:38] be a few minutes yet.
[1:51:41] We hear new things
[1:51:45] about about God in the book of in the
[1:51:49] book of Exodus because God now has at
[1:51:54] for the first time a prophet through
[1:51:57] whom he can manifest or reveal himself
[1:52:02] a part of God's expression. In other
[1:52:05] words, we see God expressing himself in
[1:52:08] just hold this please. I want you to be
[1:52:11] real alert. We hear new things and uh
[1:52:15] and things that we have not uh and thing
[1:52:19] things about God that we have not heard
[1:52:21] of before. We hear it in Exodus because
[1:52:25] because
[1:52:26] there's a prophet. So I'm saying that
[1:52:29] God can reveal himself or show who he is
[1:52:32] through a prophet which he cannot do in
[1:52:36] any other way.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; All right. Right?
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; So between Malachi and Matthew, we don't
[1:52:42] find any great expression of God because
[1:52:44] there was no prophet.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; You understand? All right. Now, so in
[1:52:49] Exodus, I I I I need to establish this
[1:52:51] for a very important point. In Exodus,
[1:52:54] God is speaking. He said, "I appeared
[1:52:58] unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob
[1:53:01] by the name of God Almighty,
[1:53:06] but by my name Jehovah,
[1:53:09] was I not known to them."
[1:53:13] What's he saying? I manifested. I did
[1:53:17] certain things. I showed
[1:53:20] a certain uh characteristic of myself. I
[1:53:24] showed it to Abraham and to Isaac and to
[1:53:28] Jacob. And they knew me by the name of
[1:53:30] God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah
[1:53:36] was I not known. And by God Almighty.
[1:53:41] Say Shadi, which is not right. And even
[1:53:43] Shadai is not right. But I'll just say
[1:53:46] Shadai. So they knew me by Shai which is
[1:53:50] the almighty
[1:53:52] of God and that's what they knew him. L
[1:53:56] is God and Shadai is almighty. So they
[1:53:59] knew me. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew
[1:54:03] me by Shai,
[1:54:07] God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah.
[1:54:13] They knew me not. They didn't know me by
[1:54:15] Jehovah. And Jehovah is the existing
[1:54:19] one. So now
[1:54:23] God is saying to Moses, they knew me as
[1:54:27] God. El Shadai, God Almighty. They knew
[1:54:31] me as God Almighty. In other words, he's
[1:54:33] a God, but now they did not know me as a
[1:54:38] self-existing one.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; And I want to reveal myself now
[1:54:44] differently. But he could not do so
[1:54:47] without a prophet messenger to the
[1:54:49] people. So he had to have that prophet
[1:54:53] to reveal himself by a new name.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And now I'm Jehovah,
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; the existing one.
[1:55:01] He he was now in the process of
[1:55:04] unveiling himself to the people in a
[1:55:06] different way. And he says, "Thou shalt
[1:55:09] take," Exodus 27, "and thou shalt take
[1:55:11] the name of the Lord God. Thou shalt not
[1:55:14] take the name of the Lord thy God in
[1:55:17] vain. For the Lord will not hold him
[1:55:19] guiltless. Thou shalt not take it in
[1:55:22] vain. Or you shall not take the name
[1:55:24] upon yourself in emptiness or in
[1:55:28] falsehood or an emptiness of speech or
[1:55:32] lying. Oh, I tell you what, folks.
[1:55:34] You're quiet, but I tell you what, I
[1:55:36] feel like preaching.
[1:55:39] That is what the church world, excuse
[1:55:41] me, is full of today. Have taken the
[1:55:45] name of God in vain. It's full of
[1:55:48] emptiness. It's full of vanity. It's
[1:55:52] full of showmanship.
[1:55:54] It's full of all kinds of holy wood.
[1:55:57] It's perverted. And God has seen that.
[1:56:00] And no wonder he had to send a prophet
[1:56:03] messenger to reveal what his real name
[1:56:05] was.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; In the kind of life that it should be
[1:56:09] lived.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; This message is not just a message. This
[1:56:18] message is not just a few doctrines.
[1:56:20] This message is not a bunch of message
[1:56:22] churches. This message is a life
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; that come from almighty God.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:29] Hallelujah. I said, I'm giving praise
[1:56:32] and glory to the name of God. This
[1:56:35] message is a life
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and you have a right to that life.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And do you and I deny every devil that
[1:56:42] tries to tell you, you can't live that
[1:56:44] life. You can live the life because I
[1:56:46] can tell you right now, there's
[1:56:48] something down inside that's calling out
[1:56:50] for it. Hallelujah. That's your real
[1:56:53] name.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; That's your real name. Hallelujah.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; That's your real character.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; That's the real you. That's the one God
[1:57:02] knows.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; You can just say, "I have that desire. I
[1:57:07] have that yearning. I don't see it
[1:57:09] manifest, but I have that desire. It's
[1:57:11] down in there." I tell you that came
[1:57:14] from God.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; And I would encourage you this morning,
[1:57:17] deny every other restraint, every other
[1:57:21] doubt. Tell the devil he is a liar in
[1:57:25] the name of Jesus Christ. You tell him
[1:57:27] he's a liar.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; He'll try to tell you he won't succeed.
[1:57:31] He'll try to tell you you're going to
[1:57:33] die in the next little while. Just say
[1:57:35] irrespective of that, I'm going to give
[1:57:38] my life unreservedly to God.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] in the day that we're in. I've got to
[1:58:16] I've got to cut it short. I'm just very
[1:58:19] That's what I'm thinking about here.
[1:58:21] Just how short I'm going to cut it.
[1:58:31] Notice the angel.
[1:58:33] Exodus 23 and 20. Behold, I sent an
[1:58:37] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:58:38] way, and to bring thee into the place
[1:58:40] which I have prepared. Beware of him.
[1:58:43] Obey his voice. Provoke him not for he
[1:58:46] will not pardon your transgressions for
[1:58:49] my name is in him.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel said certain
[1:58:57] phraseology or some kind of phrase to
[1:58:59] the people but the manifestation
[1:59:03] of the very life of God is in him.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; God's life would be lived through him.
[1:59:13] That is why you understand I'm I'm I
[1:59:15] I've just got to come to a certain point
[1:59:16] here. That is why you understand the
[1:59:19] prophet standing here. He wouldn't have
[1:59:21] been a prophet if he didn't act the way
[1:59:23] that he did and then he said, "I can't
[1:59:25] do anything.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; I can't do anything. I'm just a man. I'm
[1:59:29] your brother. I can't do anything till
[1:59:31] he comes."
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; But when he came, the angel of the Lord,
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the name of God is in him.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; The manifestation of God was in him. And
[1:59:42] soon as he came, then people were called
[1:59:45] out and you've got a liver disease and
[1:59:48] you have this and you come from a
[1:59:50] certain address. Who was that?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; That was God himself living out his
[1:59:56] life. The angel of the Lord, his name
[1:59:59] was in him and he's speaking through the
[2:00:01] mouth of a man so that our eard drums
[2:00:03] could catch it. And you can hear it on
[2:00:05] the tape. And we're not in history. That
[2:00:07] is the message you've been born under.
[2:00:09] We've been born under a name.
[2:00:12] Hallelujah. The name of God.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; People can say I'm a Jehovah's Witness.
[2:00:16] Someone else can say Adonai or all these
[2:00:19] other phrases and it doesn't mean a
[2:00:21] thing.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord doesn't
[2:00:24] mean a thing.
[2:00:26] Yes, sir.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; That we can utter certain utterances.
[2:00:30] That's not what it is. It's something
[2:00:32] divine that comes from God into the
[2:00:35] individual and they walk out a
[2:00:38] transformed new creature in Christ Jesus
[2:00:42] and old things have passed away. Listen
[2:00:45] young man, it isn't something that you
[2:00:47] wrestle with today and tomorrow and
[2:00:49] tomorrow. And young ladies are living on
[2:00:50] the edge all the time. Living on the
[2:00:52] edge, a little bit of the world, a
[2:00:53] little bit of church, a little bit. It
[2:00:55] has nothing to do with that. Old things
[2:00:57] pass away.
[2:01:01] Let's say that old things pass away and
[2:01:06] behold all things become new.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Why? It's a new man.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; It's a new woman
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; with a new name.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; And you're changed.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; You're changed forever
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; and ever and ever.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; And the devil will never catch up to
[2:01:28] you.
[2:01:29] He'll never get in where you're sealed.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; He'd have to be born again himself and
[2:01:34] then the prophet said he'd be your
[2:01:35] brother. The devil can never get in
[2:01:38] where you're at.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil credit for stuff he
[2:01:41] can't even do.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil the devil. Who cares about
[2:01:48] the devil? He's defeated. His head is
[2:01:50] crushed. He is a helpless. He's a
[2:01:53] helpless creature. He can only do what
[2:01:55] God allows him to do
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We call
[2:02:00] that name because we know something of
[2:02:02] the power of that name.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; We're living the life of that name.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord. Now, I want
[2:02:14] you to just get a key point and I'm
[2:02:15] going to close. the angel of the Lord in
[2:02:18] in Exodus. They didn't have it prior to
[2:02:22] that in the same fashion. But now that
[2:02:26] God had a prophet,
[2:02:30] the pillar of fire came in the first
[2:02:33] Exodus
[2:02:35] and that was and it's agreed in the uh
[2:02:39] in in the me message that brother
[2:02:41] Brandham has given that was the
[2:02:44] condescending
[2:02:45] of God and he would come thus far. So he
[2:02:50] said to Moses, "Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:02:53] Jacob knew me as Adoni.
[2:02:56] But now I'm going to advance forward.
[2:03:00] They didn't know me as Jehovah, the
[2:03:02] self-existing one, but I want to reveal
[2:03:05] that
[2:03:08] now." Prophet said that was as
[2:03:10] condescending. He's coming down.
[2:03:14] Then he came down
[2:03:16] further.
[2:03:18] He came down condescended and came into
[2:03:20] a man
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; that who the world will remember his
[2:03:25] birth in a few days but know nothing
[2:03:27] about his birth and they called him
[2:03:29] Jesus Christ.
[2:03:31] Jesus the invisible God in flesh
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; and he condescended down further and
[2:03:39] even in that condescension
[2:03:41] down our hands have handled him. The
[2:03:44] prophet said, the apostle said, and uh
[2:03:48] and and we we handled him and we heard
[2:03:50] him, we saw him, and yet multitudes,
[2:03:54] most couldn't believe on him.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Most rejected him, the perfect lamb of
[2:04:01] God, bearing the name that came out of
[2:04:03] the lips of an angel. Thou shalt call
[2:04:06] his name Jesus, for he shall save his
[2:04:09] people from their sins. But it was a
[2:04:11] condescending of God. But then he says,
[2:04:13] "I have many things yet to tell you, but
[2:04:16] you can't bear them now. But when the
[2:04:19] Holy Spirit has come, he will lead you
[2:04:22] and show you into these things." And
[2:04:24] then now we come 2,000 years down the
[2:04:26] road, and there's been times of times
[2:04:30] between Malachi and Matthew, no prophet.
[2:04:33] God wasn't revealing himself at all.
[2:04:35] Then comes the Elijah spirit and John
[2:04:37] the Baptist crying out, and they knew he
[2:04:40] was a prophet from God. Then comes the
[2:04:42] Messiah right behind him and he
[2:04:44] introduces him. And then comes the
[2:04:46] apostles and the birth of the church and
[2:04:48] 2,000 years further down the road. And
[2:04:51] after 2,000 years a reformers and dark
[2:04:55] ages and all of these things that are
[2:04:57] happening and the scriptures unfolding
[2:04:59] unfolding and it come to the end time
[2:05:01] and there is a promise that'll come a
[2:05:05] messenger,
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; a forerunner
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; and what is it? And beside him never has
[2:05:12] happened,
[2:05:14] never has happened but in our day.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And the pillar of fire, the angel of the
[2:05:21] Lord
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; is now standing beside a man
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; and in the in birth pains he said when
[2:05:27] he was done finally done said that man
[2:05:30] with his head down you're praying. He
[2:05:33] starts telling him that boy uh uh
[2:05:37] brownskinned boy you're a Mexican and
[2:05:40] tells him your name's your daddy's a
[2:05:42] preacher and your name is Reuben. And
[2:05:43] when he's done all of that he stops says
[2:05:47] who can do that
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Who can do that?
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I'm just a man. Who can do that?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Trying to say don't be blind.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. It's God
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; descending
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; right here on the platform
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; and sitting behind him and sitting all
[2:06:12] across the table city are are
[2:06:14] theologians and great wealthy men and
[2:06:17] businessmen and the and they were men of
[2:06:20] renown
[2:06:21] and the scripture speaks of men of
[2:06:23] renown and then and and always in the
[2:06:26] negative sense never was men of renown
[2:06:30] In the good sense, it was men of renown
[2:06:33] in the days of in the days of Noah when
[2:06:36] violence filled the earth, but they had
[2:06:38] an earth full of men of renown. And then
[2:06:40] and renown is men of the name. Men have
[2:06:44] achieved great names and status on
[2:06:46] earth. And we got great presidents and
[2:06:49] kings and all kinds of things, but we
[2:06:51] got an earth that's corrupted.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Is that not so? We've got men renown. We
[2:06:59] got all kinds of stars, movie stars, and
[2:07:02] sports stars and men of renown and
[2:07:05] beautiful women and me and men and women
[2:07:08] of renown whose names you identify right
[2:07:10] away.
[2:07:12] I tell you what, friends, there's a
[2:07:15] people that have received another name.
[2:07:18] They've received another life. And thou
[2:07:21] shalt be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:24] You're going to live a different life
[2:07:25] because there's a different seed that's
[2:07:27] in you. you are a different people. Not
[2:07:29] because I'm saying it, not because I
[2:07:31] want you to feel good. That's the truth
[2:07:33] of God's word. If there isn't a people
[2:07:35] of that category, if there isn't a
[2:07:37] people of that status, Jesus died in
[2:07:39] vain. But I says he died to redeem his
[2:07:42] own. He died that he might have a bride,
[2:07:45] a pure, spotless bride. And I say she is
[2:07:49] here.
[2:07:52] And thy name shall be called bride, for
[2:07:54] thou shalt live the life the life of the
[2:07:57] bride.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; And I with this I'll close. He said,
[2:08:09] "Now watch the love of God
[2:08:14] in the message inner man."
[2:08:18] When the people said to Moses, "Don't
[2:08:20] speak.
[2:08:21] Let God speak." He says, "Now watch the
[2:08:23] love of God." And that ought to make you
[2:08:26] start praying for revival. God
[2:08:29] condescending,
[2:08:31] coming down, unfolding himself. Then God
[2:08:35] appeared there in a pillar of fire. Then
[2:08:37] the next time he appeared in a visible
[2:08:39] form was when he appeared in his son
[2:08:41] Jesus Christ. He overshadowed a virgin,
[2:08:44] created a blood cell in her womb, and
[2:08:47] brought forth a son of God. And God was
[2:08:50] in Christ reconciling the world to
[2:08:52] himself. In the message redemption by
[2:08:55] power, he said, "I know that God has
[2:08:57] condescended coming down from glory and
[2:09:00] standing in this building." Now, that
[2:09:03] was at that moment. And further in
[2:09:06] redemption, he said, "What is it?" He
[2:09:10] said he suffered as a man and was
[2:09:11] tempted and so on. What was it? It was a
[2:09:14] condescending of God and Abraham
[2:09:17] restored the message. He said what's he
[2:09:19] doing? God's condescending
[2:09:22] trying to draw near to his people so he
[2:09:26] can be loved and be worshiped. And in
[2:09:29] statue of a perfect man, I want to say
[2:09:31] that's what he's trying to do even this
[2:09:33] morning. He wants to he wants to
[2:09:36] condescend even further down. I'm not a
[2:09:38] prophet nor the son of a prophet, but
[2:09:40] I've been set here as a minister to
[2:09:42] minister to the people. You have been
[2:09:44] set. You have been called,
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; have you not?
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; You've been called
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; by a name.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And that name no man knows. You know it.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Because you you yourself are the only
[2:09:56] one that can testify and say something
[2:09:58] got a hold of me.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't an emotion. You
[2:10:02] didn't come here to get a boyfriend, to
[2:10:04] get a girlfriend, to get a husband, to
[2:10:06] get a wife. You didn't come here to get
[2:10:07] a better job, better position or
[2:10:09] something else. You came here because
[2:10:10] you heard a voice.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, people go to all kinds
[2:10:14] of churches. You might say, and right
[2:10:16] away, Satan might say in your mind,
[2:10:18] people come to all kinds of churches and
[2:10:19] say the same thing. I felt a pull. I
[2:10:21] heard a call. All the rest of it, and
[2:10:23] what they heard was the call of that
[2:10:25] church, the call of that place, the call
[2:10:27] of this society, the call of this club,
[2:10:29] whatever it is. The Quanis and the Lions
[2:10:32] and all the rest of them, they have some
[2:10:33] desire. It's some natural desire. But in
[2:10:36] this in this church and amongst message
[2:10:39] believers, it's it's not the call of the
[2:10:41] church. We haven't got a headquarters.
[2:10:44] And it and it's not me. I wouldn't even
[2:10:46] have a message if we didn't have the
[2:10:48] message. This is from the message. And
[2:10:50] you've been called. You heard a tape.
[2:10:52] You read a book. You read a scripture
[2:10:54] and the Holy Spirit inspired you. What
[2:10:56] am I saying? I'm saying unequivocally,
[2:10:59] you heard a call. And that call was God
[2:11:02] calling your name. your specific name.
[2:11:06] And it's a lot better than even saying
[2:11:08] Moses, Moses, Samuel, Samuel, Ed, Ed,
[2:11:10] Bill, Bill, Joe, Joe, Mary, Mary, Susie,
[2:11:13] Susie. It's a lot better than that.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz that name is not the your full. You
[2:11:20] say, "Oh, if I could only be a different
[2:11:22] person. If I could that seed that's in
[2:11:24] you, God by his spirit coming to that
[2:11:28] seed that's in you." You've heard it
[2:11:30] before, but I'm saying it now
[2:11:31] emphatically.
[2:11:33] That's the name God called you by. He
[2:11:36] put something in there and that seed in
[2:11:38] there knows the voice of its master.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; When he said to you, "Come."
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, the flesh may be fought and your
[2:11:49] mind reasoned and everything else
[2:11:51] happened, but he kept calling your name.
[2:11:54] He kept calling your name till finally
[2:11:56] you said, "Oh, yay, Lord. Here I come.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; It's me."
[2:12:02] It's
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; precisely me.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; And God in this day, let me conclude.
[2:12:08] God in this day has condescended. He's
[2:12:10] condescending. Coming down, coming down.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; The purpose of which is to make known
[2:12:19] God's name.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; And when you know him, he he did not
[2:12:24] listen. Listen close now. Before the
[2:12:27] seals were opened, the seals have
[2:12:30] manifested many, many things and the
[2:12:33] message has unfolded many things. Prior
[2:12:35] to that opening, we could say prior to
[2:12:39] this,
[2:12:40] the reformers, the apostles and so on,
[2:12:45] they only knew God at the level as God
[2:12:49] said Abraham, Isaac, Jacob only knew me
[2:12:51] as Adonai.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; They only knew me that far because
[2:12:54] that's as far as he revealed himself.
[2:12:56] And all the reformers and all those
[2:12:58] prior to this age knew God only as he
[2:13:02] revealed himself up to that time. And
[2:13:04] he's only can be known when he reveals
[2:13:06] himself. Then they see God in a new
[2:13:09] light.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Because because then they see God's
[2:13:12] works. And that is God's name.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; It's nothing that we praise with our
[2:13:17] lips. But when we start to give honor to
[2:13:19] God, we heap honor on his head. The God
[2:13:22] that is doing these things. Hallelujah.
[2:13:25] Hallelujah. I'm glad he opened my eyes.
[2:13:28] Brother Burkhart, I'm glad he opened my
[2:13:30] eyes. I could go out of this world
[2:13:32] thanking God I saw false anointed ones.
[2:13:35] I'd be in a I'd be in a terrible trap if
[2:13:38] he had not revealed himself to me and
[2:13:40] showed me false anointed ones. I'm so
[2:13:42] glad he showed me the serpent's seed.
[2:13:44] How that explains so many things. The
[2:13:47] seed, the sin that was in the beginning.
[2:13:49] I'm thankful to God he showed me that.
[2:13:52] Oh my people, my people, I say to you,
[2:13:54] God made himself known to this little
[2:13:57] fellow here. And God has made himself
[2:13:59] known to you.
[2:14:01] Hallelujah.
[2:14:03] So that you can live the kind of life
[2:14:05] he's ordained you to live in this world.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; The name you have doesn't suit that
[2:14:12] life. The name you have on earth, the
[2:14:14] bomb your parents give you, doesn't suit
[2:14:16] that. God's got another name for you.
[2:14:19] And I don't know how it'll sound, but
[2:14:22] someday somebody will say it. But I know
[2:14:24] one thing. I have that name.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; God's called me by that name. And it is
[2:14:29] a new name that fits the new man. I can
[2:14:32] tell you Ed Biscll doesn't fit the new
[2:14:34] man. Ed Bis fits a man that's full of
[2:14:36] all kinds of faults and all kinds of
[2:14:39] troubles and weaknesses and so on. That
[2:14:41] doesn't fit that kind of man. I'm not
[2:14:43] interested in in a name on the earth.
[2:14:45] I'm not interested in a name of renown.
[2:14:47] I'm interested in a name that God can
[2:14:49] call and a son can say, "It is me, Lord.
[2:14:53] It is me. You're speaking to me."
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; I'm so I'm so thankful and worshiping
[2:15:03] this morning that God has condescended
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; right down to where I am.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:13] You've been a patient people. And I
[2:15:15] would like to have would like to have
[2:15:17] even gone on, but I'm going to just
[2:15:18] close now. I've been much longer than I
[2:15:20] expected to be.
[2:15:22] Oh my
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; I hope you can tie the things together.
[2:15:28] You can see now while Brother Brandham
[2:15:31] at the at this last messenger had to
[2:15:33] say, you know, well, if they're Ricky or
[2:15:36] whatever, I'd change their name
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; cuz he's telling us and showing us that
[2:15:41] the name has significance
[2:15:44] and that the world knows it. And they've
[2:15:46] got all kinds of Elvises and whatever
[2:15:49] more. They've got all kinds of flooy
[2:15:52] names for this perverted generation. But
[2:15:55] God God is making us aware because even
[2:15:59] the name I mean it's so powerful the
[2:16:02] name of Graham
[2:16:04] Branham
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Abraham when you line those up there
[2:16:10] never has been and God God
[2:16:13] listen maybe you never saw this before
[2:16:15] God just chooses two men that okay one
[2:16:19] of you you'll go to the world at large
[2:16:23] you're a messenger.
[2:16:25] You're going to stay at Abraham's group
[2:16:27] and for myself I'm going to turn back to
[2:16:29] Israel.
[2:16:34] It's all the same time.
[2:16:36] Last part of 4748
[2:16:39] and 48 becomes a nation. God's got his
[2:16:42] attention on Israel. And here goes
[2:16:44] another one out to the world. Becomes
[2:16:46] popular and he's he's with the king.
[2:16:48] He's with the kings and he's with
[2:16:50] presidents and he becomes the
[2:16:51] president's evangelist and and he's
[2:16:53] filling stadiums and all the rest of it.
[2:16:55] And another one's back here.
[2:16:59] He's like the one that stayed with
[2:17:00] Abraham,
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; saying, "Well, the secret of your heart
[2:17:03] is this." And and and and the miracles
[2:17:06] are happening. And the crippled
[2:17:08] children, some of the first, begin to
[2:17:11] straighten out. And the attention of the
[2:17:13] people is gotten. And it's a different
[2:17:16] kind of a group of people that's being
[2:17:17] gotten over here. And it's another group
[2:17:20] of people over here. And Israel is being
[2:17:23] and to this one here, they're seeing God
[2:17:25] in a completely different capacity. God
[2:17:28] doing different things. So, we've never
[2:17:30] seen this before. We've never seen this
[2:17:32] in 2,000 years. This this is different.
[2:17:36] And people looked at it and watched it.
[2:17:38] And then pretty soon,
[2:17:40] pretty soon it was more than just signs
[2:17:42] and wonders. More than just a man called
[2:17:45] William Brham. now now starts coming out
[2:17:48] of his mouth things that made the Bible
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; come alive.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; But in this 2,000 years so many had
[2:17:57] established themselves completely
[2:18:00] established themselves and said that God
[2:18:03] is three and God is this and hell is
[2:18:07] eternal and all of these things. And he
[2:18:08] got all these doctrine sent out all
[2:18:10] these thousands of missionaries all over
[2:18:12] the world with their doctrine. And so
[2:18:15] now here comes a man says,
[2:18:18] "If what I've just said is the truth,
[2:18:22] let the God
[2:18:24] who said it now come and prove it."
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; And God proves it.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; How could they love him for it? They
[2:18:30] couldn't. Says, "It's against our
[2:18:32] theory. It's against our doctrine. It's
[2:18:34] against our church. It's against our
[2:18:36] headquarters. It's against everything we
[2:18:37] stand for. We can't. He's a nice man.
[2:18:40] But don't believe what he says."
[2:18:43] say. And really what he was doing was
[2:18:47] he was just coming for a small group of
[2:18:48] people.
[2:18:51] Small group of people.
[2:18:54] And what he was saying is
[2:18:58] this is your bridegroom.
[2:19:00] This is your bridegroom.
[2:19:03] This is what he's really like.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; They think they know him, but that's not
[2:19:07] him. This is him.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying?
[2:19:13] And furthermore, I can prove it because
[2:19:16] he's condescended right now. He's right
[2:19:17] beside me. He's standing here wanting me
[2:19:19] to tell you this.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; How could we miss it?
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand, shall we?
[2:19:36] I thank you for your time and kindness
[2:19:39] to tell you, you know, it's so different
[2:19:40] for me. It's hard sometimes hard to get
[2:19:43] started and hard to hard to quit. I
[2:19:46] thank you for your patience and I trust
[2:19:48] that it'll really be something you can
[2:19:50] ponder and meditate on. These messages
[2:19:53] have recently been very very difficult
[2:19:56] difficult for me. Very difficult. And uh
[2:19:59] I'd like I'd like you to understand that
[2:20:01] it's just been real real difficult
[2:20:03] studying. And it's it's like it's I
[2:20:07] don't know whether Satan is fighting it
[2:20:08] or what it is, but I'd appreciate your
[2:20:10] prayers and pray. Listen, friends, we
[2:20:13] don't want to stay where we have been.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; We want to we want to be moving on up
[2:20:18] there.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; And I want to you to go this from this
[2:20:23] sanctuary this morning realizing
[2:20:26] number one, the only reason you're here
[2:20:28] is because you heard God call your name.
[2:20:31] Call your name. And then when you begin
[2:20:34] to see supernaturally those things as
[2:20:38] the word begin to open up really that's
[2:20:41] your name,
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; That's what you're saying. You're seeing
[2:20:44] your name and and you got to get
[2:20:47] completely away from it that it has a
[2:20:49] certain phonetic sound.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; It's not a sound at all. Thou shalt call
[2:20:54] his name Jesus. For
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; you heard my call because I know you by
[2:21:00] name. I've called your name. That's why
[2:21:03] you responded. And now what I reveal to
[2:21:05] you will be your real life.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to show you the kind
[2:21:11] of life you can live.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, this that's why we can say this up
[2:21:15] and down and up and down. It's gone.
[2:21:17] It's out the window.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; This life of doubt and fear gone.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I think I'd like to just sing I love
[2:21:28] him. I love him. He first loved me.
[2:21:32] I
[2:21:35] love him.
[2:21:39] I
[2:21:42] love
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:53] me.
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:21:58] [Applause]
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:02] is my
[2:22:11] all
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:19] dream.
[2:22:23] [Music]
[2:22:25] And this
[2:22:27] is why
[2:22:30] I love him
[2:22:35] because
[2:22:37] he first
[2:22:39] loved me
[2:22:42] [Music]
[2:22:44] and he
[2:22:47] my
[2:22:49] redemption.
[2:22:51] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:22:56] upon
[2:22:58] the tree.
[2:23:01] And at last
[2:23:04] he cried
[2:23:07] is finished.
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] And
[2:23:13] his head
[2:23:15] and cry.
[2:23:20] Oh, what a
[2:23:22] sign
[2:23:24] for sinners.
[2:23:26] [Music]
[2:23:29] My Jesus.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I'd like us to we could bow our head
[2:23:37] please. I feel to go to prayer just now.
[2:23:41] And there are some here
[2:23:46] who you are. You know that God has
[2:23:48] called you.
[2:23:50] You know that it is his will for you to
[2:23:52] be a son and daughter of his.
[2:23:57] And somehow perhaps you have allowed the
[2:24:00] world or your mind to be just occupied
[2:24:04] with other things
[2:24:07] and you as a result are not living the
[2:24:11] victorious life that God wants you to
[2:24:15] live.
[2:24:17] But their heart your heart was spoken to
[2:24:19] this morning and the Holy Spirit is
[2:24:21] here. The Holy Spirit is persuading you.
[2:24:24] The angels of God are surrounding the
[2:24:28] place and are around you and they're
[2:24:31] encouraging you. They're they're
[2:24:33] energizing your faith to believe to cast
[2:24:37] off the shackles of the enemy that has
[2:24:40] no right. I resist Satan in the name of
[2:24:44] Jesus Christ on behalf of every son and
[2:24:48] daughter of God that seeks to be free
[2:24:51] and seeks to live the life and to
[2:24:54] express the full expression of Jesus
[2:24:56] Christ in their lives. God, you will
[2:25:00] honor it.
[2:25:01] The Holy Spirit is here to see that that
[2:25:04] happens. The Lord Jesus has condescended
[2:25:08] and is here with us in this in this
[2:25:10] building this morning. I wonder how many
[2:25:13] there are that you might want to raise
[2:25:14] your hand. Say, "It's me, Brother Ed.
[2:25:17] It's me." I want you to pray for me. I
[2:25:20] want to be set free at this moment. If
[2:25:23] you're under some bondage, let it be
[2:25:25] broken in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[2:25:28] say in the name of Jesus Christ, believe
[2:25:30] unto your deliverance.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Don't go out of here
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; in fear and don't go out of here
[2:25:38] believing you can't do it. It's not you,
[2:25:40] it's him.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; And you shall be.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; You shall be. When God spoke to the
[2:25:47] great seers of the past, the sages, you
[2:25:51] shall be.
[2:25:53] You shall call his name Jesus, for he
[2:25:55] shall save his people. He shall save his
[2:25:58] people from his sins. There, he's still
[2:26:00] in the saving business right now. There
[2:26:03] may be somebody here that you're not
[2:26:04] certain of your redemption, your
[2:26:06] salvation. He died that you shall be
[2:26:10] saved. Hallelujah. Deny the enemy. Deny
[2:26:14] Satan in Jesus Christ's name. Would the
[2:26:17] congregation pray with me? Father, I
[2:26:20] pray for every man, woman, child that
[2:26:23] raise their hands at this time. And
[2:26:25] Lord, I raise my hands to you on their
[2:26:28] behalf. And I pray that you will come in
[2:26:31] all of your beauty, in all of your
[2:26:33] glory, and you will smite the enemy.
[2:26:36] You'll destroy his camp. Dismantle it.
[2:26:40] Take it apart and send him. Send him
[2:26:44] fleeing away from these people. Lord,
[2:26:47] send him away from them. Destroy that
[2:26:50] habit. Oh God, in the name of Jesus
[2:26:53] Christ, may not hold them any longer.
[2:26:56] Let them be free. Sons and daughters
[2:26:58] made free. Oh, power of God. Power of
[2:27:02] God by the Holy Spirit. Lord, we we are
[2:27:06] calling upon you that it may be a
[2:27:08] completed work. And you that have
[2:27:11] desired it and have prayed it now, you
[2:27:12] should raise thrust your hands in the
[2:27:15] air and say, "Thank God. I thank that's
[2:27:18] it. It's over. It's finished. When I
[2:27:20] believe it, it's finished. Thank God for
[2:27:23] it. I thank you, oh God. Your name has
[2:27:26] been manifested. Your power has been
[2:27:28] revealed to us.
[2:27:31] Oh,
[2:27:32] thank you, Lord. Oh, thank you Lord.
[2:27:37] How mighty you are. How great is our
[2:27:41] God.
[2:27:42] Glory to God.
[2:27:45] Glory to God.
[2:27:48] Thank you Lord.
[2:27:50] Thank you Lord.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Praise his name. Praise his name in the
[2:27:56] life. Praise his name in your life.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:02] How great is our God?
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; I just want to worship him. How great is
[2:28:09] our God.
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:13] Oh, how great is his name.
[2:28:17] [Music]
[2:28:18] He's the greatest one
[2:28:23] forever the same.
[2:28:27] He
[2:28:32] might see
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:38] me
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:42] in
[2:28:45] [Music]
[2:28:47] my
[2:28:50] praise.
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:28:59] forever.
[2:29:00] [Music]
[2:29:07] [Music]
[2:29:16] Put your trust in me.
[2:29:20] And as we're getting ready to leave and
[2:29:22] I'd like you to be early tonight. I know
[2:29:24] the time is short. Our brother Tom will
[2:29:27] be ministering tonight. Something's on
[2:29:28] his heart. Just been down having
[2:29:31] meetings down in Arkansas.
[2:29:33] Anxious to hear what God has spoken to
[2:29:36] him. But uh if anybody asks you who I
[2:29:39] am, tell them I am redeemed.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's at least that not my name, but
[2:29:43] that's one of my titles.
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; That's one of my titles.
[2:29:49] Hallelujah.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; And then we'll shake hands and and be on
[2:29:57] our way dismissed.
[2:29:58] [Music]
[2:30:10] Jesus.
[2:30:19] If anybody
[2:30:21] asks you
[2:30:24] just who I am, oh tell them
[2:30:30] I am
[2:30:34] once again
[2:30:40] [Music]
[2:30:46] Jesus.
[2:30:53] [Music]
[2:30:56] [Applause]
[2:30:58] You
[2:31:00] just
[2:31:04] tell them
[2:31:06] I am.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:17] How could Mrs. Jesus be anything but
[2:31:19] redeemed?
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of Jesus
[2:31:26] Christ. God bless you. Lord willing,
[2:31:29] we'll see you this evening. Just get a
[2:31:30] little bit of rest. Amen. Right to see
[2:31:35] our brother Jim Hayes and Janet's mother
[2:31:38] and father here. God bless them
[2:31:42] coming on these nasty roads. Amen. God
[2:31:46] bless you all. We ought to pray that
[2:31:48] they get some salt for 8th Street.
[2:31:51] Shouldn't wait, Brother Jim. And or or
[2:31:54] maybe better yet, a snow plow.
[2:31:57] Oh, don't worry about it. It'll all be
[2:32:00] over one of these days.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; We'll see you tonight. God bless you.
[2:32:03] You're dismissed.
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:21] Are you
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:30] wonderful?
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:45] might
[2:32:50] see.
[2:32:52] [Music]
