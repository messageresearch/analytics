Description:
Subtitle Video Text from 61-0413 Why: William Marrion Branham

171 One time I was out there preaching, and there was a boy from a certain church that I used to belong to come up, he said, “Billy, you know what? I was enjoying your message so much, until that woman got up back there and begin to screaming and crying, then she got all them people started crying.” “Oh,” I said, “that excite you?” He said, “Why, I couldn’t hear what you was saying.” And said, “That—that…It was all right up to that time.” I said, “Oh, she was just rejoicing.” Said, “Oh, that just made chills run up my back.”  I said, “Brother, if you ever get to Heaven, you’ll freeze to death, let me tell you.” I said, “Because even the Angels in Heaven is screaming with wings over their face, and over their feet, day and night, ‘Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord! Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord!’” I said, “You’re living in the quietest world you ever lived in, if you go to hell, there’ll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth; if you go to Heaven it will be, ‘Glory! Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord,’ day and night. In the quietest place you ever live.”
