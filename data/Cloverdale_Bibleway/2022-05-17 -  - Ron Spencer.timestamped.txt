[0:04] sometimes you might disappear
[0:07] for a little while
[0:09] and you might feel like that
[0:12] you're the only one fighting
[0:15] and then all of a sudden one of your
[0:16] comrades comes up out of a hole
[0:19] and he's killed 800 people in that hole
[0:23] that's scripture whether you knew that
[0:24] or not
[0:27] so if you fall in a hole
[0:31] just go ahead and keep swinging the
[0:33] sword
[0:38] can i finish with this
[0:41] samgar was standing there and he got
[0:44] whipped
[0:45] year after year after year after year
[0:53] but his
[0:54] great-great-great-great-great-granddaddy
[0:57] was sitting outside of his tent
[1:00] and melchizedek came and he fed him meat
[1:02] and gave him milk
[1:05] and melchizedek told him that thy seed
[1:07] shall possess the gates of their enemy
[1:10] as long as shamgar never recognized who
[1:14] he was
[1:15] he would get whipped over and over and
[1:17] over again
[1:18] but one day he looked around at his
[1:20] family and his wife and how wore out
[1:23] that she was and his children how ragged
[1:25] that he was and he realized who he was
[1:29] [Music]
[1:32] the scripture said that one shall take a
[1:35] thousand
[1:36] and because the devil is stupid he only
[1:39] sent 600.
[1:43] [Applause]
[1:50] i did that for a reason
[1:52] i know i'm unethical
[1:54] but the stupid devil comes sometimes by
[1:56] the hundreds to your house
[1:58] but you're given that you could kill a
[2:00] thousand
[2:01] one day
[2:04] a thousand tomorrow thousand the next
[2:06] day
[2:11] hallelujah
[2:13] hallelujah
[2:16] glory
[2:18] yes sir how do you do it one at a time
[2:22] one at a time
[2:23] you kill one you can give you faith and
[2:25] confidence to get another one and it
[2:27] gives you faith and confidence to get
[2:29] another one before long 10 and 20 and 30
[2:32] and 40 and 50 and
[2:34] 60. glory to god
[2:37] [Applause]
[2:39] and then you come to church like a bee
[2:41] in the honey and you're dancing and
[2:43] you're shouting and you're praising the
[2:45] lord and you're in victory and
[2:50] what happened to them
[2:52] one at a time
[2:54] one day at a time one victory at a time
[3:08] it's to him that
[3:16] overcometh him that overcometh
[3:19] not him that surviveth
[3:22] but to him that overcomes
[3:26] not to him that quits and runs and fails
[3:29] and goes back
[3:30] it's a hymn that keeps standing
[3:38] i want to say this to you
[3:40] we shall
[3:41] overcome
