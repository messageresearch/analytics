[16:29] Roy Floren. Brother Roy, if you'd come
[16:30] and open the service in a word of
[16:32] prayer.
[16:34] Got a couple of requests here we want to
[16:36] remember this morning. this request for
[16:38] uh to pray for a family in Croatia,
[16:41] longtime wonderful believers with two
[16:44] young girls and uh just desiring our
[16:49] prayer asking uh for God's perfect will
[16:52] in lives especially in an employment
[16:54] opportunity. Brother Milco's requesting
[16:56] prayer for his wife Johanna arthritis.
[17:00] We want to remember brother Dods still
[17:02] in the hospital and the Lord would raise
[17:04] him up. Amen. give him complete healing.
[17:07] And we want to pray as well this morning
[17:09] for brother Gregory from the Czech
[17:10] Republic. He's brother Zalish's
[17:12] son-in-law. He's in his 40s, has three
[17:15] children. He was operated on for cancer,
[17:17] but the cancer is now spread to other
[17:19] parts of his body. They've asked that we
[17:21] would join with them and pray this
[17:23] morning. Amen. If you have a need this
[17:25] morning is lifted before the Lord as you
[17:26] go to prayer, if you're listening in on
[17:28] the internet, and we've got a God who
[17:30] hears, knows exactly what your need is.
[17:33] So let's join together with these
[17:34] requests. Amen. Brother Roy, if you
[17:37] come,
[17:39] [Music]
[17:43] let us bow our heads.
[17:47] A gracious, loving heavenly father,
[17:51] we count it a privilege once again,
[17:54] Father, to have this opportunity to bow
[17:56] in thy divine and holy presence this
[17:59] morning.
[18:01] Father, we've come here with our leaks
[18:03] of fire to lift up the living God. The
[18:07] one, oh God, who predestinated us before
[18:10] the foundation of the world to be your
[18:13] sons and daughters.
[18:15] [Music]
[18:16] Today we are reminded, oh God, of
[18:18] millions and billions of peoples around
[18:20] the world who are before a television
[18:23] worshiping the gods of sports and
[18:25] entertainment.
[18:27] But here we are as your family, Lord, to
[18:30] worship the God that we love, the one,
[18:32] oh God, who saved us by his grace this
[18:35] morning.
[18:37] And as we've sung the songs of Zion,
[18:39] Lord, that precious fountain, that blood
[18:43] that drew from Emmanuel's vein this
[18:45] morning, that blood, oh God, that rose
[18:49] this Old Testament saints, Father, and
[18:52] today we believe that same blood is here
[18:54] to cleanse us from every sin, Lord. We
[18:57] believe that fountain is still alive in
[18:59] our day this morning, Father. And today,
[19:02] Lord, we just lift ourselves, oh God,
[19:04] out of the way. And let that fountain
[19:07] cleanse us and wash us and purge us from
[19:10] every sin this morning. Oh God, Lord,
[19:14] &gt;&gt; today, oh God, we just want to bring
[19:16] this request that has been read before
[19:18] you, that family in Croatia, Father, we
[19:23] ask you, oh God, that you will just
[19:24] reach in a very special way, oh God, and
[19:27] let your your touch bring them, oh God,
[19:30] that answer the need for their need this
[19:33] morning, Father.
[19:36] We bring Sister Johanna before you, oh
[19:38] God, and asking that you would just
[19:40] touch her, Lord. We pray oh God that
[19:43] divine healing touch of God will reach
[19:46] down and just deliver her from this
[19:48] demon of arthritis this morning oh God
[19:52] and bring total and complete deliverance
[19:54] to her.
[19:56] Father we pray for brother Dods oh God
[19:58] how we know that he would love to be in
[20:00] the house of God this morning worshiping
[20:04] God. Father we think of all the years
[20:07] that brother Dods have sjourned with us.
[20:09] Father, what a soldier. What a mighty
[20:12] man of God. Father, what divine respect
[20:14] we have for our brother this morning. We
[20:17] ask you, oh God, that the Holy Spirit
[20:19] would reach down in a special way and
[20:22] touch him, Father, and raise him up for
[20:25] your glory, and we'll be sure to be
[20:27] reminded there's still a God in in
[20:30] Cloverdale Bible way, oh God, who is
[20:33] doing mighty things amongst us, Lord.
[20:37] and all the other requests, Father, we
[20:39] bring before you this morning, knowing
[20:40] that you're a God who is able to do the
[20:43] exceedingly abundantly above all we can
[20:46] ask or think. We pray that every prayer
[20:49] request will be met. Father, every need
[20:53] that your believers, your sons and
[20:54] daughter, daughters are holding before
[20:56] you this morning, please answer them,
[20:59] Father, we pray. And then we'll be
[21:02] &gt;&gt; happy to give you the praise and the
[21:04] glory, Father.
[21:07] and for the most important part of this
[21:09] service. Oh God,
[21:11] the unveiling of your word this morning
[21:14] to us.
[21:16] We know that your servant has set
[21:18] himself aside and has
[21:22] received from you, Lord, a word that
[21:25] will change us this morning.
[21:28] A word that will meet every need,
[21:30] Father. For the word is quick and it's
[21:32] powerful and it's sharper than any
[21:35] two-edged sword. Father, we pray that
[21:38] the word will go through the very
[21:39] dividing aunder of the soul and spirit
[21:42] this morning and let it discern every
[21:45] need in your divine presence. Father,
[21:48] let every need be met here, every
[21:50] spiritual need, Father, will be met.
[21:53] Everyone who is desiring, oh father, a
[21:55] closer walk with you. Oh, grant it to
[21:58] them I pray this morning. Everyone who's
[22:01] desiring encouragement, encourage them
[22:04] this morning. Every sick one, Father,
[22:06] the word will heal them this morning.
[22:09] Every financial burden, every financial
[22:12] need, you will merge in our divine
[22:14] presence this morning, Father. So we
[22:17] commit this service to you. We asking
[22:19] you, oh God, that you would take your
[22:21] servant in the palm of your hands and
[22:24] use him, oh God, get the man out of the
[22:27] way and let the word come forth with
[22:29] power and demonstration of the Holy
[22:31] Spirit.
[22:33] And we will leave you Lord like those
[22:35] who came on the word of the mayor
[22:37] saying, "Did not our heart stir within
[22:40] us? Did not our heart burn within us, oh
[22:43] God, as we walk with him along the way
[22:45] this morning?" Yes.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; So we want to thank you for your divine
[22:49] presence here this morning, Father. And
[22:52] we want to thank you, oh God, that you
[22:54] were here to meet every need, every
[22:56] situation, Father, for the word of the
[23:00] hour has come to meet every situation,
[23:02] Lord. And we pray that you will take
[23:05] absolute control of this service this
[23:07] morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[23:10] ask these things. Amen and amen.

[23:45] Emerson's headed back to uh to New

[23:55] God's speed as he heads back and trust
[23:57] that he'll be back here again with us
[23:59] before too long. God bless you. Um also,

[29:13] can't go on. I don't know what to do."
[29:18] But in that hour,
[29:22] we find our juniper tree.
[29:26] And there the angel comes to strengthen
[29:29] for the journey ahead.
[29:33] For in our weakness,
[29:36] his strength is made perfect. And his
[29:41] grace is sufficient for us.

[34:54] &gt;&gt; falling in love. Let's stand together
[34:56] with brother.

[35:50] &gt;&gt; I'm falling in love.
[35:53] [Applause]
[35:55] Falling in love with Jesus.
[36:01] Falling
[36:04] with Jesus.
[36:13] Jesus
[36:15] was the best

[36:30] Falling in love with Jesus.
[36:35] Falling in love. Falling in love with
[36:40] Jesus.
[36:43] was the best thing that I ever done.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; And just as brother Ed comes, let's
[36:51] choir sing with us. I saw love, mercy,
[36:53] and grace. I looked on his beauty.
[36:57] I envisioned his grace. I saw love,
[37:00] mercy, and grace. Amen. Let's sing it
[37:02] together.
[37:05] I saw love,

[38:16] and praise.
[38:19] Just before the choir goes down, I'll
[38:22] ask the question that I've been
[38:24] preaching about. What seeest thou?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; What have you seen? Thank you, brother
[38:31] Roy. I saw love,
[38:34] &gt;&gt; mercy.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I saw mercy.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[38:42] &gt;&gt; we're glad we saw grace.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Abundant grace.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Boundless love.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; We're entering into that this morning.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've been in a spirit of
[38:56] revival.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Wednesday's meeting almost went out of
[39:02] human control.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; I would just saying, "What do you want
[39:05] to do, Lord?"
[39:07] &gt;&gt; That's what we sooner have. We sooner
[39:08] have God in control.
[39:11] And that's what we want to be pointing
[39:13] our whole effort and direction this
[39:15] morning. Let's just sing it once again.
[39:18] I saw love, mercy, and grace.
[39:22] I saw love
[39:26] mercy
[39:28] and gracy
[39:30] [Music]
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:37] and
[39:41] I am
[39:44] if you
[39:53] mercy
[39:55] and
[39:57] [Music]
[40:00] Amen. I'll had let you have your seats
[40:03] for a few moments.
[40:14] I'd like to draw your attention to uh
[40:16] this weekend. It's going to be very very
[40:18] busy.
[40:19] So, you want to
[40:22] make a mental note of uh the days
[40:25] our brother Joseph Green who's pastoring
[40:29] now the church at first his father
[40:31] pastored, brother Henry Green and then
[40:34] brother Dan Daisley.
[40:36] And now since both of them have passed
[40:38] on, brother Joseph Green is a pastor and
[40:41] he will be here for Friday. There will
[40:44] be no service Wednesday.
[40:46] The service will take place Friday and
[40:49] Brother Green will be with us that night
[40:51] and also on Sunday, both services.
[40:55] But on Thursday,
[40:57] uh we'll be having a presentation, not
[41:00] here in the church. It'll be in the
[41:01] fellowship room.
[41:03] Uh and uh Erdan
[41:08] uh uh our guide from Turkey is going to
[41:12] be here. He's arriving the day before on
[41:14] Wednesday the 4th. So they'll be getting
[41:16] ready and he'll be giving a presentation
[41:19] for those that are interested. And this
[41:22] is uh this will be the excuse me the
[41:26] first presentation will be on the cities
[41:29] of the church age sites
[41:32] and some of them are you know have
[41:34] considerable ruins and others have not
[41:37] yet been excavated
[41:39] probably never will be.
[41:42] Uh but uh that will be taking place on
[41:46] Thursday the 5th at 7:30
[41:49] and then on Saturday the 7th will be the
[41:53] second presentation and that
[41:54] presentation is a different presentation
[41:57] that is on the footsteps of the apostle
[41:59] Paul. And the purpose of these
[42:02] presentations are so that you will be
[42:05] introduced to what a tour would be like
[42:08] if and when you would like to take one.
[42:11] There probably will be a tour taking
[42:14] place this year and I we don't know till
[42:17] Erdan gets here whether that will be a
[42:19] late spring which I think is too early
[42:22] for a lot of people to get their
[42:24] vacation time and get the necessary
[42:27] funds put aside
[42:29] uh for that tour but there may be
[42:32] sufficient only probably takes about 25
[42:34] people for a tour but I think we'd
[42:36] probably be having about maybe as many
[42:39] as 50 just depending on the on the
[42:42] congregation but he's just coming here
[42:45] to let you know this is what this is
[42:47] what it's all about and these are the
[42:50] sites and there is about uh I think
[42:54] around 60 PowerPoint slides on one of
[42:57] the presentations and over 90 on the
[43:00] second it's not going to be long long
[43:03] drawn out but you'll have a time to you
[43:05] know speak and mingle with Erdan after
[43:08] to ask questions if you wish And I do
[43:11] not know how many want to come, but we
[43:14] can handle perhaps 300 350 people in the
[43:17] fellowship room. Uh but both
[43:20] presentations are different. That's what
[43:21] you have to understand. They're both
[43:23] different. So if you would like to take
[43:25] it in, you should perhaps be there early
[43:28] to get a good seat. And uh
[43:31] uh so I just felt to do that. Uh this uh
[43:36] this guide uh Erdan is more than a
[43:40] guide. He was a teacher and instructor
[43:42] of guides for uh for the association or
[43:47] for the government. He is vice president
[43:50] of Tatu Tours right now and that's in
[43:54] Ismir
[43:56] uh and u I found him to be just a
[44:00] excellent excellent person. He's just a
[44:02] very very fine man. Of course, he's not
[44:04] a believer, but we were made in we were
[44:07] put in contact with uh him and his
[44:11] company. Not his company, but he was
[44:13] doing some guiding for this company. We
[44:16] were put in touch with them originally
[44:18] through brother Doug Lens
[44:20] in Ottawa.
[44:22] And uh they've he's had I guess quite a
[44:24] bit of contact with them. So anyway,
[44:26] that is this uh this weekend. So, we're
[44:29] going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[44:32] and Sunday are going to be it's going to
[44:35] be a busy and a full weekend.
[44:39] Um, next month we have a brother
[44:43] uh in in March,
[44:46] I'm sorry, it's in March. Yeah, in
[44:48] March, we have brother Jason Jackson
[44:50] coming up. This church has never met
[44:52] Brother Jason. He's a young minister and
[44:55] uh I just felt he's from Arkansas and I
[44:58] just felt to invite him. So he's he's
[45:00] going to be coming here around the
[45:02] middle of March also to uh I just want
[45:05] the church to become acquainted with
[45:07] more of these younger men that are
[45:09] rising up and taking places of
[45:11] responsibility and that God is using.
[45:15] Uh
[45:20] so there's a lot happening
[45:22] happening everywhere and we're thankful
[45:25] for it.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; I just don't want to take up any more
[45:29] time. I started to think about talking
[45:31] about some other meetings, but I think
[45:33] that we'll we'll just go to the word at
[45:36] this time. All right. Why don't we stand
[45:39] and we're going to pray and then I'm
[45:41] going to read. And I would like to ask
[45:44] that you would just be completely
[45:48] yielded to the Holy Spirit today.
[45:52] Oh God, Father,
[45:55] without you, we can do nothing.
[45:59] We confess that this uh building is
[46:03] filled with people and they're in the
[46:05] fellowship room and uh mothers in the
[46:08] nursery and there are those that are
[46:11] streaming right now live streaming and
[46:14] we are indeed grateful oh God for the
[46:18] bride of Jesus Christ the bloodbought
[46:21] and I feel Lord even unworthy to stand
[46:24] here before this purchased company
[46:28] purchased by your love, purchased by
[46:32] your blood, purchased by a perfect
[46:34] sacrifice to bring forth a perfect
[46:38] bride, spotless in the name of Jesus
[46:41] Christ, one that would be wedded and is
[46:44] wedded to the son of God. Oh, Father,
[46:49] how we long and yearn for that time,
[46:52] Lord Jesus. And we feel the pull of the
[46:55] invitation, the wedding supper
[46:57] invitation. I pray that you will take
[47:00] control of the service now. Take control
[47:02] of the speaker, oh God. Take control of
[47:05] the channel. I pray you will blow the
[47:08] flu out. Let there be nothing in the
[47:10] memory or the imagination.
[47:13] Let there be nothing in the conscience
[47:15] that's condemning. Oh God, let there be
[47:17] nothing in the reasoning that would war
[47:19] against the word, Lord. Let there be
[47:22] nothing, I pray, in any of the channels,
[47:24] oh God, but let your word find that
[47:26] channel to the soul, I pray in the name
[47:28] of Jesus Christ. And may it come down
[47:31] that channel in faith
[47:34] &gt;&gt; so that the impossible may take place.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for our brother
[47:39] Edwin Dods and the progress that has
[47:41] been taking place. I know he's been
[47:43] prayed for. I want to remember him as my
[47:46] dear brother, father. Pray that you will
[47:49] just encompass him with your divine
[47:51] presence now in Jesus Christ's name.
[47:55] Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; If you'll take your Bibles, please, and
[47:59] turn to Genesis the uh 11th chapter. And
[48:03] while you're turning to Genesis, the
[48:07] 11th chapter,
[48:09] I just want to make this comment. We've
[48:11] been on the subject of what seeest thou
[48:15] spoke the first uh service from Amos and
[48:19] the Lord asked hell
[48:22] what seeest thou? You'll remember that
[48:24] Amos the Amos the prophet Amos was the
[48:29] one brother Brandham spoke of on way of
[48:32] a true prophet. He brought a brought a
[48:34] very very very
[48:36] stiff hard message uh to the people of
[48:40] his generation. It it was because the
[48:43] Israel had long forgot God and long
[48:47] forgot who they were supposed to be. And
[48:50] the scripture tells us about that and
[48:53] brother Brandham details it. He said
[48:55] they had great the greatest buildings
[48:57] and the religious systems and so forth
[49:00] that they had ever had and altars built
[49:03] everywhere. So they certainly were not a
[49:06] non-religious people. They were very
[49:08] religious people. And he said Israel was
[49:10] at its height and it was in alliance
[49:12] with all the other nations. It it
[49:15] essentially had peace and it was very
[49:17] glamorous. Uh just think of it. and the
[49:20] women dressed to the spot and the men
[49:22] and they were pleasure stricken and
[49:25] running races and Olympics and
[49:27] everything going on. And of course,
[49:28] here's the Lord's day. We're here to
[49:30] celebrate the resurrection of the Lord
[49:32] Jesus Christ. And of course, there's
[49:34] multitudes that have no time for that
[49:36] because they're busy with their football
[49:37] and busy with their bicycle races and
[49:40] whatever else going on. But we're in the
[49:42] house of God.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're so glad we're
[49:46] here. But God was saying to Amos, "What
[49:49] seeestest thou?" He said, "I see a plum
[49:52] line." And that is something you build
[49:54] to. And God was letting him know that
[49:57] that he and his word was a plum line to
[50:00] that nation. And they had gone far from
[50:03] it. And then we had the second one last
[50:07] Wednesday, part two.
[50:10] And what seeest thou? And uh it seemed
[50:13] that God really came down and witnessed
[50:15] to us as we spoke about the generation
[50:18] that brother Brandham was sent to. And
[50:21] he was telling them that they'd seen too
[50:24] much. They saw the genuine. They saw the
[50:27] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost. They
[50:29] saw the genuine deliverance. She said,
[50:30] "You've seen prostitutes and alcoholics
[50:33] come off the street and come into the
[50:35] glory of God, but you've seen so much it
[50:38] became too common and took the faith out
[50:41] of you." That's something we never want
[50:44] to see happen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; So, we want to hold dear this Lord Jesus
[50:49] Christ as he's revealed himself to us.
[50:52] And now I'm doing a complete turn.
[50:58] We're asking God,
[51:01] "What seeest thou?"
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Because we're going to read where God
[51:06] now came down to see what the people
[51:10] were doing.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; So, we'll read the first verse. And the
[51:16] whole earth was of one language and of
[51:19] one speech. And it came to pass as they
[51:22] journeyed from the east that they found
[51:24] a plain land of Shenar. And they dwelt
[51:28] there. And they said one to another, "Go
[51:31] to let us make brick, and burn them
[51:34] thoroughly." And they had brick for
[51:37] stone and slime
[51:40] had they for mortar.
[51:42] And they said, "Go to let us build us a
[51:46] city and a tower whose top may reach
[51:49] unto heaven,
[51:51] and make us a name," and that name is a
[51:55] reputation.
[51:57] It means fame. Let us make a a name,
[52:00] fame, a memorial, lest we be scattered
[52:03] abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
[52:07] And the Lord came down to see the city
[52:11] and the tower which the children of men
[52:13] builded. You may have your seats.
[52:21] And you will need your full focus
[52:25] this morning. So do not be distracted if
[52:28] people move or they have to move. And I
[52:29] would ask those that if you have
[52:32] children that you'll
[52:34] do everything you can to have as little
[52:36] movement as possible.
[52:39] There have been a number of times in the
[52:42] scripture
[52:43] where it either says directly or
[52:46] indirectly infers that God came down
[52:51] and God came down to see what was taking
[52:53] place in a in a given generation. And
[52:57] the Bible says here, he came down to
[52:59] see. And I do not believe that he came
[53:01] down to see physically what the people
[53:04] were doing because God's all knowing.
[53:08] I don't believe he came down to see
[53:10] geographically where they were and you
[53:12] know where they were moving and what
[53:14] they were doing. But he came down to see
[53:18] and I will show in the scripture each
[53:20] time specifically or just with inference
[53:26] that the way God sees is that he
[53:30] delivers his word to a generation. He
[53:34] delivers his word to his people and then
[53:37] he looks to see their response to that
[53:42] word.
[53:44] And that is how God viewed
[53:48] a a people. That's how God viewed
[53:50] Israel. That's how God is actually
[53:52] looking on us today to see our response
[53:55] to the word and observing the the
[53:58] people. Jesus said,
[54:02] "I have many things to say and to judge
[54:05] of you,
[54:07] but he that sent me is true, and I speak
[54:11] to the world those things which I have
[54:15] heard of him.
[54:17] And if any man hear my words and believe
[54:20] not, I judge him not. For I came not to
[54:23] the world, not to judge the world, but
[54:26] to save the world.
[54:29] He that rejectth me and receiveth not my
[54:33] words, he hath one that judgeth him the
[54:38] word that I have spoken.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; The same shall judge him in that day. So
[54:45] now the physical person being Jesus
[54:47] Christ himself, he didn't come to speak
[54:50] and and show that he was judging the
[54:52] world or judging the people. Said I
[54:54] didn't come to judge the world. I came
[54:56] to save the world. But the words that I
[54:58] speak will judge them. In other words,
[55:01] the response of the people to what he
[55:04] said was either their salvation or their
[55:06] judgment.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; That's the principle. That's the
[55:11] pattern.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Genesis, as we know, is the seed book.
[55:16] And we find in Genesis, in singular
[55:20] form, the things that we find in the end
[55:24] time, in the harvest time, in a multiple
[55:28] form, a multiplied form, we find it that
[55:31] way in the end time. And so what the
[55:33] people were doing in the in the Genesis
[55:36] and the scripture which we read this
[55:38] morning, uh the people what they were
[55:41] doing, they were building a city and a
[55:44] tower, the tower of Babel and then they
[55:48] con and and and they constructed it in
[55:51] the land of uh Shenar, but rather
[55:54] because of the scene, what the scene
[55:57] represented. It wasn't it wasn't just so
[56:00] much that it happened to be right there
[56:02] geographically and that these people
[56:05] were doing it, but God had a reason of
[56:08] of identifying what they were doing
[56:12] specifically what they were doing
[56:14] because it was in seed form. And God was
[56:17] not just coming down to see what they
[56:20] were doing, but how that reflected and
[56:23] how and and you you'll see this very
[56:26] clearly in the scripture. When God was
[56:29] looking at the Tower of Babel, he wasn't
[56:31] just seeing that mortar and clay
[56:35] &gt;&gt; and bricks, but he was seeing what that
[56:37] Babel was going to be in its harvest
[56:39] form. Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just seeing those people
[56:44] there, but he was seeing the multiplied
[56:47] hundreds of millions and billions of
[56:50] people and what they'd be involved in in
[56:52] in the end time.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Now,
[56:56] uh, Babel, Brother Brandham says
[56:59] concerning Babel is the original name
[57:02] for Babylon. Now, some of this may just
[57:05] sound historical, but I need all of this
[57:07] for for foundation material. So, you
[57:11] listen very very closely. So, Babel is
[57:14] is the original name for Babylon, and it
[57:17] means confusion. And so, much of this
[57:19] may be, you know, very elementary to
[57:22] you, but I want to tie some things
[57:23] together today. He said it was ilit it
[57:27] was literally started by Kush the son of
[57:30] Ham
[57:32] uh but was brought to a kingdom of power
[57:35] and grandeur under his son Nimrod
[57:39] the mighty hunter and as you know Ham
[57:42] was one of the sons of Noah.
[57:45] So now the tower of Babel in the message
[57:47] go out of this evil age. He said notice
[57:50] his plans to build a super
[57:53] denominational church,
[57:55] the world council of churches, a super
[57:59] denomination so that all the world will
[58:02] worship him. See what God was looking at
[58:04] back there. This is what God is looking
[58:07] for. Came down to see it. But he's
[58:09] seeing what this what this had reference
[58:13] to. what this was typifying, what this
[58:16] was signifying all down through history.
[58:19] You could see that that was Babel that
[58:21] was going to ripple all the way right to
[58:23] the end time and going to be one of the
[58:26] keynote things that's going to come to
[58:28] destruction.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And that Satan, his arc enemy, was going
[58:31] to use whatever was happening here in
[58:34] seed form. It was going to grow and grow
[58:36] and grow and grow until the end time.
[58:39] And there God was going to deal with it
[58:40] in the end. And so it'll be a super
[58:43] denomination so that all the world will
[58:45] worship him. See, what God was seeing
[58:47] there is that Satan, his arc enemy,
[58:50] Lucifer, is going to use what he's
[58:52] sewing there and the people he's got in
[58:55] control there to achieve a worship
[58:59] &gt;&gt; in the end time.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You follow that?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And all the world will worship him, the
[59:05] beast, under the name of United
[59:08] Christianity. And and folks, I won't say
[59:11] sorry, but I'll say attention. Behold,
[59:15] we didn't just read Genesis, but we
[59:18] happen to be right here where the
[59:19] prophet is speaking of. We're here in
[59:22] the other end in the other end of it. He
[59:25] said, "Would you like to read in the in
[59:27] the Bible in Revelations 136 and 8? It's
[59:31] a modern tower of Babel."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And here is the scripture that brother
[59:37] Brandham referred to. and he opened his
[59:39] mouth in blasphemy against God to
[59:42] blasphe his name and his tabernacle and
[59:46] them that dwell in heaven and and he
[59:48] drops a line in and them that dwell in
[59:50] heaven and he's referring to Rome. He's
[59:54] referring to that system because they
[59:56] were the first one to put a system into
[59:58] place. And that and the seeds of this
[1:00:01] system, the seeds of the entire Roman uh
[1:00:05] system, the seeds of it were sown back
[1:00:07] there in Babel because they Babylon of
[1:00:09] today.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And to and to blaspheme
[1:00:14] and his name and his tabernacle and them
[1:00:16] that dwell in heaven." He said
[1:00:18] blasphemed them by saying they were
[1:00:21] intercessors,
[1:00:23] them that are in heaven. The
[1:00:25] blaspheming, the blasphemy that they
[1:00:27] committed, which is being done today
[1:00:30] while you're sitting here,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; they're teaching it all over the
[1:00:34] country, all over the earth,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; that those that have gone are
[1:00:38] intercessors for us.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That's blasphemy.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one that can intercede for
[1:00:44] us.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's the Lord Jesus Christ. And so he
[1:00:48] said they bla they blasphemed them by
[1:00:51] saying that they were intercessors. And
[1:00:53] the scripture goes on and it was given
[1:00:55] unto him to make war with the saints and
[1:00:58] to overcome them. And power was given
[1:01:02] unto him over all kindreds and tongues
[1:01:04] and nations. And all that dwell upon the
[1:01:07] earth shall worship him whose names are
[1:01:10] not written in the book of life of the
[1:01:14] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:01:16] world. How thankful I am for that verse
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; whose names are not found.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here today and you're
[1:01:25] seated here today with that confidence,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; absolute assurance in our heart that our
[1:01:32] names were found in that book. And thus
[1:01:36] knowing that their name was found in the
[1:01:38] book, Satan cannot deceive
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; and he will never have our worship.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; We will never be drawn into his system.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; We will never be drawn into his circle
[1:01:51] of fellowship.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care how ecumenical it becomes.
[1:01:56] We can never be drawn into it because
[1:01:58] we've been already separated from it.
[1:02:01] And already the veil has been pulled. He
[1:02:04] has been exposed and we see him for what
[1:02:07] he is.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So what God was seeing what God was
[1:02:18] seeing when he saw and came down to see
[1:02:22] what the children of men, he came down
[1:02:24] to see the city and the tower.
[1:02:29] What God was seeing was a highly
[1:02:31] organized
[1:02:33] civilization
[1:02:35] reaching into the heavens.
[1:02:38] Here we are, a highly organized
[1:02:41] civilization,
[1:02:42] reaching into the heavens,
[1:02:45] stripping his name from worship
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and worshiping their own flesh
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; and the work of their own hands.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; He saw Satan
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; back there when he looked at Bible. He
[1:02:58] saw Satan, Lucifer, in the end time
[1:03:02] being crowned
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; in his Eden
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; in his scientific achievement
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; and his religious babble of confusion.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; The scripture does not indicate
[1:03:18] how he came down but is clear that he
[1:03:23] did come down to see the city in the
[1:03:25] tower. doesn't say how he came down
[1:03:29] in that instance.
[1:03:31] He came down again which I'll come to in
[1:03:33] a few moments. He came down to see
[1:03:36] Abraham and Sodom
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I've come down to see if
[1:03:42] it is the way has had been told me."
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; In both cases, he came to Abraham to see
[1:03:49] what Abraham's response would be to his
[1:03:52] promise.
[1:03:53] He came to Sodom to see what they would
[1:03:57] do at the message of the two angels.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says clearly that that
[1:04:02] their message blinded them.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; According to Usher, Usher's uh
[1:04:10] uh
[1:04:12] is is very highly considered in their
[1:04:15] history. But usher's
[1:04:18] uh date places Babel,
[1:04:20] the account of Babel 106 years after the
[1:04:24] flood. And I'm only giving this just to
[1:04:25] give you a little bit of background.
[1:04:29] And in that time, even acknowledging
[1:04:32] that Noah's children
[1:04:34] began having children of their own very
[1:04:37] soon after the the the flood,
[1:04:40] the total world population could not
[1:04:43] have grown very large.
[1:04:46] Yet the Babel account clearly says that
[1:04:48] the men started to build a city. And yet
[1:04:51] the word city
[1:04:53] is used in the story. the the city
[1:04:57] really means a place that's guarded.
[1:05:00] So, and it and it has reference to
[1:05:03] people being awake and being guarded and
[1:05:06] protecting it. So, the a city doesn't
[1:05:08] need to be that large. It would perhaps
[1:05:11] be the size of a town in in our language
[1:05:14] today. So, the sons of Noah each had
[1:05:18] sons of the three sons. One had four
[1:05:21] sons, one had five sons, and one had
[1:05:23] seven sons for a total of 16 families.
[1:05:29] 106 years allows time for five
[1:05:32] generations.
[1:05:34] And if each family produced eight more
[1:05:36] families, the population could reach at
[1:05:41] least 65,000 people in uh 106 years. So
[1:05:47] this is what we're talking about. So
[1:05:49] that's the setting. So possibly there's
[1:05:51] as many as as 65,000 people. But you
[1:05:56] notice the scripture says
[1:05:58] they said let us
[1:06:01] that and and they with one mind began to
[1:06:04] do this. So the first thing that we have
[1:06:07] back there is a democracy.
[1:06:10] They're starting to achieve a system and
[1:06:14] the system is actually a democratic
[1:06:16] system because it became the voice of
[1:06:18] the people. Let us build a city and they
[1:06:21] set to do it together.
[1:06:24] So they had a they had a a a unity of
[1:06:26] sort. They had a democracy of a sort.
[1:06:31] They had an advanced form of living
[1:06:34] and where uh a large number of people
[1:06:37] they gathered into one place. Let's
[1:06:39] identify this place where they would
[1:06:43] live and work. They developed a form of
[1:06:46] government because a city requires that
[1:06:49] and a standard of social social life,
[1:06:53] social standards. So let us build a
[1:06:56] city. So there's a turning point and
[1:06:59] that is back there. So hold those things
[1:07:02] in your mind. The second thing is and a
[1:07:05] tower. Now the Bible says clearly and
[1:07:07] God came down to see the city and the
[1:07:11] tower. Didn't come down to have
[1:07:13] fellowship with the people. Let's come
[1:07:15] down and see what they are doing. And
[1:07:18] the seeds of our modern society were
[1:07:21] sewing right there.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; There's coming a system
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; uh to to to unite the people together.
[1:07:32] And this tower in the Hebrew is an
[1:07:35] elevated place which which speaks of in
[1:07:39] my mind of advanced technology.
[1:07:43] Let us make a memorial and a tower is
[1:07:46] also security
[1:07:48] and and there isn't any place in the
[1:07:50] world today there is no nation that
[1:07:52] hasn't got security someplace in their
[1:07:55] thought.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; We need to secure our borders. We need
[1:07:59] to secure our government. We need to
[1:08:02] secure our people. We need a form of
[1:08:05] security. So, let us build a tower. Let
[1:08:08] us build a memorial. Let us not be
[1:08:11] scattered and forgotten. Uh let us be
[1:08:15] identified as being a a civilized
[1:08:17] people. We have a certain order in
[1:08:19] place. And so, this is what was taking
[1:08:22] place. Now, I'm just taking a quantum
[1:08:25] leap in the message handwriting on the
[1:08:27] wall. Brother Brandham says Babylon was
[1:08:30] first located
[1:08:32] which it is yet in Shenar and it was
[1:08:35] first called the gate of God. Babel,
[1:08:39] Babel and later was called Babylon which
[1:08:42] means confusion
[1:08:44] and Babylon appears in the first of the
[1:08:47] Bible in Genesis and it appears in the
[1:08:50] middle of the Bible and it appears in
[1:08:53] the last of the Bible in the last book
[1:08:56] Revelation
[1:08:57] and being that it's all through the
[1:08:59] Bible it must be in existence yet today.
[1:09:03] I want to just announce to the
[1:09:05] congregation as I'm preaching and
[1:09:07] feeling led of the Holy Spirit in this
[1:09:09] part three of what seeest thou. It's God
[1:09:13] now who came down to see
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; and I'm asking the question, Father,
[1:09:18] what did you see? Father, what are you
[1:09:21] seeing? What seeest thou
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; in this day in Cloverdale Bible way
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; in the ranks of the message
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and our civilization? What do you see?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Because we know that he will be
[1:09:35] motivated as we are by what he sees.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Good
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; in God of this evil age. He said he's
[1:09:43] making a reference and he said it's a
[1:09:46] modern tower of Babel.
[1:09:49] Nimrod that hypocrite hypocrite
[1:09:52] hypocrite built this big tower and made
[1:09:55] all the other cities pay tribute to it.
[1:10:00] Babel is the same thing. It just changes
[1:10:03] its name as it comes on up. Rome now is
[1:10:08] Babylon.
[1:10:10] And the whole world's brought to
[1:10:12] Babylon. You ought to see the who's who
[1:10:15] list that goes there.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And it's brought in by the World Council
[1:10:22] of Churches, which will make everyone of
[1:10:25] them bow to her. and you took the mark
[1:10:28] of the beast, not knowing what you were
[1:10:30] doing. But he said, "But those who are
[1:10:33] elected will hear the word and come out
[1:10:36] of it."
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And there's a group of people here today
[1:10:40] that have come out of it. Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And one of the grandest things that I
[1:10:45] can think of today is I'll be able to
[1:10:47] say to you, young and old alike, and
[1:10:51] those on the telephone or the streaming,
[1:10:54] we ought to rejoice from the depths of
[1:10:57] our soul that we know that we will never
[1:11:00] take that mark.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; What protection
[1:11:08] do we have? What a glorious thing that
[1:11:11] God has done
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; that we don't have to sit and tremble or
[1:11:15] have fear. We are not going to be
[1:11:18] seduced by that deceiver to take that
[1:11:21] mark.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Think of it today. There are many being
[1:11:27] sealed in by taking that mark
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; unknowingly, unwittingly
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; because he has so
[1:11:36] deceived the generation.
[1:11:40] So he says Rome now is Babylon and the
[1:11:44] whole world is brought to Babylon.
[1:11:48] You've heard the
[1:11:51] phrase commonly referred to as the the
[1:11:54] Vatican
[1:11:56] and they refer to the Holy Sea.
[1:12:00] And I thought I would like to just
[1:12:02] understand a little more about the Holy
[1:12:04] Sea. this this system.
[1:12:08] Brother Brenle refers to Rome as being
[1:12:11] the first system.
[1:12:14] Pentecost was birthed without a system.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; It was divinely orchestrated by the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; And that is why in my own heart even
[1:12:24] today I yearn.
[1:12:26] I yearn for the direction of the Holy
[1:12:29] Spirit.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in man guiding
[1:12:32] things. I'm interested in God guiding
[1:12:35] things.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Not interested in man's systems.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandom didn't say what he said
[1:12:44] about, you know, the church order and
[1:12:47] the the hospitals and the
[1:12:50] schools and the Bible schools and all
[1:12:52] those things. wasn't saying it because
[1:12:54] he was just opposed to those things, but
[1:12:57] they were a system that man had set up
[1:13:01] to try to accomplish the work of God.
[1:13:03] And God's work will never be
[1:13:05] accomplished that way.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Sea is a they said the
[1:13:12] expression the Holy Sea refers to the
[1:13:14] supreme authority of the church and thus
[1:13:18] the pope as bishop of Rome. Now this is
[1:13:22] out of directly out of their material.
[1:13:26] They have uh websites that want to
[1:13:29] explain to the people how the internal
[1:13:32] workings of Rome are conducted. And this
[1:13:36] is from uh one of their sites.
[1:13:40] And uh it it says that the u supreme
[1:13:43] authority of the church actually the
[1:13:45] holy sea has reference to the uh the
[1:13:49] cardinals
[1:13:51] that the the the supreme authority of
[1:13:55] the church within the cardinals and the
[1:13:57] pope is the bishop of Rome and the head
[1:14:00] of the college of cardinals and as such
[1:14:03] the holy sea is an institution which
[1:14:06] according to the international laws I
[1:14:08] want you to listen very closely
[1:14:10] The Holy Sea is an institution
[1:14:14] which according to the international
[1:14:16] laws and customs has a judicial
[1:14:19] personality
[1:14:21] which permits it to sign treaties and to
[1:14:25] send and receive diplom diplomatic
[1:14:27] representatives
[1:14:29] as judicial equivalent of a state. And
[1:14:33] that actually is actually quite recent
[1:14:36] because the Vatican became the holy city
[1:14:40] in recent times in most of many of our
[1:14:43] lifetime.
[1:14:46] The state of the Vatican City and the
[1:14:48] Holy Sea, both sovereign subjects of
[1:14:51] international public law,
[1:14:54] universally recognized, universally
[1:14:56] recognized,
[1:14:58] are indisolubable,
[1:15:00] uni, indisolubably united in the person
[1:15:04] of the Supreme Pontiff as head of state
[1:15:08] who possesses full legislative,
[1:15:12] judicial, and executive powers. s
[1:15:18] the state of the Vatican, which probably
[1:15:21] most of you do not know, and I didn't
[1:15:23] know till I've read this, they mint
[1:15:26] their own coins
[1:15:28] and issue their own postage stamps.
[1:15:31] The bishop of Rome is the bishop of the
[1:15:35] Holy Sea,
[1:15:37] uh, more often referred to as the Pope.
[1:15:42] statements of brother Brandham now
[1:15:46] statements that he made that I will be
[1:15:49] making now quoting him are very
[1:15:51] revealing.
[1:15:54] He says that pagan Rome which was what
[1:15:58] was in power when Christ was here
[1:16:03] only changed its mask
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and became papal Rome.
[1:16:10] So you can be sure that all of its
[1:16:13] darkness,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; all of its violence and evil that were
[1:16:19] back there are still with it
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; only in a more sophisticated way.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; All of its uh cruelty
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; and that it displayed down through the
[1:16:33] dark ages, it's all still here. Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; So he says this,
[1:16:41] people look at Rome, they look at the
[1:16:45] nation of Italy and as they look they do
[1:16:48] not realize that Rome with her strict
[1:16:51] confines
[1:16:53] where the pope has an actual area as his
[1:16:56] domain. This is in the Pergamine church
[1:16:59] age is literally a nation within a
[1:17:01] nation. Right. Right.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; And she has ambassadors and receives
[1:17:06] ambassadors. See how he refers to that.
[1:17:09] Now the one is actually from the website
[1:17:12] of the holy sea. And they're saying and
[1:17:16] describe the internal workings of how
[1:17:18] they have ambassadors and their judicial
[1:17:21] powers that they have the executive
[1:17:22] powers and so on. Here's here's a
[1:17:25] prophet of God speaking of how she has
[1:17:28] ambassadors and receive. That's very
[1:17:30] important because she has to have
[1:17:32] ambassadors and receive ambassadors
[1:17:35] because she's got to make her agreement
[1:17:37] with with Israel
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; and break it.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; She has to make this covenant.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; So this system that man set up which was
[1:17:48] in in the tower of Babel was indicative
[1:17:51] of what we are seeing. So we're going
[1:17:54] way back there and say all the seeds
[1:17:55] were sewn there, we're seeing it here in
[1:17:57] the harvest farm.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; He said papal
[1:18:04] papal false Christian Rome. She's even
[1:18:07] called the eternal city. How
[1:18:10] blasphemous.
[1:18:12] now controlled by religion even more aly
[1:18:16] than when pagan imperial Rome controlled
[1:18:19] by the pure iron force.
[1:18:22] Rome took on a new lease on life when
[1:18:26] Constantine joined church and state and
[1:18:29] backed the union by force. The spirit
[1:18:33] that motivated pagan Rome is the same
[1:18:36] spirit that now motivates false
[1:18:38] Christian Rome. And you can see that it
[1:18:41] is because you know that the fourth
[1:18:45] empire never went out of existence. It
[1:18:47] just changed in its outer texture.
[1:18:53] Now it says that they spake one language
[1:18:56] back
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; at the Tower of Babel and God said let's
[1:19:00] go down and we bring confusion
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; and people spoke different languages
[1:19:05] etc.
[1:19:06] And today I will say not that everybody
[1:19:10] is being forced into or everyone ever
[1:19:13] will speak the same mother tongue.
[1:19:17] But I think that you could see and at
[1:19:20] least I want to suggest to you that the
[1:19:22] world is becoming or has become a global
[1:19:27] village.
[1:19:29] And so the idea is not to have
[1:19:31] everybody, you know, there there isn't a
[1:19:34] great movement of foot to have everybody
[1:19:36] speak Chinese or German or Russian or or
[1:19:39] or English even, even though a lot of
[1:19:42] people want to speak English, it's not
[1:19:44] that so much. But the but the theme of
[1:19:46] what was set up back there, the theme of
[1:19:50] democracy, for example, democracy
[1:19:54] is is like one language. People are
[1:19:57] striving for freedom
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of the age of
[1:20:01] Leodysia is one of people's rights.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And so the spirit that come upon the
[1:20:06] people is causing them to think to say
[1:20:09] the same thing maybe in different
[1:20:11] languages, but they're saying the same
[1:20:13] thing. We want freedom.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; We want control of the people.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; They're saying the same thing
[1:20:20] economically. We want a better life. No
[1:20:23] matter where you go to the hinterlands
[1:20:25] or some jungle or wherever more people
[1:20:28] are striving for a better life because
[1:20:30] we hear about it. We see what other
[1:20:33] people have. We want that also. We want
[1:20:36] a better economy. We want a higher
[1:20:38] standard of living which is what Babel
[1:20:41] was representing. And so in what in that
[1:20:43] sense the nations today of the entire
[1:20:46] earth are similarly speaking the same
[1:20:49] language.
[1:20:51] Very good. Right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Same kind of government, same kind of
[1:20:56] economics, same kind of
[1:21:00] system of religion.
[1:21:05] Now, brother Bram speaks about democracy
[1:21:10] at its best is at its end.
[1:21:15] in hearing, recognizing, acting on the
[1:21:17] word. He said, "Politics, war, politics
[1:21:21] is at the end. Dictators is wrong.
[1:21:25] Politics is wrong. Why didn't they stay
[1:21:28] with the godly king like God give them
[1:21:30] David?"
[1:21:32] The great Lord of England said, "When
[1:21:35] this do democracy was formed," he said,
[1:21:38] in quotation, "It's all right now, but
[1:21:42] it'll come it'll come the time." He
[1:21:44] said, "It'll be nothing. It'll be all
[1:21:47] sales and no anchor." I think we've
[1:21:50] arrived there, don't you?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "And and he's right.
[1:21:56] Politicians stand on soap boxes on every
[1:22:00] corner with all kinds of crooked things
[1:22:03] that corrupt the government." And the
[1:22:05] man was right. That's exactly what's
[1:22:07] going on. In the fifth seal, he goes on
[1:22:09] to say, "Do you see why organized
[1:22:11] systems is wrong? Who started it? Did
[1:22:14] God? Did the apostles? The Roman
[1:22:17] Catholic Church did it.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Now, just let any historian say
[1:22:24] different.
[1:22:25] He said it's not there. They say
[1:22:29] they're the mother church and they are.
[1:22:32] But they organized the thing and put a
[1:22:35] system with man's head to it. We didn't
[1:22:38] take one man like they did. We take the
[1:22:41] whole council of men and put them
[1:22:44] together and then you really got
[1:22:46] confusion. He said it's just like we
[1:22:49] think democracy is right. I believe it
[1:22:51] is too, but it'll never work right.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; So, I hope these things are meaning
[1:22:58] something to you.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] You know, I'm I'm I'm perhaps
[1:23:07] stretching it a wee bit, but I think
[1:23:10] that I think that at the Tower of Babel,
[1:23:12] the seeds of democracy were sewn back
[1:23:14] there.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And the seeds of unity and the seeds of
[1:23:19] a system were sown back there. And that
[1:23:21] is why that reverberates all through the
[1:23:25] scripture right up till right up to this
[1:23:27] time. And he said, 'But it wouldn't work
[1:23:30] right.
[1:23:31] He said, 'It's just like we think
[1:23:33] democracy is right. I believe it is,
[1:23:34] too, but it'll never work right. It
[1:23:36] can't uh with a bunch of rickies around
[1:23:40] it to run it. How in the world are you
[1:23:43] going to get it right? You can't notice
[1:23:45] the real thing is a godly king.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Now, a godly king is a not a democracy,
[1:23:52] but it's a theocracy.
[1:23:55] And a theocracy is a government of a
[1:23:57] state by immediate divine guidance
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; or by officials who are regarded as
[1:24:05] divinely guided.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says a godly king.
[1:24:10] That's the right. And in the millennium,
[1:24:13] you're not going to have a democracy.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; In the millennium, it's not going to be
[1:24:17] the voice of the people. In the
[1:24:19] millennium, it'll be the King of Kings.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And we worship him.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; We have every right to worship him.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; We are now his subjects.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; We already have our passport.
[1:24:35] [Applause]
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; We're already citizens.
[1:24:46] So the second occurrence of God coming
[1:24:49] down and I'll just touch on it.
[1:24:54] This time
[1:24:56] two angel messengers
[1:24:58] sent to Sodom and one remained with
[1:25:01] Adam, I mean with Abraham.
[1:25:04] And he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:25:07] lo, three men stood by him. And when he
[1:25:09] saw them, when he saw them,
[1:25:14] what sayest thou, Abraham?
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Well, when I saw them, I ran.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I ran to them.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:25:26] door and bowed himself to the ground.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And this one that stayed with him said,
[1:25:35] "Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:25:39] At the time appointed,
[1:25:41] I will return.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I will return unto thee according to the
[1:25:47] time of life, and Sarah shall have a
[1:25:50] son. Why shall she have a son? Because
[1:25:53] Abraham had the right response to the
[1:25:56] word that came to him.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And that's how God saw him. That's how
[1:26:01] God viewed him. And when God viewed him
[1:26:04] and saw his response, he said, "You're
[1:26:06] my friend."
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And let me say something, friend. And
[1:26:12] that has never changed.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Abraham was his friend when God regarded
[1:26:17] him as his friend. And that has never
[1:26:19] changed. He's always been his friend.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And when God regarded you redeemed by
[1:26:26] your response to the word of the hour,
[1:26:28] you will ne he'll never change that.
[1:26:33] Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care about your ups and downs. I
[1:26:36] don't care about your failures or the
[1:26:38] weaknesses. That will never change.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he stood and said, "You are
[1:26:43] my redeemed.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; You are my bride. You'll never be
[1:26:48] anything else than the bride of Jesus
[1:26:50] Christ."
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Because the cry of
[1:27:02] Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because
[1:27:06] their sin is very grievous,
[1:27:08] I will go down now and see."
[1:27:13] And when he said, "See,
[1:27:17] I will look at it.
[1:27:20] I will perceive. I will ponder this.
[1:27:24] I will consider it.
[1:27:26] I'll regard it. I'll watch it
[1:27:31] and I'll find out.
[1:27:34] I will appear,
[1:27:36] make my presence known. But it was at a
[1:27:39] different level. And I've said many
[1:27:40] times that God how he comes down.
[1:27:44] He may come down in an angel. He may
[1:27:48] come down himself in the form of an
[1:27:50] angel, which is the angel of the Lord.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; He may come down in a pillar of fire.
[1:27:56] Yes.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He may come down at a certain level of
[1:28:00] intensity so that you you feel awed, you
[1:28:03] feel aruck, you feel humbled, you feel
[1:28:07] broken, you feel unworthy. He can come
[1:28:10] in so many many faceted ways.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And he can come down in such a way to
[1:28:16] turn you speechless.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He can come down with such intensity
[1:28:20] that your breath would leave you
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; and you'd fall into perhaps a trance. He
[1:28:25] can come down with such intensity that
[1:28:28] you couldn't survive
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; physically.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; His holiness is so great. If he came
[1:28:35] here, we would literally evaporate.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; You don't believe that?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; He came down in the form of Jesus
[1:28:44] Christ. John walked with him. John ate
[1:28:47] with him. John slept with him. John laid
[1:28:50] his head upon Christ's bosom. He never
[1:28:52] once fell down as dead.
[1:28:56] He was in the boat with him. He was in
[1:28:58] the judgment hall with him. He lived
[1:29:00] with him for maybe three and a half
[1:29:01] years. Never once fell down. But when he
[1:29:04] saw him in Revelation 1, he fell down as
[1:29:07] a dead one.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's the same one, but a different
[1:29:12] intensity.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So some say, well, Oral Roberts and
[1:29:19] Billy Graham, you say what the prophet
[1:29:21] said. They're messengers
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; and he can come in whatever intensity he
[1:29:26] wants to come.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He can manifest himself in whatever way
[1:29:30] he wants to. One didn't have any signs.
[1:29:32] One didn't pray for the sick. He just
[1:29:34] preached and he was with the presidents
[1:29:36] and he was with the high-profile people
[1:29:38] and played golf with them and all the
[1:29:40] rest of it. That's how God wanted it.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He had to reach a certain level of
[1:29:45] people. He had to say a certain thing
[1:29:47] and blind the people.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And they became blinded because, you
[1:29:52] know, everybody's getting born again.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody's making decisions. But then a
[1:29:57] prophet comes and says, "You have to
[1:29:59] have a master, a master mason to shape
[1:30:02] your decision.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody can make decisions. Multitudes
[1:30:08] can make decisions. But unless God comes
[1:30:11] by an extra measure of grace and shapes
[1:30:14] your decision, It'll never hold.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Help me.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; So God came down
[1:30:29] and to see is also not only to appear
[1:30:32] but it is to present oneself. So God
[1:30:35] presented himself in the form of those
[1:30:38] two angels to the men and women of Sodom
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; and they they responded in a certain
[1:30:46] way.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; They responded according to the spirit
[1:30:49] that was in them
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; and they were destroyed
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; in hellfire and brimstone. Do you
[1:30:55] believe that? Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And scarcely did Lot and his family get
[1:31:02] out and his wife turned to a pillar of
[1:31:04] salt because she looked back to the good
[1:31:06] life.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; To see is to cause to look at intently
[1:31:14] and to behold and to cause to gaze at.
[1:31:19] But to see also
[1:31:21] is to look
[1:31:23] at each other face to face.
[1:31:28] That was his intent.
[1:31:31] Now
[1:31:32] I'm going to digress for a moment, but
[1:31:34] it's it it is it ties completely
[1:31:36] together. So don't become distracted.
[1:31:39] Zachchariah,
[1:31:41] brother Brandham used Amos as the text
[1:31:45] for the way of a true prophet.
[1:31:48] There were some prophets. Brother
[1:31:50] Brandon refers to them as minor
[1:31:51] prophets. We refer to them as minor
[1:31:53] prophets. They weren't I guess we refer
[1:31:56] to them as minor prophets simply because
[1:31:57] their books are small. They didn't
[1:32:00] prophesy very very long or it doesn't
[1:32:02] appear that they did.
[1:32:04] And then major prophets, you know,
[1:32:06] Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and so on.
[1:32:11] But Zachchariah, the prophet
[1:32:13] Zachchariah,
[1:32:15] Zachchariah, he prophesied and made
[1:32:18] statements that were in direct reference
[1:32:22] to the rebuilding of the temple.
[1:32:24] Zachchariah was one that would be
[1:32:27] directly involved in the rebuilding of
[1:32:29] the temple.
[1:32:32] Zachchariah made prophecy and made
[1:32:34] statements which I'll read that referred
[1:32:36] to the first advent, the first coming of
[1:32:39] Christ.
[1:32:40] Zachchariah makes prophecies which refer
[1:32:43] to our time.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And Zachchariah made statements and
[1:32:48] prophecies that refer to after our time.
[1:32:51] Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; For example,
[1:32:57] through Zachchariah, he preached he
[1:33:00] prophesied and said, "For thus saith the
[1:33:02] Lord of hosts,
[1:33:04] after the glory
[1:33:07] after the glory hath he hath he he sent
[1:33:10] me unto the nations which spoiled you,"
[1:33:13] speaking to Israel.
[1:33:15] For he that toucheth you toucheth the
[1:33:18] apple of his eye. So he's telling
[1:33:22] Israel,
[1:33:24] you're the apple of his eye. Even though
[1:33:28] God so sternly spoke against Israel,
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; but he was telling him that they were
[1:33:35] the apple of his eye.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So now in Zachchariah when he he he was
[1:33:42] the one that was and this is a key now.
[1:33:45] Hold this please. Zachchariah was one
[1:33:48] coming out of Babylon.
[1:33:51] Out of Babylon. Don't forget it's tied
[1:33:54] right back to Babel. Now, here is here's
[1:33:56] a prophet and he is a prophet to a
[1:34:00] remnant.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Coming out of Babylon or out of the
[1:34:05] systems.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; So, he's a prophet. He's a remnant. A
[1:34:09] prophet speaking. His prophecies are to
[1:34:12] a remnant.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Just hold that.
[1:34:16] He prophesies concerning Jesus first
[1:34:18] coming. And Jesus his ministry was to a
[1:34:21] remnant.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; He just brought a few out
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; of the old systems.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And what did the scribes and the
[1:34:29] Pharisees says? We have we have Abraham
[1:34:32] to our father. We've got the law. We've
[1:34:35] got the prophets. They had what they had
[1:34:37] was an empty system.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; And Jesus regarded them. You do have
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; the law and the prophets,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; but you Abraham Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:34:48] my day and he saw it.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; What is saying? He saw it, but you're
[1:34:52] not seeing it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; But Zachchariah was to a remnant.
[1:34:59] He prophesied of Jesus. And Jesus went
[1:35:02] to a remnant.
[1:35:04] Zachchariah spoke of our time and a
[1:35:08] messenger that was coming. And don't
[1:35:11] forget, I have so much to say. I hope
[1:35:13] you're following it. And don't forget,
[1:35:15] brother Brandham was not only a prophet.
[1:35:17] He was a sealer.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Not on your behalf,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; on God's behalf.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; So we can say, "Oh prophet, what seeest
[1:35:31] thou?"
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; For you are being directed by Almighty
[1:35:37] God.
[1:35:39] No man gave him the gift.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; No man made him a prophet.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; No man gave him that access to the
[1:35:47] unseen realm.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And so now you have a vessel we could
[1:35:50] say, "What seeest thou?"
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you feel I feel an
[1:36:00] awesome presence. I feel aruck myself. I
[1:36:03] feel a tingling
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; at where we are
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And and and people have missed their
[1:36:11] time and missed their season and missed
[1:36:13] their day. I say, "Oh God, don't let
[1:36:16] Cloverdale Bible way, don't let the
[1:36:17] people who've come under this message,
[1:36:19] don't let us miss our day. Don't let us
[1:36:21] be blinded by the things around us clear
[1:36:24] up our eyesight.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Take away the shades from us. Take away
[1:36:29] the blinders and let us see.
[1:36:33] where we are.
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Let us see the true picture as it is.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; God was saying, he said to Amos, he said
[1:36:43] to uh Zachchariah, he said to others,
[1:36:46] what do you see? I think it would be
[1:36:48] God's prerogative and his own
[1:36:51] he could do it according to his own will
[1:36:53] today. And I feel that he's speaking
[1:36:55] through me,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; saying to you, what do you see?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] I'm glad we've seen what we have seen,
[1:37:04] but I'm not willing to sit back and
[1:37:06] just, you know, be all kind of filled
[1:37:09] with some false emotion that I've seen
[1:37:12] it in Malachi 4 and so on. I want to see
[1:37:14] this God manifesting himself in this
[1:37:18] body, in this life, in this church, in
[1:37:20] this people, in this message.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that too much? No, it's
[1:37:25] not too much.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; How many are in agreement with that? How
[1:37:29] many can say that's what I want to see
[1:37:31] also?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And so Zachchariah,
[1:37:40] he prophesied
[1:37:43] and he was coming to a he was sent to a
[1:37:46] remnant of people spoke of Christ and
[1:37:49] Christ was sent to a remnant of people.
[1:37:52] spoke of this time and actually spoke of
[1:37:55] the ministry of brother Brandham and
[1:37:57] others of the messengers.
[1:37:59] And brother Brandham of all of the seven
[1:38:03] was sent to a remnant.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Come out
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; from among her,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; and be separate, says the Lord.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; What's he doing? He's calling a remnant,
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; a remnant,
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; out of the church.
[1:38:24] Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And when Zachchariah spoke,
[1:38:32] God held the people accountable
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; to the word that came through him.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, I already read the
[1:38:41] scripture to you. God held Israel
[1:38:45] responsible and accountable for the word
[1:38:48] that was spoken through Jesus Christ.
[1:38:50] That's true.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; God established Israel as a nation
[1:38:55] and to achieve his own purpose and will
[1:38:58] in them as one nation of all nations.
[1:39:01] And God is holding, hear me,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; the whole world accountable to the word
[1:39:08] of God that's being fulfilled in that
[1:39:10] nation.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And that's what God's looking at. Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And the and the same message will come
[1:39:21] to 144,000
[1:39:24] and God will hold that nation
[1:39:26] accountable for how they receive the
[1:39:29] word that comes to them.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; So God holds them accountable.
[1:39:37] And Zechariah also says, "Rejoice
[1:39:39] greatly, oh daughter of Zion. Shout, oh
[1:39:42] daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king
[1:39:44] cometh unto thee. He is just, and having
[1:39:47] salvation, lowly, and riding upon an
[1:39:49] ass, and upon the colt, the fall of an
[1:39:51] ass.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; There's the prophecy.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; And now, a messenger to a remnant is
[1:39:59] speaking of another messenger coming.
[1:40:01] And he'll come lowly and humbly, and
[1:40:02] he'll be riding on the f of an ass.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; But he also sent to a remnant
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and only a few would hear him. and he
[1:40:12] was finally only left with 11.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; He comes to the remnant of the Jews of
[1:40:22] the 144,000.
[1:40:25] And here's what Zachchariah says about
[1:40:27] that time. And his feet shall stand in
[1:40:31] that day upon the Mount of Olives, which
[1:40:34] is before Jerusalem on the east. And the
[1:40:36] Mount of Olives shall cleave in the
[1:40:38] midst thereof, toward the east, and
[1:40:41] toward the west. And there shall be a
[1:40:43] great valley, and half of the mountain
[1:40:46] shall remove toward the north, and half
[1:40:48] of it shall remove toward the south.
[1:40:51] Speaking of the time beyond our time,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; when he makes himself known to the
[1:40:57] 144,000.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And so now here we are.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Have to bear with me, please. I I don't
[1:41:04] want to drag this out, but are you
[1:41:05] listening?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; In the message of the token, brother
[1:41:10] Brandham says, "The bride will be the
[1:41:12] remnant, will be the little group
[1:41:15] selected, the predestinated." And I know
[1:41:18] that brother Brandon refers to the
[1:41:19] church as the remnant very often, but in
[1:41:22] this case, I just wanted to identify the
[1:41:24] bride and using the terminology remnant
[1:41:27] as a very, very few.
[1:41:30] Now, Zachcharias prophesies and here I'm
[1:41:33] coming to the main part of my message.
[1:41:35] Excuse me for being so long, but he
[1:41:38] prophesies. Zachchariah prophesies and
[1:41:42] his prophecies encompass
[1:41:45] the church ages and our time. And I
[1:41:48] won't refer to all the church ages, of
[1:41:49] course, but I'll just refer to our time.
[1:41:56] Zechariah 4:10. And brother Brandham,
[1:41:58] I'm going to read where he makes
[1:42:00] reference to this. For who hath despised
[1:42:03] the day of small things?
[1:42:06] For they shall rejoice and you shall see
[1:42:08] the plummet.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; You shall see the plummet
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; in the hand of Zerubbable.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; With these seven,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; they are brother Brandham says they have
[1:42:22] to be men.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. it because it is not you know it
[1:42:27] is it is they are
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; the eyes
[1:42:32] of the Lord.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; They are the eyes of the Lord. What
[1:42:38] seeest thou Lord?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Which run to and fro throughout the
[1:42:44] whole earth?
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Bellingham,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; And Seattle
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; and Edmonton
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; and the rest of Canada. and Chicago and
[1:42:55] Bombay and Durban and Johannesburg and
[1:42:59] all over and Phoenix and Shrefport all
[1:43:02] over. What was it? A meeting. Oh, they
[1:43:04] had a great meeting. I say they had the
[1:43:06] eyes of the Lord running to and fro
[1:43:08] throughout the whole earth to see them
[1:43:10] who would respond positively to the word
[1:43:14] of God.
[1:43:18] And when I saw the word in its intensity
[1:43:20] for healing of the body, the flesh, it
[1:43:23] says, "Oh, well, give me more. Give me
[1:43:25] more." And when he come with the word,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; telling women how to dress, that their
[1:43:31] hair should not be cut, telling men and
[1:43:34] telling preachers and telling ministers
[1:43:36] and telling telling them how they should
[1:43:39] not serve the system, but they should
[1:43:40] serve the word of God. And having
[1:43:42] ministers say, "I know. I know that's
[1:43:44] the word of God, but if they But if I
[1:43:47] preach that they, who's they, the system
[1:43:50] that was set up in Babel will kick me
[1:43:52] out.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm saying?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Is it clear to you?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; There's a message.
[1:44:06] Brother Brandon preaches one service and
[1:44:08] I can't recall just now exactly where it
[1:44:11] is. I think it might have been Phoenix.
[1:44:14] He had so many meetings there
[1:44:18] and it's hard.
[1:44:20] I can feel it coming through the the
[1:44:22] through the voice. I can feel it. I can
[1:44:24] I can actually feel the atmosphere and
[1:44:26] it is so He's preaching hard. He's
[1:44:30] preaching straight.
[1:44:33] He preaches on influence. I believe it
[1:44:35] is one of the influence messages.
[1:44:38] And the place is just quiet. You can
[1:44:41] feel that animosity, that adverse
[1:44:44] adverse against the message, that
[1:44:47] contempt.
[1:44:51] And when he's done,
[1:44:55] he gives an altar call, says, "Is there
[1:44:58] anyone
[1:45:00] that might want to be like
[1:45:03] uh would you like to be like this
[1:45:06] Isaiah?
[1:45:07] You'd like to give your life to Christ?
[1:45:10] Nobody.
[1:45:12] Nobody.
[1:45:13] And he lingers and he goes on and I
[1:45:16] think they're playing something.
[1:45:18] Then he says,
[1:45:20] "All right, here comes a man. God bless
[1:45:24] him."
[1:45:25] Maybe he's like an Isaiah, I believe, is
[1:45:27] what he says. God bless him.
[1:45:33] Now he says
[1:45:36] and that don't forget that angel the
[1:45:38] Lord who's none other than the Lord
[1:45:40] Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; seeing
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; seeing the response of the people and
[1:45:48] that was their response.
[1:45:51] So then
[1:45:53] he began to reveal the secrets of the
[1:45:55] hearts of the people. Never called any
[1:45:56] line just instantly almost
[1:45:59] spontaneously.
[1:46:01] And he begins to call a name and pointed
[1:46:03] down here. Pointed down there. Call that
[1:46:04] name. This is your situation. Your
[1:46:06] situation yours this Mr. so and so,
[1:46:09] sister so and so. This woman here, that
[1:46:11] woman there, that man over there, that
[1:46:13] man there. Call their name. And then the
[1:46:14] whole place just came alive.
[1:46:17] Now he says, "Now I wonder how many
[1:46:21] need the Holy Ghost. I wonder how many."
[1:46:24] And the place just flocked.
[1:46:26] He said, "Now there's probably 200
[1:46:28] here."
[1:46:30] He said, "I did that to show you that
[1:46:33] you're deceived."
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Why are they deceived? Because they were
[1:46:40] ready to They would not wander. They
[1:46:42] would not respond to the word,
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; but they responded to the sign, to the
[1:46:47] emotion. They responded to healing.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; That's not it, folks. It had to go from
[1:46:52] a first on the second blow. It had to
[1:46:54] We're not children of that. We're
[1:46:56] children of the word of God, being born
[1:47:00] again, of the incorruptible seed of God.
[1:47:05] How thankful we are that God gave you a
[1:47:08] revelation of the promise of God and you
[1:47:10] responded to that.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You can say today, I saw that
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; I saw him
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; in all of his beauty.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; I saw him
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; with those seven. They are the eyes of
[1:47:32] the Lord that run to and fro.
[1:47:36] In the message of grace, brother
[1:47:38] Brandham reads this scripture from
[1:47:41] Zachchariah.
[1:47:43] And the angel that talked with me
[1:47:47] talked with me again and wake me as a
[1:47:49] man that is wakened out of his sleep.
[1:47:53] And he said unto me, here it is to
[1:47:55] Zachchariah. What seeest thou?
[1:47:58] And I said, I've looked, and behold, a
[1:48:00] candlestick all of gold, and a bowl upon
[1:48:03] the top of it, and his seven lamps
[1:48:06] thereon, and seven pipes of the seven
[1:48:09] lamps which are upon the top of it. And
[1:48:12] two olive trees by it, one upon the
[1:48:15] right side, one upon, and the other on
[1:48:18] the left side thereof. So I answered and
[1:48:21] spite to the angel that talked with me,
[1:48:23] saying, "What are these, my Lord?"
[1:48:27] And the angel that talked with me
[1:48:29] answered and said unto me, Knowest thou
[1:48:31] not what these be? And I said, "No, my
[1:48:33] Lord." Then he answered and spake unto
[1:48:36] me, saying, This is the spirit. This is
[1:48:39] the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel,
[1:48:42] saying, Not by might, not by power, but
[1:48:46] by my spirit, saith the Lord. Who art
[1:48:50] thou? Oh, listen very close. Who art
[1:48:53] thou, oh great mountain before
[1:48:56] Zerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain.
[1:49:00] It's amazing. It's similar words to
[1:49:02] Isaiah's words
[1:49:04] concerning John the Baptist.
[1:49:07] Every hill will be made
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; as a plane.
[1:49:13] Who art thou, oh great mountain before
[1:49:15] Zerubable? Thou shalt become a plain and
[1:49:18] he shall bring forth and he shall bring
[1:49:21] forth the headstone thereof with
[1:49:24] shouting crying grace grace unto it.
[1:49:28] Brother Brandham says we and we know
[1:49:30] that this was during the time of the
[1:49:34] preparation
[1:49:35] of the restoration of the temple.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hold on to that. I'm not reading
[1:49:42] anything but this came at the time of
[1:49:44] the preparation of the restoration of
[1:49:48] the temple and Zerubabel was a great
[1:49:51] prince brother Brandon speaking now
[1:49:53] amongst the people who had laid the
[1:49:56] foundation of the building. He was one
[1:49:59] that came to a remnant. He's at uh at a
[1:50:03] time of rebuilding the temple
[1:50:06] of the nation for the nation with a
[1:50:09] remnant of people coming out of Babylon.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I want you I want you to
[1:50:21] put on your spiritual thinking. And I am
[1:50:24] praying that God will give every person
[1:50:28] within the sound of my voice at this
[1:50:31] moment a Holy Ghost divine portion of
[1:50:35] spiritual thinking.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Anointing
[1:50:42] anointing jacket this morning as we
[1:50:44] think. And this great prince had
[1:50:48] determined to rebuild the house of the
[1:50:50] Lord. And then when he did, he had laid
[1:50:54] the foundation stone.
[1:50:56] And as we read on further, we find out
[1:50:59] that God said, "Zerubbable hath laid the
[1:51:02] foundation with his hands. He also shall
[1:51:06] bring forth the headstone." He said, "I
[1:51:08] want you to notice he never said he
[1:51:11] shall bring forth the cornerstone. He
[1:51:13] shall bring forth the headstone."
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; So he who laid the foundation will bring
[1:51:18] forth the headstone. He says, "And we
[1:51:21] know the scripture says that Jesus is
[1:51:24] the chief cornerstone and he is also the
[1:51:27] head stone." Now, if you will think for
[1:51:32] a few minutes that the seventh church
[1:51:35] age messenger, these seven are the eyes
[1:51:39] of the Lord. that the seventh church age
[1:51:42] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:51:46] the children back to the fathers. In
[1:51:50] other words, and he gives it a different
[1:51:52] phrase now.
[1:51:54] In other words, rebuild the church again
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; under the power of the spirit.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whoever was speaking through
[1:52:08] Zachchariah,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; making reference to Zerubbabel and he
[1:52:12] laid the foundation stone, he said, he
[1:52:15] that laid the foundation stone shall
[1:52:17] bring the headstone.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And comes and now the messenger to the
[1:52:24] remnant of the gentile age while they're
[1:52:27] making preparations to rebuild the
[1:52:30] temple. Here comes the last messenger
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and he is a sea. Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Not merely a preacher.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Not only a prophet,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; But a seer prophet.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; One who saw.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; I couldn't even go through the times
[1:52:53] because there's hundreds. It's into the
[1:52:55] hundreds of times that he made
[1:52:57] reference. I see. I see you coming. I
[1:53:01] see you in this situation. I see. But he
[1:53:04] saw other things as well. And now we
[1:53:06] have a messenger coming at the time when
[1:53:10] the capstone who talked about the
[1:53:11] capstone who talked about the headstone.
[1:53:14] This messenger talked about it because
[1:53:16] it was his ministry.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; That's your time.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; That's where you're living today sitting
[1:53:26] in this church. But this is your day.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah prophesied of your time.
[1:53:35] And the same one that laid the
[1:53:37] foundation brings the headstone.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if you'll catch it,"
[1:53:44] that's why he warned the people, "Put on
[1:53:46] your thinking jacket now. Pinch your
[1:53:49] conscience cuz the same one." And he
[1:53:52] says, "And and and the seventh messenger
[1:53:55] is to restore the faith of the children
[1:53:58] back to the faith of the fathers." In
[1:54:00] other words, rebuild again
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; the temple of God
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; the spiritual temple of God.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; We've lived to see it.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; We've lived to be part of it.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; We've lived to be part of this temple.
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing could be plainer.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Nothing could be more clear.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; It's just sits and sewing all the way
[1:54:26] through.
[1:54:30] The seventh messenger was to restore the
[1:54:33] faith of the children back to the
[1:54:35] fathers. In other words, rebuild the
[1:54:37] church again under the power of the
[1:54:40] spirit and then quotes the scripture
[1:54:42] from Zachchariah. Not by might, not by
[1:54:45] power, not by might, but by my spirit,
[1:54:48] sayith the lord. And then he puts other
[1:54:50] language to that. Not by organization
[1:54:53] and not by denomination.
[1:54:55] Hallelujah. what he's saying. It's not
[1:54:58] by Babel.
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; It's not by the organization of the
[1:55:04] city. And God came down to see the city.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; He came down to see where democracy got
[1:55:10] them. He came down to see where the
[1:55:12] man-made unity got them. He's come down
[1:55:15] in this time to see where the ecumenical
[1:55:17] system has gone. And they have, and I
[1:55:19] have quotes on it, they've rejected the
[1:55:21] word.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He uses, he said, they turned it down.
[1:55:26] And he preached it clear, but they
[1:55:27] turned it down. And God was there
[1:55:30] looking through those prophets eyes as a
[1:55:33] seer to see their response.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; And they rejected to accept death.
[1:55:48] He says, "Not by organization and not by
[1:55:51] denomination, but by the Holy Spirit,
[1:55:54] God will bring forth the church in these
[1:55:56] last days." You know why you're here?
[1:55:59] Because God has brought you here by the
[1:56:02] power of the Holy Spirit in these last
[1:56:04] days. And without that, you couldn't
[1:56:06] even be here. Without that, you'd have
[1:56:09] nothing in you that would pull you to
[1:56:11] it.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And if you're here just a visitor, if
[1:56:14] you're here just as an observer, if
[1:56:16] you're here that has just come along and
[1:56:18] been kind of riding the fence, I would
[1:56:20] say to you, this is not a time
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; to be sitting on the fence. This is not
[1:56:24] a time your life is wasting away. Your
[1:56:27] time is going away. Your breath is
[1:56:28] leaving you. This is the time to say,
[1:56:30] "Oh, God,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; let whatever this pastor is preaching
[1:56:34] about today, let it be a reality within
[1:56:36] me.
[1:56:38] Hallelujah.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Now he explains
[1:56:47] the very act of restoring listen now.
[1:56:49] The very act of restoring the faith of
[1:56:52] the children back to the fathers is the
[1:56:55] same event not another one. It's not a
[1:56:57] likeness. It's the same event of the
[1:57:00] rebuilding of the church again
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; under the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:57:07] He says to begin with Sardisian church
[1:57:09] age to begin with he said we know for
[1:57:12] certainty that these verses are not
[1:57:16] teaching a new contrary doctrine to John
[1:57:19] 4:24
[1:57:21] God is one spirit
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; going to draw to a close now soon but he
[1:57:28] said but this is like 1 Corinthians 128
[1:57:31] and 11 to 11
[1:57:34] wherein we find one spirit manifesting
[1:57:37] himself in nine ways, the gifts of the
[1:57:40] Holy Spirit,
[1:57:42] the nine gifts. He said, "Thus we know
[1:57:44] that the seven spirits of God mean that
[1:57:47] it is the one and same spirit coming
[1:57:52] forth in a sevenfold way." Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation 4:5, the same seven
[1:58:00] spirits are called lamps of fire burning
[1:58:04] before the Lord. And since John always
[1:58:08] used nothing but the Old Testament
[1:58:10] symbols of the revelation in the
[1:58:13] revelation, he says, "We go to the Old
[1:58:15] Testament and we find from Proverbs 27
[1:58:17] that the spirit of man is called the
[1:58:19] lamp of the Lord.
[1:58:21] These seven spirits are found to be
[1:58:23] associated with man.
[1:58:26] John the Baptist was John 5:35 was
[1:58:30] called a burning light which should
[1:58:33] actually be translated as a burning
[1:58:35] lamp. And again, Revelation 5 and 6, the
[1:58:39] seven spirits are identified with as
[1:58:42] seven eyes.
[1:58:46] And I behold, and lo, Revelation 3:5-6
[1:58:49] rather, I beheld and lo in the midst of
[1:58:52] the throne and in and of the four
[1:58:54] beasts. And in the midst of the elders
[1:58:56] stood a lamb as it had been slain. This
[1:58:59] is him taking the book. Now,
[1:59:02] as it had been slain, having seven
[1:59:04] horns, the lamb that John turned to see
[1:59:07] the lion, and you've heard it so many,
[1:59:09] many times of different preachers within
[1:59:11] the message. And he turns to he says,
[1:59:13] "Weep not John, for the lion of the
[1:59:15] tribe of Judah prevailed to loose the
[1:59:17] seals." And he turns to see the lion and
[1:59:19] the steady he sees a lamb.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Now the lamb has
[1:59:27] seven horns.
[1:59:30] Horns is always power.
[1:59:34] and seven eyes
[1:59:37] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:59:40] forth into all the earth.
[1:59:44] And Zachchariah said this just so you
[1:59:46] remember. And who despised a small day
[1:59:48] of small things? You talk about small
[1:59:50] things.
[1:59:53] 11 men, 11 apostles. That was a small
[1:59:56] thing.
[1:59:58] Only reduced to 11 and a few women. And
[2:00:00] then finally 120 were in the upper room.
[2:00:03] That was a very small thing with the
[2:00:05] population of the earth. But now the
[2:00:07] earth when this prophecy of Zerubbabel
[2:00:10] came or prophecy of Zachchariah rather
[2:00:12] came to this time as one man
[2:00:16] a grade seven education
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; raised in poverty
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; in nowhere
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; in Kentucky
[2:00:25] and God sets his spirit upon him and
[2:00:29] anoints that gift that had been given
[2:00:31] him. He was born a prophet.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't know what it was.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; He went to the wilderness. He went to
[2:00:38] the cave. It was driving him to a
[2:00:42] nervous state. And he heard voices.
[2:00:47] Heard the Lord speak in the trees, in
[2:00:49] the leaves, in the wind, in a strange
[2:00:53] life you talk about. And there's a few
[2:00:55] billion people by that time, maybe four
[2:00:58] billion, I don't know,
[2:01:01] a few billion people on earth. You talk
[2:01:03] about not despising. I can tell you one
[2:01:06] thing, God was not despising the day of
[2:01:10] small beginnings.
[2:01:12] And even eventually on one occasion when
[2:01:16] we we just came together up in northern
[2:01:18] British Columbia and he said I I stopped
[2:01:21] by Oral Roberts on the way up here. Oh
[2:01:25] my. He said,
[2:01:29] he said that, you know, they got that
[2:01:31] hospital and his offices and the
[2:01:34] aluminum ceiling and he was trying to
[2:01:36] describe, you know, the architecture and
[2:01:39] oh, he said, you know, he said that
[2:01:42] drive me crazy to try to run something
[2:01:44] like that. Said it just he didn't have a
[2:01:46] bad thing, didn't have a negative thing.
[2:01:48] He just said that's not the way, you
[2:01:50] know, God led me. He said he you hear
[2:01:52] it. He says, "My office, I've seen it.
[2:01:55] one little one little desk like a
[2:01:59] child's
[2:02:01] desk for doing homework
[2:02:04] and and when I stepped in his office had
[2:02:07] another chair in his chair there only
[2:02:09] two chairs
[2:02:12] and everything else was bare
[2:02:14] but what came out of that office
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; nothing less than the word of God
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; and the messenger There was nothing less
[2:02:25] than the eyes of God.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; A seer in the end time.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; What do you need to see? What seeest
[2:02:33] thou,
[2:02:36] Father God? What do you see?
[2:02:39] In Amos's time, you saw people
[2:02:43] glamorous,
[2:02:45] living the good life.
[2:02:48] This is what God was interested in.
[2:02:51] You want to see their response to the
[2:02:53] word that he brought through the way of
[2:02:55] a true prophet.
[2:03:00] Can I have just a few more minutes and
[2:03:02] I'm going to close whether I'm done or
[2:03:05] whether I'm not done.
[2:03:07] Says with those seven,
[2:03:10] they are the eyes of the Lord
[2:03:15] people.
[2:03:19] We've been viewed. I I I've been
[2:03:21] pondering this very deep.
[2:03:24] God took the vessel
[2:03:27] and the intensity of that vessel, the
[2:03:30] intensity of the presence of the Lord in
[2:03:33] the presence of brother Brandham. go
[2:03:35] back and see Deep called the Deep and
[2:03:37] you'll see the woman coming and standing
[2:03:42] and she's standing like this
[2:03:45] and then she reaches out to steady
[2:03:47] herself
[2:03:49] at the pulpit
[2:03:51] and he says to her, "Don't worry, that
[2:03:54] won't hurt you."
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; That's not me, that's him.
[2:04:02] He says other places you should see the
[2:04:05] faces of the people
[2:04:08] when an evil spirit is in a person and
[2:04:12] comes in contact with that power and
[2:04:14] that presence said their face will begin
[2:04:17] to their throat begin to throb
[2:04:21] visually
[2:04:23] changing the the the
[2:04:26] appearance
[2:04:28] because they simply have come into the
[2:04:30] presence. I tell you my brother, my
[2:04:32] sister,
[2:04:34] just to think that you
[2:04:38] and I have come under that gaze
[2:04:44] and I know what that gaze is a little
[2:04:46] bit about. But I will tell you that you
[2:04:48] no less than myself.
[2:04:50] We have all come under that gaze.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] What a glorious, marvelous thing this
[2:05:00] morning
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; to think that you've passed under that
[2:05:03] gaze
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; and have him say you're mine.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Something happened to me today. It's
[2:05:18] never happened in my life.
[2:05:22] And I started to write it down
[2:05:26] and I couldn't write it the way and I
[2:05:29] started to change it and I couldn't
[2:05:31] change it. He said, "Say it."
[2:05:35] I've preached here many times over many
[2:05:38] years.
[2:05:39] And I have seen visually
[2:05:43] people rejoicing, people receiving,
[2:05:46] people accepting. But unfortunately,
[2:05:48] I've also seen physically where people
[2:05:51] are just disdaining the word.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear that word. They
[2:05:57] don't want to hear what's being said.
[2:05:59] And God said to me this morning, I was
[2:06:02] looking through your eyes.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't you that was determining that.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; You saw that because I was looking
[2:06:15] through your eyes.
[2:06:18] And I said, "Oh, God."
[2:06:21] And actually, to be honest with you,
[2:06:23] he's looking through your eyes. The
[2:06:26] bride of Jesus Christ is not merely the
[2:06:29] voice of God in this end time, but the
[2:06:33] eyes of God. He's looking through your
[2:06:36] eyes and you see things and it
[2:06:39] disappoints you. It disgusts you. It
[2:06:43] disheartens you. It saddens you. You
[2:06:47] become burdened and you start feeling as
[2:06:51] Marilyn said inspired in her song said,
[2:06:54] "I don't feel welcome here anymore."
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Is that how you are?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; The eyes of the Lord go to and fro
[2:07:06] throughout the whole earth. That's why
[2:07:09] you look you look upon your
[2:07:13] friends, your peers, your children, your
[2:07:15] family. You look upon them
[2:07:19] not to bring a condemnation to them, but
[2:07:23] you look upon them and you have a
[2:07:24] different a whole different vision
[2:07:27] because it's not the merely these
[2:07:29] faculties that are in here, but it is
[2:07:32] something that's inside and you actually
[2:07:34] see things. You see it different. You
[2:07:37] have a completely different balance, a
[2:07:40] different understanding completely. And
[2:07:43] he says that they are the he said they
[2:07:47] are the eyes of the Lord. He said it
[2:07:49] refers to man,
[2:07:54] the messenger
[2:07:56] as a seer.
[2:07:59] He saw what was.
[2:08:02] He saw what what what had been. He saw
[2:08:06] what was taking place and he saw the
[2:08:08] future.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; And here's some of the things
[2:08:13] because I don't have time,
[2:08:15] but here's some of the things. And
[2:08:18] you've you've you have access to this,
[2:08:22] but he said,
[2:08:24] "I see the spirit of Hollywood."
[2:08:29] I wonder if this congregation has had
[2:08:31] those eyes.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Have you seen the spirit of Hollywood?
[2:08:37] He said, "I see the spirit of the world.
[2:08:42] I see the spirit of glamour."
[2:08:46] He says, "I've been 15 years preaching
[2:08:48] against it and it just worsens all the
[2:08:50] time. I can see it and I see the spirit
[2:08:54] there." But where is the spirit of God
[2:08:58] that can grasp God? that can recognize
[2:09:01] the word itself when it's being made
[2:09:05] manifest to recognize the truth.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; But then he said, I see the word is the
[2:09:12] absolute.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to respond today.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; You've seen the word, but have you seen
[2:09:19] the word to its depth of being the
[2:09:21] absolute?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; The absolute.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Got to go back to the absolute. Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; I see the word not just Malachi 4 and
[2:09:39] Luke 17:30 and Revelation or whatever
[2:09:42] more. It's not just some, you know, it's
[2:09:44] not just some doctrines. It didn't just
[2:09:46] say I see the doctrines
[2:09:48] or I see certain truths or I always
[2:09:51] agreed with that. That's not the point.
[2:09:54] That's not the revelation. The
[2:09:55] revelation is I see the word as the
[2:09:58] absolute in my life
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; and that never changes
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; because I've just spoken even I and my
[2:10:05] wife sitting at home speaking about this
[2:10:08] very thing not because I'm preaching and
[2:10:09] she doesn't know what I'm preaching this
[2:10:11] morning never we don't discuss it but
[2:10:14] we've been talking about the absolute in
[2:10:16] our lives what God would have us to do.
[2:10:19] We're not young people but we're always
[2:10:21] seeking to know what God will have us to
[2:10:23] do. We need God's thoughts, not man's
[2:10:28] thoughts.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; We don't need a system. We need the Holy
[2:10:33] Ghost.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; We don't even need the formality of a
[2:10:36] meeting. We need the hundreds of people
[2:10:38] that are here to be lost in God.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Be a praying people.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to say amen to
[2:10:49] God's word.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:55] Glory to God.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; I know what meetings are like when they
[2:11:00] came out of the hands of man.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; I've seen people stand and worship God
[2:11:11] lost
[2:11:13] in the spirit of God. And back then they
[2:11:16] didn't have the message. They didn't
[2:11:17] have the word to anchor them. But there
[2:11:20] was something within them that they
[2:11:22] wanted to worship God. I've seen them
[2:11:25] stand for an hour and a half.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; You're quiet.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Is there anything wrong with it?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Is God worthy of an hour and a half of
[2:11:33] worship? I say he is.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Let the roast burn.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Let the reservation at the at the
[2:11:43] restaurant,
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; let us forget it.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; People lost in God
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; and out of the control of human hands.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I'd like to preach on it. I don't know
[2:12:04] if I'll get to it, but brother Brandham
[2:12:06] says, "All I do, I just yield."
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Yield. If there ever was a time when God
[2:12:13] needed a people to learn how to yield.
[2:12:16] Just yield to God instead of being
[2:12:19] conscious about who's next to us and
[2:12:21] who's here and what kind of person I am.
[2:12:24] Forget what kind of person you are.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so stayed and so
[2:12:30] right and so correct that we miss the
[2:12:33] the the moving of the Holy Spirit. We've
[2:12:36] got the word. We say amen to the word. I
[2:12:40] tell you what friends, this place can't
[2:12:42] really
[2:12:43] we can't even do justice to the truth as
[2:12:47] as little as the truth is that I preach
[2:12:49] this morning. We can't do justice to the
[2:12:51] even the single truth that the eyes of
[2:12:53] God have passed through this age, this
[2:12:57] time that you and I are living in. The
[2:12:59] eyes of God passed through your little
[2:13:02] circle of endeavor or your life at some
[2:13:05] point in some time where you worked,
[2:13:08] where you lived. the eyes of God to say,
[2:13:10] "Oh, someone handed a a message into my
[2:13:12] hand.
[2:13:14] Someone handed a book into my hand.
[2:13:17] I heard someone preach.
[2:13:19] Someone spoke and witnessed to me."
[2:13:22] I want you to see it different than you
[2:13:25] ever saw it before.
[2:13:28] Listen to this statement. This God that
[2:13:32] was with the prophet of God that caused
[2:13:35] him to be a seer, that God has never
[2:13:39] left this message.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Has never left it.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Has never left it. He won't leave it for
[2:13:47] a moment. It's his word.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; He is actually the spirit. He is
[2:13:50] actually the life and force of that
[2:13:53] word. And so he hovers right beside it.
[2:13:56] And when someone handed that book to
[2:13:58] you, Brother Roy, or someone talked to
[2:14:00] you, the eyes of God were right there to
[2:14:02] see what was going to be the response.
[2:14:05] And you said, "Amen."
[2:14:07] [Applause]
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; And God said, "That's it."
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's what my elect say.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what my child says.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's what my seed says.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; They say, "Amen."
[2:14:24] They can't help it.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; It's a part of them. It's in them.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's like a hand fitting into a glove.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; They can't say anything else.
[2:14:35] [Applause]
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The eyes of the Lord
[2:14:44] running to and fro throughout the whole
[2:14:46] earth saw what you your response.
[2:14:54] Don't ever be moved from that.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Then who cares what happens in life?
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Be it life or death, health or sickness.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Wealth or pop or popularity or none at
[2:15:09] all. That has nothing to do with it.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:18] And the prophet said
[2:15:20] I see the word.
[2:15:23] I can say yes
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; messenger.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Prophet seer. I see the word also.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; I have the same eyesight.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I see the word. I see the pillar of fire
[2:15:37] moving.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I wish I saw more of it. But I have
[2:15:40] actually seen the glory of God come upon
[2:15:43] a person and I knew the thing they were
[2:15:45] asking for was done.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Finished.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; There's a man standing right there.
[2:15:58] Brother Roger Camper, if you would
[2:16:00] stand.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; There was a brother, Brother Roger won't
[2:16:05] mind.
[2:16:07] He was bound
[2:16:10] hopelessly bound by cigarettes
[2:16:13] and with a spirit of depression
[2:16:16] after he received this word. He sat
[2:16:18] right down here. I remember the meeting.
[2:16:21] I remember the morning and I literally
[2:16:24] saw the word of God come directly to him
[2:16:27] and I knew at that instant he was free.
[2:16:29] And as I'd been sober, brother of the
[2:16:30] Roger.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We need to rejoice.
[2:16:38] We need to rejoice in that as though it
[2:16:40] happened 5 minutes ago.
[2:16:42] What is it? It's a pillar of fire. The
[2:16:45] same one that caused a cancer to drop
[2:16:47] causes that demon to be loosed from him
[2:16:50] and drive him out of that temple and the
[2:16:53] Holy Ghost moves in says this is my
[2:16:55] temple.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you are temple of the
[2:16:58] Holy Ghost. Brother Roger, don't ever
[2:17:01] let the devil ever say anything. We are
[2:17:03] temples of God.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:17:08] Tell you what, friends, I feel a long
[2:17:09] ways from closing this service.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I feel that God wants to do things even
[2:17:13] right now. You'll receive the word,
[2:17:16] receive the promise.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; But the eyes of the Lord are going to
[2:17:22] and fro throughout the whole earth. This
[2:17:24] the eyes of the Lord is going through
[2:17:26] this service,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; this gathering of people at this time to
[2:17:30] see what your response is to this
[2:17:32] message.
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:41] Hallelujah.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; I've never remember reading this before.
[2:17:57] I guess I must have been in a meeting.
[2:18:00] The prophet's preaching in his eye, be
[2:18:02] not afraid.
[2:18:04] And he said, 'I want to make it a little
[2:18:06] drama in the testimony.
[2:18:08] How many times how how many likes
[2:18:10] testimonies? He asked. He said, "Brother
[2:18:13] Eddie told me."
[2:18:15] And he said, 'You know, brother
[2:18:16] Brandham,
[2:18:18] after the meetings are over out there,
[2:18:21] he said, "My Indian brethren said that
[2:18:25] they'll get together and start
[2:18:26] testifying
[2:18:28] and a meeting will break up right out
[2:18:31] among them and they'll go over." He
[2:18:35] said, "Then they quieten down and after
[2:18:38] a while then somebody else get up and
[2:18:40] testify and out breaks the meeting
[2:18:42] again." And he said, "They just stay
[2:18:46] there." And as long as the spirit's
[2:18:48] there, they stay. He said, "That's real
[2:18:52] good, sound philosophy, not philosophy,
[2:18:56] but good sense." He said, "It's the
[2:18:59] staying with the spirit." He said, you
[2:19:01] know, wherever the spirit of God moved,
[2:19:03] the pillar of fire, wherever it moved,
[2:19:06] then the children of Israel went with
[2:19:08] it. I say, I want to go. I don't
[2:19:11] necessarily want to follow my neighbor.
[2:19:13] I don't want to follow what my wife has
[2:19:15] planned today. I don't want to follow
[2:19:17] anybody. I want to follow the pillar of
[2:19:18] fire. As long as you want to do
[2:19:20] something here, God, I'm with you.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want manled
[2:19:28] meetings. We want God meetings.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Come, oh Lord.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; How glad I am. And I want you to be able
[2:19:38] to rejoice. How glad I am that those
[2:19:40] eyes
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; of this word of this Christ looked upon
[2:19:46] us
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; with love
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; mercy
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; and grace
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; and I don't care
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; what the cost but whatever is truth
[2:20:00] now say as Mary said what he saith unto
[2:20:04] you do it.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; This is an area of your life and there
[2:20:12] isn't anybody here but what we could
[2:20:14] there's could be things that could
[2:20:16] change and I'm saying oh God speak
[2:20:20] oh God speak to us. This is my cry this
[2:20:24] morning. Speak oh Lord
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; is anybody here away from God? Anybody
[2:20:28] here in a backsliden state? I would not
[2:20:31] go out those doors in that condition.
[2:20:33] And I would give myself unreservedly in
[2:20:36] my seat right there or down here at the
[2:20:38] wherever it is. But I would make it
[2:20:40] right with God.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; I want to have a communion service soon.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; I want to see some things happen before
[2:20:50] we have that communion service
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; take place. Want to see God move.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that may be a-ok okay with
[2:20:58] the public or a-ok okay with someone
[2:21:00] else out there. doesn't necessarily have
[2:21:02] to be okay within the spirit of God. We
[2:21:05] need to remove all the all the debris.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Get rid of all the stuff.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Get rid of all the garbage. As brother
[2:21:13] Brandham said, don't keep living on the
[2:21:15] dump out there.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; We're having a service. What do you see?
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Just a bunch of emotion. No, I don't see
[2:21:25] it. I see the word.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I see the Holy Spirit
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; striking our hearts.
[2:21:32] Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; I believe when a man or woman is born of
[2:21:38] the spirit of God, that's it.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; It's not up and down, in and out.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; I'm closing with this. I've been 10
[2:21:48] minutes over my time now.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see the sign of the end."
[2:21:53] And and and and as as as I as I quote
[2:21:56] what he sees, if you see it, I want you
[2:22:00] to respond to it. He said, "I see the
[2:22:02] sign of the end time is here."
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Mind, that was few.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; About six or eight people.
[2:22:11] The prophet of God, the eyes of God,
[2:22:15] the eyes were in the horns
[2:22:18] said, "I see the sign of the end time is
[2:22:21] here." And I say, "Amen."
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; I see things as promised for this end
[2:22:26] time message coming to pass unfolding
[2:22:29] just exactly like the scripture said.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; And I know that the time is at hand. For
[2:22:36] I see the signs that he said would
[2:22:38] happen just before the time it's ready
[2:22:40] to happen now.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; And he asks a question. What do you see
[2:22:47] when you see him?
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:52] said, "I see the same healer.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; We need him.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; We need him."
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; I got a little great granddaughter's not
[2:23:04] walking properly.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; And she needs something to take place.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; She needs a different signal in the
[2:23:12] brain and needs her muscles to be
[2:23:14] strengthened.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctors say.
[2:23:18] I don't care what the symptoms say.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; This is what God's eyes have said.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; What do you see when you see him? I see
[2:23:27] a healer.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; You see a healer.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; You're here in some situation, some
[2:23:35] condition you've put up with. See a
[2:23:37] healer.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Receive it.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Mental depression. Deny that devil.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing as manic
[2:23:59] depressive. That's something invented by
[2:24:01] the world.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Deny him, friends.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Deny him.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; You need an anchor in your life. Receive
[2:24:09] it now.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; When I see him,
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; what do you see?
[2:24:17] said, "I see a healer."
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I see the same one that
[2:24:23] walked here in Galilee."
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; I see the same one.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; There's no difference whatsoever. I see
[2:24:30] the same one that walked here in
[2:24:32] Galilee. Do you see it, my young
[2:24:34] brothers?
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Do you see it, my friends?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Do you see it, believers in Jesus name?
[2:24:40] Hallelujah. Do you see the same one?
[2:24:42] He's not there somewhere else. He's
[2:24:44] here, here, present. He's with this
[2:24:46] word. We are believers of the message.
[2:24:48] He will never leave that message.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; And that is why he said to the disciples
[2:24:53] and many many people quote it, but he
[2:24:55] said to the disciples, "I will never
[2:24:57] leave you."
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Because he cannot leave the word they
[2:25:01] receive.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see it? Do you see
[2:25:07] what I'm saying?
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; He can never leave the word.
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:15] Hallelujah.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Millions heard,
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; millions received healing.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; The secrets of hearts were revealed of
[2:25:23] millions of people perhaps.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; And they will say the same scripture.
[2:25:29] He'll never leave me nor forsake me. And
[2:25:31] I say, God bless them for that. But what
[2:25:34] Jesus is talking about is the word that
[2:25:36] went from his mouth. I will never leave
[2:25:39] that word.
[2:25:41] Amen.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; And that's how God sees.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; That's how God looks upon this
[2:25:46] generation. That's how he looks upon us.
[2:25:48] None of us are beyond that eyesight.
[2:25:51] [Applause]
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I say, "Shine on me.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Look on me, oh God.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Look on me.
[2:26:05] Whatever there is that is unlike you,
[2:26:08] then send a divine fire.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of the fire, let it burn
[2:26:14] up.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; How many here need something that need
[2:26:17] to be removed.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; You don't need to wait for another day.
[2:26:20] You need to have it right now.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; You need to say, "I accept this message.
[2:26:25] I accept this word. I accept this time.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; This thing has no business in my mind.
[2:26:31] It has no business in my spirit. It has
[2:26:34] no business in my whole life.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; I deny it.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; I'm under the eyesight of Almighty God.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; You go into communion with him.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with me. You go into
[2:26:59] communion with him. You talk to him.
[2:27:02] Forget who's around you. Forget the
[2:27:04] service.
[2:27:06] [Applause]
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Break this mold. Break this mold.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Break this mold. Put aside your
[2:27:14] inhibitor. What your What inhibits you?
[2:27:17] Put it aside.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've never called out upon
[2:27:21] him. Then call upon him.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; I've never raised my voice. Raise your
[2:27:25] voice.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; I've never raised my hand. Raise your
[2:27:27] hand.
[2:27:31] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Lance is speaking tonight.
[2:39:07] We don't want to just come to services.
[2:39:12] How was the age of some of you fellas
[2:39:14] right here?
[2:39:16] 14
[2:39:18] and 12 years old.
[2:39:21] And the meeting started in the morning
[2:39:23] and by midafter afternoon I was so
[2:39:25] hungry and other young people were so
[2:39:27] hungry but we didn't want to leave to go
[2:39:30] and get a sandwich for fear we would
[2:39:32] miss something
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; that God was doing
[2:39:37] friends. It's the same Holy Spirit.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in the buffet and
[2:39:43] Earls and all the other or Tim Hortons
[2:39:46] and stuff that's just part of this life.
[2:39:49] We have enough just to get us through.
[2:39:51] But he's interested in what he's seeing.
[2:39:53] Your response to the word. There ever
[2:39:56] was a respon. Respond to his word.
[2:39:59] Respond to his word. Don't leave it for
[2:40:00] another day. It won't be easier
[2:40:02] tomorrow. That's a lie of the devil.
[2:40:04] Don't leave it till tomorrow. This is
[2:40:06] the hour. This is the time.
[2:40:09] [Applause]
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could ask a brother up here in the
[2:40:18] balcony. Brother white shirt. I'm sorry.
[2:40:20] Just after all this preaching, my
[2:40:24] memory has failed to just call on your
[2:40:26] name. I wonder if you'd come down and
[2:40:27] pray. Brother's a minister also.
[2:40:33] Hallelujah.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Let's be an expectation. Amen.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; We don't know what God is going to say
[2:40:40] to us tonight. But one thing for sure,
[2:40:42] when he speaks, the man of God behind
[2:40:45] the pulpit, when he speaks,
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; he's looking.
[2:40:49] Just remember that your response. That's
[2:40:52] what he's looking. That's his eyes. He's
[2:40:54] looking on that. Amen.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; And I'd sooner be more eager than more
[2:40:59] stayed
[2:41:01] and more, you know, formal.
[2:41:04] I' I I'd sooner I I'd sooner be Peter
[2:41:07] jumping out of the boat.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Even if he did start to sink, but don't
[2:41:11] forget he didn't drown.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; That's just the way I am. That's what I
[2:41:18] believe.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come our brother, pray a prayer
[2:41:22] blessing.
[2:41:25] There's a brother that knows how to pray
[2:41:27] and I love your prayer. Amen. Before his
[2:41:30] brother,
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; shall we bow our heads in prayer?
[2:41:33] Let me just get this off the way.
[2:41:38] I want you to hear this prayer.
[2:41:41] Pray a blessing upon the people this
[2:41:44] day.
[2:41:45] Our gracious heavenly father,
[2:41:49] we come with sincerity in our hearts.
[2:41:53] We have been taught by our prophet
[2:41:56] that we must come before you with
[2:41:58] absolute sincerity.
[2:42:01] And father today with all that is within
[2:42:04] us we approach you. Father we come upon
[2:42:08] sacred grounds.
[2:42:11] We come upon grounds Lord that
[2:42:14] only the privileged and the blessed are
[2:42:17] allowed to come because you have
[2:42:19] released a portion of your presence
[2:42:22] Lord. enough that we do not we are not
[2:42:25] struck dead but just enough Lord to
[2:42:29] bring the fear of God in our hearts.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; We thank you this morning for the
[2:42:34] demonstration of your word.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; We we know that today it was just not
[2:42:39] another service of another gathering
[2:42:42] coming together on the Lord's day but we
[2:42:45] know that today father you have
[2:42:47] stretched forth your hands
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; and you have focused your eyes upon your
[2:42:52] children. Yes.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; And if we never knew before that you
[2:42:57] took special interest in us, this
[2:43:00] morning we believe that you do, Lord.
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; You have focused your tender eyes upon
[2:43:05] us. Not eyes of anger, but eyes of love.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; It is not the eyes of flame, a flaming
[2:43:14] fire, but it is the eyes of of a dove.
[2:43:18] You have looked upon us with love in
[2:43:19] your hearts, with pity, with tenderness,
[2:43:23] with compassion.
[2:43:24] Father, we thank you this day that you
[2:43:27] have anointed your servant to bring such
[2:43:29] a blessed word to us.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; Words of life, words of beauty, words of
[2:43:34] hope.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; And Father, today we have energized this
[2:43:38] word. And this word we have believed.
[2:43:41] This word we love. This word we oh God
[2:43:44] appreciate so much. the living word.
[2:43:48] Father, we thank you for the
[2:43:49] congregation who have listened
[2:43:51] attentively and have committed
[2:43:53] themselves also in response to the word.
[2:43:57] You have looked upon this response and
[2:43:59] you are pleased this morning. I know I
[2:44:01] feel in my heart that you are pleased,
[2:44:03] Lord. And so as we come today to the end
[2:44:06] of this service, Lord, we give you honor
[2:44:09] and thanks that again you have met our
[2:44:12] needs. You have healed our bodies. You
[2:44:15] have touched our lives, Father. You have
[2:44:18] delivered us, Father, by thy word. You
[2:44:20] sent your word and you healed the
[2:44:22] people. Hallelujah.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; And Father, your prophet says that more
[2:44:27] demons are cast out at the preaching of
[2:44:29] the word than actually what we preach,
[2:44:32] oh God. And so we have been set free. We
[2:44:35] have been liberated. Demons have left
[2:44:38] our lives at the preaching of your word.
[2:44:41] Father, we thank you this morning. And
[2:44:43] Lord, as we go to our respective homes,
[2:44:45] we pray that you will give us the rest
[2:44:47] of the day in your presence and with
[2:44:49] another portion richly a flag and of
[2:44:52] wine and a good piece of flesh. We thank
[2:44:56] you this morning as we go. Bless the
[2:44:58] ministry and bless the people. Order our
[2:45:00] footsteps in your way in the name of our
[2:45:03] beloved Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[2:45:07] amen.
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:16] Amen. We're going to dismiss you in the
[2:45:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and come
[2:45:19] early. Have a good seat. Be an
[2:45:21] expectation.
[2:45:23] Just want to say this because it just
[2:45:24] come to my mind last week. You know,
[2:45:26] sometimes even behind the pullpit a
[2:45:27] minister will say something and perhaps
[2:45:31] it's just a wrong thing to say. and I I
[2:45:33] made some comment about the new
[2:45:36] president of the United States and and I
[2:45:38] just uh I I didn't feel good about it
[2:45:41] after and so I just want you to forgive
[2:45:43] me. Uh I think we need to pray for a man
[2:45:45] that's got such responsibility as he has
[2:45:49] and u pray that God will give them
[2:45:51] wisdom and at least we know one thing.
[2:45:53] Everything's going God's direction and
[2:45:56] our confidence is in the Lord. So we
[2:45:58] don't need little little barbs or little
[2:46:01] snide remarks. And so I just wanted to
[2:46:04] make that right. So God bless you. Have
[2:46:06] a good afternoon. Get some refreshment
[2:46:08] and we'll see you this evening. Amen.
[2:46:10] God bless you. God bless you.
