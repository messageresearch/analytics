You enjoying camp, young people. &gt;&gt; I can legitly say young people because I'm over 30. Well, I am 30. So, it's good to see everybody in the house of God tonight. I just uh thinking back, it's been 20 years. I guess I just asked Brother Tom, 20 years when camp first started. That takes me back when I was 10 years old. That's when brother Tony lost his hair and brother Tom turned white. For sure. For sure. Well, it's good to see everybody out this evening. Why don't we all stand? God bless you, brother Tom. Let's sing. I'm going to let the glory roll when the roll is called in glory. And brother John, if I can get more sister Linda through my monitor, that'd be good. I'm going to let the glory roll when the roll is called in glory. I'm going to get beside of myself when I get to Simon King. That day I'm going to have a time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, let's sing it again. Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll. When the roll is falling glory, oh, I'm going to get the side of myself. When I get inside the king, that day I'm going to have a time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, let's sing the first verse. Well, I don't know why, but I can't be shy when I get around all God's people. Well, I get so sad that I'm just on fire and lose all control. Well, the word of God is consuming my feet in my bosom. And one of these days, I'm going to shout and sing in the presence of my king. Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll. Roll his call in glory. I'm going to get beside of myself. When I get beside the king that day, I'm going to have a time of my life. Time of my life is over. I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, well, I wondered around with a great big crown. Found my condemnation. Then the pill of fire came across my path and show me my salvation. Where there's God, there's peace and joy and happiness and gladness. And I thank Jesus. Every day weigh my sadness. I'm going to let glory roll. Roll is rolling glory. Oh, I'm going to get inside of myself. When I get beside that day, I'm going to have time. My life, the time of my life is over. I'm going to get carried away. Carried away. Now the song I sung is for nothing I've done. But God has showed me mercy. And I tell this story for the good Lord's glory by his name. Now you first let's stay with the word and praise revelation and through the power of the word of the hour Lord tempation. I'm going to let glory roll. Roll this fall in glory. Oh, I'm going inside of myself inside the king. That day I'm going to have a time of my life. Time my life is over. Oh, I'm going to get carried away. When I get caring that last verse again, well, my song is nothing I've done. But it's God has showed me mercy and I fill the store for the good Lord's glory. Magnify his name. Lord you first stand at the word for revelation and through the power of the word of the hour Lord tempation. Well I'm going to let the glory roll all his holy glory. I'm going inside of myself. Get inside the king. That day I'm going my life. My life is over. I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away. Amen. Why don't we worship? Worship him. Let's lift our hands. Let's open camp and just give him a praise offering. Hallelujah, Lord. Oh God, Father, we just worship you this evening. Oh God, knowing Lord that you're coming down, you're meeting us this evening, oh God. Lord, we know that you have changed lives. Lord, you're doing great things amongst us, oh God.

Why don't we sing number 203? If I have a little more of me through the monitor, it feels like I'm screaming up here. No, I can't do it. I'll scream. All right. We'll sing There's Going to Be a Meeting in the Air. Let's start with the chorus. Well, there is going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet, sweet by and by. Well, I am going to meet you. I'll meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear. never hurt by mortal. It will be glorious. I do declare and God's own son will be one at that meeting in the air. First verse. Well, you have heard of little Moses in the bull run. And you have heard of Phillis David and his sling. You have heard the story told of dreamy Joseph and of Jonah and the well you often say. For there are many many others in the Bible. I should like to meet them all. I do declare by and by the Lord will surely let us be there. Oh, and that meeting in the air where there is going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet and well I am going to meet you. I'll meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear never hurt my mortality. It will be glorious, I do declare. And God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. Many things will there be missing at that meeting. For the mortar's bench will have no place at all. There will never be a sermon preached to sinners for the sinner had refused to hear the call. There will be no morning or wwarded loved ones. And there will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer. For all our burdens and our anguish will be lifted. Oh, at that meeting in the air. Well, there is going to be a coming in the air in that sweet sweet by and by to meet you. I'll meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. of singing you will hear never heard by mortal. It will be glorious, I too declare. And God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. There the doubters will be missing all together. All the skeptics will be absent on that day. There will be no grumblers present to disturb us. And the angels will be busy far away. Every sense will have his seal upon his forehead. Dressed in rain and not ransom ones can wear. All who have the wedding garments will be present. Oh, at that meeting in the air. Well, there is going to be a meeting in the end in that sweet, sweet by and by. Well, I am going to meet you, meet you over there, beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear never heard by mortal. It will be glorious, I do declare. And God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Sam Adamore, brother Sam, if you come open the service in a word of prayer. I've got just a little email that came from South Africa from brother Harold Beckett. says here, "Sister Ernestine as well, and thanks you all for your prayers. Although she didn't feel up to par when she was discharged from the hospital, she was trusting in the Lord." And then uh one early morning uh sorry, she says uh one one night at about 300 p.m. she woke and uh and she woke up and knew for certain that she was completely healed from the past elements and the stomach problems. She just says here, "Praise to his wonderful name. Not only does he declare himself to be her all, but testifies that he is her healer and only and only healer of her body. And she says, "Thanks again for your prayers." And that's from our brother Harold Beckett. So we want to thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Brother Becket's wife. Okay. Thanks, brother Red. Amen. So we want to continue to hold her up in prayer. Father Sam, why don't you come just open the service in a word of prayer. God's not dead. Let's bow our heads in faith and go to a prayer. Dear heavenly father, we come before you today, Lord. We just want to thank you for all the wonderful things you've been doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, how you how you touched us just yesterday, Lord, through the camp meeting, Lord, through the skits that you've granted strength for the people to perform. Lord, it wasn't just for entertainment, Lord. It touched my heart, Lord. We are just giving all my all back to you, Lord Jesus. Father God, come down tonight, Lord. We pray.

I see those from up from Seattle, Tacoma. God bless you. It's good to have you with us. We have uh Brother Isaac Hagermanerman and a couple of the brothers have a song for us. If they come and get ready at this time, let's uh let's sing I'm bound. I'm bound for higher ground. Number 345 on the screen. I'm bound. I'm bound for higher ground. Ain't no devil's going to pull me down. I'm glad you say I'm on my way. I'm bound for higher ground. Yes, I'm bound. I'm bound. Higher ground. Ain't no devil's going to pull me down. Well, I'm glad to say I'm on my way. I'm bound for higher ground. Yes, I'm bound. I'm bound. Higher ground. Ain't no devil's going to pull me down. Glad to say I am on my way. I'm bound for higher ground. Good evening. This song comes from a little story that Brother Brandham told. I'm sure most of you all recognize it. I pray it's a blessing to y'all. A cattle ranch in the old southwest of the name are more and swift. More cattle than the sage brush on the plane. The foreman had four daughters, fine as a china tea set, and one little orphan cousin who was plain. Telegram from Chicago hit the place like a tornado. The owner's son was coming on a train. girls. The girls put on their war paint for a weekend dance to celebrate. Maybe catch the eye of the fortune's air. He said, "Is there a bride somewhere for me?" The girls in Chicago, they're vain and unruly. I've got a mansion, an inheritance to share. But who can I trust to just love me? The orphan girl in a tattered dress cooked and served and cleaned the mess while the party carried on for several days. Out back with the dish pan, suddenly she saw a man, the armor boy, with his hat held in his hands. His eyes were deep and honest, and she was so embarrassed, but his kind and gentle voice said, "Evening, ma'am." He said, "What you heard is true. I come out here to find a wife. And everything I want, I see in you." He said, "You are the one perfect for me." The girls on the ranch, they're vain and unruly. I've got a mansion, an inheritance to share. Please, won't you marry me? For many days she scrimped and saved, bought a dress and packed her things. The time of his return was drawing nigh. The foreman's girls they teased her, mocked her and abused her. Said he was only sporting you, you silly child. Then they heard the wheels are rolling, the horses hooves are beating, the grinding of the sand under the bug board. She ran out through the trellis and up into his carriage. A new life in Chicago, her reward. He said you were the one waiting for me. The girls of this age are vain and unruly. I've got a mansion, an inheritance to share. I'm glad that you prepared yourself to leave. And he said, "Is there a bride waiting for me? The church of this age is vain and unruly. I've got a mansion, an inheritance to share, but will she have prepared herself to leave? Oh, will she have prepared herself to leave? And thank you, brothers. Why don't we sing a little chorus? We place you in the highest place for you are great high priest. We place you in the highest place for you are the great high priest. replace you. I above all else, all else. And we come to you to worship at your feet. Oh, we place you in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We place you high above all else. else all and we come to you Lord to worship at your feet. Let's sing it one more time. We place you in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We place you high above all else. all else. And we come to you to worship at your feet. Indeed, we are here to worship him. We are welcoming you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to this 205 camp meeting. The Lord loves it. The Lord is very much uh uh he's very very much attracted to I believe this campground, this place at this time. And I can tell you that uh Satan and the powers of darkness are very opposed to it. They they are uh all the powers of hell, demons that are as real or more real than we are, they're very opposed to what's happening here. But but the power of God, the scripture tells us, greater greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. And we don't only say that as a saying or as a scripture quoted, but we believe that with all that is in us, there is nothing that will succeed against the truth or prevail against it. We have our obstacles. We've had them already. had people here uh in in official position. They cannot even uh stand to be here. They have actually vacated the property and gone because they they they see something in the people that just is too overpowering and it is oppressive to them but delivering to us and we say praise be to God. That's the truth friends. That's absolutely the truth. started right the very first day and you many of you don't know anything about these things. What you see here is the tip of the iceberg. But just beyond that is hosts of angels around encamped. We're camp but they're encamped around us and they're here the prophet said to energize your faith. Every one of you young people and every person who's come on the campgrounds, the angels of God are here to energize your faith and lift you up higher in your faith. How many want that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I every hand ought been up at that time. I tell you what, I want my faith energized. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Already I stood at this altar myself, dedicating myself, saying, "God, we may not even know the way." If you'd have seen the presentation last night and seen the rich young ruler in hell, he lifted up his eyes and cried out, "Father Abraham, let Lazarus come and dip his finger in water and cool my tongue." Uh, for I am tormented. And uh we have people that try to lessen the effect of that and say, "Well, that's just a story. That's just a parable." Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man." There was a certain man he told a story about and the prophet came and took him all through the scripture three times. He he he stepped through his life three times. And the last time he was tearing down his barns, I've been so blessed. We saw it last night. It was so vivid. and uh and Lazarus uh sitting beside Abraham. I can tell you some say, "Well, it is so vivid. It is a it is uh it it makes it so uh so real. It it can it it can almost have a a negative effect." I can tell you what it's not it's not it can never be portrayed as real as it actually is. &gt;&gt; Actually is. And I can tell you one thing in hell when he lifted up his eyes, there's no turning around then. There's no altar to come to. And as brother Tom has been saying, and I was so impacted by it as well, taking the words of brother Brandham said, he cried out, not this rich young ruler, but he said in hell, he said he called out for mama and there was no mama there. He cried out for his dad and there was no father there. He cried out and there's nothing there. You're alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THIS IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. This is the time that God has given you and you'll never live it again. You'll never come by this way again. Our brother Ron Peterson has come and even Satan is trying to attack him. Young people, he was here and spoke to you this morning. And Satan is trying to attack him and give him pain in his arms. And you know, he's just he told you this morning he just spent seven days in the hospital with a type of a stroke. And he been he was unconscious on the ground for about a half an hour. And we we want to be in prayer tonight. Satan is defeated. He's trying to attack everybody trying to attack the servant of God. And I declare he's a defeated foe. He's a real foe, but he's a defeated foe. He has some strength, but he's a bluff. He has no strength against the believer. And we need to believe tonight. Amen. I said at the church, we're going to take up offering each night. tonight and tomorrow night is for the expenses of the of the campgrounds and we've taken on some additional expenses. There's a hostel right here and they usually have people in that hostel have drug addicts and alcoholics and all kinds of thing. Last year they wouldn't let us have it and we put a lot of pressure on to get it and they they they charge us the top price for every room even though they never have all their rooms full. They told us themselves only have up to eight people in that whole hostel, but they charge us for every room. And we paid it. We paid $4,500 just to have that place uh solely to the benefit of the believers. And I believe it's a good investment. We don't want spirits hanging around. Hallelujah. In the tent or out of the tent. &gt;&gt; Do you support that? &gt;&gt; We felt that was a a wise thing to do. We got precious young people and children around here that we want to have in a pure atmosphere. And it's your children, mothers and fathers, that we're doing all of this effort for the kitchen staff. It's just unbelievable. All the people on the grounds and the people who worked for the sound and who put up the tent and all of these things. We're just so appreciative. If we had to pay for all of that, we couldn't even afford it. We just so thank God for burdened people. Hallelujah. the musicians and the singers and the counselors and everybody. Can't even name them all. But we just want you to open your hearts and give as God will lead you. On Saturday night, we want to take up a missionary offering. And so you can be prepared and there isn't a person here, not not even a young person. You can go to McDonald's. I'll tell you what, sacrifice a McDonald's and send some books or tapes or something to some person overseas. That's the best investment that you'd have. And so we'd like everybody to come prepared Saturday night to give and then Sunday of course will be our tithes and offerings. And so I wonder if you would uh just stand while we have a word of prayer and the deacons would come forward please. We're going to have a word of prayer. Amen. Praise the Lord. It is more blessed to Let's have everyone say it. It is more blessed to give than it is to receive. &gt;&gt; Have you received? &gt;&gt; It's more blessed to give. Amen. Brother Gary, would you just ask God's blessing, please, upon the giving? Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Bless God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you in your giving, brother. 3:14 on the screen. In my life, Lord, be glorified. Be glorified in my life. Lord, be glorified. be glorified in his life. Lord be glorified today. Let's sing it again. Oh, in my life, oh Lord, be glorified. Be glorified by God. Oh, glorified today. In everything I see and do, in everything that I say and do, be glorified. Be glorified. in everything that I say and you be glorified today. &gt;&gt; And before we sing that course again, our sister Elizabeth Charity Gran I have a song for us as they come and get ready at this time as we sing this a couple more times. In my life, Lord be glorified. in my life. Oh Lord, be glorified. Be glorified in my life. Oh Lord, be glorified today. Let's sing it again. Oh my God. Oh Lord, be glorified. Be glorified in my life. Oh Lord, be glorified today. I've heard the words before. of how you came to die. A crown of thorns, nails in your hands, wounds in your side. People turned against you, even close friends. Yet you gave selflessly love that end. May I not forget all you've done for me. Dying for my sin on a hill called Calary. May I not forget the story ever true. Help my heart to remember. May I not forget you. New eyes you made. No one took your life. True love you gave. So when my heart betrays you, when I lose my way, lead me back to the cross and the price you paid. May I not forget all you've done for me. Dying for my sin on a hill called Calary. May I not forget the story ever true. Help my heart to remember. May I not forget you. May I not forget all you've done for me. Dying for my sin on a hill called Calary. May I not forget the story ever true. Help my heart to remember. May I not forget you. Help my heart to remember. May I not forget you. We're we're going to be going directly to the word now. We thank you young people for the song. Last night I left the tent after midnight and there were still people in here last night. When the presentation was over, I don't think there was anybody moved or anybody left. And then they began to pray and began to give themselves. That's the way the meeting started last night, the way most camp meetings end. It was outstanding. And I don't have the time to tell you that Sunday morning when God laid a certain text on my heart and changed the text between late Saturday night and Sunday morning and directed me and said, "Go to Mark the 10th chapter and make that your main text." And I went to Mark the 10th chapter. Brother Tom Ray, Sister Cororeen, and some of the others that were leading in their presentation have had in mind for months. This brother Tom had it on his heart, felt led to the Holy Spirit, the rich young ruler. And uh I was in the last four services not knowing that the last message that brother Brandham preached leadership was out of Mark 10 and not knowing that I'd be directed to that. And I had my text down as John 14 1 and regarding us following Christ. And then the Holy Spirit just turned it like that and said Mark 10. I went to Mark 10 and some of our people, brother Tom, Sister Joanne, Sister Corine, and two or three others, they told me that almost fell out of their chair. I begin to dramatize. I was standing to the right side of the pull pit dramatizing what the young ruler was going through, how he was so raised right by his parents. He had followed a mother. He had followed his school teacher. And I thought and while I was uh while I was in the last moments getting ready, the Holy Spirit said to me, this rich young ruler, those like the rich young ruler sitting in the church that oh God &gt;&gt; and I was so gripped and so anointed Sunday morning that I actually my human mind separated from my from the spiritual activity of the Holy Spirit. And while I would continue to preach, I had my own thoughts. My own mind was saying I I could take you right where I was standing standing at the right hand of the pulpit and my own mind was saying I was saying to myself why am I dramatizing and while I was thinking that and thinking it over for a few moments I continued to preach to the people and I knew there was such an atmosphere and I was thinking within myself why am I dramatizing this rich young ruler and didn't know that last night and the night before they were going to have it right here at camp and brother Tom had given those exact instructions to the others that were that were uh having to do with it. I can tell you friends, God has a mind. &gt;&gt; God has a plan. &gt;&gt; God has a thought for this service. And what you want to hear now, just be ready. There's a servant of God is going to come and open up this book. And God has a has expressed thought for the meeting now. and it's going to continue right on. There's something he's going to do. I don't know, but you be ready for it. We're going to sing Amazing Grace as our brother Ron Spencer from uh Virginia is going to come and minister to us now. Let's stand as we receive him. Amazing. Lift it up to him now. How sweet the sound that say a rest like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. When we've been there 10,000 years. And we've been there 10,000 years. Bright shining as the sun we blow less days to sing. Oh his praise. Let's sing it now. And when we first be God, everyone who has breath in their lungs, let's sing. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; May we just bow our heads this evening. How many has come under expectation? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been taught by the prophet of God that we get &gt;&gt; what we expect. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the father with that. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; you are the mighty one. &gt;&gt; We're very aware of your presence here even now. And we know that you are moving among us. &gt;&gt; We're your children. And Lord Jesus, we just ask you that father to this afternoon that Lord as we have spent time to &gt;&gt; prepare to follow the channel of the Lord. Lord, may even now all of our hearts both as speaker and as hearer step into that channel tonight, Father. that we might see ourselves &gt;&gt; in this up to-date moment of where we're at in our lives. God, &gt;&gt; may you move in this meeting, God. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the potential. This could be the greatest service we've ever been in our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, because you're here, &gt;&gt; not a man is here. Not some personality is here. You're here. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that. And Lord, we're under expectation that you would speak to our hearts, that you would heal our bodies, THAT YOU WOULD DRIVE BACK THE DEMON POWERS OF HELL. LORD, you said whatever we BIND ON EARTH, YOU'D BIND IN HEAVEN. Whatever we'd loose on earth, you'd loose in heaven. And we're YOUR CHILDREN, AMBASSADORS OF GOD. And we ask you that you would move in a mighty way. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Speak to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name. Let's just sing it one more time. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I would like to say it's an honor to be here this afternoon. I certainly appreciate brother Ed and brother Tom and all having the confidence to invite me to come and I certainly do appreciate this opportunity. May we turn into our scriptures this afternoon to Joshua chapter 23. Amen. I'd like to bring you greetings from home, the Shannondoa Valley. And uh we certainly do want to say that you have a sister church there that loves the Lord &gt;&gt; with all of their hearts. And so, &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days there's going to be a meeting in the air. They'll live just down the street from you. Amen. Amen. Joshua chapter 23. I want to look this evening at Joshua's burden. And it came to pass a long time after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age. And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age. And ye have seen all that the Lord hath your God hath done unto all these nations because of you. For the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you. &gt;&gt; Behold, I have divided unto you by of the lot of these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the nations that I have cut off even to the great sea westward. And the Lord your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight, and he shall possess their land, and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath promised unto you. Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside there from to the right hand or to the left, that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you, neither make mention of the name of your their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither to serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them, but cleave unto the Lord your God, as you have done unto this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless his word, and you may be seated this afternoon. Basically, the message believers, if you have been around the message for a few years, you're almost miniature theologians. So, I'm going to preach to you just like that. You've never heard anything like this before. &gt;&gt; And so, as I do that, that way I won't feel intimidated by you. and uh and you won't feel intimidated by me. So that will be good. Brother Brandham makes some statements and I just want to just as we begin to to go into this subject this evening, maybe laying for just a little bit of a foundation. Brother Brandham calls Joshua the greatest general. He says that Joshua stood with Moses and and as he was there and and and if you'll understand he was there quite a quite a number of years through the journey through a lot of phases. That's right. &gt;&gt; And as he begins to get towards the end of his age, there's something about when we get towards a certain spot in our age and we begin to notice that there's certain things beginning to go on, not just in our age, but as we get toward a certain spot in a dispensation when we know that we don't have very much longer, there's a certain urgency that hits our lives. I pray that you and I feel that urgency as we're coming to the nearness of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That we do not allow the promises of the covenant of the word that we are in. That is a part of our life to allow us TO BE COMMON AND FAMILIAR to us. Joshua was saying that his days are beginning to be numbered and as he's beginning to get a little older and as he's beginning to to to his his limbs and everything and his abilities are beginning to shrink from him. If you'll understand, he's had a special position in this great journey. He has been there as a leader. As a great leader, first of all, a great leader must be led. &gt;&gt; And he has to have a real leadership, something about him. And there's got to be something about us. We have to be led by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and be SENSITIVE TO THE JUNCTIONS OF THE HOUR. As the sheep music as it begins to change in certain junctions, AS IT TAKES CERTAIN PHASES AND WE TURN CERTAIN CORNERS, WE MUST BE AWARE. YES, WE'RE GOING TO THE SAME JOBS. YES, WE'RE LIVING IN THE SAME HOMES. YES, THE governments are corrupt. Yes, SIN IS GETTING WORSE. BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE RAPTURE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; And we can SENSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING and moving very rapidly. Right. &gt;&gt; JOSHUA SAYS, "AND AS I WAS WITH MOSES," he said, "WE FIND ALSO THAT JOSHUA KNOWING THIS COMMISSION, knowing that it laid in his hand, that God had called him for a duty that he must not fail." &gt;&gt; He walked softly before the Lord. And when he CALLED THE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM THAT GOD HAD COMMISSIONED HIM, watch the request of the people, HE SAYS, "WE'LL FOLLOW YOU AS WE DID MOSES." &gt;&gt; If we can see THE SAME THING THAT FOLLOWED MOSES following you, &gt;&gt; only be strong and courageous, THAT OUGHT TO BE REQUIRED OF EVERY BORNAGAIN PERSON TODAY. IF WE'RE REQUESTED TO FOLLOW, HE SAID, "LET'S SEE THE SIGNS, THE BELIEVER THAT FOLLOWS THAT BELIEVER AS JESUS SAID, "THE THINGS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO." &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID, HE SAID IN SAMIAN CHURCH AGE, he said they WERE LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WHO CAME OUT OF EGYPT. HE SAID THEY STOPPED SHORT OF THE PROMISED LAND. TALKING ABOUT KADESH Marnea which I'll go to in just a moment. He said those children of Israel LEFT EGYPT ABOUT 2 MILLION STRONG as they JOURNEYED TOGETHER. ALL SAME SAW THE SAME MIRACLES OF GOD. ALL PARTAKE of the same mana of the mana and the water from the smitten rock. All followed THE SAME CLOUD BY DAY, PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT, BUT ONLY two reached the promised land. Only two were real believers. COME ON. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S WHAT THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE THE WORD TELLS US THAT THE REST OF THE OF THEM DIED BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF. HE SAID THEN SINCE THAT IS SO AND ONLY TWO ENTERED IN THEN THE REST WERE NOT TRUE BELIEVERS. HE SAID WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE? TWO stayed with the word. Brother Brandon makes this statement as as we begin to go and he says he as he comes to this. He said talking about Kadis Barnea again. He said, "Way before it happened, when they come there with Caleb and those other spies and they seen the great opposition, the Amalocites and the Persites and the Hitites and SO FORTH ALL FENCED IN there at Jericho could run a chariot race on the top of that place. Great strong men unbelieving among them." HE SAYS, "WHY WE LOOK LIKE GRASSHOPPERS IN THE SIGHT of them?" I WANT YOU TO DO THIS TO UNDERSTAND. GOD KNEW THAT ALL OF THOSE people were there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT NEED A CRISIS MEETING TO HEAR THOSE 10 MEN COME BACK WITH THAT REPORT. &gt;&gt; NOW, UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY, THESE WERE ALL ISRAEL'S REPRESENTATIVES. &gt;&gt; THEY ALL CAME OUT OF EGYPT. THEY ALL WAS GOING THROUGH THE WILDERNESS. THEY ALL SAW THE SANCTUARIANS AND ALL THEY THEY SAW THE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THEY WERE IN THE UPTO-DATE EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; And they WERE RENOWNED MEN AS THEY WENT ACROSS AND THEY WENT TO THEIR CHOSEN INHERITANCE, THEIR PLACE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WENT TO. &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGIN TO LOOK, IS THIS FOR ME? AND THEY CAME BACK WITH THE REPORT. YES, IT'S A GOOD LAND. YES, IT'S A GOOD MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS FULL OF OF OF MILK AND HONEY, AND IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL TRUTH, BUT THERE'S GREAT MYSTERIES THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT WE FOUND SOME THINGS OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; They begin to go with a report &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MESSAGE HAD NOT BECOME REAL to them. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD TOLD THEM, "I'M GOING TO SEND HORNETS BEFORE YOU." &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD THEM, "IT IS YOUR LAND." IT CANNOT GET ANY MORE PLAIN &gt;&gt; TO THE GROUP OF PEOPLE. I WILL DO THE FIGHTING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; JUST GO. I'LL DO THE FIGHTING FOR YOU. IT'S A GOOD LAND. IT'S YOUR POSSESSED LAND. &gt;&gt; NOW, UNDERSTAND THIS WASN'T JUST A A COUPLE OF DAY FLY BY NIGHT JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; Abraham had met Mechazedc. AND WHEN MELAZDC COULD SWEAR BY NO GREATER, HE SWORE BY HIMSELF AND HE GAVE HIM A COVENANT &gt;&gt; THAT THY CITY SHALL POSSESS THE GATES OF THEIR ENEMY. &gt;&gt; NOW, SURE THEY WERE ALL ISRAEL. SURE, THEY HAD ENJOYED GION. SURE, THEY HAD ENJOYED THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS AND THE MIRACLES. AND THEY HAD COME ACROSS AND THEY HAD DANCED AT THE RED SEA. AND THEY'D WATCHED THEIR GREAT ENEMY. WHO COULDN'T DANCE? &gt;&gt; WHO COULDN'T DANCE THAT DAY? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE GREATEST ARMY THAT THERE HAD EVER BEEN ON THE EARTH TO THAT POINT WAS DROWNING BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES. BROTHER RAM SAID JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT OF THAT OF THAT RED SEA, HE SAID THERE THEY STOOD SAID IT LOOKED LIKE EVEN NATURE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE BLOODIEST MASSACRE THAT THERE EVER BEEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID SOMETIMES GOD'S PATH LEADS US RIGHT INTO A SPOT LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T KNOW MY SITUATION." GOD'S PATH LED YOU RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Ron, I MADE SOME BAD CHOICES. SO DID JONAH. &gt;&gt; I talked to a biologist the other day and I asked him, I SAID, "I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. How long DID THAT FISH HAVE TO GROW TO BE THE SIZE THAT IT HAD TO BE? TO WHERE IT COULD swallow a man like Jonah. He said that fish had to swim for hundred years &gt;&gt; to be in that position. God knew &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN EVEN CAME ON the earth. That's it. &gt;&gt; ROMANS 5 SAID HE LOVED YOU WHILE YOU WERE YET A sinner &gt;&gt; when you WERE UNLOVABLE. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WERE IN A CONDITIONAL STATE OF LOOKING LIKE NO WAY THAT YOU COULD OBTAIN MERCY. GOD LOVED YOU. AND LET ME JUST SAY, GOD SIGNED A COVENANT &gt;&gt; WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COURAGEOUS, THESE MEN, &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY, LET ME JUST PUT IT LIKE THIS. THESE LEADERS, THESE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH, &gt;&gt; THE ELDERS OF THE TRIBE SHOULD HAVE CAME BACK WITH THE COVENANT IN THEIR HANDS. THAT'S RIGHT. WITH THE EVIDENCE IN THEIR HAND AND LET'S HAVE A CHEERLEADING SESSION. LET'S GO GET THE LAND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ONLY JUST AND I JUST WANT TO JUST CAPTIVATE THIS AND I MAY HAVE WENT AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO GET YOU WHERE I WANT YOU TO GO, BUT I WANT YOU JUST TO UNDERSTAND JOSHUA'S BURDEN JUST ISN'T AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY, BUT HE'S WATCHED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WONDER &gt;&gt; WITH THE COVENANT RIGHT IN THEIR HANDS. AND IT'S THEIRS. &gt;&gt; WATCH. &gt;&gt; I feel better now. &gt;&gt; He said, but he said, HE SAID, "THIS CHURCH IS IN ITS DELIVERANCE. IS A PERFECT TYPE OF Israel in their deliverance. WHEN ISRAEL TOOK ITS STAND UPON THE PURE, HOLY, UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD, IT WAS GOING TO TAKE ITS STAND AND TAKE ITS MARCH. Moses led the children of Israel with the little bread, KNEADED BREAD ON THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD, KOSHER, AND THEY MARCHED TO THE RED SEA. HE SAID GOD'S PATH LED THEM RIGHT UP TO THE RED SEA. AND WELL SAID NOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ACROSS SOMEBODY LOOKED BACK AND SAID LOOK COMING YONDER THE DUSTES ARE BLOWING THERE'S THOUSANDS TIMES THOUSANDS OF PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS RIGHT BEHIND THEM THAT MIXED MULTITUDE THAT WENT RIGHT WITH THEM BEGIN TO QUIVER AND SHAKE WHICH FOLLOWED FINALLY PERISHED WITH THE GANG SAYING OF KORA NO DOUBT BUT WHAT THE VERY NATURE OF THE HILL SHOOK GOING TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST BLOODIEST MASSACRES THAT HAD EVER BEEN EVER SEEN. A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BUNCH OF PEOPLE STANDING THERE BY THE SIDE OF THE SEA. HE SAID, "LITTLE CHILDREN BACKED UP AGAINST MAMA HOLDING HER DRESS. POOR OLD DAD LEANING AGAINST THEIR BOY CRYING SAYING, "SON, I'VE LIVED MY DAYS, BUT I HATE TO SEE YOU GOING. LOOK COMING YONDER. ALL NATURE WHO DREADS DEATH. EVEN THE FLOWERS AND THE TREES AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS AFRAID OF DEATH. NATURE QUIVERED AND GROANED AND SHOOK UNDER THEIR FEET WHEN THEY SEEN THAT BLOODY MASSACRE COMING. HE SAID, "WHAT WAS GOD DOING?" HE SAID, "WHAT A TIE." HE SAID, "THEY FAILED TO REALIZE HANGING RIGHT YONDER STOOD A SUPERNATURAL POWER, THE HALO OF GOD, A PILLAR OF FIRE HANGING THERE THAT WOULD STAND BETWEEN THEM AND THE ENEMY. WHEN IT COME TIME TO STAND, NATURE QUIVERING, THE SEA BEGIN TO GET NERVOUS. THE MOON LOOKING DOWN QUIVERING. THE BIRDS FLEW FROM THE SCENE. ANIMALS RUN BACK. OH, WHAT AN ENDLESS MURDERING OF MILLIONS ARE GOING TO DIE IN A FEW MINUTES. AND THEY ARE ALL GROANING. BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING? THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE PATH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I like that. Don't you? He said there's hanging bombs, &gt;&gt; cobalt bombs, &gt;&gt; a proclamation rising up to stop now all the inter denomination and consolidate to to one great big evangelical group church of the Protestants which will cooperate and join with Catholicism and combat communism. It's the work of the devil. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, sir. God never did associate saint and the world and and and Satan's church together. God leads his church and he don't don't expect political powers to lead them. Not even the church politics. Every man that is born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD is free. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT WOULD TAKEN PLACE IN THE RIVER OF JORDAN 2,000 YEARS AGO WHEN THE WORLD HAD BEEN IN CHAOS FOR A LONG TIME. ISRAEL HAD REJECTED GOD, REJECTED THE LAWS, REJECTED HIS STATUTES, HIS ORDINANCE, AND HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY. And and never was Israel ever harmed as long as THEY STAYED IN A HARMONY WITH GOD'S COMMAND. AND HE SAID, "AND NEVER WILL A CHURCH FAIL. &gt;&gt; NEVER WILL A PROGRAM FAIL AS LONG AS THOSE ARE IN CHARGE STAY IN THE CENTER OF GOD'S WILL." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GOD'S WILL IS PERFECT." &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, THAT DIDN'T LOOK PERFECT, BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "AND EVERYTHING WILL FALL RIGHT INTO ITS PLACE. YOU STAY IN GOD'S WILL. HE SAYS, "BUT GET OUT OF GOD'S WILL." HE SAYS, "HERE, IT THROWS THE WHOLE PROGRAM OUT." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IN THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING," HE SAID, "THIS GREAT CHAOS THAT WE'RE IN NOW, IT'S THE DARKEST HOUR THAT'S EVER SEEN. WHERE IS THE HOPE? SPUTNIKS IN THE SKIES, ATOMIC BOMBS, CONTROL MISSILES ANY NO NATION CAN DESTROY IN ONE HOUR. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT OUGHT THE CHURCH TO DO TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THOUGH IN A BLINDED WORLD OF SIN AND CHAOS, WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT OURSELVES AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD." &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID, "WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE SHOULD WE BE IF THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS YOU SO EMBODIED OR EMPOWERED THAT YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN THOUGHTS? &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN MIND, YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN OPINION, BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS YOU SO BUILT &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR BEING. IT'S GOD'S SPIRIT EXPRESSING ITSELF THROUGH YOU." AND WHAT KIND OF A CHURCH I CAN JUST SEE I CAN JUST SEE AND I JUST WANT TO TIE THIS RIGHT BACK TOGETHER. I CAN JUST SEE THE SPIRIT OF JOSHUA AND CALEB. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; YES. THERE WERE MEN &gt;&gt; THAT COME BACK WITH AN EVIL REPORT. &gt;&gt; YES, THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE DRAWING BACK. BUT THEY TOOK THE COVENANT OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR AS THE TESTIMONY SERVICES GOING ON THAT EVENING. MAYBE IT WAS GOING LONG THAT DAY AND 10 HAD GIVE THEIR REPORTS. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THEY'RE JUST HOLDING THEMSELVES, MAYBE GRINNING THEIR TEETH AND MAYBE CHEWING THEIR GUM A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THAT REVELATION IS DROPPED IN THEIR HEART. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST HANGING TO THAT COVENANT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE HANGING TO EVERY WORD THAT MOSES, THAT MIGHTY MESSENGER OF GOD, HAS SPOKE TO THEM. &gt;&gt; EVERY QUOTE THEY'RE BELIEVING HAS COME RIGHT STRAIGHT FROM THE MIND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE BELIEVING IT SAYS THAT ABOUT THEM. THEY HAVE TAKEN IT PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE TAKEN IT PERSONAL. NOW, I'M GLAD FOR UNCLES AND AUNTS AND AND ALL THOSE OTHERS, BUT IT HAS TO BE A PERSONAL REVELATION FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; TWO IN THE BED, ONE TO BE TAKEN, ONE TO BE LEFT. TWO IN THE FIELD. I WANT YOU TO KNOW IF THERE'S ONE GOING IN VIRGINIA, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT ONE. COME ON, CHURCH. THAT REVELATION HAS TO DROP IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M WAITING ON THIS AND I'M WAITING ON THAT. LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE WEIGHT IN MY MIND. I WANT TO ANCHOR MYSELF IN THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; GOD WROTE A COVENANT WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH. I'M A PART OF THAT COVENANT. YES. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE CHURCH IS ON ITS road that WHEN THE CHURCH WILL BE SO WRAPPED IN CHRIST &gt;&gt; THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT, MANKIND, SO AWAY FROM THEMSELVES &gt;&gt; THAT THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES. THEY DON'T HAVE NO THOUGHTS BUT TO SERVE GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT REALLY SERVING GOD FIRST PLACE IN THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, BUT I'VE GOT THIS TO DO AND I'VE GOT THAT TO DO. AND I'M SO, LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. DON'T LET THOSE THINGS DISTRACT YOU. AS I USED IT THIS MORNING, MAKE SURE AS MOSES DID, HE FOCUSED HIMSELF ON THE WORD. SURE, there were A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON AROUND HIM, BUT HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCIPLINED AND FOCUSED ON WHAT GOD HAD HIM TO DO. They that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; He said when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself then will be the church in its power. Brother Ron, who's he talking about? You're rubbing shoulders with them. You know, many times we come to camps, if we're not careful, we'll get in the camp atmosphere &gt;&gt; and we'll get in the cycle &gt;&gt; to where that we get energized by the element of the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. AND WE FALL RIGHT back &gt;&gt; into the Mount Horb experience &gt;&gt; in a few weeks. &gt;&gt; Right back into the desert, &gt;&gt; right back into worldly &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS SATAN'S DESIRE THAT HE COULD SIFT YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE KNOWS WHAT THE WORD SAYS ABOUT YOU. HE CAN READ THE BOOK, TOO. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. HE CAN READ THE QUOTES AS WELL. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS HE COULD READ DEUTERONOMY 28, WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT BEING BLESSED, I'LL MAKE YOU THE HEAD AND NOT THE TAIL. &gt;&gt; HE JUST HE COULD READ ALL THE COVENANT OF WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, HOW THAT HE'S GOING TO GIVE THEM THE LAND, BUT HE WAS CONSTANTLY IN THEIR EARS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT. THERE'S GIANTS OVER THERE. THE CITIES ARE WALLED. THEY'RE INCREDIBLE ARMIES THERE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN GO. LOOK HOW SMALL YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO INTELLECTUAL ABILITY ON YOUR OWN. &gt;&gt; As long as he intimidates you, you're not going to do anything. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, Brother Ron, I'm just A YOUNG PERSON." I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M 9 YEARS OLD AND SATAN IS TERRIFIED OF YOU. WHEN YOU ROLL OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING AND YOU PUT YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR &gt;&gt; AND YOU GO ON YOUR KNEES, THE KINGDOM OF HELL SHAKES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS SIGNED A COVENANT WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, DO I HAVE TO WAIT TILL I GET A CERTAIN AGE? YOU'RE YOU'RE WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WORD OF GOD AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; PULL YOUR SWORD. &gt;&gt; SURE THERE'S DEMON POWERS EVERYWHERE, &gt;&gt; BUT WE WERE DESIGNED TO LIVE HERE. &gt;&gt; WE WERE BUILT TO LIVE HERE IN this &gt;&gt; s. Oh, don't you love the Lord? He says this 13 in numbers 13 verse 26 and they went and they came to Moses and Aaron to all the children the congregation of the children of Israel under the wilderness of Pan and Kish brought back the word unto them unto all the the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said, "We came unto the land which weather thou sent us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey. This is the fruit of it." &gt;&gt; But this message is too straight to live. &gt;&gt; There's too much legalism. &gt;&gt; It's too hard. We need entertainment. &gt;&gt; We need to mix a little bit with it. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO TO BRING PERSONALITIES IN. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO INVOLVE A LITTLE WHIRLISM IN IT. &gt;&gt; A LITTLE DENOMINATIONAL CARRYOVER IN IT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. NOAH PREACHED 120 YEARS, SAME MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE IF YOU WERE A REGULAR ATTENDER OF HIS CHURCH, YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I WISH HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS SUBJECT MATTER. &gt;&gt; BUT NO MATTER WHERE HE STARTED, HE WOUND UP &gt;&gt; WITH GOD HAS SPOKEN TO ME. AND HE'S GOING TO DESTROY THIS EARTH &gt;&gt; WITH WATER. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE ONLY ARK OF SAFETY. YOU MUST, THERE'S NOT A QUESTION. YOU MUST GET ON THIS ARC. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PROVISION. &gt;&gt; AND NO DOUBT THEY WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear something else. &gt;&gt; I LIKE AN ADDITION TO IT. I'D LIKE SOME ENTERTAINMENT WITH IT. &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE MIXED WITH IT. BUT NOAH SAID, "THIS IS THE WORD FOR THIS DAY." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE MESSAGE WILL STAND ON ITS OWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADD NOTHING TO IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROFIT UP. &gt;&gt; THE COVENANT SAID, "IT'S YOUR LAND. &gt;&gt; GO GET IT. &gt;&gt; I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; GO GET IT. I'LL SEND THE FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I imagine as the day went on, as he as they heard these men talking about, we are like grasshoppers. No way that we CAN ATTAIN. NO WAY THAT WE CAN ATTAIN. OH, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THAT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE SEEMS TOO HIGH, TOO ALOOF. We're too busy. &gt;&gt; Joshua looked &gt;&gt; burden in his heart. Caleb, &gt;&gt; he just couldn't stand it no more. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The scripture says he steal the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can only imagine the the strength in his voice. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE THE BROTHER TOM. I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OF MY VOICE TO EVEN GO DOWN THE SAME PATH THAT HE WENT. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE DIDN'T GIVE UP AND GIVE SOME WHISPERING SERMON THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE DIDN'T STAND BEHIND THE PULLPIT AND AND AND SPEAK LATIN FOR A WHILE. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE HE WASN'T QUITE AS ELOQUENT AS SOME OF THEM WANTED TO HEAR, &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE." &gt;&gt; YES, THERE'S DEMONS. YES, THERE'S PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID we expect? &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO BE MOLDED BY CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO FIGHT SOME OBSTACLES. WE'RE HERE TO PROVE THE WORD OF GOD IS REAL. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PATH THAT HE'S BROUGHT US THROUGH. HE'S BROUGHT US THIS FAR. HE'S MORE THAN ABLE. &gt;&gt; HE'S more than able. &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT IT WAY OUT SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. OH, WAY WAY WAY OUT YONDER. THAT VISION OUGHT TO BE AN EXPECTANCY. IT COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OUR ENERGIES SHOULD BE SO RIVETED AROUND THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS MESSAGE WAS NOT A KAKIAN'S MESSAGE. THIS WAS A VOICE BEHIND A VOICE THAT WAS SPEAKING TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND WE'RE COMMISSIONED LIKE AN ARMY &gt;&gt; TO STICK TO THE WORD, TO STICK TO OUR PART OF THE SCRIPT LIKE CALEB DID AND SAY WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand says when God gets ready to do something, he always has a witness of it. I'M SO GLAD THAT WE CAN LOOK AROUND before the coming of the Lord and see the witnesses of his appearing. Seeing the signs of the church and the near approaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, seeing it see word by word fulfilled. EVEN THE LAST SIGN TO BE GIVEN TO THE CHURCH BEFORE THE APPEARING OF THE LORD JESUS, IT'S WORKING IN THE CHURCH RIGHT NOW. THE LAST thing remember HE SAID AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM SO SHALL IT BE IN THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN. HE SAYS LOOK WHAT THE SINNERS WAS DOING IN SODOM. LOOK WHAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DID WHEN HE COME DOWN to bear RECORD OF IT. WATCH THIS. WHAT THE THREE WHAT THE THREE ANGELS DID ALL THREE OF THEM. HE SAYS LOOK AT THE WORLD TODAY AND IT SIN. LOOK AT THE CHURCH TODAY LIKE LOT. LOOK LIKE LOOK AT LOOK AT ALL THE CHURCH ALL THE CALLED OUT CHURCH HAVING TO HAVING A STRUGGLE LIKE ABRAHAM WAS. THE MAN OF or the man OR WOMAN TODAY THAT TRIES TO LIVE FOR GOD HAS A STRUGGLE &gt;&gt; TO KEEP ON GOING. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I HAVE A HARD TIME. YES. &gt;&gt; YES. BUT WE'RE BUILT FOR THIS. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "YOU HAVE TO PRESS &gt;&gt; INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS ISN'T A SECONDHANDED RELIGION. THIS CAN'T BE HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. JOSHUA SAW THOSE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND GOD SPOKE TO HIM TO STOP THE WHOLE THING ONE DAY. AND HE SAID, "THERE'S SOME THAT HAS GREW UP AMONG YOU." &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THE OLD FIGHTERS HAVE DIED OFF." AND HE SAID, HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO CIRCUMCISE AGAIN." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I WANT YOU TO CIRCUMCISE AGAIN. THOSE YOUNG MEN THAT HAVE GREW UP IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, THEY NEED THE HOLY GHOST FOR THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; THEY NEED THAT LEADERSHIP. THEY NEED THAT SEAL OF CIRCUMCISION FOR THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. BROTHER RON, I WALKED TO THE ALTAR. I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; FOR YOURSELF. We're not careful, we'll have it as a Baptist. &gt;&gt; Just believe a quote. &gt;&gt; The devil does that. &gt;&gt; Just go to church. I WANT YOU TO KNOW AT MY CHURCH, HE'S THE BEST ATTENDER I HAVE. &gt;&gt; And he believes BROTHER BRANDON WAS A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. BY HIM BELIEVES THAT. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM RAPTURE MATERIAL. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT THE DEVIL HATES IS TO SEE THAT LIFE COME ON THE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S NO MORE THE LIFE OF YOU TRYING TO LIVE IT, &gt;&gt; BUT HE COMES AND LIVES INSIDE OF you &gt;&gt; and he BECOMES THE PULSATION &gt;&gt; AND HE BECOMES THE COMFORTER IN YOUR HEART. He said Jehovah Gyra, we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the trumpet shall sound, AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE, and we shall be changed in a moment, and in a twinkling of an eye, AND BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR forever to be with the Lord, THAT THAT GREAT SON THAT'S COMING. HE SAID, SEE HIM GETTING HIS CHURCH READY. WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S SHOWING THEM HIS LAST SIGN. AND THE NEXT THING IS WHAT? THE RAPTURE. THE RAPTURE. THE SON APPEARS AND WE'RE CHANGED. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "WE CAN'T GO. WE CAN'T GO GET HIM IN THE AIR. HE'S TOO HIGH FOR US. BUT WE'LL BE CHANGED LIKE ABRAHAM THE FATHER WAS IN A MOMENT AND THE TWINKLE OF AN EYE AND BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO MEET HIM IN THE AIR." YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER." WELL, THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL ONE TIME THAT MET A MAN FROM THE ARMOR IN COMPANY. AND SHE WAS THROWING OUT SOME DISHWATER. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THE 10 OTHER GIRLS, WE'LL SAY IT tonight &gt;&gt; for the for OUR TYPE OF DRAMATIZATION. THE 10 OTHER GIRLS WITH THEIR DENOMINATIONAL FROLIC &gt;&gt; AND THEIR PARTY THAT WAS GOING ON THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE THE ONE. OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS DOING HER DUTY. &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS SIMPLY GOING ABOUT DOING WHAT SHE KNEW TO BE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND AS SHE WAS THROWING OUT THE WATER, SHE HAD A VISITOR. You say, "OH, BROTHER RON, BUT I CAN'T PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT I I JUST, YOU KNOW, I I I SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, BROTHER RON, YOU KNOW, I JUST I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT HE LIVES INSIDE OF MY HEART." SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHOW THEM A RING. &gt;&gt; SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHOW THEM A PIECE OF PAPER. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING A COVENANT THAT WAS SAID IN HIS WORDS. &gt;&gt; I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU. &gt;&gt; I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU. AND JUST AS MUCH AS HE TOLD CALEB AND JOSHUA, "GO GET YOUR LAMP." &gt;&gt; JUST AS MUCH AS HE TOLD THAT LITTLE GIRL, "I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU." OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; SHE BE TO GET BUSY ABOUT DOING HER CHORES. THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT SHALL WE DO? GO SIT UNDER A TENT SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING. NO, THAT WORD IS LIKE AN ATOMIC BOMB. &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP EATING ON THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. WORD UPON WORD UPON WORD UPON WORD BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU &gt;&gt; NOT THE PERSONALITY OF A MAN BUT THE WORD ITSELF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; She kept washing dishes. &gt;&gt; You just keep going to work. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She just kept doing the things that she she normally did. &gt;&gt; She washed her dirty clothes. &gt;&gt; She fixed their eggs. &gt;&gt; She fixed her cereal. &gt;&gt; She did whatever SHE HAD TO DO. &gt;&gt; But now she had a testimony. &gt;&gt; HER STEP WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER. SAME CHORES, &gt;&gt; BUT JUST HER STEPS ARE A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER. &gt;&gt; I'M IN THIS WORLD, BUT I'M NOT OF THIS WORLD. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. AND WHILE I'M HERE, &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GET READY. &gt;&gt; Make use of your time. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, LET'S GO LAY ON A SHADE TREE AND LET'S DO THIS AND LET'S DO THAT. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. WE'RE BUSY. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WORK. USE EVERY BIT OF YOUR ENERGY FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD'S SAKE. &gt;&gt; WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER THIS MEETING? WHAT SHOULD I DO TO LISTEN, FIND SOMETHING FOR GOD TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR. TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, I may not WIN NONE OF THEM, BUT your life &gt;&gt; just keep watering. &gt;&gt; Keep watering that experience. &gt;&gt; There was something different about her. Maybe the first couple of days she didn't tell them. You know, some things you just want to ponder in your heart. Some things are just too good to tell. &gt;&gt; They're not going to believe it. No way. &gt;&gt; She got to thinking, no doubt, in a few months and a few days, I won't do this no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as a time begin to grow near, her expectation begin to build. &gt;&gt; She looked in the mirror. She worked on her dress. Maybe she she she just did things a certain way to get herself prepared because now she's going to be a queen of the house &gt;&gt; from bottom servant to the queen. &gt;&gt; There's been churches, churches, and brides brides. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she's thinking as she washes those filthy dishes maybe the last few days. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about that last time. &gt;&gt; You know, there's just SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LAST TIME. You guys know something about the last day of school. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. YOU KNOW THAT LAST DAY OF SCHOOL, THE TEACHER COULD TELL YOU TO GO TO THE MOON. &gt;&gt; She don't have you but just a few more hours. &gt;&gt; You're free &gt;&gt; at least for the summer. &gt;&gt; You know, THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT &gt;&gt; AS YOU COME TO THAT SPOT. Few more days. Never forget as a boy. Maybe I shouldn't confess this. &gt;&gt; I'll blame you. &gt;&gt; AS A LITTLE BOY, I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE THAT LAST DAY OF school to carry a water gun. &gt;&gt; What are they going to do? Some little boys never grow up, &gt;&gt; you know, AND I JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, THAT LAST DAY, LAST PERIOD &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE THINKING, &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, 45 MORE MINUTES, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WATER GUN TIME. &gt;&gt; And you know YOU'RE NOT ALONE. THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS THINKING IN HER LAST MORNING. SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER DRESS on different today. &gt;&gt; She tied her APRON ON TO COOK BREAKFAST THIS MORNING. MAYBE AT 5:00 last time. &gt;&gt; She put the wood IN THE STOVE. LAST time &gt;&gt; she CRACKED THE EGGS. LAST TIME &gt;&gt; SHE HEARD THEIR BELLY ACHING. LAST TIME &gt;&gt; SHE CLEANED THEIR FLOORS AND SHE CLEANED THEIR BEDS THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND MAYBE AS IT GOT TOWARD THE END OF THE DAY, MAYBE THERE WAS SOME CHORES THAT WERE STILL ON HER LIST, BUT IT'S TIME. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; I CAN just Oh, I feel the Lord. &gt;&gt; I CAN JUST SEE HER. SHE PULLS THAT LITTLE APRON OFF AND HANGS IT ON THAT NAIL LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; SATAN TRIES TO DESTROY YOU. ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'LL DO IT THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. I'M JUST A PASSING THROUGH. SHE WAS UNDER SUCH ANTICIPATION, SUCH EXPECTATION. SHE DID HER HER HAIR A CERTAIN WAY. SHE DID HER DRESS A CERTAIN WAY. SHE WALKED OUT OF THAT BEDROOM THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; SHE WALKED OUT ACROSS THAT PORCH. LAST TIME, &gt;&gt; SHE LISTENED AS THOSE GIRLS STOOD THERE ON THAT PORCH AND LAUGHED AT HER. AND SHE STOOD THERE UNDER THEIR PERSECUTION. &gt;&gt; I CAN ONLY HEAR HER IN HER IN HER PONDERING HEART. &gt;&gt; DO YOUR BEST. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; DO YOUR BEST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; As I got sick this afternoon, I told the devil on MY KNEES, I SAID, "TRY YOUR BEST &gt;&gt; CUZ GREATER IS HATE than that one." &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, BUT I FEEL SO ALONE." DO YOU THINK BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T FEEL ALONE? YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE STEPPED TO THE PULL PIT KNOWING 10,000 OF HIS FRIENDS IS GOING TO LEAVE HIM. WHEN HE PREACHES SERPENT SHADE, WHEN HE PREACHES LYING AGAINST DENOMINATIONALISM, &gt;&gt; WHEN HE PREACHES SATAN'S EATING, &gt;&gt; SOULS NOW IN PRISON, &gt;&gt; THE DEEPER THE WORD, THE MORE FRIENDS TRICKLING OFF, &gt;&gt; THE MORE THE MURMURING WENT ON BEHIND THEM. BUT THEY'RE GREATER. &gt;&gt; THE GREATER THE INSPIRATION. &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, BUT MY BATTLE'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER." THAT'S GREAT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WONDERFUL. BECAUSE AS THAT DARKNESS CONGEALS TOGETHER, IT IS ANNOUNCING THERE'S A NEW DAY GETTING READY TO APPROACH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT LIGHT AS IT'S COMING &gt;&gt; PRESSES THAT DARKNESS TOGETHER, &gt;&gt; WHO'S GOING TO FILL THE DARKNESS? THAT WHICH IS THE CLOSEST TO IT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; And you are the last line of defense. &gt;&gt; You stand like a mighty &gt;&gt; and death comes right up to you. comes right against you and you feel it's cold clammy hands trying to destroy your prayer LIFE TRYING TO DESTROY YOU GOING TO CHURCH TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR FAMILY &gt;&gt; TRYING TO STEAL YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF YOUR HOME &gt;&gt; TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT IN THE WORLD YOU APPLIED THE TOKEN &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD OF GOD YOU HAVE A covenant &gt;&gt; you SAY OH BROTHER RON WHAT CAN I DO I'M JUST I'M A MERE MORTAL BEING. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. YOU'RE A SON AND YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; She stood there at that gate. She stood there, listen, WITH NOT A SPECK OF DOUBT. I think I better go back in and take these clothes off. &gt;&gt; You may have to stand alone like she did. &gt;&gt; You may have to stand like Caleb did. What in the world are you guys thinking? &gt;&gt; We have been caught for this. &gt;&gt; And when I went over there, &gt;&gt; I saw a mountain. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; MY NAME PROCLAIMS THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSORS OF THAT MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; THIS WORD SAYS THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CHARACTER THAT RESEMBLES JESUS CHRIST. AND IT'S A PERFECT REFLECTION. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD SAYS THAT ABOUT ME. LISTEN, I BELIEVE THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WILL GO WITH ME AND DRIVE OUT THE ENEMY AND BE LIKE A HORNET. AND YES, THERE'S ENEMIES THERE, BUT WHEN I GET THERE, HE'LL DRIVE THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHOSE HANDS IS HE GOING TO USE? THESE HANDS. &gt;&gt; WHOSE FEET IS HE GOING TO USE? THESE &gt;&gt; THINGS. &gt;&gt; WHO YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU YOUNG PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, Brother Ron, but we we sat around this message a long time. Yeah. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE GOING TO BELIEVE IT &gt;&gt; WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS. Many years ago when I was first born again, first saved, we say it like that anyway. I went to a camp meeting much like this. I was sitting in your place. Your pastor STOOD TO HIS FEET THAT night &gt;&gt; and begin to preach, let us run. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he BEGAN TO GO DOWN THROUGH THE patriarchs &gt;&gt; of the ages &gt;&gt; and be TO TELL ALL OF THOSE MEN WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THEY POSSESSED OF THEIR LAND. AND THEN I FELT THE PERSONAL challenge &gt;&gt; at THE END OF THAT SERMON. IT'S NOW OUR TURN TO RUN. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T RUN BECAUSE THEIR RACE IS OVER. &gt;&gt; NOW IT'S OUR TURN &gt;&gt; TO RUN. &gt;&gt; SITTING IN THAT POSITION THERE. SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY 5'5. I DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATION. MAYBE MANY OF YOU HAVE, BUT SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; WE'RE BUILT TO LIVE IN THIS PLACE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE A SUPER RACE, A SUPER CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I've heard those quotes A MILLION TIMES. ONE MORE TIME. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS JUST BROTHER BRANDHAM WITH HIS EDUCATION JUST TWIRLING A FEW WORDS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FORECAST OF THE POTENTIAL OF THE MIND OF GOD OF WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT JOSHUA'S BURDEN WAS THAT THE PEOPLE AS THEY WERE STANDING THERE THAT THEY NOT ONLY HEAR THE MESSAGE BUT THEY BECOME THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING THERE TONIGHT AND WE'LL START OUT WITH THIS VERY simple text. BUT MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING THERE TONIGHT AND YOU'RE WHERE I WAS IN 1983 &gt;&gt; and YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, BUT I FEEL SO INSIGNIFICANT. I FEEL LIKE I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING." LISTEN, you may NOT BE A PREACHER. YOU MAY NOT BE A SINGER, &gt;&gt; but God's strategy is to take an empty human vessel. &gt;&gt; An empty human vessel. So that means there's some emptying out we've got to do. &gt;&gt; There's some opinions and some thoughts and &gt;&gt; some things we NEED TO GET RID OF. SHAKE THOSE THINGS AWAY FROM US. &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD FILLS IT WITH THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE LIFE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT 10 MILLION MILES AWAY. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO LIVE AT THE CONTROL TOWER OF YOUR HEART, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER. SAY, "OH, Brother Ron, but Brother Biscll says this and you say this and Brother John SAYS THAT." BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY WITH THE WORD? &gt;&gt; You take the word and cut the enemy's head off. Fill that vessel with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which is the VERY LIFE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THE VERY ZOEY of God, the very mind of God and then shake the world with it. &gt;&gt; What world you talking about, brother Ron? Your world. where you go to school. &gt;&gt; You're home. &gt;&gt; I've had ministers call me and say, "What did you do to those young people in Louisiana? You worked them up." I said, "What happened?" They come home and tried to start a revival in our church. &gt;&gt; I said, "GOOD. I PRAY THAT THEY START A REVIVAL IN THEIR HOMES. &gt;&gt; CUZ IF THAT REVIVAL STARTS IN THE HOME, IT'LL START IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He said, "OH MY, LET'S GO." I'M FEELING ALMOST TOO GOOD NOW. HE SAID, "ALMIGHT, LET'S GO FORWARD. IF WE ONLY PREACH THE THE CHURCH JUSTIFICATION, LET'S TAKE THEM A LITTLE FURTHER THAN WE THAN THAT. NOW, HE SAYS, "GO A LITTLE HIGHER AND IF WE CAN GET INTO THAT, GOD BEGINS TO FILL WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT." AND HE SAID, "THEN LET'S GO INTO DIVINE HEALING AND LET'S SEARCH THAT OUT." HE SAID, "THE HOLY GHOST IS LIKE A GREAT BIG APARTMENT STORE." HE SAID, "THE PEOPLE THAT'S BECOME CHRISTIANS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY OWN." COULD YOU IMAGINE ME BUYING A HOUSE WITHOUT LOOKING IT OVER FIRST? COULD HE SAYS HE SAYS COULD YOU IMAGINE ME OWNING A PLACE LIKE SOMEBODY GIVE ME A GREAT BIG ARCADE AND HE SAID GREAT BIG PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING HE SAYS JUST EVERYWHERE. HE SAID IT'S ALL MINE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID WELL THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WHEN YOU BECOME TO CHRIST EVERYTHING. YEAH. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING BELONGS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; You guys are just you you just say it in a certain way. We're sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other day when the doctor walked in and looked at me and he put his feet on the floor up on my bed and he put his hands behind my head. He said, "You know, this room," he said, "generally goes because it was a nice room that overlooked the city." He said, "Generally, they save this room for kind of the celebrities of the city. And he said, "Uh, how did you get this wrong?" I said, "Because of who I am." &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ask for it?" And I said, "No, I didn't ask for it. He said, "Uh, why are you saying that?" I said, "Because of who I am." He said, "Well, who are you?" I said, "I AM A SON OF GOD." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And I may not LOOK LIKE IT LAYING HERE, BUT I'M A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWNS BELONGS TO ME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We're his kids. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HIS KIDS. LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK INTO THAT ARCADE STORE AND JUST STAND IN THE LOBBY. IT'S ALL YOURS. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID, "IF SOMETHING'S TOO HIGH FOR YOU, GET A LADDER, CLIMB UP, LOOK WHAT'S ON THE TOP OF THE SHELF. Never let yourself come to a stage of satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Let me just read one more quote about yourself. You like to hear about yourself. &gt;&gt; You know, I like to hear about Joshua, but I like to hear about me. &gt;&gt; I'm a little bit selfish, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; I like to hear about you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like to see you believe it about you. &gt;&gt; That's what JOSHUA'S BURDEN WAS. HE WANTED TO SEE THE PEOPLE BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; NOW, understand very clearly, and we'll get to this a little bit later, maybe tomorrow, but Joshua COULDN'T GO DO THE FIGHTING for them. &gt;&gt; So, it had to be anchored in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't do it for you. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have to take the message &gt;&gt; and believe it for yourself. &gt;&gt; He says, "All right, here is what I'm trying to say to you. Law of reproduction brings forth of its kind. These last days, the true church bride comes to the headstone. Will be the super church, a super race. &gt;&gt; Just like you've never heard it before. I believe he's talking about you. &gt;&gt; Is this working? TDJs can say something in the denom in the denominational world. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And tell them something that pumps them up and they shout for a half an hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No reality to it. &gt;&gt; John Haggy AND I'M I'M RESPECTFUL OF THESE MEN. JOHN HAGEN CAN SAY SOMETHING AND THEY APPLAUD FOR 10 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; BILL CLINTON, AS ROTTEN AS HE IS, IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHEST PAID SPEAKERS THERE IS IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE SIT WITH ATOMIC WORTH. &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY SAID IT. ED BISCLL DIDN'T SAY THIS. &gt;&gt; RON SPENCER DIDN'T SAY THIS. &gt;&gt; AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS WASN'T EVEN WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S THOUGHTS. YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER RON, HOW SURE IS THAT?" &gt;&gt; I MADE THIS QUOTATION. IT'S GOOD FOR TONIGHT. IF GOD WOULD HAVE WANTED THE MOON TO HAVE BEEN GREEN CHEESE WHEN NEIL ARMSTRONG LANDED ON THE MOON, HE WOULD HAVE LANDED AND WOULD HAVE PUT HIS FOOT ALL THE WAY TO HIS KNEE IN GREEN CHEESE. IF HE'D HAVE WANTED A HORSE TO HAVE TWO HEADS ON IT, THAT HORSE THAT I'VE GOT IN MY LAWN OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE A HEAD ON THIS END AND A HEAD ON THIS END. &gt;&gt; IF HE WANTED A CAMEL TO HAVE 42 HUMPS ON IT, IT HAVE 42 HUMPS ON IT. &gt;&gt; AND IF HE WANTED A CARIBOU TO HAVE A 42IN HORN, &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT CARIBOU AND IF GOD WANTS YOU TO BE A SUPER CHURCH, &gt;&gt; come on. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Listen, THE PENTECOSTALS COULDN'T HANDLE THIS. &gt;&gt; This is not FOR THE METHODISTS. THIS IS NOT FOR THE BAPTIST. AND I'M SORRY THIS IS NOT FOR A LOT OF MESSAGE people &gt;&gt; but this IS FOR THE CALEB AND THE Joshua of the message OF OH BROTHER I SEE A MESS. I SEE THIS AND I SEE THAT. LISTEN I CAN'T SEE NOTHING BUT A SUPER RICH A SUPER CHURCH. A CRY MING HERSELF. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He said as they near that great headstone, THEY WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; Even they will be in HIS VERY IMAGE IN ORDER TO BE UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL BE WHAT? THEY WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF the living God. &gt;&gt; DENOMINATIONS CAN NEVER CAN NEVER CAN NEVER produce this. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE SAID YOU'LL BE BONE OF HIS BONE, LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER, SPIRIT OF HIS SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; ONE IN THE BED, ONE AT THE MEAL. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; GORD. &gt;&gt; HE SAID DENOMINATIONS. HE SAID THEY WILL PRODUCE CREEDS, ENDOLMENTS MIXED WITH THE WORD. IT BRINGS FORTH A HYBRID PRODUCT. HE SAID THE FIRST SON WAS THE SPOKEN SEA WORD OF GOD AND IT HAS IT WAS GIVEN A BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE SAID I'M JUST REVIEWING THE SPIRIT. HE SAID I WAS SPEAKING UP WHAT I SAID. HE SAID A BRIDE PRODUCED TO PRODUCE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; SHE FELL AND THAT'S WHAT THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN TO PRODUCE HIMSELF. AGAIN ANOTHER SON OF GOD BUT SHE FELL BY HYPEREATING. PRODUCED HIMSELF BUT SHE FELL CAUSED HIM TO DIE. THE SECOND SON, a spoken seed word of God, &gt;&gt; WAS GIVEN A BRIDE LIKE ADAM. &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE COULD MARRY HER, SHE HAD FALLEN ALSO. &gt;&gt; FOR SHE WAS PUT TO FREE MORAL AGENCY LIKE ADAM'S WIFE WAS TO BELIEVE GOD'S WORD AND TO LIVE OR DOUBT IT AND DIE. AND SHE DID. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEN FROM a little group &gt;&gt; of the true seed of the word, &gt;&gt; GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST, &gt;&gt; A BELOVED BRIDE, &gt;&gt; A VIRGIN, A VIRGIN OF HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THEM AND BY THEM WILL BE FULFILLED ALL THAT HAS BEEN PROMISED FOR HIS WORD. THE VIRGIN WHO KNOWS NO NO NO MAN-MADE CRAVES OR DOGMAS. &gt;&gt; SHE KEEPS HERSELF FOCUSED. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE MANIFEST WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE. SO TO FULFILL ALL THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OF HIM. AND AS HE DID WHEN HE CAME FROM THE VIRGIN WOMB, TYPE OF TYPE OF THE SPIRIT WOMB NOW SO WILL THE VIRGIN ACCEPTING HIS word be it UNTO ME AS THOU HAS SAID THOUGH IT WAS SAID BY AN ANGEL YET IT WAS WRITTEN WITH A WRITTEN WORD ISAIAH 96 THEY WILL LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT THEY BROTHER RON? THEY'RE HERE, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. BUT I SO WANT THE HOLY GHOST. I SO NEED THIS AND I SO NEED THAT. LISTEN, OUR LORD JESUS WAS IN THIS BUILDING BEFORE YOU WAS. &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO WORSHIP TONIGHT BEFORE YOU EVEN ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG GOD FOR SOMETHING. HE'S HERE TO GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU'RE HIS WIFE &gt;&gt; SAID THEY WILL LOVE HIM &gt;&gt; AND WILL HAVE HIS POTENTIALS FOR HE IS THEIR HEAD AND THEY ARE HIS SUBJECTS SUBJECT TO THE HEAD HIS HEADSHIP OF CHRIST THAT WAS HIS &gt;&gt; notice he said what harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him first. &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother Ron, that's a long quote, but I'm reading about you." &gt;&gt; John 5:19. He said, "So will the bride." And he shows her his word of life. &gt;&gt; He shows her. &gt;&gt; SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S SHE DOING AT THE END OF THE FENCE? SHE'S NOT DOUBTING IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE TONIGHT? YOU'RE NOT DOUBTING IT. &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. HE SAID NOTHING CAN HARM HER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN DEATH. &gt;&gt; FOR IF THE SEED BE PLANTED, THE WATER WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "HERE IS THE SECRET. THE WORD IS IN the bride." &gt;&gt; THE WORD WAS SO PLANTED IN CALEB, &gt;&gt; SO ANCHORED IN HIM. HE HAD HEARD IT. HE HAD HEARD IT. HE HAD HEARD IT. AND HE BELIEVED IT. HE RECEIVED IT. AND WHEN HE WENT ACROSS THERE, THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD COME BACK WITH AN EVIL REPORT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN MISS THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; No way. You say, "BROTHER RON, I'M SO AFRAID I'M GOING TO MISS IT." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. THE RAPTURE IS IN ME. &gt;&gt; IT IS IN PROCESS EVEN AS WE SPEAK NOW. CHANGING THIS BODY. &gt;&gt; One of THESE MORNINGS WE'LL GET THAT LAST CHANGE and we'll GO MEET OUR LORD IN THE AIR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BELIEVERS BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; She stood there and heard it in her ears. &gt;&gt; Let them say what they want to say about my dress. &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT MY HAIR. &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT MY BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT MY CHURCH AND MY PASTOR. GOT A FEW MORE MINUTES. &gt;&gt; In a few more minutes, &gt;&gt; you won't have nobody to pick on. I'm going to finish with this tonight. I'm going quit. Can you imagine before even time you start assembling an army of demons, you're cast into the earth. You spend 6,000 years banding and training and talking about warfare and positioning. anchoring against the bride. &gt;&gt; Stay right there. &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE SEALS ARE RELEASED AND YOU GET 200,000 MORE &gt;&gt; AT your disposal. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; LOOSE FROM THE RIVER EUPHRATES. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND ALL HELL &gt;&gt; IS TURNED AGAINST THAT GROUND. DO YOU REALIZE HOW TERRIFIED &gt;&gt; HE IS of you? &gt;&gt; MEN STAND 7 FOOT TALL, DRIBBLE A BALL, PUT IN A BASKET. Come on. &gt;&gt; MEN LIFT WEIGHTS A,000 LBS OVER THEIR HEAD. &gt;&gt; That don't scare the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; MEN HAVE 20 YEARS OF EDUCATION. &gt;&gt; CONFOUND THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND CAN'T FIND THEIR WAY ACROSS THE STREET. EINSTEIN GOT TOTALLY LOST ONE DAY AND HE CALLED HIS SECRETARY AND HE SAID, "CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE MR. EINSTEIN LIVES?" SHE SAID, "I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION." HE SAID, "THIS IS HIM." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT DON'T SCARE THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT SCARES THE DEVIL. I GOT THIS TRUCK. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THIS LITTLE GUY RIGHT HERE &gt;&gt; is armed &gt;&gt; WITH ATOMIC POWER. AND HE KNOWS THAT JUST ANYTIME HE COULD DROP A BOTTLE. How tall are you? &gt;&gt; Short. Shaquille O'Neal was not intimidated by him. That's right. &gt;&gt; His physique. The great weightlifterss of the world pick them up and carry him around. &gt;&gt; But the classiest demons of hell &gt;&gt; watch him when his little eyelids go &gt;&gt; AND THEY GO, "HE'S AWAKE. HE GO MAY GO DOWN THE HALL AND he starts singing, "This is the day. &gt;&gt; This is the day &gt;&gt; that the Lord has made." &gt;&gt; That the Lord has made. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I get excited. &gt;&gt; We shall rejoice. We shall rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; And be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is a day that the Lord has &gt;&gt; and demons in another dimension start shaking. &gt;&gt; WHY, BROTHER RON? HE HAS AUTHORITY. THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE HAS ATOMIC POWER. &gt;&gt; Right in his vocal cords. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're nuts. I got kids in the kindergarten that stand up and says a teacher one day as says he said he said uh he he asked him some question like DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST SIN WAS? HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES. He said it was sex. NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR. LISTEN, THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY GET OLD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ANCHORED IN THEIR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIS AGE &gt;&gt; TO FULL MATURITY. &gt;&gt; I know it's unfair. You won't get your driver's license, but you won't need it. MY BROTHER &gt;&gt; Satan scared to death. That little guy. laying inside of him's potential. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that'll make him strut. He's something special. He is. &gt;&gt; He is something special. &gt;&gt; So are you. &gt;&gt; So are you. &gt;&gt; SO ARE YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY LOVE HIM &gt;&gt; FOR THEY HAVE HIS POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; THEY receive it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they never &gt;&gt; NEVER NEVER DOUBT IT. &gt;&gt; Never doubt it. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight.

Oh God, our words, our lips. So we would say to the songwriter, oh for a THOUSAND TONGUES &gt;&gt; RIGHT now to sing your praise. &gt;&gt; Oh God, the angels cannot enjoy what we are enjoying now. &gt;&gt; The lost cannot enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Your children do. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for strengthening brother Ron Spencer. &gt;&gt; We thank you for strengthening. We thank you for your healing. We give you praise for him. Oh God, you made a provision even for this service. Lord, when you allow the Roman cruel scourge to come across the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, you are laying healing power, &gt;&gt; making it available to us, making it available to our brother Ron tonight. Lord, making it available to every sick and afflicted person that might be in this audience in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you are defeated. You by his stripes we are healed. Lord, we pray that you will just guide us &gt;&gt; and we'll be sensitive to your voice. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Let's say tonight, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We freely clap our hands.

Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Amen. Oh, thank you, Lord. May it be that this area, Birch Bay, &gt;&gt; Bellingham, and Blaine and all this area, may it be they've never heard a sound like will come from this campground. Brother Ron spoke to the young people this morning and brother Tom felt led to do that because uh said it gives the minister an opportunity and gives the people an opportunity to just become a little bit more acquainted. Brother Ron, I invited him to come up and his wife Sister Connie who's here. We're so happy they're both able to be here. Hard for her mother, especially to leave the family and leave the children. Uh this is the second trip in just a short time. Uh but our brother Ron was speaking to the young people and he told them this morning, I thought I just he can relate it a lot better than I can, but I thought it was appropriate just now while you're standing. He was in the hospital and he entered into prayer. He couldn't have any light on because his his body and the eyes and everything was light sensitive because of the stroke and what he had experienced. And so the room was dark and the nurses had to when they came in the room just had a little light to do their duties. and a new nurse came in that hadn't been there and she was new I believe with the hospital but anyway she came into the room but he had just been praying and a presence I have a reason to say this a presence just came into that room prior to the nurse entering and when she came in she began to speak to him and asked him about he his prayer about him praying praying and what had happened. And she said that what he had she wanted. &gt;&gt; And she knelt at his bed in the darkness. He began to hear her before before she began to talk to him. He heard her begin to sniffle. And and then she was already under the effect &gt;&gt; of that presence. &gt;&gt; She didn't know who it was. She didn't know what this man was. &gt;&gt; Knew a little bit about him, but before a few minutes, she's on her knees. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said something in the in the message, his last message to the world. And I will say it was the Lord Jesus Christ giving us, you are people of books. You study, you've come home. I've seen some of you walking on the street. You have sackloads of books. You've studied them. You've been diligent. And I don't want to shame you, but you've been more diligent with those books than you've been with the message. &gt;&gt; And that ought not to be. &gt;&gt; You ought to, if you can pack school books around, you ought to be able to pack message books around. You can pack those books around, you ought to pack your Bible around. One's got eternal life and the other one will only stand you good for a little while in this life. &gt;&gt; And when this life's over, what you learned in those books will do you no good at all. But what you learned in the books that God sent will give you will give you a good standing on the other side. &gt;&gt; And that message leadership he said every person you are led. There isn't one of you standing here, young or old, that is not being led. You're being led by something and by somebody. &gt;&gt; So, we just settled that you are being led. &gt;&gt; But he made a strange statement. I thought I would be preaching on it and I might yet, but I I I believe that it's in order at the closing of this service when the young rich ruler came running to Jesus and he said, "Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus told him finally what to do. And he said, "This is a hard saying. He couldn't do it." and he walked away sad because he couldn't sell all that he had and give it to the poor. Brother Brandon makes this very strange statement. He said he was confronted with eternal life. He come running to a man. He thought it was a man. He thought I this is Jesus of Nazareth. This is a man. They call him a prophet. I'm going to go and hear what he says. &gt;&gt; But a prophet now in this day said he wasn't confronted with a man. He didn't say he was confronted with a man. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. He was confronted with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in him was life. &gt;&gt; And this man was confronted with eternal life. &gt;&gt; Here it is. You came. Oh yeah. This Cloverdale Bible way camp. Oh, we have it every year. Some of you have been here year after year after year. We've come to this camp. We have a new speaker, a brother Spencer. He hasn't come here before. We have him this year. And you you came and you say, "Well, I you don't call this a confrontation." Confrontations, we don't like confrontations, but some of them are necessary. &gt;&gt; Some of them are necessary. &gt;&gt; Sometimes a confrontation is necessary when the truth needs to be spoken and established. You didn't expect to be confronted, but you said this, Brother Ron Spencer. Well, I'll just tell you, just beneath that skin &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ came and just used him tonight &gt;&gt; and came right to your face &gt;&gt; and confronted you with eternal life. And you're standing here right now deciding what you're going to do with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what happened tonight. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. &gt;&gt; And the rest of this congregation ought to give me 110% support. &gt;&gt; That's what happened with your young people. And for SOME OF YOU, FOR SOME OF YOU, this is a very critical moment. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Ron Spencer. It's not brother Tom Ray. It's not brother Ed Biscll. It's not YOUR PASTOR. IT'S NOT THAT. GOD CAME. JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; THROUGH MAN AND HAS CONFRONTED YOU WITH ETERNAL LIFE. AND YOUR PROPHET SAID HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND HE TURNED ETERNAL LIFE DOWN. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. That's right. &gt;&gt; Tonight, I'm smitten &gt;&gt; at the very prospects that anybody could turn Jesus Christ down. &gt;&gt; THAT ANYBODY COULD LOOK AT eternal life. &gt;&gt; IN HIM WAS LIFE. &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST JESUS OF NAZARETH, &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ETERNAL LIFE. AND FOR some riches and for some and what what what is your excuse? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOURS? &gt;&gt; SOME FRIEND SO-CALLED, SOME LITTLE HABIT YOU HAVE, SOME DESIRE YOU HAVE, SOME LUST YOU HAVE, SOME STRONG DESIRE YOU HAVE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN DOWN ETERNAL LIFE FOR THAT. WELL, I GOT SOME CHIP ON MY SHOULDER. I SAY SHAME on you. And with THIS KIND OF SUPPORT AND THIS KIND OF LOVE AND THIS KIND OF PREVAILING IN FACT IS I'M GOING TO DROP ANOTHER BOMB. I'm not EVEN GOING TO INVITE YOU. If you want it bad enough, you plow through ALL OF YOUR ALL of your context in your mind. You plow through it because THIS JESUS ALSO SAID YOU CAN'T EVEN COME UNLESS THE HOLY GHOST draws you. AND YOU GOT TO DECIDE NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO DECIDE WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE. THIS IS GOD CALLING ME. &gt;&gt; AND IF IT'S NOT GOD CALLING YOU, I WOULDN'T WANT YOU RESPONDING. I WOULDN'T WANT YOU STANDING HERE. I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT necessarily for you to RAISE YOUR HAND. UNLESS YOU HAVE A DESPERATION IN YOUR HEART, SAY, "OH, GOD, SPEAK TO ME. &gt;&gt; Call me. Let me hear your voice so I can respond. We're not trying to win any medals. We don't need numbers. WE NEED THOSE THAT GOD HAS CALLED, THAT GOD IS TALKING TO, THAT JESUS CONFRONTED TONIGHT. AND IF HE HAS CONFRONTED TO YOU, IF HE'S CONFRONTED YOU, I SAY BY ALL MEANS COME, BY ALL MEANS GIVE YOURSELF. THE APOSTLE PAUL SAID TO King Aria AND KING ARIA SAID UH PAUL PAUL UH ALMOST THOU PERSUADEEST ME TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN AND APOSTLE PAUL KNEW THAT IT WAS JESUS CHRIST IN HIM CONFRONTING THAT KING. AND WHEN HE CONFRONTED THAT KING THAT'S WHY APOSTLE PAUL SAID I WOULD THAT YOU ARE NOT ALMOST BUT ALTOGETHER PERSUADED. AND THERE'S SOME YOUNG PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. I WOULD SAY TO YOU, I WOULD THAT YOU WERE NOT ALL LOST. I WOULD THAT YOU WERE NOT ON THE EDGE, BUT I WOULD THAT YOU WERE ALL TOGETHER PERSUADED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JUST AS I AM, &gt;&gt; WITHOUT ONE PLEA, &gt;&gt; JUST WHAT I AM, JUST WHAT I HAVE, &gt;&gt; I GIVE MYSELF &gt;&gt; completely over to Christ. &gt;&gt; If you feel that pull, IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT VOICE, THEN YOU CAN COME. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT, YOU CANNOT COME. BUT IF YOU HAVE HEARD IT, I SAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, DON'T YOU DARE TURN HIM DOWN. IF you do, IT MIGHT BE YOUR VERY LAST TIME. You say, "Oh, I've heard that before." YOU'LL ALSO HEAR THAT for the last time. &gt;&gt; Our brother Ron Spencer, there's one other last one that he didn't mention that I know he wants to mention and the prophet MENTIONED IT AND I'M looking forward. HE SAID, "WE'LL PREACH." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. FOR THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; WE'LL PUT OUR BIBLE UP. WE'LL PUT THE SWORD IN THE SHEATH AND IT'LL NEVER COME OUT AGAIN. AND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANOTHER SERMON LIKE THIS AFTER THAT TIME. THERE'LL BE PEOPLE PREACHING, BUT NOT THE KIND OF MESSAGES YOU'RE HEARING. GOD IS GOING TO SILENCE THEM AS HE SILENCED THE PROPHET'S LIPS. HE SILENCED THE LIPS OF THE LORD JESUS. He's going to silence the lips of the bride. And you won't hear this kind of preaching anymore. &gt;&gt; You haven't heard me speak like this ever before in a camp. But I'm speaking to you now. And if you're almost persuaded and you know that you're not right with God and you know that you've not surrendered your life, I can tell you right now, tonight's the night. &gt;&gt; And if God's not speaking to you, you can't even come. And if God's not speaking to you, I'm not inviting you. &gt;&gt; Say, "That's a hard thing. Jesus said it &gt;&gt; and he said it a lot harder. &gt;&gt; And he saw them all leave. &gt;&gt; You're going to vacate this place tonight, but you won't vacate it like those that left Jesus. And he saw them leave him and being offended. WE DON'T LIKE WHAT HE'S SAYING. We don't like the way he's saying it. And Jesus let them go. And he never ran after them. He didn't send his disciples after them. He didn't have a visitation COMMITTEE. HE LET THEM GO. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go that way. But if you do, so be it. &gt;&gt; BUT IF GOD'S TALKING TO YOU, you better surrender your life. And you need to surrender it now. &gt;&gt; Some of you have been weighing it out. And I've been calling your name before God's throne. &gt;&gt; Last night &gt;&gt; and before and tonight. Some that are here and some that aren't here. I've been calling your name before God's throne. I've been calling it because you need it. YOU NEED SOMEBODY PRAYING FOR YOU. AND I'VE BEEN PRAYING, OH GOD, BREAK THE SHACKLES OF THEIR MIND. BREAK IT, OH GOD. AND DON'T LET THEM BE ALMOST, BUT LET THEM BE COMPLETELY PERSUADED &gt;&gt; to come. I give you this one invitation. And we're going to sing this c this psalm just as I am without one plea. And there's ministers here to come and pray with you. Come right up boldly if you wish. If you wish. And we're and this is the only invitation we're going to have. Then we're going to close. Just as &gt;&gt; I am without one me, but that thy blood was shed for me and that th come to thee. Oh lamb of God I come and waiting not just as I am and wait I'm not going to wait Lord you spoken I'm going to come to rid to rid my soul Oh, dark blood. Oh, so dark is the blood to thee whose blood can cleanse each. Why don't counselors and ministers and parents come just as I am without one plea but that &gt;&gt; and those that come only you can call out upon him. I urge you to open your heart and your mouth. I would instruct you in prayer. Call upon the name of the Lord and thou shalt be saved. Oh God, I come. I come. Oh God. Oh God. Let them not be almost but altogether persuaded. Oh sweep oh God upon by your spirit upon this audience of people. Let it be something divine from sent from heaven. Heaven sent. Oh God, may there be a mighty deliverance, a mighty deliverance.

SHINE ON US, OH LIGHT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; We enter into the land that you've given us. We take this mountain. We take this mountain, oh God. We will not be denied. Let the young women dedicate their bodies to you, oh God. Let the young men dedicate their strength to you now, oh God. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, let us be in prayer. And you that are giving your life surrendering wherever you are in the in the area, give vent to how God is speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Speak to him. Let him hear your voice. &gt;&gt; Let him hear your response &gt;&gt; just now. Oh God, &gt;&gt; just now, oh God, &gt;&gt; just now he come. &gt;&gt; Hear the cry of the shackle. Those of you that have come to pray, you pray. You pray. &gt;&gt; You pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You open your mouth. Say, "Oh, God, you know why I'm here. You're the one that spoke to me. You're the one that called. I'm here now because you've called me. &gt;&gt; That's how you get things. Oh, God, hear the cry. of the shackle from the set of time for the chains on their feet.

I pledge &gt;&gt; allegiance to the lamb. &gt;&gt; We'll close &gt;&gt; and we'll send you with that confession coming off of your lips. I'd ask you only to sing it if you mean it. If you intend to make it that way, I have done so tonight. And especially those of you that have made a move and not only those that have come forward, but you've come to a resolve standing right where you are. &gt;&gt; As our brother Ron spoke, I never knew till tonight that that message touched his that boy's heart, that young man's heart. I never knew it till tonight. I remember the service. I remember preaching it. I remember coming to the end of the service saying, "We are the ones that are chosen to run the last lap." And now the now the baton has been handed to you &gt;&gt; and you've been ordered run &gt;&gt; run &gt;&gt; this race. &gt;&gt; You always save in a relay the best &gt;&gt; and THE FASTEST &gt;&gt; TO THE LAST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the Lord knew what he was doing when he brought you on the SCENE TO RUN IN THIS DARK AGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND LAY ON THE SAIL HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE BRIDE OF JESUS Christ &gt;&gt; and WE'LL CROSS THE FINISH LINE &gt;&gt; TO BE RECEIVED &gt;&gt; BY THE SAINTS OF ALL THE AGES. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, MY SISTER, PUT SOME ENERGY INTO YOUR GOSPEL. PUT SOME ENERGY INTO YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; Live valiantly. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; Be faithful to Christ, faithful to the call. And we look forward to seeing you tomorrow, tomorrow evening. All the campers in the day. And if you have something to say 7:00 tomorrow night, 7 like to have you here, Lord willing. We thank you for being here. All right. We'll sing this. And if you have an announcement, Brother Tom announcement, I'll let you close. All right. I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant ro. They were told that we would spare if they were reounce the price. But one by one they chose to die the son of God. They would not deny my good praise telling why you sing. I can almost hear their voice. I also to the lamb. To the lamb of God who bore my pain, who took my place and bore my shame. I will sing to honor his coming. Hallelujah. Angel to the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. Bless your name. Bless your name. We bless your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

We must be breaking into that one eternal day. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what that's becoming a reality, saints. &gt;&gt; It's becoming a reality. As I saying to the young people this afternoon, the gap is getting greater. The gap is getting greater. The saints are going higher. And those that want to come, they're going lower. But I say, come and go with me to my father's house. COME AND GO WITH US. WE'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP AND we're getting carried away. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. You that have come to this evening service and have to go your way. If you wouldn't mind just making your way out the tent, greet one another, shake one another's hand, but keep riding on. And that'll help us just direct the young people here for the various things that we have for them. We appreciate that. We appreciate all you're doing and your support, your prayers to make these meetings such as they are. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to take that handshake. So, we've been praying for your meetings. We've been praying for the young people. You don't know what that does for me because I know that God has heard the prayers of his people. So, God bless you. As you make your way out, we'll have a word of prayer. Lord, we feel that the spirit of God is beckoning, pulling, calling, and Father, there's those that are responding. And so we just say, Lord, would you do this work within their lives that their hearts are calling for a victorious life in the Holy Ghost to stand as the redeemed, Lord, throughout the ages, Lord, they're willing to be identified for what they've heard this evening. And so, Father, we're asking that you will go with your children. May this presence that is here go with each and every one, whether it be in their cabin, whether it be in their car. Lord, may your nearness so ignite this expectation within their souls, realizing who they are in Christ. We're praying, Father, that you will protect those that are on the road. Keep them safe and watch over the remainder of the camp. Lord, you've blessed us with this fine weather. You've blessed us with this presence, Lord. This sen of God, we just pray it'll continue on tomorrow morning and tomorrow evening. Father, may you just come in in a special way.

So Lord, let him reach to that promise that says the lamb of God has come by his way tonight. The word of God that's back in the song. You're here by the grace of almighty God. Would you anchor that deep within his heart? Make him a man, Lord, that can stand up, say, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; turn his life around for the glory of God." &gt;&gt; And let him stand, Lord, under the man, the blood washed. willing to say, "Lord, forgive me of my sins.
