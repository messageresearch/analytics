[0:40] house of God. We're happy to be here
[0:42] this morning. I am. Are you happy to be
[0:44] here this morning? Amen.
[0:47] [Music]
[0:49] Just reading
[0:51] this morning, brother Brandham said,
[0:53] "Now as we as children,
[0:57] how many familiar with the way children
[0:58] act?" Says, "As children and offering to
[1:01] thee the praises of our lips, oh maybe
[1:03] not orderly, Lord, but it's just
[1:05] children. You understand it. No matter
[1:07] how much we would try to use our manners
[1:10] and intellect might not come from the
[1:12] heart.
[1:15] It's something artificially putting on.
[1:17] But when we from our heart offer you the
[1:20] adorations that's in there for you, I'm
[1:23] sure it'll be received. Amen. And
[1:26] adoration is not a word that's used very
[1:28] much,
[1:31] but we want to adore him this morning.
[1:33] Amen. Let's stand as we uh come before
[1:37] him this morning. I want to sing down
[1:39] from his glory, Eflat.
[1:42] And let's just
[1:44] focus on him.
[1:47] Amen.
[1:48] And if somebody gets a little unruly,
[1:50] maybe like a child, and just starts
[1:53] worshiping God. Amen. That's what we
[1:55] want. Amen.
[1:58] You know, you can get in the flesh, but
[1:59] if you're holding back, you're just as
[2:01] much in the flesh as if you're not
[2:03] turning loose. Amen. So, we just want to
[2:06] follow God's leading this morning. Amen.
[2:08] Let's just worship him as we sing these
[2:11] songs of glory.
[2:14] down from his glory.
[2:22] So,

[17:07] well. Had a minor stroke and so we want
[17:09] to be praying for him. If you've got a

[17:15] go to prayer. Amen. Doesn't matter how
[17:18] small it is or how big it is. We've got
[17:21] a God who's interested in all of our
[17:23] problems and all of our needs. Amen.
[17:25] Brother V, if you'd come,
[17:29] [Music]
[17:37] oh God, oh heavenly father, Lord,
[17:42] father, as we worship Lord, we felt your
[17:44] presence, Lord. Lord Jesus, your word
[17:47] says, Lord, that if there weren't
[17:49] anybody to praise you, Lord, the rocks
[17:50] would cry out, Lord. Father, we're so
[17:53] thankful for these lively stones, Lord
[17:55] Jesus, that you poured your spirit into,
[17:57] Lord, that could worship you in spirit
[17:59] and in truth, Father. How we adore you,
[18:02] Lord. You deserve to be adored. Lord,
[18:04] how you set the set the captive free,
[18:06] Lord. We're sitting here, Lord, as your
[18:09] token, Lord, of what you've done in this
[18:11] hour, Lord Jesus. And Father God, we
[18:14] lift our hands in adoration and respect
[18:16] to the word of God this morning for what
[18:19] you've done in our lives. Lord, we're so
[18:21] thankful God. We worship you, Lord. We
[18:24] bless your holy name. Lord, we think of
[18:27] these prayers that Lord, that have come
[18:29] forth this morning. And Lord, our sister
[18:31] Judy, Lord, wanting us to join our
[18:34] hearts with her for her father. Oh God,
[18:37] would you go to him now, Lord? And
[18:40] father, would you visit him and will you
[18:42] pour revelation into his heart? Oh God,
[18:44] may you ever bring him close. Oh God,
[18:47] our precious sister Judy, Lord, has
[18:49] lived a life and has a right, Lord. And
[18:52] she's coming to your throne, Lord. And
[18:53] we bring these prayers before the
[18:55] cherubams, oh God. Would you go to him
[18:57] now, Lord, and send those that just your
[19:00] angels, Lord, and minister unto him, oh
[19:02] God. And Lord, we know that prayers are
[19:04] more powerful than any atomic bomb,
[19:06] Lord. Just go to the brother now, Lord.
[19:08] And minister to his heart. And this
[19:10] other sister Judy, Lord, don't know her.
[19:12] You know her, Father. In pain, oh God,
[19:16] you are the great physician. Oh Lord, go
[19:18] to her. Father, we pray. Oh God, may
[19:21] your hand touch her. Lord, may she touch
[19:23] the hem of your garment, oh God. Just go
[19:25] to her now. Lord, I think of my own
[19:28] wife, Lord, also in the same situation.
[19:30] I pray, oh God, for a special touch from
[19:32] you, Lord. Oh God, we bind our hearts
[19:35] with these, oh God, and raise their
[19:37] names, Lord, before you, oh God. That,
[19:39] oh Lord, what a privilege we have to
[19:41] come to the throne this morning. And
[19:43] Lord, we pray for this other brother,
[19:45] Lord, amongst them, I believe. Lord,
[19:47] whatever his need was, Lord, I believe a
[19:49] stroke, Father God. Oh Lord, you are you

[33:02] Hallelujah.
[33:05] Amen. We're so blessed.
[33:08] We are so blessed.
[33:10] Amen.
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] We're going to bless a little one now.
[33:18] Brother Ed's going to come. We got a
[33:24] my little granddaughter.
[33:26] And we just love to pieces.
[33:29] And we just uh so thankful for God to
[33:32] God for all that he's given us. states.
[33:35] We're not worthy, but we just
[33:37] continually thank him for many his many
[33:39] blessings.
[33:42] As Jar and Joanne
[33:44] come, let's sing again. We bless your
[33:46] name. We bless your name. We give you
[33:48] honor, Lord. We give you praise.
[33:52] We bless your name.
[33:58] We bless your name. Heat. Heat.
[34:08] [Music]
[34:18] [Music]
[34:20] the truth.
[34:25] We bless your name.
[34:31] We bless your name.
[34:37] And in everything we do, we bless his
[34:39] name.
[34:41] Whether it's in preaching the word,
[34:44] singing song, or dedicating a baby,
[34:48] dedicating a child. And brother Jeremy
[34:52] and Sister Joanna have brought their
[34:56] latest addition to the family and to the
[35:00] church,
[35:02] and we're really happy for that.
[35:05] Uh, I have some scriptures which
[35:07] actually pertain to a young man in the
[35:10] Bible, not even a child, but a young
[35:12] man. His name was Timothy.
[35:15] And
[35:17] Paul had uh just a an incredible
[35:22] relationship, I would say, with Timothy.
[35:25] Timothy had such a place in Paul's
[35:27] heart. And I just want to read these
[35:29] scriptures. and to Timothy, my beloved
[35:33] son.
[35:35] Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
[35:38] Father in Christ Jesus our Lord. I thank
[35:42] God whom I serve
[35:44] from my forefathers with pure conscience
[35:47] that without ceasing I have remembrance
[35:50] of thee in my prayers night and day
[35:54] greatly desiring to see thee being
[35:57] mindful of thy tears that I may be
[36:00] filled with joy when I call to
[36:01] remembrance
[36:03] the unfeigned faith that is in thee that
[36:07] dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois.
[36:11] and in thy mother Ununice. And I'm
[36:14] persuaded that in thee also. And I got
[36:17] thinking about this scene that we have
[36:18] here today.
[36:21] And we're going to dedicate Elelliana
[36:24] Maurice. Did I say that right? Good.
[36:28] And uh but this didn't happen just uh
[36:33] this wasn't just an idea of brother
[36:36] Jeremy and sister Joanna's
[36:38] because uh the parents of both of these
[36:41] parents are here and so they contributed
[36:45] brother Peter and sister Barbiner
[36:49] and I believe that their faith
[36:52] has contributed to Joanna's faith
[36:55] &gt;&gt; and the faith of brother Jeremy. The
[36:58] faith of brother Rod and sister Cindy
[37:03] have contributed in rearing brother
[37:06] Jeremy to stand here. And then they too
[37:09] in faith. And brother Brandham said one
[37:12] place he said the faith of the parents
[37:16] have brought these children this baby.
[37:19] And the baby was in need of healing. But
[37:22] he was now tying it back to the faith of
[37:24] the parents have brought the child for
[37:28] the blessing of healing and you have
[37:30] brought this child for the blessing of
[37:33] dedication and giving it back to God. I
[37:36] also thought
[37:38] of
[37:40] where David had said that the children
[37:43] there are the heritage of the Lord
[37:45] literally they're the possession of the
[37:47] Lord. And so God has given this life,
[37:51] this jewel, Elelliana Maurice to you and
[37:56] you will care for her and God will wait
[38:00] patiently for his reward because it says
[38:03] that they are also his reward and she'll
[38:06] come to the age of accountability if
[38:07] time will go on and I am praying and
[38:11] that's the purpose of this time that her
[38:14] life will be a credit to the gospel.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; That her life will be an example to
[38:18] other young people and that very early
[38:21] she'll begin to express this and then
[38:24] God will begin to get his reward.
[38:27] And so you, brother Jeremy and sister
[38:30] Joanna,
[38:32] I
[38:33] trust that you'll con always have this
[38:36] in your mind. This child has been lent
[38:38] to us, put in our care, and now we will
[38:42] raise her because this is God's
[38:44] possession, God's inheritance, and
[38:47] someday we want her to be a reward to
[38:50] him. Amen.
[38:57] Amen. I'll have you join with me in
[39:00] prayer.
[39:02] Heavenly Father, I hold and embrace this
[39:05] child,
[39:07] Elelliana Maurice. Oh God,
[39:10] uh I pray, Father, that
[39:13] she will always be
[39:16] uh within your supervision
[39:20] under your leadership.
[39:22] May your eyes always be on her. And I
[39:26] pray that good will follow her all the
[39:28] days of her life. I pray that she will
[39:31] have good health. I pray, Father, she'll
[39:34] have good understanding.
[39:36] I pray she'll have a real appetite for
[39:38] spiritual things. And may her heart
[39:41] yearn to know about Christ, about God.
[39:46] And I pray, Father, that you will take
[39:48] brothers Jeremy and sister Joanna and
[39:51] give them, dear Lord, the wisdom that
[39:53] they will need, the faith, the continued
[39:56] faith, Lord, that they will direct her
[39:59] footsteps in all the things of God, even
[40:02] from a very, very early child. May she
[40:05] come to know you, Lord. And then I pray
[40:08] that her life will be a grace to the
[40:11] gospel. I pray that it'll be an example
[40:14] of of the message that we believe and
[40:17] hold so dearly to our hearts. And now,
[40:20] Father, as you have given this jewel to
[40:24] brother Jeremy, Sister Joanna, now they
[40:26] stand here and we dedicate her back to
[40:29] you. We dedicate Elelliana Maurice in
[40:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:37] Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:43] God bless you. God bless brother Jeremy.
[40:48] God bless you.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Want to greet you all in the name of the
[40:56] Lord Jesus Christ. You've already been
[40:58] welcomed and heard the songs of worship
[41:02] and how wonderful that is.
[41:06] And it's just good to be in the house of
[41:07] God, isn't it?
[41:10] I received these greetings just a little
[41:12] bit too late to show you the picture,
[41:14] but our brother Jonathan Larga has just
[41:17] gotten married and brother Milco and uh
[41:21] brother Micah Dega were both over there
[41:25] uh representing us and participated in
[41:29] bringing greetings from us to them. And
[41:31] I sent an official note to brother
[41:33] Jonathan. His wife's name is Anna. and
[41:37] they sent an email back with some
[41:39] pictures, but I can't get the pictures
[41:40] to you this quickly. I just received it
[41:43] after I got here to the church. So, he
[41:46] wanted to send greetings to the
[41:48] congregation. They feel a connection and
[41:50] they stream all the meetings. So, they
[41:52] they they do know you uh and uh for
[41:55] those of you that uh met Jonathan and
[41:59] such a fine spirit, such an excellent
[42:02] spirit. And I can say that you you
[42:05] didn't know his father, but his father
[42:08] was uh you know they talk about the the
[42:11] unknown tongues in the Bible which on
[42:14] the unknown word is not there but it's
[42:16] languages
[42:18] and and Jonathan's father be he was so
[42:22] had such a uh he was just obsessed to
[42:26] get the message to his people and he
[42:29] began translating. He was a a former
[42:32] school teacher. He was a school teacher.
[42:34] Came to a meeting that that uh I was
[42:37] having in a city called Novasad.
[42:41] And uh he came there and came to the
[42:43] knowledge of the message and just was uh
[42:47] from that moment on he just gave his
[42:49] life, dedicated it to it. And they moved
[42:50] down into Croatia. He was teaching there
[42:53] and he was translating the message. And
[42:56] I've told this here before, but I was I
[42:59] always had a contention with brother
[43:00] Milo because he'd read the he'd read the
[43:02] messages in in the servo creation
[43:05] language and oh, he said, "It's just so
[43:07] wonderful." And I said, "But but he
[43:10] doesn't speak English. He doesn't speak
[43:12] any English." Oh, you know what? What
[43:15] message is that? So, he'd say, "Well,
[43:17] this is this message." And he said, "No,
[43:19] I'm telling you, it's perfect.
[43:20] Absolutely perfect." Well, with brother
[43:22] Mila, most things are perfect. And uh so
[43:25] I said how can it be perfect? I mean you
[43:27] know and he said it is it is absolutely
[43:30] perfect. So um
[43:33] uh brother Jonathan now has you know he
[43:36] has a very good grasp of the English
[43:38] language and he's just picked up right
[43:40] where his father left off because his
[43:42] father as you know has passed away
[43:44] passed away young and uh it was very
[43:48] heavy on our heart but it's a large
[43:51] family maybe six or seven children and
[43:55] young ladies and I wish you could see
[43:57] them if they were to stand on the
[43:58] platform today they are the
[44:01] personification of this message just
[44:04] absolutely beautiful family and that
[44:08] wife she continued to raise them they
[44:11] lived on meager fair uh lived on just
[44:13] whatever they had they don't have the
[44:15] social network that we have over here in
[44:18] the western countries and uh they they
[44:21] managed we sent them some help from here
[44:23] from time to time and the young people
[44:26] became educated you know and Jonathan he
[44:29] continued to study
[44:31] And now God brought this young woman,
[44:33] Anna. Uh, and they don't have a
[44:35] congregation to speak of, but they have
[44:37] meetings. And he's just carried on his
[44:40] father's in his father's footsteps. And
[44:42] he's just a he's just a dead ringer for
[44:45] him. He He's about the same size and
[44:47] looks exactly the same. He's doing
[44:49] exactly the same work. And it's just
[44:50] like God took one off the earth and put
[44:52] another one right there. You can't
[44:54] hardly tell any difference. And now he's
[44:57] gotten married and carrying on. Well,
[44:59] I'm happy that they got married and that
[45:00] we were able to send greetings to them.
[45:02] But I'm especially happy that he's
[45:04] carrying on the work. Amen. And that's
[45:06] so beautiful. It's just so wonderful.
[45:09] But they feel a they feel a connection
[45:11] much greater connection with us perhaps
[45:14] than you as individuals can feel with
[45:16] them because you don't know them as as
[45:18] as well as uh I do for example. But I
[45:21] just take it from me. they feel very
[45:23] very connected to you and they look in
[45:25] the streaming and see the faces and
[45:27] who's here and and they and when
[45:30] somebody's name is mentioned they
[45:31] remember that right away you know so I
[45:34] I'd like to give you greetings. We have
[45:37] an another wonderful email which I
[45:39] received from brother Ernie Villan Noea.
[45:42] He went to have meetings with brother
[45:43] Elijah Gibbs but he left a few days
[45:46] early and he wanted to go and see uh his
[45:50] his family. Uh you know here in the
[45:53] church we've been praying for his mother
[45:56] who had cancer in her lung and was up
[45:59] for an operation. Had a critical
[46:01] operation just a few days ago. uh she
[46:04] came through the operation uh
[46:06] successfully. Surgeon said the operation
[46:09] was successful. But brother Ernie has
[46:11] been burdened for his family for so many
[46:14] years because they were really really uh
[46:18] devoted Catholic people and yet the
[46:22] church you know it just couldn't do
[46:24] anything for them. uh they were just
[46:26] loyal people to the to that faith and uh
[46:31] brother Ernie uh experiencing the
[46:34] reality that he's had and the joy that
[46:36] he's had and you've all witnessed that
[46:39] he just somehow has been so desirous to
[46:42] convey that to them. But when they saw
[46:45] him, they said, "Well, you know, you
[46:46] were into this and you were into that."
[46:48] And well, anyone who's searching is into
[46:50] this and into that usually. And so he
[46:53] passed from one thing to another. And
[46:55] they said, "Well, you know, you were in
[46:56] the ptl club and then you're in the UPC
[46:59] and now you're in this." And so, uh, but
[47:03] when he went this time and and and and
[47:07] this you have to remember his mother's
[47:09] beyond the critical stage now. She's out
[47:11] and she's, you know, when a person has
[47:14] come to their crisis and come out of it,
[47:16] often they don't feel a need of God.
[47:19] See, so she passed that point, but he
[47:22] asked the family and those that were
[47:24] there if they would just leave. He
[47:26] wanted to be alone with his mother. And
[47:29] uh so he went with a special mission and
[47:32] he asked her, he said, "Mom, I would
[47:35] like to know if you would like to
[47:38] receive the Lord Jesus Christ and be
[47:41] saved." And she said, there wasn't even
[47:44] an instant of hesitation. She just said
[47:46] yes. And he said, "We had a most
[47:49] wonderful time of prayer." He said, "She
[47:52] cried. I cried.
[47:54] And I I I want the congregation to
[47:56] rejoice over that, too. That's that's a
[47:59] big a big load on brother Ernie's heart
[48:02] that has been lifted because he's been
[48:04] desiring this for years and now here it
[48:06] it had happened. So we we thank the Lord
[48:09] for that.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful
[48:12] &gt;&gt; if you were in that place? So the Bible
[48:14] says we rejoice with them that rejoice.
[48:16] Amen. And we rejoice over that.
[48:20] Uh, we want to be I'd like you to also
[48:24] if you would do something for me. My
[48:26] wife has been burdened for years for her
[48:29] brother. Bob Harper is his name. And uh,
[48:34] my wife and Linda went up and actually
[48:38] stayed in his home. His wife now is in a
[48:40] senior citizen's home. So, he's living
[48:43] alone. He got the flu. He wasn't well.
[48:45] He was not eating. And uh yet he's got a
[48:49] very very alert mind and he's actually
[48:52] quite physically fit. So they spent
[48:55] several days and just stayed right in
[48:57] his home there with him. Uh cooked and
[49:00] he oh he just like came back to life.
[49:03] But she's uh burdened. My wife is
[49:05] burdened and has been for years for his
[49:08] soul. And of all the family, he's the
[49:11] only one that hasn't been baptized. And
[49:14] she just holding fast to God. She wants
[49:17] to see him re receive Christ as his
[49:19] savior. They had some open doors. He was
[49:21] very open, very uh free to speak. Uh but
[49:25] it takes more than that. It takes a
[49:28] divine touch from almighty God. It takes
[49:30] the breath of God. It takes the light to
[49:33] strike the seed. And that's what we're
[49:34] praying for now. And if you would just
[49:36] take that upon your heart and pray with
[49:39] us for him. His name is Bob Harper.
[49:44] Well, God bless you. I wonder if we
[49:47] could just stand and perhaps we could
[49:48] just sing that chorus once again. Yeah.
[49:51] I'll bless his name.
[49:54] I bless your name.
[49:57] [Music]
[50:00] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[50:03] [Music]
[50:10] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[50:12] [Music]
[50:20] I
[50:27] bless your name.
[50:32] I bless your name.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer once again. Our
[50:41] lovely Lord Jesus,
[50:44] it is in your name that we come. We have
[50:46] gathered in your name and you have said
[50:49] in your word that all that we do we
[50:51] should do in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:53] Christ. We stand here with breath in our
[50:57] bodies father prepared and so desirous
[51:00] to bless your name to give you not only
[51:03] lip service but to give you service oh
[51:06] God with every energy that you give us.
[51:10] And now here Lord today I pray that you
[51:13] will cause each one to be their thoughts
[51:17] to be captivated by the Holy Spirit and
[51:20] may their thoughts be focused on eternal
[51:23] things. Help us not to be distracted
[51:26] Lord but help us to be just focused on
[51:28] what is your will Lord? What is your
[51:30] pleasure in this service? What would you
[51:32] have me to do Lord Jesus? And I'm here
[51:35] to do that. I pray, Father, that the
[51:37] Holy Spirit will have total preeminence
[51:40] and have control of every person as we
[51:43] as I stand here at the post of duty. I
[51:45] pray that you will cause my lips to
[51:47] utter the words that you'd have spoken,
[51:49] oh God. And may the minds of the people
[51:52] in their hearts comprehend, oh God, what
[51:55] the spirit speaketh to the church. I
[51:57] pray. We thank you for the message that
[51:59] you've sent. Thank you for the messenger
[52:01] that you've sent, Lord. Thank you, oh
[52:03] God. We have received a message that was
[52:05] without compromise. And I pray, oh God,
[52:08] that the truth will sink into our hearts
[52:10] and bear forth much fruit. In Jesus
[52:13] name, we wait upon your anointing now,
[52:16] oh God, for your glory. Amen.
[52:21] If you'd like to follow in your Bible
[52:22] and turn with me, please to Psalms uh
[52:25] 139,
[52:27] chapter 139, and we're going to read
[52:30] verses 14-1 17.
[52:35] scripture that's not
[52:38] unfamiliar to most of you
[52:48] 14-1 17
[52:52] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[52:55] and wonderfully made marvelous are thy
[52:58] works and that my soul knoweth right
[53:02] Well, my substance was not hid from thee
[53:06] when I was made in secret, and curiously
[53:09] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[53:11] earth. Thine eyes did see my substance,
[53:16] yet being unperfect, and in thy book all
[53:20] my members were written, which in
[53:22] continuence were fashioned, when as yet
[53:25] there was none of them. How precious
[53:28] also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God.
[53:33] How great is the sum of them. Isn't that
[53:36] wonderful? I'd like the whole
[53:38] congregation to join me on that last
[53:41] verse. Let's read it together. How
[53:44] precious also are thy thoughts unto me,
[53:48] oh God, how great is the sum of them.
[53:52] And the people said, "Amen." God bless
[53:54] you. You may have your seats.
[54:05] I want to
[54:07] take a fourth service, a fourth part of
[54:10] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[54:13] bride
[54:15] and I'm that calls for such a such a
[54:18] broad subject. So, I I felt inspired the
[54:22] other night and I I want to just read
[54:25] what I just wrote down as I felt
[54:29] directed in just a moment. But I want to
[54:33] go back to how God uh put us together.
[54:38] How God in his creation when he created
[54:41] the first man and his wife, Adam and
[54:44] Eve, and that they were, if you have
[54:47] your thoughts now, he he structured them
[54:49] a certain way. He put them together in a
[54:53] certain fashion so that they would be
[54:58] redeemable.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[55:02] and uh and we are put together in a
[55:06] body. We're bi biological creatures.
[55:10] We also have a spirit realm, an
[55:13] emotional realm, and we have a soul.
[55:17] So now you you just hold that because
[55:20] that's that needs to kind of overlay uh
[55:23] everything that I have to say today. And
[55:25] I have a lot of comments and a lot of
[55:28] scriptures and a lot of quotes. So you
[55:30] can keep your Bible handy if you would.
[55:32] Now, here's the notes just because this
[55:35] will give you a very, very clear
[55:37] overview where we're going. God in
[55:41] making his son and his wife
[55:44] made or formed them put them together so
[55:49] that redemption could take place.
[55:53] The woman, I would like you to notice
[55:55] this. the woman
[55:58] only only the woman could bring the
[56:01] fall.
[56:03] Yet Adam was responsible. Thus the
[56:05] scripture says by one man sin came into
[56:10] the world.
[56:12] But only a woman also the Virgin Mary
[56:17] could be used to bring forth the Savior.
[56:25] All the types and the shadows of the Old
[56:28] Testament
[56:30] were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In other
[56:33] words, all the events in the Old
[56:37] Testament and the individuals spoke of
[56:41] pointed to him
[56:44] to Jesus Christ. They lived a small
[56:47] segment of his life. They were a cell of
[56:53] his body if I can put it in that
[56:55] language.
[56:56] His physical body came into being
[57:00] because the channel to the soul.
[57:03] Remember now I said they were
[57:04] constructed in such a way. They had to
[57:07] be given by God the creator a channel to
[57:10] the soul.
[57:12] So they his physical body that's the
[57:15] physical body of Jesus Christ came into
[57:18] being because the channel to the soul of
[57:22] a young virgin girl was open to the
[57:26] promised word and there was a
[57:29] performance of those things.
[57:33] When God made us or put us together,
[57:37] he made a body with senses to contact or
[57:42] physical.
[57:43] Number two, he made a spirit realm to
[57:48] experience life's happenings with a
[57:51] greater intensity
[57:53] compounding
[57:55] even the body senses. For example, we
[57:58] see
[58:01] which is a physical sense but also now
[58:05] we remember and that is in the spirit
[58:08] realm because our memory is one of the
[58:11] channels of the spirit. So we see
[58:13] something but now we remember it and we
[58:15] can recall it in our memory in our in
[58:19] our uh spirit realm and we may uh touch
[58:26] uh we may touch someone uh one of our
[58:29] loved ones. Parents touch their
[58:31] children. Husband and wife can touch
[58:35] hands and together and we experience
[58:39] affection
[58:40] and the affection compounds the touch.
[58:45] Are you following me?
[58:47] But the one channel to the soul is
[58:52] either unbelief or faith. That's the
[58:55] only thing that can be in that one
[58:57] channel.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; But God made it for faith.
[59:03] Faith cometh by hearing
[59:06] &gt;&gt; which is a sense of this physical body
[59:09] and hearing by the word of God. So
[59:12] someone now is energized and preaches
[59:16] being uh guided by the Holy Spirit and
[59:19] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[59:22] the word of God. And thus God sends his
[59:26] voice in its season. In every season,
[59:31] God has sent his voice. He sent his
[59:33] messengers. He sent his prophets. And he
[59:35] sent his prophet in this generation. He
[59:38] sends his prophet with his words in that
[59:41] prophet's mouth to speak words fitted
[59:44] for the channel to the soul.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those individuals in a certain
[59:52] season that have been birthed in a
[59:55] biological birth, a natural physical
[59:58] birth which came along through the a
[1:00:02] sexual relationship, a husband and wife
[1:00:05] and a child comes and we have a physical
[1:00:09] being a uh uh but then we are structured
[1:00:13] and put together so uniquely made As
[1:00:18] David had said, his his substance was
[1:00:21] not hid and he was fearfully and
[1:00:24] wonderfully made. And so God didn't just
[1:00:27] give us these physical senses and these
[1:00:30] other emotional senses or we call it the
[1:00:32] realm of the spirit, but he gave us also
[1:00:35] that one channel to the soul which has
[1:00:38] been fitted and designed to receive the
[1:00:40] word. That's why God gave us that
[1:00:42] channel to receive the word.
[1:00:46] And then the soul is converted
[1:00:50] and the converted soul then takes
[1:00:53] control of the realm of the spirit
[1:00:57] and then that it begins to control the
[1:01:01] memory and the imagination and the
[1:01:03] conscience and the reasoning and the
[1:01:05] affection begins to control it. A
[1:01:07] converted soul begins to control it. If
[1:01:10] the soul if that channel is filled only
[1:01:13] with unbelief then the word cannot come.
[1:01:16] The soul cannot be re be converted or
[1:01:19] born again. There's no birth takes
[1:01:21] place. And then uh the the senses of the
[1:01:25] uh the senses of the physical and the
[1:01:27] senses of this of the spirit are just go
[1:01:30] rampant.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; They're just under the control of the
[1:01:34] domain of this world, this present evil
[1:01:36] age.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; And then you see the world that we're
[1:01:39] living in.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; That's why it is the way that it is. But
[1:01:42] the spirit realm then comes into into
[1:01:45] subjection to a converted soul and the
[1:01:48] spirit realm then controls the physical
[1:01:50] realm and it throws the whole body
[1:01:53] subject to the word.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; If unbelief is in the channel, it throws
[1:01:57] the whole being out of cater and into
[1:02:00] sinful attributes. And that's why a
[1:02:03] prophet says all these things, all these
[1:02:07] attributes, all these things that people
[1:02:09] do, that's not the sin. The sin was
[1:02:12] there was unbelief in that channel.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; That was the sin.
[1:02:18] Well, now we can stand and go home. I
[1:02:21] finished my message,
[1:02:25] but now I'd like to Would you like to
[1:02:27] kind of see where we're going from here?
[1:02:30] That gave you a I'm sure a good clear
[1:02:33] picture. The Bible says this of of uh
[1:02:39] Joseph and Mary. But while he thought on
[1:02:42] these things, behold, the angel of the
[1:02:45] Lord appeared to him in a dream. That's
[1:02:48] to Joseph, saying, Joseph, thou son of
[1:02:51] David, fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:02:54] thy wife. I want you to notice this next
[1:02:56] phrase, please. For that which is
[1:03:00] conceived in her
[1:03:03] is of the Holy Ghost. She perhaps was
[1:03:07] not even aware but that which is
[1:03:10] conceived in her in her is of the Holy
[1:03:13] Ghost.
[1:03:15] uh in the
[1:03:18] in the uh altar book for uh April 16th,
[1:03:24] April 18th, I'm sorry.
[1:03:27] Brother Brandham says you are filled
[1:03:29] with something.
[1:03:31] You might be filled with doubt.
[1:03:34] Your poor heart poor hearts may be
[1:03:36] running over with doubt. He said, "I
[1:03:38] hope not." Your hearts may be full of
[1:03:40] frets and worry.
[1:03:42] And it might be that your hearts are
[1:03:44] full of trouble. He says when he closed
[1:03:47] this, he said, "You can't remain empty.
[1:03:50] You're full of something."
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And the world is full of things.
[1:03:54] Everybody's heart is full of things.
[1:03:57] This is a this is an age of
[1:04:00] self-discovery.
[1:04:01] People are trying to discover
[1:04:03] themselves. I'm trying to find myself.
[1:04:06] Is Is that true? True.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You know, this isn't coming as any
[1:04:10] surprise to you. And the reason for that
[1:04:13] is is because we've fallen from
[1:04:15] something.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; You're missing something. And the reason
[1:04:18] for that also secondly is that there is
[1:04:21] more. There's something within us that
[1:04:23] tells us there's more. There's more for
[1:04:26] you. There's more spiritually. There's
[1:04:30] the multitudes of people that don't
[1:04:32] profess anything spiritually, but they
[1:04:34] just know that they can attain more. The
[1:04:36] athlete knows he can do better. They can
[1:04:39] just attain something. they can achieve
[1:04:41] something higher. The intellectual wants
[1:04:44] to do more. The businessman wants to he
[1:04:46] knows he can do better. He can do more.
[1:04:49] Everybody, you know, they they have
[1:04:50] goals. And that's what goals are all
[1:04:52] about because goals are something that
[1:04:54] you haven't attained to yet. And we're
[1:04:56] going to get into that just a wee bit.
[1:04:58] But in this uh in this age of
[1:05:01] self-discovery, I thought I would just
[1:05:02] find what what some people have said
[1:05:04] about it. And one person has said, "It
[1:05:07] is only when we it is only when we
[1:05:11] silent the blaring sounds of our daily
[1:05:14] existence that we can finally hear the
[1:05:17] whispers of truth
[1:05:19] that life reveals to us as it stands
[1:05:23] knocking on the doorsteps of our
[1:05:25] hearts." In other words, we're seeking
[1:05:27] for something, but it's right close to
[1:05:29] us. Someone else has said, and this was
[1:05:31] Mark Twain, he said, 'I can teach
[1:05:33] anybody how to get what they want out of
[1:05:35] life. The problem is that I can't find
[1:05:39] anybody who can tell me what they want.
[1:05:41] And that's also very, very true. And
[1:05:44] someone else has said, and I thought
[1:05:46] this is really good. He said, God,
[1:05:50] why do I storm heaven for answers that
[1:05:52] are already in my heart?
[1:05:55] Every grace I need has already been
[1:05:57] given me. Oh, lead me to the beyond
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; within.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Lead me to the beyond that's within.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; If we could realize the prophet saying
[1:06:14] once the bride realizes who she is,
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; what's hindering us?
[1:06:21] If we could realize who we are
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; and what is within us, I can tell you it
[1:06:28] would be a formidable body of people.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen, but it's true
[1:06:35] anyway. I'll say amen to it.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; It is a super church.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It can only be a super church if she has
[1:06:42] a super possession. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And so that which is conceived in her,
[1:06:47] I've been pondering this now for some
[1:06:49] weeks and I've been thinking about what
[1:06:52] it is that's within this bride, the body
[1:06:56] of Jesus Christ. What is it that we
[1:06:59] possess? Because I believe we possess so
[1:07:02] much more than uh than we perhaps
[1:07:06] realize.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to be clear on one thing.
[1:07:11] Although God made us so that we could be
[1:07:15] uh he didn't only make us to be
[1:07:18] redeemable
[1:07:20] but he made us also that we could
[1:07:22] participate in redemption
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; as Mary participated in redemption. Now
[1:07:29] we cannot participate and this is what I
[1:07:31] want to be clear. We cannot participate
[1:07:34] and do not participate in the price of
[1:07:37] redemption. Jesus paid it all. You can
[1:07:40] add nothing to the price of your
[1:07:42] redemption.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's Christ and him alone.
[1:07:46] Christ plus nothing.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Christ plus no uh no nothing that we can
[1:07:54] add ourselves. But we do have a part.
[1:07:58] The scripture says, "Neither by the
[1:08:00] blood of goats or ca and calves, but by
[1:08:03] his own blood he entered in once into
[1:08:07] the holy place, having obtained eternal
[1:08:10] redemption for us
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and that's it."
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; As they say in French, to me, that's the
[1:08:16] end.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Do it for me.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; I know it's right, but I like to ask the
[1:08:23] experts.
[1:08:29] However,
[1:08:31] although Christ paid it all, then the
[1:08:34] Bible says also, "Go ye and preach the
[1:08:36] gospel." Why? Because in preaching the
[1:08:39] gospel, somebody's going to hear the
[1:08:41] good news, and they're going to give
[1:08:43] their life to Christ, and they're going
[1:08:44] to enter into redemption because we have
[1:08:46] a part. You may not ever preach a
[1:08:49] message. You may never stand behind a
[1:08:50] pulpit, but you have an integral part in
[1:08:53] the plan of redemption as God has called
[1:08:55] you to be an expression of Jesus Christ
[1:08:58] in this world. So, he didn't only make
[1:09:00] you to be redeemable, but he made you so
[1:09:02] that you could be a participant in the
[1:09:04] plan of redemption.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "He hath made of
[1:09:12] one blood all nations of men for to
[1:09:16] dwell on the face of the earth." He made
[1:09:19] He made all men of one blood. We're here
[1:09:22] of many many races here. We may be
[1:09:25] different uh colors and all the rest of
[1:09:27] it, but biologically we're made of one
[1:09:29] blood.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; We can give each other a blood
[1:09:32] transfusion, be just fine.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; We are all humans. Brother Brandham says
[1:09:38] we're all human beings. We all came from
[1:09:41] God. God by one blood made all nations.
[1:09:44] So biologically speaking, as far as
[1:09:46] humanity is concerned, we're all the
[1:09:49] same. Uh at that biologically, we're
[1:09:52] essentially the same. However,
[1:09:55] in nature and in character, we're very
[1:09:58] different.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; You find one, you know, real boisterous
[1:10:03] and brother Brandon says blusterous. And
[1:10:05] then you find the next one and he's
[1:10:06] dogmatic. Then you find the next one,
[1:10:08] he's really quiet. You find one who's a
[1:10:11] extrovert, the next one's an introvert.
[1:10:13] So within that spirit realm, we we we're
[1:10:16] very different.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And we might say, well, it came on down,
[1:10:21] you know, to our families or whatever
[1:10:24] more, however it was put together. That
[1:10:26] may be fine. But God also knew that's
[1:10:28] exactly how you were going to come. And
[1:10:31] he never intended that a person who's an
[1:10:33] introvert or a person who's an extrovert
[1:10:35] or a person who's dogmatic or a person
[1:10:37] who's blisterous or next who's so
[1:10:39] withdrawn, he never intended that that
[1:10:42] character or nature should hinder our
[1:10:44] spiritual walk with God.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he made you in a
[1:10:51] variety.
[1:10:53] Some men are real blusterous and some
[1:10:55] are real dogmatic and others are fine
[1:10:57] and others are kind. And you just find
[1:11:00] all different kinds of people in the
[1:11:02] kingdom.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You find some people they're they're
[1:11:05] poppers because they can't they can't
[1:11:07] save anything. They just give it
[1:11:12] some people and some people just spend
[1:11:14] it on themselves.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And next person they can
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Well, you want to hear it?
[1:11:22] I heard it a long time ago. They can
[1:11:25] squeeze a penny till the American Eagle
[1:11:27] looks like a sand hill crane.
[1:11:34] Just can't get anything out of them.
[1:11:38] Well, we'll leave that where it is.
[1:11:43] Brother Bram says in the questions and
[1:11:45] answers on the seals, he said Jesus came
[1:11:47] to be a witness as a savior to the
[1:11:50] world. And the great scholars that
[1:11:53] should have known him said, "This man is
[1:11:55] Bub." He said, "We'll not have this man
[1:11:59] to rule over us and so forth. We'll not
[1:12:02] do it." But a little prostitute
[1:12:05] with a life in her,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; something in her that they didn't have
[1:12:12] in them. And God did that from the
[1:12:14] foundation of the world. He structured
[1:12:16] her and put her together that way.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So she had something in her
[1:12:22] predestinated to eternal life and her
[1:12:26] name is immortally in the word of God
[1:12:28] here.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And he said she walked up there and the
[1:12:35] first time the light struck that little
[1:12:38] seed quickly she knew it.
[1:12:40] Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; In the message the mighty God unveiled,
[1:12:45] he says, "Now God might have had to
[1:12:47] interbreed this and that to get a
[1:12:50] certain ting of the bell
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; like the moulder." But he said, "But
[1:12:56] when Jesus turned and said, speaking to
[1:12:59] her, I am he that speaks with you,"
[1:13:03] there was no such an expression as
[1:13:05] bleub. Right?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; See, so now they had great intellectual
[1:13:09] men, theologians, students of the word
[1:13:12] of God, but they had something different
[1:13:14] in them.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; It was in them.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a It didn't just come
[1:13:19] right that moment. They had something
[1:13:20] actually in them.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; One place it says they were filled with
[1:13:24] envy.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; They were filled with, you know, they
[1:13:27] were filled with anger. They were filled
[1:13:29] with it. It was in them.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; They had that. But she had something
[1:13:33] else in her. And when he said, "I am he
[1:13:36] that speaks to thee." He said, "She left
[1:13:38] her water pot, ran into the city, and
[1:13:40] said, Come and see a man who told me all
[1:13:42] things that I have done. Isn't this the
[1:13:45] very Messiah?" He said, "Now, what did
[1:13:47] this?" That's the question. What did
[1:13:50] this? What caused that to happen?
[1:13:55] I just thought I would bring this home.
[1:13:56] Why are you here?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; What did this? What brought you to this
[1:14:00] service? What kind of hunger? We had
[1:14:03] prayer in the in the uh uh in minister
[1:14:06] study and and in prayer I just felt you
[1:14:08] know the people have come here. I I I I
[1:14:11] just I almost get uh I I get a little
[1:14:14] bit fearful. I see the cars lined up on
[1:14:16] both sides of the street in the parking
[1:14:18] lot packed and I said, "Oh God, the
[1:14:21] people have come here hungry and the
[1:14:22] people have come here with anticipation
[1:14:24] and expectation. I pray no man can
[1:14:27] satisfy that. Only God. because you have
[1:14:29] something in you. Craving for something
[1:14:31] far beyond words or something that's put
[1:14:34] together or something intellectual. It's
[1:14:37] way beyond that. Only God can satisfy
[1:14:39] that thirst.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "What what did this
[1:14:44] of putting the old putting the old
[1:14:47] scripture with the experience?" Notice
[1:14:49] how he worded that so perfect. Putting
[1:14:52] the Old Testament and the old scripture
[1:14:54] with the experience, uniting them
[1:14:56] together at that moment. Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He said that Jesus was giving to her. He
[1:15:02] said what did it? It made the Messiah.
[1:15:06] That's what that's how come she could
[1:15:08] come to that conclusion cuz she was
[1:15:10] putting he was putting all the
[1:15:12] scriptures and the things and and the
[1:15:14] experience together. And he said quickly
[1:15:17] notice now please. And he says, "What?"
[1:15:20] And did you notice quickly her sins were
[1:15:23] forgiven because at the beginning she
[1:15:27] was redeemable.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; God made her redeemable.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Life's experience was a misery. Her
[1:15:35] emotional life, her biological life, her
[1:15:38] physical being was a disaster.
[1:15:42] Her emotional life was a total upheaval.
[1:15:45] But because she recognized the scripture
[1:15:48] that had come with the event, that was
[1:15:51] the Messiah to her.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; That was the Messiah. And on that
[1:15:57] recognition, she was forgiven.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Because she was redeemable. God gave her
[1:16:02] that capacity at the beginning. And we
[1:16:05] cannot ask him why did you do it? Why
[1:16:08] didn't you do it to the priest? Why did
[1:16:09] you do it to her? That's God's business.
[1:16:12] That's God's choosing. Do you believe
[1:16:14] it?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Quickly her sins were forgiven because
[1:16:19] she was redeemable. Because she was in
[1:16:21] God's thinking at the beginning. So it
[1:16:24] so it redeemed her or brought her back
[1:16:27] when when she seen the expressed
[1:16:30] scripture manifested of Jehovah,
[1:16:35] what he was,
[1:16:37] what he is.
[1:16:41] Very early this morning, in the wee
[1:16:43] hours of the morning actually, I was
[1:16:44] listening to God identified by his own
[1:16:47] characteristics.
[1:16:50] And I tell you friends, this message is
[1:16:53] so perfect.
[1:16:55] You know, the world is going to have to
[1:16:57] give an answer that they've got
[1:16:59] libraries and they've got books and
[1:17:01] they've got all this stuff and all this
[1:17:02] trash that they just read and gobble up
[1:17:04] and all these movies and all these
[1:17:06] industries and all these DVDs and all of
[1:17:08] this nonsense and they just gobble up.
[1:17:11] Don't tell me they haven't got time. and
[1:17:12] they got all kinds of time and playing
[1:17:14] around and fooling around on computers
[1:17:16] and seeing this and listening to that
[1:17:18] music and all the rest of it. And God
[1:17:20] sits here
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; with hundreds and hundreds of hours
[1:17:25] of his voice.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; They called 25 people. He just called,
[1:17:32] he says, "Okay, let's just start at
[1:17:33] let's just start at 75 and bring them up
[1:17:36] to a hundred and just have them come up
[1:17:38] here." And the first man that came
[1:17:40] there,
[1:17:43] uh, he just said to the man something on
[1:17:46] this order. He said, "Well, you're
[1:17:48] you're seriously sick. You're you're
[1:17:51] you're in serious condition."
[1:17:54] And he said, "Are we strangers?" I I
[1:17:58] just try to comprehend that. Here we
[1:18:00] are. We're strangers.
[1:18:03] And I asked myself, you know, why is God
[1:18:05] doing this? No human can do it. Why is
[1:18:07] God doing it?
[1:18:10] And he said to the man, "You got you
[1:18:12] have prostate cancer
[1:18:15] and they've operated, but they couldn't
[1:18:17] get it and it's gone through your whole
[1:18:20] body."
[1:18:22] He said,
[1:18:24] "And that's all he said to him. He just
[1:18:26] said, "Is is that the truth?" He said,
[1:18:29] 'Well, the God something like the God I
[1:18:32] serve, the God that is present here,
[1:18:35] that devil could hide from the surgeon's
[1:18:38] knife, but he can't hide from God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; When I hear something like that, I just
[1:18:44] say, God
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; only speaking the truth.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And if you can do that for the physical,
[1:18:51] biological body of an individual, what
[1:18:54] can you do for a man's soul? What can
[1:18:56] you do for his character? We may be here
[1:18:58] and I don't think I don't think we
[1:19:00] should make any excuse for our
[1:19:02] character.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We been born this way where we maybe we
[1:19:05] are a certain way but I know a God can
[1:19:08] change that.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; I know a God who's greater than the
[1:19:12] genes that came down from your father
[1:19:14] and your mother than the chromosones or
[1:19:17] whatever more. I know a God that's
[1:19:19] greater than that.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] I think every person experiences
[1:19:29] uh some of the awe that I sense in
[1:19:32] David's words when he said that he was
[1:19:35] curiously
[1:19:38] and wonderfully made, fearfully and
[1:19:40] wonderfully made. And that his substance
[1:19:43] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:19:46] secret.
[1:19:48] and you did see my substance yet
[1:19:50] imperfect
[1:19:52] and in thy book all my members were
[1:19:54] written which are which which in
[1:19:57] continuence were fashioned when as yet
[1:20:00] there was none of them. It it seems that
[1:20:03] David is gripped with a
[1:20:07] almost an awe as to his
[1:20:10] uh physical being. And it is we can't we
[1:20:14] can't we just dedicated a baby.
[1:20:17] You know, there's doctors say you can
[1:20:20] see pictures of them being formed. I
[1:20:24] It's just too It's just too absolutely
[1:20:27] too astounding for me. I've seen the the
[1:20:30] the the secret of life or the mystery of
[1:20:33] life. Some, you know, documentary that
[1:20:35] was put together. It was just how how
[1:20:39] two individuals just a man and a woman
[1:20:42] in in in the union that God allowed and
[1:20:46] can bring forth that kind of a life with
[1:20:48] all the circulation system and all of
[1:20:51] that to me that is just too wonderful.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And if God did that just so we can live
[1:20:57] here for a few years,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; what about the soul?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; What about how he's put us together? How
[1:21:04] did he how did he put us together? And
[1:21:06] we need to give the attention. We give a
[1:21:08] lot of attention to the body. We need to
[1:21:10] give attention to our soul.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God. And it's not just because
[1:21:15] it's because it's something we maybe
[1:21:17] can't really define. It doesn't mean
[1:21:19] that it's some kind of nebulous thing
[1:21:20] down in there. And you know, uh, God
[1:21:23] actually constructed that. How glorious
[1:21:25] it is. I thank God. I'm so glad you gave
[1:21:28] a channel to my soul.
[1:21:31] So glad I had an opportunity to hear
[1:21:33] something with my ear and have my spirit
[1:21:36] realm, have my spirit touched and the
[1:21:38] thirst that is within my soul desire
[1:21:41] that
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; and that desire has never left.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; It never has to leave.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; You even had it when you're in the
[1:21:49] world,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; didn't you not?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You're searching for something,
[1:21:53] searching for reality, searching for
[1:21:55] truth, searching for purity. you'll
[1:21:58] never find it in the world.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So, we've been uh structured in such a
[1:22:06] way. I think I could say honestly that
[1:22:08] our bodies is a marvel of supernatural
[1:22:13] ingenuity.
[1:22:16] We can never fully comprehend this handy
[1:22:19] work of God.
[1:22:21] The Bible speaks of this that as I
[1:22:25] referred to a few moments ago that we
[1:22:27] are uh we have things that we could
[1:22:30] attain to. And the Bible says this. I'm
[1:22:32] going to give you some scriptures
[1:22:33] quickly. And hath raised us up together
[1:22:37] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:22:39] places in Christ Jesus. Brother Brandham
[1:22:42] refers to that many times. The apostle
[1:22:44] Paul has written that to the Ephesians
[1:22:46] which is our inheritance book. You know,
[1:22:48] it speaks of heavenly places in Christ
[1:22:51] Jesus. It it's not talking about the
[1:22:54] the, you know, living in the dregs or
[1:22:56] living in despondency. It's talking
[1:22:58] about an elevated place.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And so, naturally, we have a we have a
[1:23:04] desire and a hunger for those things
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; because it's there for us. You may not
[1:23:09] be soaring in heavenly places, but be it
[1:23:11] known to you, if you are a born again
[1:23:15] son or daughter of God, God has given
[1:23:17] you the capacity. It's not out there
[1:23:20] someplace. And you don't have to go
[1:23:21] searching for, you know, your your uh
[1:23:25] your inner being. You don't have to
[1:23:27] search elsewhere. It's within you.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; The capacity is there within you.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is say, "God, take a
[1:23:35] hold of this that you put in me. You've
[1:23:37] already put me together this way. I've
[1:23:39] been ordained for this. I've been
[1:23:41] designed for this. You had this in your
[1:23:44] mind from the beginning. Why do we want
[1:23:46] to miss it?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul.
[1:23:53] And in spite of this depths of the
[1:23:55] spiritual understanding that the Apostle
[1:23:58] Paul had in his life, yet we have him
[1:24:01] saying this thing. Brethren, I count not
[1:24:04] myself to have apprehended,
[1:24:07] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[1:24:09] those things which are behind, and
[1:24:11] reaching forth for those things that are
[1:24:14] before. So, he's saying, I haven't got
[1:24:16] it all. I haven't attained it all. And I
[1:24:19] think we could all, you know, raise our
[1:24:21] hands and say, that's me. I haven't
[1:24:23] attained it all. I I'm well aware of
[1:24:25] that.
[1:24:27] Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I don't count myself to apprehended. But
[1:24:31] the one thing that Apostle Paul did, I
[1:24:33] trust that you are doing reaching
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; forth
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; to those things which are before. Not
[1:24:40] just reaching forth, you know, in kind
[1:24:44] of lost and, you know, groping in some
[1:24:47] foggy area. Not that. No. And not just
[1:24:50] going along in our Christian life kind
[1:24:52] of a, you know, if it comes fine. If it
[1:24:54] doesn't come, well, fine. No, it's not
[1:24:56] that. his focus. There's something
[1:24:58] before me. I've been apprehended and the
[1:25:01] God that apprehended me has a purpose
[1:25:03] and I'm reaching forth to that purpose.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he desired to do more.
[1:25:12] In one one of his last services,
[1:25:17] he told about going beyond the curtain
[1:25:19] of time. And we hear that all the time.
[1:25:22] But he said
[1:25:27] prior to that experience, he woke up
[1:25:30] early sitting in bed. I was with him. He
[1:25:32] described it. He said he put his hands
[1:25:34] behind his head like that, leaned
[1:25:35] against the headboard.
[1:25:38] He said, "Well, Bill Brham, you're 52
[1:25:42] years old. If you're going to do
[1:25:44] something for God, you better get
[1:25:45] going."
[1:25:48] and he had that craving
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; to do more.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You know, that's hard for me to
[1:25:53] understand.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; But here's a man, you know, stand before
[1:25:57] hundreds of thousands of people and see
[1:26:00] what he saw and witness what he
[1:26:01] witnessed and the miracles and all the
[1:26:03] rest of it. It's just incredible. And
[1:26:06] yet he has that within him. So what am I
[1:26:10] saying? I'm saying it's a principle of
[1:26:12] spiritual life that there's something
[1:26:14] before us and we and and we need to feel
[1:26:18] not only that there's something before
[1:26:19] us but that we're reaching for it and
[1:26:21] and it's it's attainable.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible says of us, I'm going rather
[1:26:30] slowly, but I want to really really
[1:26:32] establish this. The Bible says of us
[1:26:35] that we grown to be clothed upon
[1:26:40] of our body. We've grown to be clothed
[1:26:42] upon. Here it is. For we know that the
[1:26:44] whole creation groanth and travaleth in
[1:26:47] pain together until now. And not only
[1:26:51] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[1:26:55] first fruits of the spirit,
[1:26:57] even we ourselves grown within
[1:27:00] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[1:27:04] whip the redemption of our body because
[1:27:06] redemption's process isn't completed
[1:27:08] yet. There's a redemption of our body.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And so, we grown.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; We desire. I know that you do.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I know that you have it. We all desire.
[1:27:20] We we we're just made that way. That's
[1:27:22] the way we're made. Emotionally, we're
[1:27:24] made that way. Physically, I trust that
[1:27:26] we're made that way. Then the Bible says
[1:27:29] also Paul in 2 Corinthians, for we know
[1:27:33] that if our earthly house of this
[1:27:35] tabernacle, we're dissolved, we have a
[1:27:38] building of God and house not made with
[1:27:41] hands, eternal in the heavens. For in
[1:27:43] this, for in this we grown earnestly,
[1:27:48] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:27:51] house which is from heaven. But do you
[1:27:53] know that the most of people within this
[1:27:55] whole area and where you live, they
[1:27:57] don't even give that a second thought.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That sounds like, you know, hookie
[1:28:01] spooks to them.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Another body eternal in the heavens, a
[1:28:04] theophony. you start talking about a
[1:28:06] theophony that's right beside you and
[1:28:08] all all that's language you fully
[1:28:10] understand and and we're consumed with
[1:28:13] the change of this body. We're consumed
[1:28:15] with the resurrection. We're consumed
[1:28:18] with the the a millennium and and being
[1:28:22] able to enter into a another realm,
[1:28:24] another dimension. That's all language
[1:28:26] that's it's foreign language to people.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. I ask you, why do you have it?
[1:28:33] Why do you have that in you?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And if it is a reality in you, where did
[1:28:38] it come from?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Have you just been brainwashed?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Is it just No. You know, this is the one
[1:28:48] thing that the world doesn't understand
[1:28:50] because they many many people look upon
[1:28:52] the message, especially within the
[1:28:53] religious world, they look upon the
[1:28:55] message as some kind of, you know, uh uh
[1:28:57] brainwashing process. No, I'll I'll put
[1:29:00] it to you this way that when you heard
[1:29:03] the gospel of truth, when you heard this
[1:29:06] message, there was already something
[1:29:08] here that matched with it.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; It just came together.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And the thing was the message didn't
[1:29:15] come first.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; What was inside came first.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; What was inside was before the
[1:29:21] foundation of the world. What came first
[1:29:24] in John's gospel the 4th chapter? It
[1:29:27] wasn't it wasn't Jesus coming to the
[1:29:29] well.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; He came to the well because it was
[1:29:32] already in the woman.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was already in her.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you heard the message, the
[1:29:42] message came but you already had it in
[1:29:44] you. And that's why the message made
[1:29:47] sense to you.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Even though your life may have been
[1:29:51] completely contrary.
[1:29:53] and their conditions and your
[1:29:54] environment and your situation was
[1:29:57] totally contrary. And maybe when you
[1:29:59] first heard it, you said, you know, how
[1:30:00] can I believe that? How can I, you know,
[1:30:02] I'm so involved. I'm so tied to this
[1:30:06] religion or this church or this colony
[1:30:08] or this whatever.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; How can I ever how can I break away of
[1:30:13] this? But in your heart, in your soul,
[1:30:16] and you didn't even you couldn't even
[1:30:18] put it together. You weren't trying to
[1:30:19] figure out how am I structured. All you
[1:30:21] do is my soul, something inside,
[1:30:25] it's already there is saying, "Yay,
[1:30:28] amen. This is truth.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; This is what I've been waiting for."
[1:30:36] It doesn't matter if it's a derelch on
[1:30:38] the street, the prostitute on the
[1:30:40] street, or the most eloquent minister of
[1:30:43] the uh of some church or religion, or
[1:30:46] anything in between that
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; that entire distance, there's some that
[1:30:52] have been structured in such a way,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; they already possess it. Yeah.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And I can say that in them, they're full
[1:31:01] of desire.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; They're full. They crave. They yearn.
[1:31:06] They groan. They already have it.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And then comes the good news of the
[1:31:10] gospel of Jesus Christ in its season.
[1:31:13] They say, "That's for me."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; That's why one person can obtain it. I
[1:31:20] think of the two young men that were in
[1:31:22] the army in Singapore. And I met to one
[1:31:25] of them and he just, you know, he had no
[1:31:28] ambition, no desire for God. He's not
[1:31:30] thinking about God. And the other fellow
[1:31:32] is being witnessed to by a believer. And
[1:31:34] they're going to show uh uh deep calls
[1:31:38] to the deep. And so this believer was he
[1:31:42] just onto his buddy, this friend of his
[1:31:44] saying, "I want you to come and see this
[1:31:45] film. I want you to come and see it." He
[1:31:48] doesn't want to go alone. He's afraid
[1:31:50] that they're going to zero in on him and
[1:31:52] button hole him. and he's afraid of
[1:31:54] that. So he goes to another buddy says,
[1:31:57] you know, uh, they're pressing me to
[1:32:00] come and see this film. Would you come
[1:32:02] and just keep me company? Yeah, sure.
[1:32:04] Fine. I'll go with you. So he goes and
[1:32:05] he's the one that gets it.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; He just he said, "Hey, this is it. Is
[1:32:11] it?" And he's the believer that I talked
[1:32:13] to. He said, "That's how I came. I
[1:32:16] wasn't looking for it. He was looking
[1:32:18] for me."
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:32:24] So we had the groaning long before we
[1:32:27] even heard of it in the message the
[1:32:29] breach.
[1:32:31] He said now now we say this. We say sin.
[1:32:36] He said we just call it sin. Break it
[1:32:38] down. What is sin? A lot of people say
[1:32:40] drinking, committing adultery. No. No.
[1:32:43] He said that's the attributes of sin. He
[1:32:46] said that's what sin causes. But real
[1:32:48] sin is unbelief. And I really need to
[1:32:51] zero. You've heard that many, many
[1:32:52] times. But in the context of the service
[1:32:54] this morning, real sin is unbelief. He
[1:32:57] said, "And if you're a believer, you
[1:32:59] don't do those things. But no matter how
[1:33:02] holy you try to make yourself or how
[1:33:04] religious you try to be, if you do those
[1:33:07] things, you're an unbeliever."
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, "Now, something lost,
[1:33:14] something that's lost, and it's
[1:33:16] groaning. It's trying to get back. The
[1:33:19] reason why we grown, a lot of people
[1:33:22] don't groan. They're not expecting
[1:33:23] anything. I've had people, you know, my
[1:33:26] time's up. I'm happy to go. And they're
[1:33:28] not thinking, they don't even spend that
[1:33:30] much time thinking about that they may
[1:33:32] face God,
[1:33:34] that there's something on the other
[1:33:35] side, that they're just going to take a
[1:33:38] step. They have no consciousness of that
[1:33:39] at all. There's no groaning. They're not
[1:33:42] anticipating anything. And a lot of
[1:33:45] people, a lot multitudes, untold
[1:33:47] millions just totally deluded believe
[1:33:49] yet, you know, because a preacher is
[1:33:51] going to come and speak a nice funeral
[1:33:53] service that somehow that'll just put
[1:33:55] them in heaven. Not a chance.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He said something's groaning and it's
[1:34:01] trying to get back
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; to be back to its original condition.
[1:34:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Remember one time here, Brother Tom
[1:34:11] preached and he really dwelt on this
[1:34:13] subject. They're not in their ought to
[1:34:16] be condition.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And that's why they grown. That's why
[1:34:20] you yearn. And no matter where you were,
[1:34:22] you had that because you were not in
[1:34:24] your ought to be condition. Now when God
[1:34:27] made man, body with senses to contact
[1:34:30] the world we live in, a spirit with
[1:34:33] senses that amplify
[1:34:35] the things of the body. Now I I just I'd
[1:34:40] like to dwell on that a wee bit. We have
[1:34:42] our our our our physical. We see and we
[1:34:46] hear and we smell
[1:34:50] and we uh what good would it be, you
[1:34:53] know, if we just could see something?
[1:34:56] But we we see something and uh those of
[1:35:00] you that are married, one day you saw
[1:35:03] the young lady or the young lady saw the
[1:35:05] young man and and you saw
[1:35:08] someone and it set up something inside
[1:35:13] in the realm of the affections.
[1:35:15] Then brother Brandham talks about, you
[1:35:17] know, felio love
[1:35:19] and ag.
[1:35:21] And that filio love,
[1:35:24] you know, that would maybe make one man
[1:35:28] kill another man or injure him because
[1:35:31] of something that he was doing to his
[1:35:33] family or his wife or whatever more. But
[1:35:36] a goppel love would cause him to pray
[1:35:38] for his soul.
[1:35:40] Totally different.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Depends what's in a person. And we all
[1:35:44] have felia love. We all have that. And I
[1:35:47] trust we all have ag.
[1:35:53] So when God made man, he assembled him
[1:35:56] in such a way so he could contact the
[1:35:59] physical creation but also gave him a
[1:36:02] channel to contact God.
[1:36:07] So now I I just want to talk about the
[1:36:09] touch.
[1:36:10] Now,
[1:36:15] and I I I I haven't got time to read all
[1:36:17] of these things, but it was in a quote,
[1:36:19] the unpardonable sin. And brother
[1:36:21] Brandham describes in the Old Testament
[1:36:24] how a man would bring his lamb for a sin
[1:36:27] offering
[1:36:29] and then he would put his hand on the
[1:36:32] head and you can read it. Put his hand
[1:36:34] on the head of the lamb. Now, so his
[1:36:37] physical biological body is feeling that
[1:36:40] head of that lamb under him.
[1:36:44] Then and then the priest maybe takes a
[1:36:46] sharp rock or whatever more and begins
[1:36:48] to cut that juggler and he hears it, you
[1:36:52] know, be bleeding and bleeding
[1:36:56] and he and he sees and he feels under
[1:36:59] his hand. So, he's got his sight and
[1:37:02] he's got his hearing and he's got his
[1:37:04] feeling and he sees the blood spattering
[1:37:07] out of that animal and he feels it
[1:37:09] quivering under his hand and he knows
[1:37:11] that should be me.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; And it's registering into his into his
[1:37:17] spirit realm.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Not just physically, but into his spirit
[1:37:21] realm. He feels it. He sees it. He may
[1:37:24] smell the animal life.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; And he knows it's dying for me. Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And it had to be a certain kind of a
[1:37:32] lamb. Maybe something he raised and
[1:37:34] something that was close to him. And now
[1:37:36] he's being separated from it because of
[1:37:38] his because of his sin. And he
[1:37:40] experiences all of that by his touch and
[1:37:43] by his sight and by his feeling.
[1:37:47] But there was no salvation.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He went out the same sinner he was when
[1:37:54] he came in.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Because in the Old
[1:37:59] Testament
[1:38:01] that channel
[1:38:03] that channel
[1:38:05] was not made perfect under the law. So
[1:38:08] they could do all kinds of activity
[1:38:12] but it didn't change
[1:38:14] the blood of bulls and goats could not
[1:38:18] change that soul realm.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "But once a man put his hands,"
[1:38:29] He said, "but once a man put his hands."
[1:38:31] He says, "Oh my, a man put his hands on
[1:38:35] the head of Jesus Christ." Yeah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Now here today,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; not this hand,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; not the feeling of this body, but God
[1:38:46] has given you the ability to lace place
[1:38:50] your hand by faith on the head of Jesus
[1:38:53] Christ. Say, "Well, I can't see it and I
[1:38:55] can't feel it." That's not the point.
[1:38:58] That's that's what the prophet has said.
[1:39:00] Can you say, "Amen."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Don't be distracted. There's quite a bit
[1:39:06] of movement. I'd like as little movement
[1:39:07] as possible, please.
[1:39:10] In living and dying, buried and rising,
[1:39:13] said in the Old Testament, they brought
[1:39:15] a lamb.
[1:39:18] Oh, listen. No, I'm sorry. I wanted to
[1:39:19] read the rest of this. He puts his hands
[1:39:22] on the head of Jesus Christ and confess
[1:39:25] his sin, feeling the pains and the agony
[1:39:28] of Calvary. He said, uh, he said what he
[1:39:32] had to pay to redeem a man from sin. And
[1:39:35] the Holy Spirit out of the blood of
[1:39:38] Jesus Christ comes cleansing the man.
[1:39:40] It's not within your touch. It's not
[1:39:43] within your hearing or your sight. But
[1:39:45] it is your faith. And God has given the
[1:39:49] channel to the soul. Faith,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; the ability to have faith and to confess
[1:39:55] with the mouth. You don't have to feel
[1:39:57] it, but you need to confess with your
[1:39:59] mouth. I believe that.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I believe what the scripture has said.
[1:40:02] If I confess with my mouth and believe
[1:40:05] in my heart on the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[1:40:07] shall be saved.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; And it's not just for salvation,
[1:40:10] friends, because we need that channel
[1:40:12] open all the time.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get into some deeper
[1:40:16] things. I want you to really hang on
[1:40:18] here. Just please.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; He said he and the Holy Spirit out of
[1:40:23] the blood of Jesus Christ comes
[1:40:25] cleansing the man. He goes out a new
[1:40:28] creature
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; and it's once for all.
[1:40:32] What a powerful thing.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; What a powerful thing. A man is changed.
[1:40:37] He doesn't feel anything. He doesn't
[1:40:39] become emotionally involved. It it it's
[1:40:42] his his memory. I mean, I deal with
[1:40:45] people sometimes and their memory is so
[1:40:47] clogged with all the things and the
[1:40:52] negative things that have happened and
[1:40:54] the disappointments that have happened
[1:40:56] and life and all the we call it baggage.
[1:40:59] The the Bible hasn't got a term for
[1:41:01] that. It's not calling it baggage, but
[1:41:04] it's the things Paul says, we're
[1:41:06] forgetting those things. Why? Getting
[1:41:08] rid of those things which are behind and
[1:41:11] reaching out to the things which are
[1:41:12] ahead. What things? Not to just better
[1:41:15] times or a raise or or or you know, a
[1:41:19] more secure future. That's not it. He's
[1:41:21] reaching out for the spiritual things.
[1:41:23] Reaching out what faith can lay hold of.
[1:41:26] Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; If I if I was sitting in this service
[1:41:31] today and didn't know that I was
[1:41:32] redeemed, I'd say, "Oh God,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; just give me the inner sight today and
[1:41:38] give me the inner fortitude to reach out
[1:41:40] my hand by faith and lay it on the head
[1:41:43] of Jesus Christ." I'd close my eyes and
[1:41:46] I would see my hand going onto the head
[1:41:49] of Jesus Christ. I'd want to feel that
[1:41:51] quivering body paying for my sin. I'd
[1:41:54] want the blood to to to to be sprinkled
[1:41:57] over me. And I'd see my soul being
[1:42:00] washed. And I would see the stripes on
[1:42:02] his back if I were a sick person and lay
[1:42:05] my head upon him. And I'd say, "Jesus,
[1:42:08] paid it all.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I hear the voice, not in these ears, but
[1:42:13] in my soul, I hear the voice crying out,
[1:42:16] "It is finished.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; It is finished."
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:23] You have inner inner
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; inner facility, inner capacity
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; to hear that.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; If I was here today and my soul was kind
[1:42:34] of dry and I haven't I haven't had uh
[1:42:37] what I would call a insight and a
[1:42:39] revelation. I didn't have stimulation.
[1:42:42] I'd say, "God, you had a messenger come
[1:42:45] and deliver a message and said I could
[1:42:48] be stimulated by revelation.
[1:42:52] And I lay my hand upon that word. I lay
[1:42:55] my hand upon that Christ. And I claim
[1:42:57] that for myself.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't intend to go out
[1:43:02] these doors until I have that kind of
[1:43:04] stimulation.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; This will be a different kind of a
[1:43:07] service.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; It belongs to me.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Do you want to continue in the doldrums?
[1:43:13] Do you want to continue in a negative
[1:43:15] position? Do you want to stay there? Or
[1:43:16] do you want to say no?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] G
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; maybe life has not dealt you
[1:43:26] life has not dealt anybody an easy a
[1:43:28] easy easy way.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He says now by faith lay your hands on
[1:43:35] the head of Jesus Christ and feel that
[1:43:37] suffering that forsaking until blood and
[1:43:41] water separated. feel the suffering and
[1:43:43] say, "Lord God, upon the basis of this,
[1:43:47] I now come as a sinner, be merciful to
[1:43:50] me."
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's saying that
[1:43:53] because that works.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody here needs to say that.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I command you in the name of Jesus
[1:44:00] Christ to say it and walk out of this
[1:44:02] place a different person. I feel that
[1:44:05] suffering. I feel that quivering. I hear
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; him saying and calling out and crying
[1:44:12] out. I hear it all. I mean, I by faith,
[1:44:15] I'm reaching back. Isn't it just a Isn't
[1:44:17] it amazing? You can reach back in an
[1:44:19] instant. 2,000 years. There is no time
[1:44:22] with God. There is no time with God.
[1:44:25] It's the same as Calvar's right now.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Christ died before the foundation of the
[1:44:31] world and he paid for your sin right
[1:44:34] now. He paid for your healing right now.
[1:44:36] And I prayed before this service, lo
[1:44:38] God, I want to see the supernatural take
[1:44:40] place at the preaching of the word
[1:44:43] because I believe I'm coming to a place
[1:44:45] of people that are that have a they have
[1:44:48] a channel, one channel that God gave
[1:44:51] them when he structured them before the
[1:44:53] foundation of the world. These people
[1:44:55] have that channel. Help me, oh God, to
[1:44:58] be give them the utterance so that word
[1:45:00] will reach that channel.
[1:45:03] And if you got that channel full of all
[1:45:05] the all the doctors and all the
[1:45:08] everything that the doctor has said, you
[1:45:10] got to get it out.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You got to say this is what the word of
[1:45:13] God says.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; If you got that channel stuffed full of
[1:45:17] all the all the hurts that you've had
[1:45:19] and all the reverses you've had and all
[1:45:21] the disappointments you've had and all
[1:45:23] the things that you've suffered, you got
[1:45:24] to blow it out.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; There's no way the Holy Spirit's trying
[1:45:28] to poke the word down there.
[1:45:34] The prophet said that flu, that flu of
[1:45:37] that memory needs to be blown clear.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; You might have to say, "Somebody wronged
[1:45:42] me." But I forgive them.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; I forgive them. I blow that thing clear,
[1:45:46] oh God, by the Holy Spirit. And now I
[1:45:49] believe your word.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I believe what's being preached.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; I believe you intend me to leave this
[1:45:55] place a different man, a different
[1:45:57] woman.
[1:46:01] Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't saying that to
[1:46:05] get people excited. He was saying that
[1:46:08] because it's truth.
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says I'm I'm on just on
[1:46:16] the touch yet. And the Bible says, "Now
[1:46:19] when the sun was setting, and all that
[1:46:22] had any sick with diverse diseases
[1:46:26] brought them unto him,
[1:46:29] and he laid his hands on them,
[1:46:35] every one of them,
[1:46:37] and healed them." Yes.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Now, it would be wonderful
[1:46:44] if today
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not even a I'm not even to be
[1:46:49] regarded as a poor substitute. I I'm
[1:46:52] poorer than that.
[1:46:56] But they brought their sick and their
[1:46:57] afflicted. They brought their babies and
[1:46:59] their young ones.
[1:47:02] And he laid his hands on them
[1:47:05] and he touched them.
[1:47:08] and healed everyone.
[1:47:11] How beautiful.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And that is Jesus Christ yesterday and
[1:47:16] that's Jesus Christ today.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And the capacity. You have the capacity.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not just pumping you up. I'm telling
[1:47:26] you, you have the capacity. God gave you
[1:47:29] the capacity to reach out and touch him.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; The woman, she reached through. She she
[1:47:35] she made her way through the legs of
[1:47:38] whatever of the people and got through
[1:47:39] so she could touch the hem of his
[1:47:42] garment.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And what did he say? Who touched me?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; And you still have that capacity. You
[1:47:51] have that today. You can touch him and
[1:47:53] receive what you need to receive from
[1:47:55] him.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; He'll be moved.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Not just talking about physical things,
[1:48:01] talking about spiritual things.
[1:48:04] Oh God,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; sometime I hear people with their
[1:48:07] problems and the things and and then I
[1:48:09] ask them, "What have you been listening
[1:48:10] to during the services? What have you
[1:48:12] been hearing?" I hear the cry and the
[1:48:15] call of the Holy Spirit calling you
[1:48:17] people to a higher life in Christ.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and be satisfied with
[1:48:22] crumbs when God is handing you a seven
[1:48:25] course meal.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How rich this message is.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; How rich it is.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; The Apostle John said, "That which was
[1:48:39] from the beginning, which we have heard,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; which we have seen,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; and which we have looked upon and our
[1:48:49] hands have handled of the word of life."
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Many people touched him, got nothing.
[1:48:56] Multitudes heard him, never got a thing.
[1:48:59] Many people were a touch and many people
[1:49:01] received something from him but didn't
[1:49:04] get eternal life.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Mark's gospel said, "And as they did
[1:49:09] eat, they tasted."
[1:49:13] Jesus did took the bread and blessed it
[1:49:15] and break it and gave it to them and
[1:49:17] said, "Take, eat.
[1:49:20] This is my body."
[1:49:24] How many today
[1:49:27] are taking of the body of Christ
[1:49:31] or are told they are
[1:49:34] but they don't get anything. The prophet
[1:49:37] says also
[1:49:39] so when he breathed into this man
[1:49:43] he said I don't know how he made him but
[1:49:45] he put him in five senses so he could
[1:49:47] contact his earthly home and see and
[1:49:51] taste and feel and smell and hear and he
[1:49:53] made him in that manner. Now, those
[1:49:56] senses were not made to contact God.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And the five senses of the spirit,
[1:50:06] for those of you that I've said this
[1:50:08] many times, and for especially those of
[1:50:10] you that are new and maybe those that
[1:50:13] are young, I remember them easily by uh
[1:50:16] more easily by association. So, I just
[1:50:20] have it my car.
[1:50:23] My car. M I C A R memory,
[1:50:27] imagination,
[1:50:29] conscience, affection, and reasoning.
[1:50:33] My car
[1:50:36] hasn't gotten me very far, but
[1:50:42] that car won't get you very far either.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Depends what's in your memory and what's
[1:50:47] in your imagination
[1:50:50] and what's in your reasoning and what's
[1:50:51] in your affection.
[1:50:54] depends on what's in that. Now,
[1:50:57] okay, we're really coming home now.
[1:50:59] We've heard I've heard services. I've
[1:51:00] heard brother John. I've heard brother
[1:51:02] Lance. I've been listening very close.
[1:51:04] Brother Tom listen these various
[1:51:06] brothers ministering. And there's much
[1:51:09] said about the emotions and emotions.
[1:51:12] Well, I'm trying to break that down now.
[1:51:14] It's not just the emotions that that is
[1:51:16] that realm, but God God gave it to you
[1:51:19] when he structured you.
[1:51:23] I I hope you it it's terrible to be
[1:51:25] around somebody that completely loses
[1:51:26] their memory.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people just recently
[1:51:31] whose loved ones have dementia.
[1:51:34] My granddaughter
[1:51:36] Sharon works with people with that all
[1:51:39] the time. A very sad situation out where
[1:51:43] my mother-in-law was a man. I believe he
[1:51:46] had been a doctor and he was just in his
[1:51:48] 50s
[1:51:50] and he completely lost it.
[1:51:53] Big, strong, healthy man, more like
[1:51:57] brother DJ.
[1:51:59] Walk up and down the aisles
[1:52:02] of that senior citizen's home. He wasn't
[1:52:04] a senior citizen. strong as an ox
[1:52:08] and just back and forth pace back and
[1:52:10] forth
[1:52:12] and
[1:52:14] completely out of touch with the world.
[1:52:18] His mind was completely gone. Nobody
[1:52:21] even knew what happened, what tipped him
[1:52:23] over the edge.
[1:52:28] God gave you a mind. God gave you a
[1:52:30] memory.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; God gave you a place for affection.
[1:52:36] God gave you a place to consider and
[1:52:40] weigh things out.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; But if we allow Satan to get in there
[1:52:46] and use them,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; and as believers, I'm sad to say, but it
[1:52:51] happens on a regular basis. We let Satan
[1:52:54] get in there and start to torment us.
[1:52:59] And so constantly,
[1:53:02] not constantly, but as a as a result, we
[1:53:07] get filled. And I'm talking to this
[1:53:08] congregation. I don't have to go any
[1:53:10] place. We get filled with fear.
[1:53:15] We get filled with questions.
[1:53:19] We get filled with anxiety.
[1:53:24] We get filled with
[1:53:28] bitterness
[1:53:31] and begins to consume us.
[1:53:35] We get filled with maybe envy
[1:53:39] and we see the world being blessed or we
[1:53:41] see someone else being blessed and we do
[1:53:44] a comparison with us and them and then
[1:53:48] we we get filled with disappointment.
[1:53:53] We just get filled with a whole array of
[1:53:55] things and it begins to consume our
[1:53:58] whole spirit realm.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; And then it begins to control our
[1:54:05] physical realm.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; We have trouble maybe being a real
[1:54:13] brother or a sister to somebody because
[1:54:15] we're holding a hurt. we're holding some
[1:54:18] misunderstanding
[1:54:20] and we just can't give them that kind of
[1:54:22] handshake that should be. And so it it
[1:54:24] begins to restrict and hinder brotherly
[1:54:27] love.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; We get filled with those things.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; We can get filled with anger and it's
[1:54:40] just below just below the surface.
[1:54:45] And you know, you don't even have to be
[1:54:47] angry at anybody, but it's just an anger
[1:54:49] that's there. You know, it's it's uh I
[1:54:52] think I get that way sometimes. Just,
[1:54:55] you know, you become irritable.
[1:54:58] Of course, you people don't do that, but
[1:55:02] it does happen.
[1:55:04] We get irritable because things aren't
[1:55:07] going right. and our whole emotional
[1:55:10] thing. And if you think that you're
[1:55:12] going to get through life without these
[1:55:14] kind of I'm not talking about just
[1:55:16] superficial things. I'm talking about
[1:55:18] things that are so deep
[1:55:21] that you can't even talk openly to your
[1:55:25] loved one about it. It's just real real
[1:55:28] deep.
[1:55:31] Maybe you have questions and the
[1:55:33] questions are so deep you'd say, "Oh,
[1:55:37] I'd never ask brother Ed about that. I'd
[1:55:41] just be I'd be horrified to have him
[1:55:44] even think I have that kind of a
[1:55:46] question."
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I'd never ask my wife that. I would
[1:55:53] never want her to even think I'd never
[1:55:54] want her to even know that that's
[1:55:56] passing through my mind that I have that
[1:55:58] kind of a question.
[1:56:00] Why am I getting down where we actually
[1:56:03] live? Why am I getting there? Is because
[1:56:07] if we allow those things to occupy those
[1:56:10] channels of the spirit, it's a
[1:56:12] playground for the devil.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And it only goes from there downhill.
[1:56:19] Then you find yourself, your joy is
[1:56:21] gone, your victory is gone, and you're
[1:56:24] just down and you're depressed
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; and discouraged. More than discouraged,
[1:56:30] you're just down, depressed, and you
[1:56:31] just wonder what's life all about? Is it
[1:56:34] worth living?
[1:56:36] Well,
[1:56:39] can I take a few more minutes? Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; That is those channels
[1:56:47] of the spirit. And I'm so thankful for
[1:56:50] the message that really you want to
[1:56:52] read. If you want to know, go and get
[1:56:54] and read and listen to the deep the
[1:56:56] greatest battle ever fought.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; That's a message for the 21st century.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Imagination channel, the conscience
[1:57:07] channel. And the Bible says this, "And
[1:57:09] they which heard it, being convicted by
[1:57:12] their own conscience, went out one by
[1:57:15] one, beginning at the eldest, and that
[1:57:18] was when they brought the woman caught
[1:57:19] in the very act of adultery, and said,
[1:57:21] Moses said to stone her, what sayest
[1:57:23] thou?" And then when Jesus gave the
[1:57:25] answer, "He that's without sin, cast the
[1:57:27] first stone." The Bible says that they
[1:57:29] were convicted by their own conscience.
[1:57:32] They were convicted by their own
[1:57:35] conscience. Listen to me now. I'm not
[1:57:37] over.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And they went out.
[1:57:41] None of them born again.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; So they were convicted in their
[1:57:48] conscience but did not get eternal life.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Doesn't happen in that realm.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, I felt, oh, I felt so
[1:57:59] good." Doesn't mean a thing.
[1:58:02] If you see me just dead pan when people
[1:58:04] say that, "Oh, it just, oh, I just felt
[1:58:07] the spirit." Well, come and tell me
[1:58:10] about five years from now.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; I want to see what the spirit did for
[1:58:13] you in the next year.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; I want to see that stable walk.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I don't really feel much of
[1:58:21] anything,
[1:58:23] but here I am.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And here I stand. and I'm here this year
[1:58:28] and I'll be here next year and I'll be
[1:58:30] here the following year and I'll be here
[1:58:33] to the rapture and I'll greet you on the
[1:58:35] other side.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; That's when something struck the soul
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; and it's a reality.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; We've experienced it.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; How many have experienced it?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; This is a place to praise God.
[1:58:54] God made you that way.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; The reasoning and the Bible says, "And
[1:59:05] it came to pass that while they communed
[1:59:07] together, two believers,
[1:59:10] while they communed together and
[1:59:12] reasoned,
[1:59:13] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[1:59:15] them."
[1:59:17] They still didn't have any revelation.
[1:59:20] They just were communing and reasoning
[1:59:22] together about all the events. Oh,
[1:59:25] what's going to happen? Uh, you know,
[1:59:28] how's the body going to be changed? And
[1:59:30] and when's the big earthquake going to
[1:59:32] take place? And
[1:59:34] the Pope's visiting right now. I tell
[1:59:37] you what, I felt sorry for the state of
[1:59:40] New York
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; when he blessed ground zero.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That guarantees it always stayed ground
[1:59:46] zero.
[1:59:49] The Bible says that whatever he blesses
[1:59:51] is cursed.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I just pray, you know, it's it's it's
[1:59:55] sorry, but you know, they arrive at the
[1:59:57] airport and the first thing to do is
[1:59:58] come down and don't kiss that tarmac.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:00:14] I've never got a very great benefit out
[2:00:17] of that.
[2:00:21] Now
[2:00:23] I probably have to go to to a fifth
[2:00:26] portion because these are things that
[2:00:28] are very very deep on me and I have to
[2:00:31] describe them to you. Now brother
[2:00:32] Brandham has people uh uh untold
[2:00:35] thousands of people that have come
[2:00:37] before him and you can you can search it
[2:00:39] out yourself and he says this I'm trying
[2:00:42] to contact your spirit. I'm trying to
[2:00:45] contact your spirit. I never found once
[2:00:48] where he says, "I'm trying to contact
[2:00:49] your soul.
[2:00:52] I'm trying to contact your spirit."
[2:00:54] Because that was God's avenue to get to
[2:00:57] the soul.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; And so he'd have to startle them and
[2:01:01] say, "All right, you had an operation
[2:01:04] like he said to the man." He said to a
[2:01:06] woman, one of the third or fourth woman
[2:01:08] to come up. He said now
[2:01:11] you have a what's troubling you is you
[2:01:14] have a birthark.
[2:01:16] Try to put this one together. You have a
[2:01:18] birthark and you think it's turned
[2:01:21] cancerous. And the woman just goes a
[2:01:25] tell me he hit a cord
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; and he says all this is is to try to
[2:01:29] help you to
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; say it again.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Believe. try to help you to clear out
[2:01:36] the one channel
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; to get this worry out of the way to get
[2:01:39] this fretting out of the way. How many
[2:01:41] times it says you're so nervous? Oh,
[2:01:44] you're so nervous. Hundreds of times.
[2:01:46] Hundreds of times people are nervous
[2:01:48] because they're ftting. They're anxious.
[2:01:50] They're worried. They're concerned. They
[2:01:52] got doubts. They got questions. Got to
[2:01:54] get that out of the way so they can
[2:01:56] believe. And if I tell you something,
[2:01:58] then you can believe. the channel got
[2:02:00] clear and they believed and they could
[2:02:02] receive what they wanted from God.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, if that channel
[2:02:09] ever has to be clear, it's got to be
[2:02:10] clear for a group of people that expect
[2:02:13] the resurrection.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; It's got to be clear for people that
[2:02:17] expect the rapture.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; The rapture is not coming to the
[2:02:20] emotions. The rapture is not coming to
[2:02:22] the affection. It's not coming to the
[2:02:24] memory of the imagination or the
[2:02:26] reasoning. It's coming to the soul.
[2:02:29] the soul that's redeemed.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; And then when the soul is changed,
[2:02:42] that which has happened in the soul
[2:02:44] rises up and takes control.
[2:02:48] That's a control tower. Takes control
[2:02:51] of your affections.
[2:02:56] Affections can go haywire.
[2:03:00] Affections can go sideways.
[2:03:06] Takes control of the affections.
[2:03:10] You that are unmarried,
[2:03:13] you need the soul controlling your
[2:03:15] affections
[2:03:17] because you're very vulnerable
[2:03:20] to become attracted to someone who's not
[2:03:24] your husband or not your wife.
[2:03:27] And the one that God said, "Well, how
[2:03:29] can I be sure?" be dictated to by the
[2:03:32] soul.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; If you follow the affections,
[2:03:37] if you just follow the emotional realm.
[2:03:41] So here we are. And now we have the
[2:03:44] sight.
[2:03:46] Oh, it's fine looking young man.
[2:03:52] See the way he stands. You see the way
[2:03:54] his features. you see this or see her or
[2:03:56] see this or something. I just saw that.
[2:04:00] You know, I don't know, maybe I'm
[2:04:02] getting on dangerous ground, but what
[2:04:04] you have is the sight
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; that sets up the affections
[2:04:10] without anything registering from the
[2:04:12] soul yet.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Or I'll just take it another way.
[2:04:16] Someone say, "Well, the way he looked at
[2:04:18] me or the way they didn't shake my
[2:04:20] hand." I've had that.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; They didn't shake my hand.
[2:04:24] There's a brother here. I missed shaking
[2:04:26] his hand today as he walked by because I
[2:04:28] was I was going to and then I got
[2:04:30] engaged with brother Gary White
[2:04:33] and uh and I missed brother John
[2:04:36] wherever he is. I'm sorry I missed
[2:04:38] shaking your hand, Brother John. I meant
[2:04:41] to do that and I got taken up. But I've
[2:04:44] had people that have said, "Well, they
[2:04:45] didn't shake my hand or that sister
[2:04:47] didn't shake my hand." And right away
[2:04:50] the reasoning went.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; and even the way even the way they
[2:04:55] looked, it didn't look quite right.
[2:04:59] And I know that they don't feel good.
[2:05:02] And then Satan is right there and said,
[2:05:03] "Oh, what an opportunity."
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And your then the imagination goes in.
[2:05:09] Then a memory goes in. Yeah, that
[2:05:12] happened another time.
[2:05:16] and Satan's saying, "That's going just
[2:05:17] the direction I want it to go." And
[2:05:19] pretty soon that person's feeling a rooe
[2:05:21] of bitterness.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And they come to church and sit there
[2:05:25] and expect me to preach.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, Brother Larry?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. And I'm saying,
[2:05:34] "God, what's what's wrong? What's
[2:05:36] happened? I just like I got a stone wall
[2:05:38] here. What what's what's going on?" And
[2:05:40] he you got something over here and
[2:05:42] something over there and something over
[2:05:43] there. And Satan just having a he's just
[2:05:46] having a a field day
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; with all that spirit realm.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And God is doing everything he can
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; to get that soul channel clear
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; to bring them to believe the word.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; And once that channel is clear and the
[2:06:01] word comes and they say, "I disregard my
[2:06:04] feelings.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; I disregard my reasoning. I disregard my
[2:06:08] imagination. I disregard my memory. I
[2:06:10] disregard it all. And I believe what God
[2:06:12] is saying to me right now. I believe the
[2:06:15] preacher is to preach and is preaching
[2:06:17] for my benefit. I say, "Oh God, I
[2:06:20] receive it. I receive it."
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; And you'll find some rise from the soul.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful it is.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; One channel to the soul, a control
[2:06:35] channel.
[2:06:37] But there's only one channel to the
[2:06:40] inside of that soul,
[2:06:42] an end time seed sign. And it shows that
[2:06:45] you are a seed.
[2:06:48] Now, I'm going to just close, but I if I
[2:06:53] if God leads me to pick this up again,
[2:06:58] here's where I really want to come to.
[2:07:03] We've been made a certain way.
[2:07:06] And God has given a word. He has
[2:07:10] delivered a word. I think I've convinced
[2:07:12] you today. And not that I needed to, but
[2:07:15] I believe that to help you to understand
[2:07:18] and and feel what God must have been
[2:07:22] thinking. And I'd like to just dramatize
[2:07:24] for the last about four or five minutes
[2:07:26] here. and God putting you together and
[2:07:31] just assembling you
[2:07:34] for this day that we're in.
[2:07:37] I'm going to send these people
[2:07:40] a message and it won't be an easy one to
[2:07:42] receive.
[2:07:44] They will not be able to reason it in
[2:07:46] their mind. they will not be able to
[2:07:50] feel that emotional attachment perhaps
[2:07:54] because I feel lot I see lots of people
[2:07:56] that are emotionally attached to the
[2:07:57] message but as far as I'm concerned they
[2:07:59] haven't got a revelation of the message
[2:08:05] that is why friends and I'm beginning
[2:08:07] perhaps on dangerous ground but that is
[2:08:08] why
[2:08:12] I think it's nice to maybe go and see
[2:08:15] you know Sunset Mountain and see the
[2:08:18] Eagle Rock and see the various places.
[2:08:21] But when I get right to the scripture,
[2:08:24] I never find any in the Old Testament
[2:08:27] trying to find the burning bush.
[2:08:30] I never find anybody in the New
[2:08:33] Testament making a big thing over where
[2:08:36] Jesus was born
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; or where Jesus died
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; or trying to find exactly where the
[2:08:43] cross was erected
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't that kind of an
[2:08:47] attachment.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; I think it's fine to go there. I've gone
[2:08:52] into the tomb where they believe Jesus
[2:08:55] was. I've I've gone to where it it's
[2:08:57] believed that he laid, but that's not
[2:08:59] where my attachment is.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; I'm attached to what that Christ spoke.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; What he said.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; That's the attachment.
[2:09:13] So, we're not attached to just things
[2:09:16] that uh you know move us or
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; I saw uh you know we have uh maybe
[2:09:23] pictures
[2:09:24] and where the pillar of fire was here
[2:09:27] and it was actually photographed and I
[2:09:30] have I have such a reverence for that. I
[2:09:32] I carry it in my Bible. Maybe people
[2:09:35] wouldn't understand that. But I have a
[2:09:37] picture of Brother Brandham and it's
[2:09:38] well worn now with the pillar fire over
[2:09:42] his head because as far as I'm
[2:09:44] concerned, God Almighty visited Sam
[2:09:48] Houston Coliseum on that day and allowed
[2:09:51] that picture to be taken. That's a very
[2:09:53] very sacred thing to me. But that is not
[2:09:56] my attachment to this message or this
[2:09:58] messenger. My attachment is what he
[2:10:00] said. Amen. And
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; that's why I say to you young men
[2:10:04] especially, take that word, take those
[2:10:08] messages and just read it and digest it
[2:10:10] and ponder it and and and and try to
[2:10:14] just say, "Holy Spirit, what is it that
[2:10:16] you're saying?" Now, this is what I come
[2:10:18] to say.
[2:10:20] And I just pray God help me to say it.
[2:10:23] We're sitting here today
[2:10:25] and I don't know what the future is.
[2:10:30] I trust with everything that's in me, I
[2:10:31] would dearly, dearly love to be part of
[2:10:35] that change and part of that rapture.
[2:10:39] But I want to say to this congregation
[2:10:40] and those that are streaming because God
[2:10:43] bless you and you send me emails and
[2:10:46] it's so encouraging. You got one from
[2:10:48] Switzerland this last week and how
[2:10:50] lovely it was and I just appreciate it
[2:10:52] with all my heart.
[2:10:55] But God made you not only a certain way
[2:10:58] but he made you for a certain time
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; and he made you for a certain word.
[2:11:05] So he ordained the word and he designed
[2:11:07] the word for this generation. And and
[2:11:09] the prophet says the messenger the
[2:11:11] message the end time message who can say
[2:11:15] the last part of it meets the end time
[2:11:18] conditions. So now he's designed a
[2:11:21] message. He ordained it and he
[2:11:23] structured it and he and he brought up a
[2:11:25] messenger and brought him up through his
[2:11:27] terrible suffering and so on and and
[2:11:30] molded him and and crafted him until
[2:11:33] that message that he could carry that
[2:11:34] message. Then he carries the message
[2:11:36] over here. He's got people scattered all
[2:11:39] over the earth that are constructed a
[2:11:42] certain way and they've got a channel.
[2:11:45] You people have a channel and that
[2:11:47] channel was specifically given to you to
[2:11:51] receive the word for this hour, the
[2:11:54] promise of this hour so that you could
[2:11:56] believe that word and receive what that
[2:11:58] promise is. And that promise for this
[2:12:00] hour is the rapture. This is a rapture
[2:12:04] message. This is a rapture message. And
[2:12:06] that's why God gave you that channel.
[2:12:09] It's for this hour, for this moment. And
[2:12:12] that's what I want to conclude this
[2:12:14] service. That's why that channel was
[2:12:15] actually given to you.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; It's given to you for one purpose.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; And God in his mind says, "This channel,
[2:12:23] I'm giving it to these people to get
[2:12:25] them out of there.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; This channel that I'm giving these
[2:12:28] people is to defeat my arch enemy,
[2:12:31] death."
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:34] And that's why the spirit of God that
[2:12:36] raised Christ from the dead, if if it
[2:12:38] dwell in you,
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; it shall also quicken these mortal
[2:12:43] bodies,
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; that spirit that was given to you,
[2:12:46] that's been given to this congregation,
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; been given to this generation,
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; it was crafted by God. It was designed
[2:12:54] by God. It was ordained by God. It was
[2:12:57] predestinated by God. And thus he sent
[2:12:59] you here
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; with the facility and the capacity that
[2:13:02] you have.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; And I've done my best today
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; to bring it to you in in simplicity and
[2:13:08] to and and and and in such a way so that
[2:13:11] you can see it. Amen.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, it's
[2:13:16] time that we are no longer distressed
[2:13:19] and disturbed and live our lives
[2:13:21] according to this this superficial uh
[2:13:24] realm of this what this body experiences
[2:13:27] or what the spirit experiences. It is
[2:13:29] it's it's absolutely essential. It's
[2:13:32] vital that you live by the soul.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, how does that work?"
[2:13:39] Come and sit here and and and listen
[2:13:42] closely to what is preached and let it
[2:13:44] sink to the soul and set aside every
[2:13:47] feeling. Set aside every other thought.
[2:13:50] When you read the word, set aside every
[2:13:52] thought. When you hear a message, set
[2:13:54] aside every thought and say, "By this I
[2:13:57] live."
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By this I conduct my life.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; This shall be my instruction.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; This is the leadership of the Holy
[2:14:06] Spirit in my life.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:08] and you'll have great success.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, will you?
[2:14:27] I'd like to have the musicians so we can
[2:14:30] just
[2:14:33] sing a song or two of worship.
[2:14:37] I want to pray.
[2:14:40] Oh dear father,
[2:14:42] your word is so rich.
[2:14:45] Your word is eternal.
[2:14:47] Your word shall never pass away. Our
[2:14:50] words will pass away. Man's words will
[2:14:53] pass away, but your words will never
[2:14:54] pass away. How we thank you, oh God, for
[2:14:57] for the message of the hour and how it
[2:14:59] just it like it dissects and opens us up
[2:15:03] and helps us to see ourselves and helps
[2:15:05] us to see where we're at. Oh God, I just
[2:15:08] want to give you praise and
[2:15:10] thanksgiving, Lord, today that you've
[2:15:13] ever saw fit to call us
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; and to to bring us into this glorious
[2:15:18] light. Oh, it's a wonderful light. And
[2:15:21] we just want to give you thanks today,
[2:15:22] Lord. And while we uh will be going to
[2:15:25] our homes or going to uh get some
[2:15:29] refreshment, Father, and then come for
[2:15:31] the evening service, I'm just uh I'm in
[2:15:34] anticipation. What is it that you have
[2:15:36] to say to us as our brother Tom has been
[2:15:38] looking to you, Lord, over these number
[2:15:40] of days and perhaps a couple of weeks
[2:15:42] and just waiting to deliver the word
[2:15:45] that's on his heart. Oh God, I pray that
[2:15:48] the Holy Spirit will just move in. And I
[2:15:50] pray that you'll take the words that
[2:15:51] have been spoken today, Father, perhaps
[2:15:54] in utter simplicity, but let it let it
[2:15:56] just be indelibly marked upon the hearts
[2:15:59] of the people, oh God. I pray you'll
[2:16:02] bless them. Bless them that have come
[2:16:04] from so far, Lord Jesus. And we say, let
[2:16:07] your will be done. Just mold us and make
[2:16:10] us what you want us to be in the name of
[2:16:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. We'll walk in
[2:16:16] the light, the glorious light. Brother
[2:16:18] Ryan,
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:27] walk in the
[2:16:32] beauty
[2:16:34] of the light.
[2:16:37] from where the new cross
[2:16:41] of mercy
[2:16:43] are.
[2:16:45] Oh, shine all around us by day and by
[2:16:52] night.
[2:16:54] It's Jesus,
[2:16:57] the light of the world.
[2:17:03] We're walking
[2:17:05] in the light.
[2:17:08] It's the beauty
[2:17:10] of the light. Oh, come where the cross
[2:17:19] are.
[2:17:21] Oh, shine all around.
[2:17:26] My
[2:17:28] God,
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:31] Jesus,
[2:17:33] the light of the world.
[2:17:38] I might sing a verse or two of They come
[2:17:40] from the east and west. All right.
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:54] All right. They come from the east.
[2:18:01] They come from the land of
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] the Hey
[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:27] my
[2:18:29] father
[2:18:36] since Jesus has set me free.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm happy
[2:18:43] to be
[2:18:45] no longer
[2:18:47] [Applause]
[2:18:48] [Music]
[2:18:51] so
[2:18:54] [Music]
[2:19:06] I sus
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:13] the third verse the case of that holy
[2:19:17] place
[2:19:19] stand
[2:19:23] [Applause]
[2:19:25] to the Lord who g
[2:19:29] his love has prepared the way
[2:19:34] home in
[2:19:37] fair.
[2:19:39] His hand has served for all
[2:19:46] me.
[2:19:48] [Music]
[2:19:53] Oh Jesus has set me free.
[2:19:58] I'm happy as I can be.
[2:20:03] No longer I
[2:20:08] miss
[2:20:12] my soul.
[2:20:14] [Music]
[2:20:23] and shout the victory
[2:20:27] for Jesus.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; I believe if you can just take what the
[2:20:35] songwriter has said, seems like maybe
[2:20:37] you listen to part of the message.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; I no longer going to have this fret and
[2:20:42] this care.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:20:46] uh, I'm going to look into another realm
[2:20:48] just now. And what I envision is
[2:20:52] channels and flu
[2:20:55] just blew skyhigh
[2:20:58] and all kinds of doubts and fears went
[2:21:01] back where they belong
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; and questions and all of these
[2:21:06] reasonings and things. Hey, no. We live
[2:21:10] in a time and this is no surprise to
[2:21:12] you. People are tortured in their minds.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely tortured.
[2:21:20] Don't get quiet on me. I start feeling
[2:21:22] I'm alone. I we're we're we're in a time
[2:21:25] when people are tortured in their minds.
[2:21:27] And that belongs in Satan's kingdom. It
[2:21:30] has nothing to do with a believer.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Just blow them clear. Holy Spirit, come
[2:21:35] now. Blow them clear.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; And if you're in that state right now,
[2:21:40] you ought to just raise your hand. Say,
[2:21:41] "Oh God, I heard this word, but not in
[2:21:44] vain.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to let them be blown
[2:21:47] clear.
[2:21:48] I don't have it anymore. I don't want to
[2:21:50] go I do not want to go out of this
[2:21:52] church with that in my mind and in my
[2:21:55] heart. I'm going to let it just be blown
[2:21:56] clear.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, come
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm calling
[2:22:04] for it to be done in the name of Jesus
[2:22:06] Christ by the preaching of the word. Let
[2:22:08] the word that's been spoken today come
[2:22:10] right down into the channel of faith.
[2:22:15] So
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; if it finds doubt there, it's not going
[2:22:17] to come to its resting place.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; If it just finds faith,
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; you were made to believe God.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You were made for that. Even
[2:22:30] if you just say that, I was made to
[2:22:33] believe God's word.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; God structured me in his mind before the
[2:22:40] foundation of the world. I was actually
[2:22:42] made to believe
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; this word for this seasonal
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to miss a day of it.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want to miss a day
[2:22:50] of this glorious life
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[2:22:54] Oh wonderful Lord. I see you moving,
[2:22:57] Lord. I see the Holy Spirit moving. I'm
[2:23:00] sure that there's a milky bank, oh God,
[2:23:03] of faith that is building over the
[2:23:05] people now in the pillar of fire. Let it
[2:23:09] move from one to another. Oh God, I pray
[2:23:12] you'll just bring the people into a
[2:23:14] place where they're supercharged with
[2:23:17] faith in their heart to receive what
[2:23:19] they have need of in the name of Jesus
[2:23:22] Christ. Dismiss us, Lord, and just send
[2:23:25] us from this place with charged with
[2:23:27] victory.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. How faithful you
[2:23:33] are. How faithful you are
[2:23:36] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Well, we want
[2:23:40] to send you from this place with
[2:23:43] different than many came in. God bless
[2:23:45] you. We'll see you at evening service,
[2:23:48] Lord willing. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:23:51] name. Amen. God bless you, brother.
