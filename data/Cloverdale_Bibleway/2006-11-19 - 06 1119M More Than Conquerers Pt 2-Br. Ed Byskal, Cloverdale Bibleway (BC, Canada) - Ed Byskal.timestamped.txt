[31:36] Funk, brother, brother Eric, if you'd
[31:38] come and open the service in a word of
[31:40] prayer. It's a testimony this morning
[31:42] from our sister Sigret who says, uh,
[31:45] "Praise and glory be to our God for
[31:47] answering prayer. 16 months ago, we
[31:49] prayed for my sister Margot in Germany
[31:52] who had been diagnosed with can cancer.
[31:54] She felt our prayers and believed that
[31:56] God would heal her. After an operation,
[31:58] many treatments, she is back to work as
[31:59] a nurse."
[32:01] Um,
[32:03] a note from brother Mike and sister
[32:05] Debbie Gier. Sister Dorothy Snder is
[32:07] requesting prayer. She needs to undergo
[32:09] a colonoscopy. Both her and her uh
[32:12] husband, brother Don, are going to be
[32:14] streaming this morning's service. Wish
[32:16] to thank you for your support and
[32:17] prayers. So, we want to remember sister
[32:19] Dorothy this morning. Uh there's a note
[32:22] that we pray uh
[32:26] for I think this is yeah sister Sue uh
[32:29] says we pray for my daughter-in-law
[32:31] Claudia
[32:33] uh that the medical test would come out
[32:35] negative. We just want to praise the
[32:37] Lord for her good health. And also

[32:41] friend's wife was just diagnosed with
[32:44] cancer. They're streaming the service
[32:46] this morning and know we will be in
[32:49] prayer for her healing. How many know we
[32:51] have a God?
[32:52] &gt;&gt; He's touched by the feelings of our
[32:53] infirmities. We've seen him heal many
[32:56] times. We know he's able. Amen.

[33:04] prayer. Brother Eric, come.

[33:38] Lord God. The storms, the spiritual
[33:40] storms, Lord God, that are happening,
[33:42] Lord.
[33:43] Father, I just think of this wonderful
[33:45] place of refuge that we have here, Lord
[33:47] God.
[33:50] Father, where would we be, Lord God, if
[33:52] we didn't have this place to come to,
[33:54] Lord God, to just let off the pressure,
[33:55] Lord God? The pressure of the cares of
[33:57] this world, Lord God. The pressure of
[34:00] Satan's attacks on his people, Lord God.
[34:03] Father, we just thank you that we have a
[34:05] a maker, Lord God, that knows our every
[34:08] need, Lord. We just thank you that we

[34:36] brought an answer to, Lord God.
[34:39] Lord, we know that if we bring these
[34:41] needs to you, Lord Jesus, that you are a
[34:43] God of answered prayer, Lord Jesus.
[34:45] You're not a dead God. You're a living
[34:46] God that lives within us, Lord Jesus,
[34:49] here this morning, Lord God.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, these needs that are brought here
[34:53] now, Lord, these saints that have

[35:26] it is to have a pastor, Lord God, that
[35:28] desires to serve you, Lord God, and to

[35:32] him, Lord God, this morning that you

[45:51] day. Thank God for the nice weather.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; It's always nice weather.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; I've always been amused how every area
[46:01] blames another area for their weather.
[46:04] You go down south and they have the
[46:06] tornadoes and they said it comes up from
[46:08] Mexico.
[46:10] Then you get into the states. I've been
[46:12] there and being a listen to the news and
[46:15] they say an arctic blast from Canada.
[46:19] And then we in Canada say it's an Arctic
[46:21] blast from Alaska.
[46:23] And I think they blame it on Siberia.
[46:26] I'm not too sure, but somebody always
[46:28] gets blamed for the weather. And we call
[46:30] this a pineapple express. They say from
[46:33] Hawaii.
[46:35] I don't know. Anyway, we thank God for
[46:37] the day
[46:39] &gt;&gt; and that we're here with heavenly
[46:40] sunshine
[46:42] &gt;&gt; in our hearts. That's why we're here.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Nice to see you all
[46:47] here. And also, we want to be mindful
[46:50] while you are, you know, interacting
[46:53] with one another. There's a a big
[46:56] congregation that's not present visibly,
[47:00] but with us streaming live now on the
[47:02] internet. And last Sunday there was a
[47:06] 150 locations in 24 different nations
[47:10] around the world that joined in the
[47:13] service with you. And in the one week, I
[47:16] have never looked at the statistics
[47:18] because I didn't quite frankly didn't
[47:21] concern myself with it. But in the one
[47:24] week from last Sunday to last night,
[47:28] there was a 364
[47:31] locations that had streamed the archive
[47:34] because it's not suitable for them to
[47:37] hear it while the service is on. So they
[47:40] got it maybe because it would be the
[47:42] middle of the night so they get it in
[47:43] the morning. But I thought that's quite
[47:45] a congregation.
[47:47] 364 locations that streamed after in the
[47:51] archived and probably
[47:54] 150 or thereabouts with us today. So I
[47:57] want to say to all of them, God bless
[47:59] them from whatever country and wherever
[48:02] it is in the world, God bless you is our
[48:05] prayer. I'd like to just remind you
[48:08] quickly and we're going to turn to the
[48:09] scripture, but this Wednesday there'll
[48:12] be no service because the service is
[48:14] Friday. This coming weekend is the uh US
[48:18] Thanksgiving and we have such a uh such
[48:23] a portion and percentage of our
[48:25] congregation that are on the US side. We
[48:29] truly feel like a wonderful
[48:31] international family with over 30 uh 30
[48:37] different nationalities within the
[48:40] congregation and we are so happy for
[48:43] that. It makes it a very unique
[48:46] assembly. I think it gives it such a it
[48:50] blends us into uh what the bride of
[48:53] Jesus Christ is supposed to be like and
[48:56] uh such wonderful unity, such a
[48:58] wonderful spirit and there's just no
[49:00] feeling between one ethnic group to
[49:03] another. I just say that's wonderful.
[49:05] Hallelujah. It's just the way it should
[49:07] be. So this next weekend will be Friday
[49:11] evening with brother Tim Puit from uh
[49:14] from Louisiana
[49:16] be speaking. Brother Tim Puit is a a
[49:19] wonderful man of God been preaching
[49:20] since his teenage years has he's been
[49:24] given over to the Lord's work. He and
[49:26] his wife will be here. And then on
[49:29] Sunday we'll have 10:30 and 5:00 service
[49:34] next Sunday as well. And tonight,
[49:36] Brother Tom Ray is ministering. Brother
[49:38] Tom was just down in Texas with with
[49:41] Brother Aaron McGary's father, Brother
[49:43] David McGary, who's been pastoring in
[49:46] Fort Worth, Dallas area for many years.
[49:50] And I understand they had an outstanding
[49:52] time. And brother and sister Puit were
[49:54] actually over there to the meetings as
[49:56] well. And uh just a lot of the people
[49:59] from Louisiana and around. And so we
[50:02] might hear a little more of it tonight.
[50:04] I don't know. But brother Tom will have
[50:06] something on his heart for us tonight.
[50:08] We're going to go directly to the word.
[50:10] And if you'd like to turn in your
[50:11] Bibles, please
[50:14] second Corinthians
[50:17] the 7th chapter.
[50:19] We're going to begin reading.
[50:22] And then I will read also of Romans 8
[50:26] and35
[50:28] which was a portion of last Sunday's
[50:32] text and also I wish to read Revelations
[50:38] 6:es 1-4.
[50:43] Before we read, let's ask the author to
[50:48] be present and take control of my mouth
[50:51] and words and lips and take control of
[50:54] your mind and your entire our entire
[50:58] beings. Almighty God, you're the author
[51:02] of light and life. You have sent forth
[51:06] Jesus Christ which was the word in flesh
[51:10] into our lives and into this earth and
[51:15] you came to be a redeemer and you have
[51:18] succeeded in doing so. You are the
[51:21] victorious conquering Christ and today
[51:25] we have victory because of you. I pray
[51:28] you will anoint us with the Holy Spirit.
[51:31] anoint every man, woman, and child and
[51:34] all those that may be in various parts
[51:37] of the world. I pray your blessing upon
[51:40] them. I pray, oh God, your presence will
[51:43] be near and felt near every person. And
[51:46] now I pray, oh God, you'll take your
[51:48] word and give us understanding.
[51:52] Speak to our hearts and speak so deep,
[51:54] Lord, we can say that it has been good
[51:57] to be in the house of God. May we be
[52:00] strengthened, edified, and built up into
[52:03] this body of Jesus Christ. In the name
[52:06] of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 7 and verse 4.
[52:15] Great is my boldness of speech toward
[52:18] you. Great is my glorying of you. I am
[52:23] filled with comfort. I am exceeding
[52:25] joyful in all our tribulation.
[52:28] For when we were come into Macedonia,
[52:31] our flesh had no rest, but we were
[52:34] troubled on every side. Without were
[52:37] fightings, within were fears.
[52:41] Nevertheless, God that comfortth those
[52:44] that are cast down comforted us by the
[52:47] coming of Titus.
[52:51] Paul
[52:53] he made reference to without our
[52:57] fightings and within our fears.
[53:01] So he's experiencing as I uh mentioned
[53:05] last week
[53:08] that we are called to be conquerors more
[53:10] than conquerors
[53:12] and that which is external
[53:15] for my part that's conquering but if we
[53:18] conquer that and that which is inside
[53:21] the individual yourself we are our
[53:25] greatest o enemy. If we can conquer that
[53:28] as well, that's being more than a
[53:30] conqueror.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and:35, who shall separate us
[53:36] from the love of Christ? Shall
[53:38] tribulation or distress, you see, he's
[53:41] re making reference to these things
[53:43] again, or persecution or famine, or
[53:45] nakedness or peril or sword. As it is
[53:49] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[53:51] the day long. We are accounted as sheep
[53:54] for the slaughter. Nay, in all these
[53:57] things we are more than conquerors
[54:00] through him that loved us. Let us read
[54:04] the 37th verse in unison together. Nay,
[54:07] in all these things, we are more than
[54:11] conquerors through him that loved us. in
[54:14] Revelation 6 and verse one.
[54:20] It may on the surface seem difficult for
[54:22] you to tie these together, but that's
[54:24] why I'm here by God's help to try to
[54:28] bring something to you that will be
[54:31] relevant to our time,
[54:33] the opening of the seals. And I saw when
[54:36] the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I
[54:39] heard as it were, the noise of thunder,
[54:42] one of the four beasts, saying, "Come
[54:45] and see." And I saw, and behold, a white
[54:49] horse, and he that sat on him had a bow,
[54:52] and a crown was given unto him, and he
[54:56] went forth conquering and to conquer.
[54:59] But there was a people he couldn't
[55:00] conquer.
[55:02] And when he had opened the second seal,
[55:05] I heard the second beast say, "Come and
[55:08] see." He's saying that to John the
[55:10] Apostle. And there went out another
[55:13] horse that was red. And power was given
[55:17] unto him that sat thereon to take peace
[55:20] from the earth, and that they should
[55:22] kill one another. And there was given
[55:25] unto him a great sword. God bless you.
[55:29] You have your seats.
[55:36] I will need your undivided attention.
[55:40] And I trust you will
[55:45] be that keenly interested this morning
[55:48] and hungry for spiritual things. They
[55:51] that hunger and thirst after
[55:52] righteousness shall be filled.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The conditions that Apostle Paul
[55:58] speaks of and describes
[56:01] were due to two opposing forces.
[56:04] One which was the spirit of God in him
[56:08] and the other which was the spirit of
[56:11] the world. I will call it the spirit of
[56:13] antichrist. Now a lot of people as soon
[56:16] as they hear antichrist they think of
[56:18] some uh monster of some sort of thing.
[56:21] No, antirist is simply anti-word
[56:25] or we could say it's something that's
[56:27] unscriptural
[56:29] &gt;&gt; and that's everybody's understanding.
[56:32] You understand something that's
[56:33] unscriptural. Then if it's something
[56:36] that is unscriptural
[56:38] that is put forward
[56:40] and taught and then instructed
[56:44] uh then then it can become a doctrine.
[56:48] And we're going to brother Brandham in
[56:50] the opening of the seals. I think you'll
[56:53] find this really marvelous this morning
[56:56] as you take control of your thoughts and
[56:59] your mind and say just say now God give
[57:02] me understanding give me divine
[57:05] understanding because as apostle Paul
[57:09] he was he he's relating to these he said
[57:12] without our fightings and within our
[57:15] fears that's because he experiencing
[57:18] opposition
[57:20] and what he what caus caused opposition
[57:23] for him is still riding today.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed. This rider which
[57:32] began on a white horse and then you'll
[57:35] find he gets on a red horse and then on
[57:39] a black horse and then on a pale horse.
[57:44] It is the same writer
[57:46] writing through we we can say not only
[57:50] history but writing through the present
[57:51] time
[57:54] using whatever he has access to to
[57:58] better achieve his ends and his ends are
[58:03] to oppose all that is righteous to
[58:06] oppose the spirit of God and the work of
[58:10] God. That is his objective. And so as
[58:15] times change, Satan has used whatever he
[58:19] could have gain access to to uh more I
[58:25] would say to more to equip himself more
[58:29] uh efficiently to achieve his ends. And
[58:32] so that is what I want to uh try and by
[58:36] God's help to bring to you. Apostle
[58:39] Paul. Now you may uh question that but
[58:42] for mo you that know the scripture you
[58:44] will uh you will be able to relate to
[58:48] this scripture right away because the
[58:49] apostle John
[58:52] wrote and he was the one on the that
[58:54] would be later seeing the on the aisle
[58:57] of Patmas. He would see the entire
[59:00] revelation of the of the future. And he
[59:04] said these words, "And every spirit that
[59:07] confesseth not that Jesus Christ,
[59:10] notice, is come in the flesh, not that
[59:12] he will come in the flesh, but that he
[59:15] is come in the flesh,
[59:18] is not of God." And this is that spirit
[59:20] of Antichrist. That's how he could
[59:22] identify it. Wherefore you have heard,
[59:25] he's speaking to the ones he would
[59:28] relate to as call little children. You
[59:31] have heard that it should come and even
[59:34] now already is in the world that it has
[59:39] come. So he was telling them perhaps
[59:41] they weren't fully aware that it had
[59:44] come. He said you have heard that it
[59:46] will come but I'm telling you that it
[59:49] has come already the spirit of
[59:51] antichrist which was in the world.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And so he was well acquainted that it
[59:57] had already already appeared. Now,
[1:00:01] Apostle John, I want to just set the
[1:00:04] scene now. Apostle John, he saw this
[1:00:09] spirit of Antichrist as a horse rider
[1:00:14] changing his mounts
[1:00:17] at specific times
[1:00:20] from the white to the red to the black
[1:00:22] to the pale. So, and riding straight off
[1:00:25] into eternity.
[1:00:28] I won't say eternity, but into his final
[1:00:31] destruction.
[1:00:34] And he's writing a power, or we could
[1:00:38] say a method. He's using a method. He's
[1:00:43] using a tactic
[1:00:45] which will better further his ends at
[1:00:48] certain times. So, he starts out as a
[1:00:51] white horse, which the prophet declares
[1:00:54] was deception.
[1:00:57] It was so close right in that early
[1:01:00] church. It was so close. It was he rode
[1:01:04] out on a white horse and that gave him
[1:01:06] his foothold.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:01:10] he found that there was a he needed a a
[1:01:13] uh he needed something further that
[1:01:16] would further his end. And he comes to
[1:01:20] mounting a red horse which was the age
[1:01:23] of the martyrs.
[1:01:27] History records 68 million perished in
[1:01:32] the martyrdom.
[1:01:34] But as I closed last Sunday's service
[1:01:37] saying some are waiting for some great
[1:01:40] holocaust, some great nuclear
[1:01:43] uh catastrophic
[1:01:45] event on the face of the earth. And
[1:01:47] believe me, it's not something that's in
[1:01:49] the dream world. It's already under the
[1:01:52] it's in our silos. It's in the
[1:01:55] submarines. This isn't something we have
[1:01:57] to imagine. This is something that's
[1:02:00] present with us.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Both the United States and Russia, as
[1:02:04] far as that goes, both of them have
[1:02:07] enough nuclear power destruction
[1:02:10] in their in in their resource right now
[1:02:14] to destroy the entire earth.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Both of them individually have. I
[1:02:19] listened to uh a senior officer from the
[1:02:23] Pentagon and he was arguing against
[1:02:26] further missiles. He was arguing against
[1:02:29] it and he went into specifics of the
[1:02:33] power that has that is they have now he
[1:02:36] said we have enough power in the United
[1:02:38] States to knock the earth off its axis.
[1:02:42] sufficient power to man could destroy
[1:02:46] the entire earth if it was unleashed.
[1:02:49] And so these things are not something
[1:02:51] we're not here to try to be, you know,
[1:02:54] uh to startle you, but yet it is
[1:02:57] reality. I'm not one either to, you
[1:03:00] know, let's veil things and let's put
[1:03:02] our head in the sand. Let's pre pretend
[1:03:04] it's not here, especially if the
[1:03:06] scripture speaks about it.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:03:11] And then so we we say well on the red
[1:03:15] horse power we'll be going into it in a
[1:03:17] lot more detail the 68 million were
[1:03:21] martyed but I would like to suggest to
[1:03:25] you and furthermore I would make the
[1:03:27] statement to you that there are many
[1:03:30] more today we have the walking dead.
[1:03:35] Today we have men and women and young
[1:03:40] people that are burning in their lust
[1:03:43] and in their desire seeking fulfillment
[1:03:46] and can't find it.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of things and we you
[1:03:51] can find it in the materialistic world
[1:03:55] and you can find it in the in the world
[1:03:57] that is filled with want and fightings
[1:04:00] and warings that going on over the
[1:04:02] entire face of the earth. If you were
[1:04:04] God looking down on it, you'd say this
[1:04:06] is a sad situation.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; If you could look in all of these the
[1:04:12] nations around the world and see what is
[1:04:14] taking place and it's too terrible to
[1:04:17] discuss or talk about over the pullpit
[1:04:20] just what's going through my mind now
[1:04:22] and I'm not a great student of of n of
[1:04:25] of the news, but I do stay ab breast of
[1:04:28] things simply because it's been
[1:04:30] prophesied. But when you see children
[1:04:33] being used and abused the way they are
[1:04:37] around the world and some countries
[1:04:40] allow children just children to be
[1:04:43] captured and used for prostitution. I
[1:04:46] think it's terrible. Then you come to
[1:04:48] another part of the world and you'll
[1:04:50] find the government knows that there or
[1:04:53] their own citizens are being starved to
[1:04:56] death. not a not a not a hundred,
[1:05:00] not a thousand, but hundreds of
[1:05:03] thousands. And they will maintain their
[1:05:06] political position and allow their own
[1:05:09] citizens. And yet there's institutions
[1:05:12] and all kinds of uh uh
[1:05:16] societies which would run to help. You
[1:05:20] know, there was a part of the world, it
[1:05:21] was actually
[1:05:24] in northern Africa
[1:05:26] and Canada got into the act and said,
[1:05:29] "We'll send wheat. That's one thing we
[1:05:31] can send. We can send wheat." And they
[1:05:33] sent over hundreds and hundreds of
[1:05:36] thousands of bushels and train loads of
[1:05:39] wheat and just felt so good about being
[1:05:42] able to give this massive amount of
[1:05:44] wheat. They said there was 2 million
[1:05:47] people starving in the Sudan
[1:05:50] and the wheat went over there and our
[1:05:53] reporter, one of our reporters from the
[1:05:54] Vancouver Sun newspaper flew over to see
[1:05:57] how it was being distri how how the
[1:05:59] distribution was going and the
[1:06:01] distribution was going nowhere because
[1:06:03] they had no infrastructure to send the
[1:06:05] wheat to the starving people. And he
[1:06:07] said, "The only things that are getting
[1:06:09] fed by our wheat are the seagulls."
[1:06:12] And the piles of wheat were staying
[1:06:15] where they offloaded from the ships in
[1:06:18] huge piles at the docks.
[1:06:21] See, it's not that people don't want to
[1:06:23] do things. It is the system that is that
[1:06:26] is controlling the world is does not
[1:06:29] tend towards life. It tends towards
[1:06:32] death.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It tends towards the base
[1:06:37] character of man, unconverted man. And
[1:06:41] then there
[1:06:44] from the red horse he mounted a black
[1:06:46] horse which was down through the dark
[1:06:48] ages
[1:06:50] and then a pale horse and only when the
[1:06:53] rider comes on a pale horse is he named
[1:06:56] and the Bible names them as death.
[1:07:01] The challenge that I have today is to
[1:07:05] try to bring these things which are in
[1:07:08] symbolic terms and language to bring it
[1:07:12] and and to cover this bridge this gap
[1:07:15] between uh when it was seen and how it
[1:07:18] was written to the time that we are in
[1:07:21] and bring it into language that you and
[1:07:23] I use and that we understand. But let it
[1:07:26] be known to you that this is not some
[1:07:28] kind of mystical uh you know foggy uh
[1:07:33] wording and language that God put it in
[1:07:37] such a way so that we couldn't
[1:07:38] understand it. No, he put it in such a
[1:07:40] way so that you who are born again and
[1:07:43] believe that you have received the
[1:07:45] spirit of God, I want you to know and
[1:07:47] alert you today. You have access. You
[1:07:50] are to expect to understand what you
[1:07:53] have need of in this time.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:08:05] even the spirit of antichrist
[1:08:08] cannot conquer the believer.
[1:08:12] And there is one that is writing in this
[1:08:14] time
[1:08:16] and his purpose is to conquer.
[1:08:19] He's tireless,
[1:08:22] changing his methods.
[1:08:24] He is a slicker, deceitful,
[1:08:27] using every possible means to achieve
[1:08:30] his end. But I want to say to you from
[1:08:33] the message, the end time conditions,
[1:08:37] although they are at work and they're
[1:08:40] present with us today, we have an end
[1:08:44] time message that will meet the end time
[1:08:47] conditions. Amen.
[1:08:51] The world around us
[1:08:54] as you and I experience it daily
[1:08:59] has been designed
[1:09:01] by Satan who the Bible calls and I will
[1:09:05] give you the Bible's description the
[1:09:08] prince of the power of the air in
[1:09:11] Ephesians 2 and2
[1:09:14] he is called Satan himself is
[1:09:17] transformed into an angel of light. He's
[1:09:20] called an angel of light. In 2
[1:09:24] Corinthians 4 and4, perhaps the most
[1:09:26] powerful, the God of this world, small
[1:09:30] G, the God of this world. What is the
[1:09:34] Apostle Paul saying? He's saying this
[1:09:37] being, this angel of light is actually
[1:09:40] worshiped by the people of the earth.
[1:09:43] And the apostle John under the divine
[1:09:45] inspiration of the Holy Spirit said,
[1:09:48] "All whose names are not found in the
[1:09:52] book of life will worship him."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Will bow down and worship him. Oh, it
[1:09:59] doesn't mean necessarily that you'll get
[1:10:00] on your knees and and and and go before
[1:10:04] some statue or some image, but it is it
[1:10:07] is however he uh presents himself. He
[1:10:10] may present himself in some system or in
[1:10:13] some order or some uh some worship or
[1:10:17] some doctrine and he brings people in
[1:10:19] subjection and in obesence to that and
[1:10:23] he has them bowing and they don't
[1:10:25] realize it. And Paul said in in uh uh
[1:10:28] Thessalonians that that that
[1:10:31] Satan himself will set himself up in the
[1:10:35] temple of God so that he will be
[1:10:37] worshiped as God. Listen, this has been
[1:10:40] his objective from day one.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; This is why he was thrown out of heaven.
[1:10:45] That's why the great war that took place
[1:10:47] there.
[1:10:49] The God of this evil age,
[1:10:52] I want to just bring it down here. I'm
[1:10:54] going to bridge the gap just now. The
[1:10:55] God of this evil age has designed the
[1:10:59] world that you're in contact and you rub
[1:11:02] shoulders with every day.
[1:11:05] And I can tell you that this slicker, he
[1:11:08] is not he he he he's not uh he he he's
[1:11:13] not intimidated.
[1:11:15] He's come to your school, young people.
[1:11:21] He's come to your colleges
[1:11:24] and places of higher education.
[1:11:28] He's come to your home.
[1:11:32] Not afraid of your the walls of your
[1:11:34] house.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He's come to your place of work.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He's come into the financial community
[1:11:44] to organize things to set it up to shut
[1:11:48] out God and squeeze God out of the life.
[1:11:54] He's brought all kinds of conditions and
[1:11:57] circumstances that press upon you. I'm
[1:12:01] talking about this day.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about what color
[1:12:04] he is writing now. He's writing to be
[1:12:08] the most effective that he can to
[1:12:11] captivate the minds of the people.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether we say, "Oh, well,
[1:12:15] it's a little uh uh, you know, a little
[1:12:18] video game or it's a little this or it's
[1:12:20] a little that." I tell you what, he
[1:12:21] doesn't care what. He'll use every kind
[1:12:23] of possible means, whether it be the
[1:12:26] man's business or the woman's shopping
[1:12:29] or the fashion industry or the school or
[1:12:32] the education or the higher education.
[1:12:35] And not last, not last and not least,
[1:12:38] the church.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He thinks that's a that's a heyday for
[1:12:42] him
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; to get into the church because out
[1:12:45] there's just the circumstances of
[1:12:48] external circumstances. But what he
[1:12:51] wants to do is capture the minds. He
[1:12:54] wants to gain that loyalty. You see,
[1:12:56] some nations are very, very,
[1:12:59] so let's say they're very gallant, very
[1:13:02] patriotic.
[1:13:04] And I'll be perfectly honest. Uh,
[1:13:06] America, the United States is a very
[1:13:10] patriotic nation. And I I admire that.
[1:13:14] Canada, we don't seem to have much to be
[1:13:18] patriotic about. I don't know why, but
[1:13:20] we just haven't got the same attitude.
[1:13:22] Our flag doesn't seem to mean what, you
[1:13:24] know, what uh the stars and stripes
[1:13:26] means. And these are just these are
[1:13:28] realities. This this is the truth. And
[1:13:31] uh and but but America, as patriotic as
[1:13:35] the people are, the government's not
[1:13:37] able to hold everybody,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; not able to capture everybody. There's
[1:13:41] people that are against it, you know, or
[1:13:44] they're for the government or against
[1:13:45] the government. Every nation has the
[1:13:47] same thing. But when you start coming
[1:13:49] into the realm of religion and you get a
[1:13:52] teaching and a doctrine and you get a
[1:13:55] spirit that's promoting it and people's
[1:13:58] minds there they willingly give
[1:14:00] themselves or maybe are born and raised
[1:14:02] up into it and they are they are in a
[1:14:06] certain religion and a certain faith.
[1:14:08] Satan knows that that he can capture and
[1:14:12] gain control of the mind and the soul of
[1:14:15] the individual, the heart and get a
[1:14:17] commitment he can never get through the
[1:14:20] government.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; So now this is this is kind of setting
[1:14:24] the stage.
[1:14:26] Now
[1:14:28] in this day we have uh
[1:14:32] the age of superpowers.
[1:14:35] We have the power of we could say
[1:14:38] military power, the power of wealth, the
[1:14:42] power of I looked up some of these. The
[1:14:44] power of feminism, the feminist feminism
[1:14:47] movement, the power of wealth, the power
[1:14:50] of all of these various things. The
[1:14:53] power of popularity, but we have the
[1:14:55] power of the revealed word.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a very, very
[1:14:59] powerful element that we have access to.
[1:15:03] And here I'll just bring and conclude
[1:15:05] this little part here. The end time
[1:15:08] messenger and message should meet the
[1:15:12] end time conditions.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, don't you
[1:15:16] think so?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; And I say yes, I do think so.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; The end time message should meet the end
[1:15:22] time conditions.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:33] says, "We are here. Here we are. End
[1:15:37] time. Red light down, flashing. The
[1:15:42] coming of the Lord is at hand. The end
[1:15:45] time message should meet the end time
[1:15:48] conditions. And where they've got off,
[1:15:51] the message ought to bring it back."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Where people have got off track, the
[1:15:56] message ought to bring it back.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Bible clearly states and
[1:16:02] clearly describes how Satan will use the
[1:16:06] power of religion. I want you to listen
[1:16:09] real real close.
[1:16:12] And all that dwell upon the earth,
[1:16:14] Revelation 13:8,
[1:16:16] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:16:20] written in the book of life of the Lamb
[1:16:23] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:16:26] Jesus said to the Samaritan woman,
[1:16:28] because you may be here and there may be
[1:16:31] many that are listening and they may
[1:16:32] wonder, well, uh, how's the world going
[1:16:35] to, you know, worship this god of this
[1:16:37] evil age? How's that actually going to
[1:16:39] happen?
[1:16:41] Jesus said to the woman at the well, she
[1:16:43] was a Samaritan and her question was
[1:16:46] actually a spiritual question when he
[1:16:48] began to get down to that realm of her
[1:16:51] spirit.
[1:16:54] said, "Go and get your husband." Said,
[1:16:56] "I have no husband."
[1:16:59] She started by saying,
[1:17:06] "The Samaritans say we should worship in
[1:17:09] this mountain, and the Jews say we
[1:17:11] should worship in Jerusalem." And she
[1:17:14] was confused concerning worship. And
[1:17:17] Jesus responded with this statement. You
[1:17:19] Samaritans, you worship. You don't know
[1:17:21] what.
[1:17:23] Just think about that statement. So, he
[1:17:26] was saying, he wasn't saying you don't
[1:17:27] worship. He's saying you don't know what
[1:17:30] you worship.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a a true
[1:17:34] statement for today.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; That's just as that's just as real today
[1:17:38] and applicable today. People worship,
[1:17:40] but they don't know what they worship.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; It's not that they don't worship. And
[1:17:46] you worship you know not what. He said,
[1:17:47] "We know what we worship for salvation
[1:17:49] is of the Jews." Jesus also said to
[1:17:52] people who are worshiped and in fact
[1:17:55] spent their life worshshiping. And he
[1:17:57] said to the scribes and Pharisees, "But
[1:17:59] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[1:18:02] doctrines and commandments of men." And
[1:18:04] I can guarantee you that the people he
[1:18:07] was speaking to when he said that said,
[1:18:10] "Worship you,
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; worship you," they considered him their
[1:18:15] enemy.
[1:18:17] They considered him a false teacher.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; But he's saying in vain do you worship
[1:18:24] me. They didn't have any idea
[1:18:27] that that's what was taking place.
[1:18:31] People do not know what worship is
[1:18:33] number one and do not know who they are
[1:18:36] actually bowing down to and worshiping.
[1:18:42] Now,
[1:18:44] last week I just mentioned and the
[1:18:46] scripture refers to in 2 Thessalonians
[1:18:52] and brother Brandham makes a lot of
[1:18:54] reference to it that he who letth
[1:18:58] will now let until he be taken out of
[1:19:01] the way. And here's the scripture for
[1:19:03] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:19:06] work. See, it wasn't something that was
[1:19:08] just going to be in the future. It
[1:19:10] wasn't something that was passed. Paul
[1:19:11] was saying it would already work. Only
[1:19:14] he that now letth. And the prophet
[1:19:18] states to us that he who leth is none
[1:19:22] other than the Holy Spirit. He who leth
[1:19:24] until he be taken out of the way until
[1:19:28] he's allowing things until he be taken
[1:19:31] out of the way. And then when he's taken
[1:19:34] out of the way, then shall the wicked be
[1:19:37] revealed. That is when when the Holy
[1:19:40] Spirit who is presently a restraining
[1:19:43] force in the earth when he is taken out
[1:19:47] of the way and when he's taken out of
[1:19:49] the way the believer is taken out also
[1:19:53] taken out of the way into a change of
[1:19:56] the body into a rapture of the church.
[1:19:58] He said we shall be caught up. We shall
[1:20:01] not all we shall we shall not all sleep.
[1:20:04] Apostle Paul says, "For the dead in
[1:20:06] Christ shall rise first." Period. Then
[1:20:10] we who are alive and remain shall be
[1:20:12] caught up together with them to meet the
[1:20:15] Lord in the air.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's the process.
[1:20:20] But the Bible says, and Paul is saying
[1:20:23] to the Thessalonians, when he who now
[1:20:26] letth, when he's taken out of the way,
[1:20:30] then the wicked, the wicked will shall
[1:20:34] that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord
[1:20:37] himself shall consume with the spirit of
[1:20:40] his mouth, and shall destroy with the
[1:20:43] brightness of his coming. There is a
[1:20:46] conclusion to this conflict.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham asked, "Do you get
[1:20:53] it?" He said, "Now Paul's speaking the
[1:20:56] time when the seal of God is being made
[1:20:59] known, his spirit, his name, his grace."
[1:21:04] I'll ask you, has his name been made
[1:21:06] known to you?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Has his grace been made known to you?
[1:21:11] and all these other great mysteries
[1:21:13] that's been going forth. Now, plans for
[1:21:16] his church to go in the rapture, the
[1:21:18] outpouring of the Holy Spirit has done
[1:21:21] this. And that's what he done in the
[1:21:24] last days. That's what he has he has
[1:21:27] accomplished in the last days. Yes sir.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:21:38] the scripture refers as it was in the
[1:21:41] days of Lot. Brother Brenham asks, "Oh,
[1:21:44] think people
[1:21:46] Oh, think people could go right on
[1:21:49] preaching,
[1:21:50] thinking they're getting saved."
[1:21:53] I want you to listen very close. When
[1:21:56] the church is gone, and I'll prove this
[1:21:59] to you in just a moment. When the church
[1:22:01] is gone, do you know that there people
[1:22:04] say, "Oh, it's just a mass exodus of
[1:22:07] people and dirt flying up and the
[1:22:09] gravestones." And there's no such thing
[1:22:11] in the scripture.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; It's a secret. It's a secret catching
[1:22:15] away of the church. There are literally
[1:22:18] hundreds,
[1:22:20] hundreds, if not thousands missing in
[1:22:23] America, North America, in one day. and
[1:22:26] they know nothing about it. They don't
[1:22:28] even know where they are. The missing
[1:22:30] file is is they don't even try to find
[1:22:34] them.
[1:22:36] You may question that. That's the That's
[1:22:38] the truth.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; People are missing every day. Hundreds
[1:22:41] go missing every day. And they don't
[1:22:43] know. I'm not saying that's the rapture,
[1:22:45] but it'll be like the rapture.
[1:22:49] The Jews when Jesus Christ was there on
[1:22:52] earth and the Jews saw him, the Jews
[1:22:55] even participated in some of the great
[1:22:58] miracles in eating the loaves and the
[1:23:01] fishes and drinking the water that was
[1:23:03] turned into wine and all of those things
[1:23:05] that were taking place. They
[1:23:07] participated in that and they were
[1:23:09] living when Jesus Christ himself was
[1:23:12] received up into heaven.
[1:23:17] Do you think they believed it
[1:23:18] afterwards? Not a chance.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Did they go to the synagogue the next
[1:23:22] week? Absolutely. Did they have the
[1:23:25] Passover the following year? You want to
[1:23:27] believe they did.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Did they keep the word? Absolutely. Did
[1:23:31] they worship? Absolutely. But he had
[1:23:33] come and gone.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that as he came,
[1:23:39] that's the way it'll be again. people
[1:23:41] will go on and no doubt this building
[1:23:43] will be standing when the raptured
[1:23:46] saints have left. I don't know who will
[1:23:48] be here but by God's grace I don't plan
[1:23:50] to be behind this pull pit and I
[1:23:53] certainly don't plan to be looking down
[1:23:55] into your face and I trust you aren't
[1:23:57] here to take in a service because it
[1:24:00] it'll go on.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; There'll be somebody to take the
[1:24:04] service. There'll be somebody and the
[1:24:06] prophet said they'll go on preaching and
[1:24:09] thinking that people are getting saved.
[1:24:11] There'll be people, people won't stop
[1:24:13] shedding tears. People won't stop being
[1:24:16] disappointed. People won't stop having
[1:24:18] an emotional upheaval. People won't stop
[1:24:20] being convicted that they've done
[1:24:22] something wrong. But it won't be the
[1:24:24] Holy Spirit that's drawing them.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; They'll just aware. And Jesus even, and
[1:24:30] I closed last week, Jesus even spoke of
[1:24:33] the rich man, the young man that went
[1:24:37] went into hell itself. He didn't lose
[1:24:41] his consciousness. He didn't lose his
[1:24:43] senses. He didn't lose his balance of
[1:24:45] understanding. He still remembered he
[1:24:47] had five brethren. He knew they weren't
[1:24:50] believers. And suddenly, he knew what
[1:24:52] the answer was.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Let Lazarus go back.
[1:24:56] He wanted to preach to them.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; He wanted to tell them, "Make sure they
[1:25:01] don't come here."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends, that death
[1:25:05] doesn't end at all.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; God has been dealing with me in the last
[1:25:09] week, and I want to preach a message to
[1:25:11] you on the finality of death.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; But there are some things that are not
[1:25:15] final.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; There are some things not concluded at
[1:25:19] death. It'll be just a you will go from
[1:25:21] the element of of the mortal to the
[1:25:24] element of the immortal
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; or to another realm. And to those that
[1:25:29] are lost, it's not an immortal state in
[1:25:33] that sense of the word. I won't bother
[1:25:35] getting into it.
[1:25:39] And so he says they'll go on preaching
[1:25:44] thinking they're getting saved,
[1:25:45] believing they're doing right, and
[1:25:48] believing their organization are growing
[1:25:50] and not even a ray of hope.
[1:25:56] Try to convince try to convince those
[1:26:00] that are in Israel
[1:26:03] that Jesus Christ had actually come.
[1:26:10] The Holy Spirit will have lifted from
[1:26:12] off the earth.
[1:26:16] Jesus said, "But the comforter, which is
[1:26:19] the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; whom the Father will send in my name."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It's also spoken that he that was sent
[1:26:32] will also leave.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Right. Good. There'll be as there was a
[1:26:38] commencement of the age of grace,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; there is a conclusion to the age of
[1:26:45] grace.
[1:26:50] He that leth will be taken out of the
[1:26:54] way
[1:26:55] as we near the end time.
[1:26:59] And you'll allow me please to be a
[1:27:02] little bit slow and deliberate this
[1:27:03] morning because I want to be very
[1:27:07] specific with what I'm saying.
[1:27:10] The conditions as we near this this end
[1:27:14] time, you and I happen to be children
[1:27:19] of a time such as there's never been on
[1:27:23] the face of the earth quite like this.
[1:27:26] All the seeds of Genesis
[1:27:29] have come to a harvest time. All the
[1:27:34] seeds that were sown, deception sown in
[1:27:38] Gen in Genesis, but it has come to its
[1:27:41] full bloom today.
[1:27:43] All of these things that were sown, now
[1:27:46] we are the people that are in the
[1:27:48] harvest time in end time. And the end
[1:27:51] time conditions will mature. These
[1:27:54] conditions have matured to a place.
[1:28:00] I don't want to be pessimist but I
[1:28:02] because I'm a very very much an optimist
[1:28:04] but I say out of the depths of my heart
[1:28:07] and I believe that I can prove this to
[1:28:08] you. We are literally moving into a
[1:28:12] judgment
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; as I had on the screen. I'm not going to
[1:28:18] I have some other slides for you today
[1:28:21] but the Institute of Mental Health of
[1:28:25] the United States I was so affected by
[1:28:28] that
[1:28:30] declaring from the age of 18
[1:28:34] and over one of every four Americans
[1:28:38] have a diagnosible
[1:28:41] mental illness.
[1:28:44] And that does not take into
[1:28:46] consideration those that have not been
[1:28:48] diagnosed with a mental illness. They
[1:28:51] said the total of America, this is from
[1:28:54] from their own National Institute of
[1:28:56] Health, you can look it up on the web if
[1:28:59] you wish, 57.7
[1:29:02] million Americans. Now, just multiply
[1:29:05] that by what we have in Canada if you
[1:29:08] want to use the same percentages. And
[1:29:10] I'm sure that you couldn't. it it would
[1:29:12] be identical.
[1:29:14] But 57.7
[1:29:16] million almost double the population of
[1:29:19] this entire country mental mental
[1:29:22] illness that have been diagnosed
[1:29:26] as mentally ill from 18 and over. And I
[1:29:30] can tell you young people there's a lot
[1:29:32] of them 18 and under. Right.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I've been I've been to the psychiatric
[1:29:38] ward in our hospitals more than once
[1:29:43] and saw young people there. I know of a
[1:29:47] young fellow that was in his mid- teens
[1:29:50] that was enticed to take drugs once and
[1:29:53] it turned him into a total vegetable
[1:29:55] right here in this city.
[1:29:59] Just once but he vegetable for the rest
[1:30:02] of his life.
[1:30:05] I've been to the mental institute the
[1:30:09] actually the insane institute and have
[1:30:12] seen and been amongst the people there
[1:30:14] and went there specifically to visit one
[1:30:16] young man who we brought out and had for
[1:30:19] five weeks and the only thing he
[1:30:21] wouldn't respond to was we can pray and
[1:30:25] cast those demons out of you and you
[1:30:28] will be free and he wasn't prepared for
[1:30:31] that but he did want all the help that
[1:30:33] he could get. And when uh I received a
[1:30:36] call from the psychiatrist, from the
[1:30:38] doctor and went back into the mental
[1:30:40] institute with him and the three of us
[1:30:43] were sitting there and uh and the doctor
[1:30:45] now began to question me,
[1:30:49] asked me, "Do you believe in demon
[1:30:52] possession?"
[1:30:54] I said, "As the Bible refers to it,
[1:30:57] yes."
[1:31:00] He said, "Do you believe in exorcism?" I
[1:31:02] knew what it meant, but I said, "What
[1:31:04] does that mean?"
[1:31:06] I want him to say it. He said, "It means
[1:31:09] it is the practice of casting out
[1:31:10] demons." I said, "As Jesus taught it."
[1:31:13] Yes.
[1:31:16] And then he was having trouble framing
[1:31:18] some more questions. And so I thought I
[1:31:20] would just ease up. I said, "Listen,
[1:31:22] doctor,"
[1:31:24] I said, "Uh, we believe what the
[1:31:27] scripture teaches."
[1:31:30] But I said, "What we really believe is
[1:31:32] that most all mental sickness is first a
[1:31:38] spiritual illness."
[1:31:41] And he just let down his garden smile.
[1:31:43] He says, he says, "I would agree with
[1:31:46] that. I would agree with that. It's
[1:31:49] first a spiritual illness, then became a
[1:31:52] mental illness." And he told me, he
[1:31:54] said, "It's remarkable what's happened
[1:31:55] to this young man in the five weeks
[1:31:57] you've had him.
[1:31:59] It's remarkable because he had been so
[1:32:02] just the atmosphere and being in the
[1:32:04] meetings and hearing truth, it had such
[1:32:06] an effect on him and he stopped taking
[1:32:08] his medication and all the rest of it.
[1:32:10] But he didn't want to be totally free.
[1:32:12] He didn't want to be prayed for and have
[1:32:14] the demons cast out of him. It's a
[1:32:16] reality, friends.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't weary me saying that,
[1:32:19] but it's the real world that we're in.
[1:32:31] I'm going to show you uh two or three
[1:32:34] slides
[1:32:40] and just move through this as quickly as
[1:32:44] I can.
[1:32:47] Hereby know ye the spirit of God, even
[1:32:52] the spirit that confessth that Jesus is
[1:32:54] come in the flesh is of God.
[1:32:59] And every spirit that confessth not that
[1:33:01] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:33:04] of God. And this is that spirit of
[1:33:07] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[1:33:10] should come and even now already is in
[1:33:15] the world.
[1:33:17] In the first church age,
[1:33:20] the antichrist spirit is right. We go
[1:33:22] right to the church age of Ephesus. The
[1:33:26] antichrist or anti-word spirit appeared
[1:33:30] in the form of a deed. I want you to
[1:33:33] notice this very closely.
[1:33:35] First a deed. Revelation 2 and6. But
[1:33:40] this thou hast that thou hatest the
[1:33:43] deeds of the nickelans
[1:33:46] which I also hate.
[1:33:50] From deeds to doctrine.
[1:33:54] And the deeds of the nickelans became a
[1:33:57] doctrine
[1:33:59] after the Nyian council. They formed
[1:34:02] their own faith. put up their own men.
[1:34:06] Nicl means conquer. Nicicoatans means to
[1:34:11] conquer the leoty or put all the
[1:34:14] holiness in a man. Now what is happening
[1:34:18] here is I want to take this portion
[1:34:23] where he gets off his white horse
[1:34:27] into onto his red horse because on the
[1:34:31] white horse the rider he was using
[1:34:34] deception and the scripture says he had
[1:34:37] a bow
[1:34:39] arrows had a bow but no arrows. So his
[1:34:43] his power or his ability to achieve his
[1:34:46] end was limited. And it says and it was
[1:34:50] and there was given him a crown. He
[1:34:52] didn't have a crown but he was crowned.
[1:34:55] And now the prophet brings it to us. You
[1:34:58] cannot crown a spirit. And so now you
[1:35:01] have a group of people and he said I
[1:35:04] hope it's we have it here now. The
[1:35:07] church that was at Pentecost, the early
[1:35:09] church, it was quite a large church at
[1:35:12] the beginning, but they started a
[1:35:14] denominational spirit coming among them
[1:35:18] trying to denominate the church
[1:35:22] which was called the deeds of the
[1:35:24] nickelans. See, just some deeds, some
[1:35:27] things were taking place within the
[1:35:29] church that were uh and the deeds were
[1:35:35] that there were men that raised up and
[1:35:38] brother Brandham refers to them as
[1:35:40] Paul's wolves. Paul the apostle said in
[1:35:44] Acts, I believe the uh I'll refer to it
[1:35:48] a little later on. I have the scripture
[1:35:50] reference here. And he refers to him. He
[1:35:52] says, "I know that after my departure,
[1:35:54] grievous wolves will come in."
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And this is what he was striving to warn
[1:36:00] them about. Grievous wolves will come in
[1:36:03] and and it was an antichrist spirit or
[1:36:06] anti-word spirit, something that was
[1:36:08] unscriptural and just it began to be a a
[1:36:12] deed amongst the people. And then the
[1:36:16] these men that had risen up as leaders,
[1:36:19] it was necessary that these deeds then
[1:36:23] became a doctrine.
[1:36:26] You understand? Then the doctrine needed
[1:36:29] to be teached. And so that required a
[1:36:33] group of men to rise up and they became
[1:36:37] uh the teachers of the doctrine of the
[1:36:40] deed. And that is how he was evolving or
[1:36:46] changing his power because as a just as
[1:36:51] a deception bringing amongst the people
[1:36:54] that uh well even back in Paul's time
[1:36:57] and there was problem they wanted to
[1:36:59] continue with circumcision as well they
[1:37:02] wanted to do various things for example
[1:37:04] now now I'll just bring it to our time
[1:37:06] listen closely you know sometime we go
[1:37:09] to some parts of the world and it is
[1:37:12] it's absolutely essential that the woman
[1:37:15] wear a covering on her head. She must
[1:37:18] wear a covering on her head. So we were
[1:37:21] in a we were in Russia and they wanted
[1:37:24] my wife to sing and so uh she was
[1:37:28] prepared to sing and in the morning they
[1:37:31] asked her and we noticed all the ladies
[1:37:34] wear a covering over their head. Well,
[1:37:38] and even in uh I was born into a
[1:37:41] Catholic church in a Catholic faith and
[1:37:44] my father was an altar boy in a Catholic
[1:37:47] church before he was converted and the
[1:37:49] women wouldn't think of not wearing a
[1:37:51] hat because uh that was an essential
[1:37:55] part. Now that's a deed but the deed
[1:37:57] then becomes a doctrine.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And then to the doctrine there's
[1:38:01] attached a spirituality to it. See now
[1:38:05] you sisters dress in a certain way. And
[1:38:07] I can tell you that there's no
[1:38:09] spirituality to a long dress.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; It's not the dress that's spiritual.
[1:38:15] It's what God has done in the heart of
[1:38:17] an individual. And no, I do not want to
[1:38:20] expose my body in a certain way to cause
[1:38:24] to cause men say to lust after it. And
[1:38:26] so I do this because we've had a
[1:38:29] vindicated voice, a vindicated message
[1:38:32] that has instructed us how we should
[1:38:34] live and how we should dress and how we
[1:38:36] should conduct ourselves. But now,
[1:38:40] so my wife in the morning, she said,
[1:38:43] "Yes, we'll sing." In the evening when
[1:38:46] we came, a man was standing at the door
[1:38:49] and gave her a covering for her head.
[1:38:52] And God spoke to my wife's heart. She
[1:38:57] must not do that because then the people
[1:39:01] will feel that there's some spirituality
[1:39:04] associated with this piece of cloth. And
[1:39:07] there's no spirituality attached to that
[1:39:09] piece of cloth. And so she she didn't
[1:39:14] refuse it. She just said no thank you.
[1:39:17] And they said no thank you.
[1:39:21] So she didn't put it on and they didn't
[1:39:22] have her sing. That's how important that
[1:39:25] was. Now so it becomes a a deed and then
[1:39:30] it became a doctrine. In Paul's time
[1:39:33] they wanted to continue circumcision.
[1:39:36] So fine circumcision is fine but there
[1:39:40] was no spirituality attached to it.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And so they had conflict in the early
[1:39:46] church whether they wanted to circumcise
[1:39:48] a son or not. circumcise a son. That's
[1:39:50] up to the family. But one thing for
[1:39:53] sure, they wanted to bring it as a deed
[1:39:55] and continue it in the church as a
[1:39:57] spiritual doctrine. And Paul said, "No."
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; We are circumcised in the heart.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; And they possibly want to carry on
[1:40:09] certain holy days. And Paul said, "No,
[1:40:13] there is no certain holy days."
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:17] We've been freed from that.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; See, and the law has been uh completed
[1:40:23] in Jesus Christ.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And so now, but this writer, I want you
[1:40:29] to please get this because now I'll
[1:40:32] carry on with some quotes in a moment.
[1:40:33] So now he he needs more
[1:40:37] a more effective way. Satan, don't
[1:40:40] forget Satan, he's not just he's not
[1:40:43] wanting to just uh control the external
[1:40:46] parts of a person's environment, but he
[1:40:48] wants to dominate from the inside
[1:40:51] because he knows that's where control
[1:40:53] is.
[1:40:55] And so now here this this power has a
[1:41:00] has a bow, no arrows, and he's moving
[1:41:04] moving now to take a more uh shall I say
[1:41:08] a a a position of more authority. And so
[1:41:13] what he does is now watch very close.
[1:41:18] He needs to unite
[1:41:20] you see as a church and just as a
[1:41:23] doctrine. And brother Brandham said, "A
[1:41:24] doctrine is innocent can't slay
[1:41:26] anybody." A doctrine, a simple innocent
[1:41:29] doctrine can't slay anybody. But the
[1:41:32] doctrine required a priesthood to teach
[1:41:35] the doctrine. And then the priesthood
[1:41:38] became a structured entity. It had
[1:41:41] bishops and then needed overseers and
[1:41:45] bishops and cardinals. And finally 300
[1:41:48] years later uh had a pope
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and now they had a structure.
[1:41:55] And then in order to complete this
[1:41:58] transition from the white horse to the
[1:42:00] red horse then the structure that was
[1:42:04] the church structure. Then it became
[1:42:08] married to the state. And so now state
[1:42:11] and church because the church could not
[1:42:15] did not have sufficient authority to
[1:42:18] resist those that were heretics and that
[1:42:20] were opposing them and actually put them
[1:42:23] to death. That's what the red horse is
[1:42:25] all about. And the martyology
[1:42:28] there was they throw some in prison and
[1:42:30] kill some in the time of the book of the
[1:42:32] acts. But now as the church grew
[1:42:36] and as they took and set up this
[1:42:38] hierarchy, those that were born of the
[1:42:41] Holy Spirit, we're not going to bow to
[1:42:43] that.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; They would not bow to that. And so they
[1:42:46] had to unite the church and the state
[1:42:49] together. And then when the church had a
[1:42:52] statehood, then they could authorize
[1:42:55] this is an enemy and we need to destroy
[1:42:58] them. And thus the age of the martyology
[1:43:01] came.
[1:43:04] I'm going to say some things that maybe
[1:43:07] you may agree with and I don't care
[1:43:08] whether you do or not, but I I'm I I I
[1:43:11] feel sufficiently confident to say them.
[1:43:15] You know, we're here uh a very diverse
[1:43:20] congregation of people,
[1:43:23] but you know, it's something that I've
[1:43:25] thought of quite a bit. It's amazing
[1:43:29] how a government, the state can begin
[1:43:32] because they've got control of the media
[1:43:35] and they can begin to feed people the
[1:43:37] information slanted the way they want to
[1:43:39] slant it
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; until you build up almost a feeling of
[1:43:44] animosity against another ethnic group.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And then the state can tell you these
[1:43:51] people are dangerous.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; These people want to kill you,
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; right? We need to arm ourselves. We need
[1:43:59] to defend ourselves. We need to go over
[1:44:02] there and drop our bombs and take our
[1:44:05] artillery and do whatever. And one
[1:44:07] nation will rise up against another
[1:44:09] nation because they're able to succeed
[1:44:12] in controlling the minds of the people.
[1:44:14] And because they're a state, if you went
[1:44:16] out and killed somebody, you're a
[1:44:17] murderer.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; But if the state tells you to do it,
[1:44:21] you're a hero.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Now, folks,
[1:44:26] Something's wrong.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Something's wrong.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, we need to be
[1:44:32] we need to be gallant and we need to be
[1:44:34] uh to defend our that's that I have no
[1:44:38] argument with that. That's not what I'm
[1:44:40] talking about. But this is what this is
[1:44:43] what the Antichrist spirit saw. We
[1:44:46] cannot we do not have the power or the
[1:44:49] authority on this white horse to slay
[1:44:52] our enemies. And so we must unite in a
[1:44:55] marriage the state and the church. And
[1:44:58] that's why the Vatican today is a state.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And listen to me close now. And the
[1:45:06] state.
[1:45:07] And that is why that church is so intent
[1:45:10] on uniting itself with the various
[1:45:14] states of heads of state because
[1:45:19] this is a this this is the whole program
[1:45:22] and Satan has designed that office
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; for a one world power control
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and you will bend to it if your name is
[1:45:34] not in the book. you will certainly come
[1:45:36] under its control and you will bend to
[1:45:39] it.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; So it was trying to denominate the
[1:45:49] church which was called the deeds of the
[1:45:51] nicicoatans and these deeds of the
[1:45:54] nickelatans. Now it wasn't a doctrine
[1:45:56] yet.
[1:45:59] When he first started he was just a
[1:46:01] little doctrine in amongst the people
[1:46:03] called the nickelonism. And now
[1:46:05] nickelanism friends is two words nickel
[1:46:10] control or conquer
[1:46:13] the leoty the people.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; We don't believe that here.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; We absolutely believe against that. We
[1:46:21] do not believe that this office controls
[1:46:23] the people. We believe that the people
[1:46:26] simply out of respect for the ministry.
[1:46:29] If the ministry has a ministry, then
[1:46:32] they're free to come. They're free to
[1:46:33] go. They're free to do whatever they
[1:46:35] wish to do. But if they say that feeds
[1:46:38] my soul, and I'm there of my own accord.
[1:46:41] I'm there because my soul is fed. That's
[1:46:44] where that's where that that's that's
[1:46:47] the criteria. That's right.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; And if it's not that, then you know, you
[1:46:52] got to find yourself a a place that you
[1:46:54] have confidence in.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:47:01] of course, it wouldn't slay anything. A
[1:47:03] doctrine, you see, and that's
[1:47:05] Revelations 2 and 6. It's just a
[1:47:08] doctrine, just a spirit amongst the
[1:47:10] people. Oh, he was so innocent riding on
[1:47:14] the white horse. A doctrine would
[1:47:17] require that there be a priesthood to
[1:47:19] teach the doctrine. Just what I just
[1:47:21] went through. Paul's wolves had become
[1:47:23] nicicoatans. And that's the from the
[1:47:26] Ephesian church age.
[1:47:28] For I know that this after I know this
[1:47:32] that after my departing shall grievous
[1:47:34] wolves enter in among you, not sparing
[1:47:37] the flock. And that is Acts 20 and 29.
[1:47:43] And they were trying to form a
[1:47:44] priesthood like a Levitical priesthood
[1:47:47] which was foreign to the New Testament
[1:47:49] doctrine. The word nickel the Greek word
[1:47:52] nicl means to conquer or overcome. When
[1:47:56] when he starts off as a nickelia spirit
[1:48:00] in the church he's a spirit and you
[1:48:03] can't crown a spirit. Are you able to
[1:48:05] put some of these things together now?
[1:48:07] But 300 years later he became a pope and
[1:48:11] then they crowned him. Nickelan doctrine
[1:48:15] became a man and then they could crown
[1:48:20] it. Now we come down a lot of years
[1:48:23] later and some of you here in the church
[1:48:25] have seen uh some of this. This is Pope
[1:48:27] Paul II very very popular. I wonder if
[1:48:30] we can dim the lights please.
[1:48:36] Uh now we have pre President Clinton,
[1:48:39] President Bush Senior, President Bush
[1:48:42] Jr. and other dignitaries coming before
[1:48:46] the body of Pope Paul II. And here we
[1:48:52] have them kneeling
[1:48:54] before this form.
[1:48:57] I just want to ask you,
[1:49:00] you think Luther would be there?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:49:05] You think some of these saints, you
[1:49:08] think Wesley would be there?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; These men represent tens of millions of
[1:49:16] Lutheran of Methodists of fundamental
[1:49:20] Christians. In fact, as they say,
[1:49:23] according to the Americans,
[1:49:25] they said that it was uh
[1:49:28] the fundamental Christians which
[1:49:30] actually got President Bush in.
[1:49:33] And you must know by the scripture.
[1:49:35] Understand this people. It's not me just
[1:49:38] speaking. I'm telling you according to
[1:49:39] the word of God. When the leaders of a
[1:49:42] nation
[1:49:43] did a certain act, God considered the
[1:49:46] whole nation under that.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; When these men and to bow and to kneel,
[1:49:53] you look at what worship is in the
[1:49:55] scripture. If you kneel before
[1:49:57] something, you are worshiping that
[1:50:00] either that system, you are regarding
[1:50:02] that office, you are giving obesence to
[1:50:05] it. And and they might be there. You
[1:50:07] might say, "Well, it's just for
[1:50:08] political reasons." Ah,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; it's exactly right.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; This writer wrote into politics. He
[1:50:15] controls politics and he puts pressure
[1:50:18] on good men to do something that they
[1:50:20] wouldn't normally do.
[1:50:26] And he didn't merely shift
[1:50:30] from one horse to another, but he's rode
[1:50:33] right down into the end time.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, friends. He's right where
[1:50:42] you live.
[1:50:44] That's right.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And the only way, there's only one
[1:50:48] weapon
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; that is successful against him, and that
[1:50:52] is God's revealed word. There is no
[1:50:56] other weapon. You You don't have enough
[1:50:59] reserve within yourself. You don't have
[1:51:01] another resource. You don't have You
[1:51:04] could join institutions to no end. You
[1:51:06] could join churches to no end. A church
[1:51:08] will never save you. God sends his word
[1:51:11] in every given age and defeats the
[1:51:15] Antichrist. He's anti-word and he's
[1:51:18] against this message.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; He's against this message. And I tell
[1:51:22] you, it's it's not the drunk on the
[1:51:24] street or the prostitute in the red
[1:51:26] light district that happen to be against
[1:51:28] it. It's religious leaders.
[1:51:31] It threatens them. It threatens their
[1:51:33] position. It threatens whatever they
[1:51:36] stand for. Amen.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; I thank God for God's revealed word.
[1:51:43] Because of that,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; you can you have the option to be more
[1:51:48] than a conqueror.
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; God has given you that access
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; to be more than a conqueror.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And listen to me, friends, as I come to
[1:52:02] a close. I'm I'm far from being done,
[1:52:04] but I'm going to close early.
[1:52:08] Satan is not interested in simply uh
[1:52:11] having control of your environment. We
[1:52:13] could talk about politics or about about
[1:52:16] economics or about all of these things
[1:52:18] and you might say yay yay yay amen. I
[1:52:21] agree with that. That's not his purpose.
[1:52:24] His purpose is to use those various
[1:52:28] external things so as to cause the
[1:52:31] individual and this is a this is a whole
[1:52:34] myriad of of avenues and channels that
[1:52:38] he uses and it's hard in a very limited
[1:52:42] period of time of a Sunday morning
[1:52:44] service but you have to just examine
[1:52:46] your own your own area your own realm of
[1:52:50] life. Examine it, friends. Look at it.
[1:52:53] And I can tell you this writer,
[1:52:56] this writer that is this cunning, he has
[1:52:59] never lost any of his deception.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He has never lost hear it any of his
[1:53:06] cruelty.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; He has never lost any of the uh the
[1:53:12] blackness and the darkness that he want
[1:53:14] to stamp out the word during the dark
[1:53:17] ages. He's never lost that.
[1:53:20] And he's never lost being what he is,
[1:53:24] which is death.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; And in the last age, he's finally named.
[1:53:29] The rider is named death.
[1:53:34] A grizzled pale horse. I looked that up
[1:53:39] and it's really strange because the word
[1:53:43] that's used in the scripture actually
[1:53:46] refers to a blood disease.
[1:53:49] It's a a certain blood disease and I'll
[1:53:53] tell you the pale horse rider that is a
[1:53:56] that is a one thing that identifies
[1:54:01] and we have churches here in Canada that
[1:54:04] deny absolutely deny the blood of Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ. I say they are diseased people.
[1:54:11] Their system is diseased. They'll never
[1:54:14] come out of it. For it's by no other way
[1:54:17] than through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:19] And now remember the life the prophet
[1:54:22] said is in the blood
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; and the soul is the nature of the life.
[1:54:30] You and I that by virtue of the new
[1:54:34] birth and by the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:38] Spirit became we become filled and
[1:54:41] possessed with the very life of Jesus
[1:54:44] Christ. As brother Brandham says, if you
[1:54:47] had the life of Beethoven, if he had the
[1:54:49] life of Beethoven in him, he said he'd
[1:54:51] write music. If he had the life of
[1:54:54] Michelangelo in him, he would do great
[1:54:57] works of art.
[1:54:59] If he had the life of someone else, he
[1:55:01] would do their their he would act out
[1:55:04] their life. And if we have the life of
[1:55:07] Jesus Christ in us, what will we do? The
[1:55:10] works of Jesus Christ will live the life
[1:55:13] of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:16] And the revealed word,
[1:55:18] it is empowered.
[1:55:21] It is ordained.
[1:55:23] It is sent on a mission to go into the
[1:55:26] soul of the redeemed. to go into the
[1:55:29] soul of the predestinated and change
[1:55:32] them from the inside out.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Change the nature.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you might say, "I was born with
[1:55:40] that." I can tell you what, there's a
[1:55:42] second birth that's stronger than the
[1:55:44] first birth.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; I have a certain I have a certain uh uh
[1:55:49] heritage. I have a certain I came from a
[1:55:52] certain ethnic group. we are Irish or we
[1:55:55] are Ukrainian such as I am or we are
[1:55:58] German or we're British or we're
[1:56:00] whatever we are. I tell you we're born
[1:56:03] again
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; and it's not just a mere uh uh phrase.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. It's stronger. I
[1:56:14] want to announce to you, I don't care
[1:56:16] who you are, the message that I'm
[1:56:18] referring to. And the message that God
[1:56:20] has sent to us is more is stronger, more
[1:56:23] powerful than anything you were born
[1:56:26] with.
[1:56:28] And you need to accept that. You need to
[1:56:30] acknowledge that. Say, "Well, I was just
[1:56:33] born laxidasical." This will put
[1:56:35] something into you.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I was born with I couldn't really stand
[1:56:40] up. I don't have any. This will put
[1:56:42] steel in your backbone. This will make
[1:56:44] you a witness.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; This word of God will take uh Peter who
[1:56:50] who cursed and denied the Lord, turned
[1:56:54] him into the man who stood up on the day
[1:56:56] of Pentecost and said, "Hear my words."
[1:57:01] It turned the Apostle Paul, a man that
[1:57:04] was violent against the message of the
[1:57:07] hour, and he was taking people to death
[1:57:10] into prison and stood with the clothes
[1:57:12] of the clothing of Steven, the first
[1:57:15] martyr, at his feet, and watched him
[1:57:17] being stoned.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And he called himself a blasphemer.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; He called himself the greatest of
[1:57:25] sinners.
[1:57:27] And yet the grace of God was to him. He
[1:57:30] was ordained before the foundation of
[1:57:33] the world to write most of the New
[1:57:34] Testament.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; God used him.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; And even though he said he counted all
[1:57:40] that he knew as dong. Yeah.
[1:57:42] Nevertheless, God used that incredible
[1:57:44] intellect that he had, that incredible
[1:57:47] mental understanding of the Old
[1:57:48] Testament. And that's why he could read
[1:57:51] and write through the Hebrews and right
[1:57:52] through the other scriptures and just
[1:57:54] take a a certain quote out of Psalms and
[1:57:56] then one out of Genesis and then one out
[1:57:58] of Exodus. Just a line. How do they do
[1:58:01] that?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; By the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you may wonder how the
[1:58:08] prophet of God in this age can take just
[1:58:10] a scripture and and go and teach the
[1:58:13] rapture out of Psalms 27 because David
[1:58:17] was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write
[1:58:19] Psalms 27. In the time of trouble, he'll
[1:58:22] hide me in his pavilion. In the secret
[1:58:25] of his tabernacle, shall he hide me?
[1:58:28] Those words were inspired back then for
[1:58:30] you for this day.
[1:58:32] That's a rapture message. God's telling
[1:58:35] you through a prophet, you're going to
[1:58:36] change your residence. You're going to
[1:58:38] change where you live. You're going to
[1:58:40] change your body.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; What's going to change your body? There
[1:58:45] isn't anything down at Shoppers Drug or
[1:58:47] over at Hagens or any other place that
[1:58:49] can change your body. But the scripture,
[1:58:51] the word of God says, "We shall all be
[1:58:54] changed."
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; And that's enough. And then God sends a
[1:58:59] messenger in the end times says, "Now
[1:59:00] the time has arrived. the forerunner of
[1:59:04] the second coming of Jesus Christ. Now
[1:59:06] the time's arrived. And furthermore,
[1:59:08] he's going to pull off the cover off the
[1:59:11] antichrist and show you where he came
[1:59:13] in, where he started, where he changed
[1:59:16] his horse, where he changed his power,
[1:59:18] changed his method, and he showed how he
[1:59:20] did it
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; and took that bow that had no arrows. He
[1:59:26] couldn't slay anybody with it. He needed
[1:59:28] another power. And so he united. He
[1:59:30] married state to church. And now with
[1:59:32] the power of the state and the authority
[1:59:34] of the state, they could slay their
[1:59:36] enemies. And they did.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; 68 million.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, my dear friends, young
[1:59:44] and old alike, visitor
[1:59:47] alike,
[1:59:49] I can tell you that this rider, he's not
[1:59:51] quit his riding.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; He's not left riding. He's ridden right
[1:59:56] into your day. He's ridden right into
[1:59:58] your time. He's written right into your
[2:00:01] little area of involvement, whatever
[2:00:03] that might be. And he's out to take
[2:00:05] control of the soul of man. Somehow take
[2:00:09] control of it.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; This same scripture says, "Nay, in all
[2:00:14] these things, we are more than
[2:00:17] conquerors through him that loved us."
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; And today I can say we have one who
[2:00:24] loved us, not hated us, but loved us.
[2:00:32] Hallelujah.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; And he's given us I can say the bride of
[2:00:38] Jesus Christ is literally empowered.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm not here for my health. I'm not
[2:00:44] here because I I have a great thrill
[2:00:47] standing before a group of people.
[2:00:49] That's not why I stay in my study hour
[2:00:51] after hour and day after day and leave
[2:00:54] my my wife to live a lonely life, but to
[2:00:57] to obtain the truth of God's word as
[2:01:00] it's been delivered through a vindicated
[2:01:02] voice and bring it to the people. So you
[2:01:05] go out of here, you're equipped.
[2:01:08] [Applause]
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go out of here
[2:01:11] helpless or defenseless.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; You're equipped. You see things through
[2:01:16] different eyes. Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; He's been exposed.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's been uncovered.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; You see him all over. You see him
[2:01:36] everywhere in every every aspect of this
[2:01:39] civilization. You see him. But now we
[2:01:41] have different vision. We have different
[2:01:43] eyesight. We can identify him.
[2:01:48] Hallelujah.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why when you read the
[2:02:08] scripture,
[2:02:11] it seems like a puzzle, but it won't be
[2:02:13] a puzzle after you leave here today.
[2:02:15] Here he's riding white horse going out
[2:02:19] to conquer, conquering and to conquer.
[2:02:21] He's just got a bow. Hasn't even got a
[2:02:22] crown.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; But the apostle John under the
[2:02:26] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and says
[2:02:29] now and the second seal is opened. Here
[2:02:32] he comes. John, come and see. And he saw
[2:02:35] the rider and he's on a red horse. Now
[2:02:38] it's not a bow. It's a sword.
[2:02:43] Now something has happened in the real
[2:02:45] world and what happened was a hierarchy
[2:02:48] was structured to take control of the
[2:02:51] people. Nico conquer
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; leoty the people. Oh, aren't you
[2:02:58] thankful or rejoicing today that you're
[2:03:00] not under some hierarchy?
[2:03:06] I tell you, those of you that have come
[2:03:08] out of denominationalism, we're not
[2:03:10] against denominationalism as such. We're
[2:03:13] against what it does to the people.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; I've had all kinds of people want to
[2:03:19] shake off the shackles of some
[2:03:21] controlling system.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And I can speak about Catholicism
[2:03:26] because that's what we came out of.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; My father, he spent everything. He spent
[2:03:31] his inheritance, his entire inheritance
[2:03:35] to try to alert people and sent out
[2:03:38] tracks of converted nuns and converted
[2:03:40] priests. He spent out his his
[2:03:42] inheritance from his father. My
[2:03:45] grandfather, I never saw a penny of it.
[2:03:46] And I'm glad I never saw a penny of it.
[2:03:49] Let the tracks go out. Let the report go
[2:03:51] out. Let the testimony go out.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; How they were converted and how they
[2:03:55] were born again.
[2:03:58] I tell you what, friends,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I have something to say. I have an
[2:04:02] experience that I've experienced. My
[2:04:04] mother and father are on the verge of
[2:04:06] divorce because my mother was so staunch
[2:04:09] in the faith. My daddy, he went upstairs
[2:04:13] into the attic in our little humble
[2:04:14] clapboard house. And for five weeks, he
[2:04:17] prayed till the we hours of the morning
[2:04:20] until one day my mother was gloriously
[2:04:24] saved.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What freed her from the
[2:04:28] shackles of that church?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And many others are the same. What do
[2:04:34] they hold? They hold the minds of the
[2:04:36] people. And they've got a priesthood and
[2:04:38] a hierarchy that indoctrinates the
[2:04:40] people and captures their mind and their
[2:04:43] thinking. And they can't shake those
[2:04:46] shackles.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; But we are more than conquerors through
[2:04:51] Christ Jesus who freed us and set us
[2:04:54] free.
[2:05:01] Hallelujah.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I hesitate to mention things,
[2:05:10] but I can tell you just after brother
[2:05:12] Mike Hunt had met God in the basement of
[2:05:16] his mother and dad's home, who were not
[2:05:18] religious people, but he fell on his
[2:05:21] face. a man who had just been a garbage
[2:05:24] collector in the city of Vancouver, but
[2:05:27] Bibles begin to fall out of the garbage
[2:05:29] cans and he'd stuff them in his shirt
[2:05:31] and put them put them up on a on a
[2:05:35] mantle of the shelf when he got home and
[2:05:37] he saw a little tract one day and the
[2:05:40] little track just showed three stick men
[2:05:42] going up to Calvary where there was
[2:05:44] three crosses. He didn't know nothing.
[2:05:46] He was 26 years old, had never been in
[2:05:48] the church in his life. He saw these
[2:05:50] three little stick men on I'm sorry a
[2:05:53] little stick drawing of a man going with
[2:05:55] a huge packsack on a weight on his back
[2:05:57] up to with the three crosses on Calvary
[2:06:00] and on the other side the packsack had
[2:06:03] fallen off and was rolling rolling like
[2:06:05] that and he was running with his arms
[2:06:07] screaming
[2:06:09] thanksgiving and glory to God and he
[2:06:12] knows nothing. He just looked that
[2:06:13] little we simple drawing he says
[2:06:14] whatever happened to him is what I need.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:18] whatever happened to him, I need to meet
[2:06:19] that God."
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And I don't know how soon it was after
[2:06:23] that. And he fell on his face. He
[2:06:26] doesn't remember how long he was there.
[2:06:28] His eyes were swelled shut from weeping
[2:06:32] and repenting over his sin. And he cried
[2:06:35] out. He said, "Oh Jesus, I never knew
[2:06:38] you were down here."
[2:06:41] And three weeks later, the same one that
[2:06:44] ever spoke to him said, "You must go out
[2:06:46] now and find others like yourself." And
[2:06:49] he walked down the street and the first
[2:06:52] he saw a sign down there where the cross
[2:06:54] says, "Jesus saves." He thought, "That
[2:06:56] looks good." He walked down there, there
[2:06:58] was some special meetings taking place
[2:07:01] in a big Pentecostal church. And he
[2:07:03] opened the door to come in. A man met
[2:07:05] him, a deacon. says, "Do you have the
[2:07:07] Holy Ghost?"
[2:07:11] Mike says, "I I don't know." "Well, have
[2:07:13] you ever spoke in tongues?"
[2:07:16] "No, sir." Said, "Don't believe I have."
[2:07:18] He says, "You haven't got it."
[2:07:20] Mike said, "The only witness he had in
[2:07:23] his heart is that this man didn't have
[2:07:25] what he had."
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; And he walked in there and there was a
[2:07:30] little evangelist from Scotland
[2:07:32] preaching and casting out devils. And he
[2:07:35] he found out later that man had been in
[2:07:37] brother Brandham's meetings and had
[2:07:39] nothing but good to say. I tell you
[2:07:41] what, he had a fire lit from someplace.
[2:07:43] But what am I saying?
[2:07:46] There were shackles ready already to
[2:07:49] take a doctrine and tell a man, you
[2:07:51] haven't got it
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; when he knew he did have it. He knew the
[2:07:54] God he had met. You understand what I
[2:07:56] mean? There's a doctrine and there's
[2:07:58] deeds and then there's a doctrine to
[2:08:00] control and a and a group of um uh uh a
[2:08:04] teachers, a priesthood to teach the
[2:08:06] doctrine to gain the power of the man.
[2:08:08] And listen,
[2:08:11] and I close with this, when it's anti-
[2:08:15] word,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; it's anti- Christ.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[2:08:29] That's why the message came.
[2:08:32] That's why God sent the messenger that
[2:08:34] you have received. Sent it so that you
[2:08:36] would not be conquered. But in fact, you
[2:08:39] would conquer that.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether he's got a bow. I
[2:08:43] don't care whether he has arrows. I
[2:08:44] don't care whether he has a sword. I
[2:08:46] don't care what he is intent to do. He's
[2:08:47] gone out to kill. He's gone out to
[2:08:49] destroy. The power of God in the living
[2:08:53] church is greater than any power that's
[2:08:55] been sent on by the Antichrist spirit.
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; We have one that represents us
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; before the throne of God.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; The living word of God made flesh.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] Let's bow our heads. Oh heavenly father,
[2:09:19] somehow there's a a sense of gratitude
[2:09:22] within us. We don't know exactly how to
[2:09:25] express it, but I pray that you will
[2:09:28] take those things that you would have
[2:09:33] made real to the people.
[2:09:36] Now Lord, I ask that you'll send the
[2:09:38] Holy Spirit
[2:09:39] and your presence to make it real.
[2:09:43] It can only come by a divine revelation
[2:09:48] and let the Holy Spirit utter to the
[2:09:50] inner man and witness the truth and what
[2:09:54] is truth in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:09:57] that he al he alone will be glorified.
[2:10:00] Amen.
[2:10:05] I want to
[2:10:08] perhaps just have you stand if you would
[2:10:11] and I'd like to sing
[2:10:14] the anchor holds.
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:23] Maybe you'd help me, brother Rod. Would
[2:10:25] you please?

[2:13:18] through the storms of my life.
[2:13:22] Oh, that's where God
[2:13:26] proved his love to me.

[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a couple of verses too
[2:14:19] of the old hymn
[2:14:22] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[2:14:26] Time is filled with swift transition.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; That means we may not meet like this.
[2:14:34] Just think of it. Somebody here,
[2:14:37] good possibility, won't be here at the
[2:14:39] next meeting. We don't know. We have no
[2:14:41] guarantee of it whatsoever.
[2:14:46] I'd like to encourage you from the
[2:14:49] depths of my heart to hold to God's
[2:14:52] unchanging hand. And remember, his hand
[2:14:55] is nothing less than the word of God.
[2:15:00] Heavens and earth shall pass away, but
[2:15:02] my word shall never pass away.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; You've been married and united to
[2:15:13] Christ.
[2:15:17] Glory to God.
[2:15:23] I

[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:41] something
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:47] to God's unchanging hand.
[2:15:52] You come to
[2:15:55] God's unchanging hand.

[2:16:44] still
[2:16:54] changing.
[2:16:57] You got to
[2:17:00] go change
[2:17:04] [Applause]
[2:17:04] [Music]
[2:17:07] your dream.
[2:17:13] Oh
[2:17:15] God's unchanging hand
[2:17:19] first and
[2:17:21] your journey is completed
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:28] to God. You have been
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:36] your holy glory.
[2:17:41] Glorious
[2:17:44] soul.
[2:17:47] You got

[2:17:54] All saints just
[2:17:57] unchanging
[2:18:01] [Music]
[2:18:04] something
[2:18:10] to God's unchanging hand.
[2:18:15] As we sing the chorus once more, brother
[2:18:17] John Andy's would you please come and
[2:18:20] dismiss this body of people in prayer.
[2:18:22] ask God's blessings upon them. I'd like
[2:18:24] to say thank you for your time. Thank
[2:18:27] you for your
[2:18:29] real keen attention and attendance.
[2:18:33] Thank you for your prayers.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; If you would keep praying for us.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; These are weighty matters that we're
[2:18:40] dealing with. And I'm very conscious
[2:18:44] at this time.
[2:18:46] I'm very very conscious almost daily
[2:18:50] that I have to stand and give an account
[2:18:52] for what is being said and preached.
[2:18:55] And I tell you every once in a while I I
[2:18:58] just would shudder at the very thought
[2:19:01] of misleading someone.
[2:19:04] It's a solemn serious responsibility.
[2:19:09] So I pray that God will guide you in
[2:19:11] your prayers and guide us in the word.
[2:19:14] We have a great message and it's hard to
[2:19:16] get it out sometime just
[2:19:20] because of its magnitude. But you pray
[2:19:23] that God will help us to take it and
[2:19:26] distill it and break it down to the
[2:19:28] people. Brother John
[2:19:31] chorus again. Oh, to God's unchanging
[2:19:36] hand
[2:19:41] to God changing.
[2:20:00] Amen.
[2:20:03] Lord Jesus, we want to praise you this
[2:20:05] afternoon.
[2:20:06] We want to thank you for riding out and
[2:20:09] delivering our souls that were in
[2:20:11] bondage.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; You've taken off the veil of deception.
[2:20:16] You've given us a clean heart and a new
[2:20:18] mind and a soul that would receive your
[2:20:21] word.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you for salvation.
[2:20:24] Thank you for revelation.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the truth. Thank you for
[2:20:29] the Holy Spirit this morning that in the
[2:20:32] service pulsating with every word, every
[2:20:34] line. We come to the close of this
[2:20:37] service, we have one desire that you
[2:20:40] would totally possess our beings. That
[2:20:43] we as your people that there would be no
[2:20:46] room for darkness, no room for
[2:20:48] ourselves. We die to ourselves. We yield
[2:20:52] to the Holy Spirit. We say yes with one
[2:20:56] mind and one accord with what your word
[2:20:58] is speaking to us and let it have its
[2:21:01] full effect in our lives. We pray at the
[2:21:05] close of this service. We say, Lord
[2:21:07] Jesus, come within our individual lives
[2:21:11] and burst through us, your desires and
[2:21:14] your will and what you have in your
[2:21:16] heart toward us and what you want to
[2:21:19] accomplish at this closing moments of
[2:21:22] time in your elected lady, your bride.
[2:21:25] Let there be such a pulsation of faith
[2:21:28] within our hearts that all things are
[2:21:31] possible for us as believers that when
[2:21:34] we pray, it is with faith. It is
[2:21:37] effectual. It is moving. It is the
[2:21:39] heartbeat of God. It is the desire for
[2:21:43] us at this end time. And Lord, we just
[2:21:45] embrace your word this morning. It has
[2:21:48] set our hearts free. We give it first
[2:21:51] place. Let us not be a lazy nonchalant
[2:21:55] people that take these things for
[2:21:57] granted. But Lord, you have opened our
[2:22:00] eyes and our ears ears for a purpose.
[2:22:03] And that that is that we would be the
[2:22:05] final voice to the final age. So let us
[2:22:09] not be consumed with ourselves or with
[2:22:12] le oysia but let us surrender our lives
[2:22:15] so that you could move through us so
[2:22:18] that you could heal through us so that
[2:22:20] you can deliver and fill our lives so
[2:22:24] that others around us could sense that
[2:22:26] we have been with Jesus.
[2:22:30] We love you this morning Lord. This is
[2:22:32] our life. And this afternoon, our
[2:22:35] brother Tom. Lord, it's more than men
[2:22:39] and our pastor is more than a man. It's
[2:22:42] a gift of God that we long to touch your
[2:22:46] hymn of the garment, your garment. Lord,
[2:22:49] even yesterday in a room just weeping
[2:22:52] ourselves, just weeping, Lord, wanting
[2:22:55] to see you greater in the midst of your
[2:22:57] people, wanting a Holy Spirit revival in
[2:23:01] the word to break out as I believe you
[2:23:04] are. But Lord, help us as your children
[2:23:06] to understand the pulsations of the
[2:23:09] spirit in every level, in every way, and
[2:23:13] what you're doing in our lives to bring
[2:23:15] us to perfection. So Lord Jesus, let our
[2:23:19] brother Tom be such a vessel that would
[2:23:22] get out of the way. It is for your sake
[2:23:25] that we ask these things that Lord our
[2:23:28] lives as your people would become the
[2:23:30] masterpiece that your word has spoken.
[2:23:33] we are. So this afternoon, help us as
[2:23:37] your people to quieten ourselves to lay
[2:23:40] before you, Lord, not to just eat
[2:23:43] natural things and speak about natural
[2:23:45] events, but to prepare ourselves for
[2:23:48] what you're doing in the word that is so
[2:23:50] great and so wonderful more than our
[2:23:53] jobs, more than our natural food, more
[2:23:56] than our schooling, more than what we do
[2:23:58] naturally. The spiritual bread is the
[2:24:01] most important. That when we come this
[2:24:03] afternoon that we would be ready and
[2:24:05] primed. That we would be inspired
[2:24:08] already. That your spirit could move
[2:24:11] mightily among us, Lord. And that we
[2:24:13] would be seeing spiritual signs and
[2:24:16] wonders, and that our souls would feed
[2:24:18] at a table that's been spread out before
[2:24:21] us, Lord. We love your appearing and we
[2:24:25] love life and we love healing and we
[2:24:28] love marriages that are being brought
[2:24:30] back and families that are being mended,
[2:24:33] cancers that are leaving, spiritual life
[2:24:35] that is happening while we yet hear the
[2:24:38] word. The Holy Spirit is doing
[2:24:40] supernatural things and we honor that
[2:24:43] and we revere that and we esteem that to
[2:24:46] the highest place. So we bless you this
[2:24:48] afternoon
[2:24:50] and we thank you for the service. May it
[2:24:53] continue in our lives. We pray and touch
[2:24:57] those that need a touch continually,
[2:24:59] Lord. And even leaving the service and
[2:25:01] they'll be leaving the internet and
[2:25:02] they'll be going into their back to
[2:25:04] their schedule and their lives. But I
[2:25:06] pray that the dynamo of what you're
[2:25:08] doing in our souls would continue and
[2:25:11] only get greater. We pray. Thank you for
[2:25:14] this time of oasis, a time that we can
[2:25:17] hear your voice speaking so many voices,
[2:25:20] but we have heard the voice of God today
[2:25:23] and the atmosphere that our brother Rod
[2:25:25] and the musicians and others labor to
[2:25:27] create for us. We accept that as your
[2:25:30] divine presence for us and we are
[2:25:33] healed. We are encouraged. We are
[2:25:35] embedded Lord in our spiritual lives.
[2:25:38] Thank you Lord. Bless your people in
[2:25:42] Jesus name.
[2:25:44] Amen.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're dismissing you in the
[2:25:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I'll
[2:25:52] say to you as you're going,
[2:25:55] uh, I've I've had I've had a lot of
[2:25:58] conversations with this one that I was
[2:26:00] preaching about today. And I kind of
[2:26:02] know what he says. He'll say, "You can't
[2:26:04] change.
[2:26:07] You're going to be the same."
[2:26:10] And I'll tell you what
[2:26:14] this says, tell him he's a liar.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; And if you're prepared to do that,
[2:26:19] you're in for a good time.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Those of you that live on this side of
[2:26:23] the border and you see families and
[2:26:25] those on other side to prevent them or
[2:26:30] to make room so they don't have to go
[2:26:32] back and forth across the border for the
[2:26:34] evening service. If you can open your
[2:26:35] home or take them out for lunch or
[2:26:39] do that, that would just be great.
[2:26:41] That'd be wonderful. I dismiss you in
[2:26:42] Jesus name. Thank you. You're dismissed.
