Description:
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
notice another thing I just like to say amongst Pentecostal people there's one thing that we're forgetting friends is our Pentecostal courtesy see parking in Lots sometimes I've noticed our Pentecostal Brethren when you could really pull and give somebody else a chance to park for the side of you just drive in any way call somebody that really makes a what we call a boo boo on the road you fly loose and tear down listen that's not the way of be a Pentecostal Christian let's consider the next one if he's wrong let him be wrong if you patter aing then you're wrong let's think of the other and just try to do right and think right I've got a slogan do right it's your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself and you've got to come out right and if you'll try to practice the right thing see it'll grow around you just like a Vine it'll hug you into it and if you can't love your enemy just as much as you love those who love you there's something wrong somewhere
