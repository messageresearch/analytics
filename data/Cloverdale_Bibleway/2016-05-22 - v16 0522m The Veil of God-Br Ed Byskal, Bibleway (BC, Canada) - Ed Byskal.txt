Jesus called 70, the ministerial association, and they didn't catch it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were called. They were selected. &gt;&gt; They didn't catch it. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be catching it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a praise offering this morning. Hallelujah. We don't want to be bystanders. We don't want to be just in the room. We want to be participants what the Lord has this morning. Amen. Could you just play my faith looks up to thee, thou lamb of Calvary. We just want to go to a prayer this morning. Remember an unspoken request for two loved ones facing a very very critical situation in their life. This is from the Rid Path family. We ask the Lord to intervene and bring complete and total healing. Amen. Also want to remember to uh this is from brother Victor Adamora. His brother has prostate condition and is being considered for surgery by Friday. Just asking that the Lord would direct the hands of the doctor for successful surgery. Why don't we just all bow our hearts and heads this morning? We'll just pray together and ask the deacons to come. Appreciate that, brothers. Let's just pray together. Father, we want to commit this entire day to you. Many have set aside time, Lord, to listen to the sound of the prophet's voice. The seventh angel that you sent in our day. &gt;&gt; For you, Lord, according to your own word said, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet. Lord, we received your word in our day. We want to give you thanks this morning, Lord, for giving us a seed, Lord, an incorruptible seed that could be birthed under the light of this message within each and every one of our lives. We're so truly thankful, oh God. This morning, we bring the needs and petitions of the congregation before you, Lord, asking that you would move on their behalf. This one with a prostate cancer, oh God, prostate condition. Lord, you know exactly what the need is there. Lord, if it would go to surgery, we pray that you would guide the hand of the physician that you have given a gift and a talent to. Lord, would you guide his hand? Lord, if you would see fit to even bring about a change in that prostate condition so that it wouldn't have to go that way, Lord, we would return and give you the praise. We return and give you the glory, Lord. We'd say one more time, you came upon the scene just in the last moments when all things seemed impossible. Lord, we're believers this morning. &gt;&gt; We believe in the impossible. &gt;&gt; We believe in those things we have not seen. What our eyes have not laid upon yet. We believe according to your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, drop faith in the hearts of the believer this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, may we reach out, take a hold to the promise of God. We want to remember brother Tom Ray this morning, &gt;&gt; Lord. No doubt streaming in this morning. Just thinking about him earlier this morning. Lord, how he would desire &gt;&gt; to sit in the congregation of the people [Music] &gt;&gt; be his portion this morning. Oh God, may there be such a presence in that room. &gt;&gt; Lord, may your love envelop him and bring healing. Oh God, you paid the price. Lord, we just ask Lord that it would be ministered &gt;&gt; into his body this morning. I want to remember brother John Andy's be traveling to Seattle this afternoon. Brother Kyle and Victoria, Lord, your many membered body needs to be ministered to this morning. We have needs in our own midst. Oh God, Lord, you've chosen a vessel, our pastor, brother Ed Biscll, Lord, to speak through this morning to our needs, Lord, to our hearts. We pray that you would open the eyes of our hearts. Lord, &gt;&gt; let us see you moving amongst your people. &gt;&gt; We'll be sure to give you the praise and the honor and the glory. As the deacons take up the offering, bless them, Lord. Bless the offering that's given. Each and everyone that can give and contribute. We ask that you would bless them abundantly. We give you thanks in all things this morning in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. As the deacons receive the offering, why don't you have your seats together this morning, we've got a special. So, just as the deacons are done receiving the offering, if those that are singing could come and get ready. God bless you. That would be fine. We've got uh Brother Andrew Payne is going to be singing with a group from uh down Dallas Fort Worth area. So, we're just real happy to have him here this morning. So, he's going to be singing for us. Brother Mike G'd really like to uh welcome his sister and brother-in-law. Where are they at this morning? Right next to you. Why don't you stand? We'll greet you this morning. God bless you. Come on. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen. May the Lord grant you the very desire of your heart this morning. Amen. That would be our prayer for you today. Amen. The Lord knows exactly what we need, doesn't he? Amen. Why don't we sing I've got the life of God in me. I've got the life of God in me. If we can just have the group that's going to be singing with Brother Andrew come up and get ready. We'll just sing a chorus and then I'll sit down and let them really do some singing. Looking forward to it. I've got the life of God in me. I've got the life of God. He's in me. I've got his life, his nature, and his ability. I've got the life of God in me.

I've got the life of God in me. I've got his life, his picture, and his ability. I've got his life of God with me. Amen. [Music] How did I [Music] Where do I turn to now? [Music] How did this happen? How do good intentions always somehow fail? I feel lost inside [Music] Satan's prison bars. ashamed of choicees I have made. The guilt is al so heavy. Regret is all I see. But that's when I hear his voice to me. [Music] You've been made to coner. You've been made to stand. [Music] A spotless bride that's covered [Music] by the blood of the lamb. [Music] So why do you stay there? Don't you know who you are? Don't you know where you come from? Well, I know you've fallen far, but that doesn't change who you are. Rise of my chosen one. You've been made to coner. [Applause] You've been made to stand. A spotless ride that's covered [Applause] [Music] by the blood of the lamb.

A spotless bride that's covered by the blood of the lamb. By the blood of the l Yeah. [Music] [Applause] Amen. We stand together as the last few ones are coming in. We'll turn the service right to our pastor this morning and give him plenty of time. We have all day, &gt;&gt; but we are still trapped in this time element. The body gets weary, so we want to catch him while he's fresh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing together uh open my eyes that I may see 494 on the screen. Want to remember the baptismal service just after the morning service. So, uh we've got a several that are be getting baptized. Brother Murphy is going to be taking the baptismal service of the Lord has been really dealing with you and today is just your day. &gt;&gt; He does that. He did that for me. I could not get away from it. Today is the day, not tomorrow. What if the rapture happened tonight? I'd miss it. That's not really the case. But that's how I felt. I mean, it was an urgent matter. It had to be dealt with. So, if that's where you're at today, good news. &gt;&gt; The pool is open. Amen. You don't have to catch me in the back. There's ministers here. There's deacons happy to talk to you. Amen. Let's just sing this together as we focus our hearts upon the Lord Jesus just now. Open my eyes that I may see glimpses of truth thou has for me. Place in my hands the wonderful key that shall unclass and set me free. Silently now I wait for thee. Ready my God, thy will to see. Open my eyes to the spirit [Music] divine. Open my ears that I may hear. Voices of truth. Thou send is clear. And while no fall on my ear, everything falls will disappear. [Music] Silently now I wait for thee. Ready my God, thy will to see. Open my eyes to me. Spirit [Music] divine. Open my mouth and let me bear glad thee the one through everywhere. [Music] Open my heart and let me prepare with my children to share the I wait for thee. Ready my God I will to see. Open my eyes to me. [Music] for me. My God, I will see. Open my eyes. [Applause] Let's just sing that chorus once more. Silente I will to see. Open my eyes. [Music] Open my eyes to you and me [Music] once more. Open my eyes. [Music] Heavenly Father, this is not only our prayer. This is our desire. This is our hunger. This is what we're thirsting after. So we ask that you will open our eyes, open our ears, and open our mouth that we might praise you in spirit and in truth. Father, I pray that our hearts will be blended with the Holy Spirit and it'll become one. Oh cad, reveal yourself to us. Speak to us, we pray. And now, Lord Jesus, we want you to be glorified in our service today. We're gathered here, Lord, at a time of prayer. We're asking, Father, that you will bless in the service in Victoria. Our brother Kyle Morton and Sister Christina there there and all the saints that are gathered. Bless them. those that will be gathered in Reton and our brother John Andy's down there going down. We pray that you'll bless them, oh Father, all that gather, Father, the bride of Jesus Christ. We do not know them all, but you know everyone. You said they are yours and you must gather them. We pray that you will bless, oh God, the gathering of the bride of Christ around the world in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Let's just have you have your seats for just a moment. I have a couple of uh announcements we'd like to make before we go any further. Nice to see you all here. And I want to thank those of you that had opportunity to uh give yourself to the message uh unveiling of God. That will help us this morning. But I want to mention the family camp that's uh going to be taking place in July. Uh it'll family camp 2016 will be July the 25th to the 31st. And the junior camp will start on Monday the 25th. Uh and then and then the camp speaker is going to be brother Danny Stemon. He's a pastor there in what? and Sarasota, Florida. Exactly. Right. And brother Danny has been here before. Uh so we certainly have enjoyed his ministry, also his father's ministry. I really loved his father and uh he was he was just such an original. You know, we're all originals, but every once in a while you run into one, and it seems that God just took the pattern and threw it someplace into into the universe. And his father was the just like that, brother Johnny Steman. And now, Brother Danny Steman, so glad and nice to see his son stepping up, taking the church and and giving it leadership. this e this afternoon. Uh I say afternoon, it'll be afternoon by the time we get to it. But after this morning's service will be the baptism. We're having a baptism at Sister Kora. Uh Sister Cora, would you like to stand there? God bless you, Sister Cora. Thank you. Thank you. You may be seated. And brother Ryan. Where's Brother Ryan? above. All right. [Applause] So, we have two baptisms uh after the service, after the preaching of the word, and brother Murphy will be doing the baptizing. Brother John and he have met together and uh have had further counseling and so on. And sister Kora is related to Sister Juniper. Uh I believe Anise by marriage are all right. God bless you. So also I want to mention this is the latest faith challenge report. &gt;&gt; You haven't received it yet, you can get your copy. Is that it? &gt;&gt; They're in the foyer now. Uh once you get it, you will you'll just want to read all of it and get it and take one if you have someone that you're going to send it to. uh brother brother Tim and uh has done an a wonderful job in inside is it's uh the details of Ethiopia and uh the Chinese Bible uh I had to smile in fact is I had to actually more than smile I I told brother Murphy that I had to actually laugh out loud at at some of the comments about the Bible because I had asked him to get to get the comments from Chinese believers and uh one brother Lou he said uh when I compared the Chinese King James version in Union that's the Union Bible the one they had uh he said I found there's a strange spirit in the Union Bible because of many important verses I thought that is really wonderful. He said, "Especially when I read many of the verses translated exactly as the prophet has said in the message, my heart became so excited like in the book of Ezekiel 8 and2." The Union Bible said as the color of gold, but the King James uh Chinese King James version translated literally the color of amber. And that's exactly what the prophet described. Oh, praise the Lord. Uh this brother Lou I'm sorry he said when I compared King James version to Union I found there's a strange spirit in the Union Bible because many many uh many important verses are not translated exactly as the original said such as in the New Testament Romans 16 and1 and 1 Timothy 3 and 11 the Union Bible translated woman deacon but this is absolutely contrary to Paul's with Paul's teaching. When I looked in the King James, Chinese King James version, sure enough, it said a servant of of the church as Romans and their wives, First Timothy. No wonder many churches today are many churches today use these verses to ordain women pastors and women deacons. All these wrongly translated verses leads me to think it is there is a strange spirit purposely trying to hide something from the true believers. So you can imagine how how the practice how the practice of the church ends up completely contrary to the word of God uh because they just extend something and uh it was like uh like a Jehovah's Witness lady and nothing wrong with Jehovah's Witness. I just happened they happened to come to my door. So, it's them coming to me, not me coming to them and uh were wanting to inform me about something. And I said, "Well, that's fine. I just don't have time. I'm in the middle of studying. I'm actually studying. You interrupted my studies because I'm getting ready to preach." Oh, she said, "I'm a preacher, too." I said, "Well, that's against the word of God." Well, well, she said Deborah was a prophetist, but I said, but Jesus chose chose disciples and none of them were women and they weren't to carry the seed. That's all. It's just that simple. Anyway, they decided that they were needed to be on their way right away. So my wife didn't have time either once when a couple had come and and uh so she said she she just thought she'll just start right at the right at the very basic and she says, "Well, did you know that uh Cain was the son of the serpent?" And they said, "Oh, there's no hope for you. They just walked away." So if you ever need an answer, there you have one. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; All right, I'll have you stand and we're going to turn to John the 14th chapter. It's always good when you read the scripture. Uh John 14 is the chapter uh that the text was taken from for things that are to be. That's the third last service preached. And this uh at least my Scoffield Bible says that John 14:1, let your let not your heart be troubled was spoken in the Passover chamber and Jesus foretells his his coming for his own in John 14. He's just getting ready to leave. So it's spoken in the Passover chamber and it's the and and brother Brandham at the very end of his this is at the very end of Jesus Christ the son of man that's very end of his ministry and he's going to John 14. I somehow believe in my own heart. It's not doctrine, but I believe in my own heart that Jesus knew when he would come back to reveal himself in a redeemed son that he'd be choosing the same chapter just before he left. &gt;&gt; Something to think about, isn't it? &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to start to read at verse eight, please. Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the father, and it sufficeth us or satisfies us. Jesus sth unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Phillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father? And how sayest thou then, show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus almost here makes a uh he himself and the father and the words that he speaks which are the father's words almost synonymous with each other. It's me, the father that's in me and the words I speak. They're all three synonymous. And then when we come down to John 14, the 19th verse, just look at the 19th verse. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but you see me. Because I live, you shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you. So now it is almost appears uh uh just depended on how you can perceive it that you as an individual have become synonymous. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't mean equal to but synonymous with Christ the father the word that's in the father. So this you Christ the father and the words of God are to be merged into a single unit. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; We pray the Lord will bless us as you have your seats. So when I read uh John 8 uh 14:8-10, I just want to lay a little quick foundation here. Uh Jesus words had advanced beyond parables. Now &gt;&gt; when he said, "Have I been so long time with you, &gt;&gt; John?" or rather Philillip. And hast thou not known me? &gt;&gt; Uh, he that hath known me, you've not known the father. But if thou hast not known me, Philillip, he that hath seen me hath seen the father. And how sayest thou show us the father? Now, here's here's not a Philillip is not some lightweight. &gt;&gt; Uh Philip's a firm disciple of the Lord Jesus. Show us the father. And and there was something there was something in the last later words of Jesus that it it had advanced. So I want to say that the message of Jesus had advanced very much from parables &gt;&gt; to something that was very uh very heavy &gt;&gt; and very much meat I would say for the believers. He wasn't saying it to everyone but he was saying it to Philillip. Philip wanted to know something specific &gt;&gt; and so now it was not a parable any longer. I want to say that the message has advanced &gt;&gt; and when you were reading and you that were reading and have listened to and have uh some have listened to it several times I trust you had opportunity the unveiling of God. I have been in it. In fact is there's the last few pages I still need to read because I have been so slow. I've been reading it for maybe two weeks uh and many more times before that because there are areas in uh in that message. It's not it's not one of the lighter brother Brandon would say for example now we're just going to go down at this church and in honor of another man's pulpit we're going to have like an evangelistic service and we'll have a prayer line. The prayer line's not a lightweight thing, but and the unveiling and the revealing of the heart. None of those things are but the message really advanced al from a first pole ministry to a second pole to a third pole which he said was the opening of the word. And so the opening of the word requires something more of us. &gt;&gt; It requires a intensity. It it requires a hunger. It requires a sincerity. I believe it requires a uh just us to be sanctified to the word and to give ourselves to it. say that's why we're singing open our my eyes that I may see in the message uh show us the father in early message brother Brandham spoke it several times but he in early message he said every man since the dawn of time has longed to see God &gt;&gt; uh want to look at him. Job one time said, "Oh, if I only knew where he was." In other words, if I knew where to go and knock on his door and he'd open up the door and I'd come in and sat down and talk with him. He said, "That's the way people want to see God." And yet God was so close to Job till he was speaking to him. And in in Job 23, it actually says, "Oh," and this is the scripture Brother Brand's referring to, "Oh, that I knew where I might find him." Job said, uh, "And I might come even to his seat. I would order my cause before him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments. I would know, not to argue with God, but I would fill them with words. I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me. &gt;&gt; That was his hunger. &gt;&gt; Just imagine what Job had been through. And then but this is what he's this is essentially what he's craving in another place and show show us the father. He said show us the father and it will suffice. Now that has been the human heart's desire since the world began. if they could only see God. And and he refers to Job once again. And and these are two different two different messages. God made man, all of us, man, woman, young people, children, even children. God made us to thirst. God actually constructed us to thirst after him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's an important statement because I'm going to be taking a turn, a very important turn here in a few moments. Satan, this the Bible says that this present evil world, the prophet says this is Satan's Eden. And Satan has taken, this is where I'll be going in a few moments. Satan has taken all the things of God's original creation. I was reading about uh predestination because perhaps I might touch on that. But do you know that even the metals in the earth listen now the metals in the earth just the whether it be iron or gold or silver whatever more they're all predestinated. You can't take You can't take silver ore and make it something else. &gt;&gt; It's silver. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. And gold is gold &gt;&gt; and iron is iron and 10 is tin and copper is copper. It's predestinated to be that way. And that happens to be what you are. You're predestinated. There might be one ore that has more to overload or overburden to grind off, but it'll come out the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could preach on that, but I'm just I'm just laying that as a foundation. &gt;&gt; So, God was so close to Job, but he didn't know it. God was close to another couple men uh centuries later, which were two men on the way to Emmas. But they didn't know that someone was with them. Uh that understood are you a stranger here in Jerusalem and you don't know all the things that have happened and here they're talking to the very one that had happened to but he he had changed form and so he was veiled from them. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about I want to speak to you on this subject, the veil of God. &gt;&gt; And uh the unveiling of God is the uncovering. Brother Brandham did not speak on the veil of God. He spoke on the unveiling of God. The scripture two men on the way to Emmas no doubt had heard Jesus say a little while and you shall see me again and again. A little while and you shall uh and you shall see me. He said first I'm sorry. A little while and you shall not see me. And again, a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father. I'm just having a little difficulty because we've got some shadows down here on the pulpit. Yet he came so near, but they were unaware of him because he was veiled in another form. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He was the same person. And it was Jesus Christ. But he was veiled in another form. He had passed from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you that are awaiting the change and I trust you all are. &gt;&gt; Brother John Andy's was praying in the study and he not I noticed that he's praying that we are the people of the change and we're looking for the change and we are indeed looking for the change. But now I want you to bear in mind that we're also looking to a God. We're we're we're we're in a message called the unveiling of God. Why is it unveiling? Because there's there's something of a change taking place. And I want you to think about that. And joy did not come to these two that were walking with Jesus until they recognized who he was. &gt;&gt; And I really think that we've advanced in the message from parables and maybe uh evangelistic type of services and fundamentals of the gospel. Uh we still need those. You always need the fundamentals, but we well I I trust that you'll move a little beyond that to this. We're we're we're talking about children of the rapture, people of the change. And and it's essential that you all recognize that in this message is actually pregnantated, this message is pregnantated with the power to change. Now, some of you young people are going to be graduating and and some of you have graduated and some of you will be graduating this year and perhaps going on to further education. Why do you go on to further education? Well, I don't know anything about accounting, but I hope after 3 four years that I'll I'll know something about it. Oh, you actually are expecting the words of some book to change you from someone who knows nothing about it to somebody who's a a tax expert or an accounting expert or you can audit books and all that. It's just the words &gt;&gt; in certain books that will transform you from what you are to a mechanic or to a farmer or to know something about something you don't know anything about today. You see some young fellow, you know, some of you young fellas here and think uh that I might commit myself to you for brain surgery. Well, not quite yet. You're going to have to be transformed by something. Something's going to have to happen or you might not know what to do with the scalpel. And I don't want to commit myself to you. I can tell you, brother Tom Ray right now, he's he's listening to me. He he committed himself to the finest that is in in Canada as far as we know. And he was a student of Dr. uh Hansen in uh in Seattle. And Dr. Hansen, I think, is probably one of the finest in the world. And there's a wing of the hospital down there in Seattle that's called after Dr. Hansen. And Dr. Hansen always seemed to just be something very, very special. Joanne spent I think weeks probably looking for a doctor anywhere in the world because they did not have and this would be a news to some of you but I won't take any time with it except to say uh we we we had artificial hip joints artificial knee joints but did not have artificial ankle joints. The ankle is a very very complicated multiple multiplicity of of bones and so on all together and balancing each way etc. And I understand that a man in either South Dakota or North Dakota actually invented it and it was it's been a kind of recent the uh the reason why to brother Tom Ray had his done in Seattle is because it had never been done in Canada period and the government of British Columbia paid for the entire operation down in Seattle. and uh Johnson and Johnson, the medical people bought that uh I think bought the um invention out and now it has been refined a wee bit. And so, Brother Tom had two operations on it for that artificial uh artificial ankle ankle joint. And so, he is uh rather rare. It's hard hard to come around, you know, it was very expensive becoming rare. But anyway, uh this time he didn't have it. Just one of the one of the connections that became a little bit loose, not in the actual joint itself, but into the bone. And it was very very painful. And so that's all fixed. And incidentally, he want to thank you for your prayers very very much because uh the he is he is almost 100% free of of pain. &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful. So, we talk about the two men on the way to Emmas, but we we've been called to live in another season. We're not back there. &gt;&gt; We're up here in another season. &gt;&gt; Uh, and this is a very, very, very unusual. I had probably one of the most difficult times I've had in years with this particular message that I'm speaking to you. And you might say, well, it is so simple. Uh, well, it's simple yet. Uh, but I had a great difficulty. I wanted to distill the age that we're in without depressing you. And that was a very very challenging. I see you smiling, brother Ken. Thank you. uh because it's it's it's almost impossible to describe this age. But I want you to think about now just think about this. God created all things and when he had finished his creation, he looked upon it and he said, "It's good. It's very good." &gt;&gt; God would not look or could not look upon what Satan has done with his creation and say it's very good. That's right. &gt;&gt; And fact is it's going to be fit for a lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said some things that were just very very very interesting. I decided I would look at what he said about atomic power. And each time I went to it, he talked about uh the flood and that they had atomic power back then. and and and and turned the earth perhaps away from the sun. He just put it in simple language, turned away from the sun. He said, "Now this time it'll be thrown into the sun." And I had just finished I had just finished listening to the news and India having 51° C &gt;&gt; which is about 100 almost 125° Fahrenheit. and uh and they had the whole map of the nation just red as red as could be from the terrible terrible heat and hundreds and hundreds of people have perished uh because of the heat and and they said that this morning they said that it was not this morning I guess it was last night they said that the people were just a little bit relieved it had had just dropped below 50° C. I was in India when it it got to 41 and I didn't think I was going to survive. I just laid listless on a bed. Uh I think brother Tim perhaps brother John you've been in countries when it's 40° and that's hot. That's very very hot. I've just my head was just swimming and I just laid still. I couldn't do anything. I don't know what I would do in 51 degrees &gt;&gt; and another shortage of water &gt;&gt; and are trying to bring water in and tank. Hey, hey, this is a billion people, &gt;&gt; a billion people in that country. I just wonder if we call global warming, warming is actually uh something that man is doing that's throwing it throwing it towards the sun and it's just terrible heat. I got thinking about I just I just was thinking about what would we do? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh we had a summer here just a one or one or two ago and everything just caked and turned brown last year. Almost the large cedar trees in our yard just limped and laid there. Branches hung down and there was no water, not enough water. We weren't allowed to put water on them. Uh not allowed to put water on the lawns or the flowers or anything. And oh that's all fine because you know oh it couldn't happen here. What if it did? What if it did? Uh there's so much water. Canada has so much water. I think 109 barrels for every person uh a year and and and we got so much fresh water in the Pacific Northwest and lakes and on and on. And uh I can tell you one thing. Whatever God has said in his word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And whatever God has spoken through that prophet, you better hear it. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it's going to be. &gt;&gt; He might have said it in some very plain language. You're going to throw it toward the sun or throw it in that direction or whatever more. Uh it only means one thing. It's going to be hot. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're called to live in another age. &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden is a perversion of God's Eden. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. The things, everything that you see, we have the lights and we have all this material. All of this was somewhere &gt;&gt; in this earth &gt;&gt; at one time. man and his wisdom and man and his knowledge and being inspired by Satan and and uh and the prophet said one thing, science, what has science got for you? More death. &gt;&gt; That's just a short statement. And we cringe from that and we say, "Oh, surely this is so nice." What's nice? Well, you know, all the color and the fabric and everything is so nice and it changes every year and keeps us running on the treadmill and pushing out the credit cards and it's all wonderful. You're real quiet. God saw that everything that he made and behold it was very good. &gt;&gt; Genesis 3. Satan cannot create. &gt;&gt; These are just brief statements, but they're true statements. He cannot create. He can only pervert what has been created. &gt;&gt; Everything that we see, we've got our cars out there. We have all of our fine things and we have our homes and all the appliances and everything. Everything came out of this earth that God made in the first place. all the metals and all the fabrics and all the plastics and all the things that we have. Well, you say, "Well, man has made it." Uh, all it has all come as a perversion. And Satan cannot create, he can only pervert what God has created. He's taken substances created by God and put it on the earth to captivate the five senses. &gt;&gt; Good. And now if he captivates the five senses and we end up we end up so much in this age. We look at whether it be magazines or the newspapers or something. Just try to turn your eyes away from it. You go into a restaurant and there's all the sports guys and they're doing their thing and you just try to look at the menu, you know, and you want to look up there cuz it's flashes something else. what what what is it now? Or you know, and and whether it be the news, it could be something very very innocent, but uh he's he's and if he gets you or me just looking at it, well uh I I have to try to control this thing &gt;&gt; cuz it buzzes. Oh, it vibrates. I don't have any sound on it. But I'll be sitting with somebody goes ting ting ting tingling ting ting tingling ting ting. I just feel like shut that thing off. And I saw an ad once and it was some ladies trying to have a a little tea, you know, and they were out on a nice uh like a little patio with a beautiful lake out there and everybody and suddenly they all stopped. Zip zip zip zip zip. And they all just grabbed their phone and all with no union threw it into the water and then they were at peace. They were finally at peace and could enjoy enjoy everything and their phones were in the water. Well, I don't have to worry about mine. I have it off here. But once in a while, you know, it it's there's a convenient side to it and say, you know, somebody wants to get you and there's an urgency and you know, they want you to pray or they want you to go to the hospital or something and but but but there's a lot of garbage on it. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of damn damning things on it. &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, well, the net, the net, that's exactly what it is. It's a net." And I just want to ask you if if Satan now has why has he done all this? Not to make life just so much easier for us and to make us a more wholesome people. Why we've gone we've gotten so rank it isn't even look what you have for leaders. Look what we have for leaders. &gt;&gt; Godless people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, as one of our members of parliament just stood up this last week and he said in uh and he said in this is this is our government. This is the government who are supposed to be making laws for us to live by. And they stand he said I could not use the words I could not use the words in public that our leader has used. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is absolutely incredible. So, are we talking about well just a gathering of bad things? No. This is where the world has gotten to. And and and do we fly on planes? Absolutely. I don't want to be on one that goes into the ocean. &gt;&gt; Uh do we drive cars? Absolutely. And and we're we're I'm happy that we'll be able to step into one out here, but don't ever get your eyes on that. Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; Because if I want to ask you a question now. If we become captivated, &gt;&gt; which we are largely, if we become captivated and we're just uh well, we're actually under the control of oh well this oh this isn't new and style has changed etc etc and I need to get another one and so on when and we do I don't want you to get you know I I don't want to get you're bound. But nevertheless, on the other hand, I want to ask you a serious question. If we become captivated by that, now who has become unveiled before us? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm afraid that Satan has succeeded in veiling himself &gt;&gt; in beautiful things &gt;&gt; in just such lovely things &gt;&gt; and beautiful people and celebrities and talented people and in the sports world and until until he has become God. Yes. &gt;&gt; And then in the church, everything is so nice, but we don't want it too hot. We don't want it too cold. We want the lights. So, we want the sound. We want And if it's not just right, you know, I want it to feel right. I want it to sound right so I can hear it. I want it so I can see. I want it to look right. And what's it appealing to? The five senses. And the prophet of God, this prophet says, "Your five senses were not given to you to contact God. &gt;&gt; They they are given to you to contact this world. &gt;&gt; But God then now I'm going to move to another phrase and please listen very very carefully because we start suddenly getting into deep water and I'm speaking just from inspiration now." And that is why that is why God had become flesh. &gt;&gt; And that's what the unveiling of God is all about. He had to become flesh. &gt;&gt; He had to come down in this cursed earth &gt;&gt; and take all soil a body of the earth which was cursed and lived in that with the word. And so the prophet says, so you'll find in the unveiling of God that the prophet and Jesus was a God prophet, but the prophet was the veil, &gt;&gt; but the word that was in him was God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say that again. So the prophet is the veil and the word that is in him is God. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is the veil and the word that's in her is God. And you have to understand that the deity part never gets watered down. &gt;&gt; It can't become diluted. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the word wasn't less in Jesus than it was in God himself. &gt;&gt; The the word went out from God and Jesus was the word because the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; And so now the veil and the word merged together in one body. And he had to take that body to Calvary and pay the ultimate price, pay the absolute sacrifice. And all men that received this, all men that were ordained to receive it, and I'm going to come to predestination. All men that were ordained to say it were absolutely free of sin. &gt;&gt; God paid the price. And actually, God wants to wave. Listen to me now and believe it. God wants to wave the the sinners that Satan Satan took sinners and dragged them to the very depths of sin. And God said, "I paid the price for him. He's free. &gt;&gt; I paid the price for her. She's free." &gt;&gt; Now, he talks about, now just stay with that. He talks about him coming down, how he came down and he talks about I'm gonna I'm gonna bring it right to you sitting here and he he he refers to himself. God refers to himself and that is how he came down. Christ was in Moses. Christ was in Enoch. Christ was in uh Abraham. Christ was in Isaac. What was he doing? He said that's how he came down &gt;&gt; and that's how God came down because the uh the final end of this was these all expressed faith somehow along the way. And when they expressed faith that's the sin unbelief. &gt;&gt; It's not what you did. &gt;&gt; That's not that's the attributes of sin. Aren't you glad for a message? Those are the attributes of sin. That's what sinful people do. Uh but you're you're all humanity have had uh extreme failures someplace along the line. At least Satan tells you that the are bad bad people because you did or thought or whatever said a certain word or whatever more. But now help me now. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to become flesh and he was without sin. &gt;&gt; But he took that body uh of the earth and he was considered sinful although he was not sinful. &gt;&gt; Jesus was without sin but he took a perfect body in a perfect sacrifice to the death. And it was sinful men that judged him &gt;&gt; and found him guilty and worthy of death. And it was their penalty that he was paying. &gt;&gt; It was our penalty that he was paying. &gt;&gt; I want to announce to you, your debt has been paid. &gt;&gt; You cannot add anything to his price. &gt;&gt; He paid the full debt. There's nothing you can add to it. It's not Calvary Plus. It's Calvary and Calvary alone. And God looked upon that sacrifice and when he said, "My father, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He paid the full price. There's nothing you can add to it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do to be accepted of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when he paid the full price, he this is how he came down. &gt;&gt; And you read it in in Matthew 1 and1 says, "This is the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of David." Excuse me, the son of David. The son of David who sent a man to the war so he could bet get killed so David could have his wife Ba Sheba. And out of Basheba will come Solomon. Uh are you are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Isn't that what happened? And he had a child with Basheba before he killed his her husband. &gt;&gt; Or Moses who murdered a man. No. The price Calvary paid it all. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, I said to my wife because I was so thrilled over it. He I said, "God wants to hold the redeemed and shake them in the face of Satan. You You cause this man to murder, but I call him free. He's my prophet." And he led a people out and I delivered them out of out of Pharaoh's hand. You you you you caused this woman uh of Tamar and And she'll be in the motherhood ancestry of Jesus. And she took a seed of her own father-in-law. Oh, horrors. Horrors, not horrors to God. There's nothing so dark. There's nothing so evil that he cannot forgive because he decreed he would forgive. &gt;&gt; Those that would believe him. &gt;&gt; That's the key. &gt;&gt; Some believe and some do not believe. You do not believe, you'll go to hell. That's all there is to it. because there is no redemption. But if you believe, and some of you that think you don't believe, you can't even leave it because you do believe. You know that you believe. You're born to believe. You have the seat of God. And God fornowledge. And this is what so many wise people and theologians can't get through their head. He whom he forneew. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. them. He predestinated. He forneew because he is the God that cannot learn. He looked down, the prophet said, through the stream of time and saw who would believe. He knew that you would believe. And because you would believe, he predestinated you. And he put a seed within you. &gt;&gt; Before you came, he put a seed within you. &gt;&gt; So you could not doubt it. &gt;&gt; You had to believe it. Just try to turn away from it. You cannot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he wants to hold the redeemed &gt;&gt; in the face of his arch enemy. &gt;&gt; Satan, you got angels out of heaven, &gt;&gt; but now these are my sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; And some of them you took by cancer, &gt;&gt; but I healed them. I paid for their price of healing. Some of them you caused to go to an early grave. Some of them you did this or you did that. But I hold them before you as a redeemed of the Lord. I have redeemed them. &gt;&gt; And some of them went into dark denominations. Some of them like my father was an alter boy in a Catholic church. But I called him. &gt;&gt; I spoke to his soul. He gave himself to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's redeemed. And I hold him before you as a redeemed be. And how did he do it? He came and the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; The word became flesh. &gt;&gt; And then beyond that, just listen to this. The the flesh man was virgin born. &gt;&gt; The first Adam was created and formed. But this Adam was virgin born. Even the womb that he went to, he only could be the the the the prophet said that the listen now the words of the prophets. I love this. The words of the prophet anchored &gt;&gt; into the womb of Mary &gt;&gt; because she said as a as you've spoken so be it unto me. &gt;&gt; She so be it unto me. When those two things merged, the very word of God which was pregnantated with life, conceived in her womb, the son of God, and God gave his own son for the sins of the world. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he can hold that price. It's been paid, Satan. Nothing you can do. There is no sin &gt;&gt; that that blood will not purge. There's no darkness that that blood will not purge. There's no evil &gt;&gt; that that blood will not purge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I've stood on the on the street in a man in white because he was in white because they turned him loose from from prison just to come to the meeting. And I was with several of them that had come from prison. Brother David, and the man who was standing beside me was a murderer. &gt;&gt; Believe this message. &gt;&gt; And I was so thankful he wasn't only in a white suit. He was in white because the prison pe guards put him in white. &gt;&gt; All of them were in white to identify themselves as prisoners. I thought, how appropriate. He's white inside. Snow White. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about color. I'm talking about cleanliness now. &gt;&gt; Snow White. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Isn't this marvelous? &gt;&gt; There isn't anything, &gt;&gt; nothing on the earth that a man or woman can do or has done but what has been purged. &gt;&gt; That does not give us license to go out and live in sin. Not at all. No, that's not what it is. Or to live a sinful life. &gt;&gt; This is the full substance that God unveiled himself &gt;&gt; in this age. And and the more that he further that he unveiled himself, it became more difficult for some to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some fact is I just t spoke with one of our brothers is going to be speaking today at uh in a little Pentecostal group. But one man said he was talking to him and he said as he talked to him he found that he was things were from the message. And then he discovered that the man the man said well I became a believer in Dubai and he says and I followed along. He said then I run into the serpent seed and I couldn't take it any further. So he pulled back one of our brothers from this church going to be with them today. &gt;&gt; We want to pray for them. Pray that God will open their eyes that they may see &gt;&gt; glimpses of truth &gt;&gt; thou hast for me. &gt;&gt; Are you getting a little bit of a picture? &gt;&gt; And furthermore, God is not only wanting to wave before, and this is my language now, wave before the enemy. You tried to take them. You took them to an early grave. You tried to take them to a sinful grave, but I paid the price. &gt;&gt; I paid the price. &gt;&gt; In fact, is you tried to twist things so so terribly in the Old Testament that I took uh I took Ruth, a Moabitis, and brought her into Israel. I took Rahab, a harlot. &gt;&gt; How many men did she know? I have no idea. It makes no difference. I tell you, once God decreed that she was one of his children, and furthermore, I'm going to I'm going to wave it so much in the face of Satan. I want you people to hear it. I want you to take it to yourself. &gt;&gt; He took He took the the the the vilest. &gt;&gt; The vilest. &gt;&gt; He wanted to show the strength of Calvary. He took the vilest of sinners. Amen. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said he had blasphemed. &gt;&gt; I don't understand. I don't know what he said, but he became an apostle &gt;&gt; and he recognized he was an apostle and he said he was an apostle. &gt;&gt; He never saw Jesus that we know of. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, he saw the pillar of fire. He recognized the age that he was in. Are you following me? And God did not only God did not only pay the price for them. He did not only wave this in front of Satan's face. Said, "You tried to you tried to make this man do this. You tried to make this woman do this. We don't know anything about Rahab except that she's in the motherhood ancestry of Jesus Christ. Jesus came here &gt;&gt; and he was not ashamed to say Rahab is in my ancestry. I came down through that. I came down through Tamar. I came down through Bath Sheba. There's no sin. In fact is I'm glad I could pay the price. &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just want to step back just a moment and and Satan himself took Jesus. The Bible says, "And the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him." Didn't only show you in this age. &gt;&gt; And this age, friends, You just be thankful you're able to live in this age &gt;&gt; that gave gave gave God gave you the opportunity to live in the most deceptive age. You say praise God &gt;&gt; I was able to live in the most deceptive age. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I was able to live with all these fancy gadgets and overcome the television and overcome television nothing new. The prophet said, our prophet said television was here when when when Elijah was here. Television was here all through the Old Testament. He said it just wasn't discovered till this time. Isn't it amazing? They were discovering things. And so were we &gt;&gt; discovering things because even uh uh do we didn't go from a horse and buggy to a to a automobile and from an automobile to an airplane and from an airplane they've gone to astronauts. And the prophet stopped at astronauts says we got astronauts. Elijah was an astronaut. Enoch was an astronaut. They were caught up to heaven. Jesus was a chief astronaut. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he stood on the earth &gt;&gt; declaring that he was in heaven. &gt;&gt; Even the son of man who is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And Jesus did all of that to show us we could live in any age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it happened to be the age of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; And to the angel of the church of Leodysa, right? And saith the amen and the true witness and the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; This is a different creation. And the prophet and I'll read it hopefully. This is another species. &gt;&gt; This is another type of people. This is a super church. This is a redeemed church. This is a church that's prepared for an exodus. This is not people who expect and need fancy things. We would meet in a church or in a barn if we needed to. We met in a log church. We met in a house. I personally sat on planks that were unplaned, just uh rough planks out of a right here in Cloverdale. Uh that we're not prepared in this building and all this fancy things that that this age provides. We don't need them. &gt;&gt; I can tell you what's in you would meet any place. &gt;&gt; You'd meet anywhere. &gt;&gt; I don't need to have this carpet. &gt;&gt; I've walked on boards. I've walked in the Indian in the Indian shacks. It makes no difference. You see it the way it is right now. But listen friends, it hasn't always been this way. And I'm not interested in people that can just sit on nice pews. I'm interested in people that are rugged people. &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? &gt;&gt; Believers are rugged people. When the prophet said that, he wasn't speaking of, you know, just shine our nails sort of thing. We're rugged people &gt;&gt; and the thing that's in you will meet anywhere. &gt;&gt; There's people right today that are walking all day Saturday in the Congo to be in the church on Sunday. And I tell you friends, if you had to walk, you would walk. &gt;&gt; That hunger would drive you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Is that true, brother Daniel? They'll walk all day Saturday. &gt;&gt; To be in church on Sunday. &gt;&gt; I've seen it myself. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's not some ancient time. That's now. That's today. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this? Why are you preaching like this, Brother Biscll? I'm preaching like this because we're not we're not given over to be a bunch of soft dish rags. Come on. &gt;&gt; We've been made this way and we come a long ways, friends. But don't ever don't ever let uh uh this age veil. Satan himself is veiled in beauty. &gt;&gt; He's veiled in celebrity. &gt;&gt; He's veiled in that in in in well things are it's hard to describe. very hard to describe. I had a difficult time the last week or two. Not difficult within myself, but difficult to think that the taxes we pay are paying for people within the government in Canada. I'm ashamed to say this, and I should perhaps not say it over a pulpit, but they're wanting to pass a bill that makes it illegal to identify or uh diminish the importance of transgender. &gt;&gt; True. And they had they had gathered around them and the media is pushing it. &gt;&gt; Who's pushing this thing? &gt;&gt; What about the people that are solid family people? &gt;&gt; What about the people that want to live clean? &gt;&gt; What about the people that want to go to church &gt;&gt; and have their children in Sunday school? What about these people? But yet the whole body, the whole government is seems driven by some spirit. And they are driven by a spirit. It's an unclean spirit. And it's Satan himself that's driving the thing. They can shut me down, but they can't shut me up. &gt;&gt; They can never shut the believer up. &gt;&gt; Who's driving this thing? And a handful of people, five or six people, men who are obviously men who want to appear like a woman. &gt;&gt; And what a shame. What a disgrace. &gt;&gt; They need to be read the riot act &gt;&gt; and told what is right and what is right and get on and live like a man. Live the way you should. Live like a woman. &gt;&gt; Go home and bake some cookies. said as standing as a flag person. [Music] &gt;&gt; I think that our prophet Messenger did such an honor to women when he said that, you know, standing with a big gun on their hip and something else and a billy club and and handcuffs. I'm not mocking. I'm saying that's no place for her. &gt;&gt; I got a queen sitting back here. You think I'd let Sister Biscll stand out there with a uh amongst all these cursing men and and have a gun on one side and handcuffs on the back? Handcuff who? &gt;&gt; Pepper spray who? &gt;&gt; That's not a woman's place. Stand out in the front and want to say, "Well, women want their freedom." That isn't freedom. &gt;&gt; That's terrible bondage. think I have to take a gun and or or whatever. I had two policemen at my door just a few days ago. Nothing bad. They actually came twice. They came twice. Nice fellas. I had them in the house and uh you know they can sense a different atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Maybe they see the wife of the house and they they feel different. And they they they came around. I Well, I'll just tell you so and I'll tell the whole world. Uh they said they said you have a gun that's unregistered. Here's a car about a $60,000 car and and and two policemen and they're sitting waiting waiting waiting for me to tell me I have a gun that's unregistered. I said, "Which one?" Oh, they said, "You have more than one. Is this incredible?" I said, "You know what?" I said, "I'm paying you guys wages." He said, "That's right." I said I wanted them to know I'm paying your wages. I in fact is I was a little out of sorts. Not really. I just paid some taxes, you know, with tax income tax time. So we paid taxes. I said, "I'm paying your wages." Yeah. They said, "You are?" Yeah. And so they waited and waited and I they said, "Well, shall we come in?" I said, "No, I'll bring it out." So I said, "What caliber is it?" That's what they said. Oh, you got more than one. And to think that while I'm there down the street, you know, &gt;&gt; two doors down from me, a guy got blasted away right in his driveway. I don't live in a bad area. I live in a fairly decent area. But he got blasted away because he had a Lamborghini car out in front and he was a drug trader. I guess he was trading in drugs. and they got time to come by with all this equipment &gt;&gt; and all this. This is our society. This is the direction it's going. And now I'm to accept and we're to accept and and uh you don't even know what the laws are. &gt;&gt; They're passing laws that you couldn't possibly keep. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And passing laws that you will not keep. You can't keep &gt;&gt; and you're paying for them. And you people in America, exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; You got laws that make lawful people criminals. &gt;&gt; We have laws. Now, I'm I'm on I'm on a case now. I'm on a run. So, just But I'll only be a moment. We got laws that insist that homes be broken up. We got laws that state that we can't pay. I know what I'm talking about. You the kind of pension you should get and the kind of pension your husband should get. But if you get a divorce, we could do it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. You know how many times I faced that? Probably one, two, three times. And the pe believers come to me and said, "Should we get a divorce?" Why? Well, the government says, "We can pay you enough pension if you get a divorce." No. That that come from the throne of God, did it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. That come from the pit of hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in each of those cases, none of them got divorced. &gt;&gt; And somehow it worked out. &gt;&gt; Somehow it worked out. &gt;&gt; That happens to be the age that you're living in. &gt;&gt; Now, I want I know I want you to listen. Now, I got your attention. I want you to listen real good. Your prophet talked about, now I'm taking this to you personally, he talked about the molder who molds the bells to give a certain tang and then he starts in the natural. &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of life you maybe came from or what kind of background or how messed up you were or or how disgraced you are. Maybe you don't want to talk about your past, but he says he bred this one to this one and this one to this one and he bred this one to this one, this one to this one. And he stops. He says that's how he came down. &gt;&gt; That's how Jesus came down. &gt;&gt; He let Tamar do her in-laws made promises that they didn't keep. And so she had incest with her father-in-law. And then Rahab the harlot and she had men and whatever more and all these things carried on. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say nothing. It doesn't say nothing about that in the New Testament. But Rahab ends up in the with the heroes of the faith in Hebrews 11. &gt;&gt; I'd love to have my name there. She has her name there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that that doesn't make her great. That's not the purpose of it. It makes Calvary great. It makes Jesus great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God, brother Roy. This is something to thank God about. Has nothing to do about our past. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do about our past. And &gt;&gt; then he says he bred this one to this one and this one to this one. &gt;&gt; And this one to this one. Listen to what the prophet said. You'll never hear it anywhere else until he got exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. If you're a believer &gt;&gt; and you've been given a heart to believe, &gt;&gt; God bred this one to that one and this one to that one. I'm talking about this natural person. This one to that one until he got exactly &gt;&gt; what he wanted. [Applause] And that's how he came down &gt;&gt; until he got exactly brother John, &gt;&gt; brother Tip, exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; You know what that did to me? It start to break me up. I thought, "Oh, God. There's so many things I'm so disappointed in with myself." &gt;&gt; But you got Exactly. &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation. I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to receive that word. That's a thus sayaith the Lord. He brought this one to that one and this one to that one till he got exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; I'm not using idol words. Exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; I wanted you to hear this, brother David. Until he got exactly what he wanted. I want this congregation to hear that. and to receive it and take it into themselves and say, "I will believe that." Until he got exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; I'm here as a son of God that he does not love halfway, but he loves 100%. I'm here as a daughter of God that he loves dearly. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You talk about grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's abundant grace. &gt;&gt; And when Satan showed Jesus all the all the kingdoms of the world, he was not impressed by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And neither should we be impressed. &gt;&gt; With what he dazzles before us today, &gt;&gt; what he hangs before us, all these dazzling things everywhere I go. And the more I've given myself to the message, the less it impresses me. I'm not impressed with the world. And we shall not be impressed with the world or the greatness of the world or the intelligence of the world or all of these things because if if Satan gets a hold of it, which he has, &gt;&gt; this is his kingdom. And in this day after we'd had, you know, we have the all kinds of u documentaries and videos that are available to you of the war. Awitz. You were just at Awitz. Solemn experience. They have a memorial to it in Israel. Very somber. It's happening every day. &gt;&gt; It's happening every day. [Music] And people take the message and they say, you know, Brother Bram uses the term atomic fodder. &gt;&gt; Oh, and we seem we're so self-righteous about it. Say, oh, that is so terrible. We don't want anybody to suffer. &gt;&gt; What about all the people in the graveyards? &gt;&gt; What about the untold billions that are in graveyards? They're already gone. So, let's not talk about those that are living. Let's talk about those that have gone. And while they were living, what were they doing &gt;&gt; while they were living? Cursing, damning, &gt;&gt; hating God, and then have some backsliding preacher put them into heaven. &gt;&gt; Who Who wants that? Isn't that the epitome of hypocrisy? &gt;&gt; Hear my words. Is that not so? You know, I know what I'm talking about. I've been through it. There was a man that passed away. I guess I just have too many accounts, but there was a man who passed away. He was related to a a woman in this church. And they told me, they said, "The family hasn't got anybody to. They don't even know a minister. Would you have a service for him?" For her sake, I said, "Yes, I'll have a service for him." I went to the funeral home and all his colleagues were gathered because he worked at a in a big union. all his colleagues were gathered and all, you know, hugging one another and so on. I that's fine. I just stood there and one was walking up just walked up past me carrying a white cowboy hat and God spoke to me. Do you believe you God speaks? &gt;&gt; That's what makes this church special. &gt;&gt; God speaks. &gt;&gt; God says specific things. When I talk about Switzerland, I'm not talking about some convention. I'm talking about God speaking 10 12,000 miles away and saying this is a wounded one &gt;&gt; and go and ask her. She is a wounded one and she's not wounded anymore. &gt;&gt; Her her and her husband and a whole flock of people are healed. How &gt;&gt; we ought to believe in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He's the one who speaks. He's the one who's saying things. He's the one who's drawing other people there. &gt;&gt; And God spoke to me and says he's a homosexual, &gt;&gt; the one that's in the coffin. He's a homosexual. And this is his partner walking by with a cowboy hat. And I just watched him. I stepped to the door and watched him go in. He went to the coffin. He stood by the coffin. Now put yourself in my place. You think this is an easy place? It's not an easy place. And he lays the cowboy hat on his partner's body and he comes to walk back out and I made him at the door and I said, "He must have meant a lot to you." "Yeah," he said. He meant very much to me. And he started to get teary and he walked out. They think I'm going to put him in heaven. &gt;&gt; Not a chance. &gt;&gt; That's not my place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I just told my wife about it. The only reason I'm talking about it now is I just told my wife about it last night. I said I just got up and I spoke about the life of the the life that God put in the botney life and the plants and the flowers and things and how they come up and each year. And I just talked about the life of God. &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; Let them go wherever God says he shall go. &gt;&gt; We're done with hypocrisy in the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're done with this. Weak need Leodysian age. &gt;&gt; The prophet said they need to get uh just preachers with uh gloves on. &gt;&gt; And say it the way it is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's time for us and you in America and wherever you come from in the world to stand up for truth. Let the chips fall where they may. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not impressed with Satan's kingdoms and the glory of them. &gt;&gt; And neither are we impressed. &gt;&gt; We're not impressed. &gt;&gt; They may have the buses and the airplanes and all these things and to make the life easier and more beautiful cars and more beautiful clothes and all of us. It's all going to perish. And the prophet says it's going to be burned up. &gt;&gt; And I say in the name of Jesus Christ, bring it on. &gt;&gt; We talk about a change. We're not going to be changed just in in all the flowery things. That's not what's changing us. It's the word of God that's changing us. And you people that have read and have been in the unveiling of God, and if you have not yet, you shall, you should. And it will you'll run into lots of things you do not understand. When you can't understand it, you'll say, "Praise God, this is beyond this puny brain of mine." &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, and he had several thousand in front of him, that's in the unveiling of God. And he had several thousand in front of them. He says to the thousands, "Except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." &gt;&gt; And that was it. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they left him. Your Bible does not say that he sent visitation committees after them. Your Bible does not say, "Oh," he said, "wait a moment. Wait a moment. Now, let me explain that." &gt;&gt; He didn't need to explain it. &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet in this day spoke the opening of the seven seals with a period at the end and said, "That's thus, sayith the Lord. That's the end of it." &gt;&gt; He never came back to explain it the second time. That's what it is. &gt;&gt; It is what it is. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He showed him the glory &gt;&gt; and that was it. &gt;&gt; And he shows us his glory. &gt;&gt; And we want to announce to the Satan, to all of his hordes, to every demon spirit that he will bring up. We want to let him know that whether whether he would get fancier or more or or more refined or more cultured or more whatever, we are not here to accept his devices. We're not here to accept his ways. We're not here to accept his language. We're not here to accept all the fine things and the community. We're not We don't need a community, friends. We have the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why this school over here for you young people are in school. That's why the school said that you young people shall not have cell phones. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And called the parents. And the parents said, "If you're going to allow your children to have those, don't come and enroll the kids." Do you know why? Because there's so much vile &gt;&gt; and vulgar &gt;&gt; and damning and unclean things. &gt;&gt; You might be washed nice on the outside, but your soul &gt;&gt; is unclean. and taking and feeding on those things. We cannot feed on those things. And what's good for the young people is good for the adults as well. We cannot feed on those things. We cannot feed on those things. You I if they've had a hold on you and there have been believers that have had a hold on you, you want to say, "God, give me deliverance. Jesus Christ, you paid the price for me to be free from these things." And whom the Son sets free shall be free indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know why I'm preaching this way? Because I know how cunning he is. [Applause] He makes things so desirable, &gt;&gt; so enticing, &gt;&gt; that scarcely, &gt;&gt; scarcely the believer would be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just exactly the way it is. &gt;&gt; And he brings on he brings on pressures. I hadn't intended on going into all of this. In fact, is I had decided I wouldn't. But then here I am. But he makes so much pressures, economic pressures, uh different kinds of pressures, pressures on the young men and young ladies &gt;&gt; to go into areas of maybe areas of education. that you ought not to go into. &gt;&gt; Says, "Well, our daughter Joanne wanted to go to nursing." So, my wife and I drove her to where the signed into nursing. It's a very intense program. You only get two days off in a year. And after two years, you're an RN. And after one year, you're a registered uh practical nurse. So, we got into the reception room and there the whole wall is all fractured. Fractured. The whole wall of of of of wallpaper all around the reception room is all fractured. And there were some images, some kind of images. And I was trying to figure it out. I'm sitting there waiting, waiting. I'm looking at these images. You know what it was? A hard rock band. &gt;&gt; It was a picture of a hard rock band. And all the whole wall was all fractured. And I I you know, thank God for the word of God. I just said it's those guys that have fractured the people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Those guys, that whole spirit has sent the people bazoonis and now they're going to go through a whole education of nursing and everything try to put it back together again. &gt;&gt; What a deception. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? Do you think I've gone off the head? And so I I said to my daughter, "Have a look at that." I said, I said that's why that's why they need to give you psychology. &gt;&gt; Try to put people together &gt;&gt; and then ask a question. Why are they this way? They don't even realize that they've invited &gt;&gt; the very the very spirit of things. &gt;&gt; Friends, we haven't only got it. You know, they talked about when when the bra prophet was here, when brother Brandham was here, they had te televisions in uh in in uh uh into the house. He said it brought Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Hollywood's a hell hole. &gt;&gt; You call those people celebrities, you wouldn't want them as your neighbor. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And the whole world goes into a am I being too critical? &gt;&gt; No. the whole world goes into a a mode of a weeping mode for for people. Well, he just uh perished or she just perished at at 32 years old or 37 years old or 41 or 51 or whatever it is, you know, from a drug overdose and they want you to cry over that. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Isn't this this is our society. Do you think God shedding tears over that? &gt;&gt; No. Not. He's He did everything. &gt;&gt; And people always don't listen to me, congregation. I'm not going on and on, but don't mistake the age that we're in. And don't mistake the the kind of result that you have and the kind of feeling. And don't apologize. Something rises within you and say it's wrong. &gt;&gt; That's not the way I live. &gt;&gt; That's not the way our home shall be. You young ladies that are are expecting to get married, you wait on God. &gt;&gt; You young men expecting to get married, you wait on God. &gt;&gt; And let God do the work. &gt;&gt; Don't get in any panic mode. &gt;&gt; I can tell you home is heaven or hell. &gt;&gt; Not as many amens that time, &gt;&gt; but that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; You that are married, God is the answer. Christ is the answer &gt;&gt; and the word is the answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what, brother John, help me. I'm going to take my coat off. &gt;&gt; I want to preach the last few minutes. One thing we all know, we all know where we kind of came from. You people don't know where I came from. But I came from a very, very harsh background. Not harsh and sinful, harsh in loneliness. I know you were way back, brother Nathan, way back in Idaho and way back in the wilderness, but I was in the wilderness alone. I lived in camps, not for days or weeks, but months and months and months in bitter cold with nothing. practly nothing. And I thought in the last few days, brother Daniel, I've thought of much about I thought, God, you brought me from there to have friends all over the world and uh have people in the church and the people who will come. I could scarcely believe it. I admire you people for coming to the church. I'm thankful that the brothers give me opportunity to preach. But I'm pouring my heart out. And I say to you in all sincerity, this is not because of my age. This is an awful age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is an awful, awful age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I was in my teens, drugs were just coming in &gt;&gt; and people were taking drugs and they wanted, you know, me to get involved. I wasn't in I I I didn't have it in me. It just wasn't there. &gt;&gt; And when I say that God even bred this one to that one and this one to that one and this one to that one until he got the right thing until he got exactly what he wanted. Brother Nathan, he got exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Brother David, he got exactly what he wanted. Brother Ernie, I know some of our backgrounds are maybe horror stories, but he brought one to another until he got the right thing. &gt;&gt; And he got exactly what he wanted. And I want you to be able to sit here today and say, I'm exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Whatever country you come from, whatever culture you come from, He got exactly what he wanted. &gt;&gt; I'm looking down into your faces because God has laid this upon my heart. He got exactly what he wanted, Sister Lisa. &gt;&gt; He just he brought one to the other and one to the other because he knew what he was going to do on the spiritual side. &gt;&gt; On the spiritual side, &gt;&gt; young man, on the spiritual side, he saw you as his son, &gt;&gt; his daughter. And I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to begin a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're not part of the old creation. They're part of the new creation. I'm going to start it I'm going to start it with blood. My own blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start it with my own blood. &gt;&gt; And in this blood is no traits of sin. In this blood is nothing. In this blood is only to go the way of the word. And in this blood will be in one called Jesus Christ. And he will take the cursed earth. He will take it to Calvary. He'll take the sins of the world. And all who believe upon him, who believe upon him shall be saved. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who wants to stay here? Who wants to stay in this mess? Who wants to stay in this conglomeration? I say with the Apostle John, even so, Lord Jesus, come. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I announce to you, you're made for another place. &gt;&gt; You hungler for another place. No wonder we talk about a change. You are you are destined &gt;&gt; for a change. [Music] [Applause] When you're in the message &gt;&gt; in the message of unveiling of God, the prophet is simply simply saying that he's unveiled to the believer. &gt;&gt; He's veiled to the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; He's veiled in the prophet. He's veiled in Moses. He's dwells on that. He was veiled in the prophet. He was so strong upon that. He was so veiled in Moses that when Moses received the word and came out, they had to put a veil over his face. So the people could not look upon him because he had he was the word of God to the people. And somehow people think that God in a prophet today will be something less. It's nothing less. &gt;&gt; And that thought comes from the devil. And the reason why the devil wants you to think that is because that word then comes through the prophet to you &gt;&gt; and you become the veil. &gt;&gt; And he and Satan doesn't want that. &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting against that. &gt;&gt; He hates that truth. And that I struggled with it this week. Satan hates that. It's not less a word friends on the balconies. It's the same word that came out of the bosom of the father, came down into the flesh and became Jesus Christ. And Jesus said, "I don't leave you coverless. I will come to you." And it won't be it won't just be you and the father up there and the Holy Ghost somewhere. It'll be we will be in you &gt;&gt; even to the end of the consummation. &gt;&gt; Something less, no, nothing less. The same God, the same God will be in you. And theologians would say, "What are you trying to make us?" We're trying to make us what Jesus said we were. &gt;&gt; Trying to make us that these weak people will believe the word of God. Friends, I'm getting tired. I'm getting weak. But this has been a spiritual battle. Satan hasn't wanted me to get this to you. But don't be caught up in this world. This world is going to perish. This world is going to perish. &gt;&gt; And you shall walk out on the ashes &gt;&gt; of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; You shall walk out on the ashes. &gt;&gt; I say you don't want to miss that. &gt;&gt; That's one march you want to be in. That's one walk you want to be on. We have all the community walks today. We're going to walk for cancer and walk for this and walk for that. Oh, when we walk on that walk I'm talking about is the walk of the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the redeemed goal &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just five more minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in this world, this has nothing to do with our school. We think that people should be in it as much as possible. Now in this world that we live in, this is the third last service the prophet preached. This is where in this chapter, show us the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you Jesus was showing them the father. How is it, Philillip, you say, "Show us the father." And I've been with you so long and you haven't seen the father. His third last service laying laying a word that would be read in this age, &gt;&gt; in your age. You've got the tape. You've got it on your iPad. You've got it somewhere available to you. You need to hear it. This is the service. And he spoke in there. And he said now in this world that we live in &gt;&gt; that you live in in this education I want to prove you prove to you education science civilization and all is now the same thing is in this civilization altogether we read we write we do this we don't never get it but don't never get adjusted to Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to work. You've got to pay your bills. You drive a car. You've got to gas up. You got to pay rent or you've got to buy a home or something. But don't never get adjusted to that. &gt;&gt; Don't let that be the boss. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Don't let that ever be in control. You control it. Use it. use it for the kingdom of God. And you can kind of be a little uh uh uh what shall I say? You know, you're on the inside. I've got an inside track. I know a little bit about this. I'm kind of a secret agent for the Holy Ghost. I belong to another kingdom. I don't even belong to the society. I'm another race. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah, we have people from Africa, from China, from Japan, from wherever. But we're of another race. We have another passport called the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're from another country. &gt;&gt; People of the world will listen to this kind of preaching and say, "He's a bigot. He's something else. I'm not. I'm a Holy Ghost fil preacher." Hallelujah. That believes the words of Jesus Christ. And I'll say to this world, you're the people that crucified Jesus. Hallelujah. I'm the people that believed he came out of the grave. I'm the one who believes he's still alive today. I believe he's still doing the supernatural things. He's still delivering people. He's still healing people. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you young people especially, you ought to rejoice and say, "Thank God. That's my God. That's my Jesus. That's my kind of preaching." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm so glad I'm in that number. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Some of you might say, "Well, I haven't experienced all those things, Brother Ed. Just wait. I've been a lot further down the road." And incidentally, the word of God says to me, you elders, you tell the children. &gt;&gt; And it says to you, don't move the old landmarks, old landmarks. &gt;&gt; What I saw, what I've experienced is the same God. &gt;&gt; He held me in childhood. He held me in my mother's death. &gt;&gt; He held me when I when there were all kinds of temptations. He held me when drugs were coming into the world. He held me when uh all kinds of fancy things and they wanted to uh you know race the cars. I didn't have it in me to race the cars. I just didn't care for those things. And the girls came along. Oh yeah, the girls. And they're the flooy, you know, flooy girls. And they they wanted I'm not talking about you sisters. I'm talking about those of the world. But it had no attraction to me. Hallelujah. I was attracted to something in God's word. I thought, God, you said something about this. Did I know understand the Bible? No, I didn't understand the Bible. But I believe the Bible and I'm saying it to you as a witness today. In my youth, I believe this Bible. And as a young preacher, I believe this Bible. When I met the prophet of God, I met this Bible. And here I am today. I still believe the same word of God. I saw it work when I was young. I've seen it work when I was old and I'm here to say it works. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, it works. And the word of God is true. True. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yesterday I stood by the ocean. My wife is standing beside me. I said, you know, I said, somehow God humiliates us. I said that, see those old black stones down there, just millions of them. See those waves coming in? Waves lapping up against the stones. You say, "Well, that's nothing. That's just the ocean." Hey, I'm a man. I was supposed to be the epitome of God's creation. This water was here when God first spoke. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this water's been lapping up against it. What What are these stones worth? Next to nothing. What's these stones worth? Nothing. Just black stones. What are they worth? What am I worth? &gt;&gt; And I'm humiliated. I may be gone in a short time. Those stones will still be here. The water will still be here lapping up. I'm so glad that friends, if you can't say, you want to say before the service is over, the God that made that water, the God that put those stones there, that God is my father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his life is my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As he lives, so I live. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He paid my penalty. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what Satan pokes down my memory lane. I can say, "It's forgiven. It's forgiven. I'm washed whiter than the snow. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to sing? I'm going to rejoice &gt;&gt; when the redeemed are gathering in. Brother &gt;&gt; Ryan, hallelujah. Nice to see you, Brother Jim. Such a joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The brother that sang, I understand he's from Brother McGary's church &gt;&gt; and the choir. God bless them. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now we're going to sing. &gt;&gt; You young people got a voice. &gt;&gt; You want to sing for brother Biscll? &gt;&gt; Sing when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. You think we're fanatics? You want to go to the next NBA game. I tell you what. And are they waving in the hockey game and they're waving and all these people and they're not nuts. We're supposed to be nuts. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Is this Is this too sanctified here? &gt;&gt; No. When a redeemed are gathering in. You think that's just a dream? That's a reality. I don't know how, but we're going to walk in. And the prophet said, "We'll sit down, Brother Jim, across from one another, and tears of joy will come down our face." And then the king himself will come in and he'll wipe the tears. Say, "Don't weep anymore, children. It's all over. It's all over, Brother Andes. The battle will be over. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God." How do you feel about it up in your balcony? Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going to be there? Yes. Yes, we're going to be there. &gt;&gt; Sing when the redeemer gather. I tell you, &gt;&gt; I am on the rapture. I will be happy. I will raise the heaven and the city in the sky. [Music] I got [Music] again. [Music] Oh, how shout, [Music] you know, when we sing that course, those that are going to be baptized, if you'll go now and prepare for baptism, Brother Murphy will meet you and your your friends and we'll be with you when you're getting ready. As soon as they come, they're going to have the baptism right away. But when I sing this course, when the redeemed are gathering, I will sing. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm doing now. And I will shout. Glory to God. I just can't say it as a whisper. I will sing. And I will shout. I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Glory to God. Let me just have a personal a personal time of joy here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll forgive me, Brother David. Yesterday, I woke up very early in the morning with this young man's name on my mind, and I couldn't shake it. And I couldn't shake it. I got more nervous. David more nervous till I couldn't lay in bed anymore and I just threw the covers back and head to my office and sent you a little email. Thank you for answering back. Then you sent me another one this morning. Said I'll be in church. I'll be praying for you. And in my heart I I wanted to say be sitting in your same seat. But that was just my desire but God gave me my desire. Thank you, brother David. Hallelujah. Never give up. There is no weapon, no weapon. Say that will you. No weapon that is formed against me that shall prosper. Hallelujah. No weapon shall prosper. You'll prosper when Satan's making the weapon. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. I want to send you out of this place with victory in your soul. And not only a hope, but this is not a hope so religion. This is a I know it. Yes. &gt;&gt; When the redeemed joe [Music] and if you're not a believer, be a believer. Brother John talked about that that so touched my soul. Was it brother Brandham had a person in the healing line said if you're not saved just not right just step out and then step back in. I say to you you don't have to step anywhere. You just step on the side of repentance. I'm sorry oh God with the from the depths of my heart and I'm going to step back in. Glory to God. Is it just that simple? Just that simple. Do that. If you haven't got the victory, I'm going to just step out while I'm bound. Thank God I am free. Free. Free. I'll step back in. We'll shout and we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. &gt;&gt; Next verse. There will be a [Music] I am beautiful. [Music] My [Music] soul is [Music] sing. [Music] angels join the song. [Music] [Music] You will be with me. [Music] Or you might say, I can just hear someone say, I'm well, I'm just not made quite like that. I'm not made like brother Bisco. Oh, give me another story. I I I just want to see you on the other side. I see the biggest crowd of fanatics I ever saw say, "Oh, Brother Biscll, you preached that when I was down there." That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I preached that so that you could have this kind of liberty up here and down here. You believe it, friends? &gt;&gt; I'm impressed when the prophet of God talked to people want to kill themselves. Said, "Now just go and be happy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why be happy? The deliverer's here. The healer is here. &gt;&gt; Talk about the change of the body. The one that changes it is here. &gt;&gt; He sent his word here. We have it, friends. We have it all. Oh, when the redeemed river [Music] will sing when we are against how far away. Brother Murphy, you can come out. We better sing at a time or two. I'm waiting for those to be baptized. Oh, and the redeemer. [Applause] [Music] I will die. I will see. [Music] Shake hands with one another. Let's shake hands with one another. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] You may sit down. You may have your seats. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sit down. Okay, good. So, brother Ryan Fong and uh has been faithfully coming to the service for almost two months. I think brother Ed was just appreciate everything you have to be perfect. Everything you have to be uh just right. But uh you know when I heard brother John told me um brother F is coming from North Vancouver and uh every time he come to the service he has to ride on bus for two two and a half hours almost and that's to take a great effort &gt;&gt; if the that just shows that the people they're hungry for the word of God &gt;&gt; and I'll say that in the last two months brother Ryan has heard a lot of your preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And many times the hard saying &gt;&gt; but the the seed of a god will never be turned away &gt;&gt; but they always are receiving the word of a god. &gt;&gt; And so brother Ed just mentioned uh uh you know when uh Jesus when they uh come to uh uh speak into the word said if you don't eating my blood are you if you don't eat my flesh you don't drink my blood you have uh no life in you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And many people said this is hard saying and many people turned it away. &gt;&gt; Yes. But there are some people left &gt;&gt; that is remant that Peter said uh uh you have the word of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Who should we turn to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother B said are they going to go back to the cold old denomination? &gt;&gt; No, they cannot go back. Sometime the Lord is sit at the heart saying &gt;&gt; he just we down the people. &gt;&gt; But as I was speaking the other day but the purpose is not only just to weigh down the people. &gt;&gt; The purpose is to get the group together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting people ready for the rapture. Getting the people around the word. And that's exactly the word our brother Wine has doing. &gt;&gt; We are so thankful that uh he can give it his heart to the Lord &gt;&gt; and to repented. And now we're going to the baptize him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the brother John has shared the words uh with brother Ryan and in the last two months and also this morning. We just pray the Holy Spirit uh coming down to totally baptize our brother. We can baptize him in the water, but it take the Holy Spirit to come down to really embrace our brother into our Lord Jesus and booze him. &gt;&gt; You have anything to say? &gt;&gt; Uh Romans 3 has really been on my heart a lot. Uh Romans 3:23. So that's all I really have to say. A lot of stage pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's have a prayer. Oh dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; how we thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord thinking about 19 years ago Lord I'm standing in the same tank of water &gt;&gt; and baptized in your name. At that time I don't know anything Lord Lord &gt;&gt; but only thing I know that you said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sin. Oh God, we know this is not the watery missionary sin but our heart Lord we are coming to you Lord. Our heart desiring of you. We having been binded by sin of the world by the religion but Lord this is the moment that we are baptized our brother into the water. Lord he already have a change that happened in his heart. Lord, you said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. So father I just ask you let your holy ghost to baptize my brother Lord that the holy spirit that coming down Lord like a fire to burn all the tr away burn all the religion away to burn all the the things that is the false burn all the things the world away but that is spirit that dwelt in his heart Lord we know there's a changing of heart in him is already happening but Lord we just ask you to do a mightier work Lord Lord continue to work in it in him my brother Lord are holding my brother still let him sustain it in the word of a god father we thank you Lord &gt;&gt; but mine &gt;&gt; since you believe the Lord and I'll baptize you in the true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christl [Applause] song brother sing that song [Music] redeemed Walking the price [Music] [Music] just I am I [Music] Uh this is our dear sister Kora and uh she's uh sister Juniper's husband's niece. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So sister Kora has been coming to the church u uh with sister Juniper and the family for uh many months. I think it's from last September. And the one thing that sister Kora said is really touching me. She said um uh the reason I want to be baptized she said I saw the life that in my aunt sister juniper &gt;&gt; and also I saw the life that in the whole congregations over here she has been uh go to the church before that's in Beijing that's with sister juniper and uh uh I know that's the starting of it but it's the life of the people that really created the desire that I end our dear sister &gt;&gt; and the bible said that for the name for the righteous that if they receive the righteous man, they will receive the gift, the reward of the righteous man. So we believe uh that our sister Kora has saw the life that in the people that's touched her and she said I said I want to live the same life like all you lived and so you have something you want to say to the Lord. Uh thanks Jesus Lord. Um leave me far away from to hear far far trying not to hear to receive his message to know his word to understand his word. &gt;&gt; And I think um from this moment from now on past is past I'm brand new. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I will walk he his way and he told me and he lead me and to know his word that's amen the Lord fill our sister let's pray &gt;&gt; oh gracious heavenly father it's just a simple word from our dear sister Cora Lord is a God in simplicity that how you touched our sister that by the life of the brothers and sisters here Lord she desire to live the same life like this people lived &gt;&gt; not because they lived a good life not because they live the smooth life in this world but because they live a godly life that godly life has touched our sister so Lord we can baptize our sister in water but Lord only you can baptize her by the Holy Spirit So Lord I just ask you let a baptism of the Holy Spirit be her portion that the Holy Spirit coming down let a presence of a God coming down even at this moment that it drop it into her heart Lord because she has prepared a place for you. She has a prepared a soft part in her heart to let the Lord Jesus to dwell in. So Lord, we just ask you let your Holy Spirit dwell permanently in our sister's heart and never leave her always leading her step by step, step by step until Lord of the Rapture. Father, we thank you, Lord. We praise you, Lord. We praise you all these months that you have worked a great work in our dear sister's life. just ask you to continue the working in in her. Let her life be always walk on the right path of Jesus Christ have been walked along Lord. Let her life be always be dedicated to Jesus Christ. May her life be always centered around the life of Jesus Christ Lord and may her whole being belongs to you. We thank you Lord. Sister Cora, &gt;&gt; since you believe the Lord Jesus as your savior and you repented and we baptized you in the true Christian baptism in the name of a beloved Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; What a glorious day. &gt;&gt; What a capstone to the message is to see a couple of souls be baptized in true Christian baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the day, how can the day be more perfect except we have a rapture. &gt;&gt; A body change. Step across the curtain of time. Let's all go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful service this morning. Let's sing, I have a maker. Amen. Aren't you glad he knows your name? [Music] I have a maker before my heart and before I end. My life was he knows my name. He knows my every [Music] me I call. I have a father. I have a father. because he is and you'll never leave me no matter where I go. He knows my name. He knows my heart. He sees me fall and hear me. I closing the second verse again. I have a father. I have a father. He calls me his own and you'll never meet me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my everyone [Music] and hear me when I call. He knows my name. He knows my name. [Music] He knows my heart. He sees each and then he hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just give him thanks this morning. Blessed be thy name, oh God. Oh Lord, that you know our name. You watched over us. You directed our lineage. You brought us into existence. Blessed be thy holy name, oh Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. We praise you, oh Lord. You're worthy, oh God. You have paid the price. You have redeemed us from every kindred, tongue, and nation. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said in that day you will know &gt;&gt; I am in the father. The father in me. I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; What day? This day when the word becomes open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wrote down something that brother Biscoll said right at the beginning. I want you to take it with you. Take everything with you. But I'm going to take your memory right back to the beginning of the sermon. Jesus the father and the words were synonymous. &gt;&gt; And then he brings us into the picture. Jesus the father, the words that he spoke now become resident in a bride. &gt;&gt; All together God unveiling himself &gt;&gt; now in bride form. &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's a great hour to live in in the opening of the word. what they had on the day of Pentecost now revealed by a message in these last day that you might understand the unveiling of God. That I might understand the unveiling of God. God had a purpose that he might reveal himself in his family. &gt;&gt; Jesus the father, the word, and you. &gt;&gt; God's great purpose he had in his mind. What a wonderful day to live in. &gt;&gt; The most deceptive day, &gt;&gt; but a day of overcomers, &gt;&gt; a day of conquerors. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together as we dismiss in prayer. &gt;&gt; If you have a need, he's here very present. If you have a desire, a burden, or maybe you just want to say, "Lord, make these things real to me, more real than they've ever been before." Brother Brandham said in the in the message, the unveiling of God, it's not just what you say you believe, but when you really believe, you live it. &gt;&gt; And it lives itself out through you. &gt;&gt; So, let's just say, Lord, anchor this in our hearts this morning. Heavenly Father, how precious it's been, oh God, to sit at your feet, Lord, to hear these words and inspired through your servant the veil of a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The veil of a man, a gift, oh God, that you might step behind that veil. And that's what I was looking for. And I'm sure many were looking for this morning, Lord. That you might step behind the veil of a man and speak the word. The same word that was eternal, that existed before the world ever existed, now becoming known to the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, take those things and anchor them within our hearts. Wash us, purge us, Lord, with your word that we might stand totally in perfect faith before the throne of grace this morning and say, Lord, you are our father. You are our maker. You're the one that ordained our families to come the way they did. That we might come in this hour just exactly the way you wanted us. Yes. With the weaknesses that you knew that we would have that in our weakness, your strength might be made perfect. Lord, we thank you for your grace. We thank you for the power of your word. We thank you for the life of the blood of Jesus Christ that is in the body of Jesus Christ. And she has become the very blood of Jesus Christ by the life that is in her. And Lord, may you send us forth from this place with the word that we have heard this morning, anchored within our hearts. With a faith that resonates, greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. And no matter what this world might raise up, the one that is in us will crest every wave. The stabilizers are on the ship. And no matter what storms lay ahead, we shall overcome by the one that has put his life in us. We thank you, Lord, for this time we could be in your house today. Lord, we might not be having a service here tonight. I know brother John will be traveling to minister and perhaps others as well to hear the word in Seattle. May you bless them, Lord. May you pour out your blessings in Seattle. Oh God, may you redeem every redeemable soul. Lord, may you be with Brother Kyle. The service will be just starting up there in Victoria now. Lord, may you bless his ministry. Lord, may you bless it to the benefit of your children over there. Pour in your life in your power, oh God. Lord, here we have no continuing city. We have one purpose, and that's to gather every predestinated seed to the redemptive plan of God. Go with us as we go our way. We love you, Lord. We love your word. We thank you for all you've done for us today in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There's uh believers faith challenge updates that Brother Biscll spoke about this morning for every family. They're in the hallway by the office. You can pick one up there. I'm sure they'll be a blessing to you. The next service here will be Wednesday night at 7:30. Unless we're changed in a body change. That'll be even better. Praise the Lord. Shake hands with one another as you go. The service is dismissed in Jesus name. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.
