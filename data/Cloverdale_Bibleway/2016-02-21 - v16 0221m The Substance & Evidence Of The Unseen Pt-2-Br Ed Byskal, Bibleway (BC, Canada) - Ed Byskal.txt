Brother Bob Vineyard's going to be going in for surgery down in Seattle on the brain on Friday this coming week. So we want to remember the Vineyard family in prayer. Specifically, brother Bob at this time. There's a brother in a church in Bombay, India. his wife is having uh she has cancer on the breast is recovered but is still in much much pain. So just asking that the Lord would be mindful of her need this morning. Sister Virginia prayer request for Sister Evelyn in surgery today in Vancouver General and Sister Ida. Please remember in prayer the mystery expo meetings they'll be having the 25th 26th 27th at s San Carlos city in uh the Philippines. Brother uh the pastor there Rowell Soraniano and 50 other ministers will be demonstrating there at the mystery expo that brother Ernie helped to initiate many many years ago. The truth still marches on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Want to welcome those that are here this morning. I believe I don't have your names here in front of me, but uh God bless you this morning. Amen. It's good to have you here. Your entire family, I believe, is with you. Amen. God bless you. The Lord sees. Amen. Each and everyone that's here, the Lord Jesus has come. Not because I'm here, because you're here. He said, "If two or three would gather in my name, I'll be there in your midst." Amen. Brother John, you go. Let's all just bow our heads and forget about everyone else and just speak to the Lord Jesus today. Our heavenly father, we love you today, God. We just feel your Holy Spirit, Lord, all around. We just feel there's angels wings and the pillar of fire. The glory of the Lord has come down amongst your bride, Lord. And we are hungry. We are thirsty Lord. Our voices are coming up through the blood crying abba father pour out your spirit. Pour out your mercy. Pour out your grace. Extend down your salvation today in this assembly. Extend down your hand of Jehovah Gyra Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. How we love you and adore you Lord. open up our mouths to praise your name right now, Lord, for all the great things that you have done for us, what you're doing for us, what you're going to do. Lord, we just pray that every barrier, every wall, every dark cloud would be broken today. The spirit of Satan and Lucifer would be broken. Shackles of darkness and unbelief that has held for years and complexes and lies would just vanish away, God. Oh father, send your holy spirit by your word today, Lord. Let it be thus sayeth the lord to the souls of the elect, God. Lord Jesus, as we heard your prophet today, an invisible union speaking about the sea of forgetfulness and how our lives were predestinated from before the foundation of the world. We cry back today. We believe that Lord and your predestinated seed has gathered in this room, Lord. We love you, God. We just love your appearing, God. Would you just come down today, God? Oh, Father, demonstrate your attributes of healing today of salvation. God, my heart has been so burdened for hearts of souls of young men, young ladies, Lord, that are lost, not out there, but right here among us, Lord. our very own children, our very own offspring, our very own token promises, Lord. And we have faith, Lord, to believe that you're here today to extend out your hand of forgiveness and mercy. There's lives that have need of a touch, Lord. Family members that are in for operations, tumors or cancers or things are hidden down behind, but Satan is exposed. The great operation and x-ray of the Holy Spirit is going to the heart of the matter today. Lord, root out unbelief among us, God. Root out sin that would be hiding somewhere. That would keep the blessings away. That would keep the flood tides of your glory from coming into this service, God. And when I heard about the sea of forgetfulness, Lord, we have a sea of forgetfulness that not even you can remember our past life anymore. Our sin, our poorness, our lives that were past, wretched and poor and beggarly. But we can jump with all of that's within us into that sea of forgetfulness and have faith to believe. You see nothing but white. You see nothing but lies that love you. You see nothing but lies that believe your every word. Father, may that water come up into this assembly today. May the water of the sea of forgetfulness come into this congregation. May the Tut flies come up into this church. Oh God, may Cloverdale Bible Way have individuals that are jumping into that sear for giftfulness and jumping out with their arms lifted up, praising God, giving hosanas and glories and praises. Our future is glorious. Lord, it's in the bosom and in the arms of our Jehovah God. Our future home calls to us, Father. We have needs among us even in our hearts Lord and we lift our feeble hands these prayer requests Lord we believe Jesus that you are the one that answers every prayer every request Lord and every need even today unspoken is being thunder broadcast through heaven as our thoughts are heard louder in heaven than our words are on earth you know the needs of all of us we pray for our pastor today that you would use the gift in his life. May thus sayeth the Lord move out across this pulpit. Lord Jesus, may the word that we have need of for our body change and for the needs within our lives be spoken today. And may that still small voice echo within our souls. And may it be 100% of a response saying, "Lord, we believe. We thank you, Jesus. We respond, Lord, to your word. Take the hidden things of our hearts and of our lives and uncover them out into your glory. Father, this whole day we sanctify and our visitors that are here and some to be baptized tonight. May the Holy Spirit fill every vessel, fill every heart, oh God, from the youngest to the oldest. May the Holy Spirit move mightily today. We're looking forward to it, Lord Jesus, that by the time the sun would set tonight, there would be miracles and divine healing and your glory would have moved in our souls, Lord. That your word would be great, Father, and do the supernatural among us that we feel already is happening right in this service, God. Be glorified in our lives, Lord. Be praised with our lives, Lord. Give us a glimpse of that other dimension, Jesus. We love your appearing. come again today in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you Lord. Amen. [Music] You deserve the glory [Music] and the honor. Lord, we lift our hands to worship as we praise your holy name. You deserve the glory. Oh, just wanted to praise now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we lift our hands to worship as we praise your holy name. For you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. For you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Amen. And why don't you have your seats this morning as the deacons receive the morning tithes and offerings. Amen. Good morning. God bless you all. It's wonderful to be in the house of God. Amen. as we praise him, glorify the king, and look around the room and see the redeemed being gathered. It's a great blessing to be in the house of God this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a a family that has driven 1500 miles to be here today. That's three days journey. And the only reason for them being here this morning, they want to be baptized. &gt;&gt; So, you might have traveled across Langley, across the border, different things like that. They've driven 1500 miles to be with us. And I would like the Devolt family. And uh Harley, I'd like you to stand up, please. We want to identify you. Brother Tony, Sister Rose, Peter, Harley, Katherine, God bless you. Amen. You have your seats. They traveled and we had the pleasure of meeting them yesterday, spending some time last evening, and they're going to be baptized this evening. So, you know, everybody has a journey. Everybody has how God deals with them. And and we dealt with each one individually, spoken to each one. All we think, well, collectively the family is being baptized. Well, collectively they are, but individually they are. Each one has their individual testimony and how God dealt with them and um they've tried to come up earlier over the last few years to come up to be here. Didn't quite happen, but it's happened this weekend. And uh we deem it a great honor to have you here, brother uh brother Tony with your wife, sister Rose, your children there and of course they're with your children. We have Harley. She's a friend of the families worked with them and she's coming. God deals in mysterious ways his wonders to perform. You wonder why you have a certain employee being employed by a certain employer. Well, God's got a great plan before the foundation of the world. Whether Harley knew it or not, God got a hold of her heart. And that's the main thing, Sister Harley. So, God bless you. Be praying for them this afternoon. And we're not and I told them as we I would tell all the ones that I speak to when we're being baptized. We don't rush into this. This is something that God has revealed to you. You're being moved to a greater depth than Christ. You're fulfilling the word of God. So, spend a day, as they've been spending three days driving, just desiring that God would fill them with the Holy Ghost and fire. And that will be our prayer also. That'll be a special time tonight. So we want to welcome you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And God bless you for making the great journey. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my song. We don't want to take any more time this morning. Uh it's nice to sing, but we want to take advantage of our pastor today. Amen. We don't want him to feel rushed. I trust that you've come expecting and you're going to have your attention solely devoted on the word this morning. Pull on the gift of God. His age doesn't matter when the Holy Ghost comes. &gt;&gt; He's timeless. &gt;&gt; Amen. The vessel might be a little bit weary afterwards, but we'll all be benefited and we'll pray that the Lord will restore him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing this together? This is one of our favorite songs that we enjoy singing because this is our life. This is our story. as we invite our pastor to come this morning. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foraste of glory divine. of salvation. Presence of God, Lord of His love. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my soul. my savior [Music] on my side. Angels [Music] whisper. [Music] This is my story. This is my song. [Music] Myior. This is my This is my song. Praising myior. [Music] Oh, it's very personal now. It's time I savior am happy and blessed. We're watching and waiting. We're looking. [Music] This is my story. This is my song. Oh myior. This is my This is my praising my [Music] story. Praising my soul. [Music] Praising my savior. [Music] This is my soul. [Music] This is my praising myior. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So nice to see you all here. &gt;&gt; More than that, he's here. &gt;&gt; He's the important one. He's the supreme one. We're so happy to have the Debolt family with us. God bless you. I've traveled so far and we're happy to participate and we're proud to have you here to be baptized. God bless you. I pray that God will just give you a double portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; I I just can't get away from the song. I would like to sing the chorus, at least maybe the first verse in the chorus, glory to his name. &gt;&gt; And you know how that came about. I was just thinking about everything that God has done supernaturally in every life. &gt;&gt; And all I could say is glory to his name. &gt;&gt; I'm so wondrously safe from sin. Amen. Why don't we just sing it and get ready for the word? You'll sing it. Where my savior died now, I heart. Glory to glory to his name. Glory to glory to my heart. Glory to you once again. Glory to his name. Glory to his name. There to my heart was the God of mine. Glory to his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll just bow our heads for a moment. Heavenly Father, as we are now approaching your word, how your prophet so often spoke of you as they approach the word, the author of the word and any man can turn the pages of the book, but only you can reveal and make known. &gt;&gt; You have a part. You have a portion, &gt;&gt; an allotted part for every person. You are a god of the that of of the individual. You dealt with the individual. You called each of us by name. You knew exactly what we needed. And now we are here today, Lord, and you have watched over our footsteps. You've brought us right to this time and to this season. I pray that you will impart, oh God, drive home the word, Father, that will give us courage and give us strength for the day and this time that we're in in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint both speaker and hearers, we pray for your glory. May thy kingdom be built up and strengthened in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. And I'll have you turn in the Bible if you would please to John the 5th chapter and we're going to read uh then we're going to read two verses out of John 10 as well. So John 5 and verse 17 18 and 19 we'll read. I want to carry on from a subject of a couple weeks ago uh the substance and evidence of the unsane. And we'll be reading that scripture also out of Hebrews 1 11 and1 verse 17 of John 5. But Jesus answered them, "My father workketh hitherto, and I work." Therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him, because not only he not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his father, making himself equal with God. Then answered Jesus and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do, for what thingsoever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." So I want us to see that this does not only apply to Jesus Christ, but it applies to his children, &gt;&gt; to us as believers. And I have a phrase that we will be using throughout the service. He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say that. &gt;&gt; He doeth the works. I refer to when God spoke to you, he doeth the works. When God drew you, he doeth the work. &gt;&gt; When God supernaturally changed your life &gt;&gt; and God has led you in such a remarkable way. And we are not gathered here by accident. &gt;&gt; We are gathered here by design. And so we need to speak to him who is the designer and the sculptor. We've come from many different places, different countries, different backgrounds, different uh societies, different cultures. Uh very very different, vastly different, but yet we're melded together into this particular unit. And there is a particular design and order to it. And it's he has done the work. He doeth it. He doeth the work. Uh and so I I just see it ongoing ongoing. And I will be speaking something about that and it's very very remarkable. Then we'll turn to John 14 verse 10. Verse 10. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me. Here it is, he doeth the works. Every person that has God, the spirit of God dwelling in them, they need to say and keeping always in mind, he doeth the works. &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very work's sake. I believe this was when Philip had just asked, "Show us the Father." And you'll find some places in the message where the prophet of God says, "Would you like to see the father?" &gt;&gt; "Would you like to see him?" &gt;&gt; And then just scroll down to the bottom of the message and you'll find &gt;&gt; that he was he was showing them the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then if we'll look please at 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter just one verse. 2 Corinthians 4 and we'll read verse 18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Let's read that verse together. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, and the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may have your seats, and please keep your Bibles handy and open if you wouldn't mind. Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 11:1, "Now faith is the substance." Uh, I want you to think in terms of this substance. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. But it's also the evidence. And now I spoke the last time largely on the substance. God having to indwell the substance. And uh I just have many many scriptures where uh David said, "My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously rot in the lowest parts of the earth. My substance was not hid from thee." God said to Jeremiah, "Before you were conceived in the womb, before thy mother conceived thee, I ordained thee to be a prophet." Before the substance even came into being, he was already designed, ordained for certain certain and and God would see to it that that uh brother Bren talked about us being pre-planned. He said, "I guess you know that we were repl pre-planned." And he goes into that. And so that is not such a complicated thought for us. But I find that we go about our daily duties once we go out these doors and we start our daily duties etc. We kind of lose sight of those things of the eternal aspect and what we've been designed for and what we've been brought here for. And I want to bring that into some focus. And then I want to speak about the evidence. And just to give you a heads up, you know, evidence is what's provided in courts. And uh evidence can either free a person or damn a person. &gt;&gt; And it is doing that. &gt;&gt; It is doing that. So the subject that I would like to dwell on is the life of the unseen God. living in the substance of flesh or human flesh. The life of the unseen God living in the substance of flesh. So in Hebrews when we read the 11th chapter, it's a record of ordinary people, which I said the last time I spoke, they're ordinary people who believed what God promised and became the evidence of things unseen. &gt;&gt; Just to describe that to you, Abraham believed the promise. He's the father of us all. He believed the promise. You know, we're all believing for something. We're all desiring something. We all have something that we're we're yearning for, we're anxious for, we're desiring, or we're holding to. I know that each one of us, if we had a if we had a moment maybe across the table from one another, that would finally come out. What I really desire from God is this. What I'm really hungering for is this. I'm for someone in my family or for something to take place or some burden that we have. Each one of us had that. And if we had the opportunity to come before the prophet of God, that would be the thing that would be on our heart. And often uh you'll hear brother Brandham saying, "Now you're real nervous." And then he'll say, "But let's just talk. I'd like to talk to you for a moment." and because and and then a moment later he'd say now yes you're real nervous but that's not really what you're here for. You're here for and often I ran across it several times yesterday and the day before but what you're really here for you're praying for someone. You're praying for a child. Uh I see it's a crippled child. It's a daughter. You're praying for a son. No, it's your son-in-law. Uh and he's been in the war. He was in Korea. And that's really now he's touching the &gt;&gt; Now he's touching really the deep spot. See, and God knows that deep spot while we're sitting here. &gt;&gt; And that's why I want you to bring, you know, to bring you right out of any shell that you might be in. God knows exactly what it is that is, you know, maybe something that you wouldn't even speak or express to anyone else, but you're holding it. God sees that. God knows that and God's on the in the business of changing things. &gt;&gt; God's in the business of transforming. He has already given us. It's just in fact is brother Brandham speaks about things. He said now if you were here for finances or here for something else he talked about maybe helping them believe for that. But he said as far as healing I can't heal you. I couldn't heal you. I'm just a man. If Jesus was standing here in my suit, he couldn't heal you because he's already done it. &gt;&gt; The the the the challenge is to get you to believe what's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now you're already here. You're already assembled. You've already been born. I don't mean assembled here in this congregation, but you've been born. You've been brought into this world. But the big question is, why have you been brought here? Well, I was brought here to hear this word. Wonderful. Exactly. And now you've heard the word. Now why are we here? Well, God has a program. And that's what's important for us to grasp is God, you've got a program for me. And there's something important and there's something eternal. Help me to help me to evaluate things the way that they should be valued. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Old Testament saints were the they their lives comprised the evidence of things that were not seen. Essentially they were the substance that testified of the existence of the only true God. &gt;&gt; That's what they did. Their lives testified or gave witness to the existence of the only true God. In this in the message the prophet said in ministry explained I cannot do a thing about it until he comes. You see I'm just as helpless as any creature in the world until he comes. Now there's even a prophet saying I'm helpless. I'm just a man. You're just a man. You're just a woman. You're just a person. We can't do anything. But when he comes, it's amazing what happens. &gt;&gt; And it's important that we realize and I hope to have you understand before this service is over where you will sense his presence. And that's that's the challenge for any minister is to bring you to the place where there's there's such a presence. &gt;&gt; There's such a presence. I'll be coming to in fact is I'll just feel to do it now. Brother Brandham was in a meeting and I guess it was in Germany because they had a translator, German translator and they were bringing up a a a line of people to be prayed for and there was about uh three or four he said on the platform and the the one they had helping the young man they had helping they said he wasn't too experienced and there was a little girl and and he could hear her mumbling something and uh he said he just picked her up and put her up on the platform. The platform was quite high and she was kind of near the edge of the platform. So, Brother Brandham reached to uh to get her because uh I don't know he just reached because she he said she was very near the edge of the platform and maybe a little later on the service if we have time I'll read that for you. But as he and then as she she kind of took a hold of his sleeve. He said, "I was wearing the same." He said, "I'm I'm wearing the same suit tonight. I was wearing them." He said, "I I got the suit from Oslo." And he said, "And she took a hold of my arm and and kind of took a hold of me." And he said, "Then uh then he saw she was blind." And he was concerned about her. And he and he and he just took her up in his arms and he said, "She just poor little thing." He said, "She just laid her head on my shoulder and she was snubbing, I guess, maybe just and uh that's the word he used. She was just kind of snubbing on his shoulder." And uh he began to uh rub his hand, just take his hand and stroke it down her platted hair like that. And he said, "Poor little thing." And uh and he he he started to pray for her. and he was I don't know what was going through his mind but he he started to pray for her and uh God opened her eyes but when she got put up by the man on the platform she had said to him I want to I want to feel the man I want I want to see the man that's going to pray for me and uh uh so they were having to go back and forth between the interpreter or the translator and then when he prayed for her and and her eyes were opened and and he looked at her eyes and and she he he said her eyes were starting to sparkle. Her eyes were sparkling and uh and she said, "I want to see mommy." And uh and her mom then, you know, things began to happen. Her mother screamed out in the audience and the vision is still now the prophet of God is still in another realm. And he he said, "I see her mother. Her mother's down here in the audience. I see her mother." Now, he's seeing it in the vision, but she's actually there. And here's this girl seeing it for the first time. And her mother is and the girl starts to cry. And her mother start her the little one when her eyes were first open, she said she she was saying, "What is that?" And she was it was the lights. And she hadn't seen lights before. So he said, "What is that?" And and the German interpreter has to interpret for for her, for him, for brother Brandham. And then the mother starts coming up and uh and and the girl, that's the first time she sees her mother and she said, "You're so beautiful." She said, "You're so beautiful." And brother Brandham says that the atmosphere &gt;&gt; see you might say, "Well, that was a wonderful miracle." No, the atmosphere, he said the atmosphere and the influence was so great it paralyzed the devil. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, here we are. We're not children. We're adults. &gt;&gt; And we have a record and we know it's true. &gt;&gt; And I say it's incumbent upon us as believers. We believe this. We believe this word. We believe this unseen God. We believe that he is present. We believe he's actually right beside every single person. And he knows exactly what's in your heart. And as we open ourselves up to him and say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; you're the one who designed me. &gt;&gt; You made me a man. You made me a boy. You made me a girl. You made me a woman. You made me the married person that I am. You know exactly where I'm at and all of the things that have happened to and for and against and all these other things. You know all the battles I've gone through. You know all the experiences I've experienced. You know every single one of them. And you'll bring glory out of it. &gt;&gt; I say to you, let's paralyze the devil &gt;&gt; with an atmosphere here today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We'll not give him any glory. We'll paralyze the devil in the name of Jesus Christ. Glory. &gt;&gt; You talk about atmosphere. That's what we want in this service. Atmosphere, not an atmosphere of skepticism or criticism or unbelief. We'll let that go. &gt;&gt; Paralyze him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus the son, &gt;&gt; Jesus the son saw what the father he saw the father act and he acted likewise. &gt;&gt; God in the substance of the flesh of the son of God Jesus Christ performed the supernatural God in your flesh. &gt;&gt; That's why he gave you flesh &gt;&gt; so that he could dwell in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Evidence of the unseen folding here in the realm of the mortals giving us faith in the season of immortality for the rapture journey. &gt;&gt; Would you like me to read that again? &gt;&gt; I say evidence of the unseen. The evidence unfolding here. I believe in the evidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand uh the scripture says that when the when the comforter come &gt;&gt; he will con he will reprove the world of sin. How will he reprove it? In you. &gt;&gt; And that's why you're not so popular. &gt;&gt; Jesus said the world will hate you. &gt;&gt; Why will they hate you? They may not even express it. They but but if you cut a certain spot, you touch a certain spot, you'll find out that they're in opposition. &gt;&gt; They're not on the same page as you. They don't enjoy the same things as you. They don't enjoy the same conversation as you. I was up on a hunting trip once just come to my mind and there was a stranger there, another hunter from some other place and I don't know where he was in the world but anyway and the guy just sent us on. It was Lane Southwick. He sent us on just to walk together to a certain place. So he's walking and this man had a foul mouth. He was just a cursing and damning all the way and you know and we talked for a little short time and he said what what do you do Ed? I said I'm minister. Oh he said my he was he was absolutely I didn't have to say anything. He condemned himself. Oh my. He said you should have told me earlier. He said I've been I've been speaking some pretty awful language. I said well you might as well be what you are. You know, I didn't want him just to shine up to be good just for me. He might as well be what he is because he was his own condemnation. &gt;&gt; You see, the thing is, &gt;&gt; you're evidence &gt;&gt; and you're evidence that there's a holy God. &gt;&gt; You're evidence that there's another kingdom. You're evidence that Jesus Christ himself has been revealed. You're evidence that there's power in the word to transform a nature, a character. You're evidence of that and the more you give yourself to it, the more real it will be. That's the evidence. Your evidence of the unseen &gt;&gt; in at this time and in this season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for the word that God has brought. Now, there's uh I read this to you last week, but I don't want to just read it to you. Uh, I want to I want you to see it on the See, it's the next one. The angel of God, right? All right. Now, many times this is all coming up at once and I would prefer just one at a time. just to give you uh I'd like to have you turn your turn your imagination turn your spirits loose if you would please. Many times out in the buildings you'll hear me call people and say things said I see it materialize the very life before me materializes. I'd just like to stop there. Don't read any further for a moment. The life and I'm going to I'm going to read where where the prophet of God says now he says uh I'm just giving this from memory. He said now this this star this old star that we're on. He said it God in the beginning moved it around and moved it around the sun and hung it there. He said maybe for a hundred billion years and he's hanging it there and then some gases were formed and then rolled it around. Then some calcium and volcanics burst forth and different things and he said, "What's he doing? What was he doing? He said he's making you &gt;&gt; and me. Now, now I know we could shut that all down and block it out of our minds, but I'm going to bring it down. If a prophet could look back and say to a person standing here at the platform, now when you were a child, he said to one woman, he said, "Can I say it?" He asked her if he could say it. Well, yes. I guess he got okay from her. He said, "When you were a child, when you were just a girl, you fell down a well." &gt;&gt; Imagine. He He's He's not seeing a vision. It's not It's not some technical or television. He's He was actually there. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. You don't know what it is to go back in a person's life and to stand there. And that's why he doesn't know. If you see the if you see the deep calls the deep, next time you see it, you watch him and he's talking to this woman and he's shaking his head. You know why he's shaking his head? He doesn't know whether he's back there or here. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know whether is this the He says, "Is this the person? Is this the patient?" Cuz he doesn't know where is it. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's why he says it just tears a person up. Now I'm coming to you. So he says to this lady because you you when you were a child you fell down a well and they've operated and trying to find out what's wrong but loose loosened your organs inside and they can't find what's wrong. Now if a person can go back if God takes a designs a person says you're going to go back in this person's life maybe see us as children see us at some junction in our life if you can go back 10 years what's wrong going back a hundred years &gt;&gt; if a person go back a hundred years because they're made they're made that way. Maybe went back a 100red billion years. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And saw he said, "I see a life materializing." Said, "It's a girl. It's a girl." And then he follows it and he says, "Then then things happen. Maybe the girl got into trouble. Maybe she had difficulties. Maybe all kinds of things. But God now God I want you to see who it is that has actually God used to speak this message that called you. &gt;&gt; I need you to see that this wasn't designed you're not here designed by your mother and father. &gt;&gt; This had nothing to do with where you came from or the country you came from or your parents or your roots. It has nothing to do with that. Your roots are in mind of God. That's where the roots are. &gt;&gt; And God had a mind. God had an intent. And it's God that's designed things. And it's God that brought you maybe brought you to this church cuz you needed to rub shoulders with somebody because God in his mind of he's putting things together. He knew exactly what you needed. &gt;&gt; And I would say we ought to give glory to him. He knew that I needed to be right here &gt;&gt; at this moment to hear these words. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, Brother Biscll, do you really think what you're saying is that important?" Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; I actually do. I believe it's that important. And I believe that this God that speaks to this prophet has brought you here. You You were attracted to a message, but brought you here. And he knew exactly what you were needing and for your journey for this change of the body or this rapture journey or whatever it is that we're facing. Whether it's a battle you're facing tomorrow or the enemy you're facing tomorrow, you need to hear what's being said today. &gt;&gt; And we need a better we need a better understanding of God. &gt;&gt; And so he said, I see a life materializing. I said to my wife at the table, I said, "Maybe that was back just when there was some chemicals, some phosphorus or something out of the earth. He was making you." He said he was making me. &gt;&gt; Is that just something poetic or is that actually truth? So I said to her, I said, "When did he see this girl? When did he see this life materializing?" And then it doesn't stop there. He said I see it materialize. The very life before me materializes. Says maybe I start here and look yonder. He said I see a little girl say he's just using an example. said, "See, I see a little girl say and uh I'll and it'll start materializing and I see the way she's and he breaks because maybe things take place and happen something happens and I'll just start speaking what I see and then after a while I'll leave. it'll leave before me and maybe right along here sets the woman. Now he's saying a life materializing coming into being and and and materializing is is coming into existence or uh it's it's appearing. I see it materializing and it's it's a little girl and then it'll materialize and I and then and the woman is sitting right here. And he goes on further. He continues. He's describing it. This is the best description I've ever found. And he said, "She's done come down to this age and I see where she's at." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, we got something to deal with. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to get out of your mind forever that you're just here. You're just working at a job. You're just employed. You're making your way through life. And the reason why we don't get things from God is we don't know who he is. &gt;&gt; We need to understand who we are. We need to actually understand and you cannot put enough emphasizes emphasis on the purchase of the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Not just the blood of Jesus Christ but the blood of God. You have to see him as God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say both brother Brandham and the woman are evidence of the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "I I'm seeing and and you'll find I I'll ask you just for a moment. I'll ask you, what ministers have you ever heard use the word materializing? &gt;&gt; I see a life." And and I guarantee you, you'll never hear them say, "I see a life materializing. &gt;&gt; I see something materializing." And then identify, "Oh, here it is. Right here. &gt;&gt; Here's the woman sitting right here. God God has done brought her down to this age. &gt;&gt; Isn't that remarkable? And I'll say, God has done brought you down to this age. &gt;&gt; God brought you right down to this very age. And what was his purpose? That you might hear his word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 10, I'm just going to read some scripture. If I do not the works of my father, see these are his works. That's why I had you quote, "He doeth the works." &gt;&gt; I say, "Where did you come from?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I come from Congo or I came from a colony or I came from I came from northern Canada or I came from Oh, you don't know where I've been. I've been in some dark places. He's the one that brought you out of it. &gt;&gt; He's the one who delivered you. &gt;&gt; He's the one who set you here amongst angels, &gt;&gt; amongst sons and daughters of God. He has done that because he's not done and he plans to take you to his kingdom and you'll be in his kingdom. It's not just some words in a song. I've got a mansion over the hilltop or I'll walk on streets of purest gold. All of those things, those are maybe figments of somebody's imagination. But there's a reality right beside us. There's another kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not the administration in Washington. It's not the government in Ottawa. It's not the uh it's not the union in the European Union. It's none of these things. this world will go on with its strife and its economics and its failures and all of those things. We have nothing to do with this world. We're from another world. We're from another kingdom and we need to be mindful of that kingdom. We can't let we not can't let Satan displace us or displace what's important in the kingdom of God with with all the things of this material world. This is his kingdom. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Says, "If I do not the works of my father, believe me not. But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him." Therefore, they sought again to take him, but he escaped out of their hand. And in Colossians, it speaks of Christ who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. And then Apostle Paul carries on the same the same theme. He said, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." And now is that only given to Apostle Paul or can you take your name and said Christ liveth in me. &gt;&gt; The father liveth in me. &gt;&gt; The father doeth the works. &gt;&gt; The kind of vision that you might have might not be when we think of vision we think of maybe something like a television screen. Get that out of your mind. It might be just uh it might be something you can't even define but you have a certain uh impulse a certain direction. I said uh I was speaking to a wife. I said what brought us from Ontario here. &gt;&gt; I said it was a vision. God didn't give me a vision. You're going to do this and you're going to do that and define it. But I just I I I you know enough that you have to you have to pick up and leave. Brother Joe Walder. Sister Eileen, uh, you know that you have to do it. You've read something, you've touched something, uh, and you don't know that your family is going to be affected. You just don't know that your children are going to be so affected by this word. And, and you following something unseen. You're you're a seed or son or daughter of of of of Abraham, and you're walking where you don't know you're going to walk. You don't know it's going to be this way, but God knows. He's not taken by surprise. I see your sister Sharon Andes and from Australia and you marry John Andy sitting here as a as a minister's wife. How does God know those things? Brother Andes, I'm I'm talking about a lot of people today that are sitting here in this congregation. I want you to see it's this God that God saw you. Oh, there I see a I see a life materializing. I see a boy materializing. I see a life of a man materializing. Hallelujah. And maybe they I'll I'll move upon them somehow and they'll drive all the way from Colorado to be baptized. And that just think of it. Is that an accident or is that a reality that God had in his mind? And then you must say, well, what is God's mind? What is in God's mind? And now he had a prophet messenger to bring such astounding and profound things out of the message full of secrets and full of uh full of nuggets that are treasures absolute treasures. You can't read this Bible like a paperback book. You can't read this Bible like a newspaper. This is full of the mysteries of God. Hallelujah. And it took a messenger to be able, he said, "Now in the back part of God's mind, in Christ is the mystery of God revealed." In the back part of God's mind, I can tell you that in that message that contains things that were in the back part of God's mind, you you try to read it and think, "Well, I'll just read this and I'll just, you know, be able to get it all." No, you won't get it all. You ponder it and you pray about it and you think about it and you dwell on it maybe for days or even weeks and even over a period of years it just expands and expands. But sometimes I say, "Oh God, what you had in your mind? &gt;&gt; Make us to know what you had in your mind for me." And we get all taken up with this all this problem and this little thing and my job and oh forget it. God who hung this old star that we're walking on for a hundred billion years and saw some gases come up like a great contractor. He said, "I'm making my family." &gt;&gt; No wonder he says to Isaiah, no wonder he say speaks to Isaiah and says, "Where's my household? Where's my family? The earth, he said, my hands have made the heavens. The earth is my foottool, but where's my household? Where's my children? Where's my family? &gt;&gt; He'd been planning you for a long time. He'd been planning this congregation for a long time. He'd been planning way back in the eternities. He'd been planning, I'm going to have a certain person, going to have a certain individual, and this individual is going to love me. [Applause] When people hate me, they're going to love me. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; They're going to know my presence. They're going to love my presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is God's prophet, messenger, the unseen God. the unseen God. &gt;&gt; If you have to move or leave, don't leave too long. &gt;&gt; The unseen God through the prophet substance &gt;&gt; giving absolute evidence of the resurrection of his beloved son Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? Amen. &gt;&gt; The unseen God through the substance through the physical substance of a prophet of God, his messenger in this age, giving absolute evidence of the resurrection of the of his beloved son Jesus Christ. He said, "It's not me." He said, uh, like the pool of Bethesda, likening himself to the pool of Bethesda, he said it couldn't say, the pool of Bethesda couldn't say, "Look what a great water I am." &gt;&gt; For when the angel went off of the water, it was just water. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I'm just your brother." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's good to realize that we're just flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; We're a brother to a brother. We're a brother to another sister. We're one another. But it goes beyond that. And by the grace of God. And when the angel of the Lord moves down, it becomes then the voice of God to you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation get that? Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when as then when the angel of the Lord moves down, it becomes the voice of God to you. I want to say to you as individuals, you walk around, but when you're full of the Holy Ghost and filled with the spirit of God and sensitive to that spirit, whether you're on the job or whether you're in your business or on your farm or wherever you are, and you realize that there are there is a moment when the spirit of God comes down &gt;&gt; and then that's the voice of God to that person. I had the experience a couple weeks ago. &gt;&gt; I'm driving down the freeway. I'd heard that a certain person wanted to speak to me. And when I'm driving down the highway, the Holy Spirit spoke to this heart. Said he wants to make things right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I went out in the valley, spoke to a man who just had some infection in his body. His wife was there. He said, "I should have spoke to you before." I said, "Yeah, but that wasn't your mistake." I said, "Your mistake was you left." &gt;&gt; I said, "Why did you leave?" And his wife was sitting right beside me. I said, "Was it you or was it him?" That was a mistake. &gt;&gt; Were you the one that did it or was he the one? No, he said I was the one. I said that was your mistake. Not that you didn't come and talk to me, but that you left. I got a text yesterday. The man didn't know it. He didn't know it, but he has stage four cancer. He's been given six months to live. Tell you what, friends, we're not playing a game down here. &gt;&gt; And when God, the Holy Spirit comes and speaks to a person, and he spoke to me twice, while I'm still driving &gt;&gt; and said, "And don't you lighten up on it. &gt;&gt; Don't you lighten up. Don't you make this just, you know, oh, that's fine. It's easy. It's not that. You scrape it down to the bottom." And I saw myself scraping it right to the bottom. So as soon as that was said, I said that was not your mistake. Your mistake was and I said that was what was wrong. He said and I and I told him that God told me he wants to make it right. He says I do. I want you to forgive me. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that in the back part of God's mind, he knows exactly where a person's going and how long he has to stay here and what he needs to do. And he is as abundant grace of God. Isn't it marvelous that he comes in such a way and speaks to an individual and gives them the added grace &gt;&gt; to make it right before he comes into his presence. I say, "Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God." [Music] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're not playing some little kind of a game. We're in the biggest business in the land. I don't care where you work or what you do. That's secondary to what we have we have a commission to do. This is in the business of soul saving. This is in the business of delivering men and women out of the grip of Satan. Satan, we paralyze you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And the water can't say what a great water I am at Beth Bethesda." &gt;&gt; And he said, "After the Holy Spirit's gone, it's just water." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I've if I offended you by saying that," he said, "forgive me, but I felt that might be resented, but I am God's voice to you. &gt;&gt; I say that again. that time was under inspiration and I felt bad about the first time. Think of it. He said, "I'm God's voice to you." And he felt bad about it because there was so much resentment from someone in the congregation. But he said, "I'll say it again. I am God's voice to you." And I don't have any resentment at this time. Glory to God. Hallelujah. When you speak the truth, you might as well stay with the truth. &gt;&gt; You're God's blessing. You're God's blessing to the earth. Think about Abraham. He had to say, "Because I I who blesses you, I will bless and who curses you, I will curse. Out of you will come kings and nations." Think about it. A man with his sheep and his camels and with his donkeys saying, "I'm kings are in me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without being proud, he realizes his position. You're a son of God. &gt;&gt; You were being made a hundred billion years ago. &gt;&gt; Some gases were coming forth or potsh was coming or whatever was coming. I have people who ever said, you know, he the brother Brandham speaks about uh the cosmic light and different things that are in us and petroleum. And this man was very educated man. And he says, "We don't have any petroleum in us." Well, I don't know. If we got squished out on the road, there might be some petroleum there. Who would I sooner believe? &gt;&gt; I sooner believe somebody who says, "Well, I got a doctor's degree." I say, "I sooner have a prophet's degree." said, "I can say nothing of myself, &gt;&gt; but what he shows me, &gt;&gt; I say it. &gt;&gt; You believe it, and watch what happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen." &gt;&gt; Now, the evidence. Evidence, as I said earlier, there's two sides to evidence. Evidence can free a person. Evidence can condemn a person. And when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment to come. I have those scriptures here. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away, Jesus said. And if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he has come, and when he has come, and people say, "Oh, I'm full of the Holy Ghost." Well, get trouble. Get ready for trouble because it says that when he has come, he will reprove the world of sin, of unbelief, in other words, and of righteousness and of judgment. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello, congregation. when the Holy Ghost and and if we just said, "How many here have the Holy Ghost?" And I might get quite a few hands up. Well, if you have the Holy Ghost, one thing that he's going to do is reprove the world of sin. &gt;&gt; Your life, you don't have to even say it. Your life will reprove the world of sin. &gt;&gt; Your life will convict them of sin and uncleanness. Your life will do it. All you have to do is you can live a message and your message will be screaming out louder than I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of sin because they believe not on me. Of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more. He becomes unseen. You become a testimony. A testament of what is unseen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The invisible God becomes visible as visible as they're going to see it. &gt;&gt; No wonder that man, brother Milco Yugoslavia, called the Bible man, called the man of God, walks into a house in the middle of the night, snow on the ground, and that's how they could see his stature in the doorway is a large man, quite tall. and a girl 15 years old is is uh sleeping on the hearth of the fireplace. I looked at the fireplace, my wife looked at it, we had bread in that woman's house, 200y old home, and when that man stood in the door and the stepfather of this girl was alcoholic. If you want to read about her life, the books are in the bookstore entitled Of Whom the World is Not Worthy. Don't start reading it in the evening because you'll be reading it and throughout the night. How many have read the book of Whom the World is Not Worthy? Quite a few. Well, we we've had lunch with that sister and heard about her life. In fact, as I filmed it, the film's somewhere up here. Don't ask me to produce something, but it we do have it. And that man came and stood in the door and he said, "This night, has Jesus Christ come to this home?" &gt;&gt; I would say one thing. I don't know anything about his background, but he certainly had a revelation of what he was there for. He certainly knew why he was there. And many years later he married that 15year-old girl and that was her. He became known as the Bible man. Walked all over Yugoslavia for former Yugoslavia giving out Bibles and preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Today he doeth the works. Oh, and the message why we're not a denomination. I'm I'm trying to abbreviate this a wee bit. He said he moved around this old star that we're living on now where you are. And uh he said this earth and he molded over here by the sun and laid it around the sun. Say here's the sun. He molded it on this side and let it hang there for a 100red billion years. What was he making? Some gases. He moved around on this side. He made something else. What was he making there? Some potach. He moved around this way. And what was he doing here? Making some calcium. He asks, "What was he doing?" He was making you and me. &gt;&gt; That's our father. &gt;&gt; Our father which art in heaven. You had a plan. Let your kingdom come. So glad that you saw this little might of a person on this old star. You called me. &gt;&gt; I even heard your voice. &gt;&gt; You called me. Did you hear his voice? &gt;&gt; Is that why you're here? &gt;&gt; Then he's not done with his plan. Oh friends, don't let the little insignificant stuff of this world &gt;&gt; displace or derail or preoccupy your mind. Give God first place. &gt;&gt; And he said, what was he doing like the contractor laying out all of his 2x4s and 2x8s, his cheating, his sighting? He said he knowed just how many buildings he was going to build. &gt;&gt; I got a little ways to go. Are you all right? &gt;&gt; He knew how just how many. He knows that just how many. And that's why the prophet says the last one when the last one comes in was the last building he built. The last one he had in his mind. When the last one comes in, we're done. &gt;&gt; We're out of here. &gt;&gt; He says we're made out of the 16 elements of the earth. And he was making us all and laying us out there before the world ever come into. And then he breaks off. He let them old volcanics brood up there for a hundred million years to make some calcium. What is it? It's part of you. And then in one of his last messages, things that are to be, you hear these words, friends, I'm so glad that God had such a a messenger that was so elusive to the world &gt;&gt; that the businessmen couldn't catch it, scholars couldn't catch it. Theologians couldn't catch it. Fishermen did. &gt;&gt; The unlearned did. The poor had the gospel preached to them. I'm glad that we're poor, simple, humble people. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. God's people are humble people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be preaching like this if we were in amongst a defied, refined, or dignified group of people. We We want We want it just the way it's spoken. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it may not fit the world, but in the last message, he said, "In things that are to be, your birth, your birth here was pre-planned." I assume you had a birth here someplace, &gt;&gt; did you not? &gt;&gt; Yes, it was pre-planned. &gt;&gt; Oh, you said, "Well, my mother conceived me." No, no, no. It was pre-planned long before that. That's right. &gt;&gt; God was setting out his building. His the contractors building the billies who puts all the material and the substance together. The substance the substance had to come and in the initial b in initial months you were just a twitching muscles and so on and so forth. But that God saw that substance coming together and your mother had to eat certain things to let a certain substance come and then you came into the world and God arranged that you would have a human spirit. &gt;&gt; Then God even arranged that a prophet would be able to stand before giving the words from this unseen one would say now he's here. &gt;&gt; He's here. I take every spirit under my control for the glory of God. Do you believe that he took your spirit under control? And I say, "Oh God, come here this day and take our human spirits under control so that the Holy Ghost will have full control." Oh, this human spirit is so ugly. It's so at war with the Holy Spirit. Let the Holy Spirit come. Let all the figment of your imagination depart out of your mind and say what God has said and what his messenger said. I accept that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of this building today saying God planned me. &gt;&gt; I've been planned maybe hundreds of billions of years ago. God devised and God thought every aspect of me. He knew exactly who my parents would be and how I would come down the lineage of time and they would send a messenger that would say, "I see a girl. &gt;&gt; I see a life materializing. &gt;&gt; It's a girl." &gt;&gt; Oh, and then she and then this some things have happened. &gt;&gt; There isn't a man. There isn't a woman here. But some things happened. Even you young people, some things happen. He knows all about it. There is no way out of the things that happen except his way. &gt;&gt; You leave it to him to sort out. &gt;&gt; Some things happened. Some things happened to my kids. Some things happened to my wife. Something's happened to my husband. Something's happened in my life. Something's happened in my job. It cannot disturb or distress or derail a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Release your faith and paralyze the devil. &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to do that? &gt;&gt; Oh, I love to There's no there's nothing clean in him. &gt;&gt; There's no truth in him. So why don't we as sons and daughters of God paralyze the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your birth was pre-planned. I guess you believe that everyone of everyone knows our birth was pre-planned. Your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought. Everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world. How he would just make a little statement. &gt;&gt; It's so profound and such depth there's no human mind can grasp it. But at least we believe it. Jesus said unto him, "Have I been so long time with you?" You've heard this. Now I'm going to be repeating some scripture. And yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the father. &gt;&gt; That's a statement &gt;&gt; for a man who's just a by what the public thought a carpenter's son. And and if we were there, it would be it would be very very dangerous for to see for us to see him as a carpenter's son. But but it's it's one thing to read it in the Bible, but it's another thing to put yourself back there and say, "I would see him as a son of God." Would you &gt;&gt; would you see him as a son of God? I'm asking some pointed questions because you need to ask yourself that today. Who am I saying? &gt;&gt; Who am I listening to? I'm hearing Brother Ed. Are you? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm hearing Brother Tom or Brother John or Brother Brother Tim. I'm I'm hearing maybe I'm hearing somebody else. in the family. &gt;&gt; It might just be that God's speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God's urging you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believest thou not that I am come. I am in the Father and the Father in me. The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works. Now, you're a mature congregation. I have some things to say. I will go into the Old Testament in the book of Exodus. Follow this very close now because it has to do even in the building you're sitting in. In the book of Exodus, God spoke to Moses and said, "Have the people build build me a sanctuary, and you'll do it this way, and you'll have staves, and you'll have poles, and you'll have sockets, you'll have silver, then you'll have a holy of holies, you'll have skins of goats, all of these things. And you'll build build me the sanctuary." I'll never forget a brother that came up and I think preached right behind this pulpit and said that when the nations around maybe came over the hill and said, "What what's that? What what's that structure?" And then you as an Israelite would say, "Well, that's where our God lives." Really? Come on. What was the difference when a little lad, little boy with a bad reputation, his mom was pregnant with him when she was just a teenager. &gt;&gt; That's all they knew. &gt;&gt; And that was true. &gt;&gt; But that's all they knew. &gt;&gt; They didn't know the background. They didn't know that this boy's father saw this substance coming together hundreds of billions of years ago. &gt;&gt; This was going to be the redemption. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with sin. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the killing blow to the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to crush the head of the serpent. &gt;&gt; All of this. No wonder he was rejoicing just watching over that son. You think he'd let anything happen to him? Not a chance. You think he'd let anything happen to you and I as believers? Not a chance. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Rise up, saints of God. Paralyze the devil. &gt;&gt; He's a liar from the beginning, and he has no truth in him. &gt;&gt; And here come here come this man. He got cold. He got hungry. He wept. He sweat when he was hot. He got tired. He went to sleep in a boat. Say, "Who who is this?" Oh, they don't say, "Oh, that's my Jesus." No, that isn't what they were saying. This is This is a young prophet. Prophet? Really? Well, not only that, we believe the scripture &gt;&gt; says that he's God in flesh. &gt;&gt; God in flesh. Oh my goodness. They couldn't they couldn't they couldn't handle that. &gt;&gt; But when he was turning bread into he's turning cook bread and feeding the people and they were taking up baskets and baskets more. Am I making this real to you? They said, "Wouldn't he make a great king?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want him to be a king. So they were but they were seeing the evidence of the unseen. some evidence they liked, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But when he started saying, "I and my father are one." So, we don't like that evidence. We don't like wherever that come from. We don't agree with that. And so, the same people who were crying, "Let's make him a king. Let's make him a king." One week later, they're saying, "Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him." Why? Because the evidence was condemning them. On one side, you'll be oh, the greatest person in the country. You're the greatest neighbor. You're the greatest friend. But then something happens and you don't even know why, but they're absolutely opposed to you. &gt;&gt; I've actually encountered people that hate me before they know me. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? the spirit that's in them is in opposition is an enemy to the spirit that's in me. And I realize that I have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I have the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; He's a friend to some, but he's an enemy to others. &gt;&gt; And at one time they want to make you the greatest person in the world. And the next time they're gone. &gt;&gt; You're a nice congregation. Someday I won't be preaching here probably, but I want you to listen to this. Some of those that made they were making the temple and they were skilled and they were making the tabernacle. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; And they were working, giving their work and they maybe gave their money and they worked and they build they build this tabernacle. But then, you know, they didn't want to take it all &gt;&gt; and they died in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; And Jesus, who was speaking on behalf of God, later on said, "They're dead. &gt;&gt; They've died." &gt;&gt; You know, friends, I'm glad I can say it's not my words, it's his words. &gt;&gt; But they built the place that God was even going to dwell in. And And were they lost? No, I don't say that they were that I I have no place. It's it's God who gave life and God who does whatever he wants to do, but God saw that people would be that that some would You're kind of getting quiet on me. &gt;&gt; He saw that some would be engaged in his work and then later on would for I don't know for whatever reason they're engaged in the work, but at later on at some point in time say it's not for me. I guess there's just a stage of my life I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; But then there's others &gt;&gt; that say, you know what? I'm going to sit in this building and enjoy it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, &gt;&gt; I'm going to go into this temple, &gt;&gt; these boys that died in the wilderness. I still believe what the prophet Moses has said. And I'm still going to go in there and I'm going to stand in the court and I'm going to worship God. I don't care what happened to them. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they said. I don't care what they said about m what Miriam said Moses or about his wife or what they said about anything. I don't care what they said. I'm going to go. I still believe that some mercy seats in there. I still believe the Sakina is in there. I still believe it. Do you believe it? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought of a skilled people. God brings skilled people to do different things. God allows Well, I don't know. I'm afraid to ask this question, but there's a good side to I guess computers. I I I did all this work on a computer and I'm very glad that I have a computer because I can rub out my mistakes and I can highlight stuff and and it helps me along. And you say, "Well, I see I see you smiling there, Brother Darren. Brother Kyle, it's all right. You didn't smile. I I might be the old house but any the old class but nevertheless it's it does help me. So I think it's all right and and I have to think did God know that Bill Gates was going to be who Bill Gates is? And did he know that Steve Jobs was going to be what he's going to be? And did he know about Apple? Did he know about Blackberry? Did he know about all these computers and all this age? He know all about Did he know all about this texting and all about this social media? Does he know all about that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's old stuff. He said, he said, "Well, one day you're going to travel like a thought." &gt;&gt; How's that? &gt;&gt; Just have them plug that into their machine and see how that's going to work. Have them figure that one out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I went to a symposium that was at the World Fair and uh they were talking about technology that's just ahead and they said uh okay what's in the future for us? They said well how would you like to go down the street and know what's in the next person's mind? And they wanted you just to push a button. I never pushed a button. I said, "I have enough trouble with my own mind. Let let alone worry about the in this guy's mind." They said, "That's a that's technology that's coming. It's coming. You'll just walk down the street and you'll know what he's thinking. You know what they're thinking." And I said, "Well, I had a prophet that knew what people were thinking. I'll let it go through that prophet filter. I haven't got the filter to handle all of this. I don't care where they go. You know, someday you're going to laugh at maybe the ads that they have today. You'll maybe laugh at them the way like I do when I I see some of the cars of the 50s for 600 bucks. &gt;&gt; Wow. I'd like to buy a few of those. Does this all make some sense to you? I'm here today to try to convey to you that you are the substance that God has been preparing for a long time. And it's important for you, each one of you. There's nobody that's highly visible and nobody that's invisible. They're just everybody's important. When a prophet can say, "I'm just a man. I'm as helpless as can be." But when the angel of the Lord comes, I'm the voice of God to you. &gt;&gt; Now, that is something that every believer needs to discover. So God said about the tabernacle. It's it'll have them build a place so I can dwell amongst them. But he also said that I won't be only with them but I want to be in them. Now just give me a moment because I there are some scriptures and some quotes that I want to use. I will dwell amongst them. uh know you know here's here just some scriptures for Romans 8:9 says but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you I was really trying to absorb these phrases the spirit of God I I begin to think about what's it mean for the spirit of God to actually dwell in me and then other scriptures. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. So now the Holy Ghost and then Paul said in in Colossians, even the mystery which hath been hid. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello church. &gt;&gt; Paul is speaking about a mystery. It's been hid has been hid from the ages and from generations but now &gt;&gt; is made manifest to his saints. Is that so? &gt;&gt; And I say this to you. You need to say whether you feel it or whether some sparkling thing has happened or not happened, you need to say no that's true. &gt;&gt; These things that have been hid, these secrets that have been hid through the ages have been made known. And if it takes me with my education, limited education or your higher education to search out this message and find out, you know, you know the the the little quote that I was just giving you, I I see a life materializing. Put that one in your script bag. &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. Get somebody to try to explain that to you. Nobody. What what kind of prophet do you have? Did Muhammad ever say that? &gt;&gt; Did Joseph Smith ever say that? &gt;&gt; Head of the Mormon people or head of the Islamic people? Was there ever a prophet that says, "I see a life materializing. This is why you're here. &gt;&gt; You have some connection to this." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, I I I have a I have a prophet sent from God. Saw life materializing. This was done. Now I'm coming down. Have I still got a few minutes a time? I'm coming down. And the prophet in the in the message, the proof of the resurrection. That was in 54. But in 10 years later, 10 years of evidence, 10 years of proof, &gt;&gt; 10 years, I will say, of infallible proofs, &gt;&gt; constantly saying, "Is that the truth? Is that the truth?" If that's the truth, raise your hand. Is that the truth? Never once did anyone say, "No, it's not true." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? And then they try to um put this messenger, put this prophet and align them up with somebody else's on television. And that's absolute trash. &gt;&gt; As phony as it can be. &gt;&gt; I say don't put my messenger, don't put the one sent from God to me in that category. [Applause] And in 10 years, 10 years from 54. Here are just some phrases as we go along. In 53, I'm moving up quickly now. Now he says to somebody, "Now that won't hurt you." Hey, there's ministers like these ministers. There's scholars. There's doctors of divinity. And here here's a man with hardly any education. But he's got to he so believes in his in his mission and his commission &gt;&gt; to the people &gt;&gt; that he's telling educated people with all of the scholars and educated around saying now this one that is here now and he tells the person that won't hurt you that's the angel of the Lord It's the angel of the Lord, his presence. Now, do you believe that God the Father hath sent his son Jesus and he sent me as his prophet? &gt;&gt; If I shall ask God, will you be healed? Will your baby get well? Come here. What is it? You say, "Why are you reading that?" That's evidence. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be coming here. Just put the last slide up, would you please, for me? 10 years later, he preaches the trial. Now, we're having a real trial. The case is the word of God, the word of God's promises versus the world. That's the case. The indictment is a breach of promise. The prosecuting attorney is Satan and he represents the world in this trial. The defendant is God. The defense witness is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to make the church, the congregation both jury and judge. So you have to make a decision. As a jury and judge, how is the evidence to you? &gt;&gt; Now, here's one. during this 10 years he's saying now that won't hurt you said well I' I've heard that before no that won't hurt you is talking to people if you were standing here in other words would you be willing you'd be walking into something oh you might be like the woman you ladies might be like the woman in deep calls the deep she puts her hand on the pulpit to study yourself. Now, that won't hurt you. How do you like to be brother Ed Biscll driving along in a car? And do you think that this could be Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scripture and so on and revelation and so on? Well, I don't know. For all I know, brother Brandham, it must be. It has every appearance of being. And he says, "Now he's a man. I often kind of wondered. I kind of think so myself." And then from some unseen place. &gt;&gt; I thought instantly I thought, "I'm going to die. I'm I'm passing out of here." I didn't see anything with my eyes. Far more real than your eyes. Your eyes play tricks on you. I can take my glasses off and you all look different at eyes. Don't worry about eyes. &gt;&gt; I was frozen. I was frozen. I looked at him. He lost all the color in his face. His beard was prickled out like a man that was near death. Rolled his head back and kind of just glanced over with his eyes. said, "Brother Eddie, I guess he's come to me 10,000 times 10,000." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's just every time the same. It's like I could die. But would you would you like to be there? No, you wouldn't want to be there. You say, "Well, was there a fear?" Yeah. It was a great fear of reverence. He said every time he comes, he says, "Fear not. Friends, I'm talking about a holiness. I'm talking about a goddess such majesty that for the worms of the earth such as we are, it's a unspeakable honor that this God would call us. &gt;&gt; But he called us because he loved us. &gt;&gt; He called us because he had a program for us. He's brought you here because there's some specific way. He didn't bring you here because this is a nice place to live or Canada is a good place for you that have immigrated here. That's not the program. That's not the program. That I say again, that's not the program. You're here to be a blessing to the bride of Christ. You're here because God has ordained it. You're here because you needed to hear this service. &gt;&gt; You need to ponder it. You need to go home. You need to think deep about these things. You need to realize that someday, and it may not be too long, before you and I are called out of this life. &gt;&gt; Maybe me sooner than you, maybe you sooner than me. &gt;&gt; Then what? &gt;&gt; Then what? &gt;&gt; And people there gathered around you and you're on a cold slab. And then what? You're in the presence of God. You're in the very presence of this one I'm seeking to make a reality to you today. And what you need to say is, "Oh God, open my heart. Open my mind. Open my soul to you, oh father." &gt;&gt; Can you say that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're aware right now that you're standing in the presence of something besides a man. I believe I'm not just reading some words. I believe there's people that are here. You're seated in this. You say, "This is different." You're right. &gt;&gt; It is different. God is speaking. God is desiring to bring you into a special understanding and a special relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just some words. Our father which art in heaven but our father. Oh father. Father the way Jesus said it. The father acts the father works and so the son does likewise. You ladies can say the father acts. The father has desires. So the daughter does likewise. I'm here to fulfill what the word of God says about me. I'm here to fulfill God's word. God had a program, a divine program. Listen friends, &gt;&gt; when I think of how God has has designed this whole thing. I I was awakened quite early and I was thinking I was thinking of how God led has led us. He has done he has done these things. Some of you come from Blaine or come from Lynon come from I'm not talking talking about I don't want to talk about the Old Testament or the New Testament. I want to talk about here just before closing live at Birch Bay Seattle Tacoma. There's Vancouver over here, two and a half million people. So, we've gathered from a lot of different places. Brother John, I was talking to your son said, "How long you been here?" He said, "16 years in a few months." Brother Tammy, you came down. Brother Tom, how God called you. Did they come to a decision or did God do this? &gt;&gt; You are sitting where you're sitting. Say, "Well, why are you here?" Well, I'm here because my parents are here. Is that why you're here? Really? I'm here because my my parents moved here. Is that it or is it God? You're going to have to move away from your parent &gt;&gt; and determine God hath done this, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Then you'll get into another channel. You'll get into God had a plan. &gt;&gt; How did you get here, Brother Jean? How do you get hooked up with Sister Angelica? Angelica. Did I say that right? Fairly close. and your dad, brother Daniel, mom, coming from Nigeria. How How did this happen? Now, here's some things you don't know. Cloverdale. Where's Cloverdale? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "What's Jeffersonville?" &gt;&gt; Dark Hellhole. What is it? He said it's a Nazareth. It's it's it's the reject of the of the rejects. What's Cloverdale? We used to call it Clover Gouch. There was nothing here. Racetrack. &gt;&gt; Right behind the house. And God knew that in that house would be people that would come to know him. &gt;&gt; And there come a big tall Ellie, where are you? Stand up, Ellie. Just for a moment. Fell about this tall. 6 foot. He was 6'5, 6'6. Is that somewhere? All right. Okay. Sit down. He was imposing. He talked to my daughter. Marilyn, do you want to stand up? Okay. somebody 6'6 talking to her about 5'5 at school making fun of uh the house a house you gather Bible way house. Yeah. And I said you tell him he's a chicken and he's he's scared to come there. So you know what he did? He got tanked up. He got tanked up. Who's doing all this? &gt;&gt; God doeth it. And he comes to the house and there's a little hedge and he's weaving around, you know, he's trying to get up enough boldness to come in and he falls over the hedge right into the yard. Do you know what he was? You know what he he had a super mind. You know what he did? Four and a half years cleaning Brother Benham's messages because he was a electronic genius. You think when he was weaving drunk these strange people here falls over. Do you think he was saying glory to God I'm going to be cleaning the tapes? No. God was saying &gt;&gt; get up you slug. You're going to clean the tapes. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he four and a half years in a little wee place &gt;&gt; and he cleaned tapes and they made libraries and sent them all over the world. &gt;&gt; Can you folks take just a little bit of history? &gt;&gt; A history that right down to where you are, please. from a few young people in a house to a log church over 8,000 half-hour programs on the radio. That's where the name Bible believers came from. It was the Bible believers broadcast on as many as 27 stations from Africa to Hawaii and across the United States and Canada. four and a half years of filtering the tapes, we manufactured. We were a handful of people. We actually manufactured cassettes. How many don't know what a cassette is? Everybody knows what a cassette is. A little cassette. And the man who is making the cassettes doesn't know whether he believes the message now or not. &gt;&gt; Does that stop somebody from hearing it? &gt;&gt; Not a bit. &gt;&gt; Do you get my point? &gt;&gt; People may have labored. People may have worked. People may have produced tapes or books. They printed several millions in in India. I don't know where the people are. I don't know where the people are that were running the presses. I don't care where they are. I know where the books have gone. I know where the messages have gone and churches have sprung up. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; You know how what do I say? He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do. God was going to do it anyway. &gt;&gt; We're just so privileged we were able to be a part of it. So so privileged. &gt;&gt; And then we go on from there. I have to go on just quickly for a moment. And then the messages went on to discs. And then it went on to a message hub. And God brings people that can be skilled in certain things and connected in a certain way when we need to make a make uh the cassettes. I just had it in my heart. This is this is God's profit and we need the best quality there is. Do you know it just so happened? You know what happened, friends? None of you know. I'm going to tell you something. You're going to hear for the first time. God arranged that the president of Sony here in Canada of all the countries that Sony Sony had their products all over the world. They never gave it to any local people. But they gave it to a Jewish family called Cohen family. And when God had arranged that I would be in some old dirty building downtown selling some auction stuff, the president of Sony liked to get diamonds. And when he'd find a good diamond or some expensive jewelry and he'd come in, I got very well connected with him. Now years later, we're here. Well, I have a whole different reason. I I'm I'm attached to a message. I don't know what he's attached to. He became a very, very wealthy man. The whole family became very, very wealthy. But I called him up. I said, "We need tapes." He said, "Well, come on down." So I came down. They gave us all the equipment we wanted. We gave us the best tapes that could be had, Sony tape. And I thought, "This is just wonderful here. God puts a connection together out in the world someplace." Do you think that took God by surprise? Not for a moment. And he has those tapes and he has the best tape that there is. And and and and here we here we have bunch of young people and they're working manufacturing them from the big pancakes making tapes. You say why were we making them? Because some some of the messages were like 75 minutes and there's nothing from 60 minutes to 90. And so we didn't want to throw away 15 minutes of tape. So we made them as long as the service was and we manufactured one year alone they manufactured 98,000. The person who was making the tapes gone. &gt;&gt; The tape's not gone. He's gone. People worked in this building gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Come on folks. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, some of my friends Oh, no. Listen. The reason why you're here is not because it's a building. &gt;&gt; You're not here because it's comfortable. You're here because God called you. &gt;&gt; And that's the only reason you're here. Is that the truth? Say amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke. &gt;&gt; God called you. &gt;&gt; And this might have been in his mind hundred billion years ago. I'm going to bring some substance. I'm going to create substance. I'm making them. I'm making this child. I'm making a boy. I'm making a girl. I'll even send a messenger and and he'll stand in front of the people for years and give evidence of the unseen. He'll give evidence of me &gt;&gt; and I'll come so close. I'll stand on the platform. They'll be nervous when they come into my presence. They will know that what he's saying is the truth. And he'll ask, "Is this the truth? Is this the truth?" And they will say, "Yes, yes, it's the truth. It can only be truth because God is truth." [Music] &gt;&gt; And after 10 years, I'll have him speak the trial. &gt;&gt; I'll allow myself to be the defendant. &gt;&gt; I'll be put on trial by Mr. Skeptic, &gt;&gt; by Mr. Unbeliever, and Mr. Impatience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'll have my officer &gt;&gt; there. Glory to God. I'll have my validated, vindicated servant there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he'll speak on my behalf. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You can see I'm having trouble getting done. &gt;&gt; It will bring me right down to this time. Amen. I don't necessarily want to mention people but on the other hand I have a great difficulty not we need to build a building and so we need certain skilled people where they are today I don't know we need to build a school I'll tell you what if if brother and I've told brother Kim Dingwall and I say it without any hesitation if God hadn't sent him here we wouldn't have the present building that we have and you teachers that God has put it in your heart to be there let it be known to you that this service today, that this message today, and this is not some poetic license. God saw before the foundation of the world, that this substance was going to come and teach our children. And I tell you, our children are jewels. Our children are the crop, cream of the crop. &gt;&gt; And they're going to have a Holy Ghost. That's why you need the Holy Spirit and a principle such as Brother Tatch. I say, "Oh God, how gracious you are." Listen, friends, I'm not talking about Cloverdale, by the way. I'm saying he doeth the work. [Music] &gt;&gt; Have you ever been begged and begged and begged for your money? No. Why? Because he doeth the works. &gt;&gt; And if it's his works, it's his account. It's his bills. &gt;&gt; He has to pay for it. And as you sit here today, there's a brother, a young man, maybe 30. How old is brother Bus? &gt;&gt; He's 30. Just under 30, 29. He's got two little babies and his wife is way in Uganda. and he's left her so he can be there. You talk about sacrifice and has the first first and only message church in the nation of Ethiopia and that God would allow this church and somehow a burden and a vision and brother Tim has that burden and vision. This church has that burden and vision. Brother Tom has that burden and vision. Brother John has traveled to speak. Why? Not because we're building another earthly kingdom, but because there's a God hundreds of billions of years ago. Brother John, this was in God's mind. And he says, "I'm going to give evidence and I'm going to let people see the evidence." And there'll be some that'll see the evidence and say, "Praise God, it justifies me." And another person will see the evidence and they'll say, "I don't like that evidence. It condemns me. So be it. &gt;&gt; So be it. &gt;&gt; If a person did wrong, make it right. &gt;&gt; Make it right the right way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not here to just say a bunch of flowery words. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Billisburg. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You called me. &gt;&gt; Said, "I want to make it right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She sits here, we give her the right hand of fellowship. &gt;&gt; We're not here to play games. We're here to know who we are &gt;&gt; and why God has called us and what we're here to do. We're not here in our business. We're here on his business. &gt;&gt; He doeth the work. &gt;&gt; He's the one who paid the price. He's the one who gave the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; We all were sinners. &gt;&gt; We're all no good. There's nothing good in us. &gt;&gt; We're nothing more. As the prophet said, "I'm nothing more than the water of Bethesda after the angel of the Lord left. &gt;&gt; We're just humans." &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, he said, "I will never leave you. &gt;&gt; I will never I will never forsake you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we've had camps. And how I thank God for Brother Derek and Sister Debbie. And and it's not enough just to mention names and say how we thank them. I was thinking of you, brother Milco. I was thinking of all the other people and brother Darren and those and the unsung heroes. What about the trustees? And what about the deacons after many hours after the meeting's over? What about people that go out and witness and brother brother Matthew Redell gathering up the young people to go to the streets and put together uh whatever tracks and so on so forth. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; You may not do it the way we did. We're lucky some of our boys weren't in jail, but they were doing it out of their heart. Is that right, Brother Tom? Lucky they're not in jail. You know what I mean? Cuz they go down the street. What are you baptized unto if you weren't baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? I don't know what they said after that. Maybe maybe not repeat it. How were you baptized? What city did you come from? I was on an airplane and there was a movie that was being shot in Vancouver. I didn't have any headset, of course, but I see where the camera's going and they pan right by uh our our our trailer and we said, "You know what? People will be so tired of walking this midway of the P& they're going to be aching for a place to sit down. I said, "Let's get a trailer and put seats in it so they can sit down." See you smiling by the mic. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we don't have time for individual testimonies. I'm testifying. So people came in and sat down. And what did we have playing? Deep calls the deep. Deep calls the deep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A little woman came up. Actually, my daughter Marilyn went down to one of the one of the barns. Isn't this typical? Isn't this typical? Isn't this typical? No. &gt;&gt; Went down to one of the barns and there's a little wash lady in there cleaning the washroom and that wash lady says to her, "You're one of the young people from up at that booth, aren't you?" Is up on the hill. And she said, "Yes." She said, "You got something and I want it." &gt;&gt; You know whose mother that was? Sister Violet, why don't you stand up? Sister Violet Law's mother. &gt;&gt; And because of her mother who's passed away, Sister Violet at 19 years old, gave her life to Christ. And then you had a friend. You may not remember this, but I do. You remember it? Violet had a friend. Friend. Oh, the friends can be so dangerous. She had a friend out here someplace in the valley, I think it was, was pulling on her real strong and she was just about ready to give up. Brother Nathan, she's about ready to give up. And I remember the day we knelt at a chair and I spoke with her and she prayed through and has never moved ever since. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You see brother Ken Ardal playing the instrument up there. You know how he come? You don't know. He was the organist in the church across the street. Played nice organ. My neighbor was the choir leader at his church and she I think I don't want to say bad things but I think she was alcoholic pretty well and so she'd come to lead the choir and he was he was stewed on drugs. and the and and it's a church and we were a bunch of rag tags across the street. But he came in one day. Came in one day and sat in a chair. You know what it was? Atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Presence. atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And we knelt down at the chair. &gt;&gt; This is how real it is. Brother Daniel knelt down the chair. These are real people. These are people who are here. And I I stepped up to him before he knelt. I said, "Do you think it's for you?" I could tell it was tough for him to answer. Yeah. I said, "I think so." I said, "Why don't we why don't we just have prayer?" And I he could see I was getting ready to kneel there. He says, "You mean right here?" Cuz they never maybe do that in their church. I say, "Yeah, right here." So, I knelt and he got a hold of the rungs of the chair and his knuckles was turning white. And I was looking, I could see his knuckles hanging on. And while I was praying, I was wondering, God, is there any hope? Is there any chance? Are you going to do anything? He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; And without him, it's nothing. We're nothing more than the water in the pool of Bethesda. Without the angel of the Lord, without the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; we're nothing. And I saw him begin to tremble, &gt;&gt; begin to shake, and he hung on to the rails of the of the chair harder and harder. But the the hand slipped down gradually slipped down. He couldn't hold on. There's no human that can resist that kind of force until the chest is down on the chair and sobbing, sobbing. When he got up from there, brother Ken Ardal was a transformed person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did he know the message? No, he didn't know all the message. That's not important. You need to meet him. &gt;&gt; And then you come to know the message. He is the message. He is the word. He's the one that do I say who has done all these things. He has done these things. And when you hear of brother, brother brother Tim going to Ethiopia or brother Tom and Michael going to the Congo, it's not just a trip, friends. That is not it. This is I want you to see that this is a continuation of him doing the things. We're just the people. We're just the substance. Oh God, come into this congregation, into every single life, and give them a revelation that that that that God ordained that this substance would come together. &gt;&gt; And not only that, but your substance to another substance, &gt;&gt; God has ordained it would come together. And you people that have come uh from Colorado to be with us, somehow God has ordained that you should be here. That's already had an effect upon us. The people will come 1 1500 miles one way to be baptized. Sister Jenny Leer Leonard, God brought you here. We hear from your grandpa every month. And he said, I just got a letter from him. God bless you. Pray for my hands. His my hands are not too steady, but he sends an offering for the mission's work every month. God bless our brother Vaden Young. I say God bless the people. God bless the effect that the camp has been. Brother Derek, you're not there just working for a Mount Baker Bible Way camp. It's not that. And brother Matt Bonus, God ordained certain people with certain skills and certain willing a willingness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because I haven't mentioned some, it doesn't mean you're unimportant. doesn't mean that &gt;&gt; our deacons and our trustees but the people the people &gt;&gt; we can never never underestimate the people the individual you are as a son or daughter of God you children you young people I tell you I was just a boy when God's hand was placed upon me and I I I I would just break down and weep I would look at a flower and walk through the woods and walk in the wilderness God saw I needed to walk in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; God saw I needed to be without a mother and have a father and a stepmother way up someplace up in up in construction camps. God knew that &gt;&gt; because we need to be in a place molded. God has molded you. &gt;&gt; God has molded you. Each one of you have a individual testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Individual life. You may think it's unique. It's not unique. It's part of the part of the uh unique part of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I knew that it would be a little difficult right here because it's so hard for people to acknowledge &gt;&gt; and see. There's one aspect about the bride of Jesus Christ. You've got to see yourself &gt;&gt; as somebody very special. Somebody that cost the son of God, the blood, the new creation, &gt;&gt; the new creation suffered for you. You're that special. &gt;&gt; And there's not enough in words in my body to say how special God's people are. &gt;&gt; How unique they are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the effect that you can have. Who knows? One day, I assure you on the basis of God's word, I assure you that you are one day you're going to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you said a certain thing." &gt;&gt; We were sitting in a restaurant and Joanne was with her mother and I. And I've heard my wife say, but I've never heard my daughter say, and so I guess I can say it to you. I heard my wife say many times before we came to the message, there was a woman, she was Sister Opal McGreff. I never ever saw her dress in uncchristian way. She wore long dresses down to here. Her husband was just as bold as could be. We stopped for gas one time and Sister McGriff got up and walked around. That was in the age of the miniskirts. You girls listen now cuz I'm going to talk about a girl, very young girl, my own daughter. And she walked by and I guess was guy was putting in gas. He looked at at Sister McGriffin, that kind of mid midlength skirt, watched her. He says to Brother Mc, he said, "Is that the style now?" Chad says, "That's always been the style." We walked into a service station. A guy was cussing and damning and all kinds of vulgarity coming out of his mouth. Brother McGriff looked at me. He said, "I wouldn't hold in my hands what this man's got in his mouth." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, he got the message across real quick. sitting at the table just the other day, two, three days ago, I said, "You know, my wife has always said, the woman who never preached, never tried to convince me about anything, just lived the life in front of me." said, "I I was so affected all through my girlhood of Sister Opal Mcrist's life." And Joanne spoke up and she said, "Well, I was a very small girl and the same life affected me. &gt;&gt; I was a very small girl." &gt;&gt; Think of it, Tom. You're married to this girl now. I was a very small girl. And she said, "I noticed that after every service when the preacher was when brother McGriff or whoever was preaching was done preaching, she would get right up from where she was sitting, go right to the piano and start to play for the after service and would stay there as long as there was people there. She was always she would never answer her husband." sisters, I don't want you to get condemned. She would never answer her husband. We lived in their own house. We lived in their house. I spent two two winters in Portland, pastored a church in Hillsboro towards Beaverton. You think I don't know the area? I know it very well. And the woman who owned the church wanted me to pastor it permanently. We couldn't do it because we were having meetings in Oregon. Washington, Idaho, and Northern California and traveled there. And my wife was carrying a child, Linda, Linda. And that Sister McGriffin never said a word, never gave any special instruction or never corrected her or never did anything. Just let what am I saying? Well, you say I intended to say some of this but not all of it. What am I saying it for? Now you have a sisters sitting amongst you today and others which I've talked about sitting here today. Why are they what they are? I say this and excuse my raised voice. God doeth the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God and a woman. Some never even saw the message because the message hadn't even come. &gt;&gt; God did the work. &gt;&gt; God caused them. Why do they live a certain way? Why do they remain silent? God caused them to be that. That's what it took for God to form another person the way they wanted them. And you might be a certain way or someone else is a certain way. Just let leave it in God's hands. Say, "Well, people left me or my friends left me." Leave it in God's hands for once and for all. Leave it in God's hands. I've tried to raise you up high enough so you can see over above all of these things. God's in control. Every servant rises or falls before his own master. People have asked me, "What do you think about this person? What do you think?" I don't think about it at all. I let God think about it. &gt;&gt; Let God think about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; The substance and the evidence. We'll have the musicians please come. Just while they're coming, will let's just bow our hearts. Father, I've had a special just a special relationship with you over the last weeks and months. It's been very very wonderful. I pray Lord that I've been able somehow by your grace to pass off to the people that we so love. some that were mentioned, many that were not mentioned, not because we have not held them in our hearts and in our thoughts and in our appreciation. And oh God, even for some that may wonder if it was a misunderstanding. No, not at all. We just leave everything in your hands. You're doing everything. You're the one, oh God, that's designing and you've designed this work, whatever it is that we are to fulfill. Thus shall it be. &gt;&gt; I say it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus shall it be. And to think up in a little studio, oh God, we have a man by the name of brother Murphy Wong and he's translating this into Chinese. Oh God, and to think that your prophet would speak his word. And now this man would become so gripped and so caught and so hooked upon this word that his voice becomes the voice of your messenger oh over the hundreds of millions of people. How does this happen from a place of Cloverdale? God doeth it. My father doeth the works. Father, Father, you have done the work and we give you praise and glory and honor and Lord we will not back away from it. We will not apologize for it. You have done the work and we say glorify yourself, oh God. We live our lives that you might be glorified that the kingdom of God might be lifted up &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. We ask for these blessings upon the people now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have you stand. Will I'd like to sing Brother Ryan um 7:43 Once I Was Stray. Wonder if we can have someone here with a voice. Okay. [Music] Once I was straight in dark valley, no hope within I see. He searched to heaven and found a savior to save a world of soul like me. Oh, what a savior. Hallelu. His heart was broken on Calary. His hands were his. [Music] He gave his life for me. &gt;&gt; Just before we sing the next verse, I'd like to say this to you and it might change it for you. If you listen to the series, Port El Bernie, I don't know if you have the correct tape. I think they may have cut it off of one. I feel badly. I hope your song has it. a man, one of the uh Charles brothers. Thank you, one of the Charles brothers, the eldest who did not sing in the trail. They live in uh La Push, Washington. And I had never heard him sing. He got got up there with a bomber jacket and real humble missing some major teeth in front and he says I'm a little stage fright little mic fright but he said he'd like to sing. Oh what a savior. All I can tell you is when brother Brandham came out the door, right after he finished singing, he said any preacher that couldn't preach after that wouldn't wouldn't be much of a preacher. So you can imagine how it was. I was sitting right behind him and it was so divine and so heavenly. It was like angels were singing. And I think friends how I feel. I feel very privileged to be able to give voice. Oh, what a savior. Oh, what a savior. Oh, what a program. This is not just another church. You understand that? The people of this congregation, the people of the bride of Jesus Christ have been God has designed them and ordained them, put every little facet of their life together. And you have to recognize, I just want you to say, "Praise God. I believe that, brother Bisl. I believe that with all my heart, we're not merely a special people down here in this earth." That's not it. We're a heavenly people with a heavenly calling ordained and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't ask me to be silent because I cannot be silent. Oh, what a savior. &gt;&gt; All right, let's sing the verse. He left his father with all his graes with all his Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] his son [Music] for even death water I should be crossing his hand will lead me [Music] Come for your glory in every sing and sing Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh hallelu [Music] on calary [Music] for [Music] Now I have a closing phrase [Music] out of you young people, young men. I know we've spoken about this, Brother Kim, Brother John. We've spoken to the individuals out of this group will rise if time shall go on. Don't want you to ever forget it. shall rise. Maybe the most unsuspecting person will rise and God will put his word in your mouth and you shall live. There'll be young ladies that will rise up and be such as Sister Tracy and some of you other sisters who have given their lives and given their homes. And I say there will be families that will open their homes. &gt;&gt; There will be widows that will open their homes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever. Whatever it is, just do whatever God allows you to do. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Here I am. I'm available." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention? &gt;&gt; I believe I do. I felt that while I was while I was studying. Listen, church, we're not here to build another church. We're here, oh God, to to blaze a a a a trail straight through. &gt;&gt; We want to keep the fires burning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so shall it be. &gt;&gt; There'll be young men, I don't know, Josh, maybe you'll take the gospel to China. I don't know. But when a man is a full of the Holy Ghost, young women full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm preaching at you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching at you because this is what has to happen. &gt;&gt; People like Brother Mil, we're fading off the off the scene. People like myself, we're fading off the scene. &gt;&gt; People like Tom and people like Brother Tim, John's got a few years to go. What are we talking I'm talking about the real thing. Hallelujah. We start we start fading off the scene because of our our lack of energy. Listen friends, I'll tell you if I gave to you our traveling just the travel flights, it's exhausting when I read it. It's absolutely exhausting is going to Norway and going down to Poland and going to India and going this place. Why were we going? We weren't joy tripping. &gt;&gt; We weren't joy tripping. [Music] I've been to Africa, Johannesburg. I'd been there five times, five years because we had radio broadcast. Did we know? Did we know to go places? Yeah. We would go to a whole area that was all just uh African people. And standing there, I thought this is so remarkable. And I was standing there in the dark at night. We had a radio broadcast. It was on Swazi Music Radio, 100,000 watt covering 87 million people. And I was just standing there amongst a whole crowd of maybe 200 250 African people standing there and listening to the broadcast. I thought, isn't this incredible? Here I am probably 10, 15,000 miles from home. I'm listening to the Bible believers broadcast. Sometimes it was the prophet of God speaking. Sometimes it was myself speaking or sometimes brother Lonnie Lonnie and I speaking. I was sitting there. I asked somebody said, "Do you have tapes of do you have the prophets tapes? Do you have brother Brandham's tapes?" "Yeah." He said, "I get them from I get them from Bible believers in Washington." I said, "Good outfit. Didn't matter that he didn't know me. That didn't matter a bit. One driving force. And you folks might as well get used to it. I've won driving force and it's been in with me ever since I was just a young man. One driving force. Get this word. &gt;&gt; I don't care how. I don't care where. I didn't care. I was a minister. that that make no difference at all. Get this message. Get a tape recorder. Get something and get it out. Get it get it translated. Help somebody. That's the first thing I want to know. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Heavenly Father, bless this congregation. I pray you will bless them with a flame of fire. The Holy Spirit has been called the fire, a baptism of fire of the Holy Ghost. And Lord, I pray that you'll give this congregation, a renewed baptism. Give them a renewed vision. I pray, Father, that there will be a dedication. Even as I'm praying now, I pray for a prayer of dedication. We dedicate ourselves to you. We give ourselves to you. whatever is in the program. Lord, we do not know the future, but we give ourselves to you and all that you would do. Bless, oh God, us this afternoon and as we come back this evening, we will be here to testify and to witness and see our precious friends from Colorado baptized. Pray that you'll bless this family in the name of Jesus Christ. May we have a blessed afternoon. We dismiss now with your grace in Jesus name. Amen. Would you please shake hands with someone right next to you? Say, "God bless you." And mean it. A smile on your face. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
