[0:00] We're going to be turning to the word
[0:01] now at this time. Let's be praying that
[0:04] God would just anoint our brother
[0:05] Spencer to speak exactly what God wants
[0:08] us to hear this morning.
[0:11] I bless your name.
[0:15] I bless your name.
[0:19] I give you honor.
[0:23] Give you praise.
[0:27] You are the light.
[0:31] the truth, the way.
[0:35] I bless your name.
[0:39] I bless your name. I bless your name. I
[0:43] bless your name.
[0:47] I bless your name, Lord. I give you
[0:52] honor,
[0:53] Lord. We give you praise.
[0:58] You are the life,
[1:02] the truth, the way.
[1:06] I bless your name.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; I bless your We bless your name. We
[1:14] bless your name.
[1:17] We bless your name.
[1:21] We give you honor.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; We give you honor.
[1:26] you praise.
[1:28] Give him praise
[1:30] and
[1:33] bless the way.
[1:37] I bless your name.
[1:40] I bless your name.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; And he who we bless said, "He that
[1:48] receiveth you receiveth me." We receive
[1:52] you, Brother Ron, as we would receive
[1:56] him.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads before him.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father.
[2:22] for what you have done.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, that you would
[2:29] come and fellowship with us
[2:32] for these days,
[2:36] that you would anoint our lips
[2:39] and anoint our hearts.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Maybe it came a different way than we
[2:47] were even expecting.
[2:50] But that's just how you do.
[2:53] You come in that personal way.
[2:57] And Lord, may this morning be no
[3:00] different. Lord Jesus,
[3:03] &gt;&gt; we have blessed your name.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; You are the King of Kings.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; And the Lord of Lords.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Your name is great to be praised this
[3:16] morning.
[3:19] All the prophets of all the ages will
[3:21] stand that day and give you glory.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; The mightiest men that ever put their
[3:28] feet in shoe leather.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm thankful that there was
[3:33] one that was worthy to take the book.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; All of our names were in that book.
[3:40] Father,
[3:42] &gt;&gt; we were on your mind before the
[3:44] foundation of the world.
[3:47] and sin had so gripped our lives.
[3:50] But thank you for the redemption power
[3:54] of Jesus Christ. I thank you for the
[3:57] blood of the lamb.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we turn to your word just now,
[4:04] I ask you that you would anoint this
[4:07] body this morning. May you anoint vocal
[4:10] cords. And Lord, may you anoint our
[4:13] hearts and our ears to receive your
[4:16] word, Father.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; And I pray the angel of the Lord would
[4:20] come into this tent, Lord Jesus.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just pray that you will speak
[4:26] to us in a special way. We thank you for
[4:30] what you have done, what you are doing,
[4:34] and what you are about to do. We thank
[4:37] you for it and we give you 100% glory
[4:41] for it in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[4:45] the congregation said, "Amen."
[4:48] Amen.
[4:50] Amen.
[4:55] Amen. Always I always have to find a fly
[4:57] somewhere.
[4:59] Amen. We're glad to be in the house of
[5:01] the Lord this morning, aren't we?
[5:04] I certainly would like to thank brother
[5:06] Ed for inviting me here and I have had a
[5:11] wonderful time. You guys have just about
[5:14] killed me, but I've had a wonderful
[5:16] time.
[5:18] Amen. I certainly do appreciate all of
[5:21] his hospitality and your hospitality.
[5:24] And I would like to think that I could
[5:26] shake every one of your hands, but if I
[5:29] can't do it here, I'll do it there.
[5:32] And I just like to thank my wife for
[5:35] coming and we certainly do appreciate
[5:38] her for being able to come. I would like
[5:41] to thank they won't they don't want me
[5:43] to do this but I would like to thank
[5:45] brother Joe and sister Bobby for
[5:48] everything that they did to make this
[5:51] this trip a wonderful experience.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; They run a five-star hotel.
[5:57] Amen.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I thought they was
[6:00] going to feed me like a Chinese pig. I
[6:03] thought they was just going to keep
[6:04] putting the food in me. You need this
[6:06] for your strength. You need this food
[6:08] for your strength. But I really do
[6:10] appreciate them and everything that they
[6:12] did. They didn't ask for that, but I
[6:14] just want to thank them personally.
[6:17] Amen. You love the Lord this morning. If
[6:20] &gt;&gt; you will turn with me to Joshua chapter
[6:22] 23.
[6:36] I believe today is the last service.
[6:39] So, we're not going to leave no stone
[6:41] unturned.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to do it quickly, but
[6:46] we're not going to leave any of them
[6:48] unturned. So, here we go. Amen.
[6:52] Amen. And you can already tell that this
[6:54] body don't hold up to these three-hour
[6:55] sermons. So, amen. So, there's no need
[6:58] getting nervous. Joshua chapter 23
[7:06] verse 8.
[7:09] But cleave unto the Lord your God as ye
[7:13] have done unto this day.
[7:17] For the Lord hath driven out from before
[7:20] you great nations and strong.
[7:24] But as for you,
[7:27] no man hath been able to stand before
[7:30] you unto this day.
[7:35] Verse 10,
[7:38] one man of you shall chase a thousand.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Lord your God, he is it.
[7:47] He it is that fightth for you,
[7:50] &gt;&gt; as he hath promised you.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; That is a covenant of God.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; And God does not change his mind about
[8:01] his word.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; And I want you to just read this with
[8:05] me, Lord, as we as we're doing it. This
[8:08] is my covenant. One man of you shall
[8:11] chase a thousand. For the Lord your God,
[8:15] he it is that fightth for you, as he
[8:19] hath promised you.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this morning.
[8:37] Now we understand that when God swore by
[8:39] himself, he could swear by no greater.
[8:43] And he swore to Abraham,
[8:46] the father of us all.
[8:50] He swore to Abraham that thy seed shall
[8:54] possess the gates of their enemy. Amen.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand he
[9:00] deposited that into the natural seed of
[9:04] Abraham.
[9:06] But they must tap into that resource
[9:09] THAT GOD HAS DEPOSITED THERE. Now he
[9:13] didn't leave his spiritual seed out.
[9:16] Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; One day I was I was at an airport and
[9:20] they had had had basically
[9:24] basically cancelled two flights in front
[9:27] of me. I had already been almost two
[9:29] days in journey to go to a certain place
[9:32] and I was sitting in actually in Utah
[9:35] and I was there and uh I was standing
[9:39] before the man and he told me he said
[9:41] you're going to have to wait five more
[9:43] hours. And so I I I told him, I said,
[9:45] 'You know, there's certainly something
[9:47] that should be done. I said, 'You know,
[9:49] I could have rode a a horse.
[9:53] And he said, 'You know, he said, if a
[9:55] pony is all that you need, we can
[9:56] certainly get you that. He said, but I'm
[9:59] willing to buy your supper for the
[10:01] evening. And so there was a fellow
[10:03] behind me that was having the same
[10:04] problem. And so we went and we had
[10:07] supper together. And as we were sitting
[10:09] there with my wife and we were sitting
[10:11] sitting enjoying dinner and I prayed
[10:13] over the meal and and and and I just
[10:16] want to bring it to this this evening,
[10:18] you know, he he said uh he said, YOU
[10:20] KNOW, I'M A JEW. And I said, I am too.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, REALLY, I'M THE NATURAL
[10:30] SEED of Abraham." I said, "Well, I'm the
[10:34] spiritual seed of Abraham.
[10:38] And he said, 'Well, I would like for you
[10:40] to be able, he was a doctor. He was an
[10:42] optitian from Florida. He said, 'I would
[10:44] like for you to be able to tell me that
[10:46] in kind of layman's terms what that
[10:49] means. I said, WHEN YOUR GREAT GREAT
[10:51] GREAT ALL THE WAY BACK, ABRAHAM was
[10:53] sitting there AND HE WAS TALKING TO GOD
[10:56] AND GOD TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT THE SAND OF
[10:58] THE OF the sea and COUNT THEM. I SAID,
[11:01] NOW THAT WAS LOOKING AT YOU.
[11:04] I SAID, "BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE, ONLY A
[11:05] FEW SCRIPTURES LATER, HE TOLD HIM TO
[11:08] LOOK UP."
[11:13] &gt;&gt; AND I SAID, "THAT'S THE SPIRITUAL SEED
[11:15] OF ABRAHAM."
[11:17] &gt;&gt; AND HE COULDN'T COUNT THEM EITHER. AND I
[11:19] SAID, "ONE OF THOSE STARS OUT THERE, YOU
[11:22] MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE. IT MIGHT BE
[11:24] OBLIVIOUS TO THE WHOLE WORLD, BUT ONE OF
[11:27] THOSE STARS REPRESENT ME.
[11:33] So he told me, he says, "Well, I bet
[11:35] you're going to TELL ME ABOUT THIS JESUS
[11:37] WHICH IS called the Christ." I said,
[11:39] "We've got five hours."
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL
[11:47] ME ABOUT THIS JESUS." HE SAID, "WANTED
[11:50] TO CONVERT ME TO CHRISTIANITY." I said,
[11:52] "You have not heard OF THE JESUS OF
[11:55] today
[11:56] &gt;&gt; of the son of man word that has been
[11:59] REVEALED TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST."
[12:01] I SAID, "DO YOU MIND IF I JUST START
[12:03] TALKING TO YOU?" AND WE JUST WENT RIGHT
[12:05] INTO IT. WITHIN FIVE HOURS, HE WAS SO
[12:09] THRILLED ABOUT WHAT HE HAD HEARD. HE
[12:12] GAVE HIS HEART TO THE LORD RIGHT THERE
[12:14] AT THE TABLE.
[12:22] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS SIGNED A
[12:25] COVENANT WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; AND I believe, AS WE HAVE TALKED OVER
[12:30] THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT WE'RE A PART OF
[12:32] THAT COVENANT. I believe that he SIGNED
[12:35] IT WITH HIS VERY OWN BLOOD.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; NOW, I want you to just notice a couple
[12:41] of covenant promises in Deuteronomy
[12:43] chapter 28 before I get too excited. And
[12:46] he said, "And it shall come to pass, if
[12:48] thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
[12:51] voice of the Lord thy God, to observe
[12:53] and to all all of his commandments,
[12:56] which I command thee this day, that the
[12:59] Lord THY GOD WILL SET THEE ON HIGH ABOVE
[13:03] all nations of the earth, and all of
[13:06] these blessings shall come upon thee,
[13:09] &gt;&gt; AND OVERTAKE THEE, IF THOU SHALT HEARKEN
[13:13] UNTO THE UNTO THE VOICE OF THE LORD THY
[13:17] GOD. BLESSED THOU BE IN THE CITY.
[13:21] BLESSED THOU BE IN THE FIELD.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, BROTHER, THAT WAS TO THE JEWS.
[13:26] BUT WE'RE HIS BRIDE.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS COMMANDED A BLESSING ON YOU.
[13:31] HE'LL BLESS YOUR JOB. HE'LL BLESS YOUR
[13:34] HOME. HE'LL BLESS YOUR CHILDREN.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER RON, THAT SOUNDS
[13:41] LIKE CHARISMATIC." I WANT YOU TO JUST
[13:43] UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT CHARISMATIC.
[13:45] THAT'S WORD.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[13:51] &gt;&gt; I just believe the word. So here we are.
[13:53] Great quote book. HE SAID THIS SHALL HE
[13:55] SAID BLESSED THOU SHALT BE IN THE CITY.
[13:58] BLESSED THOU SHALT BE IN THE FIELD.
[14:00] BLESSED SHALL BE THE FRUIT OF THY BODY.
[14:02] HE SAYS THE FRUIT OF THY GROUND, THE
[14:05] FRUIT OF THY CATTLE, THE INCREASE OF THY
[14:07] KIND, THE FLOCKS OF THY SHEEP. BLESSED
[14:10] SHALL BE THY BASKET AND THY STORE.
[14:13] BLESSED SHALT THOU BE WHEN THOU COMEST
[14:16] IN, AND BLESSED SHALL BE WHEN THOU GOEST
[14:19] OUT. THE LORD SHALL CAUSE
[14:23] &gt;&gt; THE LORD SHALL CAUSE THINE ENEMIES THAT
[14:26] RISE UP AGAINST THEE TO BE SMITTEN
[14:30] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THY FACE, AND THEY SHALL COME OUT
[14:33] AGAINST THEE ONE WAY, AND FLEE BEFORE
[14:37] THEE SEVEN WAYS.
[14:45] believe we're going to have a good time.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 20, he says, "And God
[14:50] spake all of these words, saying, I am
[14:54] the Lord thy God, which have brought
[14:58] thee out of the land of Egypt, and out
[15:01] of the house of bondage, and thou shalt
[15:04] have no OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.
[15:10] GOD WANTS FIRST PLACE.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S SIMPLE, BROTHER RON. GOD REQUIRES
[15:19] FIRST PLACE
[15:21] &gt;&gt; for this covenant to work.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; HE MUST NOT SHARE. HE SAID, "THOU SHALT
[15:27] NOT MAKE UNTO THEE any graven image or
[15:30] any likeness about anything that IS IN
[15:33] HEAVEN ABOVE, OR THAT IS IN THE EARTH
[15:35] BENEATH, or is the water under the
[15:37] earth. And thou shalt not bow down
[15:39] thyself to them, nor serve them. For I
[15:43] am THE LORD THY GOD, AND I'M A JEALOUS
[15:45] GOD. THIS AND THE INIQUITY OF THE
[15:47] FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN, UNTO the
[15:49] third and fourth generation of them that
[15:52] hate me,
[15:55] &gt;&gt; AND SHOWETH MERCY UPON THOUSANDS OF THEM
[15:58] THAT LOVE ME, AND keep my commandments.
[16:01] and thou shalt not take the name OF THE
[16:03] LORD THY GOD IN VAIN, FOR THE LORD will
[16:06] not hold him guiltless that taketh his
[16:08] name in vain.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; IN CHAPTER 23, HE SAYS THIS.
[16:16] HE SAYS, "THERE SHALL NOTHING CAST their
[16:18] young, NOR BE BARREN IN THY LAND. The
[16:21] number of the days WILL I FULFILL. I
[16:24] WILL SEND MY FEAR BEFORE THEE, AND WILL
[16:27] DESTROY ALL THE PEOPLE TO whom thou
[16:29] shalt come. AND I WILL MAKE ALL of the
[16:32] thine enemies turn their backs unto
[16:35] thee, AND I WILL SEND HORNETS BEFORE
[16:38] THEE, AND WHICH SHALL DRIVE OUT THE
[16:40] HIVITE, AND THE CANONITE, and the and
[16:43] THE HIGHITE FROM BEFORE THEE. OH, I LIKE
[16:46] THAT. DON'T YOU?
[16:49] &gt;&gt; I like a God THAT WANTS TO HELP US FIGHT
[16:51] OUR BATTLES.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 23, very familiar.
[16:58] He said, "THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; He is my husband.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; HE HAS TAKEN ALL MY RESPONSIBILITIES.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; HE'S TAKEN ALL MY SHAME."
[17:13] &gt;&gt; And notice what HE SAYS. AND I SHALL NOT
[17:16] WANT.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SERMON WITHIN ITSELF. I SHALL
[17:20] NOT WANT. HE HAS PROMISED ME HE WOULD
[17:23] TAKE CARE OF ME.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He maketh me to lie DOWN IN
[17:28] GREEN PASTURES. HE LEADTH ME BESIDE THE
[17:30] STILL WATERS. HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. HE
[17:33] LEADTH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
[17:35] FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND YAY, THOUGH I
[17:38] WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF
[17:39] DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL, FOR THOU ART
[17:43] WITH ME.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE A PERSONAL GOD TO YOU.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, I AM THAT I AM.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; I WILL DRIVE OUT YOUR ENEMIES.
[18:00] YAY, though I walk through the valley of
[18:02] the shadow of death, I will fear NO
[18:05] EVIL, FOR THOU ART WITH ME. THY ROD, THY
[18:10] STAFF THAT COMFORT ME. THOU PREPAREST
[18:12] THE TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF
[18:15] MINE ENEMIES. THOU ANOINTEST MY HEAD
[18:17] WITH ALL. MY CUP RUNTH OVER. SURELY
[18:20] GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL
[18:24] THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, AND I WILL DWELL IN
[18:26] THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was going to PREACH
[18:31] THE RAPTURE, HE WENT TO THIS SCRIPTURE,
[18:33] PSALMS 27. THE LORD ELOHIM IS MY LIGHT
[18:39] AND MY SALVATION.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear?
[18:45] &gt;&gt; THE LORD IS THE STRENGTH OF MY LIFE. OF
[18:49] WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID? WHEN THE WICKED,
[18:52] EVEN MINE ENEMIES AND MY FOES CAME UPON
[18:54] ME TO EAT UP MY FLESH, THEY STUMBLED AND
[18:57] FELL. THOUGH AN HOST SHOULD ENCAMP
[18:59] AGAINST ME, MY HEART SHALL NOT FEAR.
[19:02] THOUGH WAR SHOULD RISE AGAINST ME, AND
[19:05] THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT, ONE THING HAVE
[19:08] I DESIRED OF THE LORD,
[19:11] &gt;&gt; THAT THOU WILL I SEEK AFTER, THAT I MAY
[19:14] DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. ALL ALL
[19:19] ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD AND TO
[19:28] INQUIRE IN THE TEMP IN HIS TEMPLE.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE HE SHALL HIDE
[19:35] ME.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME.
[19:41] IN HIS PAVILION, IN THE SECRET OF HIS
[19:44] TABERNACLE, SHALL HE HIDE ME. EVEN IN
[19:47] THE MIDST OF YOUR TROUBLE, HE CAN GIVE
[19:50] YOU REST.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; You can BE IN A TOTAL SABBATH IN THE
[19:56] MIDST OF A TROUBLES OF YOUR LIFE.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; He shall set me up on a rock.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? Yes.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; John 15:1, he says, "I am the true vine,
[20:13] and my father is the husband. Every
[20:16] branch in me that beareth not fruit, he
[20:18] taketh away, and every branch that
[20:21] beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it
[20:23] might bring forth more fruit."
[20:25] Now ye are clean through the word which
[20:28] I have spoken unto you. ABIDE IN ME AND
[20:31] I IN YOU. As the BRANCH HAS BEARETH
[20:34] FORTH BIRTH beareth forth FRUIT OF
[20:36] ITSELF, EXCEPT IT ABIDE IN THE VINE. NO
[20:39] MORE CAN YE EXCEPT YOU ABIDE IN ME. I am
[20:43] the vine
[20:45] &gt;&gt; and ye are the branches.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; HE THAT ABIDETH IN ME. NOTICE THIS IS
[20:50] COVENANT PROMISES. YES,
[20:52] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT FELLOWSHIPPING
[20:54] WITHIN THE COVENANT THIS MORNING.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying. I AM THE VINE
[21:01] AND YE ARE THE BRANCHES.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; HE THAT IS ABIDETH IN ME AND I AM HIM,
[21:07] THE SAME BRINGETH FORTH MUCH FRUIT. FOR
[21:10] WITHOUT ME, YE CAN DO NOTHING.
[21:14] IF A MAN ABIDE NOT IN ME, HE HAS CAST
[21:17] FORTH AS A BRANCH AND IS WITHERED AND
[21:20] MEN GATHER THEM AND CAST THEM INTO THE
[21:22] FIRE AND THEY ARE BURNED. BROTHER RAM'S
[21:24] FAVORITE SCRIPTURE. IF YOU ABIDE IN ME
[21:27] AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, YOU SHALL ASK
[21:31] WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE DONE UNTO
[21:35] YOU.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Herein or here IS WHERE THE COVENANT IS
[21:41] GLORIFIED.
[21:42] HEREIN IS MY FATHER GLORIFIED THAT YE
[21:46] bear much fruit.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; SO SHALL YE BE MY DISCIPLES.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; You know when YOU WALK UP TO A TREE,
[21:56] JUST to give you a REAL SIMPLE ANALOGY,
[21:58] WHEN YOU WALK UP TO A TREE, YOU DON'T
[21:59] SAY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TRUNK.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; What beautiful branches.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; WHAT BEAUTIFUL FRUIT.
[22:11] AMEN.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT BEAUTIFUL FRUIT.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; NOW IF IT IS OF THE ORIGINAL SEED, IT
[22:18] REPLICATES THE LIFE THAT IS WITHIN IT.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in QUESTIONS AND
[22:25] ANSWERS, HE SAID, "ALL POWERS IN HEAVEN
[22:27] AND EARTH IS GIVEN INTO MY HANDS. GO AND
[22:31] I'LL GO WITH YOU. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON
[22:33] EARTH, I'LL BIND IN HEAVEN." HE SAYS,
[22:35] "WHAT YOU LOOSE ON EARTH, I'LL LOOSE IN
[22:38] HEAVEN." OH, IF THE GREAT HOLY CHURCH
[22:41] ONLY REALIZED ITS POWER TO DO THESE
[22:43] THINGS, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH DOUBT AND
[22:46] FEAR AND TREMBLING. WONDER IF IT WILL
[22:49] HAPPEN. COULD IT HAPPEN? AS LONG AS THAT
[22:52] EXISTS, THE CHURCH CAN NEVER STAND
[22:54] UPRIGHT. WHEN EVERY TALK OF FEAR IS
[22:56] VANISHED, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COMPLETELY
[22:58] IN CONTROL of the church. THEN ALL FEARS
[23:01] ARE GONE. AND THE CHURCH HAS THE POWER.
[23:04] HE SAID THEY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN
[23:06] OWNS IS BEHIND THEM.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THEY'RE AMBASSADORS OF THE
[23:13] THRONE.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; AN AMBASSADOR OF CHRIST HAS THE
[23:17] AUTHORITY.
[23:19] AUTHORITY IS YOUR POSITION.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M JUST SITTING IN MY PEW.
[23:25] BUT WHETHER YOU REALIZE OR NOT, JUST
[23:27] SITTING IN YOUR PEW IS A VICTORY.
[23:33] THAT'S GOOD PREACHING.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; JUST COMING TO YOUR POST OF DUTY IS
[23:37] ANOTHER VICTORY.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I DIDN'T HARDLY DO MUCH
[23:41] BETWEEN LAST SUNDAY AND THIS SUNDAY JUST
[23:44] TO STILL BE STANDING. IT'S A VICTORY
[23:48] &gt;&gt; IN THE DARKEST OF LAYA
[23:53] &gt;&gt; IN SATAN'S EDEN. GOD HAS A COVENANT WITH
[23:57] YOU. I WILL KEEP YOU. I WILL LIVE IN
[24:00] YOU.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Go ye into all the world FOR YOU ARE THE
[24:06] WITNESSES AFTER THE HOLY GHOST HAS COME
[24:08] UPON YOU. And what is a WITNESS IS AN
[24:11] AMBASSADOR IS COME TO THE THRONE. THE
[24:14] WITNESS TO SOMETHING WHICH WELL THE
[24:16] WHOLE POWERS OF HEAVEN IS RIGHT IN YOUR
[24:19] HANDS. HE SAYS WHY DO WE SIT AND THE
[24:22] CHURCH IS BARREN AND WE SIT LIKE A
[24:24] DOORMAT? IS BECAUSE WE DON'T RECOGNIZE
[24:27] THESE THINGS.
[24:29] EPHESIANS PARALLELS JOSHUA. HE SAID,
[24:31] "NOW, IF THE UNITED STATES OF THIS FAIR
[24:33] LAND HERE SENT ME OVER TO RUSSIA AS AN
[24:36] AMBASSADOR TO THIS NATION, TO RUSSIA, IF
[24:38] THEY WERE OFFICIALLY sent me to Russia,
[24:41] ALL THE POWER THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS
[24:45] IS BEHIND ME.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; MY WORD IS JUST THE SAME AS AS THE
[24:54] UNITED STATES. IF I HAVE BEEN recognized
[24:58] as an ambassador,
[25:01] THEN IF GOD HAS SENT US TO BE HIS
[25:04] AMBASSADORS,
[25:06] &gt;&gt; ALL THE POWER THAT'S IN HEAVEN,
[25:09] &gt;&gt; ALL THAT GOD IS,
[25:11] &gt;&gt; ALL OF HIS ANGELS, ALL OF HIS POWER
[25:15] STANDS BEHIND OUR WORDS, IF WE'RE
[25:18] CORRECTLY ORDAINED, SENT MESSENGERS TO
[25:21] THE PEOPLE, GOD HAS TO HONOR HIS WORDS
[25:25] FOR HE HAS SOLEMNLY WRITTEN, "WHATSOEVER
[25:28] YOU BIND ON EARTH, THAT I'LL BIND IN
[25:30] HEAVEN."
[25:31] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL GIVE UNTO THEE THE KEYS TO THE
[25:34] KINGDOM.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "SIX GREAT PROMISES." HE HAS
[25:38] GIVEN TO THE CHURCH.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; This may sound redundant, but I WANT TO
[25:42] GO AGAIN. HE SAID JOSHUA STOPPED THE
[25:44] SUN. IS THAT TRUE?
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Some people says, "Oh, he says, SOMEBODY
[25:50] SAID, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH GOD.
[25:51] NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT ALL THINGS ARE
[25:54] POSSIBLE TO YOU ALSO. HE SAID, "NOTHING
[25:57] IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE." ALL
[26:00] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE BROUGHT RIGHT DOWN
[26:03] AND MADE TO YOU IF YOU JUST KNOW WHO GOD
[26:06] IS. HE SAID, "I'M AFRAID THAT THE CHURCH
[26:08] DOESN'T KNOW THEIR AUTHORITY. I'M AFRAID
[26:11] HOLY GHOST MEN, BORN MEN, DOESN'T
[26:14] REALIZE THEIR AUTHORITY OR THE AUTHORITY
[26:17] THAT GOD HAS PERMITTED TO HIS CHURCH.
[26:21] I'LL GIVE UNTO THEE THE KEYS TO THE
[26:23] KINGDOM. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH WILL
[26:25] BE BOUND IN HEAVEN. WHATEVER YOU LOOSE
[26:27] ON EARTH WILL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN. I
[26:30] GIVE YOU POWER OVER SERPENTS AND OVER
[26:32] ALL KINDS OF DISEASES
[26:35] &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING SHALL HARM YOU.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. EXERCISE YOUR FAITH.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; HE SAID LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY.
[26:50] HE SAYS IN WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. I'M
[26:52] SORRY TO BE READING so much, but you can
[26:54] forgive me if you will. HE SAID, "THEN
[26:56] IF JESUS DEFEATED SATAN UPON THE FAITH,
[27:00] KNOWING WHO HE WAS,
[27:02] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PREDESTINATED CREATURE." HE
[27:04] SAID, "ARE you ready?" HE SAID, "WHAT
[27:06] ABOUT A PREDESTINATED BRIDE OF JESUS
[27:09] CHRIST RIGHT NOW?"
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT WE CAN RECOGNIZE WHO JESUS IS.
[27:18] That's good. That's good.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Well, don't you love the Lord?
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he does. I just want to
[27:25] go to some place here. Wasn't quite
[27:27] ready to go there, but I want to go
[27:29] there. WHEN JOHN SAW HIM IN REVELATION
[27:32] chapter one, he said, "I FELL AT HIS
[27:34] FEET AS DEAD."
[27:37] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO JUST READ YOU A COUPLE OF
[27:39] titles
[27:41] of what OUR LORD JESUS TITLES THAT
[27:44] BELONG TO HIM.
[27:47] He was the advocate,
[27:50] &gt;&gt; THE ALMIGHTY,
[27:52] &gt;&gt; THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE AMEN OF REVELATIONS 3, the
[27:58] angel of HIS PRESENCE, THE ANOINTED ONE,
[28:02] THE APOSTLE, THE ARM OF THE LORD, the
[28:05] author and the finisher of our faith,
[28:08] the beginning, the end OF THE CREATION
[28:10] OF GOD. HE WAS THE BELOVED. HE WAS THE
[28:13] BLESSED ONE. HE WAS THE BREAD OF LIFE.
[28:16] HE IS OUR BRIDEGROOM. HE IS THE BRIDE
[28:19] AND THE MORNING STAR. HE IS THE CAPTAIN
[28:22] OF THE LORD'S HOST. HE IS THE CAPTAIN OF
[28:25] OUR SALVATION. HE IS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD.
[28:28] HE IS THE CHIEFEST AMONG 10 THOUSANDS.
[28:31] HE IS THE CHOSEN OF GOD. HE IS CHRIST,
[28:34] THE ANOINTED ONE. HE IS OUR LORD. HE IS
[28:38] THE WISDOM OF GOD. HE IS THE BLESSED
[28:41] ONE. HE IS THE COMMANDER. HE IS THE
[28:43] COUNSELOR. HE IS THE COVENANT OF THE
[28:46] PEOPLE. HE IS THE DAY STAR. HE IS THE
[28:49] DESIRE OF ALL NATION. HE'S THE DOOR
[28:51] WITHIN THE DOOR.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; HE IS EMMANUEL. HE IS THE INSIDE. HE IS
[28:58] THE ETERNAL LIFE. HE'S THE EVERLASTING
[29:01] FATHER. HE'S THE FAITHFUL AND THE TRUE
[29:03] WITNESS.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; He is THE AUTHOR AND THE FINISHER OF OUR
[29:09] FAITH. AGAIN, HE SAID HE'S FOR THE FIRST
[29:11] BEGOTTEN. HE'S THE FOUNDATION. HE'S THE
[29:14] FORERUNNER. HE'S THE FRIEND OF SINNERS.
[29:17] HE IS THE GIFT OF GOD. HE'S THE BLESSED
[29:20] ONE.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH. HE IS
[29:24] THE GOVERNOR. HE IS THE MASTER. HE IS
[29:27] THE GREAT SHEPHERD OF THE SHEEP. HE'S
[29:29] THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEIR OF
[29:32] ALL THINGS. HE IS OUR HIGH PRIEST. HE IS
[29:35] THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN. HE'S THE HEAD OF
[29:37] THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE CORNER.
[29:40] HE'S THE HOLY CHILD, JESUS. HE IS THE
[29:43] HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL. HE'S THE HOLY ONE OF
[29:45] GOD. HE IS THAT HOLY THING. HE IS THE
[29:49] HOPE. HE IS THE HORN OF OUR SALVATION.
[29:52] HE IS THE IMAGE OF GOD. HE IS ISRAEL. HE
[29:56] IS THE I AM THAT I AM.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO STOP RIGHT THERE. ONE TITLE.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; CAN I STOP WITH JUST ONE TITLE HERE JUST
[30:05] FOR A MOMENT?
[30:07] &gt;&gt; ONE TITLE.
[30:08] WHEN WHEN MOSES, THE PROPHET OF GOD, WAS
[30:11] STANDING BEFORE THAT BURNING BUSH,
[30:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "TELL ME WHO YOU ARE." HE SAID,
[30:18] "JUST TELL THEM THAT I AM THAT I AM
[30:25] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST NATION ON THE WHOLE EARTH,
[30:27] THE GREATEST WISDOM, THE GREATEST
[30:30] MILITARY POWER FELL TO THE TITLE OF I AM
[30:34] THAT I AM.
[30:40] Let me just SAY THIS TO YOU. JESUS
[30:41] CHRIST WILL NEVER BE JUST ONE OF THE
[30:44] BOYS.
[30:53] HEBREWS CHAPTER 1. GOD WHO AT SUNDER
[30:56] TIMES AND IN DIVERSE MANNER SPAKE IN
[30:58] TIMES PAST unto the prophets uh h and
[31:02] TIMES PAST UNTO THE FATHERS BY THE
[31:04] PROPHETS HATH IN THESE LAST DAYS SPOKEN
[31:07] TO US BY HIS SON whom hath appointed
[31:10] heir of ALL THINGS BY WHOM ALSO HE MADE
[31:14] THE WORLDS WHO BE THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS
[31:16] GLORY AND THE EXPRESS IMAGE OF HIS
[31:19] PERSON UPHOLDING ALL THINGS BY THE WORD
[31:22] of his power WHEN HE HAD BY HIMSELF SELF
[31:24] PURGED OUR SINS, SAT down at the right
[31:27] hand of THE MAJESTY ON HIGH, BEING MADE
[31:30] SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ANGELS, AS HE
[31:33] HATH BY AN INHERITANCE OBTAINED A MORE
[31:36] EXCELLENT NAME THAN THEY.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; For unto WHICH THE ANGEL SAID, HE AT ANY
[31:41] TIME THOU ART MY SON, THIS DAY HAVE I
[31:44] BEGOTTEN THEE, AND AGAIN I WILL BE TO
[31:46] HIM A FATHER, AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A
[31:49] SON. AND AGAIN, WHEN HE BRINGETH THE
[31:51] FIRST BEGOTTEN INTO THE WORLD, HE SAID,
[31:53] "AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP
[31:55] HIM." AND OF ALL THE ANGELS, HE SAID,
[31:57] "WHO MAKETH HIS ANGEL SPIRITS AND HIS
[31:59] MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE?" BUT UNTO THE
[32:02] SON, HE SAID, "THY THRONE, OH GOD, IS
[32:05] FOREVER AND EVER A SCEPTER OF
[32:08] RIGHTEOUSNESS. IT IS A SCEPTER OF THY
[32:10] KINGDOM. THOU HAST LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
[32:12] AND HATED INIQUITY. THEREFORE, GOD, EVEN
[32:16] THY GOD, HATH ANOINTED THEE WITH THE ALL
[32:19] OF GLADNESS ABOVE THY FELLOWS.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Ron, many didn't
[32:31] recognize
[32:33] who Jesus was."
[32:35] TRUE. MANY DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; People wait on you in restaurants.
[32:44] They work on you in hospitals.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; You work with them shouldertosh
[32:49] shoulder,
[32:50] &gt;&gt; arm to arm.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; And once in a while, YOU BEGIN TO TELL
[32:54] THEM ABOUT SOMETHING THAT LAYS JUST
[32:56] BENEATH THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE HOPE OF
[33:04] YOUR SALVATION.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE BRIGHT
[33:09] AND THE MORNING STAR. YOU BEGIN TO TELL
[33:12] THE WORLD ABOUT A JESUS THAT IS MORE
[33:15] THAN ONE OF 2,000 YEARS AGO.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ONE THAT HE IS MY
[33:21] PERSONAL GOD. HE IS THE ONE THAT LIVES
[33:23] IN MY HEART. HE IS THE BREATH. HE IS THE
[33:26] HEARTBEAT THAT IS INSIDE OF ME.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY ME AS MY I AM HIS SON, BUT
[33:33] ALSO I AM HIS BRIDE.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, you say, "BROTHER RON,
[33:40] THAT'S SO HARD TO CONVINCE." IT WAS FOR
[33:42] JESUS AS WELL.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO JUST DROP A COUPLE OF
[33:50] THINGS right here.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; There was a WOMAN THAT HAD A PROBLEM
[33:57] &gt;&gt; AND SHE HAD A NEED.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD WENT TO THE WELL MANY TIMES WITH
[34:05] HER NEED.
[34:08] NOW, SHE NEEDED THE COVENANT.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED THE CAPTAIN OF A SALVATION.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED A GREAT HIGH PRIEST.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED ONE THAT COULD NOT ONLY BE A
[34:20] PREACHER TO HER, BUT HE COULD DELIVER
[34:22] HER
[34:23] &gt;&gt; and reach down into the UTTERMOST AND
[34:26] CHANGE THE VERY VILEENESS OF HER LIFE.
[34:32] SHE HAD WALKED BY MANY PREACHERS AND
[34:34] THEY FAILED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT UNTO
[34:37] HER.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD HEARD OF THERE WAS A MESSIAH
[34:41] THAT WAS COMING.
[34:44] BUT ONE DAY SITTING AT THE WELL,
[34:47] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A MAN
[34:50] &gt;&gt; WHO HAD ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD DWELLING
[34:53] WITHIN HIM.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; A MAN WITH A BEARD. A MAN THAT WAS WHAT
[34:59] YOU MIGHT SAY UNRECOGNIZABLE TO THE
[35:02] POPULAR WHO'S WHO.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT RECOGNIZED WITH ANY CARDS OF
[35:08] ANY DENOMINATIONAL CHARACTERS.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A PART OF THE SANHEDRIN
[35:12] COUNCIL. THAT THIS HIGH PRIEST,
[35:16] &gt;&gt; this Lord Jesus,
[35:18] &gt;&gt; AS HE WAS SITTING THERE, AS HE WAS
[35:21] STANDING THERE THAT DAY, LET ME JUST SAY
[35:24] THIS TO YOU, WOULD NOT LEAVE HER THE
[35:26] SAME WAY THAT SHE WALKED IN.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; I TRUST THAT THIS CAMP HAS TOUCHED MANY
[35:32] OF YOUR HEARTS.
[35:35] And I WANT YOU TO REALIZE IT'S NOT THE
[35:38] PERSONALITY OF MEN,
[35:40] &gt;&gt; but it's THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT
[35:42] CHANGES our lives.
[35:45] MEN GO ABOUT THEIR BUSY LIVES DOING THIS
[35:47] AND DOING MISSION WORK, GOING BACK TO
[35:49] THEIR CHURCHES AND DOING THAT. BUT THE
[35:51] GOD THAT HAS CHANGED YOUR LIFE, HE'LL GO
[35:54] HOME WITH YOU. HE'LL LIVE WITH YOU.
[35:56] HE'LL ABIDE WITH YOU. HE WILL KEEP YOU.
[36:05] He began to speak to her about her
[36:06] weakness.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; She, like probably a couple of you, had
[36:15] some weaknesses.
[36:19] Her weakness
[36:22] was keeping her from going deeper.
[36:27] And when her weaknesses were revealed,
[36:31] he told HER ABOUT A WATER THAT SHE WOULD
[36:34] NEVER THIRST AGAIN.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; This woman when SHE LEFT THE WELL THAT
[36:40] DAY WAS NEVER NEVER NEVER THE SAME.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN TRULY MEET him
[36:48] &gt;&gt; in a in a way TO WHERE THAT HE COMES IN
[36:52] THAT SOLEMN PRESENCE.
[36:54] Oh yeah, that's good.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST
[36:59] ELOHAZER'S VOICE?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST THE
[37:03] PASTOR'S VOICE?
[37:05] &gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST THE
[37:07] THE THE INSPIRATION OF THE SONG LEADER?
[37:10] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CATCH THAT ANOINTING OF THAT
[37:13] PERSONAGE OF THE EXPRESS PERSON OF JESUS
[37:16] CHRIST REVEALED TO YOU.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; LET HIM COME TO YOUR PEW. LET HIM COME
[37:20] TO YOUR HOME. LET HIM CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
[37:24] HALLELUJAH.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, THIS MESSAGE IS
[37:27] ALL ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM. You're
[37:28] missing it.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PREACH."
[37:36] &gt;&gt; THE ATTACHMENT OF THE HONEY IS WHAT
[37:39] CAUGHT SOME OF OUR OUR THOUGHTS.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; THE WAY HE WORE HIS BLUE JEAN SHIRT
[37:43] CAUGHT SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS. THE WAY HE
[37:45] SPOKE HIS LANGUAGE CAUGHT SOME OF OUR
[37:48] THOUGHTS.
[37:51] BUT IT WAS THE BAIT ON THE HOOK.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; THE MIRACLES AND THE SIGNS AND THE
[37:55] WONDERS.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, GOD
[37:58] DEPOSITED A MESSAGE.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; HE REVISITED A COVENANT FOR THE BRIDE OF
[38:06] JESUS CHRIST. AND HE BE WHISPER SECRETS
[38:10] TO YOU.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED TO CALL YOU FROM THE KITCHEN,
[38:15] FROM THE LIVING ROOM, AND TAKE YOU TO
[38:17] THE BEDROOM.
[38:20] HE WANTS YOU TO BE MORE THAN JUST A
[38:22] FLIRTATIOUS GIRLFRIEND. HE WANTS YOU TO
[38:25] BECOME HIS BRIDE.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're sitting HERE IN THE
[38:31] INTRODUCTION STAGE, BUT I WANT YOU TO
[38:34] KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL WIFE THAT IS
[38:39] SITTING OVER HERE. IT WAS MY MOTHER WHO
[38:41] INTRODUCED ME TO her
[38:45] and I went and I met her. I THOUGHT,
[38:47] "WOW, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL."
[38:50] You know, AND BUT YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS I
[38:52] DROVE TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO SEE HER,
[38:55] you know, that was nice.
[38:57] But, YOU KNOW, WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE
[38:59] STORIES. WE COULD TALK ON THE PHONE. YOU
[39:01] KNOW, YOU GUYS THAT'S BEEN THERE.
[39:04] BUT, you know, I wanted more.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; I WANTED MORE. THERE'S A LONGING IN MY
[39:13] HEART, A LONGING IN HER HEART.
[39:16] And we begin TO ENTER INTO A covenant
[39:20] &gt;&gt; of engagement.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; WE ENTERED INTO A COVENANT OF
[39:26] ENGAGEMENT. NOW THERE'S NO MORE GIRLS
[39:29] AND NO MORE BOYS.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; MAYBE FOUR BILLION PEOPLE IN THE EARTH,
[39:34] BUT THERE'S ONE VOICE THAT I WANT TO
[39:36] HEAR ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE PERSON I WANT TO HEAR SAY,
[39:42] "GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. I LOVE YOU."
[39:44] THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT I WANT TO BE MY
[39:47] BEST FRIEND OF MY WHOLE LIFE.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE STEPPED OUT OF ETERNITY INTO
[39:53] A SPACE OF TIME AND WE'LL SHARE THIS
[39:55] LIFE TOGETHER. ONE DAY WE'LL STEP BACK
[39:58] INTO ETERNITY AGAIN.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; BUT WE MUST TAKE STEPS GOING FORWARD.
[40:05] IT'S MORE THAN A PICTURE ON THE WALL.
[40:08] IT'S MORE THAN JUST WORDS BEING
[40:10] EXCHANGED. BUT ONE DAY THERE'S AN THERE
[40:13] IS A RING THAT IS EXCHANGED. THERE'S
[40:15] VOWS THAT IS EXCHANGED.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO ENTER INTO THAT
[40:25] COVENANT
[40:27] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS YOU'RE JUST FLIRTING WITH IT.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS YOU'RE JUST FLIRTING WITH IT
[40:36] &gt;&gt; FOR THE BENEFITS that you get.
[40:40] Come on, church.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Many people sit around just for the
[40:42] benefits.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I pay my tithes for the benefits. AND
[40:46] THERE ARE BENEFITS.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; I GIVE OFFERINGS FOR THE BENEFITS. I
[40:50] WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S A BENEFIT THAT
[40:52] COMES WITH THAT.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY JUST
[40:55] SIT HERE FOR THE BENEFITS WHEN you can
[40:57] have the whole package.
[41:00] Hallelujah.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; SO MANY PEOPLE ROB THEMSELVES ONLY
[41:05] SITTING MAYBE A STEP AWAY FROM TRULY
[41:09] SURRENDERING THEIR LIVES
[41:11] &gt;&gt; AND ENTERING INTO THE COVENANT WHERE THE
[41:14] I AM
[41:15] &gt;&gt; WHERE OUR HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOM ENTERS
[41:18] INTO THE BRIDE CHAMBER OF OUR LIVES.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER EVERY TITLE THAT
[41:26] BELONGS TO him Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Belongs to me.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Don't swallow your tongue. You'll be
[41:37] okay.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Because remember in the breach he WAS A
[41:43] KING. HE STEPPED FORTH FROM THE THRONE.
[41:48] HE STEPPED FORTH AND HE SAID THROUGHOUT
[41:51] THE THE THE CHURCH AGES HE HAD BEEN THE
[41:53] HIGH PRIEST. BUT HE STEPS FORTH IN THIS
[41:56] AGE AND BECOMES KING. AND HE'S LOOKING
[41:59] FOR HIS QUEEN.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID HE HAS TO HAVE SUBJECTS.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; I'm one.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a couple more here.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; THE WOMAN FROM MEMPHIS WAS LOOKING FOR
[42:22] ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS. YES, SIR.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS CARRYING SOME MAIL BECAUSE
[42:27] HIS PLANE HAD BEEN GROUNDED.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING DOWN THROUGH THERE
[42:31] SINGING THE SONG, I'M ONE of them.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[42:40] them.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Just keep walking.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[42:49] them.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, HANEY. GOOD MORNING,
[42:52] PARSON.
[42:54] HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS A PARSONATE?
[42:56] &gt;&gt; I WAS PRAYING
[42:58] &gt;&gt; I'LL BE LIKE THAT SUDOMITE WOMAN.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; SHE IDENTIFIED HERSELF IN THE SCRIPTURE.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE SEALS. SHE HAD NOT
[43:10] HEARD SHALOM BECAUSE THEY HADN'T BEEN
[43:12] PREACHED YET. SHE HAD NOT HEARD THOSE
[43:14] MESSAGES. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW SHE
[43:16] KNEW THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK.
[43:21] YOU'RE SITTING here and you may be a new
[43:22] Christian. YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I
[43:24] DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL." AS LONG AS YOU
[43:26] IDENTIFY WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK,
[43:30] &gt;&gt; HE WILL BEGIN TO PULL ON YOUR LIFE.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; HE WILL BEGIN TO SHOW YOU FROM ONE DAY
[43:35] TO ANOTHER DAY TO ANOTHER DAY. ARE YOU
[43:38] WITH ME,
[43:40] &gt;&gt; BROTHER? I'VE BEEN HERE 5 YEARS. I STILL
[43:42] DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL. GOD WILL
[43:44] THROUGHOUT THE ETERNITIES EVER BE
[43:46] UNFOLDING HIS MYSTERIES TO YOU AND I.
[43:59] WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WALKED INTO HER
[44:00] ROOM, I just want to leave this is free
[44:01] of charge. When Brother Brandham walked
[44:04] into her home,
[44:06] Brother Brandham
[44:09] ask her to pray.
[44:17] He didn't walk into that home and said,
[44:18] "I'm here.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; You called for Elijah. I'm here.
[44:27] I'm fulfilling your scripture. I'm
[44:29] here."
[44:32] He said HE WALKED IN THERE AND
[44:33] RECOGNIZED THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Saw the pictures on the wall.
[44:43] SAW DEATH ON THAT BOY.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; NOTICE WHAT HE SAYS. AIN'T HE? WON'T YOU
[44:48] PRAY?
[44:52] &gt;&gt; OH, that's good.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, but I'm just going to say
[44:54] it.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Probably too ignorant to not say it.
[44:59] Many TV EVANGELISTS WOULD SAY, "I'M
[45:01] HERE."
[45:02] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S GOOD. PREACH IT.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; I'm here. I'M ON THE SCENE. BUT THAT
[45:10] PROPHET OF GOD WAS AWARE THAT THE I AM
[45:14] THAT I AM
[45:16] &gt;&gt; WAS ALREADY THERE.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WAS GOING TO CONFIRM HIS WORD TO
[45:22] THIS LITTLE LADY.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WOULD DO THAT FOR HER, HOW
[45:29] MUCH MORE FOR YOU?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[45:38] He said, "I am so glad I WANT TO READ
[45:40] SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU. I'M SO GLAD THAT
[45:42] A MAN CAN SO COMPLETELY SERVE GOD TILL
[45:44] THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
[45:46] HIM."
[45:52] JESUS CHRIST. NO MATTER IF HE WAS IN A
[45:54] STORM, THE GALE WAS KNOCKING THE BOAT
[45:57] FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER, OR HE WAS
[45:59] STANDING IN THE FACE OF A MESS OF
[46:00] DEMONS, if he was hanging anywhere, he
[46:03] never, it never moved him. HE WALKED
[46:07] RIGHT ALONG JUST AS CALM AND QUIET AS HE
[46:10] COULD BE. WHY? HE WAS SIMPLY unconscious
[46:15] of fear. Anything around him, WHETHER IT
[46:19] WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHETHER IT WASN'T
[46:21] GOING TO HAPPEN, HE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO
[46:24] HAPPEN BECAUSE GOD SAID IT WOULD. HE
[46:27] SAID, "OH, WONDER IF I PRAYED THROUGH. I
[46:29] WONDERED IF I FASTED LONG ENOUGH. I
[46:31] WONDER IF I DID THIS." HE JUST WALKED
[46:34] RIGHT ON UNCONSCIOUS. HE BELIEVED WHAT
[46:38] GOD SAID WAS THE TRUTH. THE WORDS MUST
[46:40] BE FULFILLED. AND HE KNOWED WHAT HIS
[46:42] LIFE WAS TO FULFILL THEM. AND THAT WAS
[46:45] RIGHT. HE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF
[46:48] THE FAITH THAT HE HAD. HE JUST SPOKE IT
[46:51] AND KNEW IT WOULD BE SO.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "WE HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE SAY,
[46:59] "WELL, IF I ONLY HAD FAITH."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; FAITH ISN'T IT DOESN'T MEAN DOWN DRAWN
[47:05] OUT LONG PRAYER MEETINGS. IT DOESN'T
[47:07] MEAN LONG FA FAST. HE SAID FAITH IS AN
[47:11] UNCONSCIOUS THING.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; YOUR REAL FAITH. You're unconscious of
[47:15] it.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAYS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE FAITH
[47:18] THAT YOU HAVE GOT, IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS
[47:21] MATTER WITH YOU. COULD YOU IMAGINE JESUS
[47:24] QUESTIONING WHETHER HE HAD FAITH OR NOT
[47:27] TO STOP THE WINDS OR STOP THE WAVES OR
[47:30] HAVE FAITH ENOUGH TO RAISE LAZARUS UP?
[47:33] HE NEVER QUESTIONED HIS OWN FAITH.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; JESUS DIDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND FAST ALL
[47:42] DAY AND PRAY ALL DAY and he THEN SAY,
[47:45] "NOW I WONDER IF I'VE GOT ENOUGH FAITH
[47:47] TO DO THIS." HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE
[47:49] FAITH THAT HE HAD. ANY men or women that
[47:52] ever make a REAL WARRIORS IN THE KINGDOM
[47:54] OF GOD IS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR
[47:58] FAITH. YOU KEEP TRYING TO TEST YOUR
[48:00] FAITH. WONDER IF I'VE GOT FAITH ENOUGH
[48:01] TO DO THIS. HAVE I GOT FAITH? HE SAYS
[48:03] DON'T TEST YOUR FAITH. GOD SAID SO. DO
[48:06] IT ANYHOW.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAID FAITH KNOWS NO DEFEAT.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS PERFECT. FAITH BRINGS HE SAYS
[48:16] FAITH BRINGS THINGS WHEN THERE IS NO
[48:18] THINGS TO BE BROUGHT. FAITH CREATES.
[48:21] FAITH TAKES DOUBT AWAY. IT TAKES
[48:23] NEGATIVE AND MAKES POSITIVE. THE OLD MAN
[48:26] HAD A BASIS FOR FAITH. FAITH IS NOT
[48:28] MYTHICAL, SOMETHING MENTALLY WORKED UP.
[48:31] IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE FUNDAMENTAL RESULT
[48:34] OF WHAT HAPPENS IN A PERSON'S HEART.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Ron, I I'd like
[48:43] for you to just share an experience with
[48:44] me on that." Okay, LET ME JUST TAKE YOU
[48:46] BACK TO THE COVENANT. THERE WAS A MAN
[48:48] THAT KEPT HAVING DEMONS COME TO HIS
[48:50] HOUSE EVERY YEAR.
[48:52] HE WOULD PLANT HIS HE WOULD PLANT HIS
[48:54] FIELDS. HE WOULD HARVEST HIS FIELDS. AND
[48:57] JUST AS HE HARVESTES HIS FIELDS,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD SEND THE PHILISTINE ARMY DOWN
[49:02] there
[49:03] &gt;&gt; and they would take everything that he
[49:05] HAD, BUT LEAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP
[49:07] HIM IN CHURCH FOR THE NEXT YEAR.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; THEY'D LEAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH SAVED AND
[49:15] JUST ENOUGH TO LET HIM EAT FOR THE NEXT
[49:16] YEAR.
[49:20] NOW, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T
[49:23] IDENTIFY WITH THE COVENANT,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; THAT PHILISTINE ARMY HAD NO PROBLEM.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; WELL, BOYS, IT'S TIME TO GO MAKE A RAID.
[49:35] LET'S GO OVER TO SHAMGAR'S house
[49:38] &gt;&gt; and LET'S TAKE HIS STUFF. LET'S JUST
[49:41] LITERALLY RAVISH HIM. YEAH.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And they DID IT YEAR AFTER year after
[49:47] year after YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT ONE DAY,
[49:55] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE RECOGNIZED A part
[49:58] &gt;&gt; of the covenant
[50:02] &gt;&gt; and MAYBE HE RUN ACROSS THE SCRIPTURE.
[50:05] Forgive me for my folly. BUT MAYBE HE
[50:08] RUN ACROSS THIS SCRIPTURE AND IT SAID,
[50:10] "ONE MAN
[50:11] &gt;&gt; SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND."
[50:18] &gt;&gt; ONE MAN SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE 45,000 PHONE
[50:22] CALLS TO HELP ME. HE SAID, "ONE MAN
[50:24] SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; MAYBE HE GOT THE COUNTING HIS ENEMY.
[50:38] HEY, THEY ONLY BROUGHT 600.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; They got the trumpeting up through there
[50:57] EVERY YEAR. SAME DEAL. SAME DEAL. SAME
[51:00] DEAL. SAME DEAL. BUT THIS TIME HE
[51:03] COUNTED THEM.
[51:05] AND THEY WERE 401 SHORT.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; That's
[51:15] good.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE 401 SHORT. THE COVENANT SAID,
[51:20] "I CAN HAVE A THOUSAND OF THEM."
[51:24] &gt;&gt; AND HE JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW
[51:27] &gt;&gt; AND HE GRABBED A SIX-FOOT STICK.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I'D HAVE BEEN AFRAID.
[51:32] LISTEN, HE KNEW IT WAS NOT HIM THAT WAS
[51:35] KNOWING
[51:38] BECAUSE GOD SAID, "I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; I WILL DO THE FIGHTING. I WILL DRIVE
[51:46] THEM OUT. I WILL DO THE WORK.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S HIM THAT IS IN YOU."
[52:00] Brother Ron, I'm afraid that WHEN I
[52:02] LEAVE THIS CAMP AND I GO BACK IN THREE
[52:04] weeks
[52:06] that here I'll COME. I'LL HEAR THEM HOOF
[52:08] BEATS AGAIN.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; I'LL HEAR THE BEAT OF THAT ROCK AND
[52:13] ROLL.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I'LL FEEL THAT COOL LUKEWARM SPIRIT OF
[52:20] LEOSIA CREEPING BACK INTO MY HOME AGAIN.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I'LL GO BACK TO THE THINGS THAT I USED
[52:27] TO BE ENTERTAINED BY.
[52:30] YOU KEEP FEEDING THIS EXPERIENCE.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Oprah Winfrey DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING
[52:41] FAITH.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; SPORTS DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; TELEVISION DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING
[52:51] FAITH.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Come on church, LET ME PREACH. BENNY
[52:54] HYMN DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. THE
[52:57] DENOMINATIONS DO NOT HAVE RAPTURING
[52:59] FAITH.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; THIS WORD HAS RAPTURING FAITH.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I LIKE THEIR REASONING.
[53:14] THEY SAY SOME GOOD THINGS ABOUT FAMILY
[53:16] THINGS. SO DOES BROTHER BRANDHAM.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, THEY'RE GETTING A
[53:23] LOT OF THEIR MATERIAL FROM BROTHER
[53:24] BRHAM.
[53:29] AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GET IT FROM A
[53:31] MIXED TREE TO START OFF WITH
[53:33] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU CAN HAVE IT RIGHT STRAIGHT
[53:35] &gt;&gt; FROM THE AUTHOR and the finish of our
[53:38] faith.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE STRONG.
[53:45] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE THE BRIDE.
[53:47] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO OVERCOME. NOTICE THE
[53:50] SCRIPTURE SAYS, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE
[53:52] DOOR AND KNOCK."
[53:53] IT DOESN'T SAY TO THEM. IT SAYS TO HIM.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; TO THAT ONE THAT OVERCOMETH.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BE the only one in your
[54:04] family.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Grab your stick.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; GRAB YOUR STICK.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; GO TO WORK.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Hold my brother on. I hear the
[54:22] footprints. I HEAR THE STOMPING OF THAT
[54:24] OF THAT HORSE COMING DOWN THROUGH THERE.
[54:26] JUST START QUOTING SCRIPTURE.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; IT HAS ATOMIC power to it.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; GREATER IS HE
[54:33] &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME
[54:35] &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Faith muscle starts swelling.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; I don't have many, so you just have to
[54:42] bear with me.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; If ye abide in me AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN
[54:47] YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE
[54:49] DONE UNTO YOU. AND YOU FEEL ANOTHER BUMP
[54:52] OF FAITH.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU
[54:57] &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL YOUR FAITH MUSCLE START
[54:59] POPPING UP.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; HEY, LISTEN. IT'S AN UNFAIR FIGHT. THEY
[55:03] DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH DEVILS.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; When a man lives BY FAITH AND WALKS BY
[55:15] FAITH, HE'S A SUBSTANCE OF FAITH. HE IS
[55:18] ISOLATED FROM THE ENTIRE world and
[55:19] becomes a new creature in Christ.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS NOW HE SAYS THERE NOW YOU'RE
[55:25] GETTING INTO BRIDE MATERIAL. YOU'RE
[55:27] GETTING INTO RAPTURING CONDITION.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS FOR EACH ONE OF US, NOT JUST
[55:32] FOR THE PASTOR, FOR THE DEACON, FOR THE
[55:35] TRUSTEE. THAT MEANS FOR THE LEY, EVERY
[55:39] INDIVIDUAL WALKS IN A WORLD WITH GOD
[55:41] ALONE.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BAPTIZED INTO THE KINGDOM. HE
[55:46] SAID THERE IS NOBODY IN THERE BUT YOU
[55:49] AND GOD. HE GIVES THE ORDERS, YOU CARRY
[55:53] THEM OUT.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Now join a man joins the military.
[56:03] You know, maybe he had a chief petty
[56:05] officer that told him, he said, "You
[56:08] might want to bring your golf clubs
[56:12] when you go to boot camp.
[56:16] you might want to take your tennis
[56:17] racket.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; SO HE GETS OFF OF THE BUS WITH ALL OF
[56:22] THIS STUFF ON HIS BACK.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; HE'S THINKING HE'S GOING TO CALL HIS
[56:31] MAMA 14 TIMES A DAY.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A MAN THAT'S STANDING THERE
[56:37] IN FRONT OF HIM SAYS, "I'M YOUR MAMA.
[56:40] I'm your daddy.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I'M YOUR UNCLE. I'M YOUR AUNT. I'M YOUR
[56:46] COUSIN, MAYBEL.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I'LL GET YOU UP. I'LL PUT YOU TO SLEEP.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; I'LL DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S GOING TO MAKE A SOLDIER OUT OF
[57:00] YOU.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THERE'S 10,000 OF THEM ALL IN
[57:07] THE SAME SECTION.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; AND THEY START WALKING ACROSS THE
[57:10] BRIDGE. YOU OUGHT TO HEAR WHAT A THUNDER
[57:12] THEY ARE.
[57:15] ALL OF THEM OUT OF ORDER.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; But give him a few weeks.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; HE'LL BRING THINGS OUT OF THEM THEY
[57:28] NEVER THOUGHT WAS IN THERE.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT ONLY WALK FIVE MILES,
[57:34] THEY'LL RUN FIVE MILES.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And there's something in THEM THAT KNOWS
[57:38] THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR WAR AND
[57:40] THEY'LL SAY, "I LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
[57:42] THEY'LL CHARGE THE HILL.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE READY. THAT THAT JUST THAT
[57:47] SERGEANT'S VOICE. THEY'RE TUNED TO THE
[57:49] VOICE OF THAT SERGEANT
[57:53] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE LISTENING FOR THE COMMAND
[57:55] AND THEY'RE GETTING READY. THEY'RE
[57:58] GETTING READY. THERE'S SOMETHING THEY'RE
[58:00] GETTING READY FOR.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; NOW THAT GOVERNMENT, HE GIVES THEM THE
[58:05] BEST CLOTHING THAT THEY CAN HAVE FOR
[58:07] MILITARY. RIGHT.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; SOME DISCLAIMER THERE.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; THEN HE GIVES THEM THE best
[58:17] armor that he can give them.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; NOW, GOD DOES IT MUCH THE SAME WAY.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; HE SENDS US THROUGH BOOT CAMP.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE WALK RIGHT OUT OF
[58:32] DENOMINATIONALISM AND we looked a
[58:37] Yes, sir.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; WE WALK RIGHT OUT OF THE WORLD and maybe
[58:45] you was looking over at that guy and
[58:46] say, "He'll never stick.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; I give him six weeks.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Hair down to his shoulders.
[59:00] pierced ears,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; tattoos,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; terrible life.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And God starts taking that bulldozer.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; HE STARTS TAKING THE WATER OF THE WORD.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And he starts cleaning up habits.
[59:25] He starts sanctifying.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; He starts purifying.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; He's not GOING TO JUST LEAVE YOU IN THAT
[59:33] CONDITION.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BATTLE THAT YOU'VE GOT.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'RE NOT CALL TO A PICNIC.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; A REAL SOLDIER DON'T PACK COOKIES.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO SIT AROUND PLAY CARDS
[59:50] ALL THE TIME.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HE'S GOT TO GET READY FOR A
[59:53] BATTLE. AMEN.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT SERGEANT IS A GOOD SERGEANT,
[59:57] HE'S GOING TO TRAIN IT WHEN YOU GET IN A
[59:59] BIND AND YOU'RE BY YOURSELF.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DROP YOU BEHIND ENEMY LINES,
[1:00:07] WHICH WE WILL,
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, YOU'RE A WARRIOR.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, THAT SEEMS VICIOUS. GOD
[1:00:18] PRE-PLANNED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:00:20] THE WORLD. AMEN.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; He picked you out of A MILLION.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; HE BYPASSED A MILLION.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; TO TALK TO YOU.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; OH, THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH BETTER
[1:00:39] EDUCATION.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS PEOPLE THAT LOOK BETTER THAN
[1:00:45] YOU DID.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
[1:00:51] THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT HE
[1:00:53] IDENTIFIED WITH. IT WAS A PART OF HIS
[1:00:55] OWN SIN.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; He's looking through all the ages.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; So he picks his best for this day.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:19] We got a few more minutes.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DON'T NEED SURVIVORS OF LEOA.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T NEED PEOPLE THAT JUST GET BY.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS PEOPLE THAT are overcomers.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; I'd like to put IT LIKE THIS. HE NEEDS
[1:01:46] SOME CHAMPIONS.
[1:01:48] OF
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; LEOTA.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS SOME MEN AND WOMEN
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN DROP INTO THE DARKEST AGE.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; AND ONE DAY DISCOVER
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; THAT ABOUT THEMSELVES.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:11] NOW, IT'S ONE THING FOR MOSES, HIS
[1:02:13] MOTHER, TO TELL HIM OVER AND OVER AND
[1:02:15] OVER AGAIN, YOU ARE THE DELIVERER,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR YOU TO HEAR
[1:02:21] IT FROM YOUR MAS AND YOUR DADDIES, AND
[1:02:24] YOU HEAR IT FROM THE PROPHET, AND THEN
[1:02:26] ONE DAY YOU REALIZE,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED FOR.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED FOR.
[1:02:40] THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED FOR.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN PREDESTINATED
[1:02:45] FOR.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER
[1:02:56] FOR THE GOOD TO THEM THAT LOVE GOD,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; TO THEM WHO ARE THE CALLED
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING to his purpose.
[1:03:06] FOR WHOM HE DID FORNO,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; HE DID ALSO PREDESTINATE
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; TO BE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF HIS SON,
[1:03:13] THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRSTBORN AMONG
[1:03:15] MANY BRETHREN.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; MOREOVER, WHOM HE DID PREDESTINATE,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; THEM HE ALSO CALLED.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; AND WHOM HE CALLED, HE ALSO JUSTIFIED.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, THEM HE ALSO
[1:03:28] GLORIFIED.
[1:03:32] SO, NOT ONLY DID HE CALL YOU TO THIS
[1:03:34] DAY,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; HE HAS ALREADY JUSTIFIED YOU.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER SINNED IN
[1:03:41] THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And you realize it wasn't even you to
[1:03:46] start off with.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; A friend of mine showed up here a while
[1:03:55] back and he sat down with me for lunch.
[1:03:58] an old friend from many many years ago
[1:04:01] back when I had locks down on my
[1:04:03] shoulders.
[1:04:08] And he sat down and we we just talked
[1:04:09] and I thought I'll just let him talk for
[1:04:11] a few minutes. We sat at McDonald's and
[1:04:14] I had coffee.
[1:04:17] I didn't figure we would have much time
[1:04:18] for lunch.
[1:04:21] And so simply put,
[1:04:24] he began to talk about the old times.
[1:04:28] I figured he would because that's the
[1:04:30] one that he knew.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I looked over at him and I said, "Uh, I
[1:04:36] need to tell you something."
[1:04:39] He said, "Oh." I said, "Yeah." I said,
[1:04:42] "YOU KNOW THAT GUY THAT YOU KNEW THAT
[1:04:44] USED TO LIVE HERE?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He's dead.
[1:04:59] THAT GUY'S DEAD.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; HE GOT BURIED.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; THE OLD MAN,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; HE'S GONE.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; THIS MIGHT RESEMBLE THE ORIGINAL HOUSE.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ORIGINAL NATURE
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND,
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; HE IS DEAD.
[1:05:24] HE DON'T LIVE HERE IN NO MORE HOME.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE GUY THAT YOU KNEW DID DO THOSE
[1:05:32] THINGS
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THAT INFLUENCE, BUT
[1:05:37] THAT GUY IS GONE FOREVER.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; NOW, WHEN GOD SEEN YOU, HE HE CALLED
[1:05:48] YOU. HE KNEW WHAT AGE THAT YOU WOULD
[1:05:51] COME TO.
[1:05:53] AND HE JUSTIFIED you
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; even before you arrived.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; HE GLORIFIED YOU
[1:06:07] EVEN BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; SO IN GOD'S MIND,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; we are already there.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; WE ARE ALREADY OVERCOMERS.
[1:06:25] I NEED AN EXAMPLE. GOOD. JOB WAS SITTING
[1:06:28] THERE CONCERNED WITH SOME THINGS.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; AND GOD ASKED JOB, "WHERE WAS YOU AT,
[1:06:36] JOB,
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE
[1:06:39] EARTH?"
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SONS OF THE MORNING SHOUTED
[1:06:42] TOGETHER.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE WAS YOU AT?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RHONDA, BUT I'M IN
[1:06:49] SUCH A STRUGGLE." YES,
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE IN SUCH A TRIAL. YES, BUT
[1:06:54] COUNT IT GOLD.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE MOLDING. IT'S THE PROCESS.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; SAY, "Brother Ron, I wish somebody else
[1:07:08] was in the process with me."
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; My wife and I had three children.
[1:07:17] All three children I went to with her to
[1:07:19] the hospital.
[1:07:23] You know, it's amazing thing about men
[1:07:26] when they're having children, they say,
[1:07:27] "WE'RE HAVING A BABY."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; There is no we to this deal.
[1:07:39] She's having a baby.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT SHE GOES
[1:07:48] THROUGH. CAN I JUST Can I just give you
[1:07:51] this?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; She goes to the doctor and the doctor
[1:07:54] looks at her and he says,
[1:07:55] "Congratulations. You're going to have a
[1:07:57] child."
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; She don't hear nothing else.
[1:08:05] We're going to have a baby.
[1:08:08] We're going to have a baby.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Then he proceeds to tell her, "This is
[1:08:16] your first. So, let me give you a little
[1:08:18] warning.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to be kind of uncomfortable
[1:08:22] in this process.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING LOOKS GLORIOUS,
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME DISCOMFORT.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR GIRLISH
[1:08:35] FIGURE.
[1:08:37] Your face is going to puff.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; This is going to puff.
[1:08:44] This is going to puff.
[1:08:46] Your feet are going to swell.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; You're going to be uncomfortable in the
[1:08:51] night. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SLEEP ALL
[1:08:53] NIGHT LONG. THERE'S GOING TO BE CRAVINGS
[1:08:56] THAT YOU WANT. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
[1:08:57] PICKLES AND PEANUT BUTTER. AND YOU'RE
[1:08:59] GOING TO WANT WATERMELON. AND YOU'RE
[1:09:01] GOING TO WANT CANTALOUPE in the middle
[1:09:02] OF THE WINTER. THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMES
[1:09:04] THAT YOU LITERALLY HATE YOUR HUSBAND.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not going through this for not. I
[1:09:11] want you to understand that. Come on.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; AND SHE STARTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
[1:09:17] WELL, IT'S NICE AT FIRST CUZ EVERYBODY
[1:09:20] SAYS, "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE HAVING A
[1:09:22] BABY."
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY PATS YOU ON THE BACK. THE MAN
[1:09:26] STANDS AROUND. WE'RE HAVING A CHILD.
[1:09:32] Everybody pats him at the BACK OF THE
[1:09:34] CHURCH. OH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY
[1:09:36] JOINING the fatherhood club.
[1:09:40] BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH IT.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Only unless HE GETS THAT SYMPATHIZING
[1:09:48] MORNING SICKNESS.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I was not of much help to my wife
[1:09:54] because every time she gagged, I gagged.
[1:10:00] Thank God for two bathrooms.
[1:10:10] WE WOULD WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND SHE'D
[1:10:12] WALK DOWN THE ROAD.
[1:10:22] Thank God we're going to TAKE A COUPLE
[1:10:23] DOGGIES off after this one.
[1:10:27] I'm dead meat.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I didn't LOSE MY FIGURE. I LOST THAT A
[1:10:34] LONG TIME AGO.
[1:10:39] SHE WAS WOBBLING. SHE WAS ALMOST LIKE A
[1:10:42] DUCK FOR A WHILE.
[1:10:44] IT WAS HOT. I MEAN HOT. Air condition in
[1:10:48] the winter time. Hot.
[1:10:51] SHE WAS IN THE PROCESS.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU'RE SITTING IN CHURCH AND
[1:10:55] YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M GOING THROUGH
[1:10:56] THE PROCESS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY AM
[1:10:59] I GOING THROUGH THE TROULES? WHY AM I
[1:11:01] FEELING THESE PAINS? WHY AM I GOING
[1:11:03] THROUGH THIS?" LISTEN, YOU'RE WITH
[1:11:05] CHILD.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO BE IN THE RAPTURE.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO PUT THE DRESS ON,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; THE WEDDING GOWN, BUT THERE'S A PROCESS
[1:11:17] THAT WE'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH. THERE'S A
[1:11:20] MOLDING THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; We went to the hospital.
[1:11:35] You'll like this, brother DDA.
[1:11:39] We went to the hospital
[1:11:42] after 6 hours. I got hungry.
[1:11:51] Their sister sitting all over this
[1:11:53] building right now going, "That's just
[1:11:55] like men.
[1:12:04] I HAD TO LOOK AT THE MONITOR TO TELL HER
[1:12:07] SHE WAS HAVING a contraction.
[1:12:09] THE DOCTOR TOLD ME, SAID, "NOW, YOU CAN
[1:12:11] WARN HER. AS THIS LITTLE BEAK STARTS
[1:12:14] GETTING A CERTAIN WAY, you can go ahead
[1:12:16] and tell her there's a contraction
[1:12:18] coming. Start breathing a certain way."
[1:12:20] And I would TELL HER, I WAS DILIGENT.
[1:12:23] All right, honey. Here comes a
[1:12:24] contraction. Breathe. Breathe. BREATHE.
[1:12:26] BREATHE. BREATHE. AFTER 3 HOURS.
[1:12:33] SHE DON'T NEED A MACHINE
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; TO TELL HER THAT SHE'S HAVING A
[1:12:37] CONTRACTION.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:12:44] SHE'S READY FOR ME TO GO TO Mars
[1:12:50] on a one-way ticket.
[1:12:54] WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY, "IT'LL BE ALL
[1:12:56] RIGHT. YOU'LL SURVIVE IT. THERE'S TIMES
[1:12:58] THAT YOU'D LIKE TO JUST LOOK AT THEM AND
[1:13:00] SAY, "YOU MUST BE FROM MARS SOMEWHERE OR
[1:13:03] ANOTHER."
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR THE SCRIPTURE, "YAY,
[1:13:08] THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE
[1:13:10] SHADOW OF DEATH," AND THAT SCRIPTURE IS
[1:13:12] BECOMING A LIVING REALITY TO YOU, AND
[1:13:15] YOU'RE STANDING THERE WITH EVERY DEMON
[1:13:17] IN HELL AND THE HOST OF HELL. IT SEEMS
[1:13:19] LIKE IT'S AT YOUR BLOCK. IT'S AT YOUR
[1:13:22] CORNER. IT'S ON YOUR STREET. IT'S RIGHT
[1:13:24] THERE AT YOUR HOUSE. IT'S ACTING UP IN
[1:13:26] YOUR CHILDREN. YOU'RE GOING, "THIS IS A
[1:13:29] CONTRACTION.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PART OF THE MOLDING PROCESS."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.
[1:13:38] I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE OTHER
[1:13:40] PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH, BUT NOW IT'S MY
[1:13:42] TURN.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; It's a process.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; It's a process. SO MANY TIMES WE GET
[1:13:50] THIS HOLLYWOOD THING OF THE BRIDE. OH,
[1:13:52] WE BELIEVE A FEW MESSAGES. WE LISTEN TO
[1:13:54] TAPES. WE COME TO CHURCH. WE'RE BRIDE. I
[1:13:57] GOT NEWS FOR YOU. THERE'S A PROCESS.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PROCESS. GOD DON'T JUST SEND
[1:14:03] YOU THROUGH A TUBE AND YOU COME OUT ON
[1:14:05] THE OTHER END,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; BRIDE MATERIAL. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:14:10] GO THROUGH SOME REAL TESTS. THERE'S
[1:14:12] GOING TO BE SOME COLD SOME COLD CLAMMY
[1:14:15] DEVILS GET A HOLD OF YOUR LIFE AND TRY
[1:14:18] TO DESTROY YOU.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; YAY. THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF
[1:14:24] THE SHADOW OF DEATH,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH THEE.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; When your HUSBAND'S NOT THERE TO HOLD
[1:14:32] YOUR HAND, WHEN YOUR WIFE IS NOT THERE
[1:14:34] TO HOLD YOUR HAND, WHEN YOUR DADDY'S NOT
[1:14:36] THERE TO PREACH YOU THE SERMON, WHEN THE
[1:14:38] YOUR UNCLES IS NOT AROUND NOWHERE,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; HE'S WITH YOU.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I want to I want to be the
[1:14:50] bride. He's going to send you through a
[1:14:52] process.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good.
[1:14:55] That's good.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You hear the echoes of Brother Brown
[1:15:00] going through the process.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Life story.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; You hear him GOING THROUGH IT AND WHY
[1:15:08] I'M AGAINST DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Serpent
[1:15:13] seals.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; 10,000 of my friends left me.
[1:15:21] You hear HIM SAY THE ANGEL REBUKED HIM
[1:15:24] FOR CERTAIN THINGS.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR HIM SAY THAT I WAS JUST LIKE AN
[1:15:28] ORPHAN CHILD.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; GOD, you owe me AN APOLOGY.
[1:15:33] AND GOD SENDS HIM THROUGH A PROCESS.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR HIM? AS THE WORD BEGINS TO
[1:15:40] UNFOLD TO THE BRIDE,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; HE BEGINS TO TELL US THAT HE WANTED TO
[1:15:45] BE A TRAPPER.
[1:15:48] EVEN IN 1962, HE'S STILL PLANNING TO BE
[1:15:51] A TRAPPER.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS TO STOP HIM.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES IN OUR PLANS,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; IN OUR AMBITIONS,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT BROTHER RON, WE'RE RIGHT BEFORE
[1:16:01] THE COMING OF THE LORD. LET ME JUST SAY
[1:16:02] THIS TO YOU. YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS
[1:16:04] JUST YET.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME
[1:16:08] PROCESS
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; COMING OUT OF A MEETING LIKE THIS OR
[1:16:12] NEXT WEEK OR TWO YEARS. THERE'S GOING TO
[1:16:14] BE PROCESSES THAT YOU WILL GO THROUGH.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN WILL IT STOP, BROTHER? SECONDS
[1:16:20] BEFORE THE RAPTURE.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR THE LORD?
[1:16:27] HE SAID SATAN KNEW THAT GOD WAS ON HIS
[1:16:30] WAY. AND SO SARAH WAS IN A FUSSY MOOD
[1:16:33] THAT MORNING.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Probably never happens around your
[1:16:42] house.
[1:16:52] That's the best amen laugh I've ever
[1:16:54] heard in my life.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Mrs. lot. The caravans go by her way and
[1:17:14] she gets the best clothes.
[1:17:17] We're up here on THIS DRY LAND. THERE'S
[1:17:20] NOT ENOUGH EVEN UH OF GRASS for even the
[1:17:23] cattle TO HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; DEVIL WAS ANOINTING HER
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; AND IN A FEW HOURS GOD HIMSELF
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; IS GOING TO COME DOWN AND SPEAK LIFT TO
[1:17:35] HIM. AMEN.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU GET READY TO
[1:17:39] WALK INTO THE SERVICE AND GOD HAS SO
[1:17:41] ANOINTED THAT MAN RIGHT THERE AS YOUR
[1:17:44] PASTOR.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO SPEAK LIP TO EAR TO YOU
[1:17:53] AND YOU GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; What is it? Satan's waring with you.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; HE'S WARING WITH YOU. HE'LL CAUSE PEOPLE
[1:18:05] AT WALMART TO BITE YOUR HEAD OFF. HE'LL
[1:18:07] CAUSE YOUR BOSS TO BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.
[1:18:10] HE'LL CAUSE MCDONALD'S TO GIVE YOU A
[1:18:12] HAIR IN YOUR BISCUIT.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; HE'LL CAUSE YOUR TIRES TO GO FLAT.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; HE'LL CAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET YOUR
[1:18:22] MAIL. HE'LL HE'LL SEND A LETTER FROM THE
[1:18:25] IRS. HE'LL DO WHATEVER HE CAN
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; TO DISTRACT YOU.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; OH, Brother Ron, I'd like to speak to a
[1:18:42] mountain. BE THOU REMOVED. GOOD.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO SOME SQUIRRELS.
[1:18:47] GOOD.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO A STORM. OKAY.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; GOOD.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; First things first.
[1:18:58] Place Bible under arm.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Get keys out of pocket.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; TAKE FAMILY TO CHURCH.
[1:19:29] FORGIVE ME. WELL, BROTHER RON, BROTHER
[1:19:32] BRANDON'S MY PASTOR.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I met a fellow like that well, not
[1:19:41] long ago, and he told me that Brother
[1:19:42] Brand was his pastor.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; So, I looked over and you know, I
[1:19:45] thought, well, you know, I don't have a
[1:19:46] long time to preach.
[1:19:48] I just simply looked at him and said,
[1:19:50] "When's the LAST TIME YOU LISTENED TO
[1:19:51] JEZEBEL RELIGION?"
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's been a while." I said,
[1:19:55] "Need to." He said, "Why?" I said, "I'm
[1:19:57] looking at your wife."
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE COME TO CHURCH AND WE DON'T
[1:20:05] HEAR WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going home in a few hours.
[1:20:19] Brother Ed will get all this mess
[1:20:20] straightened out.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; May shoot me, throw me in the river.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; But I want YOU TO KNOW GOD ORDAINS THAT
[1:20:29] MAN.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO LIKE WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT.
[1:20:33] I'LL BE PREACHING AWAY AND ALL THE
[1:20:35] SUDDEN JUST TURN ME COMPLETELY FOR WHERE
[1:20:39] I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED IN MY OWN
[1:20:40] MIND. HE WILL TURN ME, STOP THE WHOLE
[1:20:44] SERVICE IN MY MIND AND START SPEAKING TO
[1:20:46] YOU
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS CHILDREN AND YOU
[1:20:52] HAVE NEEDS.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I LOVE TO LISTEN TO TAPES, BUT I
[1:21:00] DO IT WHEN I'M NOT AT CHURCH.
[1:21:06] MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,
[1:21:07] FRIDAY, SATURDAY. AND I GO AND SOMETIMES
[1:21:10] I GET IT BETWEEN SERVICES.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; CUZ THE MORE I FEED MY SOUL,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; the stronger I am.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham met an Indian AND HAD
[1:21:21] TWO DOGS FIGHTING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM
[1:21:23] AND HE SAID, "WHICH ONE IS A WINNER?" HE
[1:21:25] SAID, "THE ONE THAT I FEED THE MOST."
[1:21:28] THE REASON SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH A
[1:21:30] BATTLE WITH THEIR PROCESS IS THEY'RE NOT
[1:21:33] FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF
[1:21:35] MAN.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I WANT THE WORD TO SKIN ME ONCE
[1:21:43] IN A WHILE.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; THE RE SAID WHAT BRANDON TABERNACLE
[1:21:46] NEEDS IS A KILLING. HE SAID WHAT WILLIAM
[1:21:49] BRANDON NEEDS IS A KILLING.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER.
[1:21:58] Preach me something that'll make me
[1:22:01] happy.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That didn't make me happy today.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, that hurt.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That hurt.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That contraction hurts.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S THE CLOSEST
[1:22:19] THAT WOMAN WILL EVER COME TO DEATH
[1:22:21] WITHOUT DYING,
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; GIVING BIRTH TO THAT CHILD.
[1:22:25] SHE WILL ALMOST GIVE HER LIFE TO GIVE
[1:22:27] BIRTH. THOSE CONTRACTIONS, THERE'S
[1:22:29] NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT. IT HURTS.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; It's painful.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That ministry, what it does is it comes
[1:22:40] down like a like a sword, piercing even
[1:22:44] the dividing of the false suns
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; even to the soul. tomorrow comes right
[1:22:50] down in pricks into our hearts
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; and we go, "That's me.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; I needed that."
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; God will bring a man 4,000 miles away
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; that can't preach his way out of a
[1:23:10] bucket
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; to speak to you.
[1:23:18] Come on, church.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; It's a part of the process.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; In that process, there's going to come a
[1:23:27] coordination day, though.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You see a man getting ready for the
[1:23:33] Olympics, Paul talks about the Olympics,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; talks about running, winning a prize.
[1:23:42] THAT OLYMPIC ATHLETE, HE GETS UP AT 4:00
[1:23:44] IN THE MORNING, MAYBE EARLIER, AND HE
[1:23:46] TRAINS ALL OF HIS life
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; for a few seconds.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; JUST A FEW SECONDS TO SHOW WHAT GOD HAS
[1:23:53] DID FOR HIM. GIVE THAT GIFT IN HIS LIFE.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He just works and he WORKS AND HE TUNES
[1:24:00] HIS BODY AND HE TUNES HIS BODY AND HE
[1:24:01] TUNES HIS BODY TO GET READY TO USE THAT
[1:24:04] GIFT.
[1:24:06] WHATEVER IT WAS
[1:24:08] GIVES HIM. HE GOES AND DOES THAT, BUT
[1:24:11] THAT DOESN'T FULFILL IT.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT STAND THERE ON THE STAND AND
[1:24:15] EVERYBODY SAYS, "OH, I'D LIKE TO be like
[1:24:17] that."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, one of these days there's going
[1:24:20] to be angels stand.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; There's going TO BE A GROUP OF PEOPLE
[1:24:28] THAT GOD HAS SENT THROUGH THE process
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; that he wrote a covenant with.
[1:24:34] I'LL BE WITH YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN
[1:24:40] YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE THE DARKEST OF THE NIGHT,
[1:24:45] BUT I'LL BE WITH YOU.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; THE PAIN MAY BE SO GREAT. THAT BIRTH
[1:24:50] PAIN MAY BE SO HORRIBLE,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take his bride.
[1:25:04] to be ever by his side.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; All the host of heaven
[1:25:13] will assemble be.
[1:25:16] Oh, it will be a glorious sight.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; All the saints and spotless wife.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And with Jesus,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; we're going to spend
[1:25:32] Eternity.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Come and die.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; The master's calling
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; come and die.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; We've been through the process.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; We fed and WE FED AND WE BATTLED AND
[1:25:54] WE'VE BATTLED.
[1:25:59] REWARD
[1:26:02] ONE MORNING.
[1:26:04] I'M GOING TO TAKE A step
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm GOING TO TAKE A step
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; into my theophony.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; They're going to take a half a step this
[1:26:18] way
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take a HALF A STEP THAT
[1:26:21] WAY.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:26] OH, BROTHER RON, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
[1:26:28] YOU'RE STILL THE SAME. BUT I WANT YOU TO
[1:26:30] KNOW THERE'S A PROCESS CALLED THE
[1:26:32] RAPTURE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON DOWN IN
[1:26:35] HERE FOR A LONG TIME.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN MOLDING AND REFLECTING HIMSELF
[1:26:42] DOWN INSIDE OF HERE.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; One morning, he's going to call us.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] Time to come home, bro.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to hear not the footprints
[1:26:59] of Philistine horses,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; but we're going to hear a buck board
[1:27:06] wagon
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; come over a hillside.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Then all THE COUSINS CAN LAUGH ALL THEY
[1:27:14] WANT.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Can
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; because the dress fits.
[1:27:28] It fits exactly right.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; You know, in a marriage that man can
[1:27:33] have the best tuxedo in the world on
[1:27:37] nobody pays no attention.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; He can HAVE ALL THE BELLS AND THE
[1:27:46] WHISTLES AND THE STRAPS, HAVE HIS HAIR
[1:27:48] ALL GOOED UP.
[1:27:51] NOBODY PAYS NO ATTENTION.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THAT DOOR OPENS UP,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; every eye,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; EVERY EYE IN THE WHOLE BUILDING GOES,
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; it fits.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; She's here.
[1:28:23] Every eye in the universe
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; every eye in the universe
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; IS WATCHING THE bride
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; oh soon the lamb will take his
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; bride
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; to be ever at his side
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; all the hostal
[1:28:51] ALL THE HOST OF heaven
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; will assemble me.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; We'll say goodbye in a few minutes, BUT
[1:28:59] AFTER A WHILE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY
[1:29:00] GOODBYE NO MORE.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; OH, IT WILL BE A GLORIOUS NIGHT.
[1:29:10] ALL OF YOU INSPIRE US.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And with Jesus,
[1:29:19] we're going to spend
[1:29:21] eternity.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, come and die. The master is calling.
[1:29:29] Come and die.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You may face that Jesus. Let's stand.
[1:29:51] Come and
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; oh soon the lamb take his bride. I'm
[1:29:59] going to be ever at his side.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Oh it will be a glorious sight.
[1:30:13] All the saints spotless.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, come and the master is calling.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You may face that Jesus table.
[1:30:37] He who fed the multitude
[1:30:40] turns the water into wine to the hungry
[1:30:46] cord. Now come and die.
[1:30:50] Sing it for you. Soon the lamb is going
[1:30:53] to take his bride to be ever.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart.
[1:31:05] or to be a glorious sign. All the saints
[1:31:10] follow
[1:31:12] and with Jesus.
[1:31:18] Oh, come and die.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; He who fed the multitude,
[1:31:35] turn the water into wine. To the hungry,
[1:31:40] call it now. Come and die.
[1:31:45] Oh, come and die.
[1:31:50] Let me hear it. You may be at Jesus
[1:31:55] table all the time.
[1:31:59] He who
[1:32:02] turn
[1:32:04] into wine.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] It's been a wonderful time we've had
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; and it's just we're just in the process.
[1:32:26] You know, two years ago at camp,
[1:32:30] uh, we had an unusual camp that two
[1:32:33] years ago. And it was largely because
[1:32:36] there were so many of you that are
[1:32:38] seniors now, two years younger,
[1:32:41] two or three years younger, but some
[1:32:43] were 14 and 15.
[1:32:47] And we had a we had a very, very young
[1:32:51] senior camp. Right.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Tom and I discussed it and
[1:32:54] spoke about it and said, you know, we've
[1:32:57] never had a camp quite like this. It
[1:32:59] just they're so young. We don't hardly
[1:33:01] know how to handle uh such a young
[1:33:04] group. Generally, we've had, you know,
[1:33:05] seniors that are 17, 18, 19 like that.
[1:33:09] And uh we we I think reacted better. We
[1:33:14] uh we were more prepared for that kind
[1:33:16] of a camp. And then
[1:33:19] this camp been very very different. Very
[1:33:22] different because we had a lot of, you
[1:33:26] know, what we'd say kind of teeny
[1:33:28] boppers at that time. And they hadn't
[1:33:30] quite found their teenage legs yet. And
[1:33:32] they had, you know, uh, all kinds of
[1:33:35] problems just, you know, kind of trying
[1:33:38] to find their, you know, their place
[1:33:41] and, uh, you know, kind of find their
[1:33:43] space sort of thing. and we had to kind
[1:33:45] of go along with that. This year, uh, it
[1:33:49] was a distinct difference. There was,
[1:33:51] you know, more settled.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Some of those that had all kinds of
[1:33:55] difficulties back then, two years ago,
[1:33:57] they're through it now.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; They want to get on with God.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Back then, they didn't know whether, you
[1:34:04] know, what they wanted to do, just
[1:34:06] listen to a bunch of music or do this or
[1:34:08] be with my friends. My friends, I heard
[1:34:10] that so I'm just sick. My friends, who
[1:34:13] in the worlds are your friends? Your
[1:34:15] friends are real men and women, real
[1:34:18] sons and daughters of God. My friends,
[1:34:21] some of them already on the other side.
[1:34:24] And all my friends, all that I consider
[1:34:27] my friends are going to be on the other
[1:34:29] side. They're going to be robed in
[1:34:30] spotless white. That's my friends.
[1:34:33] That's my friends.
[1:34:37] I feel serious about that. And so this
[1:34:40] year it has been uh different because I
[1:34:44] want to say to you that are campers
[1:34:47] uh you you've come a distance now in a
[1:34:50] couple two three years and our brother
[1:34:54] Spencer preaching today was allowing you
[1:34:57] to know that maybe tomorrow morning or
[1:35:02] on down the road you'll be in the
[1:35:04] process. You're still in the process.
[1:35:07] But there comes a time and I believe for
[1:35:10] many of you that this is the time that
[1:35:15] uh all the frivolous things
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; leave,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; they depart. And if it hasn't happened
[1:35:23] yet, it needs to.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; The sooner you young men and young women
[1:35:28] realize that life is full of serious
[1:35:31] things because you're going to run into
[1:35:33] you're going to run into times this
[1:35:36] process. It's not just for a select few.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; We'll all have it. You'll all have an
[1:35:41] experience. You'll all have tough times.
[1:35:44] You'll have times. Why don't you just
[1:35:46] sit down for a few moments? I'm not
[1:35:49] going to preach, but I want to we want
[1:35:51] to close the camp. You all I want
[1:35:55] especially all the campers, you all are
[1:35:57] going to have a time. Let me say
[1:35:58] something. There isn't one young man or
[1:36:01] one young woman sitting here listening
[1:36:04] to brother Biscll at this moment. But
[1:36:06] what you are going to arrive at a day if
[1:36:10] you don't make a serious commitment to
[1:36:12] God, you're going to arrive at a day
[1:36:15] that you're going to regret
[1:36:18] regret it deeply. And when you get down
[1:36:21] into your deepest pit of despair, and
[1:36:24] you find everything going sideways,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; maybe it'll be some catastrophic thing,
[1:36:31] some trauma of some sort, maybe it's
[1:36:33] something physical, maybe an accident.
[1:36:35] Let me tell you something. If you have
[1:36:36] an accident, I want to make it serious.
[1:36:38] If you have an accident, you're not
[1:36:41] going to call some of these that you've
[1:36:42] called your friends
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; that you're not going to call the guy
[1:36:46] that handed you uh a cigarette. YOU'RE
[1:36:49] NOT GOING TO CALL THE guy who's hand you
[1:36:52] a can of beer.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; You're not going to call them.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "WHERE'S BROTHER
[1:36:57] TOM? WHERE'S BROTHER ED?
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S MY GODLY FATHER AND MY MOTHER?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I WANT THEM." RIGHT?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A coward and call them then.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; DO IT NOW.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; MAKE YOUR DECISION NOW.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[1:37:12] SAY, "OH, DEVIL, HELP ME."
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "GOD, HELP ME."
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; And you WANT TO BE ON GOOD SPEAKING
[1:37:22] TERMS. I'm telling you from my OWN LIFE.
[1:37:24] I HAVE PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST
[1:37:26] PLAY AROUND WITH GOD,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; but then when they get into a real
[1:37:31] difficult time, THEY WANT TO CALL
[1:37:34] SOMEBODY WHO THEY KNOW knows how to
[1:37:36] pray.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; When Brother Ron told me about falling
[1:37:40] onto that concrete driveway and breaking
[1:37:43] his entire back and crushing four of his
[1:37:47] vertebraes. He told me that personally
[1:37:50] and he was going THROUGH HIS PROCESS.
[1:37:53] WHO WOULD EXPECT
[1:37:55] THAT GOD WOULD TAKE a brother that could
[1:37:57] come here and you WOULD SO ENJOY?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; WHO WOULD EXPECT THAT GOD WOULD ALLOW
[1:38:02] HIM TO go through that? And maybe his
[1:38:05] daddy AND HIS MOM WOULD SAY, "WHAT'S
[1:38:07] HAPPENING NOW? WE WE PLAYED THE TAPE. WE
[1:38:10] BELIEVED THE MESSAGE. WE DID EVERYTHING
[1:38:12] WE KNOW HOW." AND WE GOT A SON LAYING IN
[1:38:14] THE IN THE TRAUMA IN THE ICU WITH A BACK
[1:38:19] ALL BROKEN AND CRUSHED AND A DOCTOR
[1:38:21] TELLING US HE'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But he told me of his dad walking in. I
[1:38:27] know I know his daddy since 1978.
[1:38:32] And that brother Spencer, how I love
[1:38:35] him. He walked in, looked at that son
[1:38:38] with all those bones broken, said, "I'm
[1:38:41] a son of God."
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of personal
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; you're going to need. Then
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; if you young people got godly parents,
[1:38:52] YOU THANK GOD for them
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and make a serious commitment. If you
[1:38:58] haven't come to that, let's not have it
[1:39:00] frivolous because
[1:39:02] your life your life's going on two years
[1:39:05] from now. Things are going to change.
[1:39:07] You're going to go through some process
[1:39:09] in the next two years, next year and
[1:39:12] maybe next week. And I've always said, I
[1:39:15] want to be on good speaking terms. I
[1:39:18] don't want to call God. I don't want to
[1:39:20] call on them just in my hour of need.
[1:39:22] And you will have it.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You will have it. one way or another,
[1:39:26] you will have it. And so, we want to
[1:39:29] leave the camp joyfully, but also
[1:39:32] seriously because I want you to be
[1:39:35] victorious, NOT ONLY IN A CAMP
[1:39:37] ATMOSPHERE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL ALONE
[1:39:40] AND YOU HAVE NOBODY BESIDE YOU. WANT YOU
[1:39:43] TO BE ABLE TO LOOK HEAVEN STRAIGHT IN
[1:39:46] THE FACE, SAY, "GOD, I DROVE MY STAKE
[1:39:49] DOWN at the camp." And I believe there's
[1:39:51] been quite a few stakes driven down.
[1:39:53] I've seen you praying here. I've seen
[1:39:55] God do some real real
[1:40:00] not only serious but some deep things.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say also there's a few
[1:40:05] things I just want to say. Young people
[1:40:08] especially,
[1:40:10] let me tell you honestly, don't let the
[1:40:13] devil deceive you to think that the
[1:40:16] preacher's different than you are. He
[1:40:19] fights the same devils and probably more
[1:40:22] of them, the same temptations. And when
[1:40:25] they and when brother Ron Spencer tell
[1:40:27] you about his life or brother Tom shared
[1:40:30] with some of you young men about his
[1:40:32] life and I have told some of mine, don't
[1:40:35] ever think that the preachers different
[1:40:37] than you are. WE FOUGHT THE SAME
[1:40:39] BATTLES,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; WENT THROUGH THE SAME TRIALS, HAVE GONE
[1:40:43] THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS. That's right.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron related and said just a
[1:40:49] little bit about brother Brandham's
[1:40:52] in 1962.
[1:40:56] He doesn't know this, but I was with
[1:40:58] brother Brandham right at that time
[1:41:02] when brother Brandham,
[1:41:05] this might surprise you, when he wanted
[1:41:07] to quit preaching.
[1:41:11] And I we talked about the very place
[1:41:14] that he wanted to buy. He wanted to buy
[1:41:17] a place up on the Alaskan Highway. He
[1:41:20] told me how much money he had. He wanted
[1:41:24] to buy that and he said, "I'll just come
[1:41:26] here. I'll just bury myself." Do you
[1:41:28] know why? Do you know why? He said, "The
[1:41:31] people aren't they're not listening.
[1:41:34] They want to make something out of him
[1:41:35] that he said it's not true." And he and
[1:41:38] he he wanted to quit. He wanted to quit
[1:41:40] preaching because the people don't
[1:41:41] listen.
[1:41:45] That was his process.
[1:41:50] And next year I saw him. He said, "I
[1:41:52] believe it's all fixed now. I I believe
[1:41:54] it's all fixed. If you want to read a
[1:41:55] message, read Bruce Serpent
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; and you see what he went what he went
[1:42:00] through.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why did he have to go through
[1:42:02] it?" Well, it was part of the process. I
[1:42:05] don't know. And we're in part of the
[1:42:07] process. And so, we just thank God. He
[1:42:10] will not give us anything more than you
[1:42:13] are able to bear.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through this like a
[1:42:17] coward.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through it like a
[1:42:20] coward. And even I I spoke with the
[1:42:23] brothers who stood by brother Brandham's
[1:42:25] bed when he was leaving this life.
[1:42:28] And even then while he couldn't speak,
[1:42:31] but he was a man and he kn his head and
[1:42:35] wink his eye and he was he was still you
[1:42:38] could see that fervor that fight that
[1:42:41] warrior that soldier was still in him.
[1:42:43] That's the way we want to be. That's the
[1:42:46] kind of people that's going to walk in
[1:42:48] white.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:51] And so when you young people leave here,
[1:42:55] I want to say to you, if you're here
[1:42:58] next year, that you have made a resolve.
[1:43:04] You've made a resolve that whatever
[1:43:05] happens. I wonder if you can say that to
[1:43:08] yourself. Whatever happens, I've said it
[1:43:11] with God
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and I'm going through.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going through, Jesus. I'm going
[1:43:16] through. There isn't anything that can
[1:43:18] turn me from it.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and sing.
[1:43:31] How many believe they'll be here next
[1:43:33] year?
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't very many. If that's
[1:43:37] all that's coming, we won't have a camp.
[1:43:40] How many would like to be here next
[1:43:42] year?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Good. Still not 100%.
[1:43:47] How many would like to see our brother
[1:43:48] Ron here next year?
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I've never done that. I've
[1:44:12] never pulled that on a preacher. Never
[1:44:14] can.
[1:44:16] He did it on me.
[1:44:18] I got to be in his church in two weeks.
[1:44:21] You know that? He did it on me last
[1:44:23] year. He said, "How many like TO HAVE
[1:44:25] BROTHER BISCLL HERE NEXT YEAR?" OH,
[1:44:27] there it was. It was all done. Obligated
[1:44:30] me. Brother
[1:44:47] I'd like to ask and I I don't know.
[1:44:49] That's why I'm asking. I said, "This
[1:44:50] isn't a show. I'm just asking." Brother
[1:44:52] Ron, what are you doing next August?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:08] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:10] Now you have something to pray for in
[1:45:12] the next 12 months. Oh God, THE CAMP
[1:45:16] NEXT YEAR. OH GOD, THERE'LL BE A
[1:45:19] REVIVAL. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVEN'T even
[1:45:21] begun to experience everything that God
[1:45:23] would love to do. He can sweep through
[1:45:25] here. I tell you a couple of things. Do
[1:45:27] you know that a couple of brothers saw a
[1:45:30] strange cloud hanging over this tent? Do
[1:45:33] you know that the very next day and they
[1:45:35] said the cloud was like the one in the
[1:45:38] picture? Do you know that the next day a
[1:45:40] sister who knew nothing about it came to
[1:45:43] me and came to my wife afterwards, she's
[1:45:45] sitting here now and she was trembling.
[1:45:47] She was trembling. She said there was
[1:45:49] not a cloud in the sky. This is the next
[1:45:51] day from this distance, this distance,
[1:45:54] not one cloud in the sky. And she said,
[1:45:58] for no less than five minutes, I saw a
[1:46:00] cloud. I saw it in the sky. And she
[1:46:03] said, HAD THE SAME SHAPE AND IT WAS
[1:46:05] hanging right over this tent.
[1:46:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:11] AMEN. He's the same God.
[1:46:15] The same God.
[1:46:17] Talk to the woman of the west.
[1:46:21] Here it is. It's just her testimony.
[1:46:25] Same God.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well. He's the same
[1:46:34] God.
[1:46:36] Too many to tell
[1:46:41] God
[1:46:45] raing red sea
[1:46:50] and he's the same God who is dwelling in
[1:46:54] me. I lift it up once again. Oh, he's
[1:46:58] the same God
[1:47:00] spoke to
[1:47:04] the well.
[1:47:06] He's the same God.
[1:47:10] Too many to tell.
[1:47:13] The same God,
[1:47:17] the raging red sea.
[1:47:22] Oh, he's the same God that live.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I think we've heard the admonition
[1:47:40] charge.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a time of retreat.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in retreats.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You don't believe in retreats.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of charge. And I want to
[1:47:53] say God bless you all once again for all
[1:47:56] that you've done for this camp. You know
[1:47:59] this is a collective body.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody will shake your hand say God
[1:48:03] bless you brother Tom brother Biscoff
[1:48:05] for all that you've done. You know my
[1:48:07] quick answer is without all the help
[1:48:11] camp would never happen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Never happen. It's a collective affair.
[1:48:16] The Bible says in Ephesians 4 that the
[1:48:19] whole body fitly joins together,
[1:48:22] compacted by which every joint supply
[1:48:26] according to the effectual working of
[1:48:29] the measure of every part.

[1:49:21] THE BODY.
[1:49:25] It doesn't stop there. It goes to the
[1:49:28] kitchen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU'VE HAD THE NATURAL FOOD.
[1:49:35] YOU'VE HAD THE SPIRITUAL FOOD. WHAT? FOR
[1:49:37] THE EFFECTUAL WORKING OF THE BODY.

[1:50:30] GROUND.

[1:51:09] TOGETHER.
[1:51:12] WE GOT A PASTOR WITH A VISION.
[1:51:21] I WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THIS LAST
[1:51:23] STATEMENT. The young people got together
[1:51:26] last night to give us an album, the
[1:51:28] ministry, and Sister Crane and and the
[1:51:30] and Sister Karen and we're Jess and
[1:51:32] Lynn. They gave us and and they and you
[1:51:34] know, they put their money together.

[1:51:37] it together. Uh brother I was going to
[1:51:39] say little brother Jesse. Where's little

[1:51:45] big brother Jesse stands up and and and
[1:51:48] gives that to us
[1:51:50] and he collected now the hours that I
[1:51:52] just gave you of the different people to
[1:51:54] put on this camp

[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; that is every joint
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; that's every joint
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; and that's not including those that have
[1:52:07] prayed got on their knees got in their

[1:52:21] MIGHT NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU, BUT I
[1:52:23] KNOW THERE'S ONE THAT'S HERE. HE'LL
[1:52:24] RECOGNIZE YOU. AND ON THAT DAY, ON THAT
[1:52:27] DAY, HE WILL POUR BACK ABUNDANTLY WITHIN
[1:52:30] YOUR LIFE.
[1:52:34] You say, "Brother Tom, why are you so
[1:52:35] enthused?" I'M ENTHUSED BECAUSE I SAW
[1:52:38] DEMONS
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; LOOSE.
[1:52:42] I SAW YOUNG PEOPLE DELIVERED.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT DOESN'T THRILL YOUR HEART,
[1:52:46] YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And let me make a statement quotable.
[1:53:02] Brother Biscll said years ago, a man of
[1:53:05] God doesn't stand behind his pulpit
[1:53:08] and just put some quotes together. What
[1:53:11] you see is a a collection of many, many
[1:53:15] years of process
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; to stand here and minister the way he
[1:53:23] ministered.
[1:53:25] And I want to thank the Lord Jesus
[1:53:26] Christ for the molding process within
[1:53:28] our dear brother Ron Spencer's life that
[1:53:30] he could pour out his life and his
[1:53:33] energies
[1:53:35] for this body
[1:53:37] that joint supplying to this body. Do
[1:53:40] you see the increase within your life? I
[1:53:42] SAY TO GOD BE THE GLORY. LET THE
[1:53:45] HALLELUJAH
[1:53:46] ROLL. I'M LIVING. AS WE GET READY TO GO,
[1:53:50] LET'S SAY I'M LIVING ON THE HALLELUJAH
[1:53:52] SIDE. OH, GLORY BE TO JESUS. Can we sing
[1:53:55] that just before we we're WHO WANTS TO
[1:53:57] GO? I DON'T WANT TO GO.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO GO. BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; there's another day
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; and we won't have one another. But you
[1:54:08] got to prove it's this is the hour.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, even in you to the end
[1:54:15] of the world.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus. Let the hand
[1:54:26] for a while.
[1:54:32] Oh, make that your confession. And I'm
[1:54:35] living on the hallelujah.
[1:54:41] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let my
[1:54:45] hallelujah.
[1:54:47] Let me sing
[1:54:59] and I'm living. Let's sing that one more
[1:55:01] time for the glory of God. Oh, glory.
[1:55:05] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[1:55:08] hallelujah.
[1:55:11] Let me see
[1:55:14] all
[1:55:17] my
[1:55:22] soul and I'm living on the hallelujah
[1:55:26] side.
[1:55:29] Let's give him a praise offering.
[1:55:32] Amen. Let's give him his LAST
[1:55:35] PRAISE OFFERING THIS MORNING. THANK HIM
[1:55:37] FOR WHAT HE'S DONE IN your life today.
[1:55:40] SAY, "WHAT A TREMENDOUS WEEK IT'S BEEN."
[1:55:42] AMEN. MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING. THE
[1:55:46] GLORY OF GOD HAS ROLLED THROUGH THIS
[1:55:48] CAMP. MAY IT CONTINUE TO GO WITH YOU.
[1:55:53] Heavenly Father, at the close of this
[1:55:55] camp, we give you glory.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, we do not lift up any man. We lift
[1:55:59] up the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; TO GOD BE THE GLORY. GREAT THINGS HE'S
[1:56:03] DONE. WE GIVE YOU PRAISE, LORD, BECAUSE
[1:56:06] WE KNOW IT'S THE WORD THAT'S PRODUCING A
[1:56:09] WORD BRIDE. We pray, GOD, THAT YOU WILL
[1:56:12] BLESS OUR DEAR BROTHER RON. BLESS HIS
[1:56:14] DEAR WIFE. BLESS HIS HOME. BLESS HIS
[1:56:17] CHURCH. BLESS THAT LITTLE BODY OF CHRIST
[1:56:19] THERE. LORD, AS WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED
[1:56:21] this week, we thank you for one another.
[1:56:24] We thank you for faithful sisters, a
[1:56:26] faithful brethren. We thank you for this
[1:56:28] facility that you open the door for us.
[1:56:31] We pray God that we can look back Lord
[1:56:33] maybe last night, this morning, night
[1:56:36] before, the night before and SAY THAT
[1:56:38] NIGHT IT WAS AT THAT TIME.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS SAY LORD FROM THAT TIME THE
[1:56:43] BAD THINGS. BUT TODAY WE WANT TO SAY
[1:56:45] FROM THAT TIME
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; FROM THAT TIME
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; I LIVE VICTORIOUSLY I LIVE IN VICTORY.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; May we go
[1:56:58] with such a thankfulness within our
[1:56:59] hearts. This is a been a blessed time,
[1:57:02] refreshing time. Lord, we didn't even
[1:57:05] want this to stop. We just want to move
[1:57:08] into that next dimension. Lord, that we
[1:57:11] can sit at your feet, lift up our hands,
[1:57:13] AND PRAISE YOU THROUGH ALL ETERNITY.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; It's what we're living for, Lord. We
[1:57:19] believe we're in that rapture cycle. We
[1:57:21] believe, Lord God, that you have
[1:57:23] becoming and are becoming so real. So,
[1:57:25] Lord, with those that will be traveling
[1:57:27] on the road, watch over them, Lord. And
[1:57:29] Lord, when we return on Sunday, may
[1:57:32] there be victory in the camp.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; May this just roll over, Lord. And as
[1:57:36] we've been having camp meeting after
[1:57:38] camp meeting before we got here, WHEN WE
[1:57:40] GET BACK TO THE HOME CHURCH, IT WAS JUST
[1:57:42] A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE'VE HAD HERE.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And we will give you the glory. We will
[1:57:48] give you the honor. And we will give you
[1:57:50] the praise, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:57:55] God bless you. Shake one another's hand.
[1:57:58] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Till till we meet again.
[1:58:07] Till
[1:58:09] me.
[1:58:13] Till we meet.
[1:58:42] is glory.
[1:59:14] as we go our way. You know what would
[1:59:17] really help us? really help us. Now, you
[1:59:19] just pick up your chair and you take it
[1:59:22] right to this corner right over here.
[1:59:23] The brothers will be there to show you
[1:59:24] where to put it. Can you imagine if
[1:59:26] everybody picked up their chair? It'd
[1:59:28] hardly take any more time. So, as you're
[1:59:31] leaving, dismissing, just take it that
[1:59:34] corner and that'd help us out a lot. God
[1:59:36] bless you. God bless you, Richie.
[2:01:50] Oh,
[2:02:00] the
[2:02:04] Heat.
[2:02:16] Heat.
[2:02:56] Heat. Heat.
[2:03:23] Heat. Heat.
[2:04:36] Heat. Heat.
[2:04:42] Heat. Heat.
[2:05:08] Oh,
[2:05:33] hey.
[2:05:54] Oh,
[2:06:03] heat.
