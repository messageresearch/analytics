You know, we've we we see prophecy being fulfilled and it's just it's getting closer and closer and closer. Amen. Tell you what, I'm excited. I'm excited. Amen.

I'm ready for deliverance. Lord, I've never been this whole sick before [Music] and the church of God is growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. My goodness. Boys, boys, boys. Looks like that's some of our lots in life. Little pink things don't seem to be our lot. This morning we have a baby dedication of Aaron Michael words. So just another soldier to this great army of the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We read often certain scriptures maybe making reference um to the names of the children. This morning I'm reading a scripture that the Bible says this in Matthew 19 and 13:14 and 15. Says, "When then they were brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them, pray and the disciples rebuked them." But Jesus said, "Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for such is the kingdom of heaven." &gt;&gt; And he laid the hands on them, &gt;&gt; and they thus departed. Well, I'm just so thankful that we have parents that are able to look to the word of God and say, "Bible times are here again. I want my children blessed. I want my children dedicated. We do not have water baptism for our babies because we don't see them in the word. But we see where they took their children, took them to the Lord. And we believe in baby dedication. We believe in in families. We believe in fatherhood. We believe in motherhood. And standing here, I believe, is is uh a real handmaiden of God, Sister Stephanie. this little baby that you've called Aaron, Michael, to be a mountain of strength and a gift from God. Brother Brandon made special mention of Aaron of Old's mother, Joseette, and said she was a real woman of faith. And she had faith enough to take Moses, which was a gift from God, and put him in the jaws of death. He said, speaking about faith, faith doesn't move. No matter how contrary it looks, faith stays right there. It never moves. When Moses was put in the bull rush and that slimy ark pushed out into the sea of crocodiles that were fed with children, that mother joel with faith and assurance she put that child in the water and pushed him in the jaws of death, &gt;&gt; knowing God would raise him up. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the faith of this mother [Music] &gt;&gt; be rewarded &gt;&gt; in this age that we live in. &gt;&gt; She's taking the word of God and she's claiming it. Oh, he says that makes me feel religious. She knew God would take care of him. &gt;&gt; May God take care of this little Aaron Michael for the glory of God. May he be a mountain of strength &gt;&gt; as we believe that he is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said that little baby was the sweetest little thing. When brother Brandham took that little baby, he always made mention of their hair. He said look at their hair is just like mine. They hardly have any. And they said, "Isn't he the sweetest little thing?" I say he's a sweet little joy. Amen. God bless you. God bless you, sweetheart. Amen. May God make this man a little man a mountain of strength for the glory of God. Let's pray. Father, with great joy, we take that commission, Lord, that we would suffer the little children to come. this little baby dedication. Lord, you've blessed this home with many children. You've given them four boys now. And Father, cradle in my arm as Aaron Michael. I'm praying, God, that your hand will ever rest on him, Lord, that you'll ever protect him and guide him. And may the same faith of a mother well up within the heart of this son, Lord, as a mother and a daddy would try and desire to raise them up in the admonition of God. teach them in the ways of God and when they grow older they shall not depart. May this child have a love for you at a young age and may father God you ever keep your hand of blessing upon Aaron this morning as we dedicate him back to you for the glory of God. Bless his life. Make Lord Jo Jesus his heart be a joy to his home. And father God we ask your blessing now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you Aaron Michael. God bless you. Bless you. Bless your voice. Amen. And our Jonathan Walner has a has a special for us. Come and get ready at this time. We'll sing Born Again. There's really been a change in me. Born again. There's really been a change in me. Oh, born again. Just like Jesus said. Oh yeah. Because of Calary I [Music] for changing me. Oh, born again just like Jesus said. And born again all because of Calary. I'm glad, so glad that I've been born again. It's just so wonderful to be here this morning. I just can't imagine where I'd be if the Lord had not come by my way. It's just so wonderful to be part of God's chosen people this morning, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Behold, I send my angel to keep you in the way. If you just obey my voice and do all I say, I'll cut off all your enemies and bring you to your land. Keep my word before you and I'll keep you in my hand. [Music] My chosen people, I will never lose you. [Music] I promise to be with you till the end. my chosen people. I will never forsake you. I have only loved you [Music] for you are my own. [Music] Before [Music] you cross into the land that I have given you, many struggles you will face, but I will see you through. Keep on pressing forward. Never look behind. Heed the voice I send to you. For he will have my side. My chosen people. I will never lose you. I promise to be with you till the end. My chosen people. I will never forsake you. [Music] I have only loved you for you are my own. My chosen people. I will never lose you. I promise to be with you till the end. and my chosen people. I will never forsake you. I have only loved you. For you are my own, my chosen people. I will never lose you. I promise to be with you [Music] till the end. My chosen people, I will never forsake you. [Music] I have only loved you. For you are my own. [Music] Thank you, Jonathan. And I have uh Just one announcement that I forgot to to make mention from brother Jack Giri. He just wants to thank the brothers and sisters who helped at the camp yesterday. Uh they're also looking for about 25 other brothers and sisters for uh next Friday and Saturday, which is May 2nd and the 3rd, to help at the camp. If you would uh give Brother Jack a call at the camp office, and just let them know that you'll be able to help, that'd be great. And also forgot to make mention that we have uh visiting from South Africa uh Sister Susan Merittz. May we get you to stand sister Susan. So we make Where are you there? God bless you. Good to have you. God bless you. Amen. As brother Ed comes, let's sing uh give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks. Give thanks with the grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ. Give thanks [Applause] [Music] to the holy one because he's given Jesus Christ. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks. Amen. Just need a little power. We need more than electrical power. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost power. Well, I glad to report that we have Holy Ghost power, &gt;&gt; evidence of it. &gt;&gt; We're going to be doing some rejoicing and singing and which we've already done some, but I uh there's a few comments that I want to make and some announcements we need to make. Uh this last week they had a a school function and a science fair that had been done by the students and I think there were over 40 if I recall uh the principal's comments, brother Randy Timberman's and I want to commend uh the students. Uh it was just remarkable over 40 of these uh these examples of uh different scientific research that they had done and then uh concluded by wonderful artwork and uh just a lot of effort had gone into it and each one you know I stopped at several and had them explain what it was and I can tell you I was kind of putting them to the test. I thought maybe their mother and dad did the science project and they kind of, you know, brought the materials or something, but no, they could go through the whole thing and just tell you exactly what was happening and and how it functioned and how one thing reacted on other and and uh then they had a handing out of uh different ceremony at the ceremony uh the different awards that were given. But I just wanted to say to all of the students, I thought that you did a marvelous, marvelous job and uh it was just great to the teachers and to the principal uh brother Randy Timberman's to uh the comments that were made throughout the evening were just really wonderful. Then the volunteers, a lot of people volunteered and did things. And you know, these things are are it's a nice evening, but it doesn't happen by accident. There's a lot of preparation that goes into it. And uh quite frankly, I just am so happy every time I see our young people right from kindergarten. You know, there they were over in the in the library. I remember not very long ago that we were attempting to get 3,000 books. The government requires we have 3,000 books in a library. There's over 7,000 books in the library. And I think that is wonderful. And uh you as a congregation have have supported you have uh purchased books and and uh I just want you to know it's worthwhile. It's all worthwhile. We haven't made it official, but uh I'm going to just uh speak in faith right now. And uh and that is that Lord willing uh and we work is underway right now. The plans are well underway to construct a school building in the corner of the property right at the far corner. And it just worked out. Our brother Kim Dingwall is doing a lot of work working with the school board and uh and everyone is having their input and it appears as though we would be able to start on that in the very very near future and it's going to be a building that will include a science lab. Uh it will handle all the students we have now plus substantial growth. uh and we've been able to get sufficient height which at first we were not able to but working with the city uh we're able to get sufficient height to have a gym because as you know here this last winter we've had a lot of inclement weather and the children were out on the playground and they get cold they get wet but this will be a complete facility and we just have uh I don't have enough time to tell you but the regulations for the city are very very tight and And you can only get so much height and they're very strict on the height that you have. And that height depends on how far this church is set, this principal building is set back from the from the street boundaries. And when everything was finally calculated out, it was just absolutely perfect. The size of building that was required fits just perfectly in the envelope of property that is left out there. And uh and you don't know how much I rejoice over these things cuz I have a lot of internal secrets, you know, and one of them is that the congregation that wouldn't know is this entire parking lot is actually under easement. It's registered under easement to the city of Suriri. They own all that parking lot out there. And they wanted us to give them property for detention ponds, for storm detention ponds. and we didn't want to give up land. So we said, "What can we do?" You know, so it was suggested, "Well, let's shape the parking lot so it all drains and we'll give you that land." So they said, "Fine." So that's all series. We've been parking on it for years and we'll park on it till the rapture comes. And uh and so they the consequence of that is we can't build a building on it, but there's a corner there. Guess what? Just the size we need. Just exactly the size we need that they don't have. and they didn't need and so we got space. So I think uh for myself I'm satisfied the Lord that had that in his mind for a long long time ago and just said you know you can't have this corner cuz we're going to need it on down the road. And so I'm very very thankful for that and all the giving that you give and all the contribution all the support you give to the school directly to the school. It doesn't have to come through the church. Uh that is that is completely t tax deductible for you. And I can tell you one thing, it's a very very worthy cause. And for those of you that don't have children, uh it's still a worthy cause. For those of you that are young families and maybe don't have children, you will have children. For those of you who are empty nesters, that won't be long. You'll be grandparents. And uh I can tell you there isn't anybody that doesn't benefit from it. And and you singles that are sitting here and say, "Well, you know what interest do I have in a school?" Well, uh you will have someday and it's best to get a head start and support it now. God bless you. We were out at the camp this last week and the amount of work that has been done there is just staggering. Absolutely staggering. Uh I have to just say a couple of things. We had on real short notice on Friday. uh many of you were called and a lot of the your brothers sp uh you uh responded positively and were out there and I don't know what all took place but there's there's very senior brothers who are giving time up from their businesses they're giving time up from their work and so when you go out there and volunteer I'd like you to remember that there's other brothers that are volunteering businessmen that are volunteering time and taking senior positions our our brother Randy has been spending uh weeks, Brother Chris Peterson has spent full time essentially since we uh purchased the camp. And uh and I just want to tell you, we're going to have a request in a few moments, but uh there was a a a company that's been providing uh providing sand and gravel and concrete and uh they seemed very very favorable towards uh the the camp and the Christian camp and the people that they've met. and they met brother Randy and he spoke to them uh and I'll just it was cowen sand and gravel and they gave a check for $10,000 and they said if you need you know if the bill goes more then come back and speak to us and they gave a check for $5,000 last week and the the founder of that company he said I want to you know I want to meet your pastor and he drove out uh last Thursday and we spend about a half a day together and he's just a very very godly he goes to a Pentecostal church and uh he was saved when he was 12 years old and has never looked back and he said I'm interested in in something like this and I want to know kind of where you people are coming from and then we spoke and we had some uh breakfast together and uh shared different testimonies and he just very very fine godly man that's walked in the light that God has made known to him. I appreciated that and actually he gave me a personal check towards the camp as well. But uh putting all of that aside that's irrelevant. What I'm really interested in is that that the involvement that God has allowed us to be involved with has helped us to touch other people and for their lives to touch us and and that's what really makes it worthwhile. You know where when you work at another job or you work in a factory whatever more the kind of work you do and the place you work at is really irrelevant. It is how God arranges things while you're there. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; See, and where you shop and and what you like and what you don't like, that's really irrelevant. But it's what what God has arranged for who you are to meet and who you are to speak to and who you are to live in front of. So I uh I this week we're having a kind of a final thrust right now and it's just a restoration of the land and some landscaping and brother Gary St. John he's he's been working with brother Jack Aguary. So, we're going to need brothers this coming week. And if you have a day during the week, if you have a day off and you can fit in a day, uh give a day and then next uh a lot can come on next Saturday. But if we can do it in the week time, it will also be a benefit. And we just need a a final push. And the one thing that we're doing to and I can't take time in the morning service to explain why, but the the chapel building which holds about 250 or 300 people, it has no washrooms. And so, uh, Brother Randy has worked with the county in in putting the sprinkler and fire prevention system in and said, you know, we've got pipes coming up for the fire suppression system for the chapel and we got to have a place for those pipes to come up. It's called a riser. And so we but we we'll we'll build a washroom there cuz we need washrooms. And so, okay, they said. So, we didn't even need a building permit or anything else. are just letting us go ahead and put washrooms in uh to hold that pipe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I don't know if you folks know anything about negotiation, but I think that's real good negotiations. Uh we build the washrooms and get nice ladies and men's washrooms in there for 200 250 people because they they have to have the pipe in there for the fire uh sprinkler system. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, this last week we've had some miracles, &gt;&gt; and I believe in praying for answers to God, and I believe in taking time &gt;&gt; and giving God the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Few days ago, uh, uh, Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca, and I'm going to have you, Brother Toby, if you'll come here, please, and join me at the platform, would you? Brother Toby and his wife, Sister Rebecca, they're expecting a child. And uh Sister Rebecca has been carrying this child for 5 months. And they gave her tests on the child and the doctors and specialists determined that the child there was something wrong with the child and it was missing a chromosome and the child wouldn't be normal. And uh for those of you that don't know, quite often that indicates a down syndrome child. And uh brother Toby and his wife just met I and my wife. My family doesn't know about this at this uh at that time because they said we want no one to know. We don't we have not told our parents. We're telling no one. It's just us four in the room. But we've come here for prayer. and uh she is to uh she's to go now and they're going to give us a final word in 3 weeks that they're studying all of these tests and they'll take I think blood work as well and uh brother Toby perhaps you can just can you just tell us a little bit I want to give God the glory and then you can tell us a call that you got from the hospital &gt;&gt; speak up plane there &gt;&gt; God bless you all It's been about two weeks ago. My wife went to the hospital to get what they call I think ultrasound and we got a result from the hospital. The doctor called us and said there's something wrong with the baby. There's a chromosome missing. So the baby may have a problem with uh memory or something that but he said most of the case like 90% of the babies they just died. So there's no hope. So that was like two weeks ago. So I just told the doctor, "Okay, that's fine. We'll go and pray." So walking out of the hospital, me and my wife were just sitting in the car and said, "So what are we going to do?" And she said, "Oh, you know, it's good to call the parents and ask them to pray and call some friends and people that can hold and pray." Said, "I think that's a good idea, but we have a pastor. I think it should be good to call the pastor and mention that to him. So I called the pastor's house and there was sister ro on the phone and I told her uh we really need to talk to a pastor. We have a problem. We have a burden our hearts and we need a prayer. So okay you can meet the pastor before the service that was a Wednesday. So Wednesday before the service we went to meet brother Ed in his office and we told him what happened and said we haven't called our parent. They don't know nothing. We just keep a secret between you and us and God. We can ask you to pray for us. And uh my wife have to go back and get another blood test to make sure what's going on exactly. But they've confirmed by the hospital that the baby has a missing chromosome. Brother Ed said, "Okay, we'll pray." And they give us a testimony of brother West or deal. He had the same case and said, "Uh they've prayed for and God answer pray." Oh, this got a testimony. So, just bring our faith more higher than what we had. So, brother Ed prayed before the service and he just told me Toby, you go and believe. We know we have a God of miracle and our God's alive. So, just keep it keep it secret. Me and my wife, we won't tell nobody until God uh moved in the sand. Uh that was Wednesday. On Sunday, Brother Ed was speaking. I don't know if I I think it was just the Holy Ghost talking uh behind the pulpit but while brother Ed was preaching he mentioned something he was giving a testimony how people could come uh to the prophet and he could tell tell them the secret of their heart and he said our God is more than anything our God is more it's it's able I can't recall it exactly but I think our God is greater than the chromosome that you may missing and I just told my wife I think that is for us and we just kept and believe it so Tuesday morning and we received a call from the hospital and they said everything was fine the chromosome is just want to praise the Lord for [Music] that everything is fine now. You don't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; They said the chromosome that was missing is back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We give him praise. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not many days ago, uh, we've been we made an announcement that no one was permitted to go and visit Sister Megan and, uh, which we didn't we don't say a lot of the things over the pulp, but not able to. But they did say that the doctors felt she had menitis and also a fever. And of course the fever would be fighting against the menitis. I would expect she was not responding a whole lot and there were also times when she didn't recognize her father. That's just a few days ago as of yesterday. I will read this uh which uh Michael has provided for us. Megan has been improving and recovering in a miraculous way. Yesterday she was up in a wheelchair, had strength to cross her legs as well as to write a short note at not only strength, but that's something in in the mind. They have taken her off of oxygen and will be hopefully taking the trick because they had one uh out of her throat uh next week. Uh they will be attempting to have her walk next week as well as uh start her on weights for physical therapy. Con uh considering it has been only two weeks, her progress can only be the result of prayer and the Lord's intervention. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] We're going to have prayer, but I think before we have prayer, there's other testimonies here uh from brother Emanuel. His his wife had terrible high blood pressure actually was on the floor in the lady's washroom last Sunday and God has intervened and our sister Francine is here and we thank God for that. She was at a stroke level with her and with the medical people we have here in the church. Uh she was at a stroke level and and God has raised her up. And there's another one or driving home Friday night uh uh Absford. I can't re read the whole thing, but this is from brother Gretchen. And he looked in his rearview mirror and the car behind was not stopping and coming at them fast. And as he braced himself for the impact, the car swerved just clipping the rear bumper. And just want to thank the Lord, Brother Gretchen, Sister Elizabeth, we thank God for his protection. I'd like to have you stand. We want to sing to God be the glory. Great things he hath done. And uh and and if you don't have a reason to say, "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." I do. And I believe we all do. and I would encourage you to lift it up to him. Uh we want to thank him for what has been done and for what he will yet do. And we're going to then uh have prayer over these prayer cloths as well. We're going to be remembering also Mr. Cen who I just spoke to you about. His greatgrandson has just had a tumor. He's only 6 months old and has just had a tumor the size of a grapefruit removed from his body. I believe just yesterday he's in uh in a hospital in Seattle, Children's Hospital in Seattle. We want to pray and I told him we would pray for his great grandson and his name is Riley. So, we're going to be praying for him. Uh we're going to be pray for our sister Vineyard who's in the hospital with infection. We're going to pray for Hudson uh Drake who has got a lung congestion. And we want to pray for Sister Lana's father. Sister Lana was had to rush to the hospital yesterday. Her father had a cardiac arrest. He's in Royal Colombian Hospital. I have a cloth here. And these are the requests we're going to remember in prayer. But we're going to give God thanks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thanks for what he has done. Thanks for what he will do. Amen. To God be the glory. to God be the glory great things he have done. So the power that he gave us his son Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Give him the glory. He has praise the Lord. God to the Father and give him the glory things he have done. Now we'll bow together in prayer and unite our hearts. Father, we have come to the altar. We have come where we have received answers. We have come, oh God, to a living God, the only true living God. You're the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And as our Lord Jesus said, you're the God of the living, not the God of the dead. You're the God that spoke to Moses. You're the God that manifested yourself in this generation with supernatural signs and wonders and all manner of miracles. Oh God, you have never changed. Your attributes are the same today. Your mercy is the same. Your longsuffering is the same. We pray for the souls, oh God, of these that are needy. Sister Lana's father, oh father, how our sister Lana has been such a faithful sister, such a faithful witness, oh God, and always encouraging different ones within the assembly. I pray, Father, that her prayers and arms have come before you even now, oh God, as she holds before you her father and his soul. I pray, Father, that you will reach down into that hospital and whatever awareness he has, I pray that you will cause, oh God, his hearing to remember, Lord, his thoughts to remember the words that his daughter has spoken to him and the prayers that have been prayed for him. And even now, oh God, we just want to know that his soul is in your hands. In the name of Jesus Christ, touch his body. Sister Vineyard, Father, remove this infection from her, I pray, oh God, and raise her up, we pray, from that bed of affliction. Father, we pray for Mr. Cen's uh uh ch grandson, Riley. Father, I pray that you will cause this young lad to grow up and be a healthy boy. I would pray, Father, that he would be brought up in the fear and the admonition of the Lord. I pray, oh God, you'll bless, Father, our brother Cen for his for his prayers, for his faith, for his witness, and for his support of your work. Lord, we pray, Father, you will cause our fellowship to increase. And I just ask that you will hear not only his prayer, but ours today. And we pray for your word and your Holy Spirit, Lord, throughout the land and throughout this uh congregation today. We're here to hear from you, Lord. We're here to receive answers from you, oh God. We're here to receive revelation, oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll smite every devil of unbelief. I pray that you'll smite every critic. Oh God, I pray that you will bring a mighty mighty outpouring of your Holy Spirit upon your people and in the lands where this is meeting is now being streamed. They are a part of our congregation. Oh God, even into Saudi Arabia, into Switzerland and Norway and New Zealand, oh God, into China and wherever this will be heard. I pray you will bless your people immensely. And now Lord, we wait upon you. Anoint me, I pray to utter the words that you'd have spoken and the people whose hearts may be good ground to receive the seed in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Sorry to be delayed as much as we are, but I think this is important time. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to turn in your Bibles if you would please to second Corinthians. We're going to read a portion chapter 4 and we'll read from verse 14 to 18 and then on into chapter 5. This is a very full service. I I uh I I don't want to make it longer than it needs to be, but I felt that I needed to take time to just say some things that we haven't had an opportunity to say. And we've got two that are being baptized right soon as I finish preaching. So, &gt;&gt; my goodness, &gt;&gt; have burials. Have burials right after the service. Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Starting at the 14th verse. knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up uh raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you. like you to notice. We're going to go carefully here knowing that he he which raised up Jesus, none other than God himself, the heavenly father raised up Jesus uh shall raise up us also by Jesus. So this resurrection is certainly not for every person. This is those that Jesus is going to raise up and shall present us with you. For all things are for your sakes and the abundant grace uh that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redounded uh to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not. But though our outward man, notice that please, perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the fifth chapter. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that which we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up in life. Amen. And you may have your seats. I'm taking a fifth uh fifth message on the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. It's really been uh a subject that I've not been able to get over uh and get through &gt;&gt; the scripture which we read. We have we have a building of God our theophony body. I'm going to make some comments now. I find that this has been uh profitable just to set the tone of the service. Our theophony body is what we are going to. There's a lot of questions about our theophony body, the word body, the one you skipped around in the beginning. And on the one hand, we have one eternal in the heavens, theophony body, and yet it is calling for the word to be preached. Brother Brandham has spoken about this that that body is calling for the word to be preached here so that we might be formed into the full stature of Jesus Christ, the perfect son of God. When God said, "This is my son in whom I am well pleased." He didn't say that when he was 5 years old or 10 years old. But there was an appointed time in the life of Jesus when that voice spoke and he come to the baptism waters of baptism and the heavens opened and a voice was heard. Uh voice was heard also on mount transfiguration. Hear ye him. And so there are appointed times when this is done. I want you to think about the space of time that God has labored in bringing forth his son. And in the previous services I've been I kind of went back and how God in his great mind has brought uh the bringing forward of his son Jesus Christ and how he labored bringing forth his son and how all through the Old Testament from the foundation stones and the lineage uh through the children of Israel until a virgin received uh the word of God in the channel of her soul. soul and with a confession, be it unto me according to thy word. And that Virgin Mary received that uh the message from the angel, be it unto me according to thy word. And she had a conception. How long is God laboring? I'm asking a question. And how long is God laboring to bring forth the new man into the image of the theophony man? You know, is this something that's just instantaneous? No, I don't think so. I think that this is actually a process. Your eternal body, your eternal dwelling place is calling for what is needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of the things that people have as desires, we have we have just natural desires in life. We desire certain things. We we have ambitions and goals. But there are some desires which I think are separated from the other desires. They are very very deep abiding. They're more than a desire. They're a craving. They're more than a craving even. It is a it's a yearning. and perhaps even into a groaning within a person uh unspoken. Many times I think very most of the time those kind of cravings are unspoken. You crave for something of a very very deep spiritual uh something that cannot be explained because the language regardless of what language is your mother tongue that language will not fit that spiritual hunger and that spiritual desire now I'm separating that from just natural desires of this life. I believe that that spiritual desire actually is responding or is created within you as a result of what is waiting us on the other side and that is calling you to that place. &gt;&gt; So it's calling you in this physical realm to hear certain things. Now of the five senses of the five senses of this body, brother Brandham said these five senses were not given to contact God. But yet God uses it. It is not your taste buds. You don't gain faith through your taste buds. You don't gain faith from what you see. What you see might even be a detriment to your faith. You don't gain faith by your feeling and you don't gain faith by your seeing, but you do come to faith through your hearing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there is a channel that God has given that you hear the word of God and then God gave you a channel that's beyond the channel of the the channels of the emotions of your memory, of your imagination, of your conscience, of your affection, and of your reasoning. Bypassing those, there's a channel to the soul. And that one channel to the soul is for your your your belief or your unbelief. If you disbelieve or believe that's that that's what happens. And brother Brandham says one place your your free moral agency your choice to decide. I'm going to believe it. I won't believe it. And yet God has to give it. If you are a predestinated son or daughter of God, you will come. Amen. &gt;&gt; All that the Father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; And I will lose none of them. It just depends when you come. &gt;&gt; And I say sooner is is better than later. &gt;&gt; Come when you hear. &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself some irreparable heartaches. &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself &gt;&gt; all of the pain of waiting. So don't wait. Don't don't forget the devil is still a a terrible taskmaster. &gt;&gt; And he he does pay wages, but the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; And so how long is God laboring to bring forth the new man into the image of the theophony? And your eternal body, your eternal dwelling place is calling for what is needed. Your desires are evidence of that eternal home. Not just your not just a blanket statement of your desires. Oh, I'd like to repaint my house or I'd like to get another car. It has nothing to do that's irrelevant. That's just here in this physical world. But I'm talking about those desires that you have that are more than a desire. If you had that's why this world being as busy as it is is really a curse. It really is a curse to our our faith and our spiritual life. We need to minimize the things of this life so we can have time to ponder, to meditate, to pray, to be quiet, and to ask God on a continual basis. What would you have me to do? What is your will in my life? And give time to that. And get tuned to the invisible realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just so you can be thinking with me, uh when I'm I'm going to be coming back to these thoughts, but when God made the first man, Adam, he was made in the image of God. Brother Brandham says clearly he was a spirit. God is a spirit. So, the image that he made was a spirit man. And for the anyone who may be listening or may be here and has struggle with the trinity uh they said let us who is us let us well I just like to leave that there and have any trinitarian who may be listening or whoever will listen answer the answer me a question before I answer you like Jesus said when he was asked a question he says well I'll ask you a question first and when you answer my question and I'll answer yours. Uh so I ask trinitarians or anybody I say when okay you said let us I'll go with you. Okay that's exactly what the scripture says let us make man in our image. Uh my next question is did God did he achieve that? Did he make a man in his image and they always say yes. I said when he was done how many men did he have? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; And that was the image. So God is one. &gt;&gt; I don't try to explain who us. All I look at at the result when he was done he had one man &gt;&gt; in his image and in that image he had uh masculine feminine because his wife was taken out from him. That's right. &gt;&gt; But now uh the second chapter says uh 2 and 7 of Genesis that there was no man to till the ground. The prophet brings it in such simple language. A spirit doesn't have hands to put on the plow and to cape the garden and to cape or do whatever else. So uh uh so God took of the dust of the earth from which we all have come uh and formed him and breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul. So now he breathed into him the breath of life. That which God breathed into him was the invisible merging with the visible. &gt;&gt; And it's that invisible part that you can't understand. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's that invisible part that your English language or French language or German language or any other language can't really respond to adequately &gt;&gt; just can't. It's not made for it. &gt;&gt; But it is that that is the from the invisible world entering into the visible realm. There is a merging of those two. Please notice by the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I have some I have some slides that I'm going to show please here. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house. I'd like you to notice our earthly house, but we have a building of God. And the building of God is the build. The word building doesn't mean like another house. The word building is actually something that is built up, something that is constructed, something it it it's edifi, something that's an edifice. So it's we have a building. In other words, we have something that God has built and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. We have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For we know that if uh our earthly house uh of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. And the Lord God, the Bible says, "Now the Lord God formed man of the dust of the earth." So God, this is also a building of God. He formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. So the question there's always a a question and many people have posed the question to me is uh is there any difference between an unbeliever and a believer? Does an unbeliever have a theophony? Have you ever thought of that? says he made him out of the dust of the earth. Now, not in his own image, but he had already made the man. Then he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul. So the soul of man is the nature of the spirit. Now, brother Brandham said that very very early and he says it very late in the ministry. The soul of man is the nature of the spirit. He never changed that. Now you'll find in earlier messages he says body, soul and spirit and he takes the spirit as the inside. But as it comes to the and from the seals forward even in greatest battle ever fought he drew those three circles body, spirit, body, soul and spirit. But then uh later on he says body, spirit and soul. And he gives the distinction of the channels to the body, the channels to the spirit and the and the channel to the soul. The one channel to the soul. Now I'd like you to notice one thing. This phrase, the soul of man is the nature of the spirit. He never changed that at all. That always remained the same. So whether it's it whether the structures one way or the other way really is irrelevant. It is what is the function of each and the function of each remains the same. And the soul your soul is the nature of your spirit. And if that soul is changed if that soul life is changed it takes control of your your spirit realm and that spirit realm then is is controlled by the soul. If and the soul was made to receive the word. &gt;&gt; So in that challenge of the soul, a man either rejects the word of God with unbelief and that happens to be the only sin. &gt;&gt; Then if you reject that, your affections go sideways. &gt;&gt; Your reasonings goes haywire. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of your confession, everything of that realm, your memory will only remember negative things, wrong things, your imag, you'll imagine evil things, all of that. If that soul is not born again, &gt;&gt; so the soul has to go through the birth. When that goes through the birth, everything changes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God keep working on it. So now uh so the soul is the nature of of the spirit. When you're reborn, you don't get a new spirit. You get a new nature of that spirit. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit, but a new nature of it. You take you take two men, stand them together. Both look alike and one of them is a sinner and the other of them is a Christian. One man say uh I got a spirit of the same and the same as you have but one of them is a different his soul his nature is different and he's been he's been changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then uh Genesis 126:27, he formed them out of the dust of the earth and breathed into the nostrils. The prophet says, "And so he breathed into this man." He says, "I don't know how. I don't know how he made him. He put him in five senses so he could contact his earthly home and see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. And he made him in that manner. So these senses uh was not to contact God. It he didn't give the senses to contact God. Now in questions and answers says what connection does the first man have with the second man? The new man, the old man, the new man. What connection does he have? And he says, "The first man is the second man made manifest in five senses." The first man is the second man made manifest in five senses. In other words, when you're born here in this life and the breath of life is breathed into you, that is uh like a a human spirit. But now, here's where I found uh very very revealing for us. in the message and knoweth a not. Now, inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born here and the breath of life is breathed into you. That spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was given permitted by God. So I I want you to see very very clearly that that breath of life that you take when a child is born into this world that is not the same as God breathed into Adam in the garden. &gt;&gt; What God breathed into Adam is not a worldly nature. &gt;&gt; It can never be a worldly nature. &gt;&gt; It's a holy God. Amen. &gt;&gt; No evil ever come from him out from his being. And so this is very clear. And in the message continuing, knoweth it not, I want to read. He says, "Now, the only way up here in these spheres, I I I wish I'd had this on a slide, but uh the only way up here in these spheres that you could ever be in this little inside man, you have to be for ordained because you were with God. You are a part of God." Said, "I was in my father. I was in my grandfather and my grandfather's grandfather by seed. I was in that and I was in Christ. You were in Christ before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem his own. &gt;&gt; His own was what was in him. &gt;&gt; He says, "Hallelujah. His children that was in him. That's what he came to redeem." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there is a difference between what God breathed into Adam when he became a living soul and when a child is born by natural birth and takes the breath of life. Now here I want to make this difference very distinct. What God did, brother Brandham says in blasphemous names. What God did, he breathed the breath of eternal life. Amen. Then he became a living soul, a soul that can't die. &gt;&gt; Notice he said he breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils. He became an eternal soul because God breathed, not what nature done. Not what natural not what nature did. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it was after this God breathed into Adam. After this came the fall and then children, bisexual uh relationship and a natural birth. They said it's not by natural, not what come by natural. When we have a a natural birth and then God permitted that a human spirit and and and notice when he's praying for the sick, you'll hear it on the on the tape all the time. He said, "Now be real still. Be real reverent." He said, "Because you have a human spirit." Now, he wouldn't have to be saying that if that was the Holy Spirit in each person that was doing the moving around. It's not the Holy Spirit. You're human spirit. People become distracted. They become, you know, tired. They become whatever whatever. and and and even God himself standing present at the platform to heal and to reveal the secrets and to do all manner of of of supernatural things. But the human spirit can get restless. The human spirit can become distracted. That's the spirit that you're born with. &gt;&gt; But that's not the spirit that God breathes into you. When you receive the Holy Spirit in the baptism of the Holy Spirit, God breathes into you and you are an eternal son of God. But that seed laid in you from the beginning or you never would come. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the scriptures not reconcilable. All that the father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; They already were given. &gt;&gt; They already are his. &gt;&gt; My sheep. &gt;&gt; Whose sheep? &gt;&gt; My sheep. &gt;&gt; What do they do? know my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't say they will. Some of them will know or some of them might come. My sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they won't follow another. &gt;&gt; And if they do, they're they're troubled. They're not at home. They're not at peace. They haven't found and they got to keep going. What is it? that groaning, that desire, that that just drive within them, that yearning. I must find the truth. I must find uh what my soul is crying for. And for that son and daughter of God who is God's child, they have a theophony body waiting for them &gt;&gt; and that is what's calling them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between what God breathed into Adam uh when he became a living soul and he said so now notice he breathed into uh breathed of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul because God breathed not what nature done but what God did. breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul. Before Adam died, he had a lamb that redeemed him. Those who he forneew, he has called and he got a lamb to redeem him. So before before Adam even fell, there was already a lamb. Before the sickness came, as as uh I think Rabbi Richmond said, before the sickness came, there was already a remedy. &gt;&gt; He said, then you say, uh, brother Brandham, but he said, you know, then you say Adam died. And he says, but remember before Adam died, he had a lamb that redeemed him. And redemption is to buy him back. &gt;&gt; He says those who he forneew he called and he got a lamb to redeem to redeem them. He said he was a type. Adam was a type. Adam fell. Then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of eternal life. He was redeemed because already he had in him the breath of life. You understand? &gt;&gt; So then Adam and Eve had children and on and on till we've come into the world and we have when we issue into the world, we take that breath of life. That's not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's a human spirit. &gt;&gt; And we're born in sin and shape in iniquities. But then if that one that's been born is a forordained, predestinated son or daughter of God, they will hear the voice of God &gt;&gt; and they will come &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit comes to them. &gt;&gt; And so here he's saying he was a type. Adam was a type. Adam fell. We all were in the fall. Then the lamb was provided for Adam because already why was the lamb provided? Because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God and he become a living soul. He was a son of God says not his breath as the African word they call amoya. And I don't know if some of our people here from Africa, but in in in one of the languages of Africa, at least it's called ammoya, which means the wind and unseen force. Notice, brother Brandham says this, animals breathe ammoya and sinners breathe amoya. That's not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's not the breath that we're talking about. Just to bring you right up real quick, the breath, so I don't want to lose you. The breath of God is something that issues out of his being. Uh, you have breath. I have breath this morning. So I can go, that was breath. Doesn't mean anything to you. That was breath. I also have voice as you have voice. I can say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's also breath. &gt;&gt; I can say repent and be saved. Every one of you be baptized. Every one of you. That's also breath. &gt;&gt; I can say forgive me Lord Jesus. I'm a sinner. Forgive me. That's breath. And God can say, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the coming of the Son of Man." That's breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's breath through Malachi said, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord." That's God's breath. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's breath says, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." That's God's breath. &gt;&gt; And why does God issue out his words by his breath? That is his breath. This here is God's breath. &gt;&gt; And he has given a certain voice, a certain portion, a segment, time locked segment for every season. So that the his children who come up, the predestinated, the elected that come up in that generation, they will hear that voice because that voice belongs to the invisible part of them that they've not been able to understand. That voice and this has to merge. &gt;&gt; And it does merge because one was made for the other. &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like when God breathed into Adam the breath of life. And I'd like to suggest to you that wasn't just a a a blow of of air. &gt;&gt; God breathed into him the breath of life. It's a very very interesting thought and I'm going to come to it in a few moments. But that breathing, I would like you to think of that breathing as uh someone who's trying to revive someone else and they're giving them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. And I have read account not very long ago, I believe, of a a fireman and uh whether it was a policeman or a sheriff or what it was, but this person, this fireman was terribly uh injured in a fire and they began this this officer or another uh another one of his friends, I don't know what it was, whether it was a fireman or a police. I think it was a policeman. And he began to give him, this happened in Ontario, began to give him mouthto-mouth resuscitation. And he labored and he worked and he blew and he he was trying to get the man over an hour. I think about an hour and a half. And he labored till he just felt he could not go on any longer. He had no strength left. He had no energy left. But he's trying to blow life into this man. And that man came to life. And the man wrote a large article in the Reader's Digest. Outstanding. Very, very touching. But he came back and he remained unconscious for a very long time. And then and then it's it's an outstanding account and he woke up. It's really incredible. But now if you think of that, now I want to I want you to think of God breathing. &gt;&gt; So he began to breathe through his prophets. He's exerting himself. He's sending out his word. He's calling the people. He's trying to direct them. He's trying to heal them. He's trying to tell them of his goodness. And he's blowing into them. Trying to get Israel to come to life. Trying to get this generation. And he's standing and he's blowing trying to resuscitate as it were Leodysia and saying, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. Hallelujah. What's he trying to do? He's trying to grow life into a dead church. &gt;&gt; And for centuries, for centuries, he been seeking to blow life because there's been his word, his voice to the people, and his And why does he do it? Because he's got sheep out there. He's got children out there. And he's going to bring them to life. He's going to redeem them by his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Didn't happen just with a, you know, we read it and we think, oh, it was just a had nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; It was a labor. &gt;&gt; A labor of love. &gt;&gt; I'm going to resuscitate them. &gt;&gt; And that's why he breathed into Adam. See God breathing into Adam. This is my son. I'm going to bring him back. &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem him. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave him in the devil's camp. &gt;&gt; He slipped into death. He slipped into separation. But I'm going to unite him back to myself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Blow my breath into him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to thrust it through the man of God. I'm going to thrust it through the minister. He's going to preach with every ounce of energy that he has. He's going to I'm going to thrust my voice through him. I'm going to call out &gt;&gt; and something's going to reverberate inside of somebody. It's going to be a daughter or a son of God and it's going to respond to that seed. There's going to be a vibration and they're going to respond to it. What is it? It is the invisible merging with the visible. And then their life is changed and the habits drop off and the attributes all the attributes of sin begin to fall away. Why? Because they heard the voice of God and received the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Everything's different from then on. &gt;&gt; Your lives have been changed &gt;&gt; because God breathed into you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What God breathed into Adam is equal to what he is breathing into us by the breath of his message. &gt;&gt; I want you to take these phrases as I touch me very very deep. I want you to take them. What God breathed into Adam is equal to what he's breathing into us by the breath of his message. This message we've talked about a message is the breath of God. &gt;&gt; If it's not, how does it change lives? &gt;&gt; And those that have claimed salvation, those that have it, it is a sad we have a sad disaster last night. How many you have heard about? Just a handful. Just travel to Abbottzford, 30 minutes down the road and you'll come to the turnoff, the turnoff circle off of the freeway on Macllum. And you turn off in Macallum, there's a huge church right there. That church had a rock band they called Christian rock band last night and hundreds they said about 1,200 young people were there and they and they said on the news they were jumping and dancing in front of the stage and the floor gave way and over a hundred of them fell to the basement and over 40 of them are injured and three critically. The senior pastor was uh speaking about the event and about the structure of the billy and everything. I can tell you before God, I thank God that I wasn't the senior pastor of that church &gt;&gt; trying to go on national television and tell. In fact is if I'd have been a reporter I would have been asking what is this rock band doing and what is young people jumping and dancing? Why don't they go to a rock concert if they want to do that &gt;&gt; and rock in front of the platform where the word of God is supposed to come. You think that people with a sincere heart can have confidence this morning that something's going to come across that pullpit? Where's it come to? &gt;&gt; Do I have a Do I have a reason to be able to cry out? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; They call Christian rock even in Pentecostal churches. It's a shame. It's a disgrace. I have nothing to do with it. before God. I thank God for the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Going the way of the world. Our lives ought to cry out against it. &gt;&gt; I can tell you the Lord Jesus Christ, he would not be easy on that. He'd say false prophets. &gt;&gt; False teachers &gt;&gt; leading the people to a slaughter. No wonder the prophet of God had to scream out against that, telling them 45 years ago, you're backsliding, [Music] &gt;&gt; letting the women go on in their way and nakedness and shorts and cutting their hair and all these things and the men and and and the men agreeing to it. There's any man that hasn't got the back backbone to stand up against that, you ought to repent yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this congregation, you ought to support that and support that kind of preaching behind this pull. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Not a moy of the wind, but the breath of God that has spoken, the word of God. And even this morning, he's seeking to blow into your being, down into your soul. The Holy Spirit is seeking to blow the channels of that spirit realm clear and get rid of all out of the trash. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that you never go back that direction again. We're not directed to by that spirit realm, by that emotion and the affection and so on. We have it. We thank God for it. But it needs to be under control of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that come from the soul. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. &gt;&gt; The breath, this breath of life is that final act of God in God's labor bringing forth our house which is from heaven. &gt;&gt; Notice it was God's final act to breathe. breathe, resuscitate, bring back to breathe into Adam, to give him his voice, to give him his word. And I don't know what all God said to Adam, but he breathed into him and he became a living soul. There was a reaction, &gt;&gt; a positive reaction. When God breathed into him, he didn't say, "Well, it wasn't enough." &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have any negative confession. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't come up with some confession. Well, you know, thank you, Father, for that, but I need more. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm getting to you or not. &gt;&gt; That was the final act. &gt;&gt; This is a key point. Stay with me. Final act. When God breathed into Adam and he became a living soul, then God was in Christ &gt;&gt; for what purpose? To reconcile the world to himself. &gt;&gt; And what is Christ's final act? &gt;&gt; Just before he leaves, &gt;&gt; breathes upon the disciples, says, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And then comes 2,000 years of church ages. And at the end of the age, not a reformer but a prophet has to come at the end of the age because the last act, the third pull act, the final act is breathing out the word of God to the people. [Music] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a resurrection breath. &gt;&gt; It's a rapture breath. &gt;&gt; It's a invisible merging with the visible. This body according to the breath of God, this body that you're sitting in must be changed. If you're a son or daughter of God, this body must be changed. It can only be changed by the breath of God. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is not a rock band. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is not just some entertainment on the platform. The rock of God is not some social uh social sermon. The rock the the breath of God is not about politics. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is the original word that's been spoken brought forward to this age. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is a messenger that can come and that God by the Holy Spirit directs him to exactly that portion of the scripture. That is his breath for this age. &gt;&gt; That's his breath for these people. &gt;&gt; His breath for you. And there is no other voice that will satisfy what's inside. &gt;&gt; If you think there is, go on your search. &gt;&gt; I'll invite you. Go on your search. Go your way. If you think it's a television evangelist, fill your stomach with it. If you think of some loosey goosey, you know, something something out there, foozy floozy stuff, help yourself. Fill your stomach full. &gt;&gt; You'll find out it won't hold you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll leave you empty. &gt;&gt; And when you're done, you'll find yourself in terrible condition &gt;&gt; and you'll be crying out. If you're a son or daughter of God, you'll be crying out, "Oh God, have mercy upon me." Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The breath of God in this final act in God's labor, bringing forth our house which is from heaven. The power of the revealed word of God breathing eternal life into us here and now. Building our house which is from heaven. May I just shock you by saying your house which is from heaven is under construction. &gt;&gt; Jesus said I go &gt;&gt; to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; and if I go and prepare a place who do you think the son of man is? Who do you think it is that was revealing himself when the messenger stood here and come in the same pattern of Jesus Christ? Come out of nowhere, come with no background, comes with the same character, the same attributes, healing the sick and doing all manner of supernatural things and the phenomena and the stars and and the dove coming from and the lights and so on coming. It's all the same pattern. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Bible language. &gt;&gt; And a cloud coming &gt;&gt; and the cloud meant something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To just a few &gt;&gt; and a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And while baptizing &gt;&gt; in the water, &gt;&gt; and the lights that come and the different things doesn't mean anything to a lot of people, but to the elect, it means a lot because it's Bible language. [Applause] It's not sermonizing. &gt;&gt; It's not homalytics. &gt;&gt; It's not out of a seminary. &gt;&gt; It's out of the eternal God. &gt;&gt; And somehow it touches you. &gt;&gt; Somehow there's something in you because that and you have to merge &gt;&gt; because it is the physical now meeting the spiritual. &gt;&gt; It is the new man. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's the old man and the new man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then there's just this this man here of this flesh, &gt;&gt; but inside there's an old man and and he's got to experience a transformation and become a new man. So the power of the revealed word of God breathing eternal life into us here and now building our house which is from heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; In his final act, Jesus breathed on his disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." And the Son of Man revealed in this last age &gt;&gt; breathes into the bride body as a last and final act of his ministry, &gt;&gt; the breath of the third pull. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it doesn't mean anything to you, you ought to get a hold of it and say, "God, why doesn't it mean something to me?" It's the breath of the third pull, the third pull of brother Brandham's ministry, the third pull of Christ ministry was breathed on them. Receive ye the Holy Ghost to lead them. The last part, where's the people that were healed? Where's the Where's the people that experienced the miracles? Millions of them received the miracles. Where are they? &gt;&gt; Where's the people whose hearts had the the secrets of their hearts were revealed? Tens of thousands, millions of them. Where are they? &gt;&gt; Where are all the people that ate the supernatural food when Jesus was being crucified? Where were they? &gt;&gt; Whose voice was it crying out? &gt;&gt; Where were the supporters at that time? &gt;&gt; As it was then, so is it now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there was a little band. There was a little group of elect people. Hallelujah. They on whom he had breathed and when he breathed as his final act because Jesus was the beginning of the new creation of God according to the word of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the new creation. &gt;&gt; And so the beginning of the new creation did exactly what the heavenly father did in Eden. Breathe into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul. &gt;&gt; And now the now that that that first Adam fell and the creation fell with it. And he says, "And and then this natural body," that's why you're dying. &gt;&gt; Because he said, "We must fall with the fall. &gt;&gt; We're part of the fall through a natural birth, through sexual birth." Even though you received a you received a human spirit, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the breath of God that comes by the Holy Ghost. And I can tell you what came out of that messenger's mouth was the Holy Ghost. [Applause] [Music] That's why Jesus said, "Go and tar in Jerusalem until he be endued." And so 120 went up there and Pentecost has tried to replicate and duplicate that. It that didn't come to be replicated and duplicated because what came out of that was Peter and the 120. And then Peter stood up and he said, "Men and brethren, &gt;&gt; hear me. &gt;&gt; Hear what I have to say." &gt;&gt; Why? Because that breath now became his breath. Hallelujah to God. God was continuing to breathe. God was continuing to resuscitate the people. And when he breathed on the people, they they were pricricked in their heart. Men and brethren, what must we do? And Peter then breathed the Lord. Repent. Every one of you repent. Turn around. Go the other direction and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. and you shall receive the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The breath of the third pull. &gt;&gt; The resurrection breath. I say breathe on me. Breathe on me. Oh third pull, breathe on me. Oh the voice of God in this last day, breathe on me. Hallelujah. Sometime we get weak and sometime we get frail spiritually. You need that breath to be resuscitated. That's why we say hear the word. Hear the message. Hear it. &gt;&gt; You're privileged people. There's multitudes who wish they were sitting where you're sitting. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily in this church. I'm talking about &gt;&gt; hearing what you have heard &gt;&gt; in this day. &gt;&gt; Resurrection breath, the merging of the visible with the invisible. &gt;&gt; It's the final act after a very long process. God in his labor pains bringing you forth. &gt;&gt; I'm just got a couple of moments and I'm going to close. We're going to go right to the baptism. I'm a long ways from being done. I'm on page three of 13. in Ephesians parallels Joshua we're reading of Paul's writings and that's what he taught the church brother Brandham is speaking the church positionally before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world how long has this been happening how long has this been taking place before the foundation of the world and he says God in his labor labor pain was bringing forth you. [Music] &gt;&gt; God in his labor pain before the foundation of the world. God in his in his contemplation and his death. God's a living being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of children will I have? What kind of a family I desire? fellowship. Yes, I've made angels and they're worshiping me, but there was still something in that great eternal being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he desired something closer. I want to make them free. I want to let them have free will. I want them to have choice. I want them to respond. I'd feel very very shortchanged if I would have to live with my wife and point her to our marriage certificate and say, "Hey, you're married to me and don't forget it." And I expect a certain standard of service here in the home. And she could, like brother Bam says, take me by the tie and say, "Listen, you know, I don't want you to have eyes for anybody else and you be the way you're supposed to be and you provide for me. Matter of fact, we don't have quite enough money in the bank. Uh, you know, you're my provider. Wouldn't that be a terrible place? &gt;&gt; But we just, you know, we're married to each other &gt;&gt; and we don't feel we don't regret over that. We don't we're not despondent about that. &gt;&gt; God wanted children. &gt;&gt; He wanted a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're sitting here today. And you know what you're doing by sitting here? You are your own witness either for yourself or against yourself. that you're here in this church &gt;&gt; hearing this service today &gt;&gt; being blowed on &gt;&gt; and blowed into by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You're your own witness. I'm here. How am I here? Is this an accident? Someone invited me. I came here for a certain purpose. I came here because I was invited. I came here because my parents are here. I came here. No, no, no. You're here. You're here by no accident. whatsoever. &gt;&gt; You're here to hear a special message that God is breathing his voice &gt;&gt; into your very soul. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose that you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, with this I close. He said, "And there's something that you have that is a craving and a groaning, something maybe you weren't even aware of when you drove here to the service, &gt;&gt; but you have a spiritual hunger. And in a message thirst, the prophet calls it thirst. &gt;&gt; You have a thirst. &gt;&gt; You're thirsting almost painfully thirsting after something. Don't blame me. Don't blame God. Brother Brandham said, "It's your body." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the invisible, it's your body calling for those vitamins. The vitamins this morning to alert you this morning. And he talks about when mother was his mother was carrying children. He said we are so poor. And he says then then she be to crave for something cantaloupe watermelon something strange perhaps. She began to my wife and she was carrying Linda. I don't know who to blame. My wife or Linda but she craved raw potatoes. So now the whole world knows dear. And we were in meetings and I didn't understand it. I'm just a young man. Now I'm going to make a confession and and you ever have anything aggravate you? And we're trying to practice and sing and she's carrying Linda and my wife's playing an accordion. Sister McGriff playing an accordion. I'm playing a guitar. Brother McGriff plays a guitar. And we're trying to practice quartets. and and and and all I hear is crunch clench crunch cl when will you be done with these raw potatoes? Even cooked ones would be more silent, but these had to be raw potatoes. And so she'd crunch on those raw potatoes. But you know the thing was brother Brandham says now her body's craving it &gt;&gt; because the child needs it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the bride of Jesus Christ, I'm not trying to make a doctor. Now, the bride of Jesus Christ as a as a wife of the husband says, "I've gone to prepare a place for you." Oh, you know, I I could preach here for another hour and I would just be nicely started. I will go and prepare a place. That's who it was that was here. Brother says, "It's not me, it's him." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're all I I I I was going to speak something else, but now I'm I'm to speak this. And those messages came as a breath of God coming and maybe and and you know what the people were there. He said to brother Billy Paul in one of the seals, he said, "Did you understand that, brother Billy?" Says, "Yep." He says, "No, Billy, did you understand what I preached?" Yeah. Yeah, Daddy, I did. Billy, did you understand what I spoke today? No, I didn't. Lots of people didn't understand it back then. Do you know why it was for you? &gt;&gt; There was all kinds of things that were spoken time locked for you right now in this time. Because the end time message meets the end time conditions. And the conditions are different now than they were there. There isn't anything. There isn't storm. There isn't earthquake. There isn't famine. There isn't anything that can take the son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; There isn't enough devils in hell. &gt;&gt; I'll announce to Lucifer himself today, the word which we have, the breath of God can also blow him away. &gt;&gt; The breath of God with faith coming down into brother Toby and Sister Rebecca's heart can put a chromosome where the doctor said there wasn't one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The breath of God takes a menitis away and it's one time it's there, next time it's not there. That's the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we give him all the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; And so the baby the baby craves for it. The mother craves for it cuz the child is calling for it. &gt;&gt; And now I'm part of the bride. You're part of the bride. We're part of this woman called the bride of Jesus Christ. And then we get under. We we get a craving. We don't understand what the craving is. And we begin to speak things that we don't even know that we're speaking sometime. But it's you, your body in the invisible world calling for that vitamin. [Music] &gt;&gt; Your eternal home. I go to prepare a place for you. If I didn't believe it was Jesus Christ that had called me, called these other brethren, called you. If I didn't believe that, I guarantee you, I would not be here. I would not have spent this week studying. I would not sp be standing behind this pullpit. It's him &gt;&gt; preparing the place for you. when your time comes that you'll be able to go and he says so that the child can come into the world and be happy and be fully developed. That's God's plan. &gt;&gt; And God's plan is for you to be able to pass. And when that moment comes, you'll take a step and you have a theophony beside you. But what's happening today certainly is contributing to what's happening on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. [Applause] Those who are going to be baptized, why don't you just slip away now and and prepare and we're just going to sing a song and we're going to have the baptismal and immediately after we'll be dismissed. I think we've done real well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did those raw potatoes do something for you, dear? They did. Good. We're We're glad God's got everything fixed, hasn't he? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that really sounds strange." Well, nothing strange in God's economy as long as it works. &gt;&gt; Just works fine. Amen. Let the Holy Spirit just perfectly have his way. I I have a a a song I want to sing our chorus. Maybe you can just stand with me. I know I just wrote it down here. We place you in the highest. You'll help me, brother. We praise you for you are the great high Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat. [Music] and we worship. [Music] Oh, we praise you. Let's do it together in the highest place for you.

These there will be two that are coming to be baptized. Young man and a young woman. And our brother Ben came from not that long ago all the way from India and heard of the prophet's message in India and immigrated he and his family to United States and ended up in Mary'sville and heard of the church here. And he may say more about that. You know, when someone walks into the tank, uh there's an incredible uh just an incredible caring that God has led an individual. And we're very thankful for our Ben that is here today. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're real thankful for what God's doing among us. And um I've just want to bring our attention to the two that'll be baptized. Uh, brother Ben uh is 21 years old and sister Tyra is 19 years old. And it just seems in the last uh months that God's been dealing uh in a certain uh level with a certain group within our assembly. Uh we have brothers that have come from England, New Zealand, young men, and others that God has been uh within this whole area. There's a reason why God is dealing with a certain generation in this hour. I just wanted to bring our attention to that before our baptism of our brother Ben. Uh brother Ben was aware of the message uh back in India. He was born in the Punjabi uh region and with his family and they he went to be baptized actually at one season of his life and there wasn't enough water uh in the Creek River that they were going to. So when they immigrated to uh the United States and down into Mary'sville area and he began to search for a church, an area uh called the office and has been coming, this is his third Sunday, he's drove up by uh himself and God is uh dealing with Ben to give his heart uh to him again and wanting to be filled with the Holy Ghost. And the very first time that I spoke with uh Ben, actually both of these individuals have been put off. Uh uh we just just waiting and just seeking for the right time. Ben came last Sunday and wanted to be baptized last Sunday. And like we do with all, we just want them to know and understand who they're getting married to. And uh brother Ben uh brother Ben when I first spoke to him last Sunday just in a few moments my heart went back to the book of Acts chapter 8 and I know you're very familiar with uh brother Philillip uh when he was in a revival in Samaria and God was uh moving in that city and then God called him to be walking down a road and there was an Ethiopian unic that was in a chariot uh coming down that road that was reading the book of Isaiah. You remember that? And it was the angel of the Lord that spoke. The Bible says in verse 26, chapter 8 of Acts, the angel of the Lord spake unto Philillip, saying, "Arise and go toward the south into the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza, which is in the desert." And so it was the angel of the Lord that was leading Philillip, a a message believer, to come in contact with another seed of God. And immediately when I was speaking to our brother Ben uh this uh Ethiopian unic came into my heart because in verse uh that when you look in chapter 8 when they were riding in the chariot and then Philip came up into the chariot in verse 36 the Bible says and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the unic said see here is water hinder me to be baptized baptized. So it wasn't the minister, it wasn't his family, but it was the unic that said, "I want to be baptized. Here is water. What do hinder me?" And brother Ben has that in his heart. The same desire to give his heart to Christ and here's water. I'm at this junction. I've received Jesus Christ and I want to be baptized. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to allow Brother Ben to just speak what's on his heart. Uh I want to let you know all my brother and sisters because uh uh I'm not a native English speaker so I have a sometimes I do so so many mistake when I speak so please forgive me. &gt;&gt; Yes. So uh in the presence of God or in my all brother and sisters I uh I regret or confess my all sins what have I have have done in my life all evil uh evil things what I think used to think in my life or so I'm not a good u I'm not a good Christian I wasn't a good Christian but I want to be a guru Christian according to Bible according to our uh uh revelation of our through the revelation of our brother uh William Mariam Brenon I want to be live my life according to Bible or according to uh true message. So uh how much time I can take brother? Uh I want to let you know guys I have my uh spiritual testimony or my physical testimony. So I'll start with my uh spiritual testimony. God revealed me his uh revelation. He's the God who he's the only one God. He's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he he's the only one God Jesus Christ. So he's a his great revelation he revealed on me through our brother William Mary Brham. So, so my physical uh testimony is this. Uh when I first came in this country, I mean in United States, uh I had a uh severe uh rupture disc problem. So I can barely stand. I can't barely you know uh sit. I just I was you know very in very bad condition. &gt;&gt; Yes. So I went to the doctor uh hospital they got everything uh examination they said you have only one ch uh one option surgery that cost me like $40,000 uh $1,000. So I kind of thought that so I pray uh my my trust my belief in Jesus Christ they said you'll be going to paralyzed because my both legs was all time you know numb or you know uh tingling or what can say &gt;&gt; low life. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, but I believe Lord Jesus Christ, he's able. He's worthy. He's he's that great Lord. He can heal the paralyzed peoples. &gt;&gt; So, Amen. &gt;&gt; So, in front of viewer guys, I'm I'm healthy. I can stand. I can walk. I can walk. I praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to uh express my feelings about my brother and sisters. You know uh the one thing I missed in my life when I came here in United States in my church my that great message that uh brotherly love you know I try to find out that place where I can get that love where I can get that message. I went to a different different church right by my home, you know, but I never ever get that that thing. So, I I I just I can just thank God. I'm I found that brothers, I found that sister. I again I found that love or that brotherly love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham said they stopped the chariot and down in the water and baptized him and the Holy Ghost caught Philillip out of his sight till he didn't see no more. We just pray God will come to brother Ben today. Fill him with this Holy Ghost. Amen. Let's pray together. Father, your calling and your dealing in this end time hour. So many of us remember back to the day and to the season that you dealt with our lives and it was so personal and it was so real. Lord, our brother Ben has come all the way from India and settled in another country. And Lord, I believe in his heart he's looking for another country and another place that today is one footstep closer in that direction, this baptism and this time in his life where you will seal him with your spirit. Lord, may you come today as he's repented, he's confessed, Lord, his wrong. May you come even this very hour, this very season, and fill our brother Ben with the Holy Ghost. That he would be a testimony to his mother, his father, his brother, Lord, and others in his family that are searching and looking also for this reality. I pray that you'd make him a thunderbolt and a powerhouse that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, I pray that you would grant the desires on his heart. What you've done for his physical back and for his life to touch him. Would you do for his spiritual life, may you continue to reveal yourself, make yourself known to our brother Ben. And we commit him to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. and our brother Ben, according to your desire and your hunger to be filled with the Holy Ghost and you've repented, I baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I've been to the water and I've been baptized. I was washed in the blood of the lamb. I changed from the creature. Heat. Heat. I had to change my sins were free when I was in darkness. Heat. Heat. [Applause] in the Lord has his way. Praise God has been changed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, the dealings of God are so sovereign and so supernatural. Uh also with this is Sister Tara. She's almost 19 years old. She's uh been in middle school uh with Sister Patricia Stein and others that were in the assembly. and she's been raised in a Baptist uh background knowing of Jesus Christ from a young girl has never been baptized in and given her heart to the Lord. And um we were actually this afternoon supposed to meet together about baptism. And I'll just say this um I was going to put it off for another season of time. And we were just in prayer in my office this morning uh contemplating brother Ben's baptism. And um there was something in our hearts. The Lord had already given us um some some quotes that we were looking at. I've shared it with Tara since that I knew that there was something more. There was another person that God was dealing with and I didn't know if it was Tara or someone else in our congregation. So when I was in prayer and I said, "Lord, I need a word from you. I just need a witness in my heart." if it's for Tara or someone else you're dealing with in our congregation. So when I was um preparing for Ben and then I was in prayer and the Lord had given us this quote and when Philip had said here's water what does hinder us in adoption brother Brinham said nothing if you're ready that's the time don't let the devil get a chance to wedge something in there don't put off for tomorrow the things that you could do today tomorrow might not come for you I remember one time I did that and I learned and it taught me a lesson and I put off something that I should have done one day and the next day it was too late. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, who are you dealing with? Is it Terra? Is it someone else in our congregation? I got up from my uh little chair and I was thinking uh about these things, Tara." And I walked around to my desk and that's when they called. And so I know that the Lord has a mind for today, for Tara and also for maybe someone else. And I spoke to Tara this morning. And still even then I was just very hesitant to whether to put it off if this was the right time for Tara. She's been coming now for the last uh 6 weeks or so to the young people's meetings and to the congregation. Her mother's here this morning. I just pray that God will fill Tara with the Holy Ghost and that he would just vindicate his dealings in our lives that are so sovereign. And I believe this is a special day for Tara. And when we were fellowshipping about the scripture and the Lord had already laid this on our heart uh even for brother Ben, the Bible says, "What to hinder us?" And Peter said on the day of Pentecost, this is brother Brandham speaking in another message. Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. He said that's the one that you see working here. For the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. He said follow that correctly and find out what takes place. That's what I did and that's what took place. And he said, "You do it and it'll take place for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe this is for Tara today. She's desired to give her heart to Christ. Even her own mother has mentioned to her that since she's been coming in these last few weeks, what a change she's seen in Tara's life. And I pray that it would be even more, Pamela. And I just pray for what God is doing among us and in this season of time that he would just pour into this new generation more of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, you're so wonderful to us. Lord, you speak into the corridors of our lives in so many different ways. The beckonings of your spirit, the dealings of your presence, your word has mean meant so much to us at this junction in our time of life. And for Terara, Lord, that has walked almost 19 years on this earth for the certain season, the certain time when the message would come by her way. There's been others, some have already gone on to their reward and others still linger that she's been with in middle school and through high school and even working. There's a reason why you've dealt with her in this way. And Lord, we're just praying together as a body of believers that you would fill Tara with the Holy Ghost. That as she's repented, she desires to give her life to you. That you would come to her at this time and pour yourself into her life. what natural mother and father, even a church could not do for her. May you do for our sister Tara. May you satisfy the longing, the aching, the soul's cry, as we heard this morning, the word that she's been hearing has been matching that soul's thirst. And I pray from this moment on, as she sought to take on your name in baptism, she understands that she's being married to you. that you Lord from this moment would draw closer, nearer, not just around her but inside of her soul. Bless her today God. In the name of Jesus Christ, we commit Tara to you. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Sister Tara, according to your desire and your thirst for more of God and just responding to his dealings in your life, I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Why don't you stand with me? I've been changed. We just sang it. Let's sing it again. I've been changed and I've been reborn. All my life has been God has been changed. Why don't you turn around, shake hands with as many as you can while we sing it again? I've been changed and I've been reborn all my life. My life God has been changed. And with that, we dismiss you in Jesus name. We'll see you this evening. Brother Tom Ray will be bringing the word some more of the breath of God. Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Yes. Father Jesus Father Father. [Music] Amen. Wonderful.
