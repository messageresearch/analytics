[7:56] Hallelujah.
[7:58] Hallelujah.
[7:59] Our Lord is truly beautiful.
[8:02] It's his face that we're here to seek
[8:04] tonight.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; We want to reach beyond this scene this
[8:09] evening.
[8:11] Hallelujah.
[8:14] Hallelujah. We're in touch with this
[8:16] realm,
[8:18] but we want to reach into that unseen
[8:20] realm this evening.
[8:23] Amen. I'm going to invite brother Codle
[8:24] if you'd come this evening and open the
[8:26] service in a word of prayer.
[8:29] Sister Lana wants to give thanks that
[8:31] her her dad is back from death's door
[8:34] and she wants to thank every single
[8:36] person that prayed and spent a moment in
[8:39] time and the Lord's presence on his
[8:42] behalf. Just a absolute miracle that the
[8:46] Lord has brought to our brother. So we
[8:47] want to thank him for that. If you have
[8:49] a need upon your heart, our God is
[8:51] great. Our God is wonderful. We just
[8:54] want to take this time this evening, set
[8:57] aside the week. It'll be there tomorrow,
[9:00] Lord Terry's, but if not, we wouldn't
[9:02] want to have missed an opportunity like
[9:04] we have this evening to meet with our
[9:06] creator once again. Brother Codle, would
[9:07] you come?
[9:09] [Music]
[9:14] Let's bow our heads.
[9:16] [Music]
[9:20] Most gracious Father, we thank you for
[9:22] this night, Lord Jesus. Another
[9:24] opportunity that you've afforded us,
[9:26] Lord, to gather into that name that is
[9:30] above every name,
[9:32] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[9:34] Savior Jesus Christ.
[9:36] Father, we just yield our hearts to you
[9:38] tonight, Lord, that you may take the
[9:41] word and engraft it in us, Father, that
[9:43] we may be changed.
[9:45] And Lord, we do thank you and give you
[9:47] glory and honor tonight.
[9:50] And Lord, we thank you for meeting every
[9:52] need in this body, Lord. So many
[9:54] miracles.
[9:56] So many answers to prayer. We just thank
[9:59] you, Lord. We just take this moment to
[10:01] give you praise, to give you honor, to
[10:04] give you glory, Lord. Father, we thank
[10:07] you now, Lord. We ask that you would
[10:09] anoint the man of God, Father, as he
[10:12] comes forth tonight, Lord, that the man
[10:13] would step out of the way. And that the
[10:16] uncction of your spirit would flow into
[10:18] this place, Lord, and that our hearts
[10:20] and souls will be filled with fresh mana
[10:24] from above, Lord, as you would feed us.
[10:27] Feed your sheep tonight, Lord. We're so
[10:29] hungry and thirsty for you, Lord. We
[10:33] ask, Father, that our hearts and ears
[10:34] would be open and sensitive to that
[10:37] which you would speak to each of us
[10:38] individually, Lord. Meet us where our
[10:41] need is tonight, Lord. We are a needy
[10:44] people, and we're so thankful for your
[10:46] grace and mercy.
[10:50] And we ask this in the name that is
[10:51] above every name, the name of the Lord
[10:55] Jesus Christ.
[10:57] Amen. And amen.
[11:01] Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[11:03] seats this evening. We do want to greet
[11:06] each and everyone. Those on the
[11:08] telephone hookup and on the internet
[11:09] hookup as well. Let's make sure that
[11:11] you're real welcome in the service this
[11:13] evening.
[11:15] Is everybody happy?
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm truly happy to be here be
[11:20] fellowshipping with you around the
[11:22] revealed word of the hour.
[11:24] The uh brothers from the camp put in
[11:26] another notice. They still need some
[11:28] assistance down there at Mount Baker
[11:31] Bible Way Camp. So, if you do have time
[11:33] on the 2nd and the 3rd, please go and
[11:36] bring your appetite. Lunch will be
[11:38] served so you can work up a good
[11:39] appetite and have that fulfilled as
[11:41] well. So, it's kind of a package deal.
[11:43] It's good for everybody. Praise the
[11:44] Lord. Well, we don't want to take any
[11:47] more time. We invite our pastor to come
[11:49] this evening.
[11:51] Maybe we'll just sing uh 982 on the
[11:54] screen. Elo Elohim. This song sends me
[11:58] right back to Abraham's tent. I can see
[12:01] Abraham sitting in his tent door and
[12:03] seeing Elohim walking down the way. And
[12:05] that's the way my attitude is tonight. I
[12:08] don't see a minister or pastor, Brother
[12:10] Tom, Brother John coming to the pulpit.
[12:12] I come in with the attitude, Elohim is
[12:14] present.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's come that's going to
[12:17] speak to us. We're his bride.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; We're his bride. That's who's desiring
[12:22] to speak to us tonight.

[19:51] Oh God,

[20:06] Peace
[20:07] like a river
[20:10] [Music]
[20:15] of mountain.
[20:18] The wind

[20:43] My Holy Spirit,
[20:48] let your fire
[20:54] peace.
[20:56] [Music]
[20:59] &gt;&gt; As we invite our pastor to come to bring
[21:02] the bread of life to us this season, we
[21:05] invite the Holy Spirit.
[21:09] Oh, the wind of your spirit.
[21:22] [Music]
[21:36] Let your Higher
[21:41] you come
[21:49] your
[21:50] [Music]
[21:53] Holy Spirit.

[22:04] [Music]
[22:06] holy spirit come.
[22:09] Holy Spirit,
[22:13] let your fire.
[22:16] [Music]
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] Amen.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; That's our desire.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here tonight.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your fire fall.
[22:33] I was thinking of that just before
[22:35] coming to the platform.
[22:39] Thinking when John said of Jesus Christ,
[22:41] he said, "He shall baptize you with the
[22:44] Holy Ghost and with fire."
[22:48] I was just pondering that, you know, not
[22:51] only the Holy Ghost and with fire, it'll
[22:53] be a pure fire.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; It'll be a wonderful flame. Amen.
[23:00] Well, we're going to go immediately to
[23:04] the word. I believe that's why you've
[23:05] come. And I'll read some scripture.
[23:09] Uh we're going to
[23:12] continue on and take part six.
[23:15] from the heavenly bridegroom created his
[23:17] own bride
[23:19] and just see how God will allow us to go
[23:21] this evening. I want to review a little
[23:24] bit of last week, but we can do it quite
[23:26] quickly because I have all the slides in
[23:29] place
[23:31] and uh
[23:35] so we'll just try to cover as much
[23:38] ground as we can in as short a time as
[23:40] we can. Appreciate you all being here
[23:42] this evening. Without you, we wouldn't
[23:44] be having a service.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; That's for sure.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you for driving the many miles
[23:50] you've driven, taking the time off, and
[23:54] I appreciate it. I know that God
[23:55] appreciates it. Amen.
[23:59] Just before we read, I'm just going to
[24:00] ask the Lord's blessing on our reading.
[24:04] Father, we are so dependent upon you, so
[24:08] incapable within ourselves.
[24:11] And right now, Lord, I'm just casting
[24:13] all my care on you because I know you
[24:16] care for us. Committing this entire
[24:19] service, Lord, in the next uh the next
[24:22] hour or whatever time it is that you
[24:25] lead us, oh God, I pray the Holy Spirit
[24:28] will come and visit each individual
[24:30] where they are. Lord, I pray that you'll
[24:33] speak to them in a language they
[24:35] understand, in terms they understand. I
[24:39] pray, Father, for those that are heavy
[24:40] and burdened that they will hear the
[24:42] words of Jesus Christ. Come unto me all
[24:45] ye that are weary and heavy laden. And
[24:47] so many are today, Lord. And you are the
[24:50] one anointed by God, the word coming to
[24:54] us to loosen the bonds and the bands
[24:58] that bind and the prison from the prison
[25:01] cell. Lord, I pray you'll break the
[25:03] doors of the prison house. Let the
[25:06] people be free, oh God. And we've not
[25:08] come here to be bound and cold and
[25:10] formal. We've come here to en enjoy and
[25:13] worship, oh God, our salvation. And if
[25:16] there's some here who have lost the joy
[25:18] of their salvation, I pray you'll
[25:20] restore that joy of salvation to them
[25:22] again this evening, Lord. And I pray
[25:25] that you'll give utterance to your word,
[25:27] Lord. May my lips simply be a tool in
[25:29] your in your hand and and may you
[25:32] receive all the glory in the name of
[25:35] Jesus Christ. We ask it and thank you,
[25:37] Father God. Amen.
[25:40] I'm going to read out of uh 2
[25:42] Corinthians once again the fourth
[25:44] chapter, but we'll just uh start to read
[25:47] at the 18th verse and then continue on
[25:51] into the fifth chapter for four verses.
[25:59] While we look not at the things which
[26:01] are seen, but at the things which are
[26:04] not seen, for the things which are seen
[26:07] are temporal, but the things which are
[26:10] not seen are eternal. Isn't that a
[26:13] powerful verse?
[26:15] &gt;&gt; I love that verse. For we know that if
[26:18] our earthly house of this tabernacle
[26:21] were dissolved, we have a building of
[26:24] God and house not made with hands
[26:26] eternal in the heavens. Now, if I can
[26:28] just have your attention this way for
[26:30] just a moment, please. The Apostle Paul,
[26:33] in fact, is when uh uh when the apostles
[26:36] and those that spoke the word, they
[26:38] didn't speak them into nice little
[26:40] chapters and verses like this. They were
[26:43] just speaking. And then at later time we
[26:46] don't know when in in history man began
[26:50] to assemble it into chapters and so on.
[26:53] So now when Paul is saying while we look
[26:57] not at the things which are uh which are
[27:00] seen. So he's talking about the physical
[27:03] but at the things which are not seen. I
[27:05] want you to really grasp. He's saying
[27:07] while we look not at the things which
[27:09] are seen but at the things which are not
[27:12] seen. So he's saying we can look at the
[27:14] things which are not seen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; It's almost a it's it's like a paradox
[27:18] but it's true and you have to catch that
[27:21] because we we need to you know we need
[27:24] to look at the things which are not
[27:27] seen. Everybody has a goal and an
[27:29] objective you know something they want
[27:31] expect to do in life. Show it to me. I'd
[27:34] like to see it so I can handle it. Well
[27:36] I can't really show it to you but I
[27:38] could describe it to you. And if you
[27:40] could describe it accurately enough,
[27:42] then I would get a vision of what it was
[27:44] that you were you that you were h
[27:47] holding in your mind as a vision as an
[27:50] objective. You see, then I could see it.
[27:52] Jesus said, "The world won't see me, but
[27:54] you'll see me."
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't going to be here
[27:58] physically. They wouldn't be able to see
[27:59] him. But you'll be able to see me. And
[28:01] now Paul goes straight on into the next
[28:03] verse, which is the next chapter. But
[28:05] don't get don't get distracted by that
[28:08] or derailed by that. He goes right into
[28:10] the next verse and he says, "For we know
[28:13] that if our earthly house," that's
[28:14] what's seen. If our earthly house were
[28:17] dissolved,
[28:19] then you wouldn't see it. If it were
[28:21] dissolved, we have a building of God and
[28:24] house not made with hands, eternal in
[28:27] the heavens. For in this we grown
[28:30] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[28:33] with our house. Our house which is from
[28:36] heaven. You should be able to say while
[28:38] you read that with my house which is
[28:41] from heaven. We just This isn't a group
[28:44] revelation. This is an individual
[28:46] revelation. We can't get joy. I can't
[28:49] get joy over the fact that you have it.
[28:50] I get joy over the fact that I have it.
[28:52] You have it. That's where your joy is.
[28:55] So my house which is from heaven, if so
[28:58] be that being clothed, we shall not be
[29:00] found naked. For we that are in this
[29:04] tabernacle do grown, being burdened not
[29:07] for that uh we would be unclothed but
[29:10] clothed upon that mortality, that's the
[29:13] clothing he's speaking about, that
[29:15] mortality may be swallowed up in life.
[29:19] God bless you as you have your seats.
[29:27] We have a building of God and house not
[29:30] made with hands.
[29:33] Now, our physical body, as we just go
[29:37] over all the several weeks that we've
[29:40] been going over this, our physical body,
[29:43] as we understand from the message, been
[29:44] under construction for a long time.
[29:48] For those of you that browse around on
[29:50] computers and you'll come on pages once
[29:53] in a while, you'll come up on a page and
[29:55] it'll say under construction.
[29:57] And I'm sure you've seen that. And then
[30:00] I go back to that page later on, maybe
[30:03] weeks later, and I still find it's still
[30:04] under construction.
[30:07] I see some of you smiling. You've run
[30:09] into that. And then you might even let
[30:11] two, three months go by and it's still
[30:14] under construction. And I quit going
[30:16] there. They just been under construction
[30:18] too long. Well, we've been under
[30:20] construction a long time.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God said, you know,
[30:24] that that that sun and that the planet
[30:28] out there and the sun and the clinker
[30:29] flies off and maybe drop for millions of
[30:32] years and then God stopped it. We can't
[30:35] understand all of that. Then it then it
[30:38] you know materials and and elements and
[30:43] whatever more came to make up our body
[30:45] said what was he doing? He was making he
[30:47] was making you. Well, we just pass over
[30:50] that because we don't understand it. Uh
[30:52] we can't comprehend a God of that a you
[30:56] know that kind of power and that kind of
[30:58] control. But that's that's God. All
[31:01] things are possible with him.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; And so our physical body's been under
[31:06] construction throughout the ages. And
[31:08] then we went through how we are a body
[31:12] uh spirit and soul. We have a human
[31:15] spirit that entered our body at the time
[31:18] of birth and giving uh giving life
[31:21] giving animation to our our person so
[31:26] that we can uh we express what we are
[31:29] when you have a child if it's born and
[31:31] it's still born. It may be absolutely
[31:34] perfect. It's got you know 10 fingers
[31:37] and 10 toes and everything's perfect
[31:39] just perfectly shaped. might might even
[31:41] resemble might even see some resemblance
[31:43] of the parents in that child, but it's
[31:46] still born. The spirit did not enter it.
[31:49] There's one thing that's absolutely
[31:50] sure. Now, you don't have to even be a
[31:52] prophet to say it. You say no one will
[31:55] ever know what the nature of that child
[31:59] might have been because there's not. It
[32:02] takes the spirit to enter it to give it
[32:05] animation.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; We don't know whether it's a quiet child
[32:08] or a boisterous child. We don't know
[32:10] whether it was athletically inclined or
[32:12] intelligent or more intelligent or had a
[32:14] higher IQ or what it was or whether it
[32:16] was gifted with art or in music or
[32:18] whatever or we don't know anything about
[32:20] it. We only maybe know it was a boy or
[32:22] it was a girl and that's about it. But
[32:24] the spirit of life did not enter the
[32:27] child was a stillborn. If the Holy
[32:30] Spirit does not come and confirm within
[32:34] the religious world, if the Holy Spirit
[32:36] does not come and confirm that that is
[32:39] his word, that I'm the author of the
[32:41] word that this person has received, then
[32:44] it's a stillborn, a spiritually
[32:47] stillborn,
[32:49] &gt;&gt; because it takes the Holy Spirit to give
[32:52] the animation or the the manifestation
[32:55] of God to that individual.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; You believe that? But I'm sure that you
[32:59] do.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible tells us also that
[33:03] uh that when God had completed his his
[33:06] uh uh creation of of Adam had made Adam,
[33:10] made him an image uh like himself that
[33:14] he breathed into his nostrils and he
[33:16] became a living soul. I I made a
[33:19] distinction last Sunday that it was
[33:22] different between what Adam received
[33:25] than what a child receives when it's
[33:27] born into the world. When uh that which
[33:30] Adam received was God the life of God
[33:34] himself that God had created and
[33:37] breathed into him and he became a living
[33:39] soul. Uh and and and that was in that
[33:43] physical uh body. So now I want to
[33:46] perhaps justh take a couple of the of
[33:48] the slides and and go through from last
[33:51] week with you. Uh and this is the
[33:55] scripture for we know that if our
[33:56] earthly house of this tabernacle were
[33:58] dissolved that we have a building of
[34:01] God. We have I I I like that phrase. We
[34:04] have I have a building of God. Not I
[34:07] will have I have that building of God.
[34:10] And we're going to be speaking about
[34:11] that as as we go along. and house that's
[34:14] not made with hands, eternal in the
[34:17] heavens. And the Lord God formed man of
[34:20] the dust of the ground and breathed into
[34:23] his nostrils the breath of life, and man
[34:26] became a living soul. Now remember
[34:29] that's in Genesis 2 and 7. But in
[34:31] Genesis 1 and 26 and 27, let us make man
[34:35] uh in our own image. And God created man
[34:38] in his own image. He made him in his own
[34:41] image. And and but but it's in chapter
[34:44] two when he formed him of the dust of
[34:46] the earth, he breathed into his nostrils
[34:48] the breath of life and he became a
[34:49] living soul. Made him out of the dust of
[34:52] the earth. Now not in his own image that
[34:56] not the dust of the earth. See he said
[34:58] he had he had already made the man.
[35:01] That's in that's in Genesis 1 and 26 and
[35:04] 27. He had already made the man. Then he
[35:08] breathed into him the breath of life and
[35:10] he became a living soul. So the soul of
[35:13] man is the nature of the spirit. And you
[35:16] see the reference there of the message.
[35:18] When you're reborn,
[35:21] you don't get a new spirit. You get a
[35:23] new nature of that spirit. It's the same
[35:28] spirit, but a new nature of it. It's the
[35:31] same spirit, but a new nature. You take
[35:33] two men, stand them together. Both look
[35:36] alike and one of them is a sinner and
[35:38] the other of them is a Christian. One
[35:41] man say, "I got a spirit the same as you
[35:44] have." But one of them is a different.
[35:46] His soul, his nature is different. He's
[35:49] been changed.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Two standing right together. Genesis
[35:53] 1:26-27.
[35:55] He formed He formed them out of the dust
[35:58] of the earth and breathed into his
[36:00] nostrils. He then he asked the question,
[36:03] what connection does the first man have
[36:06] with the second man? The man that was
[36:08] made in God's image, God is a spirit and
[36:11] the man he made was a spirit man. That
[36:13] was in Genesis 1. In Genesis 2, it says
[36:17] there was no man. He'd already made man
[36:19] in his own image. But in the next
[36:21] chapter, there was no man to till the
[36:23] soil. And as the prophet says, a a
[36:26] spirit doesn't put his hand to a plow
[36:28] and care for the garden. There was no
[36:31] man to care for the care for the garden
[36:34] and to and to care for the earth
[36:36] actually. And so what connection does
[36:38] the first man, the spirit man have with
[36:41] the second man? The first man is the
[36:44] second man made manifest in five senses.
[36:48] He gave him this body and he has the
[36:50] five senses to taste, feel, smell, hear
[36:53] and so on.
[36:55] Now the inside of that is a spirit which
[36:58] you become when you're born in here and
[37:01] the breath of life is breathed into you.
[37:04] That spirit notice I have underlined
[37:08] that spirit is of a worldly nature. I
[37:11] just stop there for a moment. You can
[37:12] take any child
[37:15] boy or girl. You can say I'm I'm going
[37:18] to isolate this child. I'm going to I'm
[37:20] going to take them into the woods into
[37:22] the wilderness. I don't want them to see
[37:24] any evil. I don't want them to be in
[37:27] contact with any evil. I don't want them
[37:29] to hear anything wrong. I don't want
[37:31] them to hear any cursing or slang. I
[37:34] don't want them I don't want them to see
[37:36] television or any I don't want them to
[37:37] be in contact with the world. You can
[37:39] have them out there and isolate them.
[37:41] But it's just as sure as you're
[37:43] breathing God's air, that child, that
[37:45] child will show an evil streak someplace
[37:47] along the way. He'll have a temper or
[37:49] lie to you or do something. Why? because
[37:52] it's born in sin and shapen in
[37:54] iniquities and comes into the world
[37:56] speaking lies. That's just our nature.
[37:58] We have to be changed
[38:00] &gt;&gt; by a new birth.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And so that breath of life that you took
[38:04] in when we're issued into the world from
[38:07] our mother's womb, that was not that
[38:09] that that is not the Holy Spirit of God.
[38:12] You must be born again. And you must be
[38:15] born again of the word and the Holy
[38:18] Spirit. And then you have the spirit of
[38:20] God. God breathes his spirit into you.
[38:22] We're going to get much more into that.
[38:24] So that was a spirit of a worldly nature
[38:27] because it was not given from God, but
[38:29] it was permitted. It was given or
[38:32] permitted by God. There is a difference
[38:34] between what God breathed into Adam when
[38:37] he became a living soul and when a child
[38:40] is born uh by a natural birth and takes
[38:45] the first breath of life. Before Adam
[38:48] died, prophet said he had a lamb that
[38:51] redeemed him. And the reason we bring
[38:53] that in is because Adam fell.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve fell in sin, but there was
[38:58] a lamb. The Bible says the lamb was
[39:00] slain before the foundation of the
[39:02] world. I'm just tying a lot of these
[39:04] thoughts together as we move rather
[39:06] quickly. Those who he forneew, the
[39:09] scripture says he has called and he got
[39:12] a lamb to redeem them. He was a type.
[39:15] Adam was a type. Adam fell. Then the
[39:18] lamb was provided for Adam because
[39:20] already in his nostrils had become the
[39:24] breath of the eternal God. That's not
[39:27] Adam didn't have a birth by sexual
[39:29] birth.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; He wasn't conceived by a sexual
[39:33] relationship. He was created by God.
[39:37] That's very very important. I just want
[39:39] to stay with that a moment. Now,
[39:41] &gt;&gt; he already had the breath of eternal God
[39:44] and he became a living soul. Notice now
[39:47] as I ended last week, that was a final
[39:50] act, a final act of God upon his
[39:54] creation that God breathed into him, his
[39:58] breath. That happens to be the same word
[40:01] that is used, the same thought that is
[40:03] used concerning the scripture. All
[40:05] scripture is given by inspiration of
[40:08] God. inspiration is like a a breath of
[40:11] God. And that is why Jesus then did a
[40:15] final act at the second uh when when
[40:18] when he was just getting ready to depart
[40:22] after the resurrection and he breathed
[40:24] upon his disciples and said, "Receive ye
[40:27] the holy receive ye the Holy Spirit.
[40:30] Receive you the Holy Ghost." And that
[40:32] was one of his last acts in his entire
[40:35] ministry is he breathed upon them.
[40:38] That's very important because God,
[40:41] oh my, the Bible says that all things
[40:44] were made by him. In the beginning was
[40:47] the word and the word was with God and
[40:49] the word was God and the Bible says all
[40:52] things were made by him and without him
[40:55] was nothing made that is made. Christ
[40:58] was the logos that came out of God by
[41:01] which God uh uh created all things
[41:05] because the scripture says all things
[41:07] were made by him and without him was
[41:09] nothing made that is made. So all things
[41:12] were that was the creative force and
[41:14] that is why all things were made by the
[41:17] word.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; God spoke the word. You know, we we
[41:21] would just bring it down into into at
[41:23] our our level for a moment and I was
[41:26] pondering this today at length. Here we
[41:29] are uh very very different one from
[41:32] another and so on and our lives are
[41:34] different. But there's one thing that we
[41:36] do have in common and that is that your
[41:39] life is largely made up of what you have
[41:44] heard what you have observed in life uh
[41:48] what you have allowed yourself to be
[41:50] affected by. So your maybe your parents
[41:53] instructed you and taught you in certain
[41:55] things, your father, your mother, and
[41:58] they said, "Now look dear, this is the
[41:59] way you do things. And if you do it this
[42:01] way, this is what happens." And so maybe
[42:04] maybe mother taught the girls how to how
[42:06] to cook or how to bake. And if you do
[42:08] this, you'll have a flop. You'll have a
[42:10] failure.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Some of you young ladies that when you
[42:14] first got married,
[42:16] uh, you know, maybe you had to learn how
[42:18] to cook. I don't know.
[42:21] Hope you have kind husbands. And
[42:25] my wife, my wife doesn't mind because
[42:27] we've been married a long time now, but
[42:30] she made some biscuits
[42:32] when we first got married.
[42:35] And I looked at those biscuits and I
[42:36] said, "The only thing that would raise
[42:38] those is dynamite.
[42:41] They were flat and heavy."
[42:44] And uh they weren't like those nice
[42:47] fluffy biscuits. But you ought to see
[42:49] the biscuits she cooks now. And she'd
[42:51] just cook them up in a few minutes. And
[42:53] you know, uh, I said, "Well, we got any
[42:56] bread for toast?" "No, don't worry. I'll
[42:58] just make some biscuits." And she has
[43:00] biscuits on the table there are hot and
[43:02] steaming and they're just lovely in just
[43:04] a few moments. But we didn't learn it.
[43:06] So, learn it overnight. But something we
[43:08] acquired in life. Some of you fellas, I
[43:10] looked at you, you know, and you said,
[43:11] "Well, I'm a drywaller and I'm a
[43:13] carpenter and I'm this and I'm that and
[43:16] and uh where'd you learn it?" Well, you
[43:18] know, I just hung around this person or
[43:20] that fellow told me or I read it in the
[43:22] book. I went to school and I read it.
[43:24] So, we we become what we are largely by
[43:30] what we've heard and what we've seen and
[43:33] what we've observed. And you you parents
[43:36] now that have children, you don't even
[43:38] have to say a whole lot to your
[43:40] children. They're watching you. They're
[43:42] just observing you. And even when
[43:44] they're not realizing that they're
[43:45] observing you, they are observing you
[43:48] and they're learning. They're simply
[43:49] acquiring habits, they're acquiring uh
[43:53] traits, they're acquiring things by
[43:55] observing you. And now when we become a
[43:58] believer, we become born again. And we
[44:00] begin to feed on the message. We begin
[44:03] to feed on the word. I can tell you that
[44:06] you might hear something. You may hear a
[44:08] message. You may hear a tape. and and
[44:10] that that may not you might not realize
[44:13] there's any effect on you at all but on
[44:15] down the road that's affected you it's
[44:18] affected your thinking and it forms you
[44:20] into the kind of person that you become
[44:23] brother Brandham says that the those
[44:25] prophets of old they were in the deserts
[44:28] so long uh in the presence of God they
[44:32] were transformed persons creatures
[44:35] transformed men they come out of that
[44:37] presence of God I tell you what it's
[44:40] It's a power. It's something real. It's
[44:42] a reality.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; And it has an effect on the individual.
[44:46] All right?
[44:52] So, he became a living soul. And when
[44:54] God breathed into Adam,
[44:57] uh what God breathed into Adam is equal
[44:59] to what he's breathing into us by the
[45:02] breath of his word, by the breath of his
[45:04] message.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And here's where I came to end. Now last
[45:08] week this breath of life is the final
[45:11] act in God's labor bringing forth our
[45:15] house which is from heaven a a word
[45:19] body. Now this is it. I know it gets
[45:22] over some people's heads but just hang
[45:23] on here. So the power of the revealed
[45:26] word of God breathing eternal life into
[45:30] us here and now building our house which
[45:34] is from heaven. Now, for those of you
[45:37] that weren't here last week, and I'll
[45:39] just say this now. In his final act,
[45:41] Jesus breathed on his disciples, saying,
[45:44] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. The Son of
[45:47] Man revealed in this last age, breathes
[45:50] into his bride body as a last and final
[45:54] act of his ministry." And I've called it
[45:57] the breath of the third Paul.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Or the resurrection breath.
[46:04] I want that breathed over me.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want it when I'm six feet under.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; I want the breath of the resurrection
[46:12] breathed into me now and here.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; I want to have that present with me.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; That breath of life that you took when
[46:20] you were just a few seconds old. You
[46:23] still have it.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; You've been through a lot, but you still
[46:27] have it.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? You had it then and you
[46:31] needed it then or you'd have been still
[46:33] born and you still have it now. And when
[46:35] that leaves you, you're going to be
[46:38] finished.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; That's one place we all find common
[46:42] ground. If that if a if a person goes
[46:45] the way of the grave on the slab,
[46:47] doesn't matter whether you're rich,
[46:49] poor, what you were, healthy, sick,
[46:52] whatever, we're all on common ground.
[46:54] Then
[46:57] &gt;&gt; I want the breath of the resurrection
[46:59] life. Now merging uh the merging of the
[47:03] visible with the invisible. And I
[47:05] pointed out when you were born because
[47:07] the natural types the spiritual when you
[47:11] were born into this world. Now you you
[47:14] just you must see this when you were
[47:16] born into this world.
[47:18] God permitted that spirit, that human
[47:23] spirit that you have that's unique to
[47:25] yourself
[47:28] and it fits your person,
[47:31] your your physical being, your physical
[47:36] your your your physical body, who you
[47:39] are. It's not some something strange.
[47:42] It's not some uh some different kind of
[47:45] species that came to you. This I hope
[47:49] this doesn't sound foolish, but just
[47:50] listen for a moment. It wasn't something
[47:53] foreign. It had to fit you.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; That spirit was made for that body that
[48:00] came.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Those two merged together, the
[48:03] invisible, like brother Brandham says,
[48:05] you've never seen me
[48:08] &gt;&gt; and I've never seen you.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; The real you, I've never seen
[48:12] &gt;&gt; and the real me, you've never seen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; We shake hands. We smile at one another.
[48:18] We look into one another's faces. But
[48:20] quite frankly, we have never seen each
[48:23] other because at some point in time when
[48:26] you were birthed into this world, a a an
[48:30] element from the invisible
[48:34] &gt;&gt; came and merged with the physical self.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; And when they're separated, there is no
[48:41] more no more you really you. you've
[48:45] passed into another another place for
[48:47] the believer for the believer that has
[48:50] believed that's been birthed of this
[48:52] seed.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Now this is a seed.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; This produces something.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; I I have to speak perhaps elementary but
[49:02] it is like and I've used this analogy
[49:04] many times but you can find the most
[49:07] awkward young man in in you know 15 or
[49:11] 16 years old. What do you want to be? I
[49:14] want to be a doctor. No, I don't I don't
[49:16] want to just be a doctor. I I want to be
[49:18] a brain surgeon. What's going to
[49:20] transform that awkward uh uh fellow like
[49:24] with he's got 10 thumbs? What's going to
[49:27] uh you say, "Well, I hope if I ever need
[49:30] surgery, I don't fall under your
[49:32] scalpel."
[49:34] But what's going to transform him from
[49:36] that into the kind of person that he he
[49:40] could be perhaps one of the finest
[49:42] doctors there is? He will study the
[49:45] words of learned men. He will study the
[49:49] words of those that have experienced and
[49:52] experimented and and all of the things
[49:55] that he can uh get lay his hands on. and
[49:58] he will go to school and he will be
[50:00] mentored by uh by men of great great
[50:03] intelligence in that particular field
[50:06] and on a few years it may take him 8 10
[50:09] or 12 years to go into that kind of
[50:12] special field but that awkward young man
[50:16] will be transformed into maybe one of
[50:19] the finest surgeons in the country. What
[50:22] did it? Bunch of books.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; We are transformed.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; This word that I hold tonight has
[50:31] infinite power.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; It's not going to make us into some
[50:35] qualified person here on earth for a job
[50:38] or a profession, but it's going to make
[50:40] you ready
[50:42] &gt;&gt; to pass from this realm into another
[50:44] realm. And that's the kind of power,
[50:47] that's the kind of word that I want to
[50:49] give myself to. You need to give
[50:51] yourself to
[51:02] &gt;&gt; in the message who is this Melzdc.
[51:06] Uh brother Brandham went on to say God
[51:09] in this stage of his creation. You
[51:11] understand there was a certain stage of
[51:12] his creation later formed into the into
[51:16] flesh into Jesus Christ became Jesus
[51:19] Christ and from the great beginning
[51:22] spirit then came down to be the word
[51:25] bringing itself out he becomes flesh
[51:29] Jesus uh mortal to taste death for all
[51:32] of us sinners when Abraham met him he
[51:36] was Melzdc now watch there's three
[51:38] things happening here when Abraham met
[51:40] him. He was Melzdc, king of Salem,
[51:43] priest of the most high God. And that
[51:46] was a theophony.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; He unfolds here what all of his
[51:52] attributes, all the attributes will do
[51:55] in the final day, in the final end,
[51:57] every son of Abraham, every son of the
[52:01] faith will absolutely do the same thing.
[52:04] In other words, they will he was he was
[52:07] displaying to Abraham the kind of body
[52:10] that his sons would come to in every son
[52:13] of every son and daughter of God. He
[52:15] said we see the attribute sons of his
[52:18] spirit have not yet entered into the
[52:21] word form body of theophony.
[52:25] This body is subject to the word and
[52:28] waiting for the earnest change of the
[52:31] body. Now last week and brother Brandham
[52:35] in this in this message he also goes
[52:37] into how a how a mother and I I just
[52:40] want to uh cover this as well how a
[52:43] mother carrying a child now we all were
[52:45] there every person is here and I I'm
[52:49] speaking to adults and those who
[52:51] understand you young people we've spoken
[52:53] very plain here but we all were in our
[52:56] mother's womb
[52:58] and in that state our mother at some
[53:02] point craved for something.
[53:05] She craved for a certain thing, but that
[53:08] craving was actually your body. You
[53:12] don't remember that, but your your body
[53:15] was craving for certain things and that
[53:19] it required and your mother craved for
[53:22] those things that the child might
[53:25] receive that that you would receive it
[53:27] and be born a healthy child. Now that is
[53:30] God's God ordained it to be that way.
[53:34] And now the prophet of God is is showing
[53:36] us very clearly taking from what apostle
[53:39] Paul has written. If this body, if this
[53:42] tabernacle be dissolved, we have another
[53:48] waiting eternal in the heavens.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Now we might just, you know, these are
[53:55] these are some of my own personal
[53:57] questions. I know that we we're speaking
[53:59] about the rapture last night over
[54:01] brother brother Joe and sister Bobby's
[54:04] but I personally believe that that
[54:08] theophony body that you have
[54:12] I would suggest to you that it's been
[54:14] under construction also
[54:18] you've been under construction a long
[54:20] time
[54:21] and something is taking place that you
[54:24] and I
[54:26] uh we we have very little concept of we
[54:30] have what Apostle Paul has said what
[54:32] brother Brandham has said concerning
[54:34] that we have another
[54:37] uh now you just go back for a moment now
[54:41] you're you're in your you're in your
[54:43] infancy you're you're just been
[54:45] conceived in the womb uh and you have uh
[54:49] uh you're you're forming you're being
[54:51] formed and uh your body is calling for
[54:54] certain elements and certain vitamins
[54:57] And uh the the mother now becomes she is
[55:00] the incubator. She is uh carrying you
[55:04] and she is taking on these things that
[55:07] you are calling for and your body is
[55:09] receiving that. You're not aware of it
[55:12] at all. The prophet of God is saying
[55:14] that you have a body. And the reason why
[55:17] I say it's under construction is because
[55:20] the prophet also says that God will call
[55:24] you have a certain desire. You have a
[55:27] certain desire. Now hold it close. Now
[55:30] you have a certain craving. In this we
[55:32] grown not to be unclothed upon but to be
[55:35] clothed upon. We grown for something.
[55:38] The very the very thing your desire may
[55:41] be different from this person's desire.
[55:43] And that person may be different from
[55:44] this person's desire. And there may be
[55:46] some sitting here that have no desire
[55:48] whatsoever.
[55:50] I'd be real real distressed if I was
[55:54] sitting here under the sound of the
[55:57] gospel and had no desire for eternal
[56:00] things and no thought about what's
[56:03] beyond this short little brief life
[56:05] which is just a breath just a whisper.
[56:08] What is your life?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; It's even a vapor.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; You might feel young and strong and full
[56:14] of energy and vigor. Don't count on
[56:18] that. That body can just be gone like
[56:20] that. And furthermore, your life, your
[56:23] strength, you may be strong today, you
[56:24] could be struck down and sick tomorrow.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; People aren't as strong and athletic and
[56:31] all the rest of it and and and suddenly
[56:33] their health is gone.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Our breath is in God's hand. And if I
[56:38] had no desire, I would really be
[56:40] troubled. But you have a certain desire,
[56:43] a yearning, a craving. It is something
[56:45] that is it's it's constant. It's there
[56:48] all the time, sometimes greater than at
[56:50] other times. I'm so thankful for a
[56:53] message that tells you you have a body
[56:56] &gt;&gt; uh beyond the beyond this curtain of
[56:59] time
[57:00] &gt;&gt; that is is calling to you is calling to
[57:03] you.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; He said it's actually calling to you.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; So you have a desire. A lot of people
[57:09] just think, well, I have a desire. I
[57:10] have such a desire never seems to be
[57:12] met. Never seems to be satisfied. I have
[57:14] news for you. your your body
[57:18] &gt;&gt; on the other side that's under
[57:19] construction is calling for you. And the
[57:22] prophet of God says because you have
[57:25] that desire, God will call a man to the
[57:28] pullpit and preach something. Why? He'll
[57:32] preach a word because that word is going
[57:34] to change and transform you like the
[57:37] young man that's being changed from an
[57:39] awkward boy into a into a into a great
[57:42] surgeon of some kind by words which he
[57:45] reads, which he hears, the things that
[57:48] he learns and he puts into practice. But
[57:50] now that is just for time.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; That's just for this life. And he
[57:56] becomes a a professional man. But now
[57:58] here we come into a spiritual realm. We
[58:01] come into a whole spiritual thing. And
[58:03] what it is, friends, as I ended, I was
[58:06] so inspired last Sunday. It is the it is
[58:09] the breath of God. Jesus breathed upon
[58:11] the disciples said, "Receive ye the Holy
[58:14] Ghost."
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And then when Peter got up after he
[58:19] received the infilling of the Holy
[58:20] Spirit, he stood up and he said, and he
[58:23] cried out to the thousands that were
[58:25] gathered, "Now hear my words."
[58:28] Because now he was going to breathe upon
[58:31] that crowd. And when he finished
[58:33] breathing on them, they Bible says they
[58:36] were pricricked in their heart.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of breath
[58:42] &gt;&gt; we want breathed out upon us. They were
[58:45] pricricked in their heart and they cried
[58:47] out, "Men and brethren, what must we do
[58:50] to be saved?"
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Now, that had a spiritual effect
[58:55] &gt;&gt; upon them.
[58:57] And here comes a message. We can call it
[58:59] a message and this and that. And brother
[59:01] Brandham said this. Let's just put
[59:02] different words to it. God, I will say
[59:05] the son of man in this day breathed upon
[59:10] this generation
[59:12] with a breath of life from God.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Look at the change it made
[59:19] in you.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; What was it? Not just some books, not
[59:23] just some tapes. the breath of almighty
[59:26] God.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; And where did he breathe it? He breathed
[59:29] it into your nostrils and you become a
[59:31] living soul.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Transformed by the power of God.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; You find people down the street or
[59:38] wherever or maybe sitting right next to
[59:40] you and and read the same scripture,
[59:42] nothing happens.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But when the spirit of God, what is it?
[59:46] It's the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit of
[59:49] God. He is confirming that he's the
[59:52] author of the word that you have not
[59:54] just heard in your ears, but you
[59:56] believed in that channel to the soul.
[59:59] And you remember me speaking now, you're
[1:00:01] made of body, spirit, and soul. And
[1:00:04] there's five channels to the body, five
[1:00:06] channels to the spirit, and one channel
[1:00:08] to the soul. And in that channel, you
[1:00:10] will either believe or disbelieve. If
[1:00:13] you disbelieve, then the Holy Spirit
[1:00:16] does not come. There is no life and it's
[1:00:18] ineffective.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; It's invalidated
[1:00:21] because by unbelief
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; if you believe
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, help thou my unbelief.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I believe what I hear. I receive that
[1:00:33] word as a word that come from you. I
[1:00:36] receive that word as the breath of
[1:00:38] almighty God. No different than the
[1:00:40] breath that God breathed into Adam." Not
[1:00:42] one bit different.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The same breath.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; The same inspiration. And God breathes
[1:00:53] it into us in this generation. And a
[1:00:55] third pull, a final act. For those of
[1:00:57] you that know the message, the last
[1:00:59] part.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It was the last part.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; God capped off his creation by breathing
[1:01:05] into him.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; He became a living soul. Jesus finished
[1:01:09] his remarkable earthshaking ministry by
[1:01:13] breathing on the disciples and the
[1:01:15] church was born 50 days afterwards. And
[1:01:18] then and then in the revealing of the
[1:01:20] son of man, Jesus prophesying of our day
[1:01:23] and then and then he comes and reveals
[1:01:26] himself. Oh my, when I when I think of
[1:01:30] how God demonstrated himself and took
[1:01:33] control of the body realm by healings,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; marvelous healings,
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; oh, no wonder you're smiling, Sister
[1:01:40] Lana, we smile with you.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Lana's father we've been
[1:01:44] praying for here 84 years old uh taken
[1:01:49] and rushed to the hospital and laid
[1:01:52] there unconscious in a uh with with
[1:01:55] cardiac arrest with in a ventilator
[1:01:58] breathing for him and and all I could
[1:02:02] pray all I could pray I mean the man has
[1:02:04] lived a long life all I could pray she's
[1:02:08] claiming his soul he's praying for her
[1:02:11] soul she's spoken to him over the years
[1:02:14] for his soul. And excuse me, Sister Lan,
[1:02:17] I hope you don't mind because this is
[1:02:19] just this evening, just before I haven't
[1:02:21] even spoken to her. She spoke to my
[1:02:23] wife.
[1:02:25] And I expected, quite frankly, I expect
[1:02:28] her husb her her father at that age to
[1:02:30] to pass at any moment here. He's he's
[1:02:34] he's alert. Correct. They moved him out
[1:02:38] of ICU, moved him up into a regular
[1:02:40] ward.
[1:02:42] and and the whole thing has just
[1:02:44] dramatically changed.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And and in prayer, all I could say is uh
[1:02:50] Sister Lana,
[1:02:52] may God
[1:02:54] honor now and may your prayers
[1:02:58] may your prayers
[1:03:00] and your arms.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I think we can give a I think we can
[1:03:05] give a a bouquet once in a while. And
[1:03:09] our sister Lana has been a giving
[1:03:12] person.
[1:03:13] It doesn't matter whether it's food for
[1:03:15] the for someone or a big pot that or
[1:03:19] flowers or whatever more. And when there
[1:03:22] was a big need in Brazil, and I don't
[1:03:24] often do this, and I hope she won't be
[1:03:26] embarrassed, but when there was a need
[1:03:29] in Brazil for our our brother to go,
[1:03:33] brother Cesar, to go on the television,
[1:03:36] and and God knew he would only have a
[1:03:38] few months to do it, a little over one
[1:03:41] year. And both people are sitting in
[1:03:44] this audience right now. And I was met
[1:03:47] by three people and one came against me
[1:03:51] with a vengeance that we would support
[1:03:54] television. I said, "I'm not supporting
[1:03:55] television. I have no desire to be on
[1:03:58] television ever. I'd never said
[1:03:59] anything." I read a portion of a man's
[1:04:01] letter, a man who has a door, great door
[1:04:03] open. I just read the last paragraph of
[1:04:06] his letter
[1:04:08] and I was I was met with such a such a
[1:04:11] terrible spirit before I even got to the
[1:04:14] corner of this building in the hallway.
[1:04:18] And I was met also in the hallway by
[1:04:21] another person says, "God has spoken to
[1:04:23] me about that and I want to I'll be
[1:04:25] giving you checks for this amount." And
[1:04:28] when I got into my office, there was an
[1:04:31] envelope slid under the door. And I
[1:04:34] opened up the envelope and it happened
[1:04:36] to be from our sister Lana. And she
[1:04:38] says, "I feel to pledge X amount. I'll
[1:04:41] be giving like about $2,000 a month for
[1:04:45] the next six months." And the whole
[1:04:48] television bill for one year, $48,000
[1:04:52] was already paid before I even got to my
[1:04:55] office.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Wana, that's why I
[1:04:57] prayed.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; God has heard your prayers.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And has seen your arms. That's exactly
[1:05:04] what the angel said
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; in the scripture.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; This has been a giving church.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And I just tell you friends, God God is
[1:05:13] one that sees that.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; He has seen your sacrifice. He has seen
[1:05:17] your desire to get this message. Why?
[1:05:19] It's not just some books.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody reads those words. That's
[1:05:25] right.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit, are you with
[1:05:28] me?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God says, "I'm the
[1:05:32] author of those words."
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And I'll give life to them
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; when it enters into the soul realm.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give life to them.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And life breaks forth. And it's not you.
[1:05:45] It's not what your mother and father
[1:05:46] give you. It's what your heavenly parent
[1:05:48] gave you. God almighty give it to you.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't mind me taking and
[1:05:57] being a little bit personal.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But when the testing of his word is
[1:06:11] over, this body is subject to the word
[1:06:15] and waiting for the earnest change of
[1:06:17] the body. But when the testing of his
[1:06:20] word is over, then we are taken up to
[1:06:23] this body that was prepared for us
[1:06:26] before the foundation of the world. Do
[1:06:29] you folks believe that?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; It is the word there that we skipped to
[1:06:36] come right around there down here to be
[1:06:39] tempted and tested. Now listen, and I
[1:06:43] perhaps see this clearer than I could
[1:06:45] maybe state it to you, but you sit, you
[1:06:49] come into the house of God, you're
[1:06:51] perhaps at home and you have a certain
[1:06:54] craving, and it won't be perhaps the
[1:06:56] craving you had a month ago or 6 months
[1:06:59] ago, but you have a yearning and you're
[1:07:02] desiring uh uh something from God in
[1:07:05] your life. I want I want you to
[1:07:08] recognize and now
[1:07:11] is my firm belief that your eternal
[1:07:14] home, your theophony body is calling for
[1:07:19] that.
[1:07:21] And then if God has obedient servants to
[1:07:25] come behind the pulpit
[1:07:27] and you've experienced this, I'd be very
[1:07:29] disappointed if you haven't experienced
[1:07:31] this. you craved, you desired, and you
[1:07:34] came here
[1:07:36] and and sat down and the very word you
[1:07:40] needed came across the pull pit.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; How many have had that?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; I've had that.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; See this Bible here?
[1:07:53] I will have perhaps read one scripture,
[1:07:56] read a certain scripture stood out to
[1:07:58] me. And I thought, you know, I'm going
[1:08:02] to ponder that. I'm going to give myself
[1:08:03] to that. I believe the Lord wants me to
[1:08:05] speak on that. I'll come here and sit
[1:08:07] right in that chair and a man of God
[1:08:09] comes here to the pulpit, whichever the
[1:08:11] minister, and he'll open up the Bible
[1:08:13] and come right to that scripture and
[1:08:16] read that very scripture and begin to
[1:08:18] expound on it. Well, you can you can
[1:08:20] just well know what's going on in my
[1:08:22] life, in my heart. It's not just
[1:08:24] something, oh, isn't that wonderful? You
[1:08:26] know, I just thought about that. I just
[1:08:27] read about that or we just spoke about
[1:08:29] that and many of you could come to me
[1:08:30] and say that meeting after meeting and
[1:08:32] week after week. Let me say to you, it
[1:08:35] is your eternal home. It is your eternal
[1:08:38] home. It's your body that's calling for
[1:08:40] it. The same as you did in your mother's
[1:08:42] womb called for a certain thing. Your
[1:08:44] mother was obedient and went and got it
[1:08:46] and your daddy pinced perhaps and got
[1:08:48] the thing that you needed that you
[1:08:50] needed and you didn't know that you were
[1:08:52] getting it and you were receiving
[1:08:54] something from it at the sacrifice of
[1:08:56] others. And here we are today receiving
[1:08:59] a glorious message at the sacrifice of
[1:09:02] others and God breathing into you the
[1:09:05] breath of life. Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; How marvelous
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; this great plan of God.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; We'll never never figure God out
[1:09:15] completely.
[1:09:20] In order to stand temptation, you had to
[1:09:23] bypass the theophony. In other words, we
[1:09:26] didn't come like Adam came. That's
[1:09:29] right.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; He was created in the image of God. But
[1:09:32] you skipped around that and every person
[1:09:34] came through a natural birth in order to
[1:09:37] stand temptation. You had to bypass the
[1:09:40] theophony. You had to come down here in
[1:09:43] the flesh to be tempted by sin. We have
[1:09:46] to be tempted by this evil present evil
[1:09:49] age. Isn't it marvelous though that in
[1:09:51] the midst of that here you have a
[1:09:54] craving for God that God is going to
[1:09:57] send a messenger going to send a word to
[1:10:00] you. You're going to be directed by the
[1:10:02] Holy Spirit to a scripture. You may be
[1:10:04] directed by uh by the man of God coming
[1:10:07] behind the pulpit or one way or another
[1:10:10] God's going to minister that craving
[1:10:12] because you're craving not to be
[1:10:14] unclothed but to be clothed upon.
[1:10:18] That craving is calling that that word
[1:10:21] body is calling. In other words, uh when
[1:10:26] when God fore orained you, you believe
[1:10:28] you're fore orained. When God fore
[1:10:30] orained you to live here at this season,
[1:10:35] at this time in history, God also God
[1:10:40] also left part of this word which needed
[1:10:44] to be fulfilled and manifested.
[1:10:47] There was a bride to be manifested. Had
[1:10:50] to be manifested. She's spoken of here
[1:10:52] in the scripture. There's types of her
[1:10:54] all through the Old Testament. And it's
[1:10:56] spoken of her and she appears in the
[1:10:58] book of Revelation. It's called the
[1:11:00] bride of Jesus Christ and it's called
[1:11:02] the wife of the lamb.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus, the most eligible bachelor that
[1:11:09] ever came to the earth, ever walked on
[1:11:12] the earth, never took a wife in his
[1:11:14] human existence, but he does now.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I read something very interesting just
[1:11:22] this last week speaking about Israel
[1:11:25] because you know Israel is spending now
[1:11:27] celebrating 60 years their 60th
[1:11:30] anniversary
[1:11:31] and they talked about the Jews coming
[1:11:34] years ago many many years ago when it
[1:11:37] was uh other people of other lands and
[1:11:40] other other nations were inhabiting
[1:11:42] Israel and they said that when those
[1:11:44] first people arrived there they found
[1:11:47] that it that she was married to another
[1:11:50] man. I thought that was very
[1:11:52] interesting. They found that their bride
[1:11:54] was married to another man.
[1:11:57] Their nation was married united to
[1:12:00] another people. It isn't that amazing
[1:12:03] that they use that kind of language.
[1:12:05] That's such a that's almost message
[1:12:07] language.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It's just so perfect with the scripture.
[1:12:14] Amen. But our Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:12:17] comes and take a a wife to himself. And
[1:12:21] you've come here now to stand temptation
[1:12:25] and you have to bypass that theophony.
[1:12:28] And brother Brandham calls it your word
[1:12:31] your your word body. Your word body.
[1:12:36] When God sent you here,
[1:12:39] your portion is not the next person's
[1:12:41] portion,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; and my portion is not yours, and yours
[1:12:45] isn't mine. You want to thank God for
[1:12:46] that?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Seriously.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Isaac.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; But you have a portion.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; What is it? Just allow me to belabor the
[1:13:03] point. A word portion. I'm just putting
[1:13:06] some thoughts that brother Benham left
[1:13:08] us. He said that's your word body
[1:13:13] and you sit here, you come in contact
[1:13:17] and you have a craving for the word.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; That's your word body and God sent you.
[1:13:25] You bypass that to come here to be
[1:13:28] tempted and tested.
[1:13:31] What is the temptation? What is the what
[1:13:33] is the testing all about? It is because
[1:13:36] one power and that's the power of Satan
[1:13:39] is very determined to throw every
[1:13:41] obstacle in front of you so that you
[1:13:44] will not fulfill your course.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's the obstacle. But God is
[1:13:50] determined that you shall hear the right
[1:13:52] word, that you shall surrender yourself
[1:13:55] to the right word, and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:57] will empower you.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Energize you
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; because it's your body that's calling to
[1:14:03] you.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And so I want to try and encourage you
[1:14:10] just now, regardless of the temptation
[1:14:13] that we're called to go through, it also
[1:14:16] has been ordained that it's a glorious
[1:14:19] church
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; without spot,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; without wrinkle or any such thing.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; How powerful is this breath of God?
[1:14:34] I was touched. I'm touched by
[1:14:37] things that are very, very real.
[1:14:41] And I find that brother Brandham, you
[1:14:43] know, people think maybe he tells a long
[1:14:45] story. It's not that. But he encounters
[1:14:48] a woman that's lived a very, very
[1:14:51] unclean life.
[1:14:56] And it's called from that time in the
[1:14:58] message from that time.
[1:15:01] And he says,
[1:15:04] I said, "A lovely," I'm breaking into
[1:15:06] their conversation.
[1:15:08] He's speaking to her and I said, "A
[1:15:12] lovely young woman like you. Don't you
[1:15:15] desire to be married and have babies
[1:15:17] like all mothers do and so forth." And
[1:15:20] she said, "I would love to, sir, but
[1:15:24] look at me. What could I offer anyone?"
[1:15:28] And I said, 'You've got one thing you
[1:15:30] could offer.' And she said, 'What is
[1:15:32] that?'
[1:15:34] And I said, 'Your soul to Jesus Christ.'
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Sir, he wouldn't receive
[1:15:40] it." I said, "Oh, yes, he will."
[1:15:44] And said, "How do you know that he
[1:15:46] would? I've tried."
[1:15:49] And I said, "Yes, you're just turning
[1:15:52] over pages, but you really but you
[1:15:55] really come to him." And she said, "What
[1:15:58] could he do with me?" I said, "Make a
[1:16:01] lady out of you." She said, "Not me. I'm
[1:16:06] too far gone." Now, listen, friends,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; you might consider me off
[1:16:12] at the top, but this next paragraph, I
[1:16:15] believe, is the breath of God to this
[1:16:18] woman. Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I said
[1:16:24] he can take you back
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; to the time when you was a virgin
[1:16:30] innocent girl. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:34] is sufficient and powerful to transform
[1:16:39] the violent sinner to the bloodwash
[1:16:42] saint guiltless before God. Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Where's she going to hear that?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Where's the textbook? She's going to
[1:16:51] hear that.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Who's going to read that to her?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; And if she believes that, that's exactly
[1:16:57] what would happen to her.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Because God's prepared to stand behind
[1:17:02] that, take the vilest, the most unclean,
[1:17:06] and even in your state, and take you
[1:17:08] back and turn you back into a virgin.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Now, if God would do that,
[1:17:14] How much more he take the bride of Jesus
[1:17:18] Christ and blot out every sin, erase
[1:17:22] every transgression.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "I know I've been
[1:17:26] born in sin and shaped in iniquity." I
[1:17:28] have a word for you.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And there has been a breath that God has
[1:17:33] breathed into this generation.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And he's saying that he's saying to you
[1:17:40] uh that you will be made a living soul.
[1:17:43] Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Not someone just forgiven, but someone
[1:17:47] that is purified and taken back to your
[1:17:51] sinless estate.
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; There's not a man or a woman, but what
[1:18:01] Satan exercises and uses
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; over time
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; in the channel of them in memory. There
[1:18:09] isn't a person here, not a person that
[1:18:12] has things that you say, "I wish I had
[1:18:14] never encountered that. I wish I had
[1:18:16] never done that. I wish I had never fell
[1:18:18] into that." I got news for you.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; God is breathing
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; upon this generation.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; God has breathed upon it
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; with a breath.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I know a power that'll take you back and
[1:18:36] make you sinless. Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said he said you never
[1:18:40] did it in the first place.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Notice the emphasis is on the first
[1:18:45] place. In the first place, you never did
[1:18:48] it.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of gospel I believe.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of message that we
[1:18:56] preach.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Sinless before God.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we are without
[1:19:04] reproach
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; in his sight. Yes,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; maybe not our neighbor's sight, but in
[1:19:10] his sight, he looks upon the bride of
[1:19:12] Jesus Christ, says, "You're sinless.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't just forgive you. I took you
[1:19:18] back to your sinless state. That's how I
[1:19:22] saw you. That's how I envisioned you.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what I've done." And the
[1:19:27] Bible says, "We are the house of God. We
[1:19:30] are God's house. We are God's building."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; There isn't a man. There isn't a school.
[1:19:35] There isn't a theology. There isn't a
[1:19:37] church in the world that can turn you
[1:19:38] into that. But only the breath of God
[1:19:41] alone. And what is the breath of God?
[1:19:43] Thus saith the Lord.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You think he was just telling this
[1:19:50] little lady sick? Sick of her own life.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Nobody would have me. Which man would
[1:19:56] have me? I have nothing to offer. I'm a
[1:19:59] rich.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the violist. I have nothing to offer
[1:20:03] anybody. God wouldn't even take me. Yes,
[1:20:06] he will. He won't only take you. He'll
[1:20:09] take you back to the beginning.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; He'll take you back the way he pictured
[1:20:12] you in your in his mind.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's going to bring forth
[1:20:17] what he had in his mind. He's the great
[1:20:20] He's the great sculptor.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's building the
[1:20:23] masterpiece.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And nobody can change his plan.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it forth
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; till he look on it and say, "It's good.
[1:20:33] It's very, very good.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He's looking on it. He's saying, "It's
[1:20:38] perfect.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; It's my handywork.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; I did it.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; I built it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I purified it.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; I paid the price.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Newly created blood of almighty God.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Purchased our redemption.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Not half of it, all of it.
[1:21:01] and made you sinless and guiltless
[1:21:03] before God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and it's been confirmed in this time.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You can't believe it. You can't
[1:21:10] disbelieve the voice of God and come to
[1:21:12] that kind of state.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But if you say in your heart tonight, I
[1:21:16] believe it.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; I believe it with everything that's in
[1:21:19] me.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And if there's something in you that's
[1:21:23] calling,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; you might even be here.
[1:21:29] never heard these things before, but
[1:21:32] there's something in you that's calling.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You know, there's people who walk the
[1:21:36] streets. There's people who good people,
[1:21:40] but they they have no hope. They have no
[1:21:44] place. They have no rel place to let off
[1:21:46] the pressure. They're just searching. I
[1:21:48] run into them regularly. So do you.
[1:21:52] But if there's something they're
[1:21:53] calling, that means there's something
[1:21:55] for you.
[1:21:57] I believe that with all my heart.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world,
[1:22:18] his name's on the lamb's book of life.
[1:22:20] Now he speaks about Christ.
[1:22:23] Then from that he became the word.
[1:22:26] Christ became the word. The theophony
[1:22:31] that could appear disappear. A theophony
[1:22:35] can appear and disappear.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And then he became flesh.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Now he appeared in a theophony to our
[1:22:47] father of the faith Abraham. Yes sir. So
[1:22:49] he appeared as a theophony then.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Then he came and became flesh. The word
[1:22:58] became flesh. Follow this closely. In a
[1:23:01] virgin born,
[1:23:04] not through a sexual relationship. In a
[1:23:06] virginborn son called Jesus Christ
[1:23:11] in the end time.
[1:23:14] And back here he met Abraham in a
[1:23:17] Theophony. Here he comes to the earth in
[1:23:21] the flesh to take the body to Calvary as
[1:23:24] a sacrifice.
[1:23:26] In the end time, the same son of man,
[1:23:29] the same Lord Jesus Christ, now uses a
[1:23:32] redeemed vessel
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and brings it to full adoption to
[1:23:37] demonstrate before a generation of
[1:23:39] people and to be a mouthpiece for God so
[1:23:43] that he can take that portion of the
[1:23:45] book that has still been sealed and
[1:23:48] breathe it out. It needed to be breathed
[1:23:52] out. We say, "Well, the seven seals."
[1:23:55] Listen, it's not just some messages. The
[1:23:57] word needed to be breathed out.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; The breath the breath of those words
[1:24:04] needed to be breathed out upon the
[1:24:06] people to bring the final transformation
[1:24:10] to the people to prepare us for what is
[1:24:13] coming. Now,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; we expect the change of the body. I can
[1:24:17] tell you any change of the body, any
[1:24:20] rapture experience is involved in that
[1:24:24] breath of God.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; He says he could appear, disappear, and
[1:24:35] then he became flesh and returned back
[1:24:37] again, resurrected that same body in a
[1:24:41] glorified condition. But you bypassed
[1:24:44] the theophony and became flesh man to be
[1:24:48] tempted by sin. And then if this earthly
[1:24:52] tabernacle is dissolved, quoting Paul's
[1:24:56] words, we have another already waiting.
[1:24:59] We have not yet. We have not yet the
[1:25:02] bodies. But when this body receives the
[1:25:05] spirit of God, the immortal life inside
[1:25:09] of you, it throws this body, this
[1:25:12] earthly tabernacle in subjection to God.
[1:25:16] And then when you become subject to the
[1:25:20] spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:25:23] subject to that spirit.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? And that
[1:25:27] spirit is nothing in the world but this
[1:25:30] seed word made manifest or quickened
[1:25:34] made alive. Tell you what, you need to
[1:25:36] chew that last two lines for a while.
[1:25:39] And that and that spirit is nothing in
[1:25:41] the world but this seed word
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; made manifest or quickened made alive.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; What? Why? How? How can be quickened?
[1:25:51] We're quickened by the breath of God.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And when the Bible said, "Don't do
[1:26:00] this," that body quickly turns to it.
[1:26:04] There's no question. And what is it?
[1:26:06] It's the earnest of the resurrection.
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; So now you've received the spirit upon
[1:26:16] that word and you're you have craving
[1:26:19] and you're groaning and you're yearning
[1:26:21] and you're desiring. Not just those are
[1:26:24] not just natural desires. Your eternal
[1:26:26] home is calling for that. That's a word
[1:26:29] home and you're craving for the word.
[1:26:32] And God sends a man behind the pullpit
[1:26:34] to preach the very word you're craving.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It's your eternal home.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And then because the Holy Spirit has
[1:26:48] control of the individual, they they
[1:26:51] turn quickly in obedience.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Have you experienced that?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I have a breath of God for you.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Says you have the earnest
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; That ought to turn somebody loose.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; You mean I've got the down payment of
[1:27:09] the resurrection? You have it.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; You've desired. You crave certain things
[1:27:14] and God spoke to you. God sent the word
[1:27:17] that you needed that you were craving
[1:27:19] and when you heard it, it changed you
[1:27:21] immediately. That is the down payment of
[1:27:24] the resurrection.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; You have the down payment.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; You know when you have a down payment on
[1:27:32] something,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; down payment on a piece of property or
[1:27:35] down payment on an automobile or
[1:27:36] something, somebody give you a down
[1:27:38] payment. Say, "My car is for sale. My
[1:27:40] pickup's for sale." Okay, fine. Oh, I
[1:27:44] just wish I could sell this thing. Oh,
[1:27:46] and you're just all distressed over it.
[1:27:48] Just wish I could sell it. And somebody
[1:27:50] comes along says, "Yeah, that's that's a
[1:27:52] nice pickup." Yeah. Yeah, it's a great
[1:27:55] pickup. It just, you know,
[1:27:57] I think I'll buy that. Okay. Here, I'll
[1:28:02] I'll give you $500 down. You take that
[1:28:05] $500.
[1:28:07] You know the heaviness that you had
[1:28:09] earlier in the day, it's just gone.
[1:28:13] It's just gone. You know, you know that
[1:28:16] that downcast
[1:28:19] look on your face. It's gone. It's
[1:28:20] replaced with a smile. Actually changed
[1:28:23] the whole physical features. Maybe your
[1:28:25] friends or your parents or your or wife
[1:28:27] or husband says, "What happened?" Oh, I
[1:28:30] I sold the truck. You did? How do you
[1:28:33] know? Well, is it is it really sold?
[1:28:35] Yes, sir. I got I got the down payment
[1:28:38] right here. Yes, it's all sold. It's a
[1:28:41] done deal.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; You feel real good about it because you
[1:28:44] got the earnest. Don't ever forget that
[1:28:47] craving that's within you.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; And then the obedience to the Holy
[1:28:51] Spirit speaking you and turning just
[1:28:53] that degree I turned.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I heard the voice. I turned. It spoke to
[1:28:59] me. And I begin to obey and move in that
[1:29:02] direction. Not obeying a creed. not
[1:29:04] obeying a tradition. They can make all
[1:29:06] kinds of changes. You can go and join a
[1:29:09] club and it'll make all kinds of
[1:29:10] changes. Not that kind of a change, but
[1:29:12] the Holy Spirit,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; something within you and it indexed you
[1:29:17] around and has kept moving you, indexing
[1:29:20] you, changing you. Why? Your eternal
[1:29:22] home is calling for it. And the fact,
[1:29:24] and now prophet gives you this glorious
[1:29:26] truth. The fact that you turn that
[1:29:28] little bit
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; is the down payment. Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You've got the resurrection.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; You've got the down payment. You've got
[1:29:37] the resurrection.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good news?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good enough to come to church
[1:29:44] on Wednesday night to hear? I just going
[1:29:46] to go home tonight. I got the down
[1:29:49] payment of the resurrection.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; has witnessed it.
[1:30:01] This body will be raised up again
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; because it's already started.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I know if you folks want to get excited,
[1:30:10] but I'm getting excited.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; It's already started. Why? Because you
[1:30:14] heard it. The Holy Spirit did something.
[1:30:17] You moved. It changed you. Amen.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; It was once subject to sin and mire and
[1:30:29] corruption, but now it's got the
[1:30:31] earnest. It's turned heavenly. Now
[1:30:33] that's the earnest that you're going in
[1:30:36] the rapture. It's the earnest. So you
[1:30:39] don't only have the down payment of the
[1:30:40] resurrection. If you go that way, you
[1:30:42] got the down payment of the rapture.
[1:30:45] Have the down payment. Hello folks
[1:30:48] sitting here this evening. Wednesday
[1:30:49] night. I'm not preaching some little
[1:30:52] tale to you. I'm telling you what a
[1:30:54] prophet messenger has said. And if he
[1:30:56] was standing here, he couldn't say
[1:30:57] anything else. I'm giving I'm giving
[1:30:59] breath to his words.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And I believe that his words, God gave
[1:31:04] him breath
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; so he could say that you have the
[1:31:09] earnest the down payment of the rapture
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; within you.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] Not to just give you a good feeling.
[1:31:19] That's the breath of God.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That's God's promise. In other words,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; a sick person laying, dying.
[1:31:34] I don't know what sister Lana has said
[1:31:36] in prayer, but I believe that her
[1:31:39] prayers on behalf of her father have
[1:31:43] been the breath of God
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; to that man's soul.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; And if he slipped away tomorrow,
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; it'll have been God that brought him to
[1:31:54] his awareness
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and consciousness. Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And we said today, Sister Lana, that God
[1:32:01] has given you this time and given him
[1:32:03] that reprieve. Whatever it is, if God
[1:32:05] raised him to good health, fine. But if
[1:32:08] you shall slip away, God gave you this
[1:32:11] time.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Breath of God. I believe in the breath
[1:32:15] of God more. I've never seen it in I've
[1:32:18] never seen it in my entire life like I
[1:32:20] see it now.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Never thought of it before in that
[1:32:25] light. Never. never used the term a
[1:32:28] third pull breath.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; A resurrection breath.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It had to happen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; It had to take place.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And God in his program ordained that you
[1:32:44] would live at this time. Other than
[1:32:46] that, if you consider yourself an
[1:32:48] accident or just a birth through your
[1:32:51] mother and father coming together,
[1:32:52] you're not getting the message. You're
[1:32:53] not getting God's word. God allotted you
[1:32:56] to come to this generation. God ordained
[1:32:59] that you would hear the words that
[1:33:01] you've heard. God has ordained that you
[1:33:03] would sit in this service tonight. And
[1:33:05] God's program is that something that is
[1:33:08] being spoken
[1:33:10] answers to the groaning,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; the desire that's within.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever heard Excuse
[1:33:21] me. I'm just going to come to an end in
[1:33:22] just a few minutes because I don't want
[1:33:24] to be long now.
[1:33:27] But I heard a little phrase a long time
[1:33:29] ago and and probably it's a common
[1:33:30] phrase says uh you know listen to your
[1:33:33] pain,
[1:33:36] listen to your body
[1:33:38] and God has given me wonderful wonderful
[1:33:40] health all my life
[1:33:44] but I've remembered those little phrases
[1:33:48] and sometimes
[1:33:50] uh you know you're just not feeling good
[1:33:54] just not feeling good at all. That's
[1:33:56] when the devil comes and tells you,
[1:33:58] "You're getting sick."
[1:34:00] You
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; ever heard that?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; He He He has the same phrases all the
[1:34:05] time. He plays on them all the time.
[1:34:06] You're getting sick.
[1:34:10] You're getting the flu.
[1:34:14] And uh I get feelings, so I don't feel
[1:34:16] good.
[1:34:18] And I go
[1:34:20] and I open the fridge door and I stand
[1:34:24] there and I stare at everything in the
[1:34:25] fridge.
[1:34:28] And I have some kind of a craving, but I
[1:34:31] haven't identified it.
[1:34:34] And I'll be standing and staring at that
[1:34:36] fridge and uh I just I'm I'm trying to
[1:34:39] listen to my body. I'm trying to listen
[1:34:41] to what I'm craving for, I'm desiring.
[1:34:44] And sometime
[1:34:47] there it is. Buttermilk. I want some
[1:34:50] buttermilk. When's the last time I drank
[1:34:53] buttermilk? I can't even remember.
[1:34:55] It's so many years ago. But you're
[1:34:57] craving for something and finally you
[1:34:59] identify it. Say that's it. I just need
[1:35:03] that. Or I'll or I'll say something to
[1:35:05] my wife. I I'm just craving a certain
[1:35:07] something and and maybe you can make it
[1:35:09] up for me and that's what I feel like
[1:35:11] having. Don't want anything else. Don't
[1:35:12] want anything else. make me some of
[1:35:14] this. You know, your system's craving
[1:35:16] for it, but you know, you can't hardly
[1:35:19] identify it. And I said that for this
[1:35:22] reason. I'm coming to a close now. Many
[1:35:25] times, you know, you're busy with life,
[1:35:29] you're working, you're occupied, you're
[1:35:32] under pressure. But if you could just
[1:35:35] get all that debris away,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; you'll find that down inside is a
[1:35:41] certain craving. You know what it is?
[1:35:44] God's trying to break through that
[1:35:46] curtain of time and just on the other
[1:35:49] side and right beside you
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; is a word body. Now, now I'm not
[1:35:56] thinking of a word body as like I am
[1:35:58] here with hands and feet and so on. You
[1:36:01] know, my life
[1:36:03] uh my life is is involves a whole lot
[1:36:08] more than just this frame.
[1:36:12] It involves those that are close to me.
[1:36:14] It involves those that I fellowship
[1:36:15] with. It involves a whole environment.
[1:36:20] Your word body, what God has promised
[1:36:22] you is not 10 toes and 10 fingers and
[1:36:26] say, "Oh, it's a wonderful theophony.
[1:36:28] You know, you're going to be so much
[1:36:29] younger. You're going to be so handsome.
[1:36:31] You're going to be so beautiful." That's
[1:36:33] not it entirely. Sure, I'm sure you're
[1:36:36] going to have a dwelling place, but it's
[1:36:38] far beyond that. In that realm, you'll
[1:36:41] know as you're known. You'll have you'll
[1:36:44] have completely uninhibited
[1:36:47] fellowship.
[1:36:49] You'll have uh you'll have experienced
[1:36:51] relationships like you never never could
[1:36:54] because this flesh stands in the way.
[1:36:57] This mouth can't say it right. This mind
[1:37:01] has plagued a good thought, a bad
[1:37:03] thought, a suspicious thought, a
[1:37:04] critical thought, a wonderful thought,
[1:37:06] all joy, all just come plaging. You
[1:37:08] won't have any of that there.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Your word body is a whole environment.
[1:37:15] It's a whole living atmosphere.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Look, when brother
[1:37:20] Brandham went beyond the curtain of
[1:37:22] time, what's the first thing? What's the
[1:37:25] first thing he said? He saw millions of
[1:37:26] people. Yeah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's describing. And to
[1:37:30] come running and to come embracing our
[1:37:33] brother and he's hearing our brother,
[1:37:35] our precious brother. That whole
[1:37:37] experience is part of what what you're
[1:37:40] being called to.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I thought of the children in their
[1:37:50] little song. Uh uh some of the Sunday
[1:37:53] school children perhaps remember it.
[1:37:56] God's still working on me.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; You remember that one?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; God's still working on me, too.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; This world is not our home.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just read this last couple.
[1:38:15] A sick person laying dying. Nothing left
[1:38:17] but death. That's all. That's all can
[1:38:21] happen. I've seen the shadows of people
[1:38:24] done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis
[1:38:28] and see them persons a little while a
[1:38:31] little while after that perfectly normal
[1:38:34] and strong. If there is no divine
[1:38:37] healing then there's no resurrection
[1:38:40] because divine healing is the earnest of
[1:38:42] the resurrection.
[1:38:46] How many were
[1:38:48] really touched by brother Toby and such
[1:38:50] Rebecca's testimony?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous to have a doctor say
[1:38:58] the chromosome's back?
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Where'd it go?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know. My family doctor
[1:39:08] had to tell my wife
[1:39:11] that a growth that she had,
[1:39:15] we're going to operate
[1:39:17] and remove this growth.
[1:39:20] She probably won't like me saying this
[1:39:23] cuz she's very private person, but I
[1:39:25] want to give glory to God.
[1:39:28] And they did.
[1:39:31] And he came to her bedside.
[1:39:34] the next morning
[1:39:37] and he said, "We couldn't find it."
[1:39:42] She said, "Where did it go?"
[1:39:45] He said, "We don't know."
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Praise God."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:03] That's what I believe.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Our dear loving Lord Jesus.
[1:40:15] We just don't know how to adequately
[1:40:17] express you. We've spent this evening
[1:40:20] here.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And the dear people have come. They've
[1:40:23] listened attentively. And I pray Lord,
[1:40:26] you will reward them. I can't, but I
[1:40:29] know that you will. Reward them with
[1:40:31] something that will remain branded upon
[1:40:34] their hearts and minds. Place it down
[1:40:37] into their soul. Oh God, give them a
[1:40:40] jubilee. I pray. Father, tonight I want
[1:40:43] to pray for brother Jim Douly's sister.
[1:40:47] She's one of these
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; at the last stages of cancer. Oh God,
[1:40:53] how needy she is right now, Lord. How
[1:40:56] needy she is. is and we do not know the
[1:40:58] state of her soul but as our brother Jim
[1:41:01] will see her we believe very soon the
[1:41:04] next day or two I pray that you'll go
[1:41:06] with him we're praying as a congregation
[1:41:09] you'll send and and infuse him with the
[1:41:12] Holy Spirit infuse him with a divine
[1:41:15] presence a presence for in your presence
[1:41:18] the supernatural is happening oh God is
[1:41:22] happening and we would not try to tell
[1:41:25] you what to do or how to do it or when
[1:41:27] to do it. But we pray above all things
[1:41:29] that you'll capture her soul, Lord. And
[1:41:32] I pray, oh God, you'll redeem her and
[1:41:34] bring her back. And hear the prayers of
[1:41:37] this righteous man. Oh God, hear the
[1:41:40] fervent prayers of this family on behalf
[1:41:43] of Brother Jim Douly's sister. And we
[1:41:46] want to remember another one tonight,
[1:41:47] Lord, of Brother Nathaniel Johnson's
[1:41:50] wife in Tucson, Sister Margaret, I
[1:41:52] believe her name is. Oh, God. And Sister
[1:41:56] Lorie Snow has is so burdened for her.
[1:41:59] It's like second parents to her and Lord
[1:42:02] of family that they've been together all
[1:42:04] of these years. And to see this woman
[1:42:07] has yet many years of life before her. I
[1:42:10] pray, oh God, that you would reach down
[1:42:12] into into her very body, into the into
[1:42:16] the very places that need virtue and let
[1:42:19] your virtue cause the cancer cells to
[1:42:23] die. For your prophet said nothing would
[1:42:25] stand before his prayers, not even
[1:42:28] cancer, identifying that demon. We
[1:42:31] rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:34] God, drive it from her body. I pray
[1:42:36] raise her up, Lord. And I pray you'll
[1:42:39] bring a bring a a a fountain of
[1:42:41] encouragement to our brother Nathaniel.
[1:42:43] Lord, pray you'll lift him up. This son
[1:42:46] of God, this minister of the gospel, oh
[1:42:49] Lord, come and bear his burden, I pray.
[1:42:53] And to come and attend to them this
[1:42:55] evening, I ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:42:57] And for those that enjoy good health, we
[1:43:00] want to thank you for we thank you for
[1:43:02] your word that has been brought to us.
[1:43:05] We thank you for your your message,
[1:43:07] Lord. and the messenger and to allow us
[1:43:10] to see the things that we see. I pray
[1:43:13] dear Lord you'll just receive our
[1:43:16] thanksgiving from the depths of our
[1:43:17] heart in Jesus Christ's name. We want to
[1:43:20] glorify you
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; and we do glorify you. There's none like
[1:43:25] you. There's none like you. Be praised
[1:43:28] amongst us. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:43:31] name.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing I can think of,
[1:43:36] Linda, is my This world is not my home.
[1:43:42] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[1:43:47] passing through. My treasures are laid
[1:43:51] out somewhere beyond the
[1:43:55] angels me from heaven's open door. And I
[1:44:01] can't feel at home in this world
[1:44:05] anymore.
[1:44:10] I have no friend like you and a heaven's
[1:44:14] not my home.
[1:44:17] What will I do? The angels back to me
[1:44:22] from heaven's open door and I can't see
[1:44:27] my heart in this world anymore.
[1:44:33] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[1:44:37] thing I know. I fix it up with Jesus
[1:44:42] many years ago.
[1:44:45] I know you see me through though I weak
[1:44:49] and poor and I can't
[1:44:53] in this world anymore.
[1:44:57] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[1:45:01] you. And if heaven stop my home, then
[1:45:06] what will I do? The angels said to me,
[1:45:11] my heavens open door and I can't be left
[1:45:17] in this world anymore.
[1:45:22] Just over in glory land. We live
[1:45:26] eternally.
[1:45:28] The saints on every hand are shining
[1:45:32] victory
[1:45:37] back from heaven shore and I can't feel
[1:45:41] at all.
[1:45:45] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[1:45:50] you. And if heaven is not my home, then
[1:45:55] what would I do? The angels beckon me.
[1:46:00] Heaven's open door and I can't feel at
[1:46:05] home in this world anymore.
[1:46:09] I want to ask this congregation.
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:13] Don't feel embarrassed if you don't
[1:46:14] raise your hand. I'm not asking for a
[1:46:16] show of hands as such. I'd like to know
[1:46:19] in this congregation,
[1:46:21] how many are there that have someone
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:28] that
[1:46:30] not just weighs upon your heart, but
[1:46:32] someone who's constantly constantly on
[1:46:36] your heart that you know is not saved,
[1:46:40] not prepared to go. And you're praying
[1:46:42] for them. You're holding them. You've
[1:46:44] held them for a long time and you
[1:46:46] continue to hold them before God. How
[1:46:49] many are there?
[1:46:52] Look how many men and women there are.
[1:46:54] Look how many souls there are.
[1:46:59] Perhaps someone that you're mention. And
[1:47:03] even if you don't mention, you're
[1:47:04] holding it before God. You're just
[1:47:05] praying for them all the time.
[1:47:09] Don't you think for a moment that our
[1:47:11] Lord Jesus very pleased for that?
[1:47:14] That you're holding him
[1:47:17] before him.
[1:47:19] God saw that.
[1:47:22] God saw that.
[1:47:27] Wonderful.
[1:47:29] This is the body of Christ here on
[1:47:32] earth.
[1:47:35] were holding some before the kingdom of
[1:47:38] God.
[1:47:40] I want to take a step further.
[1:47:46] I'm thinking of one right now.
[1:47:50] We pray for him all the time.
[1:47:53] I'm going to take another step. I
[1:47:56] believe I'm going to walk
[1:47:59] on the shores and the hills of glory
[1:48:02] with that individual. I'm praying with
[1:48:05] you want to take that step of faith
[1:48:07] also.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This isn't excitement.
[1:48:13] This is having some faith in the promise
[1:48:15] of God.
[1:48:17] He has spoken it and now we are going to
[1:48:20] believe it and hold fast to it. Father,
[1:48:23] you see these hands,
[1:48:25] not for ourselves, but we have held
[1:48:27] these before you. We've held these
[1:48:30] souls, each one worth 10,000 worlds. We
[1:48:35] hold them before you, oh God. We bear
[1:48:38] them before you, and we announce to
[1:48:41] Satan into his kingdom of darkness that
[1:48:44] we do not know at what moment, but he
[1:48:46] must turn them loose. The price of the
[1:48:50] blood of Jesus Christ has already been
[1:48:52] paid. Their souls have been purchased.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed word has been
[1:49:03] spoken.
[1:49:05] The head of the serpent has been
[1:49:08] crushed.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And the seed of the woman has come.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you've presented
[1:49:14] yourself in our time. Now here you're
[1:49:18] present now to fulfill the word in Jesus
[1:49:22] Christ's name. May they be loosed. Oh
[1:49:24] God, the ones that are being held and
[1:49:27] the hands that have been raised. Oh
[1:49:29] Lord, save these sons, these daughters,
[1:49:33] these fathers and mothers, and these
[1:49:35] children. Oh God, in the name of Jesus
[1:49:38] Christ, let this congregation, Lord,
[1:49:40] have a faith that's been loosed. loosed
[1:49:43] by the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:49:48] this enemy, this enemy, these habits
[1:49:52] that hold them or control them. It may
[1:49:56] be drugs, it may be alcohol.
[1:49:58] It could be any other habit of life, but
[1:50:00] those are only attributes of the
[1:50:02] unbelief. Bring their souls to believe.
[1:50:05] I pray
[1:50:07] cause their soul to be pricricked.
[1:50:11] Holy Spirit, penetrate, I pray, the very
[1:50:14] room that they're in. They may be
[1:50:15] sitting watching television. Let them
[1:50:17] become disinterested.
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] Let sleep leave their eyes. Oh God, may
[1:50:25] they toss and turn and may they be
[1:50:28] reminded that their soul hangs over hell
[1:50:31] and darkness. Oh God,
[1:50:34] Lord,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; and that they'll turn and call upon the
[1:50:36] name of the Lord.
[1:50:39] And may something that has been spoken
[1:50:41] to them come to their remembrance now.
[1:50:44] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[1:50:47] we thank you for it. Thank you for
[1:50:50] hearing us now, Lord.
[1:50:53] And we will go treasuring their promise
[1:50:56] that you've given us.
[1:50:58] We ask you to bless this congregation,
[1:51:00] Lord, and dismiss us with abundant
[1:51:03] grace. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:51:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:11] Amazing

[1:51:19] the sound.

[1:52:46] You've encouraged me by being here by
[1:52:48] saying amen, hallelujah, and God bless
[1:52:51] you is the only thing I can say. God
[1:52:53] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[1:52:55] name.
[1:52:57] Amen. God bless you.
[1:53:04] [Music]
