[28:37] introduce to you brother David and he's
[28:40] going to come and minister to us he's
[28:43] been a very special friend over the
[28:45] years I've had the privilege to be in
[28:48] Switzerland where people from brothers
[28:50] and sisters from around the world
[28:52] actually have gathered to to be together
[28:56] to hear the word of God and Without
[28:59] Borders and it's been marvelous and the
[29:02] words that had been spoken by men of God
[29:05] it had been tremendously life impacting
[29:08] and there had to be young men that God
[29:11] raised up to make an event take place a
[29:14] lot of people say well I'd like to do
[29:16] something and it's always a light to do
[29:18] but never do but then they're men that
[29:21] actually like to do something and they
[29:23] do it and brother brother Bisco will be
[29:27] coming to say maybe a few words but
[29:29] brother Daniel : Brenner and brother
[29:31] David Maher they have worked together
[29:33] over these years now many years and
[29:36] people from all over the world have
[29:38] travelled to be in Switzerland and so
[29:40] we're bringing a little bit of that here
[29:42] this morning and I'm expecting a
[29:45] wonderful wonderful move of the word
[29:48] within our lives seeing what God's done
[29:50] in Switzerland he's doing here he's
[29:53] doing it around the world and we feel
[29:56] very privileged to have you here brother
[29:57] David and God bless you he blessed us at
[30:00] camp last year took both morning
[30:02] services and we were immensely
[30:05] strengthened in the Lord and this
[30:07] morning I know you will be blessed so
[30:09] I'm just gonna ask brother ed if you
[30:12] would just come give a greeting
[30:17] thank you while you're still standing I
[30:19] just want to I want to welcome each of
[30:25] you and I want you to know that this
[30:29] brother behind my brother David Meyer we
[30:33] all have different gifts his is a gift
[30:36] of pressure and because of that we have
[30:42] gone that's why one day say to this
[30:44] congregation
[30:45] that's why we've gone
[30:48] each Easter to Switzerland is because he
[30:52] starts putting on the pressure and he
[30:57] has a unique gift we're happy to have an
[31:01] as brother tom has said and his brother
[31:05] David's children David and children and
[31:08] well welcome you to this service and
[31:10] each you that are visiting brother John
[31:15] lay I'm glad it gets hot down there
[31:18] Louisiana it is hot here but alas as our
[31:24] sister from Tucson said it's not this is
[31:29] just lonely your heat is just wonderful
[31:33] well we were happy to hear that anyway I
[31:36] just wanted to say before brother David
[31:39] comes to minister this morning early I
[31:43] just began to ponder the Word of God and
[31:47] the statement that the prophet of God
[31:50] made in his last service and I want to
[31:54] emphasize the last service leadership
[31:59] and he asks the question who's leaving
[32:03] you now so we don't want the weather to
[32:08] lead us we don't want financial
[32:12] conditions to lead us we don't want you
[32:18] know are just a realm of fellowship to
[32:21] lead us I want to say to this
[32:24] congregation
[32:26] that he who came and used profit in a
[32:33] very special way there were many people
[32:38] perhaps many more than are here but each
[32:44] one that came up and they began and then
[32:47] he would come he speaking of our Lord
[32:53] Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord would
[32:57] be at the pulpit and now our brother
[33:02] Branham is not here but the God he
[33:06] served is here the God he served remains
[33:10] the same and this God friends knows
[33:13] every one of you and he knows me I'm so
[33:18] glad he knows me I'm so glad he knows
[33:22] you and the word that our brother David
[33:25] will speak is the word that is a
[33:29] discerner of the thoughts and the
[33:33] intents of the heart
[33:35] and so you better have come you've been
[33:40] led here somehow some way you've been
[33:43] led I want you to recognize I'm here
[33:48] because I've been led here and the one
[33:51] who lair has led me knows me and knows
[33:55] my unique special need and he is here to
[34:01] give me the answer I want to throw this
[34:05] week to listen very closely to the
[34:08] meetings to the preaching in this
[34:11] morning listen very close by the James
[34:14] sister Shirley thank you for the lovely
[34:16] afternoon at your place and evening we
[34:19] really appreciate that brother Murphy
[34:22] for your labors of love god bless you
[34:26] brother David take your liberty please
[34:29] public Spithead thank you no pressure
[34:37] amen
[34:38] good morning Saints there's something
[34:43] about being in the presence of God amen
[34:47] hallelujah and certain certainly a great
[34:50] honor and privilege to be standing
[34:53] before the redeemed of the Lord amen and
[34:56] I pray you will help me preach I'm not
[35:03] used to speaking English but I'll try my
[35:05] best and I pray it will be a blessing
[35:09] for you first of all I want to thank
[35:11] brother Tom and brother ed for the
[35:13] confidence you have and may God richly
[35:15] bless them they've been a great blessing
[35:18] to us every time we had them over not
[35:22] just to us personally but for the bride
[35:24] on the other side of the ocean and
[35:26] different continents they have been a
[35:29] great great blessing in our lives and in
[35:32] many many lives so we really want to
[35:35] give God the glory amen because God is
[35:38] using vessels amen and we sure happy to
[35:41] have vessels that's fully surrendered
[35:44] amen so but certainly I want to thank
[35:46] you personally for letting your pastor
[35:49] go and sharing and brother ed says I put
[35:55] pressure but they put pressure on me now
[35:58] so may God help us amen but it's a great
[36:02] honor to be standing before the redeemed
[36:04] of the Lord amen and I hope you came up
[36:08] prayed up
[36:09] you came here prayed up amen
[36:13] because you know prayer is a powerful
[36:16] weapon if you didn't came prayed up for
[36:19] the brand says you can pass right by
[36:21] God's blessing and not know it if you're
[36:24] not prayed up amen so prayer is not a
[36:27] little something you do five minutes
[36:29] before entering church amen we want to
[36:32] get a blessing out of the service I
[36:34] don't want it to be just an ordinary
[36:36] service Amen or camper
[36:39] glory be to God we're gonna have a
[36:40] wonderful camp Aimie but i don't know
[36:43] what tomorrow holds
[36:44] now i want my blessing amen and if there
[36:48] is a deep calling there's gonna be a
[36:50] deep that will answer amen amen and how
[36:54] wonderful it is a man to know that that
[36:57] we live in a glorious time I'm just
[37:00] gonna keep you a few moments not long
[37:02] but we know the Bible says every time
[37:05] Satan comes up like a flood the Lord
[37:09] raises his standards and we know through
[37:13] the Bible and the message how the four
[37:18] horse riders the the wide the red the
[37:21] black and the pale went forth
[37:23] but God sent anointings amen so there
[37:27] was a lion to meet a Roman age next was
[37:29] the the second horse that the Beast that
[37:32] went to meet was an ox and an ox is a
[37:35] beast of sacrifice and like brother bran
[37:38] said they went down and martyrdom during
[37:39] the Dark Ages the third beast was the
[37:42] the beast with a face of man that was
[37:44] the intellectual age the Reformers
[37:46] Luther Wesley Calvin Knox Finney
[37:49] etcetera but then he says notice what
[37:51] went forth in the evening time what time
[37:55] are we living in brothers and sisters a
[37:57] man what went forward in the evening
[38:00] time is an eagle and for a brother cries
[38:02] out a needle amen prophetic back again
[38:05] it shall be light in the evening time so
[38:09] we have so much to rejoice amen when he
[38:12] come into the house of God we cannot
[38:14] have a sad face I keep saying back home
[38:18] in church I like to see smiling faces
[38:20] because God gave us so much we have so
[38:24] much to be happy about amen so I pray
[38:27] this morning you're gonna be happy
[38:29] because God
[38:31] oh yes arise and shine for your glory
[38:34] has come a man so but what a grace it is
[38:38] to be living under the anointing of the
[38:40] ego when you look to the four animals
[38:43] there's only one
[38:44] not earthbound that's not a coincidence
[38:48] we're flying out of here soon and very
[38:51] soon
[38:52] amen I'm gonna meet my Lord and Savior
[38:55] amen so let us rejoice and be glad in it
[38:58] amen amen amen and Satan can come around
[39:02] and make you lots of promises amen you
[39:05] know he comes around whether we young
[39:06] whether we all he comes around and makes
[39:08] lots of promises
[39:10] am I the only one he makes promises to
[39:12] help me preach now he makes many
[39:15] promises but he has nothing to give you
[39:20] amen because he don't have nothing you
[39:24] hear me well he don't have nothing
[39:27] amen what is Satan run around says
[39:30] anything contrary to the word
[39:35] amen amen amen so how thankful I am for
[39:38] the Word of God amen and the anointing
[39:41] that we're living under a man because
[39:43] the God doesn't make any mistakes
[39:45] God is perfect amen and his plan is
[39:49] certainly perfect when we look to the
[39:50] Sun you see the magnetic power how it
[39:53] holds the stars the planets everything
[39:55] the moon in place but now what about the
[39:57] power of the s o N amen oh he knows his
[40:02] eyes are on the sparrow his eyes are on
[40:04] each and every I don't know what you're
[40:06] going through but I know the one who

[40:27] Brad Brad the ministry and and your
[40:30] precious precious aim and hallelujah
[40:34] let's say the word of God and Galatians
[40:37] 4
[40:47] Galatians 4 verse 1 you can say Amen
[40:52] when you're there now I say that the air
[41:00] as long as he is a child
[41:02] deferred nothing from a servant though
[41:05] he be Lord of all verse 2 but is under
[41:07] tutors and governors until the time
[41:09] appointed of the Father even so we when
[41:11] we were children we were in bondage
[41:13] under the elements of the world but when
[41:16] the fullness of time was come God sent
[41:17] forth his son made of a woman made under
[41:21] the law to redeem then them that were
[41:24] under the law that we might receive the
[41:27] adoption of sons and because ye are sons
[41:31] God has sent for the spirit of his son
[41:33] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[41:37] wherefore there are no more servant but
[41:40] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[41:44] through Christ hallelujah that's
[41:48] shouting material amen Ephesians 1 verse
[41:52] 4
[42:01] seasons 1 verse 4 according as he had
[42:06] chosen us in him before the foundation
[42:08] of the world that we should be holy and
[42:11] without blame before him in love having
[42:14] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[42:16] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[42:18] according to the good pleasure of his
[42:20] will to the praise of the glory of His
[42:23] grace wherein he had made us accepted in
[42:27] the beloved hallelujah one final portion
[42:31] of the scripture John 16 verse 28
[42:48] Jesus is saying I come forth from the
[42:52] father and I'm coming to the world again
[42:55] I leave the world and go to the Father
[42:58] may God had a blessing to the reading of
[43:01] his word let us pray
[43:03] our precious Heavenly Father how we
[43:07] counted such a great honor and privilege
[43:10] to be in the house of God knowing father
[43:14] that your word says there were two or
[43:16] three are gathered in my name that you
[43:18] are amongst us so father God we don't

[44:13] amen you may be seated hallelujah amen
[44:19] and
[44:22] and prayer when brother Tom asked me to
[44:26] take this morning service I was praying
[44:30] and looking for searching the will of
[44:32] God and because it's not just preach a
[44:35] sermon many good sermons can be preached
[44:38] but we want to seek the will of God
[44:40] because God he knows what you have need
[44:43] of a man and I was thinking and and I
[44:47] appreciate what brother had said just
[44:48] before about amen leadership Amen how he
[44:53] is leading us amen and I was thinking
[44:55] about the great mind of God and then and
[45:01] I was reading an article and and
[45:05] something was said about Einstein I
[45:07] don't know how many have heard about
[45:09] Einstein but I presume everybody has
[45:12] heard about Einstein I'm not gonna
[45:13] preach about about Einstein you know
[45:15] about his different theories of
[45:18] relativity e equals MC square and so on
[45:20] that's not important but he did say one
[45:23] thing that caught my attention and I
[45:27] like the quote he says I want to know
[45:31] God's thoughts
[45:33] the rest are details hallelujah I want
[45:39] to know God's thoughts
[45:41] the rest are of none importance now I
[45:44] can have many thoughts about brother Tom
[45:47] brother ed brother Joe or whoever or
[45:49] even bout my life or about my family but
[45:52] that's not what is important I want to
[45:55] know God's thoughts about me hallelujah
[46:00] and that's what we're gonna look into
[46:01] this morning
[46:02] amen to to go into the great mind Eamon
[46:06] and how thankful we can be amen the
[46:09] Eagle anointing God sent as a prophet
[46:11] messenger that could go back in the back
[46:14] parts of his mind
[46:15] amen to show us who we are what we are
[46:18] why we are here so all the rests young
[46:23] people and all the people my retirement
[46:25] or my career or whatever is of none
[46:28] importance I'm sorry that's easy for you
[46:32] to say brother David no it ain't
[46:35] it's nothing but the Word of God people
[46:39] are so focused and we just read John 16
[46:43] Haman Jesus saying I come from the
[46:46] Father and I'm coming to the world again
[46:47] I leave the world and go to the Father
[46:49] now listen brother Branham says we come
[46:52] out of eternity stepped into a little
[46:55] time-space here and step out of time
[46:58] back into eternity so no matter if you
[47:02] have 100 years under 2150 let's be
[47:05] generous this morning 150 years of good
[47:07] health and everything you can think of
[47:09] is nothing compared to eternity Laurie
[47:13] hallelujah so for a title this morning I
[47:16] would like to take how precious are thy
[47:20] thoughts unto me so if you think you
[47:25] know better than God you know you're not
[47:32] gonna like the preaching but how
[47:36] precious are thy thoughts unto me 1 John
[47:39] 3 verse 2 says beloved now are we the
[47:43] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[47:46] what we shall be but we know that we
[47:51] know that not intellectual knowing but
[47:53] by revelation given by God Himself we
[47:56] know that when he shall appear we shall
[47:59] be like him Damon for we shall see him
[48:03] as he is hey man now a lot of Christians
[48:08] today message believers have a problem
[48:09] accepting and and the songs were perfect
[48:13] arise possess your inheritance
[48:17] Damon it's there for the taking I have
[48:20] to take my inheritance you have to take
[48:22] your inheritance your blessing but I've
[48:24] to do the same each and every one we
[48:25] have to take but that's our blessing
[48:28] and if you don't want it I'll take yours
[48:32] but many believers today have problems
[48:35] accepting their position mm-hmm because
[48:40] they look through their eyes and not
[48:43] through the eyes of God so it's not a
[48:46] complicated message I'm gonna preach
[48:48] this morning
[48:49] I have no new message sorry
[48:54] I've got one doctrine that is Christ
[48:58] amen and now I'm gonna preach Christ
[49:01] amen so if you heard it before well give
[49:04] glory to God God knows Amen what we have
[49:07] need of amen so the problem is if we
[49:10] look through our eyes we're gonna see
[49:11] all kinds of crazy things but if you
[49:15] look through the eyes of God that's what
[49:17] matters
[49:18] that's what really matters amen Romans 3
[49:22] says let God be true but every man be a
[49:25] liar so no matter what a man can say how
[49:28] beautiful it can sound let that be alive
[49:31] but God's Word be the absolutes amen now
[49:35] to lay a foundation hey man let's
[49:39] continue and I'm gonna build up so be
[49:42] patient with me I'm on holiday so
[49:49] hi I'm Brad Brent says I'm a believer in
[49:52] what God says in his word now he says I
[49:57] can show you by the Bible where God has
[50:00] given the authority has given the power
[50:03] but know where I can find where he has
[50:07] taken it away
[50:11] come on bride hallelujah
[50:16] nowhere in the Bible I can find where
[50:20] God has taken it away so we are living
[50:24] under our god-given privileges because
[50:28] the power is there Haman
[50:31] but God is looking he says we need man
[50:36] who is willing to stand on what God said
[50:40] to be the truth now I'm gonna include
[50:44] the sister sorry I'm gonna add a little
[50:45] here we need men and women who's willing
[50:50] to stand on what God said to be the
[50:52] truth that's the atmosphere we need
[50:55] that's my prayer for this morning that's
[50:58] the atmosphere we need and that's why we
[51:02] come to church being prayed up because
[51:05] we don't want to have another church
[51:09] I want another blessing another portion
[51:12] amen Oh hallelujah so that's the
[51:15] atmosphere we need and you know
[51:18] everybody is a creator we have to create
[51:21] the atmosphere so I can look to brother
[51:24] and brother Tom or you can look to your
[51:26] neighbor but it's up to you to create
[51:28] your atmosphere amen you have her love
[51:32] the World Cup and the football and
[51:33] people they go crazy and things like
[51:35] that for a bowl at the end of the game
[51:40] they still have problems they still have
[51:41] all their trouble going to but now here
[51:44] God tells us know where I can find in
[51:47] the word where the power has been taken
[51:50] away so if you have a need this morning
[51:52] he is still the same so there's a lot to
[51:57] read oh brother David you want emotions
[51:59] oh no I want to get glory to God he's
[52:03] worried of my praise listen he needs man
[52:08] who's willing to stand stand on the word
[52:11] Peter you know the story Peter was in
[52:13] with his disciples and the boats and
[52:15] then Jesus came along now Peter didn't
[52:20] walk on water
[52:21] Preda David what are you saying I'll
[52:24] make it clear to you Matthew for 1428
[52:28] says and Peter answered to him and said
[52:30] lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[52:35] on the water and the Lord answered he
[52:39] said come so Peter walked on the world
[52:44] [Applause]
[52:48] but at UM last Sunday he said we stand
[52:51] on the word now so God is looking for
[52:55] brothers and sisters that don't look to
[52:58] circumstances around but I'm looking on
[53:01] the world of God I don't know how high
[53:04] the mountain can be how deep the water
[53:06] can be but I know my Lord will never
[53:13] heaven and earth will pass away but the
[53:16] Word of God will never pass away so we
[53:21] have to cease to listen to our own IDs I
[53:24] have to decrease he has to increase
[53:28] Isaiah 55 talking about the thoughts of
[53:32] God for my thoughts are not your
[53:37] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[53:40] save the Lord so stop wasting your time
[53:44] with your thoughts and concentrate on
[53:47] God's thoughts for your life 2
[53:52] Corinthians 10 verse 5 casting down
[53:54] imaginations and every high thing that
[53:57] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[53:59] God and bringing into captivity every
[54:01] thought to the obedience of Christ
[54:05] [Applause]
[54:08] that's where the greatest battle is
[54:10] false but God gave us what we have need
[54:15] of to be victorious so if you feel this
[54:21] morning spiritually dry do like Moses
[54:24] raise your hands and win your battle
[54:27] because with God and the Word of God
[54:30] amen there's no defeat all the laws of
[54:35] gravity or no matter how many laws that
[54:37] can be they don't apply when the word
[54:40] when you live by the word when you walk
[54:43] by the word amen hallelujah so just
[54:48] raise your hands and like brother Brown
[54:51] says you defy gravity I like to show
[54:56] Satan's soon and very soon name just
[55:00] like Enoch I'm gonna go home a many many
[55:07] men but now Haman in verse four it says
[55:10] it talks about strongholds now some of
[55:15] our thoughts can have a very strong hold
[55:18] on alive mm-hmm and those strongholds
[55:23] they lead to complexes frustrations
[55:27] depressions hatreds everything that's
[55:31] from Satan but now relevance says dull
[55:37] listen to any reasoning lest your crown
[55:40] be taken and give to another don't take
[55:43] any reasoning at all just believe what
[55:46] God said is just through it and stay
[55:49] with it
[55:50] not just believe one day and the next
[55:53] service you're down again the word says
[55:56] from glory to glory
[55:57] so come on our slaw should be getting
[55:59] bigger and bigger the powers of
[56:03] testimony should becoming bigger and
[56:04] bigger cool hallelujah hallelujah amen
[56:11] so we're at Ephesians 1 by calling as he
[56:14] had chosen us in him a Mandir so there's
[56:17] no mention about us doing something you
[56:21] agree he had chosen us in him before the
[56:26] foundation of the world talking about
[56:28] Amazing Grace amen amen amen so why
[56:32] would we need to inject my ID or
[56:37] somebody's ID when this is God's own
[56:43] idea about it it is that simple and
[56:48] though it creates so many problems
[56:50] because we have our human thoughts
[56:56] mm-hmm John 15 says ye have not chosen
[57:00] me but I have chosen you hallelujah
[57:05] that that's for me just this verse is
[57:07] enough to worship him for the rest of
[57:09] the service
[57:11] it wasn't depending on me relying on me
[57:14] on how strong how good how bad or
[57:16] whatever he chose me hallelujah
[57:19] to God be glory hallelujah amen amen so
[57:25] the Bible is not a book of system
[57:27] another book of morals or a book of
[57:29] history it is the revelation of Jesus
[57:32] Christ amen
[57:34] it is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:36] listen brethren says God himself
[57:39] revealed from word to flesh hallelujah
[57:45] Oh brothers and sisters we are living in
[57:49] a time where God sent his prophet
[57:51] messenger a son of God revealing the son
[57:55] a minutes hallelujah this is a glorious
[58:03] time brothers and sisters Hey
[58:07] many many many men then this if that is
[58:12] a revelation of Jesus Christ and he
[58:15] chose us in him then this is the
[58:18] revelation of who we are I'm not
[58:22] inventing anything here I I am simple I
[58:27] love simple preaching
[58:31] but oh how deep it is because when the
[58:34] bride gets a real revelation of who she
[58:36] is
[58:36] then the rapture will take place Haman
[58:40] so there's something about a man getting
[58:43] the revelation not mental but a
[58:46] revelation from God amen I came from God
[58:50] amen stepped into a little time a little
[58:52] lapse of time but I go back to eternity
[58:57] Laurie a many many many many man the
[59:02] message listened the message is not
[59:04] about brother Branham and with all
[59:06] respect the message is about us listen
[59:19] talking about thoughts that's the way he
[59:22] was he was in the beginning by himself
[59:24] God well the long is his source he'll
[59:27] never do that again
[59:28] cuz his thoughts are being made manifest
[59:32] and that's why we are right here this
[59:36] they amen
[59:40] that's why we are right here this day
[59:43] God fellowshipping with his thoughts
[59:46] being manifest
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:53] yeah now let's look to the thoughts of
[59:57] God the Deacons should open the door so
[1:00:01] Satan and all his demons can run out you
[1:00:04] should be I often quote it you should be
[1:00:06] Satan and all its demonic powers worst
[1:00:09] nightmare there's the question all the
[1:00:17] thoughts of God eternal God is
[1:00:20] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:00:22] behavior he's omniscient never had a new
[1:00:28] thought about anything
[1:00:31] oh you think about it brother Tom never
[1:00:34] had a new thought about anything
[1:00:39] thus the thoughts of God are eternal and
[1:00:45] it doesn't end there they are real
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:52] so 139 for thou hast possessed my reigns
[1:00:57] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[1:00:59] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:01:02] and wonderfully made away with all the
[1:01:08] complexes my nose is too sexual my ears
[1:01:12] of my hair on my skin or this or that to
[1:01:14] talk to them come on the world God says
[1:01:18] I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:01:21] [Applause]
[1:01:25] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:01:29] knoweth right well my soul right well
[1:01:35] God is not looking for jellyfish he's
[1:01:39] not looking for jellyfish Christians hey
[1:01:42] man you'll never get anything by being a
[1:01:45] little jellyfish Christian although we
[1:01:50] live in Lao DC we see many jellyfish the
[1:01:56] waves bring them brother Branham says
[1:01:58] and here comes a crab and cups them in
[1:02:01] pieces so that's why when you feel
[1:02:04] spiritually dry start praising God say
[1:02:07] thank you Lord for my blessing brother
[1:02:10] David I don't see my blessing given
[1:02:12] praise and good
[1:02:14] and about times it's worthy of the
[1:02:17] praise he loves to be praised we need
[1:02:22] some Christian not jellyfish but with a
[1:02:25] backbone battle strand like Peter on the
[1:02:29] world of God the ways when he looked
[1:02:32] through his eyes and with his thoughts
[1:02:34] it was wow that is a big wave yeah
[1:02:39] and that's how we look in our lives
[1:02:40] brothers and sisters I've been
[1:02:42] struggling with this
[1:02:43] I had this sickness for so many years
[1:02:45] and we look through our eyes our
[1:02:47] thoughts but now he says by His stripes
[1:02:50] I am already here ask and ye shall
[1:02:53] receive but when you look for the word
[1:02:59] of God and stand upon the world of God
[1:03:00] mother jellyfish and loudly say Amen ho
[1:03:04] but stand on the pure knowledge doesn't
[1:03:06] world of God how are you gonna have the
[1:03:09] victory because this is the year of
[1:03:12] Jubilee amen let's continue my substant
[1:03:18] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:03:20] secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:03:22] lowest part of the earth then eyes did
[1:03:25] see my substance yet being unperfect and
[1:03:28] in the book all my members were written
[1:03:30] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:03:33] as yet there was none of them how
[1:03:37] precious are also guys thoughts unto me
[1:03:43] Oh God how great is this some of them
[1:03:48] listen in the amplified version for you
[1:03:51] for my innermost parts you knit me
[1:03:54] together in my mother's womb I will give
[1:03:58] sounds and praise to you for I am
[1:04:00] fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful
[1:04:03] are your works and my soul knows it very
[1:04:06] well my frame was not hidden from you
[1:04:08] when it was being formed in secret and
[1:04:11] listened and intricately and skillfully
[1:04:14] formed as if embroidered with many
[1:04:17] colors in the depths of the earth
[1:04:21] Oh God
[1:04:25] he's so good he many many many many men
[1:04:29] now God hath thoughts it and we see no
[1:04:32] the thought there was eternal and had to
[1:04:35] be expressed now we can see we can find
[1:04:39] Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist and each
[1:04:42] one of them brother had brother Tom
[1:04:45] brother John brother Tim brother David
[1:04:46] come on you can put your name there he
[1:04:52] had chosen us in him before the
[1:04:54] foundation of the world Haman and each
[1:04:56] one of these were God's eternal thoughts
[1:04:59] expressed in its season but glory be to
[1:05:02] God he chose us for the very best and
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:11] although it's very dark cloudy sea is
[1:05:14] very dark very cold and even in some way
[1:05:20] a great temptation Satan comes with many
[1:05:25] promises but he has nothing to offer but
[1:05:28] God comes with the Eagle anointing he
[1:05:32] meant to say how we can live a
[1:05:34] victorious life a man so stop listening
[1:05:38] to the nonsense of Satan and start
[1:05:41] obeying the Word of God and your body
[1:05:45] will have to obey the Word of God so we
[1:05:51] are God's thought expressed in its
[1:05:54] season now listen
[1:05:56] that gives I have many atomic bombs here
[1:06:01] that's how I don't call them Nuggets
[1:06:03] sorry because the Word of God is
[1:06:08] almighty that gives an eternal quality
[1:06:12] to the elect you want to talk about
[1:06:16] quality mm-hmm you can't get away from
[1:06:21] that so even if you want to try you
[1:06:26] can't get away of the eternal quality
[1:06:30] because you are chosen in him God's
[1:06:33] elect
[1:06:40] we sang this song possess your
[1:06:43] inheritance
[1:06:44] so that means somewhere we have an
[1:06:46] inheritance a preach sell it back home
[1:06:51] about several service our inheritance so
[1:06:55] when you receive an inheritance the
[1:06:57] smile comes on the face yeah wonderful I
[1:07:01] got your attention we have obtained an
[1:07:04] inheritance
[1:07:05] somebody has to leave you something says
[1:07:09] brother branham God before the
[1:07:12] foundation of the world left you
[1:07:15] something and that's what we're looking
[1:07:18] into now this morning if what did he
[1:07:20] leave us what did he give us so we can
[1:07:23] walk out of here victorious possess our
[1:07:26] inheritance because this is the year of
[1:07:28] Jubilee God before the foundation of the
[1:07:34] world left you something a name written
[1:07:38] on the book that when the lamb would be
[1:07:41] slain you'd be recognized with it to God
[1:07:49] be the glory
[1:07:51] talking about an inheritance that's more
[1:07:55] precious than gold that's why God wrote
[1:08:01] my name your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:08:04] Life before there was even a star before
[1:08:07] there wasn't an atom before there was
[1:08:09] there was nothing but God had his plan
[1:08:13] made up he had thoughts eternal quality
[1:08:17] and he expressed them now he sealed the
[1:08:26] book with seven seals he seals it but he
[1:08:32] opens it for who for who possess your
[1:08:42] inheritance now God he went talking
[1:08:50] about the eternal quality he says the
[1:08:53] picture brought around this picture is
[1:08:55] the main thing when was it taken before
[1:08:57] there was a foundation of the world they
[1:08:58] was put in God's great file and I don't
[1:09:00] care what they would do to you how many
[1:09:05] trials hmm don't get quiet on me now
[1:09:11] I don't care what they would do with you
[1:09:17] they cannot destroy that profile that
[1:09:23] picture in God's great gallery of their
[1:09:26] it cannot be destroyed because it's
[1:09:30] eternal quality
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:34] aren't you happy God expressed his
[1:09:37] thoughts I wouldn't be here we wouldn't
[1:09:41] be here but you said let there be and
[1:09:46] there is oh I'm still billing Jeremiah
[1:09:54] 29 verse 11 for I know the thoughts that
[1:09:58] I think toward you hallelujah I know the
[1:10:09] thoughts that I think toward you say the
[1:10:10] Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:10:13] to give you an expected end
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:22] God gave us something our inheritance he
[1:10:25] gave us a man he says burn around what
[1:10:28] is this book of redemption this title
[1:10:30] deed abstract title deed what does an
[1:10:33] abstract means good question that means
[1:10:36] it search all the way back to its
[1:10:40] beginning before you were even formed in
[1:10:44] the womb of your mom there was a title
[1:10:49] deed mm-hmm hallelujah and then he says
[1:10:54] amen it's Redemption means all legal
[1:10:58] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[1:11:01] and Eve he says oh my brother branham
[1:11:04] claps his hands together amen
[1:11:07] what ought that to do to a born-again
[1:11:10] Christian so I wonder this morning what
[1:11:14] I ought to do to us when we hear God
[1:11:17] talking to us know brother Dave brother
[1:11:19] Dave is nobody but God I'm just echoing
[1:11:23] the Word of God because I love to hear
[1:11:27] what God thinks of me don't you
[1:11:34] flori you didn't become a Christian just
[1:11:37] by coincidence you are not here rather
[1:11:41] I'd mention it you are not here by
[1:11:43] coincidence
[1:11:45] you can think maybe you're smart now be
[1:11:47] careful when you think you're smarter
[1:11:49] than God
[1:11:49] you think you chose you chair God knew
[1:11:56] he knows how many hairs I have he knows
[1:11:58] my heartbeat he knows my blood pressure
[1:12:01] he knows he knows everything about you
[1:12:04] you didn't become a Christian just by
[1:12:06] coincidence because you become a
[1:12:09] Christian before he was in the world in
[1:12:11] this world before you were born
[1:12:14] God ordained you to be a Christian
[1:12:19] your mind is darkened to that now sure
[1:12:24] that's why we can say thank you Lord
[1:12:26] because he came to me when I was
[1:12:31] completely in a mess and all maybe a
[1:12:37] religious system or maybe in the world
[1:12:39] or maybe an alcoholic or a drug addict
[1:12:42] or whatever he came to me
[1:12:49] hallelujah do you know what predestinate
[1:12:54] means predestination of anything was pre
[1:12:59] saw by God mm-hmm now don't stumble at
[1:13:05] this word
[1:13:06] that's what program says God had
[1:13:09] thoughts and the word came out word is a
[1:13:13] thought expressed hainan so God in the
[1:13:18] beginning was life the eternal one in
[1:13:19] him was attributes and those attributes
[1:13:22] became words and the word became flesh
[1:13:25] Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem
[1:13:28] means to bring back just like we saw so
[1:13:30] you see all people listen up Brennan
[1:13:33] says all people will never be able to
[1:13:35] see it because all people wasn't in the
[1:13:39] beginning in God's talks call brother
[1:13:42] David you are being so mean this morning
[1:13:45] am i it's nothing but the Word of God
[1:13:50] so yes some people will never see it
[1:13:55] that's why you see a lot of people they
[1:13:58] can hold on hold on for years and all of
[1:14:01] a sudden they fall astray how is it
[1:14:04] possible
[1:14:05] oh you think you're somebody brother
[1:14:09] David
[1:14:10] you think you're a favorites of God I
[1:14:13] had didn't have found favor in God's
[1:14:16] eyes just like all of us but that's
[1:14:22] God's choosing not mine and that's God's
[1:14:26] plan a many many many men now he elected
[1:14:31] us before the foundation of the world
[1:14:34] and when I was a young kid I'm still
[1:14:38] young thank you
[1:14:40] [Laughter]
[1:14:45] like when we wanted to play soccer we
[1:14:49] took two two guys and we made up teams
[1:14:53] and of course as a kid you want to be on
[1:14:57] the best of the you know the best soccer
[1:14:58] player or the best baseball player or
[1:15:00] whatever basketball player so you're
[1:15:02] there I hope I'm in his team I hope I'm
[1:15:04] in his team but now by God's grace it's
[1:15:09] not up to me I hope I hope I hope I God
[1:15:13] by grace chose me chose you in him from
[1:15:19] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:23] Amen so he's worthy of all my praise
[1:15:26] because when I was small and I was not
[1:15:28] in a good team well you know I was Old
[1:15:31] Town but now by the grace of God I can't
[1:15:34] rejoice with Lori to God even when I'm
[1:15:38] in a big trial election looks back to
[1:15:44] foreknowledge and predestination looks
[1:15:47] to destiny that City
[1:15:53] that's my destiny where you had a
[1:15:56] brothers I'm going home soon and very
[1:16:00] soon I'm going home
[1:16:03] it's only a matter of moments now amen
[1:16:08] Israel the time clock
[1:16:10] Oh God some pieces right on time so you
[1:16:13] better be in the atmosphere of the
[1:16:15] rapture by full military force so is
[1:16:22] knowing that he was a savior Amen there
[1:16:24] was no Angels no nothing just God ella
[1:16:26] ella him the self-existent one nothing
[1:16:29] but him alone he was a savior Emma was a
[1:16:31] savior amen
[1:16:33] many pretends what's he's going to safe
[1:16:35] there's nothing lost knowing that he
[1:16:39] know that this great attribute in him
[1:16:41] would project something out yonder that
[1:16:45] he could save then when it did that by
[1:16:50] forage he looked down and he saw every
[1:16:53] one that would accept it how great is
[1:16:59] our God
[1:17:01] that's how powerful God is though I
[1:17:06] became a Christian because I wanted to
[1:17:08] but no that's nonsense
[1:17:10] God pre sign from be father from the
[1:17:14] world I knew I was going to say yes
[1:17:17] hello and then by doing so he said to
[1:17:28] save that the only way I can do it I
[1:17:30] will become down myself and be made
[1:17:33] flesh and take the sin of man upon him
[1:17:36] and die for him amen listen that I may
[1:17:41] be the one that's worshipped do you hear
[1:17:45] me correctly that I may be the one that
[1:17:51] is worshipped so not brother so-and-so
[1:17:54] not brother so-and-so brother Brown says
[1:18:11] the C gene found you what did I do to
[1:18:18] see gene found me hmm doesn't get any
[1:18:24] more complicated than that
[1:18:25] but how do I react on that word come on
[1:18:29] now you want a plain language
[1:18:32] thank you brother John in very plain
[1:18:36] language the true Bride of Christ was in
[1:18:39] the mind of God eternally though not
[1:18:42] expressed until each H came forth but
[1:18:45] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:18:49] word seed bride
[1:18:52] let that being a bride without spot or
[1:18:54] wrinkle brother David you still have
[1:18:58] lots of spots and wrinkles
[1:19:00] you're not looking through the right
[1:19:01] eyes your thoughts on the GOP's thoughts
[1:19:05] because god's thoughts are eternal
[1:19:08] quality I know what I used to be maybe I
[1:19:11] know what I ought to be but I'm on my
[1:19:14] way we did not become seed by the
[1:19:25] rebirth we were seen and therefore were
[1:19:28] reborn for only the legs can be reborn
[1:19:35] and so were you
[1:19:37] sons of god and daughters of God before
[1:19:40] there even was a moon a star Michael for
[1:19:43] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:19:46] and that was you before
[1:19:51] that shouting material hey man no
[1:19:54] sickness can't stand in the presence of
[1:19:56] your mighty if you want to talk about
[1:19:59] the eternal quality when Jesus walked
[1:20:03] even the demons come no don't don't
[1:20:07] torment us now we saw in the Word of God
[1:20:12] that this power is cylinder Josh
[1:20:21] Laurie as soon as sure as just your gene
[1:20:26] had to be in your father before your
[1:20:28] natural birth your spiritual gene had to
[1:20:31] be in God because you're an expression
[1:20:35] Laurie do you hear me you are an
[1:20:38] expression of the attributes of his
[1:20:41] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:20:43] world Wow
[1:20:48] my my my isn't that something the C gene
[1:20:52] found you what is a gene now I'm going
[1:20:55] to give a definition that's very
[1:20:57] complicated there may be some doctors
[1:20:59] here or some nurses and you will
[1:21:01] understand everything but there are some
[1:21:05] parts that are very interesting in the
[1:21:06] definition definition of a gene a
[1:21:09] heredity unit controlling a particular
[1:21:12] character what character are we talking
[1:21:14] about Christ okay this genetic element
[1:21:19] corresponds to a segment of DNA or RNA
[1:21:22] located at a specific location on a
[1:21:25] chromosome each region of the DNA that
[1:21:27] produces a functional RNA molecule is a
[1:21:30] gene whew that's Chinese sorry brother
[1:21:32] Murphy listen the nucleus of the cell is
[1:21:38] the library which contains all the
[1:21:42] hereditary heritage of the individual
[1:21:45] the chromosome is a book of this library
[1:21:49] and the gene is one page of the book
[1:21:54] Oh God before the foundation of the
[1:22:00] world wrote down my name in the Lamb's
[1:22:05] Book of Life I'm one page maybe of the
[1:22:09] book but God be to God
[1:22:12] [Applause]
[1:22:14] you've got your page in it and by God's
[1:22:17] grace the book has been opened the
[1:22:20] scenes were broken now now I can see my
[1:22:23] name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's
[1:22:31] your inheritance boy since I saw my name
[1:22:37] in the book of redemption Amon now I am
[1:22:40] so happy now I can rejoice hey man give
[1:22:44] glory to God I'm glad my name isn't it
[1:22:49] says brother Brandon the names written
[1:22:51] in heaven on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:22:53] Oh hallelujah and that's the who's who
[1:22:58] of God who's the biggest who's the
[1:23:05] greatest who's the richest who's that I
[1:23:06] don't care about that I want to look to
[1:23:09] God says who's who that's the Lamb's
[1:23:13] Book of Life
[1:23:17] no one was worthy to open the book hey
[1:23:21] man John Sean no one was worthy but he
[1:23:25] came a bloody line man hallelujah he
[1:23:29] took the book open the seals thereof
[1:23:31] face and revelation passe and they sung
[1:23:33] a new song saying thou art worthy to
[1:23:36] take the book and to open the seals for
[1:23:40] thou was slain and hast redeemed outside
[1:23:45] to God by the blood out of every kindred
[1:23:49] and tongue and people and nation oh
[1:23:54] there's a bride rising all over the
[1:23:58] world and she walks in the name of the
[1:24:01] Lord Jesus Christ joy and hast made us
[1:24:07] unto our God kings and priests and we
[1:24:09] shall reign on the earth this is not a
[1:24:17] little happening the Angels the
[1:24:21] cherubims the four and twenty elders the
[1:24:22] beasts everything uncrowned himself fell
[1:24:25] down before the throne and said worthy
[1:24:27] are thou John said everything in heaven
[1:24:32] heard me hollering hollering
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:42] heard me hollering a men screaming
[1:24:45] hallelujah and praises to God the scream
[1:24:47] went up why their names was in the book
[1:24:51] to be revealed and revealed it not will
[1:24:59] reveal they're talking about a happy
[1:25:08] time I'm quoting the Prophet let us
[1:25:13] rejoice and be glad for a bride has made
[1:25:17] herself ready
[1:25:18] what would nothing but the pure Word of
[1:25:21] God talking about a happy time when the
[1:25:26] seals broke John which is a type of the
[1:25:28] bride John must have looked in and see
[1:25:31] past the curtain of time and said there
[1:25:37] is John hallelujah okay brother David
[1:25:45] that's very nice John he went beyond the
[1:25:49] curtain of time to see there's John
[1:25:52] okay no problem you know the prophets of
[1:25:56] God they don't make mistakes so this
[1:26:00] message this word is perfect sorry if
[1:26:05] you don't agree with me that's what I
[1:26:06] believe God doesn't make mistakes
[1:26:10] now listen brother branham he had an
[1:26:15] experience women where he went beyond
[1:26:17] the curtain of time we all know this
[1:26:19] story hallelujah brother brother Brennan
[1:26:27] said and I see
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:34] include yourself but I'm sorry
[1:26:37] I let it be according to your face God
[1:26:49] gave me all I've need of a man for
[1:26:53] perfect factor now even the rapture is
[1:26:55] in Jews hey man so the rapture will just
[1:26:58] be won by by world people can think
[1:27:06] you're crazy or that I'm crazy
[1:27:08] I wonder who will be crazy at the end
[1:27:17] but now that's where we have to play our
[1:27:20] role we have to go if you look to
[1:27:23] Revelation then it says I have to go and
[1:27:28] take the little book eat the little book
[1:27:32] in order for me to become the little
[1:27:34] book now Jeremiah says thy words were
[1:27:40] found and I did eat them and thy word
[1:27:44] was unto me the joy and rejoicing of
[1:27:47] mine hearts now when the ministers the
[1:27:50] men of God come every Wednesday every no
[1:27:53] matter what day it is preach the Word of
[1:27:55] God how is your heart responding to the
[1:27:59] Word of God can you say and thy word is
[1:28:03] unto me joy and rejoicing of my heart
[1:28:08] for I am called by thy name o Lord God
[1:28:12] of hosts brother Bram says after the
[1:28:14] opening of the seals
[1:28:15] I'm gonna call you bride miss Jesus
[1:28:18] Christ I'm called by his name
[1:28:27] now all Devils out of hell can't erase
[1:28:31] your name out of there
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] no matter they can be lined up in front
[1:28:42] of you by the authority of God's Word
[1:28:47] you can speak and say you cannot erase
[1:28:51] my name out of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:57] so he can boast himself he can Bluff
[1:29:00] he's a good bluff err but you've got the
[1:29:04] power the authority in Jesus name Amen
[1:29:10] and he brought unto you Christ and you
[1:29:13] are secure with Jesus Christ a man
[1:29:16] you're not standing with your own you're
[1:29:17] standing in him with one thing I believe
[1:29:20] God only believe all things are possible
[1:29:27] now only believe has nothing to do with
[1:29:29] your thoughts but it has all to do with
[1:29:33] the Word of God
[1:29:34] the thoughts of God how do I respond to
[1:29:37] the Word of God amen all we can go
[1:29:40] through all the different examples in
[1:29:42] the Bible but they acted upon the Word
[1:29:45] of God let it be down according to that
[1:29:50] well
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:52] but I will be done then Bergeron says
[1:29:56] why did I fear look at the joy that I
[1:30:00] missed then many times we come to church
[1:30:03] services or time meeting sets and then
[1:30:06] at the end of the service or the end of
[1:30:07] the camp amen no way no way God wants to
[1:30:16] bless us so let's not miss your blessing
[1:30:22] let's not say well the joy that I missed
[1:30:27] no let's look at every victory I'm gonna
[1:30:31] take you don't need to take big steps
[1:30:35] don't worry but every step where your
[1:30:40] foot hallelujah is yours
[1:30:44] Satan you're backing up
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:55] now the predestinated is the only one
[1:30:58] that's considered in Redemption to
[1:31:03] redeem anything is to bring back to its
[1:31:05] original place that's why God sent us a
[1:31:10] prophet messenger to reveal the whole
[1:31:15] world the whole word all the parts that
[1:31:18] were left he gathered them and reveal
[1:31:23] them to us hmm what happy people we
[1:31:28] ought to be now let's start acting upon
[1:31:33] the Word of God and let's be happy and
[1:31:37] take our blessings amen oh it's happy
[1:31:41] why oh the Sun is going to call it right
[1:31:44] back oh yes hallelujah I missed the
[1:31:46] beginning of that one
[1:31:48] sorry Thank You Rita
[1:31:52] brother Brown tells the story makes a
[1:31:54] parallel he talks maybe you've heard it
[1:31:57] about a little dew drop he says I don't
[1:32:02] know too much about chemistry but it
[1:32:03] must be the congealing of humidity or
[1:32:06] atmosphere and when the knee gets cold
[1:32:09] and dark it falls from the heavens and
[1:32:11] drops upon the ground its fell from
[1:32:14] somewhere but the next morning before
[1:32:16] the Sun comes up it's lay there the
[1:32:20] little fellow shivering but just let the
[1:32:23] Sun come up hallelujah come on Bob just
[1:32:30] let the Sun come up
[1:32:32] glory what should go to shine it's happy
[1:32:38] why the Sun is going to call it right
[1:32:40] back to come from and that's the way
[1:32:45] with a Christian we know when we walk
[1:32:49] into the presence of God something in us
[1:32:52] when we come into the hands of God

[1:37:37] brightest is in laude SIA so there's not
[1:37:41] going to be an age H I'm not going into
[1:37:43] there just to put a good foundation he
[1:37:46] came to call us out of the nomination so
[1:37:51] I am we are in the bride age although
[1:37:54] we're still a now this year
[1:37:55] hmm but now he says Amen for the bride
[1:37:59] aids for a resurrection out of the dark
[1:38:01] denominationalism will be a message

[1:38:31] to the former estate of condition he's
[1:38:35] still following eyes back home I say
[1:38:40] when they when you fall asleep just
[1:38:42] raise up you'll wake up and you can me
[1:38:45] see it again but feel free never the
[1:38:48] Lord is there in spirit Lord is there's
[1:38:50] Liberty do you know there are some
[1:38:57] things that we have to do that God
[1:38:59] cannot do until we do it
[1:39:02] he furnaces the energy but we got to do
[1:39:06] the job it becomes personal now redeem
[1:39:11] is not create something redeem is to
[1:39:13] bring back that which what was already
[1:39:16] what has already been so it's not
[1:39:20] complicated our name was put in a lands
[1:39:23] book of life and written as redeemed
[1:39:30] praise the Lord
[1:39:32] before the before even yeah I was shaped
[1:39:36] iniquity born in this world and sin but
[1:39:40] even before all this happened God wrote
[1:39:43] on this page
[1:39:47] and he wrote next to it redeemed
[1:39:59] hallelujah then what are we scared about
[1:40:04] I asked you the question if God tells
[1:40:09] you next to your name it says ready
[1:40:12] what are we scared about Britta David
[1:40:16] will I make it do you think I will make
[1:40:20] it God told me I will make it I've
[1:40:25] already made it because his word says in
[1:40:33] Ephesians and we read it according as he
[1:40:35] had chosen us in him before the
[1:40:37] foundation of the world that we should
[1:40:38] be how that we should be holy and
[1:40:41] without blame before him in love the
[1:40:44] greek lexicon calls his word without
[1:40:46] blame amended us you don't know what
[1:40:49] speaks greek here I believe but the
[1:40:53] French Bible uses a word that I like
[1:40:55] which is irreproachable either push-out
[1:40:58] irreproachable the definition of that is
[1:41:01] honest recommendable reliable consensus
[1:41:04] incorruptible honest flawless impeccable
[1:41:07] innocent not guilty authentic sincere
[1:41:10] perfect the see Jean found me
[1:41:20] that's what I'm talking about but Brett
[1:41:23] and David I don't feel like somebody
[1:41:24] holy and blameless you're looking
[1:41:26] through your eyes and your thoughts you
[1:41:31] know a diamond we can all see diamonds
[1:41:34] and you're all diamonds now we don't see
[1:41:39] any difference
[1:41:41] it glitters it shines but now the
[1:41:44] experts they can categorize on different
[1:41:48] types of diamonds but now a diamond
[1:41:50] there's something special because no
[1:41:55] matter what they look like on the
[1:41:57] outside listen listen carefully no
[1:42:00] matter what they look like on the
[1:42:02] outside all diamonds are made of the
[1:42:06] same perfect chemical and atomic
[1:42:09] composition inside it's not wonderful so
[1:42:18] we can look different but on the inside
[1:42:23] there's a part of God that he placed in
[1:42:27] me in us so let's not stop looking on
[1:42:32] her you so now I want to be like you and
[1:42:34] I know
[1:42:37] I want to be like him you work with us
[1:42:49] to make it to be a son and a daughter of
[1:42:50] God you're the virtuous Bride of Christ
[1:42:53] watch in the blood of Christ
[1:42:56] boy listen Christ couldn't help being
[1:43:03] what he was
[1:43:08] now what about a bride hey I'm very
[1:43:13] simple here but all its mighty powerful
[1:43:18] Christ couldn't help being what he was
[1:43:23] and that's the same thing for
[1:43:25] predestination it brings you right back
[1:43:28] where you were predestinated you were in
[1:43:32] God stops to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:43:36] that's why I said God gave all we have
[1:43:39] need of but it's up to us to use the
[1:43:48] Word of God and to live by the Word of
[1:43:51] God
[1:43:52] mm-hmm how are you going to stop it
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:43:59] your trials new problems you think that
[1:44:04] will stop the plan of God your thoughts
[1:44:08] you think you will stop the plan of God
[1:44:12] how are you going to stop it all Devils
[1:44:16] in hell you might as well quit fussing
[1:44:18] about it because there's going to be a
[1:44:20] bride without spot or wrinkle we ought
[1:44:28] to walk like that Satan cannot do
[1:44:36] anything about it he has nothing to give
[1:44:40] he lost it all but God he has a dose
[1:44:46] system at the OS Britta Michael are you
[1:44:49] know somewhere it's not a disk operating
[1:44:53] system but it's a divine operating
[1:44:57] system the C gene of God found you and
[1:45:04] it cannot fail
[1:45:06] it's got perfect quality many people
[1:45:14] talk today about artificial intellect
[1:45:16] intelligence you know and we upgrade and
[1:45:20] we upgrade and become smarter and
[1:45:22] smarter I know one intelligence and that
[1:45:29] is Christ the head and he's the one I
[1:45:35] want to follow he's my guide in all
[1:45:39] things and the good and the bad and then
[1:45:42] and the biggest storm you might be in
[1:45:45] and you want to talk about intelligence
[1:45:48] that's real intelligence because before
[1:45:51] the foundation of the world he doesn't
[1:45:54] need to change his thoughts through the
[1:45:56] ages before there was anything he
[1:46:02] thought of me he thought of you and he's
[1:46:07] worthy of my life he's worthy of my
[1:46:09] praise he was worthy of my all and
[1:46:12] therefore he paid a price that I can be
[1:46:15] free a man so he's worthy of all glory
[1:46:18] amen he was a man that was his purpose
[1:46:22] of coming I'm winding up now amen to
[1:46:25] bring God to man and make God and man 1
[1:46:28] again this is God's great mystery of
[1:46:33] love expressed that God and man became
[1:46:36] one see the whole thing is gone a man
[1:46:38] gone and man was one there and God and
[1:46:41] man is one here
[1:46:46] there's a uniting time going on the
[1:46:50] wedding supper a man oh I'm going to the
[1:46:53] wedding supper you know eating time is
[1:46:56] here I'm gonna do two feast it's a feast
[1:47:02] and I have a chair with my name on it
[1:47:08] hey you name it you speak your victory
[1:47:17] hallelujah aim and what is it being
[1:47:21] filled with his spirit him having the
[1:47:23] preeminence that's God's person purpose
[1:47:25] to do that that he might be in Christ
[1:47:27] and Christ in us and all this together
[1:47:30] one I'm winding up now but listen God
[1:47:43] represented Christ as the Lamb and
[1:47:45] himself as the Dove when John baptized
[1:47:48] Jesus at the river of Jordan one of the
[1:47:50] greatest events that had ever taken
[1:47:51] place the Lamb the meekest of all
[1:47:54] creatures of the earth and the Dove the
[1:47:57] meekest of all fowls of heaven now
[1:47:59] that's the only way that they could ever
[1:48:00] be united it's the only way that the dog
[1:48:03] would ever come on the land as John saw
[1:48:06] Jesus and he said behold the lamb of God
[1:48:09] that they could do sin of the world
[1:48:13] that's when God and man became one the
[1:48:18] Dove and the lamp United together that's
[1:48:23] when heaven and earth embraced each
[1:48:25] other that's when God was made flesh
[1:48:29] that's when God came down from the
[1:48:31] spirit form I was made and man and
[1:48:33] voluminous
[1:48:33] that's when all eternity embraced each
[1:48:37] other
[1:48:40] that was the greatest event this world
[1:48:46] has ever seen and we'll see can we say
[1:48:51] amen to that but I love what brother
[1:48:56] Branham says after until until Christ
[1:49:05] and the church has united together again
[1:49:09] that's when God a man became one heaven
[1:49:12] and earth embraced each other and kissed
[1:49:14] each other's and saddled listen now and
[1:49:17] settled the same question the same
[1:49:20] question forever when the doll and the
[1:49:23] lamb United together when friend let me
[1:49:29] tell you something
[1:49:32] we are God's Lambs he's liking us as
[1:49:37] sheep and he's my shepherd my guide
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:48] maybe some of you have heard the story
[1:49:52] how in wars they used pigeons to send
[1:50:00] out messages and there was one pigeon
[1:50:04] there's a particularity there have
[1:50:05] equality in themselves where pigeons
[1:50:08] they are completely devoted to their
[1:50:10] families and most have an extraordinary
[1:50:15] ability to home back to them now there
[1:50:22] was one pigeon in World War one named
[1:50:25] Cheramie dear friend wha a friend we
[1:50:31] have in Jesus
[1:50:35] he's more precious than a brother than
[1:50:38] his sister he's a real friend
[1:50:43] when you are down he's by your side when
[1:50:47] you're in need he's there all you have
[1:50:50] to do is ask your friend now call your
[1:50:53] friend in school calling for a friend on
[1:50:56] the job just call on Jesus and cherami
[1:51:03] he was a messenger pigeon that flew from
[1:51:05] the US Army and it's courage and
[1:51:10] determination saved the lives of almost
[1:51:13] 200 soldiers on October 4 1918 the 308
[1:51:20] battalion in the 77th division
[1:51:23] hallelujah
[1:51:26] seven church ages seven seals you know
[1:51:29] what the name was of that Division
[1:51:32] Liberty Division and they were trapped
[1:51:40] in a small depression on the side of a
[1:51:43] hill behind enemy lines taking deadly
[1:51:45] fire out of the food and water and they
[1:51:47] attached messages to their carrier
[1:51:48] pigeons requesting urgent support the
[1:51:51] first new pigeon sent was shut bound by
[1:51:54] German forces they had but one pigeon
[1:51:57] left Cheramie dear friend the battalion
[1:52:01] Road on the last message which they
[1:52:03] attached to Cheramie desperately hoping
[1:52:05] that she would somehow make it through
[1:52:08] Cheramie was also shot behind with by
[1:52:12] enemy fire she was shot in his chest
[1:52:16] by the German forces while flying across
[1:52:19] the battle fields with a bullet in her
[1:52:21] chest one leg hanging what made me think
[1:52:26] of your testimony brother Tom
[1:52:32] one leg hanging by a single tendon
[1:52:37] Jeremy flew 25 miles in 25 minutes to
[1:52:41] headquarters to deliver the message when
[1:52:44] she arrived she was blind in one eye
[1:52:46] covered in blood with a bullet in the
[1:52:48] chest and a leg literally hanging by a
[1:52:52] thread the message she delivered saved
[1:52:55] the lives of 194 men and Jeremy became
[1:53:00] the hero of the 77th division the
[1:53:05] Liberty division but now that was a
[1:53:11] great thing for a little pigeon to do
[1:53:13] that it costs his blood his blood was on
[1:53:18] the message but one day it wasn't a
[1:53:27] pigeon it was a dove when sin had the
[1:53:33] sons of God pinned down there was no
[1:53:36] hopes there was nothing that they could
[1:53:38] do all hope was gone but there came a
[1:53:42] dog 1,900 years 2,000 years ago born in
[1:53:48] a manger dying on a cross but he reached
[1:53:54] heaven with the blood of his ownself on
[1:53:57] the message and he deliberated the sons
[1:54:02] of God that now we can be again sons of
[1:54:08] God and daughters of God
[1:54:10] to live in holiness and purity to live
[1:54:14] in its presence
[1:54:15] oh I'm so thankful for a dog the dogs
[1:54:21] that came down from glory that took the
[1:54:24] message that I was in need and he flew
[1:54:29] back to heaven with it and it was bloody
[1:54:31] all over where the sins of the world had
[1:54:34] done but today 29th of July 2018 that's
[1:54:43] today today I am liberated and free and

[2:11:46] David was speaking and of the scripture
[2:11:49] of course that he opened up with in
[2:11:51] Psalms 139 17 how precious are thy
[2:11:56] thoughts unto me O God
[2:11:59] that's wonderful and we heard a
[2:12:02] tremendous message this morning but the
[2:12:06] psalm goes on to say Oh God how great is
[2:12:08] the sum of them
[2:12:12] and I thought how perfect was the
[2:12:14] message this morning not just that we
[2:12:16] knew the thought of God but he brought
[2:12:19] us into the some of it I'm getting ready
[2:12:22] to leave in a twinkling of an eye we
[2:12:26] don't know if there's going to be an end
[2:12:27] to camp but we're going to come into
[2:12:29] camp of free people liberated people by
[2:12:34] the Word of God we're not coming inbound
[2:12:36] saints of God we can come in the first
[2:12:39] service rejoicing pulling on the Word of
[2:12:42] God letting God have his free course
[2:12:44] letting a supernatural take place and
[2:12:47] letting the word have its effect within
[2:12:51] all of our hearts we're looking forward
[2:12:53] to it

[2:13:14] God you know in a marvelous and a holy
[2:13:17] way and I don't want to deter it by any
[2:13:20] stretch of the imagination but there the
[2:13:23] the sports world has a crazy term when
[2:13:26] they play baseball it's called a
[2:13:27] no-hitter
[2:13:29] that's where the the team the opposite
[2:13:32] team doesn't get a hit they struck out

[2:13:45] crazy over there little ballgames but I
[2:13:48] was thrilled this morning to see the

[2:14:24] into a camp free not just in camp but
[2:14:28] this morning free free how great is our
