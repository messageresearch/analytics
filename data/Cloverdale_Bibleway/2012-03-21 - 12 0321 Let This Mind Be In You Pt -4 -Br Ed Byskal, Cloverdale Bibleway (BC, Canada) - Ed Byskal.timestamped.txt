[1:03] forward to a real special time this

[1:10] Jesus has a table spread and he beckoned
[1:13] us. Come and dine. Amen. Can we sing
[1:16] about it this evening? Amen. Help me
[1:18] out. I've got a little bit of a cold,
[1:20] but we can overcome that. It's just a
[1:22] lying symptom. You can over sing it and
[1:25] I can over feel it. We'll do just fine.

[1:30] feeling well? I called you, brother
[1:32] Richard. Sister, I apologize.

[4:34] Part of my savior.
[4:37] I'm a part of his word.

[5:52] of who I am
[5:56] on Calary
[6:00] to redeem his lost bride.
[6:04] The king of kings.
[6:08] He became my savior.
[6:12] This is God's great mystery.
[6:16] A love expressed to me
[6:21] that Christ and died.
[6:25] My blood was
[6:29] who I am.
[6:34] Who I am.
[6:38] I can see now
[6:41] who I am. Who I am. I'm a part of my
[6:47] savior.
[6:50] A part of his word.
[6:53] It's a revelation.
[6:58] Why don't we stand as we sing the chorus
[6:59] again?
[7:02] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[7:06] Who I am.
[7:12] We see clearly.
[7:16] Just who I am. A part of my savior.
[7:22] A part of his word.
[7:26] It's a revelation
[7:30] of who I am.
[7:36] He
[7:37] He became me that I might become him by
[7:40] grace.
[7:44] He became me
[7:48] so that I might become him by grace.
[7:59] He became me
[8:03] so that I might become
[8:09] my grace.
[8:14] He
[8:16] took my place
[8:19] so that I
[8:21] through his love
[8:24] take me.
[8:29] He became me
[8:34] so that I might
[8:37] become
[8:39] by Oh, that sounds lovely. Just sing it
[8:42] again now.
[8:45] He
[8:46] became me
[8:49] so that I might become him by grace.
[9:00] He
[9:02] became me
[9:04] so that I might become him by grace.
[9:14] For he
[9:17] took my place
[9:20] so that I
[9:22] through his love could take it.
[9:30] He became me
[9:35] so that I might become him by grace. Can
[9:42] we sing it real prayerfully again? For
[9:45] he
[9:47] became me
[9:50] so that I might
[9:53] become him by grace.
[10:01] He became me
[10:05] so that I might become
[10:11] by grace.
[10:16] He took up my place
[10:20] so that I
[10:23] through his love could take me.
[10:31] He became me
[10:36] so that I might become him by grace.
[10:46] Hallelujah.
[10:48] We appreciate his grace. Brother Kyle
[10:50] Morton, why don't you come and lead the
[10:52] congregation in prayer this evening?
[10:53] Brother Hugh, message has two requests
[10:56] that he would like the church to pray
[10:57] for. One, a friend that he has been
[11:00] witnessing to for many years. He's asked
[11:03] us to pray for his wife's brother who's
[11:06] just been suffering from an aneurysm in
[11:09] the head just recently. And we also want
[11:11] to remember his daughter, Sister Jenny
[11:14] Gray who has cancer
[11:17] uh that's growing in her chest. And just
[11:19] ask that the saints would pray for her
[11:20] at this time. Brother Kyle, if you'd
[11:22] come if you have a need or request upon
[11:25] your heart. We have a very wonderful,
[11:28] loving, caring heavenly father. Amen.
[11:30] Brother Kyle.
[11:35] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to be here
[11:37] tonight. Lord, we're so thankful that
[11:39] you've called us. Lord, you're our
[11:41] savior. You're our God. You're our
[11:42] friend. You're our father. Lord, we love
[11:45] you so much.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I just pray you meet with us
[11:48] in a special way tonight, Lord. Just by
[11:51] your grace, help us get in that channel,
[11:53] Lord, to be able to hear from you, Lord.
[11:54] It's it's been a busy week for many,
[11:56] Lord. Many different tests and trials,
[11:58] Lord. Maybe emotional upheavalss, God,
[12:00] but we've come here just to have our
[12:02] hearts open to you, Lord. You know our
[12:05] heart and you know the purpose why
[12:06] you've made us and why you've you have
[12:08] us upon this earth Jesus. And we're so
[12:10] thankful that we're able to lift up our
[12:12] eyes from whence cometh our help Lord.
[12:14] Our our help cometh from you Jesus. Oh
[12:16] God everyone here Lord has a a burden
[12:19] has a a desire Lord has a question and
[12:22] but God you know Lord. Oh Father we're
[12:24] so thankful Lord. We love you Lord.
[12:26] You've you've done so many wonderful
[12:28] things for us. Oh Jesus. just pray you
[12:31] bless whoever come behind this pulpit
[12:33] tonight. Lord, even in simplicity, as
[12:35] they would speak and as they would
[12:36] preach, God, I just pray that you'd help
[12:38] us receive from you, God. Help us
[12:40] receive strength, Lord. Help us receive
[12:42] healing, Lord. Help us receive
[12:44] encouragement, Jesus. Oh, God. Help us
[12:46] not put you in a box this evening, God.
[12:48] And Lord, for brother Hugh's prayer
[12:50] requests, Jesus, you're more than able
[12:51] to meet them, God. Just pray that you
[12:53] would, Lord, give us the faith to be
[12:55] able to receive for Brother Hugh, Lord
[12:57] Jesus. And God, we just want to commit
[12:58] the whole service into your hands from
[13:00] the worship, Lord, and the preaching.
[13:02] God, I just pray you'd help us and be
[13:04] with us, Lord. We thank you in Jesus
[13:06] name. Amen.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each and everyone as
[13:12] you have your seats this evening. Once
[13:14] again, we want to greet everyone that's
[13:17] gathered here in the visible
[13:18] congregation. Those on the telephone
[13:19] hookup and the internet, we want to say
[13:21] God bless you to you as well. Any
[13:23] visitors that we have with us tonight,
[13:25] we want to say welcome in the name of
[13:27] the Lord. Trust that you enjoy the
[13:29] service this evening. Our pastor is
[13:31] going to be coming just shortly to
[13:33] minister to us tonight. I'm looking
[13:35] forward to that.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Aren't you? Amen. Brother Ernie, it's
[13:38] good to have you back from down in
[13:40] Seattle. I trust the Saints had a
[13:41] wonderful time with you down there. Why
[13:43] don't we turn the screen to 992?
[13:48] I am redeemed.
[13:52] Love now abounds.
[13:54] Used to be a lot of hurts. Used to be a
[13:57] lot of pain. But when Jesus steps in,
[14:00] all of that fades away. Sometimes it
[14:02] takes a little time for a scar to
[14:04] disappear. But you know, it joins itself
[14:06] right back to the rest of the body. Love
[14:08] takes over and projects. And I believe
[14:10] that's each one of our portions. No
[14:12] matter what we've come through, the week
[14:14] has been a hard week already. I'm sure
[14:16] for many. Amen. But we just want to let
[14:19] off the pressure tonight and have
[14:21] whatever the Lord has for us this
[14:22] evening.
[14:28] Where there
[14:30] was hate,
[14:32] love now.
[14:37] Where there was confusion,
[14:41] peace shall reign.
[14:46] I'm walking
[14:48] with Jesus.
[14:50] I'm a child of the king.
[14:55] It's all because
[14:57] I am.
[15:03] Oh, I am redeemed.
[15:11] a cry for it was Jesus
[15:15] that changed my whole life.
[15:22] If anybody
[15:24] ask you
[15:27] just who I am
[15:31] until then
[15:33] I am redeemed.
[15:39] Oh, I'll tell
[15:42] his favor.
[15:44] I'll tell
[15:46] his precious love.
[15:49] I'll tell
[15:51] his goodness
[15:53] to me
[15:57] for virgin.
[16:00] My redemption,
[16:02] my precious blood
[16:08] will I am set free.
[16:13] Oh,
[16:16] I am free. Sing it out now.
[16:25] Jesus
[16:27] that my
[16:47] sound wonderful
[16:49] worthy.
[16:51] I am
[16:57] the
[17:00] Jesus.
[17:13] I
[17:15] am
[17:17] fulfilling.
[17:20] I am redeemed.
[17:26] I creation of brand new man. Just as we
[17:30] invite brother Bisco to come this
[17:31] evening. Hallelu
[17:36] he redee me.
[17:41] Will I
[17:43] be born into it?
[17:50] I
[17:51] thank God he justified me
[17:57] of his fullness and we all received of
[18:01] me.
[18:04] I believe
[18:08] I
[18:12] all things are happening.
[18:34] once again.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:39] He redeemed me.
[18:43] Yes, I
[18:47] to me.
[18:51] Oh, and I
[18:54] just might
[19:00] have all the
[19:06] creation.
[19:09] I
[19:13] found
[19:16] I
[19:25] am
[19:28] a new creation.
[19:31] I'm a brand new man.
[19:35] I'd like to sing Brother Derek also. I'm
[19:38] amazed that he has loved me.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; We do that.
[19:43] Amen. I'm amazed
[19:47] that you love me.
[19:52] Heat. Heat.
[20:04] I am
[20:08] in my
[20:11] heart
[20:14] away.
[20:18] I want
[20:20] away.
[20:28] that you love me.
[20:44] I found
[20:48] my sins
[20:50] are all
[20:52] they're all washed away. All my sins
[20:58] are washed
[21:00] away.
[21:04] Amen.
[21:05] Let's just bow in prayer. Father, you
[21:08] have heard your children singing. How
[21:11] amazed we are,
[21:14] &gt;&gt; that you loved us. How amazed we are
[21:17] that you redeemed us and sent their
[21:20] transforming power changing us into new
[21:23] persons, into new sons and daughters of
[21:27] God. Father, I pray that you will take
[21:29] your word and quicken it to us tonight.
[21:32] Pray father that you will just read our
[21:35] lives like an open book and may each one
[21:38] know that you are present and that you
[21:40] know every detail of their lives. We
[21:43] pray that you will instruct us and help
[21:45] us now Lord both speaker and hearers in
[21:48] the name of our blessed Lord Jesus
[21:50] Christ to whom we give all the glory.
[21:53] Amen.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Happy to have brother Tom and Joanne
[21:58] back. Amen.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; I see brother Ben up there back from the
[22:02] island.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure the folks on the island
[22:05] were happy to have somebody there for uh
[22:10] number of days. And brother Kyle and
[22:14] Sister Christina were over. Had a
[22:16] service this last weekend. And uh uh
[22:22] good thing you didn't answer me earlier,
[22:24] Brother Kyle. I was going to have you
[22:25] speaking tonight.
[22:28] Uh, but we're at the post of duty.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh, Brother Tom was prepared
[22:34] to speak as well, but I just had a
[22:36] little something on my heart. And I
[22:39] don't know whether you're praying,
[22:40] brother Roy, or what it is, but I keep I
[22:42] keep hanging over with about another two
[22:44] and three/arters after every service.
[22:47] And then something else opens up. And
[22:49] someone, a minister said to me once, I
[22:52] said, "What you been speaking on?" I
[22:54] said, "And that isn't even recently.
[22:55] That's a long time ago." I said, "Well,
[22:57] I've been speaking on the mind of God."
[22:59] He says, "You're still on the mind of
[23:00] God." I guess that's what he remembered
[23:03] that was speaking on. It's It's hard to
[23:05] forget that because that's where you
[23:06] came from. I'm just thinking about where
[23:09] I came from.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. If you have your
[23:13] Bibles, turn to uh the book of Titus.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; And we'll read from the uh reading from
[23:19] the second chapter.
[23:23] Sure. Nice to see everyone out this
[23:25] evening. Brother Ernie, God bless you.
[23:27] Had a nice time in Seattle. Wonderful.
[23:31] Hallelujah.
[23:41] Probably be a little bit different of a
[23:43] service, but uh on Wednesday night, we
[23:46] we can afford that.
[23:49] I'm going to start reading at the first
[23:51] verse.
[23:57] Titus is just before Hebrews.
[24:01] But speak thou, this is the second
[24:03] chapter, I'm sorry. But speak thou the
[24:06] things which become sound doctrine,
[24:09] that the aged men be sober, grave,
[24:12] temperate, sound in faith, in charity,
[24:15] in patience.
[24:17] The aged women likewise, that they may
[24:20] be in behavior as becometh holiness,
[24:24] not false accusers, not given to much
[24:28] wine, teachers of good things, that they
[24:31] may teach the young women to be sober,
[24:34] to love their husbands, to love their
[24:36] children, to be discreet, chasteed,
[24:40] keepers at home, good, obedient to their
[24:43] own husbands, that the word of God be
[24:46] not blasphemed. D young men likewise
[24:50] exhort to be sober minded and sober when
[24:53] we run into that it's it's vigilant to
[24:56] be watchful and vigilant
[25:00] in all things seventh verse in all
[25:02] things showing thyself a pattern of good
[25:04] works in doctrine showing unccorruptness
[25:09] gravity sincerity
[25:12] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[25:15] that he that is of the contrary part may
[25:19] be ashamed having no evil thing to say
[25:22] of you. Exhort servants to be obedient
[25:25] unto their own masters and to please
[25:28] them well in all things, not answering
[25:30] again, not perloining perloining but
[25:34] showing all good fidelity,
[25:37] that they may adorn the doctrine of God
[25:40] our savior in all things.
[25:43] For the grace of God that bringeth
[25:45] salvation hath appeared to all men,
[25:48] teaching us that denying ungodliness
[25:52] and worldly lusts, we should live
[25:55] soberly, righteously, and godly in this
[25:59] present world.
[26:02] And we remember well the uh scripture
[26:06] text from the last three services. Let
[26:09] this mind be in you which was also in
[26:13] Christ Jesus. And this is the mind that
[26:18] these things proceed from.
[26:21] And the scripture says teaching us that
[26:26] denying ungodliness and that teaching us
[26:29] is the instruction
[26:32] that is the one that is teaching must
[26:36] must know these things. It's in his mind
[26:39] before we can be taught. May God bless
[26:42] us as you have your seats. And uh
[26:51] so all of the things that were spoken
[26:54] here by Apostle Paul to Titus
[26:59] who he also called a son like he did
[27:01] Timothy.
[27:03] Uh there's only one only one person that
[27:08] can mold our characters
[27:12] that we might be able to do these
[27:14] things. I don't know if you noticed, but
[27:17] I was studying this for a while before I
[27:20] began to realize that there's an awful
[27:24] lot packed into these 12 verses.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; There's a lot packed into it. And I can
[27:29] tell you it could take a whole lifetime
[27:33] of teaching and learning and instruction
[27:38] in order to have these things as a part
[27:42] of our makeup
[27:43] &gt;&gt; to actually have them just lived out in
[27:46] a natural way. And so, uh, that only the
[27:51] mind of God, as we've been speaking
[27:54] about, could possess the wisdom of how
[27:57] to train up his children in the way that
[28:00] we should go. Now, this is going to be
[28:04] interesting, but I need to get it
[28:05] started right at the beginning.
[28:08] This word teaching in the scripture
[28:11] is is in the in the Greek. It's spoken
[28:14] of several other times in the scripture.
[28:17] And the other times it's used as
[28:19] chastening.
[28:21] Uh that and I'm going to read some
[28:23] scriptures for you so you won't have to
[28:25] turn to them. Just read them quickly.
[28:28] Speaking of Jesus, it says that who in
[28:31] the days of his flesh when he had
[28:34] offered up prayers and supplication with
[28:37] strong crying and tears unto him that
[28:40] was able to save him from death and was
[28:43] heard in that uh and was heard in that
[28:46] he feared. And though he were a son,
[28:51] yet learned he obedience
[28:53] by the things which he suffered. Now, he
[28:56] wasn't he wasn't sinful to begin with,
[28:59] but yet there were certain things that
[29:01] were molded into the life of Christ.
[29:04] I'll just give you one example that uh
[29:08] there were things that he learned. He
[29:11] learned from living and we all are. I
[29:14] hope that we're all learning something
[29:15] from life. The Bible tells us, you know,
[29:19] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, most of
[29:22] that is words of Jesus. But when he was
[29:25] when he was falsely accused and when he
[29:28] came before judgment he came before the
[29:32] people and all the people you know this
[29:34] is the Sanhedrin this is the leaders the
[29:37] spiritual leaders and he had said he'd
[29:40] made this statement destroy this temple
[29:43] and in three days I'll raise it up and
[29:46] that was the very thing that they threw
[29:48] up uh threw before him and threw into
[29:51] the court this man has said He's going
[29:54] to destroy this temple and raise it up
[29:57] in three days. And then he was silent.
[30:01] You know, it wouldn't have taken I'm I'm
[30:03] sure I I tried to put myself in that
[30:05] place. I think I would have had an
[30:07] answer. I would have said, "Well, you
[30:09] misunderstood me."
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Uh I can I can clear that up for you
[30:13] very easily. I was speaking of my own
[30:16] body, my own self. You know, uh I I'm
[30:19] not I'm not speaking of this great
[30:21] temple that took 46 years to build.
[30:25] Wouldn't that been simple? But rather
[30:27] than do that, rather than clarify it,
[30:30] rather than clear himself, he just
[30:33] remained silent.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; I can tell you those are some of the
[30:37] things that he learned. And because of
[30:40] that, he he suffered uh uh the
[30:43] accusations that were false
[30:46] and uh and and he learned uh obedience
[30:50] by the things which he suffered. There's
[30:52] a couple other scriptures that I want to
[30:55] turn to. The Bible tells us in Acts 7
[30:58] and 22. You don't have to turn to it.
[31:00] Just one verse. And Moses was learned in
[31:03] all the wisdom of the Egyptians
[31:07] and was mighty in words and deeds. And
[31:11] brother Brandham says in faith by
[31:13] experience, he said it was Moses, the
[31:16] great prophet how that it how that if
[31:19] there was any man trained and
[31:21] well-trained was Moses. He had took all
[31:24] of the degrees that Egypt had
[31:28] and could teach me. He could teach their
[31:31] men theology. He was the smartest man in
[31:34] Egypt. And he was full 40 years old when
[31:38] he went when he went out to deliver his
[31:41] brethren. But you see, he made a
[31:42] mistake. God took him out behind the
[31:45] desert. And there he stayed for 40 years
[31:49] for God to beat some of the theology out
[31:52] of him. Take the clay and beat it down
[31:55] till it's ready. other places he said
[31:57] they had to take all of that years of
[31:59] Egypt out of him. So that so the desert
[32:02] gave him an opposite experience and he
[32:05] wasn't ready for the deliverance his
[32:08] deliverance uh uh you know his
[32:10] deliverance phase to become a redeemer.
[32:12] He wasn't ready for that till he had 40
[32:15] years in the in the wilderness and in
[32:17] the desert and met the pillar of fire.
[32:20] So it was a different kind of an
[32:21] experience.
[32:23] And then uh in in tested faith, one was
[32:28] faith by experience. The other was
[32:29] tested faith produces goods produces
[32:32] goods. And Moses after having 40 years
[32:35] of theology, very best training that
[32:38] could be given a man. But he got out in
[32:41] the wilderness one time with a bunch of
[32:43] men and over two million people.
[32:47] Led them 40 years. This is now the next
[32:49] stage of his life. Led them 40 years and
[32:52] come out of the wilderness without one
[32:54] feeble person among them. Wouldn't some
[32:57] of you doctors like to know what Dr.
[33:00] Moses had for a prescription?
[33:05] &gt;&gt; He learned some things in the
[33:06] wilderness.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "How many babies was born each
[33:12] night?" Dr. Moses had a prescription in
[33:15] his briefcase. I got a little secret. He
[33:19] said, "You want me to read it to you?
[33:21] Here, here it is. All of you doctors,
[33:24] I'm the Lord that heals all your
[33:25] diseases."
[33:29] &gt;&gt; That was his prescription. It worked for
[33:32] 40 years with several million people
[33:34] without one feeble one among them. For
[33:37] one day in the backside of the desert,
[33:39] God came to him and he had an
[33:41] experience. When he had killed the
[33:43] Egyptian, he looked this way and that
[33:45] way, killing one man. He was scared. He
[33:47] had never met God. But after meeting
[33:50] God, he went down and sunk the whole
[33:52] Egyptian army.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[33:56] &gt;&gt; And never did look back. He had faith.
[33:59] He knew what it meant. Sure, he believed
[34:02] God. And he endured as seeing him who is
[34:07] invisible. After he had found God and
[34:10] met God and had an experience, he had
[34:13] faith in it. He had faith in that
[34:15] experience. Be good for us tonight.
[34:18] You're here because at some point in
[34:20] your life, perhaps maybe it wasn't
[34:22] today. Maybe it was a year ago or years
[34:25] ago, but you had an experience that you
[34:27] knew you met God. It was a transforming
[34:31] experience. It was a pivotal time in
[34:33] your life. You need to always hold that
[34:36] in front of you. I did meet God.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; I had a real experience with God. Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he had faith in
[34:44] that experience.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us also in 1 Corinthians
[34:51] 11:32,
[34:53] "And when we are judged, we are
[34:55] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[34:58] be condemned with the world." Now, when
[35:01] we hear the word word chastened, we
[35:03] immediately think of, you know,
[35:04] chastening as being whipped or being
[35:06] beaten and so on.
[35:09] that that is used in the scripture when
[35:13] it says when Pilate said and it's used
[35:16] less in the scripture than the reference
[35:18] that I have today when Pilate said I'll
[35:21] I'll I'll chasten him or I'll chastise
[35:24] him and let him go and the people cried
[35:27] out no they they didn't want just that
[35:29] they wanted something further but when
[35:32] the scripture says but when you are
[35:34] judged when we are judged we are
[35:36] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[35:39] be condemned with the world. So, it's to
[35:41] our benefit. It's not that kind of
[35:43] chastening. It's teaching and
[35:46] instruction and and God prompting and
[35:49] moving us in the right direction. Look,
[35:52] when we teach uh when you that are
[35:54] parents, when you teach your children,
[35:56] it's not always a pleasant experience
[35:58] for them. It's not always a pleasant
[36:01] experience for you, but it's the right
[36:03] experience. That's right.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; You're trying to preserve them from, you
[36:08] know, perhaps a lot of uh hardship down
[36:11] the road.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; It says also in Hebrews 12:7, "If we
[36:19] endure chastening,
[36:22] if we endure this instruction and this
[36:24] teaching, God deleth with you as sons.
[36:28] For what son is he whom the father
[36:31] chastineth not?" I want to put a little
[36:33] different slant on this chasening just
[36:35] for a moment. It is uh for someone to be
[36:39] trained. If you think of an athlete or
[36:42] if you think of anyone that is learning
[36:43] any skill, you you know you have to be
[36:48] taught. You have to be disciplined. You
[36:52] may have to go through the rigor. And uh
[36:55] and I I want to be very very blunt with
[36:58] you and very open.
[37:01] Christianity
[37:03] as a whole has really brought a
[37:05] deception on the people because coming
[37:08] to church is not really the whole aspect
[37:12] of being trained. If you said to a if
[37:16] you said to someone in the in just in a
[37:18] world in the sports events uh all any of
[37:22] the sport fields if you said because
[37:24] it's one that people re readily
[37:27] understand if you said well um I'm going
[37:30] to train you for the uh Olympics or I'm
[37:33] going to train you for a gold medal or
[37:34] I'm going to train you that you'll be
[37:36] number one in your country or part of
[37:39] number one team in your country. you
[37:41] would right away expect that this is
[37:45] going to take a good deal of my time.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; This is going to call for a disciplined
[37:51] life.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; This is going to call for a disciplined
[37:54] diet.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; It's not something you're going to come
[37:58] to church twice or three times a week
[38:00] and sit for an hour and expect to be a
[38:02] hero out there. You're not going to get
[38:04] number one place. That's that's not the
[38:07] kind of training it is. And that
[38:09] training is like a it's a chastisement
[38:11] in that sense of the word. It's rigorous
[38:14] training and and exercising and
[38:18] whatever. And while you're in it, you
[38:22] &gt;&gt; you get sore muscles
[38:24] &gt;&gt; while you're in it. You know, you get
[38:26] played out.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; While you're in it, you can barely drag
[38:28] yourself out of bed to start. I have to
[38:30] get up at 5 in the morning and be there
[38:32] at be at the gym at 6 and do all these
[38:35] things. And and I've heard of people in
[38:37] fact this I have a cousin and uh she got
[38:41] married and after she got married she
[38:44] had I think she had a child and a son
[38:46] and then had a twins and they were sons
[38:49] and had another son and before she was
[38:51] done she had five boys
[38:54] and she lived in Saskatoon. Brother
[38:55] Hillbran
[38:57] and she told me that in the winter time
[38:59] when it was cold and they were in the
[39:02] hockey and practicing all of them had to
[39:04] be in the hockey. So they were
[39:06] practicing and she says the last ones
[39:08] were playing at night and she had to get
[39:09] up so early in the morning and take the
[39:11] next ones the next batch to training and
[39:14] practice and everything else. She just
[39:16] left her car running outside. She said I
[39:18] didn't even shut it off. It was so cold.
[39:20] I just keep the car running and it
[39:22] seemed she said that's all she was doing
[39:23] is driving back and forth with these
[39:25] five boys, you know, at all different
[39:27] ages. And said, I just kept my car
[39:29] running outside. Well, I'll tell you
[39:31] what, uh those fellas were in training.
[39:33] I don't know if they got anywhere or
[39:34] not. M maybe not. I don't know what the
[39:38] boys did, but I have talked to people
[39:40] who who have been training and and some
[39:44] that have been studying.
[39:46] Some of you folks studied to get
[39:48] somewhere.
[39:50] I don't care what really what it was. It
[39:53] takes some discipline.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Even you that are in high school
[39:56] especially you're going to or in college
[40:00] you're going to study and you you know
[40:03] do you just feel oh man here I go again
[40:06] I can study tonight. No it doesn't
[40:09] really work that way.
[40:11] Even coming here to stand behind the
[40:13] pulpit
[40:16] &gt;&gt; calls for some discipline.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:20] You look out the window and the sun is
[40:22] shining and say, "Oh man, it'd be so
[40:24] nice just to go out and have a walk."
[40:26] But you got to be ready to stand the
[40:28] post of duty.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And the walk goes away and everything
[40:32] else goes away and you stay there and
[40:35] and study. So I can tell you that that
[40:38] is really the direction of of thought
[40:40] for a few moments. But but the church
[40:43] world and and Satan has used religion
[40:49] He's used religion to bring about the
[40:52] description of the church in the church
[40:54] age and the last one
[40:56] &gt;&gt; lukewarm
[40:59] &gt;&gt; lethargic
[41:02] &gt;&gt; because because the church became
[41:04] enchanted and enticed by the system of
[41:07] the world and by Christianity what they
[41:09] call Christianity. All I have to do is
[41:11] go to church. The preacher does it.
[41:13] He'll he'll preach for 20 minutes or an
[41:16] hour, hour and a half or whatever more
[41:17] and I'm done. And I go home and do what
[41:20] I want to do and do what I want to do
[41:22] the rest of my life. And then when
[41:24] church time comes, I go back and the and
[41:26] the sense that that is all that's really
[41:29] to it is really a falsehood
[41:32] &gt;&gt; that's upon the people. And uh I
[41:34] remember when uh Gerson Solomon was in
[41:36] my home, he said the difference between
[41:38] us Jews and you Gentiles, he said to to
[41:43] be Jewish is your whole life.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; You are Jewish.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And and your religion is not something
[41:49] you do. It is you.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, you you know, he
[41:54] just doesn't know what the message says.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; The message is you also.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen for that?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:04] All right. To endure chastening or
[42:06] endure this training, endure this
[42:09] instruction,
[42:11] not for just to hear it in the service
[42:13] and say, "When do I go home, but
[42:15] tomorrow and every day?" And God dealeth
[42:18] with you. If we endure teaching,
[42:21] chastening, instruction, rigorous
[42:24] discipline, if we endure that, then God
[42:27] dealeth with uh with us as sons. For
[42:31] what son is he whom the father
[42:33] chastineth not? Brother Brennham talks
[42:36] about the ceremony of adoption
[42:39] and that is maturity. He says now if
[42:41] this child was obedient that's obedient
[42:45] there was a ceremony to be made when the
[42:47] child become matured. They' taken the
[42:50] child out into a public place a robe
[42:54] upon him a royal robe and they had a
[42:58] ceremony. And it was the ceremony of
[43:01] adoption.
[43:03] The child that had been born into the
[43:05] family
[43:07] uh become placed by adoption in the
[43:10] family. And after that, that boy's name
[43:13] was just as good on a check as his
[43:16] daddy's as his daddy's was. He was the
[43:19] heir of all things. But the father, he
[43:23] was he was committed to a tutor, the
[43:25] Bible tells us. And if we're under
[43:27] tutors and the tutor is the Holy Spirit
[43:30] and he directs us and we we yield
[43:32] ourselves to that, we don't live after,
[43:35] you know, after every dictate and desire
[43:37] of the flesh, but we live after uh the
[43:41] the voice and witness of the Holy Spirit
[43:43] and the instruction that God has given
[43:45] us. And I want to say just here at the
[43:47] beginning,
[43:48] the message is absolutely full of
[43:50] instruction.
[43:52] And it was not the nice parts of the
[43:54] blessings and the healings and the
[43:56] supernatural that the people were
[43:58] repulsed with. It was when he began to
[44:01] instruct
[44:02] &gt;&gt; and they were not able to take the
[44:04] chastening of the Lord
[44:07] &gt;&gt; and prove they were not sons and
[44:09] daughters
[44:10] &gt;&gt; because a son and daughter like I've
[44:12] I've talked to more than one came under
[44:14] the sound of the gospel. I remember
[44:16] brother Charlie Drake especially sister
[44:19] he said when the message when he heard
[44:20] the message he says it just took the
[44:23] height off his back but I loved it.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; How many of us have had that kind it
[44:29] just chopped your doctrine to pieces.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; It just took the the whole foundation of
[44:35] your life away. But you said I like it.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; There's something in me that says I want
[44:40] it.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was a witness
[44:43] inside. It's good for me. I always knew
[44:46] that was correct.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 22:1 and2, and you've heard
[44:57] me say this before here, and it came to
[44:59] pass after these things, this is
[45:02] speaking now about Abraham and his
[45:04] relationship with God, that God did
[45:08] tempt Abraham. And the and the word
[45:10] tempting tempt that he tempted him is
[45:13] that he tried him to the supreme and the
[45:17] ultimate limit.
[45:19] And the word is one of the one of the
[45:22] descriptions is the assay. He assayed
[45:25] him. And if you understand mining, they
[45:28] they drill a core. I've described this
[45:31] before, but they will drill a core and
[45:34] then they lay they they will drill so
[45:36] many feet and then lay that core of
[45:39] rock. It's round, smooth, and keep
[45:42] drilling and they'll lay it in the next
[45:43] in the next and they have trays. And
[45:46] then they will take that tray out and
[45:50] take one of these long round about that
[45:53] big a round of ore, rock ore, and they
[45:57] put it in a in a mill, a grinder, and
[46:00] they grind it with balls in there called
[46:03] a ball mill. And they'll grind it till
[46:06] it's just it's it's it's more than
[46:08] powder. It it is just a slush, a sludge
[46:12] in there. And and when it's ground out,
[46:15] then they take it and shift it onto a
[46:18] vibratory table like this on a slope and
[46:21] water just washes gently over it. And
[46:24] then the various metals become visible
[46:28] whether there's copper in there, whether
[46:30] there's silver in there, whether there's
[46:32] gold in there, etc. And as they keep
[46:35] assaying each one of those, but you
[46:37] can't assay the rock unless you grind it
[46:40] to powder. That's acid. God ground
[46:45] Abraham, his friend, to powder.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; He had waited 25 years for this son.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; It was a tedious time. He's He's no
[46:57] different than you folks. No different
[46:59] at all if you'd waited 25 years for
[47:02] something and then God
[47:05] after you had a supernatural experience,
[47:07] a supernatural happening. Imagine having
[47:10] this son at the age that he was and the
[47:13] age his wife was and then you have the
[47:15] son and then God tempts him going to
[47:19] assay him and find out if he's really a
[47:22] the father of the faith.
[47:25] take your son up and offer him as a
[47:27] sacrifice. And the next verse says, "And
[47:30] he departed. He He was ready to go."
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever God said, said, "Climb over
[47:37] this stone wall, you said, you know, he
[47:40] wants you to jump. Just how high do you
[47:42] want me to jump?"
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; God's going to make a way.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; He's not going to ask us to do something
[47:47] that you can't do. Amen. That's right.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; So, I'll say in regards to this message
[47:51] to young and old alike, you can do it.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; You will be victorious.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; I don't say that of my own accord. I
[48:03] don't say that to even get you to
[48:05] respond. I'm saying that because God
[48:08] called you to this word. And he wouldn't
[48:10] call you to it if he didn't know you
[48:12] could do it.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it came to pass that God
[48:18] did tempt Abraham, and said unto him,
[48:20] Abraham.
[48:22] And he said, Behold, here I am.
[48:25] And he said, Take now thy son, thine
[48:27] only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and
[48:31] get thee into the land of Mariah, and
[48:34] offer him therefore a burnt offering
[48:36] upon one of the mountains, which I will
[48:39] tell thee of. That's quite explicit,
[48:41] isn't it?
[48:42] &gt;&gt; I don't think Abraham even misunderstood
[48:45] a word of that. offer him for a burnt
[48:47] offering on one of the mountains that
[48:49] I'm going to show you. This son that you
[48:51] waited for all of these years, this
[48:53] promise that you waited for. It's almost
[48:56] to me like the moment of the rapture
[48:59] would come and God would say, "I want
[49:01] you to go through the tribulation."
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Boy, you're quiet.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; It's almost that way.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; I've waited for this promise. This is
[49:14] the This is what I've lived for.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to offer it as a sacrifice.
[49:23] And this isn't what Abraham wanted to
[49:25] hear.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; That's not what he wanted to hear. That
[49:30] wasn't the message, his sermon he wanted
[49:32] to hear.
[49:35] He had waited so patiently for this
[49:37] promise. And now God was calling for him
[49:41] to make the ultimate sacrifice.
[49:44] One of the descriptions of this word
[49:46] tempt is to put it to the proof test. So
[49:52] God was going to put them to the proof
[49:54] test. And that happens folks.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not sorry to say it, but yet on one
[50:00] hand I'm a little sorry to say it
[50:02] because I'm going to say it and you have
[50:04] to hear it. And that is we say
[50:09] we're bride and hallelujah. We get all
[50:12] enthused when we're told all about what
[50:14] God has done for the bride and what he
[50:16] said about the bride and where she's
[50:17] going to go and the table that's going
[50:19] to be spread thousands of miles long.
[50:21] But somehow along in life and looking
[50:24] down upon you tonight, I think that
[50:26] maybe some of you have tasted of that.
[50:28] God just says, "No, you've said your
[50:31] bride. I'm just going to have you prove
[50:34] it.
[50:36] And you talk about squeeze.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; People are looking for the squeeze.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think most everyone has
[50:43] experience some squeeze
[50:46] &gt;&gt; one way or another, one kind or another.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; In fact, is I know that some of us have
[50:52] experienced uh squeeze sufficient that
[50:55] we really didn't want anymore.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Is that not right? Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; So what do you say about that brother Ed
[51:06] is what I'm saying is that we are being
[51:08] trained.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; We are being taught.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; We are being disciplined.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And being disciplined by the word.
[51:20] Now, here I'm going to turn a corner
[51:22] because
[51:24] the day that we are living in,
[51:27] folks, brothers, sisters,
[51:31] the day that we're living in is a
[51:33] treacherous day. And this is a
[51:36] treacherous time.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And Satan has thrown everything in his
[51:42] arsenal against this age. And if he if
[51:46] his most cunning was to be deceptive,
[51:49] you can believe that the scripture and
[51:51] brother Brandham quoted it many times
[51:54] that even the elect, if it were
[51:56] possible,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; would be deceived.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we can say, well, they can't be
[52:03] deceived. I can tell you if we cannot be
[52:06] deceived, it's because we didn't only,
[52:09] you know, have some immediate experience
[52:11] or shed some tears or said, "Lord,
[52:14] forgive me." It's that you went through
[52:16] some assay test.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; You've been ground down.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; You've been ground to powder and you
[52:21] came out the other side and you found
[52:24] out, I survived.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And God may have another one and he may
[52:29] have a harder one. But if you know that
[52:31] you're a son and daughter of God, you
[52:33] know that you're going to come through.
[52:35] You know that his grace is sufficient
[52:37] for you. And I got confidence in you,
[52:39] Father. You're not going to call on me
[52:41] to do anything that I will not be able
[52:44] to stand.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; You will not tempt me beyond what I'm
[52:48] able to bear.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't want this for a
[52:52] Wednesday night service, but
[52:57] &gt;&gt; we're going to have it anyway.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Conditions of our surrounding.
[53:04] So now I just want your full attention
[53:07] and
[53:09] really listen close. Conditions of our
[53:12] surroundings today
[53:17] are a strong influence and they
[53:19] influence from every area of our lives.
[53:22] I don't have to talk about young people.
[53:24] I don't have to talk about older people.
[53:26] I don't have to talk about families.
[53:28] There isn't anybody but what uh there
[53:31] isn't anybody that'll escape this and it
[53:33] doesn't it makes no difference what area
[53:36] you shall go into as far as uh
[53:40] geographically say well I will I will go
[53:43] here or I will go there uh that won't
[53:46] make a bit of difference. The same devil
[53:48] that's where you live is the same devil
[53:50] that's over there.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; And he's got something for every
[53:54] country. He's got something for every
[53:55] culture. He's got something for every
[53:58] place geographically. He's got something
[53:59] for the businessman. He's got something
[54:02] for the educator. He's got the He's got
[54:04] philosophy. And he's got uh you know all
[54:07] the all the answers and and and uh if
[54:10] you want to go into politics, for sure
[54:12] he's there.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And whatever area you want to go into,
[54:17] say, "Well, I I'll just go into
[54:18] religion." For sure you'll find him.
[54:23] Right.
[54:26] Today I've been pondering, not today
[54:28] only, but I mean in this time I've been
[54:30] pondering. I've even mentioned it to
[54:33] my wife
[54:35] because I kind of marvel at everything
[54:38] today has to be entertaining.
[54:42] I remember some years ago
[54:45] uh when the advertisements on the radio
[54:47] and advertisements on the television and
[54:50] advertisements in the newspaper wherever
[54:52] you found an advertisement they're very
[54:54] stoic and very formal and you know very
[54:59] you know just exacting as uh regarding
[55:03] regarding their product
[55:06] and the advertising agencies and so on
[55:08] were saying that if if the people if the
[55:12] advertising agency
[55:14] agencies don't smarten up, they're not
[55:16] going to sell the product. People want
[55:20] to be humored,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:22] &gt;&gt; They want it. There's got to be humor
[55:24] attached to it. Of course, it maybe
[55:27] didn't may perhaps didn't register with
[55:30] you when you heard it on the and heard
[55:32] brother Brandham saying it, but he says
[55:34] that America and for forgive me folks
[55:37] that are on the US side, I include
[55:40] ourselves with it. There isn't I don't
[55:42] see any difference really between
[55:44] Canada, United States as far as kind of
[55:46] life and the kind of things, you know,
[55:48] living standards and so on. We all are
[55:51] we all are the same. We respond the
[55:53] same. We're essentially one people in
[55:54] that sense of the word. But he said it's
[55:57] a haha spirit.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; It has to be funny,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Not hilarious, but you have to just
[56:05] Yeah. You know, and you're you're sucked
[56:08] in to buy something
[56:10] &gt;&gt; cuz it's it's it's just a little bit
[56:12] humorous. You just watch for it. For
[56:14] sure it's there. And fact is I I I I've
[56:19] encountered since I've been thinking
[56:20] about this for some time. I've
[56:22] encountered I I w I watch the ads and I
[56:25] see you know whenever we don't get a
[56:26] newspaper to our door but even if I hear
[56:29] an ad or something and you don't even
[56:32] know what it is that they're trying to
[56:34] get you inspired or engaged with because
[56:38] it doesn't seem to be connected with
[56:40] anything but they're but they're trying
[56:42] to put something across to you and it's
[56:45] really really amazing. Maybe you haven't
[56:48] noticed that, but anyway, I'll read you
[56:51] some quotes. How that do?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Everything has to be enjoyable to make
[56:57] it desirable for the people. And I say
[57:00] this has crept into the church and is a
[57:03] real threat to the believer as well. Thy
[57:06] loving kindness, he says, the American
[57:08] people. Now, I understand brother
[57:10] Brandham is he's American and so he's
[57:14] talking about his own nation. Now, the
[57:16] American people want to be entertained.
[57:19] They don't want the gospel no more. This
[57:23] is in 1958.
[57:26] They don't want the gospel no more. They
[57:28] want entertainment.
[57:30] And and the devil's given them all that
[57:33] he can. Just led them in all around
[57:36] everything. And they don't thirst for
[57:39] God no more. All the kids in this
[57:42] country, 95% of the kids in Chattanooga,
[57:45] he was the service was in Chattanooga,
[57:47] Tennessee. He said, could tell you more
[57:50] about Davy Crockett than they could tell
[57:52] you about Jesus Christ. Maybe the kids
[57:55] today don't know about Davy Crockett,
[57:57] but they know about somebody else.
[58:00] He said 95% of the women can tell you
[58:03] more about Arthur Godfrey. he was uh a
[58:06] kind of a
[58:08] humorist or whatever on the radio or
[58:11] Elvis Presley. Then they could tell you
[58:13] about Jesus Christ. They said, "Think of
[58:15] it. Think of it. Can't you see it's
[58:18] gone?" And then he cries out, "Flee,
[58:21] Christians. There's a fountain opened.
[58:25] Water is near. Life is near. Flee to it
[58:29] quickly. Drink. Drink. Drink till you
[58:32] can't drink no more. God will satisfy
[58:35] that thirst. God bless you. He said,
[58:38] "Now I'm going to pray for you." It was
[58:41] it's quite something just after he had
[58:42] said that. Now, I've got quite a few
[58:45] more. So, I want you to listen closely.
[58:48] American people, he said, "This is uh
[58:50] Door to the Heart in Harrison
[58:52] Harrisonenberg, Virginia.
[58:55] American people want to be entertained.
[58:58] They want some uh little Hollywood star
[59:00] with kinky hair and dressed up like I
[59:04] don't know what to come out and to make
[59:07] entertainment because that's what you
[59:09] see on your television. I'm not just one
[59:13] oldfashioned preacher that believes
[59:15] that's there's no cure but the blood of
[59:18] Jesus Christ and that's right.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Now when I'm speaking to you today I'm
[59:23] speaking about the conditions that are
[59:25] in the world. not speaking to you about
[59:30] your own life or your own home. I know
[59:32] that you have a hunger for God, but
[59:33] these are things and these are
[59:35] conditions that are very real and
[59:38] they're very present in the world. He
[59:42] said, "And and
[59:44] now you you might consider me kind of
[59:46] way off, but I want you, especially you
[59:49] young people that's got some years ahead
[59:51] if the time goes on to listen very
[59:53] close. In 1954,
[59:56] Brother Brandon preached the invasion of
[59:58] America.
[1:00:02] Now, we might say, well, America, Europe
[1:00:04] was invaded. The Philippines were
[1:00:06] invaded.
[1:00:08] Vietnam was invaded.
[1:00:11] Uh, all kinds of nations. If you go on
[1:00:13] Google and just go the invasion of and
[1:00:16] you'll get all kinds of them. They've
[1:00:18] been invaded. And I'm going to carry
[1:00:20] that thought through for a while. But
[1:00:23] Elijah the prophet spoke the invasion of
[1:00:25] America
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; and some people I'll just throw this in
[1:00:30] quickly because I'm going to come to it.
[1:00:32] A lot of people are waiting. I was in
[1:00:34] Germany and uh in Europe and there are
[1:00:38] people that are there they're there they
[1:00:41] catch that in the uh brother Brandham's
[1:00:43] message that you know his seventh vision
[1:00:46] was just uh uh burning stumps and just
[1:00:50] smoldering ruins.
[1:00:53] Well, I tell you what, folks. It's a lot
[1:00:56] more smoldering ruins today
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; than it would be under an atomic bomb.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:03] That's my own belief.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in one place he's
[1:01:09] talking to the people and they've been
[1:01:10] rejecting the message for years. He
[1:01:13] said, "You ought to take a looking glass
[1:01:15] and look into your own soul and see how
[1:01:18] decrepit and how they'd like to see
[1:01:20] somebody healed." you know, that was all
[1:01:23] twisted up and mangled up and all out of
[1:01:25] shape and and born and twisted all bone
[1:01:29] structure and everything. And that they
[1:01:30] saw that all straightened out, oh, the
[1:01:33] whole place would go wild.
[1:01:36] But he was telling them, you ought to
[1:01:38] look in the looking glass of the word of
[1:01:40] God and see the condition of your own
[1:01:42] soul. And he was trying to get the
[1:01:44] people to get them to see that the that
[1:01:48] their soul was much more twisted up than
[1:01:50] some human that was a that was in a
[1:01:53] terrible condition.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And that when a soul like that
[1:01:57] experiences a a a deliverance and a
[1:02:00] healing, it's a greater miracle than one
[1:02:03] that has whose body is corrected.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you agree with that. Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; In the door of door to the heart.
[1:02:14] Yeah. And and so I read that one. Then
[1:02:17] in in the evasion invasion of the United
[1:02:19] States, I have two or three quotes from
[1:02:21] here. They're not just quotes of the
[1:02:23] past. Uh you want to keep in balance.
[1:02:25] This is a prophet of God speaking about
[1:02:29] a nation. Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "We found out we find out we've
[1:02:34] had 30,000 converts in 6 weeks and 6
[1:02:38] weeks later, I think he was I'm not too
[1:02:40] sure. I didn't read the quote uh the uh
[1:02:43] portion before the context. It might
[1:02:45] have been uh one of Billy Graham's
[1:02:47] meetings." He says, "And then six weeks
[1:02:49] later, we haven't got one." He said,
[1:02:51] "There's something wrong somewhere,
[1:02:54] and it's all glamour." Now, he he he's
[1:02:58] discerning. He's not discerning you have
[1:03:01] a cancer or you have tuberculosis.
[1:03:04] He's discerning a problem in the
[1:03:06] country.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And the problem is severe.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; We have 30,000 converts and now we
[1:03:14] haven't got any.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I expect a response from you.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; That's serious business. Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; If we'd had 30,000 converts in some
[1:03:25] meetings recently and now they were all
[1:03:28] gone, you'd be saying, "Brother Ed,
[1:03:31] something is wrong."
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, the spirit of
[1:03:35] Elijah saying, "Something's wrong." And
[1:03:38] the first words out of his mouth is
[1:03:40] glamour.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Now, that might not appear to be like a
[1:03:47] Is that a disease? Is that that
[1:03:50] terrible? Is that that bad?
[1:03:53] Elijah thinks so.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; So he says
[1:04:00] glamour putting on. He said the world
[1:04:04] through television, through radio,
[1:04:07] through picture shows and those outlets
[1:04:09] there has corrupted this nation with
[1:04:13] pomerot of Hollywood.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Everything wants to be a big glamour.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? He said, "You know
[1:04:21] that's the truth. And we don't have to
[1:04:23] have any more old-fashioned religion
[1:04:26] that we used to have years ago.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's where 30,000 went."
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And then in this is now remember the
[1:04:35] title. It's still the invasion of United
[1:04:38] States. He said, "What is it? It's the
[1:04:42] devil." He said, "It's the devil. The
[1:04:44] invasion." He swept into this nation
[1:04:47] like a roaring lion. He set himself down
[1:04:51] there in the best place that he had in
[1:04:53] Hollywood. He said, "I can get the
[1:04:56] movies here, there, here until the
[1:04:59] television comes on and then I'll get
[1:05:01] them." And he set he sat down there. And
[1:05:05] the church people instead of shutting
[1:05:07] down the shows and not letting their
[1:05:09] children go, they give them 10 cents to
[1:05:11] go to a Sunday afternoon and and and
[1:05:14] send them down there so they can have a
[1:05:16] little social card party. uh be out to
[1:05:19] their self. Now, I know you may say,
[1:05:21] "Well, we don't do that, Brother Ed. Who
[1:05:23] you preaching to?" No, I know that we
[1:05:26] don't do that. But the influence of that
[1:05:30] spirit is not going to leave just
[1:05:32] because you're a message believer or you
[1:05:34] go to Bible way or go to some other, you
[1:05:37] know, Bible believers tabernacle or who
[1:05:38] knows where. God's Satan's not going to
[1:05:41] just stand back and say, "Well, I guess
[1:05:42] I can't touch those folks." No, he's
[1:05:44] going to work that much harder on those
[1:05:46] folks. He's going to work that much
[1:05:47] harder on those that profess this
[1:05:50] message to get them to see if they if he
[1:05:53] can just get them relaxed.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Get them apathetic.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And it's something
[1:06:03] it's something, you know, I I'm just
[1:06:05] going to speak my mind. I'm going to
[1:06:07] speak my heart. Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You know, when when when I was young,
[1:06:12] you had to you had to get up and get
[1:06:14] with it and work and work hard to make a
[1:06:18] living to survive.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And some of you maybe been on farms and
[1:06:22] whatever more. You know what I'm talking
[1:06:23] about. Everything was a hardship. To go
[1:06:26] to school was a hardship. Uh to to go
[1:06:29] and feed the animals was a hardship. To
[1:06:31] take them to water was a hardship. to
[1:06:33] split the wood or all those things. You
[1:06:35] say, "Ah, brother Biscllow, we don't do
[1:06:37] that." Now, I know you just turn the
[1:06:39] thermostat. But that is what I'm
[1:06:41] speaking all about. We don't come in the
[1:06:43] church and just turn a thermostat.
[1:06:46] Somebody Somebody has paid a price.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody has been disciplined. and and
[1:06:53] Satan would like you to believe that
[1:06:55] it's only the ministry or it's only the
[1:06:57] deacons or it's only somebody that kind
[1:07:00] of runs the show and I just come and
[1:07:02] enjoy it. No, this is not an
[1:07:04] entertainment.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; This is this is not something you just
[1:07:08] come in and uh be a be a participant.
[1:07:11] No, it's not that at all. It is one
[1:07:13] functioning body. Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I don't care how young you are, how old
[1:07:20] you are, there's always something that a
[1:07:22] person can do for the kingdom of God.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So, well, I'm just a lady. Bake some
[1:07:27] biscuits.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody maybe there's somebody
[1:07:32] that you can help or you can be a
[1:07:34] benefit to or be an encouragement to.
[1:07:37] And it doesn't take a whole lot.
[1:07:39] Sometime you just shake a person's hand,
[1:07:41] you smile and really, you know, let the
[1:07:44] message come through. God bless you.
[1:07:46] I've been thinking about you. Fact is, I
[1:07:48] was praying for you. That's a great
[1:07:51] encouragement. You don't know what that
[1:07:53] one's going through.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; So he said that he sat down there. He
[1:08:03] said, "And they just turn the television
[1:08:04] on and watch all the dirty, rotten Tommy
[1:08:07] rot there is in the world on it." And he
[1:08:10] said, "That's right." He says, "I ain't
[1:08:12] got nothing against the movie. I ain't
[1:08:14] got nothing against the television. It's
[1:08:16] not It's the rotten stuff that's on it."
[1:08:19] And that's what it is. And if you have
[1:08:21] kept it moral, it have been it would
[1:08:24] have stayed. It would it it it
[1:08:28] had to stay moral.
[1:08:31] Now,
[1:08:33] I thought I would just do a little
[1:08:35] search. Going to watch my time, too. So,
[1:08:38] I'm not going to stay long.
[1:08:41] Brother Brandham talks about the Jewish
[1:08:44] people and the 144,000 and so on in
[1:08:47] Israel, and he talks about the Wall
[1:08:49] Street Jews and so on. Said, "I don't
[1:08:51] mean those Wall Street Jews." And
[1:08:53] listen, I'm not anti I'm very pro-Jewish
[1:08:55] as you know,
[1:08:58] but I I I have always known, you know,
[1:09:02] Warner Brothers, Fox Brothers,
[1:09:05] uh, Paramount Studios is all Jewish.
[1:09:10] And may perhaps this is going to
[1:09:11] surprise you, but I have scriptures
[1:09:13] here. And if you want to go home and
[1:09:15] read uh Ezekiel 16, it's a very sorry
[1:09:20] account. And God details how he found
[1:09:24] Israel and I found you wallowing in your
[1:09:26] own blood and out in the desert place
[1:09:28] and I picked you up and I bathed you and
[1:09:31] I washed you. And then he talk and then
[1:09:33] he goes into how they backsliden and
[1:09:36] they got fat and they got you know they
[1:09:39] just got laxidasical and apathetic and
[1:09:42] lethargic and they just got lukewarm.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; These is God's people.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; These are delivered people.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And this happened to those those people
[1:09:53] at that time. And uh the Bible tells us
[1:09:56] in Ezekiel and I'll maybe read two or
[1:09:58] three verses if we get a little later on
[1:09:59] if I have time. And then he he speaks
[1:10:02] about how they then they begin to go
[1:10:04] after other gods and begin to sacrifice
[1:10:07] to other gods. And he comes against them
[1:10:10] so hard and the verses that I have
[1:10:12] selected are along these lines. He tells
[1:10:15] them you became worse
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; than the heathen nation.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And one place it says they're not half
[1:10:24] as bad as you are. and he just
[1:10:27] castigates them and rebukes them even
[1:10:30] though he's a god of love and he's he's
[1:10:32] a a god of redemption yet this was what
[1:10:36] he he described Israel he described
[1:10:38] Israel at friends and let me tell you
[1:10:40] something they weren't subjected to the
[1:10:42] spirit of deception that you and I are
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; they weren't subjected to you know an an
[1:10:53] iPad and an iPod And now now it went
[1:10:56] from the theater to the television to
[1:11:00] your pocket
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; to your hand and you can see anything on
[1:11:04] there.
[1:11:07] And if the devil pulled it over their
[1:11:09] eyes, taking it from the theater into
[1:11:11] the house, I tell you, he's really
[1:11:12] pulled the wool over the people's eyes
[1:11:14] when he put it in their pocket and put
[1:11:16] it in their hand
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; and put all the filth that's possible
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; on your iPod and and and I iPod, I tab,
[1:11:28] and uh whatever. And dumb phone.
[1:11:34] I thought that's a better name than
[1:11:36] smartphone.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; This article is How Jewish is Hollywood?
[1:11:46] It's out of the New York I'm sorry, out
[1:11:48] of the Los Angeles Times newspaper.
[1:11:52] It's written by a Jew.
[1:11:55] His name is Joel Stein.
[1:11:58] He said, "I've never been so upset by a
[1:12:01] poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans
[1:12:06] now believe that the movie and
[1:12:08] television industries are pretty much
[1:12:10] run by Jews." Down, he said, from 50% in
[1:12:15] 1964. He's really upset that the poll of
[1:12:19] the people thought there's only only 22%
[1:12:22] of them now thought that the Hollywood
[1:12:24] was run by Jews. In 1964, it was 50%.
[1:12:29] He says the Anti-defamation League,
[1:12:32] which released the poll results last
[1:12:35] month, sees in this in these numbers a
[1:12:38] victory against stereotyping.
[1:12:40] Actually, it just shows how dumb America
[1:12:43] has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? Now, a
[1:12:50] lot of these names mean nothing to you,
[1:12:51] mean nothing to me, but it's it's part
[1:12:53] of the article.
[1:12:55] How deeply Jewish is Hollywood?
[1:12:59] Now, now when I read this, I want you to
[1:13:01] think about all the things you've
[1:13:03] listened to in the message. What Brother
[1:13:05] Brandham said, he said
[1:13:08] Paris, France used to export their filth
[1:13:12] here.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Now, he said we export it over there.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And you talk about the earthquake in
[1:13:19] California. God has a justified reason
[1:13:23] why he wants to sink the place.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And he even said that Hollywood became
[1:13:30] Satan's seat.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not preaching for a popularity
[1:13:34] contest. I'm just preaching so we get
[1:13:37] some in instruction also because it has
[1:13:39] invaded every area of this West Coast,
[1:13:43] America, Canada, and the world. You can
[1:13:46] go to Japan and find it there. You can
[1:13:47] go to Beijing and find it there. You can
[1:13:49] go any place in the world and find it
[1:13:51] there. And the thing that they really
[1:13:52] want in the western culture is the
[1:13:54] western entertainment.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He says when the when the studio chiefs
[1:14:03] took a full page ad in the Los Angeles
[1:14:05] Times a few weeks ago to demand that the
[1:14:09] Screen Actors Guild settle its contract.
[1:14:13] The open letter was signed by
[1:14:16] News Corp. President Peter Chinnan,
[1:14:20] Jewish. Parammont Pictures Chairman Brad
[1:14:24] Gray, Jewish. Walt Disney Company chief
[1:14:28] executive Robert Eager, Jewish. Sony
[1:14:32] Pictures chairman Michael Linton,
[1:14:35] surprise. Dutch Jewish. Warner Brothers
[1:14:39] chairman Barry Meyer, Jewish. CBS Corp.
[1:14:43] Chief Executive Leslie Moonveves,
[1:14:46] so Jewish, his great uncle, was the
[1:14:49] first prime minister of Israel. MGM
[1:14:52] chairman Harry Sloan, Jewish, and NBC
[1:14:56] Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker,
[1:15:00] mega Jewish. If either of the Weinstein
[1:15:04] brothers had signed, this group would
[1:15:06] have not only the power to shut down all
[1:15:09] the film production, but to form a
[1:15:12] minion uh with enough Fiji water on
[1:15:15] hand, which I don't understand this
[1:15:17] phrase, to fill a mikvah.
[1:15:20] The person they were yelling at in the
[1:15:23] ad was SAG President Alan Rosenberg.
[1:15:27] Take a guess.
[1:15:29] The scathing rebuttal to the ad was
[1:15:32] written by entertainment super agent Ari
[1:15:36] Emmanuel, Jew with Israeli parents on
[1:15:40] the Huffington Post, which is owned by
[1:15:43] Ariana Huffington, not Jewish and has
[1:15:47] never worked in Hollywood.
[1:15:49] The Jews are so dominant.
[1:15:52] I had to scour the trades to come up
[1:15:55] with six Gentiles in high positions at
[1:15:58] entertainment companies. When I called
[1:16:01] them to talk about their incredible
[1:16:03] advancement, five of them refused to
[1:16:06] talk to me, apparently out of fear of
[1:16:08] insulting Jews. The sixth AMC president,
[1:16:13] Charlie Collier, turned out to be
[1:16:15] Jewish. As a proud Jew, I want America
[1:16:19] to know about our accomplishments. Yes,
[1:16:22] we control Hollywood, and without us,
[1:16:24] you'd be flipping between the 700 Club
[1:16:26] and Davy and Goliath on TV all day. So,
[1:16:30] I've taken it upon myself to reconvince
[1:16:32] America that Jews run Hollywood by
[1:16:36] launching a public relations campaign
[1:16:39] because that's what we do best. I'm
[1:16:42] weighing several slogans, including
[1:16:45] Hollywood, more Jewish than ever, or
[1:16:48] Hollywood from the people who brought
[1:16:50] you the Bible. And Hollywood, if you
[1:16:53] enjoy TV and movies, then you probably
[1:16:56] like Jews after all.
[1:17:03] And if you think for a minute they
[1:17:05] haven't covered an area of your life,
[1:17:09] you're deceived.
[1:17:12] There's some area someplace
[1:17:15] if you read a magazine or the Reader's
[1:17:17] Digest or something of the cleanest type
[1:17:20] of literature
[1:17:23] or somebody wrote an article and they
[1:17:26] were influenced and they watch this
[1:17:28] stuff.
[1:17:29] Somebody wrote a book or somebody wrote
[1:17:31] an article and their mind is completely
[1:17:34] contaminated and given over by it. It's
[1:17:36] not possible. And the prophet said it
[1:17:38] very clearly. It invades the platform
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; because people are desiring
[1:17:46] entertainment because the whole world is
[1:17:48] bent that way. And so there has to be
[1:17:50] something in the service, something in
[1:17:53] our worship that's humorous. It doesn't
[1:17:55] have to be. It can be dead serious,
[1:17:58] friends.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But this thing, this this spirit has
[1:18:03] literally washed over the face of the
[1:18:06] earth. And it came from people because I
[1:18:10] I say that when when uh when the people
[1:18:14] that are called of God, Israel, when
[1:18:16] they turn their back on God, there
[1:18:18] doesn't seem to be any restraints.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And you can find it in the scripture and
[1:18:25] you read Ezekiel 16 when you go home.
[1:18:28] You'll find it in the scripture. Maybe
[1:18:30] I'll just I'll I'll I'll read the
[1:18:32] scriptures.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ezekiel 16:es 1 2 and 3 and then
[1:18:38] 47 and 51. Again the word of the Lord
[1:18:40] came unto me saying
[1:18:43] son of man cause Jerusalem cause
[1:18:46] Jerusalem.
[1:18:52] Let hear everybody say Jerusalem.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. Jerusalem.
[1:18:58] the city of Zion
[1:19:01] where Mount Mariah is
[1:19:03] where the temple's to be rebuilt said
[1:19:06] cause them to know the her abomination
[1:19:11] and say thus sayith the Lord God unto
[1:19:14] Jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity in
[1:19:17] the land of Canaan thy father was an
[1:19:19] Amorite and thy mother was a Hittite
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; in verse 47 yet and he's still carrying
[1:19:26] on the message God is giving this direct
[1:19:28] direct message to Ezekiel.
[1:19:31] Yet hast thou not walked after their
[1:19:34] ways? Yet hast thou not walked after
[1:19:36] their ways, nor done after their
[1:19:39] abominations, but as it were as if it
[1:19:42] were a very little thing, thou was
[1:19:44] corrupted more than they in all thy
[1:19:48] ways.
[1:19:50] Listen friends, here's a people and I
[1:19:52] say this. I'll say this as as a wash as
[1:19:56] a warning and a caution to all believers
[1:19:58] that hear this service. If we do
[1:20:01] nothing, if we just laxidasical,
[1:20:05] you know, just say, well, I'm going to
[1:20:08] just let the ministry carry me along.
[1:20:11] No, we are here to fight a great battle,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and you have to fight your own battle.
[1:20:17] and we will also fight a battle
[1:20:19] together. But the but the I I have all
[1:20:22] my confidence in what the messenger has
[1:20:24] said. The bride of Jesus Christ cannot
[1:20:27] be deceived.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; But but yet we can be the bride of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ. We can be the elect of God. We
[1:20:34] can be the royal seed of Abraham and all
[1:20:37] of those things. God ground Abraham out.
[1:20:39] He allowed him to be ground out and he
[1:20:42] allow us to do that as well because the
[1:20:44] trial of our faith is more precious to
[1:20:47] him than gold.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Verse 40 51 says, "Neither hath Samaria
[1:20:58] committed half of thy sins." Think of
[1:21:00] it. This godless Samaria, "Neither have
[1:21:03] they committed even half of your sins.
[1:21:06] But thou hast multiplied thine
[1:21:07] abomination more than they, and hast
[1:21:11] justified thy sisters, thy sisters in
[1:21:14] all thine abominations which thou hast
[1:21:17] done. And if you go home and read it,
[1:21:19] then you'll say, I just want you to be
[1:21:21] mindful of of what Israel was to God,
[1:21:25] all the victories that God did, and all
[1:21:27] the promises that he gave, and yet where
[1:21:30] they managed to go to, and ask yourself,
[1:21:32] how did they ever get there? Well, they
[1:21:35] got there by letting down the bars. They
[1:21:37] got there little by little by, you know,
[1:21:40] just looking over the fence and and uh
[1:21:42] saying, "Well, it's not that bad." And
[1:21:45] they got there because because it's in
[1:21:47] it's in politics.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with what he said.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; It's in your shopping malls.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; They've designed the clothes.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; It's in the barber shop.
[1:22:03] Is that where they got all our designs?
[1:22:05] All the fashion has birthed in
[1:22:08] Hollywood.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; It's in politics.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; The laws and the regulations that come
[1:22:20] down are imposed upon believers
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. We have to
[1:22:27] honor that.
[1:22:29] And nevertheless, it's not it didn't
[1:22:32] come from a godly king or a godly
[1:22:35] government politics. And you want to if
[1:22:40] you doubt what I say, just go and find
[1:22:42] out what the prophet has said about it.
[1:22:44] It's corrupted and rotten to the core.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Can I go on for about another five or 10
[1:23:00] minutes?
[1:23:09] I want you to notice in this next in
[1:23:12] this next words that brother Brandham
[1:23:15] speaks and I've just given a heading to
[1:23:17] it. Corrupting the minds
[1:23:20] of the people and the minds is the
[1:23:23] battleground.
[1:23:26] And that's why I say that I'm going to
[1:23:28] show you some pictures of some
[1:23:29] battlegrounds
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; that that are remain after some wars
[1:23:36] fought and after humans with their human
[1:23:40] artillery and bombs and whatever more
[1:23:43] what they were left with.
[1:23:47] What do you think God's left with?
[1:23:50] And there had to be a mind. There had to
[1:23:53] be a there had to be a mutual meeting
[1:23:56] ground for these two forces. And he said
[1:23:59] there's only two.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; There had to be a place chosen. And if
[1:24:04] you got a mind, your mind was chosen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; The human mind was chosen for this
[1:24:11] battle to take place. And I'm here
[1:24:13] tonight to say every every instrument of
[1:24:18] war that the enemy has in his artillery
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; has been blasted into the human mind
[1:24:25] from every direction. Every bomb he has
[1:24:29] has been dropped on the human mind. And
[1:24:32] the fact that you and I are engaged in a
[1:24:34] lot of warfare and mental pressure, it's
[1:24:37] that's why.
[1:24:39] And don't think for a minute that you're
[1:24:41] the only one. The one sitting next to
[1:24:43] you has it. The preacher has it.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; The kids have it. The seniors have it.
[1:24:48] We all have it.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We're in a warfare.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; We're engaged in a great warfare. But
[1:24:54] this one, God is already sealed with a
[1:24:57] victory for the believer.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Listen friends. I this is a real this is
[1:25:10] a real message
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; and I am in a mortal warfare with the
[1:25:13] enemy.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I counsel people but I realize when
[1:25:17] we're in counseling there's a warfare
[1:25:19] going on and people have real problems.
[1:25:22] They have real pressures. Some almost
[1:25:24] seem insoluble. There's an enemy out
[1:25:27] there. And I say let's not let's not
[1:25:29] take advice from him.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Let's take advice from this word of God.
[1:25:34] And this scriptur's got the advice for
[1:25:36] every person under the sound of my voice
[1:25:39] today.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's too bad that the things
[1:25:47] of the world has so captured the church
[1:25:50] in these days." And don't don't forget
[1:25:52] that this was actually in in ' 62 and
[1:25:55] right over here in our capital city,
[1:25:56] Victoria, is where he preached it. I was
[1:26:00] sitting there on the platform. I get
[1:26:02] more out of it today than I did then.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; It's too bad that the things of the
[1:26:09] world have so captured the church in
[1:26:10] these days and Satan had a rude way of
[1:26:13] doing it to bringing in the television
[1:26:16] right into the homes and things and
[1:26:18] corrupting the minds of the people. Now
[1:26:22] we might have a phone or we might have a
[1:26:24] iPod or iPad or whatever more but just
[1:26:28] don't forget don't forget for a moment
[1:26:31] that it's a that it's the ingenuity of
[1:26:34] Satan and the deception of Satan. He
[1:26:36] invented these things not for your
[1:26:38] convenience. He invented them for
[1:26:40] corruption.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; He invented them to devastate the mind
[1:26:44] of the believer.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; The unbeliever he's already got them.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me friends?
[1:26:54] That's why they've been invented.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Not for your convenience,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; not to make things easier, not to make
[1:27:01] your school and your studies easier or
[1:27:04] your business easier. He invented it for
[1:27:06] one thing, that's corruption.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; He is a destroyer by nature.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; He's a destroyer by nature.
[1:27:17] He cometh not but for to steal
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; and to kill and to destroy.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Young men, young women, older people, it
[1:27:28] doesn't He has no He has no age lines
[1:27:31] whatsoever. He doesn't care. He's out to
[1:27:34] corrupt the people.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; And the message is no boundary for him.
[1:27:40] He invades right in. In fact is if he
[1:27:42] could get the believers to become
[1:27:44] entertainmentminded
[1:27:46] that that's where it first starts to get
[1:27:48] loosened up. Maybe even good gospel
[1:27:51] music and and it turns into from worship
[1:27:54] to entertainment.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; We we're afraid of that.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want entertainment.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; We want worship.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the only one we want to
[1:28:05] worship him.
[1:28:08] Yes, sir.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for you, friends, because I
[1:28:11] I I know that you're receiving it and
[1:28:13] supporting it. It's to corrupt the the
[1:28:16] mind of the people, the mind
[1:28:20] where the warfare between God and Satan
[1:28:23] is taking place. And by corrupting the
[1:28:26] mind of the people, he's trying to get
[1:28:29] an advantage against God.
[1:28:33] And he's trying to go contrary to the
[1:28:36] scripture which says let this mind be in
[1:28:40] you which was also in Jesus Christ.
[1:28:51] He says, "Until that day that a great
[1:28:53] percent of the church that call
[1:28:54] themselves Christians would stay home
[1:28:56] from prayer meeting on a Wednesday night
[1:28:59] uh or a Friday night to get to see some
[1:29:02] favorite program or somebody from
[1:29:03] Hollywood or somewhere that oughten to
[1:29:06] even be on the screen, maybe living with
[1:29:09] three or four husbands or wives and
[1:29:12] carrying on and living all kinds of
[1:29:14] lives and go out to drunk parties and
[1:29:17] smoking and lying and everything that
[1:29:19] can be done that's wrong.
[1:29:22] I'm almost ashamed to say this over this
[1:29:24] pullpit,
[1:29:26] but I became aware and I have not read
[1:29:29] anything. I just became aware
[1:29:32] that there's a there's a I don't know
[1:29:34] whether it's a company, but there's a a
[1:29:37] a man and his organization right in
[1:29:39] Hollywood
[1:29:41] and his whole business is set up if
[1:29:44] somebody wants to have a party.
[1:29:47] They can just tell them what kind of
[1:29:48] party they want. We want to have a big
[1:29:51] whoopdedoo.
[1:29:53] We want to have a party. We've got big
[1:29:55] guys coming. We've got we got
[1:29:58] celebrities coming. It's all celebrities
[1:30:00] we want. And he described, and I did not
[1:30:03] even read it, but he described how vile
[1:30:07] and how vulgar, how evil, and how
[1:30:10] wicked, and how perverted they wanted.
[1:30:13] And he get it just as perverted as they
[1:30:15] want,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And all they have to do is order it like
[1:30:18] you order a wedding cake or you order
[1:30:20] something else. They just order that
[1:30:22] kind of party and he and he produces all
[1:30:25] the people for it.
[1:30:28] If they said they want them naked,
[1:30:31] they'll be there naked.
[1:30:33] I'm talking about naked.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; If he wants beauties, beautiful
[1:30:38] celebrities, if he wants the most
[1:30:39] beautiful girls in the country, he'll
[1:30:42] produce them. And however many they
[1:30:44] want,
[1:30:46] that's Hollywood.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And you think God's going to preserve
[1:30:49] that place? He's going to let it go
[1:30:51] below the bottom of this ocean.
[1:30:56] And quite frankly, I can't wait till it
[1:30:58] happens.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And people have, you know, people get
[1:31:02] nervous about being a believer here on
[1:31:04] the West Coast or whatever more. I tell
[1:31:06] you, if you're in the middle of God's
[1:31:08] will, if you know that God brought you
[1:31:10] to a certain place, you just give your
[1:31:12] whole heart, soul, and body to the God
[1:31:14] that called you, you're the you're safer
[1:31:16] than anybody.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; If you're in the middle of God's will,
[1:31:21] the atomic bomb could drop right on your
[1:31:23] head. you're safer than the other people
[1:31:26] that got bomb shelters or whatever. Do
[1:31:28] you believe what I'm saying?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This is not a spur of the moment.
[1:31:32] Friends say
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; they shouldn't even be on a screen
[1:31:39] living with three or four husbands
[1:31:42] or wives and carrying on and and living
[1:31:45] all kinds of lives and go out drunk
[1:31:47] parties and smoking and lying and
[1:31:49] everything that can be done. That's
[1:31:50] wrong. And our churches are fashioning
[1:31:53] And our churches are fashioning their
[1:31:55] yourself. Even our dress in this day
[1:31:58] becomes after Hollywood. What a pity
[1:32:02] it's got to be. That our minds, our
[1:32:05] minds, our minds,
[1:32:07] let this mind. That's what the scripture
[1:32:10] says. Let this mind. It's not this mind
[1:32:14] that came out of Hollywood. I'm trying
[1:32:16] to trying to just show the people today
[1:32:18] and whoever is listening or whoever will
[1:32:20] hear it that Satan is using every
[1:32:22] possible enticement and they and in fact
[1:32:25] as he makes it look glamorous on on on
[1:32:28] top it's not glamorous underneath it's
[1:32:31] vile
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; it's wicked
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; and Satan is wanting to get the human
[1:32:36] mind because that's the battleground
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; he said even our dress in this day
[1:32:44] becomes after Hollywood. What a pity
[1:32:46] it's got to be that our minds think and
[1:32:50] can't stay pure and holy with Christ. He
[1:32:53] said it's done something to the church.
[1:32:55] And I have this double underlined here
[1:32:58] highlighted. It's done something to the
[1:33:00] church. It's crippled it.
[1:33:04] And it's done a horrible thing. All of
[1:33:07] our papers and everything just seems to
[1:33:09] be corrupted. But listen friends, it's
[1:33:12] in the hour of corruption that the time
[1:33:15] of corrup and the time of corruption
[1:33:18] that God draws himself a bride. Listen
[1:33:22] to what he's saying. It's in that time.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And he said another place, why is it so
[1:33:28] dark? Because the light has arrived and
[1:33:32] it's compressing the darkness back to
[1:33:34] where it come from.
[1:33:38] The message came to send this darkness
[1:33:40] back to hell
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; because it came from hell and the light
[1:33:45] is going to send it back to hell.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of glory.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; God in the beginning didn't say let
[1:33:55] there be darkness. No, that was dark. He
[1:33:58] said let there be light.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And what's the scripture say? And there
[1:34:03] was light.
[1:34:08] Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; And he said it's he uses the word it's
[1:34:12] compressing the darkness
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; back to where it came from.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; And he said it's in the hour of
[1:34:22] corruption.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; So this doesn't put a cloud over my day
[1:34:26] when I hear how wicked, how vile. I say
[1:34:29] fill your cup.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Be as wicked. go after all of your stuff
[1:34:34] and the filth and all the rest of it
[1:34:36] because my prophet has said in that
[1:34:39] hour. Hallelujah. In that hour, he's
[1:34:43] going to call a bride out of it. Why?
[1:34:45] Because that makes him more powerful.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; He's showing the victory of Calvary
[1:34:51] again. when Satan, his enemy, was
[1:34:54] defeated and turned loose and he's gone
[1:34:57] out to to deceive the whole world in the
[1:35:00] church world and everywhere. He's
[1:35:03] defeated. He's He's deceived it. And in
[1:35:06] that hour, God calls his bride out.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'll tell you what, God,
[1:35:13] he pulls one over on Satan because right
[1:35:15] in the middle of that filth, there isn't
[1:35:17] anybody that could think anything could
[1:35:19] come out of there pure. But he calls out
[1:35:21] a pure one because it's by the power of
[1:35:23] his blood that was shed back there that
[1:35:26] she's absolutely spotless without spot
[1:35:29] and without wrinkle or any such thing.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:40] Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; But it's in that hour
[1:35:44] God draws himself a bride that comes out
[1:35:47] of that corruption. And that's why he's
[1:35:50] looking and that's what he's looking for
[1:35:52] to get a church that's called by his
[1:35:54] name. Somebody that looks for life
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; that has no end.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] I was and I was so touched by some of
[1:36:09] these things.
[1:36:12] Brother Benham says his seventh vision
[1:36:15] when he told this he said five of them
[1:36:17] are already been fulfilled
[1:36:20] and he said I see in the United States
[1:36:21] as one smoldering
[1:36:24] burnt over place
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; and it will be near the end.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; That's in combination by representation.
[1:36:32] The very thing that turned this age
[1:36:34] lukewarm
[1:36:36] came out of Hollywood
[1:36:39] spewed all over the entire world from
[1:36:41] the theater into their homes
[1:36:44] and now into the hand or the pocket or
[1:36:46] the purse
[1:36:48] and we all have that. That's why the age
[1:36:52] this age had to be called to live
[1:36:57] the life of Jesus Christ in the midst of
[1:36:59] all of this.
[1:37:03] And he says in the angel in the
[1:37:05] commission now he said just shake
[1:37:08] yourself a little bit and pinch your
[1:37:10] minds or pinch your inside part. See
[1:37:14] what he's saying to the people back
[1:37:16] then. You know how early he was saying
[1:37:18] it
[1:37:20] 60 years ago.
[1:37:24] He was telling the people to pinch your
[1:37:25] mind, trying to get them to see they
[1:37:29] didn't they didn't even dream of the
[1:37:31] stuff that you and I have today.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; They didn't even dream that that would
[1:37:37] exist.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Look how far we've come in just a very
[1:37:42] short time.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] I'm going to start at about slide five.
[1:37:54] Well, no. No. Let's say I'll just I'll
[1:37:57] just run through this with you. Can we
[1:37:58] dim the lights a wee bit
[1:38:04] now? If id had time and we'll leave it
[1:38:06] for another time.
[1:38:09] But when you think of the
[1:38:12] no doubt every person here can identify
[1:38:14] some hardship or some trial and brother
[1:38:17] Kyle you were just praying and there was
[1:38:19] it was silent in the study because the
[1:38:22] volume wasn't on
[1:38:25] and I just reached up and turned the
[1:38:26] volume on and you were in prayer and you
[1:38:28] were saying in the trials
[1:38:30] and these emotional upheavalss
[1:38:33] that was the first phrase that came over
[1:38:36] and it was such a confirmation
[1:38:38] and then you went on and someone else
[1:38:40] has made a reference to it. There isn't
[1:38:42] anybody and under the sound of my voice
[1:38:45] and and the enemy would like us to
[1:38:47] think, well, mine's the worst. Mine's
[1:38:49] the worst. I don't know whether I'll
[1:38:50] make it. Yeah, you'll make it.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You want to start rejoicing in the face
[1:38:54] of it.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; It's in this very hour.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; It's at this very time that God wants to
[1:39:00] prove himself.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a coward. I'm not
[1:39:03] going to cower to this stuff. the ages.
[1:39:06] The saints came through it all and we're
[1:39:08] going to go through it all.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But you're living in the midst of
[1:39:16] devastation.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And the and the instruction which we
[1:39:20] read today in Titus, and I'm just
[1:39:22] drawing it quickly to a close, but now I
[1:39:24] want you to notice in view of what I've
[1:39:27] spoken.
[1:39:28] Speak thou the things which become sound
[1:39:31] doctrine. Not easy.
[1:39:35] We speak all kinds of stuff.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; That's a message in itself. Be sober or
[1:39:40] be vigilant or be watchful. Be
[1:39:42] temperate, grave, sound in faith and in
[1:39:45] charity and in patience. Be in behavior
[1:39:48] as becometh holiness. Speaking to the
[1:39:51] women, not false accusers. Not even not
[1:39:53] given to much wine. Teachers of good
[1:39:56] things.
[1:39:57] To be sober. To love their husbands. Not
[1:40:00] easy sometime. To love their children.
[1:40:03] Not easy. Sometime
[1:40:06] you say, "Well, what does it take?"
[1:40:08] Probably, you know, some chastening.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get two. Be discreet,
[1:40:17] chase, keepers at home.
[1:40:20] Is this all right?
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I read the scripture.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Good, obedient to their own husbands at
[1:40:24] the word of God be not blasphemed. Young
[1:40:27] men likewise. Young man,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Almighty God's addressing the young men.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Likewise, exhort to be sober minded or
[1:40:37] vigilant, watchful in all things,
[1:40:39] showing thyself a pattern of good works
[1:40:42] in doctrine, showing unccorruptness,
[1:40:44] gravity, sincerity. You want to read
[1:40:47] Titus the 2 chapter and just you'll when
[1:40:50] you get to the end of it, you won't find
[1:40:51] it to be just all that simple and easy.
[1:40:57] Why doesn't this want to go to the next
[1:40:59] one?
[1:41:04] All right.
[1:41:07] Sound speech that cannot be condemned,
[1:41:11] and that he that is of the contrary part
[1:41:14] might be ashamed, having no evil thing
[1:41:16] to say of you.
[1:41:19] Exhort servants to be obedient to their
[1:41:21] own masters and to please them well in
[1:41:24] all things, not answering again, not
[1:41:27] perlloining, but showing all good
[1:41:29] fidelity that they may adorn the
[1:41:32] doctrine of God our savior in all things
[1:41:39] teaching us. I'll just skip that one,
[1:41:42] please. Let's go to All right. Well, you
[1:41:45] can read this. Uh, teaching is that word
[1:41:49] which I was giving you. To learn, to
[1:41:50] teach, to instruct, to train children,
[1:41:53] to be instructed, to cause one to learn,
[1:41:55] to chastise with words or to instruct
[1:41:58] with words, to correct of those who are
[1:42:00] molding the character of others by
[1:42:02] reproof and admonition. Now, listen, I I
[1:42:06] know we have uh teenagers and children
[1:42:08] and you young people and kids here. If
[1:42:12] you got a godly parent or a godly
[1:42:14] person, just might be an elder in the
[1:42:17] church, someone older than yourself,
[1:42:20] might be an older young man, and they're
[1:42:22] telling you or your parents especially,
[1:42:26] and they're telling you, I want to I
[1:42:28] want to speak to all all the people
[1:42:31] here.
[1:42:35] Listen to that sound advice.
[1:42:38] And if it it kind of puts a kink into
[1:42:40] your, you know, into your way of doing
[1:42:42] things and so on, you just surrender to
[1:42:46] it. If it's a good godly council, you
[1:42:50] just surrender to it because
[1:42:54] it's it's for our benefit.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's for our benefit.
[1:42:59] I just want to show a little bit of
[1:43:01] destruction here. Uh
[1:43:04] we don't need any notes.
[1:43:10] Brother Bramman talks about nothing but
[1:43:11] smoldering stumps. This is what man has
[1:43:14] done.
[1:43:16] There's two boys up there.
[1:43:21] I don't know where they lived.
[1:43:24] Probably doesn't exist today or when
[1:43:27] they when they're looking at it.
[1:43:34] That's a lot of apartments.
[1:43:38] That's a lot of buildings. That's what
[1:43:40] man did. He just dropped that man in a
[1:43:45] piece of tin.
[1:43:47] I didn't want to be too dramatic, but
[1:43:49] you ought to hear brother Brham speaking
[1:43:52] from a pulpit and talking about the
[1:43:55] other dimension that he's in and
[1:43:57] describing describing the very the very
[1:44:01] makeup describing the appearance of
[1:44:03] demons as they've left people.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:06] someone with long hair hanging down over
[1:44:08] their legs like that. And he he brings
[1:44:11] out the one that's epileptic and he
[1:44:14] describes that demon. And he describes a
[1:44:16] a demon of oppression.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; You know, we have all kinds of nice this
[1:44:21] civilization has given you nice legal
[1:44:24] phrases, has given you nice medical
[1:44:26] phrases. Don't forget in all likelihood
[1:44:30] it's a devil.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. And in that other
[1:44:35] dimension, it's much more real than
[1:44:38] these bombed out cities.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And he's out to destroy the battleground
[1:44:43] of the mind.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; I hope you can see what I'm talking
[1:44:47] about, friends.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Battleground.
[1:44:58] You got one right here.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Battleground. That's right.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to put thoughts there.
[1:45:05] He wants to inspire you to think about
[1:45:07] the wrong things. And if you think about
[1:45:09] the wrong things, you'll likely say the
[1:45:11] wrong things. And if you say the wrong
[1:45:13] things and think the wrong things,
[1:45:15] you'll likely do the wrong things. And
[1:45:17] that's exactly what he's desiring to do.
[1:45:20] And I'm appealing with everything that's
[1:45:22] in me. Resist the devil.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Resist him at his first at his first
[1:45:28] inclination of being around you. And
[1:45:30] sometimes you just feel so, well, it's
[1:45:32] kind of a down day. It's not just a down
[1:45:34] day. It's a devil day.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; These are all different places. These
[1:45:49] are different countries.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; These are places that were invaded.
[1:45:59] And I don't want you to go home unless
[1:46:02] you have this thought. God sent the
[1:46:06] spirit of Elijah to tell a country who
[1:46:09] had never experienced this.
[1:46:12] And when they had 911,
[1:46:15] the whole country,
[1:46:18] you you fly on an airplane,
[1:46:22] take off your shoes, take off your belt,
[1:46:25] remove everything out of your pocket.
[1:46:29] And I'm insulted
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; when they make you walk in, hold your
[1:46:33] hands up in the air, and you're
[1:46:35] essentially stripped naked.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; You folks might as well say, "Amen."
[1:46:40] That's exactly the truth.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You talk about taking your liberties
[1:46:49] away.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; You talk about going against the word of
[1:46:52] God.
[1:46:55] I doubt very much whether that is
[1:46:58] appealing to God.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And I have spoken. My wife says, "Don't
[1:47:02] say anything." I said, "Well, I have
[1:47:04] to."
[1:47:06] And I go through, I have a pretty much a
[1:47:08] common phrase. If I can get some of
[1:47:09] their ears, I say, "You can thank 19
[1:47:12] Arabs."
[1:47:14] And they think I'm some wacko.
[1:47:19] I never did this. Take off my shoes
[1:47:22] every time. It's harder to do. And take
[1:47:24] off your jacket. Put it in a tray. Put
[1:47:27] off your your computer over in another
[1:47:29] tray. Take out all the metal. Got any
[1:47:30] coin. What? What is that? That's just my
[1:47:32] billfold. Take hold it in your hand. Or
[1:47:34] put it in a tray. And then you go on and
[1:47:38] I forgot my passport. I forgot
[1:47:39] something. And they yell you left
[1:47:42] something. Well, I got so many trays
[1:47:44] full of stuff. Hey, you might say, well,
[1:47:46] that's just Oh, no. It's not just that.
[1:47:49] It's part of this age.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; It all had a beginning someplace.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And when America lost their two world
[1:47:57] towers, it changed life for everybody
[1:48:00] forever.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; That is absolutely the truth, friends.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; I'm over my time, but I just want to
[1:48:09] punch this home. And that's the worst.
[1:48:12] And and you could say it. It's just I
[1:48:14] I've watched those films and the and the
[1:48:17] documentary they've done on it and to
[1:48:19] see 110 stories. I've been in New York.
[1:48:23] I've been in the 58th floor. I think of
[1:48:25] the of the Panama building and looking
[1:48:28] right out over the Hudson River and so
[1:48:30] on. It was just phenomenal. I can't
[1:48:32] imagine what was it to be up a 110
[1:48:34] stories and have that thing implode on
[1:48:37] itself and come down and the second one
[1:48:40] come down. And not only the second one,
[1:48:42] there's others that don't talk very much
[1:48:44] about.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Say, is this a message? Yeah, that's a
[1:48:50] message.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; That's that's
[1:48:54] feel it. This the first time it's come
[1:48:58] to America. No, it's not the first time.
[1:49:01] If America had recognized it, she had a
[1:49:04] prophet raise up and speak of the
[1:49:06] invasion of America.
[1:49:09] That's right.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And he even said where the seat was and
[1:49:12] the devil sits there in Hollywood
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; and he's going to spew the stuff out
[1:49:17] until people's minds the real
[1:49:19] battleground. It's not the battleground
[1:49:22] of United States. It's not the soil of
[1:49:25] United States. You're much more precious
[1:49:27] than the dirt.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; This dirt's more precious than the dirt
[1:49:32] of Canada, United States, or any state
[1:49:34] in the union. I hope you don't think I'm
[1:49:36] off my
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; rocker.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I'm saying things because it's been
[1:49:45] inside for a long time.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And people have been waiting. When do
[1:49:50] you think that the seventh vision is is
[1:49:52] going to be fulfilled? You might say,
[1:49:54] "Are you telling us that it's already
[1:49:56] fulfilled?" Well, I would I would cast
[1:49:59] my vote on the battleground of the mind
[1:50:02] over this one. Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; This one's not hard to figure out.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; This one, there's not much deception to
[1:50:13] this one.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; But when you have a battleground that's
[1:50:16] worse than that and it's already around
[1:50:19] you and you don't think anything's
[1:50:21] wrong, that to me is a a battleground
[1:50:24] that Satan has done.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; And what do you think the mind looks
[1:50:31] like? What do you think this
[1:50:32] battleground looks like when the prophet
[1:50:34] says the streets will be full of
[1:50:35] neurotics,
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; insane people?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; What made them that way?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; The civilization
[1:50:46] that Satan, the god of this evil age,
[1:50:49] has done.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; I think this is
[1:50:54] one that Hbomb, as far as you can see,
[1:50:56] there's nothing.
[1:51:03] I could have showed you the picture
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; actually of the of the bomb. Doesn't
[1:51:10] look very dangerous. There's a great big
[1:51:13] round canister
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; maybe from here to the wall along just
[1:51:18] picking it up with a A-frame hoist and
[1:51:22] loading it on the plane. And before that
[1:51:25] trip was over, that's what they had.
[1:51:29] And I'm I'm pretty well done, friends.
[1:51:31] It's a a sobering thought, but you have
[1:51:34] you you're going to walk out of this
[1:51:36] building tonight with a battleground.
[1:51:39] And God is providing you some
[1:51:41] protection.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; God is providing you with equipment. God
[1:51:46] is providing you with artillery that is
[1:51:48] greater than anything that man has
[1:51:50] conceived.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; God has given you the protection for
[1:51:54] your soul,
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; body, mind. Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Glory. Let's have the musicians. I
[1:52:04] My went way over my time. Sorry.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't think we're going to
[1:52:18] turn that corner, did you? When we
[1:52:21] started out.
[1:52:25] I want to stand. Come, brother Derek.
[1:52:27] And I want us to sing standing on the
[1:52:29] promises of God, my savior.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; And friends, if you think for a minute
[1:52:36] that this is just something that's just
[1:52:38] casual, no, it's not something that's
[1:52:40] just casual because the prophet spoke
[1:52:43] all kinds of things. He spoke volumes
[1:52:46] about this. And I'm not not I'm I'm just
[1:52:50] alerting. I'm saying it to you as
[1:52:51] believers because you encounter this.
[1:52:54] You encounter it where you work. You
[1:52:56] encounter it in your family. You
[1:52:58] encounter with your children. And let's
[1:53:01] claim the promises of God.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And if we don't, I fear for those that
[1:53:06] claim themselves as believers. We've got
[1:53:09] to claim we've got to claim our victory
[1:53:12] over these things. And we have to be
[1:53:14] aggressive about it. We have to be
[1:53:16] absolutely stalwart about it.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I'm wanting to encourage you with faith.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] And quite frankly, I want to see the
[1:53:26] young people of this congregation rise
[1:53:28] up and and and say, you know, there's
[1:53:30] something for me to do. And I don't know
[1:53:32] exactly what it is, but I'm going to I'm
[1:53:35] going to give and surrender up my
[1:53:36] energy. I'm going to be uh I'm going to
[1:53:39] be vigilant. I'm going to be alert. I'm
[1:53:41] going to encourage others. I'm going to
[1:53:43] be example to others. And I don't know
[1:53:45] what God's going to do with me, but I'm
[1:53:47] making myself available.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; All right, let's stand.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Standing on the promises of Christ my
[1:54:03] king.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Through eternal ages, let his praises
[1:54:08] ring. Glory in the highest. I will shout
[1:54:12] and sing.
[1:54:14] Standing on the promises of God. Listen
[1:54:18] now. Standing.
[1:54:20] I'm standing.
[1:54:23] Standing on the promises of God, my
[1:54:26] Savior. Standing.
[1:54:29] I'm standing.
[1:54:33] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[1:54:38] Standing on the promises. They cannot
[1:54:41] fail. When the howling storms of doubt
[1:54:45] and fear must sail, by the living word
[1:54:49] of God, I shall prevail. I'm standing on
[1:54:53] the promises of God.
[1:54:56] Standing.
[1:54:58] I'm standing.
[1:55:01] Standing on the promises of God, my
[1:55:04] savior. Standing.
[1:55:08] Standing.
[1:55:11] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[1:55:16] Standing on the promises I now can see
[1:55:21] perfect
[1:55:22] in the blood for me. Standing in the
[1:55:27] liberty where Christ free standing on
[1:55:31] the promises of God.
[1:55:34] Stand me, stand me. Standing on the
[1:55:40] promises of God my savior. Stand
[1:55:47] me.
[1:55:49] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[1:55:54] Standing on the promises of Christ my
[1:55:57] Lord.
[1:55:59] How to live eternally by strong. We're
[1:56:04] overcoming daily with the spirit. So
[1:56:07] we're standing on the promises of God.
[1:56:12] I'm standing
[1:56:15] standing
[1:56:17] standing on the promises of God my
[1:56:20] savior. Stand me. Stand me.
[1:56:27] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[1:56:32] I want to send you from this place
[1:56:33] tonight, friends, not having just
[1:56:36] preached a
[1:56:38] uh service, showed you a few uh pictures
[1:56:42] of this devastation.
[1:56:47] There were some that I I wasn't able to
[1:56:49] show.
[1:56:52] because it's just so horrific.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And I often wonder I often wonder
[1:57:00] what what brother Brandham I wish he was
[1:57:03] standing here. I wonder what he was
[1:57:04] actually seeing when he was trying to
[1:57:07] describe to the people
[1:57:11] the spirits that were holding him in
[1:57:13] another realm.
[1:57:15] And I'm saying that to cause this
[1:57:18] congregation to be thankful, to rejoice,
[1:57:22] to love him more deeply that he's
[1:57:25] preserved you from that scene.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly
[1:57:42] Father,
[1:57:45] thank you for the armor.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the helmet of salvation.
[1:57:52] Thank you for the breastplate of faith,
[1:57:54] oh God, that can quench every fiery dart
[1:57:57] of the enemy. Thank you, oh God, that we
[1:58:00] are girded about our loins with truth
[1:58:03] and we're shaw with the preparation of
[1:58:05] the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not
[1:58:08] afraid to make footprints. Not afraid to
[1:58:10] walk forward, oh God. And as I stand
[1:58:13] here and think of the years, Father, and
[1:58:15] the things that you have allowed me to
[1:58:17] experience, oh God, even from the youth,
[1:58:20] Lord, that I able to look down into the
[1:58:23] faces of these lovely young people, oh
[1:58:26] God, and be able to declare to them that
[1:58:29] there is no life like this life. This is
[1:58:32] the greatest gift that could be given to
[1:58:35] be given eternal life. and here in this
[1:58:37] life to be an example to be a
[1:58:39] representation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:58:42] darkest of all ages. Oh God, and your
[1:58:46] prophet saying that this would be the
[1:58:48] age he would choose to live in. And here
[1:58:51] we are. He has departed. He's he's
[1:58:54] fulfilled his calling. Whatever, oh God,
[1:58:56] you called for him to do. And here we
[1:58:59] are left with this message. We will not
[1:59:01] fail. Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:59:04] Christ, we'll lay hold of the sword of
[1:59:06] the word of of God. We'll use it in the
[1:59:09] daytime. We'll use it when we're
[1:59:11] confronted with the enemy. We'll use it,
[1:59:13] Lord, when the wrong thoughts come.
[1:59:15] We'll use it when sickness comes. We'll
[1:59:18] use it, Lord, when when infirmities come
[1:59:20] and all manner of things come. We'll use
[1:59:23] the sword of the word of God. We're
[1:59:26] thankful, Lord, not just for the Bible
[1:59:28] that millions and millions of people
[1:59:30] read, but you have given an
[1:59:32] interpretation to it. And so few have
[1:59:35] that. And some that do have it are not
[1:59:38] making access. They're not taking the
[1:59:40] the the access that they have to it.
[1:59:43] Lord, I pray that you will give them
[1:59:46] such a hunger. Father, oh God, give them
[1:59:50] such a hunger in the name of our Lord
[1:59:52] Jesus Christ. I pray that you'll bless
[1:59:55] the people, Father, and send them from
[1:59:57] this place with a great thankfulness
[2:00:00] within themselves that they've been
[2:00:02] called into this way. And may they go
[2:00:06] with this thanksgiving within them. I
[2:00:08] pray, Father, you'll watch over our
[2:00:10] homes. Watch over the people as they
[2:00:13] drive along the highway. You'll protect
[2:00:15] them from every evil, oh God. How we
[2:00:18] pray that every devil will be made
[2:00:20] subjective and that you'll cast him to
[2:00:22] the earth. You'll grind him down, oh
[2:00:25] God, in the name of Jesus Christ through
[2:00:27] your people. We thank you, Father, in
[2:00:30] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Over every affliction.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Over every temptation.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. over every pressure that you're
[2:00:53] going through,
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; there's victory in our Lord Jesus
[2:00:56] Christ.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of the Lord
[2:01:01] Jesus. And Lord willing, we'll see you
[2:01:04] here on the Lord's day.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Prayer meeting on Friday night and and
[2:01:09] come come Sunday and be in be in prayer
[2:01:12] for the meetings, will you?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for staying 15
[2:01:18] 20 minutes over the time. You're
[2:01:20] dismissed in Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
