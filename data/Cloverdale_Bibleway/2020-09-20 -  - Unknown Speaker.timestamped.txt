[1:26] a true christian life belongs to you
[1:30] you can't live the life somebody already

[1:39] in there and humbled like brother murphy
[1:41] lived there
[1:43] you can live there too the prophets are
[1:46] living in there
[1:47] jesus christ to believe that they are
[1:49] all the sins of the old
[1:51] they live there that belongs to them
[1:57] sky still the sky
[2:00] used to be dangerous used to be too far
[2:05] a true experience with the lord is too
[2:07] far
[2:09] but all of sudden the mother eagle
[2:12] start to fly that gave an example
[2:17] that give a heart they give a courage
[2:21] to that little eagle that you can
[2:24] make your life simpler
[2:29] yesterday when i was preparing it i was
[2:32] crying when i was thinking about that
[2:33] and here we go
[2:34] i said lord that is me
[2:38] i used to be in the denomination just
[2:40] thinking about
[2:42] oh all christian life and just go to
[2:45] church
[2:47] pick up a bible got some spiritual book
[2:50] i started reading it and try to live a
[2:52] good life
[2:55] until i saw the prophet's message
[3:00] it's not some it's not just some word
[3:04] but it's the one can lift the word
[3:07] if the one can fly can soaring in the
[3:11] sky
[3:12] can take a hold of the promise of a god
[3:14] and make it come to pass
[3:16] can bring the heavenly atmosphere down
[3:19] down the earth
[3:21] and that word created an atmosphere
[3:23] around me
[3:25] and i said lord i want that and i take
[3:28] that inside of me
[3:30] and i start to believe it and then the
[3:32] words start to live it out
[3:34] and my wife started to come in none of
[3:37] my children
[3:38] then i go to china then i saw the
[3:41] believers
[3:42] i put my heart out i give the what is
[3:45] the living
[3:46] world becoming real to me and i saw one
[3:48] after another
[3:50] and then we translated a message because
[3:53] something was pushing
[3:54] then we translated the bible what has
[3:57] the lord has done
[3:59] there is some ego flying in the sky
[4:03] that i know that's for me
[4:06] the healing is for me the deliverance
[4:09] for me
[4:10] to live a victorious life that's it for
[4:13] me it's not for somebody else
[4:15] but that's for me amen
[4:19] i made a little poem i hope it's not
[4:22] something to chinese there is always a
[4:28] sky
[4:31] but no ego to fly
[4:36] there are always a clouds passing by
[4:40] but is that ego cannot fly
[4:44] they said no one can overcome sin
[4:51] because no one have ever tried till one
[4:56] day
[4:58] i heard a prophecy scream
[5:04] it woke me up from my heavenly dream
[5:11] i spread my wind
[5:15] to the heavenly place
[5:19] by responding to the message
[5:22] of god's grace
[5:26] shall we stand
[5:47] but verma said an invisible unit
[5:52] that i tell you just as
[5:55] the ego recognized that voice
[5:58] so does a real born-again christian
[6:02] recognize the voice of a god
[6:07] speaking through the word
[6:11] when they see an anointed and vindicated
[6:16] look and look it up there
[6:20] he didn't see his old hand cut clock
[6:23] around here
[6:24] so john doesn't go here go over here and
[6:27] go this
[6:28] and go to this and that
[6:32] he saw a being
[6:35] like he wanted it to be
[6:39] sailing in this air screaming
[6:43] free up in the highs
[6:48] above all the vultures and things of the
[6:51] earth
[6:53] hallelujah he wanted it to be that
[6:57] because it was in him to be that
[7:02] are you the little ego there is
[7:05] something in you
[7:07] you want to be that sky
[7:11] is means for ego to fly
[7:14] this message is not just mims to read
[7:18] now this is means to listen
[7:22] the church is not just means of the
[7:24] tradition
[7:25] that we're coming over to put up some
[7:28] time
[7:30] the sky is for ego to fly
[7:34] it's for you to experience the freedom
[7:37] the world cannot offer you nothing the
[7:40] world cannot offer you satisfaction
[7:44] the world cannot offer you peace
[7:47] because it doesn't possess peace but
[7:50] peace
[7:51] belongs to the heavenly places
[7:54] god has created a heavenly atmosphere
[7:58] for all of us no matters is in the here
[8:02] what is in watching the screen on the
[8:05] internet
[8:06] or whoever in the future gonna hear this
[8:10] archive
[8:12] god created the sky is for eagle
[8:15] to fly and you are the one
[8:20] shall we bow our head
[8:26] is there anyone that haven't live
[8:30] up to that heavenly realm
[8:35] is there anyone that you feel that in
[8:39] your heart is
[8:40] something is attacking you lord
[8:45] i want to live a victorious christian
[8:48] life
[8:50] lord i want to live a life as a worthy
[8:53] worthy for the gospel
[8:56] i don't want to be a coward i don't want
[8:59] to be around around
[9:02] try to go here and go there
[9:05] lord there's some besetting sin that's
[9:07] in me
[9:09] lord i feel there's something that you
[9:11] want to give it to me
[9:13] but it seems like it's too far
[9:16] it seems like i can never never achieve
[9:22] do you know that when god
[9:25] sent us a message that he intends you
[9:30] to receive it and leave it do you know
[9:34] when god
[9:34] bring the trials the difficulties
[9:37] sometimes darkness
[9:39] before you he intended
[9:42] for that to mold your character you come
[9:45] out
[9:45] victoriously because the sky
[9:50] it means for eagle to fly
[9:54] sometime the sky get dark sometimes the
[9:57] sky might have a storm
[10:00] but still god said i
[10:03] made that i allow that
[10:06] you have a whims just spread your wings
[10:11] just let your face rise up no matter how

[10:32] all of this is before all the eagles
[10:36] can soar it can fly to ceiling
[10:41] that in the sky that you haven't created
[10:45] because that's what it meant to be the
[10:48] lord
[10:50] lord and maybe some they raise up their
[10:53] hand
[10:53] and maybe some of the race upper hand
[10:55] for the purpose
[10:56] [Music]
[10:57] maybe they're not a lived to the
[10:59] privilege of that or to give it to them
[11:02] maybe some deliver they're supposed to
[11:05] live in heavenly
[11:07] but lord it seems like they can only
[11:11] live on the earth some
[11:14] they've been maybe buggled by the sims
[11:18] for years after years the habits the
[11:21] things that are around them
[11:23] has so be they're so intentional to buy
[11:25] it
[11:27] oh god let them understand
[11:31] or they're now in the heavenly
[11:33] atmosphere

[11:36] prophet's voice
[11:38] just take the scream of the eagle the
[11:40] mama eagle that will wake up
[11:43] the character that's already in that
