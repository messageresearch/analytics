TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I will ever gather. I watch from I will shout [music] and I will sing. Sing this once again. My soul and free from all sin. I will sing and redeemed. This world [singing] never gets snow. It seems like I've been here forever. Everything after a while [music] just seems the same. &gt;&gt; But it's time to [music and singing] be up and going. I can feel there's a wind blowing. I'm ready to move. I'm ready to change. And I'm ready [singing] to move. Move on out [music] to another dimension. And I'm ready to change and relocate to another location. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to hold me [singing] here. I'm already out the door. Got the Holy Ghost here to prove I'm ready to move. Everything [music and singing] that I need is in order. Ready now to cross the [singing] border to a brand new [music] bright and fair. &gt;&gt; I hold a little reation. This body's going to see a translation. [music] Moving up to a [singing] [music] move on up to another dimension. [music] I'm ready to change and relocate to another location. [music] There's nothing to hold me [singing] here no more. I'm already out the door. [music and singing] I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove. I'm ready to move. Well, I'm ready to move on to another dimension. And I'm ready to change. Relocate to another [music] location. [singing] There's nothing to hold me here. I'm ready [music] to Holy Ghost. I'm ready to move. Well, I'm ready to move. [music] Move on to another dimension. I'm ready to change and relocate [music] to another location. There's nothing [music and singing] here. I'm already out the door. [music] &gt;&gt; I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove I'm ready to move. &gt;&gt; I' got to prove I'm ready to move. Well, I've got Holy Ghost here to prove I'm ready to move. Ready to move. Ready to move. [applause] &gt;&gt; Ready to move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh, that sounded like about 10% of you. Are you ready to move? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we got some company. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, here we are Saturday evening and uh we have one more service after tonight. It's been a grand time. We have enjoyed so much the fellowship, more than the fellowship, the instruction, the preaching of the word. Wasn't last night wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell you what, uh, put us in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; This evening, our brother Ron Spencer is going to be coming after a little bit, but we're going to be taking up an offering this evening. And the offering this evening is uh going to be somewhat different. I'm going to ask if the deacons could uh and the ushers if they could please make their way to the front. We want to have a word of prayer about the offering. There will be no singing during the offering. I want you to see uh what is taking place in Congo. Our brother Dio is directing uh Shakina Publications. Shakina Publications is doing I think the by far the greatest work for the Frenchspeaking people in the world. and they are working with such efficiency. How it's happening, I cannot I cannot tell you. I've been there several times, but I can't tell you how it happens. How all this equipment and how they're able to support it and how they're able to continue. I know that some of the people have worked for very, very little pay. and these people who you see operating on the equipment uh because we're going to be showing you the operation and instead of music we're going to be having just the ambient sounds. Uh I want you to see the equipment. I want you to see what's happening and so you can look at that and ask God, what would you have me to give towards this work? because the entire offering tonight is going to go to sending the message to the French-speaking peoples and they they also print for uh also some in English and I better not say because there some of the tribal languages and I don't know them all but this is what is happening there and I believe it's u a an an incredible work and no matter what we give tonight I'm quite confident that you will not regret what you give. Uh and if you want to if you're not fully prepared tonight and say, "Well, I once you see this, I would like to give a check. I would like to give a substantial gift." All you have to do is you can uh put it tomorrow in an envelope and we will be having envelopes here tomorrow morning. Tithe and offering envelopes. I'm going to ask them to bring them and have them available. Uh then you can if you just put Congo that's all you have to put on the envelope Congo and we will see that it goes directly to that work 100% of it will go there. So if the deacons I wonder if uh could they come forward please? And we're going to have a word of prayer. Thank you. Why don't we all stand? Heavenly Father, we are your children. You have given us a birth, a new birth, a spiritual birth, a new birth. We are born again. And there are others, many others in different lands, different countries that have received the birth by the spirit and by the word. Lord Jesus, tonight as we contemplate this offering, as we ponder what you have done, why you have chosen this country, this nation of Congo, it's not our thought. It's not our plan but it was your plan. What you have done there we say it is it is something that you have achieved. It is something that has been done supernaturally. It it it functions day by day out of supernatural. It's like bread from heaven as it were that has sustained these people. And I pray that you will bless the people that labor. Oh God, bless the people who sacrifice in that land. Bless the people tonight as they give in this offering. And I pray that you will endure our brother Deoka with wisdom, oh God, that he might know just exactly how to conduct your affairs, Lord. I pray you'll give him Holy Ghost wisdom, Father, not the wisdom of a man, oh God. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you will receive our thanksgiving tonight that we can be a part of this great program. In the name of Jesus, we ask it. bless the offering and the giving and the givers I pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. But I [music] walked upon the just [music] I would do anything. There's no price I would not just give everything. [music] I would give my life away. Yeah. [singing] &gt;&gt; We are now in the printing shop. We have many kinds of machines from to many. Our machines we have some for printing, other for bounding. With all these machines, Shaka missions is now able to print about 1,500,000 books a month. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Well, I never mountain [singing] just to be with you. I do All those dreams are &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Love it. Love what you said. Sea just everything &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; of my love. how I died upon the cross for your with and so you're going to contribute. They he will be able to show them here's people that we're associated with. Here's people who are part who worship like we do. We are not just some single little offshoot all by ourselves. We are connected to a group of people and he can tell them we're connected to the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Brother Dioa, here's the man that's responsible. Amen. God bless you. [applause] You might just want to say a word of greeting or thanksgiving to the people. God bless you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting my uh translator, my interpreter. Waiting for the interpreter. [laughter] I preach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Id like to thank Pastor Ed for this opportunity I have to greet you. &gt;&gt; And especially for the burden he has in his heart to support the missionary work. when I saw what he did yesterday and what he's doing in the rest of the world to support the work of God. &gt;&gt; May God richly bless him. May he bless you also for everything that you're doing to support us in this work. It's true that it's a hard work. &gt;&gt; It's truly difficult as it is in Africa. &gt;&gt; It is done with much difficulty. That is why we are soliciting your prayers. Especially your prayers will be of great support to us. May God bless you much even if there's a lot of opposition &gt;&gt; but as we know this is the word of God the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ we are going to go forward and the Lord will support and sustain his work may God bless you &gt;&gt; and thank you very much thank you very &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the message means to you, but I can tell you I have seen the messages copied by hand on brown paper bags. I've seen the messages uh written out uh handed out one page at a time and then when the people meet for service then they exchange the pages and they have the next one to read. I've seen that. I've seen them all entire messages written by hand so that the people because there was only one printed copy so they had others written out by hand and uh uh brother Hildebrand could tell you many many experiences. I talked to another person today during the minister's uh brunch and they said as soon as we would get a message book we would take it apart, take the staples out and photocopy page by page so we could then get g have a few other copies. You know friends, this has been uh this this message has not come easy and so we who have it should appreciate it and people who have gone to such extremities to get it sometimes walked miles to have it then you know that they really appreciate it. They don't have it sitting like an ornament on their shelf that it is something that means life to them. And and I I trust that when you leave this place tonight, you'll know that your gift has put the book in the hands of somebody who's going to deeply appreciate it because it's not in some of these countries, it's very difficult to get it distributed. And there's people out there to have it. And we just got to find ways to get it to them. And God will. He'll get it to them. But we have our part, too. Amen. Brother Anatoli, please come. This is brother Anatoli say from Usbekistan. God bless you. My dear brothers and sisters, I would like to greet every one of you in the name of Jesus. in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

He knew what it was to sing, be part of a group, and then his life and the way that he had experienced life. Then he came in contact with Jesus Christ, came in contact with the message, and he laid aside everything. He said he didn't want to sing. I don't want to. He needed he felt I just want to be washed by the word. I just want to hear the word. I just want the wa the water of the word to wash me. They don't want any part of the world just to be able to come in purity. And this is maybe the third time he sang. And you know when that was a part of your life, it means something just to lay it down. and you have certain relationships, you just lay it down and say, "This is a whole new life." Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How are you doing, folks? &gt;&gt; You feel like praising the Lord? Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Isn't he worthy? Praise to God. Hallelujah. We're going to have our speaker this evening, our brother Ron uh Spencer to come. And uh brother Ron has blessed us. God has blessed us through brother Ron's ministry. And we are happy for a dedicated life. Happy for very very thrilled to see that God brought and wrought a great deliverance in his life. Amen. And I'd like to have you stand. We want to sing. We place you in the highest place. Like this congregation to lift it up and do what the prophet of God says. Get in the spirit of the meeting. &gt;&gt; If you're not in it yet, let's just do it. Amen. Just get in the spirit of the meeting. Amen. We place you in the highest for you. A [music] great high. Give praise to you. [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; High above all else. &gt;&gt; We worship your feet. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We place you Lord in the highest [music] you only [music] praise you. else [singing] and we will [music] have you join me in a love song to him. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. You can sing that in every language. Sing it in your language. Whatever language you sing, just sing it in your mother tongue. I love him. I [music] love to hear. me. [music] [music and singing] Sing it one more time to [singing] love him Because [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We stand here tonight to recognize the transforming power &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you have a need in this building tonight, won't you just raise your hands to him tonight? We didn't come to see the personality of men, but we come to meet him &gt;&gt; and to have a conference with Jesus Christ. Let's ask him to come to our respective places where we're sitting at tonight. Say, "Father, my door is open. &gt;&gt; You know what I need, Lord Jesus, we bow our heads to the dust of the earth which we came. It is only because you place something on the inside of us &gt;&gt; which is the eternal part of us. &gt;&gt; And dear God, it's a deep calling to the deep tonight. Lord, we are needful for you to come. &gt;&gt; We're needful for you to speak tonight. We're needful for you to walk these aisles, Father. We're needful for you to come to our our pew where we're sitting at. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you'd drive every enemy that has bound us tonight. We pray that you would break every chain and every fed. We pray that we can break through the boundaries, Father, tonight. That Lord, that we could have a conference with you. This meeting has the potential to be the greatest meeting that there has ever been on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; We're one day closer to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And we are the bride that you have been looking for, &gt;&gt; that you predestinated before the foundation of the world. Lord, not only visible but invisible before us tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, through the internet, Lord, we ask you to speak to hearts. Lord, you know our needs. &gt;&gt; And Lord, the greatest gift that any of us could have, whether with the speaker or the hearer, is to get our own ideas out of the way. Get our own personalities out of the way tonight and ask you to manifest yourself &gt;&gt; in this building. We pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Let's just sing another course of that tonight. I [singing] love him. I love him because [music] [singing] Just like, [music] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad that you can love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me tonight to Revelations chapter 19, I feel extremely humbled to stand before you tonight with trembling knees and I am certainly honored that brother Ed would ask me to to be a part of this meeting. I stand before the greatest men that God had predestinated before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And he saved them for the last. &gt;&gt; Many preachers were probably in his mind throughout the eternities through the dawn of time. And he said, "I think I'll save a certain group of men &gt;&gt; with a certain characteristic about them." &gt;&gt; And they stand before us tonight. And maybe you don't have the right kind of respect for these men, but I feel extremely humbled to stand before them tonight to preach not only a message, but something that is extremely dear to my heart. Amen. Brother Tim and I had not talked. We're personal friends, but we had not talked about what we're preaching this week. But he finished last night with Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. It just so happens to be the spot to where I would like to start at tonight. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and verse six. And I heard as it was a voice of a great multitude, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of a mighty thunderings, saying, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reignth." Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the of the saints. And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, these are the true sayings of God. You may be seated. I would like to, if I could title this tonight, I would like to take a thought on the passion of our revival. I remember and as I was thinking earlier today and this week, I remember as a young man sitting in a congregation just newly saved like this young man that was just sung the song here, just newly saved with my new wife, Sister Connie, which is with us tonight. And I was sitting and brother Biscll, it was the first time that I would hear him speak. I'd heard him speak in 1978 at brother Falters and he had preached he took a title on on his experiences and and it always hung with me since that time. And then the next time that I would hear him speak, he he came to a pull pit much like this before a crowd of people like this and not knowing that I was sitting in the congregation, not even knowing that I felt something in my heart. And as as I was sitting and listening, I felt like I was just just transformed sitting in my pew as I heard him preach a sermon called Let Us Run. And as he begin to preach, he he talked about great men of the ages and what their job and their responsibility was and how the great Lord Jesus Christ came and lived in their lives and what a great revival was stirred in their lives. And in the he be to turn to where it was our turn to run. &gt;&gt; Taking the scriptures of Hebrews chapter 11 and reading verse 31 down through the end and coming to chapter 12. And and I'm not going to rehearse that whole sermon for you tonight. But when he turned and he said, "Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which would so easily beset us. Let us run this race with patience. looking unto the author and the finisher of our faith. There was something immediately that was anchored in in my heart because I had not wanted just what my mother and father had. I didn't want just exactly what other people had because if I had what they had, I would have a secondhand experience. But I wanted something new for me. I wanted the same Lord Jesus Christ to come and live inside of my heart &gt;&gt; because I would quickly recognize I could tell the stories of brother Brandham but that was brother Brandham's stories I could tell the stories of maybe brother Bisll but that's brother Biscll's stories tell the stories of brother Tim Puit but that's brother Tim storuit stories but I needed to know that same Lord Jesus Christ and enter into the inner veil for myself. &gt;&gt; I had to recognize the revival of my day &gt;&gt; and what this message personally meant to me. &gt;&gt; If you can imagine of all the writers of the scriptures, the all of them had the same author. All of them were under the direction of the composer. All of them feeling the same spirit of a supernatural God. For they were not writing down the mind of a man, but they were writing down the mind of Almighty God. And if we can just imagine, many people have picked up these Bibles and begin to read. And many of them were great intellectual giants that would try to figure out the scriptures and they would go to the same scriptures like you and I go to Revelations 19 and6. But in no way could they understand what was delivered to us even last night. That how that our deed has been cleared. Our title has been cleared by the blood of the redemption. No longer is it justification that Luther would nail 95 thesis upon a door and shake the world with. When he would say the just shall live by faith that we don't need your rosary beads. We don't need your penance of prayer. We don't need to go through a priest. There's one mediator between God and man, and that is the man Christ Jesus. And he shook the world with a revival. But with the illumination of the light of this day, it's more than just the word justification. But a man like stood and sung or a man like myself that was a drag addict that was addicted to many things of this world could stand here tonight with the revelation of the word and say it was as though I never did it in the first place. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And I can stand and say it because it's not just written down on paper. It's not just brother Brandham's voice. But I most believe it was the redeemer, the blood of Jesus Christ that came and cleansed my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wish I could preach like these guys, but I tell you, for the life of me, I can't. Many pick up the scriptures of 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and it says, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep. that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain. Many generations has stood there and read that scripture believing they were that group. But because of the identification and the characteristics of this age, we can stand here tonight and proclaim. We can stand here tonight and proclaim that we are a part of that group that are alive and remain and we are watching for the coming, the literal coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and go to meet him in the air. &gt;&gt; And we say this to you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout. And we believe he has, don't we? And the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet them when the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. But he continues, "But," which is a conjunction between the past participle and the future. And he says, "But of the times and the season, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly," it becomes a personal revelation. You know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. And when they shall say peace and safety, &gt;&gt; then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with a child, and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, &gt;&gt; that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness. &gt;&gt; I stand here tonight and I read that scripture to you. Many times did rabbis and priests stand and read Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6. Many times did they stand and read, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." But One day a rabbi stood &gt;&gt; and he read that scripture and it was quickened and inspired to a little lady sitting in the congregation and something became incredibly real to her. It was more than just another sermon. It was more than just another thought given by a by a priest. But this day, something happened on the inside of her heart. I believe that there's men of God on the scene as they begin to read these scriptures talking about a rapture. You're not children of the night. &gt;&gt; And we sit amongst a group of people that are not going to be overtaken by the cares of this world. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, what is a revival?" So many people have misconception of what a revival is. A lot of times we think of revival as all emotion. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was standing beside Lake Michigan and he said, he says, "I thought, what does a city jump like that for? Where there's a great mighty rushing wind comes down and causes a revival. That same amount of water, it has the same amount of water, but it's got a revival. What does it do? It floats all the trash up to the floor. &gt;&gt; He says we need a scouring out once in a while. God gives us a revival, a sweeping mighty wind, and he rushes down through the church like that and floats all the trash. &gt;&gt; As we heard last night, it floats all the creeds and the dogmas and all the isms out of our lives. And we're washed by the washing of the word. God purifies us by the Holy Spirit. Even while the word is going forth, the purifying of the blood of Jesus Christ of the Holy Spirit comes through the congregation and begins to reach down in our souls. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could think of revivals and measure revivals and we could look at maybe a revival like when the children of Israel had gone across the land and they had went with Joshua and the scripture says that God spoke to him. It says, "Take sharp knives and circumcise again the children that have been born among you." Maybe we could liken today that you say, "Well, brother Ron, we have no need for a fresh revival. We've had it all of these years." But there's many times children that grows up among us &gt;&gt; and they conform to the message. &gt;&gt; Many people come to church and conform to the church. &gt;&gt; Many people conform to their favorite preacher, but we're not to come together to catch the church's spirit. We're not to come together to catch the pastor spirit. We're not even wanting the spirit of the prophet of the Lord. We're here to catch the spirit of Jesus Christ. These young men had grew up in the message. They had seen the mighty prophet of God. They had heard of all the the great feasts of God through Moses. They had seen the splits of the churches. They had seen the problems that had went on. They had heard about the mana in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; The prophet of the Lord was gone off the scene now. But here stood Joshua. The baptism of the Holy Ghost for our day was standing there leading them. &gt;&gt; And the challenge was made. Circumcise again. &gt;&gt; Circumcise again. I say this to you. If you don't have a a baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight, listen, I pray to God before this meeting is over with. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a supernatural touch of God, Brother Ron, how do I know if I've got it? Does your life produce the works of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; There's one way to measure. Do you have the life? I'm talking about more than knowing the quotes, more than having the pictures, more than having the dress code, more than having the hair do just right, more than having just the right things to say at the right time, but does that pulsation of that bubbling stream down on the inside of you, does it pulsate out of you? &gt;&gt; Do you have to make yourself live it? Do you have to make yourself go to church? Do you have to make yourself pray? Hallelujah. I say this to you tonight. You can have the very life of God. &gt;&gt; There can be such a hunger in your heart that you can't get enough of it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't serve the Lord just because of somebody else. I don't serve him because of my wife. I don't serve him because of my father. I don't serve him because of my friends. I serve him because there's something on the inside of me. A deep calling to the dead. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, Brother Ron, nobody can live that close to the Lord and have that excitement every day." I've got news for you. Once you enter into that inner veil, you enter. Listen, in the Old Testament, they could not go into that inner veil. It was death for them to go in there. But listen, as a believer tonight, as sons and daughters tonight, we it's death if we don't enter inside of there. We can live in constant fellowship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Constant fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ, with our bridegroom. For those that don't like excitable preachers, &gt;&gt; bad night. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Just a word for those that might have a little criticism for excitement. There's there's some quotes that I can give you right now that stillborn children, they're dead. &gt;&gt; And anything without emotion, it's dead. &gt;&gt; Brother Random must had quite a bit of emotion when he was dangling his feet off of off of the pull pit. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram standing and recognizing your day and its message and he says everywhere there's no revival. Now think just for a moment in that day everybody thought they were having revival. He says everywhere there's no revival everybody's complaining ministers crying. I was reading one of the outstanding papers and here comes to the church a very fine paper. I know the editor. I know the people. They're godly people. They're very fine. Brother and sister Moore of the Hurl of His coming. One of the finest papers on the field. The hurl of his coming. But they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast and pray. Fast and pray. Sound a trumpet. He says, "How many reads it?" You know, you see it all the time. Fast and pray. Fast and pray. That's all you hear. Fast and pray. We're going to have a great breaking of the day. There's a great thing that's going to happen. All of you pray. Pray, pray. We're not too late yet. Why do they do that? &gt;&gt; Why do they do that? They want a great awakening. They're crying, believing that there will be an awakening. They're good people. &gt;&gt; Many of your family members that's still wrapped in denominationalism. They're good people. &gt;&gt; He says, "Why is it? What? What have they done? They have not recognized &gt;&gt; the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; See, by feeling the Christ, being a Christian, they feel the pull of the hour, &gt;&gt; but they haven't recognized what has been done. That's what's making them feel that way. They know something is supposed to happen, but they're looking for it way off in the future. I'm afraid too many people still looking for it way off in the future. This has got to happen and this has got to happen and this has got to happen when it's happening right now. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, give me an illustration. Sure will. John 14:11 says, "Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And I and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. And he says, "And whether I go, you know, and the way you know." And Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whether thou goest. And how can we know the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am the way. I am the way, the truth, and the life. And no man cometh unto the Father but by me. And if ye had known me, &gt;&gt; I'm afraid too too many people know, brother Brandham, but they don't know the voice behind the voice. They don't know who this MelzDC really was. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because remember in Exodus chapter 3, God spoke and said, "I am come down." &gt;&gt; And once again in this evening hour, that same Christ has come down. &gt;&gt; And listen, he didn't leave. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't leave. He is here to anoint his work. &gt;&gt; Where is he at? He's not just laying on paper, but he's anointing those predestinated saints. &gt;&gt; The people of the open book, the redeemed ones that stand and say, "I have recognized &gt;&gt; that my name is written in the book. Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. And Jesus said unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet you have not known me? Phillip, he that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? And the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very work's sake. Matthew chapter 16. Jesus was having a little committee meeting with his with his boys and he said, "And when Jesus came to the coast of Cesaria Philippi, and he asked his disciples, saying, whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" Because remember, a revival can't take personally to you until you personally recognize it for yourself. &gt;&gt; You can't do it for your children. Your children have to have their own personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I've been in church 30 years. I believe the message 30 years. Listen, I want to thank God for that. But until that message has come clear to you, &gt;&gt; and that same Christ, it's living in your life. &gt;&gt; It's somebody else's revival and not yours. All right. &gt;&gt; Whom the men say that I the son of man am? And they said some say thou art John the Baptist. Because there was stories going around about a return ministry. Some said Elias, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. And he saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am? &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou [screaming] art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, the seals had been opened to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word had been open to him. Something had taken place in his life. He had seen more than the flesh of a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you recognize it's more than your flesh that's doing this work today. &gt;&gt; When you recognize it's more than your ability that's doing this today. I want you to know then you'll recognize that it is the mighty God that is still doing the work today. &gt;&gt; And he said, I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. You believe that? Tonight, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says, watch what he says just for a moment. This may be just a little lengthy, but I want to I just want to lay some thoughts here. He said, Genesis 1:11 and spoken word is the original seed. Let every seed bring forth of its kind. Simple principle. Cows have cows. Horses have horses. &gt;&gt; Chickens have chickens. Eagles have eagles. And when God wants to reproduce himself, he's going to have sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hybrid corn. It brings forth a big super better crop. Better looking, but it's dead. Plant it back. It can't reproduce itself again. It's done. It's finished. Like Eve, she brought forth a hybrid crop. Look at us today. Look around and see. See that it's true. Sure it did. It wasn't God's purpose. No, sir. just had just have to hold back for something that I'm thinking right now. He said to mix it brings forth a hybrid crop. &gt;&gt; Listen, to mix this message &gt;&gt; brings death into it. &gt;&gt; Listen, Luther's revival was great, but listen, it won't work today. &gt;&gt; Wesley's revival was great. Listen, when he was standing there, the supernatural power of God, 10,000 people standing in a hail storm and the power of God came down and 10,000 people are slain in the spirit of God. That's great for that day. It won't work today. &gt;&gt; The Methodist church denominated and they died. &gt;&gt; To mix it with this message, it will kill it. Pentecost was great at Isuza Street. The Welch revival, it was great for its day. It was the real supernatural hand of God. But to mix it today, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. To mix it today with this fresh mana will bring death to it. &gt;&gt; To mix Dr. Dobson with this message. to mix TD TD Jake. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; To mix Benny Hen. And I'm sorry, but I'm preaching. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, but they're great men. They've got their calling. &gt;&gt; But we're a bride group of people. We're not a church. We're the bride. [cheering] &gt;&gt; We're [screaming] the astronaut age. &gt;&gt; We're to be lifted up. I got news for you. The chicken yard don't satisfy me tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, they got good things to say. But listen, I don't need to dig through all of their hogwash. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Even if they do raise a message book up and say, "This is thus sayaeth the Lord." But when they pan out across their audience, there sits bobt Jezebels, painted face Jezebels. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Random was preaching to those Pentecostals. He said, "I push the word down their throat, put my hands over their mouth, and they still try to spew it out through my fingers. They didn't want it then. They don't want it now. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm looking for something new. Well, listen to the tape again. You'll catch something new. [applause] The more I listen to this day this scriptures fulfilled, the better I like it. The more I listen to indictment, the better I like it. The more I listen to future home about where I'm going to live one of these days, the better I like it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The more that I listen to things that are to be, the more I recognize that's what God was talking to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why each revival, each generation has to have its own. &gt;&gt; It has to have its own revival. &gt;&gt; A chance at the word. Oh, don't you love that tonight? Isn't he good to us? &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I just need something deeper. I don't know if I can go further in the message. Watch what he says. He said Luther refused it. So it is today with every one of them. They failed to take the word. They refuse Christ. And anyone that refuses Christ, a man and his child has no right to be a wife to him. &gt;&gt; He says, you remember in the Bible when the king married Esther because the queen refused, he just got him another. What happened when she refused to come out with the king to obey him? The same thing it is today with a woman that refuses to be a wife to her husband. And so it is with the church that refuses to be compreated &gt;&gt; in the age that we are now to live in. Listen, we're no longer his girlfriend that he's flirting with. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We are now the lamb's wife. He slipped the wedding band a predestinated grace upon us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And we have been invited not just to the kitchen, not just to the living room, but we have been invited to the bedroom [cheering] &gt;&gt; that we might know him. &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you? He says, "We're not Lutheran." &gt;&gt; And the church said, "Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not Wesleyans. &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals." Because remember, Pentecostals was the man age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "We've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word to bring forth a child of this age, the seed child." He says, "I hope that you understand it." &gt;&gt; He says, "Couldn't be impregnated." No. What did he do? He put her away in divorcement, but she dares took him to put her away. He put her away. He went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicated his sane by himself. His children begin to kind of look more like him. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't look like Mama Rome. We don't act like mama wrong. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we had a great revival 50 years ago. I'm glad that you enjoyed that. Brother Ron, you ought to have been here. I wish I could have. I would have liked to been here when brother Brandon preached the seals, &gt;&gt; but he had him here. It was his turn. &gt;&gt; It was his turn. He was sitting in the back of the building and brother Brand says, "You're" He says, "That's not the Amen corner. Come on up here. [laughter] All those guys, those great theologians looked around said, "Who is this Eddie?" &gt;&gt; They looked, "Who is he?" Boy, a boy. Why is Brother Brandon praying him special attention? I'll tell you why. Because God was paying special attention, [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but God didn't call my name. Sure he did. Before the foundation of the world, [applause and cheering] he called your name when you was out in drugs and he loved you. Like Romans 5 said, while you were yet a sinner, alienated from the economy of God, God spoke to you. He knew where you was at. He knew what your condition was. He came personally to you. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Many men hunted with brother Brandham. That didn't give him eternal life. Many men fished with brother Brandham. That didn't give him eternal life. It may have gave him a great name for a while. But listen, it's more than hunting. It's more than fishing. But it's catching the voice that is behind the voice. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Many people come to our churches, but listen until you catch the voice that's behind the voice. &gt;&gt; Until that supernatural God begins to speak directly individually to you, that that word can be made flesh in your life. &gt;&gt; How old do I have to be? Listen, I've got kids in my church that have stood up in their in their school &gt;&gt; and preach serpent seed in kindergarten. I've had little girls that refuse to let the teacher cut their hair and stand there and say, "That's the glory of God." First Corinthians chapter 11. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not how old that you are. It's that something that anchors down in your heart. I love it when threeyear-old children come up and say, "I want that same Jesus that you talk about to come save my mama and come save my daddy." and to watch the transforming power of God and save mama and save daddy. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, God don't do miracles anymore. I got news for you. I walk on two feet tonight that I was paralyzed in 1995 and I wasn't supposed to ever walk again in my life. But God did an incredible miracle laying right in a trauma unit with every vertebrae in my back broken. God came down to my room. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; God don't save anymore. I'm sorry. You're too late. Just in the last few weeks, we've seen four drug addicts come into the church and get transformed by the power of Jesus Christ. We're seeing families reunited. We are seeing the power of God. If your church is dead, try my God. [cheering] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ephesian church age, he said this. I believe the first meeting was about cycles and who how was I to know that I was to end in tonight with this with this with this thought in mind and then we'll carry just a little bit longer. He said, "Nevertheless, that I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love." &gt;&gt; To understand this, you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to just the original saints of Ephesus alone. The message is to the entire age that lasted 120 years. It's the message then it is to all generations in that span. History keeps repeating itself. &gt;&gt; Brother Ronald never happened to me. The greatest robbery that a church ever has is when it loses its vision. The greatest robbery that you will ever have as a personal individual living in Leoa &gt;&gt; is when you come to the place let somebody else go to church and let me stay home. &gt;&gt; I believe I just need to relax. When you start just saying, "Oh, Brother Ron, but I I just need to entertain myself. Brother Ron, I just think I'll let somebody else worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; When we put up the steer crows that we don't have to pray anymore when we put up the steer crows, we we don't want to go back to that that Pentecostal man. I'm afraid somebody will say amen too loud. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid somebody will shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when I get to thinking about what Jesus did for me, [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; when I start thinking about what he's done for my children, &gt;&gt; I get excited. [cheering] When I start thinking about the young people that have walked watched walk watch walk to an altar, &gt;&gt; they had sat for years without an experience from God and become transformed by the power of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and become preachers and become deacons and become anointed and raise families by the power of the Holy Ghost. And this is more than a book. It's more than a tape. It's more than an MP3 player. But it's God living inside of them. [cheering] To me, this is more than a church. This is more than just another meeting. But I believe God in his divine providence said, "I'm going to do some last day gathering. &gt;&gt; I want to shake you out of your leodyian spirit. &gt;&gt; I want to wake you up one more time. I want to stare you. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ron, I'm saved. I'm not questioning that tonight. Brother Ron, I have a sanctified life. I'm not questioning that tonight. But I want to question tonight. How long has it been? &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I received the Holy Ghost 40 years ago. Bless God. But what about tonight? What about tonight? &gt;&gt; Yesterday, man, it will not do you no good today. Brother, used to I did this and used to I did this. What about tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the original flame. He said simply the manifestation. He said then God lights that fire again. And the same process is repeated. He said it's simply the manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, how dare you to challenge my children. &gt;&gt; Yes. How dare me? &gt;&gt; Listen. Because I want you to know if they don't get a supernatural birth with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The first time they hear rock and roll music, it'll they'll go right toward it. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're pushy. Yes, sir. I used to push drugs. &gt;&gt; I used to push the wrong kind of thing, but now I push. &gt;&gt; I push Jesus Christ. [cheering] [applause] Listen, I don't have to work this word up. It's got life of its own. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry out for the reaching out of the spirit of God, all begins to fade. And instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God, it has cooled off and become a bit formal. You think that spirit's died? &gt;&gt; They got all their churches. &gt;&gt; Now we have to be tried by every spirit. &gt;&gt; You have to overcome. It's not enough for your pastor to overcome. &gt;&gt; It's not enough for them to preach this message with all their heart. &gt;&gt; But what about you? &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a gift of giving, but there's a gift of pulling. It'll never come into my church. The very slimy hands of the devil wants to stop every one of our message. &gt;&gt; We can have all the mechanics exactly right and know all the doctrines exactly right, &gt;&gt; but if the life of Jesus Christ don't live, All of that matters nothing. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a proper balance &gt;&gt; to it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are we going to prevail against, brother Ron? Formality, &gt;&gt; fashionable worship. &gt;&gt; The polishing up of the world. Before long, we don't have preachers that's filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We've got quotas. &gt;&gt; Before long, we've got congregations that live any kind of way that they want to. &gt;&gt; But I've got news for you. There's going to be a bride that is without spot or blemish. [applause] &gt;&gt; They're going to look at the word just like Jesus looked at the word. And Jesus believed the word for himself &gt;&gt; when he looked at the word. And we're going to look at the word for ourself. &gt;&gt; And we're going to read where it says, "You're a super race, a super church. You're an invincible army upon the earth. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; We are going to look at this word, our script. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at our script and see where it says shall be bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. &gt;&gt; Who is that? Me. &gt;&gt; You. God is not going to rapture this paper. He's not going to rapture these screens. He's not going to rapture these pews. He's going to rapture human vessels. [cheering] &gt;&gt; That God has emptied them of their humanity. He's emptied them. He's took all of their sins away. &gt;&gt; Satan, the accuser of the brethren, he remembers what you used to be. But the lamb who is worthy stepped forth from the throne. He took the book. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Your original auto autobiography had a lot of bad stuff written in there. &gt;&gt; Yours was like Abraham rolling around on the ground and laughing at God. &gt;&gt; Yours was like Abraham. You were liars. &gt;&gt; The children were liars. Yours was like Jacob. None of us would have picked Jacob. &gt;&gt; But probably people sitting in your pew wouldn't have picked you &gt;&gt; 25 years ago. You wouldn't have wanted to hear me and Tom preach. You can't imagine a boy being redheaded with long hair down his back standing before you tonight with a transforming power. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Don't throw your nose in the air and say, "I never did that." I've got news for you. God just gave me an illumination of what predestination was and real justification was. &gt;&gt; And remember, it took just as much blood for you as it did for me. [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. And when so I when I read a quote, it says, "It was as though you never did it in the first place." and sa and Satan begins to go down through my memory channel and reminds me of this and reminds me of this and reminds me of this and reminds me of this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I shake those chains off. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was part of a bootleggger's family. &gt;&gt; Most of his family is in jail tonight. But I want you to understand tonight, he was not so proud of mom and daddy, but he was proud of his heavenly father. I'm not so proud of my past history. But Jesus Christ rewrote my book. He took my claim. He took my redemption. [cheering] Satan wars with you in your mind. He wars with you. He torments you. You've got the picture the wrong way. You are sent here to torment the devil. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You are sent here to create an atmosphere around you that an amateur god can create with a positive attitude that the devil can't do nothing. Hallelujah. He can't touch a hair on my head. He can't touch a hair on my head. [cheering and applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can't touch one hair of your head before he goes before my father and gets permission from my father. And before he gets permission from my father, he's had fellowship with me. And he has a trust inside of me that he can send me through the valley of the shadow of death. [applause] Hallelujah. [screaming] He can send me through the valley of the shadow of death. And as David said, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." [cheering] Your God hasn't left you. This is the greatest revival that has ever struck the earth. This is the awakening of the bride. This is the son of man that has been revealed to you that's living inside of your life. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Brother said, "Now if the church could only realize how much power and authority that she has." Thank you, brother Ed. &gt;&gt; He said that you were ambassadors. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm waiting on something. What are you waiting on? &gt;&gt; You may be the only one living in your school. &gt;&gt; You may be the only one living in your community in the internet. You may be the only one in your whole state, but God is dependent on you. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation world, he saved you to this hour. &gt;&gt; He pre-planned you that you can live right here in 77 2007. You can live to see this day. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; God has saved a witness for the earth. &gt;&gt; You just happen to be that witness today. &gt;&gt; I'm only trying to catch my breath. Brother Tim touched this this last night, but I want to read you about you. This may be common to you, but I want to read about you just for a minute. Because listen, President Bush does not speak to as a powerful group of people as I'm speaking to tonight. the governors and the kings of the earth when they gather all their pump and their splendor together and have their $1,000 plate meals and they have all their protocol and they gather them in and they set them down at a certain spot &gt;&gt; and all the men behind the scene gather them and set them at a certain position. Everybody's sitting there to wait to hear something that don't mean nothing way. all promises. &gt;&gt; Can't live through it. &gt;&gt; Screaming for peace and safety. &gt;&gt; Wondering why the world has fallen apart. &gt;&gt; Wondering why every demon of hell has been loosed from the river Euphrates? We've got the answer. &gt;&gt; Wondering why our streets are becoming more polluted? Wondering why the morals of the world is falling apart? We've got the answer. Wondering why America's falling apart? We've got the answer. &gt;&gt; Wondering why Russia's coming back up on the scene? We've got the answer. &gt;&gt; Wondering why the church world don't have answers anymore? We've got the answer. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; A goat farmer talked to you last night. of all the theologians of the whole world, &gt;&gt; they build their huge giant structures of buildings, brains from their head to their waist. &gt;&gt; And God calls us from all over the earth. the most powerful people in the whole world. &gt;&gt; How God must chuckle sometimes. Satan's looking and he's looking and he's looking and here we are. &gt;&gt; He don't have to look no more. Here we are. &gt;&gt; When they didn't recognize it, we did. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says there's living physical attributes of God that God thought of before the foundation world. Here we are. So he calls this group of people together and he's had people from country all over the world. And then he has a goat farmer last night and here tonight he's got another country boy. It's a mile up my gravel driveway. Before I left, I had to shoe a 200lb bear out of a pine tree. My dogs should run a bear up pine tree right beside of my house. I live in a little old cabin. Listen to the world. I am a nobody. &gt;&gt; The who's who don't have my name. &gt;&gt; I don't sit on the great boards of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God thought of me. &gt;&gt; I was important to him. I was a bag of nerves before we got here, Brother Tim. &gt;&gt; But feels pretty good right now. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you about yourself. You may have read it a thousand times. I'm going to read it one more time to you, brother Ron. We've heard that a thousand times. Can you imagine how many times the devil stood in a prayer line? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham reminded him, "Satan, I want to talk to you. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you &gt;&gt; that I met an angel. [applause] I met an angel in a cave. And he told me that if I could get the people to believe &gt;&gt; that not even cancer would stand before me. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan, I want to remind you that you're stripped. &gt;&gt; You don't have any power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have any power. And he heard that night after night after night after night. [cheering] Brother Ron, I don't feel nothing here tonight. In deep callth to the deep, there's a man standing there. He's kind of humped over in his shoulders and he's standing up kind of like this right here. And brother Brown said, "I see you're excited." &gt;&gt; He don't look excited to me. &gt;&gt; So you can't measure anything by physical action. Brother Bram said, "I see that you're excited." He said, "It's not me that has caused you to be excited. It's him." [cheering] &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham didn't heal him. Jesus Christ healed him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This wasn't the words of a man. This wasn't the words of William Brandham. This is the words of Jesus Christ to you and I. &gt;&gt; Let me show you another reason why that Satan hates the book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church. Important when it's in the church. &gt;&gt; He knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If he ever heal one person, He's still in the healing business. &gt;&gt; If he ever saved one person, he's still in the saving business. &gt;&gt; There was a revelation went on one time that said nobody could get saved after 1977. I don't believe it &gt;&gt; cuz I got saved in 1983. He knows that a whole lot more than 90% of the theologian. He knows that since God is immutable in his nature, he's immutable in his ways. He said, "Thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God." Mark 16 in action. It's the true church that Jesus claims is his own, and all else is false. &gt;&gt; Now remember this. Christ in the true church. How many believes you're part of the true church? &gt;&gt; It's a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; He says, "But the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm and formal and powerless." He said, "It exposes Satan and reveals his works, the attempted destruction of God's people, right down to the discredited of God's word, right down to the time that he is cast in the lake of fire. He fights it. &gt;&gt; He fights you coming to church. &gt;&gt; He fights you on your job. He fights you in your neighborhood. He fights you every way that you can. Cuz if you can get back to your source of your revival. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, you're strong only as strong as your source is. Brother Harold, seven church ages. Every one of those candles, their wick went right down into the same oil. &gt;&gt; Under Luther was some powerful preachers that came caught the same anointing that Luther had. &gt;&gt; They preached the same word that Luther preached under John Wesley. Powerful men all the way across the earth caught that same anointing. Not with the same gift, but caught the same anointing. &gt;&gt; They may have never laid their eyes on the prophet of God, &gt;&gt; but because they were drinking from the same oil. &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am the vine and you are the branches," &gt;&gt; we get energized from that same vine. Same Lord Jesus that walked into that little room and told Brother Brandham what the next seal was. &gt;&gt; That same Lord Jesus, Brother Ernie wants to live in your life. You believe that, don't you? &gt;&gt; Why you quiet now? That same Christ, that same anointed one, &gt;&gt; that same anointed one wants to come to your pew. &gt;&gt; He wants to be your source. &gt;&gt; Denomination is not my source. &gt;&gt; The newspaper is not my source. &gt;&gt; TBNN is not my source. I have a source &gt;&gt; of strength when I am weak. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to tire you. I won't be much longer. &gt;&gt; He fights it. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people Who are those people? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I know my name is written in the book. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. &gt;&gt; Ray, you know that your name is written in the book. &gt;&gt; Not because Edis told you. &gt;&gt; He was only anointed to carry it across the pulpit. And then all of a sudden a revival takes place in your private pew. &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true revelation &gt;&gt; of the true church &gt;&gt; and what she is and what she stands for. She can do [screaming] the greater works. She will be an invincible army. I'm just going to jump down. He said this. He said, "You will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book that we're studying is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the church." and in his future work in his work in the future ages. And then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to give it. He said bringing these two thoughts together, you will see it will just take more. It won't just take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real. Listen, if this book isn't real to you tonight, if this book is not real to you when you come to church, if there's not a real move of God going on in your life, &gt;&gt; if that fountain inside of you feels like it's dried up and it's become common, I adjure you by the I challenge you tonight. &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight. Quit arguing with the message. &gt;&gt; Quit fighting with the message. &gt;&gt; Quit quit dotting the eyes and crossing the tees. Quit look trying to see who's holier than thou. &gt;&gt; Come to the revelation in your heart. If there's one going in British Columbia, &gt;&gt; if your jobs getting in your way, your home's getting in your way, your family's getting in your way, shake it off, &gt;&gt; brother. I thought revival were only for another day. I didn't live in another day. I'm sorry I didn't live in another day. This is my day. &gt;&gt; My passion is not for Michael Jordan and the Bulls. My passion is not for Hollywood. My passion is not for baseball. My passion is not for football. My passion is not for the world and it's rock and roll and it's country music. My passion, &gt;&gt; my passion tonight is that he might live among us. &gt;&gt; How do I know if I've got it? What does your life produce? I'm going to finish with this thought. At the end of the day, you forgive me if you think that I tried to work you up, but I'm just excited about what I believe. At the end of the day, when there's no more organ playing, when the iPod has been laid down, when your favorite preacher's voice is not echoing in your ears, when you turn the the lights off at night, And all the emotion of the day is over with. &gt;&gt; Can you look back and say he lived today? &gt;&gt; What did my life produced today? Not my works, but him living through me. &gt;&gt; Was an actor. Was I an impostor? Was a phony? Excuse me. &gt;&gt; But what I read about brother Brandham and listening about brother Brandham, he was a real man. &gt;&gt; Wasn't no fake about him. He was honest. &gt;&gt; He told us when he made mistakes. &gt;&gt; He was a man. He told us when he made mistakes. He told us that he wanted to be a trapper. &gt;&gt; But there was something that so lived in his life that changed prostitutes lives &gt;&gt; that made devils run for cover. &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to say this to you. When Jesus walked before Pilot, he didn't say a word, but there was so much about his presence &gt;&gt; until a howling mob couldn't be heard in Pilot's ears. But Jesus with his own non-speaking voice stood there with his presence &gt;&gt; and shook one of the mightiest governors that ever lived. &gt;&gt; When you walk onto your job, does your presence, and I'm not talking about your humanity, Listen, because his presence will live in China. &gt;&gt; His presence will live in Zimbabwe. &gt;&gt; His presence will live in Virginia. His presence will live here in Canada. &gt;&gt; It's the same God in Zimbabwe as it is right here. presence of Jesus Christ living in your life. &gt;&gt; Does it make other people salty &gt;&gt; to want to be a real Christian? &gt;&gt; No, this isn't deep tonight. This is what God laid on my heart. &gt;&gt; We can have a meeting like this and we've got some of the speakers that ever lived. And I felt so ashamed that I took I I'm here tonight. But when this meeting is over with, he don't live in your life. He he our Lord Jesus Christ don't live in our life. We wasted power. He don't meet you in your private prayer closet. &gt;&gt; He don't come off the pages. &gt;&gt; You can have an intimate affair with him. Brother Ron, I know the message, but do you know him? &gt;&gt; Don't roll your head at me. Don't stick your collar out at me. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'd rather stand here today a poor preacher like David was the poorest excuse for a for a soldier on the field. I'd rather stand here tonight and say, "Do you know him today? the ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with our heads bowed just a moment. said, "But brother Ron, we're beyond altar calls." &gt;&gt; I'm afraid sometimes we went too far beyond. &gt;&gt; Intellectualism won't get you nowhere. It has its place. But I want to ask you tonight just if you be honest with yourself and say, "Brother Ron, I personally need a revival in my heart, in my life. It feels like I've just been running through the meal, just one service after another, making myself come. It feels like that when I pray, it just don't get nowhere. It feels like the chains of sin has me bound." Maybe there'll be one here tonight to say, "I just can't lay those things down, those habits down." I want to say to you, tonight is your night. &gt;&gt; Don't wait till tomorrow. Don't make promises you can't keep because you can't do it on your own. Let him come. Let him be that supernatural God to you. I'm not talking about a euphoria you can't live up to, but I'm talking about a reality. &gt;&gt; You take one step, he'll take the next one. You say, "God, help me." Brother Ron, you're a different kind of preacher. I just got to be who I am. I'm asking you tonight, would you take a step out and say, "God, I need a revival in my life. I invite you to this altar. I ask you tonight, would it be your turn tonight? God, rekindle the flame in my life. Rekindle the flame in my life tonight. Rekindle me tonight. I'm not talking about emotion. I'm talking about a real life. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go down. I'm reminded every time that brother Brandham would sit in a congregation, you hear somebody else preach, as soon as the altar call came, he was the first one on the altar. We all can say, "I need more of God." &gt;&gt; I got news for you tonight. Before I could preach this to you, I had to pray through for myself because a preacher, his qualification is that he meet that pillar of fire for himself. &gt;&gt; You can't preach something you don't have for yourself. My children are falling away. What about your life? [snorts] &gt;&gt; I just don't get as much out of services as I used to get. &gt;&gt; What's got in the way? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He just smile. Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads before you tonight, &gt;&gt; whether we're standing at this altar, standing at the back of this building, &gt;&gt; we ask you at the first of this meeting to have a conference. Many people standing in prayer lines didn't hear what they wanted to hear. Many times as a congregation, we don't get what we're expecting for the night. I watched you even as you turned my own thoughts this evening because there's children here that have a need and you told your disciples, "I have a need that I might go by Samaria." &gt;&gt; Maybe there's a woman at the well that you needed to talk to tonight. Maybe even out on the internet, there's somebody you're talking to just now. &gt;&gt; There's one mediator between God and man, and that is the man Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus, we ask you to come to where we're at. We ask you to loose the chains of sin. We ask you to go down through our memory alley tonight. What can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can restore me again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Redemption's claim has already been made. The accuser stands there with nothing to say. Oh God, you're the one tonight. These you're they're your children. This is your wife tonight. You're responsible for them, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, brood over our lives and speak to our hearts tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Come to every heart, Lord. We pour with our voices to you, dear God. Rekindle my flame. &gt;&gt; David said, "Restore to me the joy." &gt;&gt; Cares of life deteriorate us. cares of life. &gt;&gt; The reality of working nine and 10 hours. The reality of Leoa irks at our lives. The reality of this dark age and the demon powers of hell makes us get weary. But you said don't get weary and welloing. &gt;&gt; So we come back to our source tonight. We come back to the well tonight. &gt;&gt; We come back to our place of strength tonight. &gt;&gt; And I ask you tonight that you would strengthen us. If Jesus had to go away to pray, how much more do we need to step aside for a little while? Come aside for a little while that you can renew our strength. We open the door tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; Come, we pray. Rude over our lives. We welcome you here tonight. We welcome the word tonight. &gt;&gt; We have a welcome spirit for you tonight, Lord Jesus. Save loved ones tonight. &gt;&gt; Save our loved ones tonight. &gt;&gt; Arrest him tonight. May the Holy Ghost take them prisoner tonight. Go to where they're at tonight. May they find their lives miserable until they find their way to Jesus Christ. Oh Jesus, it's you we want to see. Won't you just pour your heart to him just now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are glorious. Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. glory. Hallelujah. I [singing] love him. I love you because he first loved me. Just my Sal dream after service such as this and after a word we've heard such as this and after the Holy Spirit. How many agree the Holy Spirit is speaking? I want to say to this congregation with all whatever authority God gives me, I believe I can say it with his authority. Either we need prayer ourselves or somebody beside us needs prayer, someone in this building needs prayer. And I believe we have a lot of evidence. I would be happy to have every person in here pray for me. I want to live a greater reflection. I want that very nature of Christ. I'd be happy tonight to have every bit of Edis burned out of me and have God so fill every every part of my being. That's my desire. We have many ministers here and there's people here that need prayer. I wonder if you could come and pray for someone. Just come behind them and pray for them. The ministers can come if you would. Let's pray for these that have come. And we're going to we're going to pray for one another. We could sing, but we're not going to sing just now. We're going to pray. We're going to pray earnestly. And if you feel so inclined, why don't you pray for someone else? Someone that may not even be in this building. The Holy Spirit is not restricted by these walls. Would you go, oh Holy Spirit, into the room or into the place where my loved one is, my son, my daughter? Do you believe that God would hear us as we pray? I believe he will. I'd like this whole congregation to enter into prayer. Maybe you want to pray for yourself. Maybe you want to empty out yourself and just surrender yourself and find a new place of surrender with Christ. Oh God, visit us. Visit us. I pray these that are have come and have a desire. Oh God, they've come with a purpose. Lord, every man of God now prays a prayer. Let this whole congregation now enter into prayer. Let's lift up our voice to him. Our God is a God that hears us when we pray. Father, look down into the inner region, inner bar. Oh, how our soul, my soul thirst after the living God. Let your perfect will be done. Those of you that have come, those of you that are praying here, open your mouth. Lift up your voice. If you desire to be filled, say, "Fill me now, Lord. Not tomorrow. Fill me now. I'm here to be filled now. I'm here to receive it now. Let that fullness of the Holy Spirit. Let that baptism of fire take place. Let it be a change, a transformation as the man of God, our brother Spencer spoke tonight. Let the lives be changed. Let the transforming power, oh God, reign supreme through these beings. &gt;&gt; Let the prayer now be answered. Father, we come to you believing as your children. As your children, Lord, break down the resistance. Break down the break down the unbelief. Oh God, break down the walls. Remove, oh God, the hindrances. I pray there be a cleansing fire. Cleanse me now. Cleanse me now. Fill me now, oh God. Hear the prayer. And may the answer now come. Oh God. Oh God. Grant it Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. [singing] &gt;&gt; How long shall I pray? Pray until. Pray until you tell him, "I'm here until I'm not leaving here till I receive what I've come for." Come with that kind of faith. I'm here to receive it. I'm here to receive a full measure. If you're sick, if you're sick and afflicted, I believe in healing power. God, come and heal. Remove the sickness. Remove the disease. Let the supernatural take place. He's a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fill me now. Oh, fill me with me now. Jesus [music] [singing] come and fill [music] me now with &gt;&gt; Are you able to hear receive more of the Holy Spirit? The spirit of God come and take control, Lord. You want them to have the preeminence in your life, in your home. &gt;&gt; Let him change the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Jesus, my Jesus, come and fill me now. Oh, fill me with Thy Holy Spirit come and come by here. Come by here. Come by here. [music] Come by here. Come here. Come by here. My Lord. [music] Oh, come [singing] by. &gt;&gt; Invite him to come. Invite him. &gt;&gt; Lord, come by. &gt;&gt; When you invite him, he'll come. The prophet said, &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to maybe close your eyes and sing it now. Someone's praying, Lord. Lord, my king [singing] of my [music] Break my heart. [music] Come by. &gt;&gt; Someone's praying. Lord, &gt;&gt; we're praying. &gt;&gt; We're praying. I'm praying people Lord someone [singing] pray [music] Jesus is passing this way. &gt;&gt; Jesus is passing this way. [music] Oh Jesus is passing this way is passing this way. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus friends. Oh, it is Jesus. Oh, Jesus &gt;&gt; is [music] passing this way. [music] Jesus is [music] passing. &gt;&gt; I feel somebody still needs that breaking of that fedter. [music] And I want the congregation to come in one heart and one spirit as we join and blend our voices in one attribute to the other and utter these words in song. Jesus breaks every feder and sets me free. And if there's one bound person or more and you know that there's still shackles on your life, I want you to say the words, "Jesus breaks every feeder and sets me free." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're a people that are free. how Satan would like to have you walk out of the building tonight still bound and say, "I still got them. I still got them. I still got them bound. Let those shackles fall. Hallelujah. Let those shackles be broken. Let those chains fall in the name of Jesus Christ that he might be rejoiced, that he might be given the victory, that he might be given the praise that he earned at Calvary. Jesus breaks &gt;&gt; every fatterus. Oh my Jesus. every feather and he [music] &gt;&gt; and then we'll rejoice and give him all the glory &gt;&gt; Jesus Every Jesus pray and he set me free. I will shoutout. &gt;&gt; I will shout hallelujah. I will shout. I will shout hallelujah for he [singing] &gt;&gt; I know he set me he set me free.

Oh, God rich in grace, God rich in love, sending his best from heaven above, saying [music] to all men today, God rich in mercy, God rich in mercy. He was rich in his word tonight. He was rich in his word last night. He's been rich in his word all through this convention and before the convention. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he will be tomorrow. Our brother Gideon Ratif preached last Sunday morning, Breaking the Cycle. I've been looking for that moment where some of you would respond and break the cycle. Hallelujah. I love to see the devil defeated. I love to see him defeated. We ought to rejoice when he's defeated. Hallelujah. The scripture tells us that when they saw they saw the judgment of God and they saw the judgment of the great and they saw him cast into the lake of fire, the saints of God said, "Hallelujah. Glory to God." We don't have any sympathy for the enemy. He &gt;&gt; We're his enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. God rich and mercy. Hallelujah. [applause] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise his name. Praise our God. The devil hates it. We love it. Praise our God. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.

Oh, we have a we have a good reason to shout and sing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you been the recipient of his mercy? &gt;&gt; Amen. I am redeemed. I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am [music] redeemed. A cry Jesus [music and singing] my whole life. If anybody [music] just tell them I am redeemed. [singing] Oh, I am redeemed. You [music] might [music and singing] as you just I am &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; that I am &gt;&gt; just [music] once more and that Jesus [music] has saved my whole life. &gt;&gt; If anybody [music] ask you just who I am, tell them I am free. [music] If anybody asks you, ask you just who I am, then tell them I am. &gt;&gt; If anybody [singing] asks you just who I am, what do we do? will tell them I am redeemed. [music] All the glory Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, this is an atmosphere you don't really want to leave. &gt;&gt; Our brother Tim Pro is going to be preaching tomorrow morning &gt;&gt; 11:00 our last service here. We will not be having a Wednesday meeting at the church. We have to move all the equipment from here and there's many brethren that are leaving on Tuesday and Monday and Wednesday and we have a very very full schedule for the first of the week. So we won't be having a Wednesday service. We're getting everything back from here. We've had a glorious glorious time and it's not over yet. It's still going on. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends. I I as pastor of the local congregation, I'm going home this evening filled, full. I've just every day just kept my mind on on the things of God and just laid down and even rest for 20 minutes or 30 minutes and just want to meditate on what God has spoken. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Keep it in your mind day and night. Do you believe that's good advice? Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are good, think on these things, let's not think about the things of the world as little as possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't get away from something. Brother Rod, I'm going to need you to help me. It's been on my mind since before I came to church. And may and may be somebody here needs the words of this song. I want to sing as a as a declaration in the face of the enemy. Somebody here probably needs to sing it. And to say it, it is well &gt;&gt; with my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel the spirit of God. So I wasn't going to do it. I've been I've been standing here saying, "Well, the meeting's gone on long enough, but I feel I must we must do it." Somebody here needs it. It is well with my soul.
