[14:43] Thank you, Father.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our brother John
[14:49] Andy's, Brother John, if you'd come and
[14:51] open the service in a word of prayer
[14:52] this morning.
[14:54] Amen.
[15:02] Heavenly Father, we come into your house
[15:04] this morning, this house of praise and
[15:07] worship. We lift up our hands, God. We
[15:10] lift up our hearts. We lift up our
[15:12] lives. We invite your Holy Spirit to
[15:15] come and take control of this service,
[15:18] Lord. May your anointing break every
[15:21] yoke. May every sin and unbelief, every
[15:24] shackle, every carnal reasoning, every
[15:27] thought of even ourselves or any life,
[15:31] may it be brought under your control. Oh
[15:33] Lord, let the king of heaven and his
[15:35] queen meet today in a divine encounter.
[15:39] May you break down the strongholds of
[15:42] the enemy as we cry out your name,
[15:45] Jesus. Lord, heavenly father, would you
[15:48] come in your word, come in your
[15:50] presence, come in your power, Lord, we
[15:53] need you. We confess our need. We humble
[15:56] ourselves to one another and to you. We
[16:00] repent of our sins. We repent of our
[16:03] unbelief. We repent of anything that
[16:05] would hinder. Help us not to grieve your
[16:08] Holy Spirit. Send angels, oh God. Send
[16:12] your Holy Spirit to this meeting, Jesus.
[16:15] We cry out to you, Lord. We invite you,
[16:18] Jesus. Help us to get into a channel
[16:21] where all things are possible. Lord,
[16:24] where nothing would hinder you. You are
[16:26] the supreme one. You are the one we turn
[16:29] our face to. You are the one we honor.
[16:33] You are the one we adore. You are the
[16:36] one, Lord Jesus Christ.
[16:39] Come down today, Lord, in your presence.
[16:42] May you take each man and woman, boy and
[16:44] girl, under your divine care. May you
[16:47] heal the sick, Lord, and deliver the
[16:50] bound. May you pour in your Holy Spirit,
[16:52] Jesus. Send a great healing, Lord.
[16:55] Healing arise in your wings of faith,
[16:58] God. and may every individual reach and
[17:01] touch the hem of your garment. I know we
[17:04] would be made whole. I know there's
[17:06] miracles waiting to happen. I know
[17:09] there's a spirit ready to be released on
[17:12] your people. If we could just humble
[17:14] ourselves and pray and seek, Lord, and
[17:18] turn toward your holy place, then you
[17:21] would hear from heaven and you would
[17:23] heal our land. Would you anoint this
[17:26] meeting, God, with men and women of
[17:28] faith and courage, Lord, that Satan
[17:31] would be so bound and darkness that
[17:34] shackles and unbelief, Lord, would drop
[17:37] at the very presence of Jesus Christ.
[17:40] Your bride is waiting, Lord. We're
[17:42] longing for you. Let there be a
[17:45] breakthrough, Lord, as we even prepare
[17:47] for this summer camp, Lord, and what you
[17:50] would have for our young people, for our
[17:52] children, for our assembly, Lord. May
[17:55] nothing hinder or cause there to be a
[17:58] diversion, but may the Holy Spirit break
[18:01] through and clarity and freedom and
[18:03] liberty. May even this service today be,
[18:07] Lord, a continuation of the move of the
[18:09] Holy Ghost. Let a revival break out in
[18:13] our hearts. Let there be a liberty in
[18:15] your presence, God, as we worship you.
[18:19] Come down today and meet every need,
[18:22] every request, every desire. May you be
[18:25] special today as we invite you again,
[18:28] Jesus,
[18:29] for your glory and for your honor. We
[18:33] wait upon you.
[18:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[18:37] Thank you, Lord. We thank you already
[18:40] for what you're going to do.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; We wait, Lord. We desire to see you,
[18:46] God, come walking up and down these
[18:49] aisles, oh God. We want to touch you
[18:52] again, Jesus. We thank you for what
[18:55] you're doing, God. Move in our hearts,
[18:58] move in our souls, move in our lives,
[19:01] God.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[19:03] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.

[26:29] sound in your ear.
[26:35] Oh,
[26:37] I love you, Lord,
[26:43] and I lift my voice
[26:49] [Music]
[26:51] to worship.
[26:55] Oh
[26:57] my soul,
[27:00] rejoice.
[27:03] Oh, take joy.
[27:05] Take joy my king.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:16] Let it be a sweet
[27:19] sweet sound.
[27:23] [Music]
[27:29] And we're going to go to prayer at this
[27:30] time. As we go to uh brother Ed, just
[27:33] one prayer request we want to make
[27:35] mention. There's a lady by the name of
[27:37] Joan Wood, 58 years old. Um someone
[27:40] brother Andrew Novakowski knows he's got
[27:42] cancer and uh doesn't have long to live.
[27:45] And just asking we pray for her this
[27:46] morning for the biscuit.
[27:55] God bless you.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Another good day. Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. In his presence, the supernatural
[28:03] is happening and we need some
[28:04] supernatural.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a lot of supernatural.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; I'm sure there are those here that are
[28:13] needy and we're going to have prayer.
[28:16] And uh
[28:19] uh just before I pray, I want to make
[28:23] mention that we we're going to pray as a
[28:26] congregation for brother Ed Nicaroo.
[28:29] And brother Ed, I'm going to have you
[28:30] come down in just a moment. Uh the uh
[28:34] the doctors can't seem to find out just
[28:38] what is uh what is happening in his
[28:41] body. And as I waited on God and we had
[28:45] prayer yesterday and then I just held it
[28:47] in my heart, Brother Ed, through the day
[28:50] and I thought and the words came to me,
[28:54] this devil can hide from the doctors,
[28:56] but he can't hide from God.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And we believe that God's going to
[29:03] deliver our brother
[29:05] uh from this affliction. It's as though
[29:08] if you know what arthritis is in a
[29:10] joint, it's like arthritis has consumed
[29:13] his entire body, muscles and bones and
[29:16] everything. And they think, well, it may
[29:18] be a side effect of some medication. And
[29:22] brother Brandham says, you said cancer,
[29:24] that's the name that you give it. But he
[29:26] said it's a devil.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what we believe. That's what
[29:30] this congregation believes. It is a
[29:33] devil that takes opportunity and uses
[29:37] whatever means he can. And uh I I asked
[29:41] Joanne to come to the piano because I
[29:42] want to sing blessed assurance
[29:46] Jesus is mine with all of the he was the
[29:50] fullness of the attributes of God. And
[29:53] this is one of my favorite songs if not
[29:55] the favorite. This is my story.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; This is my song.
[30:02] And I'm here this morning to give him
[30:05] praise.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Praising the Savior
[30:08] &gt;&gt; all the day long.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; That's what we're living for.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he redeemed us for.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; And we're not our own.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price. Is
[30:19] that not so?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; You are not your own. You're not here
[30:23] just to receive some blessing. We're
[30:26] here to give blessing.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; We're here to contribute to the body of
[30:30] Jesus Christ. And I believe that it's
[30:32] our responsibility to uh gather
[30:35] ourselves together to muster all the
[30:37] faith. The angels of God are here
[30:42] &gt;&gt; that's what he said
[30:44] &gt;&gt; to energize your faith
[30:46] &gt;&gt; under the direction of the Holy Spirit.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves to him now completely
[30:52] and freely that he might
[30:56] come and
[30:58] accomplish. I don't want to just see us,
[31:01] you know, attempt something, but let it
[31:04] be done
[31:05] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, please? And I'd like
[31:12] to sing the first verse. Blessed

[32:40] My savior
[32:41] [Music]

[32:50] This is my story.
[32:55] This is my song.
[33:00] I'm praising my savior
[33:06] all the day.
[33:09] I wonder, brother Ed Naruk, would you
[33:11] come down as we sing the chorus again?
[33:14] This is my story.
[33:20] This is my song.
[33:25] Praising my savior
[33:31] all day long.
[33:36] This is my soul.
[33:40] [Music]
[33:42] This is my song.
[33:47] I'm praising my Sior.
[33:53] All the
[33:58] we'll bow our heads in prayer. Going to
[34:00] ask brother John, brother Tom if you
[34:03] please come.
[34:04] Brother Ernie, you'll join us.
[34:09] Thank you, Father.
[34:14] Is any afflicted? Let him pray.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; The scripture says,
[34:21] "Our brother is terribly afflicted.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Is any sick? Let him call." And he's
[34:26] been brought down to this state of
[34:28] sickness.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to anoint me with
[34:31] oil. I believe in the scripture. I
[34:35] believe in following every word to the
[34:37] letter
[34:38] &gt;&gt; and God is going to deliver our brother.
[34:41] I anoint you, brother Ed,
[34:43] &gt;&gt; according to the word of God, according
[34:45] to the scriptures, according to the
[34:48] promise. God has made you a promise.
[34:52] Father, we're coming. We're coming on
[34:55] the basis of your promise.
[34:57] This devil has hid from the doctors.
[35:00] This devil has hid from the instruments.
[35:03] This devil has hid from the medication.
[35:06] But this devil cannot hide from the
[35:08] antidote to Calvary. This devil cannot
[35:11] hide from the discernment of the Holy
[35:14] Spirit. Satan, you are exposed and you
[35:18] must leave this body. Come out in the
[35:21] name of Jesus Christ. And may our
[35:24] brother Ed be delivered. Lord, as he
[35:27] stands here on this spot, let the virtue
[35:30] of the resurrected Christ begin now to
[35:33] sir through his body and move the pain
[35:36] out of these muscles. Move the pain out
[35:39] of these joints and bones. Move the
[35:42] pain, oh God. And I pray you'll put a
[35:44] song of confession in his mouth. And
[35:47] that he will be filled with rejoicing.
[35:50] He will be filled with, oh God, with joy
[35:53] unspeakable and full of glory. We thank
[35:56] you for Calvary. We thank you for the
[35:59] words that were ever uttered. It is
[36:02] finished. Lord, I pray for all that may
[36:05] be in need physically and spiritually in
[36:08] this building today. Oh God, come forth.
[36:11] I pray and meet every need. Oh Lord, the
[36:15] request that has been written, Father, I
[36:18] pray that you'll meet the request. I
[36:21] ask, oh God, you'll send the Holy Spirit
[36:24] that came on the day of Pentecost and
[36:26] made that spirit fill and refill. Oh
[36:29] God, to overflowing every one of your
[36:32] children, your vessels, we are here. I
[36:35] pray you'll now anoint your word, oh
[36:37] God. Anoint us to hear and receive.
[36:41] Anoint us to speak, oh God. Each one as
[36:44] we stand at our post of duty, anoint us,
[36:47] I pray, arrest. Hallelujah.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many want to raise their
[36:53] hands and say, "Anoint me aresh, oh God.
[36:56] Fill me aresh, oh God. Take this time. I
[37:00] surrender it to you. I surrender my
[37:02] vessel to you. We sanctify ourselves, oh
[37:07] God. Sanctify us, oh God, I pray. In the
[37:11] name of Jesus Christ, and for your
[37:14] glory. Hallelujah. And we thank you for
[37:16] this healing upon our brother Ed. Oh
[37:21] God, the enemy's defeated brother Ed in
[37:25] Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah.
[37:28] Hallelujah. The messenger said now thank
[37:31] him for it. We thank you for it. Oh God.
[37:36] Hallelujah.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus. How wonderful you
[37:40] are.
[37:42] Thank you father.
[37:45] Thank you, Father.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; This is my story.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; I can't ever get tired of Calvary.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; I can't ever get tired of redemption.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; All a day long. All a day long.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[38:05] seats. And thank you, musicians.
[38:17] While we were gone for a few days,
[38:22] we visited uh some of the believers up
[38:25] in Hudson Hope and probably you wouldn't
[38:29] know, but there's uh four believers up
[38:32] there now. One sister just from the
[38:34] Philippines just arrived and she took a
[38:36] position from Hong Kong, not knowing
[38:39] where in the world Hudson Hope was. She
[38:42] took a position there to uh be a nanny
[38:45] or take care of a home. And here she's
[38:48] two blocks from another sister. And
[38:52] she's the only sister in Hudson Hope,
[38:53] Sister Lillian Meyers, and been craving
[38:56] and desiring some fellowship for a
[38:59] number of years. And God sends somebody
[39:01] from Hong Kong, two two blocks from her
[39:04] house.
[39:06] I say, "Isn't God wonderful?"
[39:08] &gt;&gt; I think God has a sense of humor as
[39:09] well, doesn't he? He just does things in
[39:12] such a such a unique wonderful way. So,
[39:15] we were able to be with them and Sister
[39:18] Lillian called them called her. Her name
[39:20] is Sister Myra. And she came over to the
[39:22] house. She didn't know that we were
[39:24] there. She just said, "Come on over for
[39:26] coffee." So, she walks in the door and
[39:28] here's uh Sister Ruth and I sitting
[39:31] there and she almost she almost
[39:34] collapsed because all she's seen is the
[39:36] videos of the streaming. she's seen the
[39:39] meetings on on streaming and and then
[39:41] there's another brother there, brother
[39:43] Gary
[39:45] uh Steiner and he's he's uh way back
[39:50] before there was any
[39:53] any streaming he was getting videos and
[39:56] he saved those videos and he's got
[39:58] stacks of them. I mean stacks of them.
[40:02] I've never seen so many videos in my
[40:04] life in one place and he hands them out
[40:07] or whatever more, but he and his wife
[40:09] and his wife passed away and went to be
[40:11] with the Lord a lot of years ago and it
[40:14] just, you know, God's got some wonderful
[40:16] people tucked away.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; He just seems to keep them to himself
[40:20] and and it's so nice to be with them.
[40:24] Really wonderful. Well, we're happy that
[40:26] you're all here
[40:28] and uh
[40:30] Brother Alladan and his wife, God bless
[40:33] you, Brother Alladan. I know that
[40:35] they've greeted you, but I wonder if I
[40:37] have Brother Alladed stand if you would
[40:40] please. Brother Alladan, this is his
[40:42] first time to be here in Canada, right?
[40:46] And this is a brother that received the
[40:49] message many years ago when Yugoslavia
[40:52] was still Yugoslavia before it broke up
[40:55] into many different countries and
[40:57] provinces.
[40:59] And uh brother Aladan, he knows to do
[41:02] only really one thing and that's work.
[41:06] And he works for this message. He just
[41:09] translates. He hasn't hardly got time to
[41:12] earn a living. He just so busy working
[41:16] and he's translated messages and
[41:18] duplicated them and sent them. We had a
[41:20] little building
[41:22] fact is brother Bob Lock I remember well
[41:28] that you you gave an offering a
[41:30] substantial offering to buy a building
[41:33] over there in Subetita which is right on
[41:35] the Hungarian border. And that work
[41:39] never really got started there. and we
[41:41] felt bad and and the building stayed
[41:44] empty and it was used for different
[41:46] things and so on but never really
[41:48] established into work. Well, I want want
[41:50] the congregation here to know because
[41:52] others gave, but especially you, Brother
[41:54] Bob, that that building was eventually
[41:58] sold and we had a hard time selling it
[42:01] because it was a very old, very old
[42:03] stone building. And uh but it was right
[42:06] in the heart of a university city and I
[42:09] walked the streets and there were just
[42:11] hundreds and hundreds of young people
[42:13] and my art heart actually pained. I
[42:16] thought, "Oh, God, if I could just be
[42:18] here and speak the language, I'm I'm
[42:20] sure that something would start. You
[42:22] know what that's like? You just you you
[42:25] it's like you get in the racetrack and
[42:26] you're you want to you want the gate to
[42:28] open so you can get out." And that's how
[42:30] I was feeling. Well, that it, you know,
[42:33] God's ways are not our ways. And that
[42:35] building finally sold and brother Milo
[42:38] suggested, why don't we use the money
[42:40] they needed for a printing press? And so
[42:43] the money from there, brother Bob bought
[42:45] a printing press and brother uh Alladen
[42:49] is printing messages and sending them
[42:51] all over and sending them to the hub and
[42:54] they're being downloaded on the hub. And
[42:57] I just want to say on behalf of God's
[43:00] work, on behalf of the kingdom of God,
[43:03] on behalf of the congregation has never
[43:05] met you before, brother Alladen, keep up
[43:07] the good work and God bless you.
[43:20] We're going to find out a lot of things
[43:21] when we get to the other side.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to stand with me and
[43:28] I'll have you turn to 2 Corinthians the
[43:32] 3 chapter. We're going to begin reading
[43:35] from the 11th verse. And while you're
[43:38] turning in your Bible,
[43:41] uh, I'm going to ask one more thing of
[43:43] you if you would please. I have been
[43:46] holding the camp and the meetings.
[43:49] Brother Donnie Reagan, his wife is
[43:52] actually having surgery, gallbladder
[43:54] surgery on the 30th, and he's he's
[43:57] leaving about four or five days later.
[44:00] And he said, you know, it's really the
[44:02] last thing in the world he wants to do
[44:03] is leave his wife just immediately after
[44:06] surgery. But he said if you really feel
[44:08] that I should come uh I will come. And I
[44:11] said I really feel you should come uh
[44:14] for sure. And uh so I am holding these
[44:18] meetings up and I would like to ask you
[44:19] to join with me and to take time out and
[44:25] when God brings it to your mind if you
[44:28] take five minutes or take an hour or
[44:31] miss a meal say I'm going to I'm going
[44:34] to pray earnestly that God will do
[44:37] exceedingly abundantly above all we
[44:40] could ask or think. not some away time
[44:42] in the future, but during these meetings
[44:45] and that God will so direct our brother
[44:47] Donnie Reagan that he'll have that
[44:50] direct mind of God and it'll come and
[44:53] minister to us. Do you believe that?
[44:55] Amen. I want to be ministered to. I'm
[44:57] going to come there with expectation
[45:00] and we want to be able to say whatever
[45:02] you say Lord
[45:04] &gt;&gt; I will do it.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to come with that
[45:08] with that kind of uh attitude. So I
[45:11] would ask you to remember remember the
[45:13] meetings and brother Donnie and prayer
[45:14] especially
[45:18] for those of you that don't know we had
[45:22] 44
[45:25] that were out from our assembly out from
[45:27] our assembly that want to come to the
[45:29] and be in the camp.
[45:32] And uh they asked what should we do and
[45:35] I said do everything in your power to
[45:37] make room. Put them anywhere. put them
[45:40] everywhere. We'd want to make room. And
[45:43] finally, there wasn't 44. There was 50.
[45:46] And then I just learned this morning
[45:47] that is just for the senior camp. If we
[45:50] include the juniors, there's 60
[45:52] additional people or young people that
[45:55] are coming. And mothers and fathers are
[45:57] coming as well. And I see that some have
[45:59] already come. And it's wonderful to have
[46:02] you. And we ask you to come. Those of
[46:04] you that are visiting, come with great
[46:06] expectation.
[46:08] Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; We need God, friends.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; We don't need program. We need God.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Before we read, we'll pray once again.
[46:21] Oh, God,
[46:24] you are the God that Abraham worshiped,
[46:26] the God of Abraham.
[46:29] You are the God that Isaac worshiped.
[46:31] You're the God of Isaac.
[46:34] You are the God that Jacob worshiped.
[46:36] You are the God of Jacob.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; You visited each of these men. You spoke
[46:42] to them. And then you called your first
[46:45] prophet and brought him before a pillar
[46:47] of fire in a burning bush and spoke and
[46:51] said, "I'm the God of Abraham, the God
[46:54] of Isaac and the God of Jacob." Oh,
[46:57] you're the God of the foundation. You're
[47:00] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[47:02] Christ. And you brought him forth. You
[47:04] are the father that sent the Holy
[47:06] Spirit. You are the very God who is a
[47:09] living God. You have eyes to see and
[47:12] ears to hear and a mouth to speak.
[47:15] Speak, oh God, and we will hear. You are
[47:18] the one who's called us. You have sent
[47:21] this message in this hour because we
[47:23] needed it desperately. And now may it
[47:26] become a living word.
[47:28] Not in our ears only, not in our mind
[47:31] only, but down into the region of the
[47:33] soul,
[47:35] &gt;&gt; changing and transforming in Jesus name.
[47:37] Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Corinthians 3 chapter and I
[47:44] would like to start at verse 11.
[47:49] For if that which is done away was
[47:51] glorious, much more that which remainth
[47:54] is glorious. Seeing then that we have
[47:57] such a hope, we use great plainness of
[48:01] speech, and not as Moses, which put a
[48:04] veil over his face, and that the
[48:07] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[48:10] look to the end of that uh which is
[48:14] abolished.
[48:16] But their minds were blinded. For until
[48:19] this day remainth the same veil untaken
[48:22] away in the reading of the Old
[48:23] Testament, which veil is done away in
[48:27] Christ. But even unto this day, when
[48:30] Moses is read, the veil is upon their
[48:32] heart. Notice where the veil is.
[48:36] Nevertheless, when it, that's the heart,
[48:39] shall turn to the Lord, Malachi 4, and
[48:42] the veil and the veil shall be taken
[48:45] away. Now the Lord is that spirit and
[48:48] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[48:50] liberty. There is what?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Liberty. But we all with open face
[48:56] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[48:58] Lord are changed into the same image
[49:01] from glory to glory even as by the
[49:05] spirit of the Lord. Amen. You may be
[49:07] seated.
[49:09] Now I have a number of scriptures and I
[49:12] want to uh bring them to you on the on
[49:16] the screen
[49:17] so you will be able to uh follow along
[49:22] uh in the thought today.
[49:28] Beholding the glory of the Lord is the
[49:30] title of the message I I wish to speak
[49:33] to you about. But we all with open face,
[49:37] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[49:40] Lord, are changed into the same image
[49:43] from glory to glory, even as by the
[49:46] spirit of the Lord.
[49:50] We all
[49:53] with open face, that is a unveiled face.
[49:57] In other words, there's nothing to
[50:00] afflict or to hinder our vision.
[50:06] This is all in this one verse. Beholding
[50:09] as in a glass
[50:13] the glory of the Lord
[50:17] are changed into the same image
[50:21] from glory to glory
[50:24] even as by the spirit of the Lord. Now,
[50:30] we're going to be looking at a few more
[50:32] scriptures in just a moment, but uh the
[50:35] thought that I would like to direct your
[50:38] mind to is when a person holds something
[50:43] in view, when they hold something in
[50:46] focus,
[50:47] don't not meaning about reading a book
[50:50] just now, but it it could be that. But
[50:52] people today have goals.
[50:55] They have objectives in life.
[50:58] A lot of uh young people you have just
[51:01] graduated
[51:02] and others are in a certain kind of
[51:05] profession or job. And regardless of
[51:08] what it is, we have a certain goal. You
[51:10] mothers are raising a family. You have
[51:13] desires. You are observing your
[51:15] children. You see certain talents or
[51:19] skills that might be there. And and so
[51:22] you want to direct their energy. You
[51:24] want to direct them in a godly way. And
[51:27] so you have a goal. I can tell you one
[51:30] thing. You cannot have that goal for
[51:32] five minutes. You've got to have that
[51:34] goal as a constant objective in front of
[51:37] you. And then as you have hold that in
[51:39] front of you, now I speak personally for
[51:41] yourself as an individual. You keep
[51:44] moving. Brother Brown talked about
[51:45] healing. You keep that that perfect
[51:48] image in front of you
[51:50] &gt;&gt; and then you keep mov Why was he saying
[51:52] that is because there's transforming
[51:55] power
[51:56] something activates your faith
[51:59] &gt;&gt; and you hold it right in front of you.
[52:01] It's not based on feeling. You hold it
[52:04] in front of you and you move in that
[52:06] direction and there is a transforming
[52:08] power within the word itself. It's not
[52:12] anything that you generate. We all we
[52:15] can do is be obedient to the word and
[52:17] then and then as we're obedient to the
[52:20] word then it's up to God
[52:23] &gt;&gt; to do the rest.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; It's not up to you and I. We can't bring
[52:27] it about.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; For example, let's talk about a
[52:31] resurrection. What can you do on behalf
[52:33] of a resurrection? What can you do on
[52:35] behalf of uh a rapture? What can you do
[52:38] on behalf of the change of the body? You
[52:40] physically you can't do anything but
[52:42] spiritually you can do one thing and you
[52:45] must do this one thing. You must hold
[52:49] that objective in front of you. You must
[52:52] hold that goal in front of you. And I
[52:54] will I I would like to just show you how
[52:57] this is so uh pronounced in the
[53:00] scripture.
[53:02] While we look, Paul said, while we look
[53:04] not at the things which are seen, but at
[53:07] the things which are not seen. For the
[53:10] things which are seen are temporal, but
[53:13] the things which are not seen are
[53:14] eternal.
[53:16] And to look, he's saying, while we look
[53:18] not, but we do look at the things which
[53:21] are are unseen, and we are to observe
[53:25] it,
[53:26] to contemplate it.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; To mark it,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. make it as a mark
[53:34] &gt;&gt; uh to fix one eyes upon to direct one's
[53:38] attention to and having regard for a
[53:42] thing.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Now I just want to stop there. One thing
[53:47] in brother Brandham's life I can tell
[53:49] you he had he had all through his
[53:53] ministry he had very very deep the
[53:57] deepest respect for the call of God on
[54:01] his life.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; He had the deepest of respect for the
[54:08] call of God upon his life.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could never be uh uh thwarted
[54:15] or turned from or distracted from the
[54:18] fact what the angel of the Lord said to
[54:20] him. If you can get the people to
[54:22] believe, nothing will stand before your
[54:24] prayers. How many times they say it?
[54:26] Hundreds of times. Why? Because it was
[54:28] always the same. Now, if God put a call
[54:31] on his life, I'm here today to ask you,
[54:33] what about the call on your life?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; What about the call of God? You're
[54:40] sitting here. You are a witness to the
[54:42] fact that uh even by your presence, God
[54:46] moved on me. God spoke to me. God did
[54:48] something. I'm here. I'm here. And I
[54:51] want you to go back to that. I want you
[54:53] to go back to that original. Say, "God
[54:56] did it."
[54:57] &gt;&gt; I got thinking about the people that
[54:58] came from uh so many different places. I
[55:02] got thinking about their the their the
[55:04] the moving and the logistics of and the
[55:07] and the trouble they went through and
[55:08] the tearing they went through, the
[55:10] separation they went through that
[55:12] because because of a call of God on
[55:14] their life. I want you to go back to
[55:16] that because that same God that gave a
[55:19] call originally, that is the same God
[55:21] that still has a plan.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He's got a he's got a path for you to
[55:26] walk.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; He's got another footstep for you to
[55:28] step into. And we never want to lose
[55:31] sight of that. God has an objective. I
[55:34] want you to be able to say today, God,
[55:35] let me see that objective.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Let me fix my eyes upon it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And the it to look is to the distant
[55:45] mark looked at the goal or the end that
[55:48] one has in view. That's why the apostle
[55:51] Paul said, I press what? Toward the mark
[55:55] of the high calling in Christ Jesus. I'm
[55:58] pressing towards that. I'm not allowing
[56:01] anything to be in my way. Paul said in
[56:03] Timothy, and without controversy, great
[56:06] is the mystery of godliness. God was
[56:09] manifest in the flesh. And I have a
[56:12] reason for bringing this word manifest
[56:15] out in the next number of scriptures is
[56:17] because
[56:19] you may not see what you want to see in
[56:21] your life, but if you behold and and be
[56:25] given granted by grace
[56:29] a from God the ability to see. Jesus
[56:34] said, "Blessed are your eyes, for they
[56:37] see."
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And blessed are your ears, for they
[56:41] hear.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Blessed are your
[56:44] eyes," he's saying, "There's a lot of
[56:45] eyes that don't see what you're seeing.
[56:48] And there's a lot of ears that don't
[56:49] hear what you're hearing, but blessed
[56:51] are your eyes, and blessed are your
[56:54] ears, for they see." I say, "God, be
[56:57] merciful to us that our eyes don't
[56:59] become uh our ears don't become dull and
[57:02] our eyes don't become shaded over or
[57:04] veiled over with anything. Keep my
[57:06] vision clear."
[57:10] &gt;&gt; God was manifest in the flesh, justified
[57:14] in the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[57:16] unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
[57:19] world, and received
[57:21] up into glory. Manifest. God was
[57:25] manifest. God appeared. God declared
[57:28] plainly. God showed oneself. God came
[57:32] into view. God made known.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; That's what God has done. God was
[57:41] manifest. Not everybody sees it, but God
[57:44] was manifest. And we can lose. We can we
[57:48] can so easily lose because uh Satan is
[57:51] so full of all the using every kind of
[57:54] device and every kind of distraction
[57:56] every thing that's that he has at his
[57:59] disposal in this day to get people
[58:02] brother Brandham talks about a glare.
[58:04] People becomes blinded because of a
[58:06] glare. They get blinded because of
[58:08] worldliness. They get blinded because of
[58:10] all that the world throws up in front of
[58:12] them and oh oh maybe we should be doing
[58:15] this maybe we should be going that going
[58:17] that way that let's let's make
[58:19] absolutely certain that nothing is
[58:21] allowed to dim our vision.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I want the congregation be able to say
[58:29] amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it steps on your toes, just
[58:33] say, "Ouch, God, help me."
[58:36] Because there's no use just, you know,
[58:38] we're not we're not here filling in
[58:40] time. We're here to see the Holy Spirit
[58:45] &gt;&gt; do what he wants to do.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; So to manifest
[58:52] the life was manifested,
[58:54] the apostle said, "And we have seen it."
[58:57] For the life was manifested, John said,
[59:01] was manifested and we have seen it and
[59:04] bear witness and show unto you that
[59:07] eternal that eternal life which was with
[59:10] the father and was manifested unto us.
[59:16] We have seen it
[59:19] is uh properly to stare at. Oh, I want
[59:22] the people.
[59:24] I'm gonna I'm gonna be laborious this
[59:27] morning if you will allow me.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I want you because I feel that in a
[59:34] congregation this size, Satan throws so
[59:38] many things in front of you that we get
[59:40] staring at other things instead of
[59:43] staring at the objective.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; You know what it is to to be stared at?
[59:49] Have you ever come into a place and
[59:51] people dropped what they were doing or
[59:53] they stopped what they were doing?
[59:56] &gt;&gt; My wife and her sister up up in the
[59:58] north went into a a a farmer's store,
[1:00:04] quite a large store, and people sit at
[1:00:07] the coffee table and and they and they
[1:00:10] talk there by the hour. think sister
[1:00:13] Cindy Bergen where your mom worked for
[1:00:16] so many years. And so my wife and and
[1:00:20] her sister walked into this store and
[1:00:22] and sat down. I mean, when do you see
[1:00:25] two women, you know, with long dresses
[1:00:28] on as it were and and as conservative as
[1:00:30] they are and their long hair and so on
[1:00:32] and walk in and it's just like everybody
[1:00:35] around just kind of stopped. Oh, where'd
[1:00:39] these people drop in from? and and and
[1:00:43] you know,
[1:00:45] some people don't like to stare, but
[1:00:47] others don't mind staring. And these
[1:00:49] folks didn't mind staring. They just
[1:00:51] stopped and they just looked. And then
[1:00:54] they talked to somebody else and then
[1:00:56] both of them would look. Then they might
[1:00:58] have a sip of coffee and then the whole
[1:01:00] table would look and they said, "As long
[1:01:02] as they were there, they just stared at
[1:01:04] them." Well, when you get stared at, you
[1:01:06] can feel almost uncomfortable. But we as
[1:01:09] believers according to the scripture and
[1:01:12] the scriptures I want to give don't be
[1:01:15] ashamed to stare at at the manifestation
[1:01:18] of God in this hour.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's going to be the theme in this
[1:01:22] service. God has become very evident and
[1:01:27] God has vindicated him. Those are words
[1:01:30] we use vindicated himself. God has
[1:01:33] proven himself. God has become visible.
[1:01:36] God has become very plain.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; God has spoken
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; and we must never tire of looking at
[1:01:43] that manifestation
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; even in your weakness,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; even in your failure. Say, you know,
[1:01:51] Satan, he wants you to he wants you to
[1:01:53] become distracted and look at your
[1:01:55] weakness or look at your failure. And
[1:01:58] you want to tell him,
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Satan, that's not what I'm looking at.
[1:02:04] He wants you to look at the doctor's
[1:02:06] report. He wants you to look at the
[1:02:08] medical uh all devices. He wants you to
[1:02:12] look to the medication. And I'm not
[1:02:14] saying that you shouldn't take it. I'm
[1:02:16] saying that's not your objective.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; That is not your answer.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; There's another objective. And if you
[1:02:28] look to the right thing and focus on the
[1:02:31] right thing, there will be a
[1:02:32] transformation that'll take place and
[1:02:35] you will become what you're looking at.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; To see, to properly stare at, to take
[1:02:42] heed,
[1:02:44] to see with the mind, to perceive, to
[1:02:47] become acquainted with by experience.
[1:02:50] It's not just something that's not mind
[1:02:51] over matters, not something in your
[1:02:53] mind, but you actually experience it.
[1:02:56] And there's a note a notation here. This
[1:02:59] word gives prominence to the discerning
[1:03:03] mind when the physical side recedes.
[1:03:07] This word denotes perception in general
[1:03:11] resulting principally from vision. So we
[1:03:14] want to say I I love this part and
[1:03:16] that's why I wanted to have you read it.
[1:03:19] When the physical side recedes,
[1:03:22] oh this flesh needs to recede. Amen.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; All this human reasoning
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; needs to recede.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; All this human effort needs to recede.
[1:03:37] And let the Holy Spirit come with his
[1:03:40] objective
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; in your life in the church in the body
[1:03:44] of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; We beheld his glory.
[1:03:56] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:03:59] among us. And we beheld his glory, the
[1:04:02] glory as the only begotten of the
[1:04:04] father, full of grace and truth.
[1:04:09] First John said again, that which was
[1:04:12] from the beginning, which we have heard,
[1:04:15] which we have seen with our eyes, and we
[1:04:19] have looked upon and our hands have
[1:04:21] handled of the word of life.
[1:04:26] Jesus said, "Those of you young people
[1:04:30] who've had brother Biscll's sign in your
[1:04:34] Bible,
[1:04:36] you'll find this verse,
[1:04:39] John 14:21.
[1:04:42] My father was quite a a letter writer
[1:04:46] and he wrote me because we were parted
[1:04:48] as a family
[1:04:50] uh for a lot of years.
[1:04:53] my sister who's here, she would be in
[1:04:56] one place and I'd be in another place.
[1:04:59] But my father wrote,
[1:05:01] he wrote beautiful handwriting.
[1:05:04] And it's one time, I don't remember any
[1:05:08] other scriptures he may have referred me
[1:05:10] to, but I was in my teens and I remember
[1:05:14] this time. And whenever he wanted to
[1:05:17] really catch my attention, he would say
[1:05:19] Edward.
[1:05:21] And he wrote Edward,
[1:05:25] he said, "Always ask God to reveal
[1:05:30] himself to you." And he gave this
[1:05:33] scripture,
[1:05:35] "He that hath my commandments
[1:05:38] and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
[1:05:41] me.
[1:05:42] And he that loveth me shall be loved
[1:05:46] of my father,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; and I will love him." Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Could you ever could you ever tire of
[1:05:58] hearing that?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And I will love him.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And will manifest myself
[1:06:08] to him.
[1:06:11] I could close this service right now and
[1:06:14] if you could take that as a theme and I
[1:06:18] will love him
[1:06:21] and will manifest myself to him.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Take the whole world
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; but give me that.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Take all the glamour.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Take all the excitement.
[1:06:36] take everything the world has, but just
[1:06:38] let me keep that as my focus and I will
[1:06:40] love him.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And I will manifest myself to him. Oh.
[1:06:47] Oh, what a glorious what glorious words.
[1:06:50] Let that be an objective before me. All
[1:06:53] I want to see is that manifestation and
[1:06:55] have eyes to see it and a mind to
[1:06:58] discern it.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this, you can never
[1:07:03] be the same person
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; if he manifests himself to you
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and you keep your focus. You just view
[1:07:10] that manifestation. You view and we'll
[1:07:14] speak a little further. You speak, you
[1:07:16] view this manifestation.
[1:07:19] You view it and you hold it and you make
[1:07:22] it a part of the very fiber of your
[1:07:24] life.
[1:07:25] Just your thought focused on that will
[1:07:28] bring about changes in your life. Those
[1:07:31] of you that have raised children, you
[1:07:34] know yourself, you have to keep an
[1:07:36] objective before them. You have to keep
[1:07:39] speaking to them. You need to keep
[1:07:41] encouraging them. If you have a good
[1:07:44] instructor or a teacher whatever more
[1:07:47] educator then needs it needs to keep
[1:07:50] before the class and before the people
[1:07:52] who they are and what they are and
[1:07:56] before a congregation. I believe that a
[1:07:58] preacher is delinquent if he doesn't say
[1:08:00] to the congregation who they are in
[1:08:03] Christ. There's no one in the world like
[1:08:06] the redeemed.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't care what anybody
[1:08:11] says h about you as an individual. But
[1:08:14] once God has laid his hand on you, once
[1:08:16] he has called you, you are my son,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; you are my daughter,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; and I will love you.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; The whole world can pass off this scene.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Then what difference does it make?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't ever let Satan cheapen
[1:08:34] that.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And I would never let it take it. I
[1:08:39] would never allow
[1:08:41] to become too common.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; I'd sooner be called a simple person.
[1:08:47] I'd sooner be called a simple man and
[1:08:50] see God in simplicity.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I will manifest myself to him.
[1:09:01] John said also 1 John
[1:09:04] 3 and8 in part for this purpose the son
[1:09:08] of God was manifested
[1:09:10] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:09:13] devil.
[1:09:16] Manifested
[1:09:17] once again similar to manifest to appear
[1:09:21] or to show oneself to make visible
[1:09:24] or known what has been hidden or
[1:09:27] unknown.
[1:09:29] That's why the seals had to be opened.
[1:09:32] There were things that had been hidden
[1:09:34] and unknown. Can we ever weary? I don't
[1:09:38] think that I think that it's a mistake
[1:09:40] if we just, you know, get certain
[1:09:43] phrases. Oh, the seals are open. Well,
[1:09:46] that's that's not just what we want to
[1:09:48] hear. We want to hear what is it that
[1:09:49] was open.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; What is it that was manifested?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; What is it? And brother Brandham
[1:09:55] actually gives details some of these
[1:09:57] things.
[1:09:59] to manifest whether by words or deeds or
[1:10:02] in any other way and to make known by
[1:10:04] teaching, to expose, to view, to be
[1:10:08] plainly recognized, thoroughly
[1:10:10] understood who and what one is. God
[1:10:13] wants to be thoroughly
[1:10:16] understood,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; who he is
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; and what he's doing in this time.
[1:10:22] Brother Brandham relates
[1:10:25] in a very complimentary way
[1:10:28] uh the great servant of God, Brother
[1:10:30] Billy Graham.
[1:10:34] And he says he heard him
[1:10:37] and he admired him for his courage and
[1:10:40] he said he'll go into a city and have
[1:10:43] 30,000 converts.
[1:10:46] And then he comes back a year later and
[1:10:47] he can't find 30.
[1:10:50] And he said, "It's you lazy preachers
[1:10:52] that sit there with your feet upon the
[1:10:54] desk." And he began to chastise them for
[1:10:59] their lack of working with the 30,000.
[1:11:04] Brother Brandham,
[1:11:06] he just took it a little bit further and
[1:11:09] he said, "If I could get to my brother
[1:11:11] or speak," he said, "I'd like to," he he
[1:11:15] mentioned the Apostle Paul. He said,
[1:11:16] "But I'd like to go back and and and
[1:11:20] tell him what the Apostle Paul did." The
[1:11:23] Apostle Paul went into a city and got
[1:11:25] one convert.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; But he said he established that one in
[1:11:30] the word, in the message of the hour. He
[1:11:32] established him. And then when he came
[1:11:34] back a year later, there was 30.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening in China right
[1:11:38] now. And one gets established in the
[1:11:40] word of the hour. Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, you wouldn't be
[1:11:44] where you are today if you just float
[1:11:47] along on on uh on, you know, the the
[1:11:50] blessings. We love the blessings, but
[1:11:53] it's not the blessings that we're
[1:11:54] seeking. I'm seeking the lifechanging
[1:11:57] value of the word of God.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm seeking that element of the word
[1:12:02] of God that transforms a man from a
[1:12:05] sinner to a saint and from a saint to a
[1:12:08] son of God.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; To establish and and don't think that
[1:12:19] these things don't speak very very deep
[1:12:20] to me. I feel a great responsibility
[1:12:24] that we don't just have a service but
[1:12:26] that the word is preached in such a way
[1:12:29] so that people are established.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't take you just into
[1:12:35] the negative things or I've heard people
[1:12:38] speak about the mess that's in the
[1:12:39] message. You don't get anywhere
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; if you just take a child and you just
[1:12:44] say you did this wrong or you did that
[1:12:46] wrong. What's the matter with you? You
[1:12:48] stupid child. You can't even tie your
[1:12:50] shoelaces, right? You'll never never
[1:12:52] learn, never come any place. You have to
[1:12:54] tell them who they are.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And the ability they have
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and who they are in Christ.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; In fact is I'll tell you in spite of the
[1:13:02] wrong you are obligated to look to the
[1:13:05] right.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You're obligated to look to the finished
[1:13:08] work. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at the failures. A lot
[1:13:11] of people looked at the failures of
[1:13:12] Jesus Christ and where are they?
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; But there were others who confessed when
[1:13:19] Jesus said, "Who do men say that I am?"
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's not the question. Brother
[1:13:23] Brandham said, "The question is who do
[1:13:24] you say I am?"
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; What do you say? What do you say this
[1:13:28] word is?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; What do you say this message is?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; For this purpose the Son of God was
[1:13:49] manifested
[1:13:51] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:13:54] devil
[1:13:56] which we just went over.
[1:14:01] Now
[1:14:04] you can turn in your Bible if you would
[1:14:06] to Revelation the first chapter.
[1:14:11] Is it all right with you if I just take
[1:14:13] my time?
[1:14:21] And in verse eight,
[1:14:26] I'm not I'm not referring to all the
[1:14:29] scriptures. I would like to but uh
[1:14:33] we'll just read from verse 8.
[1:14:36] Now it's the same one that was
[1:14:38] manifested and John wrote a good deal
[1:14:41] about him. But now John is John is being
[1:14:46] introduced to him in a different way and
[1:14:49] he's saying I'm alpha and omega the
[1:14:51] beginning and the ending say the Lord
[1:14:53] which is and which was and which is to
[1:14:56] come the almighty. I John who also am
[1:14:59] your brother and companion in
[1:15:01] tribulation and in the kingdom and in
[1:15:04] patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[1:15:07] aisle that is called Patmas for the word
[1:15:10] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ. I was in the spirit on the
[1:15:15] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:15:18] voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha
[1:15:21] and omega the first and the last and
[1:15:24] what thou seeest write in a book. Notice
[1:15:27] that please. What thou sayest, write in
[1:15:30] a book, and send it to the seven
[1:15:32] churches which are in Asia, unto
[1:15:34] Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto
[1:15:36] Pergamus, and unto Thotyra, and unto
[1:15:39] Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto
[1:15:41] Leodysia.
[1:15:43] And I turned to see the voice that spake
[1:15:46] with me. And being turned, I saw seven
[1:15:50] golden candlesticks. And in the midst of
[1:15:53] the seven candlesticks, one like unto
[1:15:55] the Son of Man. Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Clothed with a garment down to the foot,
[1:16:00] and gird about the paps with a golden
[1:16:02] girdle. His head and his hairs were
[1:16:04] white like wool, as white as snow, and
[1:16:07] his eyes were as a flame of fire, and
[1:16:10] his feet like unto fine brass, as if
[1:16:12] they burned in a furnace, and his voice
[1:16:16] as the sound of many waters. And he had
[1:16:19] in his right hand seven stars, and out
[1:16:21] of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:16:22] sword. And his countenance was as the
[1:16:25] sun shineth in his strength. And when I
[1:16:29] saw him,
[1:16:31] when I saw him, I fell at his feet as
[1:16:35] dead, and he laid his right hand upon
[1:16:38] me, saying unto me, "Fear not. I am the
[1:16:41] first and the last." John, that'll be
[1:16:45] the end of our reading there for the
[1:16:46] moment. John had saw him
[1:16:51] many times but he didn't see him in this
[1:16:54] fashion. He was now seeing something
[1:16:58] very very different. And the Lord Jesus
[1:17:01] said to him what you see right in a
[1:17:04] book. This is not going to be like John
[1:17:08] one in the beginning was the word and
[1:17:10] the word was with God and the word was
[1:17:11] God. This is going to be somewhat
[1:17:13] different. What you see now, this is a
[1:17:16] different vision. This is a different
[1:17:18] view. And this is a different
[1:17:20] manifestation. And I want you to write
[1:17:22] this in a book and send it to the seven
[1:17:25] churches. And being turned,
[1:17:29] he said, and being turned, I I saw.
[1:17:36] Write the things which you've seen. The
[1:17:38] things which John wrote was sent now to
[1:17:42] these seven churches. Written messages.
[1:17:46] Written messages sent to seven churches.
[1:17:50] And I think that it's very important
[1:17:52] that we
[1:17:54] we see
[1:17:56] you know we we hear now these messages
[1:18:01] which John saw. This account which John
[1:18:04] saw was written in a book. And then
[1:18:09] seven angels or seven messengers to
[1:18:12] those churches
[1:18:14] picked up the revelation of what he saw
[1:18:19] and spoke it to the people in their
[1:18:22] time.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And that was done specifically. So that
[1:18:26] word that was spoken for their time, God
[1:18:28] also had raised a people that was made
[1:18:31] to hear that word.
[1:18:33] and an elect in every age and they
[1:18:36] received it and when they heard it then
[1:18:39] they begin to see. So it went from what
[1:18:42] John saw then God said what you see
[1:18:46] write it and what was written messengers
[1:18:49] spoke it
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and when the messenger spoke it the
[1:18:53] people elected in that day they heard it
[1:18:56] and by hearing it they saw him again.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; That's the process.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; That's what God intends. God doesn't
[1:19:05] intend you just hear a message or you
[1:19:07] hear the seven seals are open or all of
[1:19:09] these things and all of these little
[1:19:11] phrases and so on. God intends you to
[1:19:14] see a manifestation of that person.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; when you see him,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; you'll never be the same.
[1:19:35] He says he was manifested
[1:19:40] for this purpose.
[1:19:42] Listen to me very close. For this
[1:19:44] purpose,
[1:19:46] God's word speaking now. For this
[1:19:48] purpose was he manifested to destroy the
[1:19:53] works of the devil.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The power is in the
[1:20:00] manifestation.
[1:20:01] If you see him manifested,
[1:20:04] what was the work of the devil? His
[1:20:06] cunning in Eden was the first thing to
[1:20:08] take the word of God and twist it just a
[1:20:11] wee bit and cause Eve, the mother, the
[1:20:15] daughter of God to disbelieve it. And
[1:20:18] everything we see on the streets, the
[1:20:20] institution, every hospital, every
[1:20:22] graveyard happened there.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That amen was far too weak. That's
[1:20:28] right.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Every every graveyard
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; was there. I've got loved ones. You have
[1:20:33] loved ones. They're there because Eve
[1:20:36] disbelieved.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; The hospitals are filled to overflowing
[1:20:40] and you can't hardly get in an emergency
[1:20:42] ward because of what Eve did that day.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Every one of them
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; happened there.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; But that's what he came to destroy.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; He came to destroy your unbelief. He
[1:20:57] came to destroy your doubt. He came to
[1:21:00] destroy your question and the thing that
[1:21:02] would derail you. He came to destroy it.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And it's not that you just put your arms
[1:21:08] up and say, "Oh, God, come and do it."
[1:21:10] No, he's saying you look at the right
[1:21:11] thing and I will do it.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You keep the objective in front of you.
[1:21:17] You look at this manifestation.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's my challenge to you today. I'm
[1:21:25] not just preaching. I'm preaching
[1:21:27] something that I actually I pondered so
[1:21:29] deeply.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:21:34] that we are changed
[1:21:37] as we look with an open face.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Unveiled
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; face, not some facade. We're not putting
[1:21:45] on some fancy facade. Oh, I go to
[1:21:48] Cloverdale Bible way or I go here or I
[1:21:50] do this or I'm a believer. No, we don't
[1:21:52] put on some facade. We just look right
[1:21:55] there.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; But when we do, you know what I did? I
[1:22:00] went into the mirror.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; I went to the mirror.
[1:22:06] I said, "You are a son of God."
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ went to Calvary for you.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ said, "I will manifest
[1:22:17] myself to you."
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ said, "I love you." Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I could go there and say, "You dirty
[1:22:26] rat. You're a failure to begin with."
[1:22:30] And where would that get you?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Where would that get you? That won't get
[1:22:34] you anywhere. But when you can look
[1:22:36] there and say, "I've seen the
[1:22:38] manifestation and I look there and I
[1:22:42] have said several times over and over
[1:22:45] yesterday and through today and the day
[1:22:47] before." I said, "God, there's a lot of
[1:22:51] things I don't know." I even read the
[1:22:52] scripture. There's a lot of things I
[1:22:54] don't know. But I know one thing.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; You manifested yourself
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; You proved yourself. It never gets stale
[1:23:04] to me. It never gets old to me when I
[1:23:07] see that the secrets of the hearts have
[1:23:10] been revealed. I listen to the
[1:23:12] messengers preaching on pardon
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and when he he comes and he just speaks
[1:23:17] about the denominations and how you know
[1:23:19] why he's speaking about the
[1:23:20] denominations and against the
[1:23:22] denominations organized religion not
[1:23:24] because the churches are wrong. He said
[1:23:27] he said that the Baptist or
[1:23:28] Presbyterians a Methodist Pentecost or
[1:23:31] whatever. He said but but it has
[1:23:33] separated the brethren
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; and I'm here to unite the brethren.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And he said that the traditions have
[1:23:42] veiled the people.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, friends, this comes
[1:23:49] much closer to home. Yeah.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; He said after a generation, two
[1:23:53] generations or so, we've now been maybe
[1:23:55] four or five generations
[1:23:58] that are here with our children and they
[1:24:01] simply hear about a prophet and they
[1:24:03] hear this is what he said and they hear
[1:24:05] this is how you should live and this is
[1:24:06] how you should dress. They haven't got
[1:24:09] any experience. Why?
[1:24:12] They only do it. This is how we take
[1:24:14] communion. We do we wash feet because
[1:24:17] why do you wash feet? Well, I I was
[1:24:19] raised that way. That's the way we we do
[1:24:21] it in the home. It become a tradition to
[1:24:23] you.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And he said of prophets in the Old
[1:24:27] Testament and when they got to the New
[1:24:29] Testament, they had made a tradition out
[1:24:32] of their life.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, Sunset Mountain and what happened
[1:24:37] there and so on so forth. Listen
[1:24:39] friends, unless unless the manifestation
[1:24:41] of this hour is a living reality in your
[1:24:45] soul, you don't know why you're doing
[1:24:46] it. and and and that and that's a it'll
[1:24:49] become a curse to you, not a blessing.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It must not become a tradition because
[1:24:55] the tradition will veil you. The
[1:24:57] tradition will put a cloud over your
[1:25:00] vision. You won't be able to see what
[1:25:01] you're supposed to see when it just
[1:25:03] becomes a tradition. And I'm sad sad to
[1:25:06] say that the message has become a
[1:25:08] tradition to multitudes of people. And I
[1:25:11] would like to say I would like to see
[1:25:14] before God that any trace of tradition
[1:25:17] could vanish out of this congregation.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; We don't want it as a tradition.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; We don't want to come here to church
[1:25:26] because it's a tradition 10:30 on Sunday
[1:25:29] morning. We want to come because we're
[1:25:31] hungry and we believe in God. We believe
[1:25:34] in the Holy Spirit speaking through the
[1:25:36] man of God. That's why we're here. And
[1:25:39] if we're here as a tradition, you're
[1:25:41] better off not to be here.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; We're not here because of a tradition.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; We're here because we hunger for God.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; We hunger for the realities of God.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; They made a tradition out of the
[1:26:00] message.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Pentecost was real, but they made a
[1:26:03] tradition out of it.
[1:26:05] The work of grace under Wesley was real,
[1:26:07] but they made a tradition under it and
[1:26:09] made a
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; disgrace.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I said, "What do we have?
[1:26:18] What did you manifest?"
[1:26:21] I see how God manifested
[1:26:25] and made real his Godhead.
[1:26:30] And the confusion
[1:26:32] has disappeared and vanished
[1:26:35] when we were confused and wondered and
[1:26:37] we didn't know. And man, I respected and
[1:26:40] people that you have as friends
[1:26:43] perhaps consumed with what the Godhead
[1:26:46] is or don't know what the Godhead is.
[1:26:49] Don't ever lose the cherished place in
[1:26:54] your heart that you have that God has
[1:26:58] manifested himself to you and made
[1:27:01] himself clear. He came into view and you
[1:27:04] see him so clear and you wonder why
[1:27:06] others can't see it, but you see it so
[1:27:08] clear. That's the manifestation.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; That's what you're treasure.
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:20] You know, there's multitudes
[1:27:23] don't understand the serpent seed.
[1:27:26] People on the peripheral on the fringes
[1:27:29] of the message, they don't understand
[1:27:31] the serpent seed.
[1:27:34] I can tell you if you're here.
[1:27:37] I'll never never forget the day brother
[1:27:40] Bam just put his arm over my shoulder
[1:27:42] and said, "Brother Eddie, this only
[1:27:45] comes by revelation."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; You pray
[1:27:50] and I'll pray for you.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will reveal it to
[1:27:56] you.
[1:27:57] I tell you what, friends, here today,
[1:27:59] all these years later, it is a treasure
[1:28:02] to me
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; that God manifested himself
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; on a personal way. I want you to be able
[1:28:09] to go back today. I don't care how
[1:28:10] simple it is, and I don't care when it
[1:28:12] was in your life. I don't care how far
[1:28:14] back, but go back to that time and say,
[1:28:16] "That was such a treasured moment."
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And look on that manifestation and and
[1:28:25] stare at it.
[1:28:28] Hallelujah.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Don't ever become tired or weary of it.
[1:28:31] Stare at it.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; That was one time. And there's another
[1:28:36] time. And there's another time. And then
[1:28:39] you'll find yourself staring
[1:28:42] at the resurrection,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; staring at the rapture, staring at the
[1:28:48] change of the body. and you'll go to the
[1:28:51] mirror one day or tomorrow morning and
[1:28:53] say, "You're going to change.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; You're going to change in your atoms
[1:28:58] because my Lord Jesus said so."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And you'll look at yourself in a
[1:29:07] different way.
[1:29:09] Brother Brandon said one of the last
[1:29:11] services he preached, I think modern
[1:29:13] events made clear by prophecy, he told
[1:29:15] he told the people and the women and and
[1:29:17] all of those gracious people that had
[1:29:19] him at that time, mostly I think
[1:29:21] Pentecostal people. And he said, "Look
[1:29:23] in the mirror.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Go and look in the mirror of God's
[1:29:26] word."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And when I look into the mirror of God's
[1:29:30] word, the message of the hour, and see
[1:29:32] what he said about the bride of Jesus
[1:29:34] Christ.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Oh friend, you have to help me.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I just feel so consumed.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; When they when John the Baptist came
[1:29:47] out,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; some some were saying they're looking at
[1:29:51] the same man.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Some said he's a teacher.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Some say he's a rabbi. He's a great man.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; John saw the same man,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; his cousin in the flesh.
[1:30:08] One day he looked at him,
[1:30:11] he saw something different.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Behold
[1:30:15] the lamb of God.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He looked at a man and saw a lamb.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And he wanted everyone to see this is
[1:30:24] the lamb of God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; This is the sacrifice of the world.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And he uttered those glorious words.
[1:30:34] Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Behold
[1:30:37] the lamb
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; that taketh away
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; the sins of the world.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, behold.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Pilate said, "Behold the man."
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; But I choose John's words. Behold the
[1:30:57] lamb.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb. Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And here we are 2,000 plus years later.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And I can never and you must never weary
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; of looking at that manifestation.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just Jesus of Galilee walking
[1:31:13] down the banks of the Jordan, but you're
[1:31:15] looking at the manifestation of God.
[1:31:18] What was in God's mind? He's sending him
[1:31:20] to his the word is coming to the prophet
[1:31:23] and revealing and manifesting himself as
[1:31:25] a lamb of God.
[1:31:28] And I want to say to you today, John saw
[1:31:31] the right thing.
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And today we had multitudes and tens of
[1:31:41] thousands of preachers that could see
[1:31:43] that and would speak about that. But
[1:31:45] thank God for a messenger that came, an
[1:31:48] eagle messenger with different eyesight
[1:31:50] and say, "Behold the bridegroom."
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He read the same Bible, everybody read,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; but he saw something different.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And as the message went on and
[1:32:07] progressed,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; he even indicated, he said, now and the
[1:32:11] angel came, the one came to the came to
[1:32:14] John and said, "Come hither, I will show
[1:32:16] thee a lamb's
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; wife."
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Not a girlfriend,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; not a fiance.
[1:32:26] I'll show you the way.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; We've had in the last two, three weeks,
[1:32:40] we've had some young women come here and
[1:32:42] be united
[1:32:43] to their fiance.
[1:32:48] And then the words are spoken.
[1:32:52] I pronounce you
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; husband and wife.
[1:32:56] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that says? That says
[1:33:01] she goes home to his house.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And when we had a messenger say, "You
[1:33:08] are the lamb's wife."
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; That was a sign sealed and delivered. We
[1:33:13] go home to his house.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "What do you see, Brother Ed? I
[1:33:23] see a I see a home.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I see a place that's been made prepared.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see a home.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I see my husband's home.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I see his home.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It's my home.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; It's my home.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] Do you want to go home?
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; He manifested himself
[1:34:00] to destroy the works of the devil.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And some of you are here that that devil
[1:34:06] tries to make you doubt,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; that you're going home,
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; He tries to make you doubt that you're
[1:34:11] good enough.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; He tries to tell you that you're not
[1:34:14] bride.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; He gets you down to a low point and says
[1:34:18] you're not good enough. Look at and he's
[1:34:20] he's excellent to point at. Look at all
[1:34:22] this frailty. Look at this weakness.
[1:34:24] Look at what you did there. Look what
[1:34:25] you thought there. You need to go to the
[1:34:28] mirror.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; You need to look into the glass
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and you need to confess.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; I'm the one he purchased at Calvary.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; I'm the one he went to prepare a place
[1:34:39] for.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; I'm the one he even came and manifested
[1:34:43] himself in this time.
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:49] He manifested himself. Friends, all that
[1:34:52] vindication, listen, I'm not just
[1:34:53] preaching. I'm telling you, I'm making
[1:34:55] announcement. All that vindication
[1:34:59] and you have tapes and you have all
[1:35:01] kinds of access.
[1:35:04] And when he calls people up and begins
[1:35:06] to tell them the secrets of their heart,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; do you know what I want you to say?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He did that for me. Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He was manifested for me.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; God. That wasn't William Brandon. That
[1:35:17] was God manifesting himself. He
[1:35:20] manifested himself for me.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; He manifested himself so I could stare
[1:35:25] at it.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I got to fix my vision on it.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It's become a personal thing.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And something that happened 40 years
[1:35:35] ago, I bring it right now today current.
[1:35:38] Yes.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And if next time you listen to it and
[1:35:40] you see that gift of God that was sent,
[1:35:44] you say, "He did that for me."
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And you keep staring at that and looking
[1:35:49] at that
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and it'll change.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Things that you see are wrong
[1:35:57] in your life, needing,
[1:36:00] needy,
[1:36:02] God will repair that and fix that for
[1:36:04] you. Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Came to destroy
[1:36:21] the works of the devil.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; The last enemy to be destroyed is
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Yes.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; He came to destroy that.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He manifested himself in this time to
[1:36:38] kind of reconfirm to you to just say it
[1:36:41] again. Here I am, children. I'm saying
[1:36:43] it again.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I came to destroy
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; the works of the devil.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:59] to release you from the bonds
[1:37:03] to free you from the chains
[1:37:07] as a prisoner to be loosed.
[1:37:13] He said in the revelation of Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ series unto him that loved us and
[1:37:18] washed us from our sins in his own
[1:37:20] blood.
[1:37:22] He said the word washed there actually
[1:37:25] in the Greek means to loose.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He loosed us.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; We were tied to the earth
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; by our sins.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But he loosed us.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He just didn't use some snips and leave
[1:37:40] you partially tied. He loosed you.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When that sweep comes over
[1:37:46] you, there'll be nothing to hinder you.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of his word.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "We couldn't see, couldn't
[1:37:55] hear, had no conception of heaven or
[1:37:58] nothing.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But when the blood came down, it cut the
[1:38:02] line and we got loosed."
[1:38:04] Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus, who is the image of the invisible
[1:38:15] God
[1:38:17] when he was here on earth, he said that
[1:38:21] he that hath seen me hath seen the
[1:38:23] father.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:25] He said, ' If you had known me, you
[1:38:27] should have known my father also, and
[1:38:30] from henceforth you know him and have
[1:38:32] seen him. And Philip said unto him,
[1:38:35] Lord, show us the Father, and it
[1:38:38] sufficeth us.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so
[1:38:43] long time with you, and yet hast thou
[1:38:47] not known me, Philillip? He that hath
[1:38:51] seen me
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; hath seen the father.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And how sayest thou show us the father?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; You see friends,
[1:39:01] you know, we we see things and we have
[1:39:05] our
[1:39:07] concept of them and
[1:39:11] and all all the people that are here,
[1:39:13] including myself, we've had our various
[1:39:16] experiences
[1:39:20] A lot of people have experiences,
[1:39:22] but it doesn't result in a new birth.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; But we've had our various experiences
[1:39:30] within the confines or within the scope
[1:39:32] of the message.
[1:39:36] And if anyone walked up to Philip and
[1:39:38] said, "Phillip,
[1:39:41] do you know Jesus Christ? Do you know do
[1:39:42] you know why he came?" Well, yeah, of
[1:39:44] course.
[1:39:46] Do you know what's happening? Well, I
[1:39:47] think I do. I just walking right with
[1:39:50] him. I'm just staying right with him.
[1:39:51] Why are you with him? Because I believe
[1:39:53] him. When he speaks, I listen.
[1:39:57] I respect everything. I love him with
[1:39:59] everything I have. I am everything I can
[1:40:01] possibly be.
[1:40:04] Then it came to this time.
[1:40:09] If you'd known me,
[1:40:13] if you had Janosco actually known, if
[1:40:15] you had true perception of me,
[1:40:19] you should have known my father also.
[1:40:22] And from henceforth, now he doesn't
[1:40:23] leave it in a negative term. He turns it
[1:40:25] to the positive. And from henceforth,
[1:40:28] you know him and you've seen him.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And Philip's puzzled. Philillip's filled
[1:40:35] with a question quandry.
[1:40:39] Lord, show us the father
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; and that will satisfy us.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Have I been with you so
[1:40:48] long
[1:40:50] and yet you've not known me?"
[1:40:55] Well, Philip probably in his heart was
[1:40:58] dismayed at that of course I know you.
[1:41:02] Then he adds, "And he that has seen me,
[1:41:05] he's seen the father.
[1:41:08] And how sayest thou show us the father?
[1:41:12] So some s is a teacher. Some saw him as
[1:41:15] a rabbi. Some saw him as a great great
[1:41:18] miracle worker. Some saw him as a
[1:41:20] prophet.
[1:41:23] Others saw him as Christ the anointed
[1:41:26] one.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; But even then,
[1:41:31] what do you see in the message? I see in
[1:41:33] the message Luke 17:30.
[1:41:36] This is the revealing of the son of man.
[1:41:39] I see Malachi 4:5 and 6. The hearts have
[1:41:43] been turned back. My heart's been turned
[1:41:45] back.
[1:41:46] This is Christ. This is the word. I'm
[1:41:48] following this word.
[1:41:54] But do we see all of it?
[1:41:56] And I want to just jar you a little bit.
[1:42:02] I want to jar you a wee bit.
[1:42:06] I don't think
[1:42:09] as believers and I've traveled a great
[1:42:11] deal and I see where they're at and I
[1:42:16] see this congregation
[1:42:18] and I'm very much in tune with your
[1:42:20] lives.
[1:42:22] I think there's something of his
[1:42:25] manifestation
[1:42:27] sincerely is from brother Biscll to you
[1:42:30] that we're missing. It is.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; I really think
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; we're missing something.
[1:42:40] So say, "Oh, don't leave us hanging,
[1:42:42] Brother Ed. What What is the answer?"
[1:42:45] The answer to me is, and this is what
[1:42:47] the Holy Spirit's been dealing with me
[1:42:49] about.
[1:42:51] We need to
[1:42:54] identify.
[1:42:57] Don't forget now when I say the
[1:42:59] manifestation,
[1:43:00] the manifestation.
[1:43:03] We we got it from the receivers's end.
[1:43:07] But listen to me close now. I want you
[1:43:09] to take it from the givers's end.
[1:43:11] Almighty God,
[1:43:13] brother Ernie.
[1:43:16] God
[1:43:17] for these hundreds of billions of years
[1:43:20] waited for a moment. I'm going to show
[1:43:22] myself
[1:43:24] in a certain way because I want to
[1:43:27] become visible.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I want to become seen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; I want the people to look on me. I want
[1:43:34] to become so evident.
[1:43:36] I want them to stare.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] And as I appear and they stare at it,
[1:43:44] a power will emanate out from that
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; receiving that will change and transform
[1:43:51] them.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says into the same
[1:43:55] image.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when people look on him
[1:44:02] and they find fault with Christ,
[1:44:06] they can never come into the image.
[1:44:09] No one who found fault with him, even to
[1:44:12] Pilate who said, "I find no fault in
[1:44:14] this man."
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; But yet he was persuaded by the people
[1:44:19] influenced to send him to the scourging
[1:44:23] and to Calvary.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:28] this congregation.
[1:44:33] You need
[1:44:35] less to be taken up with your daily
[1:44:39] life,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; your daily plans,
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; and your daily affairs. And you need to
[1:44:45] give time,
[1:44:48] quality time
[1:44:51] to focusing on the manifestation, how he
[1:44:54] manifested himself in action and also in
[1:44:58] word.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; I was so blessed.
[1:45:12] I have the unveiling of God here.
[1:45:18] I read this book
[1:45:20] continually, this message, not because
[1:45:23] it's just some words or a book that
[1:45:25] somebody has to read, but it unveils the
[1:45:29] author and the plan.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; It unveils the author of this this holy
[1:45:34] word of God.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; It unveils him and it lets me know that
[1:45:38] God has pulled the he's pulled the veil
[1:45:41] off. Yeah.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; He's pulled the veil of the traditions
[1:45:44] away
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and and every once in a while, you know,
[1:45:47] we're human and we're we're given over
[1:45:49] to little traditions we learned as we
[1:45:51] were brought up as children. And those
[1:45:53] of you that were born in Christian homes
[1:45:55] and those of you that have been born in
[1:45:56] the message, let me say to you with all
[1:45:58] love and yet all concern, don't let the
[1:46:02] message become a tradition to you.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is the way we do it or
[1:46:09] this is the way we worship or this is
[1:46:11] the way we have a meeting.
[1:46:15] I say, God, come and shake our nest.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I said to my wife, I said, "Dear,
[1:46:27] if I knew I could lay hands on the
[1:46:32] translators of every language in the
[1:46:34] world,
[1:46:36] I'd do everything I could to fund the
[1:46:38] translation of this message."
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; You know why? I don't just call it a
[1:46:42] hub. I don't call it just a translator.
[1:46:45] When I read such words as I read in here
[1:46:48] and I can scarcely get through a
[1:46:49] paragraph before I have it all marked,
[1:46:52] it becomes so precious because it makes
[1:46:53] the author known to me.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I see him manifested. I see the
[1:46:57] manifestation of God in the message and
[1:47:00] I I want to stare at it.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Young people,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; stare at it.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Behold the man.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Behold the revelation of the son of man.
[1:47:14] His
[1:47:16] hair is in plain view
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; and he did it for you.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Personally did it for you.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; So that you could go to the mirror
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; and I hope a lot of you do
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; go to the mirror this afternoon or
[1:47:36] tomorrow morning. look in there not to
[1:47:38] merely wash your face or to shave you
[1:47:40] brothers, but to look in the mirror and
[1:47:42] say this one,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; God, you manifested yourself.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; You manifested yourself. You even sent a
[1:47:53] messenger in this day. You sent the
[1:47:55] whole message. You to so that you could
[1:47:57] come into plain view. You descended. You
[1:48:00] came with the message.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now listen real close please.
[1:48:09] I'm not done.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; When he manifested himself,
[1:48:15] he manifested himself. And I'll just
[1:48:18] give it to you the way brother Brandon
[1:48:19] says in the in the unveiling of God said
[1:48:22] he manifested himself. He showed himself
[1:48:24] in a pillar of fire.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; For Moses age.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; He manifested himself then in the person
[1:48:33] of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] for that age.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Don't let your doctrine get in the way.
[1:48:43] Now, then he manifested himself by
[1:48:46] coming down on the day of Pentecost.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit so he could dwell in
[1:48:51] people.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, God above.
[1:48:57] In the New Testament, God with
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And now in the age of Christ, God in.
[1:49:04] Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Just stop there. God in.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Then I call on you to go to the mirror.
[1:49:18] And if you have the courage,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; say, "I'm looking at one that God is
[1:49:22] in."
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; God is in you.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; God is in you.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; God was manifest.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; So that I could point at you and say,
[1:49:43] "God is in you."
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; I can tell you someone else will be in
[1:49:50] attendance right away. And it'll be the
[1:49:51] serpent. It'll be Satan, the devil. And
[1:49:53] he will say all kinds of other things.
[1:49:56] Ah, you have this and ah, you do this
[1:49:58] and ah, you've thought that. And ah,
[1:50:01] you've had this feeling. Say, "Get
[1:50:03] behind me, Satan.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; I'm saying what God says. God is in me."
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; God is in this person.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; he manifested himself differently and
[1:50:20] I'm I'm Please, is it all right if I
[1:50:22] take a little bit more time?
[1:50:24] The reason why he manifested himself
[1:50:26] differently he says in one place for
[1:50:29] dispensation
[1:50:31] claims.
[1:50:34] Then brother Brown says
[1:50:37] he said I I'm
[1:50:39] I'm a man
[1:50:42] and I'm a husband
[1:50:46] and then I had a child and I became a
[1:50:49] father
[1:50:53] and then
[1:50:55] my son had a child and I became a
[1:50:57] grandfather.
[1:50:59] Now when I was 16,
[1:51:01] I couldn't be that
[1:51:04] age
[1:51:06] and time
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; had to bring him to had to mature him
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; to the place where he could be a
[1:51:13] husband.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; now watch it close. Then could be a
[1:51:19] father.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. and have a daughter,
[1:51:24] Rebecca, Sarah,
[1:51:27] and be a grandfather.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "My daughter has not got
[1:51:35] claims on me."
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; So, listen close now. I want you to put
[1:51:39] it together. When he manifest himself,
[1:51:43] he manifests himself in a certain way,
[1:51:46] in a certain age.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; A certain way. He didn't manifest
[1:51:50] himself in William Brandham's uh uh in
[1:51:53] his type of ministry in Luther's time.
[1:51:56] It wasn't the time or the place and the
[1:51:59] people, the elect were not there for
[1:52:01] that message.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; So he he manifested himself in different
[1:52:04] times. He manifest himself if he wanted
[1:52:07] you to see him as he walked the shores
[1:52:09] and to hear uh to hear the prophet uh
[1:52:12] John the Baptist say, "Behold the lamb
[1:52:14] of God." If he had intended you to be
[1:52:16] there for that manifestation, you'd have
[1:52:19] been standing there.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He would have had you there.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He's not a god of confusion. He has you
[1:52:25] here because this is your time.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? And this is your
[1:52:30] manifestation.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; This was manifest to destroy the works
[1:52:35] of the devil.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; This was manifest to bring a change in
[1:52:41] your body.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was manifest if you died to
[1:52:46] bring you out of the ground in a
[1:52:48] resurrection.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; This was manifest for the purpose of
[1:52:54] taking you to his house.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; And so he manifest himself in a certain
[1:53:04] way so that the people of that time
[1:53:07] would have claim on him.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Not only did he have a claim on you, he
[1:53:17] came for dispensational claims.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't come now just as the lamb of
[1:53:23] God.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; He came now as a bridegroom.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; To get a wife.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be a confusing God if here
[1:53:33] he came as a bridegroom? There is no
[1:53:35] wife.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; The denominations couldn't produce a
[1:53:39] wife. So God had to send that messenger
[1:53:43] and speak, "Come out from among them and
[1:53:46] be ye separate," says the Lord. And you
[1:53:48] know what happened? They came out.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Glory. And
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I can look in the mirror and say, "You
[1:53:58] came out."
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; I can also looked in the mirror and say,
[1:54:01] "You were kicked out."
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "My daughter has
[1:54:11] not got claims on me as a wife.
[1:54:17] My grandchild does not have claims on me
[1:54:22] as a son or a daughter because they're a
[1:54:24] granddaughter."
[1:54:27] That's the way he was as father
[1:54:30] and as son
[1:54:33] and in the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Those were different eras.
[1:54:39] And I want you to be able to go home
[1:54:41] today and ponder this very deep. He
[1:54:44] manifested himself for the purpose of
[1:54:47] laying a claim.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; When you look in the mirror, I want you
[1:54:51] also to be able to say something else.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; You have been claimed.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; You have been seized.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; You are a claimed one.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can also look in the
[1:55:06] mirror and say, "And you have rights."
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; You have certain rights.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Children can go to their parents and
[1:55:19] say, "Mom,
[1:55:22] dad,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; I have a certain need,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; a certain thing." And they respond in
[1:55:29] kind because they are your children.
[1:55:33] They are your offspring. You can look in
[1:55:36] the mirror and you should.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; You said, "I've identified the mass the
[1:55:42] manifestation of God in this hour."
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; I manifested. How come? The word.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; It grips me.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; The word
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; speaks to me.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; The word lays hold upon me.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; The word has claimed me.
[1:56:02] Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; What can you say up there in the
[1:56:04] balcony?
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; The word has claimed you.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; If that's not the case,
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; don't surrender your eyes to sleep
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; tonight until you know that in your
[1:56:19] heart and soul.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; I have been claimed.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to confuse it with a
[1:56:30] lot of words, but in my simplicity,
[1:56:35] I just thought today,
[1:56:40] one of the wife's
[1:56:42] main claims
[1:56:46] is that I go home
[1:56:49] with my husband. Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; I go to his house.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Look in the mirror
[1:57:01] and say you
[1:57:04] you are going
[1:57:06] to his house.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; You are the lamb's wife.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; That ought to do something.
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:19] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; there just too many things to say.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; God
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; to you unmarried
[1:57:32] to you ladies, young ladies that are
[1:57:34] eligible of age and don't have a
[1:57:36] husband,
[1:57:38] let me tell you, you have one.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You have a most wonderful husband.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; No earthly husband can love you like he
[1:57:47] will love you. That's right.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; No husband can care for you and feel
[1:57:56] what you feel like he can and like he
[1:57:58] does.
[1:58:01] And husbands, as I'm one, we make
[1:58:04] promises
[1:58:06] and not always able to keep them. We
[1:58:09] have good intentions, but we're not
[1:58:11] always able to keep them even though we
[1:58:13] want to.
[1:58:17] But I have one.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; And you keep every promise.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:26] And when he said,
[1:58:29] "Brother Larry,
[1:58:36] and to all you
[1:58:38] that listen to my voice and on the
[1:58:40] internet,
[1:58:42] I go away,
[1:58:46] but I will come and I'll receive you."
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; To myself.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] Amen.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It makes me want to shout hallelujah.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; It makes me want to sing praises to him.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; You've never seen a man like my husband.
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I say, "Father,
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:59:17] here's this piece of flesh. Here's this
[1:59:19] body.
[1:59:21] Whatever you can use it for,
[1:59:24] if it can get you just a a little bit
[1:59:26] more glory and praise and worship. I
[1:59:30] asked him this morning, Lord, praying
[1:59:32] for our brother Ed Naroo, not that he'll
[1:59:35] just have an able body, but that you'll
[1:59:38] be glorified.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; May you be glorified.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Don't give us just a great meeting to
[1:59:46] have a meeting, but that you'll be
[1:59:48] glorified.
[1:59:50] Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of it all
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; and so much more
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I could go on, but I'm not going to go
[2:00:01] on.
[2:00:07] I want you to leave here today
[2:00:11] really thinking over deep. I don't want
[2:00:13] this to be another service and I would
[2:00:15] really have felt I failed.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; But I want you all of you
[2:00:20] young people to work to you. Don't let
[2:00:22] the message ever become a tradition.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Those you that have been in the way a
[2:00:28] long time, don't ever let it to be a
[2:00:30] tradition.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; If you're even inclined that way or if
[2:00:34] you you know
[2:00:37] feel is just becoming a tradition, go
[2:00:40] and see what the prophet said about
[2:00:42] traditions and I tell you he tore them
[2:00:44] to shreds.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's an enemy to us.
[2:00:50] It'll it's a veil over our eyes.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Someone gets up and sings or someone
[2:00:58] gets up and preaches
[2:01:01] or brother or sister that's next to you.
[2:01:04] God
[2:01:11] give me eyes to see.
[2:01:16] Say, "Oh, I want to see Jesus. Lord, let
[2:01:18] me see Jesus." And Jesus would say,
[2:01:20] "Have I been so long with you?"
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; And you haven't seen Jesus.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Look beside you.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Look around you.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; But But I see this and I see that and I
[2:01:40] see so much.
[2:01:43] Have it been so long with you
[2:01:46] and have you not seen me?
[2:01:50] What did the manif What did the word
[2:01:52] What did the manifested word say?
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; See, he was closing now. He was in a
[2:02:00] pillar of fire form for that day
[2:02:04] to catch and bring those people out.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; He came in the form of flesh.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; He had to go to Calvary and take the
[2:02:12] body to be a sacrifice. Had to come in
[2:02:15] that form.
[2:02:18] Then he came in the form of spirit
[2:02:22] so
[2:02:23] he could he could be in you.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And one of the one of the greatest
[2:02:33] tactics of the devil would be to
[2:02:36] distract you so that you didn't see him
[2:02:39] in yourself
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; and you didn't see him in your brother
[2:02:43] or sister.
[2:02:45] That'll be the greatest
[2:02:48] victory for him.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; But now here's what the messenger said.
[2:02:56] Listen as I close.
[2:03:01] He's now in another form.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Called a bride form. Yeah,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit had to
[2:03:12] cultivate, had to form all through these
[2:03:16] centuries, had to form a bride. Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And so the word kept forming and molding
[2:03:23] the bride because he was going to come
[2:03:26] according to the scripture according to
[2:03:27] Revelation 10. He was going to descend
[2:03:30] not just to give us some new church or
[2:03:32] new ideas or new this not to give us
[2:03:34] some new tradition to give us and show
[2:03:36] us this is your husband.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I bought you.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And you know what she does?
[2:03:51] the bride would be veiled.
[2:03:54] And in the marriage ceremony of the
[2:03:56] east, the bride is veiled.
[2:03:59] Then when she meets her husband,
[2:04:02] she takes the veil from her face.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; And lays the veil on his shoulder.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; And he assumes responsibility for her
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; dispensation claims.
[2:04:18] He came because she was there. He came
[2:04:21] because she was mature. She was
[2:04:23] eligible. He came and received her.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; And revealed himself, appeared,
[2:04:28] manifested.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Fo made himself visible.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And some saw it and said
[2:04:38] cult.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Some saw it and said strange people.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Some saw it and said all kinds of
[2:04:46] things.
[2:04:52] But some saw it said, "I see
[2:04:56] the perfect one.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I see my lover.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; I see my husband."
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; He's come to claim me.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And so now I come to the scripture that
[2:05:13] I opened with.
[2:05:24] But we all
[2:05:27] we all
[2:05:30] by the way internet
[2:05:32] people wherever you are in the world
[2:05:34] listening
[2:05:36] we all
[2:05:39] not with veiled face
[2:05:42] with open face.
[2:05:44] the Lord.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's this time we all with open face
[2:05:50] beholding as in a glass.
[2:05:54] What is it we behold?
[2:05:56] Oh,
[2:05:58] it's not we're beholding
[2:06:01] this corrupt piece of flesh,
[2:06:03] trying to make it look better,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's not the point. trying to draw on
[2:06:09] the world to make ourselves more
[2:06:11] acceptable or more appealing or more
[2:06:14] beautiful. That's that's the world.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; We all with open face.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Looking in a glass
[2:06:25] beholding,
[2:06:27] not a glance, staring at the glory of
[2:06:31] God. See what the messenger said. I tell
[2:06:34] you friends, what what was sent to us in
[2:06:37] this time was nothing short of the glory
[2:06:40] of God.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; I say to you, we have seen
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; his glory.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Not all seen it. Many would look at it
[2:06:50] and say, "What's wonderful about that?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; What's wonderful about Calvary? What's
[2:06:58] wonderful about this man
[2:07:00] bleeding out his last breaths?
[2:07:04] What's wonderful about this crown of
[2:07:06] thorns? What's wonderful about this rib
[2:07:08] showing through this body? What's
[2:07:10] wonderful? But God looked upon it.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; My beloved son
[2:07:18] in whom I'm well pleased.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; The purchase of the earth. The earth is
[2:07:23] being purchased. God saw the blood going
[2:07:25] down. God was claiming the earth back to
[2:07:28] his original purpose.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we need eyesight. Not man's
[2:07:35] eyesight. You need the eyes of God.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; You might want to join me and say, "Oh
[2:07:43] God,
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; give me,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; give me the vision.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Give me the kind of sight I need to have
[2:07:51] in this time.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; God, open my eyes." Amen.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; And I may see what you have for us.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; We behold his glory.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And here's the big one, friends.
[2:08:11] And
[2:08:13] are changed.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to have this so indelibly
[2:08:20] marked on your mind. I'd like to go to
[2:08:22] every one of your seats.
[2:08:25] And say this in your ear. He does not
[2:08:28] say in our chains depending on.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; He's not saying our change if
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; says you are changed into the image.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; As we behold him.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; The only thing you do is just look at
[2:08:49] the right thing.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; And you keep looking at it. You keep
[2:08:52] looking at it. Amen.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; I see this brother standing many times
[2:08:59] because his heart rings
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Just keep looking
[2:09:03] at it, my brother.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Just keep beholding it.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Behold that manifestation. This is what
[2:09:09] thrills me.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; This is what thrills me. Everything I
[2:09:12] can identify how he manifested himself.
[2:09:14] This is what thrills me because I know I
[2:09:17] know I I I felt so pressed this morning.
[2:09:22] Convey this to the people. Get it to the
[2:09:24] people that they must look. Just look.
[2:09:28] Just look and live. Look upon this
[2:09:30] manifestation. You don't have to
[2:09:32] generate anything. You don't have to
[2:09:34] bring the spirit down. He's already
[2:09:36] here.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I can't quit. I got just one more.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; This was a whole segment of the message
[2:09:46] this morning, but I haven't got time to
[2:09:48] get to it, but I'll just drop it in.
[2:09:51] Brother Brandham, he's dwelling on what
[2:09:53] it is we're seeing and the God in
[2:09:56] different forms.
[2:09:58] And then he goes to Elisha at Dothan.
[2:10:02] And the Syrian armies were sent
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; to capture him
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; because every time Syria tried to take
[2:10:10] the Israel and the king of Israel, they
[2:10:12] were there. They weren't there. They
[2:10:14] were disappeared. And the king called
[2:10:16] all of his servants and said, "Who here
[2:10:18] is for the king of Israel?" And one
[2:10:21] little servant stood up and said, "Sir,
[2:10:24] your honor, no one here is a traitor,
[2:10:29] they have a prophet down there."
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And that prophet tells him what you
[2:10:33] think in your bed chamber.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; And this king says, "Go get him." And
[2:10:38] the Bible says he sent a host,
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; a host of horsemen and chariots and get
[2:10:45] this prophet and bring him here. I need
[2:10:48] a prophet like that.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And his servant woke up in the morning
[2:10:54] and said,
[2:10:58] "What shall we do, man of God?
[2:11:01] What shall we do? We're surrounded.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Armies are everywhere.
[2:11:08] Chariots and horsemen are everywhere.
[2:11:11] What shall we do?
[2:11:14] Elijah said, "Open the young man's
[2:11:16] eyes."
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And when his eyes were opened, he saw
[2:11:23] the hills full
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; of chariots of fire.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; The hills didn't change.
[2:11:31] [Applause]
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; The scenery didn't change.
[2:11:35] That's right.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; His seeing. And the brother Brandham
[2:11:38] said he changed his seeing.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; He only changed his seeing.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, this was my
[2:11:47] message to you today. I pray that God
[2:11:49] will almighty
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; sweep through Cloverdale Bible Way
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; and change the seeing of the people.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; The pulpit doesn't have to change. The
[2:12:03] building doesn't have to change. The
[2:12:06] people that you're sitting with don't
[2:12:07] have to change. It's your seeing that
[2:12:09] needs to change.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; let me see the almighty God.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; in his people
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; in bride form.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; open my eyes that I may see.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Change my seeing Lord.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I say
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; this is my prayer.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; change my seeing.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Let me see.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Let me see Jesus what you see.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Let me see the people as you see them.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Let me see the blood as you see them.
[2:13:00] Amen.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Let me see the bride as you see them.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Let me see my brothers and sisters as
[2:13:06] you see them.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Shall we all rise?
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:35] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[2:13:42] Father,
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; father eternal God
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; that has sent forth Jesus Christ not
[2:13:52] only as the lamb and the redeemer.
[2:13:56] We see these attributes that have come
[2:13:59] how glorious they are.
[2:14:02] You were a healer and they were sick
[2:14:04] because they needed to be healed.
[2:14:07] You were a savior and there were lost
[2:14:10] that needed to be saved. And today,
[2:14:12] Lord, in this day, we need now today, oh
[2:14:17] God, to see you in your fullness.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; To see you in the consummation of the
[2:14:23] age, to see you, oh God, that you've
[2:14:26] come on the scene to call the dead from
[2:14:29] the graves
[2:14:31] as the resurrection was in in Matthew
[2:14:34] 27.
[2:14:35] There must be indeed another
[2:14:37] resurrection. Oh God,
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; we are viewing the manifestation of the
[2:14:41] one
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; who came with a shout, who came with a
[2:14:45] voice
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and the trumpet of God.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Here we are in this hour, in this great
[2:14:51] hour. Lord, we're not here to miss it.
[2:14:53] We're here to participate in it. We're
[2:14:55] here to be part of it.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; we let us sanctify. And we do sanctify
[2:15:02] ourselves
[2:15:04] that we might hear you that we might see
[2:15:06] you
[2:15:08] that we might know you whom to know is
[2:15:10] life eternal.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Father, thy will I pray be done.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Thy perfect will
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could just sing I don't
[2:15:24] have the number.
[2:15:26] Open my eyes that I may see
[2:15:30] uh
[2:15:33] truth thou hast for me. Glimpses of
[2:15:35] truth thou hast for me. I pray
[2:15:38] earnestly. I'm asking God.
[2:15:42] I came to the pulpit today with great
[2:15:46] desire in my heart
[2:15:49] that God will minister to you precious
[2:15:51] people. each one
[2:15:55] and we may we may have within our minds
[2:15:58] that this is my need or this is my need.
[2:16:01] I can tell you the answer to every need
[2:16:03] is to see
[2:16:06] to see what he wants you to see. And if
[2:16:10] you look at that and look on him, your
[2:16:14] answer is certain.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; So let's sing this prayerfully. Open my
[2:16:21] eyes that I may see.
[2:16:25] Open my eyes
[2:16:28] that I
[2:16:31] may see
[2:16:34] glimpses of truth.
[2:16:37] Thou hast
[2:16:40] for me.
[2:16:43] Place in my hand
[2:16:47] the wonder
[2:16:52] that shall unclass
[2:16:55] and set
[2:16:57] me free.
[2:17:01] Silently
[2:17:03] bell
[2:17:04] I wait
[2:17:07] for thee.
[2:17:10] Be my God
[2:17:13] I will
[2:17:16] to see.
[2:17:19] Open my eyes
[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:17:31] if I
[2:17:33] verse three. Please open my mouth. Open
[2:17:38] my mouth
[2:17:40] and let me
[2:17:45] gladly
[2:17:48] truth everywhere.
[2:17:54] Oh my
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:18:02] love with my children.
[2:18:07] to share
[2:18:10] silently
[2:18:12] now.
[2:18:14] I wait for thee.
[2:18:19] Raise my heart. Thy will to see.
[2:18:27] Open my eyes
[2:18:31] and illuminate.
[2:18:33] [Music]
[2:18:39] If I
[2:18:42] I want to sing a verse or two also of it
[2:18:45] is well with my soul. And if I could
[2:18:48] redirect your vision a wee bit this
[2:18:50] morning or perhaps turn it completely,
[2:18:54] I'd like to turn your vision from being
[2:18:58] so completely consumed or occupied
[2:19:01] with this passing world because it's
[2:19:04] going to pass away. We have to deal with
[2:19:06] it. We have to work. We have these
[2:19:07] burdens. We have those things. But we
[2:19:10] need to keep our eyes fixed, friends,
[2:19:12] upon a goal. I don't want to I don't
[2:19:15] want to diminish the message this
[2:19:17] morning. We need this desperately.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; This congregation needs it desperately.
[2:19:22] Believers today need it desperately.
[2:19:26] [Music]
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Not that it means anything to you. I was
[2:19:32] supposed to be in Edmonton this morning
[2:19:35] and preach
[2:19:38] and I felt I needed to be here
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; and this was the message and quite
[2:19:43] frankly I was 90% probably 75 80 90%
[2:19:47] through with another message. I felt
[2:19:51] certain I was to speak that message
[2:19:55] and midweek this last week
[2:19:58] just God just turned it right corners
[2:20:01] and dropped this in preach this and I
[2:20:06] can tell you friends I didn't probably
[2:20:08] get any more than halfway through. I
[2:20:10] tell you in the name of the Lord this
[2:20:12] message is for this congregation this
[2:20:15] morning. And if you're here visiting
[2:20:17] it's for you. If you're on the internet
[2:20:19] streaming, if you happen to get on by
[2:20:21] accident, it's not an accident.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; This message is for all who heard it
[2:20:25] today. We need our vision turned, our
[2:20:29] eyes turned off of this onto him, not
[2:20:32] him of history, him of the resurrected
[2:20:35] Christ of this day, who's glorified
[2:20:37] himself.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; We just heard this last week the about
[2:20:46] the author of this song, When Peace Like
[2:20:49] a River. I guess many of you know it.
[2:20:51] Someone sent us a DVD and we saw a
[2:20:53] little bit of his life.
[2:20:56] This man became a wealthy man in Chicago
[2:21:00] and they had four daughters and a son
[2:21:03] and his baby son was taken in scarlet
[2:21:08] fever I believe it was and died as an
[2:21:11] infant
[2:21:13] and broke his heart. It was his only
[2:21:14] son.
[2:21:16] And then I believe he was actually away
[2:21:20] and the great fire of Chicago which
[2:21:24] burned a big part of the city. He had
[2:21:26] vast holdings of real estate and his
[2:21:30] holdings were lost in this massive fire
[2:21:34] and he became almost like a penniless
[2:21:36] man. he lost all of his wealth
[2:21:40] and then he was a great friend
[2:21:44] of uh I believe Dwight Moody or one of
[2:21:46] the great ministers of the past and a
[2:21:49] great supporter and there were meetings
[2:21:50] taking place in England and he decided
[2:21:54] that he and his whole family would go
[2:21:57] and he booked a he booked a a cruise on
[2:22:00] a on a big ship and just before they
[2:22:04] were to go he was called for some very
[2:22:06] very important meetings that he couldn't
[2:22:09] miss and he had to go and attend to
[2:22:12] these meetings a very important I think
[2:22:14] it had something to do with the loss of
[2:22:15] his property
[2:22:17] and so he he was insistent that his wife
[2:22:19] and children go
[2:22:22] and that the ship that they were on was
[2:22:24] broadsided by another ship and it sunk
[2:22:27] in 12 minutes and he lost he lost his
[2:22:30] four beautiful daughters
[2:22:33] all upgrowing women now. And his wife
[2:22:37] was found sometime later clinging to a
[2:22:40] some debris
[2:22:42] and they flew her to England
[2:22:45] and uh and she wrote a note to her
[2:22:50] husband and just said saved alone.
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:22:58] And the commentator was saying it's just
[2:23:01] it's impossible to comprehend
[2:23:05] the grief and the depths of sorrow
[2:23:08] and disappointment.
[2:23:11] But he said his anchor
[2:23:14] was steadfast.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Loss of all five children
[2:23:21] almost his wife and lost his entire
[2:23:26] livelihood
[2:23:28] and his possessions.
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:31] And he penned these words.
[2:23:34] When peace like a river
[2:23:37] attendeth my soul, when sorrows like sea
[2:23:40] billows roll,
[2:23:42] whatever my lot,
[2:23:45] thou has taught me to say,
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; it is well, it is well with my soul.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Friends, it makes me feel small.
[2:23:55] I intend to see this man. I intend to
[2:23:59] shake his hand. I tend to tell him this
[2:24:02] song was one of the great anthems of our
[2:24:05] church.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Because it sound it rung true to the
[2:24:10] lives of the people. Is it your anthem?
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Does it have something special for you?
[2:24:19] Let's sing it together, please.

[2:24:32] attend

[2:28:44] for
[2:28:47] [Music]
[2:28:50] the sky.
[2:28:58] [Music]
[2:29:00] Oh sh
[2:29:04] [Music]
[2:29:15] my soul
[2:29:18] [Music]
[2:29:24] in my soul.
[2:29:27] My soul.
[2:29:29] He is well.
[2:29:32] He is well
[2:29:35] my soul.
[2:29:40] [Music]
[2:29:48] Those
[2:29:52] words cost a lot.
[2:29:54] [Music]
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; These words cost a man, his family.
[2:29:59] I can't imagine it.
[2:30:02] Cost him almost everything.
[2:30:07] And I hope this doesn't sound out of
[2:30:09] place,
[2:30:11] but I'm thankful that he gave a song
[2:30:15] to the world that we can identify with.
[2:30:21] And I pray God,
[2:30:24] give each of you as we enter this week
[2:30:26] of camp,
[2:30:29] give you a true vision. Just say, God,
[2:30:32] give me your sight. Give me your vision.
[2:30:35] Give me your eyesight. Anoint my eyes
[2:30:38] with eyesight.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you and God bless you. Thank you
[2:30:45] for your prayers and thank you for being
[2:30:48] so attentive this morning. Really
[2:30:51] appreciate it. Brother Tom, would you
[2:30:53] come? I don't Did they make that
[2:30:54] announcement for the counselors just
[2:30:57] after right there? quickly after we
[2:31:00] dismiss if I can meet everybody in the
[2:31:02] fellowship room that will be counselors
[2:31:04] this year at the Bible way camp and
[2:31:08] we'll have a quick meeting and we'll
[2:31:09] send you on your way. Let's pray.
[2:31:17] Lord,
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:22] how often have been our prayers over the
[2:31:23] years? Show us the Father,
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; and this would suffice us, Lord,
[2:31:31] to see your glory, to see your
[2:31:33] unveiling,
[2:31:34] to see the manifestation of your word
[2:31:36] within our lives. That's what we crave
[2:31:39] for. That's what we long for.
[2:31:41] [Music]
[2:31:43] As I heard this morning, Lord, we've got
[2:31:45] one claim left. We want to go home with
[2:31:48] you.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled, for I've
[2:31:52] gone to prepare a place for you, Lord.
[2:31:55] What a place that is. What a blessed
[2:31:58] hope. What a blessed promise. And that's
[2:32:00] what we live for, Lord, to put on this
[2:32:02] rapture change. And we've heard the
[2:32:04] shout, Lord. We're hearing the voice of
[2:32:06] the resurrection. Lord, we want that
[2:32:08] great trump to sound.
[2:32:11] catch this waiting bride away. And Lord,
[2:32:13] any wrongs, make them right within our
[2:32:15] lives, Lord. But we could humble
[2:32:18] ourselves before the throne of grace and
[2:32:20] say, "Lord, have your divine will and
[2:32:22] way within all of our lives, with on all
[2:32:25] our hearts." Lord, we want to look into
[2:32:28] this glorious mirror and say, "Mirror,
[2:32:30] mirror of your word, Lord. We want to
[2:32:32] become what we hear." And we just pray,
[2:32:35] God, that you'll open our eyes to see
[2:32:36] more of your glory, our ears to hear
[2:32:39] what the spirit would say. Lord, we want
[2:32:41] to get caught up with you, with this
[2:32:44] word, with this unveiling, with this
[2:32:47] immorphy of God that we might display
[2:32:51] this bride form that you have called us
[2:32:54] to display. We've heard a blessed word,
[2:32:57] Lord. May we not lose it with
[2:32:58] conversation, but may we be like Mary
[2:33:01] pondering this word of God. And that,
[2:33:03] Father, that as we ponder it and
[2:33:05] meditate on it, Lord, this is why you've
[2:33:08] sent it that it would manifest and
[2:33:11] change our very lives. Go with us, Lord.
[2:33:14] And as we've been praying for this camp,
[2:33:16] for our young people, for our children,
[2:33:19] that they could get caught up in the
[2:33:21] spirit of revelation that might they
[2:33:23] might know you in the power of your
[2:33:25] resurrection. We pray for every
[2:33:27] counselor, Lord. We pray for the
[2:33:29] meetings. We pray, God, you will give us
[2:33:30] the mind of Christ. We thank you for
[2:33:34] this gathering this morning. We thank
[2:33:35] you for a pastor this morning. We thank
[2:33:37] you for a man of God that can hear from
[2:33:40] the throne of grace and thunder forth
[2:33:42] the thought of God. We pray you'll
[2:33:44] strengthen him, Lord. And may this word
[2:33:46] change us. Go with your people. And
[2:33:50] Brother Lance will be ministering in
[2:33:51] Seattle. Anoint the man of God. We pray.
[2:33:54] Brother DDA is recovering from his
[2:33:56] operation. Strengthen him, we ask. Lord,
[2:33:59] be with your children as we will be with
[2:34:01] one another this afternoon. May you be
[2:34:03] glorified in all that we say and do. Go
[2:34:06] with your children now. We pray in
[2:34:09] Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:34:12] God bless you. Greet one another. You're
[2:34:14] dismissed in Jesus name.
