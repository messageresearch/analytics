[0:00] always through the scripture it's when
[0:02] the people talk about God that's when he
[0:05] appeared now we're too busy talking
[0:07] about other things I think that's the
[0:09] reason many people who love him fail to
[0:11] see him we're so busy with our Creeds
[0:14] and denominations and business about the
[0:16] churches and memberships and getting
[0:17] more members and things we're too busy
[0:20] to talk about him he's the
[0:22] word we're too interested what the some
[0:25] Creed some textbook or something else
[0:27] says how many members can we get in vote
[0:29] them in shall we take this one that one
[0:30] the other we should be constantly giving
[0:33] ourselves to the word of God In
[0:36] Prayer studying the
[0:38] word but we're too interested in
[0:41] something else
