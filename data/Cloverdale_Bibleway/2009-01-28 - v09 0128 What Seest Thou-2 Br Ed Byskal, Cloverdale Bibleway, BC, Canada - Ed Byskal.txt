TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] to another. Oh, give us clean hands. Give us pure hearts. Let us not lift our souls to another. Oh God, let's be a generation that sees seek your face. Oh God of Jacob. Oh God, let us be a generation that sees. See your face. Oh God of Jacob, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everybody happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to be gathered with saints of like precious faith that come hungering, come desiring the word. The scripture reminds us if you come hungry, if you come thirsting, he's more than able, more than happy to give us all that we're able and more than we can receive. Amen. Why don't we turn the screen on to number uh 582. [Music] Start the song service with I would not be denied. &gt;&gt; Many times we see in the scripture, somebody wanted something, somebody wanted something, they wouldn't be denied. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they kept pressing. We're going to press on tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the presence of the Lord to sweep down over the congregation. How many times the prophet says, "Now, we'll just wait on the Lord." Here he comes around. Can you see him coming around the back? It's not bad sitting in the back. It's for those of you that have to sit in the back with little children. I enjoy it back there because I know I asked the Lord the end of the service from my heart. I say, "Lord, as soon as you get here, before somebody else asks, I have a need." And many times he comes right right around that area. Many come to the front. I can't always get to the front. I'm in the back first. So, we just take our position, our post of duty where we are. Say, "Lord, deal with me tonight wherever we are." Amen. When pains of death seized over my soul, unto the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Well, I would not be denied. I would not be Jesus. I would not be as fle in the days old. I wrestled with the Lord and he s with the I should well I could not be I would not be till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be old Satan said my Lord was not hear my prayer but praise the Lord the work is done and Christ our Lord is here where I would not be [Applause] till Jesus Hey, I would not be [Music] [Applause] [Music] Why don't we just sing it again? I would not be I would not be if Jesus came and I would not be. &gt;&gt; I think we need to sing that last verse of God again. &gt;&gt; Satan said the Lord was gone, &gt;&gt; but he is here. &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy and a couple of brothers have a song for us. So maybe we'll just sing this a time or two again while they're coming and getting ready. Old Satan said my Lord was gone. He will not hear my prayer but praise the Lord. The work is done and Christ our Lord is here. I would not be willing. [Music] If Jesus came and made me once again I could not be I could not be till Jesus came and made me. [Music] Amen. God bless you. May have your seats tonight. There was a time on earth when In the books of heaven, that an old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven. My name was at the top with many things below. But I went unto the keeper. And I settled it long ago. Long ago. Long ago. I said long. Yes. The old account was settled long ago. And the record's clear today, for he washed my sins away. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. Well, the old account was large and growing every day. For I was always sinning, and I never tried to pray. But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and war, I thought I'd better settle. And I settled it long ago. Long ago on my knees long ago. I settled it all. Yes. The old account was settled long ago. And the records clear today for he washed my sins away. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. Now sinners, seek the Lord. Repent of all your sins. For thus he has commanded. If you would enter in and if you should live 100 years below, you know you got it settled cuz you settled it long ago. Long ago. down on my knees long ago. I settled it all. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. And the records clear today for he washed my sins away. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. Long ago, &gt;&gt; down on my knees. &gt;&gt; Long ago, &gt;&gt; I settled. Yes. The old account was settled long ago and the records clear today. For he washed my sins away. Yes. The old account was settled long ago. Long ago. Long ago. I settled it all. Yes. The old account was settled long ago. And the record's clear today. For he washed my sins away. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. And the records clear today for he washed my sins away. Yes, the old account was settled long ago. Long ago. Well, these guys are singing pretty good, aren't they? &gt;&gt; I think we should maybe have them help me sing a song. That's a good idea. When you got good singers, you don't really relinquish them very quickly. Okay. So, you won't hold me for holding them. All right. Number 381 on the screen. Undefiled. That's what we're That's what we're singing about. Pure, clean lives. Amen. Only the sword of the word cut away sin in our lives. And that's our desire. Amen. Why don't we just sing this together as we get ready to turn the service to brother Bisl. [Music] Undefiled, real pure life. Walking [Applause] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sound of victory in the camp. [Applause] listening to the brothers sing the song and I couldn't help but think it's a wonderful thing when we are able to make the last payment on anything we owe. &gt;&gt; You've had that experience. Make the last payment. I'm free. I'm done. &gt;&gt; Well, when we look at Calvary, that was the last payment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. The last payment. Amen. and he paid it all. &gt;&gt; We're going to have prayer and I just wanted to take just a moment before we uh go into prayer. We want to be remembering our brother Edwin Dods again this evening and the Dods family. And I need to make an announcement that the hospital staff and the family uh are have said that there can be no visitors, just the immediate family. So even though you're a good friend and you've been there before and and all the rest of it and you're you know the ropes and all, but uh the I just got that call before I left and they don't wish to have any visitors at all. It's just the immediate family and and I can certainly understand that. I I've I've never been uh in the place where brother Edwin Dods is, but even if I get feeling not well, I don't want to see anybody. I just want to lay there comeosse and let the healing take place in my body and just have rest. But but he's in a condition where he needs complete rest. So I know that you will respect that. And I would say rather than even visit, I've been there once, but rather than visit, I would take that time and get on my face before God and hold him up in prayer. And he'll do far more for them than for visiting. So, God bless you. As as we remember, and I told them we would be holding him up in prayer. They were uh trying to get u uh a food a tube in so they could feed him. And they have now uh done that because he needed to be fed. So, we want to be praying for our brother Edwin Dodds. They all the CAT scans have showed that the bleeding has stopped and we're praising the Lord for that. Hallelujah. Uh, Brother Lance's uh mom was uh admitted to the hospital today and just for some observation and some to have have some uh check. Uh so I'd like uh he asked that we would remember his mom in prayer, our sister Dorothy Laroo. And I have these please remember uh me in prayer as I have a severe respiratory infection and I'm in need of healing healing touch and I have another urgent uh request at this time and and Lisa Sister Lisa St. John and she's at home not well and streaming the service. So, Sister Lisa, we're praying for you. So, let's just all come before the Lord in in prayer and and know that he cares for us and he cares for these that we're praying for. Heavenly Father, oh, how wonderful that we can come to you praying to the living God, the only true and living God. We're not praying or bowing before some stone statue or we're not holding some metal in our hand or some icon. Oh God, we have the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of William Brham, the God of the apostles. Lord Jesus, we are coming in your name. And we know that that name is the name that's above every name. And it was you, Lord Jesus, that went to Calvary. It was you that cried out, "It is finished from those lips." Oh God, how grateful we are today for the great price that was paid. And how how willing, Lord Jesus, you were to give yourself freely for your body, for your people, for your elect, and whom for the joy that was set before you. And now this evening, Lord, as we've gathered here, this is the hour of prayer. This is a time that we are remembering, Lord Jesus, these sick and needy ones, our sister Lisa St. John. Lord, pray you'll raise her up. Rebuke the enemy, oh God. Her faith and confidence is in you, our brother Edwin Dods. Lord, what a lovely spirit. What a witness. Oh God, what a soldier he's been. Not for the US uh Air Force, but for you, oh God. Oh, Father. And he'll fly higher than a Air Force ever took him. Oh, God. Oh, God. What a promise we have that we'll be caught up together with those resurrected ones. Pray that you'll raise them up, Lord. Thank you for causing this bleeding to cease. Strengthen the family, Lord. Inspire them with faith, oh God. And may our our faith now reach out to you, dear Lord. Brother Lance's mom, Lord. Pray for our sister Dorothy, how you healed her so many years ago from that arthritis and and from that kidney stone. Lord, how faithful you've been. Touch her body tonight. We pray let her know that the ever never failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is beside her. And for the service now and all that will be said and done, we do it for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Now I'm going to speak in a few minutes but just before we do going to let you uh be blessed by what has been taking place and just a small area perhaps in Mexico but brother Jake Dick has some pictures and he has made several trips down to Mexico where they lived the family and so I don't want to take any more time. He's going to take about 15 minutes and show you some pictures and just tell you about a little bit about what God is doing down there. So, Brother Jake, come. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just thankful for individuals that just feel a burden on their heart and say, "I want to be a witness. Here I go." God bless you, Brother Jake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, good to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Enjoy the service. Little hard for me to stand up here, but anyway, we'll do our part. Just give a little report. First of all, I want to give you greetings from some of the different places I visited. I went down to Mterrey, Mexico. And uh actually, I flew down to to El Paso, Texas, and met with a brother down there, Brother Ruben Rivera. He's just across the line down in uh Sodad Huades which is Mexico right across the border. Uh from there I flew down or uh went with my uncle into Texas and he sends greetings also my uncle Abe Dyke and uh then I went down to Mterrey and from there actually took a bus down to Mont uh Laredo Texas and the brother from Mterrey came and picked me up and from there we spent some time with them down there the believers and from there We went down to uh uh we traveled around a little further south. We went down into the interior further down to Tamolipas. I'll just show show some of these pictures just shortly. But uh we had a wonderful time with the believers and they all sent greetings and their love. So, uh, we're very much interested in what God is doing, &gt;&gt; you know, through the Spanish. And my burden's been, uh, briefly for the Menites, like my people, where we came from. I've been really burdened. I've been thinking through the years, you know, there's never been a a real witness among those, the Menanites. and it's been on my heart and thinking knowing that I know the language I wonder is there anybody else can do something down there and I've been looking searching nobody seems to have any outreach in that direction so it's been on my heart so I've tried to do what I can just to reach out to the different colonies and I'll just go through some of them and I was able to visit some at this time so I'll just go to these pictures Now, um, this is, uh, let me just see. Okay, here you see Mexico. And, uh, I'll just take a quick moment to show where I was at. Let me just see if I can figure this thing out. &gt;&gt; Okay, there's El Paso, Texas. I went from there down to Hobbes, New Mexico and Semino, Texas. That's where my uncle lives. I've got some uncles there. From there, we went down to all the way to Laredo, Texas. You can see that there. From there, a pastor picked us up and we went down to Mter Reay and then traveled further south to Victoria and in that area. So there's Mexico. Here's the brother from u just across the border from El Paso, Texas. This is brother Rubeno Rivera. I've met with him before and uh my uncle took me down there. We spent an evening with them. Took a service in down there. Here's Mterrey. You can see it's uh third largest city in Mexico. Population is 1.1 million and the area metropolitan area has about 3.8 million people. So you can see it's very large. There's about five different message churches in there. About three of them fellowship together. and uh consists of seven big cities and then a number of smaller cities. This is uh Bible way Christian Academy launched on an endeavor to raise funds for a print station in Montterrey Novel, Mexico. And uh we were there, we were able to spend some time with some of the believers there, fellowship with them, and uh we were able to get quite a few over a hundred uh files, message files in Spanish from him. &gt;&gt; So those are now up on the web. And it's very interesting what God is doing there. And it's just been a real burden of my heart just to get as much into the Spanish language as possible. Not only the German, I've been burdened for them, but the different travels that I've been there, the different times I've gotten to know the believers in Mexico, different places. So, we've done what we can. Now, we working as much as we can to get the messages on the hub. So, this is brother Estraa. He's the pastor from the church in Mterrey. He's associated with about another three different churches. They're in close fellowship down there. Um there's may he asked me to minister for them. There's the church. Another picture of the church. They've got about uh 70 or 80 people. There's some of the children. There's the building from the outside. They've the top area is like a little fellowship room. On the bottom they have uh a few extra rooms. And there you see they have a hallway going up to the top which is the sanctuary. There's a sanctuary right at the top. Here's some of the uh young people and the three different pastors that are uh just point them out to you. That's brother Estraa. This is brother Adula Mata. He is from uh El Paso, Texas. He's a pastor there. He's probably got about 70 or 80 people also. That is brother David DeLeon. He's all he's from Saltio, which is a little further west of uh Montterrey down there. He also has about 70 people, I believe, or 80 people. There's some of the brothers uh that were at Mterrey. I must uh point out this one brother. Sorry, I hit the wrong button. Okay, this brother down here that is brother Sebastian of Vieo. He is from San Louis Pisi. San Louis Pi is the capital city of San Louis Pi. is a little further uh just one sec. Okay, I don't have the map. He's from further south and he's he's uh got a little church down there also and he's very burdened for some of the native Indians down there and he goes down travels to missions and he was very interested in the the Prince Station also and it just been very burdened to get something like that to him. He uh he travels to La La Lasta which is uh on the east side. It's a big region. There's a lot of natives down there. Okay, here I'm heading south. I stopped at about 2 hours south of uh Mterrey in a little town called uh Viagran Tamo Lipas and it's it's circled down there. Of course, this is brother Domingo. Uh he's from Vagran. and brother Eduardo. He's the brother that took me around to many different places. He's actually a son-in-law to brother Estrea. Here's the family of brother Domingo, his wife and three children. And then we traveled further south uh to Santa and Gracia, a very tiny town. And that's just outside of uh Victoria. Sead Victoria. It's called City of Victoria. Oh, sorry. Not quite used to this thing. Here's Victoria down here. And there's Santa and Gracia. There's there's many different believers. I'm just going to say there's there's many different believers. just tiny little groups scattered out all over the different places and they don't have much fellowship. They don't have much they're very poor people and uh they they need they need the message, they need the books, they need everything they can get. So here's sorry here's the uh a brother I think they're called the Zuniga family. I'm not sure if I said that right. Anyway, here's their place here. We're visiting with them. We traveled further down to Victoria and Ecotanka and Estasion Gonzalez. The pronunciation's a little different, I'm sure, but it's in Spanish. Victoria, Sead, Victoria is quite a big city, and uh I was trying to find some of the Menites around there. Many times what I do, I'll travel to different places when I know there's Menites around and u I'll just search for them, start to make an introduction if I find somebody like this fell down here. He's a Menite in Victoria. So I was able to contact him through some of the people in the area there and ask him where the colony is and how to get there. So, he gave us directions and also I gave him some books and he was very receptive. So, we're just waiting to see what God is doing there. Uh there you can see about three young Menite boys there in the uh that's down in Gonzalez. I was able to witness to them. I was at a little store, stopped by a little store in the colony there and spoke to them and uh they're happy to receive some message books. They never heard of what God has done in this hour. The colonies, they're so so isolated. They don't want anything strange, any doctrines to come in. But uh some of the people are very hungry for the things of God. So here's uh another brother. Uh this brother in the green checkered shirt, this brother, that's brother uh Romero Nava. He's from Eotena. He's uh he's actually in charge of the little group down there. And uh this fell is Henry Penner and this is David Penner. They're Menites. He's fluent in German and Spanish. No English. He's fluent in English, German, and Spanish. Now, this contact, I was able to make this contact just about three or four weeks before I left from here and uh a fellow from from uh Vanderhof, BC. uh he came and visited my dad which he was a f friend a boy childhood friend of my dad's and when I spoke to them we were speaking together and his spoke to his wife and I mentioned I was heading that direction so his wife just mentioned that she has a brother down there so he gave me she gave me the contact and that's how I was able to make contact down there and he we had a wonderful time around the word with him we spent a lot of time and probably about an hour and a half or and uh gave him some books and right now they're reading the books. His son is reading the books and we're in just in contact right now. Uh this is uh brother Romero's wife and children. I just uh that's his wife and son and two daughters. And this is another brother Alfredo Perez. He's also he's from Mterrey. He traveled with me going down to the colony there and the different we visited the different believers there. So then I went back traveled back to Mterrey from there and then brother Estraa asked me to go visit another church brother David DeLeon which I did and he's in Salio which is uh right down here this fairsiz city now crossing Mterrey we're down in Apodaka it was about an hour and a half to cross the city And from Santa Katrina from there all to all the way to Saltio is only about 45 minutes. That gives you how busy this an idea how busy the city is. So we travel down there to Saltio. This is the church. They've taken a garage, a shop uh and just gutted it out and just transformed it into a church. So there's myself speaking again in brother David DeLeon. He's perfect in translation. He's he's very fluent in English. So he's uh called a number of times. He's invited you, brother Ed, to come down and he's invited us back again. And he's just a wonderful group of people. There's the church. It's not very full this time, but I think 70 80 people. Here's the children. some of the brothers, some of the sisters, and then some of the young people. From there, we headed back to Texas, El Paso, Texas. And uh incidentally, I might just mention my family, our family, we've uh I wasn't able to visit my relatives this time. They are from uh if you see El Paso, Texas here. If you go down to Chihuahua, that's where my family was raised in Kok, that's where most of them were born. My family knows all about this. And there's in this surrounding area called Chihuahua. I was searching it up a little while ago. There's more than 50,000 Menites that are uh scattered in different colonies down there. And I've been there quite a few times, been very burdened, and I wasn't able to reach them at this time. But uh a lot of them have turned to the world. they've turned to drugs, you know, because they have no satisfying, nothing satisfying from the system. So, I've been very burdened to get back to them. There's quite a few contacts I have there, but the Lord just didn't allow it at this time, but we'll go back soon, Lord willing. So, anyway, we traveled back to El Paso, Texas. Uh met with uh brother Adula Mata. He's the pastor of a little church there. And then back to Seminal, Texas, which is there's my uncle Abe and my aunt Mary, real believers. And there's my uncle Jake and aunt Mary. They uh they just got baptized in the last six, eight months. And that was a result of the crossing over my sister Mary. They came down here and we've went back and testified many times to them. But now it finally came to a point where they when they came to see the people the lives something anchored down in their hearts. So first he got got baptized he said when he left this place something something happened. He couldn't could never be the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So and then three or four months later his wife came to the same revelation. So &gt;&gt; that's what uh just in brief what God is doing down there and the opportunities that I had. I don't want to take any more time. Come here to hear the word and that's what I want to hear tonight. God bless y'all. &gt;&gt; I think we'll have to appoint Brother Jake as the official report giver. I think he did great. Don't you? &gt;&gt; That's a lot to pack in. Uh, all right. Who's ever on the lights? Let's stay with the program. Amen. I'll have you stand and we're going to turn in the scriptures to First John. I'm going to read out of uh 1 John the 1 chapter and we'll start with uh verse one. But just before we do, we'll just once again thank God for the I thank God for what he's doing for the report. &gt;&gt; That's a good report. &gt;&gt; And brother Jake has has reward. Hallelujah. Stars in his crown. I believe that. Dear heavenly father, once again, we're just bowing respectfully, reverently, sincerely, and humbly before you. We know that man can do nothing. We're fully dependent upon you. And we pray, oh God, you'll bless the continued labors of our brother Jake, all of the pastors that are scattered there throughout Mexico where he was. Well, I pray that they'll be strengthened and encouraged, Lord, that they'll be blessed by having access to the message. And we thank you, dear Father, for the laborers, the translators, and all that are working. And just pray you'll bless them, Lord. Bless the congregations, the young people, and all the saints that are there, Lord, and the endeavor to get the message into the Menanite colonies. And now, Father, for us standing here today and all that are streaming, bless the service. I pray the word and I pray that the your words, Lord, will be in my lips and that you'll take control, Lord. I've give you my lips. I give you my tongue. I give you my body, Father. Each one of us are wanting to say the same thing. Here we are, Lord, to be temples of the Holy Ghost. the name of Jesus Christ. Oh spirit of God, have full control and preeminence for your glory and the glory of the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Starting with verse one, John the 1 chapter 1 John. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. And the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us. That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that you also uh have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his son, Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin. Hallelujah. What a wonderful line to close on. You may be seated. I want to just take and uh advance from Sunday morning if I uh can by the help of the Holy Spirit on this uh subject which I began uh what seeest thou. So we'll be on what seeest thou uh part two and uh the um my object object in the in these services and with a thought that God has laid on my heart is that we might change if we need to how we see things, how we look upon things and how we see them. And the objective of that is that we might, my objective is to help you and help this congregation, help all who may hear this service that they might actually see Jesus Christ, the person in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that that's quite a quite a challenge. If we had walked with Jesus, if you had walked with him when he was here on earth, you would have had to look past his humanity, past his weariness, past his uh clothing, past what you knew about his upbringing, his father and his mother as the people perceived it, even though we know Joseph wasn't his father. But we would have to look beyond that. And I can tell you as far for my part, that would have been a greater challenge than to see him in the word today. &gt;&gt; To look past his humanity. &gt;&gt; And if if you don't think that's a challenge, just look at the person next to you. Or if you don't think that's a challenge, go home and look in the mirror &gt;&gt; and try and see this Jesus Christ that I'm speaking about tonight. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to know that you're on the same page with me to look past his garment, past his humanity, past his past his weaknesses, past his hunger, past all of these things. And the scripture says he was tempted in all points &gt;&gt; like we are. So you'd see him in temptation. You might perceive he's being tempted. That didn't change anything. He was the son of the living God in a human vessel. And he was not what we would have perceived him to be. And that is why so many multitudes didn't see him and who he was. &gt;&gt; God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. the sacrifice, the son of God. In the message, Jehovah Gyra, brother Bram speaks about the 70 ordained ministers sitting there. He'd sent them out, 70 of them. He said, "What will you say when you see the Son of Man ascending up into heaven from whence he came?" Now, he never explained it. He said, "What will you say when you see the Son of Man ascend up into heaven from whence he came?" And those preachers said, "This man ascending up into heaven from where he came. Why? We know him. We know his mother. We've seen the stable where he was born. We've seen the cradle. He was rocked dead. We fished with him. We laid on the bank here on the banks with him. And this son of man ascend up from whence he came. He came from Bethlehem. Where's this coming up? Uh that's too much for us. And they walked away from him. And then when Jesus asked uh the disciples and Peter said those great words, he brother Brandham is speaking now. To whom would we go Lord for we are sure that that thou hast the word of life? They had seen it so clearly a vindicated. That's what they saw. The others saw the stable. We fished. We laid on the bank. We know his parents. We know where he lived. We know all of that. And so I I'm I'm putting it this way. Familiarity blinded them. &gt;&gt; And none of us are immune to familiarity. &gt;&gt; We're We get too familiar with one another. We get too familiar with the ministry. We get too familiar with the deacons or the trustees or our husband or our wife. We say, "Wow, it's my husband, my wife." But there's a there's a a a a channel where we must not get just so familiar that we lose respect. &gt;&gt; So, these were the words they used. We know him. We've seen the stable. We've seen the cradle. We fished with him. We've laid on the banks with him. And those very phrases blinded them. &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again? &gt;&gt; The familiarity blinded him. And I can take it from a whole another direction. I'm going to do it. Brother Brandham talks and he talks about many places where it just got too common to the people. &gt;&gt; You could say, well, they were missing it completely. The stable and so on and so forth. Listen, there are some people that they just get wrapped up with Sunset Mountain and with Sabina Canyon and and the other spots and the places and the First Pull and what he did in Edmonton or what he did in Saskatoon or what he did in Phoenix and and and all of those things. Those things by themselves can just blind the individual &gt;&gt; to the Christ who's seeking to reveal himself through that ministry. &gt;&gt; So, you're with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; So familiarity, we know the phrase familiarity breeds contempt. And of course we have an understanding for contempt that it's disdain and so on and such rejection. But contempt also also has the meaning to to dislike or disapproval or disrespect. And I can tell you there are hundreds of thousands out there that disliked what this prophet was saying and disrespected what he said and disrespected him for his office and they didn't they didn't approve of what he was saying and they missed the Christ. &gt;&gt; They didn't see Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? in the message door inside of a door. He said, "You say, Lord, I have watched it, but tonight maybe it's been too common for me. Maybe tonight, Lord, if you'll just open my eyes of understanding and anoint my eyes with spiritual sight, let me, Lord, see your presence tonight and know and understand that I'm living just before the world meets its end." I say here tonight, this Wednesday night, that's exactly what we need to pray. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let this be too common for me. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be that I've heard it and I've heard these quotes. I've heard these statements or we've read it. We've done it before. We've been here so many, many times. I've come here for so many years. But never let it become so common to us that we miss the Christ that's seeking to speak to us and to see us uh to to take us beyond. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The suit of clothes &gt;&gt; or who we are and the little things. &gt;&gt; Let us go. We should go way beyond that. &gt;&gt; It's too hot. It's too cold. It's too this. It's too that. &gt;&gt; It's too long. It's too short. &gt;&gt; It's too loud. It's too quiet. &gt;&gt; Oh, come friends. &gt;&gt; We need to go way beyond that. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; That's what we're If it's If he's not here, we all should pack up. I'll just say a closing prayer and we'll go home. &gt;&gt; But if Christ is here, I want to see him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to ask him, what do you want to do, Lord? &gt;&gt; How can you get receive more glory &gt;&gt; in Christ outside the door? Now, Brother Brennan was speaking to a lot of Pentecostal people at that time. He said, "And that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church, but don't forget, he wasn't he wasn't chastising them for being what they were. He was chastising them for having allowed themselves to drift where they were from from what they did have." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, he's saying, and he said to them, that's what's wrong with you Pentecostal church. So, I want you to listen very close. Don't get hung up on the Pentecostal side cuz we're message believers, but can fall into exactly the same trap. &gt;&gt; He said it's it's seen baptism of the Holy Spirit strike the people. They saw the baptism of the Holy Ghost strike the people. They had seen them changed from street walkers to godly, saintly women. They've seen men come out of drunkards, alcoholics, and make preachers and gentlemen. And it's seen the great powers of God moving and working and signs and wonders until it's become so common till a Pentecostal church will hardly walk across the street to see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; What they saw, there's nothing wrong with what they saw. They saw the Holy Ghost baptizing people. They saw men and women go to the tank and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and walk out of there changed and transformed. I tell you, right here in this building tonight are more miracles than you could write in a big thick volume of books. If we started to name uh if we started to name the places, I can tell you the people sitting in this place, don't let it be too common to you. They've come from the dark pits and holes of hell. &gt;&gt; They've come from being strung out on drugs. &gt;&gt; They've come from prisons. &gt;&gt; They know what it is to rattle the bars of prison doors. They know what it is to be into a drunken stuper and lost. They know what it is to wish death more than life. We know what it is. Many of you young people have grown up in homes that have been protected and sheltered and you haven't experienced that. You want to stand tonight and say, "Thank God I didn't know that." &gt;&gt; But don't let this be too common. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be too common. It's the same Christ &gt;&gt; that did that back there that has done it today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've seen so many come out of these dark pits of hell. The most secure of Satan's prisons have been broken aunder. And God has brought men and women out of there, &gt;&gt; out of mental cases. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Men and women who've been in prison almost to insanity. And God gave us a sane mind once again. &gt;&gt; And you're sitting here today. Don't let it ever be too common. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let breath leave your mouth without being able to say, "Thank God. And if you want to stand, say, "Thank God I'm saved. Thank God I'm delivered. Thank God I saw Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a glorious thing. Don't ever let it become common. We'll never see too much of that. We'll never see too much of that. Receive this thanksgiving, Lord Jesus. We thank you. We give you praise. We give you glory. We can all say we would not be here if it was not for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just thank him for a moment. Let's just give some time. I want to take a little bit of time and say thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come and glorify your name, Lord. Do what would be pleasing in your sight. Oh, we bless your name. We bless your name. &gt;&gt; You've opened prison's doors for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You set your foot upon the neck of the devil. You crushed his head. You broke his power. You broke the chains of sunder. And here we stand bloodwashed. &gt;&gt; Holy. You washed us. You washed our garments. And we stand here holy before you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Give us eyes to see, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us see the true picture. &gt;&gt; Let us see truly Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that's a wonderful few minutes &gt;&gt; that the Lord just allowed us to give him praise. So what brother Brandham is saying to the people, you did see it. &gt;&gt; And what you saw was real. &gt;&gt; What you saw was genuine. &gt;&gt; What you saw was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What you saw was Jesus Christ walking amongst the people. You did see it. But then he said, you saw too much of it. &gt;&gt; You might think, I can never see too much. But surprising when you see it and you see it and you say it, it's just oh, you know, it's not like it's not the excitement of the first time. That's why it's that's why it's a love affair. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says regardless of how long you've been married and your little wife gets white-haired or gayheaded or whatever more or wrinkles and all the rest of it, she's still your sweetheart. &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? He's talking about the spiritual. No matter how long you've walked with him, he's still our our lovely husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And no matter no matter how much he does for us, it must not it must not ever become too common for us, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We say tonight, we'll never see too much. &gt;&gt; We can never see too much of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can never feel your presence too much. I'm speaking that not to you. I'm telling the Lord. You can never bless us too much. &gt;&gt; It'll never be too common to us. You'll never do too much. Just come again and again and again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come amongst us again and again and again. Deliver the bound even tonight. Set them free while I'm preaching, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Let the mighty power of God &gt;&gt; come and do the supernatural healing amongst us. Let your word go and defeat the enemy everywhere. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not preaching. We're talking. We're speaking something that's happening at this moment. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ alive. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ amongst us. Look beyond this suit and see Jesus Christ. Look beyond your own your own self and your own weakness and your own frailties and everything else. Look look beyond the all the negative things and see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is him unveiled in this message. He is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You just praise him. That doesn't scare me or him &gt;&gt; in the unveiling of God. He said they unveiled God plain view. &gt;&gt; He said they should have seen him standing there. &gt;&gt; They should have. &gt;&gt; He was there in plain view. They should have seen him standing there. &gt;&gt; I can say it again today. &gt;&gt; Every time we come into this sanctuary, that's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; This is instruction for you. Every time you come into this sanctuary, you don't look to see what something somebody else is doing or or that. You look for one thing, and that's for him, for Christ. I've come into this sanctuary to see the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and all of his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And see him working &gt;&gt; and it'll never be too common for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember one minister we had here, Brother Isaac. Nora and I've mentioned this before, but I just get so inspired now and I was just telling about the different ones. This one used to be in motorcycle gang and this one used to be this and that one used to be that. And we were talking around the dinner table and he just said, "Brother Biscll," he said, "Have you just had anybody ordinary just kind of come and get saved?" And I I said, "Yeah, of course we we have had, but you know, we just love to see these marvelous things that God has done." I just love to see it when somebody's got their plan and they're oh, they got charge of their life and everything else and God just takes them by the back of the neck and say, "You're going my way. You're doing my thing." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know that he changed your plans. you know that you were set in headstrong one direction and he just took a hold of you and said you're doing my thing you're going my way &gt;&gt; said we'd seen him he said they should have seen him standing there he said yet he was too common he was an ordinary man and they couldn't say it brother was speaking in the unveiling of God because God was being unveiled right before the people he was talking to &gt;&gt; so he was saying it had a double meaning &gt;&gt; they should have seen it back there that should have seen it right now. &gt;&gt; I don't want it to have a double meaning. They should have seen it back there and we want to say I am seeing it right now. Hallelujah. I've seen the mighty God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said they couldn't see it. See, he said there stood a man. Well, they said this guy, what school did he come from? But remember when that spear struck his side, that spirit left him and the temple uh the temple uh the temple of sacrifice blocks turned over and the lightning whipped down through the temple and rent the veil. What was it? There was their god hanging on Calvary and they were too blind to see it. Brought him into open view. God did bring brought him into open view and still they didn't see it. They they're blinded. God veiled in a human being. And that's exactly where he is tonight. &gt;&gt; He's veiled within the bride body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not a diluted Christ. The same Christ. &gt;&gt; Not less in power. The same power. &gt;&gt; Not less in resurrection. The same resurrection. The same glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only thing that the only thing and and we're willing to say not only thy will be done, but we're also uh we are intelligent spiritually enough. We're revelated enough to know that God does things in his timing and in his order and we're walking in that. &gt;&gt; We're walking in that season and we know the season that we're in. We're not ignorant about the season that we're in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said, "Sir, I'm going to ask you a question that my mother, Sunday school teacher or pastor, cannot answer me." And he's talking about a boy with this old fisherman. &gt;&gt; You remember the story? And the and the and they came into a great storm. And the old fisherman overcome by the little boy's question. He said he said, "If God is so great," the boy asked him, "If God is so great, then why can't I see him?" That's a simple question from a child. if he's so great. But it's a good question. &gt;&gt; Why can't I see him? And the old fisherman, overcome by the little boy's question, pulled the orars into the boat and put his arms around the little boy and hugged him to his breast and pulled him up and looked into his face and said, "God, bless your little heart, honey." All I've seen for the past 40 years has been God. He had so much God on the inside, Brother Brandham said, that he could see God on the outside. And he said, "That's what we need. We get so much of God inside, then we can see God on the outside." Hallelujah. And we start failing to see God on the outside. You know, one thing, we got to get more of him on the inside. God, fill me. Fill me. Supercharge me. Fill me to overflowing. And then I can see God everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I spoke about the plum line. God sets a plum line quite frankly. Now, I just want to take you on a little bit of a It's not even taking a left-hand curve. It's just saying this. The plum line is what became too common. the life of Jesus Christ amongst the people that he was revealing whether it was 2,000 years ago or today. That life was the plum line &gt;&gt; and the plum line became too common. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a standard. Well, yeah, okay, you know, but doesn't really mean what it used to mean. No, it still means the same thing. &gt;&gt; The word always means the same thing. So he said in Jehovah Gyra once again he said he said I am people I'm telling you this is uh your Pentecostal people he was a he was uh complimenting them your Pentecostal people but he says your Pentecostal people are seeing so much and have through your life since you become children of God since you have become children of God you've seen so much goodness. We don't want to ever stop seeing goodness. &gt;&gt; You've seen so much mercy. So much of the glory of God. So much goodness. So much of the glory of God. Oh, God have mercy. We don't want to stop seeing that. &gt;&gt; I don't want to stop seeing mercy. I don't want to stop seeing goodness. I don't want to stop seeing the glory of God. But he said, "You've seen so much. It became so common. &gt;&gt; It became too common to you." He said, "It's too common." Listen to this. It makes you lose your faith. Don't ever let that happen to me. I say, "Oh, God." I'm saying this publicly. God, don't ever let that happen that I've seen so much. I've seen so much mercy. I've seen so much goodness. I've seen so much of the glory of God that it becomes just so common and I lose my faith. I say, "God, never let this body of believers &gt;&gt; let that happen. It doesn't need to happen. &gt;&gt; It would be a terrible It would be a terrible deceptive thing of Satan for us to just allow us and say, "You know what? They're having such a glorious time. I'll just sit back and I'll just let them go at it and they'll get weary of it. They'll get tired of it. All these great things will become so common it won't mean anything to them and they'll lose their faith &gt;&gt; and they'll become impotent and stagnant. Amen. when I read out of Amos last Sunday and God said showed him a plum line said Amos what do you say he said it's a plum line it's also in Zechariah if you want to read Zechariah 3 because Lord willing I'm going to speak in Zechariah on Sunday on what seeest thou part three and it's also called a plummet the plum line or a plummet And it's given that you can build a wall to or you can build a building to or you can build and I can tell you can put a plum line up and you put it up and just start building your rocks or your bricks or whatever. Just put the plum line up and just start building. Say, "Okay, now we've had the plum line. We've seen it." And take it down or take one look at it and just carry on building for the next couple weeks. All of you that are builders here, two weeks down the road, even one day down the road, you're a long ways off of that line. How many men know that? &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. A plum line is something you check all the time. &gt;&gt; And if you're a real good mason, every every stone you leave, every stone you put down, I've done it. And I look to that plum line and I take the handle of of maybe the troll or something and just tap that. And you know what you really need? It's good eyesight. &gt;&gt; And you check that out with that plum line. Tap it to that brick or that stone or whatever it is is right in place. And sometimes if you feel a little bit of knocking happening, it's probably God with his trout just tapping you into place. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amos was that plum line. &gt;&gt; So, what do you see, Amos? I see a plum line. God said, I'm going to show you what I'm doing. Says, Amos was the plum line. The word of the word of the Lord was in him, and the word of the Lord was the plum line. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's never been a plum line like the one we've got &gt;&gt; in this day. Never been a plum line like this. So I can say that the word of God in the bride of Jesus Christ is the plum line in this generation. &gt;&gt; The word of God for this day is a plum line for every area of our lives. I just touched on it Sunday and I don't have I don't have time now, but there's a plum line. We got a plum line for our individual life, for our family, for how we uh our conduct, how we how we uh how we have our relationship. Uh there's a plum line for absolutely everything. There's a plum line for the sanctuary, a plum line for the order of the church. There's a plum line for everything. And it's all in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so thankful for that. Now, I've just made a statement here. God, he cast his he cast his line across the face of America in 1956. Brother Brandon was in Chicago and I can hear Matson Boze who I knew very well. and Matson Boz saying yeah because he was a little Swedish brother and he loved brother Brandham very much and he spent a lot of time also in the north in Edmonton and so on had a lot of friends amongst the Norwegian people that's how brother Brandham got up there and brother Brandham is saying in Chicago and the time has come when God has broke the denominational lines and shed forth his holy ghost upon the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran and all and whosoever will have a humble and contrite part. The separating time has come. There's a plum line and you'll meet one side of the line or the other. I just thought that was remarkable. 1956. And he said at 1956, America turned the corner. &gt;&gt; Uh America actually decided on what side of the plum line they were going to be and they chose the other side. I'm glad we're found on the measurement side. Hallelujah. I want to be measured by that word. Look where America is today. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that it it must I I I've just been almost speechless. I have a hard time grasping that the new president, his first his first official interview is on an uh Arab television network. I thought that was incredible. I said to my wife, the only thing he can do more than this is invite and have Osama bin Laden for dinner. Don't laugh. He might do it. &gt;&gt; He's determined to make friends and uh well, it'll be quite an ecumenical movement. Now, we talked about light and I'm not going to get into that right now, but we uh the scripture tells us, and I'm just going to go for a few more minutes. The scripture tells us that we read tonight that the life was manifested. And I want to I want to I want to just go into that and I'll need you to keep your good mental faculties going here for just a few moments because I've got a few things I want to say. But the but the scripture says uh for the life was manifested. I want to there's there's two different uh two different words that are used here for what the apostles saw and how they saw. And we're talking about how we should be looking for Christ. Uh I don't have to emphasize to you. I know that you believe it with all your heart that this word which has been sent to us is none other than the same person who walked here in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only now he is here in word form. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the life was manifested and we have seen it. &gt;&gt; They saw the manifested life and we bear witness." And the word manifested is that so the life was manifested. Now manifest doesn't mean I saw it. But the word manifested says and it it was manifested. So someone initiated which was God. Of course God initiated that this should come forward. And to manifested is to make it visible. So I'm going to kind of kind of be a little demonstrative here for a moment. And the life was manifested. He didn't say God manifested. He just said it was manifested. And that is to make it visible or make it known what has been hidden or unknown. So it's been back here. It's been hidden in the prophecies of the types and the shadows of the Old Testament. But now the season came that it had to be manifested. So God determined this is now going to come forward. &gt;&gt; What's been hidden is going to be made known. &gt;&gt; It's going to be exposed to view. How they see it will be up to them. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to make it. I'm going to expose it. I'm going to unveil it. I'm going to show it. And furthermore, it it means even more than just showing something. But in this case, it means showing himself. &gt;&gt; It means showing oneself. &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to just be a voice on the telephone. I'm going to come to your house and knock on the door and I'm going to be there present with you. I'm going to make myself known to become known and to become plainly recognized and thoroughly understood. I want you to have the message in your mind right now. The whole uh composite message. This is God saying, "I'm going to expose myself. I'm going to make myself known. I'm going to become visible. I'm going to reveal who I am. I'm going to unveil myself. I'm going to manifest myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that I can be recognized and thoroughly understood. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, next time you pick up a message book, I want you to say this is Jesus Christ and he has he he has sent this message to make himself thoroughly understood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the word manifested comes from a second word and I'm not going to bother complicating it by getting into the uh the technical part of it. But it is also for phenaros which is to manifest openly or spread abroad outwardly to be plainly recognized or known. And Jesus answered now it's to spread to spread out openly and outwardly. Listen to the words of Jesus if this doesn't fit it absolutely perfectly. And Jesus answered him, I spoke openly. This is when he was being tried. I spoke openly to the world. I ever taught in the synagogues and in the temple whether the Jews always resort and in secret I have said nothing. This is the one. This was the manifestation. So he's saying the manifestation is saying I've said nothing in secret. I did everything in the temple. I went into the synagogue. I spread out my hands. In other words, we spread out the line. &gt;&gt; We showed openly what it was. &gt;&gt; We made ourselves known. I made myself known so that God was could be thoroughly recognized. &gt;&gt; To leave them without excuse. then manifested comes down to phenoros and then to pheno probably the wrong pronunciation in the Greek but feno is to bring forth into light. Now there comes another element not just to manifest but to bring it forth into light &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and to cause it to shine &gt;&gt; and to shed light. So, not only to bring it forth into light &gt;&gt; and to cause light, but to cause it to shine and to make it bright or respplendant and cause it to meet the eyes and strike the sight to become clear. Now, we've come whole circle. What seeest thou? God manifested himself in this generation for the purpose to cause a light and to cause the light to strike your eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not this eye, but an eye down here. An eye of faith. That was God's purpose in making it manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to put myself forward. I'm coming here in a body of flesh. I'm coming here in a prophet. I'm coming in the last messenger. I'm coming and I will begin to manifest myself with mighty works, signs, and wonders. And it will startle the people. And they'll wonder, "What is this?" They'll think it's like the scripture, which it is. And he'll keep leading them and showing them and then finally begin to speak the word. And oh, somebody will say, "Oh my, it answered my question. Oh, it cast a light inside." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The light struck the seed. &gt;&gt; I can tell you folks, every person here, the light has come. &gt;&gt; The light is here. It's not here so to make me shout. It's not here to make a person feel good. The light came for one purpose, to strike your eye. &gt;&gt; So you can say, "I see it." &gt;&gt; I see it. &gt;&gt; I see it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Did you ever say that? &gt;&gt; I'm sure you did. &gt;&gt; It's like when the darkness dissipated &gt;&gt; and the light overcame the darkness and all you could say is cry out, "I see it. I see it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That, my friend, was a process. &gt;&gt; That was a process in the mind of God. I'm going to bring myself forward. I'm going to bring myself out into the open. I'm going to manifest myself. I'm going to do the same works. I'm going to have the same character, the same humility. People will see my spirit in that prophet. They'll just break down and cry. And they won't know why they're crying. Others will come in the meeting. Even the animals, as Sydney Jackson says, even the dogs didn't fight &gt;&gt; such a presence &gt;&gt; in such an awe. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the manifestation. &gt;&gt; But the purpose of the manifestation is so that the people would look upon it. &gt;&gt; Some just come in. They just come in &gt;&gt; to criticize. And that's they got lots to criticize. criticized the clothing the prophet was dressed in. &gt;&gt; Maybe the car he drove, the people that were around him. Maybe their eyes was on the big offering buckets. Look at the size of those offering buckets. Look at all that money. And that's all they saw. &gt;&gt; Did they ever see Christ? Not for a second. Not for a second. &gt;&gt; But others came in and and and the prophet, the Apostle John said, "He was manifested and we seen it." &gt;&gt; But more than that, we beheld it. We looked upon it. John said, "And that looking is different than when we saw it." When he said we saw it, that was one word. But when he said we it was manifested and we looked upon it, we gazed upon it. We studied it, we absorbed it with a with the very purpose of of of perceiving what was happening. And God in his grace loves that attitude. &gt;&gt; And we saw him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is my message to you tonight. You approach the message in a different way. Every person here, I'm putting you under a mandate to approach the message in a different way. You never pick it up and look at it as a book. Say, "This is a re record, a record of what my Lord Jesus did. I want to see how he did it. I want to see &gt;&gt; I want to come Sunday." God was looking through the eyes of that messenger &gt;&gt; at this generation. So I was interested in seeing brother Brandham talks about a brother he said I was I looked down the street he said and I thought I saw Rabbi Lawson. How many remember him talking about Rabbi Lawson? He said Rabbi Lawson he said he was a little Pentecostal preacher but he never he never really gained any any recognition. He said he had a little flat black hat on the back of his head. He said, and that's why I called him Rabbi, Rabbi Lawson. He said he had great big spectacles, great big round spectacles. He'd been in a car run over by a car and he was stooped over when he came. And so, Brother Brandham talks about his spectacles, talks about his little flat cap, talks about how he walked and his how he was stooped, talks about his cane, and he said he was a good man and he did what he could for God and he preached. He says, "And then I'd see him and he'd start singing that song." Uh, there waits for me a glad tomorrow where gates of pearl swing open wide. and when I've passed this veil of sorrow, I'll dwell upon the other side. &gt;&gt; And he said he would take the cane and hook brother Brandham around the neck and pull him to him and say, "We'll sing. We'll dwell." He included Brother Brandham. He says, "We'll dwell upon the other side someday. My labors will be ended. Oh, someday beyond the reach of mortal kin. Someday God only knows just where or when the wheels of mortal life shall all stand still. He said, "And hook him on the net. And we shall go to dwell on Zion's hill." He said, "He always was in the Bible. and his wife got so tired of it because she wanted him to work so they could have earned a better living and he was always reading his Bible and she got so angry with him reading his Bible all the time that she went and grabbed his Bible and went and threw it in the stove and burned it. said it's a short time later his wife was putting up a Christmas tree with her Christmas lights and something happened and caught fire and burned her up and she died by fire in the very spot where she took her Bible and he said, "Lay not your hand upon God's anointed." And I got thinking, here was two people. Here was a prophet and he looked at him through a set of eyes and here was a wife that actually lived with him every day &gt;&gt; and looked at him with a set of eyes and both of them saw two completely different people. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "God, you know the set of eyes I want." &gt;&gt; Not for Rabbi Lawson, for brother Ed Discoll. I want to be able to look at every person. I want to be able to see beyond your suit and beyond your hair and beyond your weaknesses and beyond your frailty and see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What sayest thou? &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham and and brother Rabbi Lawson. 2,000 years ago, it was Jesus Christ, his disciples that I told you on Sunday morning as I'm closing now. They came to the woman. Jesus was with the woman at the well. And they came and marveled that he was talking to the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he saw the multitudes and they were as sheep scattered. But no one else saw that. The disciples didn't see that. No one else saw that. But today and this day, and I don't want to go any further in my message because I'm going to go there Sunday. This congregation and the believers of this message need desperately the Holy Ghost vision. &gt;&gt; The eyes the eyes that we can see Christ in that message as we've never we need to see him clearly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need to see Christ in one another. &gt;&gt; Friends, listen. The wife of Jesus Christ. The wife of Jesus Christ is here &gt;&gt; on this earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's all kinds of everything else here, but the wife of Jesus Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Just make sure that you see her &gt;&gt; because when you see her, you'll see him. Hallelujah. I'm admonishing you. See her. See Christ in her. See Christ in that message. See Christ. He is there. Make sure you see him. &gt;&gt; Don't miss him. Don't miss him. Multitudes missed him. &gt;&gt; The majority missed him. &gt;&gt; Make sure we're not in the majority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was as a young man, I was certainly I can't even begin to describe to you how intense I was to see what Brother Brandham, what he would notice, how he would act, how he would hold his Bible, how he was going to be out on the hunt in the tent and day to day. And I just watching everything, how he would pray, how he would be at the at our table when we ate, everything. I just watching him and yet I wanted him just to be free and easy. And so there was no pressure and I wasn't, you know, trying to needle him for spiritual things. Just let him have a good time. I just wanted him to be rested and relaxed. Just wanted him to be able to come out of there and say, "It's the best time I had." And I believe he did. I really do. I'm saying that here in this congregation, but I believe I did because after that first time, he came back there every year. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, brother Eddie, he said, when the Lord calls me up, well, Bill Brandham, just what part of the earth are you going to have for the millennium? What would you like for the millennium? He said, I think I'll just have me BC. &gt;&gt; So, you folks across the border, you might want to start immigration right now. But all of you folks living here, I have to tell you, it wasn't Cooper. It wasn't this hell hole. It was way up there where &gt;&gt; it's some rough living, but it was it was God's country. &gt;&gt; And he saw God. He saw God in those mountains. But one day, you know, we' passed a little sign and I'm just going to close and children tell this story for them. So the native Indian people were very very upset that we were there and so they put a little sign up and only one of them could write as I understand there's 17 children they're all grown up and some of them married but most of them not married and the old mother and father and they put a sign up pass this sign means blood. So we looked at that sign, but we're riding our horses. So we look at that sign. Mhm. Okay. I don't know whose blood it's going to mean, but we're going on. So So we pitched our tent, went on for about maybe 20 miles, and pitched our tent, and uh it was it was in the morning, early morning, and I hear that's all I heard. So I crawled on my hands and knees to the tent and when I open the tent flaps I'm just seeing four horse legs and I look up on there and there's an Indian st sitting there straight as a bullet looking right down at me. Wow, maybe that sign did mean something. And another another Indian man right behind him on another horse. So I closed the flaps. I says, "We got company." I'm sure glad I had a prophet in the tent. We need some divine intervention right now. Turned out it was old Mr. McDonald and they were the people that was had 17 children and they came in and he sat down. And they squatted and there were people of very few words. And brother Bud says, "Well, you want something to eat?" Yeah, that'll be fine. Okay. So, they put on some tea, put on some cookies, and they drink their tea. Terrible strong. So, and but the old man had on gunny sacks stitched on his pants from up here all the way down to here. Made on both both legs. and he sat cross-legged like so and uh had a tea and cookies and they said there was another son down at the river so he came up and all three of them sat there and had something to eat and had their tea and then they just it was time to go. So they went outside and got into their onto their saddle into their saddles and on their horse. And uh when they were sitting there, brother Brennham, he he nudges me like that. He says, "See his pants? Do you see his patches? Patches on his pants." So that was the first thing the prophet recognized. That's first thing he looked at was the patches on his pants. And the second thing was when he got outside and he swung up into the saddle, he was just as straight as an arrow. He sat so dignified and gallant in that saddle. Brother Brown nudged me again. He says, "See how he sits in the saddle." I thought, "Here's two great things the prophet recognized. The patches on his pants and how he sat in the saddle." You know what? That was important because it spoke something of the man. And it was that man's wife that was dying from a heart attack. And brother Brandham ran back on horses either that trip or the next trip to pray for her. And she did not die. She was dying from a heart attack. Oh friends, I learned a lot of things by observing because I believed that he was God's prophet &gt;&gt; and I wanted to see things how he saw it. I wanted to notice what he noticed. I wanted to act the way he acted. Not to duplicate him, but I admired that kind of character, that kind of atmosphere, and the way he responded. And I still pray to this day, God, help me to respond the way he responded. The way we see things will cause us to react in a certain way. Our vision will cause us to act a certain way. And so I pray with everything that's in me that God will take this congregation higher &gt;&gt; and that you'll remember this evening. Let's see us though. And you'll go out of here this evening say, "Lord, let me see it the way you see it. &gt;&gt; Let me see it with the eyes of faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand? And I wonder if we can just like sing that song. Open my eyes that I may see. We can sing the first verse and and then we're just going to have prayer.

He doesn't have fellowship with anyone else. &gt;&gt; Just has fellowship with his bre, his wife, his believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Otto, I want you to come.

How he has spoken to so many others and witnessed and testified. And above all things, he's given himself freely, freely. Freely without even thanks or without even looking for anything. He's given himself for freely, Lord Jesus. And your messenger said exactly the same thing. Living for others, we're looking eternity in the face. We're looking heaven directly in the face.
