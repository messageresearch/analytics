Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the church today just like it was in in Eden at the east of the gate there was Cain he made a an altar he built it there and erected in Memorial of Jehovah he wasn't Infidel he made the Altar and in commemoration of Jehovah and put a sacrifice on it and laid himself on the Altar and called out to God God and God refused his calling out because it didn't have the right sound there was nothing that a cow that was dying there was nothing no death to appeasing that sin had to be paid for by death the day you eat thereof that day you die and he put flowers and made it pretty but there was nothing there to say that there was death and from the altar of Abel came The Cry of alarm there was death to pay the penalty blood was being shed Hallelujah and today when God just like it was in that day when he told Ken Ken was discouraged he said here's the best I can do you can take it or leave it do anything you want to about it but that's all I can do about it that's the way the modern Christian worships today I go to church I help the preachers I pay my tiing i h h if they got any a social party I I I put my part on it and if the if they need a missionary offering I I help in it that's good but that's not what God requires he's got to hear the sound of death God what God wants today is you to die die to the things of the world and yourself yes fre Lord take me as I [Music] am but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
