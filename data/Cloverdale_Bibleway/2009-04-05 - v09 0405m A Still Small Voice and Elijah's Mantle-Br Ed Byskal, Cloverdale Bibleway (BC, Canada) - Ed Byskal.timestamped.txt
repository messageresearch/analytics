[16:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's
[16:53] to come and lead us before the throne of
[16:56] grace.
[16:57] Want to pray for brother Edwin Dods.
[17:00] Apparently, he's got a big test
[17:02] tomorrow. The nurses
[17:05] doctors don't think he'll uh it'll show
[17:08] much good results. So, we want to pray
[17:10] that the Lord would just
[17:13] Show the doctor's wrong. Amen.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Our brother Abe Dick
[17:19] is uh requesting prayer for Jamie. Uh
[17:22] the doctor said he should have been dead
[17:24] in the accident and uh he's really
[17:27] banged up and uh just a miracle.
[17:32] Anyways, just brother Abee's asking it
[17:35] would Lord would use this situation for
[17:38] his good to reunite the family and uh
[17:42] Sister Jan Hall from South Carolina is
[17:44] requesting prayer. He's going in for
[17:46] heart surgery. If you've got a need here
[17:47] this morning, if you're listening in on
[17:49] the internet and have a need, amen, you
[17:51] just cry out to him this morning. Amen.
[17:54] We have a God who's able to meet every
[17:56] need. Amen, brother John.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we just want to
[18:02] continue in this worship today. God,
[18:04] what a mighty God we serve. Lord, we're
[18:08] reminded 2,000 years ago, you came
[18:10] walking into the city and they laid down
[18:13] their clothes. They laid down palm
[18:15] branches. They laid down Lord. And here
[18:17] we are 2,000 years later with a
[18:20] revelation of who that was walking into
[18:22] the city. Lord, would you walk into
[18:24] Coverdale Bible Way today, Lord? Lord,
[18:27] would you walk into this atmosphere that
[18:30] we are trying to create of love and of
[18:32] service? And Lord, what would this
[18:34] meeting be if Jesus Christ would come
[18:37] walking into this building, God? I
[18:40] believe every heart where their sin,
[18:42] they could be set free. Every heart that
[18:45] would be shackled, God, that we would
[18:47] hear the chains falling off. every heart
[18:50] that might be sick, Lord, that would
[18:52] just reach out and touch the hem of your
[18:54] garment, by your stripes, they could be
[18:57] healed, Lord, the signs would follow
[19:00] them that believe. There's believers
[19:02] here, God. We're worshiping a risen
[19:05] Savior, Lord, as you were headed to
[19:08] Calvary and headed to the cross, but
[19:11] Lord, we're here celebrating Easter, the
[19:13] resurrection, God. Lord, rise up within
[19:16] your people, Lord, once more. Lord,
[19:19] we've heard about these things over the
[19:21] years. They become more real and more
[19:24] precious to us even as the days have
[19:26] gone by. But we want to see more of it,
[19:29] Lord. More of your wondrous works to
[19:31] show. There's lives that need a touch,
[19:34] Lord. There's lives that need
[19:36] deliverance. Healing is ours, Lord. And
[19:39] we're claiming our loved ones. The
[19:41] Passover lamb, God. The token is being
[19:45] applied. You are our lamb, God. You are
[19:49] everything to us and you have prevailed
[19:52] and wrestled with Satan and you have won
[19:55] the victory. God,
[19:58] we're here to wave our hearts and
[20:00] worship. We're here to open up our
[20:03] mouths, Lord. We're not deaf and we're
[20:06] not dumb. And there's hands and hearts
[20:09] and lives, Lord, that you've set free
[20:12] from the dungeons of hell. You've loosed
[20:15] us, God.
[20:18] We were in bondage in Egypt and the
[20:21] wilderness had our eyes filmed over. But
[20:24] Lord, give us grace to cross Jordan and
[20:28] come into the land that's flowing with
[20:29] milk and honey. May you pour out your
[20:32] spirit on this service today. Even
[20:35] tonight, Lord, may you move this whole
[20:37] day, God. Let there be a strange
[20:40] dealings, Lord, of supernatural
[20:42] workings. That while we hear the word,
[20:45] there would be no unbelief, God, that
[20:48] every heart would be so dedicated, Lord,
[20:51] and so open to you
[20:55] that you could drop down and do the
[20:56] impossible, Lord. Supernatural would be
[21:00] going from heart to heart. There would
[21:02] be streams of light and rays of light,
[21:05] God, going throughout this building.
[21:07] that you would take our pastor in your
[21:09] hands and once more shepherd our souls
[21:13] Lord into your divine presence that Lord
[21:16] there could be a release there could be
[21:18] a worship God as we bow down we kneel
[21:22] down we throw our hearts down before you
[21:24] God you're the same Jesus you're the
[21:28] same yesterday today and forever so
[21:31] hands are lifted up over the building
[21:33] our brothers need you again Lord
[21:37] May you touch our brother Edwin, Father.
[21:39] Whatever is hindering in his body so
[21:42] that you would receive the full glory
[21:44] and praise and your will would be done.
[21:47] May you minister to him today. Thank you
[21:50] for sparing Jaime's life in this
[21:52] accident. I pray you'd restore the
[21:55] family and do something within the
[21:56] homes, God, and this need from South
[21:59] Carolina. God, you know all of us, Lord.
[22:02] We just lift our hand up silently. God,
[22:05] you know our needs. You know our
[22:07] thoughts. Here we are to worship. Here
[22:10] we are to bow down. Here we are to say
[22:14] that you are our only God. May you meet
[22:18] with us today in this place. God,
[22:21] &gt;&gt; bless every part of the meeting. The
[22:23] fellowship hall is full of believers.
[22:26] The nursery is full of mothers. God, out
[22:29] on the internet, Lord. lives. We're
[22:31] connected because we love your
[22:33] appearing. So would you help us, God?
[22:36] Help us this morning to shake off all of
[22:39] our feelings and what someone else might
[22:41] think and what someone else is doing,
[22:44] God, and enter into your presence. That
[22:47] there'd be a total liberty and freedom,
[22:50] God. And when the word is spoken, there
[22:52] would be a divine encounter.
[22:57] Father, you are our victory. Show your
[23:01] victories throughout this service today.
[23:03] Even people that aren't even in the
[23:05] service, but you would go out to them
[23:07] and move on the faith line of believers.
[23:11] And we're waiting on you and we want to
[23:13] see you today. Bless every aspect. God,
[23:16] we surrender to you now. We calm our
[23:19] hearts and we're looking. We're watching
[23:23] and we're listening for the sound of
[23:25] your appearing. Bless your name, God.
[23:30] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. I
[23:32] wonder if we can say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[23:34] Thank you, Lord, for answering our
[23:35] prayers, Lord. Hallelujah. You brought
[23:38] us to this service. You pre-planned this
[23:40] meeting, God. We're here to see you,
[23:43] God. And we know that you're already
[23:45] answering our prayers. What a mighty God
[23:48] you are. Thank you Jesus.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[24:05] We want to welcome all those who are
[24:07] visiting with us today. We trust that
[24:09] and enjoy the presence of God with us,
[24:11] the ministry of the word as our pastor
[24:12] is going to be coming. Did we have a
[24:15] special this morning? The choir sing.
[24:17] Oh, wonderful. That's great.
[24:20] Figured they had something, but I didn't
[24:23] get the message this morning. So,
[24:26] maybe they could come at this time. And
[24:28] uh as they come, why don't we sing
[24:30] together uh number uh 10:58, be
[24:34] magnified,
[24:35] oh Lord. We just we'll just sing the
[24:38] chorus.
[24:40] Be magnified,
[24:43] oh Lord.
[24:46] Lord,
[24:48] you are highly exalted
[24:55] and there is nothing you can do.

[25:44] We magnify
[25:49] Lord. Be magnified.
[26:29] I was in prison,
[26:33] locked up in chains. pains. Sin held me
[26:39] captive
[26:41] to sorrow
[26:43] and pain.
[26:46] Years of frustration
[26:50] as love passed me by.
[26:54] Until
[26:56] the master
[26:58] heard my heart's cry

[27:32] love.

[27:44] I was downhearted.
[27:48] I was broken inside.
[27:52] Praying for mercy
[27:56] with nowhere to hide.
[28:00] There was a solace
[28:04] searching for thee
[28:07] with peace ever flowing
[28:11] and it set my soul free.
[28:15] Oh, it was grace,
[28:19] marvelous
[28:21] grace.

[34:08] So wonderful to be in the atmosphere
[34:11] of worship
[34:13] to hear the choir singing,
[34:18] hear the prayer that's been prayed.
[34:21] We also I don't know was anything said
[34:23] about brother Tim Hoffer this morning.
[34:26] All right. Uh, brother Tim and sister
[34:30] Susan Hoffer, I believe, left this
[34:32] morning
[34:34] uh for North Dakota, Minnesota, wherever
[34:37] on the border there. Brother Tim
[34:39] Hoffer's uh brother has not been heard
[34:42] of uh for a week now. That's last
[34:45] Sunday. That was the last contact. And
[34:49] uh they're right. He had a little farm.
[34:51] He was not on the colony. He was in a a
[34:53] little farm at Acreage. And that acorage
[34:56] is completely surrounded by water. Uh
[35:00] the uh National Guard or the sheriff's
[35:03] department, one or the other, were in
[35:06] there and the water over one bridge was
[35:09] 16t over the bridge and over the other
[35:12] bridge I think was around 6t. He was
[35:15] going to go in and uh uh last Saturday
[35:19] and brother Tim spoke to him. he wanted
[35:23] to come out here and he said that he he
[35:27] said I've got to find God
[35:30] and uh he was really uh really desperate
[35:33] for a number of reasons. Desperation has
[35:36] struck his life. So we don't know just
[35:40] exactly uh what has happened. We don't
[35:42] know whether he has uh perished or in
[35:45] the flood or whether he is on his way
[35:49] out here. Uh but brother Tim and sister
[35:53] Susan, brother Tim especially has some
[35:55] very very grave concerns. So I've been
[35:58] praying for him and for the family and
[36:02] just that uh that this will be resolved.
[36:05] And so I'd like the congregation to join
[36:07] me also in that prayer this morning and
[36:09] and join our brother Tim. Brother Tim
[36:12] Hoffer is not a high-profile person
[36:14] where he's highly visible, but he's a
[36:17] real man of God, a real saint, and we
[36:19] want to be in prayer uh for them uh
[36:23] today. Uh like the scripture says, bear
[36:27] you one another's burdens. So, we're
[36:29] going to do that. We're going to do what
[36:31] the scripture tells us to do.
[36:34] And uh let's just be in prayer for
[36:36] meetings uh tonight. Brother Lance will
[36:39] be speaking in about three weeks from
[36:41] now and I would appreciate very very
[36:43] much your prayers. We'll be having
[36:45] meetings in Switzerland and it's it's
[36:48] rather unique situation and about one
[36:50] month after that there are some meetings
[36:51] in Germany. You may wonder how some of
[36:53] these meetings uh uh happen but I can
[36:56] tell you they're not just meetings
[36:57] meetings. They are uh there's there's a
[37:00] lot of background more background than I
[37:02] can take time to give you now but the
[37:05] meetings in Germany which happen at the
[37:06] end of April 1st end of May 1st of June
[37:10] uh those are there are a series of uh
[37:13] younger men and they're kind of peers
[37:16] uh uh there's uh one pastor that passed
[37:20] away and a a brother has risen up and
[37:23] become pastor of that church. another
[37:25] brother in Germany passed away some time
[37:28] ago and uh uh a a younger man took his
[37:32] place. There's another church and and
[37:35] and these brothers are all peers and
[37:38] they have wonderful fellowship. And then
[37:40] the church also in in Gent where the
[37:43] Iversons are from. They're also very
[37:46] close to these brothers and uh quite a
[37:49] number of years ago there were there
[37:51] were some churches that got together and
[37:54] they wanted to have meetings along the
[37:56] German Dutch border at one place was
[38:00] Verden and then they had an couple of
[38:03] places and for the first six years uh I
[38:06] I I was requested to take those
[38:08] meetings. So one year after another for
[38:10] six years we had meetings. Brother
[38:13] Burkhart and Sister Doris were there and
[38:16] and oh quite a number of uh people from
[38:19] Germany at that time were there and the
[38:21] meetings were blessed of God. We started
[38:23] out I would imagine maybe 200 250 people
[38:26] and we're getting maybe 400 450
[38:30] uh by the time two three four years had
[38:32] gone by and then then these brothers now
[38:36] it's been quite a few years since that
[38:38] happened and they have such a desire to
[38:42] come together again and to have these
[38:45] services because they haven't had any
[38:48] and so they just thought well
[38:50] uh ask if I would come there and and uh
[38:54] whether it's I don't think it's for old
[38:56] times sake but they said we just would
[38:58] like to have those kind of meetings
[38:59] again and so would you please come. So I
[39:02] all I can do is ask you if you would
[39:04] pray because nobody packs these meetings
[39:07] in their suitcase. You know, uh Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't come I didn't come
[39:15] with the suitcase this morning either.
[39:16] You know, we've just got the word of God
[39:18] here and we've been waiting on the Lord
[39:20] and so on and so forth. And if the Holy
[39:22] Spirit doesn't come and take your hearts
[39:25] and your minds and my mind and my mouth
[39:28] and so this whole thing's in vain, we
[39:30] might as well just go out and get a
[39:32] coffee someplace. Uh but it would it
[39:36] would do just as much good for us. But
[39:39] if we're here to hear the word of God
[39:41] and that's what those people desire,
[39:44] and I've been thinking a lot about that
[39:46] this week, you know, it really we hear
[39:48] it often. you know what your expectation
[39:50] is. But I think that expectation I I
[39:54] just thought I might mention this to you
[39:56] before we break the word. But uh uh
[40:00] probably India and Africa are two of the
[40:04] countries that I think of that where the
[40:07] people have such a response to the word
[40:10] of God. And uh I recall vividly being on
[40:15] the platform
[40:17] several times, many times, and I
[40:21] couldn't get off the platform. You're
[40:23] just done preaching, and the the people
[40:25] are so full of expectation and so
[40:29] responsive, not with not emotionally,
[40:32] but so responsive to the word and just
[40:35] hanging on and and believing also in the
[40:38] office of the minister who's who's
[40:39] behind the pulpit. leaving just hanging
[40:43] on to every word and and not being able
[40:45] to leave the platform. You just invaded
[40:49] and completely encircled and people
[40:52] grabbing Brother Lonnie Jenkins was
[40:55] there as well and he would take a
[40:56] service. I take a service and and this
[40:59] one service in particular and the people
[41:01] just grab my hand. mothers and fathers,
[41:04] grab my hand and and and put it on their
[41:07] uh teenagers and pray for them because
[41:10] this is happening or that's happening or
[41:12] they're in school or whatever. Bless
[41:13] them in their in their studies and and
[41:16] one father and mother standing there
[41:18] with also some of the other children of
[41:20] one family grab my hand and put it on
[41:23] their son's head. He was about 12 years
[41:25] old and they said he fell when he was a
[41:28] boy, 3 or four years old. He fell out of
[41:30] a building maybe two or three stories
[41:33] and landed on his head and hasn't spoke
[41:36] since. And they said, "Pray for him."
[41:39] And with that kind of faith, friends,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; with that kind of faith and that kind of
[41:45] response and I I just prayed a prayer
[41:47] amongst all a whole crowd of maybe
[41:49] hundred people on the platform and I I
[41:52] prayed a prayer for that boy and I just
[41:53] said to him, "Say Jesus." He said,
[41:55] "Jesus." He just begin to speak just
[41:57] like that. And I it wasn't me. It wasn't
[42:00] even the prayer. It was their faith in
[42:02] what was in the word of God and the
[42:04] promise. And I just thought, you know,
[42:05] if we could just become more simple, if
[42:08] we could just become more simple and do
[42:10] away with our our pride and our our
[42:14] state formality and give God a chance.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you believe that with me? Just
[42:20] give God a chance. We're not here to
[42:22] have any special, you know, uh special
[42:25] kind of order or special. We want God.
[42:28] We just want God to come on the scene
[42:29] and and do what he would want to do. I
[42:32] want him to be pleased with the meeting.
[42:34] Doesn't matter what we feel, but I want
[42:36] him to be pleased. Amen. So, let's just
[42:39] stand and I'd like to sing. Brother Rod,
[42:41] uh, He came to me and then we're just
[42:43] going to have prayer and go immediately
[42:45] to the word.
[42:50] He came.
[42:55] He came to me
[43:02] when I could not come
[43:06] to where he was.
[43:09] He came to me.
[43:13] Is that your testimony?
[43:16] That's why I died
[43:21] on Calary
[43:28] when I could not come to where he was.
[43:34] He came to me
[43:38] once again all together now. He came to
[43:42] me.
[43:46] He came
[43:48] to me
[43:53] when I could not come to where he was.
[43:59] He came to me.
[44:06] That's why he died
[44:11] on Calary.
[44:17] When I could not come to where he was,
[44:24] he came to me.
[44:30] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[44:34] We're so glad you came to us.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; We couldn't penetrate that veil. We
[44:40] could not come to the unseen, but you
[44:43] came into the visible in the invisible
[44:46] God, almighty God, creator of heavens
[44:49] and earth and all things that are
[44:52] therein. Oh God, God of Israel, God of
[44:55] Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob,
[44:59] you became
[45:01] known and visible to us. We saw your
[45:04] attributes. We see your compassion. We
[45:06] see your mercy. We see all the blessed
[45:10] benefits that have come to us through
[45:13] Jesus Christ. We see your longsuffering
[45:15] and how you were willing to take the
[45:18] penalty of our sin and bear it for us.
[45:22] And then you said invited us to come and
[45:25] lay our burdens at your feet. And here
[45:27] we are today, Lord. We're burdened for
[45:29] brother Tim and Sister Susan Holer and
[45:32] the family of Harold Holer. Lord, not
[45:36] knowing where that man is, but you know
[45:38] exactly what has taken place. And I
[45:40] pray, Father, you'll bring a resolution
[45:42] to this situation,
[45:44] oh God. And I ask that you will go and
[45:48] use our brother Tim mightily. I pray
[45:51] that his testimony and the testimony of
[45:53] others of the Hover family and brother
[45:56] Daryl oh God that is here, brother David
[45:59] and different ones may the words which
[46:01] they have spoken and the testimony that
[46:04] they have given may it anchor in the
[46:06] hearts of the people. Oh God, I pray
[46:10] father that if all of this takes place
[46:12] just for one more soul, it'll be worth
[46:15] it all. I pray father you'll move the
[46:17] community very much. go with them and
[46:20] may the Holy Spirit use them just as a
[46:23] vessel. And while I pray for them, I
[46:25] pray for myself this morning. Lord, I
[46:28] pray that I may just be a vessel, just a
[46:30] tool, oh God, just a mouthpiece to say
[46:33] something that would be a benefit, a
[46:36] strength. Oh God, a deliverance for
[46:38] someone, a healing for someone. Lord, I
[46:42] ask, oh God, above all things, that the
[46:44] spirit of revelation will be upon us,
[46:47] upon all that are listening, oh God, on
[46:49] the internet, I pray you'll bless them,
[46:51] oh father, wherever they might be at
[46:53] this moment. And now, Lord, I just give
[46:56] myself to you and pray, Father, as you
[47:00] receive us, you've heard our worship,
[47:02] and now we come before you humbly,
[47:05] asking your blessings and your anointing
[47:07] upon the word in Jesus Christ's name.
[47:10] Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn
[47:14] in your Bibles, please, to First Kings,
[47:16] the 19th chapter.
[47:22] We're going to begin to read at verse
[47:24] 19,
[47:26] I'm sorry, at the 19th chapter, verse 9.
[47:37] I have a strange
[47:40] title this this morning. I want to speak
[47:44] to you on a still small voice and
[47:47] Elijah's mantle.
[47:49] It's not two subjects, but it's it is
[47:51] one. A still small voice and Elijah's
[47:55] mantle.
[47:57] We're reading,
[48:00] "And he came thither unto a cave."
[48:05] This is Elijah. and lodged there. And
[48:08] behold, the word of the Lord came unto
[48:10] him, and said unto him, What doest thou
[48:12] hear, Elijah? And he said, I've been
[48:15] very jealous for the Lord God of hosts,
[48:17] for the children of Israel have forsaken
[48:20] thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,
[48:23] and slain thy prophets with the sword.
[48:26] And I, even I only am left, and they
[48:29] seek my life to take it away. And he
[48:32] said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount
[48:34] before the Lord. And then behold, the
[48:36] Lord passed by, and a great and strong
[48:39] wind rent the mountains, and break in
[48:42] pieces the rocks before the Lord, but
[48:45] the Lord was not in the wind. And after
[48:48] the wind was an earthquake, but the Lord
[48:50] was not in the earthquake. And after the
[48:52] earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not
[48:55] in the fire. And after the fire, a still
[48:59] small voice. And it was so when Elijah
[49:02] heard it, that he wrapped his face in
[49:05] his mantle, and went out and stood in
[49:08] the entering of the cave. And behold,
[49:10] there came a voice unto him, and said,
[49:13] What do thou hear, Elijah?
[49:16] And he said, "I've been very jealous for
[49:18] the Lord God of hosts, because the
[49:20] children of Israel have forsaken thy
[49:22] covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
[49:25] slain thy prophets with the sword, and
[49:27] I, even I only am left, and they seek my
[49:31] life to take it away." And the Lord said
[49:34] unto him, "Go return on thy way to the
[49:37] wilderness of Damascus. And when thou
[49:40] comest anoint Hezel to be the king over
[49:44] Syria, and Jahu the son of Nimshi shalt
[49:48] thou anoint to be king over Israel? And
[49:51] Elisha the son of Shafat of Abel Mcccla
[49:57] mccala
[49:58] shall thou anoint to be prophet in thy
[50:02] room." And it shall come to pass that
[50:04] him that escapeth the sword of Heziel
[50:06] shall Jahu slay. And him that escapeth
[50:09] the sword of Jahu shall Elisha slay.
[50:14] Yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel.
[50:18] All of the knees which have not bowed
[50:20] unto Baal, and every mouth which hath
[50:23] not kissed him. So he departed then and
[50:27] found Elisha the son of Chafat
[50:30] who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen
[50:33] before him and he with the 12th. And
[50:37] Elijah Elijah passed by him and cast his
[50:41] mantle upon him. And he left the oxen
[50:44] and ran after Elijah and said unto and
[50:47] said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my
[50:49] father and my mother, and then I will
[50:52] follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go
[50:54] back again, for what have I done to
[50:57] thee?"
[50:59] And he returned back from him, and took
[51:02] a yolk of oxen, and slew them, and
[51:04] boiled their flesh with the instruments
[51:07] of the oxen, and gave unto the people,
[51:10] and they did eat. Then he arose, and
[51:13] went after Elijah, and ministered unto
[51:16] him. Amen. God bless the reading of his
[51:19] word. You may be seated.
[51:31] I pray that God will
[51:35] give you put you in the same channel
[51:38] that I've been in and that God will help
[51:40] me to convey the thought. There's
[51:44] uh there's been quite a stir that has
[51:46] been taking place.
[51:49] uh we may say amongst the young people I
[51:51] don't want to emphasize the young people
[51:52] so much but there's been a stir that has
[51:55] been taking place and it is especially
[51:59] wonderful when you do find it amongst
[52:00] the young men and young ladies and
[52:03] you'll know why as I progress in the in
[52:06] the message especially in this day when
[52:09] this day is is uh you know this whole
[52:12] age is really
[52:14] it's it's uh just designed for the youth
[52:19] And young people are into everything. So
[52:22] you young people want to be very very
[52:24] conscious of that which I'm sure that
[52:25] you are but not for the wrong reasons.
[52:29] Uh now Elijah
[52:34] he's the reason he's in this cave just
[52:36] quickly background is because he has uh
[52:39] he slew the false prophets of Baal 400
[52:43] and Jezebel has put uh a sentence on him
[52:47] to kill Elijah and Elijah now has fled
[52:51] for his life and he finds himself in
[52:54] this cave and while he's in his cave you
[52:58] know God's victim says What dost thou
[53:00] here Elijah?
[53:02] And this great strong wind the mountains
[53:05] and broke the rocks in pieces. Uh but
[53:08] the Lord was not in the wind. And uh
[53:11] after the wind was an earthquake and the
[53:13] Lord was not in the earthquake and after
[53:15] the earthquake was a fire. And these
[53:18] were spectacular things and things which
[53:21] would catch a person's attention but God
[53:23] was not in them.
[53:25] And then after the fire was a still
[53:28] small voice. And there was something
[53:30] about the voice that he wrapped himself.
[53:35] He took his mantle and wrapped his face
[53:38] in the mantle and went and it moved him.
[53:42] Uh now the one who spoke in that still
[53:45] small voice, there's there's not a
[53:48] believer that's in existence. I'm
[53:51] talking about a real genuine believer.
[53:53] And I I want to and believe that I'm
[53:57] with you today as a believer. There's
[54:00] not a believer that has not heard the
[54:02] still small voice. It is a it is an
[54:05] inner witness. It's a very subtle thing
[54:10] that takes place, but it's something
[54:12] that every believer has heard. And I
[54:17] would say that many, many believers
[54:20] heard it before they were a believer.
[54:23] the still small voice that began to call
[54:25] them and it it is that inner witness. Uh
[54:29] it it it just begins to say the same
[54:32] thing. It just begins to draw. There's a
[54:34] drawing. And so I spoke about the
[54:36] drawing last Sunday. Now I'm speaking
[54:38] about the yielding to that drawing. And
[54:42] uh and so a at the sound of that voice,
[54:45] there was also a a response from Elijah.
[54:49] And he takes his mantle and it was
[54:52] different. It was different from the uh
[54:54] whirlwind. It was different from the
[54:56] rocks breaking. It was different from
[54:58] the earthquake. It was something that
[55:00] was different from the fire. It just had
[55:02] a different a different aspect to it. It
[55:06] not something he had to imagine. He
[55:07] didn't have to imagine it. It brought an
[55:09] immediate response to him. And he takes
[55:12] his mantle and and wraps his head in his
[55:15] mantle and moves forward to the mouth of
[55:17] the cave because he knew this was
[55:19] different. I I want to say to you that
[55:21] we're we're in a different season.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; We're in a different season. And whether
[55:27] you if you don't re recognize it, then
[55:30] I'm asking that you should ask God to
[55:34] quicken me to quicken my mind to give me
[55:37] a clear sense of what's happening in
[55:39] this hour. Give me a clear understanding
[55:42] of why this message ever come. Why did
[55:46] you send such a vindication? Why did you
[55:49] wait uh these thousands of years to do
[55:52] such a thing? Why has there been such a
[55:54] voice? Why is it so Why is it so uh h a
[55:58] gripping? Maybe not flashy. It's not
[56:01] big. It's not a huge denomination. If
[56:05] we're not elaborate elaborate buildings,
[56:07] not elaborate this or elaborate that.
[56:09] It's not the big things. And brother
[56:11] Brandham takes those things. He said it
[56:13] wasn't in those big things and he
[56:15] relates it to the big things that were
[56:17] happening. maybe huge campaigns and huge
[56:20] big this and fancy that. It's not that.
[56:23] That's not what we're striving for.
[56:25] We're thankful for a comfortable
[56:26] comfortable building, but that is
[56:28] irrelevant to us. We would I wouldn't
[56:30] care if we were in a warehouse or where
[56:32] we were. That's not what we're
[56:34] interested in. We're interested in the
[56:35] God of Elijah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; We're interested in the God that spoke
[56:39] that still small voice. And we could
[56:42] have it out in the field or we could
[56:43] have it out in a tent or we could have
[56:45] it in a warehouse or we could have it in
[56:47] a castle. Whatever it is, we don't care
[56:50] where it is. We just want the God of
[56:52] creation to speak and we want to be
[56:55] ready to respond to it.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; So God is moving Elijah
[57:04] at this time. He's in a transition time.
[57:08] And the transition time is that the
[57:11] ministry which he has is going to pass
[57:13] off to Elisha. And that's the time that
[57:17] he's in right now. And the months prior
[57:21] the months prior to this uh instance or
[57:24] this account, he has prophesied a famine
[57:28] that there will be no rain until I call
[57:32] for it. The prophet of God refers to
[57:34] that many times. He says, notice it was
[57:36] a personal how he uses the personal
[57:39] pronoun. There'll be no there'll be no
[57:41] dew even on the ground till I call for
[57:43] it.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Elijah calls for the people of Israel to
[57:47] come to Mount Carmel. He slays there the
[57:50] prophets of Baal 400. He sends word he
[57:55] to Ahab. He said go to a servant go and
[57:58] tell Ahab to prepare for rain. Now this
[58:01] has been three three and a half years of
[58:06] drought and the country is starving and
[58:09] people are dying and Ahab tells Jezebel
[58:13] all that the Elijah did. The scripture
[58:15] says and Ahab told Jezebel all that
[58:18] Elijah had done and with all how he had
[58:21] slain all the prophets of the sword. And
[58:24] she puts this death sentence on him. And
[58:27] while in the cave, Elijah
[58:30] experiences these various things. The
[58:33] wind, the earthquake, the fire, and the
[58:36] and the Lord was not in those. And then
[58:38] the still small voice. What's amazing to
[58:41] me is that people
[58:43] when they it seems that they choose to
[58:46] remember what they want to remember and
[58:48] they choose to forget what they ignore,
[58:50] what they don't want to remember. Now,
[58:54] when Jezebel heard about all of these
[58:56] things, there's no mention. There's no
[59:00] mention whatsoever that this man who
[59:02] said there'll be no rain has now told
[59:05] Ahab the king, you you flee and tell
[59:08] because there's going to be rain.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And and and there's going to and the
[59:12] Bible says it was a great rain. This
[59:15] wasn't a a little drizzle. A great rain
[59:18] came on. You know, there isn't a word of
[59:21] gratitude. There isn't a word of thanks
[59:23] that that now we have water, we have
[59:27] rain, we have we have we can feed our
[59:29] livestock, we can live once again, we
[59:32] can grow our crops. There's not one word
[59:34] when Jesus referred to this. Now there
[59:37] here's Jezebel and Ahab and they have no
[59:40] regard for it whatsoever. The only thing
[59:42] they remember is a Elijah slew our
[59:47] prophets.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Elijah came against our denominations.
[59:51] Elijah chopped everything down.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing they could
[59:55] remember. They couldn't remember the
[59:57] fact that he said there be no rain till
[59:59] I called for it. And now after three and
[1:00:01] a half years, he says, you know, haste
[1:00:04] because rain's going to come and rain
[1:00:06] and dark clouds begin to form and rain
[1:00:08] came. But they have no consciousness of
[1:00:10] that. It's amazing to me that when
[1:00:12] people today in this day an educated
[1:00:15] supposed to be cultured civilization
[1:00:18] when they start to talk about this
[1:00:19] prophet of God, they want to talk about
[1:00:21] how he was so judgmental, how he came
[1:00:24] against the denominations and all these
[1:00:27] things, how essentially how he slew the
[1:00:29] prophets of Baal. That's what they're
[1:00:31] talking about. But they don't talk about
[1:00:33] what they they they they well they they
[1:00:36] just choose to ignore
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; what God does in the lives of people.
[1:00:42] You hardly ever hear it. That's why we
[1:00:44] have to talk about it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to rejoice in it.
[1:00:47] That's why I'm thankful.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of churches in the uh I'm
[1:00:52] going to be very plain this morning.
[1:00:53] There's a lot of churches in this
[1:00:54] valley, a lot of churches in the Pacific
[1:00:56] Northwest. But I'll tell you, there's
[1:00:58] very, very few of them. Listen to me
[1:01:00] now. very few of them that have all
[1:01:02] their young people sitting around the
[1:01:03] front and eager to hear the word of God
[1:01:05] and 150 plus coming to on on the Friday
[1:01:09] evening at the meetings and the kind of
[1:01:11] comments that I get and the kind of
[1:01:12] emails that I receive very very few I
[1:01:16] say somebody should say thank you Lord
[1:01:17] Jesus
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; some parents ought to be shouting
[1:01:23] hallelujah
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's the God of Elijah.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody's heard a small voice.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody's responded to it.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; This doesn't come by mechanics.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; It comes by dynamics.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And we have been the recipients of some
[1:01:47] dynamics.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Whether you want to believe it or not, I
[1:01:50] choose to accept it. I choose to believe
[1:01:53] it. Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; You can sit back if you wish and find
[1:01:58] fault and pick holes. And I can tell you
[1:02:01] that you'll do that till your till your
[1:02:03] bones are white
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; because it'll always be here with us.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; But I thank God for what I do see.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; I thank God. I see the resurrected Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; amongst his people. Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; So they remember one thing of Jesus, he
[1:02:28] recalled something else.
[1:02:32] And the Bible says,
[1:02:35] "And it was so when Elijah heard it that
[1:02:39] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[1:02:42] went out and stood in the entering of
[1:02:44] the cave. And behold, there was a voice
[1:02:46] unto him that said, "What dost thou
[1:02:49] hear, Elijah?"
[1:02:51] Now, he didn't just hear a still small
[1:02:54] voice, but now he had to he began to
[1:02:59] yield.
[1:03:01] He began to yield. And this is very this
[1:03:03] is a
[1:03:06] uh a difficult subject because how do
[1:03:09] you yield? And what does it really mean
[1:03:11] to yield? And so I I I may not be as
[1:03:14] specific as I wish to be, but as you
[1:03:16] pick it up throughout the service, he
[1:03:20] heard a still small voice. Uh the word
[1:03:24] is he heard a a a a calm voice.
[1:03:28] God doesn't usually work in in an
[1:03:30] agitated way. If you get anxious and all
[1:03:34] uptight and so on, that's not the Holy
[1:03:37] Spirit.
[1:03:39] God works in a
[1:03:41] his voice will bring a calmness.
[1:03:46] It was a small still voice almost like a
[1:03:49] whisper but it was inside
[1:03:52] this voice that he heard. Brother
[1:03:55] Brandham said in the message God's
[1:03:57] preparation
[1:03:59] or an early message in 54 he said uh
[1:04:02] here comes Simeon. He's referring now to
[1:04:05] Simeon, not Elijah, but Simeon led by
[1:04:08] the Holy Spirit
[1:04:10] like you people, he said, that are have
[1:04:13] been led here tonight.
[1:04:15] I thought that was
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; that's astounding.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; What Brother Brandham is doing is taking
[1:04:23] the voice that led Simeon
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; to the Lord Jesus Christ and letting the
[1:04:28] people know that's what led you.
[1:04:31] And I felt inspired to say to you that's
[1:04:34] what has led you.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I can tell you no demon voice brought
[1:04:42] you here.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Nothing from the kingdom of darkness
[1:04:47] brought you here.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; You had to yield to something else. So,
[1:04:52] well, I just did it as a ritual. Maybe
[1:04:54] that's what you think. But there's
[1:04:56] something inside. If I wasn't in the
[1:04:58] house of God, I would be out of place.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be where I ought to be. That
[1:05:06] goes to show that there's a voice.
[1:05:08] There's something within that is
[1:05:10] witnessing to you of that the Holy
[1:05:14] Spirit still has a still small voice. Uh
[1:05:16] it brings a calm. It may be just a
[1:05:19] whisper,
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; but we need to regard it.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want you to do today.
[1:05:26] I want you to regard it. I'm telling you
[1:05:28] as a servant of Christ. That's the voice
[1:05:31] and I'm taking right from a messenger
[1:05:33] and I'm taking from my own experience
[1:05:35] and many of you experienced the same
[1:05:37] thing and you know that voice. You've
[1:05:41] heard and you felt that urging and
[1:05:43] there's a pull to that voice.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; The fire, the earthquake and the wind
[1:05:49] did not urge the prophet to the cave to
[1:05:53] the mouth of the cave. But the still
[1:05:55] small voice did.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, like you people were led
[1:06:01] here tonight, walked down and stopped.
[1:06:04] He said, "I see," and he's speaking of
[1:06:06] Simeon. He said, "I see the messianic
[1:06:09] sign."
[1:06:10] That is him. This is him. Reached right
[1:06:13] over and said, "Lord, let your servant
[1:06:15] depart in peace according to your word.
[1:06:18] Mine eyes have seen the salvation which
[1:06:21] thou hast prepared." In God's
[1:06:23] preparation, he continues on. He says,
[1:06:25] "And I can hear her testify,
[1:06:29] speaking of Anna, just then the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost said, and stand up. He's in the
[1:06:37] temple."
[1:06:40] Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] I can hear the Holy Ghost say, "And
[1:06:45] stand up. He's in the temple."
[1:06:48] Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You think I'm just enthused? Not a bit.
[1:06:52] I can say that he's present here. The
[1:06:56] same voice, the same one
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; trying to get our attention.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; He's not in history and he's not in the
[1:07:04] future. He's here at this very moment.
[1:07:06] He's in this vortex of time. If you can
[1:07:09] believe it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He's in the temple.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Where is he, Lord? She heard that still
[1:07:19] small voice speak in her heart. She
[1:07:22] raised up and here comes that old blind
[1:07:25] woman going right around through the
[1:07:29] people bumping into one and then the
[1:07:31] other one. What's the matter? Led by the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost. The deep calling to the
[1:07:37] deep.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Deep calling to the deep folks is more
[1:07:39] than a song. Amen.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You that are seated here today, you that
[1:07:47] have connected to the internet and you
[1:07:50] took the time and you turned it on and
[1:07:51] you logged in. Y'all want to sit there.
[1:07:55] They stand when we stand here. We want
[1:07:58] to participate in this meeting. That's
[1:08:00] not the result of some habit. That's a
[1:08:03] result of the Holy Spirit. There's a
[1:08:05] still small voice.
[1:08:08] And I want you to regard today, I want
[1:08:10] you to be able to say within your heart,
[1:08:12] I'm here because I heard his voice.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Not 20 years ago or 10 years ago or 5
[1:08:20] years ago or last year. Today,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; I heard his voice
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; and I'm here again that he might confirm
[1:08:28] that is his voice to me.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] and the still small voice of his word.
[1:08:37] He said, "Notice not big noises in the
[1:08:40] message evening messenger."
[1:08:42] He said, "But it didn't attract the
[1:08:44] prophet." The prophet didn't care about
[1:08:46] the big noises, but when he heard the
[1:08:49] still small voice, he knew that that was
[1:08:52] the word.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He veiled his face and came walking out.
[1:08:57] And what I want to bring to your
[1:08:59] attention right away quickly is
[1:09:03] when the prophet heard the still small
[1:09:06] voice and was moved by that and took his
[1:09:10] mantle and wrapped his face and was
[1:09:13] motivated by that still small voice and
[1:09:17] it was correct because that's what's
[1:09:19] written in the word of God. That's what
[1:09:21] he was supposed to do because when he
[1:09:23] moved then God said what doest thou here
[1:09:25] Elijah and then he got the commission
[1:09:27] what to do and he moved out on the basis
[1:09:31] of that voice. It was that same mantle
[1:09:34] and that mantle was nothing more than
[1:09:36] the word of God for the word spoke when
[1:09:39] he was moved and that mantle
[1:09:43] is nothing more than the nothing less
[1:09:44] than the mantle of the word of God. And
[1:09:48] there was a day in your existence, there
[1:09:52] was a day in your experience, listen to
[1:09:54] me close, there was a moment, a time
[1:09:57] when that mantle was cast onto you.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And you felt and you came under the
[1:10:04] impact
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; of that voice.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; It might have been just a word. It might
[1:10:10] have just been a phrase. It might have
[1:10:12] just been something that took place, but
[1:10:15] it pulled you. It drew you out from
[1:10:17] where you were.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; We've all had our cave.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We've all had our place where we fled
[1:10:26] and tried to move and get away from
[1:10:28] things. But God called you out of that.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach folks
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; with God's help. the mantle of Elijah
[1:10:42] and yielding to the pull. And so he
[1:10:46] departed then, and he found Elisha, the
[1:10:49] son of Shafat,
[1:10:51] who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen
[1:10:54] before him, and he with the 12th. He was
[1:10:57] with the last the 12th of the of the
[1:11:00] oxen
[1:11:02] 12 yoke. And Elijah passed by him and
[1:11:06] cast his mantle upon him. This is not a
[1:11:11] uh some act of that is so spectacular
[1:11:15] and unusual.
[1:11:17] A man walks by another man.
[1:11:21] Elisha got up that morning like any
[1:11:23] morning.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He prepared to go to work to the field
[1:11:27] like any day.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; He harnessed up those oxen and got them
[1:11:32] ready to plow like he would at any time.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; This day, this day was no different than
[1:11:38] any other day.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; He was just on his way to do his duty.
[1:11:42] It was just an ordinary day, folks.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; He just got up like you did and had
[1:11:46] breakfast like anytime.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe took his lunch bucket and went to
[1:11:50] work.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; He just went stepped up to his place of
[1:11:53] work, his place of duty, whatever it
[1:11:56] was. But there was a time
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; when God saw that there was a different
[1:12:00] day.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; This was to be a different moment. And
[1:12:03] God came by your way and cast his mantle
[1:12:07] of his word onto your body and you can
[1:12:10] never escape it from that day forward.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Something anchored in your heart.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; It may not have been a very spectacular
[1:12:20] moment.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It may not have been anything with any
[1:12:23] great announcement
[1:12:25] and something came by your way
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and it was this God
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; that I'm speaking of. Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; None other. I'm going to give him all
[1:12:34] the glory. I'm going to give him all the
[1:12:35] credit.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; It was this God. Some of you young
[1:12:39] people just been baptized recently. I
[1:12:40] want you to know that it wasn't anyone
[1:12:43] that convinced you to do that. But this
[1:12:45] God spoke to you. This God came by and
[1:12:49] cast his mantle of this message word
[1:12:52] upon you. And you can never be the same
[1:12:55] from that time. You might even go back.
[1:12:57] People go back and cast it off and go
[1:13:00] into the world. I don't worry about
[1:13:01] them. All I can say is God will never
[1:13:04] take back his dealings.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And there'll be nobody as miserable in
[1:13:08] the world as a miserable believer.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; They can never have peace.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; They can never duplicate what they
[1:13:15] experience in Christ.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now, they're
[1:13:20] miserable.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; They lose sleep.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And I pray God deal with them
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; and grind them down.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:31] Maybe they've been having a good time.
[1:13:33] They've been prospering and now we've
[1:13:34] got an economic meltdown. I say, "Praise
[1:13:37] God for the meltdown. Let it come.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Let it grind these who've walked away
[1:13:43] from God into the ground, into poverty,
[1:13:46] into sickness, into whatever
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; until they call out on the name of God."
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; All these other things are nothing but
[1:13:56] ashes.
[1:13:58] And so he left the oxen and ran after
[1:14:01] Elijah.
[1:14:03] Man, I'm talking about yielding to the
[1:14:05] pull.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I'm struck to preaching and continuing
[1:14:08] on from the drawing. What drew a man
[1:14:12] that got up like any farmer would and
[1:14:15] and got ready to plow and he's plowing
[1:14:18] 12 oxen, 12 yolk of oxen out in front of
[1:14:22] him. I tell you, that's a chore. that
[1:14:25] that that is really a task. And he's in
[1:14:27] the middle of that and a man walks by
[1:14:30] and casts his mantle on him and he runs
[1:14:33] right after him.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Something pulled him.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; I was a different I wasn't just a rag
[1:14:40] that was tossed on him. It was more it
[1:14:43] was what the mantle represented.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; This a reality, folks.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a story. This is a
[1:14:51] reality. I'm bringing it right down to
[1:14:54] you this morning right here. Something
[1:14:56] pulled you
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; to where you are now.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And what pulled you to this point is
[1:15:02] going to pull you on into eternity.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; It's not going to let you go.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel the pull.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I hear the call.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; This is something to be enthused about
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; because this is truth.
[1:15:21] You can find it all through the
[1:15:22] scriptures. And he ran after Elijah. And
[1:15:26] he said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my
[1:15:27] father and my mother, and then I will
[1:15:29] follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go
[1:15:31] back again, for what have I done to
[1:15:33] you?" It's a good thing to answer. It's
[1:15:36] a good thing even for us to ask
[1:15:38] ourselves,
[1:15:40] "What happened to us?
[1:15:43] Why did I Why did I choose to I talked
[1:15:46] to a a brother one time,
[1:15:50] Brother Amy Mulan,
[1:15:53] and he's pastor one, and many of you
[1:15:55] know, he was an old-timer here in the
[1:15:58] church.
[1:16:00] Brother Amy,
[1:16:02] he was a what a lot of people don't
[1:16:03] know, he was a hopeless wretch of an
[1:16:06] alcoholic.
[1:16:08] He could sit in a room and drink himself
[1:16:10] into oblivion. He didn't want to see
[1:16:13] anybody.
[1:16:14] He didn't need any friends.
[1:16:17] He would just get alone by himself and
[1:16:20] get all his liquor around him and just
[1:16:22] drink for a month into absolute
[1:16:25] oblivion.
[1:16:29] And when this came,
[1:16:31] uh, when this mantle was cast on him,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; his mind went to work right away,
[1:16:37] overtime,
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Satan turbocharged his brain. And he
[1:16:43] said, he told me, he said, I could have
[1:16:45] I could have found all kinds of argument
[1:16:47] against it because he was he was taught
[1:16:50] and reared up in the Catholic faith. He
[1:16:53] had left here trying to get uh rid of
[1:16:55] his alcoholic problem. He actually left
[1:16:58] here and went down to Borneo down into
[1:17:02] New Guinea and those areas there and got
[1:17:04] on a missionary ship so that he could
[1:17:07] just give him he just wanted to give
[1:17:08] himself to something religious of a of a
[1:17:11] spiritual order so he could get free
[1:17:13] from this demon of alcohol and it
[1:17:16] wouldn't work. And every time he tried
[1:17:18] to get over it, he just plunge right
[1:17:20] back into it. and through his brother,
[1:17:24] his brother who's a believer today, his
[1:17:26] brother and his brother and his
[1:17:28] sister-in-law go to brother Roger
[1:17:30] Smith's church and his brother I went
[1:17:33] and had a meeting in his brother's home
[1:17:36] and there was they were in a charismatic
[1:17:38] movement at that time and I had the
[1:17:41] first meeting. They'd been listening to
[1:17:42] the Bible believers radio broadcast. I
[1:17:44] got invitation to go over to Vancouver
[1:17:46] Island. There was about 21 22 in the
[1:17:49] room. They were all different faiths.
[1:17:51] And that is that was one time I I I just
[1:17:54] laid out a little bit of a challenge
[1:17:55] casually and I said that I'm sure that
[1:17:58] we all love Jesus.
[1:18:00] I'm sure everybody here loves Jesus.
[1:18:02] They're sitting on the floor sitting
[1:18:03] there, business people, all the rest of
[1:18:04] it. And I started over here with this
[1:18:07] person. I said, I I I don't know. This
[1:18:09] person might be a Salvation Army, but
[1:18:11] I'm sure they love Jesus. And I said,
[1:18:13] this person over here maybe is a
[1:18:14] Baptist. I'm sure they would say they
[1:18:16] love Jesus. This one may be a
[1:18:18] Pentecostal. This one may be a Catholic.
[1:18:20] This one may be a Methodist. And I went
[1:18:22] around the room. I said, "I I don't know
[1:18:24] who's here." I was a total stranger. And
[1:18:27] I said, "I'm sure that you all would say
[1:18:29] I love Jesus." And I said, "But this
[1:18:31] word, the scripture says that Jesus is
[1:18:34] the word." And I just happen to know
[1:18:36] that you all don't believe the same
[1:18:38] word.
[1:18:40] So I said, "I'm just wondering who has
[1:18:42] the real Jesus."
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that was a quiet room.
[1:18:49] You people don't need to be that quiet.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; That was a quiet room.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Anyway, brother Amy's brother and
[1:18:58] sister-in-law came into the knowledge of
[1:19:01] the message and walked right into the
[1:19:02] message from that time. And as a result,
[1:19:05] Amy did. Amy came to me and he said, I
[1:19:09] told my mother what happened. I told her
[1:19:11] that I was delivered from alcohol and
[1:19:13] she said, "Oh, I've heard that before
[1:19:15] and come back and tell me in six
[1:19:16] months." And he was really down in the
[1:19:18] mouth. He said, he said, 'They don't
[1:19:20] believe me.
[1:19:22] They don't believe me. He said, 'What
[1:19:23] should I do? I said, go back in 6
[1:19:25] months.
[1:19:27] In 6 months, he went back. Says, hey,
[1:19:29] mom, it's 6 months. Says, oh, come back
[1:19:32] in a year. So, he came back all
[1:19:34] discouraged. I said, well, go back in a
[1:19:36] year. Well, I can tell you that Amy died
[1:19:38] in the faith.
[1:19:40] Amy died delivered. Hallelujah. And he
[1:19:44] told me, he says, "I could have I could
[1:19:46] have found all kind I could have poked
[1:19:47] all kinds of holes theologically in this
[1:19:50] message." But he said, "I knew one
[1:19:52] thing. This was my last chance.
[1:19:56] Ah, this was my last chance. I I had to
[1:19:59] believe this with all my heart." And it
[1:20:01] worked.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He just believed it. He just received
[1:20:04] it.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You know what it was? It wasn't it
[1:20:08] wasn't thunder and lightning and flash
[1:20:10] of uh you know flashing thunder. It was
[1:20:13] a still small voice inside
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and he believed it and accepted it.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:20:20] it was an unusual thing. Maybe it was an
[1:20:23] unusual moment. You can all go back to
[1:20:25] it. In this in the simplicity of this
[1:20:27] moment, I want you to go back to the
[1:20:30] time that perhaps you might think or
[1:20:33] remember when that mantle, it didn't
[1:20:37] have to be Elijah. It it might have been
[1:20:39] your parents,
[1:20:41] your a workman, associate, your
[1:20:44] neighbor,
[1:20:46] could have been anyone.
[1:20:49] Maybe you grew up in a home.
[1:20:52] I don't know exactly when it was for
[1:20:55] you, but I know when it was for me.
[1:20:59] And you might say, "Oh, uh, you know,
[1:21:01] Brother Bisco, you're so fortunate
[1:21:02] you're able to be with God's prophet."
[1:21:05] And that it was. But I can tell you that
[1:21:08] I had those questions which were
[1:21:11] plaguing me.
[1:21:14] Questions which were tearing me apart
[1:21:16] inside. Questions
[1:21:18] which I I was almost ready to give up
[1:21:22] on.
[1:21:23] And then to know just from about four
[1:21:26] scriptures, four scriptures were
[1:21:28] mentioned. Now it didn't have to be
[1:21:31] brother Brandham but God ordained that
[1:21:32] it was. And that was the day I can say
[1:21:36] here before you. The mantle was cast
[1:21:40] onto myself, the mantle of the word, and
[1:21:43] I could never escape it. And I go back,
[1:21:46] I go back probably hundreds of times. I
[1:21:48] go back to that moment when the word
[1:21:51] anchored and I couldn't escape it. And I
[1:21:55] would urge you, each one, do the same
[1:21:59] thing. There was a moment. Do you know
[1:22:00] why I'm doing that? I want to give honor
[1:22:02] this morning
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; to the still small voice.
[1:22:07] Because that's not my voice. That's not
[1:22:09] your neighbor's voice. It's not your
[1:22:11] parents' voice. It's not a preacher's
[1:22:13] voice. That's his voice.
[1:22:21] Some of the most important junctions of
[1:22:24] our life
[1:22:26] has happened
[1:22:28] and seemed like a non-event at the time.
[1:22:32] Some of the most important junctions in
[1:22:35] your life
[1:22:37] happen so ordinary
[1:22:40] and this may be just a totally ordinary
[1:22:42] service and I want it to be that
[1:22:46] but some of the most important junctions
[1:22:48] and this may be one of the important
[1:22:50] messages in your Christian experience if
[1:22:54] you can just come to
[1:22:56] a certain kind of a realization and a
[1:22:59] certain resolve within your own heart.
[1:23:04] Now,
[1:23:07] Elijah, now I'm just really trying to
[1:23:10] watch my time, but now we're starting a
[1:23:12] little bit of a journey. Elijah takes
[1:23:15] Elisha on a tour.
[1:23:20] And every one of us,
[1:23:22] every one of us have to go on that tour.
[1:23:27] And he started at Gilgal.
[1:23:31] And from Gilgal they went to Bethl.
[1:23:35] And from Bethl they went to Jericho.
[1:23:38] And from Jericho they went to Jordan.
[1:23:43] And I I I I want to say this very
[1:23:45] quickly. Every person individually in
[1:23:48] your individual walk,
[1:23:51] you need to go to those stations.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. and God will lead you to those
[1:23:56] stations.
[1:23:58] And also I want to overlay it that
[1:24:01] actually the message within the message
[1:24:04] itself there's there's a progression
[1:24:07] within the message
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; from the time that it came and it's gone
[1:24:11] on that same tour if I had time to it's
[1:24:14] gone from Gilgal
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; to Bethl
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; to Jericho and to Jordan
[1:24:24] and Jordan is separation.
[1:24:28] And I feel that within the message
[1:24:31] perhaps too many of us are somewhere
[1:24:35] along the road
[1:24:37] but we really need to experience and
[1:24:39] come to the separation.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet declared it and he spoke
[1:24:45] it and I'm going to give you some I'm
[1:24:46] going to give you some examples, some
[1:24:48] quotes.
[1:24:51] Jordan is death.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And God help I don't want to get ahead
[1:24:56] of myself, but death is not easy. Death
[1:24:59] is not pleasant.
[1:25:01] This kind of separation is is not
[1:25:04] something that the flesh revels in. It's
[1:25:07] something the flesh resists. It's
[1:25:08] something the flesh runs away from. But
[1:25:11] I want to take these stations. And then
[1:25:13] he said that then he started from Gilgal
[1:25:16] and this is the message witnesses
[1:25:21] and went on to the school of the
[1:25:23] prophets. And I want you to notice when
[1:25:26] he got up there at the school of the
[1:25:28] prophets, he said, "Lord, the Lord's
[1:25:29] leading me to Jordan." Three stages that
[1:25:32] Elisha followed Elijah. And Elijah was a
[1:25:36] type of Christ, Elijah. And Elisha is
[1:25:39] the type of the church.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Are you the church?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; We we we're in this journey. And he
[1:25:46] says, "I I go to Gilgal first uh uh
[1:25:49] justification by faith and then now uh
[1:25:52] stay here church." Elijah, he says, "And
[1:25:56] the young and the old prophet, a type of
[1:25:59] the church in Christ." And he said, "As
[1:26:02] your soul lives, I'll not stay here, but
[1:26:06] I will I am going with you."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to announce to the word to
[1:26:11] the believers of the word today. This
[1:26:13] word is not a stationary doctrine.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; This word is not a stationary
[1:26:19] revelation.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; It's not something definitive that you
[1:26:22] can ever put in a box say I'm a
[1:26:25] believer. No, it's it's more than that.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; The message is a moving message.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; The message is a it's we're in a
[1:26:34] transition time even right now. And I
[1:26:37] thank God. I want to enter into that
[1:26:39] transition time. I want to enter because
[1:26:41] it's going to be this word that's going
[1:26:43] to take you people from this world to
[1:26:45] another one.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; We must be in this word as it is moving
[1:26:52] a moving word. It's a continuous
[1:26:55] revelation.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And so Gil Gaul, Gilgal is a an
[1:27:04] extremely significant place. Gilgal
[1:27:09] was the first encampment
[1:27:12] of the children of Israel when they
[1:27:15] crossed Jordan into their inheritance.
[1:27:18] The first place in their inheritance was
[1:27:21] Gilgal. And it actually means a like a
[1:27:24] wheel. The the word is in the Hebrew a
[1:27:27] wheel or a rolling a rolling off. And
[1:27:31] the reason why it's so important because
[1:27:33] when they crossed over and uh Jordan
[1:27:36] separated them from the wilderness and
[1:27:38] this was the first encampment as our
[1:27:41] first station, the first sight, the
[1:27:44] first place we settled down in our
[1:27:46] inheritance. Oh, I've been born again.
[1:27:49] I've I've arrived here. No, that's just
[1:27:52] the first sight. That's just the
[1:27:55] beginning. And God was testifying
[1:27:57] because he said, "And the Lord said unto
[1:28:00] Joshua, this day have I rolled away the
[1:28:04] reproach of Egypt from off of you.
[1:28:07] Wherefore the name of the place is
[1:28:09] called Gilgal unto this day. I've rolled
[1:28:13] I've rolled all us all that weight of
[1:28:16] sin off of you. I've separated you from
[1:28:18] this wilderness experience. I've
[1:28:20] separated you even from the mana of the
[1:28:22] past. You're going to eat the old corn
[1:28:24] now. You're going to come back to the
[1:28:26] original. Now,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; you're not going to have to live by that
[1:28:30] murmuring and live by uh, you know, just
[1:28:33] from one day to the other, crying for
[1:28:35] flesh and crying for mana and crying for
[1:28:37] something else. You've got now the
[1:28:39] original word. You've got the spoken
[1:28:41] word, which is the original seed. Can
[1:28:44] this congregation respond to that?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Is that what you're feeding on?
[1:28:51] Hallelujah.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; We can take experiences from the
[1:28:57] wilderness and maybe speak on them, but
[1:28:59] there's one thing for sure. We've come
[1:29:01] not only to Gilgal. We cannot stay there
[1:29:04] at Gilgal. That's only where we start.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And Elijah, Christ is going to take the
[1:29:12] church from Gil. I've got to go on from
[1:29:14] Gil.
[1:29:16] It wasn't only the first place of the
[1:29:18] encampment to to designate we've
[1:29:21] inherited this place. Our feet now are
[1:29:24] starting to claim our inheritance.
[1:29:26] That's wonderful. But that's just the
[1:29:28] beginning.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And it's surprising how many people get
[1:29:31] there and stay at Gilgal.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; We're not staying at Gilgal.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; We're moving on from Gilgal.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Gilgal was also the first place where
[1:29:40] they had the uh the sanctuary.
[1:29:44] it here. Here here's the several things
[1:29:45] about Gilgal. It was the first place of
[1:29:48] the encampment of the children of Israel
[1:29:50] after they crossed the Jordan. And from
[1:29:53] there they launched their conquest. It
[1:29:56] was from Gilgal that they began to move
[1:29:59] out and to and to take over the land and
[1:30:02] they to take over Jericho as well. And
[1:30:05] then it was it was the first place that
[1:30:08] the the angel of the Lord appeared at
[1:30:12] Gilgal.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, if you came into
[1:30:16] your inheritance, you did so with the
[1:30:19] visitation of the angel of the Lord.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; It's the angel of the Lord that brought
[1:30:24] this revelation to us. And the angel of
[1:30:26] the Lord is none other than the spirit
[1:30:28] of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? The very one,
[1:30:36] the very person of the pillar of fire.
[1:30:38] The very one whose presence was there.
[1:30:41] The very one who made people tremble.
[1:30:43] The very one who the prophet said their
[1:30:45] facial features would change when they
[1:30:47] entered into that presence. You're in
[1:30:49] that presence. Say, "Oh God, put me in
[1:30:52] tune. Oh God, get me in the channel. Oh
[1:30:55] God, the God of that still small voice.
[1:30:58] Let me regard it today. Let me respect
[1:31:00] it today. Let me love it today. Let me
[1:31:03] give myself to it. Let me yield to it.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit here.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Don't just say this is another Sunday
[1:31:13] service. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:31:16] command you to yield to that still small
[1:31:18] voice.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I I urge you with everything that's in
[1:31:22] me to regard it, to give it esteem.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your program is. I
[1:31:32] don't care what your thoughts are as a
[1:31:34] servant of Christ. I say, "Lay that
[1:31:36] down.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Lay that all down.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Say, I come here to regard that still
[1:31:42] small voice that has called me and drawn
[1:31:45] me, and that's why I'm sitting in my
[1:31:47] seat.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not here as an accident.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not here just as a series of
[1:31:56] circumstances.
[1:31:57] I'm not here just because I came for a a
[1:31:59] better life or a different answer. No,
[1:32:02] that's not why I'm here. I'm here, oh
[1:32:04] God, because you spoke
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; and I heard a still small voice
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; and I've come out of my cavemen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm sitting here in
[1:32:13] church this morning.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; If this ever reduced just to a church
[1:32:18] service, that's all it'll ever be to
[1:32:20] you.
[1:32:25] It was the first appearance of the angel
[1:32:28] of the captain of the Lord's host.
[1:32:35] Joshua said, "Are you force or are you
[1:32:37] Guinness?
[1:32:40] Who are you?"
[1:32:45] It was the first time that they could
[1:32:47] have a realization.
[1:32:49] I'm in the land.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Take a look around.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; 40 years
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; we've been trying to get in the land
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and here we are.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; How long's this message been on the way?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; It's been for over 40 years.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; But I think there's a group of people
[1:33:10] that's rising up
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; and realizing what God really sent to
[1:33:15] us.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm doing everything within my
[1:33:18] power. everything that I'm yielding
[1:33:20] myself to the Holy Spirit today to
[1:33:22] deliver this word to this waiting
[1:33:24] congregation. That's a still small voice
[1:33:27] is the same one that was in that pillar
[1:33:29] of fire speaking who the prophet spoke
[1:33:32] through.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Was that Elijah?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And what did he cast on this people?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; He cast the word on you.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; He's cast that word on you. Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And you've been touched by it.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Your very presence here today is a
[1:33:55] witness either for you or against you.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Because you're saying by sitting here, I
[1:34:01] have been touched.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I have felt the I have felt the weight
[1:34:05] of that mantle upon me.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm here.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Our feet are standing.
[1:34:18] on holy ground.
[1:34:22] From 1963,
[1:34:24] Brother Brandham began to use the phrase
[1:34:29] the promise of this day.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Now, he may have said it other ways
[1:34:32] prior. I'm just saying, and don't
[1:34:35] misunderstand me, but I'm I'm not trying
[1:34:37] to make an issue. I'm just saying that I
[1:34:40] find it I find these things very
[1:34:42] interesting,
[1:34:43] very significant and very curious and
[1:34:45] I'm raising it to you.
[1:34:51] The promise of this day in the message
[1:34:55] once more, he said,
[1:34:58] "I only want one thing and that's the
[1:35:01] support of Jesus Christ by his word. Let
[1:35:04] him vindicate that I'm telling the
[1:35:06] truth."
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. by his word, not some bogus
[1:35:10] makebelieve, unscrupulal thing, but the
[1:35:14] genuine Holy Spirit himself
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; who takes the promise of this day and
[1:35:19] shows that it's the truth
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; and he has not changed.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I cannot make it happen. He's the one
[1:35:26] who makes it happen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; He, the Holy Spirit, who's the author of
[1:35:31] this word and the revealer of it, takes
[1:35:34] this message and reveals it. not merely
[1:35:36] reveals it but causes it and causes it
[1:35:39] to be vindicated as the truth
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and have still
[1:35:46] remain bound perhaps from a wandering in
[1:35:49] the wilderness, I can say to you, this
[1:35:51] is your opportunity to cross Jordan.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; This is your opportunity to be separated
[1:35:56] from that.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; In anointed ones of the end time, he
[1:36:02] also said, "You are a separated people."
[1:36:05] May I hear?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Holy unto the Lord.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Dedicated to the word.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God to bear fruit of
[1:36:19] this promise of his promise of this day
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; you're here.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; That's why God brought you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; That's why God has done what he has
[1:36:27] done. So that you might bring forth the
[1:36:30] fruit of the promise of the word of the
[1:36:32] promise for this day.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; That's why a denominational seed can
[1:36:38] never make it work.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't bring something in
[1:36:42] from, well, I was taught this back in
[1:36:44] the Lutheran or back in the Methodist or
[1:36:46] back in the Pentecost. That won't work.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; That's another seed.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just give another
[1:36:54] very important aspect of yielding. In
[1:36:57] the Bible,
[1:36:59] to yield is not merely, in fact, in the
[1:37:02] Old Testament, to yield was the yield.
[1:37:08] Your your crops shall yield,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; your vineyards shall yield,
[1:37:14] the yield of the field,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; it was the the what was produced,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; right? What was the final conclusion?
[1:37:27] You will plant your crops, but it will
[1:37:29] yield. And if you'll follow me, it will
[1:37:30] yield.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That same we have well I want to yield
[1:37:36] to the spirit of God. Yield to the still
[1:37:39] small voice. Yield which means to move
[1:37:42] in that direction.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Not to be forced and pushed and beat
[1:37:46] into that direction. I don't believe in
[1:37:48] that. It's to yield.
[1:37:50] I give myself to it.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And in giving yourself, you cannot give
[1:37:55] yourself without forsaking something
[1:37:58] else.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I have to forsake and that happens to be
[1:38:01] Jordan.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I'm forsaking my own thoughts.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I'm forsaking my own aspirations and
[1:38:08] opinions and my uh my ambitions. I'm
[1:38:12] forsaking that. Oh God, what is your
[1:38:14] will? I would like to do this or I would
[1:38:17] like to be that. But what is your will?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And I yield myself to it. That's one
[1:38:24] form of yielding. But as you do that,
[1:38:27] you fulfill also the Old Testament part
[1:38:30] of yielding is that as you yield to his
[1:38:33] voice and yield to his spirit and that
[1:38:36] and the spirit of Christ begins to flow
[1:38:39] through you and manifest himself through
[1:38:41] you. What comes out of your life, your
[1:38:44] life, you're a tree yourself and you're
[1:38:46] yielding the fruit,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; the result
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; of this word for this hour.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; See friends,
[1:39:03] if we come into this message and we
[1:39:04] happen to have in brother Brandham's
[1:39:06] language, we have a temper like a
[1:39:07] buzzsaw.
[1:39:11] And years later, we still have a temper
[1:39:13] like a buzzsaw
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; that has not yielded
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; the fruit of the life
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; We still have our old canankerous
[1:39:25] nature, our old whatever more. No, it's
[1:39:29] the spirit of Jesus Christ. How I
[1:39:32] hunger, how I long for that spirit.
[1:39:36] You might say, you know, Brother Ed, I
[1:39:40] I'm I'm thinking of certain things right
[1:39:42] now. Well, I would encourage you just
[1:39:44] listen to that still small voice.
[1:39:47] What is he saying?
[1:39:49] And he's inviting you to come to the
[1:39:50] front of that cave. Come out of this
[1:39:53] dark spell. Come out of this dark
[1:39:55] moment. Don't live there any longer.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to run from anybody any
[1:40:00] longer.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:40:08] You're a separated people to bring forth
[1:40:11] the fruit to bear the fruit of his
[1:40:13] promise of this day.
[1:40:16] Brother Brandham talks about him being
[1:40:20] the rose of Sharon.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And he said that the priest needed to be
[1:40:25] anointed
[1:40:27] with the oil and the fragrance.
[1:40:32] And he said the fragrance of the rose of
[1:40:34] Sharon. He said that's why he had to be
[1:40:37] crushed.
[1:40:39] He was crushed. He was crushed at
[1:40:41] Calvary.
[1:40:44] Not merely to give us not only to give
[1:40:46] us salvation but to give us a different
[1:40:49] life
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; that we would actually have a perfume
[1:40:55] in this world.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Have a fragrance. What a wonderful life
[1:40:59] it is. the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And then quickly they would go from
[1:41:08] Gil Gal. Are you traveling with me?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; They would go to Bethl. And the Bethl
[1:41:16] is the house of God.
[1:41:19] Bethl is where Abraham first built an
[1:41:22] altar and sacrificed.
[1:41:25] Bethl is where Jacob dreamed a dream.
[1:41:28] And at Bethl he saw angels
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; descending and ascending from above. And
[1:41:36] then from from Bethl they would go to
[1:41:40] Jericho. And Jericho was the first city
[1:41:43] of conqu that was conquered.
[1:41:46] Jericho was where Rahab lived on the
[1:41:49] walls.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that we have a message
[1:41:53] that that unveils to us Rahab's part.
[1:41:58] Rahab, this harlot woman who who
[1:42:02] believed and put the token where it was
[1:42:04] supposed to be
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; and we could say so much about her but
[1:42:08] we I just want to say that she believed
[1:42:10] for her whole family. She lived in the
[1:42:13] most dangerous of places but in it is
[1:42:16] this message that reveals that woman's
[1:42:18] part in actually
[1:42:21] Joshua was conquering the rest of the
[1:42:23] land because she hid the spies. That was
[1:42:26] the great thing. She hid the spies. And
[1:42:28] that keeps being referred to that she
[1:42:30] hid the spies. And because she hid the
[1:42:33] spies, she was taken into the whole
[1:42:36] economy of God and became one of the
[1:42:38] mothers of Jesus Christ. Oh.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, what an honor. You say,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; could that be?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Not only could it be, it was.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; That is exactly what happened.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing spectacular about
[1:42:53] her life. What is it that a couple men
[1:42:56] come and then you finally hide them and
[1:42:58] and even deceive uh the king and the
[1:43:01] messengers that came from the king and
[1:43:03] so on so forth. She was so determined on
[1:43:05] protecting them.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You know what she was doing? She was
[1:43:08] protecting the message.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And I hope this congregation is as
[1:43:13] committed as I am to protect this
[1:43:15] message.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; It has every kind of enemy, every kind
[1:43:19] of subtle device. And I'm determined
[1:43:22] within with the power of God to protect
[1:43:25] the word of God
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; and to hold it high and to hold a
[1:43:28] standard high. And that that it's
[1:43:31] incumbent upon us. It's part of our
[1:43:33] responsibility to hold it high.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hold it above reproach.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Jericho,
[1:43:46] a great victory.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And we've had great victories. And I'm
[1:43:51] sure that you that are sitting here, you
[1:43:53] can point to some place in your back in
[1:43:57] your past and you can identify and say,
[1:44:00] "Brother Biscoll, I'd been there. I'd
[1:44:03] been to Jericho. Oh, how wonderful
[1:44:06] to have my victory at Jericho. Maybe
[1:44:09] your first conquest when you came into
[1:44:11] the land.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; But we can't stay there.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You can't stay there at Jericho. We must
[1:44:19] move on.
[1:44:21] from our earlier victories.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Now we come to the last station and it's
[1:44:28] Jordan
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and it's not a pleasant uh it's not
[1:44:33] something that the flesh wants to get
[1:44:34] enthused or excited about because
[1:44:36] brother Brandham always identifies it as
[1:44:38] death. Not death in the flesh a death to
[1:44:42] the world. in Elijah and Elisha.
[1:44:46] He says, "Now the third stage is coming
[1:44:48] on." Now you might say, "Well, there was
[1:44:51] Gilgal, Bethl, Jericho, and Jordan as
[1:44:54] four." But remember, they were already
[1:44:57] at Gil Gaul. So they moved from Gil Gaul
[1:45:00] to the others. And uh and so now he says
[1:45:04] the third stage is coming on, but the
[1:45:06] church still just in case that leaves a
[1:45:08] question in your mind from where you
[1:45:11] went, brother Bam talks about
[1:45:13] justification. And he said he'll call
[1:45:14] justification. So we go justification,
[1:45:17] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:45:20] Holy Ghost. And he talks about the three
[1:45:21] stages. But then in other message he
[1:45:25] says and then he said there is the Holy
[1:45:28] Ghost himself.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; He said justification. This is how he
[1:45:32] said it. And just hold it.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what you think. This is
[1:45:36] what he said.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Justification made room for
[1:45:40] sanctification.
[1:45:42] Sanctification made room for the baptism
[1:45:45] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:45:49] room for the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Do I need to repeat that?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Surely not. And the Holy Ghost and the
[1:46:00] baptism because the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:02] Ghost is a gift.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost himself is a person.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That is him.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; That is the very life of Christ himself.
[1:46:10] So the baptism of the Holy Spirit, yeah,
[1:46:13] we need that. Everybody needs that. But
[1:46:15] it makes way for the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said in Elisha and Elijah
[1:46:29] just another few minutes. He says, "Now
[1:46:31] the third stage is coming on, but the
[1:46:33] church still follows on. Elisha
[1:46:35] following Elijah. And when he said gets
[1:46:38] down to the Jordan, Jordan is a meaning
[1:46:41] of separation or death. You've heard
[1:46:43] many times when I come down to the Chile
[1:46:45] Jordan, Jordan was death. The Lutheran
[1:46:48] age followed by and so did the Methodist
[1:46:50] age. But we come to another age now, the
[1:46:53] age of dying out.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; He said all your worldly pleasures.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; God has got to do something with you in
[1:47:00] order for you for he could before he
[1:47:03] could give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to die out. Get dead. You
[1:47:08] don't die out. He said, you remember
[1:47:11] life can only come out of death.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Life can only come out of death. A seed
[1:47:17] can only die. Anything else can only
[1:47:20] die. And out of death comes life. Out of
[1:47:23] the death of Christ comes the
[1:47:24] resurrection of life.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; The only way that you can tonight become
[1:47:29] alive of faith in God is to die out to
[1:47:32] yourself and symptoms. everything around
[1:47:35] you. We need to be acknowledging that.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Die out to symptoms. Die out to
[1:47:41] everything around you and become alive.
[1:47:44] Die out. Die out to symptoms. Die out to
[1:47:46] the circumstances. Oh, this
[1:47:49] congregation, we need to die out to the
[1:47:52] circumstances.
[1:47:53] We need to die out to the symptoms. If
[1:47:56] you're here and you're sick, you need to
[1:47:57] die out to the symptoms. But I'm talking
[1:47:59] about even greater symptoms and
[1:48:01] circumstances and die out to everything
[1:48:04] else and become alive in Christ. Can't
[1:48:07] say just die out and become alive. We
[1:48:08] need to die identify those things. I
[1:48:11] need to die out with those things that
[1:48:13] are troubling me and separate myself and
[1:48:16] yield to God. Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how much time is spent of
[1:48:21] our mind and our brain cells is taken up
[1:48:24] with life with life that's passing. And
[1:48:27] we need to uh I I believe we need to
[1:48:29] turn. I would urge you to yield
[1:48:31] yourself. I don't care where you are.
[1:48:34] You're getting dressed in the morning.
[1:48:35] Have your mind upon God. What's wrong
[1:48:37] with that? Not worried about the day.
[1:48:40] Not worried about, you know, what what's
[1:48:42] going to take place the rest of the
[1:48:43] time. not worried about, you know, maybe
[1:48:46] your studies or your work or your
[1:48:47] schedule. We all have that and it will
[1:48:50] always, friends, hear me. It'll always
[1:48:53] be the same.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; It'll never change.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; The devil is not going to change Satan's
[1:49:00] Eden to make it easier for you to be
[1:49:03] spiritual.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You have to take it and the violent take
[1:49:07] it by force.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; It will take effort.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; It will take resolve. It will take
[1:49:14] mental fortitude.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I am going to think on spiritual things.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to think on heavenly things.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to spend as much of my energy
[1:49:26] as I possibly can for the kingdom of
[1:49:28] God.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Die out to self and become alive in
[1:49:36] Christ. And the message paradox. He
[1:49:38] said, "Now you see, you see what coming
[1:49:40] down to the Jordan meant." He said,
[1:49:43] "We're down here now."
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; We're down here now.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; This is amazing to me because this is
[1:49:52] 1961.
[1:49:54] Brother Brandham has just he's had the
[1:49:56] experience in the first part of 61 of
[1:49:58] going beyond the curtain time. This is
[1:50:00] just prior to within a very few months.
[1:50:04] He's going to have s is this the time
[1:50:07] the vision of the seven angels coming.
[1:50:10] Three months later, the seals are going
[1:50:12] to be open. And now this is right in
[1:50:14] this vortex, right in this junction. As
[1:50:17] Elijah was in a junction, this Elijah
[1:50:19] was in a junction at that time. And
[1:50:22] we're with him.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; We're part of it.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; We're listening to it. We're heing it.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; What did you say, Elijah?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; What did you say?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You've cast your mantle on me. Where are
[1:50:32] we?
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe somebody says, "I just
[1:50:37] been baptized." All right. And you're on
[1:50:39] your journey. Someone else been here 10,
[1:50:41] 20 years. You're on your journey. But we
[1:50:44] cannot stay. We cannot stay uh uh just
[1:50:47] at Gilgal. We can't stay just at Bethl.
[1:50:50] Oh, this is a wonderful place. We're
[1:50:52] offering sacrifices here. I'm just
[1:50:53] living this kind of life. We can't stay
[1:50:55] there. We can't go on. We can't just
[1:50:57] stay, I've had such wonderful victories.
[1:51:00] I remember when God did this at Jericho,
[1:51:02] etc., etc. We can't stay there. We got
[1:51:05] to move on to Jordan. We got to feel
[1:51:07] those chilly waters on our feet.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; We got to cross over.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Knowing that the real
[1:51:14] inheritance is on the other side.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; We must not say within ourselves, well,
[1:51:22] I we've got it all here or I've been
[1:51:24] here and I've had this and I've enjoyed
[1:51:26] this for all these years. We need still
[1:51:28] to move on because we haven't got
[1:51:30] everything that we need.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; We haven't got everything that we want.
[1:51:35] Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Listening to brother Lance's last
[1:51:38] service and and a cry of his heart and
[1:51:40] soul, I could just feel the impulse that
[1:51:43] was gripping him. We don't want a God of
[1:51:46] word only. We want a God of of dynamics.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; It's not enough for me to talk about a
[1:51:53] boy in India that fell on his head and
[1:51:55] lost his speech and was healed instantly
[1:51:57] and began to say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
[1:52:00] Clear as I'm saying it,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; that's that's God. But I can't live back
[1:52:04] at that conquest.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; We've got We've got walls right now that
[1:52:09] need to go down.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; We have walls now that need to go down.
[1:52:17] We've got things we've built around
[1:52:19] oursel, maybe complexes we've got around
[1:52:21] ourselves and they need to go down. You
[1:52:23] need to have a current victory.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the middle of this
[1:52:28] victory.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:36] just quickly.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's cross over now. We're
[1:52:43] down here now."
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; And I know that he was saying this 1961,
[1:52:48] over 45 years ago, but that's just as
[1:52:50] current as it can be as it was in last
[1:52:52] night's newspaper. It's more current
[1:52:55] than that. And maybe somebody right here
[1:52:57] is here at this moment.
[1:53:00] We're down here now. Let's cross over
[1:53:02] now. Let's quit playing. Let's cross the
[1:53:05] other side cuz it's because it it all
[1:53:08] belongs to us.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It's all ours.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Them visions has never failed.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; They can't fail because they come from
[1:53:17] God. And I believe it with all that is
[1:53:19] within me. We're not a hirling.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a hirling. He wasn't saying
[1:53:24] these things to make us feel good. He
[1:53:26] was saying it because it was God's word.
[1:53:28] Thus sayith the Lord to this generation.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; I take it
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; I take it as though he was speaking to
[1:53:36] Cloverdale Bible way. And even if he was
[1:53:38] speaking just to us alone, that's all my
[1:53:41] concern is. He these things have been
[1:53:43] spoken for you and I.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm very very determined
[1:53:47] with this word this morning, friends.
[1:53:48] I'm very specific. I'm very zeroed in.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; I'm coming right to your address and
[1:53:54] mine as well. Hallelujah.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And he said we'll cross Jordan is what
[1:54:02] he said. I'm not a hireling to run back
[1:54:05] into the wilderness.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; He's not taking us back into the
[1:54:08] wilderness.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; He's not taking us to the Old Testament
[1:54:11] law, the Old Testament tabernacle and
[1:54:13] the in the mana in the Old Testament
[1:54:15] into the water from the rock. That was
[1:54:17] water for that season.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; We're going into the promised land.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; We've got wells of water that they knew
[1:54:26] nothing about back there.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'll cross Jordan the
[1:54:30] separation."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; God, break to us the seals.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Hear what's he's crying out in his
[1:54:35] heart.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; That's what he was crying.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; God, break to us these seals.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And it was going to happen in just a few
[1:54:47] months.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Did God hear that, Elijah?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; He heard him.
[1:54:53] And I am here today pacing over this po
[1:54:55] over this platform saying thank God
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; that he not only heard it and God did it
[1:55:01] but he cast that mantle over our
[1:55:03] shoulders. Hallelujah.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And we felt the we felt the impact of
[1:55:09] the word the mantle of the word and
[1:55:13] nothing can satisfy us anymore.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] Glory to God.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Yield to that still small voice.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Say yes to him.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "And break to us the seals
[1:55:39] that's on the back of the book."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; And let us enter into this great place
[1:55:43] now.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; For Joshua divided to the people their
[1:55:46] inheritance that God had left for them.
[1:55:50] Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; To yield. I think of what uh what George
[1:55:58] Mueller said. How many know George
[1:56:01] Mueller's name? Let's see your hands.
[1:56:04] Good.
[1:56:06] I won't describe who he was, but he was
[1:56:08] a great man of God in his time.
[1:56:11] He says, "And he he was asked once the
[1:56:13] secret of his service to God."
[1:56:17] George Mueller said, "There was a day
[1:56:20] when I died. Utterly died."
[1:56:25] And as he spoke, he bent over lower and
[1:56:28] lower, lower until he almost touched the
[1:56:30] floor.
[1:56:33] Died to George Mueller.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; His opinions, he said,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; "His preferences,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; his tastes
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; and his will
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; died to the world. its approval
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; or its censure
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; died to the approval of of or blame even
[1:56:53] of my brethren and friends. And since
[1:56:56] then I've studied only to show myself
[1:57:00] approved unto God.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't need the approval
[1:57:04] of the world. And we don't care about
[1:57:06] the censure of the world.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're trapped in the
[1:57:10] censure of the world that will censure
[1:57:12] this message. We don't we're not
[1:57:14] interested in it.
[1:57:20] He also said we must consider times and
[1:57:24] seasons. And he used to say, George
[1:57:26] Mueller used to say,
[1:57:32] is this the Lord's work?
[1:57:34] Then is this the Lord's way? And last
[1:57:38] and not least, is this the Lord's time?
[1:57:43] I can tell you that this is the Lord's
[1:57:44] time.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; This message has been allotted to this
[1:57:50] time.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; You will never find anything so current
[1:57:53] as this message. You may have come here
[1:57:55] for years and heard it, but this this
[1:57:57] Sunday is not the same as last Sunday.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; This word is a moving word.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And if you stayed where we were last
[1:58:04] Sunday, you're not going to be where the
[1:58:05] word is this Sunday. You need to say,
[1:58:08] "Well, how can I assure myself stay in a
[1:58:11] in a yielded state?
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to you.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; He's talking to you
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; deep down. He's talking to you. If
[1:58:24] you'll just if you'll just pull the
[1:58:26] shades back, you'll you'll hear that
[1:58:28] voice,
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; that little resentment that came up.
[1:58:34] Don't yield to it. Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Seeking approval of people or seeking
[1:58:44] approval of the world, don't yield to
[1:58:46] that. Yield to God. Yield to Christ.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; I want to move on forward.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; If it's a battle, praise God, there'll
[1:58:58] be a victory.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stand there and whimper.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:08] I want to look at it.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; To yield is to move or to bend under
[1:59:12] pressure or when the force is applied to
[1:59:16] stop opposing or resisting and agree to
[1:59:20] somebody's demands or respects. I I I I
[1:59:24] agree with the demands of the word of
[1:59:27] God. Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to close just a few
[1:59:35] minutes, but I'm very, very touched and
[1:59:37] I feel that I would do an injustice to
[1:59:39] the Holy Spirit if I didn't bring this
[1:59:41] last part.
[1:59:43] And this part has to do I've been in
[1:59:45] this message,
[1:59:47] this message right here, God called Man,
[1:59:51] and I have felt
[1:59:53] very
[1:59:55] affected.
[1:59:57] Not because I have had a
[2:00:00] uh such a close contact with all of the
[2:00:02] young people, but I have much closer
[2:00:05] contact than perhaps many know.
[2:00:08] And I speak to them, pray with them. And
[2:00:12] brother Brandon talks about a God called
[2:00:13] men and he said, and he speaks about
[2:00:16] Goded men.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Men who have felt the mantle of the word
[2:00:23] of God.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] and women too, girls too, ladies too.
[2:00:29] But we have felt the mantle of the word
[2:00:31] of God. But he said he's he talked about
[2:00:34] a God God
[2:00:37] trained man. Not a man trained man.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Not a selfmade man.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Not a father and mother trained man.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Not a preacher, not a Bible way trained
[2:00:52] man, but a Godtraed man. And the only
[2:00:56] way we can have a God-trained man is to
[2:00:58] have that man hear the voice of God.
[2:01:00] Hear the still small voice and yield to
[2:01:03] that voice.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And he speaks of this man. He said he
[2:01:08] had done had a taste of heaven in his
[2:01:10] soul. These are just isolated
[2:01:12] statements.
[2:01:17] Have you had that even once?
[2:01:23] Do you remember
[2:01:27] you had a taste of heaven
[2:01:31] in my soul?
[2:01:35] He said he'd already felt the power of
[2:01:37] God.
[2:01:40] He knew there was more for him.
[2:01:51] He says, "Oh you sons of God, move out
[2:01:53] into that sphere yonder." And when I was
[2:01:56] reading that, I was taking it
[2:01:58] personally. I just said, "Oh God,
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; channel me into that sphere out yonder."
[2:02:05] It might just be a breath away, but
[2:02:07] channel me into that sphere. I'm telling
[2:02:10] you as a precious precious people here
[2:02:13] that have come to to this service this
[2:02:15] morning. You could have been doing other
[2:02:17] things but a still small voice called
[2:02:19] you and you have tasted
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; of heaven in your soul. You have tasted
[2:02:27] of God. And it doesn't matter how long
[2:02:30] ago that was. That's one thing you can
[2:02:32] never get get away from.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; You can just sense how you savored it.
[2:02:38] Amen.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, sons of God, move out
[2:02:42] into that sphere yonder, fearless,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; fearless. Take God at his word."
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I just can't tell you how,
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; how that has affected me
[2:03:00] and how inadequate
[2:03:03] I feel
[2:03:05] when I read that. And I'll tell you why.
[2:03:07] Because the prophet of God, he moves
[2:03:09] right on. He gives us the example. He
[2:03:11] moves right on and takes the people and
[2:03:15] essentially friends, we do not have to
[2:03:18] cow tower live under.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; That thing that Satan is trying to
[2:03:23] impose on a person, be it physical, be
[2:03:25] it spiritual, be it mental, or be it any
[2:03:27] other thing. I declare today that this
[2:03:30] God has spoken so that that power is
[2:03:33] broken. Amen.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; And all we have to do is believe it.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And that's why he just called the people
[2:03:41] up right then and began to lay hands on
[2:03:43] them or do whatever or just speak to
[2:03:45] them and he just spoke to them the word
[2:03:46] of the Lord and revealed their problem
[2:03:48] and told them to go. He didn't do that.
[2:03:50] That God that was doing that one after
[2:03:54] the other after the other. Didn't matter
[2:03:55] who they were. Didn't matter where they
[2:03:57] come from. Didn't matter what their
[2:03:58] background. Didn't matter what church
[2:03:59] they were from. the same God have the
[2:04:02] same answer for the same person for the
[2:04:05] for every different person.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; He he said something. I just want to
[2:04:16] drop these in. I just want to take maybe
[2:04:18] five minutes. I'm already 10 minutes
[2:04:19] over my time.
[2:04:22] But brother Ram said he said, "I stood
[2:04:24] on top of the mountain and up there is
[2:04:25] the is the pygmy
[2:04:28] uh juniper. There's pygmy spruce up
[2:04:31] there. And you go down a little bit
[2:04:33] further and there's the hemlock. And you
[2:04:36] go down a little bit further and uh and
[2:04:40] they hit the pine. And go down a little
[2:04:42] bit further and they hit the quaking
[2:04:45] asp. And then you go down into the buck
[2:04:48] brush a little further and then into the
[2:04:51] grass and on down into the weeds and on
[2:04:54] down into the desert where nothing. He
[2:04:57] said, "Each one a cell and a life of its
[2:05:02] own."
[2:05:04] Speaking of the environment
[2:05:07] where it lives,
[2:05:09] they all have life.
[2:05:12] And one's way up at the peak and it's a
[2:05:14] pygmy spruce. and on down
[2:05:19] the pine and the mountain aspar
[2:05:26] desert said but each one is a life each
[2:05:30] one is a cell of life but they actually
[2:05:33] speak to speak of and give testimony of
[2:05:37] where where they're living
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; the environment that they're living in
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; saints of God
[2:05:45] this word came
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; to give you a special environment.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you in the name of the Lord, if
[2:05:52] you live in this environment, you will
[2:05:54] bring forth the life that will speak of
[2:05:56] this environment.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; It'll be a message environment.
[2:06:02] And when Elisha followed Elijah and had
[2:06:05] just had that uh nonevent as it were, a
[2:06:09] mantle cast on him by the time he picked
[2:06:11] that mantle up and brother Brandham
[2:06:14] says, "Where is the God of the Lord
[2:06:16] Jesus Christ?"
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying today.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Where is the God of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:25] Christ?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; We're serving that God.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I declare that God.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; I declare that same deliverer and that
[2:06:35] same savior today over this pulpit. I
[2:06:37] declare that he is truth and outside of
[2:06:39] him there is no truth.
[2:06:50] elsewhere. But I'm concerned about and
[2:06:53] interested in what God does right here
[2:06:55] amongst us.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to declare the word so
[2:06:58] that you can believe the word and the
[2:07:00] Holy Spirit will cause that word to live
[2:07:02] and your life will speak of the
[2:07:04] environment that you live in.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; We don't preach of darkness. We don't
[2:07:10] preach of bondage. We preach of absolute
[2:07:12] deliverance and absolute liberty because
[2:07:15] that's the word of truth.
[2:07:19] It'll be up to you to respond.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; It'll be up to you to say, "This is my
[2:07:22] hour. This is my time.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deny. I'm going to deny
[2:07:27] myself. I'm going to deny the enemy. I'm
[2:07:28] going to deny the devil.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deny the world."
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; You'll come into a place that you never
[2:07:35] even knew existed.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And this is it.
[2:07:50] You know what I feel is happening?
[2:07:54] I feel that we're training especially
[2:07:56] you young men that are here. Especially
[2:07:59] men that are here.
[2:08:03] I feel that the Holy Spirit
[2:08:06] is urging me to say
[2:08:08] you are in training.
[2:08:12] God is training you to go further than
[2:08:15] where you have gone thus far.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; God is training you and putting you
[2:08:22] through a training period.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; We don't have a Bible school as such
[2:08:30] and we won't have.
[2:08:32] But here's what here's what the prophet
[2:08:34] of God
[2:08:35] he declares at the end of his message.
[2:08:41] He talks about a man that could
[2:08:44] sing
[2:08:46] and yield himself to that and men that
[2:08:48] could yield themselves to something
[2:08:50] else.
[2:08:51] But he said, "But there's a spirit that
[2:08:53] comes down and I yield myself to it." I
[2:08:56] I'd like to just try to say this. He
[2:09:01] said he said like one place he said like
[2:09:03] one and one is two and two and two is
[2:09:06] four and four and four is eight. He
[2:09:08] said, "I just go deeper and deeper and
[2:09:11] it breaks into a vision."
[2:09:15] Now, that's very simple.
[2:09:17] You would think somebody just some
[2:09:19] profound psych, you know, psychoanalysis
[2:09:23] or psycho
[2:09:24] psychology or something. He's just
[2:09:27] talking about yielding when it comes.
[2:09:33] And that same Holy Spirit is present
[2:09:35] here right now.
[2:09:39] for people just to yield and surrender
[2:09:42] themselves to.
[2:09:44] He says, "I I I feel it coming down
[2:09:47] now." And he's got a woman in need in
[2:09:48] front of him. I feel it coming right
[2:09:51] down now. And he said, "And I just yield
[2:09:53] to it."
[2:09:54] He didn't do crazy things.
[2:09:57] He didn't do nonsensical things. People
[2:10:01] sometimes I've seen and maybe you have
[2:10:04] seen too where they they go, you know,
[2:10:06] wild and and and demonstrative and so on
[2:10:09] so forth. Well, you know, I was just
[2:10:10] yielding to the Holy Spirit. But when
[2:10:12] you yield to the Holy Spirit, when you
[2:10:14] yield to the Holy Spirit, the one thing
[2:10:17] it will do, it will burst forth with the
[2:10:20] fragrance of the rose of Sharon. It will
[2:10:22] burst forth with something and it might
[2:10:25] burst forth with some praise and
[2:10:27] worship. That would be perfectly fine.
[2:10:30] But it will break it will break forth as
[2:10:32] something and you'll you'll begin to see
[2:10:35] evidence of a life that you as an
[2:10:38] individual in no wise could live.
[2:10:44] And brother Brandham called about having
[2:10:47] meetings in India or Africa.
[2:10:50] And he said, "And then maybe a 100,000
[2:10:53] converts are there." And he said, "I
[2:10:55] have no men
[2:10:58] to turn them over to." He said, "And
[2:11:01] then if there was men that could be they
[2:11:04] could be turned over to," he says, "then
[2:11:05] they could establish a little work and
[2:11:08] then from that work another work." And
[2:11:10] that's how it would go. That's what his
[2:11:12] whole soul was crying out for.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I thank God that that there has
[2:11:18] been and there is and there's churches
[2:11:20] all over and they're established and so
[2:11:22] on. But but here we've got uh we've got
[2:11:27] ablebodied,
[2:11:29] sharp, quickened mind. Men, I say don't
[2:11:34] don't don't surrender up just to this
[2:11:38] world
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; and what it has and what it will promise
[2:11:41] you. There's a higher calling. There's
[2:11:44] something that's better than the 12
[2:11:46] oxen.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; There's something that's better than the
[2:11:48] field. There's something that's even
[2:11:50] better than it has to be mom and dad and
[2:11:53] all our human relationships. I see
[2:11:55] people robbed because they can't let go
[2:11:57] of those relationships. But I can tell
[2:12:00] you one thing that God is calling
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; and a still small voice
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; and I went back over my life
[2:12:10] and say to you in all sincerity
[2:12:14] I've heard that voice
[2:12:16] and I desire to follow it with
[2:12:19] everything that's in me. I wonder if we
[2:12:23] I I would like to just uh
[2:12:26] sing that uh song if we could please. I
[2:12:28] want to sing a chorus. I've been a
[2:12:30] little bit longer than I wanted to be.
[2:12:36] I'd like to sing that chorus. Jesus be
[2:12:38] the Lord of all.
[2:12:44] Let's just bow in a moment of prayer.
[2:12:52] Lord God,
[2:12:56] God of Elijah,
[2:12:57] God of Elisha,
[2:13:00] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:13:04] may the God that demonstrated himself in
[2:13:08] Jesus Christ,
[2:13:11] come and demonstrate yourself even now,
[2:13:13] Lord, more than word, more than
[2:13:15] preaching.
[2:13:17] Let the dynamics of the Holy Spirit
[2:13:20] which have been promised to us in this
[2:13:22] message, let it begin to take effect in
[2:13:26] the lives of the people at this time, at
[2:13:30] this moment. Now, I can't begin to
[2:13:34] describe what may have been taking place
[2:13:37] in your heart, but there's if there's
[2:13:39] something very specific and something
[2:13:41] that you are talking to God about,
[2:13:45] just those that fall into that category.
[2:13:50] God has identified his still small voice
[2:13:53] and he's speaking to you and you wish to
[2:13:56] stand and by so doing
[2:14:00] acknowledge,
[2:14:02] Father God, I acknowledge that that's
[2:14:05] you speaking to me and I am now thus
[2:14:11] giving evidence that I'm saying yes, I'm
[2:14:14] yielding to your voice just now.
[2:14:21] Have we sing please
[2:14:27] Jesus be the Lord of all. Yeah.
[2:14:31] Hello
[2:14:35] Jesus.
[2:14:46] Just be
[2:14:49] the Lord
[2:14:51] of all
[2:14:54] the
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus I surrender all.
[2:15:04] Jesus
[2:15:06] I
[2:15:08] surrender
[2:15:10] all.
[2:15:13] Jesus
[2:15:15] I
[2:15:17] surrender
[2:15:20] all.
[2:15:23] Jesus
[2:15:25] I
[2:15:27] surrender
[2:15:29] all
[2:15:32] the king
[2:15:34] of all
[2:15:36] my heart. Jesus be the Lord of all.
[2:15:41] Jesus
[2:15:44] be
[2:15:45] the Lord
[2:15:48] of all.
[2:15:51] Jesus
[2:15:53] be
[2:15:54] the Lord
[2:15:57] of all.
[2:16:00] Jesus
[2:16:02] be
[2:16:04] the Lord
[2:16:06] of all
[2:16:08] the king
[2:16:13] my heart. We're singing this together.
[2:16:15] Some joint prayer now. Jesus I surrender
[2:16:20] I
[2:16:22] surrender
[2:16:25] all.
[2:16:27] Jesus
[2:16:29] I
[2:16:31] surrender
[2:16:34] all.
[2:16:36] Jesus
[2:16:38] I
[2:16:40] surrender
[2:16:43] all
[2:16:45] the greatness
[2:16:47] of
[2:16:49] my heart.
[2:16:52] Oh Lord Jesus.
[2:16:56] How many want to pray together with me
[2:16:58] now?
[2:16:59] If you'd like to raise your hand. I
[2:17:01] don't want to end the service like
[2:17:02] another service.
[2:17:05] We want to do business with God.
[2:17:08] Move me out, Lord. Maybe you're at
[2:17:11] Gilgal.
[2:17:13] Maybe you're at Bethl. Maybe you're at
[2:17:15] Jericho.
[2:17:17] And we need to move on.
[2:17:23] I believe that there is a separation
[2:17:25] that is needed. Separate me, oh God,
[2:17:28] from my own thoughts. I can tell you
[2:17:31] we're waring against it. Even now, Satan
[2:17:33] doesn't want that. He knows that if that
[2:17:36] separation comes, there's such a such a
[2:17:40] destruction to his kingdom. Amen.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Oh father God, in the name of Jesus
[2:17:46] Christ, I pray that you'll give great
[2:17:50] discernment
[2:17:52] and give courage to your sons and
[2:17:55] daughters. Give courage to your
[2:17:58] children, Father, at this time that they
[2:18:01] will listen to and heed and have their
[2:18:05] ear tuned to the voice, that still small
[2:18:08] voice, that inner voice of the spirit of
[2:18:11] God. And I say, "Oh, spirit of God,
[2:18:14] speak on.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Speak on.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Tell us what you would have us to know.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Give us the direction in our lives. Tell
[2:18:24] us what you'd have us to do. Tell us
[2:18:27] when we shall do it. Lord, I pray that
[2:18:30] we will move on. Oh God, take this
[2:18:32] congregation of people. Cause the
[2:18:35] lighthouse. Father, cause the light of
[2:18:38] this glorious word to shine on out.
[2:18:40] Father, let it ripple out further. Let
[2:18:43] these lives be a powerful testimony for
[2:18:46] you in the name of Jesus Christ. I claim
[2:18:49] that as our right.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to come in
[2:18:59] praying behind me.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Want you to pray and speak out your own
[2:19:03] heart. Oh God, we're not under any time
[2:19:06] restraint here. Oh God,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; you see the heart,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; let the people speak their heart. Let
[2:19:13] them pray their heart. For you said to
[2:19:16] call upon you.
[2:19:18] When your people call upon you, call
[2:19:21] upon your name, you will hear from
[2:19:23] heaven. Oh God, you'll hear. I'm praying
[2:19:27] this morning because I know you're
[2:19:29] hearing us. You're hearing us. You're
[2:19:31] seeing the hearts of the people. Don't
[2:19:33] let them get settled back, Lord. Don't
[2:19:35] let them be satisfied with Don't let
[2:19:38] them be satisfied with just the things
[2:19:40] of this life. Lord, don't let them be
[2:19:42] satisfied. Don't let them be caught up
[2:19:43] in it. Oh God, in the name of Jesus
[2:19:46] Christ, I pray a prayer of faith. Oh
[2:19:49] God, they'll be delivered from it in the
[2:19:52] name of Jesus. Oh granted, oh God,
[2:19:56] granted that everything we lay our hands
[2:19:57] to will be for the glory of the kingdom
[2:20:00] of God. Oh Lord, I pray you'll bless
[2:20:03] this people. Bless these families. Bless
[2:20:06] these young men and young women, oh God.
[2:20:08] And I pray that you will train young men
[2:20:11] for the kingdom, for the purpose of this
[2:20:13] word, Lord. Oh, what a great need we
[2:20:16] have. What a great need we have. Raise
[2:20:19] them up. Rear them up wherever they may
[2:20:20] go, wherever you may call them to, that
[2:20:23] they will be a powerful witness that no
[2:20:26] one will be able to withstand the word
[2:20:28] of witness that comes out of their mouth
[2:20:30] in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you,
[2:20:33] Father. We thank you, Father. We're
[2:20:36] moving on over out, Lord. We're moving
[2:20:39] further on. We're taking footsteps,
[2:20:42] which mean possession in our
[2:20:44] inheritance.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:20:50] Thank you, Father.
[2:20:54] Hallelujah.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:23:12] and men young men
[2:23:16] you be aware that you will sense and
[2:23:20] feel the presence of God in a different
[2:23:23] way around you not just talk I'm not
[2:23:27] talking about teenagers I'm talking
[2:23:29] about God needs
[2:23:33] stalwart
[2:23:34] men who know the voice of God and will
[2:23:39] move out in that realm.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; I pray that God will open up spheres,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; another sphere for you, another channel
[2:23:49] for you.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hey folks, we've got enough. There's any
[2:23:55] number of people that are just living

[2:24:36] that you will dismiss us and give us
