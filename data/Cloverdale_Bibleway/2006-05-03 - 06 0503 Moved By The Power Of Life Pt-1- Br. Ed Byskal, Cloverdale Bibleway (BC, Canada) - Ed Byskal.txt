He'll be here. Lord will answer our prayers. Amen. Just hold it before him this evening. Brother Tom Frey has a request for a coworker. Uh the White family lost a 14-year-old grandson who's killed last night. So his co-orker asked for prayer. Uh also our sister Patty Pettingale, I guess she just came out of the hospital today.

Please pray for a speeder recovery. Amen. God has answered to meet all these needs. Whatever need you have on your heart, just lift it before him. Amen. As brother Mike comes, spare our hearts. Our precious heavenly father. Lord, once again, Lord, it is good to be in your house, Lord God. At the ending of a day, Lord God, we can just turn all our thoughts, Lord, over to you, Lord God. Just empty out from the world, Lord God, and just come and sit at your feet, Lord Jesus. It's just so good, Lord. Just to come through the doors and Lord, just to hear the music, Lord, the atmosphere being created by faithful musicians, Lord God. And Lord, just setting our hearts right, our spirits free, Lord God. We just thank you, Father, that Lord, we can just cuddle in next to you tonight, Lord Jesus. And Father, we just come, Lord, with open hearts, Lord God, just desiring to hear from you this evening, Lord Jesus. We thank you for the wonderful things you have done in our lives thus far, Lord God. I think of how your prophet said, Lord, of how that Lord, a true worship, Lord, is just to present ourselves a living sacrifice. Oh God, Lord, it's not just with our lips, Lord God, with our life lived out for you, oh God. And Lord, we just want to consecrate ourselves once again, Lord God, just empty out of self and sin, Lord God. Cleanse us from every failing, oh God. And Lord, we come before you, Lord, just to ask you, Lord, for these special favors, Lord God. Lord, you know every need that was mentioned, Father, for our sister Karen, Lord, for her. I believe it was her daddy. I can't remember, Father, but God, you know each and every need, Lord Jesus. Father, for sister Patty Pettingill, Lord God, uh we just pray that you would touch her and body as well, oh God. Just bring her to a speedy recovery, Lord. many people, Lord God, uh been afflicted, Lord Jesus. We just ask you, Father, just to touch us once again, Father God. Lord, that we may better serve you, Lord Jesus. We just commit this night to you, Father, and pray that you would speak to our hearts now. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. Our sister Ella has a special for us. So, uh maybe we'll just sing a song and then she can come and get ready. Uh we also want to remind uh the young people that there's a young people service this Friday 7:30. So, sure you all remember, but doesn't hurt to just remind everyone be there for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You happy this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing. Amen. God's children can't shout and sing. I don't think anyone has a right to be happy about anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing. For the waves growing bright and our souls are on the way. We are going by to the palace of king. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Yes. The children of Lord have a right to shout and sing for the way we're going right and our souls are on the way. Oh, we are going by and by to the palace of the king. Glory to God. Hallelujah. It's a fast good oldfashioned uh southern gospel song and I know we all know it and I would trust you'll just join in with me on the chorus but it's oldfashioned and simple but it is my testimony. Praise the Lord. We are often tossed and driven on this restless sea of time. Somber skies and howling tempest off succeeded a bright sunshine. In that land of perfect when the mist has rolled awake, we will understand and fitter by and by. Oh, by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we will tell the story of how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by. Trials dark on every hand. And I cannot understand all the way that God would lead us to that blessed promised land. But he guides me with his eyes. And I'll follow till I die. And I'll understand it better by and by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we'll tell a story of how we've overcome and we'll understand it better by and by. Temptations, hidden snares often take us unaware. And our hearts are made to flee by our thoughtless word and deed. And we wonder why the test though we try to do our best. And we'll understand it better by and by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God come together at home, we'll tell the story of how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by. Oh by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we'll tell the story of how we overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by. Oh my and by. When the morning comes, when all the shame of God are gather, we'll tell the story of how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better. We'll understand it better. We'll understand it better. flying by. Thank you Jesus. Give him praise. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing at the cross. At the cross where I first saw the light. Amen. The light's still shining this evening in our hearts. Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart roll away. Oh, it was there by I received my side and now I am happy all day. First verse. The last hand is my savior. And in my sovereign God would he s oh cross that cross is where I burn saw light and the burnings of my heart roll way. It was there by me. I received my side. And now I am happy all day. Was for the tree. Amazing. I receive my son and now I am happy all day. Well might the sun in God is high and shine his glory. And Christ the mighty mater. Oh, and the rock and roll where I saw and the bird of my heart roll away. It was there by faith. I receive my son and now I am happy all day. But drops of rain can the debt of the high. Dear Lord, I give myself away is all that I can do. Oh, and cross and cross where I burst all and the burdens of my heart go away. It was there by me. I received my son and now I am happy all the day. Amen. Are you thankful that your burdens rolled away? &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to pick them up tomorrow morning. They're gone in the sea of God's forgetfulness. Amen. Like to sing the chorus of blessed assurance just as we turn the service over to brother Ed. as we do. I just uh I don't know how many people noticed it, but the song service is a little different in that every song we've sang tonight was written by one person, Banny Crosby. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just I read a little uh life story of her on Sunday and it touched my heart. Brother Brandham spoke of her many times. Just amazing what one person yielded to God &gt;&gt; can do just bring us into the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's many times he spoke what do you think of Jesus? He said what do you think Penny Crosby? What do you think of this Christ? And she panned pass me not. Oh gentle savior hear my humble cry. While on others thou art calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do not pass me by. Thou the spring of all my comfort. Says, think of it. &gt;&gt; More than life to me. Whom have I on earth beside thee? Whom in heaven but thee? &gt;&gt; Friends, we're looking to one tonight. &gt;&gt; If we can just focus, just pull on the word. &gt;&gt; He's here to meet our needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the ministry comes forth, it'll just touch our hearts. Heal the sick, touch, save the lost soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my story and this is my song. Will you sing it with me as we stand? This is my story. This is my song. Praising my soul. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day. Oh, bless. Heat. Heat. Oh sales and my soul. Oh my god. Praising my savior all the day long. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Perfect submission. Here it is. World is myure now on my side. Angels descending praise from the mercy whis. This is my soul. This is my song. We bless your name for praise my soul. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we're so thankful to be back in the house of God locally here to hear the singing and the worship and to know that we're ready to hear the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming to church tonight, we listen to the brothers when the men sang, "I know his voice." &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, you can sing that again for me. That's just lovely. Amen. Glad we know his voice. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. just got a excuse me, just got a uh uh word from brother Gido in Belgium and he just wanted to let us know because he just received his visa for Siberia and he is he will be going to Siberia. He's uh setting all the things in place now. uh he he's going to the capital of Siberia this time and many of the children that he visited in the far reaches of s northern part of Siberia and Siberia is north but the northern part he visited those uh orphanages over these years and these orphan children now have grown into adults and many of them are in the cap they're there working so he's contacted them and he's going to be with them. And so, let's just pray that God will give them a gracious time. Uh, you know, I'm sure it's not a it's not a simple matter for them to try to live uh the life that that he's he's taught them to and and that the word teaches and we don't know how how uh how much available the message is to them. But I but brother Go asked us if we'd remember to pray for him. Also, brother Deepak Titus, he's uh he's probably uh streaming tonight. He and his wife and two children immigrated from India. I know brother Dpac's father. He's a pastor, wonderful pastor in India. They stream quite a few of our meetings as well. And uh Brother Deepac has an uncle in Winnipeg who sponsored him to come to Canada. and they just arrived uh about three weeks ago. They're in Winnipeg now and uh they consider that as a as a just a a stopping place for the time being. They expect to be here, Lord willing, end of June. They really need to spend about 2 3 months there because they were sponsored there under a certain program. But he wants to come here and he's very very well educated in um in uh technical uh engineering. Uh he has taught in the colleges and universities in India. And so we're hoping that uh well we believe that God will give him a place and a position here. God's never never left us out on a limb, has he? &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? And he said their their only desire, I mean their only desire, he said they just are yearning to be in the fellowship. They want to be here. And while they've streamed it, to them it's not quite good enough. And uh so we're we want you to really welcome them when they come. And uh we're we're attempting to have a place for them to uh to live in just for a time being until they get kind of settled. But they want to be it. It's wonderful when you have people that come from so far and the only thing they got in their mind is we want to be in the fellowship. We've seen the people but we want to be there. We want to be a part of it. We want our children in the school. And those are the two main things on their mind. And the third thing is a job just enough to keep us uh alive. I think God will honor that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he will. Amen. Others have been calling all all in just two days. in fact is quite a bit today. Others are calling and uh we got a we got a request from Africa they a couple while I was there a family there has been witnessing to a Chinese family and they're interested in the message and they just didn't know you know uh h how how much more to approach them or how they can approach them and when I was able to tell them we've got a whole website with the messages translated and they can hear brother Brandham's voice with the voice over uh brother Murphy speaking the message. They were just thrilled. So they just right away got it on email today. What is that website? We we want to get our people onto that website right away. I tell you friends, God hasn't done this in a corner. &gt;&gt; It's just all it's just all over. Uh I read today there are those that are so opposed to the message. I read some and uh you know that we were in brother Brandham's meetings and and then they go on with all of their I will call it nonsense because that's what it is and never really quote him. &gt;&gt; You know, never really say what he said, but say what they think he said. Oh, I'm so glad for the word of God and what it's done for you and I. Amen. And so, we're going to go turn to the scriptures, but just before we do, let's just bow once more in prayer. Father, uh we have spoken about brother Gido and we we ask as a congregation that you will be very very near to him that you will guide every footstep. Go with he and brother Dennis his uh interpreter as they make their way Lord from spot to spot from station to station from city to city from orphanage to orphanage. I think of those children, Lord Jesus. And when you were here, you took the time, you set the adults aside and you drew the children to yourself and you said, you said that they were blessed. And I pray, Lord, that that uh I know that even now these children that have not mother nor father and have not anything of this world's goods. And Lord, the future is bleak. But here comes brother G with a testimony of a Lord Jesus that loves children. And I pray that you will speak to their hearts and touch them, Lord, even as you touch my own heart as a child. Oh God, I pray that you will just so anoint him and give him a give him a a series of uh meetings this time such as he's never had before in the name of Jesus Christ. Be with our brother Deepac, Lord, and his sister and his wife, Sister Vanana. And I pray, Lord, that you will make a way for them, oh God, as they're looking to you and others that have called and we said we would remember them in prayer. I pray, Father, that you will be very near them. And now, Lord, anoint as the word is uh the message has already been blessed by prayer, our brother Mike praying. I pray, Father, that as I stand at the post of duty, you'll just anoint us and touch us physically and spiritually in every way. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you for standing. Turn if you would to uh second Peter. And I would like with God's help to perhaps just lay some foundation uh this evening uh for for Sunday. And uh Lord willing, I'll be speaking Sunday morning. You want to pray for my voice? I've been having some increased trouble with my throat and I just don't know what the answer is. I know who causes it. &gt;&gt; D with a capital D. The devil. You're agreeing with me, are you? All right. That's good. That's good. I needed some agreement. So, if you want to say sickum tonight, well, you you just go ahead and that'll help me along. &gt;&gt; We're going to read from the 15th verse of the chapter one of Second Peter. Moreover, I will endeavor that ye will that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Uh but where eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven. We heard when we were with him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your hearts. Knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. You may be seated and keep your Bibles handy and ready if you would please. I I'd like you to notice the last verse which we just read. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Uh I I want to take a thought moved by the power of life. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said there's only two powers in the world and that is the power of life and the power of of death. Only God and Satan. That's only two. He said we have wars and uprisings and all kinds of conflicts. People rise against people, nation against nation, all kinds of of of things taking place throughout the entire world. We hear of it. We become accustomed to it. But always remember, he said only two powers. Only two powers. All humanity, six billion of us because we are part of that community. And every person in this building and under the sound of my voice is directed by one of those two. &gt;&gt; There is no in between. &gt;&gt; It's either God directing us or Satan directing us. &gt;&gt; And I realize we can be, you know, under we can be as sons and daughters of God and we're being guided by the the Holy Spirit. And I realize we can, you know, uh, perhaps take a detour and and get sidetracked and all of those things, but I I want to, uh, have you be thinking with me and remember the scriptures that we use tonight and that you'll keep them in mind, bear them in mind these next days until Sunday. And so we want to enlarge on them, the Lord willing. But I want to think about this uh this aspect of being motivated because we are all are motivated. We're moved by something and we we understand that term that terminology. It's it's a common term to us today. Uh we hear of motivational speakers and people that are highly motivated and people that are not motivated. At least they don't think they're motivated. But even if a person thinks they're not motivated, they are being they are being driven by something. Some people might be driven more slowly than others. Some are very very highly motivated people and we can say they're driven. They're driven for something. People are driven for a lot of different things. You know, during the gold rush it was gold fever. That's what they called it. But you should see the documentaries I've seen, you know, many years ago and seen these men and they had camels up in this country. Did you know that they had camels in this country walking in the snow? They had donkeys and everything else and the men packing things on their backs. You talk about being driven, hoping and expecting that, you know, they're going to get rich and they call it gold fever. There's all kinds of fevers. I want to believe that tonight and as I pondered this subject and thought about it for the last number of days, even while I was away, I trust that we could be a people that have a message fever &gt;&gt; driven driven by a spirit that brought the message and that we would have a message fever. There's there's a a a myriad of things today that motivate people and I want to just name some of them off so from our just our natural uh uh surroundings but a a motive now a motive is that which incites motion or action. If you have a motive, it incites motion or action. And a motive is also having power to move or to cause motion. That's having a motive. A motive may signify either a mental impulse or something external, an object that you see or a desire that you have so that it induces or causes action. I want you to hold that. Now the Bible is a record of highly motivated people. Both men and women have been driven by something that even they could not understand. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that if the prophets had known what it was they were saying, they would have in no way said it. &gt;&gt; They didn't understand what they were saying. They many times did not do not know what they were doing. They couldn't understand their actions. Brother Brandam says, "I believe it is in things that are to be." He said, "You know, when uh like when we're children, we don't uh the things that of of adult life and the things that our parents and adults do seem so mysterious to you. But when you get of age and you enter into adulthood yourself, then you look back and you see that that it it it all makes it all fit so well. It all makes so much sense. When we're a child, we thought of a child. Thought as a child, we act as a children as children. But when when we get older, then we understand the things that were such a mystery. And he said, he said, you know, you it might look like a a mystery. It was so mysterious at the time. You you kind of stumbled into a a little building and and heard the gospel. And he said, just fell right down at the altar and gave your life to Christ. And it all seems so mysterious, but something was driving you. &gt;&gt; And it's either life or death. &gt;&gt; It's either the power of life or death that is causing an impulse within us to do what we do. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it's not something that's just a flash in the pan. It's it's something this motivation that I'm speaking of is something that is so consistent. It is it's continuous. It's not something that's a big boom here and a shotgun there and and then nothing in between. You know, it's something that is consistent and it keeps moving a person forward. Sometimes faster than other times, but we're moving forward. We go in the same direction week after week and month after month and year after year. and you see a person years later and they're just the same, only they're further down the road. They're more established, more stronger in their faith and in what they believe, they've not changed one bit because that's really the power that I'm talking about tonight. Some of the things that people are motivated by today or that motivate people today and and some of these things you may you know have thought of no doubt have thought of but I want to just focus on them a wee bit. The media and advertising is is a huge huge industry and it's it's out there today in every newspaper and every magazine and every kind of form of of media whether it radio or television or internet or whatever more. It's out there to motivate you to spend your money. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got money, use your credit card. And if you don't have a credit card, borrow from a bank. Do something, but spend some money. &gt;&gt; That's the name of the game, friends. Oh, you might be quiet, but that's all right. I'm going to preach it anyway. &gt;&gt; It motivates. It's there to motivate people and it entices it. You see it in the eyes and you hear it in the ears and my, it looks so wonderful. And there's only 1.9% interest. And mine I And you can have it right now. And you don't have to pay anything for 12 months. &gt;&gt; Fill your house full of furniture. You don't have to pay a penny. Don't tell me that you haven't got an impulse. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh my, it's just the right color and it's the right everything and I just think I need it." you know, &gt;&gt; hey, this whole industry, you think there's people that are scheming right now while you and I are sitting here, they're working in their little uh offices and they're at their drafting board and they're trying to draw uh they're scheming at drawing the sleek lines of next year's automobiles. &gt;&gt; What are they trying to do? Their intent is when that thing hits the hits the magazine, you're going to see it and say, "Oh, wow. I got to have that." &gt;&gt; And they say, "Just what we figured. &gt;&gt; That's just what we planned." What have they done? They've motivated you &gt;&gt; by what you've seen. And and it it's it's it's it's given you a motivation. It's to persuade you. And furthermore, brother brother Brand tells, you know, some of these things sounds real real simple, but he heard an ad or uh saw an ad or something of this soap. &gt;&gt; You remember &gt;&gt; the soap just does it by itself. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do anything. You just put the dishes and you use this soap. You put the dishes in. You bring them out. They're just sparkling, squeaky clean. And so he said to his wife, "Let me do the dishes. I got some of this stuff. This is just magic." Put it in there. Put that old dirty dish with all the dried egg on it. Brought it out. It was just the same. He said, "That's a fraud. That's not true." But you see, what they're wanting to do is cause you to believe that what they're saying is the truth. is the truth. And if you are persuaded that it's the truth, then they if they can make you believe that's the truth, then you'll have an impulse to buy it. &gt;&gt; Now, what about religion? &gt;&gt; If they can make you believe that this doctrine or what they have is absolute truth, who doesn't want truth? We want truth. &gt;&gt; We want the truth. and to say, "Oh, it sounds truth and it looks true and I think I'll believe it." And there you are. And it swallows people up. And that is why that is why a prophet would need to come with a thus sayeth the Lord. So that uh there'll be a people that will appeal to that or that that will appeal to them and they'll say I don't understand it and I don't know why I'm hitting the altar and I don't know why I'm surrendering my life and I don't know why exactly my mind is is trying to do gymnastics with it but somehow deep in my inner man, my inner being, my soul is saying yay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's an impulse &gt;&gt; that you're having and it's &gt;&gt; life. &gt;&gt; Life is pulsating. &gt;&gt; I think of patriotism. I'm not trying to preach on these things now. I just want to go over a few. I think of patriotism. People become patriotic and they become very fervent. They become patriotic to the point I'm willing to give my life for my country and for the cause that my government puts forward and I believe in what they're saying and I'm going to join the force and I'm going to go I'm going to go and fight. I'm going to give my life and they do. &gt;&gt; Many of them do for patriotism. They're motivated by patriotism. Others have a cause. Uh there's causes of there for for poverty. Uh for uh cancer uh no the world knows of of Terry the Terry Fox run. Terry Fox the boy from over here on the other side of the river Kquitlam or north uh Port Kquitlam I believe it was whichever. And and they have Terry Fox runs now all over the world. One boy running with an artificial leg across Canada. Didn't quite make it, but he ran he ran hundreds and hundreds of miles, thousands miles. I forget he made about 3/4 of the way across and then and then died. But it caught &gt;&gt; it caught the imagination of people and people that have to run. He I think he I think he brought in around $20 million in his run for cancer and and and he gave him a name in history, but it motivated people and people all over the world want to run in the Terry Fox run. One man, you know, he he caught their imagination. There's people today where, you know, they're motivated for AIDS and they're motivated. They do all kinds of things. And the streets of many cities in America in the last week have been filled with hundreds of thousands of people. Hundreds of thousands of people because they're motivated on the on the immigration issue and who should be allowed immigration and and these that the government is called illegal. What would we do without them? Our country needs them. Our our industry needs them. And everybody has a cause. Everybody has an issue. But people are motivated by it. You can't say they're not motivated. Something pulsates in them and they're not ashamed to get out in front and you know here we got a message. &gt;&gt; Don't hold it back. Are you ashamed of it? They they get out there their banners and right in front of the cameras and hold it up. We got a cause. We're motivated. We we got to if they got a cause, it's just a just something for time. What about you got eternal life? Amen. &gt;&gt; Man said he was an atheist. I wish I had it. I could read it for you because it puts most of most believers to shame really in one way. But he says, "If I really believed that there was a hell that burned and people were going to be tormented and my friends were and the people I work with, etc. And if I really believed there was a place of such bliss as as Christianity says, heaven. And if I really believed that this was eternal life, and this was, of course, he thought that was eternal damnation. But he said, "If I really believe that, there'd be no ocean too wide. There'd be no mountain too steep. There'd be no cold too severe. There'd be no desert too hot. There'd be no place there'd be no hardship." And he could see himself giving everything in in in absolute fanatical surrender. What's he saying? I'd be motivated if I really believed that. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We aren't all motivated the same way, but we should be all motivated by the same thing. &gt;&gt; And that's the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is life. Life is motivating us on. And we don't change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What we are today motivates us tomorrow and we have a good time, it still motivates us through. We have a bad time, that has nothing to do with that. Things go sideways, things go up, things go in reverse, things go absolutely, people turn against us. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; We're motivated &gt;&gt; by a power and it's a power of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our own human reasoning can motivate people. They come to a certain determination. The influence of another person can motivate someone say, "I think you should do this." And they do it. And as I said, religion and the millions that give their lives for the cause. And last but not least, the Holy Ghost motivates people. I was reading in the scripture. It's Acts the 10th chapter. We won't necessarily turn to it just now, but perhaps on Sunday if you wish to read it. Acts the 10th chapter. And it's really striking in the light of this thought that I'm bringing to you. Peter, who's been brought up in strict teaching of the law, that's all they've known. He he he is a uh he's been taught by his parents. He's a Jew taught in there all the precepts of Judaism. We've been brought up to like you have as you've been brought up. And he sees in the vision a sheet coming down all kinds of creeping animals and different things. Creeping things and animals on there, clean and unclean, I guess. And and a voice says to him, "Rise up." and eat. He said, "Nothing unclean has ever touched my lips. I I've never eaten anything unclean." And it happens three times. That has such an effect on him. And then the voice says to him, "Arise, there's men at the door." And he goes down to those men. And those three men have been sent by Cornelius who's a centurion of the band of the Italian called the Italian band. So he's over a hundred men of the Italian band. And they're saying a devout man, Cornelius, a centurion, has sent us for you to come there. Now he's just told the Lord, he said, "I've never allowed anything unclean to touch to touch my lips." and he knows what it is. Now, now he's being called to go to these Gentiles. And furthermore, he's a he he's a a soldier. He's an officer of the army that has got Israel under under its iron hand. &gt;&gt; He says, "Go to him." And now the power of of that spirit that is an anointing him, the power of it is stronger than his teaching all the way from childhood. The precepts from from babyhood up to manhood, it just disappears. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. That's real motivation. Now, he didn't go up and j dance and have a whole bunch of there's no emotion attached to it at all. He just now he's moved by a quiet deep &gt;&gt; power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't understand it. And they spend the next day traveling and he comes to Cornelius's house. Cornelius has been moved. He's he he he's motivated to call for this man. And I see there's there's such a a a merging together. Now, we read it like a story, but it's a whole lot more than a story, friends, because there was a whole lot more to it. This man, this man Peter especially had had all of his religious precepts displaced. Now, he had already received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, but nothing was said that he was going to lay all of this aside. But that one experience of God is so real that he can not escape it. And not only that, but when when God gives it to him, he actually knows what it means. You know, that's why people come into services such as tonight, Sunday. People who know nothing but the message. They don't even know what you're talking about. People who know very little about the scripture, they'll come into a meeting and a minister might be into the depths of the word preaching for with all the force and and and the richness that God has given him for the people. And somebody will sit there who's an absolutely ignorant of all spiritual things, but he understands or she perfectly what you're saying and they have an interpretation because it it ministers to them and they see themselves and they see exactly what they're supposed to do and they're motivated by it. and say, "You told my whole life." Maybe there was really nothing in it that related to them. But when God does it, it just shows exactly what you're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; So now, the scripture that we read said that the holy men of God, they spake as they were moved. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost. And this word moved. It isn't that just that they had an impulse, but this particular word is to bear. You're like you're carrying something. You're to bear or bring forth. And I want to not want you to notice the the different places that it's used in the scriptures. We'll be able to use our Bibles in just a moment. So now it's to carry some burden. It says in Malachi, the burden of the word of the Lord. Not the burden of the prophet Malachi, but the burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're a believer of the message. You believe and you have certain things that you hold dear to actually bring those out. to bring those out as the Holy Spirit intends to bring them out in the in the in the place that you live to hold it forth as a testimony. It actually comes as a burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a weight. &gt;&gt; It's something you're carrying. &gt;&gt; It's not some light flippant thing, but it's something that is is weighty. It's heavy, &gt;&gt; and you're bearing it. You're carrying it. you're bringing it forth &gt;&gt; and there's a responsibility with it. &gt;&gt; It has to be carried with a certain kind of a a a dignity or spiritual integrity. It's carried. It's not something you know when God entrusted this to us. It wasn't a light matter. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something that we that that's why I I get burdened. I was today when I look over the country and and see and and sometimes such a evil report comes on the message and I feel it's unnecessary. it wasn't really necessary. And then you have to say, "Well, God, you know, maybe, you know, uh there's been those that have embraced the message, turn away from it." To me, you know what they did? They stood right on the path that Jesus walked by. And as he walked by, they put lashes on his back. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what they did. &gt;&gt; They lashed him as he walked by and wounded his body and brought evil report on him. a false report. And I and I and I it breaks my heart when I see something like that. We have been entrusted because God believes in you. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, God trusted Job. I believe he's trusted. If you are a believer and he's given you what he's given you, then God has trusted you with it. Amen. And that should move us and motivate us to hold it with a real respect and hold it with an integrity. Say, I'll not deny it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll not bring it down. I'll hold it up. I have an impulse within me to hold it high. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And so that's what it was within these prophets. Now, the Bible tells us I I I haven't wanted to turn to it, but I'm going to turn to it. Um, in First Peter, I believe I have it here. First Peter uh verse 10, of which salvation, now notice it's talking about the prophets again, of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently. Oh, I wish we could see them tonight. see those men of God, holy prophets of old, inquiring, searching diligently. You know, they just didn't walk over to the neighbor's house or they didn't turn on a radio. They didn't have any of that. It was year after year. They searched the scriptures and poured back and forth over the scriptures, searching it by their candle light, searching diligently, seeking. And they said, and and they inquired and searched diligently who prophesied. They had prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ notice the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it that's the spirit of Christ when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. Now here's these men just get you can look up now. Here's these men, holy men, godly men, men who you'd love to have in your home, men who you'd love to have as your neighbor, as your confidant, as someone you could talk to, holy men of God. And the spirit which was in them did signify of the sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow. And and it was in them. And they were inquiring. They were wanting to determine when is this going to be? How is this going to happen? And and God held it from them &gt;&gt; to make it known &gt;&gt; at a later time and to other people and to another generation. And I can tell you uh without a shadow of a doubt in my mind that the apostles the apostles would love to have seen what you see today. &gt;&gt; They would love to have lived in this time. And quite frankly, I think they'd tear the country up. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think some of them be thrown in jail &gt;&gt; because they would not be able to hold their peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we we might well be getting ready for who knows what the future is. We're not going to be considered nicer people all the time. There's going to be a spiritual, as I said, an integrity that that the world cannot deny. But Jesus said, "The world will hate you." &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; They will hate you because there's only two powers in the world. It's Satan and God. And Satan hates God. And if you have God in you, you're going to be hated &gt;&gt; by the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you can also take your Bibles and uh this being moved by the Holy Spirit, what moved the uh holy men of God, what moved them to speak and caused them to bring forth uh in John John 12 and verse 24. This will just put a little different slant on it here for the moment. Verily, verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth fruit. That is the same word as it moved. What moved the prophets? Now Jesus is saying he's using exactly the same word that if a corn and wheat fall in the ground and it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth it bringeth forth fruit. In John 15 and2, every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, this is bearing, the same as carrying the word, it bears the fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit. Let me just stop here for a moment before we go on to the other scriptures and say this that I it is if you will just relax and just trust what God has done in a person's life in your own individual life. The branch does not wrestle and struggle to bear the fruit. It will bear the fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; The life is is like an involuntary power that's in it. But for a believer, there's one thing that we need do need to do. Brother Lance ministered on it on Sunday. And that is one thing you can do. And that is where your choice comes in. You can yield &gt;&gt; or you can resist it. &gt;&gt; See, and that is where we need to yield to the Holy Spirit. then the Holy Spirit will do the work. You just need to yield to it. And that yielding is a is a continual thing. All right. In in John 15:4, also abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear, it's moved by the Holy Ghost cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine. No more can ye except you abide in me. John 15 and5 we find it again. I'm the vine, you are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bring bringeth which is being moved bringeth forth much fruit, for without me you can do nothing. And then in Acts 2 and two, this is interesting. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing. And the word rushing is the same word as beareth fruit to bear fruit or holy men of God where moved same word rushing wind coming on the what happened then those people they begin to act different than when they'd walked in the doors &gt;&gt; they began to do different things and the Holy Ghost came upon them they spake in other languages. and they walked out &gt;&gt; absolutely uh possessed &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. They were possessed of another spirit but as a spirit of life &gt;&gt; and they walked out into the world, different people. &gt;&gt; Peter a coward before and now he stands up and says hear me. He denied it before, but now he's saying, "Hear me." by the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the power of life, and it moved through him. Whether whether they were in prison, whether they were threatened, it always was the same. Or they might be for uh 3,000 coming on the day of Pentecost and being converted. How glorious. But it wasn't that way always. But the spirit that was in them was always always the same. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The spirit that was motivating them wasn't up today, down tomorrow, 100° now, now zero, below zero. No, no, no. It's the same all the time. And it's moving through you. Whether you see it or you don't see it, it's moving through you. You have to believe that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A rushing mighty wind and to fill all the house where they were sitting. Now in trying to do a service without his will, brother Brandham refers to the burden of the word of the Lord. And he says, "Brethren, don't miss this." Now, if you know, trying to do a service, I want to just give the setting perhaps for the young people. Brother Brandham was speaking to the Christian businessmen. The Christian businessmen were under the impression the preachers have failed. Preachers have failed. Churches have failed. They're all split up. And now we've come together. And the one reason brother Brandham came and actually opened up many chapters for them was because he did agree with them on this one major point. And that is that they were they were disregarding all the denominational barriers. I'm a Catholic. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Methodist. I'm a Pentecostal. And for that one thing, Brother Brandham opened up chapters for them because he supported them. But they also had other things. They believed that prosperity was spirituality. But if they prospered, they were really spiritual. And he chopped that down. And they also believed that churches have failed, ministers have failed, and we're the ones God has prospered us. We're blessed. We're going to take the gospel to the world. And so he he he told him here and trying to do trying to do God a service without his will, he went back to the scripture and he said David had a better idea of how to get the word to the people said the ark is away. We need to bring the ark back. The ark was supposed to be on the shoulders of the Levites but others said we're and brother Brandham says they got anointed. &gt;&gt; In other words, they were motivated &gt;&gt; by the anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So a person could get anointed and oh really enthused. He also used the word enthused. And because they were enthused, they were motivated. But the cart was wrong. &gt;&gt; They put it on a cart. And the word has to be moved. And it's the same today. &gt;&gt; I'm not here by my choice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Any man of God that takes the word of God, the word of God moves to the people on the shoulders of the Levites, and it'll never be any other way. &gt;&gt; Others may do it, &gt;&gt; but God will not support it. &gt;&gt; And it be a it'll be a nice card. It might be a better card. It might be fancier. It might have more money behind it, but God won't be behind it. And so God and so, Brother Brandham is saying, don't miss this. And my sisters, you who want to be woman preachers and so forth, don't you miss this. No matter how much your anointing is, you've got to get in God's provided position. And he said, David's anointing was all right. He was dancing. He was having a time. Don't tell me he wasn't happy. And and we could say, "Was it God's will to bring that word back?" Of course it is. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You'd think that would be more important than how it came back. &gt;&gt; If we were back there at that time, and I can almost hear myself saying it in my ignorance. I don't care how it gets back as long as it gets back. &gt;&gt; But not with God's program. &gt;&gt; The program that he set up is the program that he was going to bless. And it's the only program he was going to bless. &gt;&gt; And so they were anointed. He says, "And David's anointing was all right, but in doing it, he got enthused." He got enthused and stepped over the boundary line. Oh my, I I've just seen so much of it. They people get enthused and then they cross the border boundary line of how God has ordained a thing to be done. So we need to stay in that program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it was on the shoulders of his ministers. His ministers was the Levites. Put it over their left shoulder and pack the ark like this because it was up over their heart and they had the burden of the word of the Lord. See, the word of the Lord is not, you know, as a minister, I can tell you we we don't sit in a room and and try and get a message or just read some interesting material and try to get a message. That's not it. The burden of the word may be a burden that you'll have for a very very long time and then it'll just evolve and it'll just move and finally the time will come and God will show it in the scripture and say, "Here it is." You know, speak it to the people. And then someone comes after it and says, "Oh, just right now I needed that just at this minute." &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, the greatest battle. Now, these are just some of the quotes I'm giving you. Do you realize some of the things which I just said inspirationally? Now, I want to give you the quote. Do you realize that there's really only two powers in the universe? of all of our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything. It all amounts up to two powers. There's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms. Two powers and two kingdoms. All the rest of the little minor things are connected with either one of those two powers. All the rest are just little minor things are connected with one of these two powers. And those powers is God's power and Satan's power. That's what every war, every disorder, everything that comes along, it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power. And that is the power of life and the power of death. And so, just to kind of set your minds and perhaps the Lord willing, I'd like to be able to come on to this on Sunday. If we took different people through the scriptures that we could relate to, we'll find times in their life where there was no mistake whatsoever that it was God. They say, "I know that that's God. An angel of the Lord came or whatever more." And Lord willing, I may come to this. I just I was going to hold it back, but I just mentioned Samuel as a as a boy, 12 years old. Now, most of you fellas here are beyond that. He's just 12 years old, they say. And now he hears a voice, calls his name, he goes to Eli cuz he thinks Eli's calling him. And that happens about three times. And Eli tells him, "Go and lay down again." And if he calls you, say, "Here am I." Your servant hears. And he goes and and he hears a call again. Now listen closely. That voice that was calling him was going to be the motivating force in his life from that day on. &gt;&gt; But he didn't know it. Even to the time he was being rejected years and years later, he's now being rejected by the very nation he was a prophet to and are rejecting him and saying, "Samuel, give us a prophet." And they had a reason for it because his sons had gone had gone and done evil and he got old and they said, "Give us give us a pro give us a king." And he told him what the king would do. But he was being rejected. And even in that rejection, even when he's being rejected, and we can all relate to that, we've been turned aside by somebody. We've lost some friends. And even in rejection, that same voice he heard because that was life. &gt;&gt; That was life back then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was still life. It was life when he was in the midst of his, shall we say, glory days. It was life and it was life. And some of you maybe this evening you're everything's just going right on top and say it's just great. And maybe to someone else, you might be saying this is the hardest time of my life right now. I've never gone through a harder time. But I will say this, the voice that you once heard and you didn't even know who it was that was calling you, that's the same voice that's motivating you and pushing you on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'll push you on &gt;&gt; and he'll just drive you on it. You You don't feel some great enthusiasm, but he's there. He's pushing you forward. He's moving you forward. And my brothers and sisters, tonight, I want to say to you, if it was life back then, &gt;&gt; a year ago or 30 years ago or more, if it was life then, it's life tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I took it the other way, and I don't want to get on to it, but uh save it for Sunday, but there's people that have taken a turn or gone a certain direction, and they thought, "Oh, this is great." You know, I got a better opportunity. Things are things are going to go better for me. And, you know, I let go of my my my message beliefs. And, you know, it's a lot easier now and I can do this and I can do the other thing and so on so forth. that I don't go to church and maybe cut my hair or do whatever more. They don't realize that the thing that's motivating them now, his name is death. &gt;&gt; And he was death in the beginning &gt;&gt; and he's still death &gt;&gt; and it'll be death. It's only life or death. It's only Satan or God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I guess I'm I'm I'm just going to be short tonight, but I I will uh touch on this. Uh the scripture says, "While we look not," and you know the scripture well, "while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." And I want you to think about this and then be thinking about this until Sunday as well. The world that you and I look at the seen things what we see. I'm I think I consider myself a very positive person. I really do. And I consider you a positive people. But the things that are around us and the and the world that you rub shoulders with is a very negative place. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you say so? Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you walk down the street or you go to your place of work and when you see what you see and you hear what you hear, you see how people conduct themselves. You see how the world dresses. You see and hear the language that they use. You go to a shopping mall. You go to the service station, you go to pay your bill, there's all those magazines right in front of the cash desk. They put the worst of them right there. And then you you may be with your friends and you hear this and you hear that and you hear cursing and you hear crude language and you hear of this fight and you hear what this family's doing and you hear of this marriage breakup. You hear about these children. You hear about then you hear the news and you hear there's been this kind of disaster and this plane that crashed just this morning and 113 people are gone and they're all and not far from where Tony and Rebecca are right now. It's Armenian airplane. You just hear it every day. Every few minutes you just hear it. It just leaves you heavy. &gt;&gt; Leaves you heavy. It's a very very negative world. And the scripture says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen." Because if we look at the things that are seen, our lives are going to be motivated in the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with that thought. We'll be motivated very much in the wrong direction. and and uh brother Brandham said this. Do you know that the devil has a language? Did you know brother Brandham talked about the devil's language? &gt;&gt; I said the devil has a language. Oh, you're quiet. He said, now he said, "Now Paul here, uh, here of the valley or the shadow rather, the law, he's talking about the the law of the Old Testament being a shadow of good things to come. He could it could never make the worshipper perfect." Then he goes on to show what perfection is. Now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of uh so much thought of people they say okay you listening people say and no doubt we have said it at some time or another but that is speaking in tongues that God doesn't want you to speak in and that is he said people say, "Well, I'm weak. &gt;&gt; My faith is not very much. &gt;&gt; I'm not a very good Christian." He said, "That's just what the devil wants you to say, &gt;&gt; and you're just talking his language right now." &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "You mustn't never say that. Don't never let your testimony be negative. Let it be positive. &gt;&gt; Never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it. And when it starts, don't entertain it. &gt;&gt; If it does start, don't entertain a negative thought. Why? Because those negative thoughts will eventually motivate you in a negative direction. And you'll find yourself doing negative things and speaking negative things. And this just isn't positive thinking. This is God's word. God word God's word wants you to confess the truth. &gt;&gt; And negative never come from God. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that is his language right there. &gt;&gt; I'm not very good. I'm not a very good Christian. I'm weak. my faith is weak. And he said, you'll never live above your confession in works. Uh I do bear witness that message. He said this. He said, if that he said, now healing is not something that you just say, well, yeah, I believe it. I believe it. It's not that. Healing is not and whether it's healing, whether it's healing or or whatever it is, it doesn't make any difference. But he said it's not just saying, "Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, I believe it." It's more than that. Listen closely, friends. We're not We're not talking. This isn't kindergarten stuff. This is this is things that you can live by. &gt;&gt; You can put this into practice right now. &gt;&gt; He said, "And well, yeah, I believe it. I believe it." He said, "Now, that's all right." If you say, "Yeah, I believe it. I believe it." He said that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say yes I see it I believe that I accept it then if you accept it on those basis keep saying it &gt;&gt; over and over &gt;&gt; he said it out loud &gt;&gt; don't don't don't don't don't whisper it don't think it in your mind say it over and over I believe it. I believe it. Do you believe it? I accept it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it. Say it out loud. I believe it. And you keep saying it over and over until it becomes a reality to you. &gt;&gt; And that's how you defeat these negative things. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Say it out loud. Say it over and over. Just keep saying it. I'm healed. I'm healed." Say it until actually you believe it. And when you believe it, then it's going to take place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; And soon as you give that testimony, the high priest comes moving on the scene. &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise his name. How we thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. I believe it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; And if it's the very best you can do, just keep doing the best you can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, that's just the beginning. Being moved &gt;&gt; by the power &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; And being moved. I I I've just to close now. I'm just going to close. I've seen people and they get all enthused about something. And actually, they're not only enthused, they're confused because they're enthused about something. And I know in my heart, and I think deep down in their heart of hearts, they know it's wrong, too. &gt;&gt; They got enthused about it and actually feel anointed about it, but they know they're headed in the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know that it's death at work. And from there, it'll just deteriorate and it'll be worse. and a few months down the road there's some other catastrophe and on and on and on it goes. But oh, I tell you what, friends, if you start moving in the right direction, I just love it. I love I think a quote, I think brother Tom made it last Sunday morning that when you speak and you confess it, you're moving a mountain, a grain of sand at a time. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing. Brother Brandham saying the same thing. Say it. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Say it out loud. Say it over and over. Say it until you believe it. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And when you really believe it, it's going to happen." &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple? &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Do you know what? Don't stumble over the simplicity, friends. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon wasn't teaching a kindergarten class. He was teaching people how to have victory. &gt;&gt; He was teaching people how to crush Satan in their life. He was teaching how to have victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it'll work today, &gt;&gt; did it ever work in your life? &gt;&gt; Did it ever work in your life? &gt;&gt; It'll work tonight the same way. &gt;&gt; And back then you believed it. You believe it again right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll work. &gt;&gt; It'll absolutely work. &gt;&gt; And God's no respector person. Don't say, "Well, you know, I'm not, you know, brother Ed or some brother this brother that sister, they're real strong." Don't think that you're in the wrong direction. You're heading for a negative a heading downfall. But let the let the power of life motivate you. &gt;&gt; You know what that power of life wants you to do today, this evening, he wants you to keep saying it. &gt;&gt; He wants you to say it tomorrow morning. You wake up tomorrow morning and maybe before your feet hit the floor, say, "I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe this word. I believe this message has been sent to me. I believe everything has been made real to me. And I believe some things I don't understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe things he hasn't revealed to me yet. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what he reveals to me will be truth &gt;&gt; and truth will be life, &gt;&gt; eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I've been singing a song and I want to sing it. You help me find it. What was it, Brother John? Now I can forget, but you can't. 2547. I wrote it down. 2547. It's a a song I sang when I didn't understand it fully. My father would, you know, get us get up there and mother played a little pump organ. It was in a construction camp. And I remember them singing this song. I think they sang it almost every Sunday. Savior like a shepherd lead me. But oh, how we need him to lead us. And a blessed blessed words to this hymn. Amen. Let's let's stand as we sing it. And I I hope it'll be a real blessing to you. Savior, like a shepherd, lead us much we need thy tender care. Earth and thy pleasant pastures feed us. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, thou has thy blessed Jesus. Blessed Jesus thy we are. We are thy who thou be friend us in our way. Keep th from sin. Defend us. Jesus when we go astray. Blessed Jesus. Blessed Jesus. My children pray. Blessed Jesus. Blessed Jesus. Hear my children. And we'll sing the last verse. Let us seek thy favor. Early to thy will. Blessed Jesus. Blessed Jesus Christ. Blessed Jesus. Blessed Jesus. Thou has loved us. &gt;&gt; Savior, like a shepherd, lead us much. We need thy tender care. Before we do &gt;&gt; sweetly now, blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, thouast we are. Oh blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus. Thou has God bless you, sheep of his fold. Flock of God, the Bible calls you. The elect lady, Peter calls you. How blessed we are to feed in his flock, to feed in his pastures. And that last verse where we sang early let me I thought of you young people that are here tonight and you don't know how I respect you because there's multitudes very very few very few churches even within the message that has young people sitting across on the front seat filling all these seats. But I will tell you and remember maybe one day brother Ed is not here. Remember, remember what I'm saying to you. You will never regret these days when early you sought him. &gt;&gt; I'm a long ways down the road, but I sought him early in my life. In my early teens, in my later teens, it was all over then. Early will I seek him. You will never regret it. And God is preserving you many, many scars that others have had to bear because they didn't hear it and they didn't know it, but you do. God bless you, David. I'm going to ask you to come and dismiss us in prayer if you would please. God bless you and be praying for us for Sunday, will you? God bless you, brother David. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord God, once again, we've come to thy house of worship, Lord God. thy house of praise, Lord Jesus. Father, Lord God, we've come with with open hearts, Lord Jesus. And Father, we've received thy word, Lord God, with gentleness, Lord God, and meekness, Lord, Father. Once again, Lord, Father, you fed your sheep, Lord God. You've taken the man out of the way, Father. You've spoken through these mortal lips, Lord Jesus. Father, we heed thy word, Lord. And truly, we can say that we believe it, Lord Jesus. We keep confessing it, Lord God. Even though we don't believe it now, Father, we know, Father, according to thy word, Jesus, that we will believe it, Lord. For it's been prophesied about us, Lord God, in the days of old Lord, that there will be, Lord God, a bride without spot or wrinkle, Father. Here we stand, Lord Jesus, before thee, Lord God. We're testifying of it, Lord God. Father, we're pressing on, Lord. We're not looking at the world outside, Lord, but we're looking to you, Lord God, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Father, even now, Lord Jesus, as we just dismiss, Father, we pray that we do not dismiss from thy presence, Lord Jesus. That Father, you just confirm these words that you have spoken deep within our hearts, Lord. Father, that as we continue, Father, during the week, Lord Jesus, we continue to meditate upon these words, Father, that we come to that house once again on Sunday, the Lord will and Father, stronger, Lord Jesus, fortified with thy word, Lord God, and filled with your spirit, Lord. Father, looking forward to that day when you come and receive us once again. Bless thy people now, Lord, keep us safe in the way, Lord Jesus. Bless the pastor, Lord, Father, bless your ministers, Father, that take the burden of the word, Lord. Father, may we continue, Lord Jesus, just to bask in thy presence, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother David. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. God bless you all. How many heard of the earthquake in down in Tonga this morning? Very few. 8 point 8 point earthquake. Very very large earthquake. They said that there was a tsunami, a wave that was going to strike New Zealand and also Fiji. And Tom and Joanne had just gone to Fiji. And uh so we finally got a hold of them about between 4 and 5 this morning. And there was nobody in even in the lobby of the place where they are, the hotel or motel where it is. And uh so finally when people arrived there, I mean the staff arrived, he was actually instructing them and he said he said it was just amazing. He said he was reminded of when we were in China because he said it was like the message network that was working and and he was getting more information than anyone else down there. And then and the people were praying and concerned and and the management says, "Well, we'll move you to higher floors or we'll get you." And I just text them. And I says, you know, don't believe anybody. Just get to higher ground, you know, if that is the case. And uh here, you know, uh sister uh Sister Anne Zeller's mother's here, Sister Donaldson from New Zealand. And um you know, I know that they were in contact with uh uh saints back there. And there's a lot of saints in a lot of saints in Fiji, a lot of saints in the islands, a lot of saints in New Zealand. And here they said it would have hit New Zealand in 40 minutes. And turned out they said, you know, there was no tsunami &gt;&gt; from an 8-point earthquake. There was none. So we thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. Greet one another and be happy in Christ. And and remember to say it out loud. You're dismissed. God bless you. God bless you, brother. Love you back. Heat. Heat.
