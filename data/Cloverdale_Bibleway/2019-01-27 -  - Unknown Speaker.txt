========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you thank you thank you for your goodness Lord [Music] [Applause] and the light came down and the darkness could not abide pressed it back as it was in the beginning when God said let there be light there was darkness everywhere but the darkness had to go praise the Lord Amen brother Ricardo you have a testimony I'm not gonna guess it it just says testimony so I said well he must want to come and say it you mind praying for the congregation [Music] so this is something that I'm I promise Laurie I do when you're listening to and you're trying to be in tune with what God wants you to do it's not always easy right every single one of us have been there so I was listening to brother hydro digs and he was talking about collision and impact and I was listening to it for myself and I was thinking of my family and the different things that we've been through and but the cadre said many are in a collision but they don't get the impact of it it doesn't impact them and so he was a lot of young people had been there a lot of you adults have seen it and it spoke so strongly to me so part of me I was turning it up so my family could hear it because I want him to hear and uh and so through different parts of the country I'm going to cut through a part of the service where he said he says what would it be like if we were all crying out for God and he says what would it be like what kind of atmosphere could there be and so he said they do it in stadiums what does a stadium have over his people it's actually a ripoff don't get me wrong I've been in games before where I am cheering whether it's my children's teams okay so I want everybody here just to get out of themselves it's not about you it's not about me but it's about the Lord that we praise and who can stop that and what brother cadre says what would it be like if we said Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that's my lord I've done it myself when I've been walking but I said Lord I'll make this testimony for you so I was outside and I heard the service this morning and one my favorite our family's favorite songs is fourth man in the fire and it knocked me over when it was sung this morning so I was listening to that yesterday when we were working around the house and I was working in the barn and I don't remember it but I was working on it and the next thing I know my face is hitting a ladder and I'm falling down and I'm hitting the ground I don't know whether my family is hearing me and but I know I'm trying to let them know and something runs through your head and says maybe it's time I don't know if any of you ever been there but maybe it's time so in my mind I'm I feel like I'm calling out and then I hear I can't see everything's blurry I hear my son down it's voice and then I hear my wife I'm like okay good there's somebody here they rushed me in the house and I go any I was I had dirt all over me so it and cleaned up when I came back all of a sudden I knew there's something wrong there was something wrong and I looked at buck and I said something's wrong something's wrong so she starts calling 9-1-1 and i'm fighting for breath and i can't get enough breath so i said let's just go let's just go so we're in the van and we're taking off and we're tearing off brother Tom Frei and sister Kim happen to have some people over at their house and the kids that already start texting people mm in donek saying dad they're praying for you [Music] so that that touched me but I still thought well maybe it's time Lord so I started calling out for what mattered to me that was my son did your honor and my wife and then I'm not ashamed to say that I was calling out for him tell him to save him Dominic's talking to her brother Tom got the Thomas on speakerphone and everything he was saying I said I've heard this before I've already been here I heard this before and I'm tom brother tom I heard this we get to the hospital we go in I'm and I'm

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's not wonderful hey man we're looking to a wonderful time this evening to have our brother Danny Stephen come to preach and minister to us it's uh just going over in my mind and we talked about it yesterday I've known brother Danny since I got saved and I got saved when I was 21 so that's nine to forty years ago and brother Bisco I was a young man at the time and had the pleasure to travel with brother Bissell down to Ohio where he would have meetings and brother Browns barn and brother Brown would get all cleaned up and with shavings on the floor and he'd you know a little wagon and he put bales of hay there and brother Briscoe would minister of course being young in the Lord and I every service was for me didn't matter where I traveled and so I was all personal to me so if there was an altar call or a rededication I'm there I haven't changed and brother Danny was talking he says brother Tom I met you when I was seven years old at the altar here I was varied my face in the ground calling on God at 21 and here brother Danny was right beside me at 7 years old and I said to brother Danny today I said you're still here and I'm still here the gospel hold saints of God the gospel holds a man and I guess we're just fruits of your labor brother visible and I'm thankful for that what I heard this morning we want to welcome our brother Danny steamin pastor of House of fellowship Sarasota Florida he's got a great part in our hearts he's ministered to us at a family camp at winter camp and I just said tonight brother Danny just have your Liberty Minister the Word of God to us and that's what we've come to church for not to see one another but to hear Christ hear about Christ so as brother Danny gets ready to come and we'll sing I'm amazed and we'll stand I just got one more announcement I'd like to make a formal announcement brother Craig borer I've been away over the last little while and brother or a week ago or week money I guess it was a week ago it seems like a month ago but we wanted to announce to you that brother Craig Gore will be taking our summer camp this year he has agreed we're looking very forward to that and you'll be taking the senior camp services in August the 31st to August the 4th junior camp starts July the 28th 28th the 30th so we don't want to forget those dates we want to be preparing ourselves and praying for camp that God will just continue to move amen as we welcome our dear brother Danny's demon let's just sing the course I am amazed I'm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] music now I may me [Music] through your I found party [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah you may believe that this evening what a precious gift that we've been given amen amen well we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's a privilege to be here tonight I had come for the wedding and sister Karen and brother Levi and you know you just hope that when you come that you don't get a phone call or anything like that but it happened and what I want to say that it was such a privilege to be able to be in the service this morning and to listen to amen what our brother Edie preached on and I believe that a man with all my heart and I was thinking about what he said that he would you know since I set in the congregation he would like to if he comes to my church to set with his wife and I agree to that I get when you don't preach you can sit with your wife so a man so we'll figure that out later amen but a man but the Lord is good at name and we're so happy to be here we just appreciate each one of these ministers amen and for the for what they have meant to us down through the years and their friendship and their help and they've come through our way numerous times and ministered force and it's has certainly been a blessing and in our lives and brother tom was mentioning a little bit of the things that has happened that goes way back and we all have a testimony about how the Lord and how what he has done for us and and I can remember those things and David said one generation shall praise the Lord in his works to another generation I believe it's so important that the generation that has come before us and I believe brother ed has been faithful to do that is to say what God has done and what he has seen in his generation for the awareness of it is dying out and people no longer have a fear and a reverence of the supernatural and what God has done and and so therefore if they don't know God the scripture says if they don't know who he is they're leaving they're leaving and that's what's happening if her generations are rising up that don't know the god of Joshua and the elders that had seen the works of God and so we thank God that these things are not just kept alive by the testimony of a previous generation but we can see it in this generation amen and we are recipients of that how many believe that so I'm just excited what the Lord is doing for us and what I've seen him doing in our congregation and I know amen the testimonies we've heard of what God is doing here amen it's more than just a letter we we serve a God that is alive he's working in and through his body this is his work you are the answer to the devil's question hey man this is why the Prophet come and I just say it's a privilege to preach to you this evening so god bless you amen and we want you to turn in your Bibles if you will to first Timothy 1 a man maybe God helps me incorporate some some testimonies into the service if we can with the help of the Lord and also wanted to congratulate brother Tim bless you brother amen and we have certainly prayed for you and and I'm just so happy amen for our brother amen and there's a lot of planning going on I know that a lot of pre-planning isn't it and I know there's a lot of anxiety about well we sure hope it comes out as we plan you know what I found out with God is as we do the worrying but God always brings it just as he planned it and I want to say this to you and then this is kind of what along lines of Minister on is that we are pre-planned by God there might be a little bit of anxiety in your walk and and that but God knows and everything he's planned will come exactly the way he said it would hallelujah 1st Timothy 1 and 18 discharged I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as war a good warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some have him put away concerning faith amid shipwreck of whom is hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme man let's go to 4 Samuel 17 and we're start 38th verse saw armed David with his armor and put he put a helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with the coat of mail and David girded his sword upon his armor and he has said to go for he had not proved it and David said unto Saul I cannot go with these for I have not proved them and David put them off of him and he took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth Stones out of the brook and he put them in the Shepherd's bag which he had even in a strip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine and the Philistine came on and drew near unto David and the man that bare the shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistine said unto David am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistine said the David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said David to the Philistine thou comest to me with the sword and with the spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou has defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines as day into the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saith not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David that David Haye stood and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine you can be seated may God bless the reading of his word I know that that this story is a familiar story for from from little fellas all the way up and but I just felt on my heart to to preach on this the only only leadership I could get for this time so you know as any Minister knows it yes you're scary to preach without leadership so that's just what I'm gonna do and this evening I want to title this run to the battle run to the battle and I want to I want to read some things the prophet of God said about this event and and in our place that we have in our day for Paul's told timothy he said war by the prophecies that's been prophesied of thee and Timothy had been told by Paul that what he saw in him was what he had saw in his grandmother Lois and in his mother Eunice and he said I'm persuaded that the same faith is in thee and so Paul is encouraging him by by the word that he has preached by the prophecy that has been given of him he says you take that and in your warfare this is what you used to fight your warfare and so in thinking of this and brother Branham said that in every age he does by the same method he takes booty verse and in order to have believers to meet the word he's got to protest innate it to that age he said he's got to predestinate the thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age how many know that we have a challenge today amen he said did it get you did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated this by his foreknowledge and when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen just as much as a prophet had to calm a children had to hear the word and have their hearts turned back to the faith of the fathers amen he said it's got to happen and when he come over and predestinate s-- anything to happen in his word he has to prove his word to be so when he predestinate s-- anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there at that time so he predestinated a bride she's going to be there there is going to be a rapture she's going to be there let it sink into your heart there's a rapture on you are here and so I would ask you why are you hearing what you're hearing tonight why are you hearing the message that you're hearing tonight why does it fit you why do you recognize what you see amen when the world is rejoicing in their ecumenical moves and the consolidation of church and and everybody's coming together let's forget doctrine let's sort it out up there and let's just all get together and love one another why do you see what you see why does the voice of the Prophet have more of a pull to you then the Pentecostal move then the catholic moves something had to be pre-planned something had to be thought out brother madam said that if you're a son or daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew a bet in time you'd be planted so now you're made a preacher a son of God a manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God he said you were predestinated to meet the challenge of the hour and vindicate the true and living God can I say that again you we're predestinated you how many use do we have here you are predestinated to meet the challenge of the hour and true and prove that god is that true Bob how's that gonna happen that's right you were done there before the foundation of the world he wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it if you weren't chose that way again he said in the rising of the Sun the word before the foundation of the world the word to the word the word predestinated to the word or written for the hour you have them both coming together the word predestinated amen coming to the word written for the hour Amen you realize your position the seat of God will hunt for that position so then I want to say this God pre-planned your tummy he pre-planned that you would be here he knew it bad he knew what time he knew an hour and he knew what challenge I want you to notice now as we go back to David for just a minute a min with David we see that David is coming on the scene in the time of a failed kingship he's coming on the scene in a time of a failed priesthood is that right he's coming on a time when Saul who had been a man of God who had been anointed captain of the Lord's inheritance amen to continue the work that he had started with Samson to drive out the enemy the Philistines and and bring him under their feet who were the Philistines Philistines were the heart the robbers of the harvest that every time a child of God came in with the blessing of Abraham will begin to bring the seed to harvest the enemy would wait until it comes up to its growth and then he would come in and he would take it from him now why was that they had Garrison's all out through the land and they allowed the people to work the crop but they made sure that the people didn't have any weapons they make sure that they was gonna sharpen their tools they had to go down to Philistia to get their toes sharpened they made sure that they didn't have a see a sword so they had no way to fight off the enemy when he would come in against him and here's a people of Abraham with the blessing of God unable to stop the enemy from taking their harvest so if they wanted their children they would come in if they wanted their family they would come in they couldn't stop it man God had some men of God by the name of Jonathan who didn't have the good sense to listen to his daddy a man who wonder the revival of God and I didn't mean that I meant that he didn't have the good sense to listen to his daddy you understand what I meant because by this time his dad is back slit his dad is back slit he's not able to go all the way with the profit of the hour hey man and yet he loves the move of God hey man he can prophesy he can do this he can do that are you with me but he can't go all the way with the Word of God a member saw the enemy has come in and they they've subdued and they put they've run off the chill of his or the heightening caves and Den's but Jonathan he gets a revelation that God was with him that he was a child of Abraham and that he had a right to face that enemy see if tonight if all I can do is encourage your faith tonight to move out on every promise of God that you don't have to wait to the let the devil dictate to you your harvest but you can move out by faith come on you can move out by faith in there come another day I mean there was a great battle going on amen and saw backslidden preacher Amen had made an oath he said no man shall eat while they're fighting the battle here's a man II don't understand the importance of getting into the Word of God he don't understand the importance of knowing what God is saying for your day so he say now you go fight this battle without eating the word don't without eating the food come on church that's just what the devil wants you to do you make up your something tonight you don't half the problem of congregation is they just don't eat they just don't feed upon the words they don't know and a prophet is saying in this house and so when a man comes on Sidonie just fight how you're gonna fight if you don't have no strength and Jonathan hasn't heard his dad's oath he went and he saw some honey better there's dripping he took his staff he laid it over there and he dipped it in and he put it to his mouth and the Bible said his eyes were enlightened do you know his dad wanted to kill him for that wanted to destroy him in the people of God rose up and said you know what if it hadn't been for John Jonathan this battle wouldn't even been won you know if you want to revival if you want to move of God you gotta step out your daddy won't go your mama won't go you gotta step out and say I'm gonna eat on this because I know that in this is the strength I need this is the kind of scene we've come into and time time God got fed up with this for this this our kingship and he removed him from that seat in his eyes Saul is no longer the king in man's eyes Saul is still the king but the prophet of God is commissioned by him with a prophecy I want you to go down to Bethlehem to the house of Jesse for I have provided a king among those say his sons this is the prophecy going out now in God's eyes he said I have rejected that King not in man's eyes so Saul goes down there amen and as he goes into this meeting he asked for Jesse to bring his sons out his sons come out him in the discernment begins and they all begin to pass through discernment and as everyone passes through God says that's not him that's not him that's not him that's not him and it went on down to seven of them and he looks and there's nobody left and he looks and he asked Judge Jesse said don't you have any more and he says I got one more ease out on the field he says we'll go get him we can't do anything we can't even go eat until this man comes so this boy this man dis David he wasn't even invited the meeting he wasn't there he wasn't thought off he wasn't thought of to be aiming the one that the prophecy had fallen upon and it hasn't been revealed yet but yet David has been chosen of God Amon before saw Samuel has ever had received the prophecy de David has been chosen of God to reveal further the revelation that he gave in Eden What did he say anything he said the woman seed shall bruise the head of the serpent but that's all he said he never said anything further amen but then as it goes on he begin to bring more light upon that revelation Amen as he ages progressed he brought more light and then he said I'll bring that through Abraham's seed and as it goes on now it's coming down to David's time it's still the same revelation but it's just God unveiling predestination as you just bring it out this is who the woman seat is this is where you're come from this is who I use this is what he'll do and how did he announce that he announced it through the ministry of a prophet once you know this is the last major thing this is the last major thing that this prophet Samuel is going to do is to anoint this man King hey minions are in there in the house they bring David for God has said amen don't look on their outward appearance for I don't choose man behind I look but I look upon the heart they may be weights in the heart with a CD is well let me tell you something folks by outward appearance the majority of you would have never come close a man in fact him in the first invitation that went out was not to you hallelujah the first invitation that we thought was not to you but they receive that invitation and they would not a man go but they with one consent begin to make excuse and when the servant and brother Benham stresses the servant came back to the to the master and said they have refused it then he said go get the sick the lame the heart it's unveiling more this is not my chance its unveiling more of God's predestinated plan and the serving comes back and he said they come in but yet there's room there's room and then he said well go into the hedges go into the highways and this is the move of God this is what he's doing right now he's moving out in the sweep allelujah hope you don't mind if I'm myself tonight I gotta act like I'm at home where the Sun shines hey man hallelujah hey man there's a sweetheart yes brother madam said the move is on for the bride hey man let me just stop them in and talk about the move of God and I've been hearing the testimony no brother John is probably on the most faithful ministers and the message to send out testimonies on the phone I'm getting them with regularity and I appreciate that payment so I know you you don't know me I know you Amen but I want to tell you as well and in honor me I know how God dealt in my life I know I know as I look back through my life it had to be the plan of God he could not be by chance you know brother disco was talking about my dad this morning and how much he hated the mess one day he hated the message a lot more than what you heard I got a lot of memories from my dad at a young age screaming at my mother telling my mother we're leaving if you keep believing this we are leaving this thing telling us don't believe what mama what your mama believes rise too young to understand what he meant by then sir I just believed what mama believed anyhow Amy said don't you believe that take us to his church we'd go to hers that's where we first set met brother Bisco he looked a lot different than I did too hey man then were the days I still stood on this on the seat to listen to church I was that young hey man is just a small church but those seeds that God was planting and I want to tell you anybody in here that's on the fence right now with your family and your relationships and you're thinking well maybe if I just compromise just a little bit cuz love will win them back I want you to know that's a lie that kind of love will not win them back that kind of love will send them to hell [Applause] hey man 10 years of this one on brother God used by the Disco's ministry and his wife amens if to be a great encouragement to my mother in that hour amen we come into this message because my grandmother even worked for a man by the name of Bill now you've heard of him many times on the tapes and then they went down and and and I can say this is what brother Briscoe talked about this morning and the message this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears my grandmother was there and she told me says Danny the Spirit of the Lord was so strong in that place if he had said get down on the floor and rolled down the aisle every one of us would have done it but you know that's not what God asked you to do didn't ask you to roll across the floor but what it is God left eyewitnesses and I begin to look begin to see him in the vindication of a living epistle not a tweet not a blog not somebody who's never tasted the word of the Lord but see that it's good but somebody that's been in the presence of the Almighty the strip's in the home got so strong my mother went to my grandma's and mom are you sure this is right because my daddy's persecute him I say persecuted he's really persecuting finds her books that she has hid and goes dump them in the river takes your clothes throws them in the yard make sure walk through a blizzard a couple miles and stand on the side of the road to go to wonder brother bicycles meetings many years ago stand there in a blizzard and wait to be picked up said of brother brems in heaven I don't want to go now that is a foolish statement because i'ma tell you this if the Pope goes to heaven I want to go because that means he's been saved hey man but you know but he said romance never I don't want to go moved her all over the country California bought land in New Mexico we still got it still paying taxes as far as I know I went to Florida I was born there moved back to have went on and on and on 10 years of this and they come down to the point that my mother's uncle was going to be baptized a man and and and she went ask permission of daddy if she could go and he said I'll tell you what this is it if you go when you get back I'm gone in the children of God I'm finished with it and that's where she made her stand she said well I'm gonna go anyhow now I never took from that that my mother didn't love me but I took from that that you had to love the word more than any other relationship and when she made that stand I'm not gonna go that's when God dropped down that's when her work finished and God took over how will they tell you I won't encourage you if you're in a fractured place I want to encourage you our God is faithful but he's just watching you to see how much you love him that's what changed his life that's what turned him around because when the rubber myth the myth the road and then he really got put to the test are you gonna really leave now the test is on now the challenge of the hours here he begin to turn around like this we begin the ball and he didn't know what to do and he fight for us well I'll take him and when he took her a week later he was baptized that's what God is doing that's how God moves man I want to show you how he moved he did not move with a quote she did not approach to him and say well brother branham said because that wasn't gonna work she had to be the voice of the message and Satan wants to drag you into a debate he's the greatest Sophos that's ever been he wants it just to be I listen to you to try to refute what you're gonna tell me he wants to drag this message down into a bait into an argument and to try oh you gotta vindicate the message you don't have to vindicate nothing [Applause] why do I want to prove to the devil what is right I am the answer to the devil's question for what he has done in me I have been quickened from death unto life [Applause] there's life in me brother Peter where you asked stand up I love this man I love what the Lord is doing in their family he's a great move going on back home with his family and I thank God for it but you know brother Peter he'd visit us here just recently so he's out fishing trying to catch the big big fish it never happened we caught a lot of small ones but anyway we're out there trying to stand up brother Peter I told you to stand up hey man so brother Peter he's over there fishing he's not moving he's got this brown hat on so he looks like a post he's not moving and I'm watching and and there's his bird comes big seagal comes flying and he's not moving he's just fishing and so I'm thinking well what this bird must be thinking he's lookin says well that looks just like a post so he fly he comes and he lands on his head a minute soon when he lands on his head I holler I said there's a bird landing on your head and when I yelled that he went like this life came into the body and when that bird realized there wasn't a post he just wouldn't dope off into the lawn just laid there and looked real puzzled he said John if you notice he said that bird flew over but I didn't let him build a nest I want to tell you what the devil will come to you to see if there's any life in there there has to be life in the body to reject the devil's poison [Applause] [Music] my brother branham said Amen that when David Amon comes before that prophet the Prophet anoints him he said right there Amen when God when that oil is poured over him he said he poured the whole horn it means he didn't take a little rag and squeeze out a little drop on you young people but he took the whole horn and unsparingly pulling it out he said which was a type of his Holy Spirit so in the mind of God right there he had been called he had been placed as king he had been filled with the Holy Spirit and positionally places King in the mind of God not in the mind of men that had to be unveiled before them but in God's mind it's done it's finished because this is his vision and now his vision has left his mind come to the mouth of the Prophet and through that transition of from the mind of God through the prophet let me tell you there's never been another hour where a man could stand behind the desk today I'm gonna take my text and it's going to be the entire Bible and I'm gonna tell you what has been in the back part of God's mind before the world began Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't do that it wasn't there our but in this Harry said I will restore [Music] [Applause] amen but he's gotta use people to manifest what that prophet hath spoke I'm brother Bentham he compares this time of David when he goes out to meet this giant he compares this time one place he does to the mind where he said there's a mutual meeting ground said God had to have a place you know I didn't Satan had to have a place where they could meet and so he compares this battle to that time sit to your mind another place and why Christ speak he refers to this moment and says that if there's ever a time that man should speak it's now as he's referring to what David is doing and we see a man that when David comes out and he's going down to the battle notice he's the last of the brothers he's the last in line he's the one that is anointed he's not even invited to the battle so he's going out there not the fight he's going out there to feed his brothers because his brothers are the Warriors saws the king and they're going to fight but we find with our Bible that it says they were sitting there for forty days with nothing going on nobody was making a move because the challenges went forth and it has stopped the children of Abraham dead in their tracks and they're afraid to go further now this is what what you see the difference between an intellectual conception and somebody's been anointed by a prophet do you hear me this is the difference between an intellectual conception because I tell you if you set 40 days in a tent and listen to what that devil is telling you pretty soon you're going to be scrutinizing every stone every tree you're going to find the excuses for every bit of thing that's going on you're going to be looking at every situation is that cloudy is it raining if you're here it's raining if it's this if it's that and you're gonna have all kinds of excuses why not to go down there and fight that battle but the difference between a man that's an anointed man and a man that's not anointed as soon as he hears the devil's challenge he's not looking at the circumstance he's looking at the rewards [Applause] Louie if I could just encourage your faith to smart this evening as children of God to know that if if your life is clear and you stand before God with the clear record Amen the devil stands before you today has a defeated person amen hey man is this alright yes let me go just a little bit further here now just to say this again brother madam said that you are not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire how many know that you've been wondering about that poll in your life and what it is there it is it wasn't your desire first it was his desire that's why you came so he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first he was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian that's Scripture you know that's how we operate that's why a prophet came we had a situation in our church here a while back a lady had visited so she said in the congregation in the pre service and she's reading some of the tracks that we have out back and the one track she happen to pick up was serpent seed and so she's reading that and next thing we know she jumps up and she runs out of the church and she disappears we're in the country we're not in the city there and we're on a highway so obviously we're concerned she's disappeared she's not on the church grounds she's left and she's gone and so we go out and we begin searching we're up and down the roads we can't find her eventually I saw a lane that went up in the woods so I began to follow that lane it was somebody's house as a private Lane she's way up there by the house and so I go over and I just warn her of the dangers of leaving home without somebody and if we're bringing her back and she begins to tell me says you know what somebody needs to expose this church you tell them about the false doctrine that's in there and how you're caught and how you follow a man and all this has gone on so I'm just trying to bring her down from the boiling point and just get her down here so I said well why don't we just go under the pavilion and just talk a little bit and she's just raging she's raging at me he says somebody needs to to to expose this Church for what it is and she's praying like this against the church and I said listen lady so I want a something says my daddy was just like you she hated this message and she goes well bless his heart and I said and he's the one that built this church that says why don't we go into the pavilion and talk let's just talk about the word and so I sit there and I begin to talk to her and so she wanted to talk about the word so I just begin to take the scripture and just begin to talk about it and Vista she got angry again she goes I know where you're getting that I said I'm just quoting scripture to you yes but I know why you're getting it I says well what do you mean you're getting that from william branham I said thank you you have just given him the greatest compliment you could give him that that's the purpose of a prophet to turn the people back to the word that's the vindication and so if you don't have no answer you just had no way you're getting it hallelujah so David is coming on the scene at the time that Saul is a backslidden manis refused to go all the way with what the prophet of said so God said I have a man after my own heart not a man that wouldn't backslide that's not what he said but a man after my own heart a man that will fully follow me and this is what God is doing he is raising up a people in this hour whose eyes will be single and fully follow him why is this oh sitting here at this confrontation and not doing anything it's because of a failed priesthood because of a failed kingship and they can't go any further that's why God sent a prophet to anoint of people that would be outside of a denominational system and they would be anointed amen to accept what Eve turned down in the beginning what did Eve turned down that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever people I look across the room and I see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever bearing the fruits of eternity the commandment of Moses in the book of Deuteronomy says when you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more than now don't be afraid of them for the Lord that God is with thee which brought thee out of the land of Egypt so remember the same God that was back there in the age of campaign will be with you up here in this campaign and it shall be that when you come nigh into battle that the priest shall approach and speak into the people and shall say unto them hear o Israel you approach this day in the battle against your enemies don't let your hearts faint fear not do not tremble do not be terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you this is what the priesthood is supposed to do this is what they're supposed to encourage the people of God in take the word of the Prophet and speak to the people that God is still here that God has not left them that you do not have to be afraid of the Giants of your hour because God is more and mightier than them and he's going to use you to prove it he's going to use you to prove it so there's a challenger a challengers come out the Bible says he's disdained David when he looked at him he disdained it what was he disdaining he was disdaining what the Prophet anointed he was disdaining the move of the hour he was disdaining the revival when he looked at David he did not see a revival he looked at his size he did not look at the majority he looked at his size are you with me amen and because of his size because of what he looked like that can't be the move of God these people don't know what they're done they've lost it how can this be a move of God what's so special about you well I hear God is saving people a university so what people out of university get saved all the time really that's one to chew over those they sure don't I I know if people going in and getting brain Washington leaving but to get saved out of it is another story and you in the university ought to thank God that God reaches where you're at let me give you another testimony the testimony my mother talked about how she stood and she wouldn't move and just kept believing we have a sister in our congregation that I can remember as a little boy we would go and visit them on the on the East Coast and and she believed the message and she had real small children and and her husband was a real unbeliever it was a Vietnam vet hooked on nicotine since he was age of eighteen chain-smoker one after the other hated the message and treated his children rough and so she stood and she stood and this has been year she just kept standing and standing her children they grew up they got to an age where they could get out of the home and they just went into the world the boy come hooked on drugs he's hooked on drugs for fifteen years and you know how it is when somebody sucked on drugs are getting saved every week until you if you don't hate that thing enough to say I'm gonna die it's staying there you got to get serious with God and so she just kept praying for her children asking God coming up for prayer praying for her children asking God's and this boy's left since the age of 20 he's been gone 15 years now he's in his middle 30s this has all just been recent she's been standing and standing standing her husband's not safe her son's a drug addict her other daughters in the world she has one daughter serving God married a boy in the church so she just kept asking for prayer kept holding on kept holding on the boy he'd come to church come to church he'd get saved go back go back slide again you know how it is one day that boy got serious he went out of his house at one o'clock in the morning went on the back porch and he got down on his knees and he told God he said God if you don't come down and do a work of my life here he said I am NOT gonna leave here until you do it he said I heard what you've been telling me over the pulpit that I need to die - what a half he said and I begin to pray like this and he said as I begin to praise that something begin to rise up in me like a sickness begin to come up and mean I begin to feel like I had to throw and just as the spirits begin to rise up like this he said the door to the neighbor's house opened up and a party broke out on the back porch of the neighbor's house and they're streaming and they're going on and I'm sitting in this thing is coming up and I'm asking God Lord let it go I want to die to Who I am and he said this thing he said all of a sudden he said the peace of God after about two hours is dropped he said when it dropped on me the party quit and they went back in the house now this is what he just told me recently he said it wasn't God deliver me of drugs he said I've been hooked on pornography since I was 4 years old I was introduced to it my friends in the world and never got that image out of my mind but when that thing left it was that thing right there that had him hooked to everything else and when he got desperate with God God came down the party was over hey mater but that's not all God delivered him then he comes up and he stands with his wife and he said listen he said my wife has this she's just been diagnosed with the deadly disease and you know and we weren't prepped for it I won't even mention what it is here but a disease is that it ends in death that's a ha say they made a wasn't chickenpox during this time the daddy who's been hooked on nicotine for forty five years he comes and he gets delivered 45 years hey man you know the devil don't like me to testify about this on the same ladder 45 years a man hooked on chain-smoking can't be set free now he just wanders around the church looking for people to hug brothers amen and and tell him how much he loves him [Applause] and he comes up to me the other day brother and on the platform he walks up to me said you said everything is all about me it's all about me what is it God was revealing to him who he was what Betty had been planted in [Music] [Applause] brother Michael now in the miracles begin to move brother Michael brought his daughter up for prayer and I noticed as I'm praying I'm like this I felt another hand come over my hand and I looked and there here it is as daddy has come up put both hands around him and he's praying and I just heard Friday as I come into Seattle Friday that the woman that the wife has been declared totally free [Applause] hey man I want to tell you here tonight there is not a situation in this room that our God hasn't already defeated we are facing at the feet at being today are you with me undefeated B and you tonight are proof that he's defeated I say man hallelujah you are proof you have the answer [Applause] I hope that's alright I'm just excited what God's doing down there I know God's doing something here hallelujah God said I will have a living epistle hallelujah you can have your debate you can have your question this has been settled you take these people they've been born out of this you think that worried about bridges and everything else [Music] the revelation they have they're not worried about a bridge in Jeffersonville the revelation they have is the breach has been crossed whereas they once were aliens now they've been brought back now they're called sons and daughters of God now they're walking and freedom you can have that tonight amen I want to bring one more point to you what did David do why did he do what he did when he went down into the valley who could be so insane to go down into the valley without any natural armor without any natural weapon what was in his mind I'll tell you what was their brother venom said that boy didn't even pray about the situation he didn't have to see if it was the will of God or not he didn't have to wonder but the man said God had prayed him through from before the foundation of the world which means this was not an accidental battle it was a predestinated challenge [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's in his mind then godson a profit that profit anointed me Amen and I know that I go down it then I look at that enemy that the whole army of Israel hasn't been able to move for forty days and brother Bantam said this and I want you to listen real close he said it's not how long you make the battle linger he said that you stop it dad right now you might say here can I say well I've been battling lust I've been battling depression I've been let me tell you realize it's over [Applause] David looked down there and he saw this great child a champion from his youth a man that's never been defeated and he don't see that he sees brass he sees a man covered from head to toe in judgment he sees Amanda has no chance [Music] [Applause] I said a man that has no chance not tell you anybody in here that's bound tonight if you would have 20 believe it doesn't have a chance [Applause] [Music] those things become unpopular now we're not supposed to talk like that anymore and that's the problem that's why churches are dying because a life is moving you know what brother BAM says you know my dad went to one message one brother Briscoe some about how he went to 30 my dad went to one it was how can I overcome you know what he did slept the whole service because he was still a Mennonite then so he just slept do you know what he missed in that service when he was there I know he heard it later on tape as my dad was an avid tape listener he said to overcome is to keep life in you is to keep life in you and he used the examples that I walked across with log the other day it looked like it was alive he said had the branches everything he said but it was rotted it was laying right in water he says just like a believer here lay right in the stream of life but if there's no life in there here rot twice as quick that's what's happening that's what they the rotten is what they call liberation the first thing they do is they go out they want to cut their hair they want to go do this I want to go yeah we're liberated you're legalists I'm not a legalist I do it because I love God I do it because he told me to be separate [Applause] [Music] hallelujah so he said it's to keep life in you that's the challenge in this house that's the secret of David when he come to the battle he came fin up he came set up and as soon as he heard the devil challenge he was ready amen and so I would ask you today the greatest thing you could pray for said God let me hunger you talked about fervency this morning let me hunger for the things of God for in that is my strength to fly a bulge David had the nerve to say because you have challenged the armies of the Living God and I'm going to speak for these people up there that aren't moving because you have challenged the armies of the Living God today I'll cut your head off and he looked at him and he disdained the move of God and he said there's no way that this can happen by you you are not the one that is called for this hour you're not up to my level of competition and David said you know what only to say this what what what the Giants saw did not make the night make him go right out his last will and testament so don't get all shook up because somebody out there won't believe what God is doing here he looked at him he said I'm a dog and my dog that you come out to me with staves I want you to know David didn't even go into the valley with stones he came with no ammunition but he saw the brook out there and he knew that in a brook there be stones he's not worried about it you know the devil always misses what God is doing do you think do you really think that one day here is a mule or a donkey he's out in the wind he's walking along and he staggers and he falls over and he dies do you really think the devil looked at that and said now there is a weapon of mass destruction we need to get somebody to come and clean that thing up because one day there be a child of God walk by here and have enough faith to grab what's left of that thing and he's going to go kill a thousand four listings with what's left now I say that's how God does it God allowed that thing to die just like he allowed that mountain range to be formed that when the Prophet is driving by he said look there I give you an everlasting sign God had put it there for him he had pre-planned his coming so when when but you know why you know why you know why the Felicity never saw it for what it was I had no inspiration inspiration is what shows that it's there and when Samson standing there inspiration comes upon him because the enemy has shouted inspiration and remember this is the beginning of the work against the Philistines this is the beginning amen and inspiration comes upon him that the ropes melt away and he looks and he says there it is a WMD and it picked it up and it against the swing and a thousand men died the rest are hiding and here's Sampson with the bone y'all want some of this come on out of those rocks I got more of it that's what brother Balaam said he did that's what inspiration will do huh don't need much to take a devil down he oh he needs it's another jawbone and jawbone is speaking right now I see if you would take the words that are coming out you too can drive it enemy out of your life so when David goes down listen David he strands here he looks at the enemy and the enemy looks at him they made their words they said what they is gonna say but there came a time and words are finished now it had to be left and David didn't go down there and dodge and look around and say does he see me you understand David was fighting two men he wasn't just fighting a giant his giant was so big he had somebody to carry his shield the Bible says nothing about that armor bare so I reckon he probably ran hallelujah it's just like we know these little little buddy Devils like to hang around to see what its gonna do when when the big do goes down then they go hey hey man the Bible says David ran to the battle he ran to the Philistine he knew what he had in his life let me just encourage you this evening aiming not to back up from the battle but you run to the battle because you know the god that you have with you same God that deliver man 45 years hooked on nicotine the same God that will deliver a woman with a deadly disease a same God that a deliverer a man that's a drug addict the same God a man has taken this one and taken this one this is what the devil has disdained but this is the hedges and the highways and I want to say that's the last move that's the last move then he say the place is full the harvest is ready it's going home time I wonder how many more David's we got in the room I said today I'm going to go out I'm gonna run to that panel I know that god I have is more than enough I hope this ain't too Pentecostal brother and I've never been a Pentecostal though and they'll make no excuses for you folks that don't like it hallelujah but I have tasted and saw a man that the Lord is good and I know what God has done in my family and in my life and I'm so thankful to say I know that it was God on my trail it was gone all the time can I make a statement here my son a little arrogant but you just taking any way you want to I had have been pre-planned by God you see before you the plan of God well no brother Dan you're trying to set yourself up make yourselves nothing no not at all I'm just part of you the body of Christ is the pre-planned design of God that he would come down and live in her and it would come to a showdown and he would not back down in that body just like he never backed down in that body and Jesus in that body in his first coming when he walked out there to a maniac that maniac came down listen let me just tell you how powerless the enemy is to stop a predestinated seed he was called Legion that wasn't his name but he was represented by The Devil's that he had anything like today you would call him gamer something along that line you get the drift digital whatever you know I saw brother Ed losing track of his notes and made me realize that my daddy did that and you know I got an iPad I still lose track of mine I have a digital mess Amen God in his body and here is a man by the name of Legion comes down with over a thousand demons because this is a legion he comes down they can't stop him it isn't one isn't two it's a legion and he comes down and he falls there and here brother BAM said is a little bitty man standing there and those demons recognize what's anymore [Music] and they begin to scream out I love this what are you doing in that little bitty body you see Goliath never recognized that that boy had been anointed by a prophet and the Bible said the Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day he didn't see him he saw the boy and these demons are recognizing Jesus for who he is and said you have come to torment us can I give another testimony I was in Mexico a while back and I had a brother come to me a minister there and begin to tell me about an old old Mexican preacher who just really had had believed in divine healing and just had a real gift of faith in his life he pray for people in one day he's praying for this girl and she's demon-possessed and the demon speaks out of this girl in a man's voice and says she is mine and nothing you can do will make me come out of her he said I didn't know what to do said so I all of a sudden inspiration came and he went and got a book of the Prophet now you're not going to find this on the websites just so you know a man he found a book of the Prophet that had a picture of him and she he brought it back to this girl and he opened it up to the picture now this is gonna really seem fanatic if it blows your mind good and he held up and he spoke to the girl said do you recognize this man and that demon spoke out and says yes I was thrown out of one of his meetings in Arkansas and so this little Mexican preacher stood up and said then in the name of Jesus Christ who William Branham preached and the woman was delivered now the intellectuals will say there's nowhere in the Bible by anybody held up a book and showed a picture you're right there wasn't I sorry about that but there is somewhere in the Bible amen where there was a deem of the demon in attack seven man because they didn't have the life of Jesus Christ and they says Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you but so I tell you as an anointed son of God that if you have been filled with his spirit the devil knows exactly who you are he knows why you're here and he is trembling before you for the Dominion that is in force right now is the dominion over sin the flesh and the devil how many believe that I said how many believe that then I want to read you about four more quotes and we're done because you believe it hallelujah hey man I'm so glad to know that they God I served tonight is alive they don't seem much to people but I've seen him hey man I've seen him now whether brother Edie had a word this morning by the name of mixture II and I'm gonna use one at all right and that's the word nook this is not another word you're finding the Webster dictionary relevance and I'm beginning to feel religious he said the law of life is in us he says you are made and born and placed in the body of Christ as sons and daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil we have got a law and that's the law of the Holy Spirit and the only thing you have to know and have to do is to know how to let go and let God that's one you don't have to knock and the devil tells you anything you don't have to knock down to him the next time he comes to you says I'm not knocking down to you and if he says what does that mean just go to read what the prophet said about it hallelujah brother Bentham said that when Sampson come out there's a little curly-haired shrimp the lion comes to him and he's a little drawer from and like every man is without God and he was a weakling him but all at once when the lion come to get him the hidden power in him came out and slew it like a lamb but was it the hidden power that is there comes out amen hey man so that this is important for us to realize I'm talking to you about the attitude that David had when he went down to meet the Giant he knew why he was there hallelujah hey man all right just bear with me brother branham said said we can take the word we believe the word we know that it's true he said but for the majority of the people it hasn't become a reality he said if we stand here tonight and say that we believe that Jesus Christ died for us that his blood has washed us from ever since then also we must believe that we have become the very righteousness of God he said if you cannot believe that you become the very rights of God neither can you believe that the blood has made atonement for you he said for the majority of the people it's not real so what do we do if revelation is above you you look up and you ask God for it God reveals to me this reality of the word so that I can run to the battle Amen hallelujah Amen okay here brother BAM said this Satan to G he said Jesus said if you can believe he said all things are possible and he looks down he said that an Indian woman sitting out here she has her head down prayin and she's got a comb in her hair the angel the Lord that light hangs over the woman she's suffering with hayfever that's right Indian lady Jesus Christ makes you whole there's your friend next to you another Indian woman she's suffering with the head trouble put your hand over on her too that she may be well also raise up your hand here lady receive your healing through Jesus Christ the Son of God he said there it goes healed a dark streak of blackness leaving movie now something white shoving it how was it activated because you believed again he meant Satan told you you were going to lose your mind your mental nervous person and he says you won't leave you're gonna lose your mind if you don't get over but he lied to you that little lady sitting there second one in the back right here she's bothered with nervousness - is that right lady see what I mean this demon knows if that woman will halfway believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God and I miss prophet it'll have to leave her and that demon was calling for help for help to accumulate unbelief now this is what's happening demons are calling for help to accumulate unbelief there even put this out of people who don't believe will let me be on the other list that's the list you talked about the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] [Music] unbelief is accumulating and demons are calling for help but faith is gathering I wonder what's happening in the room right now oh if I could just say this that faith is gathering demons are calling do you know what it means when demons begin to cry out that means they lost their hold that means the end is near somebody help me somebody help me somebody help me no you get out of here I bind every spirit in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of the kingdom of God that's the rights that's the rights of a child of God [Music] how could it be I said how could it be that a little beaten down woman a prostitute she never saw the cloud she never saw the red she open she never saw the mana come down she never said saw them the cloud on top of the mountain she saw none of it she only heard a message and said I believe what I have heard now I want to token from it I'm talking if there's any child of God no matter how low they are they ask for a token got a sound give it to you this is why it's not red but they gave her a red token she said if you hang it out here you leave it out here and you go get your family and bring them in your house will be saved I don't know brother Tom what why would God have confidence in a prostitute just give a message I'll tell you why because God had given her a token and he believed in his token enough and when those messengers go back to Joshua and they begin to say what they have done brother Bentham said Joshua said that's what I sent you to do amen and so Joshua had sent those messages to see if anybody in that defeated city would have enough thought about him to ask for a token she wasn't interested in going back and cut her hair she won the interested in seeing how close to the world she lived she wanted a token God said I believe so much in my token you go out and be the voice of it you little lady you little lady you go out and be the voice of that token and here's a little prostitute now you come in you come in and they believed her [Applause] Joshua they crossed over the move of God was on it was transitioning time the walls were getting ready to come down and Joshua said I'm gonna go scout out and brother BAM said he's out there close to the walls close to where that woman's house is and he looks and there's a man with a drawn sword do you know what a drawn sword means it means if you get a little closer you're in trouble this is action now where is he standing I'll tell you where he's standing he's standing where that token is and he tells Joshua the ground you're on is holy ground what made that ground holy what made that place holy a woman believes the Word of God so much that he himself would come down hey man I'm ready to deliver her hey man I'm ready to deliver her of the city I'm ready to deliver her of her past I'm ready to deliver it of all and that worked under the blood of bulls and goats it worked under the blood of bulls and goats it worked faith is gathering what are you scared about are you a war afraid to take his word for anything don't be afraid call the thing right I am an heir to this I wonder if anybody here tonight can join their words with the voice of a prophet and say I am heir to this and he says I know I don't deserve it but I'm an heir anyhow and because I'm an heir I receive it that's it there you are because I'm an heir where salvation heir of the Holy Spirit I'm an heir because jesus paid the price nothing I've done I fell heir to it I'm healed because I'm an error why was Michael's life heal because she was an heir perfect assurance Jesus is mine for - oh what a foretaste of glory divine air salvation purchase of God born of the Spirit Washington's but that's our story then Satan can't stand that because he's a defeated being again we're strangers to one another young lady you believed Christ knows us both here's the woman at the well and our Savior you're not her and neither am i he but his spirit lives forever and this young woman standing here if you could see it between her and I is a lie - this angel of light stands here but beyond that as a shadow in that shadow is death and darkness it's a cancer it's located in the rectum and you're not from this country you're not at you're a Kentuckian that's right mrs. Johnson I'll tell you what if you believe with all your heart go back home and Jesus Christ makes you well do you believe that I condemn the devil that's taken the life of this woman and on the basis the resurrection of Jesus Christ I now challenge Satan and tell him he is a defeated B and he says as God's servant under the anointing the Holy Ghost that the Commission given me by an angel I condemned this devil for the woman's life let her live O Lord amen return home and rejoice and be happy thanking the Lord don't doubt now don't have a doubt in your mind again may the devil be defeated in our lives and we know he is defeated because he is a defeated being I wonder when's the last time you talked about that I wonder when's the last time you talked about how the fee that he is instead of aiming point o you know I just barely make it I just do this I do that I make so many mistakes mother man said if you look back you're never overcome you say well I know that but are you doing it he says may the devil be defeated in our lives and we know he's defeated because he is the defeated being and Satan I turn to you now to say this you are defeated she were afraid to say that you are defeated and you're not afraid of us but you're afraid of the one we're speaking about you see the giant wasn't afraid of David but he could have seen who was there you have lost every bit of power you ever had you were defeated at Calvary he sends it by saying I'll just stay shedding with God keep believing now if all your heart and horde I believe that you heal me right now I believe because I laid my hand on this man here he laid his hand on me and on this woman she laid her hand on me I was led to do that I was led to lay my hand on this person they were led to lay their hands on me and the same Holy Ghost that told Simeon and gave him the promise led me to do this while we're right here in this place of divine healing now I believe Lord Satan you might as well get away from me because I'm a seed of Abraham by Jesus Christ and I take the preeminence I hope you like reading quotes [Music] our Heavenly Father in the sacredness of this moment when decisions must be made when men will live or die these Christians have made their confession because of your presence and at the scripture telling us that we're at the end time and they have their hands laid upon each other which is your word commissioning your church heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never fail therefore Satan you are a defeated being [Applause] how does that become effective because there is a people believing in the Commission so you have no legal rights to begin with to to mark torment these people you're a bluff and we're calling that bluff Jesus Christ defeated you in his death and resurrection his blood paid every price of sin that you caused the family of the human race into and now we are sons and daughters of God again and his anointed spirit is speaking with us this evening as he did with Adam therefore you cannot hold these Christians any longer I adjure thee by the Living God you depart from these sick people with a faith listen now so predominating that it'll drive you out of their thoughts and realms it'll drive you out of their thoughts and realms why are you reading these brother Danny because the devil doesn't like to hear that he's been on the losing team all along I'm only reiterating to you the anointing under the prophet of the hour that told us how to approach the enemy to challenge and let me tell you as there is a challenge there there is a challenge now how are you going to meet it [Applause] hallelujah I just want you to get the picture in your mind of how defeated the devil is if one man could haul a thousand to a meeting and leave delivered don't you think tonight that you can push aside every bit of tiredness and the wondering well I wonder tonight when brother Danny is going to quit this service and it's quick thinking the devil's thoughts now start thinking with a faith that is predominating Jesus Christ drive the enemy out of my thoughts and out of my realms my prophet told me that a man can live a life so close to God that the devil will run out of options he will not know what to do with you he cannot confuse you he cannot get you away from the message he can't make you stop listening [Applause] hallelujah let me put a blog out tonight we have won the battle is over we have won the enemy is defeated you are a believer [Applause] hallelujah I'm talking to the answer to the devil's question [Applause] [Music] can I just say something brother man said that's why the devil's howling that's why he's trying to shut her up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we live in an hour they despise the voice they call it names they do this they do that we just received the news not long ago you all heard about it Amon how Amen the Pentecostals being called by the Pope let's all be brothers we're brothers let's all come together like Joseph and his brothers I love you You Love Me we're a big happy family so we played all those 20-something minutes of quotes of these guys talking these Pentecostals and how they prayed in the spirit to the pope and blessed him then they stood up there and shivered and shook and said fifty years ago this wasn't possible so then we stopped it then we put on the voice of the prophet who fifty years ago said it would happen and we're sitting there and we're listening to these guys talk and laugh and gone then the prophets voice come on and the Holy Spirit dropped in the road I still love that voice I tell you God still loves that voice and God ordained two people to keep that voice alive I said God ordained two people let me be one of them I said let me be one of them to keep that voice alive let me be one [Applause] there was a little woman I said there was a little woman Jesus spoke to the Pharisees this is what really made a man he said as it was in the days of Elijah there were many widows in that day there were many Jewish widows in that day but there was a Gentile Jewish Widow I [Applause] ordained her to be the one to entertain that prophet she would keep the voice of that prophet alive I hope I'm not too fanatical but I have been ordained you have been ordained and understand here and be the voice like Rahab the harlot was the voice not you no not you it couldn't be you how can it be I disdain you I disdain you there's nothing about you we know you got problems David you're just a naughty boy see they're beginning to call him names when he began to assume his position should I say that again when David began to assume his position in Christ in what God had made him they begin to call him names but David wasn't worried you see because these guys been up there for 40 days they've had a lot of time to write a lot of stuff David comes to the battle I'm come here to help you boys I'm just going to give you some bread and cheese hey what's that oh I'll go do it what's your problem who do you think you are I've been in the message all these years and now you're just getting in and you're not even trained who are you kids who do you think you are hey listen am i interested in debate with you you interesting debate me brother I'm not interesting debate in you I don't know what's the reward for this it's all I'm interested in what do I get to kill him well boy the reward is here get the king's daughter really that's good enough for me I'll go do it alright don't worry I'll do it it's alright brother Tim I'm gonna do it he wanted to get married like he does hey man I'm gonna do it and they said now listen come up we gotta come back here never another debate about this Saul said now Saul's not fighting his kingship is over his reign is over he hasn't received Samuel as that vindicated prophet so he's lost the m-19 and David has been raised up to finish the work that Samson started [Applause] so it was the harvest time of the Philistines it was their time to go [Music] and God said I need somebody that'll believe me Salcedo let me give you my armor I'll help you out here David should I've improved your armor and it hasn't worked for you why do I want it [Applause] if it worked for you you would be out there doing something about it you're only trying to pull people away from confrontation with the enemy you're not helping anything you build any why are you so militant against this because I see when it's done aiming in my church and how these people come in and they come in leading silly women captive I always wondered how it could happen how do men creep into houses and lead silly women captive until I realized it could be done through an internet connection so God has to raise up men of God that will stand against such brother BAM said you must discern and withstand oh it doesn't really matter no no it does let's get into debater that doesn't really matter but it did to David I'll go down and do it and I'm not only going to speak to you I'm going to speak to the army behind you I'm gonna kill you and they are me today is dead meat you hear that boys oh it's over hey where's brother Ricardo yeah that's what he was Joe it's over it's over it's over three cheers for David could you imagine that here's this boy the last boy the end of the road of the family nobody else out of that family was anointed but David and he was a further revelation of who Jesus Christ would be and he comes down there the last one not invited to the meeting but now part of it not inviting to the bow but now a part of it Haven you might not have been raised to the message but now you're a part of it amen you not be old enough to remember brother BAM but now you're a part of it you're here you're engaged you're in the battle oh I love it how a man of God could run to him run to the battle and he ain't even loaded his weapon yet he hasn't done anything just running I'm gonna take you down boy you've been defeated you don't you come against my brother you come against my sister you've been in my family I got a brother than need you I got a sister that needs God I told that little sister been holding on now her boy come now her daddy caught her her husband come I said you got one more what about you you got one more and David ran down there as he ran he loaded and as he ran he threw and the devil comes down and David he didn't have a weapon to chop his head off cause he know I'll just use yours that's all I need what do you got there though I got an ak-47 outtake that's good enough I just use that he took his weapon he killed him he stood on him and he looked at the rest [Applause] what about it you Resta Philistines not you but what do you think about this and then a revival came to the boys upon the hill they said if God could save those kids out of that Simon Fraser University what about me what about you [Applause] [Music] Satan is a defeated being I'm gonna read you one more quote and I am done yes who ever said that but I got to find it maybe I'll have brother disco come help me find it hallelujah do you love God you don't have to nut down to the devil brother BAM says you see faith sees what God wants done and I hope it goes in faith on look at present time faith don't see this here faith looks to see what God wants and works accordingly less quote last quote and I found it he said if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith of knowing who he was and he was a predestinated creature are you ready congregation says amen what about the predestinated right now you believe the bride is predestinated the congregation says now I'm gonna ask you a question and I know you're gonna do it because you're in church but how many believe your predestinated stand up now stay up now watch then I'm talking to you the predestinated Bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church is in it now and it's in it now everything is in order the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been sold the evening lights have been signing the sign of solemn jesus promised us here in Malachi 4 a predestinated church and he stops and he says o devil Church of the Living God here and on tape that's me on tape do you know where you stand do you know you're caught of God that the Holy Ghost reigns in your heart and every word of God is real to you oh brother how is Satan gonna stand against that how is he going to stop it from growing how is he gonna keep the signs from following he could throw them in the jail they were fed to the Lions they were sawed asunder they were jerked to pieces and you can't kill a church that's predestinate how do you know but at any cost you're here there were your brothers then we're your sisters jerk killed eight bylines and you're here lord help us to see hey man you can't kill a church for destinated those he foreknew like he did Jesus He has called those he corney's justified those he justified he's already glorified they are predestinated and now in the last day with every seed sold everything in order the world in its order the time shaped up the church and order the seed the Living Light the evening lights the signs like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down performing signs like he did then Malachi 4 promised he would sin in the last days what he promised and we see it here well where and he says a man a man a man a man a man do you love him so in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sewed with the seed the Holy Spirit in the church then this is what he said Satan be careful why should Satan be careful because the seed has come back to what it was what was it in the original what wasn't in the original man could walk and they would lay people down just so the shadow would fall just a few days before brother misko spoke about him he had denied the Lord three times but now after the filling of the Holy Spirit he stands as a son of God and demons are afraid of his shadow so I'll leave it with this Satan be careful be careful be careful you don't know who you're dealing with here tonight this should be the name of Google amen brother let's go ray he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause]
