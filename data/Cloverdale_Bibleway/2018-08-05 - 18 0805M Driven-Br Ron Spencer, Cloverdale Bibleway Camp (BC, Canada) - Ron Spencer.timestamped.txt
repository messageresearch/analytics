[0:09] I give my heart to you.
[0:23] Call me
[0:31] every day. I praise you.

[1:48] Lord fall just like the rain
[1:53] saturating

[1:57] my thirsty
[1:59] soul.
[2:01] Come and walk fresh on me.
[2:06] Lord, fill my cup again.
[2:10] Heal my heart.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Heal my heart
[2:15] and make me whole.
[2:21] I need
[2:23] you now
[2:26] for your spirit.
[2:29] Pour your spirit out Lord.
[2:32] pour your spine
[2:43] satur.
[2:46] My mercy soul
[2:50] come and walk on me
[2:55] till I come again
[3:01] my heart

[3:10] I need
[3:12] you now
[3:14] for your
[3:16] sing
[3:17] for your spirit Lord.
[3:20] pour your spat
[3:40] on me
[3:44] again.
[3:49] my heart
[3:51] and make me home
[4:02] for your spirit.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just want another drink from
[4:12] the fountain this morning. Could you
[4:13] stand together with me, please?
[4:17] There is a fountain open in the house of
[4:19] David. And this service is going just a
[4:22] little differently from how I even
[4:23] planned. The Lord knows what he's doing.
[4:27] Amen. There are needs that we need to
[4:29] remember. And this song just came to my
[4:31] mind. There's a fountain open. No,
[4:33] there's not just healing in that
[4:34] fountain. It's not just salvation.
[4:36] There's peace. There's joy. There's
[4:39] comfort. There's strength. Everything
[4:41] you have need of this morning, amen, can
[4:43] be found in that fountain.
[4:46] Amen. I just received a note to please
[4:48] remember the Floren family in prayer as
[4:50] brother Roy Florence mother just passed
[4:52] away back home this morning
[4:53] unexpectedly.
[4:55] I know our sister Kalista and sister
[4:56] Margaret are there right now and God
[4:59] knows what he's doing. Amen. Saints,
[5:01] let's remember the Florent family that
[5:03] you would just be a source of strength
[5:05] to them. Many years they've prayed for
[5:07] their family and God can use this time.
[5:09] Amen. To speak to the their loved ones.
[5:11] So let's just ask that God would be a
[5:13] comfort to them. Amen. and and we
[5:15] remember them as we sing the song. We're
[5:16] going to turn the pulpit to our pastor
[5:18] after a moment, but let's just continue
[5:21] to worship in this atmosphere. Amen.
[5:24] There's a fountain open.
[5:27] There is a fountain
[5:31] open in the house
[5:37] of David
[5:40] to you.
[5:45] Believe
[5:46] there are streams.
[5:52] There are streams of grace.
[5:56] flowing down from Calary.
[6:01] So come
[6:04] now
[6:06] receive. Sing the chorus again. There is
[6:09] a fountain. There is a fountain
[6:15] open in the house
[6:20] of David.
[6:25] praise
[6:41] from
[6:46] now.
[6:53] And we did have another prayer request.
[6:54] I'm sorry for my brother Henry Walder.
[6:57] He's asked us to please remember the
[6:58] daughter of a contractor that he works
[7:00] with. He is she is currently undergoing
[7:02] cancer treatment. And he told him that
[7:04] he would put in a prayer request to be
[7:05] remembering her this morning. Amen. I
[7:08] believe our pastor has some words for us
[7:09] and then afterwards we'll go to prayer.
[7:10] So let's just maintain this atmosphere
[7:12] even as our pastor speaks to us. And
[7:15] then brother Ed, would you like to?
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ryan.
[7:24] Well, this is the last service here,
[7:27] but I just want to
[7:30] I'm impressed with decisions.
[7:34] Not only decisions that you have made,
[7:38] decisions that perhaps you are faced
[7:40] with,
[7:41] decisions that you will make. four of
[7:45] our young men and the young ladies that
[7:48] are here took a decision to be baptized
[7:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[7:56] I'll never forget when I took that
[7:59] decision
[8:00] and uh being a married man, I waited for
[8:04] my wife to take the same decision
[8:08] and then we were baptized.
[8:12] Uh,
[8:13] we had to take a decision to buy this
[8:17] camp.
[8:19] You were not here
[8:22] that day.
[8:26] And right behind you is a row of trees.
[8:31] And the authorities of Department of
[8:34] Transport
[8:36] had already taken a decision to take the
[8:41] trees and 30 ft of our playground the
[8:45] whole distance.
[8:47] And they had letters letters had come
[8:50] back and forth after we entered into an
[8:53] agreement to purchase.
[8:56] You didn't know anything about that.
[9:03] And I didn't know anything about you
[9:05] being here. I didn't know that this
[9:08] would be 10 years
[9:11] that we would be here since the purchase
[9:15] and 7 years before that
[9:18] we rented it.
[9:20] And 33 years today, 33 years we've had
[9:27] camp every year.
[9:29] Some of the brothers that are deacons
[9:31] and some that are on the platform
[9:36] were not here, were not believers, were
[9:39] not even saved then,
[9:42] but they took a decision at some point
[9:45] in life.
[9:48] And maybe somebody here is in the midst
[9:51] of making a decision.
[9:54] I want to give you some advice.
[9:57] speaking over this pulpit. I want to
[9:59] give you some advice.
[10:01] Make certain that it's a word decision
[10:04] and that you are
[10:07] say even if even if it costs me
[10:10] something, even if it costs me a better
[10:13] job,
[10:15] even if it costs me a better education.
[10:20] Brother Yonas,
[10:22] I see you standing here and we've
[10:24] observed you during the camp.
[10:28] And you made a decision,
[10:31] you and Hoppy,
[10:34] to become man and wife. And you are
[10:36] here. I want to tell you about your
[10:39] grandpa,
[10:40] brother Schumacher,
[10:43] who was he made a journey. He may took a
[10:47] decision to make a journey to the
[10:49] Ukraine
[10:52] and there saw a church
[10:55] that I had heard about and we had heard
[10:58] about and some of the parents of you
[11:02] young people
[11:04] took a decision to help to build that
[11:07] church.
[11:08] is I think the largest church in Europe
[11:12] holds about 700 people and they have war
[11:16] there now. But your grandpa, brother
[11:19] Yonas, took a decision to buy the pastor
[11:23] a van.
[11:24] He didn't have any vehicle
[11:27] and neither did he have a driver's
[11:29] license. Sometimes we have to make a
[11:32] decision that may not even make sense.
[11:35] But then once you make a decision for
[11:39] God's direction and for God's way and on
[11:43] behalf of the beckoning of the Holy
[11:46] Spirit and while the word is being
[11:48] preached today, Brother Tom took a
[11:52] decision to call
[11:55] brother Ron Spencer
[11:58] and he made a decision to come here.
[12:01] Friends, that's when God starts. He
[12:05] takes his part. I want to say one thing
[12:07] to you on all the authority of the
[12:10] scriptures.
[12:12] You make a decision for God, he will
[12:15] keep his part of the bargain.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; He will come on the scene.
[12:21] And I I stood in the snow out here just
[12:23] behind the tent and walked back and
[12:26] forth. And I was pained in my heart
[12:30] that we would lose one acre of land. And
[12:35] the Holy Spirit then dropped a dis
[12:39] dropped a question in my heart and said,
[12:42] "Ask this man a question. He's the
[12:45] headman of the Department of Transport."
[12:50] And I asked him, "Who are you making the
[12:52] decision for?
[12:55] Who are you taking this land? We our
[12:58] land here is just scarce. Scarcely
[13:02] enough for our young people.
[13:06] And if you're going to take an acre of
[13:08] land,
[13:10] you must give us an acre of land. go
[13:13] into the bush and bring your equipment
[13:15] from the bridge up here and take the
[13:19] bush away and bring dirt over and you
[13:23] must smooth out this land, this
[13:25] property. We can't just take these trees
[13:27] and he they even offered so much for us
[13:30] to build a fence. We'll bring the
[13:32] material and you'll have to put up a
[13:34] fence 30 ft in from these trees.
[13:39] And I said, "Who are you doing this
[13:41] for?" He said, "The Department of
[13:43] Fisheries, they do not have the power to
[13:46] take expropriate the land. The
[13:50] Department of Highways has the power." I
[13:53] said, "Do you need it then for the
[13:54] road?" He said, "No, we do not need it."
[13:58] He said, "So what you're saying is land
[14:00] for land?" I said, "Yes, I'm saying land
[14:04] for land." He said, "Then we're not
[14:07] carry it any further." and they sent us
[14:10] a letter and cancelled the whole thing.
[14:13] And I say, "Praise be to God."
[14:18] But I did not see you here. I did not
[14:20] hear your clapping. I did not hear
[14:23] Brother Ron Spencer preaching. We were
[14:26] just standing in the snow.
[14:29] Sometimes you have to make a decision.
[14:33] And you don't know what the future will
[14:35] hold. But I want to say to you, don't be
[14:38] afraid. Don't have any fear. Make the
[14:42] decision that you know in your heart is
[14:44] the right decision for God. And I have
[14:47] heard the preaching of the word and I
[14:50] have made decisions while I was standing
[14:53] here behind the preacher. And while
[14:56] brother Ron Spencer preached, I
[14:59] recognized it was more than a man
[15:02] speaking.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; God was speaking. Hallelujah.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Man cannot speak to your heart and God
[15:09] speaks to our heart. And that's the time
[15:12] to say, "I'll follow you."
[15:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the future is, but
[15:17] I'll follow you.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; And I am so glad for the last 10 years.
[15:23] I'm so glad for the last 33 years. We're
[15:27] so glad that all of you are here. And I
[15:30] want to say welcome in the name of the
[15:33] Lord Jesus Christ. And he who you
[15:36] decide, make your decision for him.
[15:40] Don't ever fail to make it for him. He
[15:44] will stand behind it. He will do more
[15:47] than you even expect. Do you believe
[15:49] that?
[15:51] &gt;&gt; I do believe that.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going to pray now and
[15:56] ask God's blessing upon you, upon the
[15:59] offering, and upon the
[16:05] requests that have been made.
[16:08] Father,
[16:11] I lay unworthy hands upon these
[16:13] requests.
[16:15] We think of the man, a contractor with
[16:18] cancer.
[16:19] We think of our brother
[16:23] uh Ber Cam Buer. Oh God, and what you
[16:27] have done and what you are doing. We
[16:29] believe that you are active by the Holy
[16:32] Spirit and by the virtue of the
[16:35] resurrected Christ. You are active
[16:37] today. You are fulfilling. There's a
[16:40] certain part of the scripture and you
[16:43] determined that there would be certain
[16:45] fulfillment and certain people and
[16:49] certain young people that are standing
[16:51] here will be the active part of that. I
[16:56] want to be active. Oh God, whatever your
[16:59] will is, we say thy will be done on
[17:03] earth as it is in heaven. We thank you,
[17:06] Father, for those that are being
[17:08] baptized and for those that what our
[17:11] brother John will be doing baptizing. We
[17:14] pray that you will anoint, oh God, your
[17:17] servants, your ministers. Anoint our
[17:19] brother Ron Spencer. I pray to say the
[17:23] words that we desire. We're so thankful,
[17:25] oh God. You put it in brother Tom Ray's
[17:28] heart to invite him. We believe it was
[17:31] all in divine order.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; And we have seen you over and over and
[17:37] over again. One miracle after the other.
[17:41] And now we have a whole testimony of
[17:44] miracles last night. I say thank you.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. And we what you
[17:53] have done we believe that you will
[17:55] continue to do for those that are needy.
[17:59] For the requests that have been made, it
[18:01] shall be done according to your will and
[18:04] that you might be praised. Bless the
[18:07] offering and the giving in the name of
[18:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[18:14] Brother Ryan. Thank you.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:21] You may have your seats. I'm just going
[18:24] to invite the Saskatchewan group. I
[18:26] believe Sister Melody. Thank you,
[18:29] brother Kelvin. The boys, I think some
[18:31] of the Hilderbrands are going to come
[18:32] and sing for us. Maybe they could just
[18:33] come and start getting ready at this
[18:34] time.
[18:36] Amen. Let's just sing um uh I will bless
[18:39] the Lord. I will bless the Lord with a
[18:40] heart of thanksgiving. Eflat. Yeah.
[18:47] With my hands lifted up
[18:53] and my mouth filled with praise
[18:59] and with the heart of thanksgiving.
[19:05] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[19:09] I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless
[19:12] thee, oh Lord.
[19:17] I bless thee all
[19:23] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[19:29] I will bless thee, oh once again with my
[19:32] hands lifted up. Oh with my hands lifted
[19:37] up.
[19:40] Oh, and my mouth filled with praise
[19:47] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[19:52] I will bless thee, oh,
[19:55] I will bless thee.
[19:58] Yes, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[20:04] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[20:10] with the heart of thanksgiving.
[20:16] I'll bless thee all.
[20:30] bless you. Um, we just uh chose a song
[20:33] and it's an old song from the believers
[20:35] and someone asked yesterday if we did
[20:38] that because brother Menow was coming
[20:39] out and I Oh, I didn't even know he was
[20:40] here. So, it was good to see him. I
[20:42] don't know if he's here today or if he's
[20:44] gone home, but if he's still here, God
[20:46] bless you, brother Menow. And, uh, we've
[20:49] just enjoyed some of the songs that they
[20:52] sang over the years. So, we're going to
[20:53] sing this song for you. Brother Ram
[20:55] tells the story of the U magnet going
[20:57] over top of the factory and picking up
[20:58] all the all the uh pieces that weren't
[21:01] tied down. And the purpose of that story
[21:03] was to tell us to uh not be tied down to
[21:06] the things of this world. And that's
[21:08] what this song is about. And so, if
[21:10] we're still tied down to something, this
[21:12] morning is a good time to untie. Amen.
[21:23] I'm getting weary of this lonesome road
[21:27] I've
[21:30] every day I'm longing more to be with
[21:33] God
[21:35] just to live this world of sin in all it
[21:41] and to walk into a heavenly new life.
[21:47] There's a great magnet drawing from
[21:50] above.
[21:53] And there's nothing can hold me below.
[21:59] I'll rise to meet him in the air.
[22:05] When the final call comes for me to go,
[22:10] as I gaze into the starry sky above,
[22:16] how I marvel at the mighty works of God.
[22:22] Yes, we know he's living in my soul.
[22:28] He's the greatest youth anyone.
[22:34] There's a rain
[22:36] from above
[22:39] and there's nothing
[22:43] below.
[22:46] I'll rise to the air.
[22:51] When the final call comes for me to go
[22:55] to us. Oh, there's a great magnet from
[23:00] above.
[23:03] And there's nothing
[23:06] here below.
[23:09] I'll rise to meet him in the air.
[23:14] When the final call comes for me to go.
[23:20] When the final call
[23:25] comes for me to go.
[23:45] Amen. Thank you so much. It's been such
[23:47] a privilege to have all those who've
[23:49] been visiting with us. Just each life
[23:51] we've been blessed by and we want to
[23:52] thank you for making the journey to be
[23:54] with us. We love each of you. We don't
[23:56] get to spend the time fellowshipping as
[23:58] much as we'd like, but we do want you to
[23:59] know that we love you. We appreciate all
[24:01] of those who have come to be with us.
[24:03] Let's just sing God is good all the
[24:05] time. I'm going to ask those of the
[24:07] choir that sang with us. There is no one
[24:09] like our God. We'd like to sing that
[24:10] before we turn the service to our
[24:11] brother Ron. It's been on my heart and
[24:14] we had many, many specials and I just
[24:16] I'm sorry. I would love to fit everyone
[24:18] in, but I just feel that it's time to
[24:22] have another song and turn to the word
[24:23] this morning. We want brother Ron to
[24:25] have his liberty and take his time. This
[24:26] is our last service and then so maybe
[24:29] the choir could just come. We could have
[24:30] some help with the microphones. Maybe
[24:31] brothers, if you don't mind, as we sing
[24:33] God is good all the time. When you're
[24:35] walking,
[24:37] when you're walking
[24:40] through the valley
[24:43] and the shadows are all around, do not
[24:48] fear.
[24:50] For I know my God will guide you.
[24:55] He will keep you safe and sound.
[25:00] Lord, he has promised
[25:04] to never leave you nor forsake you.
[25:10] And in order truth, God is good
[25:16] all the time.
[25:19] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[25:24] of mine. My God is good
[25:28] all the time.
[25:31] Through the darkest night, his light
[25:36] still shines. God is good. My God is
[25:41] good.
[25:43] All the time we were sinners. Sing it
[25:46] together. We were sinners
[25:49] and so unworthy.
[25:52] But for us, he came to die. be filled up
[25:59] with hallelujah.
[26:02] His holy spirit
[26:06] standing
[26:10] that his love is everlasting
[26:16] and his mercy.
[26:20] It will never end. But is
[26:26] all the time
[26:28] puts a song of praise in this heart of
[26:34] my mind. God is good
[26:38] all the time.
[26:41] Through the dark night, his light still
[26:46] shines. God is good.
[26:49] Yes, God is good
[26:53] all the time.
[26:58] Amen. Let's start at E flat. We might
[27:00] sing it a little faster than we usually
[27:01] do. We want to rejoice this morning.
[27:03] This is not a special. I believe we have
[27:05] the words on the screen. Number 13:10.
[27:06] We want you to join with us.
[27:09] Amen. And it says in Isaiah, just to
[27:11] give you a little bit of the background,
[27:13] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[27:15] thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed thee,
[27:17] O Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed
[27:20] thee. I have called thee. By thy name,
[27:22] thou art mine. When thou passest through
[27:24] the waters, I will be with thee. And
[27:26] through the rivers, they shall not
[27:28] overflow thee. When thou walst through
[27:30] the fire, thou shalt not be burned,
[27:32] neither shall the flame kindle upon
[27:34] thee. Thus saith the Lord, the King of
[27:36] Israel, and his redeemer, the Lord of
[27:38] hosts. I am the first and I am the last,
[27:40] and beside me there is no God.
[27:43] Hallelujah. There is no one like our God
[27:46] this morning. And let's worship him
[27:48] together as we prepare to hear the word
[27:50] this morning. Amen. He stretches the
[27:52] heavens. Do we have the lyrics on the
[27:54] screen? We do. He stretches the heavens
[27:59] like curtains before him. He forms every
[28:04] star.
[28:06] He calls him by name.
[28:10] He does not grow weary.
[28:13] His strength knows no way.
[28:17] The greatness of our God. None can
[28:22] comprehend.
[28:28] Who is like to our God?

[28:40] before him. There's no one beside him.
[28:46] There is no other

[29:28] and praise

[32:07] No one like him.
[32:23] with his praise.
[32:26] All creation
[32:29] declaring that there is none like him.
[32:35] No one like him.
[32:41] Who is like to God?
[32:48] Who will I go to our
[33:04] God?
[33:09] There's no one before.
[33:16] There is no
[33:20] no one like him.
[33:23] There is no power.
[33:27] No one worthy of praise
[33:32] God.
[33:43] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[33:53] Holy
[33:55] and power and praise
[33:59] is our God.
[34:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[34:12] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[34:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[34:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[34:34] Oh, your voice is like thunder. Oh God,
[34:37] we've heard that voice thunder out this
[34:39] camp. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be
[34:42] the Lord God Almighty. Amen. Let's just
[34:45] sing the chorus as our brother Tom comes
[34:47] and we prepare to turn the service to
[34:49] our brother on. Is that your God this
[34:51] morning? You identify with that God. No
[34:54] one like our God. Fear not, saith the
[34:56] Lord, for I have redeemed thee.
[34:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing it
[35:00] one more time as our brother Tom comes.
[35:03] There's no one before him. There's no
[35:06] one before him.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; No one beside him.
[35:13] There is no
[35:17] one.
[35:20] Yeah.
[35:22] Heat.

[36:38] Hallelujah.
[36:40] There is
[36:44] no one, no one
[36:47] like our God. Are you rejoicing this
[36:51] morning?
[36:52] Are you rejoicing this morning?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing over the victories of God,
[36:59] what God has done through this camp. I'm
[37:01] rejoicing this morning. Before we invite
[37:04] Brother Ron Spencer, pastor Elton,
[37:08] Virginia. We love him. We appreciate the
[37:11] gift of God in him. We appreciate him
[37:14] bringing his son. And brother Andrew
[37:16] saying he would come. Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And minister such powerful messages to
[37:22] you young people. Are you thankful?
[37:26] &gt;&gt; I am indeed thankful.
[37:29] The Bible says, "Bless the Lord, oh my
[37:31] soul, and forget not all
[37:34] his benefits.
[37:36] who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[37:39] health all thy diseases, who redeemth
[37:45] thy life from destruction.
[37:48] I would say this day, this scripture,
[37:52] &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled in your lives.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And I just so thankful for what God's
[37:59] doing. We have four baptisms.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Four baptisms.
[38:06] Hallelujah.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Last night I was praying with a brother
[38:09] here in the front and I was just walking
[38:12] away and and brother Tim Dodd, he says
[38:14] to me, he says, "Brother Tom, Brother
[38:16] Tom, Brother Tom." And I look around and
[38:19] there's brother Gabe Reendroa
[38:22] looking at me and he'd been saying,
[38:24] "Brother Tom," thinking that I would
[38:26] miss him and tears streaming down his
[38:30] face.
[38:31] Said, "Oh, I want to be baptized.
[38:34] Brother Tom,
[38:35] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified in his death,
[38:38] burial, and resurrection.
[38:44] You want to see miracles?
[38:47] You're looking at a miracle. A young man
[38:50] under the pressure of life can make a
[38:54] decision.
[38:55] This is what I want. That's what camp's
[38:58] all about. We'll put up the tent and
[39:00] we'll do our activities and the sisters
[39:03] will labor in the kitchen. They have a
[39:05] part to play in what God is doing in the
[39:08] lives of our young people.
[39:10] Then before I could get out of the tent,
[39:13] Brother Max, Ivan ankle was waiting
[39:15] there. Brother Tom, Brother Tom, I need
[39:19] to be baptized.
[39:21] I said, "Brother Max, you're not going
[39:23] to believe this. I just left a young
[39:24] fellow that wants to be baptized."
[39:28] And then before I'm finished there,
[39:30] there's Brother Jed standing there.
[39:32] Ollo.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Saints, if you can't glorify God this
[39:36] morning, I don't. Something's wrong.
[39:42] GLORY.
[39:44] GLORY. Heaven rejoices over one. One,
[39:48] two, three. But God's not finished at
[39:52] the three. Melena Sherbov Makmood's
[39:56] Tanya's daughter.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; It's going to be baptized.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; TO GOD BE THE GLORY.
[40:10] IF THIS gospel doesn't produce young
[40:13] people like you, then we need to throw
[40:15] it away. And people got a problem WITH
[40:18] THIS GOSPEL. I want to look at their
[40:20] lives. I want to look at their children.
[40:22] I want to see what they believe. They
[40:23] say, "Well, I got an intelligence and I
[40:25] understand God and don't have a family."
[40:29] I said, "This is the family of God." And
[40:31] this message is producing wonderful
[40:35] young people to carry this message.
[40:38] Amen. These are your benefits that you
[40:42] can draw from. Praise the Lord for our
[40:45] 10th anniversary. It's like brother
[40:48] Biscll said, "Well, 10 seems so small."
[40:50] I said, "But brother Ed, don't forget
[40:52] this is 33 years. This is 10 years that
[40:57] you had the vision that we'd have this
[41:00] camp."
[41:01] And I said at the beginning of junior
[41:03] camp, I baptized over 250, if not close
[41:07] to 300 young people in these 33 years.
[41:12] Praise our God.
[41:21] Mark the spot. Kings have come to
[41:23] battle. Music and hurt. He was there.
[41:27] Roll a stone away. This has been a camp
[41:30] of all camps and we want to thank God
[41:34] that he's come and visited our camp and
[41:37] brother Ron Spencer was gracious enough
[41:40] to say yes to come to the camp. Brother
[41:43] Andrew was gracious enough to say I want
[41:45] to come to that camp. You know what 10
[41:48] means in the scripture? This is our 10th
[41:50] year. You know what 10 means? 10 means
[41:53] harmony.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Harmony.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. 10 mean in the scripture it means
[42:00] completeness completeness and divine
[42:03] order and all I have seen from the
[42:06] beginning of camp to today the divine
[42:10] order of God harmony
[42:14] God and man becoming one
[42:18] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said this and I sorry
[42:20] for de delaying the service a little bit
[42:22] he says now this person if you can get
[42:24] that into your soul young people so in
[42:28] harmony with God that your soul would be
[42:31] one together. Then you can ask anything
[42:35] you will and it shall be given you.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[42:42] &gt;&gt; You've had a testimony. You've had
[42:45] examples on this platform and now it's
[42:48] the challenge is it's you.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; It's harmony not just with the ministry.
[42:53] It's harmony with you. Brother Bram says
[42:57] if you can get harmony in your soul with
[42:59] God, united together as one, you can ask
[43:03] what you will and it shall be given you.
[43:08] How great is our God?
[43:12] How great is our God?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, don't want to
[43:14] sleep on me now. This is going to be the
[43:16] capstone message this morning.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to pull on the word of God
[43:21] and watch God come behind the word of
[43:23] God for your life. You say, "Well, this
[43:25] is a Sunday morning. This is Sunday
[43:27] morning to give him all the praise and
[43:28] the glory."
[43:30] &gt;&gt; There is no God like our God. Our God is
[43:34] tremendous.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; I think we need to sing that to Brother
[43:40] Ron to let Brother Spencer know that we
[43:43] actually believe the God he preached
[43:46] about is tremendous in my life.
[43:58] I call on the Lord.
[44:02] He hears me and he
[44:07] has he been faithful and true for years.
[44:12] Bless his holy name.
[44:15] My companion.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; He's my best friend.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; He's my best friend. The only true God.
[44:21] There's no one greater. Oh, wonderful
[44:24] savior.
[44:26] My Jesus the lion of Judah. That's my
[44:31] God.
[44:34] His strength never fail. He go through
[44:37] the fire to save the sinner. Yes, he is
[44:42] mighty. He sent his angel.
[44:49] There is no fair.
[44:52] Our God cannot hand
[44:56] this city within you and me.
[45:04] The Christmas story. when you're in
[45:07] trouble. And when you're in trouble,
[45:11] Jehovah,
[45:13] the great enforcer,
[45:15] God Almighty, will fight your battles.
[45:20] Oh yes, he will stand for you.
[45:26] We know your victory will come. Not the
[45:29] way you think it should, but my great
[45:32] Jehovah.
[45:33] Just love the paradox. Just stay in your
[45:36] position and watch the miraculous
[45:40] come into action.
[45:44] Our God is tremendous. His strength
[45:47] never failing.
[45:49] Through the fire just to save a sinner.
[45:53] Yes, he is almighty.
[45:56] He sent his angels
[45:58] can guide me. There's no score
[46:04] that my God cannot handle. Our God in
[46:07] simplicity revealed in you and me came
[46:11] down from his glory and gave us the
[46:14] victory. The greatest
[46:17] when you're in trouble, young people,
[46:20] when you're in trouble, Jehovah,
[46:24] the great for sure, God almighty, he
[46:29] will fight your battles.
[46:32] Oh yes, he will stand for you. He will
[46:36] stand for you.
[46:39] Oh, not the way you think it should, but
[46:42] my great home. Just love the paradox.
[46:46] Just stay in your position and watch the
[46:49] miraculous
[46:51] come into action.
[46:55] My God is tremendous. His strength never
[46:58] fails. He goes through the fire just to
[47:02] save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty.
[47:06] He sent the angels
[47:09] can guide me.
[47:12] There is no powerful my God cannot
[47:16] handle. My God in simplicity revealed
[47:20] you and me. Came down from his glory and
[47:24] gave us the victory.
[47:27] The glory.
[47:30] Hallelujah.
[47:45] It is the greatest love story.
[47:48] Amen. God bless you. God bless you.
[47:52] Maybe we could just talk to him just
[47:54] now.
[47:55] Maybe you have a need that you'd like to
[47:57] say, "I would like for him to pass by my
[48:00] way.
[48:03] my way
[48:05] and I would like to give thanksgiving
[48:07] for what he has done
[48:09] on this campground.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[48:21] &gt;&gt; we give you glory.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; You are the worthy one, Father.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And we thank you, Father, that we can
[48:30] stand here today. Hallelujah.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; We ask you that Lord that you would give
[48:35] us grace,
[48:38] Lord. This is your people.
[48:41] This is all your plan.
[48:44] Lord, I just ask you now that you would
[48:48] come
[48:49] take every moment that has happened at
[48:51] this camp.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; It's been your plan. It's been your mind
[48:57] and your achievement.
[48:59] I pray that you would just bless every
[49:01] person and every effort that has went
[49:03] forth.
[49:05] Lord, from the ones that was the help
[49:08] behind the scenes,
[49:11] &gt;&gt; oh God, would you stretch forth your
[49:14] hand of mercy and strengthen them today?
[49:18] every counselor,
[49:21] every cook,
[49:23] Lord, every maintenance man,
[49:27] the ministry that is here.
[49:30] May you strengthen us today. And Father,
[49:33] it's very apparent that our bodies are
[49:36] war a bit. My voice is tired,
[49:40] but God, you're the one that does the
[49:42] work. Yes,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; and we ask you now that as we come to
[49:46] this last service,
[49:49] we dedicate it to you.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And we ask you that you'd help us with
[49:53] this in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[49:56] Amen. And amen. Amen. Have you enjoyed
[50:00] it?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just share a scripture with
[50:04] you and then I want to share something
[50:06] special for you
[50:09] in just a moment.
[50:14] In Matthew chapter 6
[50:17] and verse 9
[50:21] this morning I would like to speak to
[50:22] you on driven.
[50:26] Driven
[50:28] God deposited something on the inside of
[50:32] you that has life within itself
[50:36] &gt;&gt; and it actually drives itself. It has a
[50:39] life that will drive itself. And I'd
[50:43] like to speak about that just a bit if I
[50:45] could if the Lord would give me strength
[50:47] just now.
[50:49] Now, this is Jesus to his disciples and
[50:52] now to you.
[50:55] And after this manner, therefore, pray
[50:57] ye.
[50:59] Our Father, which are in heaven,
[51:02] hallowed be thy name.
[51:05] Thy kingdom come,
[51:07] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[51:11] heaven.
[51:13] Give us this day our daily bread,
[51:17] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[51:19] our debtors,
[51:21] and lead us not into temptation,
[51:24] but deliver us from evil.
[51:27] For thou art the kingdom,
[51:32] for thine is the kingdom, and the power,
[51:35] and the glory forever.
[51:38] Amen. You may be seated.
[51:48] God knows what he has deposited here
[51:50] today.
[51:52] He knows where we're going to go from to
[51:55] and what he's placed on the inside of
[51:57] us.
[51:59] 10 years ago,
[52:03] I stood in this platform and I begin to
[52:05] speak.
[52:08] I'd like to just sometimes sometimes we
[52:10] just like to take a moment back and see
[52:12] where we were and where we are and then
[52:16] what God is projecting.
[52:19] Some of you say, "Well, I've never seen
[52:21] a miracle or I've never seen
[52:23] predestination at work or
[52:27] God commissioning at work, and I'm too
[52:30] young. I I'm too young to step into
[52:33] something like that." Okay. I believe we
[52:36] got a pretty good example for you today.
[52:40] Could we Could we share that just now?
[52:45] Amen.
[53:03] I'm going to finish with this tonight.
[53:05] I'm going to quit.
[53:09] Can you imagine
[53:15] before even time you start assembling an
[53:17] army of demons,
[53:22] you're cast into the earth.
[53:25] You spend 6,000 years
[53:28] banding and training and
[53:32] talking ABOUT WARFARE AND POSITION and
[53:37] anchoring against the bride.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Stay right there.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE SEALS ARE RELEASED AND YOU
[53:50] GET 200,000 MORE
[53:52] &gt;&gt; AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. OH YEAH.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; LOOSE FROM THE RIVER EUPHRATES.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; MHM.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; AND ALL HELL
[54:01] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; IS TURNED against that guy.
[54:07] DO YOU REALIZE HOW TERRIFIED
[54:11] &gt;&gt; he is of you?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; MEN STAND 7 FOOT TALL, DRIBBLE A BALL,
[54:32] PUT IN A BASKET.
[54:37] MEN LIFT WEIGHTS A,000 LBS OVER THEIR
[54:40] HEAD.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; THAT don't scare the devil.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; MEN HAVE 20 YEARS OF EDUCATION.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; CONFOUND THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND CAN'T
[54:53] FIND THEIR WAY ACROSS THE STREET.
[54:58] EINSTEIN GOT TOTALLY LOST ONE DAY AND HE
[55:01] CALLED HIS SECRETARY AND HE SAID, "CAN
[55:03] YOU TELL ME WHERE MR. EINSTEIN LIVES?"
[55:06] SHE SAID, "I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT
[55:07] INFORMATION." HE SAID, "THIS IS HIM."
[55:12] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT DON'T SCARE THE DEVIL.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT SCARES THE
[55:17] DEVIL.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I GOT ABOUT THIS TALK.
[55:35] HE KNOWS THIS LITTLE GUY RIGHT HERE.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; IS ARMED
[55:44] &gt;&gt; WITH ATOMIC POWER.
[55:50] And he KNOWS THAT JUST ANYTIME HE COULD
[55:53] DROP A BOTTLE.
[56:18] How tall are you?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Short.
[56:28] Shaquille O'Neal was not intimidated by
[56:30] him. That's right.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; His physique.
[56:35] The great whlers of the world pick him
[56:38] up and carry him around.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; But the classiest demons of hell
[56:50] &gt;&gt; watch him when his little eyelets go
[57:00] &gt;&gt; AND THEY GO, "HE'S AWAKE.
[57:20] HE GO MAY GO DOWN THE HALL and he starts
[57:22] singing, "This is the day.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; This is the day
[57:27] &gt;&gt; that the Lord has made."
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That the Lord has made.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Thank you.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I get excited.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; We shall rejoice.
[57:40] We shall rejoice and be glad in it.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; And be glad in it.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, THIS IS A DAY
[57:47] &gt;&gt; THAT THE Lord has
[57:50] &gt;&gt; and demons in another dimension start
[57:52] shaking.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; WHY, BROTHER RON? HE HAS AUTHORITY.
[58:03] THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE HAS ATOMIC
[58:05] POWER.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Right in his vocal course.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're nuts. I got kids in
[58:19] a kindergarten
[58:21] that stand up and says a teacher one day
[58:24] asked says
[58:26] he said he said uh he he asked HIM SOME
[58:29] QUESTION LIKE DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST
[58:31] SIN WAS? HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES.
[58:38] HE SAID IT WAS SEX.
[58:44] NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.
[58:52] LISTEN, THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
[58:54] TILL THEY GET OLD.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ANCHORED IN
[58:58] THEIR HEARTS.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIS AGE
[59:02] &gt;&gt; TO FULL MATURITY.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I know it's unfair. You won't get your
[59:12] driver's license, but you won't need it.
[59:34] Where's my call?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And that went just like that.
[59:47] How many of you were here in that tent?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, well, that was just
[59:57] an example.
[59:59] Did it come true?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Did it come true?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, it did.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; I'd say yes, it did.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; I'd say absolutely yes it did.
[1:00:13] Brother Brandham uses a term. He said
[1:00:16] what we choose today.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; What we have made decisions about today
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; is where we'll be five years from now.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Where will we be 10 years from now?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] Brother Brandom uh shares with us a not
[1:00:41] only a prophecy that was interpreted
[1:00:45] but it was also the mind of God.
[1:00:48] You have read it thousands of times but
[1:00:52] I want to share it with you
[1:00:55] because thou has chosen the narrow path
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; the harder way. Thou has walked in your
[1:01:03] own choosing.
[1:01:06] Thou has picked the the correct and
[1:01:09] precise decision
[1:01:12] and it is my way.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Because of this momentous decision,
[1:01:20] a huge portion of heaven will await
[1:01:24] thee.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision
[1:01:29] thou hast made.
[1:01:31] Thisid in itself is that which will give
[1:01:36] and make to come to pass
[1:01:40] the tremendous victory
[1:01:44] in the love divine.
[1:01:50] I cannot imagine what it felt like for
[1:01:54] our prophet
[1:01:57] getting toward the twilight of his years
[1:02:01] and knowing the end of his messages
[1:02:03] winding up.
[1:02:05] Brother Ernie forgod
[1:02:08] to speak those words to him. Yeah.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST WORDS OF PROPHECY, but words of
[1:02:18] reality.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; There are some words that we want to
[1:02:24] hear.
[1:02:27] Words from God himself.
[1:02:30] Well done.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Well done, thou good and faithful
[1:02:36] servant.
[1:02:39] I enjoy hearing your applause and I
[1:02:42] enjoy hearing your amens,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY heart
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; that there's a finish line.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A FINISH LINE COMING AND I WANT
[1:02:57] TO HEAR HIM SAY, "WELL DONE."
[1:03:02] BUT TO GET THERE, THERE'S MUCH strength
[1:03:05] and energy that's got to be exhausted.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VISION THAT GOD PUTS IN US, a
[1:03:12] drive that God puts in us, a zeal, a
[1:03:16] burden, and it must be accomplished.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; You see, THERE'S LIGHT INSIDE OF THAT
[1:03:22] SEED, AND IT'S GOT TO be expressed.
[1:03:25] every generation.
[1:03:27] You have you have watched this week. I
[1:03:31] have a father at home that believes this
[1:03:34] message with all of its his heart. I
[1:03:36] have a father-in-law that's in another
[1:03:38] dimension that preached this message for
[1:03:40] decades with all of his heart.
[1:03:44] I have I've had the privilege to speak
[1:03:46] this message and believe it with all of
[1:03:49] my heart AND TO WATCH MY SON SPEAK IT.
[1:03:54] I have another son at home that's
[1:03:56] speaking for our church tonight.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; BUT TO WATCH ANDREW SPEAK HERE ON THIS
[1:04:02] PLATFORM,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; THIS IS not generational handme-down.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; This isn't something that succeeds one
[1:04:09] another. It is God that calls. It is God
[1:04:13] that allotss. It is God that places the
[1:04:16] gift. It is GOD THAT PUTS THE SEED WHERE
[1:04:19] IT is and what it's going to do.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; If you can look back a few years and
[1:04:27] listened to 1963 and listen to sermons
[1:04:31] like it is the rising of the sun, IT WAS
[1:04:34] TALKING ABOUT YOUR PASTOR.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Your pastor's name was mentioned there.
[1:04:41] And here we are many years later and
[1:04:44] we're ALL BENEFITED BY THE ZEAL, THE
[1:04:47] DETERMINATION, the drive, THE
[1:04:51] ACCOMPLISHMENT, THE PURPOSE.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; SURE, THERE WILL BE DETRACTORS. AND
[1:04:56] SURE, THERE WILL BE CRITICS CUZ WE'VE
[1:04:58] ALL GOT TO GO THROUGH GOD'S HALL OF
[1:05:01] FAME.
[1:05:03] But let me just say this to you. I CAN'T
[1:05:06] SAY IT LIKE SOMEONE ELSE CAN SAY IT, BUT
[1:05:09] BROTHER ED BISLL, WELL DONE.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Sitting somewhere in the day today
[1:05:29] behind every great man is a great woman.
[1:05:34] True. And I can't pick her out with my
[1:05:36] eye, but
[1:05:38] I would say a queen of the earth,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; whom I have more respect for than all of
[1:05:44] London and definitely all of America.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to offend anybody in
[1:05:50] Canada, but we have a queen sitting
[1:05:53] among us.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Biscoff.
[1:06:09] I'll be leaving quickly in a car
[1:06:10] afterwards and they won't be able to
[1:06:12] whip me.
[1:06:16] Jesus turns to his disciples
[1:06:20] in Luke 9 in verse 23. And he said unto
[1:06:23] them all, "If any man will come after
[1:06:25] me, and let him deny himself,
[1:06:29] and take up his cross daily, and follow
[1:06:31] me, and whosoever will save his life
[1:06:34] shall lose it. For whosoever will lose
[1:06:37] his life for my sake, the same shall
[1:06:39] save it."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT IS A MAN ADVANTAGED IF HE GAIN
[1:06:44] the whole world and lose HIMSELF OR BE A
[1:06:48] cast away? I WOULDN'T TRADE THE BEST
[1:06:51] PIECE OF PROPERTY IN WASHINGTON or in
[1:06:54] Canada OR AMERICA,
[1:06:57] THE BEST HOUSE, THE BEST CASTLE.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; THE BEST JOB FOR THIS ETERNAL LIFE
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; that he has allowed me to live on this
[1:07:07] side.
[1:07:09] I WOULDN'T EXCHANGE ANYTHING, any
[1:07:12] relationship
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO SHARE ON
[1:07:19] THIS LIFE.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[1:07:26] of my works, of him shall the Son of man
[1:07:29] be ashamed, when he shall come into his
[1:07:32] own glory, and in his fathers of the and
[1:07:34] of the holy angels. But I tell of you of
[1:07:37] a truth, that there be cell some
[1:07:40] standing here THAT SHALL NOT TASTE OF
[1:07:43] death till they see the kingdom of God.
[1:07:48] Second Timothy 4 and verse 1, the
[1:07:51] Apostle Paul is realizing
[1:07:55] he's coming to the end of his course and
[1:07:57] he's now going to share some words. HE
[1:08:00] SAID, 'I CHARGE THEE BEFORE GOD AND THE
[1:08:03] LORD Jesus Christ,
[1:08:05] WHO SHALL JUDGE THE THE QUICK AND THE
[1:08:08] dead at his appearing and at HIS
[1:08:09] KINGDOM, PREACH THE WORD.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST TO BE MEN
[1:08:16] SITTING ON A PULLPIT.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; LADIES, YOU ARE THE FIFTH GOSPEL IN YOUR
[1:08:22] HOME.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? LET ME TO SAY A MOST OF
[1:08:27] GOD'S WORK IS TO BE LIVED.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A PREACHER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE
[1:08:35] YOU EXEMPT.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A SINGER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
[1:08:38] EXEMPT.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A BROOM.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A SHOVEL. SOMETIMES IT'S
[1:08:46] TO BE THE TAPE MAN. SOMETIMES IT'S TO BE
[1:08:48] THIS GUY AND THAT GUY AND JUST TO PUT
[1:08:51] YOUR HANDS TO THE PLOW AND DO IT WITH
[1:08:54] EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN YOU.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT A HALFHEARTED, HALF
[1:09:00] COMMITTED. Are you with me now? SO MANY
[1:09:03] TIMES OUR MARRIAGES STRUGGLE BECAUSE
[1:09:04] WE'RE HALF COMMITTED.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; OUR CHILDREN SEE US HALF COMMITTED.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SUFFER FROM THAT.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; YOU SUFFER FROM THAT.
[1:09:19] GOD WANTS OUR WHOLE HEART.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He wants our whole heart.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; When Jesus turns around and tells his
[1:09:30] disciples,
[1:09:32] "TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME."
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT HE COULD REALIZE IF HE COULD. I
[1:09:41] DON'T KNOW WHAT PARTICULAR God showed
[1:09:43] him at this point, BUT THESE MEN
[1:09:46] STANDING IN THIS circle
[1:09:50] that had LEFT FAMILY, THEY HAD LEFT
[1:09:52] HOME, THEY HAD LEFT OCCUPATION,
[1:09:56] THEY HAD LEFT INCREDIBLE THINGS IN THEIR
[1:09:58] LIVES, BUT THEY DROPPED IT ALL TO FOLLOW
[1:10:01] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THEM HAD
[1:10:05] RESPONDED
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; AND ALL BUT ONE WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE
[1:10:09] FOR JESUS CHRIST BY MARTYRDOM. SOME OF
[1:10:13] THEIR HEADS WOULD BE DRUGGED THROUGH THE
[1:10:15] STREET. But they WERE NOT ASHAMED. PETER
[1:10:18] WOULD SAY, "I I'M NOT WORTHY TO BE
[1:10:20] CRUCIFIED LIKE MY LORD. TURN ME UPSIDE
[1:10:23] DOWN."
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Think of the price.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; THINK OF THE COST.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:33] YOUR cross
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and you're driven to it.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; You're driven to it.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Your passion,
[1:10:46] YOU HAVE DETERMINED, I'LL NOT LET
[1:10:48] NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND GOD.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; COULD I JUST SAY THIS IN THIS TENT THIS
[1:10:55] MORNING? YOUNG PEOPLE, DON'T LET NOTHING
[1:10:58] GET BETWEEN YOU AND GOD.
[1:11:03] CAN YOU ECHO THAT WITH AN AMEN? I'M NOT
[1:11:06] GOING TO LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND
[1:11:09] GOD.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; NOTHING.
[1:11:21] FIGHT.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course.
[1:11:28] I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WE COULD LIVE A LIFE OF NO
[1:11:33] REGRET.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK IN OUR LIFE
[1:11:40] AND AT EVERY JUNCTURE OF OUR LIFE, WE'VE
[1:11:42] GIVE OUR ALL.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW CAN WE DO THAT? MAYBE YOU
[1:11:47] HAVEN'T DONE IT IN THE PAST, BUT WHAT
[1:11:49] ABOUT TODAY? STARTING FROM THIS JOURNEY,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; FROM THIS WEEK,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; FROM THIS TIME,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; MAYBE IN THE PAST, BUT GOD'S CALLING
[1:11:58] YOU. GOD'S CALLED TO JOHN, COME UP
[1:12:02] HITHER.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; AND HE BECKONED HIM TO PULL INTO ANOTHER
[1:12:06] REALM. COME AND SEE.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS YOUR TURN TO ALLOW GOD TO REACH
[1:12:13] INTO YOUR LIVES. BRICKMASONS,
[1:12:16] CARPENTERS,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; ELECTRICIANS,
[1:12:19] Y
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS IN LIFE. WELL, BROTHER, I
[1:12:27] DON'T SEE MYSELF DOING ANYTHING, BUT YOU
[1:12:30] DEPOSIT TITHES AND YOU DEPOSIT OFFERINGS
[1:12:32] AND IT GOES TOWARD THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[1:12:35] AND MEN GO OVERSEAS AND MEN HAND OUT
[1:12:38] TRACKS AND MEN HAND OUT BOOKS AND MEN
[1:12:41] PREACH THE GOSPEL WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS
[1:12:43] AND YOU'RE A PART OF THAT.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WHATEVER IT IS, PUT
[1:12:50] YOUR WHOLE HEART BEHIND IT.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I'm with you.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; IN THE OLYMPICS, WE ALL WANT TO SEE THE
[1:12:57] GUY THAT FINISHES AND HE GETS THE GOLD
[1:13:00] AROUND HIM. BUT LET ME JUST SAY, HE
[1:13:02] DIDN'T START THERE.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T START THERE. THERE WAS AN
[1:13:07] INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT WENT
[1:13:10] ON TO GET HIM WHERE HE'S AT. SOMETHING
[1:13:13] ON THE INSIDE OF HIM BE TO SWELL UP THAT
[1:13:17] HE COULD RUN OR IT could swim or it
[1:13:20] could jump.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM CAUSED
[1:13:26] HIM TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND AND ABOVE AND
[1:13:29] beyond and above and beyond.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; There ought to be SOMETHING ON THE
[1:13:33] INSIDE OF YOU. FROM GLORY TO GLORY, FROM
[1:13:37] GLORY TO GLORY, FROM GLORY TO GLORY.
[1:13:40] HE'S CHANGING ME. Yes sir.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; I have fought a good fight.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith.
[1:14:09] Brother Ron, but I'd like to see this
[1:14:10] one and that one. What about you?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, IF THIS ONE WOULD HAVE ONLY DONE
[1:14:17] SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[1:14:21] OH, IF THAT ONE IF YOU KNOW I'M I'M GOT
[1:14:23] MY EYE ON THIS ONE OR THAT ONE. IF THEY
[1:14:25] WOULD DO IT, I WOULD DO IT.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO USE YOU. YEAH.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR, BUT GOD
[1:14:42] WANTS TO USE YOU.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; GOD'S DETERMINED to have A VOICE,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; AND HE CHOSE YOU TO BE THAT VOICE. YOUR
[1:14:50] HANDS.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Look at your hands.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hello. Look at your hands.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Your feet. Yeah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO USE YOUR AMEN.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; He wants TO HEAR YOUR VOICE COMING
[1:15:11] THROUGH THE BLOOD.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; HE'S DETERMINED. THERE'S TWO IN THE BED.
[1:15:16] ONE WILL BE TAKEN. I'M DETERMINED TO BE
[1:15:18] ONE.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Two in THE FIELD. I'M DETERMINED TO BE
[1:15:22] THE ONE THAT'S TAKEN.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Two at the MILL WORKING. I'M DETERMINED
[1:15:27] TO BE THE ONE THAT CATCHES THE
[1:15:30] REVELATION OF THE RAPTURE OF THIS DAY.
[1:15:33] I'M DETERMINED.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; HE'S PUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME
[1:15:38] THAT RESPONDS TO THE WORD OF THE HOUR.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; AND I'M DETERMINED TO GIVE IT MY ALL.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your work.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your encouragement.
[1:16:00] Sometimes
[1:16:04] sitting in the stands are people that
[1:16:06] are encouraers.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL we'll
[1:16:14] get the point to where that let somebody
[1:16:16] else do it.
[1:16:21] WE'LL JUST LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT. YOU
[1:16:23] KNOW, let somebody else go do that.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; But what about you?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[1:16:35] I want to challenge you today when you
[1:16:37] go look in the mirror.
[1:16:40] ASK THAT MAN IN THE MIRROR, WHAT ARE YOU
[1:16:42] DOING?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; AND TAKE ALL THE EXCUSES THAT YOU'VE
[1:16:47] BEEN GIVING yourself and THROW THEM IN
[1:16:50] THE TRASH CAN.
[1:16:53] BALL THEM UP AND SAY, "I'M DONE WITH MY
[1:16:55] EXCUSES.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'M DONE WITH MY EXCUSES. IF I'VE GOT 10
[1:17:01] YEARS LEFT IN LIFE, IF I'VE GOT 20 YEARS
[1:17:03] LEFT IN LIFE, IF I'VE GOT 80 YEARS LEFT
[1:17:06] in life, I WANT TO SERVE GOD WITH
[1:17:08] EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN ME."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, is that A PEP TALK? WELL,
[1:17:19] IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT
[1:17:21] TO TAKE IT,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ENCOURAGE you today.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Run.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; RUN.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; OTHERS HAVE RAN.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN TO RUN.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WAITING ON SOMEBODY ELSE TO
[1:17:37] RUN. IT'S YOUR TURN.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; THE SEED THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU DOESN'T
[1:17:41] HAVE TO BE PUMPED UP AND PRIMED UP AND
[1:17:44] IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL THE TIME, YOU
[1:17:46] KNOW, GET YOURSELF MOVING. LET THAT LIFE
[1:17:49] LIVE. AND PAUL SAY ON THE INSIDE OF your
[1:17:53] life.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Paul said it and I read it earlier this
[1:18:01] week, but I felt it imperative to read
[1:18:03] it today. I press
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; TOWARD THE MARK OF THE HIGH calling
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:18:13] in CHRIST JESUS.
[1:18:16] I PRESS.
[1:18:19] Brother Random SAID THE CHURCH IS NOT
[1:18:21] recognized today. LIKE ISRAEL BACK IN
[1:18:24] THE PROMISED LAND. SHE DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:18:27] SHE GOT BACK THERE.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS JUST AUTOMATICALLY PUT BY THERE.
[1:18:31] WHY? NATIONAL FORCE HAS PUT HER IN HER
[1:18:33] PLACE.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO SAY SOMETHING. NATIONAL
[1:18:36] FORCE WILL PUT ISRAEL in her homeland.
[1:18:39] NATIONAL FORCE WILL PUT THE church in
[1:18:41] the world council of churches. BUT THE
[1:18:43] POWER OF GOD WILL PUT THE PEOPLE IN the
[1:18:47] bride.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD FORCES THIS WAY AND THE WORLD
[1:18:50] FORCES THAT WAY, BUT GOD FORCES UPWARD.
[1:18:54] THE SPIRIT OF GOD, WHICH IS THE WORD OF
[1:18:56] GOD, MY word is SPIRIT AND LIFE, WILL
[1:18:59] PUT THE BRIDE IN HER PLACE CUZ SHE'LL
[1:19:01] RECOGNIZE her position in the word AND
[1:19:04] SHE'S IN CHRIST, WILL PUT HER IN HER
[1:19:06] PLACE. NO NATIONAL FORCE WILL DO IT,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; BUT THE NATIONAL FORCE WILL DRIVE ISRAEL
[1:19:11] TO HER HOMELAND. NATIONAL FORCES WILL OF
[1:19:14] the church of the the the COUNCIL OF
[1:19:16] CHURCHES WILL DRIVE EVERY ORGANIZATION
[1:19:18] INTO IT. BUT THE POWER OF GOD WILL RAISE
[1:19:22] THE BRIDE INTO GLORY OUT OF IT.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Oh people RECOGNIZE YOUR DAY. JESUS HAS
[1:19:29] WARNED YOU THE SIGN OF SODOM AND THE
[1:19:32] CHURCH'S CONDITION of this day.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:42] BUT IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE
[1:19:45] of the seventh angel,
[1:19:47] WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN TO SOUND, THE
[1:19:49] MYSTERY OF GOD SHOULD BE FINISHED, AS he
[1:19:53] declared to his servants, the prophets,
[1:19:55] and the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:19:58] spake unto me again, and said, GO, AND
[1:20:00] TAKE THE LITTLE BOOK WHICH IS OPEN IN
[1:20:03] THE HAND OF THE ANGEL, WHICH STANDETH
[1:20:05] UPON THE SEA, and upon the earth. And I
[1:20:08] went unto THE ANGEL THAT SAID UNTO ME,
[1:20:11] "GET ME THE LITTLE BOOK." AND HE SAID
[1:20:13] UNTO ME, "TAKE IT AND EAT IT UP." WHAT
[1:20:17] DOES THIS MESSAGE SAY FOR ME?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THIS MESSAGE SAY FOR ME? DON'T
[1:20:24] JUST TAKE THE PREACHER'S WORDS FOR IT.
[1:20:27] EAT THE BOOK.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Spend your time eating THE BOOK.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE BOOK. AMEN.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; LET THE BOOK LIVE OUT OF YOU.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; To him that overcometh.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; I trust in lay odyssey of the darkest
[1:20:48] age that there's ever been. There will
[1:20:51] be people
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE
[1:20:54] FINAL AGE.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; There will be final runners.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; There will be.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; There will be.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; There will be a bride. Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; There will be overcomers of this age.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; WE WILL HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE
[1:21:11] CONDITIONS OF LEODYSA. And you by now
[1:21:14] know every one of them that are that are
[1:21:16] against you. BUT GOD HAS BUILT YOU TO
[1:21:19] OVERCOME. AMEN.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SAT SHOULDER TOSH shoulder and
[1:21:26] you have maybe you never knew that
[1:21:28] person's name before this week, BUT
[1:21:30] YOU'VE SAT SHOULDERTOSH SHOULDER BESIDE
[1:21:33] OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BUILT TO OVERCOME
[1:21:35] THIS AGE.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE YOU'RE BESIDE ONE ANOTHER.
[1:21:42] ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER. STRENGTHEN FOR
[1:21:45] ONE ANOTHER. PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER.
[1:21:49] WE'RE BUILT TO OVERCOME THIS AGE. We're
[1:21:52] eagles.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; The scripture bears out and it begins to
[1:21:58] say this, and forgive me for MY
[1:22:00] REDUNDANCY, THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED
[1:22:02] which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.
[1:22:05] For verily I SAY UNTO YOU, till heaven
[1:22:07] and earth one jot or ONE TIT SHALL IN NO
[1:22:10] WISE PAY IT PASS AWAY UNTIL THE law till
[1:22:13] it might be fulfilled.
[1:22:16] Matthew 8:17 that it was might be
[1:22:18] fulfilled WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE
[1:22:20] PROPHET ISAIAH THE PROPHET SAYING
[1:22:23] HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND bear
[1:22:25] sickness that it might be FULFILLED IN
[1:22:27] MATTHEW 12 which is spoken by Isaiah the
[1:22:30] prophet in Matthew 13 and in them IS F
[1:22:35] FULFILLED THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH WHICH
[1:22:38] SAID BY HEARING YOU shall hear and shall
[1:22:41] not understand and see and you shall see
[1:22:43] and not perceive IN IN VERSE 35 THAT IT
[1:22:46] MIGHT BE FULFILLED.
[1:22:49] Matthew 21 verse4 all of this WAS DONE
[1:22:53] THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED
[1:22:56] IN IN IN 24 VERSE 34 VERELY I SAY UNTO
[1:23:01] YOU NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU THIS
[1:23:04] GENERATION SHALL NOT pass
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; till all things
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; all things
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; be fulfilled
[1:23:22] GOD IS DETERMINED.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS. YES, HE IS.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; GOD IS DETERMINED.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Did you watch 10 years ago?
[1:23:33] Boom. That's like a second to God.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; That's like a millisecond to God.
[1:23:46] AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; But in that spans, MANY HAVE FULFILLED
[1:23:54] JUDAS.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; AND EVEN JESUS TOLD JUDAS,
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; "WHAT YOU DO, DO QUICKLY."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY DID THEY RUN
[1:24:08] AWAY? AND WHY DID THEY SCORN? AND WHY
[1:24:10] DID THEY MOCK? AND WHY ARE THEY
[1:24:12] DETERMINED TO DESTROY US? THEY HAD TO
[1:24:16] FULFILL SCRIPTURE.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH TO YOU MY HEART
[1:24:24] HERE FOR just a bit.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE.
[1:24:36] THE OVERCOMERS OF THIS DAY.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL PUT THIS DRESS ON AND IT FITS.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; IT WAS MORE THAN A STORY. BROTHER
[1:24:45] BRANDON TALKING ABOUT THE ARMOR AND
[1:24:46] COMPANY, SON. AND THAT LITTLE GIRL
[1:24:49] RECEIVING THE THE THE MAN AT THE CORRAL
[1:24:53] AND HE KISSING HER ON THE CHEEK AND SAY,
[1:24:55] "I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU IN A YEAR." AND
[1:24:57] SHE TESTIFIED FOR A YEAR. AND SHE GOT
[1:24:59] HERSELF READY. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS
[1:25:02] TO YOU, HER HEART WAS BURDENED WITH
[1:25:04] ZEAL. I'M GOING TO BE HIS WIFE.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE DEPOSITED INSIDE OF HER WAS A
[1:25:13] PROMISE. I'M COMING BACK FOR YOU. GOD
[1:25:16] HAS DETERMINED AND DEPOSITED ON THE
[1:25:19] INSIDE OF YOU A PROMISE.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:26] G.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Let them sit on the porch and laugh and
[1:25:31] make fun of you.
[1:25:39] Just stand there and in the dress
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; somewhere in the
[1:25:51] Hollywood world they come up with a with
[1:25:54] a saying yes to the dress.
[1:26:00] Well, they stole that from us.
[1:26:06] WE SAID YES TO THIS DRESS.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; WE SAID YES TO THIS DRESS.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; AND THIS DRESS FITS VERY WELL.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; THIS DRESS FITS VERY WELL. I'VE NEVER
[1:26:21] SAID THAT from a pull pit. Hope I don't
[1:26:23] get in trouble.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; IT FITS.
[1:26:29] GOD'S IN HIS DRESS WEAR
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; THEM FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; AND SERVICE AFTER SERVICE WE WERE
[1:26:38] ENCOURAGED AND WE WERE STRENGTHENED AND
[1:26:41] WE WERE CUT AND WE WERE PRICRICKED IN
[1:26:43] OUR HEART AND WE RESPONDED WHAT SHOULD
[1:26:47] WE DO
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I'm thrilled TO HEAR THERE ARE SOME
[1:26:50] YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SAYS WHAT CAN I DO I
[1:26:54] want to REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE
[1:26:57] NAME OF THE LORD JESUS JESUS CHRIST FOR
[1:26:59] THE REMISSION OF MY SINS. AND THEN THE
[1:27:02] PROMISE IS THAT I WILL RECEIVE THE GIFT
[1:27:05] OF THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THIS PROMISE IS
[1:27:08] UNTO YOU AND TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO all
[1:27:10] that are a far off, EVEN AS MANY AS THE
[1:27:13] LORD OUR GOD SHALL CALL. WE ARE
[1:27:15] FULFILLING SCRIPTURE TODAY.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; What's going on in Uganda?
[1:27:26] It's the BOOK OF ACTS.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHINA? IT'S THE BOOK
[1:27:31] OF ACTS.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON IN CLOVERDALE? WHAT'S
[1:27:35] GOING ON AT MOUNT BAKER CAMP? WHAT'S
[1:27:38] GOING ON IN ELTON, VIRGINIA? IT'S THE
[1:27:40] BOOK OF ACTS.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S HIM THAT IS AMONG US. IT'S HIM
[1:27:45] THAT'S AT our homes.
[1:27:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS COMING. BUT HE HAS COME
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's more than a quote.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; More than a quote. We're bone of his
[1:28:15] bone. All right.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Life of his life,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; power of his power,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; spirit of his spirit.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; WE'RE THE VEILED FLESH THAT GOD WANTS TO
[1:28:28] DWELL INSIDE OF.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD ONLY GET BEYOND yourself
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; in A DAY OF SELFISHNESS AND A DAY OF
[1:28:37] PERSONAL AMBITION.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:46] I'm not going to be much longer.
[1:28:50] I think
[1:28:55] I touched on something last night that's
[1:28:57] mind-blowing.
[1:28:59] How can the scripture just blows my
[1:29:02] mind?
[1:29:04] How could people come to a meeting
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; where the resurrection was at
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; right
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; and THE ONE THAT CALLED THE RESURRECTION
[1:29:15] forth and the resurrected Lazarus
[1:29:20] BE IN THE SAME room
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; and yet they would want to kill him.
[1:29:29] Y
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME SPIRIT OF THIS MODERN
[1:29:34] CHURCH.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANAL
[1:29:39] CALLED OUT AGAINST IT OVER AND OVER AND
[1:29:42] OVER AGAIN THAT THE MODERN CHURCH IS
[1:29:44] PRODUCING STILLBORN CHILDREN.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHERE THERE
[1:29:50] WAS NO EMOTION, THERE'S NO LIFE."
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; This ain't a good morning TO GET QUIET.
[1:29:58] WHERE THERE'S NO EMOTION, THERE'S NO
[1:30:00] LIFE.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
[1:30:06] 40 YEARS AGO OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I
[1:30:08] DID 10 YEARS AGO. WHAT ABOUT NOW?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; WE BURY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO LIFE.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; AND MANY PEOPLE SIT IN SERVICES WITH
[1:30:18] THEIR ARMS CROSSED
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID YEARS AGO. SAT
[1:30:24] THERE WITH NO REVIVAL IN THEIR LIVES.
[1:30:31] WELL, I HOPE THE KIDS GET IT. WHAT ABOUT
[1:30:33] YOU?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS WORD?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I CAN
[1:30:51] SEE IT BY YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:55] YES, SIR.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; YOUR CHILDREN ARE HALF-HEARTED JUST LIKE
[1:31:01] YOU ARE.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; THE REASON THEY HAVE NO BURDEN, YOU HAVE
[1:31:09] NO BURDEN.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; LET'S TEAR DOWN CHAINS TODAY.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I JUST RECYCLE. I JUST KEEP
[1:31:20] RECYCLING. I GO FROM ONE REVIVAL TO
[1:31:23] ANOTHER REVIVAL AND I KEEP FALLING INTO
[1:31:25] PROBLEMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. GET UP.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; GET UP. GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; LAY YOUR PROBLEMS DOWN.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; AND COMMIT YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST
[1:31:41] LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; I'VE TOLD MY FAMILY THERE IS NO COATTAIL
[1:31:49] RELIGION. RIGHT.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; There is no cocktail religion.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HANG ON MY EXPERIENCE. YOU
[1:32:01] HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; So many times we let things GET BY
[1:32:15] BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST SAT IN a pew for 30
[1:32:17] years.
[1:32:19] But really what you did is you sat in a
[1:32:21] pew,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Came to the dress code,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; came to the doctrine ORDER, BUT YOU
[1:32:27] DON'T HAVE LIFE.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL OUT TO YOU TODAY?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL OUT TO YOU TODAY?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'VE DONE PREACHED THIS WAY TOO
[1:32:38] LONG NOW.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'VE SEEN MOMS AND DAD WALKED TO
[1:32:41] THE ALTAR AFTER YEARS AND THEY LOOK LIKE
[1:32:44] PILLARS AND THEY LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,
[1:32:46] "I GOT TO HAVE MORE." AMEN.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO JUST GET TIME
[1:32:51] BOOKED AGAINST ME AND TIME AND I'VE SAT
[1:32:53] HERE AND I PUT EFFORT FORTH, BUT I NEED
[1:32:55] A FRESH EXPERIENCE WITH WITH THE WORD.
[1:32:58] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WE NEED TO BRING
[1:33:01] JESUS CHRIST A FRESH DRINK OF
[1:33:03] PENTECOSTAL WATER.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Don't label me Pentecostal.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T LABEL ME WITH SOME OF YOUR YOUR
[1:33:14] LABELS THAT YOU'D LIKE to label we me
[1:33:16] right now. LET ME TO SAY THIS TO YOU.
[1:33:18] IT'S YOU THAT NEEDS TO BRING GOD A FRESH
[1:33:21] DRINK.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Not some redundant PRAYER THAT YOU
[1:33:25] PRAYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR HAVEN'T
[1:33:28] LISTENED TO A TAPE IN FOREVER.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I CHALLENGE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; SHAKE YOURSELF.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; RUN.
[1:33:47] RUN.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; MEN LIKE JOHN WESLEY PREACHED 88,000
[1:33:54] SERMONS.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; MEN LIKE PETER CARTRIGHT BAPTIZED 12,000
[1:33:58] PEOPLE.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; MEN TRANSLATED THE BIBLE 42 DIFFERENT
[1:34:06] LANGUAGES.
[1:34:08] WHEN I WAS IN IN CHINA WITH BROTHER
[1:34:10] MURPHY WONG, MY HEART SWELL BECAUSE
[1:34:14] MURPHY WONG IS MY FRIEND.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S GIVE HIS LIFE.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE ANOTHER HE WAS LIKE YOU AND HE
[1:34:23] SAID, "I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE."
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Where's Murphy's children now?
[1:34:35] Could
[1:34:37] you stand now? Could you stand?
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Your turn.

[1:35:25] Silus.
[1:35:34] It's your turn.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Stage is too small. All right. Have you
[1:35:48] come
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; stay right there
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; from Chile?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You come here.
[1:36:04] Oh, what a good-look boy.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Starting today.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; I can see it all over you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Are you being baptized today?
[1:36:29] But you're starting your journey today.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Today.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:36:56] Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; How old are you?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; 13.

[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But that's boys.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, good. I'm glad you asked.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; How old are you?
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; 15.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:37:26] How old are you?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; 12.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; 12.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; God wants you.
[1:37:37] A model.
[1:37:39] He wants a model of Christianity.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll have her." What's
[1:37:44] your name?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Aaliyah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Aaliyah.
[1:37:48] I got some Aaliyah in my life.
[1:37:52] I want Aaliyah to represent me
[1:37:56] more than a quote, more than a tape,
[1:37:58] more than a picture on the wall,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; but I want an Aaliyah to represent me.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Could you stand?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; You have stood. And I'm not going to ask
[1:38:11] you how old you are.
[1:38:28] It's your turn.
[1:38:52] You be the light in the darkness. Is
[1:38:55] that not what was said to you?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Is that not what was said to you?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; You be the light in the darkness.
[1:39:07] Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And she found her turn.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand now.
[1:39:44] I watched in China
[1:39:47] people crawl from the back to the front.
[1:39:52] You can edit this if you like, but
[1:39:55] brother Murphy said they knew. I said,
[1:39:57] "What was the pull?" He said, "Brother
[1:39:59] Ron, they're willing to be arrested,
[1:40:03] but they so want to hear the word of
[1:40:05] God.
[1:40:08] Take all of your excuses away and throw
[1:40:11] them.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS
[1:40:17] WORD."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Your turn, brother Ron. That's simple.
[1:40:27] It's not so simple for her.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; You be the light in the darkness.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; It's not so simple for Murphy Wong.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE FOR YOU, BROTHER
[1:40:42] STEVEN.
[1:40:45] When you grab a hold of this word
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; and you REALIZE THIS WORD HAS ETERNAL
[1:40:50] VALUE TO IT,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; AND THIS WORD WILL BE YOUR BANKER. IT'LL
[1:40:55] BE YOUR LAWYER. IT'LL BE YOUR DOCTOR.
[1:40:58] IT'LL BE YOUR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR. IT'LL
[1:41:00] BE YOUR GUIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK
[1:41:02] NIGHT. IT'LL BE EVERYTHING TO YOU.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Could we end this service with I COMMIT
[1:41:10] MY LIFE TO THIS WORD.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; I totally commit my life.
[1:41:24] A sister to a sister, a brother to a
[1:41:26] brother.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Could you just join one another's hand
[1:41:29] now? Right where you are.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] What a presence of God in this building.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Noah committed his way to God
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; and God provided an ark.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; We commit our hands into you, Lord God.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; We commit our mind, our heart, our
[1:42:10] energies
[1:42:21] I commit myself to you, oh God.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I surrender my all to you just now.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't know particularly what
[1:42:33] lays in my future, but God, you are my
[1:42:36] everything. You are the breath that I
[1:42:39] breathe. YOU'RE THE THOUGHTS THAT I
[1:42:41] THINK. YOU'RE THE SONGS THAT I SING.
[1:42:44] YOU'RE THE WORDS THAT I preach.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You are my everything, dear God.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, I STAND WITH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:42:55] THAT ARE HERE TODAY.
[1:42:57] LORD, 10 YEARS AGO, I STOOD WITH
[1:42:59] MICHAEL. 10 years ago, Michael Ray
[1:43:04] was here. Joe Ray was here. MY SON
[1:43:07] RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN THAT MEETING.
[1:43:10] OH GOD, WE CELEBRATE THIS MOMENT.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT'S DONE IT ALL.
[1:43:20] FATHER,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; young or old,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; we commit our life to you.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; We surrender our life to you.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; We give our all to you just now.
[1:43:37] We place it into your hands.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT'S SOMEONE JUST STARTING OUT.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; LORD, I PRAY THAT THEY JUST COMMIT THEIR
[1:43:46] LIFE NOW.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; FATHER, forgive them of their sins.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Let them WALK A NEW AND ARESH.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; touch their lives this evening
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ name.
[1:44:07] In Jesus Christ's name.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ name.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Driven.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; We're driven.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; David Mayor. We're driven.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; We're driven.
[1:44:34] You call your name right there. I'm
[1:44:36] driven.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; I'm driven.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; You call your name.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; You call your name.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Now it's an exercise. You call your
[1:44:50] name.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Ron Spencer,
[1:44:54] you're driven.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voices. Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; I refuse to quit.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I refuse TO GO BACK. THERE'S NOTHING TO
[1:45:11] GO BACK TO.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN AWAITS.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; A NEW BODY AWAITS.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; ALL THESE FORMER THINGS WILL BE PASSED
[1:45:21] AWAY.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I'm driven to it. Amen.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not a good singer, but could I sing
[1:45:29] this this morning? On the wings of a
[1:45:32] snow white dove.
[1:45:37] What a presence.
[1:45:41] It's just been on my heart. It's just
[1:45:44] been on my heart.
[1:45:48] Our journey
[1:45:56] our journey.
[1:45:59] We can look back and look where we are
[1:46:01] now. It's been God that's got us to this
[1:46:04] point.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; I can look back in my life
[1:46:10] and it's been all God.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I owe my life to God.
[1:46:17] I owe the rest of my life to God
[1:46:21] on the wings of snow.
[1:46:25] I
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; could we stand and worship. God sends
[1:46:30] his pure sweet
[1:46:34] love
[1:46:36] a sign from above
[1:46:43] on the wings of
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Could we sing that verse? Though I have
[1:46:50] suffered.
[1:46:52] Oh, I have suffered
[1:46:58] in many
[1:47:00] ways.
[1:47:05] I cry for
[1:47:10] that.
[1:47:12] All night
[1:47:18] he was for
[1:47:25] my father.
[1:47:31] Oh, he gave me
[1:47:38] on the wings.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Let's sing him with all of our hearts.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; On the wings of the snow.
[1:47:53] Bless his
[1:47:56] sweet.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Won't you just welcome him to where
[1:48:11] you're at now?
[1:48:13] All the winds of the snow
[1:48:22] is your sweet.
[1:48:41] Oh
[1:48:45] my
[1:48:47] love
[1:48:50] is your
[1:48:52] sweet
[1:48:53] love.
[1:49:09] Oh, I am drifting
[1:49:15] on the last day.
[1:49:22] He search for
[1:49:29] in
[1:49:31] way.
[1:49:48] Oh God,
[1:49:55] on the wings of a
[1:50:01] Oh, on the wings of a snow.
[1:50:09] God says his pure
[1:50:12] sweet
[1:50:14] love a sign
[1:50:22] on the wings.
[1:50:28] Have you accepted the challenge this
[1:50:30] morning?
[1:50:33] Brother Abby Biscll just leaned over to
[1:50:35] me and Sister Joanne just wanted to
[1:50:38] reaffirm we just had a group of our
[1:50:41] people just make it across the line to
[1:50:43] be in the service right now.
[1:50:48] I believe they deserve our appreciation.
[1:51:06] You get very humbled
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; and people want to just come and be in
[1:51:12] the presence of God.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; We made it and they struggled to be
[1:51:17] here. just at the closing words of
[1:51:20] brother Spencer's service.
[1:51:23] My prayer is, oh God, would you bless
[1:51:26] them?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Would you pour out upon them that they
[1:51:31] couldn't even contain it?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; We thank you for your effort.
[1:51:38] We thank you for doing this.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Just driving up to the last moments.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; It means something to me. And God bless
[1:51:48] you for it.
[1:51:50] And may the wings of a dove, may the
[1:51:52] presence of God fill you,
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; strengthen you.
[1:51:58] God can work in a supernatural realm
[1:52:00] that we know nothing of. We We sat here
[1:52:03] and we ba bast in the presence of God,
[1:52:06] but he could just come right by your way
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; and give you everything we got.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; He can do that for you at this time.
[1:52:17] That is that not humbling?
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; That's what makes this little church
[1:52:23] special to me.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody doing their best,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; giving their all. I would say to brother
[1:52:31] Spencer, we are a driven church
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and we will be driven
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; if God should give us a few more days,
[1:52:41] weeks, months, or years. driven
[1:52:45] to proclaim this gospel, driven to get
[1:52:49] this message around the world.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Look what it's done to us. If he can do
[1:52:56] it to me, he can do it to anybody.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And may God raise up young men and young
[1:53:02] ladies to be driven.
[1:53:10] Ah, brother Ron said, there's an
[1:53:13] expression
[1:53:15] saying yes to the dress.
[1:53:19] And if that is an expression that
[1:53:20] somebody's borrowed, they can have it.
[1:53:23] But I want you to know, I've said yes to
[1:53:25] this dress a long time ago.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; God's given to the church apostles,
[1:53:32] prophets, evangelists, pastors,
[1:53:35] preachers,
[1:53:36] teachers.
[1:53:38] We're thankful for men of God that can
[1:53:40] stand and proclaim this message. We're
[1:53:44] thankful for everyone that has come in
[1:53:46] this camp.
[1:53:49] We can't possibly
[1:53:52] name everyone.
[1:53:54] And in doing that, of course, you miss
[1:53:56] someone.
[1:53:59] But my God that I serve
[1:54:03] knows everyone
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; that put an effort
[1:54:07] to make this camp what it is.
[1:54:11] From the kitchen to the pre-planning to
[1:54:14] everything you've enjoyed,
[1:54:17] there has been brothers and sisters that
[1:54:18] have worked months to make this happen.
[1:54:23] And it would be it would we be dilatory
[1:54:26] not to be able to thank those people
[1:54:28] whether they be in the kitchen or the
[1:54:30] brother brother David Walners and his
[1:54:32] sister Jana Wal Waldner's that have
[1:54:34] worked behind the scenes picking up your
[1:54:38] garbage.
[1:54:43] Listen,
[1:54:45] I have a hard time picking up my own
[1:54:47] garbage at home.
[1:54:50] And these brothers have picked up their
[1:54:52] garbage. All your garbage around here.
[1:54:55] You say, "Well, that wasn't anything."
[1:54:57] I'll tell you that was eternal.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; That was eternal. As brother Spencer
[1:55:03] said, everybody has been doing their
[1:55:06] part.
[1:55:08] And from the bottom of my heart,
[1:55:11] I want to thank every counselor, sound
[1:55:14] people, video,
[1:55:17] all that work behind to make the junior
[1:55:20] camp happen and senior camp happen. All
[1:55:23] I want to do is throw up my hand and
[1:55:25] say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; You gave us another year, a blessed
[1:55:31] time.
[1:55:34] Thank you for men of God that ministered
[1:55:36] the word of God. And
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; thank you for opening my heart and my
[1:55:39] ears to hear what the spirit would say.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I am more determined after this set of
[1:55:50] services to serve God with all my heart,
[1:55:52] mind, soul, and strength.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Are you young people
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; going to leave it to somebody else? Or
[1:56:00] are you going to take up the torch? You
[1:56:03] going to take up the banner? Are you
[1:56:04] going to roll your stone away?
[1:56:07] Are you going to do something for God?
[1:56:09] Just any part, any part to play.
[1:56:14] God will use you.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Because we've been prophesied to be a
[1:56:19] mighty army.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; So before we go,
[1:56:25] I want to remind the local church
[1:56:27] there's no Wednesday service. just to
[1:56:30] the sheer fact of breaking down
[1:56:32] everything and everybody getting their
[1:56:34] strength back. We'll be having C church
[1:56:36] of course on the following Sunday.
[1:56:41] Can we just sing one little chorus? I
[1:56:43] pledge
[1:56:45] allegiance to this lamb.
[1:56:50] I plan
[1:56:53] to reach
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; with all my heart,
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; with all my strength,
[1:57:05] with all everything that's within me,
[1:57:09] I will see
[1:57:13] all
[1:57:14] the
[1:57:17] way.
[1:57:23] with all of you that is in me.
[1:57:29] I've heard about Christians long ago. I
[1:57:33] am worth
[1:57:46] the
[1:57:54] He was
[1:58:08] my one by one.
[1:58:26] I
[1:58:32] see
[1:58:34] I
[1:58:36] see
[1:58:38] their voice
[1:58:42] and I
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Let's make it unanimous this morning
[1:58:48] to the lamb.
[1:58:54] I'll be driven, Lord.
[1:59:06] his command.
[1:59:08] I went
[1:59:13] to
[1:59:17] the lamb to the lamb of God and to the
[1:59:21] lamb of God.
[1:59:31] my
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; bless your holy name.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; I see
[1:59:40] to
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; and I pledge
[1:59:49] allegiance
[1:59:51] to
[1:59:56] the lamb.
[1:59:58] Brother John would get ready for
[2:00:00] baptism. And those that will be being
[2:00:02] baptized will be baptizing right up here
[2:00:05] by the snack shack. There's a a pool
[2:00:08] waiting there. And if those that would
[2:00:10] like to linger and watch baptism,
[2:00:12] absolutely. The lunch is prepared for
[2:00:15] campers only. Unfortunately, we'd love
[2:00:18] to have you all. If you've brought your
[2:00:20] picnics, that's wonderful. stay on the
[2:00:23] grounds, enjoy one another's company,
[2:00:26] and you're welcome to stay till this
[2:00:28] afternoon.
[2:00:30] And uh I think that's all that we have
[2:00:34] to announce, unless I miss it, but
[2:00:40] yes, of
[2:00:42] course, we want to leave a good
[2:00:43] testimony. We want our cabins clean.
[2:00:47] Every one of you, I know I know you're
[2:00:49] you'll do that. You've been faithful.
[2:00:51] Every year we've been having kind
[2:00:54] comments that you leave it better than
[2:00:56] what you got it. And that's marvelous.
[2:00:59] Let's let's keep that testimony keep
[2:01:02] that testimony high.
[2:01:05] And
[2:01:07] when we finish praying, I know it's
[2:01:09] disruptive
[2:01:11] to the presence of the Lord, but he'll
[2:01:13] go with us. If the brothers would just
[2:01:17] grab a chair and we'll put them stack
[2:01:18] them outside where they're supposed to
[2:01:20] be and help the brothers here. We can
[2:01:22] get it done in just a matter of minutes
[2:01:24] if you just grab a chair where you're at
[2:01:26] and it'll all be done. But I just thank
[2:01:29] you one more time.
[2:01:38] It's been a very special day.
[2:01:40] Amen.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; I guess I've been involved for 30 33
[2:01:46] years of them.
[2:01:48] And every year you just say, "Oh, how
[2:01:50] can it ever get better?"
[2:01:53] And it and it just shows you it has to
[2:01:55] be God
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; for it to escalate to the degree of
[2:02:00] where we're at today. I think by next
[2:02:03] year we must escalate into the very
[2:02:05] glories of God.
[2:02:07] If it's going the way that it's going, I
[2:02:10] can't see that we'd have another year.
[2:02:13] God bless you all. You know who you are.
[2:02:18] From dishwashers,
[2:02:21] sound, music,
[2:02:23] everyone.
[2:02:25] God give you a crown.
[2:02:29] Let's bow our heads.
[2:02:39] Father, when it's all said and done,
[2:02:41] it's to God be the glory.
[2:02:44] When it's all said and done, Lord, we
[2:02:48] want you to receive the praise.
[2:02:51] We say to the sound people or we say to
[2:02:53] the musicians or we say to the kitchen
[2:02:56] staff, "Thank you." But really, Lord,
[2:03:00] it's the God in them that we thank.
[2:03:03] They have poured out their lives and as
[2:03:05] your prophet taught us, living for
[2:03:07] others
[2:03:08] is true Christianity.
[2:03:12] And so, Father, I'm just praying that
[2:03:14] your grace will go with everyone that
[2:03:17] has traveled the distances from
[2:03:20] Saskatchewan to Alberta,
[2:03:23] all throughout the states back to
[2:03:25] Europe. Would the glory of God go with
[2:03:28] every one of us, Lord. May your presence
[2:03:32] be near and may we not forget what we've
[2:03:34] heard. May the Holy Spirit bring back to
[2:03:37] our remembrance.
[2:03:39] For we have indeed marked the spot at
[2:03:41] this camp, God met me.
[2:03:46] So bless your children as they will go
[2:03:48] their separate ways and we'll have that
[2:03:51] closing part, Lord, with the young
[2:03:53] people having their lunch. will have the
[2:03:56] baptisms and we ask that you fill them
[2:03:59] with the Holy Ghost. Lord, let these
[2:04:03] young men and young lady that will be
[2:04:05] baptized, may they be driven
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God that shall descend.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Go with us now. And we thank you for
[2:04:15] this time that we've had. It's been
[2:04:18] special.
[2:04:20] So we thank you for your special
[2:04:22] presence
[2:04:24] in Jesus name.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Greet one another as you kindly greet
[2:04:32] one another. Just take your chair and
[2:04:34] take it out back and the brothers will
[2:04:37] show you where to put them. God bless
[2:04:39] you.
[2:04:44] Heat. Heat.
