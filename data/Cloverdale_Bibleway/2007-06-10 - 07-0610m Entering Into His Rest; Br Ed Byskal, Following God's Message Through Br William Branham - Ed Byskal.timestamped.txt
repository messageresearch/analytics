[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] stand as we sing Oh this is
[0:08] [Music]
[0:26] my is my
[0:30] [Music]
[0:41] I believe it was the psalmist David that
[0:44] said I will say to my soul praise ye the
[0:46] Lord sometime we have to tell our soul
[0:51] you're going to praise God you didn't
[0:53] come here just to warm a seat you came
[0:56] here to be a participant you came here
[0:59] while you've got breath in your lungs
[1:00] and in your body and Life to say
[1:03] something of of the grace of God and
[1:07] that's the best way I know to do it I'll
[1:09] praise him I'll give him glory and the
[1:12] the last verse of that course the verse
[1:14] of the song we just sang perfect
[1:17] submission all is at rest is so much in
[1:19] keeping with the service this morning
[1:21] that I feel in my heart to speak I'd
[1:23] like to sing that verse again and just
[1:26] before we just before we do I would like
[1:29] to just just make these
[1:31] comments uh we're very much in
[1:33] preparation for the convention which is
[1:36] taking place I want to uh show my
[1:38] appreciation for all of those that are
[1:42] uh putting such an effort out and
[1:43] there's a lot of effort out for those
[1:45] you that have opened your homes uh I see
[1:49] for myself there is two real
[1:53] thrusts that I
[1:55] feel in my
[1:57] spirit uh that I would like to to see
[2:01] happen and one is I'd like that the
[2:04] congregation here would be an example
[2:08] message church and I believe that you
[2:12] are I just want that to be expressed in
[2:15] a very wonderful way to all the people
[2:18] that will be coming in our conduct in
[2:23] our
[2:24] Hospitality in our
[2:27] Zeal and in our a holy ghost fill life I
[2:31] believe that we can be that and express
[2:34] that and be an encouragement to others
[2:38] so that they can visit here and say we
[2:41] had a glorious time we heard a rich word
[2:44] we met wonderful people and we go home
[2:48] with uh an an
[2:51] edified that we want to continue with
[2:54] this kind of atmosphere you believe
[2:56] that's possible what we have a message
[2:59] why why can't we have a model Message
[3:01] Church you believe it I don't want to
[3:04] feel like I'm pulling a sled over dry
[3:06] ground now do you believe it all right
[3:09] then let's let's just say well we will
[3:11] do that by God's grace we'll do that and
[3:15] the second thrust is that
[3:17] we it has just been my own
[3:20] personal uh insatiable desire which I
[3:23] never never can get away from neither do
[3:25] I want to get away from it and that is
[3:28] to provide the message to the peoples of
[3:31] the world in the language they can
[3:34] understand something that you and I so
[3:37] enjoy and we just become enraptured with
[3:41] the words that God sent to us through
[3:43] his Prophet messenger that we can
[3:45] dedicate ourselves and say we will do
[3:47] all that we can to see that this reaches
[3:50] as far as possible uh to as many people
[3:53] as possible to whatever doors that God
[3:55] opens to us so we want to be remembering
[3:58] also especially brother Tony is uh still
[4:01] in uh Brazil and attending to some
[4:05] things he's got some real burdens down
[4:07] there and so I also want to say you've
[4:10] been praying that the different pastors
[4:12] will be able to get visas to come uh
[4:15] brother Vernon from the Philippines got
[4:17] his Visa this last week we're very happy
[4:20] over that brother Cesar and his wife got
[4:22] their visas from Brazil and uh so
[4:25] there's over 70 pastors from probably
[4:28] somewhere between 15 and 20 countries
[4:31] that have now confirmed are able to be
[4:34] here so we're really thankful about that
[4:37] and for those of you that are streaming
[4:39] on the
[4:41] internet uh we we want you to know that
[4:44] we certainly appreciate your prayers and
[4:47] your comments and there are many uh last
[4:52] last Sunday there was somewhere around
[4:55] 170 some locations that were live
[4:58] streaming during the service while
[5:00] you're here
[5:01] worshiping and uh and from that day to
[5:04] this from Sunday to Sunday there was
[5:07] about another 300 and some that had
[5:11] connected through the archiving because
[5:13] their timing is not right China and some
[5:16] of these countries and from over 33 or
[5:19] not over but 33
[5:21] nations with 34 I believe it was I very
[5:26] rarely looked but I just want to let you
[5:28] know that this this is a real live
[5:31] audience and we are participating with
[5:34] them and they are participating with us
[5:37] and we just want to say God's blessings
[5:39] upon them in the name of our Lord Jesus
[5:42] Christ remember also beginning next
[5:44] Sunday next Sunday will just be one one
[5:47] Sunday service it'll be we're going to
[5:49] go one Sunday service now for the summer
[5:52] during the congestion on the on the
[5:55] border I know sometimes it's not
[5:57] congested other times it's terribly
[5:58] congested but we're we're going to have
[6:00] a we'll we we'll just count on having a
[6:02] camp meeting every Sunday morning and
[6:06] how long it goes we don't know we're not
[6:08] going to drag it out on purpose but
[6:10] we're going to be here with no time
[6:13] restraints

[6:21] support for that to do

[6:35] this
[6:36] service amen there's a baptismal

[6:43] baptized it's wonderful what God is
[6:45] doing friends one of the young men
[6:47] that's going to be
[6:49] baptized tonight is a a real
[6:53] blessing uh this this is the time God
[6:57] moved on them last Sunday
[7:00] and I understand I can't say his
[7:02] testimony but I understand I haven't
[7:03] talked with him directly but I
[7:06] understand he's never been to the
[7:08] front never been baptized from one of
[7:11] our good believing
[7:13] families but he's going to be baptized
[7:16] tonight and soon as he had that
[7:19] experience last Sunday morning he's told
[7:22] our brother Tom I just can't get enough
[7:25] of the word of God have an insatiable
[7:28] thirst for the word of God of God I
[7:30] can't pass a message book without
[7:31] picking it up and reading it and
[7:33] devouring it that's a good sign it's a
[7:36] good
[7:38] sign
[7:40] Hallelujah get hungry right away amen
[7:44] that
[7:49] wonderful there's a man here in the
[7:52] congregation and he won't mind me saying
[7:54] this I'm sure but I just shook hands
[7:57] with him last Sunday morning coming in
[7:59] to the service and brother Mike caleno
[8:02] said I'd like that little prayer cloth

[8:30] way he said yes Safeway we work together

[8:48] stunned that over 30 years probably 33
[8:53] years and I'm standing here in front of

[11:41] finished work today we rejoice in that
[11:44] finished work and that you have sent the
[11:46] Holy Spirit down Within These human
[11:49] vessels giving witness and testimony
[11:52] that the work is a finished work bless

[12:10] Lord pray you'll bless us now with a
[12:12] spirit of Revelation as we read your
[12:15] scripture for you are the author and
[12:17] we're trusting you as the author make
[12:20] known this message to us oh God give
[12:23] understanding I pray in the name of
[12:25] Jesus Christ amen
[12:29] I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles
[12:31] to the book of Hebrews if you would the
[12:35] third
[12:46] chapter beginning to read at the seventh
[12:50] verse and then we're going to continue
[12:53] in the fourth chapter for six
[12:57] verses wherefore is the the Holy Ghost
[12:59] saith today if you will hear his voice
[13:03] Harden not your heart as in the
[13:04] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[13:06] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[13:09] me proved me and saw my Works 40 years
[13:13] wherefore I was grieved with that
[13:15] generation and said they do all we Heir
[13:18] in their heart and they have not known
[13:21] my ways so I swear in my wrath they
[13:24] shall not enter into my rest take heed
[13:27] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[13:30] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[13:32] the Living God but exhort one another
[13:35] daily while it is called today lest any
[13:38] of you be hardened through the
[13:40] deceitfulness of sin I want to just stop
[13:43] there to say unbelief unbelief has a
[13:47] hardening effect through the hardened
[13:51] through the deceitfulness of sin sin is
[13:53] also deceitful and it is hardening of of
[13:58] of our spirit
[13:59] for We Are Made verse 14 for we are made
[14:02] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[14:05] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[14:07] unto the end while it is said today if
[14:11] you will hear his voice Harden not your
[14:13] hearts as in the
[14:15] provocation for some when they had heard
[14:18] did provoke how be it not all that came
[14:20] out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was
[14:24] he grieved 40 years was it not with them
[14:27] that sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[14:30] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[14:33] they should not enter into his rest but
[14:36] to them that believed not so we see that
[14:40] they could not enter in because of
[14:42] unbelief let us therefore fear lest a
[14:46] promise being left us of entering into
[14:48] his rest any of you should seem to come
[14:51] short of it for unto us was the Gospel
[14:54] preached as well as unto them but the
[14:57] word preached did not profit profet them
[15:00] not being mixed with faith in them that
[15:02] heard it for we which have believed do
[15:05] enter into rest as he said as I have
[15:09] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[15:11] into my rest although the works were
[15:14] finished from the foundation of the
[15:16] world for he spake in a certain
[15:20] place of the seventh day on this wise
[15:23] and God did rest the seventh day from
[15:26] all his works and in this place again if
[15:30] they shall enter into my rest seeing
[15:33] therefore it remaineth that some must
[15:37] enter
[15:38] therein and they to whom it was first
[15:41] preached entered not in because of
[15:44] unbelief it remaineth that some must
[15:47] enter therein God bless you as you have
[15:51] your seats
[16:01] some must enter
[16:04] in it remaineth that some must enter in
[16:08] I'm glad that is in there I identify
[16:11] with
[16:12] that I'm I'm some of that must I'm one
[16:16] of those you're one of those that's got
[16:19] to be a personal witness within your own
[16:21] soul there are some that must enter in
[16:25] and I'm part of that group amen and to
[16:29] enter in and uh the word that Paul has
[16:33] used
[16:35] here is not just to enter as we may
[16:39] think of entering into a place such as
[16:41] this but the an entrance into any
[16:44] condition an entrance into any condition
[16:47] or to and the word also implies to arise
[16:51] and come into existence in other words
[16:55] prior to this entering in we may be the
[16:58] person that we are but we don't we
[17:00] haven't really come into our existence
[17:03] we haven't come into what we are to be
[17:06] or what is intended for us to be and so
[17:10] Paul is saying here and using this word
[17:14] throughout these two chapters and if
[17:17] you'll notice please that the Bible is
[17:19] calling it God is calling it my rest not
[17:24] your rest but it's my rest God's rest
[17:28] we're in entering into his rest that's
[17:31] what the scripture is speaking about and
[17:34] only by coming into his rest can we
[17:37] really be in the right place only coming
[17:41] into his rest can we be can we come into
[17:45] what I would say true existence outside
[17:48] of that we're not having a true
[17:52] existence we come to life and to come to
[17:57] come into real real true existence or
[18:00] our real true
[18:03] condition right at this time of the year
[18:05] we've in this part of the world at least
[18:08] in North America United States Canada
[18:11] our students are completing School many
[18:15] of them completing their 12th grade of
[18:19] Education looking forward perhaps to
[18:22] further
[18:23] education and uh we will have uh grad
[18:27] ceremonies many of you in the next
[18:29] couple of weeks so you'll be completing
[18:32] and concluding that part of your life
[18:35] your
[18:37] education and looking forward to
[18:39] whatever else you might be doing a lot
[18:42] of decisions decisions will be made at a
[18:46] different level now when the young
[18:49] people come to that uh time and you'll
[18:53] be facing
[18:54] challenges uh unchartered Waters that
[18:57] you've never
[18:59] traversed new
[19:01] Pathways and we can say decisions
[19:04] decisions plenty of them you want to
[19:06] have the Holy Spirit guiding you in this
[19:09] part of your life and for those that are
[19:12] looking towards uh further education
[19:16] some field of
[19:18] Education I I understand that many
[19:22] colleges uh
[19:24] universities they require an entrance
[19:28] exam
[19:30] and there is an entrance
[19:32] procedure there they may require and I I
[19:35] looked into it because that's what I'm
[19:38] speaking of entering in to this rest
[19:41] entering into to this condition entering
[19:44] into your true existence and now some of
[19:47] you that have finished this phase of
[19:49] your education you want to enter into
[19:53] what I really want to be what I expect
[19:55] to be what my true existence will be in
[19:58] life I'm going to be this or I'm going
[20:00] to be something else and I want to
[20:02] prepare myself and so now I need further
[20:05] education to to uh get the kind of uh
[20:09] skills that I will require for the rest
[20:12] of my life and even to enter into what
[20:15] your true existence will be you've got
[20:17] to have a uh you've got to go through
[20:19] some procedures for your entrance exams
[20:23] and it said U uh you must try your best
[20:26] to perform well on these exams s and I
[20:30] can say that is true also in the
[20:32] spiritual sense your performance on the
[20:35] required entrance exam is only one part
[20:39] of the admission criteria other criteria
[20:43] include your grade point average uh or
[20:47] your marks your scores uh letters of
[20:51] recommendations perhaps essays
[20:55] Etc this is just for natural education
[20:59] you are well advised to take these exams
[21:03] seriously and if that applies there how
[21:05] much more so
[21:07] now a sound preparation can enhance your
[21:10] performance
[21:12] significantly help is abundantly
[21:15] available and I can say that is
[21:16] certainly the case
[21:18] here help is abundantly available in the
[21:21] form of information on the web and books
[21:24] and coaching and
[21:25] classes research what has been research
[21:29] what is best for you and what you can
[21:31] afford well let me say to you you can
[21:34] afford
[21:35] this and we're having not merely a
[21:38] convention we're not having a convention
[21:39] have a convention we haven't had it for
[21:41] 10 years as soon as we announced we
[21:44] would have that you know then brother
[21:46] Tom some of the brothers here asked well
[21:48] will we have Family Camp I said I
[21:50] believe that we need to have Family Camp
[21:53] I don't think that our our people will
[21:55] forgive us if we don't have a family
[21:57] Camp because it's a great time when it's
[22:00] it's not a convention atmosphere it's a
[22:02] Family Camp atmosphere where parents are
[22:05] mingling with their children and and our
[22:07] vision and desire I think this is 21
[22:09] years every year we've had Family Camp
[22:12] and have gone from probably 60 young
[22:15] people to almost 400 young people and uh
[22:19] from maybe two 300 on the camp or maybe
[22:23] even less than 200 to last year I think
[22:25] they filled a th000 seats we had rented
[22:28] had a thousand seats Under the Tent and
[22:31] this is not just a you know this is not
[22:33] a a time of frivolity and just and so on
[22:36] but it's a time when family
[22:38] relationships are forged together when
[22:41] mothers and fathers are able to be with
[22:43] their young people and the desire
[22:46] because out out in the world the spirit
[22:49] of the world is so uh intent on
[22:52] destroying the family the family ties
[22:56] and that's the first thing that Satan
[22:58] did in the in Eden was dismember the
[23:01] family and we are opposed to that we are
[23:05] absolutely directly opposed to it we
[23:07] believe in the family we believe that
[23:10] God has ordained that we shall have
[23:12] family and I believe as father as a
[23:14] father myself you can't take my place I
[23:17] can't take yours but as a father I've
[23:19] claimed my family for God hallelujah my
[23:23] children and my children's children and
[23:26] I say the devil's a liar Hallelujah and
[23:29] whatever he may attempt to do and
[23:31] whatever he succeeds in doing I don't
[23:33] call it an ultimate success I call him
[23:35] an ultimate failure and the and the
[23:38] promise of God is yay and amen
[23:41] hallelujah and I won't let anyone take
[23:43] that away from me and don't let anyone
[23:44] take that away from you if you want to
[23:46] follow in the footsteps of your pastor
[23:48] you can follow in those footsteps God's
[23:51] word is true Hallelujah and we believe
[23:54] the the circle shall not be broken on
[23:57] the other side
[23:58] Hallelujah say well what if it looks
[24:01] impossible God is a god of the
[24:03] impossible
[24:10] Hallelujah
[24:12] today in this time many of you that will
[24:17] are graduating and I don't want to spend
[24:19] much time on this because I want to get
[24:20] to the scripture but this is certainly a
[24:22] good foundation for it you will be
[24:25] making more decisions I went heard a
[24:29] woman a few years ago speak to a
[24:31] graduating class when some of our young
[24:34] people were graduating out of the 12th
[24:36] grade and she said at that time she
[24:41] said some years ago you would only uh
[24:45] prepare for one one profession and you
[24:48] would expect to stay in that profession
[24:50] for the rest of your days but she said
[24:53] most of you will have as many as five
[24:57] jobs
[24:58] you'll train for five different jobs and
[25:01] today there are many more decisions than
[25:03] just making a decision for one people
[25:06] used to work for one or two lawyers in a
[25:08] lifetime but the US Department of Labor
[25:12] stats show that today both men and women
[25:16] between the ages of 18 to 40 will have
[25:19] over 10 jobs in their lifetime over 10
[25:24] different jobs so it's doubled even
[25:26] since I sat in that graduation in class
[25:28] A few years ago so there's a lot of
[25:31] decisions that are being made instead of
[25:33] a young person saying I'm going to be a
[25:35] doctor I'm going to be this they might
[25:37] be that for the rest of their life but
[25:39] the average American has 10 jobs that
[25:42] between 18 and and 40y old Americans and
[25:46] that is what uh we have garnered from
[25:50] their
[25:51] website they say that also that the
[25:54] average family
[25:56] moves 12 times
[25:59] the average American family moves an 12
[26:03] times in their lifetime and so the
[26:07] families today Are Much More transcent
[26:10] Much More moving and moving is a big
[26:12] decision moving is a costly decision and
[26:16] I have said to so many here that have
[26:18] moved and have come here you can pull up
[26:21] your roots in five minutes but you can't
[26:24] put them down in five and it's putting
[26:27] them down that that really takes some
[26:29] time and some patience and there's
[26:31] hardship and work and labor and putting
[26:33] your roots down you can put them up in
[26:36] just a few moments say let's go pack up
[26:38] we're out of here we're history but to
[26:40] then to change uh your place of dwelling
[26:45] change the whole atmosphere the whole
[26:48] environment your conditions your culture
[26:51] your job your position and some of those
[26:55] which
[26:56] you it's a it's a Terri experience and
[26:59] so uh I'm just saying that by way of of
[27:03] of a foundation for the for the service
[27:05] this morning I'm not speaking about that
[27:08] but I do believe that uh we must be
[27:11] prepared the songwriter
[27:13] said I've been traveling for Jesus so
[27:16] much of my
[27:18] life been traveling Orlando or or on sea
[27:21] and I said well Amen to that but I'm
[27:24] planning on taking a trip to the sky
[27:28] and that will be the last move for
[27:31] me he went on to say here I'm bothered
[27:34] with packing each time that I move and
[27:38] carry a load in each hand but I'll not
[27:41] need one thing that I've used in this
[27:43] world when I move to that Heavenly
[27:47] land when I make my last
[27:52] move Hallelujah
[27:58] we all are faced with our own unique set
[28:01] of circumstances we sit here
[28:04] today beside family perhaps husband
[28:09] wife individual our friends our
[28:13] peers and uh I would say there isn't a
[28:16] person here but what we are facing some
[28:19] sort of a decision as I spoke on
[28:21] decisions last Sunday carrying on a wee
[28:23] bit but I'm wanting to come now to where
[28:25] I really wanted to approach last last
[28:28] Sunday
[28:30] service uh we want to make a move in our
[28:33] spiritual life we want to perhaps and I
[28:37] may not be speaking to 100% of the
[28:39] congregation but I think I'll be
[28:40] speaking to most everyone we want to
[28:43] move from where we are
[28:45] spiritually to another dimension to
[28:49] another level and I'm sure we all hunger
[28:52] after that and I'm going to take a
[28:54] message that the prophet of God left us
[28:57] and how he broke get down and it is
[28:59] incredibly revealing and enlightening
[29:02] and I feel that when I have covered what
[29:04] he has said it will cover every single
[29:07] person in this building not a not one
[29:11] person will be left out and so you can
[29:14] look for that part that refers to you in
[29:17] the scripture which we've
[29:20] read Hebrews is written by the Apostle
[29:23] Paul and the Apostle Paul is writing to
[29:27] the Hebrew Hebrews and he has two main
[29:30] concerns because they are Jews and he is
[29:33] a Jew and he can understand what it is
[29:37] to because they're they're they're
[29:39] leaving one element and moving to
[29:42] another and that is the they they're
[29:43] leaving essentially the law and all of
[29:47] its all of its regulations and all of
[29:51] its Washings and all of these
[29:54] things and Rabbi Richmond has said and
[29:57] also gersan Solomon has said and I've
[29:59] heard them both say it that the law had
[30:02] 600 they have
[30:03] 613 laws in the Old Testament and Jews
[30:07] keep those laws the ultra Orthodox Jews
[30:12] attempt to keep those
[30:14] 63 laws which are left from the Old
[30:17] Testament Paul knew something of the
[30:20] struggle of the Jews coming out of that
[30:24] out of
[30:25] Judaism and in into followers of Christ
[30:29] to become Believers of Christ and so the
[30:34] two themes that are in Hebrews which
[30:36] will now apply to the scripture we read
[30:39] he was wanting to prove to the Jewish
[30:43] Christians that
[30:45] Judaism as they had known it had come to
[30:48] an
[30:49] end through the Fulfillment of the
[30:53] scripture in Jesus Christ that he was
[30:55] the Fulfillment of the whole purpose of
[30:59] God in the law and so that now now it
[31:02] was to have faith in Christ and and it
[31:06] seemed so simplistic I'm sure it was
[31:08] difficult because they were they were uh
[31:11] so trained from childhood from birth
[31:13] they had to do things you have to do
[31:15] this you have to do this washing you
[31:17] have to do it a certain way and all of
[31:19] these sacrifices a certain way in the
[31:21] way we eat and the way we dress and the
[31:23] way we do everything and now Paul is
[31:26] trying to tell them that this has been
[31:30] completed in Christ Christ is the
[31:33] Fulfillment and the end of the law and
[31:36] then secondly that there was a danger a
[31:40] very real danger with these new
[31:42] Believers for we can identify with this
[31:45] there was a
[31:46] danger that the Jewish Believers would
[31:50] lapse back would lapse back into
[31:54] Judaism or simply pause and not not move
[31:58] forward in the message of the hour and
[32:02] we certainly can identify with that
[32:05] there's a danger many of us come from
[32:08] all kinds of denominations and churches
[32:10] and whatever more and and there's a
[32:12] danger within the message of lapsing
[32:14] back and and and hanging on to traits of
[32:18] the past and hanging on to forms of the
[32:21] past and things that have been Dragged
[32:23] In from uh we'll say Christianity
[32:28] churchianity uh the religious World
[32:30] dragging those things up say well we
[32:33] need to continue with those or coming
[32:37] into the message and then and then just
[32:40] becoming uh stagnant not moving forward
[32:44] saying well well you know this is good
[32:46] enough yeah okay God sent a prophet
[32:48] Malachi 4 uh Luke 17:30 fine wonderful
[32:51] and you know godhead baptism serpent
[32:54] seed whatever more and then we we remain
[32:57] there and we don't move forward that's
[33:00] what Paul was saying and that is why he
[33:03] he he could say that because even him
[33:06] himself he made this
[33:08] testimony he said though I might have
[33:11] also confidence in the flesh if any
[33:14] other man thinketh that he hath whereof
[33:16] he may Trust In the Flesh I more he's
[33:20] establishing himself as a Jew to the
[33:22] Philippians he said I am circumcised
[33:24] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stalk
[33:27] of isra Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin
[33:30] and Hebrew of the Hebrew as concerning
[33:33] touching the law a fisy and concerning
[33:37] Zeal persecuting the church touching the
[33:41] righteousness which is of the law
[33:43] blameless I if anybody's a Jew he says
[33:46] I'm a Jew I'm a circumcised the eighth
[33:49] day I'm of The Tribe of Benjamin I'm a
[33:51] zealous Jew I'm I I've kept the law to
[33:55] Perfection and all of those things and
[33:57] so so he was saying that you know I have
[33:59] a right I know what it is that you're
[34:02] going through and to you Hebrews you
[34:04] must not pause you must not lapse back
[34:07] and you must not just stay where you are
[34:09] there is a rest there's another place
[34:13] and we must enter into that rest we must
[34:16] in other words inherit everything that
[34:18] God purchased for us why s and be idle
[34:22] why sit and just lapse back why be
[34:25] satisfied with less than what God has
[34:27] provided for us
[34:31] hallelujah so Paul could say as he did
[34:35] in Hebrews 6 he said therefore leaving
[34:37] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[34:41] let us go on to Perfection not laying
[34:44] again the foundation of repentance from
[34:47] dead works and Faith towards God you
[34:49] know there are some even within the
[34:51] message say well I'm just staying with
[34:53] the ABCs I'm just staying with the ABCs
[34:56] well I can tell you Apostle Paul Paul
[34:57] would rebuke anybody saying that saying
[35:00] it's much more than ABCs some people
[35:03] want to stay in their own comfort zone
[35:04] and just say well I just you know stay
[35:06] with the simple things it's it's hey
[35:09] whatever whatever the prophet of God
[35:11] delivered that's what he intends us to
[35:13] eat God didn't send it to us to you know
[35:15] just to look at and put it and hang it
[35:17] on the wall and put the book in the as a
[35:21] as a a display in a cabinet or something
[35:24] God intended the people to participate
[35:26] and take a whole of it and to have it
[35:29] lived out there's a message for this
[35:32] hour amen so leaving the principles of
[35:36] the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[35:39] Perfection not laying again the
[35:40] foundation of repentance from dead works
[35:43] and Faith towards God so Paul is saying
[35:45] let us move on from
[35:47] that perfection in this case the first
[35:51] word that Perfection means is a finisher
[35:54] Paul was a finisher Paul said in in Acts
[35:58] the 20th chapter he said and now behold
[36:02] I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem
[36:05] not knowing the things that shall befall
[36:08] me there save except he knew this sa
[36:11] that the Holy Spirit has witnessed in
[36:14] every city saying that bonds and
[36:17] afflictions abide me so I don't know
[36:20] what's going to befall me completely but
[36:22] the holy spirit is also witnessed that
[36:24] in every city bonds and afflictions uh
[36:28] abide me those things will be with me
[36:30] but he says but none of these things
[36:33] move me neither count I my life dear
[36:36] unto myself so that I might finish my
[36:42] course with joy not that I be dragged
[36:45] out in the end and get through by the
[36:48] skin of my teeth but he says None of
[36:50] these things and listen friends we don't
[36:52] want to take this as a sermon this
[36:54] morning you've got to apply it to your
[36:55] own self the Holy Spirit Witness to me
[36:58] that I'm not in a Sunday school picnic
[37:00] the Holy Spirit witnesses to me that
[37:02] this way won't be an easy way whatever
[37:05] my future is the holy spirit witnesses
[37:07] to me this will be a battle and the
[37:09] prophet says I'll fight for every inch
[37:11] and you've got to be resolved in your
[37:12] heart I'm prepared to fight for every
[37:14] end nothing shall move me none of these
[37:17] things move me can this congregation say
[37:19] Amen down in your soul cannot ReSound an
[37:22] amen nothing shall move me don't be
[37:25] caught in my inspiration be caught in in
[37:27] your own inspiration don't be caught in
[37:29] my witness be caught in your own witness
[37:31] none of these things shall move me
[37:34] nothing that Satan can throw in my way
[37:36] no enchantment no enticement Hallelujah
[37:40] nothing of these things shall move me I
[37:43] know that there's afflictions that abide
[37:45] me the Holy Spirit Witnesses this won't
[37:47] be an easy way but I'm going to finish
[37:50] my course with joy that is
[37:53] perfection I'm going to I'm going to be
[37:55] mature enough that I can make that kind
[37:58] of of a decision and that is why Apostle
[38:01] Paul could also say he could say that I
[38:05] have I have finished my course he said
[38:08] to Timothy I have finished my course
[38:10] here he was saying that I may finish my
[38:12] course but then he was able to write
[38:15] that old Apostle to Timothy and said I
[38:18] have finished my course glory to God
[38:20] therefore there's a crown laid up for me
[38:23] where every person here wants to be able
[38:25] to make that testimony
[38:29] to
[38:32] complete let us go on to Perfection
[38:35] let's complete the journey to accomplish
[38:38] what we've been called to accomplish and
[38:41] Paul is saying let us go on to full age
[38:44] don't let us remain as children oh they
[38:46] didn't shake my hand they didn't look at
[38:49] me just right or this thing I had a bad
[38:52] day what's that got to do with it that's
[38:55] got nothing to do with it I'm going
[38:57] through a tough time you're supposed to
[38:59] expect
[39:00] that Hallelujah you're to expect
[39:04] that we haven't been called to an easy
[39:07] way it also says in in Hebrews Paul's
[39:11] telling the Hebrews for when the time
[39:15] that you ought to be teachers you have
[39:17] need that one teach you again which be
[39:20] the first principles now he's talking to
[39:22] the Jewish Believers he's talking to
[39:24] people that came into the message that's
[39:25] who he's talking to he not talking to a
[39:27] bunch of unbelievers he's talking to
[39:29] people who came into the message said by
[39:31] the time when you should be teachers
[39:34] said then you have need to be taught
[39:36] again of the first principles of the
[39:39] Oracles of God and are become such as
[39:42] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[39:45] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[39:48] are of full age that he was talking
[39:49] about coming to Perfection let's move to
[39:52] Perfection and belongs to them of full
[39:55] age even those who by reason of use have
[39:59] their senses exercised to discern both
[40:03] good and
[40:06] evil therefore it remaineth that some
[40:10] must enter into my
[40:13] rest brother Brenham takes the
[40:15] Tabernacle of the
[40:17] Wilderness I was going to put it on the
[40:19] screen but I'm not going to distract you
[40:21] with it now the Tabernacle in the
[40:23] wilderness was built in three parts as
[40:27] is it has direct reference and this is
[40:29] fundamental to a lot of you but many and
[40:32] some of our young people coming up it
[40:34] has direct reference to your physical
[40:36] body your physical being you are body
[40:41] you are spirit and you are soul your
[40:45] body has a five channels your spirit has
[40:48] five channels and a lot of people can't
[40:50] remember those five channels I don't
[40:52] have the best memory in the world but I
[40:55] I use a my own little code
[40:58] and I use it my car for the for the five
[41:02] channels to the to the spirit my car M
[41:06] for your memory I for your
[41:10] imagination C for your conscience a for
[41:14] your affection and R for reasoning and
[41:18] four of those five are in the
[41:22] mind and it involves your affection your
[41:25] memory what you think your imagination
[41:28] what you can be all of these things and
[41:31] they are so close now the the scripture
[41:34] which the prophet used all the time
[41:36] throughout his entire Ministry is this
[41:39] one for the word of God is quick and
[41:42] Powerful now here's where Pentecost and
[41:44] so many religions and so many
[41:46] theologians and Men of great learning
[41:49] they missed it completely because when
[41:52] the prophet of God was standing there
[41:54] Discerning the secrets of the people's
[41:56] hearts they thought what a marvelous
[41:57] gift oh God has given a gift of
[42:00] discernment it was no gift of
[42:01] discernment and he kept using the
[42:03] scripture and they should have caught it
[42:05] they should have caught it he said it
[42:07] over and over hundreds and hundreds of
[42:09] times for the word of God is quick and
[42:13] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[42:16] sword not the gift of God the word of
[42:19] God the word of God God's
[42:24] breath God's Own breath
[42:28] God's word not a man's word not William
[42:31] bram's word or Ed bis's word or anybody
[42:34] else's word the word of God is quick and
[42:37] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[42:40] sword piercing even to the dividing
[42:45] aunder of Soul and Spirit not body and
[42:49] spirit it doesn't take the word to
[42:52] divide between this flesh and my spirit
[42:55] but between the spirit and the Soul
[42:57] because they are so closely merged
[43:01] together they're not one but they're so
[43:03] closely merged together that's why when
[43:05] a lot of young people are coming to uh
[43:08] the state of the emotion that's involved
[43:10] with courtship and and who I'll marry
[43:13] and and marriage and so on it is so
[43:16] close that emotional that highly
[43:19] concentrated emotional
[43:22] area and and and and I say you know well
[43:26] are you really certain well yeah I'm I'm
[43:27] absolutely certain because you know
[43:29] because this and I've seen that sign and
[43:30] etc etc and only the word can actually
[43:34] divide
[43:35] between what is spirit and what is soul
[43:39] only the way only the message of the
[43:41] hour only theology can't do it catechism
[43:45] can't do it Sunday schools can't do it
[43:47] uh even preachers can't do it but the
[43:49] word that comes sent from God out of the
[43:53] messenger's mouth can divide it has a it
[43:57] has the surgical accuracy to divide
[44:00] between the spirit and the
[44:04] soul and the word can divide between the
[44:07] spirit and the soul and
[44:10] so we have now the outer
[44:14] Court which is the your body we have the
[44:18] inner court it's called also the holy
[44:22] place which is your spirit realm and
[44:26] then and then there is the holy of
[44:28] holies and there was a curtain between
[44:31] the holy place and the holy of holies
[44:35] and in the outer Court the people
[44:37] congregation could come in the inner
[44:40] Court was where the priests came to
[44:43] minister and in the holy of holies only
[44:47] the high priest once a year not without
[44:50] blood could enter into the holy of
[44:53] holies and in each of these places they
[44:56] had their very various instruments and
[44:58] the various vessels and they had a
[45:00] certain kind of an altar and then you go
[45:02] into the holy place they had the altar
[45:05] of showbread the table of showbread and
[45:08] the Candlestick in the Holy place but in
[45:11] the holy of holies was only the Ark of
[45:14] the Covenant with a cherub them standing
[45:16] over it with their wings touching and
[45:19] that was and the word of God laying in
[45:22] the Ark of the Covenant and you are Body
[45:25] Spirit and soul
[45:28] and in the outer Court we have certain
[45:31] needs certain requirements and God has
[45:33] provided for that and in the inner Court
[45:36] where the priests could go the there are
[45:39] different kind of implements and and
[45:41] altars and so on and different kind of
[45:43] light there and then the holy of holies
[45:46] was different and God said to Moses you
[45:49] will make a tabernacle this is how
[45:53] you'll make it and he made these words
[45:56] so that I I may dwell
[45:59] there and the word that God has sent has
[46:04] been designed specifically for your soul
[46:08] now there are benefits which flow to
[46:10] your emotional realm there's benefits
[46:13] which flow to all the other realm
[46:15] there's benefits which flow to you
[46:17] physically but now how the prophet's
[46:19] message and how the prophet's Ministry
[46:22] came out and first started to touch the
[46:24] body take people by the hand and the and
[46:27] the religious world for the most part
[46:29] became consumed with that oh I just need
[46:33] healing oh if he'll just tell me my
[46:35] sickness they're missing it this was the
[46:38] vessel that would send the word and heal
[46:41] the
[46:42] soul it's our souls that needed healing
[46:45] the altar needed to be rebuilt can you
[46:48] say Amen it's your soul friend and then
[46:51] when the word reaches the soul see Satan
[46:54] has reversed this thing but when the
[46:56] word of God the revelation of the word
[46:59] reaches your soul and takes control and
[47:02] you're born again born of the spirit and
[47:06] the word then that new birth begins to
[47:08] emanate and rise up and takes charge and
[47:12] control of the spirit realm then that
[47:15] word takes control of your imagination
[47:19] that word takes control of your memory
[47:21] because there's some things in your
[47:22] memory you should remember and there's
[47:25] some things in your memory you must for
[47:26] forget and only the word can decipher
[47:30] what should be forgotten and what should
[47:31] be remembered it's got to come from the
[47:34] soul come up and take and clear out that
[47:37] memory Channel some of you people here
[47:38] today got memories you need to
[47:42] forget it's been plaguing your mind and
[47:45] you need to forget it you need to put it
[47:47] on God's Altar and let the Holy Fire of
[47:49] God consume it and end it
[47:53] all and I say you need to move you need
[47:56] need to move today you need to make the
[48:00] decision I'm moving I'm packing up I'm
[48:04] leaving that behind I'm letting the word
[48:07] Minister I'm going to let the word
[48:09] decide what I remember and what I forget
[48:12] and then into the imagination people
[48:14] imagine all kinds of things people even
[48:16] have an
[48:18] imaginary oh my this is another whole
[48:20] message help me now they have an IM an
[48:24] imaginary uh they have an imaginary
[48:28] Jesus the world has an imaginary Jesus
[48:32] and they're not in love with the Jesus
[48:34] of the Bible they're in love with the
[48:36] Jesus of their
[48:38] imagination and there's a danger right
[48:41] within the
[48:42] message well what did Jesus say to the
[48:45] Pharisees and the people of his day oh
[48:47] people are dressed right you couldn't
[48:50] lay a finger on their lives if they were
[48:53] Believers of today you couldn't even put
[48:55] a finger on their lives they were so
[48:57] precise and so perfect Jesus
[49:00] said your
[49:02] fathers your fathers you garnish the
[49:06] tombs you spend your time making the
[49:09] tombs of the prophets go there with all
[49:11] the righteous feeling and everything and
[49:14] all the outward appearance garnishing
[49:17] and giving honor to the prophets that
[49:19] had died Jesus said you Hypocrites your
[49:23] fathers killed them and put them in
[49:25] there but you see those most men if you
[49:27] told them and said you hate the prophets
[49:30] so what are you saying that's a
[49:32] blasphemy to us we don't hate the
[49:35] prophets we love the prophets Jesus said
[49:37] your fathers killed the prophets but
[49:40] what they did they had garnished they
[49:43] had they
[49:44] had they had honored the position of the
[49:48] prophets and they had built a an
[49:51] imaginary image of what the prophets
[49:54] were and they were in love with that
[49:57] image not the prophet themselves and a
[50:00] lot of people today say oh brother
[50:01] brandom and they get brother brandom
[50:03] into a place and into an exalted place
[50:06] and a position and something God exalted
[50:08] him God put him in the place that he had
[50:11] but they get him in some kind of place
[50:13] and if they had lived maybe back there
[50:15] with him and just seen him as a human
[50:17] mind and making the mistakes that he
[50:19] made or living the life that he lived
[50:21] you might not have been impressed with
[50:23] it but what so you say well today what
[50:25] are people impressed with you're
[50:27] impressed with what your imagination has
[50:30] constructed that's what you're impressed
[50:33] with if you lived right then when Jesus
[50:36] lived and you saw his Frailty and he did
[50:39] things that you might understand people
[50:41] picked up stones to Stone them and he
[50:43] ran and dispensed and you might
[50:45] say what's he doing you know I believe
[50:48] he's God In the Flesh what's God In the
[50:49] Flesh running
[50:54] from and you might not be impressed with
[50:56] that
[50:58] that and a lot of other things which he
[51:00] did he weary and maybe sat just heal
[51:04] somebody lame and oh lay over here and
[51:08] with a
[51:10] headache tempted in all
[51:13] points as every
[51:15] man tempted in all points is that what
[51:18] the scripture says but the image that
[51:21] people have constructed is a Christ that
[51:23] never was tempted never had any
[51:25] difficulty never was anything that's
[51:27] you're in love with your
[51:29] image you're in love not with the real
[51:32] person you're in love with what you've
[51:34] constructed him to
[51:37] be I hadn't planned on getting into that
[51:41] but that's why you need you need the
[51:45] word you need the word to come and and
[51:49] separate any
[51:52] imagination and in your conscience
[51:58] how many people are condemned that are
[52:00] real Born Again Believers you're
[52:02] condemned and and and and hang on guilt
[52:06] hangs on to you you can't seem to shake
[52:08] free of it that condemnation has no
[52:11] right your conscience has no right to
[52:14] Cloud your
[52:16] life with condemnation for the word of
[52:19] God has said here it comes quick and
[52:21] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[52:23] sword for there is therefore now no
[52:28] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[52:30] Jesus so the question now is am I in
[52:33] Christ Jesus and if you can say yay amen
[52:36] I am in Christ Jesus then there is now
[52:38] therefore no condemnation to them which
[52:40] in Christ Jesus so your memory Satan
[52:43] tries to poke something in your memory
[52:44] Channel say oh look at this back there
[52:46] and try to bring condemnation on you and
[52:48] you say well now I'll just let the word
[52:50] come up into that memory Channel and
[52:52] clear that one out Hallelujah for
[52:55] there's now there for no condemnation I
[52:58] don't care what kind of a failure it has
[52:59] been I don't care what what has happened
[53:01] in the past the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:04] has cleansed that perfectly and if he
[53:06] hasn't then he failed he died in vain at
[53:10] Calvary so people want to think of the
[53:12] power of Calvary but somehow they want
[53:13] to give uh consideration to Satan to
[53:17] have control of Our Lives he hasn't got
[53:19] any control of our lives and the prophet
[53:22] of God has said that when that sin is
[53:24] confessed it drops into the bleach of
[53:27] the blood of Jesus Christ and it breaks
[53:29] up that bleach actually breaks up it
[53:32] literally breaks up is this what he said
[53:34] is this what he said it breaks up the
[53:37] very elements of the of the of the
[53:41] ink and you've heard me say it and he
[53:44] says even the ink becomes
[53:46] bleach it is so purging and so purifying
[53:50] and so powerful your sin is no match for
[53:54] the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:02] Hallelujah so it remain that that some
[54:05] must enter in I'm preaching this this
[54:07] morning because there may be some here
[54:09] that have to move from the outer court
[54:12] and so now we have these three
[54:14] courts I'm going to move along Qui
[54:17] quickly I'm going to dis give the
[54:19] brother bram's description of the outer
[54:22] Court he said many Christians in my life
[54:26] life he's seen many Christians in his
[54:28] life to be up and
[54:31] down seems to have such a deep
[54:36] desire daily they
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] search and
[54:40] hunt and seek for
[54:43] God and never come to any settlement of
[54:46] any kind to where they could ever be
[54:49] settled or Anchored In Christ this is
[54:53] I'm describing the Oder Court
[54:57] I've inserted this
[54:59] scripture Jesus spoke of the SE and the
[55:03] seed and he spoke of the one group and
[55:06] he says and they have no root in
[55:10] themselves and so they endure but for a
[55:13] short time and afterward when Affliction
[55:16] or persecution ariseth for the world's
[55:20] for the word's sake because of the word
[55:22] soon as persecution arise or Affliction
[55:25] because of the word sake sake
[55:26] immediately they are
[55:28] offended that is why I spoke of
[55:32] decisions we need and
[55:35] especially those that have have given
[55:38] themselves to this message we need to
[55:40] have a resolve because the resolve also
[55:43] is a part of Faith a resolve that and
[55:47] and speak the words of apostle Paul say
[55:51] them to yourself today none of these
[55:54] things shall move me
[55:57] I know that there's bonds I know that
[56:00] there's afflictions there can be all
[56:02] kinds of trouble whatever it might be
[56:05] but none of these things shall move me
[56:08] and if you say well I've been up and
[56:09] down I've been in and out I've been
[56:12] unstable I've been so that I have no I
[56:14] need an
[56:16] anchor then I'm telling you what to do
[56:19] today if I was sitting across the desk
[56:21] from you if you were in my office or
[56:22] where I was in your home you say brother
[56:25] Ed what I do I'll tell you what to do
[56:28] pack up and get ready to
[56:32] move where are you going to move well I
[56:35] would pack up and say I'm not stopping
[56:37] in this outer court anymore I'm not
[56:39] dwelling here anymore I'm not having my
[56:42] ups and downs anymore I'm not going to
[56:44] be moved by these distresses anymore I'm
[56:47] moving out of here hallelujah pick up
[56:50] your bags if you have any and move on
[56:53] onto the holy place and right on into
[56:55] the holy of
[56:58] holies he speaks about these
[57:02] people he said the one intellectually
[57:05] intellectually is
[57:07] hungry he's feasting on God but his
[57:11] Feast doesn't hold
[57:14] out you might be here and no doubt some
[57:18] are intellectually is hungering for God
[57:23] and feasting on God but his feast
[57:26] doesn't hold out that's what you will
[57:27] find is the theme throughout
[57:30] this he went on to say many people go to
[57:34] the service such as we have this morning
[57:38] they
[57:39] Rejoice they shout we're talking about
[57:41] the outer court now shouting is fine in
[57:44] the older
[57:45] Court hey in the older Court you say
[57:48] well oh my I just feel it that's fine
[57:54] shout make sure that when the feeling's
[57:56] gone something's still anchored there
[57:59] and you find well you know what I shout
[58:01] it I had such a wonderful time oh I had
[58:04] such a marvelous feeling I don't even
[58:06] know where it
[58:07] went say what shall I do brother Ed pack
[58:10] up get ready to move make a
[58:16] decision don't be in love with your old
[58:20] self say I don't like my old self I'm
[58:23] moving to another place
[58:31] am says they have they shout and they
[58:34] praise the Lord and while the spirit of
[58:36] God is falling all condemnation left
[58:39] their
[58:40] hearts and a day or two after the
[58:43] Revival they find themselves back in the
[58:46] old grind again they're eating
[58:50] Mana he said the Justified man out here
[58:54] out in the outer Court the man's
[58:55] Justified
[58:56] he walks by daylight I touched on this
[58:59] last Sunday but now I want to enlarge on
[59:01] it he walks by
[59:05] daylight I have to make a confession I
[59:07] actually have I've wondered you know if
[59:10] the Lord is I don't want to grieve the
[59:12] Lord I don't want to displease the Lord
[59:15] but I have complained more this
[59:17] winter than I have at any time of 37
[59:21] years of living here in this area not
[59:24] again
[59:26] I don't have to live in this PE soup
[59:28] again I can't even see the hills I can't
[59:32] even see across the valley I just this
[59:36] dismal drizzle why doesn't it go back
[59:39] where it came from and I know that
[59:42] there's a sun up there and I just so
[59:45] want to see
[59:49] it do I have any friends
[59:57] and when the sun is out I don't care you
[1:00:00] know maybe it doesn't affect you but
[1:00:02] when the sun is out and I see the early
[1:00:05] in the morning the Sun hitting the trees
[1:00:07] I feel better
[1:00:09] already but should I feel more spiritual
[1:00:11] no I shouldn't but somehow it affects me
[1:00:15] and so I I realized right away I better
[1:00:18] pass through this outer Court real quick
[1:00:21] I better not stay here because this is
[1:00:23] going to really bother me
[1:00:28] I think all of you folks are human
[1:00:29] enough to say I I've been there yeah
[1:00:33] I've been there but you
[1:00:35] know and that's exactly I feel so sorry
[1:00:39] for people from
[1:00:41] Arizona and people that have come from
[1:00:43] Florida and people that have come from
[1:00:46] South
[1:00:48] Africa were the first time I ever really
[1:00:51] heard about South Africa I was on my way
[1:00:53] there and I stepped into a travel agency
[1:00:56] in in Switzerland to catch a buy a
[1:00:59] ticket for South Africa and my wife my
[1:01:01] family there and I step in here's a
[1:01:03] little calendar just a little Week
[1:01:06] calendar and I looked at that calendar
[1:01:09] and on the bottom it was printed there
[1:01:11] so it could never change it's sunny
[1:01:13] today in South
[1:01:16] Africa I never forgot
[1:01:19] that it's as real as it's as real as I'm
[1:01:22] looking at it right now and I said
[1:01:24] Within Myself that's a the Bold
[1:01:26] statement they're very certain of their
[1:01:28] weather it's sunny today in South Africa
[1:01:32] and uh I can say I have found it cloudy
[1:01:34] and cold too but
[1:01:37] nevertheless and I say to myself is it
[1:01:40] all right we're just a family here this
[1:01:42] morning I say why do people move here
[1:01:45] why do you come here why don't you stay
[1:01:48] where it's sunny but you know
[1:01:50] what I'm not
[1:01:53] God I'm not a prophet nor a son of a
[1:01:56] prophet but when I see you know God put
[1:02:00] something in somebody's heart I don't
[1:02:02] know what why he's moving them and
[1:02:04] shifting them around I don't know I just
[1:02:06] leave that up to him but I know one
[1:02:08] thing the outer court and whether the
[1:02:12] sun is shining the prophet's saying
[1:02:13] we're we're you know out there if the
[1:02:16] Sun was shining you're feeling good and
[1:02:18] if it's not shining you're not feeling
[1:02:19] good but that that isn't where we dwell
[1:02:23] that's not where we live and that's not
[1:02:25] the the message came to provide us he
[1:02:27] didn't come to provide us with an
[1:02:29] environment that's dictated to by you
[1:02:32] know our exterior
[1:02:37] environment you folks might as well say
[1:02:39] Amen this is absolutely the
[1:02:42] message and I'm not talking just about
[1:02:45] the weather I'm talking about our our
[1:02:47] circumstances and the environment around
[1:02:50] us we have to know he said he walks by
[1:02:53] daylight someday has gloomy days some
[1:02:58] days you do not know whether it's really
[1:03:01] worthwhile to serve God or not you're
[1:03:04] walking in the outer court so you're
[1:03:07] eating Mana
[1:03:09] sure you're a Believer sure you have
[1:03:13] eternal life
[1:03:16] sure and if you die you go to
[1:03:20] heaven but what kind of life are you
[1:03:24] living every day you get out there oh I
[1:03:28] got my dandruff up today maybe you don't
[1:03:30] know that terminology but that was been
[1:03:32] you know got really you know
[1:03:35] upset I told them about it I cussed them
[1:03:39] out I couldn't help it God forgive me
[1:03:43] sure he will certainly he will you're
[1:03:45] his child but what kind of life you
[1:03:49] living comes to it the second time he
[1:03:53] says my don't you hate to live that kind
[1:03:55] of life
[1:03:57] I'm talking to somebody here says I hate
[1:03:59] that kind of life I'm up I'm down I you
[1:04:03] know the flesh gets the best of me he
[1:04:05] says and he says in the
[1:04:07] trouble and that you pull day and night
[1:04:11] back sliding back to church back sliding
[1:04:14] back to church this that apologizing to
[1:04:17] this over here this fellow's just
[1:04:19] blooming all right along you see saying
[1:04:23] I'm in and I'm out when he just says I'm
[1:04:25] up and down I I'm back no I'm in Victory
[1:04:27] I'm back no I'm in Victory I I I see
[1:04:31] people like that I'm here to tell you
[1:04:33] today I'm your friend I'm here to tell
[1:04:35] you today you don't have to have that
[1:04:38] I'm here to tell you today isn't that
[1:04:40] good news isn't that good news for
[1:04:43] somebody here you don't have to be on
[1:04:45] the
[1:04:46] bottom you can feel on the bottom but
[1:04:48] you don't have to be there you're not
[1:04:51] ordained to live there out of Fellowship
[1:04:55] into fellow ship you're not ordained for
[1:04:57] that you're not made for that Hallelujah
[1:05:01] you're not made for
[1:05:07] defeat some
[1:05:09] say I've heard the odd criticism against
[1:05:12] our ministry here they say it's too
[1:05:14] positive let me just tell you plus all
[1:05:17] the critics that might say that we're
[1:05:19] not nearly as positive as the prophet
[1:05:21] said we should
[1:05:23] be because I have all kinds of negative
[1:05:25] things come by my way and I spend too
[1:05:28] much time on it because it you know it
[1:05:30] bothers you and it troubles you and so
[1:05:31] on you get burdened and you've got to
[1:05:33] stop it when it's just a burden on your
[1:05:35] heart and don't let it uh occupy your
[1:05:37] mind and start affecting your life
[1:05:40] because I don't like that kind of life
[1:05:42] and he says what kind of life you living
[1:05:44] I want to live when he talks about just
[1:05:46] steady all the time blooming all the
[1:05:48] time Victory all the time love all the
[1:05:51] time that's what he said and that's what
[1:05:54] I say is a posit positive message I'm
[1:05:56] going to make that confession you need
[1:05:58] to make that confession that life is my
[1:06:01] life that's what God purposed for
[1:06:05] me all
[1:06:07] right that's the outer court and that's
[1:06:10] the if the description fits you should
[1:06:13] make a clear-cut
[1:06:15] decision to
[1:06:19] move I don't care whether you move here
[1:06:21] or where you move physically that's
[1:06:23] irrelevant now I just want to go for a
[1:06:26] short moment to the to the next to the
[1:06:30] next place and that is probably should
[1:06:33] have spent a little more time on it but
[1:06:36] the that Spirit realm or in the
[1:06:38] Tabernacle was the Holy place and then
[1:06:42] brother Bram says well he comes into the
[1:06:44] court now what's in
[1:06:47] there there's seven golden
[1:06:50] candlesticks and by by that Holy place
[1:06:54] and it's giving light
[1:06:56] so now he he said it's a better
[1:06:59] light the candlesticks are giving light
[1:07:02] and that's to the man he quits his
[1:07:05] drinking quits his smoking quits lying
[1:07:09] quits stealing treats his neighbor right
[1:07:13] good to his wife or her good to her
[1:07:17] husband in the same way a man or a woman
[1:07:21] the believer he comes into a place where
[1:07:24] he's quick with all his meanness which
[1:07:28] is through the blood of
[1:07:30] sanctification he's called to a new life
[1:07:34] and he walks in there see he's moved
[1:07:37] he's walked in
[1:07:38] there he doesn't have to walk by the
[1:07:40] light out there whether the sun is
[1:07:43] shining whether it's gloomy whether
[1:07:45] whether whether he just lost his job or
[1:07:47] got fired or all the environment or
[1:07:49] whatever is happening in school whether
[1:07:51] you passed with a or you barely got
[1:07:53] through by the skin of your teeth or
[1:07:54] whatever happened out there that's
[1:07:56] irrelevant to this man cuz he's not he's
[1:07:59] he's got another light he doesn't have
[1:08:01] to walk by the light out there he's got
[1:08:03] a better light he's walking by the Light
[1:08:06] of the seven golden candlesticks which
[1:08:09] is burning olive oil and the olive oil
[1:08:12] was representing the Holy Spirit the
[1:08:14] fire was the baptism which brought
[1:08:17] baptizing so now this man has moved and
[1:08:20] you know a lot of people in the message
[1:08:21] just want to stay there that's all they
[1:08:23] want to stay are he baptized with Holy
[1:08:25] Ghost are you baptized with the Holy
[1:08:26] Ghost let me tell you something you're
[1:08:28] not into the you're not into the next
[1:08:30] Department yet you're not into the holy
[1:08:32] of holies yet you can have the gift of
[1:08:34] the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:08:36] remember still just a gift brother Bram
[1:08:38] said to me he says this took a pen out
[1:08:40] of his pocket he said this is a gift of
[1:08:43] the Holy Ghost but this is not the Holy
[1:08:46] Ghost the very person of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:49] can I say it again something that you
[1:08:51] all know well justification made way for
[1:08:55] San s ification sanctification made way
[1:08:58] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[1:09:03] for the Holy Ghost himself the person of
[1:09:07] God himself coming and dwelling in your
[1:09:11] being and so now this person has a
[1:09:13] better
[1:09:16] light brought into baptizing or even
[1:09:19] baptized right in there by the Holy
[1:09:21] Spirit but you're not hid away yet yet
[1:09:26] you're not behind the veil so if anyone
[1:09:30] comes to you and even during this
[1:09:32] convention to come and and that's that's
[1:09:34] as far as I oh you need to be baptized
[1:09:36] with the Holy Spirit I find people use
[1:09:39] that to destabilized people I'm telling
[1:09:43] you I'm giving you some sound
[1:09:45] instruction some people are are rather
[1:09:47] forward and maybe intimidating and say
[1:09:50] you think you have the Holy Ghost
[1:09:52] someone says that to you you let check
[1:09:55] down your heart look up right in their
[1:09:57] eye and their face and say I certainly
[1:10:01] do what do you
[1:10:03] got because often people will use that
[1:10:07] tactic to destabilize a person say say
[1:10:10] well uh uh say I got something for you I
[1:10:12] got a special Doctrine I got a special
[1:10:15] Revelation and all you need is
[1:10:19] this you know what I'm talking
[1:10:22] about you want to know where you're
[1:10:24] standing and know what you have and
[1:10:26] don't be ashamed of it and say I
[1:10:28] certainly do I've been birthed by this
[1:10:30] word and has been I've been birthed by
[1:10:33] the word and by the
[1:10:34] spirit
[1:10:37] Hallelujah quickly
[1:10:40] now but he says even in here here here's
[1:10:43] the problem with this place but there's
[1:10:46] days when those lights get
[1:10:48] dull there's days when the lamps smoke
[1:10:51] and the light's not so good there's
[1:10:54] times time when those lights have to be
[1:10:59] relitigated and you have to borrow a
[1:11:01] little from a
[1:11:02] neighbor to Light One Candle to the
[1:11:06] other it's still not a good light we're
[1:11:09] thankful for it but it's still not the
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:15] light I'd like to say this to conclude
[1:11:18] these two
[1:11:19] courts in these two courts the outer
[1:11:23] court and the inner cour Court these are
[1:11:27] two places where the battle really rages
[1:11:29] in the mind because the mind has not
[1:11:34] come the the the channels of the spirit
[1:11:39] are still very
[1:11:41] active I hope I can get this across to
[1:11:45] you the memory and the
[1:11:48] imagination and the conscience and the
[1:11:52] reasoning and the affection all the
[1:11:55] affection can do serious
[1:11:58] damage and all of those five
[1:12:02] channels I want to say to this
[1:12:04] congregation without any
[1:12:06] apology every one of us are afflicted in
[1:12:11] those channels if we allow Satan now he
[1:12:15] will use every
[1:12:17] opportunity that he possibly can he will
[1:12:20] use every device he will use every
[1:12:23] circumstance to get into one of those
[1:12:25] channels and begin to cause you distress
[1:12:29] and to occupy your thoughts and to keep
[1:12:32] you captivated by it the prophet said
[1:12:35] the Holy Spirit needs to blow those
[1:12:38] channels out and you know when he says
[1:12:41] it that way I I gather from that that
[1:12:44] he's not saying it in a very a delicate
[1:12:48] way he's not saying it you know we just
[1:12:50] need to have a new flow and we just need
[1:12:52] to have something nice happen he's
[1:12:54] saying the Holy Spirit needs to blow
[1:12:57] those channels out we need a blast from
[1:13:01] God he tries to he tries to cabbage down
[1:13:06] he tries to get his roots down and he
[1:13:09] needs to be
[1:13:11] removed he doesn't go simply he doesn't
[1:13:14] go just you know by invitation he has to
[1:13:18] be driven
[1:13:20] out I hope this means something to you
[1:13:24] now the Prophet said that this battle
[1:13:27] which was in heaven and you know this so
[1:13:29] well it's from the greatest battle ever
[1:13:31] fought this battle which was between the
[1:13:34] angels in heaven and Satan was cast out
[1:13:36] to the Earth he said when this great
[1:13:39] battle started on Earth there had to be
[1:13:42] a
[1:13:42] mutual Place meeting place there had to
[1:13:46] be a place selected for the battle to
[1:13:51] begin and this word I don't want you to
[1:13:54] forget it and for for this battle to
[1:13:58] rage for this battle to rage and that
[1:14:02] Battlegrounds began in the human mind
[1:14:07] your mind is a mutual Battle Ground
[1:14:12] that's been selected and both and Satan
[1:14:15] has a right there to that ground and the
[1:14:19] Warfare will take place in that ground
[1:14:21] and I say that that really rages in the
[1:14:25] outer court and in the inner Court those
[1:14:28] two courts is where this battle really
[1:14:30] rages you say well what is the answer
[1:14:33] I'm going to dwell on it now for just
[1:14:35] the next till I close when you move on
[1:14:39] if you're in that place and the mind has
[1:14:42] been engaged in a raging battle this way
[1:14:45] and that way and reasoning this and
[1:14:47] thinking that brother Ed is telling you
[1:14:50] today you need to pack up your bags and
[1:14:54] in this case I say leave your bags
[1:14:57] behind you need to make a clear-cut
[1:15:00] decision I am
[1:15:03] moving I am not going to live there any
[1:15:08] longer listen folks I'm not preaching a
[1:15:10] sermon I am giving instruction which I
[1:15:14] believe is from the Holy Spirit people
[1:15:17] in this congregation you need to say I
[1:15:19] am moving from that place I've had a
[1:15:23] mental Warfare on and you might say well
[1:15:26] just because I going to the holy of
[1:15:28] holies does do I do I lose my mind do I
[1:15:31] do I lose my thinking capacity no but in
[1:15:34] the holy of holies you become so
[1:15:37] absorbed so penetrated because there's a
[1:15:41] presence there that the holy spir in
[1:15:44] that presence that Satan cannot live in
[1:15:48] that
[1:15:50] presence he cannot live in that presence
[1:15:54] he doesn't have a right to that
[1:16:00] presence I'm going to go to the
[1:16:11] one and I've called this service this
[1:16:15] morning entering into his
[1:16:19] rest and now we come to the inner rest
[1:16:21] the holiest of all
[1:16:25] it's a real
[1:16:27] place and this is what Paul's whole
[1:16:30] subject's about he said they couldn't
[1:16:32] enter in because of unbelief if you have
[1:16:36] believed or attempted to believe in this
[1:16:39] service at any moment this is the moment
[1:16:42] now you need to really come to grips and
[1:16:44] saying oh God send your Holy Spirit and
[1:16:48] let me become so sensitized that I will
[1:16:51] grasp now every word this is where I
[1:16:54] need need to move into the pastor saying
[1:16:57] this is the purpose of this service and
[1:16:59] it is it is shake
[1:17:03] off see I can sense that even now Satan
[1:17:07] wants to you know uh kind of make make
[1:17:12] make our minds kind of dull and so on
[1:17:14] and so forth you shake that off you
[1:17:17] resist him now say I came here for this
[1:17:20] purpose I came here to do business with
[1:17:22] God I'm not going to allow this spirit
[1:17:25] to affect me at all I don't care where
[1:17:27] it comes from I'm not going to allow it
[1:17:29] I'm not going to allow it if you sense
[1:17:32] it beside you say in within yourself I
[1:17:34] resist that in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:17:36] I have conquering power within me over
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:47] Hallelujah here's the inner
[1:17:49] rest here's the person here's the
[1:17:51] prophet's description of the inner rest
[1:17:55] is not tossed
[1:17:58] about does not run from place to
[1:18:02] place doesn't fuss and
[1:18:05] fume and worry about
[1:18:10] things says sickness may
[1:18:14] come disappointments may
[1:18:17] come there isn't a person
[1:18:19] here that's us friends there isn't a
[1:18:23] person here that hasn't had
[1:18:26] disappointments hasn't had sicknesses
[1:18:29] come and this man this woman that's in
[1:18:32] there has had all of these things they
[1:18:34] don't fuss they don't
[1:18:37] fume they don't worry about
[1:18:41] things and he says this now I'm coming
[1:18:44] to the real Crux of my message this
[1:18:46] morning the thing that's really burning
[1:18:48] on my heart and I'm determined before
[1:18:50] God that this is going to be conveyed to
[1:18:52] you and it'll be off my hands
[1:18:55] and the holy spirit's going to bring it
[1:18:56] to your
[1:19:01] mind he says but the Christians at
[1:19:04] rest he keeps saying that the Christian
[1:19:07] is at rest it's the rest that Paul is
[1:19:11] speaking about there remain that some
[1:19:14] must enter into this rest it's for us I
[1:19:18] identify I say Apostle Paul you're
[1:19:21] prophesying about me
[1:19:24] in this day of distress in this day of
[1:19:27] violence in this day of inequities in
[1:19:31] this day when we travel around the world
[1:19:34] I tell you what you know I I got
[1:19:37] distressed I had some distress not the
[1:19:40] kind that I'm just preaching about but I
[1:19:41] had some distress within my heart while
[1:19:45] in usbekistan
[1:19:47] people earn $30 a month an average
[1:19:52] salary is $70 a month average salary a
[1:19:56] very well-paid person is $150 a
[1:20:00] month and before I left before I went
[1:20:04] there I just felt in my heart I I W
[1:20:08] would like to do
[1:20:10] something the poor have always been on
[1:20:13] my heart and I see children and I see
[1:20:17] them in slums and say I want to do
[1:20:20] something for them
[1:20:24] you know it's it's not
[1:20:27] easy I said to a minister I said to a
[1:20:30] pastor and I just related it the other
[1:20:31] day I I said to a pastor we were
[1:20:33] traveling on an airplane sitting beside
[1:20:36] me a good pastor this message I call him
[1:20:39] by his name because he's a good
[1:20:41] friend I said I'm going to ask you a
[1:20:43] question and I don't want you to answer
[1:20:46] me too
[1:20:47] soon I want you to really think this out
[1:20:50] and when you're done I like your answer
[1:20:54] right now here's a million dollar
[1:20:57] cash I'm putting it in your
[1:21:00] hands you have a million dollar
[1:21:03] cash for the gospel for the message you
[1:21:08] have a million dollars cash I want you
[1:21:12] to tell me what you're going to do with
[1:21:20] that he
[1:21:22] thought and he thought
[1:21:26] and he thought some
[1:21:28] more he finally said I don't
[1:21:32] know I don't know what i' do with
[1:21:35] it I said that's a dilemma isn't
[1:21:37] it you know something friends I have
[1:21:40] actually looked for people that would be
[1:21:43] real
[1:21:46] trustworthy men that could make sound
[1:21:49] decisions outside of their own
[1:21:52] environment outside of themselves say
[1:21:54] help these
[1:21:56] people and I did see a man I found a
[1:22:00] man a man who's had a hard time a man
[1:22:03] who's lived a hard life a man who's who
[1:22:06] Satan has almost destroyed him now he's
[1:22:09] married and he's got one or two little
[1:22:12] children and I I've I've determined in
[1:22:15] my heart I'm going to help that man he's
[1:22:18] living with two other families in a
[1:22:21] small
[1:22:23] apartment but you know what when you
[1:22:24] want to do good the scripture says evil
[1:22:28] is present with you when I would do good
[1:22:31] evil is present with you it's not easy
[1:22:34] to even determine I'm going to make a
[1:22:37] move I'm going to be decisive I'm going
[1:22:39] to make a move and if somebody of you
[1:22:41] here got a whole lot better advice and a
[1:22:44] lot better counsel I'd be happy to talk
[1:22:47] to you I say that with all
[1:22:49] sincerity and this
[1:22:51] congregation based on um a main thrust
[1:22:55] we want to help people this message is a
[1:22:59] blessed blessed thing but getting it out
[1:23:01] to people is not a simple thing it's not
[1:23:04] a simple matter but I will not be
[1:23:07] deterred from getting something that's
[1:23:10] fed my soul to someone else that to feed
[1:23:13] their soul oh they say well they speak
[1:23:15] another language and I won't let that
[1:23:17] hinder me you we won't let that hinder
[1:23:20] us we'll get it to them someway somehow
[1:23:27] are you with me and I appreciate people
[1:23:30] that we're going to live this life and
[1:23:32] and do whatever we can so these people
[1:23:36] and now he says and I I've got to get to
[1:23:38] this just give me about 10 more minutes
[1:23:40] and I'm going to close he said but the
[1:23:42] Christians at rest knowing this that God
[1:23:46] God's able to keep that which he has
[1:23:49] performed knowing that no matter what
[1:23:52] the thing is or how it looks there's
[1:23:54] neither sickness sorrow let me start
[1:23:58] with that and let let you say Amen
[1:23:59] there's neither sickness sorrow death
[1:24:04] there's neither starvation or anything
[1:24:07] that can separate us from the love of
[1:24:09] God that's in Jesus Christ there's
[1:24:12] nothing and that's why that person who's
[1:24:15] in there now get this here it is moving
[1:24:19] from the outer
[1:24:21] Court he the weather's this my job is
[1:24:24] this my marks is this so and and and
[1:24:28] we're affected by that move into the
[1:24:30] other place we got a better light oh I
[1:24:32] feel the Holy Spirit and and and but
[1:24:35] then it kind of you know the flame goes
[1:24:37] out and and it smokes up and and uh we
[1:24:41] find out that that's not a perfect light
[1:24:44] and then we find that there's another
[1:24:46] place the difference between the outer
[1:24:49] court and the inner Court there is a
[1:24:53] knowledge it's called a
[1:24:55] knowing when a person gets into that in
[1:24:58] and you get into that
[1:25:01] presence you know
[1:25:04] something that you couldn't know out
[1:25:07] there and out there there's a a special
[1:25:13] knowing those of you that are
[1:25:17] married you try to tell someone who's
[1:25:20] unmarried what it's all about
[1:25:24] can't really do it say the only way to
[1:25:27] know the only way you can really know is
[1:25:30] you get married and you'll know you
[1:25:33] never had children don't have children
[1:25:36] don't have
[1:25:37] children you can never really know what
[1:25:41] it is till you have them and when that
[1:25:44] Mother's gone through childbirth and
[1:25:46] holds that baby and the father is there
[1:25:50] and then they bring up that child you
[1:25:52] see it grow up through life try explain
[1:25:54] that try to give a scientific formula
[1:25:58] there is no formula until you've done it
[1:26:01] and there is no special formula that I
[1:26:03] can give you what it's like to be in
[1:26:06] that place but I can tell you you'll
[1:26:08] know something when you come in the
[1:26:11] presence of the almighty God that you'll
[1:26:14] never know anywhere else there's a
[1:26:17] knowing and that's why the Apostle John
[1:26:20] could say we know that we are of God how
[1:26:24] did he know that he'd been in that place
[1:26:27] we know we're born of God how could he
[1:26:30] say that he'd been in that
[1:26:39] presence no wonder the
[1:26:42] Apostle could
[1:26:45] say for the which cause Apostle Paul I
[1:26:50] also suffer these things nevertheless
[1:26:53] I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have
[1:26:55] believed and I'm persuaded that he's
[1:26:57] able to keep that which I've committed
[1:26:58] unto him against that day knowing and
[1:27:01] the Apostle John said but we know by
[1:27:04] this we know that we are the children of
[1:27:06] God and he said and if we know that he
[1:27:09] hear us whatsoever we ask we know that
[1:27:12] we have the petition whereever we
[1:27:14] desired of him he said again 5:18 we
[1:27:17] know that whatsoever whosoever is born
[1:27:19] of God sinth not 1 John 5:19 and we know
[1:27:23] that we are of God and the whole world
[1:27:26] lith in wickedness 1 John 5:20 and we
[1:27:29] know that the Son of God has come and
[1:27:31] hath given us an understanding that we
[1:27:34] may know him that is
[1:27:38] true the prophet said the
[1:27:41] veil dropped behind
[1:27:43] you the noise of the
[1:27:46] world and when the veil drops behind
[1:27:49] you and you experience this special
[1:27:52] place
[1:27:54] I'm speaking to every person
[1:27:57] here all the
[1:27:59] voices you're alone with God and all the
[1:28:03] voices the voices of your friends the
[1:28:06] voices of your
[1:28:09] family we hear voices every day and some
[1:28:12] of
[1:28:13] them we need that filter of the
[1:28:17] veil some of them we
[1:28:19] shouldn't shouldn't hit our ears and our
[1:28:23] sent
[1:28:26] you'll have to be the
[1:28:27] judge
[1:28:29] quickly how do I move into this hidden
[1:28:32] Place how do I move I really wrestled
[1:28:35] with this because I wanted to bring it
[1:28:38] to you before I
[1:28:40] close how do I move into this hidden
[1:28:42] place you say brother brandom we've got
[1:28:45] a picture here under
[1:28:47] consideration but how do you get to
[1:28:50] it what's the next thing how how do we
[1:28:54] get in
[1:28:56] there here's the way you come
[1:28:59] in in the
[1:29:01] pattern anything that was
[1:29:04] dead lived when it came in that
[1:29:07] presence took Aaron's
[1:29:09] rod and the prophet said and notice when
[1:29:13] they put Aaron's rod in there it
[1:29:16] budded blossomed and bore
[1:29:20] fruit that's the whole cycle of life
[1:29:24] regardless of what state you're in or
[1:29:26] where you're at or what position you're
[1:29:27] at you move into that place regardless
[1:29:31] of how dead you may feel how untouched
[1:29:35] you may feel how unconscious you might
[1:29:38] feel to God this morning I have news for
[1:29:41] you I'm inviting you the holy spirit's
[1:29:44] inviting you you move into that place
[1:29:48] and the prophet said you are a stick
[1:29:51] every man woman child here is a stick
[1:29:54] of some kind and you're taking off the
[1:29:56] branch of humanity which God has
[1:30:00] created God created his son in the
[1:30:03] beginning you may be
[1:30:05] fallen you may be dead you may be
[1:30:09] alienated from
[1:30:11] God but by that in creation you were
[1:30:15] created a Son of
[1:30:17] God you may bounce
[1:30:20] around and be respected and honored out
[1:30:23] there in in the courts out here you may
[1:30:26] bounce around he says and be respected
[1:30:29] but if you ever get into the Glorious
[1:30:31] place and hit away with God you'll yield
[1:30:34] to what you're supposed to do so you
[1:30:37] take a dead sinner alienated from God
[1:30:41] without hope without Christ and put him
[1:30:43] in that presence in this great glorious
[1:30:46] Tabernacle in there he will yield fruit
[1:30:48] of the Holy Spirit love joy peace
[1:30:52] longsuffering he'll yield
[1:30:55] those he says we come
[1:30:58] in and here's how we come in number
[1:31:01] one by refreshing
[1:31:04] yourself in a quiet time with
[1:31:09] God this life is very
[1:31:12] busy I don't have to tell
[1:31:15] you your life's busy my life's
[1:31:19] busy but the times that God is most near
[1:31:23] to me me is when I get alone
[1:31:27] alone not with my wife in a
[1:31:31] car not out where I'm seeing all kinds
[1:31:33] of people I get alone all
[1:31:37] alone and begin to talk to him and tell
[1:31:41] him just
[1:31:43] exactly what do you say brother
[1:31:46] Ed well sometimes I feel like a I feel
[1:31:49] like a a dead
[1:31:50] post you feel like that sometime yeah I
[1:31:53] feel like
[1:31:54] that so what do you say to him well I
[1:31:56] get
[1:32:00] down
[1:32:04] lord I just feel like a stick of
[1:32:07] wood I feel like a I feel like a fence
[1:32:10] post I feel like a telephone pole I
[1:32:13] don't feel
[1:32:15] anything I know that you're
[1:32:20] real and I start thinking now
[1:32:25] about the
[1:32:26] various little places that he met
[1:32:30] me and I begin to rehearse those I
[1:32:33] remember back there it was a real
[1:32:37] difficult
[1:32:38] time but I know it was you I know it was
[1:32:42] you I never made it on my own I know
[1:32:45] that you met me back there and then
[1:32:48] there was another time later in my
[1:32:50] life and I knew that was you I knew it
[1:32:54] was you nothing could do that but you
[1:32:58] there was a time when it seemed that all
[1:33:01] hell came against me ready to tear
[1:33:04] everything
[1:33:06] up but you gave me a
[1:33:09] word you know something
[1:33:11] friends you don't do that very
[1:33:14] long you start telling him and thanking
[1:33:18] him and his presence would just come and
[1:33:22] Surround you begin to move through you
[1:33:24] and permeate you and you enter into a
[1:33:28] relationship are things any different
[1:33:30] outside no not necessarily but they're
[1:33:33] different inside and you have a new
[1:33:36] found strength you have a new found that
[1:33:39] relationship invalidates what the
[1:33:42] weather is and what the job is and what
[1:33:44] the finances are and what's happening in
[1:33:46] the church and what's happening in this
[1:33:48] person or that person we have great
[1:33:50] burdens but that presence invalidates it
[1:33:53] it over comes it it gives you strength
[1:33:55] beyond
[1:33:58] that and with this I
[1:34:04] close brother brandham told a
[1:34:09] story he told it 38 times
[1:34:37] story is about you all know it
[1:34:40] well but I saw something I've never seen
[1:34:43] in all my
[1:34:45] years the story is of the slave broker
[1:34:54] that was buying
[1:34:58] slaves and he
[1:35:00] came to this
[1:35:04] traiter and he sees a young
[1:35:07] man that is very very
[1:35:10] different than the
[1:35:13] others and brother brandham
[1:35:19] says slave broker said I'll take him
[1:35:24] no he said he's not for
[1:35:27] sale he said but he's so
[1:35:30] different he's so different from all the
[1:35:35] others what makes him
[1:35:38] different he said do you feed him
[1:35:40] different no he said eats the Dame eats
[1:35:43] the same
[1:35:45] Mana the man the Elder Court eats the
[1:35:47] same Mana the man in the inner Court
[1:35:49] eats the same Mana as the man who's in
[1:35:50] the Holy place they all eat the same
[1:35:52] Mana says eats the same food eats in the
[1:35:55] galley do you do you treat him different
[1:35:58] do you treat him better no the man in
[1:36:01] the Holy place he has troubles and the
[1:36:02] Man in the inner Court he has troubles
[1:36:04] and the Man in the outer Court they all
[1:36:05] have their
[1:36:07] troubles do they worship in a different
[1:36:09] place no they all Worship in the same
[1:36:12] place what makes him so
[1:36:16] different he said I often wondered that
[1:36:21] myself to one day I asked him
[1:36:24] he told me he was a he was a son of a
[1:36:27] king of a
[1:36:31] tribe in
[1:36:35] Africa it said and he conducts himself
[1:36:37] in such a way and 10 times out of the 38
[1:36:41] times 10 times brother Brandon makes
[1:36:44] this comment and makes this reference
[1:36:47] that this young man said to his broker
[1:36:49] and the broker said to him he he lives
[1:36:51] this way he acts this way
[1:36:54] to keep the morale of the others
[1:37:01] up so it isn't only that he had he had a
[1:37:05] knowing when you come into a place and
[1:37:08] somebody tried to tell you you haven't
[1:37:10] met God say I'm sorry sir I'm sorry
[1:37:14] ma'am you have no idea what you're
[1:37:16] talking about I
[1:37:18] knew I'm a son of a king I knew know I'm
[1:37:24] the daughter of a king I happen to know
[1:37:28] the Royal seed that I came from I happen
[1:37:32] to know the family I'm associated with I
[1:37:36] happen to know the God who has given me
[1:37:41] birth I have experienced
[1:37:43] this and he said with that
[1:37:46] knowing he conducted himself in such a
[1:37:49] way he just handled himself differently
[1:37:54] to keep the moral the morale of the
[1:37:57] others up somebody beside you somebody
[1:38:01] in this
[1:38:02] congregation isn't having the same
[1:38:05] knowing that you have but they need to
[1:38:08] be able to look at you and
[1:38:12] say now that person is so
[1:38:16] different that brother that sister that
[1:38:19] young person is so
[1:38:22] different I
[1:38:23] crave to live that kind of
[1:38:26] life I crave to have that kind of
[1:38:32] Victory and there is a there's a
