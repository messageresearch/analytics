[1:34] I'm by wonderful
[1:37] [Music]
[1:50] gra
[1:52] Hallelujah glad to be in the house of
[1:55] God Amen come with
[1:58] expectation then God will
[2:00] certainly see that you're not
[2:02] disappointed if you put in for a small
[2:04] order that's what you get but we ask
[2:09] largely then that's what we'll get amen
[2:12] God bless you you may be
[2:15] seated just going to make a couple of uh
[2:19] announcements first the deacons have
[2:22] asked me
[2:23] to uh make more clear regarding
[2:28] the uh announcement which we made a uh
[2:33] regarding prayer requests rather than
[2:35] bringing them here and having us read
[2:38] them uh but they wanted to know and I
[2:41] guess there was some questions to them
[2:43] are are the people that are not well
[2:45] here able to be prayed for oh my
[2:47] goodness absolutely that's what we're
[2:49] here for and you're coming and be prayed
[2:52] for all it was was concerning longw
[2:55] written out requests and we're reading
[2:57] them and reading them service after
[2:59] service service so we said that bring a
[3:02] cloth bring an anointed cloth bring a
[3:05] bring something that you would like to
[3:06] have prayed over and we'll pray for it
[3:08] here and
[3:11] uh I I think maybe just writing out a
[3:13] request comes a lot
[3:16] easier and uh I I noticed since we made
[3:20] that request we haven't had a single
[3:23] handkerchief and that's what the Bible
[3:25] says so if you if you're really burdened
[3:29] and you really want to have somebody
[3:30] prayed for that's not here you'd like to
[3:33] send something to them and have them
[3:35] have have a a cloth or anointed cloth
[3:38] prayed for then that's what we'll do
[3:41] here because I noticed brother brandom
[3:42] says on the tapes we've got all these
[3:44] anointed we got these cloths and these
[3:46] handkerchiefs and aprons and whatever
[3:48] more and they took from the bodies of
[3:51] the Apostles and and gave those cloths
[3:54] and people were healed and so I just
[3:57] want to go back to the pattern I think
[3:59] that's fine I really think that's fine
[4:02] when we're a lot smaller and it is
[4:04] actually this isn't this isn't anything
[4:05] sudden at all it's been really on my
[4:07] mind for a long time and I'm rather slow
[4:10] to move and do things sometimes but
[4:13] Moses was slow brother Bram said he was
[4:16] slow so I'm in good
[4:18] company we we'll all be slow we been
[4:22] don't want to be too slow preaching
[4:23] however we take too much
[4:26] time uh so I hope that that is clear we
[4:30] we're just happy to pray with anybody
[4:32] that's here physically that's not well
[4:35] you feel free as always to come and be
[4:38] prayed for and this is the House of
[4:42] Deliverance not only a house of worship
[4:44] a House of Deliverance and I quite
[4:46] frankly am a very firm believer that he
[4:49] confirmed his word with signs following
[4:53] and if the word is being preached you
[4:55] should expect an answer from God don't
[4:59] come here
[5:00] not expecting to receive from God you
[5:03] should come expecting to receive
[5:05] whatever your need is
[5:12] amen going to be turning to the word in
[5:14] a few minutes but there's a verse of a a
[5:18] song a very common song at Calvary which
[5:22] we all know and
[5:26] uh the last verse we're just going to
[5:29] say the chor and the last verse and then
[5:31] the
[5:32] chorus the last verse says oh the love
[5:36] that Drew salvation's
[5:39] plan all the grace that brought it down
[5:44] to
[5:45] man oh the mighty Gulf that God did span
[5:50] at
[5:51] Calvary and we're coming up to Easter
[5:54] now we got a flyer in the mail and
[5:57] perhaps you did too it was from
[5:58] Jehovah's Witness
[6:00] es and they were making a an
[6:02] announcement the greatest man the death
[6:05] of the greatest man that ever lived and
[6:08] I had glanced it over but they didn't
[6:10] say anything about his
[6:12] resurrection might have something to do
[6:14] with what they believe I don't know I
[6:17] have some pretty good idea but we're not
[6:20] celebrating a death only we're
[6:22] celebrating a
[6:24] resurrection we're not just not just the
[6:27] death but it's the life that we're
[6:29] celebr crating and it was a life it was
[6:32] a body that couldn't
[6:34] corrupt it was a life that couldn't stay
[6:36] in the
[6:38] Tomb and it's a life that's been passed
[6:42] on Hallelujah all the love that Drew
[6:46] salvation's plan and all the grace that
[6:50] brought it down to man this is very very
[6:53] much in line with what I want to speak
[6:55] about today and so I've got to try to
[6:57] capture capture your thoughts early
[7:00] would ask you to be very focused and for
[7:04] me help me all right you do that it'll

[9:16] year especially
[9:18] Lord the time of you entering in and the
[9:23] people were praising and worshiping and
[9:25] throwing their garments down waving
[9:29] palms and a short time later crying
[9:32] crucify
[9:33] crucify but there was no great voice or
[9:36] shouting except the Angels rejoicing
[9:39] when you raised and came out of the Tomb
[9:43] and began to make yourself known and
[9:45] today we're here to give you thanks Lord
[9:48] Jesus how thankful we are that you have
[9:51] made yourself known almighty God by the
[9:55] Holy Spirit you have sent the spirit of

[10:17] your power bind every evil spirit every
[10:20] hindering Spirit Lord I pray you'll
[10:23] loose oh God our our minds that seem
[10:27] so so encumbered sometime I pray that
[10:31] you'll remove all the weights oh God and
[10:34] the things that so easily beset us
[10:36] father in the name of Jesus give Liberty
[10:38] to your word I pray give unction to it
[10:42] let the Holy Spirit be the speaker I
[10:44] pray and may each person receive what
[10:48] they have need of bless all that are
[10:52] with us father streaming at this moment
[10:55] may it not just be a stream of are my
[11:00] voice but may there be a stream of the
[11:03] Holy Spirit the very presence of the
[11:06] Divine one coming into their rooms and
[11:10] into their places of worship in Jesus
[11:13] Christ's name we ask it
[11:15] amen
[11:18] amen I'll invite you to take your Bibles
[11:21] and turn to John's gospel the first
[11:26] chapter and we're going to be reading
[11:32] such a familiar scripture starting with
[11:34] verse
[11:36] one down to verse 5 and then we'll read
[11:39] verse 14 keep your Bibles open because
[11:42] we're turning to other uh brief
[11:45] scriptures after
[11:49] this in the beginning was the word and
[11:53] the Word was with God and the Word was
[11:57] God the same was in the beginning with
[12:01] God all things were made by him and
[12:04] without him was not anything made that
[12:07] was
[12:08] made in him was life and the life was
[12:12] the light of
[12:13] man and the light shineth in darkness
[12:17] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[12:20] down to verse
[12:23] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[12:26] among us and we beheld his glory GL the
[12:29] glory as of the only begotten of the
[12:32] father full of grace and truth down to
[12:36] verse
[12:37] 18 no man hath seen God at any
[12:41] time the only begotten son which is in
[12:44] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[12:49] him turn to chapter 8 if you would
[12:52] please
[12:59] in verse
[13:04] 42 Jesus said unto
[13:08] them if God were your
[13:11] father you would love me for I proceeded
[13:16] forth and came from
[13:19] God oh the grace that brought it down to
[13:24] man for I proceeded forth and came from
[13:28] God
[13:29] neither came I of
[13:32] myself but he sent
[13:41] me turn to chapter 20
[14:00] in verse
[14:03] 21 he just showed them his hands in his
[14:06] sight after the
[14:08] resurrection then said Jesus to them
[14:11] again peace be unto
[14:14] you as my father hath sent
[14:19] me even so send I
[14:23] you and when he had said this he
[14:27] breathed on them and said unto them
[14:31] receive ye the Holy
[14:34] Ghost as my father ha sent me he said I
[14:38] proceeded forth from
[14:41] God and now he's saying after his
[14:44] resurrection as my father hath sent me
[14:49] even so send I you and when he had said
[14:53] this he breathed on them and said
[14:57] receive ye the Holy Ghost you may be
[15:05] seated the scripture tells us also Peter
[15:08] preaching and soon
[15:12] after this experience and they'd receiv
[15:14] received the Holy Spirit he's telling
[15:16] the people how that God anointed Jesus
[15:21] of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[15:24] power who went about doing good and
[15:27] healing all that were open oppressed of
[15:29] the devil for God was with him whenever
[15:33] we read John
[15:36] 1 it always confronts a minister with a
[15:39] tremendous
[15:41] challenge because we're starting in the
[15:45] beginning in the
[15:47] beginning was the word and from the
[15:50] beginning you can go anywhere it's so
[15:53] vast it's
[15:55] so such an expanse of of
[15:59] place to
[16:00] go and it's always a little bit of a
[16:03] challenge
[16:04] to Where Do We Go From Here in the
[16:07] beginning but I want
[16:09] to I want to focus our thoughts because
[16:12] I've been speaking the last two
[16:15] Sundays on anointed for Rapture so I
[16:19] want to tie together I want to continue
[16:23] with this subject of
[16:25] anointing and in the first message
[16:29] I brought the uh process of anointing
[16:33] and how it was an Eastern it was in the
[16:36] Eastern culture and I I took it on the
[16:40] physical side and how the first time
[16:42] anointing really comes in God actually
[16:46] referred to Jacob anointing or it
[16:51] doesn't even say he anointed but he
[16:53] poured oil upon the pillar that he had
[16:58] slept on it with ston
[17:01] stones that he had made for a pillow and
[17:05] it was at that time he had that dream
[17:09] and he saw the Angels ascending and
[17:12] descending and the ladder was on Earth
[17:15] but it stretched into heaven and he had
[17:18] that dream and he was so impacted by
[17:22] that dream so affected by that dream and
[17:25] the presence that it left him with he
[17:28] said this this is bethl this is the Gate
[17:31] of Heaven and he called it bethl which
[17:34] is the house of God and he was so
[17:38] affected by that that was the first
[17:40] instance he made an altar or raised up
[17:44] those stones that he' slept on and used
[17:47] as a pillow and he poured oil upon them
[17:51] and then God later reminded him and God
[17:55] used the word the pillar that thou D
[17:58] anoint
[17:59] and the and the vow that you made and he
[18:03] made the vow if you'll be with me and so
[18:06] that was the first instance of the
[18:08] anointing and just take you quickly
[18:09] through it and then God told Moses then
[18:14] later now it's it's the a Abraham's
[18:17] children so he told
[18:19] Moses make oil and make it a fragrant
[18:24] oil make it for anointing oil and you'll
[18:27] make it fragrant and then later he told
[18:30] them anoint the priests the sons of
[18:32] Aaron and then later he anoint Aaron the
[18:36] high priest and anoint the Altar and
[18:39] anoint the th things that are in the
[18:41] Tabernacle and it just began to ex
[18:44] expand in its understanding and meaning
[18:47] and the people understood because they
[18:49] had used that they used that even in in
[18:52] in their daily life I won't say daily
[18:54] life but they were acquainted with the
[18:57] act of anointing but now it was taking a
[19:00] whole spiritual becoming very very
[19:03] sacred and to the Hebrews they
[19:06] understood that anointing in the sacred
[19:09] sense when something was being anointed
[19:12] it was being
[19:13] consecrated and the and the fact the
[19:16] very Act of the anointing upon the
[19:19] individual especially when it was on an
[19:21] individual their understanding was and
[19:24] this is really fundamental to the
[19:27] message this morning as it was to the
[19:29] last two messages but I I want to really
[19:32] nail this down is because God in his
[19:36] people which were the Hebrews they
[19:39] understood that when something was
[19:41] anointed in the in another realm in the
[19:45] Divine realm they understood that
[19:47] something from God was being
[19:51] transferred from the Divine one to that
[19:55] individual and so now you want to think
[19:58] of this transferral because the message
[20:02] this morning I want to consider this
[20:05] incredible
[20:06] transferral that from the beginning in
[20:09] the beginning was the word I want to
[20:13] start from the beginning or from the
[20:16] Eternal
[20:18] one
[20:20] transferal from him came the word in the
[20:23] beginning was the word but in the very
[20:26] beginning there there was God
[20:29] alone the prophet describes him I'm not
[20:32] going to spend a lot of time in it but
[20:34] he was alone God by himself and from him
[20:38] came the logos or the word logos is
[20:42] simply the Greek term for word and then
[20:46] that word came and was made flesh that
[20:50] was
[20:51] transferred on further down oh the grace
[20:55] that brought it down to man and now it's
[20:58] it's it's a transferral and it came on
[21:01] down into man and from Christ into
[21:05] Spirit form and from Spirit form into a
[21:09] people it's a great operation that God
[21:13] had in his mind that is the the that
[21:17] that's why we have that I idea that
[21:19] concept of the anointing and this was
[21:21] the concept they had that when something
[21:24] was anointed it was something all away
[21:26] from the Divine one through some process
[21:30] that God had in his mind to bring it and
[21:33] and transferring something that was
[21:35] actually Divine holy sacred to that
[21:42] individual
[21:44] amen
[21:46] Ignatius say says
[21:48] this for there is one God who made
[21:52] himself manifest through Jesus Christ
[21:56] his
[21:57] son who is his
[21:59] logos proceeding from his
[22:03] silence saying Ignatius is bringing the
[22:07] thought that God was silent but now he
[22:10] brings forth a voice he brings forth a
[22:14] sound through Jesus Christ this process
[22:17] I don't know if God was silent or not
[22:20] but that is what ignacius had said Jesus
[22:23] said I've proceeded from God and when he
[22:27] used the word proceed proceeded it isn't
[22:29] just that I've come forth from God or
[22:32] that I've come forth to proceed we say
[22:35] well to proceed is to make progress to
[22:38] go forward and to have motion proceed
[22:42] but when Jesus used the word it was not
[22:45] just to say that there was movement but
[22:47] it was to identify where the movement
[22:51] commenced and that is why he said I have
[22:54] proceeded and come forth from God
[22:59] he identified where he he came from I
[23:02] proceeded forth and came forth from God
[23:06] and as the father hath sent me so send I
[23:11] you we are to know emphatically where we
[23:15] came
[23:17] from we didn't originate we didn't
[23:20] originate in our mother's
[23:22] womb we didn't originate in our father's
[23:25] sperm we originated in the mind of God
[23:30] we came from God Jesus knew that Jesus
[23:33] never identified himself say I come from
[23:35] Mary's
[23:38] womb I come from
[23:41] God hallelujah it's a great plan a great
[23:45] operation I've come from God and I go to
[23:48] God it is I've proceeded I have come
[23:51] from one place to
[23:55] another I've come down
[23:59] I've made my
[24:00] appearance and thus Jesus was anointed
[24:03] brother brandham said in and show us the
[24:07] father in Tom's service on Wednesday
[24:10] night I was so so very blessed and I
[24:14] know that you were as
[24:15] well and he he was speaking on show us
[24:18] the father and it sufficeth us and I
[24:22] thought it was just really marvelous how
[24:24] he was bringing the thought from it
[24:26] sufficeth us it will be sufficient
[24:29] it's enough that's what I need and
[24:31] whatever our situation was just to
[24:33] repeat a little of his words whatever
[24:36] whatever your situation is today he used
[24:39] it for Wednesday I'll use it for this
[24:40] morning whatever wherever you're at
[24:44] spiritually or materially or physically
[24:47] or any other way but just show us the
[24:50] father and that'll be sufficient all we
[24:53] need to do is see him all you need to do
[24:56] you don't need to see me you don't need
[24:57] to see your friends your peers you don't
[25:00] need to see who you're have so much
[25:02] wonderful fellowship with in the church
[25:04] you need to see him and that'll suffice
[25:07] that'll be sufficient we need to say
[25:09] that's all that I really need and in
[25:12] that message show us the father uh
[25:14] brother brandham he said let's take a
[25:17] little trip he he's actually making
[25:22] this a a a drama let's take a little
[25:25] trip to see who he was
[25:29] and he said you can find out whether God
[25:32] was in his son or not take a little trip
[25:36] and it goes a 100 million years before
[25:39] there was ever a star in the sky there
[25:42] was God and God was there
[25:46] then and I'm I'm abbreviating some of
[25:49] this he says and then the
[25:51] Loos and don't get lost when we just say
[25:53] that the word now he's giving the
[25:55] process and then the logos went out from
[25:59] God which was Christ the
[26:03] anointing that went out and I haven't
[26:06] been able to escape this for the last
[26:08] weeks the logos this great Eternal being
[26:14] the Divine One the god that fills all
[26:17] times with the God that's so mysterious
[26:20] that you couldn't begin to understand
[26:21] him I couldn't begin to understand him
[26:23] but he wants to be known he wants to
[26:26] reveal himself he wants to have
[26:30] Fellowship brother Brandon said Jesus
[26:32] when he was here on Earth he only asked
[26:34] for one thing for our fellowship why
[26:37] because he came forth from God he
[26:39] proceeded from God had the he was the
[26:42] attribute of God he wanted
[26:46] fellowship if we could grasp that and so
[26:49] he came forth from God and the Loos went
[26:51] out of God which was Christ the
[26:55] anointing that went out so no wonder the
[26:58] Jews or the Hebrews had that
[27:00] understanding that something was being
[27:04] transferred I've looked into what some
[27:06] other Scholars have said about the
[27:09] anointing and about the logos and about
[27:12] the great Eternal one and I can tell you
[27:16] that no one and I have I've read some
[27:19] things that make your head spin a bit
[27:22] but when a prophet comes he can say it
[27:25] in such a way so that you can you can
[27:28] actually grasp a hold of it you've got
[27:31] something that you can sink your teeth
[27:33] into you can get around it with your
[27:35] mind and even though it may jar us a
[27:38] little bit yet it it it it captivates
[27:41] you it's so wonderful and so when he
[27:44] begins to say the anointing that went
[27:47] out and now he said no man he said we're
[27:50] standing on the banister watching The
[27:52] Creation come into existence and see
[27:55] whether he was his son whether see
[27:58] whether he's his son now but now watch
[28:01] this transferral the logos the word went
[28:05] out from this great being brother B say
[28:08] another place perhaps a little light we
[28:10] see it it starts to circle out and it's
[28:13] the logos it's something coming out from
[28:16] God but now what's in the mind of God
[28:18] because now that is why the Jews had
[28:21] this this something is being transferred
[28:24] and what this transferral now comes and
[28:27] what we have in the the scripture in the
[28:29] beginning in the beginning was the word
[28:32] but this the Bible says tells us in the
[28:34] beginning and God said let there be and
[28:38] we find now that it begins to transfer
[28:41] the transferal comes into a creation and
[28:44] I don't want to go in uh spend a lot of
[28:46] time on it but he began to transfer life
[28:49] he chose and selected this planet that
[28:53] we're
[28:55] on oh my
[28:59] this molten
[29:02] Mass this little speck of nothing is it
[29:06] we the prophet calls it a clinker that
[29:10] perhaps flew off the sun this little
[29:14] here we're sitting today and we're all
[29:17] part of what came out of the ashes out
[29:20] of the remains and God was making in his
[29:25] mind was making a structured person
[29:28] he was laying out his 2x4s like a
[29:31] contractor making the uh calcium and the
[29:35] potassium and whatever more goes in to
[29:38] make up our bodies that we're sitting in
[29:40] here today God had us in his mind
[29:44] billions of years ago if there is such a
[29:46] thing do you believe that and now he's
[29:49] bringing it and now he begins to
[29:50] transfer himself it begins to transfer
[29:54] life and the and the prophet said he he
[29:57] spoke because because there were seeds
[29:59] down there the seeds were buried let
[30:01] there be light because there had to be
[30:03] something that the light could re that
[30:06] the seeds could respond to and so light
[30:10] comes light is born in a region that is
[30:15] that this Earth can respond to and he's
[30:18] chosen this Earth and he's actually
[30:22] anointing the Earth as it were because
[30:24] he's pouring out he's pouring out the
[30:27] whole born of his creative power upon
[30:31] the Earth this Earth and then he says
[30:35] let the Earth bring forth what's he
[30:38] doing he's
[30:39] transferring something that went out
[30:41] from himself it went out of the bosom of
[30:44] almighty God it was the logos it was the
[30:46] word and the word spoke and now I doubt
[30:50] if he spoke English I doubt if he spoke
[30:52] Hebrew I don't know what he said I don't
[30:55] know how it was but it was an utterance
[30:58] let the Earth bring forth and the Earth
[31:00] began to bring forth something from this
[31:03] logos was transferred to the very Earth
[31:07] and out of the earth began to grow herb
[31:10] and trees and all manner of things and
[31:13] flowers of the field and it it it just
[31:16] blossomed with a massive amount of life
[31:19] because it was coming out of the bosom
[31:21] of God can you say amen and that wasn't
[31:25] sufficient he had more in his bosom and
[31:29] so he said let the waters bring forth
[31:33] and the waters came alive I don't care
[31:36] whether it took a million 10 million or
[31:38] 100 million years had nothing to do I
[31:40] don't care how it happened but it
[31:42] happened and that's how it happened
[31:45] because God said let it bring forth and
[31:48] the animal kingdom came forth and Higher
[31:50] and Higher and Higher came this because
[31:54] God is
[31:55] transferring it's like he's anointing
[31:58] the Earth with life he's transferring
[32:01] upon it pouring out the Horn of his
[32:06] life and
[32:08] then he must have his own image there
[32:12] and he makes a
[32:14] man let us make man in our
[32:17] image and and when he had done that
[32:20] there was no no one to till the
[32:23] ground man was made in the image of God
[32:26] God is a spirit Jesus said so he must
[32:29] make a man to till the ground and to
[32:33] care for the earth and the garden and he
[32:37] brings forth and forms
[32:40] him out of the earth out of the
[32:43] elements and there was a
[32:45] body and then the scripture
[32:47] says and he
[32:50] breathed into
[32:52] man into his nostrils and Man became a
[32:57] living soul
[32:59] soul that is different from just spoken
[33:06] word he spoke his word and the Earth
[33:09] brought forth he spoke his word and the
[33:11] waters brought forth he spoke his word
[33:14] and all of the life came forth all the
[33:16] levels of Life came forth but he never
[33:18] breathed into
[33:20] them it was this breath that separated
[33:24] the man from all other even though it
[33:27] all came out of God came out of the very
[33:30] bosom of God he's expressing himself but
[33:34] he breathed into him and Man became a
[33:37] living soul and Jesus when they had
[33:41] heard his word they heard the spoken
[33:44] word and they had the spoken word of the
[33:46] prophets but it required something
[33:51] further and he told them as a father ha
[33:55] sent me as a father have sent me so send
[33:58] I
[34:06] you as I have come out of the father as
[34:09] I have proceeded out from God that's how
[34:13] I am sending you I came from the bosom
[34:16] of God and you are just an
[34:19] extension of that coming forth and now I
[34:23] send you exactly as I have been sent out
[34:27] I send you I came out from God I am a
[34:32] I've been transferred from God out of
[34:35] God out of his very bosom out of his
[34:38] very attributes I've been sent out and
[34:41] as I've been sent I send
[34:43] you you have no more to you have no more
[34:47] right to doubt that than Jesus had to
[34:49] doubt that he came out of
[34:53] God you have no right to doubt
[34:56] that and when when he had said
[34:59] this when he had said this he breathed
[35:03] on them and said receive ye the Holy
[35:08] Ghost it wasn't sufficient even to say
[35:11] it just to say it they knew that they
[35:14] must go and T they must go and wait and
[35:16] there would be something that would
[35:18] literally take place and with and there
[35:21] was a r rushing Mighty Wind and that
[35:24] filled the whole place and they were all
[35:27] filled with the Holy Ghost and at that
[35:30] moment that 120 was the only 120 on the
[35:34] earth that was different from all other
[35:39] mankind
[35:41] Hallelujah even as Adam was different
[35:44] from everything else from all other all
[35:46] others had life but these had a
[35:49] different kind of Life the transferral
[35:52] of God himself of his own breath of his
[35:55] own life of his own nature of his own
[35:57] own character come into the
[36:01] people and that is still in force today
[36:05] and that is what's needed amongst the
[36:08] Believers of this message is the
[36:11] transferral not just to hear a tape not
[36:14] just to read a book but to have the
[36:17] author of the book To Breathe Into You
[36:22] the
[36:26] breath and I want to tell you whatever
[36:29] you think of me or whatever anyone
[36:31] whoever hears
[36:33] this service here what I have to say and
[36:38] this I
[36:40] believe that when
[36:42] God when he spoke and creation came and
[36:45] so on then he began to speak directly to
[36:48] a
[36:50] people in the mountain God speaking to
[36:54] the people and the people came to the
[36:57] pro Prophet Moses was already a prophet
[37:00] they came to Moses their prophet and
[37:03] said don't have God speak to
[37:07] us we can't bear
[37:10] this let God speak to you and you speak
[37:15] to us and so God
[37:19] agreed he
[37:21] complied and now that was the first
[37:24] instance now we have a vessel God
[37:29] decreed that a vessel a human vessel
[37:32] shall be his it will be his uh uh
[37:36] conduit is as I if I can say it that way
[37:39] it will be his his his method his
[37:43] process to convey his
[37:46] breath from himself to the people and so
[37:51] he would have His prophets his
[37:55] seers sometimes they were called seers
[37:57] and again I refer to brother Tom's
[37:59] message on Wednesday whenever God would
[38:03] do something to manifest himself a
[38:07] remarkable way he would have a sear to
[38:09] identify that changing of his
[38:14] mask and when we grasp the principle
[38:18] then we can trans then we can in our
[38:20] minds take that principle and move it up
[38:23] to the present time God he had to now he
[38:27] had is part of his Pro and he knew that
[38:29] before the foundation of the world that
[38:31] this would take place and so now God
[38:34] raises up prophets and the prophets
[38:37] become his instrument through which his
[38:40] breath will flow amen it's not through
[38:43] their mind it is simply through their
[38:46] mouth and Moses spoke one language
[38:50] brother brandham spoke another language
[38:52] The Messengers spoke other languages
[38:55] Paul spoke another language he spoke
[38:57] more than one language but it all was
[38:59] the same thing God
[39:03] transferring what was coming out of him
[39:06] what the Hebrews call an
[39:08] anointing God he in he
[39:12] impregnated his word with his life you
[39:17] could not separate the life of God from
[39:19] the word of God you could say the word
[39:22] is his life and the life of his is his
[39:24] word it's synonymous it's one and the
[39:26] same so God infused he impregnated his
[39:31] word with his own life and then breathed
[39:35] that word through His prophets it was
[39:38] actually the Breath of God so when you
[39:41] receive that not just when you read it
[39:44] with your eyes or hear it with your
[39:46] physical ears but when you receive it in
[39:49] your soul then that life that's why
[39:52] Jesus said the word is the seed it has
[39:55] within it it has all a compound uh uh uh
[40:00] all the compounds That's essential for
[40:03] bringing forth whatever that word in it
[40:06] season
[40:08] said and that is why Jesus could take in
[40:12] Luke 4 and say the spirit of the Lord
[40:16] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[40:20] heal a broken hearted to lose the
[40:22] prisoners because that word was for him
[40:25] and to preach the acceptable year the
[40:27] Lord this day is this scripture
[40:30] fulfilled in your ears and that promised
[40:33] word which was prophesied by Malachi and
[40:37] by Isaiah was in him and it came forth
[40:41] to life in
[40:44] him he received it he did not receive a
[40:49] message for a Rapture taking a whole
[40:52] group of people into a body change but
[40:56] the prophet the Prophet uh Paul he gave
[41:00] that prophetic seed and God breathed out
[41:03] from him in seed form those promises
[41:08] that we shall not all
[41:11] sleep but we shall all be changed I ask
[41:16] you who was that for who was that
[41:19] intended
[41:20] for who who who who what what was the
[41:23] purpose of God speaking that who is it
[41:26] for and then comes a sear a prophet seer
[41:31] in the end time and shows a sign of the
[41:34] resurrection and says now is the time
[41:38] this is the season my friends whether I
[41:42] see it or not you want to believe that
[41:45] with all your heart to believe it is to
[41:47] receive it to believe it is to be the
[41:49] recipient to doubt it is death to doubt
[41:52] it you'll still go to church to doubt it
[41:54] you may still speak in tongues to doubt
[41:56] it you still play in a Orchestra to
[41:58] doubt it you can still sing songs that
[42:01] has nothing to do with it you'll miss it
[42:05] but that word is infused
[42:08] pregnated with the Rapture
[42:11] life and it in itself already is
[42:19] Anointed you know just little thoughts
[42:22] along the
[42:25] side in the Bible
[42:28] God told them anoint the altar anoint it
[42:32] with oil and they
[42:34] did and had and because I can say the
[42:39] Earth to
[42:40] me couldn't find where brother brandham
[42:43] said it but in my
[42:45] studies the earth to me was like God's
[42:49] altar because here on the
[42:52] earth doesn't say he poured out his
[42:54] Spirit on the Sun or poured out out a
[42:57] spirit on the moon or poured out a
[43:00] spirit on Pluto or Jupiter or Saturn or
[43:05] other galaxies we have no record but his
[43:08] Spirit
[43:10] moved over the face of the Earth
[43:13] Hallelujah moved and the prophet said he
[43:17] CED he brooded he CED in love and he
[43:20] brooded upon the face of the Earth why
[43:23] because he loved the water no because
[43:25] what was in the Earth
[43:27] you were laying there Hallelujah you
[43:30] were laying
[43:32] there do you believe
[43:35] that and there's many that are asleep in
[43:37] the earth and the same holy spirit is
[43:40] cooing over this Earth waiting on that
[43:42] promise I'm going to bring them
[43:45] forth Hallelujah I'm going to bring them
[43:48] forth we shall not all sleep but those
[43:52] that are asleep in Christ shall be first
[43:55] raised
[43:57] will first be raised do you know anybody
[43:59] that's going to be raised are you
[44:01] looking for somebody that's going to be
[44:02] raised they'll first be raised
[44:05] Hallelujah and then we which are alive
[44:08] and remain here's the seed here's the
[44:10] seed shall be
[44:12] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[44:16] eye is that your
[44:21] promise that was in seed form and now
[44:24] we're in the manifestation part of it
[44:26] and we received the sign received the
[44:28] prophet
[44:29] Seer who the Breath of God could come
[44:36] through that is
[44:39] why that Ministry is so
[44:42] different and you know the
[44:44] altar also had to be sprinkled with
[44:48] blood and this
[44:50] Earth as God's
[44:52] altar was sprinkled with
[44:54] blood his own blood
[44:58] says I'll make it a new blood I'll
[45:01] create blood
[45:04] again and it'll be
[45:06] sprinkled spattered on the earth I'll
[45:10] claim that little speck of dust out in
[45:14] its
[45:15] orbit friends this would just be
[45:20] some
[45:21] star and even scientists that try to
[45:25] understand try to understand this Earth
[45:28] they try to understand these things try
[45:30] to understand our place in the universe
[45:34] and in the in the tens of billions
[45:37] billions of
[45:39] galaxies if you go into it you just get
[45:44] lost if you go into it as a Believer
[45:47] you're bound to
[45:49] say God How Great Thou
[45:53] Art you're bound to
[45:55] say how did you you ever find
[45:59] me how are you aware of me that God
[46:03] should think of me that God should be
[46:06] concerned that I'm a
[46:08] sinner that God should be concerned
[46:11] about my need that God should be
[46:14] concerned I have a pain I have a
[46:16] sickness I have a disease that God
[46:18] should be so concerned I'll come
[46:21] down I'll condescend down and I'll make
[46:25] a way where you can be free of your
[46:28] guilt free of your sin free of your
[46:31] disease free of oh the grace that
[46:33] brought it down to
[46:37] man tell you what friends if I shut this
[46:39] service down right now and you didn't
[46:41] praise him I'd say you'd be nigh unto a
[46:46] sinner how can a how can a redeemed one
[46:50] hold their
[46:52] peace how can you fully understand what
[46:55] he did and be at peace and be silent no
[46:59] God now has put something in the people
[47:02] God desires worship and we're here to
[47:04] worship
[47:07] Him
[47:17] Hallelujah the concept or the
[47:20] understanding of the
[47:21] anointing even before the beginning and
[47:24] that's where I've brought you from in I
[47:27] tried to bring you
[47:30] along and
[47:35] then I want to just give you
[47:39] uh another thought if you could for a
[47:41] moment follow with
[47:44] me you see Jesus saying I proceeded
[47:48] forth from
[47:52] God I would like you to see him as the
[47:56] branch
[47:57] coming forth from the
[48:00] stock and the Bible says of
[48:05] him Isaiah speaking he said and there
[48:08] shall come forth A
[48:10] Rod or the rod the word in the Hebrews
[48:13] actually a branch there shall come forth
[48:15] a branch or another meaning is a
[48:18] twig out of the
[48:21] stem which is the
[48:24] trunk or the stock of J
[48:28] and a branch shall grow out of his
[48:31] roots Jesus was
[48:34] like in his coming here is like a a
[48:37] branch of Jesse a twig coming forth and
[48:42] then Jesus would
[48:44] say I am the True
[48:47] Vine my father's the
[48:51] husbandman and if there's a True
[48:54] Vine something that is is is very unique
[48:57] in brother Brand's Ministry and I I'm
[48:59] just giving this to you I'm sewing this
[49:01] thought because you've run into it many
[49:02] many times and it has a great deal of
[49:05] meaning to me because I was when I was
[49:09] with brother brandom I was really
[49:12] quite I was distressed I guess would be
[49:15] the right word at all the anointed
[49:18] things that I saw took place and I made
[49:20] reference to them before I heard
[49:23] prophecies that were not accurate did
[49:26] not happen happened and they were
[49:28] anointed and I couldn't understand it
[49:30] and great
[49:32] manifestations saw Miracles and other
[49:36] things I saw three deaf and dumb persons
[49:40] in a man's meeting in a small handful of
[49:43] people compared to brother bram's
[49:45] meetings or or Roberts's meetings or
[49:47] Tommy Hicks or Tommy osbor or any of
[49:50] these other men we always think of the
[49:52] big tents and the big big auditoriums
[49:54] but this was out in the field out in the
[49:57] open and over a period I think of two or
[50:00] three days in two small towns both in
[50:02] British Columbia I saw three deaf and
[50:06] dumb persons prayed for by a man I still
[50:10] remember his name I won't name it just
[50:11] now and he was from California a
[50:13] preacher only saw him then never saw him
[50:16] again he he took control of that demon
[50:21] and cast that deaf and dumb Spirit out
[50:24] and had that person hear and speak right
[50:26] there at the
[50:29] platform and I was about 15 I never
[50:33] forgot that
[50:35] anointed absolutely and was that from
[50:38] God absolutely is from
[50:41] God and I wouldn't ident I wouldn't I'm
[50:43] not making any reference to this brother
[50:45] I believe he's a very Godly Man very
[50:47] fine man but with all even today you
[50:51] think anointed singing we hear anointed
[50:53] singing and anointed preaching and
[50:56] anointed because Jesus said in the last
[50:59] days in the last days it would be so
[51:02] close so as to deceive the very elect if
[51:06] possible it was so it's going to be so
[51:09] close and you won't find it anywhere
[51:11] else you just don't find it but now
[51:14] brother Brandon brings false anointed
[51:15] ones and that has such a significant
[51:18] place in my life in my experience
[51:20] because I sat there on that
[51:23] log and had him when I raised the
[51:26] question and he said have you heard my
[51:29] tape or my message on false anointed
[51:32] ones and I felt bad and I felt somewhat
[51:35] embarrassed that I had not heard it I
[51:38] had heard a few tapes but not
[51:40] many and
[51:42] uh so I said no I haven't heard it so
[51:46] then he went into the
[51:48] scriptures and in the scriptures one of
[51:50] the scriptures was in the last days
[51:52] sayth God I will pour
[51:57] out what is it pouring out it's like an
[52:00] anointing I will pour out my spirit upon
[52:04] all and brother Brandon when he came to
[52:06] that he said I'll pour out my spirit
[52:08] upon and I said all I answered because
[52:11] he waiting for the answer I said all and
[52:14] he said a l l flesh but not all flesh is
[52:18] saved I said that is correct he said the
[52:22] wheat and the tears you remember the
[52:24] parable yes I said he said you tell me
[52:29] what the wheat what caused the wheat to
[52:32] grow what caused the wheat to Rejoice
[52:35] what caused what gave the wheat strength
[52:38] and I'll tell you what the tears
[52:40] rejoiced in because they both had the
[52:42] same source and he went through two more
[52:44] scriptures and then I tell you what
[52:47] friends it was like an explosion took
[52:50] place and I also said to myself I said
[52:53] to myself I felt very very uh humbled
[52:57] because I said to myself you have read
[53:00] those scriptures hundreds of times why
[53:02] haven't we why haven't I seen that
[53:04] before and then I realized that the word
[53:08] coming in its season out of the right
[53:10] mouth had a different had a whole
[53:13] different power to it and it was the
[53:15] same scripture it just took on a whole
[53:18] new scope a whole new meaning and then
[53:22] when you get into false anointed ones
[53:23] you'll find in several places he'll say
[53:26] now he was to this brother's place and
[53:29] there's a a citrus tree an orange tree
[53:34] and in there is growing
[53:36] lemons and grapefruit and tangelos and
[53:41] several other fruits but they're all
[53:43] citrus and the branches are all growing
[53:46] out of this orange tree and brother
[53:48] brandham says well how is that how can
[53:52] they all be manifesting these other
[53:54] things
[53:57] and he says well because that's what
[53:59] they are that's the branch they are oh
[54:01] he says so now next
[54:03] year next year these will all grow
[54:07] oranges he said oh
[54:09] no no the lemon Branch will bring a
[54:12] lemon and the tangelo will bring a
[54:14] tangelo and the grapefruit will bring it
[54:17] even next year yes it'll keep on
[54:19] bringing that but it's drawing life from
[54:22] the vine it's drawing life from the tree
[54:26] and now this whole series of messages
[54:28] has actually erupted from this next
[54:30] phrase which he makes and whether it is
[54:33] that service whether it is Anointed ones
[54:35] false anointed ones but he he makes this
[54:39] statement they have the life like that
[54:42] but then his statement is but they're
[54:44] bearing false witness to the
[54:51] tree and that's why I
[54:54] said the anointing that came out from
[54:56] God the purpose of that is to bring a
[55:00] true
[55:02] evidence to the
[55:04] tree Hallelujah so when Jesus came he
[55:08] could sign the True Vine because he was
[55:11] bringing forth a true
[55:14] evidence the anointing he said the
[55:16] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[55:19] hath anointed me he was anointed not
[55:21] only to bring evidence but to bring a
[55:24] true evidence of the the original stock
[55:28] and my brother my sister you're ordained
[55:30] you are ordained by God God's purpose to
[55:34] bring this message is to let it come
[55:36] into your heart and to anoint it by the
[55:39] holy spirit so that you will bring a
[55:41] true
[55:42] evidence a true evidence you're anointed
[55:45] to bring forth a true evidence of the
[55:49] original
[55:51] vine Hallelujah that's why he sent this
[55:55] word we're not just here to be another
[55:57] church we're not just here to be
[55:59] identified as as a some kind of a group
[56:02] of people we have been ordained by God
[56:06] we're not here to bring forth a Baptist
[56:08] Branch a Pentecostal Branch a Catholic
[56:12] Branch they may all get their life from
[56:15] that vine but there are those that come
[56:18] from an original twig an original branch
[56:22] and that original Branch will always
[56:24] bring forth oranges it'll bring forth
[56:27] the original
[56:28] life how many believe
[56:32] that and that branch that life has been
[56:35] ordained for the Rapture because I came
[56:38] from God and I returned back to
[56:42] God youve got to believe
[56:46] that you believe
[56:51] that Hallelujah
[56:56] there shall come forth a
[56:58] branch
[57:00] Hallelujah that's why Jesus could go on
[57:03] and
[57:05] say Jesus coming forth who was the word
[57:09] himself proceeded out from God he was
[57:13] the Breath of God
[57:16] hallelujah he was not a prophet of God
[57:20] he was the god Prophet prophets of God
[57:24] were instruments through which the
[57:26] Breath of God could come but Jesus
[57:29] Christ was the word he was the very
[57:32] Breath of God in him was life Hallelujah
[57:37] and that life was the light of
[57:40] man but other prophets came and they
[57:43] were instruments through which the
[57:45] Breath of God came was breathed through
[57:50] and then that's why brother Brandon
[57:52] makes a distinction he says now he he
[57:56] said when you hear that thus sayith the
[57:59] lord it's not me
[58:02] speaking that's a different
[58:06] breath Hallelujah you follow
[58:12] me you know just to make it
[58:19] clear Jesus did not say some things for
[58:23] example that brother brandham said
[58:25] brother brandom could say oh I've just
[58:28] made so many
[58:29] mistakes there's a man I've made so many
[58:33] you never hear Jesus saying I've made so
[58:35] many mistakes brother Bram said I was a
[58:38] sinner I repented of my sins you never
[58:41] hear Jesus say
[58:43] that Jesus said my blood is drink indeed
[58:48] and my flesh is meat indeed brother
[58:49] Brandon couldn't say
[58:51] that you understand one was the glos
[58:55] himself and the other was a vessel of
[58:57] the
[58:58] logos it's important to understand that
[59:01] because people go on both sides then
[59:03] some people use those maybe statements
[59:05] similar to mine and say well there was a
[59:07] difference and you only you only pay
[59:09] attention to what brother bandam said
[59:11] when he said thus sayi the Lord I don't
[59:13] accept that I don't accept that
[59:21] either I probably should you know people
[59:23] have used that ministers have used that
[59:25] sadly because they wanted to go toodling
[59:27] off on their own Direction they had
[59:30] their own Revelation and they end off
[59:32] way off in some Wilderness and the sad
[59:34] part is I wouldn't mind if they want to
[59:35] go writing off there but they take a
[59:38] whole group of people with them and it's
[59:39] really sad saying well you know the try
[59:41] to indicate in fur that the message is
[59:43] unreliable the message isn't unreliable
[59:46] friends it's an absolute to us it is the
[59:48] revelation of God's word to us but it'll
[59:51] always harmonize with the word always
[59:54] harmonize with the word
[59:58] and so my desire for the congregation
[1:00:01] here my desire for this
[1:00:03] congregation is that we will bear and
[1:00:06] I've been I've been praying for you I
[1:00:08] hope you've been praying for me praying
[1:00:10] for you as a congregation appreciating
[1:00:13] you as a
[1:00:15] congregation and the message I've just
[1:00:17] been listening to testimony of a true
[1:00:20] witness brother Bram has just lost his
[1:00:23] mother and I was with him just before
[1:00:25] that and he had the vision of the hunt
[1:00:27] and everything and then he explained to
[1:00:29] the people in another service right
[1:00:32] after his mother departed that God gave
[1:00:34] him that hunt to comfort him in what he
[1:00:38] was going to be facing but when he comes
[1:00:40] in November of 61 I believe it is he
[1:00:43] comes and he's just lost his mother and
[1:00:45] that is he spent so much of the service
[1:00:48] on how how what he thought of his mother
[1:00:51] and what his mother meant to him and how
[1:00:53] she was just such a he goes back back
[1:00:56] into her conversations that he had with
[1:00:58] her and then he began to thank the
[1:01:01] people you know he I you can just see he
[1:01:04] becomes so Melancholy and he becomes so
[1:01:07] expressive to the people it's like he's
[1:01:09] talking to them one on one and tells
[1:01:11] them how much he loved them and and
[1:01:14] thank you for coming and sitting with
[1:01:16] mother and thank you for being there
[1:01:18] with me and being there for our time of
[1:01:21] grief and he goes on and on and on it
[1:01:24] takes a long time in the service
[1:01:26] but he's preaching on a testimony of a
[1:01:28] true
[1:01:30] witness and I'd like to say to you I
[1:01:34] just pray my prayer to God for this
[1:01:37] congregation is we don't have another
[1:01:40] church to be our
[1:01:42] example we don't have any other place to
[1:01:44] be our example our example must be a
[1:01:47] word message-based
[1:01:49] example and live by that and I say oh
[1:01:54] God I wouldn't want to lab laed all this
[1:01:56] 34 35 years and then and then end up
[1:02:01] with a say a group of people or a church
[1:02:04] not worried about you so much as worried
[1:02:06] about you know the influence that the
[1:02:09] world has and the influence of our jobs
[1:02:11] and the influence just of of the whole
[1:02:14] civilization that we're we're we're
[1:02:16] forced to live in the influence of your
[1:02:19] schools young people the influence of
[1:02:21] your friends the influence of the
[1:02:23] fashion industry the influence of the
[1:02:26] sports the influence that is so
[1:02:29] infiltrates every part of our life you
[1:02:32] can't even hardly move or turn around
[1:02:35] before you can feel that impact of that
[1:02:37] influence your neighbors and your work
[1:02:39] people that you work with and all over I
[1:02:42] pray that God will by his divine grace
[1:02:46] allow you my precious brothers and
[1:02:49] sisters my precious young people that we
[1:02:52] will when all is said and done and you
[1:02:56] surely will stand also before him that
[1:03:00] you will hear his voice well done you
[1:03:04] have borne you did Bear a true
[1:03:09] evidence of the tree of
[1:03:12] life you bore a true evidence you were
[1:03:15] not a false witness to this tree you
[1:03:18] were a true witness to this
[1:03:24] tree amen
[1:03:42] amen the Bible says then said Jesus to
[1:03:46] them
[1:03:47] again peace be unto
[1:03:51] you as I would like to say exactly as PR
[1:03:55] precisely as the
[1:03:58] father hath sent me I've proceeded out
[1:04:02] from God I've come out of the booom of
[1:04:06] God as he came out so have you come
[1:04:12] out I want to take you back not just in
[1:04:15] some mental picture but in
[1:04:19] reality long before your great
[1:04:23] grandfathers and mothers and your
[1:04:25] lineage way way back to the many many
[1:04:28] countries that are represented here long
[1:04:31] before that listen to me you young
[1:04:34] people especially sitting here with your
[1:04:36] mother and dad God bless them how we
[1:04:39] thank God for Godly Parents but long
[1:04:42] before that if you could only see if you
[1:04:45] could only recognize
[1:04:49] it you're believing the words of your
[1:04:51] lord Jesus as I
[1:04:56] came from
[1:04:57] God as I've been sent even sent with a
[1:05:03] purpose somebody I was just talking
[1:05:11] to in this
[1:05:14] congregation don't see them but they're
[1:05:16] probably sitting here listening to
[1:05:18] me I don't
[1:05:20] have permission to say this but I'm
[1:05:22] going to say it been on my heart very
[1:05:24] very much
[1:05:28] I've been aware for some
[1:05:30] months God dealing with a man in this
[1:05:34] congregation very very
[1:05:36] deeply when he's out on
[1:05:39] relaxation he's carrying his a
[1:05:43] Bible and I met him on occasion when he
[1:05:45] was on a relaxation on vacation he was
[1:05:48] carrying his Bible had his
[1:05:50] Bible in the
[1:05:52] vehicle and he starts to tell me about
[1:05:55] how God is speaking to him out of his
[1:05:57] out of the scriptures and he's weeping
[1:05:59] he can't hold himself together and he's
[1:06:02] weeping I and I see now months have gone
[1:06:05] by and I've Just Seen A Change
[1:06:09] transformation in this
[1:06:17] man I had a conversation with him this
[1:06:19] last
[1:06:23] week maybe two weeks ago
[1:06:27] and he was driven to
[1:06:30] prayer he said my house is
[1:06:33] busy children in the
[1:06:36] house but he said I found a
[1:06:39] place under the
[1:06:41] stairs and I've made a
[1:06:44] room where I can be
[1:06:46] alone with
[1:06:50] God on another occasion this isn't
[1:06:53] flashing the pan do not come up to the
[1:06:54] front and be prayed for and walk away
[1:06:56] and forget all about
[1:06:59] it another
[1:07:02] occasion I'm being waked up early in the
[1:07:05] morning and I felt even sometimes in the
[1:07:08] night I just need to get out and pray
[1:07:11] and I start praying he said I think I'll
[1:07:12] only pray for maybe a short time before
[1:07:15] I know it it's
[1:07:18] daylight and he has to work and he has
[1:07:20] to work
[1:07:21] hard it's going week in week out week
[1:07:25] week in week
[1:07:29] out not long
[1:07:31] ago in the last few
[1:07:34] weeks he's not preaching to his wife
[1:07:36] he's not trying to bring anything down
[1:07:39] bring her into
[1:07:41] subjection he just
[1:07:43] concerned told me yesterday all I want
[1:07:45] to talk about I just want to I want to
[1:07:49] be with you he said I just want to talk
[1:07:50] about the Lord I just want everything
[1:07:53] you can tell me about God
[1:07:56] and his wife is in the house and has
[1:07:58] some kind of experience and God comes
[1:08:01] upon her and speaks to her and says to
[1:08:04] her Jesus Christ is in your
[1:08:12] husband I said what is happening to you
[1:08:16] there's a purpose in that now you
[1:08:20] must
[1:08:21] scan as it were to know the mind of God
[1:08:26] what are you doing this for and what is
[1:08:28] the purpose I said there's someone else
[1:08:30] perhaps in the congregation here to have
[1:08:32] an effect on and I said what I'm praying
[1:08:35] I'm praying oh God let that be the
[1:08:39] experience not of one but of
[1:08:42] others I feel like God is doing
[1:08:45] something I've had you speak I've had
[1:08:47] you email I've had phone calls and I
[1:08:51] myself know the word is different I know
[1:08:53] that God is doing something different
[1:08:55] I'm hearing the other brothers Minister
[1:08:58] and God is dealing with our
[1:09:00] congregation if I was to go off the
[1:09:03] scene today I'd want you to remember God
[1:09:05] is dealing with this congregation in a
[1:09:07] different
[1:09:11] way you believe that you feel it don't
[1:09:15] you you sense it it's something deep
[1:09:18] within you know I believe it
[1:09:20] is I believe it's a Rapture
[1:09:24] word I I believe it's the anointed word
[1:09:26] for
[1:09:27] Rapture I believe that what God is doing
[1:09:30] is getting a people ready to leave it's
[1:09:33] not just a song it's not just a song
[1:09:36] getting ready to
[1:09:37] leave but it's something that's taking
[1:09:40] place that has to do
[1:09:42] so our examples aren't out in the world
[1:09:44] it's not in the street it's not in the
[1:09:46] mall it's not where we work it's not in
[1:09:49] the school it's not in the college our
[1:09:51] example is in the word and the word has
[1:09:54] called us to such a depth in him and I
[1:09:57] believe that that word which came was
[1:10:01] breathed out of God created the creation
[1:10:04] of this earth when our bodies were still
[1:10:06] in the soil and sent his word down
[1:10:09] through his vessels through his Prophets
[1:10:12] The Breath of God to the people in seed
[1:10:16] form then it came to its manifested form
[1:10:20] and God sent a messenger in the end time
[1:10:24] Prophet m messenger through whom he
[1:10:27] could transmit the very Breath of God so
[1:10:32] Jesus could say as I have been sent as I
[1:10:38] have been sent of the father so send I
[1:10:44] you does the congregation understand
[1:10:47] what's in my spirit and soul
[1:10:49] today you have been sent by God you
[1:10:52] don't look back at just where you came
[1:10:54] from or your Heritage here on Earth
[1:10:56] you've issued out from the bosom of God
[1:11:00] and God knew you were going to be here
[1:11:03] knew you were going to sit here in this
[1:11:05] meeting knew you were going to hear this
[1:11:06] thinging you came from God to be an
[1:11:09] expression of God on the earth and to
[1:11:11] Bear a true
[1:11:13] witness of the vine
[1:11:20] Hallelujah do you agree with that
[1:11:28] Hallelujah that's what we're here
[1:11:32] for it's an incredible time that we're
[1:11:34] living in
[1:11:36] friends and I pray that the spirit of
[1:11:39] God just keeps urging us on further that
[1:11:42] tomorrow will not be as yesterday and
[1:11:45] next week won't be like this
[1:11:47] week and that you will be used of God to
[1:11:51] have such an effect and such an
[1:11:54] influence
[1:11:56] hallelujah how far can we go who knows
[1:11:58] there is no
[1:12:01] limits we're birthed by God some here no
[1:12:06] doubt do not have that baptism I'm not
[1:12:10] speaking about the gift now I'm talking
[1:12:13] about the person himself coming into the
[1:12:17] individual and it's not something we you
[1:12:20] know it's not something that we
[1:12:21] determine within ourselves but there's
[1:12:24] one thing that we can do and that is you
[1:12:26] can create an atmosphere you can allow
[1:12:29] God to give a hunger in your heart down
[1:12:33] into your soul a craving if you haven't
[1:12:36] got it you can that's one thing you can
[1:12:39] do you have a voice you have something
[1:12:42] that can express your heart do you have
[1:12:44] a real desire for God then if I were you
[1:12:47] I would tell him so I say I have such a
[1:12:50] thirst for you such a hunger for you I
[1:12:52] will put my mind and my thoughts I will
[1:12:55] focus upon you I'll keep thinking about
[1:12:58] you I'll keep thinking about the promise
[1:13:00] of this time I won't let it get far from
[1:13:03] me
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:12] Hallelujah I'm going to close
[1:13:15] early I want to close in this atmosphere
[1:13:26] so I look across the
[1:13:28] congregation and now when I make my next
[1:13:31] statement make the next few
[1:13:33] comments I do not want you to think of
[1:13:36] you know perhaps the little difficulties
[1:13:39] that you have we all have difficulties
[1:13:41] we all have
[1:13:43] those we have financial difficulties we
[1:13:46] have you know just life life is a can be
[1:13:50] Troublesome we all have
[1:13:52] that but I begin to ask myself this last
[1:13:55] week what is the anointing
[1:13:59] for what is this I can see I can see it
[1:14:02] all happen I hope I've been I've hope
[1:14:04] I've been able to dramatize it a we bit
[1:14:06] do you believe it you believe it you
[1:14:09] believe it come out of the bosom of God
[1:14:11] here come you know brother br's trying
[1:14:13] to describe it to Here Comes This Little
[1:14:15] Light it's the logos out of this great
[1:14:17] being that is so completely under
[1:14:20] Indescribable cannot be understood Here
[1:14:22] Comes This Little Light
[1:14:25] and it comes transferring out of the
[1:14:27] bosom of
[1:14:29] God let there be
[1:14:31] light brother Bram said if there was a
[1:14:33] Mist that came it wasn't the word of God
[1:14:36] let the Earth bring forth let the waters
[1:14:39] bring
[1:14:40] forth all the living kind and Animal
[1:14:44] Kingdom let us make man in our image now
[1:14:49] he begin he's transferring himself now
[1:14:52] he's got one that looks like him just
[1:14:55] like him my son you'll be the god of the
[1:14:59] earth then the fall and the sin and the
[1:15:03] death and the Earth that he made has
[1:15:05] been bathed in
[1:15:08] blood
[1:15:10] cruel blood but the scripture says the
[1:15:14] righteous blood of Abel the blood of
[1:15:18] Jesus speaks better things than that and
[1:15:20] then God now out of his bosom he's got
[1:15:24] to bring the redemp
[1:15:25] plan he going to redeem this back I
[1:15:28] cannot lose it I cannot be God and lose
[1:15:31] this and he's going to bring the
[1:15:33] Redemptive plan and that's that very
[1:15:36] lust that went out from him sets in
[1:15:39] motion the Redemption and now he begins
[1:15:42] to act it out and play it out and he
[1:15:44] brings his Masterpiece Christ Christ
[1:15:48] himself was the logos just here for a
[1:15:50] little brief moment of time and he
[1:15:52] leaves and his Spirit comes into a 120
[1:15:56] and they're birthed they're different
[1:15:58] kind of people they're God people there
[1:16:02] never been people like this on the earth
[1:16:04] they're even different from the prophets
[1:16:06] the prophet had the word going through
[1:16:08] them but now these were
[1:16:10] born born born by
[1:16:15] God they were birthed by God and Jesus
[1:16:20] because God himself breathed when the
[1:16:23] creation was finished finished God
[1:16:26] breathed into Adam and he became a
[1:16:29] living soul and when the new creation
[1:16:31] was
[1:16:32] finished Jesus breathed on the disciples
[1:16:36] receive ye the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost showing that he was the beginning
[1:16:42] of the new creation but in him it was
[1:16:45] completed it was done and he breathed on
[1:16:48] them receive ye the Holy Ghost and now
[1:16:51] these 120 and now God begin to live in a
[1:16:56] people bringing and claiming back all
[1:17:00] that was his from the very beginning and
[1:17:04] so that breath that was breathed into
[1:17:08] US I've received that
[1:17:11] breath you have received that breath if
[1:17:14] you haven't here if you're not if you
[1:17:17] have not received that breath set
[1:17:20] yourself aside say I I I need to receive
[1:17:24] that very very Breath of
[1:17:30] God a newborn creature in Christ
[1:17:35] Jesus that's what it's about and friends
[1:17:38] I'll tell you I can go back in my
[1:17:41] life and this person I was speaking to

[1:18:14] of
[1:18:16] weaknesses and
[1:18:22] yet you know because I don't know
[1:18:24] whether it's because the ministry what
[1:18:25] it
[1:18:26] is but my wife and I have

[1:18:46] spirit of God you got the very Source
