[7:10] &gt;&gt; Loosening the bound, Father.

[10:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name.
[10:51] Hallelujah. We're going to ask brother
[10:53] Tom to come and pray just after we sing
[10:55] this chorus. Sister Lorie Snow has
[10:58] several requests that she'd like to make
[11:00] mention before the congregation. Ask you
[11:02] to pray earnestly that her mom was
[11:05] admitted to the hospital with heart
[11:06] problems. Her brother Ed is undergoing
[11:08] surgery this week for a valve in his
[11:11] heart. Wants to ask for unspoken request
[11:14] for her sister and her family.
[11:20] We have two testimonies. One from
[11:21] brother Steve Rivas thanking the saints
[11:24] for their prayers and thanking the Lord
[11:26] for providing a job for his he and his
[11:28] family. He starts on Monday.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[11:35] Hallelujah.
[11:38] Amen. Many people take a job for granted
[11:42] until you have to pray for a job.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Then you don't take it for granted. You
[11:46] write in a testimony when God answers
[11:48] your prayer and provides something for
[11:49] you. Amen. Sister Lori wants to thank
[11:53] you all for praying and thank the Lord
[11:55] for keeping his hand on her daughter
[11:57] Christine and herself.
[12:00] It's the preaching of the word, the
[12:02] ministry that enables us to ride through
[12:05] every storm. Amen. My brother Tom come
[12:08] in just a moment. Let's sing this chorus
[12:10] together. feel it's an anthem for myself
[12:13] even coming from camp when brother Cadre
[12:15] was here winter camp. Lord, I lift your
[12:19] name.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift
[12:26] your
[12:28] [Music]
[12:31] holy
[12:34] name.
[12:38] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[12:41] [Music]
[12:48] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[12:54] [Music]
[13:01] My Oh,
[13:05] [Music]
[13:13] I
[13:16] [Music]
[13:23] [Music]
[13:31] Oh,
[13:42] heat,
[13:48] heat.
[13:51] [Music]
[13:54] Yeah.
[13:58] Heat.
[14:05] [Music]
[14:08] Heat. Heat.
[14:11] [Music]
[14:18] might
[14:21] [Music]
[14:32] [Applause]
[14:32] [Music]
[14:35] and my love
[14:38] for
[14:42] me.
[14:44] Before we sing it one more time and go
[14:46] to prayer, there's a request also.
[14:49] Brother Louise has given us a prayer
[14:51] request for a pastor Alfredo. How do you
[14:55] say last name? Builtus.
[14:58] And Buenes has asked
[15:01] us to pray for them. They gave him a
[15:05] printer, a hub printer in Argentina.
[15:07] Brother Alfredo told me they broke into
[15:10] his church, took everything, music
[15:11] instruments, sound equipment,
[15:13] everything. They were preparing a
[15:15] portion of the church for the hub and by
[15:17] the grace of God, the printer was still
[15:19] in his house. He's determined to print
[15:22] the message as soon as they can pray for
[15:24] the situation.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; We can do that, can't we?
[15:27] &gt;&gt; And I believe there's other situations
[15:29] here in the house of God. We are a needy
[15:32] people.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Needy of the presence of God.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; We never want to get to the place of
[15:37] Revelation 3
[15:39] &gt;&gt; where they felt there is no need.
[15:42] I have a need this morning.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; I put on a tape early this morning,
[15:46] started to listen to that prophet and
[15:48] started to see how far I've fallen
[15:51] short, but I just want the grace of God.
[15:54] I want his grace this morning. We want
[15:56] the presence of God to come in the word
[15:58] to meet our needs. Let's just sing the
[16:01] chorus. We'll go to prayer.
[16:04] Lord, I live.
[16:09] Hallelujah.
[16:10] [Music]
[16:11] and your holy
[16:15] name.
[16:16] [Music]
[16:24] Hallelujah.
[16:25] Hallelujah.
[16:28] For the great
[16:32] I am
[16:36] the reason
[16:40] [Music]
[16:42] I come.
[16:44] [Music]
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[16:52] [Music]
[16:57] I'm sure, Father, if we would ask this
[16:59] morning from the depths of our heart.
[17:04] Do I have a need?
[17:08] I'm sure without reservation, there
[17:10] would be 100% of us just lifting up our
[17:13] hands
[17:15] saying, "Oh, great provider,
[17:18] &gt;&gt; meet my need this morning."
[17:21] and we believe you are the risen lamb.
[17:25] You are the mighty God and you're more
[17:28] than able to meet all needs.
[17:31] Brother Louise has penned down this
[17:34] request that we would pray for the
[17:35] saints in Argentina.
[17:39] We know the enemy is a robber.
[17:42] He's a thief and he's a destroyer.
[17:46] But Lord, I love the following statement
[17:48] that you said. But I am come to give you
[17:52] life and life more abundantly.
[17:56] And so Lord God, we believe that you
[17:58] will meet their needs according to your
[18:00] word, that you will give them life,
[18:02] Lord, that you will take the situation
[18:04] and that Father, you will turn it around
[18:06] for the glory of God. And so, Lord
[18:09] Jesus, with our hands lifted up and our
[18:13] hearts open, we're asking, Lord, that
[18:16] this resurrected King would come by and
[18:19] suck with us in a supernatural way by
[18:22] the word of God.
[18:26] That we could say, "Come to my soul,
[18:29] &gt;&gt; precious Jesus.
[18:32] Meet my heart's cry and meet my need."
[18:37] And so, Lord, as we have oneness of
[18:38] heart and mind this morning, knowing
[18:41] that there's many away, Lord, on their
[18:43] vacation, and some have already returned
[18:46] home, but we're thankful that we have
[18:48] the presence of God that goes before us,
[18:51] that never failing presence of Jesus
[18:53] Christ. So, Lord, would you anoint the
[18:56] man of God this morning?
[18:59] Would you anoint the gift?
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Would you anoint our ears?
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Would you anoint our eyes? And may we
[19:06] see your glory go by as your prophet
[19:08] said, Lord, that you hid Moses that day.
[19:11] And when he saw the backside of God, he
[19:13] saw a bleeding black. Lord, may we see
[19:16] the bleeding word bleed for us this
[19:18] morning. Meet our needs. And Lord, we
[19:21] have children that need an experience
[19:23] with God. May we reach out into faith
[19:26] and say, "God, save our children. Fill
[19:29] us with the Holy Ghost. Let the word of
[19:31] God permeate
[19:33] our hearts and lives this morning. Meet
[19:37] those that have joined with us on the
[19:39] internet. Speak to their hearts and meet
[19:42] their needs. And Father, we'll be sure
[19:44] to give you all the glory and honor and
[19:46] praise. And father, would you anoint now
[19:49] the remainder of the service, the songs
[19:52] and the worship and be glorified now as
[19:55] we commit all the prayer requests and
[19:57] all the needs to you in Jesus name.
[20:01] Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn next person next to
[20:07] you shake their hands say God bless you
[20:08] this morning. It's wonderful to be in
[20:11] the house of the Lord this morning.
[20:15] Amen. that you may have your seats.
[20:18] For those that are in the visible
[20:20] audience, those that are on the
[20:21] telephone hookup and the internet, we
[20:23] want to say God bless you this morning,
[20:27] those that are
[20:29] visiting here among us, want to say God
[20:31] bless you to you as well. Amen. We just
[20:33] had a wonderful time this just last
[20:36] evening. We had several of the young
[20:38] people out at the camp. We had an
[20:40] unexpected weekend off out there. group
[20:42] moved out to September that was supposed
[20:44] to be there this weekend. So, we took
[20:47] the opportunity and invited some of the
[20:49] young people out and just had a really
[20:50] wonderful time. We appreciated those of
[20:52] you that were able to make it. We'll try
[20:54] and do that again here real soon.
[20:55] Sometimes it's short notice, but well,
[20:57] that's just the way it goes. Praise the
[21:00] Lord. Ryan's going to sing a song for us
[21:03] this morning. We appreciate Brother Ryan
[21:05] standing in the gap for us and
[21:08] appreciate the gift, Brother Ryan. God
[21:10] bless you this morning.
[21:21] [Music]
[21:30] The blood of Jesus
[21:36] atones
[21:38] for me,
[21:41] covers my sins and
[21:46] sets me free
[21:50] [Music]
[21:51] and speaks of grace that flowed
[21:55] from yonder rugged tree.

[22:06] my libert.
[22:11] Oh sacred holy flow
[22:15] from Calary's
[22:18] mouth.
[22:20] Was there their stream so pure
[22:25] or greater found?
[22:30] Where sinners holy clean
[22:34] are made within without
[22:39] and ransomed children sing
[22:44] their praise
[22:47] aloud.
[22:50] Oh thou lamb of God
[22:54] whose blood doth still atone
[22:58] whose mercies
[23:00] overflow
[23:03] to thee I see.

[23:12] shall ever
[23:14] be known
[23:17] than the preious blood that in the to

[24:29] stream
[24:31] where broken vessels are
[24:36] made whole
[24:38] and clean
[24:40] and all our sins that were
[24:45] have ceased
[24:47] to be.

[25:39] whose blood do still ate,

[25:45] overflow
[25:47] to thee I see.

[30:46] Well, I want to greet you all in the
[30:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm
[30:51] certainly glad to see each of you.
[30:55] I want to also give special greetings to
[30:57] the they're streaming in Seattle this
[31:00] morning. Brother John Andy's has been
[31:02] down and they had service Friday night
[31:04] and I think another one last night. I'm
[31:07] not too sure. And I just got a text from
[31:09] him and he was saying they're going to
[31:12] uh join together and stream and some are
[31:14] here. God bless you. All right. I'm I
[31:19] have something that's very much on my
[31:20] heart. I'm going to ask for your
[31:23] complete cooperation. I prayed that uh
[31:26] whoever was supposed to be here and
[31:28] whoever is supposed to be streaming will
[31:31] be. Uh I have had this on my heart for
[31:35] some time.
[31:37] uh and uh and and I I just need your
[31:40] cooperation so that God will be able to
[31:44] take a hold of me and allow me to say
[31:47] what I need to say and how I how I want
[31:51] to say it. It's a strange subject a wee
[31:53] bit and uh you'll notice how strange it
[31:56] is from the title when we begin. I have
[32:00] a few slides also and I don't want to
[32:02] feel uh pressed for time. So, if you'll
[32:06] just be a real reverend, and I think
[32:09] that's important. I believe God honors
[32:11] that. Uh, you have already prayed, but
[32:14] I'd like to just pray and ask God's uh
[32:18] special guidance this morning if he
[32:20] would grant us that.
[32:23] Father, how I appreciate the people that
[32:26] are here today.
[32:28] How I appreciate Lord there are your
[32:31] children those that are streaming from
[32:34] near and far. I pray oh God that you
[32:38] will bless them with the same presence.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; And may the word Lord as I have been
[32:44] praying earnestly not be in merely
[32:47] preaching and word only but in power and
[32:51] in demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[32:54] Father, it's the same gospel. You have
[32:57] restored us back to the faith of the
[33:00] fathers. Let something be said, Lord.
[33:03] Let the word uh be projected in such a
[33:06] way so that faith will rise in the in
[33:09] the hearts of the hearer. And may they
[33:12] may they take hold of it now, Lord.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Not at some time in the future, but may
[33:17] they lay hold of it at this moment for
[33:20] the very thing that they are looking to
[33:22] you for and asking you for. Lord, we
[33:25] don't want to be continually asking, but
[33:27] then we want to lay hold of it and
[33:29] receive it.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'll bless this
[33:32] congregation and bless all who are
[33:35] gathering, oh God, believers of this
[33:37] message near and far. I pray your
[33:40] blessing upon them. those that are
[33:42] streaming in Seattle, oh God, at this
[33:44] time in in Switzerland, Norway, Europe,
[33:47] Father, New Zealand, wherever they might
[33:50] be, I pray your blessing upon the dear
[33:52] ones.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And anoint us now, oh God, to speak and
[33:57] the hearers to hear in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] Uh if you'll turn in your Bibles to
[34:06] Isaiah the 53rd chapter. It was also
[34:08] from this reading
[34:11] that we spoke
[34:14] I think two weeks ago
[34:17] and I had a considerable
[34:20] uh response from different ones and when
[34:24] uh we took the value of the flaw.
[34:28] You remember that?
[34:30] &gt;&gt; All right. This service today will tie
[34:32] directly into that.
[34:37] I'm going to begin to read in the 52nd
[34:39] chapter verse 13
[34:43] and then on down into 53
[34:46] 1-5.
[34:49] Behold, my servant shall deal prudently.
[34:53] He shall be exalted and extolled and be
[34:57] very high.
[34:59] As many were astonied at thee, his
[35:03] visage was marred more than any man, and
[35:07] his form more than the sons of men. So
[35:11] shall he sprinkle many nations, and
[35:15] kings shall shut their mouths at him.
[35:18] For that which he had been had not been
[35:21] told uh told them shall they see and
[35:26] that which they had not heard shall they
[35:28] consider.
[35:30] Who hath believed our report and to whom
[35:32] is the arm of the Lord revealed.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a
[35:38] tender plant
[35:40] &gt;&gt; and as a root out of dry ground. He hath
[35:43] no form nor clumliness.
[35:47] And when we shall see him, there is no
[35:50] beauty that we should desire him. In
[35:52] other words, Isaiah is saying that there
[35:54] is no form, there's no attraction.
[35:58] Uh, and there's no comeliness, there's
[36:01] no honor, there's nothing special about
[36:04] him that we should uh that we should
[36:09] desire him.
[36:12] And he is despised and rejected of men.
[36:15] I'd like you to notice this progression
[36:17] which I'll come to later. He is despised
[36:21] and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
[36:24] and acquainted with grief. And we hid as
[36:27] it were our faces from him. He was
[36:30] despised and we esteemed him not. Surely
[36:33] he hath borne our griefs and carried our
[36:36] sorrows.
[36:38] Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten
[36:41] of God. See, they he he said, "We we we
[36:47] considered that God brought this upon
[36:49] him as smitten of God and afflicted, but
[36:53] he was wounded for our transgressions.
[36:56] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[37:00] chastisement of our peace was upon him,
[37:04] and with his stripes
[37:06] we are healed." Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole man, body, spirit,
[37:11] and soul.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; With his stripes, we are healed. You may
[37:15] be seated.
[37:22] I spoke on the value of the flaw
[37:27] and we will
[37:30] we will remember and recall and I will
[37:32] touch on just uh certain aspects of
[37:34] that. But I would like to speak to you
[37:37] today on a very strange subject. I've
[37:39] never spoken
[37:41] like this before.
[37:43] Excuse my voice, but it'll improve as we
[37:47] go along.
[37:50] I want to speak to you on the wound
[37:52] speaks.
[37:54] The wound speaks.
[37:57] So, we had the value of a flaw. The
[37:59] flaw. We all have flaws.
[38:03] And sometimes we've wondered about
[38:06] &gt;&gt; uh things in our lives or things of our
[38:08] past and whatever more. And now I want
[38:11] to speak to you and and I believe it's a
[38:16] very profound truth that the wound
[38:18] speaks.
[38:20] Uh
[38:22] Jesus
[38:24] embraced his his suffering.
[38:27] He didn't try to rid himself of pain.
[38:31] today, whether it be physical, of
[38:33] course, billions of dollars are are
[38:36] being made
[38:38] continually on on on the pain.
[38:43] Don't don't suffer any pain. If you got
[38:45] a headache, we got something. If you got
[38:47] a throat problem, we got something. And
[38:49] they're prescribing all kinds of
[38:51] prescription drugs because pe the the
[38:53] the whole age is we got a mentality we
[38:56] mustn't suffer.
[38:58] We mustn't hurt. And even if you hurt
[39:01] mentally. They got medications and
[39:04] anti-depressants and all of these
[39:06] things. And if you're down, they put you
[39:08] up. And if you're too high, they can
[39:09] bring you down. And they can do all
[39:12] kinds of things with medications.
[39:15] So uh but Jesus he when this pain and
[39:20] this hurt and these things were
[39:22] happening he embraced his suffering
[39:26] and uh he he embraced not only the
[39:29] suffering he embraced the wound that he
[39:31] received at Calvary that brought a death
[39:35] but that death brought eternal life.
[39:38] Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Looking unto Jesus,
[39:43] who is the author
[39:45] and finisher of our faith,
[39:48] who for the joy that was set before him,
[39:51] endured the cross,
[39:54] despising the shame and is sat down at
[39:57] the right hand of the throne of God." He
[40:00] despised the shame. He he turned aside
[40:03] from it and and the everything that he
[40:07] had suffered.
[40:09] Out from his side
[40:12] came blood, water and spirit.
[40:18] The spirit which is the life for the
[40:21] bride of Jesus Christ. So just let the
[40:26] structure come as I'm I'm giving it to
[40:29] you. line upon line. Brother Brandham
[40:32] said in the message Mark of the beast,
[40:35] God opened up the side of Jesus Christ
[40:38] at Calvary and took out the bride
[40:42] out of his side. He said, "It's
[40:45] beautiful."
[40:47] &gt;&gt; So he opened up the side of Jesus at
[40:50] Calvary and took out the bride out of
[40:53] his side as he did, of course, with
[40:56] Adam.
[40:58] And it's not just a bride,
[41:01] but it's a bride with a voice.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[41:05] &gt;&gt; so the womb speaks.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say,
[41:12] "Come."
[41:14] &gt;&gt; She says something.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; And let him that heareth say, "Come."
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; And let him that is a thirst come. And
[41:23] whosoever will, let him take the water
[41:26] of life freely. Our lips should say
[41:30] that. Our actions should speak that
[41:34] &gt;&gt; because our actions, as we'll learn a
[41:36] little later on, speak louder than
[41:39] words.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; More profound than words of your
[41:44] testimony is your life.
[41:48] The bride speaks the same word as he
[41:52] does as does the spirit.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; She is a word bride proving she has the
[41:59] spirit. In every church age we hear
[42:03] these words. She proves she's the bride.
[42:07] So it's not enough to say I believe in
[42:09] the message. I believe that God sent a
[42:11] prophet in Malachi 4 and all of these
[42:13] things. That's wonderful and and that's
[42:15] only you know so much uh structure but
[42:19] the the real proof of that is that we
[42:22] live that word. We live that testimony.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; So the bride speaks the same word as
[42:30] does the spirit. She is a word bride
[42:34] proving she has the spirit. In every
[42:37] church age we hear these words.
[42:41] Jesus said in Luke, "He that heareth you
[42:44] heareth me."
[42:46] &gt;&gt; The wound speaks.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; His lips were still at Calvary, but
[42:52] Jesus continued to preach.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; He just used different instrumentality,
[42:57] but it's still Jesus Christ. I friends
[43:00] if we could just grasp and I'm trying to
[43:03] grasp it myself that God
[43:06] &gt;&gt; ordained that we would be born each one
[43:08] of us at our certain time
[43:12] and to our parents whoever they might be
[43:15] and live the life that he has caused us
[43:18] to live and meet the people and and
[43:21] finally meet him.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And to know him whom to know is life
[43:27] eternal. This was our purpose and the
[43:30] real purpose from then on is that you
[43:32] will be you will you will be a sounding
[43:35] board. You will actually speak and be
[43:38] his voice.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; It would be something if some high
[43:44] official or government or the president
[43:45] of some nation or something says you
[43:48] know entrust you with a message. There's
[43:50] maybe millions others but we entrust you
[43:52] with this message because we know that
[43:54] you will do it. We know that you won't
[43:56] fail. We'll know that. We know that
[43:58] you'll take it and carry it.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And we have been trusted and trusted
[44:03] with this message.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Not only to speak it,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; but to live it.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; He that heareth you heareth me, and he
[44:13] that despiseth you despiseth me, and he
[44:16] that despiseth me despiseth him that
[44:20] sent me.
[44:22] Now the wounding is a process and uh we
[44:28] might this might be all right here. Uh
[44:32] can you see that clearly? I I like I try
[44:35] to use quite large text fonts for the
[44:40] wounding of Jesus was a process. He's
[44:44] despised
[44:46] and rejected. See, when we read Isaiah
[44:49] 53, often we just think of Calvary.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; No, this this happened long before
[44:54] Calvary.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; He was despised in his life. He was
[44:58] rejected in his lifetime and in his
[45:00] ministry. He was a man of sorrows. He
[45:03] was acquainted with sorrows. He was
[45:05] acquainted with grief. He lived it. He
[45:08] had that all the time.
[45:11] Yet we did esteem him stricken and
[45:13] smitten of God and afflicted.
[45:17] But he was wounded for our
[45:18] transgressions.
[45:21] And this pattern
[45:23] also is also true in our lives
[45:29] in the masterpiece.
[45:31] He says uh
[45:37] okay under the influence of seeing
[45:39] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[45:43] and in his vision and desired to see it
[45:47] was completed. And when it was completed
[45:52] he was so inspired by it. Now, he's
[45:54] talking about Michelangelo and the and
[45:57] the and the statue of of Moses, but he's
[46:01] tying that directly to the great
[46:05] sculpture,
[46:06] God himself, bringing forth Jesus
[46:09] Christ. He says, "And and and and uh and
[46:14] thought his own masterpiece should speak
[46:17] back to him." And he struck it across
[46:19] the leg and hollered, "Speak!"
[46:22] and it made a flaw on it
[46:26] and put a flaw on the image.
[46:29] He said, and this is I spoke on this
[46:32] now, but I I' I've thought of it many,
[46:34] many times, and it's so contrary to what
[46:36] people normally think. And to me, the
[46:40] flaw was what made it the masterpiece.
[46:45] Maybe to the mind that might think
[46:48] different, you'd think that that spoiled
[46:51] it. No. To me, it made it what it was.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Notice notice even the the grammar,
[46:58] brother Bram. It made it what it was
[47:02] because he was wounded before the
[47:05] foundation of the world. He was the lamb
[47:07] slain before the foundation of the
[47:09] world. So when he was here and God saw
[47:13] the his perfect image and he smoked him
[47:16] at Calvary, it made it that's why the
[47:19] prophet saying that was that's what made
[47:21] it the masterpiece because it made it
[47:24] what it made him what it was.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; He always was the redeemer.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; He struck it and hollered, "Speak."
[47:36] He wouldn't have done. Now, if we just
[47:38] take it to Calvary
[47:40] and he's thrust through with a spear and
[47:44] Almighty God is saying, "Speak."
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus wasn't going to say hardly any
[47:51] more words.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, forgive them for they
[47:54] know not what they do." He said, "I
[47:56] thirst." Yes.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And even then when they tried to
[48:00] alleviate some of his pain and put
[48:03] vinegar to his mouth on a sponge, he
[48:05] turned it aside
[48:06] &gt;&gt; cuz even the last moment he wouldn't
[48:08] take anything to alleviate any of the
[48:11] pain. He was going for the joy that was
[48:13] set before him.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And that is why there's such a penalty
[48:18] on mankind to reject this kind of a
[48:21] sacrifice because he was doing it
[48:24] specifically for you and I.
[48:28] And he said speak. He said he wouldn't
[48:30] have done that if he'd have thought. He
[48:33] wouldn't have done that if he'd have
[48:35] thought. But he didn't think. It was
[48:38] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[48:41] mind. Seeing there perfect before him.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to dwell on this inspiration
[48:48] for a moment. the inspiration
[48:51] uh of making uh uh the inspiration that
[48:54] God
[48:56] because he said that all inspiration is
[48:59] of God. So God is the fountain of
[49:02] inspiration.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder can God feel? Can God have
[49:09] inspiration? Can God have certain kind
[49:11] of feelings? Of course
[49:15] we're made in his image.
[49:17] Uh uh it it's it's not as though
[49:20] everything is just static with him, you
[49:22] know. I mean, when when he saw his son
[49:26] Jesus Christ on earth and a voice of all
[49:29] of the universe, but a voice cries out
[49:32] of the heavens, this is my beloved son.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; God was pleased with what he saw.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; The inspiration
[49:44] of of making
[49:47] all things new.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; The inspiration of starting again.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; The inspiration of a new creation.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; You following my thought?
[49:58] &gt;&gt; The inspiration and I closed last the
[50:01] last time I spoke with uh you know
[50:04] someone takes and great discoveries and
[50:07] so on. People didn't write it on a piece
[50:09] of paper and get it right the first
[50:11] time. They filled, brother Brandon was
[50:14] saying, they filled basket waste baskets
[50:16] full of of of waste paper and attempts
[50:20] to get the right formula and get the
[50:22] right design and get something to work
[50:24] the way it's supposed to. They could say
[50:26] in their mind, "This has got to work."
[50:28] &gt;&gt; But they write it all out. It's not
[50:30] working. They don't just back away and
[50:33] leave it. Otherwise, they wouldn't have
[50:34] the inspiration. They're inspired.
[50:37] They're poets. They're writers. They're
[50:39] they're scientists. There are all kinds
[50:41] of gifted people, but even gifted
[50:43] people, they don't get it right the
[50:45] first time.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; And so inventors and they keep working
[50:48] at it and working at it. And and and I
[50:51] just closed, if you remember saying
[50:55] this world,
[50:57] it's a waste basket full of crumpled
[51:00] paper.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And God, that's why he says, I'm going
[51:03] to make all things new.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; And he's going to clean off this earth
[51:07] &gt;&gt; with a holy fire. Do you believe that
[51:10] he's going to clean the heavens with a
[51:13] holy fire?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, my loving brother, when the world's
[51:17] on fire, and it will be,
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I want to be in God's bosom.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Not trusting in this world.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Behold, I make all things new. And he
[51:30] said unto me, write, for these words are
[51:33] true and faithful. I thought of the
[51:35] inspiration of taking the book of
[51:38] redemption. What a great inspiration it
[51:41] must have been. How God must have been
[51:44] uh when he began to see the end drawing
[51:47] near and the conclusion of all things
[51:49] and the lamb taking the book and and the
[51:53] sealed book. There's things that have
[51:55] been sealed that God kept to himself for
[51:58] all of these uh uh eons of time, but now
[52:02] he's going to make it known. and and of
[52:04] tearing open and loosing the seals. Say,
[52:08] "Those things that I held secret, my
[52:10] children need to hear it in this age in
[52:13] order for them to be able to stand. I'm
[52:16] going to equip them."
[52:18] &gt;&gt; As brother John Andy's preached, I'll
[52:20] never leave you.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; He's not going to cease to be your
[52:24] comforter.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He's going He's He doesn't subtract. The
[52:28] Bible doesn't talk about subtracting. It
[52:30] talks about adding. He's going to add
[52:32] whatever we need.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; He's going to multiply it.
[52:42] And if children, the scripture says,
[52:43] "And then if children
[52:46] were heirs, heirs of God and joints with
[52:49] Christ,
[52:51] if so be that we suffer with him,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; that we may be also glorified together."
[52:58] the same process that he went through.
[53:01] We must not think it strange at the
[53:04] fiery trials that are sent to try us.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; God sends them. God allows them.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And he rejoices to see people his
[53:16] children don't succumb to it.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Don't become defeated by it. Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; So that uh we suffer with him that we
[53:26] may also
[53:28] uh be also glorified together. For we
[53:32] have not an high priest, Paul says also
[53:35] in Hebrews 4:15, "We have not an high
[53:38] priest which cannot be touched with the
[53:41] feeling of our infirmities,
[53:43] but was in all points tempted like as we
[53:47] are, yet without sin." He was tempted in
[53:51] all points. He was despised. He was
[53:53] rejected. He was turned aside. He was
[53:56] considered smitten of God. Oh, God did
[53:59] that to you.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; He experienced all that. That's why he
[54:06] can be a high priest
[54:08] &gt;&gt; to us.
[54:12] that the trial of your faith being much
[54:16] more precious than of gold that
[54:19] perisheth, though it be tried with fire,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; there hath no temptation taken you, but
[54:31] such as is common to man, but God is
[54:35] faithful, who will not suffer you to be
[54:38] tempted. Above that you are able,
[54:41] &gt;&gt; but will with the temptation also make a
[54:45] way of escape that you may be able to
[54:48] bear it.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily escape it, but able to
[54:52] bear it.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You know what? The bride's going to make
[54:58] it.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; She's going to make it victoriously.
[55:00] She's not going to make it by the skin
[55:02] of her teeth. She's going to make it
[55:04] absolutely victoriously.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is his promise. This is
[55:09] his word
[55:10] &gt;&gt; that you may be able to bear it.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Our life, brother Brandham says, speaks
[55:22] I'm uh rather this is not a quote. Now,
[55:25] our life speaks things after wounding
[55:30] &gt;&gt; that it could not say before
[55:34] &gt;&gt; the wounding.
[55:36] There are things that you can say after
[55:41] difficulties or
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a wounding. Now
[55:48] there are things that you can say after
[55:50] that wounding that you could not say
[55:54] before.
[55:56] Brother Bram says, "Your life speaks so
[55:59] much louder than your words. Till no
[56:03] matter what you say, people know what
[56:06] you are by what you are."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; How many recognize?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; How many have heard of Terry Fox?
[56:24] You only heard of him because of his
[56:25] wounding.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't gone through what he went
[56:33] through, you wouldn't even know his
[56:35] name.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't recognize the picture.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Terry Fox. In 1980,
[56:43] with one leg having been amputated, he
[56:46] embarked on a cross Canada run to raise
[56:49] money and awareness for cancer research.
[56:53] Though the spread of his cancer forced
[56:55] him to end his quest after 143 days,
[57:00] 5,373
[57:02] km and 3,339
[57:05] miles, and ultimately cost him his life.
[57:09] His determination and example created a
[57:13] lasting worldwide legacy. Now, I just
[57:16] want to stop there for a moment.
[57:19] He could have done a lot of other things
[57:21] when his leg was amputated.
[57:24] He could have gone to a wheelchair. He
[57:27] could have just said, "Well, I guess
[57:28] this is my life."
[57:31] He could have had the sympathy of his
[57:33] family,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; his church,
[57:36] &gt;&gt; if he has one, his friends.
[57:40] He was an athlete.
[57:42] He was well known in his local
[57:45] community.
[57:46] But he decided that that that he was
[57:49] going to do something
[57:52] and he was going to make this wound pay.
[57:56] Now when I say, "Do you recognize this
[57:59] fellow?" You say, "Yes." Why? And you
[58:03] say, "Well, who it is?" Most everyone
[58:05] would know that's Terry Fox. So the
[58:07] wound is speaking.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even know who it was if it
[58:12] wasn't for the wound.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:15] and the wound continued to speak. The
[58:18] annual Terry Fox run has grown to
[58:22] involve
[58:23] millions of participants in over 60
[58:26] countries
[58:27] and is now the world's largest one-day
[58:31] fundraiser for cancer research. Over 500
[58:35] million has been raised in his name.
[58:40] In 1980, Terry began the Marathon of
[58:43] Hope, a cross-country run to raise money
[58:46] for cancer research. Fox hoped to raise
[58:50] $1 for each of Canada's 24 million
[58:53] people. That was his goal to try to
[58:56] raise 24 million. He started with little
[59:00] fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland.
[59:02] In fact, is hardly ever anybody knew
[59:05] that he was starting out from St. John's
[59:08] Newfoundland.
[59:10] in April and ran the equivalent of a
[59:13] full marathon every day.
[59:17] Fox had become a national star by the
[59:21] time he reached Ontario. He made
[59:24] numerous public appearances with
[59:26] businessmen, athletes, and polit
[59:29] politicians.
[59:30] In his efforts to raise money, he was
[59:33] forced to end his run outside of Thunder
[59:36] Bay, Ontario, when the cancer spread to
[59:39] his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the
[59:42] disease and completing his marathon
[59:46] ended when he died nine months later.
[59:50] Fox was the youngest person
[59:52] ever named to a companion of the Order
[59:56] of Canada the nation's highest civilian
[59:59] award. He won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award
[1:00:04] as the nation's top sportsman and was
[1:00:07] named Canada's news maker of the year in
[1:00:10] both 1980 and 1981.
[1:00:13] Considered a national hero, he has had
[1:00:17] many buildings, roads, and parks named
[1:00:22] in his honor after the country.
[1:00:26] He said, "Even if," these are his words,
[1:00:29] "Even if I don't finish, we need others
[1:00:33] to continue. It's got to keep going."
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; That's pretty concise, isn't it? Even if
[1:00:40] I don't finish, we need others to
[1:00:42] continue.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; It's got to keep going.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, seeing we also,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now some other people
[1:00:54] that are running.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; You might be sitting here this morning,
[1:00:57] but we are running
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; a race
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; that that that supersedes even Terry
[1:01:03] Fox's marathon of hope. We are
[1:01:06] accompassed about with so great a cloud
[1:01:09] of witnesses. Let us lay aside every
[1:01:13] weight
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; and the sin which doth so easily beset
[1:01:16] us
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; and let us run with patience the race
[1:01:20] that is set before us.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Wonder if you can say that with me. Let
[1:01:24] us run the with patience the race that
[1:01:27] is set before us. Let's say it again.
[1:01:30] Let us run with patience the race that
[1:01:33] is set before us. Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And humble thyself. The prophet said,
[1:01:41] "The people that I have tried to tell
[1:01:43] this gospel truth to and they turn their
[1:01:47] back on it and walk away and laugh at
[1:01:50] it." Now, to me, that seems like it's an
[1:01:53] insult. I don't care to me but to the
[1:01:57] things that I've been trying I've been
[1:02:00] saying it's the truth trying to help
[1:02:03] them.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; I've been saying it's the truth trying
[1:02:07] to help them. Like like showing like
[1:02:11] shoving out a boat and say here it is
[1:02:14] cross over here.
[1:02:17] Get out of that swelling stream. You're
[1:02:20] going to die.
[1:02:22] He said, "You're you're going to perish
[1:02:24] there." And they just laugh at you and
[1:02:26] walk away. Well, to me, it feels like if
[1:02:30] they walk away, there's nothing more I
[1:02:32] can do about it. But I can but I c that
[1:02:36] I can do. But I want to run down the
[1:02:38] bank now and persuade them.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Come on back.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I've got to have that feeling. He said,
[1:02:45] "I've got to have that feeling that he
[1:02:48] wants to run down the bank that he wants
[1:02:50] to that he wants to call out to even
[1:02:52] people that have turned it aside,
[1:02:54] rejected it or rejected him and and but
[1:02:57] he knows that they're in a dangerous
[1:02:59] stream
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and they laugh at it and and think it's
[1:03:03] just nonsense. this all this divine
[1:03:06] healing or preaching that he was doing
[1:03:08] and the things that he was preaching and
[1:03:10] the manner in which he preached and the
[1:03:12] language and the grammar which he had
[1:03:15] great obstacles for a minister before
[1:03:18] tens of thousands of people but he
[1:03:20] realized that this is an eternal work
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and even if they do and they go away and
[1:03:26] they rush back on he's going to push the
[1:03:28] boat out
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; come on back.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; While I was writing this down and
[1:03:36] setting it, I said, I'm going to say
[1:03:38] that here today, maybe there is some and
[1:03:42] you're not where you ought to be. You
[1:03:44] know, you're not where you ought to be.
[1:03:46] You're in a dangerous stream.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to push the boat out
[1:03:51] and say, get in this boat.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Come back to this word. Come back to
[1:03:55] what you know God has spoken and God has
[1:03:58] honored.
[1:04:00] come on back. And I've got to have that
[1:04:03] feeling.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; And I can say to you today, I have that
[1:04:06] feeling.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You might be out in the internet
[1:04:09] someplace or or wherever, but I'm
[1:04:11] appealing uh especially to the people
[1:04:14] that are here because you are here. I'm
[1:04:17] appealing to you. I've got that feeling.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; I I I know there is no word like this
[1:04:23] word. I know there is no vindication
[1:04:26] like this vindication. It's never been
[1:04:28] in the history. Do you hear me? It's
[1:04:31] never been in the history of humanity.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; But you have access to it. You can hear
[1:04:38] it.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I was listening to the voice uh the
[1:04:42] voice of the sign.
[1:04:45] And I won't get to that, but I was
[1:04:47] listening to the voice of the sign. And
[1:04:49] the first person they call in the
[1:04:52] healing line, you should hear. I mean,
[1:04:55] it is so detailed. It is so it it just
[1:04:59] compels you. It compels me to be a
[1:05:02] believer. Even if I read that one, it
[1:05:05] just so compelling. You can't have how
[1:05:08] do you have a man who's a stranger and
[1:05:10] tells such minute details of a person's
[1:05:13] life and and how things and people tried
[1:05:16] things and it failed for them and they
[1:05:18] tried this and tried that and he just
[1:05:20] details the whole person's life and then
[1:05:22] tell them their name at the end.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that?
[1:05:26] See this this is not that's a sign.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's a sign.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And God said to Moses and God spoke to
[1:05:34] this prophet, if they don't believe if
[1:05:37] they don't believe the voice of the
[1:05:40] first sign, they'll believe the voice of
[1:05:42] the second sign.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's those are the sign.
[1:05:47] But now a voice, he said, a voice comes
[1:05:49] behind the sign. Yeah,
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; you can have all kinds of signs and
[1:05:53] supernatural phenomena, but if you don't
[1:05:55] have a voice behind it, he said, "Forget
[1:05:58] it."
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; But we've had a powerful sign. The
[1:06:01] world's never seen such sign as this.
[1:06:03] And then they say, "We have a right to
[1:06:06] say, "What do we do with that sign? What
[1:06:08] do you do with that sign?" There's a
[1:06:10] voice that comes behind it. And not to
[1:06:12] heed. And if we fail to heed that voice,
[1:06:15] there is no hope.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; There's absolutely no hope.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another sign.
[1:06:20] You're not going to make it right in the
[1:06:22] tribulation. You're just not going to
[1:06:23] make it, friends, if we turn down this
[1:06:26] voice.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I should have a lot more amens on that.
[1:06:49] Okay, we can shut that off just now.
[1:07:04] So we have
[1:07:07] I expect it to be fairly solemn while we
[1:07:11] speak about this. We all have what we
[1:07:15] may term a a flaw
[1:07:18] and flaws in our lives.
[1:07:21] And as I said to you previously and I'll
[1:07:24] say it now again, some are allowed by
[1:07:28] God. Many are allowed by God.
[1:07:33] He will allow people to inflict them,
[1:07:37] but they're allowed by God.
[1:07:39] There are situations that you didn't
[1:07:42] invite.
[1:07:44] If you had any choice, you would do
[1:07:47] anything in your power to avoid or to
[1:07:50] escape it.
[1:07:52] I want to take the principles of Jesus
[1:07:55] life.
[1:07:56] He didn't try to escape it. He didn't
[1:08:00] try to
[1:08:02] just get some uh you know
[1:08:05] substitutionary thing to He didn't try
[1:08:08] to just take some pill.
[1:08:11] Didn't try to you know alleviate.
[1:08:15] He just accepted it the way it was.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Accepted
[1:08:20] what life was handing him.
[1:08:23] But this is where we fail.
[1:08:26] We fail to take that wound
[1:08:30] and surrender it somehow to God
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit
[1:08:37] so that that wound here at Terry Fox can
[1:08:40] take a cancer and an amputated leg
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and and not that he become a hero that
[1:08:46] we're not attempting to become a hero
[1:08:48] but he did something
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; for humanity.
[1:08:53] Amen. He built on his wound. He took He
[1:08:57] took his wound and said, "I'm not going
[1:08:59] to succumb to this.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; I'm just not going to give into it.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it do something for
[1:09:05] me. I'm going to make it do something
[1:09:07] for people that suffer like I have
[1:09:10] suffered."
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Well, we're not in a run for a cure for
[1:09:13] cancer. We're in a run for a cure for
[1:09:16] sin.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And we have the cure for sin.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; We have the antidote. I don't care what
[1:09:23] you're bound with. I don't care what
[1:09:25] you're tempted with. I don't care what
[1:09:27] the devil has said to you. We have the
[1:09:29] cure right here today.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I have the cure right in this book. We
[1:09:36] have the cure right here in this
[1:09:37] message.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; There's been nothing left out.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "It's finished." It was
[1:09:44] finished. Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And when we have a prophet say that all
[1:09:47] the mysteries have been unveiled, then
[1:09:50] you can guarantee all the mysteries been
[1:09:52] unveiled. It's up to you and I to
[1:09:54] discover what they are.
[1:10:08] I want you to have a good look at your
[1:10:11] life.
[1:10:13] Some have
[1:10:15] it could be something as little as
[1:10:17] financial, but I don't want to speak
[1:10:19] about that.
[1:10:21] Sometimes it's from broken homes,
[1:10:25] the deepest wounds
[1:10:28] or from the loss of a loved one.
[1:10:32] These are deep wounds and they're
[1:10:33] continuing wounds and things that you
[1:10:38] kind of
[1:10:40] wake up to yourself and you find
[1:10:42] yourself thinking about it. It's in your
[1:10:43] mind. You're turning it over. Turning it
[1:10:45] over. I'm going to say something to you
[1:10:48] that won't you ever forget it. That's
[1:10:50] exactly what Satan wants to try to use.
[1:10:53] He wants to get into that subconscious
[1:10:55] and use that thing and wear you down and
[1:10:58] bring you down. And then you begin to
[1:11:01] question, why did God do that? Why has
[1:11:03] God allowed this? And why am I in this
[1:11:05] situation?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; I've got I've got a word for you today.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe I have a word from God for
[1:11:17] you.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; You can build on top of that
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; and you can use it for the glory of God.
[1:11:23] God will use it for his glory. Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I have testimonies also that are seated
[1:11:28] right here of people who have faced
[1:11:31] faced insurmountable,
[1:11:34] cruel,
[1:11:36] heartbreaking, heartrening
[1:11:38] experiences.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But they kept their eyes on the goal and
[1:11:44] they said, "I will not be moved.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to cease from my
[1:11:48] fellowship. I'm not going to cease from
[1:11:51] my worship. I'm not going to cease from
[1:11:53] serving my God. I'm in fact is because
[1:11:56] Satan is trying to do that. I'm going to
[1:11:59] serve him more fervently.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pull out all the stops.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to say, Lord God,
[1:12:07] here I am.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Use me.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And we ought to say on a continual
[1:12:12] basis, what would you have me to do?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; God, what would you have me to do? I
[1:12:18] find myself in this situation. What
[1:12:21] would you have me to do? You know the
[1:12:23] dilemma.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; You know the pain. You know the
[1:12:27] wounding. And I don't have to relate
[1:12:29] that to you. Don't tell your neighbors.
[1:12:32] Don't get on the phone. That won't help.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Talk to God about it.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? He's the
[1:12:39] only one who knows.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Are we getting anywhere? Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Some of these are allowed by God.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to take my time this
[1:12:54] morning.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Some of these
[1:12:59] are brought upon us by others.
[1:13:03] And some others are still
[1:13:05] self-inflicted.
[1:13:07] We do things and we do silly things and
[1:13:09] we do foolish things. We do something
[1:13:13] that really brings a lot of trouble our
[1:13:17] way
[1:13:19] and even that
[1:13:22] even that
[1:13:24] if you surrender you can't go back and
[1:13:26] undo it.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; So what do I do? Am I going to just
[1:13:31] wallow in it?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Am I just going to let the thing
[1:13:35] deteriorate me
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and I become an atrophied believer?
[1:13:39] Right.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I can't move. I can't hardly speak. I'm
[1:13:43] so twisted up and so bound up with this
[1:13:45] thing.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; I get bitter about it.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; If God does things or if this happens in
[1:13:51] the message, well, and I'm finished with
[1:13:54] it. Listen, friends, that's not the
[1:13:56] attitude.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Just say, "God, you know,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about our lives. I'm not
[1:14:03] speaking about what's happened in our
[1:14:05] church and so on. Don't get so don't get
[1:14:08] so confined to that. That's not what I'm
[1:14:10] talking about. I'm talking about our
[1:14:11] individual lives.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And so, some are how however it happens,
[1:14:20] whatever took place, and they do. I'm
[1:14:24] talking about real situations. I'm
[1:14:26] talking about things that you think
[1:14:27] about when you leave this building this
[1:14:29] morning. I want to send you out not a
[1:14:32] mere with a hope, not merely with some
[1:14:34] inspiration. I want to let you know
[1:14:36] there's a message from God that God can
[1:14:39] use any kind of failure. He can use any
[1:14:42] kind of disaster. He can use it for his
[1:14:44] glory. And that the attitude that you
[1:14:47] and I must have is say within your heart
[1:14:49] and soul, I am going to build on that.
[1:14:52] If Terry Fox can do what he does, and
[1:14:54] I've got some others I want to bring to
[1:14:55] you,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to waste my life.
[1:14:58] Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; You know, Bill Gates was the most
[1:15:07] wealthiest man in the world, apparently.
[1:15:09] Some say,
[1:15:11] worth about $50 billion.
[1:15:15] But he realized
[1:15:18] in his own way, he realized that this
[1:15:21] isn't life. This isn't what life is made
[1:15:23] up of. So he resigned and left his uh uh
[1:15:29] Microsoft
[1:15:31] and uh his partner became the head CEO
[1:15:36] and he he said it simply I'm done trying
[1:15:39] to make it now I'm going to spend the
[1:15:41] rest of my life I and my wife giving it
[1:15:43] away
[1:15:44] and are trying to do great things in
[1:15:46] Africa and do things just in the news
[1:15:49] recently that he wants to do things for
[1:15:51] the educational system and in uh in
[1:15:55] United States and other parts of the
[1:15:57] world. And he talked about his children.
[1:15:59] He said he intends to give most of it
[1:16:02] away and just leave enough for his
[1:16:04] children to be well cared for. He's not
[1:16:07] going to leave them as billionaires.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; He has another vision. I respect him for
[1:16:13] that.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; I read quite a bit about what he may do.
[1:16:17] something and and and there's nothing I
[1:16:20] would say extra spiritual special about
[1:16:23] his decision. He just realizes the
[1:16:25] emptiness of just having shares and
[1:16:29] you're worth billions. Who cares?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Where's it going to where what what's it
[1:16:34] going to mean?
[1:16:36] You believe in the beyond the curtain of
[1:16:38] time.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? One moment on the
[1:16:42] other side.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Zero.
[1:16:46] zero.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; So why should we spend all of our
[1:16:49] energies
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; focused all on this life what we can get
[1:16:53] and what we can achieve? If God gives it
[1:16:55] to you, fine. Use it for his kingdom.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have it, serve him
[1:17:00] anyway.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; But why why spending our time and all of
[1:17:04] our life and sapping up all our energy.
[1:17:06] I'm not talking about not working when
[1:17:08] you're working. But you got your focus
[1:17:10] on the kingdom of God. You got your
[1:17:12] focus on the things that have reality to
[1:17:15] them,
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; We allow God to use it. In Acts,
[1:17:28] the Bible says, "And when they had laid
[1:17:30] many stripes, I have I have a lot of
[1:17:32] examples,
[1:17:34] spiritual and and and
[1:17:37] uh out of human life as well. And when
[1:17:40] they had laid many stripes upon them,
[1:17:42] we're not reading a story book. We're
[1:17:44] talking about two of our friends,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:17:51] them, if it was two of our brothers that
[1:17:53] were here that were just in this
[1:17:55] situation, say, "Well, last night they
[1:17:57] took and and and subjected these men to
[1:18:01] stripes and they whipped them."
[1:18:04] We'd feel differently about it.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; This is two of our brothers. And they
[1:18:09] cast them into prison, charging the
[1:18:12] jailer to keep them safely, who having
[1:18:15] received such a charge, he thrust them
[1:18:18] into the inner prison, probably like uh
[1:18:22] isolation or and made their feet fast in
[1:18:26] the stalks. And at midnight, Paul and
[1:18:30] Silas prayed.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; They didn't succumb to it
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; or hands. And how are you, Silas? Oh,
[1:18:37] I'm all right. My my feet are hurting.
[1:18:40] Why these stripes are starting to really
[1:18:42] sting and and with the blood uh you know
[1:18:46] coagulating on our backs and oh
[1:18:50] you think we could have avoided this?
[1:18:52] You think we could have done something
[1:18:54] different or do you think we we upset
[1:18:57] the people? No. They prayed and began to
[1:19:00] sing.
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] And they sang praises to God and the
[1:19:10] prisoners heard them.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God turned them loose
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; supernaturally from the thing that they
[1:19:18] were in.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible speaks.
[1:19:25] They could have, you know, said, "Well,
[1:19:26] how how did this happen? What happened?
[1:19:28] My family or my relatives or my children
[1:19:32] or my husband or my wife or what? I'm
[1:19:35] just I'm just take I'm just taking a
[1:19:37] broad brush.
[1:19:40] I don't care what the circumstance is.
[1:19:43] It's it's it just doesn't mean anything
[1:19:47] to me for this service. We either have a
[1:19:50] God who's absolutely in control.
[1:19:59] I'm just looking down seeing brother
[1:20:01] Ryan and Sister Yolena and how her
[1:20:04] father was turned down and I prayed
[1:20:07] about that. I prayed before and I prayed
[1:20:10] after said Elena
[1:20:12] that brother Nino I I I thought it's so
[1:20:14] cruel
[1:20:16] that he can't get to maybe be with his
[1:20:19] children in church or go with his wife
[1:20:21] and so on and this is years
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; years
[1:20:27] and no doubt he could be sitting home
[1:20:28] this morning just saying why is this now
[1:20:32] I don't have another appointment till
[1:20:33] next April they just told me to go home
[1:20:37] and there's nothing No word. And these
[1:20:40] are the authorities.
[1:20:42] I can tell you I can tell you they could
[1:20:44] answer that man's problem in 10 minutes.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And it goes for year after year after
[1:20:51] year. That thing because this is Satan's
[1:20:55] Eden. Don't forget it. You're not going
[1:20:58] to have a good time in Satan's age,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; but you're going to have a victorious
[1:21:02] time because the power of the Holy
[1:21:05] Spirit is greater than anything in this
[1:21:07] present evil age.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And somehow, sister said to Elena, you
[1:21:12] take a message to your dad. Somehow God
[1:21:15] will turn this thing around.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; God will get glory out of it.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He just needs to surrender it and yield
[1:21:22] it to God. say, "Well, you know, Lord,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says, I'm sorry, the
[1:21:27] message is saying in harvest time when
[1:21:31] God saw that perfect one, now he was
[1:21:34] perfect one. He didn't bring anything
[1:21:36] upon himself. He didn't he not a thing
[1:21:41] that he did. He He was without sin. He
[1:21:45] was the perfect one. And he struck him
[1:21:47] and marred him."
[1:21:50] And Isaiah said he was wounded for the
[1:21:53] transgressions for our transgressions
[1:21:55] and bruised for our iniquities. In the
[1:21:58] identified masterpiece of God, he said
[1:22:00] there was a perfect masterpiece and God
[1:22:03] smote it. What an example it was. He
[1:22:06] said God smote him for us. That's what
[1:22:10] makes him the perfect masterpiece.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The thing that you
[1:22:18] you you can h you you you can excuse me
[1:22:21] for just I'm I'm trying to be very
[1:22:22] careful with my words, but you have a
[1:22:24] choice of what you do with your life.
[1:22:29] You can either simply give in and
[1:22:31] succumb to events etc.
[1:22:35] We've had a brother and it may be
[1:22:37] sitting here, brother John, and he's
[1:22:40] been without his wife and children for
[1:22:43] over eight years,
[1:22:47] held up in a legal
[1:22:50] hassle and the just complete
[1:22:53] incompetence
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; of our system
[1:22:57] and the and a man is without his f.
[1:22:59] Isn't there any Isn't there any common
[1:23:02] sense?
[1:23:04] A man is without his family.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Surely there's a way that he could be
[1:23:09] with his family
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; even if they came to visit or whatever
[1:23:13] more. You understand?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, there may be complications and
[1:23:19] sections and this and that and the other
[1:23:21] thing." Listen friends, all of the laws
[1:23:24] and the government and everything are
[1:23:26] for the betterment of humanity, not for
[1:23:28] the oppression of humanity.
[1:23:32] I'm going to unload.
[1:23:43] People have been smitten and people have
[1:23:46] been wounded and people have been hurt.
[1:23:51] Even with Jesus Christ, man was
[1:23:54] permitted to wound him to mar and to
[1:23:57] slay the Lord Jesus Christ. But it was
[1:24:01] God that smokeote him in allowing it. He
[1:24:06] was God's lamb.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; God raised him up to die. Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And God allowed people to do this.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; God raised you up.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; God gave you birth
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; and raised you up
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; and brought you right to this present
[1:24:23] time
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; for what purpose? Merely to do some
[1:24:28] housework or to work at a job or to get
[1:24:32] an education or or what is the purpose?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Why are we here? Is that a good
[1:24:37] question? And the prophet said if we
[1:24:40] need to go to him who brought us here
[1:24:42] and ask him what he wants us to do,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; we ask our employer
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; because we want to do a good job. We ask
[1:24:51] who we work for, what would you like me
[1:24:53] to do? What is my task? What is my job
[1:24:56] description? That's normal. But it
[1:24:59] wasn't our employer that brought us
[1:25:01] here.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; It was God who brought us here. What do
[1:25:04] you want me to do?
[1:25:06] I'm not I'm not against education. The
[1:25:08] the more education you have, perhaps the
[1:25:11] greater opportunity you have. But don't
[1:25:13] serve that as a god.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Don't serve your job as a god.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; They're not gods. They they will try to
[1:25:21] Satan will try to control you
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; through economics,
[1:25:25] through education, through science,
[1:25:27] through civilization. He'll try to
[1:25:29] control it. Maybe through sports. Don't
[1:25:31] tell me that sports isn't controlling.
[1:25:33] It's controlling millions. Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Not only millions of sports people, it's
[1:25:37] controlling untold tens of millions of
[1:25:41] viewers.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; It tells you what you're going to do at
[1:25:44] a certain hour of the day. You're going
[1:25:46] to be sitting in front of some
[1:25:47] television or whatever more or in front
[1:25:49] of the radio. You wouldn't miss that for
[1:25:51] anything.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Who's telling you to do that? Not God
[1:25:55] Almighty.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying there's anything
[1:25:58] sinful. Maybe say hearing a a baseball
[1:26:01] game or a hockey game or something. I'm
[1:26:03] not saying that that's sinful. I'm just
[1:26:05] saying that we need to have God in
[1:26:07] preeminence.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:20] Now, when brother Brandon was describing
[1:26:22] Michelangelo and the statue,
[1:26:26] he struck the masterpiece and I I
[1:26:28] emphasized that two weeks ago and
[1:26:30] created the flaw. Brother Brandham said
[1:26:33] it was the flaw that made it the
[1:26:34] masterpiece. But now I'm on the second
[1:26:37] part of that. It was he he was so
[1:26:40] inspired that when he saw what was in
[1:26:42] his mind,
[1:26:45] he struck it and cried out, "Speak."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That was what was to follow.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You happen to be the speech
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; of this message.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You're the interpretation. People are
[1:27:02] reading you that will never pick up a
[1:27:04] message book,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; but they're reading you. And because of
[1:27:07] your life, they may well then pick one
[1:27:09] up
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; and may may well enter into eternal life
[1:27:13] by your life.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; If I gave you the choice today,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing all of you
[1:27:24] and we're here together. We're in this
[1:27:26] together. Would you sooner send souls
[1:27:30] into eternal life or would you sooner
[1:27:32] send them towards condemnation and guilt
[1:27:35] and damnation?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Even in this life, I mean, we can say,
[1:27:39] well, we believe in predestination.
[1:27:41] Indeed, we do.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But we don't necessarily believe all the
[1:27:45] things that have to happen. All the
[1:27:48] things that do happen have to happen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You can save your life from many wounds
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; and many hurts.
[1:27:58] receive Christ early.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; So the flaw spoke back
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; when he struck him at Calvary.
[1:28:12] Speak.
[1:28:14] The flaw spoke back.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; The wound
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; had a voice.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; That life from that broken blood cell,
[1:28:27] it was broken. The new creation of God,
[1:28:31] that blood cell that attached itself
[1:28:34] into the womb of Mary, a virgin. That
[1:28:38] blood cell now was broken by God
[1:28:40] himself. God who put it together and
[1:28:43] wrote it and had it spoken by uh
[1:28:46] prophets. And it brother Brandham says
[1:28:49] it was the words of the prophets that
[1:28:52] fastened or attached themselves
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And now God breaks that blood cell so
[1:29:01] that the life from that one can go out
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; from his side.
[1:29:09] The blood cell was broken.
[1:29:12] And I will say it, it was broken to give
[1:29:14] the flaw a voice, to give the wound a
[1:29:18] voice.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And the blood cell spoke back.
[1:29:23] The blood cell said things that wasn't
[1:29:26] necessarily an audible voice, but but
[1:29:28] but the broken blood cell, the wound
[1:29:32] spoke and said, "Redemption is
[1:29:34] finished." Yes.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; The wound spoke and said, "The family,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; the family, no wonder he could say over
[1:29:46] in Hebrews,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; behold, I and the children,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; thou hast given me."
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; What could say that? Jesus didn't say
[1:29:55] that while he was in life. There's
[1:29:57] things that the voice of the womb spoke
[1:29:59] after.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul picks it up, sir. And
[1:30:04] he picks it up and he brings it from the
[1:30:06] Old Testament. Behold, I What is that?
[1:30:08] That was the wound that was speaking.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; As Terry Fox said things after the
[1:30:14] wound, he couldn't say those before the
[1:30:17] wound as a healthy young strapping young
[1:30:19] man. He could never have he could never
[1:30:21] have earned 500 million for cancer
[1:30:24] research. The world wouldn't have known
[1:30:26] him. He wouldn't have had all the
[1:30:28] adoration and all all the honor and
[1:30:31] streets named after him, etc. No, that
[1:30:33] was because of the wound.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; He did something with the wound.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; God has allowed us.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I say that whatever your life is, God
[1:30:42] has allowed it.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; You might be going down easy street. You
[1:30:45] might say, "Hey, I don't know what
[1:30:47] you're talking about, Brother Ed. I I I
[1:30:49] I never tasted any of those things."
[1:30:51] Well, you'll remember this message
[1:30:53] someday.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Now I know what he was talking
[1:30:56] about.
[1:31:00] I told you I'm really going to, you
[1:31:02] know, unload.
[1:31:05] Sometimes even believers they start to
[1:31:08] be pained
[1:31:10] and the pain of their wound
[1:31:14] and the marring is so
[1:31:17] the suffering is so great
[1:31:20] that we can get
[1:31:23] ourselves all medicated up
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; so that we don't even live in the real
[1:31:28] world.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:31:34] Because it's the real world that's too
[1:31:36] painful. It is.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; It is a The real world is a painful
[1:31:41] place.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; But we won't get ourselves and give
[1:31:48] ourselves.
[1:31:51] I've gone and talked to people more than
[1:31:53] once.
[1:31:56] People who were born in believers homes
[1:31:59] and heard the message and sat in this
[1:32:01] church and heard it. I've gone to the
[1:32:03] psychiatric ward
[1:32:06] in the hospital to visit them
[1:32:10] and are all dazed
[1:32:13] trying to focus with their eyes.
[1:32:17] And I said
[1:32:20] I said to one person, "You don't belong
[1:32:22] here.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; These people here and the medical staff,
[1:32:28] they might be able to help these people
[1:32:29] that are walking around.
[1:32:33] Maybe you haven't been there. Brother
[1:32:36] Ed's been there. They're walking around
[1:32:40] and one nurse chase chasing a fellow
[1:32:42] with a hypodermic needle and he's
[1:32:45] yelling, "No, no, he's just going wild.
[1:32:48] A great big man cuz he doesn't want it."
[1:32:52] She has to give it to him to quieten him
[1:32:54] down. Maybe he's a violent man. I don't
[1:32:56] know. I tell you, this world hasn't got
[1:33:01] a remedy for anything that God allows us
[1:33:03] to go through. If God allows us to go
[1:33:06] through something, he's got a remedy for
[1:33:08] it. And furthermore, he wants to glorify
[1:33:11] himself with it.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Don't simply succumb to it and say,
[1:33:15] "Well, I guess that's the way it is."
[1:33:16] That's not the way it is. God can take
[1:33:18] that and glorify himself with it.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Truth. All right.
[1:33:41] behold I and the children God hath given
[1:33:43] me.
[1:33:48] And the Godhead explained, he said,
[1:33:49] "When the blood cell was broke, it
[1:33:52] wasn't merely a man.
[1:33:55] That was God's life was released.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; If you have received
[1:34:03] the life from Jesus Christ,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; it is not the life of a man. You have
[1:34:08] received God's life,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; divine life,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; divinity.
[1:34:16] And when the blood cell was broke in
[1:34:18] Jesus Christ, he said again, God was
[1:34:21] released. He was God. That blood wasn't
[1:34:24] Jewish. That blood wasn't Gentile. That
[1:34:27] was a creative blood cell. God himself.
[1:34:32] It's still a creative blood cell.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And I think I touched on this, maybe
[1:34:45] just mentioned it, but I want to take it
[1:34:48] a little bit further.
[1:34:51] When God
[1:34:53] saw that masterpiece
[1:34:55] and it was so perfect, it was just the
[1:34:57] image of what he had in his mind.
[1:35:00] Couldn't have been entirely just Jesus
[1:35:02] Christ
[1:35:04] because even when God had a son here on
[1:35:07] earth in the form of Adam,
[1:35:10] he said, "It's good. It's very good."
[1:35:12] And then he took his rest.
[1:35:15] But when Eve,
[1:35:17] Eve, it was so perfect. But he brought
[1:35:20] Eve out of Adam because there had to be
[1:35:25] that family. That what was Satan
[1:35:28] destroyed in the beginning. And so now
[1:35:32] when God saw Christ and he smote him at
[1:35:35] Calvary,
[1:35:40] it wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just
[1:35:43] that he was smiting Christ at Calvary,
[1:35:46] but he was looking beyond the physical
[1:35:49] body of Jesus Christ. He was looking
[1:35:51] beyond that. He was looking at the Do
[1:35:55] you know what was happening? Satan's
[1:35:57] head was being crushed by the seed of
[1:36:01] the woman. He was seeing Satan's head
[1:36:04] crushed. He was saying seeing the
[1:36:06] believers down through the ages
[1:36:08] defeating the enemy. He could see the
[1:36:11] martyrs going to the martyrdom and not
[1:36:14] bowing to it, not bowing to the system.
[1:36:18] He saw the bride of Jesus Christ, right?
[1:36:21] He saw a seventh messenger coming. He
[1:36:23] saw a prophet coming
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; with a voice. He saw someone taking the
[1:36:29] the the book that had been sealed. All
[1:36:31] of that. He could see all of that. That
[1:36:33] was that's it was such inspiration to
[1:36:36] him.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I think would inspire.
[1:36:48] I really do. As I pondered this and as I
[1:36:51] prayed about this subject,
[1:36:53] I could see God seeing people
[1:36:58] where, you know, it would almost be a
[1:36:59] privilege to live in a martyr age
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; and they were anointed for it.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And they didn't run away from it. He
[1:37:05] said they ran to it
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; because that was the anointing that was
[1:37:08] on them. They ran to it.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; We've got a much more difficult age. It
[1:37:13] would be it would be simpler say uh uh
[1:37:16] deny that or deny that or you go to the
[1:37:21] chamber whatever more. You say well no
[1:37:23] I'm not going to deny it and do what you
[1:37:25] wish to do.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But this age this is far more subtle.
[1:37:33] just laugh. You know, you know what's so
[1:37:36] subtle about this age is because Satan
[1:37:40] can accept the fact that a pe a a person
[1:37:44] is almost a believer.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I identify with it. I go to church. I
[1:37:51] sing all the same songs and and I'm
[1:37:54] almost a believer
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and I confess to be a believer. But
[1:38:00] somehow the life and the testimony are
[1:38:02] two different things.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "Our life is
[1:38:06] speaking so loud in heaven that he can't
[1:38:09] hear the words."
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So now it's what is lived, the life that
[1:38:18] is lived. And God saw, friends, we talk
[1:38:22] about bride, bride, bride. God saw the
[1:38:25] bride.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; God saw her. Yeah,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; God saw who was coming through the
[1:38:30] gates. God saw all that. And I believe
[1:38:33] it was the whole scene
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; that God saw that his arc enemy was
[1:38:39] finished. His head was crushed. His
[1:38:43] deceit and deceiving in the garden is
[1:38:46] finished. And out from this sacrifice,
[1:38:49] out from this wound is going to come a
[1:38:52] whole host of witnesses. And they're
[1:38:55] going to declare
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; as their savior. They're going to
[1:39:00] declare this sacrifice as their
[1:39:02] atonement. They're going to declare it
[1:39:05] openly and boldly.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And that inspiration when he saw that
[1:39:12] perfect image, that inspiration caused
[1:39:15] him to strike it
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and blood and water came forth and
[1:39:20] spirit.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to, you know, feel
[1:39:29] as though I'm
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; zeroing in on just this congregation.
[1:39:36] Not at all. Brother Brandham said, "All
[1:39:38] the prophets had flaws."
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Just as well that we admit, you know, we
[1:39:44] got flaws.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; I talked a little bit about the sticky
[1:39:48] nature, but uh I I don't want to dwell
[1:39:50] on that. But he said all the prophets
[1:39:53] had flaws.
[1:39:55] And regardless of the flaw that we may
[1:39:57] carry, God will turn it to his glory and
[1:40:02] to your victory
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; if you just yield it to him.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can I yield it to
[1:40:12] him?" By yielding yourself to him.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yield yourself to him and be in full
[1:40:16] preparation for an answer from God. When
[1:40:19] a person fully surrenders themselves,
[1:40:22] I'm here to be a testimony to this. I
[1:40:26] don't have that many years. We don't
[1:40:28] have that many days. We don't know what
[1:40:30] tomorrow holds. I'm here to be a voice.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; To give voice to that wound.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; There was a man that was born blind.
[1:40:51] That's quite an impediment.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Born blind.
[1:40:57] And the disciples
[1:41:00] asked Jesus saying, "Master, who did
[1:41:03] send?
[1:41:04] This man or his parents
[1:41:08] that he was born blind?"
[1:41:11] There's got to be some reason,
[1:41:14] something that we could mentally grasp
[1:41:16] in our mind. Why is this man born blind?
[1:41:20] Just think of it, friends.
[1:41:22] Sight is so precious
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; to see the beauty and the flowers and
[1:41:27] all of the things and and the creation,
[1:41:29] how marvelous it is. But you're born
[1:41:31] blind,
[1:41:36] lived in a dark world for years and
[1:41:39] years and years, grew up with friends
[1:41:42] and never saw their face.
[1:41:46] born blind. Who sinned? The man or his
[1:41:51] parents? There's got to be a reasonable
[1:41:53] answer.
[1:41:55] Some place to nail the guilt,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; the responsibility for this. And Jesus
[1:42:01] said, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor
[1:42:05] his parents, but that the works of God
[1:42:08] should be made manifest in him,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; that God would get the glory." You know
[1:42:14] what friends? You know the problem even
[1:42:16] in this message? People don't understand
[1:42:18] God.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; How do you understand that kind of God?
[1:42:21] This man been born blind.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Wasn't even a a a demon apparently
[1:42:28] because God allowed it
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; for that moment.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; So that Jesus Christ could get glory and
[1:42:35] give him his sight.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, was that worth it? Is
[1:42:39] that the kind of God?" Yeah, that's the
[1:42:40] kind of God we serve.
[1:42:46] And God was glorified
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; and the man was healed. What a wound he
[1:42:51] carried.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; What a flaw
[1:42:56] all through his life.
[1:43:01] Somehow I'm I I could dwell on all of
[1:43:03] these, but
[1:43:05] uh
[1:43:07] brother Brandham said that I believe
[1:43:09] that every bornagain member of the body
[1:43:11] of Christ,
[1:43:13] every member of the body of Christ is a
[1:43:18] paradox in themselves. Amen.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; You know a paradox. What a paradox is is
[1:43:24] unbelievable yet but but might be true
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; because something happened to you that
[1:43:29] changed your whole being and anyone
[1:43:31] could look at that and know that what a
[1:43:34] paradox is is a miracle. Unless that
[1:43:37] happens you cannot be a Christian. There
[1:43:40] must be a paradox for you to become a
[1:43:42] Christian because no one can change the
[1:43:45] spirit in a man and give him a new
[1:43:47] birth.
[1:43:49] coming here to church or shaking the
[1:43:50] right hand or none none of that will
[1:43:53] give you a new birth outside of God. God
[1:43:55] alone is the only one that could do it.
[1:43:58] And is a miracle how that God can take a
[1:44:01] man's thinking and his ways and his life
[1:44:04] and everything and change it from what
[1:44:06] it was to what it can be.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; What he can make it
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; a paradox. It's a situation that seems
[1:44:16] to be absurd or contradictory,
[1:44:19] but in fact
[1:44:22] it is or may be true.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Our lives are a contradiction. A
[1:44:28] believer is a contradiction
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; in this generation. And
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; so there are all kinds of wounds, scars,
[1:44:40] marring, emotional, there's complexes
[1:44:44] and uh
[1:44:47] he said pray that God will place into my
[1:44:50] heart. Brother Brand was saying standing
[1:44:52] in a gap, pray that God will place into
[1:44:55] my heart that something that I lost out
[1:44:58] there in that complex. It's so easy to
[1:45:02] build a complex.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; That's true, Lord.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to build a complex. I'm
[1:45:08] saying that to this congregation and the
[1:45:10] listening congregation today because we
[1:45:13] don't want that to afflict our lives.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; You get build up a certain feeling and
[1:45:19] it's a complex. And brother Brandham
[1:45:21] built up a feeling and he had he had
[1:45:24] this complex.
[1:45:27] Uh sometimes it can be
[1:45:31] from
[1:45:34] brother Bram said now the genes and the
[1:45:36] father and the mother of this boy he's
[1:45:39] talking about a young man and a young
[1:45:41] man wanted to get married
[1:45:44] to a girl.
[1:45:46] So he said the genes in the father
[1:45:48] mother this boy he said no matter how
[1:45:49] much they are converted
[1:45:52] still remains the flesh that's been
[1:45:54] interbred out into to to this boy.
[1:45:58] Therefore the boy has has got a complex
[1:46:01] in him just like from his mother's
[1:46:04] family and they are not forgiving. They
[1:46:07] will not apologize. And that's where
[1:46:10] that boy stands. He says, you know,
[1:46:14] because he he had an attraction to this
[1:46:16] young lady and then did something, they
[1:46:19] don't go into any detail, did something
[1:46:21] and just left her high and dry and
[1:46:22] walked away. And brother Brand as a
[1:46:27] prophet nails it back and says that's
[1:46:29] because he has a complex and he goes and
[1:46:31] describes the mother and father and the
[1:46:34] father was an Irishman and the mother
[1:46:36] was a German. And he says, you know, the
[1:46:38] one family, uh, they're wild and their
[1:46:41] fathers are wild and they're drunkards
[1:46:44] and they're they're shooting and
[1:46:46] everything. They're just a wild bunch.
[1:46:48] And the mother is a different person.
[1:46:50] They're just they just stare. They will
[1:46:53] never forgive or they it's hard for them
[1:46:56] to apologize and a completely different
[1:46:59] nature. And he says the boy is a
[1:47:00] complex. It was in the genes of the
[1:47:03] parents and came down to him. Oh, there
[1:47:06] he is, friends. Some of you young
[1:47:07] fellas, young ladies,
[1:47:10] maybe maybe you're going through
[1:47:11] something and it actually came down to
[1:47:14] you.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Came down to you.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; So you say, well,
[1:47:24] I am the way I am because of maybe my
[1:47:26] parents. Yeah, that's what he said.
[1:47:30] We say, now what do we do?
[1:47:34] You better surrender to God. Are you
[1:47:36] going to carry it all your life?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And you can surrender to God. Don't sit
[1:47:42] here just looking at me.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; You can surrender. There isn't anything
[1:47:48] that God God knew exactly what you would
[1:47:51] experience in your life. He knew
[1:47:53] precisely the home you'd come from. He
[1:47:56] know precisely everything you would
[1:47:58] experience in life. Everything. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And things you don't want to even talk
[1:48:03] about, things that you've heard, things
[1:48:05] that are in the back of your mind and
[1:48:07] you don't want to even express, you
[1:48:08] cannot express. Sometimes they're so
[1:48:10] deep they can't get it out.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:48:31] He said, "Don't ever build up a complex.
[1:48:34] Lacking the Holy Spirit can cause a
[1:48:36] complex."
[1:48:40] Brother Brandon talks about a young man
[1:48:42] in the church right when he was speaking
[1:48:44] and he was a minister.
[1:48:46] He was sitting there a pastor of a
[1:48:48] church. But he said when he was a young
[1:48:51] man he came to my house
[1:48:53] and he had a complex but he said I saw
[1:48:56] the potentials in him
[1:48:58] and from a fine Bible institution but he
[1:49:02] just he but just he lacked what Moses
[1:49:05] lacked and that was the what the burning
[1:49:07] bush had. No, we we can have good people
[1:49:11] sitting here in the in the congregation
[1:49:13] this morning. I want to tell you we we
[1:49:15] need something more than good people. We
[1:49:18] need Holy Ghost fil people.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Holy. Don't settle for anything less.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't know you have the Holy
[1:49:26] Ghost and stop at nothing
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; cuz the Holy Ghost will start to live a
[1:49:30] life through you that's not your life.
[1:49:33] It's a life from another world. Life
[1:49:36] from another place.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I know I've been quite a while, but are
[1:49:44] you still listening?
[1:49:54] I'm going to skip some of this. I talked
[1:49:57] about Moses
[1:49:59] a couple weeks ago and he his impediment
[1:50:02] and brother Brandham said that he had a
[1:50:05] besetting sin. It was his temper.
[1:50:09] He says that in the message just in case
[1:50:11] you're wanting to know Israel in the
[1:50:13] church.
[1:50:15] And he said, "But you know, it's
[1:50:17] amazing. I I just want to take the
[1:50:20] time." He said, "He was raised a
[1:50:22] peculiar life,
[1:50:24] but God had his hand on him.
[1:50:27] How he was hid in the bull rush. Born in
[1:50:30] a time of persecution, just like Christ.
[1:50:34] Born a proper child, just like Christ.
[1:50:38] He was born in this world to be a
[1:50:40] deliverer, just like Christ. And oh how
[1:50:45] he his work how he was a lawgiver went
[1:50:49] up into the mountain stayed for 40 days
[1:50:52] came back down with the law and he his
[1:50:56] besetting sin was temper and he broke
[1:50:59] the commandments
[1:51:00] cast them down onto the earth when he
[1:51:03] saw what the people were doing. You
[1:51:05] renegades
[1:51:06] and he cast it down and that was his
[1:51:09] besetting sin. But that didn't change
[1:51:12] anything about him. He still was Moses
[1:51:14] and he was he came at the right time.
[1:51:17] You came at the right time.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; He was who he was. You are who you are.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And all he needed was an experience. All
[1:51:25] he needed was to stand in front of the
[1:51:27] burning bush
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; and hear a voice.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; I'm the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:51:35] Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And he start to live a different life
[1:51:40] after that. have been 40 years there.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to I'm going to just
[1:51:49] index this around. Be patient with me,
[1:51:51] would you?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he tells life story
[1:52:01] about 10 or more times.
[1:52:06] And I I I get extremely moved when I
[1:52:09] read life story. I remember the first
[1:52:11] time I read it, I was I think 18 years
[1:52:14] old and I just I was completely overcome
[1:52:19] and I literally wallowed on my bed. If
[1:52:23] you young fellas haven't read, you young
[1:52:26] ladies haven't read, you want to get and
[1:52:28] read life story.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And know that that God is not back
[1:52:34] there. That God is right here
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; speaking to you, dealing with you.
[1:52:39] I just tell you my own experience. I
[1:52:41] don't mind saying it. Brother Bram says
[1:52:43] sometimes I I'm I'm like a baby, you
[1:52:47] know, because he was crying. I was
[1:52:49] reading life story because it fit into
[1:52:51] part of this message which I'm coming to
[1:52:53] now and I had to stop.
[1:52:56] I just had to stop. I was so broken up.
[1:53:01] Then my whole life come before me.
[1:53:04] I tell you God, God knows how to speak
[1:53:06] to a person.
[1:53:14] He's talking about he met some people
[1:53:18] and now brother Brandham is a young man
[1:53:21] he just got married to Hope and he goes
[1:53:24] to tell Hope's mother
[1:53:27] and he says and that didn't work so good
[1:53:30] and she said William
[1:53:33] she said she's your wife
[1:53:36] you may take her if you want to but I
[1:53:39] but said I don't want my daughter drugg
[1:53:43] out among that bunch of trash.
[1:53:47] Brother Brad says h trash.
[1:53:51] Friends, I found out this that what she
[1:53:55] thought was trash
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; is the cream of the crop.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And that's right. I say that with
[1:54:01] respect.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] friend. He said, "The little girl that
[1:54:07] was too good to be with that trash, I
[1:54:10] buried her,
[1:54:13] just a little after that.
[1:54:15] Sorrow set in right there." He never
[1:54:20] said sorrow ended there. He says sorrow
[1:54:23] started right there. That's where it set
[1:54:25] in.
[1:54:32] He had walked in to the hospital. This
[1:54:34] is just within a few months of that
[1:54:37] trash.
[1:54:39] And because of his mother-in-law called
[1:54:43] these people trash and I don't want you
[1:54:45] to drag my daughter down there. She's
[1:54:46] your wife and you can do it, but I don't
[1:54:48] want her down there with those
[1:54:50] screaming, hollering people. And so he
[1:54:53] didn't do it. He didn't take her down
[1:54:56] there.
[1:54:58] And now his wife's in the hospital
[1:55:01] and Zamadair said, "Don't go in there.
[1:55:04] She's she's going."
[1:55:07] And he he said, "I pulled I pulled the
[1:55:09] door behind me. I looked over there. She
[1:55:13] had real dark eyes and black hair.
[1:55:17] German girl. She was all doubled up like
[1:55:20] this." And I looked down upon her and
[1:55:22] just as still, I put my hand on her
[1:55:26] forehead and it was real sticky. Didn't
[1:55:29] look like she had any life. I put my
[1:55:32] hand over on her head and said, "Oh,
[1:55:35] God."
[1:55:37] Now he's praying. "Oh God," I said,
[1:55:40] "That's my baby's mother. Let me let me
[1:55:44] tell her goodbye.
[1:55:47] Will you do it, Lord? Let me tell her
[1:55:50] goodbye.
[1:55:52] I don't want her to go without telling
[1:55:54] her goodbye. Will you help me, dear God?
[1:55:59] If there's forgiveness in your great
[1:56:01] heart, now he had a reason for saying
[1:56:03] that. If there's forgiveness in your
[1:56:06] great heart,
[1:56:08] will you just let me say goodbye to her?
[1:56:11] Said her head moved and I looked down.
[1:56:15] And if I live a hundred years,
[1:56:18] I'll never forget those big dark eyes
[1:56:22] looked at me.
[1:56:27] That's his wife. And immediately after,
[1:56:29] he's going to his daughter's bedside.
[1:56:33] And he's up beside her bedside. And he
[1:56:35] says, and I said, "Do you know daddy,
[1:56:38] honey?"
[1:56:40] And her little lips trying to speak to
[1:56:43] me like this. goo to me and they were
[1:56:47] quivering.
[1:56:49] She's a dying. I put my hand over on her
[1:56:52] and I said, "Oh, God."
[1:56:54] Same words. "Oh God, please God, don't
[1:56:59] take her. You took my wife.
[1:57:03] You took my daddy and you've took." And
[1:57:06] he broke. "Oh God, isn't there
[1:57:08] forgiveness in your great heart?" I
[1:57:12] said, "Please, dear God, please spare my
[1:57:16] baby."
[1:57:18] I thought, and I said, "Won't you do it,
[1:57:21] Lord?" Just looked like a black sheet
[1:57:25] began to unfold coming down. And oh, I
[1:57:28] knew I knowed she was gone. And I looked
[1:57:32] at her. He said, "Oh my, if I had it to
[1:57:38] live over again, they would never they
[1:57:41] would never be trash."
[1:57:45] See where he went right back to?
[1:57:49] He knew in his heart that God was taking
[1:57:53] these
[1:57:54] his wife and his baby and he's praying,
[1:57:59] "Please forgive me."
[1:58:02] He said, "I'd never, if I could do it
[1:58:04] again,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; I'd never let them be trash."
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; When I read that,
[1:58:12] I'm just Brother Ed Biscll up here
[1:58:14] today, and I know this goes on the
[1:58:16] internet,
[1:58:18] but when I read that, I just thought,
[1:58:22] what kind of hope is there for a person
[1:58:25] like myself?
[1:58:30] the holiness and the justice of God.
[1:58:32] God's not cruel.
[1:58:35] God knows what he's doing.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; And the baby left.
[1:58:42] And he said, "If I had my life to live
[1:58:44] over, I'd never let that be trash."
[1:58:48] Just that one act
[1:58:51] of not going where God opened the door
[1:58:55] and he refused to go and he listened to
[1:58:58] a woman who said they're trash.
[1:59:02] And for that
[1:59:05] you talk about wounded.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; You talk about wounded friends.
[1:59:12] Maybe some of you young people, you
[1:59:14] haven't you haven't stood beside your
[1:59:18] loved ones casket.
[1:59:21] You will someday. And it'll be a sting.
[1:59:26] It'll be a real sting at the separation.
[1:59:30] No matter if you're a believer, they're
[1:59:32] a believer. There'll be a that
[1:59:33] separation. Not necessarily sorrow, but
[1:59:35] there'll be a great wound that'll
[1:59:37] happen.
[1:59:40] And here's a young man just got married.
[1:59:44] He's got his wife
[1:59:47] and he sees her in such agony and she
[1:59:49] goes,
[1:59:51] "I'm not playing on your emotions. I'm
[1:59:53] This is the prophet that God raised up
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; and God let him go through that
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; and his baby is taken from him
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; because he didn't go to the people that
[2:00:05] were called trash by his mother-in-law.
[2:00:10] I don't expect that we will fully
[2:00:12] understand that. But I'm going to say
[2:00:13] this. This was years later. And he tells
[2:00:17] a story and tells it and tells it and
[2:00:20] tells it and it's the same every time.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's real.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's still painful.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said, "If you could only
[2:00:33] do it over again years later, if I could
[2:00:35] only do it over again." you. We all got
[2:00:38] things.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; We all got times. We all got instances
[2:00:43] of and maybe haven't lived long enough.
[2:00:45] But when you come to that time, if I
[2:00:46] could only do it over again.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, he couldn't do it over
[2:00:51] again. You can't do it over again. I
[2:00:54] can't do it over again. But the one
[2:00:55] thing we can do is do what he did. He
[2:00:58] surrendered the whole life to God.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Here I am. Amen.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And he took a message and he took the
[2:01:04] signs of almighty God to the same
[2:01:07] people.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And God got the glory.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; What a life.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; And one of the times when he told life
[2:01:30] story,
[2:01:36] he prays.
[2:01:39] He says, "Oh Christian people," so I'll
[2:01:42] say it to you, "Oh Christian people,
[2:01:46] one of these days I know beyond the
[2:01:50] reach of mortal kin.
[2:01:54] Someday God only knows just where and
[2:01:56] when the wheels of mortal life will all
[2:02:00] stand still."
[2:02:02] Says, "Then I'm going to make a trip up
[2:02:05] to Zion's hill." He says, ' And I've
[2:02:08] tried to live with all my heart, dear
[2:02:12] Jesus, to live for you, to do the thing,
[2:02:15] no matter what this cross is or how
[2:02:18] scornful it seems to be, I love you,
[2:02:22] dear Jesus.
[2:02:24] You've broken my heart over and over,
[2:02:28] but I love you.
[2:02:31] This may be a part of the message, you
[2:02:33] know, that you haven't heard too often,
[2:02:36] but I'm dwelling on it. God's messenger
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; saying in prayer, "Dear Jesus, you've
[2:02:44] broken my heart over and over.
[2:02:48] Not once, not twice, but over and over,
[2:02:51] but I love you."
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; That was the key.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; But I love you.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. and by loving him said I love you
[2:03:00] for it and I pray now dear God that
[2:03:03] you'll help me to fulfill the commission
[2:03:06] that you have given that I might finish
[2:03:09] my course with joy so he looked at what
[2:03:12] was happening what had happened he can't
[2:03:14] change it but I'm looking towards the
[2:03:16] future and that I might finish my race
[2:03:19] with joy Right.
[2:03:32] I don't know.
[2:03:34] The Lord will help me and you help me. I
[2:03:38] got a couple more examples I want to
[2:03:39] give you.
[2:03:41] And the prophet says that you should see
[2:03:45] Christ Jesus in every verse of the
[2:03:47] scripture.
[2:03:49] And here's a man of Job.
[2:03:55] And this this is the progression of his
[2:03:57] wounding. The progression.
[2:04:00] A runner comes. He's lost his
[2:04:02] possessions,
[2:04:04] his animals. Then he lost his servants.
[2:04:10] He lost his children.
[2:04:14] He was in such such grief. He wasn't
[2:04:18] able to speak. And those friends, then
[2:04:20] his friends came. Friends,
[2:04:24] you know, it's amazing how powerful
[2:04:26] friends are.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; You have friends now. His friends came
[2:04:30] and they just sat for seven days cuz
[2:04:33] they couldn't even utter a word.
[2:04:38] His condition was so dismal. And then
[2:04:44] Satan was able and allowed by God to
[2:04:48] afflict his body and he has boils from
[2:04:51] hand from the top of his head to the
[2:04:53] soles of his feet. I'm not just telling
[2:04:55] you a story. I'm not just preaching. I'm
[2:04:57] preaching a real gospel.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; This happened to believers.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; This happened to a man that God could
[2:05:05] God said he's perfect before me.
[2:05:15] You talk about wounded. I thought I
[2:05:18] would have time and I don't have the
[2:05:19] time.
[2:05:21] I haven't lost my children.
[2:05:25] I know sadness in my life.
[2:05:29] And I know a little bit of what I'm
[2:05:31] speaking about. I wouldn't speak about
[2:05:33] what I've gone through. You had brother
[2:05:35] Gary Walker here. We remember his
[2:05:38] testimony.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; You remember it well.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I when I heard that I said I have no
[2:05:44] problems.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have even heard. Do you
[2:05:46] know when you what you heard him what
[2:05:48] you heard here? It was the wound
[2:05:51] speaking.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; It was a man who had been through
[2:05:55] incredible suffering. There is a beyond
[2:05:57] description. Amen.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; And I personally believe that God has
[2:06:01] allowed him to have the infirmities that
[2:06:04] he's had because it's so uh it so
[2:06:07] impacts the listener.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; You hear here's a man not talking about
[2:06:11] his suffering. He is suffering.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; He's having difficulty standing here at
[2:06:16] the And then he brother Tom's going to
[2:06:19] be with him in a in next month as they
[2:06:22] speak together at the Serbia convention
[2:06:24] in Serbia. And I I I can't comprehend
[2:06:27] how a man in his condition can get on
[2:06:29] those planes and travel for 12 and 14
[2:06:32] and 15 hours. I was moved.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't Gary Walker just speaking.
[2:06:39] It was the wound speaking.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; He yielded the wound to God.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; And he told you in sincerity. He stood
[2:06:50] here. He said, "I I come to believe that
[2:06:53] God raised me up because he hated me."
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. "I believe that God
[2:07:00] raised me up and actually let me live so
[2:07:03] he could pour his anger out on me."
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; That's just how far and how low a person
[2:07:09] can get. And yet God was going to
[2:07:11] glorify himself through it.
[2:07:14] Amen.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; And Job finally when he was in this
[2:07:22] terrible state,
[2:07:24] having lost his sons and daughters who
[2:07:27] he had just offered, he offered
[2:07:28] sacrifices for them in case they might
[2:07:31] sin. And here God comes and and allows
[2:07:33] them to be wiped off the map
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; in a day.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; And his cattle is gone. His possessions
[2:07:41] are gone. You talk about an economic
[2:07:43] collapse. He had it. You haven't had it
[2:07:45] like he had it.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Don't get weary with the Sunday morning.
[2:07:51] You may well need what I'm speaking on
[2:07:54] just down the road a short time
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; or might be sooner than you think or you
[2:07:59] might be going through it right now. And
[2:08:01] this is the answer for you.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; And after this incredible wounding, the
[2:08:09] wound spoke. Amen.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't he couldn't say this before
[2:08:13] his wounding, but he could say it after
[2:08:15] the wounding. He said, "Naked came I out
[2:08:19] of my mother's womb,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; and naked shall I return thither." The
[2:08:24] Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
[2:08:27] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't the end of his wounding.
[2:08:32] Listen. Then his friends turned into
[2:08:35] accusers. Yeah.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; And they spend a long time and they
[2:08:39] detailed
[2:08:41] you. You have, you know, you've been
[2:08:45] honored.
[2:08:46] People listen to you. And now look at
[2:08:48] you.
[2:08:50] Look at the state that you're in. And
[2:08:53] they begin to accuse him and tell him
[2:08:56] exactly as the scripture says in in
[2:08:59] Isaiah 53 that the people considered
[2:09:02] Jesus smitten of God. Yes.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; And now Job's friends are telling him
[2:09:07] the same thing. You've been smitten by
[2:09:09] God.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; God's against you.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; And so the wounding continued. It was,
[2:09:16] like I said, it's a progression. But
[2:09:19] then
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; when you get over into the 19th chapter,
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; and he details in the 19th chapter and
[2:09:25] listen what he says. Have you got time?
[2:09:29] Then Job answered, "How long will you
[2:09:32] vex my soul and break me in pieces with
[2:09:35] words?
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; These 10 times have have you reproached
[2:09:40] me, and you've you've and you're not
[2:09:42] ashamed that I make that you make
[2:09:44] yourselves strange to me." No, know now
[2:09:48] that God hath overthrown me. Said, "It's
[2:09:51] not you. God has overthrown me and hath
[2:09:55] come past me with his net. Behold, I cry
[2:10:00] out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry
[2:10:04] aloud and there is no judgment. He's
[2:10:06] describing his life. Now, he's
[2:10:08] describing the wound. He said, "He hath
[2:10:11] fenced up my way that I cannot pass. And
[2:10:14] he has set darkness in my path. Heath
[2:10:17] stripped me of my glory and taken the
[2:10:20] crown from my head. Heath destroyed me
[2:10:23] on every side, and I'm gone. And mine
[2:10:26] hope hath he removed like a tree. He
[2:10:29] hath also kindled his wrath against me,
[2:10:32] and he counted me unto him as one of his
[2:10:35] enemies. What a prayer.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Look how low he got. God has counted me
[2:10:40] as one of his enemies. His troops came
[2:10:44] together and raise up their way against
[2:10:47] me and encamp around about my
[2:10:49] tabernacle. He hath put my brethren far
[2:10:52] from me, and mine acquaintances are
[2:10:55] verily and strange to me. My kins folks
[2:10:58] have failed, and my familiar friends
[2:11:01] have forgotten me. They that dwell in my
[2:11:04] house, and my maids count me as a
[2:11:07] stranger, and I'm an alien in their
[2:11:10] sight. I called my servant and he gave
[2:11:13] me no answer. I intreated him with my
[2:11:15] mouth. My breath is strange to my wife,
[2:11:18] though I entreated her for the
[2:11:20] children's sake of mine own body. Yay,
[2:11:23] young children despised me. I arose and
[2:11:27] they spake against me. All my inward all
[2:11:30] my inward friends abhored me, and they
[2:11:33] whom I loved are turned against me. My
[2:11:36] bone cleaveth to my skin and to my
[2:11:39] flesh, and I'm escaped with the skin of
[2:11:41] my teeth. Have pity upon me. Have pity
[2:11:45] upon me, oh ye my friends, for the hand
[2:11:48] of God has touched me. Why do you
[2:11:51] persecute me as God? Are you not
[2:11:54] satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my
[2:11:57] words were now written. Oh, that they
[2:12:00] were printed in a book,
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; that they were graven with an iron pen
[2:12:05] and led in the rock forever. For I know
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; my redeemer liveth
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; that he shall stand at the latter day
[2:12:15] upon the earth at after the after his
[2:12:18] own description of the vile uh way that
[2:12:22] he been treated in the life and now God
[2:12:24] allowed it.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; True. I know
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; he couldn't say that before and he never
[2:12:33] did say it before. Who's speaking?
[2:12:35] What's speaking? The wound is speaking.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; He could only say it after he was
[2:12:43] wounded. I know my redeemer liveth.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; And at the last time, the last day, he
[2:12:52] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[2:12:54] earth. And though after my skin worms
[2:12:58] destroy this body, yet at my flesh shall
[2:13:02] I see God.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Have I weirded you out?
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Been a long time. There just one more
[2:13:12] thing. I'm going to lay most of this
[2:13:14] aside.
[2:13:36] All right.
[2:13:42] How many ever heard of the five young
[2:13:45] men that went as missionaries to the AA
[2:13:47] Indians?
[2:13:51] How many have heard it here?
[2:14:02] There was a
[2:14:08] five young men,
[2:14:10] Jim Elliott. These are young men from
[2:14:13] the states. Jim Elliott, Nate Saint, Ed
[2:14:17] McCauley, Peter Fleming, and Roger
[2:14:22] uh Udorian Udurian, I believe it is.
[2:14:26] They go to Ecuador to bring the
[2:14:29] gospel to a most primitive and violent
[2:14:32] tribe called the Aka Indians. I'm not
[2:14:35] saying their original name, but that's
[2:14:38] what they were known as. In September
[2:14:41] 1955, this just a year after less than a
[2:14:45] year after my wife and I were married,
[2:14:49] they began flying over the area where
[2:14:51] the tribes people were.
[2:14:56] And they would they began dropping gifts
[2:14:58] so they could exchange gifts.
[2:15:02] And after several months of giving gifts
[2:15:06] on January the 3rd, 1956,
[2:15:09] January the 3rd, they set up a little uh
[2:15:13] established little camp on a river
[2:15:16] called the Kurar River.
[2:15:20] And they had a little plane that they
[2:15:22] were flying over and dropping these
[2:15:24] gifts.
[2:15:26] And this was just a few miles from the
[2:15:28] AA settlement.
[2:15:31] Just five days later, they were only on
[2:15:33] the sandbar five days. Five days later,
[2:15:36] all five of the young men were attacked
[2:15:39] and speared by a group of Aka warriors,
[2:15:43] killing all five of them.
[2:15:46] The news of their deaths was broadcast
[2:15:49] around the world. Of course, we heard it
[2:15:51] even up in northern British Columbia
[2:15:53] right away.
[2:15:55] And they said that it the life magazine
[2:15:59] carried a whole pictorial section of
[2:16:02] these young men. They said it literally
[2:16:05] galvanized
[2:16:06] the evang evangelistic fervor
[2:16:11] all over the earth. Just the lives of
[2:16:14] these five young men.
[2:16:17] the one his wife Elizabeth Elliott and
[2:16:21] she was a wife of Jim
[2:16:24] and the sister of Nate Saint her name is
[2:16:27] Rachel
[2:16:28] and Jim Elliot was born in Portland
[2:16:32] and the airplane they've just discovered
[2:16:34] it was buried in the sand and uh and
[2:16:38] they they got the main frame the
[2:16:39] structure out from the sand the warriors
[2:16:42] they buried the airplane
[2:16:45] and it is now in the first first city
[2:16:49] that my wife and I were in in special
[2:16:52] meetings in Nampa, Idaho, and the
[2:16:54] airplane is restored there in a in a
[2:16:57] museum now. But uh
[2:17:01] uh Elizabeth Elliott,
[2:17:03] wife of Jim and Rachel Saint, who's the
[2:17:06] sister of Nate Saint, they returned
[2:17:08] directly returned to Ecuador.
[2:17:13] And they gave years of their lives to
[2:17:15] the AA people and to the very warriors
[2:17:19] that killed the missionaries.
[2:17:22] And I've seen a picture of one one of
[2:17:24] them who actually speared the boys has
[2:17:28] become a Christian because of their
[2:17:31] efforts. There was no no way to get the
[2:17:34] gospel to these pe people, primitive and
[2:17:37] violent people. No way. And these two
[2:17:41] women and particularly Elizabeth
[2:17:44] Elliott,
[2:17:45] she she wrote a language, wrote uh
[2:17:50] letters and gave an alphabet to their
[2:17:54] tribal language so that they could read
[2:17:58] that, learn that, and then translate the
[2:18:01] Bible into that language so they could
[2:18:04] hear the gospel. Now, I tell you what,
[2:18:07] friends, I'm talking about a wound.
[2:18:10] There's a woman that loses her husband,
[2:18:12] another one that loses her brother, and
[2:18:15] they decide they're not just going to
[2:18:17] live at home and take flowers to a grave
[2:18:19] site once a year.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; You're quiet, but you'll remember this
[2:18:27] service.
[2:18:29] They decided, we're going to give our
[2:18:31] lives.
[2:18:33] And if you went on the website and and
[2:18:36] about Elizabeth Elliott or Betty
[2:18:39] Elliott, but she lived there for years
[2:18:43] and brought the gospel to those people.
[2:18:46] And that was the that was the first time
[2:18:48] they'd ever heard about Jesus Christ.
[2:18:51] And that same woman came with her father
[2:18:55] and traveled through British Columbia
[2:18:57] and landed in Dawson Creek and spoke in
[2:19:01] the church that I was pastoring. I had
[2:19:03] her give a testimony. And so I met Betty
[2:19:06] Elliott and her father after this
[2:19:10] terrible time. And I think she was on
[2:19:11] her way to Alaska.
[2:19:15] There was there was a lot of hurt.
[2:19:18] There's a lot of a lot of pain.
[2:19:21] There was a lot of separation.
[2:19:26] And yes, the whole world could get all
[2:19:28] enthused, excited about it. But there
[2:19:30] was somebody who said, and this is my
[2:19:33] point of my message, somebody said, "I'm
[2:19:36] gonna make a difference. I'm gonna do
[2:19:39] something with this pain."
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to surrender it
[2:19:42] to God. I'm going to let it I'm going to
[2:19:46] let it do something for God. Now, these
[2:19:48] are outstanding. These are I only give
[2:19:50] them as an examples. I want to say to
[2:19:53] this church,
[2:19:56] we can do more. Amen.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about offerings. I'm not
[2:20:00] talking about money. I'm talking about
[2:20:02] you, your life, your time.
[2:20:06] We're not here on a on a vacation.
[2:20:10] We're not here on a holiday. We're not
[2:20:14] here, as brother Brandham says, on a
[2:20:15] picnic. I believe that we have we have
[2:20:19] whatever health and life and strength
[2:20:21] God has given you. Your first call is
[2:20:25] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's your first call. And whatever
[2:20:30] resources God puts in your hand. That is
[2:20:33] for the use of the gospel of Jesus
[2:20:35] Christ. And the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:20:38] is for husbands to feed their families.
[2:20:40] That's and that that's all that's all
[2:20:43] part of the gospel. So I'm not talking
[2:20:45] about offering. I'm not talking about
[2:20:46] money. I'm just saying to you, don't
[2:20:49] waste your life
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; living for yourself.
[2:20:53] Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't waste your life just by
[2:20:56] bettering your own environment.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; That's a total waste.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; There's no reward for that.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Spend your life
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; bettering it for somebody else.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Reach out to somebody else. You can
[2:21:09] speak to someone else. You can send them
[2:21:11] a message book. You can send them a
[2:21:13] message. You can send them a DVD. You
[2:21:15] can do something. You can phone them.
[2:21:17] You can live a witness wherever you are.
[2:21:19] But live your life for someone else.
[2:21:21] This this life and brother Tom mentioned
[2:21:24] in his last service I believe it is so
[2:21:26] self-centered. You know what it does? It
[2:21:29] makes us impotent
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; because our whole world is around me and
[2:21:35] mine and this and all only things that
[2:21:38] concern me or make me happy or make life
[2:21:40] easier for me. We're not here to have an
[2:21:43] easy life.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; We're here as laborers in the kingdom of
[2:21:48] God.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; I was just doing a little bit. I needed
[2:22:01] to do a little bit of kind of look back
[2:22:06] because of some comments that were made.
[2:22:07] decided to look back and my my wife
[2:22:10] carries a little Hallmark calendar in
[2:22:12] her purse and just you know just make a
[2:22:16] little note on the date where this that
[2:22:18] the other thing and where we are and
[2:22:20] whatever more
[2:22:22] and I know that you you've known that
[2:22:24] I've traveled a lot
[2:22:26] but in the last 10 years I preached 77
[2:22:31] conventions
[2:22:33] in the last 10 years and I don't regret
[2:22:36] it at I wouldn't want to do it again,
[2:22:39] but I don't regret it at all.
[2:22:42] I think that if we allowed if God opened
[2:22:44] I couldn't do that if God hadn't opened
[2:22:46] the door and you people made it possible
[2:22:48] and and tolerated it and everything
[2:22:50] else. But and and and yet I I feel I I'm
[2:22:55] so
[2:22:56] humbled and humiliated. But brother
[2:22:59] Brandham here here here the one that's
[2:23:01] beside him is going to take him beyond
[2:23:03] the curtain of time. And he has just put
[2:23:05] his hand behind his head and said,
[2:23:07] "Well, Bill Brandham," and these were
[2:23:08] his words to me. "Well, Bill Brandham,
[2:23:11] you're 52,
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; and if you're going to do anything for
[2:23:15] God, you better get going."
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; When he said that, I felt about a
[2:23:21] quarter of an inch high.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; And I still feel the same way. But
[2:23:30] whatever we've been given,
[2:23:32] you're going to meet people that I and
[2:23:35] the rest here aren't going to meet. And
[2:23:37] God's going to give you an opportunity.
[2:23:39] And maybe you won't be able to say word.
[2:23:41] I've got neighbors. I feel terrible. I
[2:23:44] haven't had a real good solid chance to
[2:23:47] witness. I have spoken to them a wee bit
[2:23:50] from time to time but you know it's just
[2:23:52] been kind of a general never been able
[2:23:54] to really get to the subject and I feel
[2:23:56] terrible about that but one thing they
[2:24:00] see our car go out to church they know
[2:24:03] that we are believers they know that we
[2:24:05] are Christians and we don't hesitate the
[2:24:07] lady across the street her husband died
[2:24:09] here a short time ago and I went over
[2:24:12] and told her that we will pray for her
[2:24:13] and remember her and she was very
[2:24:15] touched the the the musician, the
[2:24:18] well-known musician, uh Robbie Bachmann,
[2:24:21] his wife died at 29 years old from
[2:24:24] cancer. And I I told him about the
[2:24:27] healing and I told him about the
[2:24:28] ministry and told him how God heals
[2:24:31] those things and and he tapped my hand
[2:24:34] and he was touched. He said, "Well,
[2:24:36] thank you. We I don't know. Oh, I I wish
[2:24:39] we had better opportunities. But
[2:24:41] whatever opportunity God gives us,
[2:24:43] whether by speaking or by living it,
[2:24:46] your actions are louder here on earth
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; than any word that you could speak. And
[2:24:52] our testimony and our actions should be
[2:24:55] exactly exactly the same.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; And whatever you have gone through,
[2:24:59] whatever you've suffered, whatever
[2:25:01] you've experienced, I want this to be an
[2:25:03] announcement.
[2:25:05] Let God take that and use it for his
[2:25:10] glory.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:31] I really mean that.
[2:25:34] I really mean that.
[2:25:37] Don't Don't let
[2:25:41] Don't let the present economic
[2:25:43] conditions
[2:25:44] swallow you up.
[2:25:49] Don't let any
[2:25:51] between yourself, your family, your
[2:25:54] friends. Don't let that swallow you up.
[2:25:57] Set your sight for the kingdom and set
[2:26:00] your sight. We only have this one time,
[2:26:02] friends.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; We only have this one time. And I it it
[2:26:07] is as though today I I really felt I
[2:26:09] just felt like, you know, throwing the
[2:26:12] gauntlet down and saying,
[2:26:14] you know, you young fellas, you need to
[2:26:19] set yourself aside, give yourself in
[2:26:22] prayer and find out what God wants you
[2:26:24] to do.
[2:26:29] If you do that, you'll never never
[2:26:32] regret it.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; And on the other side, if you do that,
[2:26:38] you'll come on the other side and you'll
[2:26:40] give me a hug
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; for saying that.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. You'll never
[2:26:46] regret it.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; And things that you desire in your
[2:26:50] heart, God God knows those desires.
[2:26:54] young men, young ladies. I say young
[2:26:56] because
[2:26:58] you've got some youth, you've got some
[2:27:00] energy, you've got some future if God
[2:27:02] allows us to have some future.
[2:27:07] I'm sorry for I've taken so much time
[2:27:09] and yet I can't apologize because this
[2:27:12] this has just been gripping and and we
[2:27:15] have lots of testimonies here in the
[2:27:17] congregation of people who've given
[2:27:19] themselves unreservedly and it it really
[2:27:22] speaks to me. I'm thankful for what
[2:27:25] you've done, Brother Richard. You're
[2:27:27] you're just one I don't want to set you,
[2:27:30] you know,
[2:27:32] Brother Richard Drake has just quietly
[2:27:35] he just worked for God. He's a bus
[2:27:37] driver.
[2:27:38] You know, he's in charge of, you know,
[2:27:41] scheduling or something. I don't know
[2:27:42] what it is. All I know is that when some
[2:27:46] kids and some people in some orphanages
[2:27:49] need something, he managed to get some
[2:27:50] of your sisters together and sort out
[2:27:53] clothes and away they go over there. You
[2:27:55] don't know what that means to them. They
[2:27:57] say, "There's some real Christians."
[2:28:01] I believe we can do something.
[2:28:03] Brother, I'm closing right now with
[2:28:05] this. Brother Murphy stood up and
[2:28:09] preached in Switzerland. And
[2:28:11] Switzerland's probably listening right
[2:28:13] now, Sunday evening. And the brother of
[2:28:16] whom I'm speaking who just emailed me a
[2:28:19] few days ago. I would expect they listen
[2:28:22] every Sunday.
[2:28:25] And you're probably listening, Brother
[2:28:27] Daniel.
[2:28:29] But it spoke to my heart and I haven't
[2:28:31] answered him yet.
[2:28:33] Brother Murphy preached and I sat
[2:28:36] behind. You may think that your heart is
[2:28:39] spoken to. You may think that you know
[2:28:41] you're gripped. I was so gripped.
[2:28:45] I was so humbled when brother Murphy was
[2:28:48] done. I felt I cannot add anything to
[2:28:51] this. And I just came and there was a
[2:28:54] nice audience of people and I just came
[2:28:56] to the pulpit, leaned over the pulpit
[2:28:58] and I yelled out, "Do something
[2:29:07] and close the service."
[2:29:10] And this brother, he owns a factory.
[2:29:14] He's a businessman.
[2:29:17] He is so occupied.
[2:29:20] But he wrote me an email and he said,
[2:29:23] "You know, you spoke at that service and
[2:29:27] and we spoke together and about doing
[2:29:29] something. There's there's so much that
[2:29:33] could be done and we spoke about the hub
[2:29:36] and we spoke about all these things. I
[2:29:37] tell you what, friends, there's just so
[2:29:39] much that can be done and brother uh
[2:29:42] Timothy Andes and and working under
[2:29:45] brother John's direction, but they got
[2:29:48] all the people together and I understand
[2:29:51] about 35% of this congregation is
[2:29:54] meeting to put the messages up on the
[2:29:57] hub. When I talk about message of the
[2:29:59] hub, I'm talking about a prophet's
[2:30:01] message
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; reaching people all around the world.
[2:30:05] And I I'm I don't have some, you know,
[2:30:08] uh strange kink about that. I am
[2:30:10] absolutely obsessed with it.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; And why wouldn't we be?
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; If you could get somebody else to hear
[2:30:16] it and someone else to experience what
[2:30:18] you're experiencing, wouldn't that be a
[2:30:19] thrill?
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Absolutely a thrill.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I spoke to you and I said,
[2:30:25] I want to and I still do." And life is
[2:30:27] empty.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Life is empty without that focus.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will grab that.
[2:30:34] Thank you for your
[2:30:36] kind attention.
[2:30:39] If you bow your head, would you stand
[2:30:40] with me, please?
[2:30:58] Dear loving Lord Jesus,
[2:31:03] the one that walked up Calvar's hill,
[2:31:07] the one whose visage was so marred more
[2:31:10] than that of any man.
[2:31:13] And then the as your prophet and servant
[2:31:16] describes
[2:31:18] describes it in such detail
[2:31:20] it was difficult for me to read.
[2:31:24] I couldn't hardly comprehend
[2:31:26] the suffering and the wounding that you
[2:31:28] went through.
[2:31:30] And Lord, it was not just for that,
[2:31:35] but it was that a life that a a an
[2:31:39] experience could come, that a voice
[2:31:42] could come. And I want to testify here
[2:31:45] today in public. I've heard that voice.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; I heard that call.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; The people that are standing here, oh
[2:31:52] God, many of them have heard that call.
[2:31:56] Some perhaps have not heard that call.
[2:31:58] But even even this morning, you've
[2:32:01] allowed the words to escape my lips,
[2:32:04] Lord, and go directly by the Holy Spirit
[2:32:07] to their hearts. And I will not close
[2:32:09] the service, oh God, until you are done
[2:32:12] dealing with every heart and every life.
[2:32:15] Lord, perhaps there is someone that
[2:32:17] needs to surrender their upset and to
[2:32:20] surrender their reversals and not allow
[2:32:24] them to be overcome by it. Oh God, I
[2:32:27] pray they will shake themselves and
[2:32:29] realize this is the only life. This is
[2:32:31] the only time. This is the only chance
[2:32:33] that we have. I pray, Father, that as we
[2:32:36] speak about the eminent uh rapture and
[2:32:39] the and and the receiving of Christ,
[2:32:42] Christ receiving us, Lord, if we are
[2:32:44] really believing that, how much more we
[2:32:47] want to uh use up and and and redeem the
[2:32:50] time. Father, I pray that you will
[2:32:53] impress this people as you have
[2:32:55] impressed me. Deal with them, Lord, as
[2:32:58] you've dealt with my own heart. I pray,
[2:33:00] oh God, I call on you by the Holy
[2:33:03] Spirit. Father, I pray that we will use
[2:33:06] every opportunity, every opportunity
[2:33:10] that comes our way to to uh further the
[2:33:13] kingdom of God here locally, Lord, in
[2:33:16] its own church, Father, the school, the
[2:33:19] camp, or whatever more. We do it for
[2:33:21] your glory. We do it, oh God, not for
[2:33:24] our enjoyment. We do it that you might
[2:33:26] touch somebody. We can do it, Lord, that
[2:33:28] we might get one last seed. Lord, we're
[2:33:31] pushing the boat out. We're calling
[2:33:34] people to come in. Come into this boat
[2:33:37] and don't get it caught in this raging
[2:33:39] torrent of time. And the people, Lord,
[2:33:41] the way that they're going, how sad it
[2:33:44] is, Lord, going headlong to destruction.
[2:33:47] Don't let our young people be caught up
[2:33:49] in that. Oh God, don't let them get
[2:33:51] caught up with the the entertainment and
[2:33:54] and the things that simply brth bring a
[2:33:56] thrill to this flesh. Oh God, may we
[2:33:59] cast down. For they that live after the
[2:34:01] flesh shall die, but they that live
[2:34:03] after the spirit shall live. Oh, Father,
[2:34:06] in the name of Jesus, in the name of
[2:34:09] Jesus, call I pray. I pray, oh God.
[2:34:14] Pray, oh God, that you'll do so this
[2:34:17] Sunday afternoon. Father, in Jesus name,
[2:34:20] speak, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. I
[2:34:24] wonder if we could have that chorus,
[2:34:27] Brother Ryan. Speak my Lord. Speak my
[2:34:29] Lord. and I will I'll be quick to answer
[2:34:32] thee. Could you help me, brother Derek?
