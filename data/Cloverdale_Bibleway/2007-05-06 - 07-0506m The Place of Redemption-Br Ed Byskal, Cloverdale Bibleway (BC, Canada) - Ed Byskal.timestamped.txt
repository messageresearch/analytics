[10:03] how much more could he create a clean

[10:07] we can approach him pure and undefiled.
[10:12] Let's stand this morning saying, "Be it
[10:14] unto me according to thy word and even
[10:18] even as we heard brother Ed speaking
[10:20] these last weeks."
[10:23] And then Mary said the right thing. Her
[10:25] faith just reached up and that scripture
[10:27] was sitting there. Amen. Behold, a
[10:30] virgin shall conceive.
[10:32] Just a simple faith brought about the
[10:34] word of God. Amen. We want to just have
[10:37] the faith this morning. Say the right
[10:39] thing. Amen. God can use that.
[10:48] Be it unto me
[10:53] according to your word.
[10:59] according to your promises.
[11:03] [Music]
[11:06] I can stand
[11:09] [Music]
[11:11] upon my heart.
[11:16] The truth that sets me free
[11:21] according to
[11:24] your word
[11:29] to me.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me.
[11:33] [Music]
[11:36] Oh Lord,
[11:38] according to your word,
[11:43] according to your promises,
[11:49] I
[11:59] the truth that sets me
[12:05] according to your word.
[12:09] [Music]
[12:14] Sing it one more time as brother John
[12:16] Andy's if you'd come and lead us in
[12:17] prayer. Be it unto me
[12:24] according to your word,
[12:29] according to your promises,
[12:35] I can stand
[12:37] [Music]
[12:41] upon
[12:43] [Music]
[12:45] the truth that is me.
[12:53] [Music]
[13:00] I wonder what's on your heart this
[13:02] morning. I wonder if we could just open
[13:04] up our lives and open up our mouths and
[13:06] just worship him.
[13:09] Whatever's on our hearts, whatever's
[13:11] there, let's just express it to him.
[13:15] Oh father, there's many altars here this
[13:17] morning. There's many sacrifices,
[13:20] living sacrifices.
[13:23] Oh God, we want to die to ourselves at
[13:25] the start of this meeting. Lord, we want
[13:27] to let our own thoughts go. Lord, we
[13:30] want to let our own fleshly beings,
[13:32] Lord, just lay ourselves upon that
[13:34] place, that sacred place. This is your
[13:37] house. We're approaching the throne of
[13:40] your word, God. And your presence is
[13:42] here. You are here this morning to
[13:45] listen to the desires that we have. And
[13:48] Lord Jesus, may you come and consume
[13:51] every life, every need, every situation,
[13:55] every issue. Lord, our hands are lifted
[13:57] up. Oh Jesus, Lord, how we desire to see
[14:01] your glory and we invite your presence
[14:04] into this meeting right now. We invite
[14:07] your sacredness, Lord, to come by every
[14:10] heart, every need, every situation. We
[14:14] lift up our hands, Lord, as the least
[14:16] that we can do. Our hearts, Lord, the
[14:19] very least, our reasonable service, oh
[14:22] God, as to speak your name and to
[14:24] worship you, God. Father, we are not
[14:27] just here to receive, but we are here to
[14:30] give out and to worship. open up our
[14:33] mouths to let you know that we love you
[14:37] and we need you, God. We need you this
[14:40] morning, Lord Jesus.
[14:43] Come out of history.
[14:46] Come off of a book, Lord. Come out of
[14:50] just quotes, Lord Jesus. Be real to us
[14:53] today, God. We long for you. We thirst
[14:58] after you to see your glory and have
[15:02] that reality. God, we want to touch you
[15:05] this morning, Jesus.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, Lord, let there be a death to
[15:19] us, oh God. Let there be a death to
[15:22] every life.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Stir us again, God.
[15:27] Let your spirit move in our souls, Lord.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Let nothing stand in the way, God.
[15:35] Forgive us of our sin. Forgive us of our
[15:38] iniquities, God. Anything that would
[15:41] stand in the way, let the blood be rich,
[15:44] oh God. There's a message being
[15:46] delivered. And there's blood all over
[15:48] it, God. There's life, there's truth,
[15:51] there's deliverance, there's salvation,
[15:54] there's healing, God.
[15:57] Lord, we just want you to be free to do
[15:59] whatever's on your heart, God. And we
[16:02] don't want to stand in the way. We don't
[16:03] want any flesh to stand in the way,
[16:06] Lord. May you do, Lord, more than we
[16:10] could even ask or think, God. And may
[16:13] you just move this whole day, this
[16:15] morning, this afternoon, and tonight,
[16:17] Lord. We are here as your people
[16:19] recognizing that you are doing something
[16:22] in your word and in our lives. And we
[16:24] want to submit to that totally. We want
[16:27] to give ourselves totally to what you're
[16:29] doing in every life, Lord. And if we
[16:32] need to pull for one another, if we need
[16:34] to pull for the one next to us, there's
[16:37] needs. There's lives, Lord. We are a
[16:39] needy people. So would you just move
[16:41] from heart to heart to life to life and
[16:44] let there be such a presence and your
[16:47] word be so rich to us God. We are
[16:50] looking to your word and to that voice.
[16:53] Minister today and pastor our souls and
[16:57] shepherd us Lord in places that only you
[17:00] can have your way today and be
[17:03] glorified. And let us be sensitive God.
[17:06] Let us as your people, God, be
[17:08] sensitive, Lord, knowing that there is a
[17:10] beat, the composer, Lord, that's put out
[17:12] the sheet music. There is a definite
[17:15] order to what you would have for us,
[17:17] God, in that spiritual realm where all
[17:20] things are possible. So be glorified
[17:23] today and show yourself, Lord, in areas
[17:26] and we'll give you glory and honor
[17:29] through our lives in Jesus name.
[17:34] Amen.
[17:36] according to your word,
[17:42] according to your promises.

[18:17] Amen.
[18:20] Praise the Lord.
[18:24] We are standing
[18:27] [Music]
[18:30] on
[18:32] ground
[18:37] and I know that there are angels
[18:45] around
[18:48] all around
[18:51] afraid

[19:50] We are standing in his presence.
[19:56] [Music]
[19:59] &gt;&gt; We are standing.
[20:02] Oh, we are standing
[20:08] on holy
[20:10] ground.
[20:14] And I know that there are angels

[20:32] Jesus
[20:37] [Music]
[20:40] stand.
[20:41] [Music]
[20:48] &gt;&gt; What if we could sing it with just our
[20:49] voices? You know, we don't need a camp
[20:51] meeting.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; We don't need a special speaker.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; We just need Christ to come down this
[20:56] morning. Amen.
[20:58] And if he could fill the temple with his
[20:59] glory in Solomon's day, then he can come
[21:02] this morning
[21:04] &gt;&gt; and fill our hearts. Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; And as the preaching of the word goes
[21:08] forth, he can come down and touch your
[21:11] need from that cloud. Maybe just a
[21:14] lightning strike and clear out all
[21:17] whatever we'd have on our hearts.
[21:19] Consume the altar this morning.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it once more.
[21:24] We are standing
[21:28] [Music]
[21:33] ground
[21:37] and I know that there are angels
[21:45] all around.
[21:51] Let us pray. Jesus.
[21:59] Now

[22:08] [Music]
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jeremy Wner has a special

[22:19] seats.
[22:25] Number 257. Surely the presence of the
[22:27] Lord is in this place.
[22:31] And if you don't know it, the words are,
[22:32] "Surely the presence of the Lord is in
[22:34] this place."
[22:36] I can feel his mighty power and his
[22:37] grace.
[22:39] I can hear the brush of angels wings. I
[22:42] see glory on each face. Surely the
[22:45] presence of the Lord is in this place.
[22:48] [Music]
[22:50] Surely
[22:52] the presence
[22:55] of the Lord
[22:57] is in this place.
[23:00] I can feel his mighty power
[23:05] and his praise.
[23:10] I can hear the rush of angels wings. I
[23:15] see glory.
[23:19] Surely
[23:22] the rest
[23:24] of the

[23:48] I can hear the rush of angels.
[23:52] as he glor.
[23:56] [Music]
[24:38] I want to present the life of Christ.
[24:44] It's my aim today.
[24:49] For in his image I want to stand
[24:55] so blameless on that day.
[25:01] And though this world may criticize,
[25:06] it will never
[25:08] understand
[25:10] [Music]
[25:13] that I can't rest until I be a perfect
[25:20] man.
[25:26] What are you going to present to the
[25:30] Lord at the end
[25:33] of your journey?
[25:37] He's not going to be touched by anything
[25:41] save his
[25:44] testimony.
[25:48] What are you going to present to the
[25:52] Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry.
[25:59] Don't be found in that position
[26:03] where you
[26:05] [Music]
[26:07] will be wondering why.
[26:14] Though the world may offer its pleasure
[26:18] and peace and luxurious
[26:22] life of ease,
[26:25] but it simply cannot continue on for man
[26:32] just like a breeze.
[26:36] A moment here and a moment gone. Like a
[26:42] flower, they fade away.
[26:45] [Music]
[26:48] But I just want to stay right on till
[26:53] that perfect day.
[27:06] [Music]
[27:18] Take rest my soul in no other arms. Save
[27:24] Jesus
[27:26] on today.
[27:29] For he has opened my eyes to see that
[27:34] judgement is on its way.
[27:40] And though 10,000 fall at my side, I
[27:45] will never be tossed aside.
[27:51] For in the shadow of that mighty rock is
[27:56] where I'll abide.
[28:01] [Music]
[28:03] What are you going to present to the
[28:07] Lord at the end
[28:10] of your journey?
[28:14] He's not going to be touched by anything
[28:18] save his
[28:20] testimony.
[28:22] [Music]
[28:24] What are you going to present to the
[28:28] Lord? I hope it makes you sigh
[28:32] and cry.
[28:34] Don't be found in that position
[28:39] where you
[28:43] will be wondering why.
[28:46] [Music]
[28:49] Lord, take thy word, thy precious word,
[28:54] and anoint it to my soul.
[29:00] Perfect what is lacking in my faith, and
[29:05] make thy servant whole.
[29:10] Drive all fears and all doubts away. For
[29:15] I just want to hear you say,
[29:20] "Receive,
[29:22] receive thy crown, my beloved son. You
[29:27] have overcome.
[29:31] [Music]
[29:33] Well done."
[29:39] So, what are you going to present to the
[29:42] Lord at the end? end of your journey.
[29:48] [Music]
[29:49] He's not going to be touched by anything
[29:54] save his
[29:56] testimony.
[29:58] Oh, what are you going to present to the
[30:03] Lord? I hope it makes you sigh
[30:07] and cry.
[30:10] Don't be found in that position.
[30:14] where you
[30:16] [Music]
[30:18] will be wondering why.
[30:23] Oh,
[30:25] don't be found in that position

[35:52] &gt;&gt; and he can only do supernatural things.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Are you needing something supernatural?
[35:57] Amen. We're standing in a good place. I
[36:01] had just written. We're standing on holy
[36:03] ground. I just finished written the
[36:05] line, writing the line. My pen was just
[36:09] leaving the paper. And I heard brother
[36:11] Jonathan and you as a congregation start
[36:14] to sing. We're standing on holy ground.
[36:15] I said, "That must be it. That's where
[36:18] we are today." Amen. We're in a good
[36:20] place. Don't you agree? Hallelujah.
[36:24] Amen. And so, uh, I mustn't forget to
[36:27] give you greetings from Brother Tom. He
[36:29] sent an email especially to have me
[36:31] greet you. Amen. Why don't we why don't
[36:35] we just sing that again? We're standing
[36:36] on holy ground. I can't get it out of my
[36:38] mind, so I might as well sing it.
[36:41] Hallelujah. We're having baptismal
[36:43] tonight also. That's special. Four or
[36:46] five young people being baptized.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; When they ask, then they're ready. And
[36:52] and sometime when you think they you see
[36:55] them come to the tank, just remember
[36:57] that's not something on the spur of the
[36:59] moment. The one one of the young people
[37:01] been asking for two years for baptism
[37:05] and then uh brother John has spent time
[37:08] with all of these people that are going
[37:10] to be baptized and we're thankful for
[37:12] that. One of the sisters that was going
[37:15] to be baptized been coming now for a
[37:17] number of weeks. Sister Leanne Dere has
[37:20] been bringing her Enga I believe her
[37:23] name is and uh I met we prayed with her
[37:26] here two three weeks ago. She's in the
[37:29] hospital and we uh she's unable to she
[37:33] was supposed to be baptized tonight at
[37:35] 83 years old. Uh and brother John was in
[37:40] visiting her. It's remarkable how God
[37:42] does things. Uh, brother Ba and sister
[37:45] Anne will be especially interested in
[37:48] this. They were visiting. Brother John
[37:51] was visiting this sister Eningga and
[37:54] then they needed to tend to her so he
[37:56] just stepped to another bed. There was a
[37:58] man laying there and it's brother Ed
[38:01] Bergman,
[38:03] brother Bergman's son. And he was a
[38:06] minister up in White Horse years ago and
[38:09] he's actually dying with cancer. He's
[38:11] been given a short time. You might want
[38:14] to go and visit him. He has leukemia and
[38:17] he has got a short time to live. And I
[38:20] thought it was so remarkable, you know,
[38:22] that someone from the congregation here
[38:24] goes to see
[38:26] uh a sister that's going to be baptized
[38:28] to be with her and pray with her and
[38:30] just steps over to another bed. And
[38:32] here's here's an oldtime friend of my
[38:35] own. And in fact, his his brother and
[38:39] sister-in-law stood up at our wedding
[38:42] when I and my wife were married. So
[38:44] that's just how long we've known them
[38:46] and was able to speak with him and pray
[38:48] with him. So,
[38:50] uh, God's ways are not our ways. His
[38:54] thoughts are not our thoughts. And I'm
[38:55] so glad they aren't. They're so high
[38:57] above us. Let's step into that
[39:00] supernatural realm this morning. We're
[39:02] standing on holy ground.
[39:04] We are standing
[39:11] on
[39:13] [Applause]
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] and I know
[39:21] there are angels
[39:25] all around.
[39:31] [Music]
[39:37] Jesus,
[39:39] now we praise you, Lord.
[39:44] We are standing
[39:47] in his presence
[39:50] on
[39:55] our gracious heavenly father, we think
[39:58] of the time that you chose to meet
[40:00] Moses.
[40:02] You attracted him to a burning bush
[40:04] which would not be consumed with the
[40:07] flame. And Lord, we have a flame burning
[40:10] within the bosom of our hearts and
[40:12] souls. And it will not be extinguished.
[40:17] And it does not consume, oh God, itself,
[40:21] in that it does not stop to burn. It's
[40:24] burning today. It was burning last week.
[40:26] It was burning last year. And it'll burn
[40:28] tomorrow. It'll burn until we are swept
[40:31] away in a rapture. Oh flame of God, burn
[40:35] up the dross and the emptiness. Burn up
[40:37] the world. Burn up anything that is not
[40:40] of you. Let this people be a holy
[40:43] people. Separated unto God, sanctified
[40:47] to this gospel. Thank you for your word.
[40:50] Thank you for your message and the
[40:52] messenger that you sent. And Lord, I
[40:54] pray that now as I stand at my post of
[40:57] duty, that you will enable, oh God,
[41:00] these lips and tongue to speak what you
[41:03] would have said. And let the hearts of
[41:06] the people be open. Oh God, I pray,
[41:09] Father, that every hard heart will be
[41:11] turned to a heart of flesh. I pray that
[41:13] you will inscribe with your finger your
[41:16] word and let let the Holy Spirit reveal,
[41:20] I pray, to us what you would have us to
[41:22] know. May this day be a blessed day in
[41:26] your presence in the name of Jesus
[41:28] Christ. And may that name be glorified.
[41:32] Amen.
[41:34] God bless you. While you're standing
[41:36] yet, if you'd like to take your Bibles
[41:39] and turn to First Peter, we're going to
[41:42] read a few scriptures in chapter 1,
[41:46] starting at verse 18.
[41:56] Once again, it's
[42:00] privilege to approach the scripture the
[42:03] service today. And for those of you that
[42:04] have been in the services, excuse me, in
[42:08] the recent weeks,
[42:10] uh, you'll be able to link them
[42:14] together. And I'm going to make some
[42:16] comments right after I've read read the
[42:17] scripture to help you link them
[42:19] together.
[42:20] It's uh, God is just really wanting to
[42:24] minister to us. So, I would ask for your
[42:25] undivided attention and just as little
[42:28] movement as possible. and God will be
[42:32] with us and all of those that are
[42:34] streaming the service today.
[42:37] Starting at verse 18
[42:40] down to verse 23.
[42:43] For as much as you know that you were
[42:46] not redeemed with corruptible things, as
[42:49] silver and gold from your vain
[42:51] conversation,
[42:53] received by tradition from your fathers,
[42:57] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[43:00] of a lamb without blemish and without
[43:02] spot, who verily was fore orained before
[43:05] the foundation of the world, but was
[43:08] manifest in these last times for you,
[43:12] who by him do believe in God that raised
[43:17] him from the dead and gave him glory
[43:21] that your faith and hope might be in
[43:24] God, seeing you have purified your souls
[43:27] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[43:29] unto unfeigned love of the brethren. See
[43:33] that ye love one another with a pure
[43:35] heart fervently, being born again, not
[43:39] of corruptible seed, but of the
[43:41] incorruptible
[43:43] by the word of God, which liveth and
[43:46] abideth forever. Isn't that marvelous?
[43:49] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews, just turn back to Hebrews in
[43:53] the 9th chapter, two verses,
[43:57] 11 and 12. Chapter nine,
[44:01] Hebrews verses 11 and 12.
[44:06] But Christ being come and high priest of
[44:09] good things to come by a greater and
[44:12] more perfect tabernacle,
[44:15] not made with hands, that is to say, not
[44:18] of this building, neither by the blood
[44:21] of goats and calves, but by his own
[44:25] blood. He entered in once into the holy
[44:29] place, having obtained eternal
[44:32] redemption for us. Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats,
[44:38] keeping your thoughts on the scriptures
[44:39] we've just read.
[44:46] The services which we have just spoke
[44:50] and I'll uh draw your attention back to
[44:52] them.
[44:54] spoke a service on anointed for rapture.
[45:01] Another service immediately following
[45:04] the altar of your heart
[45:09] and then a another service following
[45:11] that sanctify the altar.
[45:17] I want to take you on a little journey
[45:20] today
[45:21] and it is the evolving or the unfolding
[45:26] of the
[45:28] word or what the what was in the mind of
[45:32] God, the thought of God and how it has
[45:35] unfolded down through time to the end
[45:39] time to the time that we're in.
[45:44] The anointing for example, it has gone
[45:46] from
[45:48] the first instance being mentioned in
[45:50] the scripture from don't think I'm
[45:53] repetitious now but just to establish it
[45:55] in your mind from Jacob anointing a
[45:58] stone
[46:00] all the way through until the scripture
[46:03] says but the anointing which you have
[46:06] received
[46:07] of him abideth in you. That's a long
[46:13] distance.
[46:14] That's a quantum leap from a man a few
[46:18] thousand years ago pouring oil on a
[46:21] stone to now it coming and developing.
[46:24] But it's the same thought.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; It is an outpouring. And that's why they
[46:28] call it the outpouring of the Holy
[46:30] Spirit. It's something from God being
[46:33] poured out and not onto but into a
[46:37] people. And it's God is transferring
[46:40] something of himself to those people
[46:43] that is needful for them in that age in
[46:46] that time.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And so that is the thought of the
[46:50] anointing. Then we took the altar. The
[46:55] altar was uh the prophet even said there
[46:59] had to be an altar in heaven because
[47:00] there was a sacrifice on it. We'll be
[47:02] speaking about that. But in the in in in
[47:05] in uh w within the human realm there was
[47:09] altars of earth, altars of stone, altars
[47:13] of wood, altars that were altars of
[47:17] brass or they called brazen altar. Some
[47:20] thought it would be perhaps copper.
[47:22] That's irrelevant to us. But there was
[47:24] all different altars. And then we come
[47:27] to the end time and a prophet says the
[47:29] altar is your heart. We've gone a long
[47:32] ways from a pile of dirt and a stone to
[47:36] what's inside the inner man. That will,
[47:39] that resolve, that discernment that it's
[47:41] not up here, it's down here. And it's a
[47:43] place for God. And so when God thought
[47:46] of an altar, he was thinking of what you
[47:49] have, that capacity that you have,
[47:53] that's what God had in his mind.
[47:56] And then
[47:57] naturally when you speak of anointing
[47:59] and you speak of of an altar, then now
[48:02] you want to speak of sacrifice. So I
[48:05] spoke of on the sacrifice and to
[48:07] sanctify the altar in the sacrifices
[48:10] that were on the altar. And we've taken
[48:12] it all away from one that was in the
[48:14] heavens, which we'll speak yet
[48:15] extensively on it today, Lord willing,
[48:18] from a a sacrifice for he was the lamb
[48:21] slain before the foundation of the
[48:24] world. So there was a lamb sacrifice in
[48:27] heaven. And we bring it all the way down
[48:30] until we come to Calvary, which was the
[48:33] consummation.
[48:34] Everything that had been done was to
[48:36] reflect that sacrifice that would be
[48:39] there. He entered in once with his own
[48:41] blood. So it wasn't just at Calvary, but
[48:43] he rose and he entered in once with his
[48:46] own blood to to sanctify a people. And
[48:51] uh as the scripture which we read, not
[48:53] by the blood of bulls and goats, but he
[48:55] entered in once into the holy place,
[48:57] having obtained eternal redemption,
[49:00] eternal redemption for you. And and then
[49:05] in the last age, we come to the last
[49:08] church, the message to the last church
[49:11] age. And the messenger is receiving the
[49:14] message from Jesus Christ himself. And
[49:17] Jesus Christ is saying these things
[49:20] saith the amen, the faithful and true
[49:23] witness, the beginning of the creation
[49:27] of God. Because at Calvary, it was not
[49:29] just a man dying. It was not just blood
[49:32] like you have blood, but it was blood
[49:35] that was newly created by God. He was
[49:38] the beginning of the new creation of
[49:41] God. God by through the words that he
[49:44] spoke through the prophets and those
[49:46] words lodged in the womb of Mary and
[49:50] that was the blood that was flowing in
[49:52] the veins of Jesus Christ was the royal
[49:56] royal seed blood. It was a newly created
[50:00] blood because he came as he came as a
[50:02] result of the spoken word of God and the
[50:05] life that was in him, the life stream,
[50:08] the life force that was in Christ
[50:11] brought the body of the his earth
[50:14] because he was of the earth also. His
[50:16] body was a part of the earth. And so the
[50:19] life that was in him now took this body
[50:22] of clay, this body of flesh, and and
[50:26] caused it to walk precisely according to
[50:29] every word that was written in the
[50:31] scripture. Taking the cursed earth and
[50:34] making it subject to the word of God,
[50:36] taking it to Calvary, spilt the blood,
[50:38] the life was dispersed and came back
[50:41] dawn into the believer. God anointing
[50:44] the believer, transferring into the
[50:46] believer his own life. We say God's life
[50:49] in the individual.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And today I want to take redemption,
[50:57] the place
[50:59] of redemption. When you talk about the
[51:02] anointing, the altar, the sacrifice, all
[51:06] of that would be in vain if it didn't
[51:08] obtain redemption.
[51:14] Redemption.
[51:17] It's a releasing.
[51:20] It's a payment. It's a ransom.
[51:23] It's also a deliverance.
[51:27] It's the price that's been paid.
[51:30] Redemption.
[51:33] It's also to loose one that's bound.
[51:36] If you have any restraints or
[51:38] restrictions and bound in any way, shape
[51:41] or form, God intend that redemption free
[51:45] the individual.
[51:48] Everything in the scripture pointed to
[51:51] redemption.
[51:55] And that is why all
[51:57] the scripture says that all would would
[51:59] dwell upon the earth would worship the
[52:01] beast whose names are not written in the
[52:04] book of life of the lamb slain from the
[52:08] foundation of the world. That's seen in
[52:12] heaven. The lamb slain before the
[52:15] foundation of the world. That scene
[52:17] speaks of redemption
[52:22] in regards to that scripture. Brother
[52:25] Brandham says, "Think of it.
[52:29] Before Jesus was ever born," is where a
[52:32] lot of people, some even in the message
[52:34] get mixed up on this. They ought to read
[52:36] this and just understand it very
[52:38] clearly. Before Jesus, Jesus the man,
[52:40] flesh man was ever born, but that which
[52:43] was in him was God. Before Jesus was
[52:47] ever born, 4,000 years before he came on
[52:49] the earth, and several thousand years
[52:52] before you came on the earth, before you
[52:54] came on the earth, Jesus
[52:58] Jesus before he was born, Jesus in the
[53:01] mind of God, in God's mind, died for the
[53:04] sins of the world. And the book of life
[53:07] was made. And your name was put on that
[53:10] book of life before the foundation of
[53:13] the world.
[53:16] It's not a new name written in heaven
[53:17] like the songwriter wrote and we don't
[53:20] sing it anymore because there's no new
[53:22] name written in heaven. The names were
[53:24] written there when God had the lamb
[53:27] slain before the foundation of the world
[53:29] and your name was written in the book of
[53:31] life, the lamb's book of life.
[53:35] And he said, "And you were there in his
[53:37] attributes. You don't remember it." No,
[53:40] because you're you're you're just a part
[53:43] of his life. You are a part of God when
[53:47] you become a son or daughter of God just
[53:50] as you were a part of your earthly
[53:52] father.
[53:55] So there was a lamb slain before the
[53:57] foundation of the world and prophet said
[54:00] further that if there's no altar of
[54:03] sacrifice and he was taking up a subject
[54:05] because there was a great Bible teacher
[54:07] a theologian by the name of Dr. Smith
[54:10] and this doctor had said that there is
[54:12] no altar of sacrifice. It was an altar
[54:14] of incense in heaven. And brother
[54:16] Brandham just took issue with it over
[54:18] for a moment. He was just saying to the
[54:19] people in case there was any of Dr.
[54:21] Smith's followers that were there, he
[54:23] said there's an altar. If there's no
[54:25] altar of sacrifice in heaven, where is
[54:28] the sacrifice for sin laying? The lamb,
[54:31] he said, then the lamb. He said there
[54:34] has to be a place. There has to be a
[54:37] place. I want this congregation,
[54:41] everyone that has confidence in what I'm
[54:43] saying. There has to be a place where
[54:46] the slaying lamb bloody is laying there
[54:51] and where the blood is
[54:55] can't be a geographical place. It's not
[54:57] a geographical place. It's not a
[55:00] theological place. It's not a doctrine.
[55:04] It's not just a way of of uh belief.
[55:08] It's not theology.
[55:11] But I want to propose to you and suggest
[55:13] to you today
[55:17] that the opening scene in heaven,
[55:22] a lamb slain before the foundation of
[55:25] the world and a book written and
[55:27] individual names are recorded before you
[55:30] ever came, before you were ever thought
[55:32] of.
[55:34] before your mother and father
[55:37] eons and eons ago, God
[55:41] wrote a book.
[55:44] I don't think it's a book like this.
[55:46] Science has brought this kind of a book,
[55:48] but God and and in God's mind and in his
[55:51] thoughts was a lamb was slain. I thought
[55:55] it was curious that when animals were
[55:58] created, there was such a thing as a
[56:00] lamb.
[56:03] And I thought it was really amazing that
[56:06] Adam,
[56:08] Adam who had the the he had the wisdom
[56:12] of God and he named all of the creatures
[56:17] according to their nature. He named them
[56:19] and when that lamb that young one came
[56:22] by he looked at that there's something
[56:26] said that's a lamb that'll be a lamb and
[56:30] he was expressing on earth the god of
[56:33] the earth for he was the made the god of
[56:35] the earth and his father which is god
[56:38] only god only one god only the god of
[56:42] creation and he has a son on earth now
[56:44] with expressing his thoughts and in
[56:47] god's mind was a lamb that had been
[56:49] slain and he knew he knew all things. I
[56:52] have to be careful so I don't get ahead
[56:54] of myself. And here's a lamb that comes
[56:56] now from the creation of the animals.
[56:58] And God's son says, "You're a lamb."
[57:01] And he names it and it would be a lamb.
[57:05] And there was a lamb slain before the
[57:07] foundation of the world.
[57:10] And there was an altar that was there.
[57:12] But now that scene
[57:15] points to the scene of the end. It has
[57:17] to point to a certain focal point, a
[57:21] certain spot.
[57:23] And I suggest that we're living at that
[57:25] place.
[57:28] Sometimes it's hard to comprehend.
[57:31] And so that scene in heaven spoke of
[57:36] this scene in the end. And yet it's
[57:38] vastly different. But the end scene,
[57:42] this end time scene interpreted that
[57:45] one.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; That one reflected to another time. But
[57:49] this one that we are living, we're
[57:51] living in an interpretation
[57:53] of what God had in his thoughts,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; in his mind.
[57:59] So the beginning scene in heaven pointed
[58:02] to the end time. And the scene of the
[58:05] end time reveals the opening scene.
[58:10] God spoke through Isaiah and he said
[58:12] this.
[58:14] You'll have to have your thinking caps
[58:16] on through the service. So just hang on.
[58:19] And if you and if you It's not deep.
[58:22] It's very simple, but there are some
[58:23] things to think about. God said through
[58:26] Isaiah declaring the end from the
[58:29] beginning. Not the beginning to the end,
[58:31] but declaring the end
[58:34] from the beginning. The beginning. God
[58:37] is declaring the end from the beginning.
[58:42] Exactly what I've just said. He's
[58:45] declaring the end seen from what
[58:48] happened in the beginning
[58:50] and from ancient times the things that
[58:53] are not yet done. saying, "My counsel
[58:57] shall stand and I will do all my
[59:00] pleasure."
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; And the people can say amen to that.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; How God's plan unfolds and how it
[59:08] reveals itself in the message Christ is
[59:11] the mystery of God.
[59:14] Brother Brandham said, "Notice now down
[59:18] through the ages, he's been gradually,
[59:21] oh, I love this, gradually letting out
[59:25] this, letting this out, slowly unfolding
[59:29] the mystery through the prophets and
[59:32] through the types expressing himself."
[59:36] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. Slowly,
[59:38] gradually. I'm glad it is gradually. We
[59:41] can hardly get it when it even is
[59:42] gradual.
[59:47] when we say altar,
[59:51] we think of the heart.
[59:55] Now, I I mentioned this last Sunday, but
[59:59] I want to just cause it to cause your
[1:00:02] thoughts to be aroused once again.
[1:00:06] When when the lamb was slain before the
[1:00:09] foundation of the world, it's important
[1:00:10] that I say this. It might not seem
[1:00:12] relative, but it's important. I say it
[1:00:14] because it connects with the rest of the
[1:00:16] what's on my heart.
[1:00:19] There was a sacrifice,
[1:00:22] as I said last Sunday. I don't believe
[1:00:24] it was the same substance of the
[1:00:27] chemistry of the blood that flows in
[1:00:29] your veins today.
[1:00:32] I don't think that there was a chemistry
[1:00:34] of blood as we know blood
[1:00:39] on the altar in heaven.
[1:00:42] What form it was,
[1:00:44] I don't know. And there a lamb slain.
[1:00:47] Well, I don't think there was a physical
[1:00:49] lamb like we see running in the pasture.
[1:00:54] Someone may say, well, it was Jesus
[1:00:55] Christ. Well, no. Jesus Christ wasn't
[1:00:57] born. The man Jesus Christ wasn't born.
[1:01:01] But in God's mind and in his thoughts,
[1:01:04] and I believe that God projected those
[1:01:06] thoughts till it was a literal happening
[1:01:09] in his mind.
[1:01:12] And if I didn't believe that, I don't I
[1:01:14] I would have difficulty believing that
[1:01:16] he could actually have foreseen and
[1:01:18] foresaw us the way we are today, exactly
[1:01:22] as you are, dressed the way you are. And
[1:01:25] not only the way that we are sitting
[1:01:27] here, but what we have within us, what
[1:01:30] we're made up of. God knew all of that.
[1:01:33] He knew our needs back then, and he made
[1:01:36] a provision back then. And we're going
[1:01:38] down as a brother Brandon says is little
[1:01:41] humans creeping on the brittle threads
[1:01:43] of life and we have our various various
[1:01:46] needs. It's a ve very important that
[1:01:48] you're conscious. God didn't only know
[1:01:51] them but he's he's absolutely aware of
[1:01:54] everything this morning while I'm
[1:01:55] sitting here.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; But I would like to put it this way.
[1:02:02] I've got a number of statements. The
[1:02:05] altar and sacrificed lamb in heaven
[1:02:10] spoke of redemption.
[1:02:12] Redemption is something's got to be
[1:02:14] released. Something has to be brought
[1:02:16] back.
[1:02:18] God with the bloody skins to clothe Adam
[1:02:22] and Eve in Eden spoke of redemption.
[1:02:26] Incidentally, you that were here on the
[1:02:28] Monday night and heard the rabbi speak
[1:02:29] and he came to the the skins went
[1:02:33] through his uh dialogue about the skins.
[1:02:38] Soon as we stepped back in the study, I
[1:02:40] said, "If you saw some of the people
[1:02:42] smile, it was because that was my text
[1:02:45] last Sunday. I I I read the scripture of
[1:02:49] Adam with the skins."
[1:02:51] He said, "I'm sure that you approach it
[1:02:53] from a different direction.
[1:02:56] I said, "Yes, I certainly did." I said,
[1:02:58] "Those skins were bloody.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; They were bloody skins." And uh and just
[1:03:04] then someone walked in the office
[1:03:06] because I wanted to take it a little bit
[1:03:08] further. But those things make our our
[1:03:11] grand opportunities.
[1:03:15] So when God clothed Adam and Eve, he
[1:03:17] spoke of redemption.
[1:03:20] Abel, now watch watch it evolve, please.
[1:03:24] There's an altar in heaven
[1:03:27] and there's a slain lamb before the
[1:03:30] foundation of the world. What form? What
[1:03:32] substance? We don't know. But there it
[1:03:34] was. Now, a creation comes maybe
[1:03:38] hundreds of millions of years later, a
[1:03:40] creation comes and there's a fall.
[1:03:44] Well, that spoke of redemption because
[1:03:47] before the fall came, God knew the fall
[1:03:49] was going to come.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And he allowed this conditions for the
[1:03:53] fall to happen.
[1:03:57] That's a God you and I can't understand.
[1:04:00] I'm glad we know what we do know. But
[1:04:02] you can't fully comprehend that.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; No one here can. But God, that's why
[1:04:08] there was a lamb slain before the
[1:04:10] foundation of the world because it was a
[1:04:12] remedy before the disease came.
[1:04:14] is a remedy before death came.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; So it spoke of redemption. It spoke of
[1:04:21] redeeming back.
[1:04:23] So that very the very thought of
[1:04:26] redeeming back is declaring something's
[1:04:28] going to be lost. Something's going to
[1:04:30] be something's going to need redemption.
[1:04:35] And so now he comes and the scene is
[1:04:37] unfolded. Now it's God. See in heaven
[1:04:41] there's a lamb slain. Now we have God
[1:04:44] providing the bloody skins for a
[1:04:47] clothing. Speaking of redemption, then
[1:04:50] the next thing is we have Abel. Now a
[1:04:54] man, Adam didn't do it, but now Abel, a
[1:04:57] man, now he takes an animal.
[1:05:01] And the prophet says many times,
[1:05:04] Abel by revelation,
[1:05:07] by revelation. Revelation is more
[1:05:09] important to you, he said, than we have
[1:05:11] ever realized. Abel by revelation.
[1:05:16] How important that revelation was to
[1:05:18] him. What was it a revelation of? How
[1:05:20] did he even know which he had never
[1:05:22] seen? I don't believe there's any
[1:05:24] record. There's nothing to indicate in
[1:05:26] the scripture that he'd ever seen blood.
[1:05:30] How does he know that that substance
[1:05:33] exists? How does he know that that is
[1:05:36] what's required? But by revelation and
[1:05:39] the impulse of God's spirit by
[1:05:43] revelation. Revelation can cause a
[1:05:45] person to do some very drastic things.
[1:05:49] Revelation can cause a person to do
[1:05:51] things they don't understand. And I can
[1:05:54] guarantee you Abel didn't understand
[1:05:56] what he was doing fully. He didn't
[1:05:58] understand that he was making himself.
[1:06:02] He was he was offering a sacrifice that
[1:06:04] was absolutely essential.
[1:06:06] So now he takes but what he does points
[1:06:09] to redemption.
[1:06:11] And now it moves on from from what
[1:06:14] heaven to what God did to what now a man
[1:06:18] did, Abel did. Now the earth is filled
[1:06:22] with violence and God destroys it in the
[1:06:24] flood and eight souls walk out of the
[1:06:27] ark and Noah now it's first brother
[1:06:32] Brandham says that Abel had an altar.
[1:06:35] Cain had an altar but now we have the
[1:06:38] the scripture does not make reference to
[1:06:40] Cain or Abel's altar. It says that they
[1:06:43] brought these sacrifice or these
[1:06:45] offerings to God. But now we have a
[1:06:47] specific statement saying Noah built an
[1:06:50] altar.
[1:06:51] He built an altar. Now we have a
[1:06:54] reflection of something that was in
[1:06:56] heaven. Now is on earth. And he and and
[1:06:58] out of the few animals that he has, he
[1:07:00] offers sacrifices to God. And listen
[1:07:03] friends, it wasn't down just a something
[1:07:06] pointing towards redemption. But the
[1:07:08] Bible says that the sacrifice was a
[1:07:10] sweet smell in the nostrils of God. And
[1:07:14] because of that, God said, God was
[1:07:16] activated. God was moved by what Noah
[1:07:19] was doing. And God moved in such a way
[1:07:22] says, "I'll not destroy the earth again.
[1:07:28] I'm just going to take you for a great
[1:07:30] great leap and then come back.
[1:07:33] I'm going way to the end of the
[1:07:35] service."
[1:07:36] And because your heart's an altar and if
[1:07:39] you have the right thing on it, God is
[1:07:43] looking upon that sacrifice
[1:07:45] and he is accepting and having respect
[1:07:48] towards that sacrifice and is saying and
[1:07:51] has already declared and neither will
[1:07:54] you be destroyed.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I'll not destroy you either
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; because of what's on the altar is
[1:08:02] pleasing to me.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] So what Noah did and the altar he built
[1:08:16] and the sacrifices he made that pointed
[1:08:19] to redemption.
[1:08:22] And then it moves on. It evolves. It
[1:08:25] slowly gradually unfolds. Then comes
[1:08:27] Moses the first prophet and he in
[1:08:30] institutes altars many altars or many
[1:08:34] kinds of altars. many different places
[1:08:36] where the altars many different
[1:08:38] sacrifices but he institutes
[1:08:41] a priesthood that had never been Abel
[1:08:45] didn't have a priesthood. Noah didn't
[1:08:46] have a priesthood. There's no priesthood
[1:08:48] in heaven. But now that we see and now
[1:08:50] now we have a priesthood and there's a
[1:08:52] high priest and a priesthood associated
[1:08:55] with the altars and associated with the
[1:08:57] sacrifices. So it's evolving. It's
[1:08:59] getting larger. And then we find Abraham
[1:09:04] offering. Now Abraham, he makes an offer
[1:09:09] and now an altar, but now the thing is
[1:09:11] evolving and getting much larger. He's
[1:09:13] offering his son.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Abel offered a a an animal.
[1:09:21] Noah built an altar and offered some
[1:09:23] animals.
[1:09:26] But now we have Abraham on Mount Horeb
[1:09:30] with his son on an altar and ready to
[1:09:34] slay him. And although God stopped him,
[1:09:36] God accounted that he had slayed his son
[1:09:39] and raised him from the dead because
[1:09:42] that was the faith. The faith and God
[1:09:44] was looking. Now watch, God was not
[1:09:46] looking merely at what was physically
[1:09:48] happening. God was looking at the faith
[1:09:50] of the man who was doing it. And because
[1:09:53] a Abraham was willing to offer his son,
[1:09:57] God in the New Testament says as though
[1:09:59] he raised him from the dead because
[1:10:01] Abraham was prepared to slay him knowing
[1:10:04] his by his faith because God had
[1:10:06] promised him this son, God would have to
[1:10:08] raise him up again.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And God accounted that to him as
[1:10:13] righteousness because he believed God.
[1:10:15] So where was God looking? He was looking
[1:10:18] beyond Isaac laying on the altar to what
[1:10:21] was laying on the altar of Abraham's
[1:10:23] heart.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Always beyond what was physically
[1:10:30] happening. You might you might kneel at
[1:10:32] an altar here. You might stand and
[1:10:34] worship. You may raise your hand. You
[1:10:36] may do some things or you may not do
[1:10:37] anything. But God is going to look at
[1:10:39] your heart.
[1:10:45] And then we have Elijah,
[1:10:48] a restoring prophet. And now before
[1:10:52] before fire comes down from heaven on on
[1:10:54] the altar that there is no altar, he has
[1:10:58] to this God is showing reflecting
[1:11:02] through this
[1:11:04] all the types and shadows that there's
[1:11:05] going to be a time when the spirit of
[1:11:08] Elijah which is a restoring spirit is
[1:11:10] going to have to repair altars, heal
[1:11:13] altars, restore them. And what does the
[1:11:16] scripture say? Behold, I send Elijah the
[1:11:18] prophet before the great and terrible
[1:11:21] day of the Lord. And he shall he shall
[1:11:24] turn, same word. He'll restore, he'll
[1:11:28] turn back the heart of the people, the
[1:11:31] heart, the heart, the altar have to be
[1:11:33] turned back. The altar have to be
[1:11:35] repaired. There'd be a day when the
[1:11:38] inner being of man would need a voice
[1:11:41] from God to restore it back, to turn it
[1:11:45] back to God.
[1:11:47] And
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there isn't a man, woman, or
[1:11:49] child here that doesn't need that voice.
[1:11:53] It's a restoring voice. And then when
[1:11:56] God saw what was on the physical altar,
[1:11:59] but before he even saw that and before
[1:12:01] the fire came,
[1:12:03] Elijah had said to God, "Let it be known
[1:12:06] that I have done all of these things at
[1:12:09] your command." So it was Elijah's
[1:12:12] obedience to the word of God, which
[1:12:14] resulted in an altar being built and a
[1:12:17] sacrifice being made and fire coming
[1:12:19] down from heaven consuming the
[1:12:21] sacrifice. A lot of people get all
[1:12:22] caught up with the fire that came down
[1:12:24] from heaven. Just remember there was a
[1:12:26] lot that preceded that
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and that spirit of the spirit of Elijah
[1:12:31] had to rebuild the altar. And many times
[1:12:34] before you and I could offer anything to
[1:12:36] God, there are a lot of people offering
[1:12:38] wonderful uh sacrifices, physical
[1:12:41] things. They're paying their tithes.
[1:12:42] They're attending church. They're
[1:12:44] praying. They're saying the Lord's
[1:12:46] prayer. They're doing all of these
[1:12:47] things. But I tell you, the heart needs
[1:12:50] to be healed. The heart needs to be
[1:12:52] restored. The heart needs to be turned
[1:12:55] back to God. And then God looks upon
[1:12:58] that altar.
[1:13:04] The scripture was very specific.
[1:13:08] And all of these things pointed to
[1:13:10] redemption.
[1:13:11] And then Jesus, the son of God with the
[1:13:15] blood of the new creation,
[1:13:17] comes onto his altar. Brother Brandham
[1:13:19] talks about his altar being the cross in
[1:13:21] the message. Pardon. He said it wasn't
[1:13:23] very long until the lamb was nailed to
[1:13:26] his altar.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; The cross, the lamb was nailed to his
[1:13:30] and it wasn't we sang there. Some
[1:13:32] songwriters have written some beautiful
[1:13:34] songs. It wasn't the nails that held him
[1:13:36] there.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; It was his love,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; his obedience to his call.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "No man takes my life from me.
[1:13:46] I lay it down
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; and I will take it back up again."
[1:13:51] And so now we have journeyed from heaven
[1:13:55] to Eden to Abel
[1:13:58] to a to Noah to Abraham to Moses to
[1:14:02] Elijah. And it keeps unveiling,
[1:14:04] unfolding, unfolding, getting larger and
[1:14:06] larger. And now we have the lamb
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; on the cross
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; nailed to his altar.
[1:14:15] And what was in him was a new creation
[1:14:18] of God.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God starting a whole new
[1:14:22] creation by the spoken word of God down
[1:14:26] through the prophets lodged into the
[1:14:28] womb of a virgin. And she brought forth
[1:14:30] Jesus Christ. But thousands of years
[1:14:33] before, maybe like eternities before, it
[1:14:36] was all in the mind of God. And there
[1:14:38] was the lamb.
[1:14:40] But that wasn't all. He entered in once
[1:14:43] with the blood, but he gave up the
[1:14:47] ghost. And then the scripture could say,
[1:14:50] "And you," if that event had not taken
[1:14:54] place at Calvary, the other scripture
[1:14:57] which I already read, "And you have an
[1:15:00] anointing
[1:15:02] that abides in you." that could never
[1:15:06] have been spoken if he had not dispensed
[1:15:09] with his life. And the spirit, the life
[1:15:12] that was in that bloodstream of Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ was released and brought down
[1:15:18] onto a people.
[1:15:21] Many people claim to have it today.
[1:15:29] But here's where we're going to really
[1:15:30] get to the crux of the matter.
[1:15:35] The price of redemption now had been
[1:15:37] paid.
[1:15:40] The price of redemption
[1:15:42] had been paid.
[1:15:45] And when the prophet now I want you to
[1:15:47] see,
[1:15:49] he's now been commissioned
[1:15:52] and he has spoken.
[1:15:55] Sir, is this the time?
[1:15:59] and he's been in a room and a visitation
[1:16:02] of angels and it left him numb. Imagine
[1:16:05] experience you've had some experiences
[1:16:08] folks where this experience even left a
[1:16:10] messenger left brother Bradam numb in
[1:16:13] the corner of the room and his wife
[1:16:15] knocking on the door gently knocking
[1:16:20] and and and and the visitation
[1:16:24] just by vision left him in that state.
[1:16:27] Now he's commissioned go west. He goes
[1:16:32] in a desert place and the visitation of
[1:16:35] the angels. He said they came from the
[1:16:38] eternities in a split. Caught him up
[1:16:40] into that. Oh, a lot of people. Joseph
[1:16:44] Smith saw an angel. These people saw
[1:16:46] angels. All kinds of people had angels.
[1:16:48] I'm talking about something that came
[1:16:49] out of this visitation. I'm talking
[1:16:51] about a word. I'm talking about
[1:16:53] something that makes a congregation such
[1:16:55] as you are today. If this thing doesn't
[1:16:58] have any real substance to it, then we
[1:17:00] forget it. Go home, enjoy life, and have
[1:17:02] a good time. But I declare today that
[1:17:05] there is something there's a life that's
[1:17:07] present with the believers of this
[1:17:08] message that you cannot find elsewhere.
[1:17:11] And if you could, I would be there.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I want to be honest enough with you. If
[1:17:16] there was something someplace that
[1:17:18] exceeded this, I would I would seek to
[1:17:20] be there. I want to be where God is,
[1:17:23] where God's doing things. But I see a
[1:17:25] character. I see a presence of God. I
[1:17:28] feel that atmosphere. I can I can sense
[1:17:31] that amongst the people. And friends,
[1:17:33] it's my diet.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; It's my diet. I'll I'll borrow Brother
[1:17:40] Burkheart's words what he said to me
[1:17:41] from from Frankfurt, Germany, when I was
[1:17:44] trying to convince him to stay there.
[1:17:46] Just stay in Germany. You know, get
[1:17:48] behind the work and do what you can. And
[1:17:50] and he just said, "Ah, brother Ed,
[1:17:53] brother Bisll, this is my diet.
[1:17:56] I have to say to you this message is my
[1:17:58] diet.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And when you get into it, you can't see
[1:18:01] anything else but that.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; He prophet said if I came speaking to
[1:18:06] you of a a Lutheran message, he said it
[1:18:08] wouldn't mean anything to you. If I came
[1:18:10] speaking the Wesleyan message, it
[1:18:12] wouldn't mean anything to you. This
[1:18:13] message means something to you. And if
[1:18:16] it doesn't mean anything to you, then
[1:18:17] there's nothing there. You know, the two
[1:18:18] pieces of paper aren't coming together.
[1:18:20] But it means something to you. Then
[1:18:22] they're coming together. Say it fits.
[1:18:25] That's my diet
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; that energizes me. That gives me
[1:18:28] supernatural health.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And now in the end time, he's had the
[1:18:35] visitation.
[1:18:37] Listen closely.
[1:18:39] And before now he comes back and he's
[1:18:41] commissioned. The lamb has to open the
[1:18:44] seals.
[1:18:46] But these mysteries cannot remain as
[1:18:48] mysteries. They must be unfolded,
[1:18:50] unveiled.
[1:18:51] And so the messenger comes back to do
[1:18:54] that. But before he does that, before he
[1:18:57] starts with the first seal, and this is
[1:19:00] really critical, many of you it's may
[1:19:03] perhaps be elementary, but to others
[1:19:05] it's not. And before the messenger, the
[1:19:09] mouthpiece begins to speak the opening
[1:19:12] of the seals and the revealing of the
[1:19:14] mysteries that God has held before the
[1:19:16] foundation of the world.
[1:19:19] He speaks to God in simplicity and then
[1:19:22] moves into the breach. He said now you
[1:19:25] want to read the breach. Says now the
[1:19:27] breach is between the church ages
[1:19:31] and the seals.
[1:19:33] He said the seals was is Christ himself
[1:19:37] because it's the revealing of Christ.
[1:19:40] And the church ages is exactly what it
[1:19:43] is. Church which is in the feminine
[1:19:44] gender is the time the era of the woman.
[1:19:47] The church for 2,000 years.
[1:19:51] The church ages. At the end of the
[1:19:53] church ages comes a a call of a
[1:19:55] messenger calling out a people. Come out
[1:19:58] from amongst her.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Be ye separate, says the Lord.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Now it called her out to do what?
[1:20:08] And if you read the breach, you'll keep
[1:20:10] running into this phrase
[1:20:13] because now comes the time. Calvary was
[1:20:17] the redeeming price. But now comes the
[1:20:19] time
[1:20:21] for redemption claims.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; It was spoke of redemption in heaven.
[1:20:28] The skins in Eden spoke of redemption.
[1:20:30] Abel spoke of redemption. Noah spoke of
[1:20:33] redemption. Abraham spoke of redemption.
[1:20:36] Moses spoke of redemption. Elijah spoke
[1:20:38] of redemption. And Christ on Calvary
[1:20:41] paid the price for redemption. But now
[1:20:43] in the end time comes the claiming time
[1:20:47] to claim what was purchased. Redemptions
[1:20:51] claims
[1:20:58] he said he comes forth to take his
[1:20:59] claims. Now
[1:21:01] comes forth to take his claims. He had
[1:21:04] done the kinsman work. You'll find in
[1:21:07] the breach, the message of breach,
[1:21:11] you'll have to have the book of Ruth
[1:21:13] ready because that's where it comes
[1:21:15] from. The book of Ruth. When Ruth was
[1:21:18] redeemed, actually Naomi was redeemed.
[1:21:22] Naomi, the Orthodox
[1:21:25] church, Orthodox Jewish church is
[1:21:29] redeemed in redeeming it. Got Ruth, the
[1:21:33] gentile bride.
[1:21:36] So now I want to talk about the fullness
[1:21:39] of redemption.
[1:21:41] The fullness of redemption,
[1:21:44] it can only be the fullness of
[1:21:46] redemption can only be when what God
[1:21:49] held in his mind
[1:21:52] now becomes
[1:21:55] something that materially happens.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; God God saw Christ the lamb redeeming
[1:22:02] mankind.
[1:22:04] It wasn't it wasn't sufficient that he
[1:22:06] just had it there. It had to be
[1:22:09] physical. There had to be a place called
[1:22:12] Mount Calvary. There had to be a cross,
[1:22:14] a wooden cross. There had to be a man,
[1:22:17] Jesus Christ, the new creation, nailed
[1:22:20] on his altar. That had to happen in
[1:22:23] order for what God had in his mind to be
[1:22:25] fulfilled. There it is.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus coming up out of the water. This
[1:22:30] is my beloved son.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; On Mount Transfiguration, this is my
[1:22:35] beloved son. Hear ye him. It had to
[1:22:38] happen. It's not sufficient just in the
[1:22:40] mind and in the mind of God. There had
[1:22:42] to be a group of people such as we have
[1:22:44] here this morning. We're not the only
[1:22:47] people in the in the earth, of course,
[1:22:48] but there had to be a people such as
[1:22:51] such as you are here today. There had to
[1:22:53] be the individual person. When Christ
[1:22:55] came here, it wasn't sufficient only
[1:22:57] that Christ came. John had to be there.
[1:23:00] Peter had to be there. Andrew had to be
[1:23:02] there. Matthew had to be there. These
[1:23:05] men had to be there because they were
[1:23:07] part of the picture.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And if you're not part of the picture,
[1:23:16] you go and have a great time. But if you
[1:23:19] know in your soul, you're part of the
[1:23:22] picture. Then you have to know that
[1:23:24] great eternal God, our father, which art
[1:23:27] in heaven, who loves fatherhood. And he
[1:23:30] had to have a son. But not only did he
[1:23:33] have to have a son, he had to have a
[1:23:35] family.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Where's the house that you build me?
[1:23:39] Where's my household? Where's my
[1:23:41] children? Every single one of them. Is
[1:23:44] there a mother and father in the
[1:23:45] scripture? even ask can can a mother
[1:23:47] forget her child? Can can God forget his
[1:23:51] children?
[1:23:53] He can't forget them.
[1:23:56] So now comes the fullness.
[1:24:04] Now I want to take a sharp turn
[1:24:09] with a scripture that you know very
[1:24:11] well.
[1:24:13] Now, faith
[1:24:15] is the substance
[1:24:19] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[1:24:21] things not seen. I want to use that
[1:24:25] word, and if it sounds like I'm
[1:24:28] overworking it, maybe I am, to
[1:24:31] overemphasize it. We don't know what the
[1:24:34] substance was in heaven.
[1:24:38] We don't know what form
[1:24:41] if there was any form.
[1:24:45] Then we come down into Eden
[1:24:48] and God slays animals but he takes the
[1:24:50] skins of it.
[1:24:53] And then Abel slays an animal. And now
[1:24:56] we have actual for the first time we
[1:24:58] actually have a physical physical blood
[1:25:01] of an animal that's that is shed.
[1:25:07] I want to say something.
[1:25:10] It wasn't the substance of the blood
[1:25:12] that came out of Abel's lamb.
[1:25:15] It was the substance of the revelation
[1:25:17] that was in his heart.
[1:25:20] That was the substance that God was
[1:25:22] looking at. Because that substance that
[1:25:26] was on that substance that came out of
[1:25:28] his lamb, that's going to be gone in a
[1:25:30] few days. But that substance, faith is a
[1:25:34] substance. And he had a revelation from
[1:25:37] God, but more than that, he had faith
[1:25:40] that that revelation had come from God.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why he offered it to God. So
[1:25:47] there was something on the altar of his
[1:25:49] heart that was far beyond the animal
[1:25:53] that was on the altar.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; God looked beyond that altar. And I want
[1:25:58] to say to you, I can take you all
[1:26:00] through the scriptures. It's been faith
[1:26:02] at every instance.
[1:26:05] faith. By faith, Noah built an ark to
[1:26:09] the saving of his household. But not
[1:26:12] only did he save his household, he was
[1:26:14] the instrument by which the earth was
[1:26:16] preserved.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; It was his faith. His faith was the
[1:26:21] substance. God looking beyond what he
[1:26:25] offered on the altar.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; What he offered on the altar, God was
[1:26:29] pleased. It was a sweet smelling
[1:26:32] sweet sweet smelling incense to God. But
[1:26:36] why was it a sweet smelling incense?
[1:26:38] Because God was looking upon his heart.
[1:26:45] What was on the altar was only
[1:26:47] expressing what was in his heart.
[1:26:50] In his being, he comes out into a new
[1:26:53] world
[1:26:55] and he offers to God a sacrifice.
[1:26:59] Faith was the substance
[1:27:06] able by revelation. He said it was
[1:27:08] revealed to him by God that it was not
[1:27:13] beauty. Neither was it fruits of the
[1:27:16] field or apples that drove them from the
[1:27:19] garden of Eden.
[1:27:21] Wasn't apples that drove them from the
[1:27:23] Garden of Eden. We know that.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But it was blood.
[1:27:28] Who told him it was blood? Of all the
[1:27:31] things he could have offered, who told
[1:27:33] him it was blood?
[1:27:36] And so when blood appeared on the earth,
[1:27:39] it only testified that he had faith in
[1:27:42] his heart that what God had spoken to
[1:27:45] him in his inner being in his heart that
[1:27:47] he believed it
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; and God saw the faith and the faith was
[1:27:52] the substance
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; and the animal was only a consequence of
[1:27:57] his faith. By faith,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Abel offered. By faith, by the substance
[1:28:04] that was in his being, he offered a more
[1:28:07] excellent sacrifice than Cain.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; By faith, he offered it.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; What are you here for today? by faith in
[1:28:17] the message and the word that you've
[1:28:18] believed your very presence here in this
[1:28:21] place. The fact you maybe raise your
[1:28:23] hands or lift up your voice or do
[1:28:26] whatever you do it is it is only an
[1:28:28] expression of a faith that is in your
[1:28:30] being
[1:28:32] and God looks at that faith to see if
[1:28:35] it's a bleeding
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; sacrifice.
[1:28:39] A lot of people believe things and the
[1:28:41] things that they are doing they're going
[1:28:43] to church. They're driving a long ways.
[1:28:45] They're paying their tithes. They're
[1:28:47] doing all this activity. But God looks
[1:28:49] beyond that to see if there's a bleeding
[1:28:52] sacrifice.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; I do what I do because there's a certain
[1:29:00] word that came and that message that
[1:29:03] came had been vindicated by a
[1:29:06] supernatural God. And a vessel spoke,
[1:29:09] "Thus saith the Lord." And the prophet
[1:29:12] and the God of the prophet looks through
[1:29:14] all the activity of the people,
[1:29:16] religious activity on earth. And he
[1:29:18] looks through to see who has blood on
[1:29:21] the altar.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And there can't be a whole bunch of
[1:29:25] bleeding words.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; As there was not a bunch of bleeding
[1:29:29] Jesus's, there was one. And there's one
[1:29:32] message. There's one voice. There's one
[1:29:35] word from God. And it's a bleeding word.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:41] And he looks through to that altar to
[1:29:43] see and that faith is the substance.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:30:02] Only by revelation could he know
[1:30:07] to offer the correct substance.
[1:30:10] Only by a sovereign revelation from God
[1:30:14] can you know that this message is a
[1:30:17] message from God.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Only a revelation can tell you that. And
[1:30:21] if you truly have that revelation,
[1:30:23] nothing can ever argue you out of it.
[1:30:25] Nothing can ever the most the most
[1:30:28] desolate situation, the most
[1:30:32] incredible hopeless situation
[1:30:38] in the bridge. Brother Brandham goes to
[1:30:40] Ruth,
[1:30:41] the book of Ruth. I read it again last
[1:30:44] night, although I know it so well.
[1:30:47] But the thing I was impressed with once
[1:30:49] again,
[1:30:51] how utterly hopeless
[1:30:53] this situation and and Naomi actually
[1:30:57] capsulizes the hopelessness of it
[1:31:02] when she finally says to her
[1:31:03] daughters-in-law,
[1:31:05] "Go back to your mother's house.
[1:31:10] I've heard that there's
[1:31:12] food and I'm going to return to my
[1:31:14] people.
[1:31:16] Go back, daughters.
[1:31:18] Go back. You've been wonderful young
[1:31:21] ladies.
[1:31:23] You've stood with me.
[1:31:26] We've had the death of my husband and
[1:31:29] both of your husbands and we've been
[1:31:31] together and you've been wonderful girls
[1:31:35] and now I say go back.
[1:31:38] Said, "No, we're not going to go back."
[1:31:41] And she says,
[1:31:44] "Why would you come with me? I'm an old
[1:31:47] woman."
[1:31:49] Now, she's making a statement. I'm an
[1:31:52] old woman. Are there any more sons in
[1:31:56] me?
[1:31:57] I don't have a husband. Is there any
[1:32:00] more sons? In other words, how are you
[1:32:02] going to be redeemed?
[1:32:05] The law of redemption says that the
[1:32:07] brother is supposed to take his wife and
[1:32:10] raise up seed. How is redemption going
[1:32:13] to come? There's no possibility of
[1:32:16] redemption. My husband's gone. I'm an
[1:32:19] old woman. There's no more sons in my
[1:32:21] womb.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Go.
[1:32:25] And at that orpha went
[1:32:29] because redemption
[1:32:32] was so hopeless.
[1:32:34] You know, friends, we're down here at Le
[1:32:36] Oysia, but there's a very hopeless
[1:32:39] generation.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And there's there's not a few of us that
[1:32:45] come to times and places in our lives
[1:32:47] along life's journey when things look
[1:32:50] utterly hopeless.
[1:32:53] But I want to say to this congregation
[1:32:55] and all that are streaming today,
[1:32:59] the fact that something in heaven said,
[1:33:02] "There's redemption
[1:33:04] and I will do redemption."
[1:33:07] And that very God personally stepped
[1:33:09] down in in Eden and said, "There's
[1:33:11] redemption."
[1:33:13] And he inspired Abel by revelation.
[1:33:15] There's redemption.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And he inspired Noah into a new world
[1:33:20] and there's redemption.
[1:33:22] And Abraham slaying his son getting
[1:33:24] ready. It spoke of redemption. There is
[1:33:27] redemption all the way through. And
[1:33:28] finally, he hung on the cross, nailed to
[1:33:31] his altar, declaring to the world before
[1:33:34] and after, there's redemption. It's been
[1:33:36] paid for.
[1:33:39] And now after these hundreds and uh
[1:33:42] thousands of years comes the same
[1:33:44] restoring voice that rebuilt the altar
[1:33:46] back there. Introduce the mess and
[1:33:48] introduce Christ himself, the angel of
[1:33:51] the covenant coming in the end time
[1:33:53] because it's been prophesied he'll come
[1:33:55] in the end time and heal the hearts of
[1:33:57] the people. Why? Because the altar had
[1:34:00] to be rebuilt because they didn't even
[1:34:01] know what kind of sacrifice to offer.
[1:34:04] And then he offer the the healing takes
[1:34:07] place and a word proceeds. A bleeding
[1:34:10] word that will be the sacrifice for the
[1:34:12] rebuilt altar,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; the restored altar. A message, a
[1:34:17] bleeding message that God can look back
[1:34:19] down on. He looks through. He looks
[1:34:21] beyond your life and what you're doing.
[1:34:25] Looks beyond your faithfulness and your
[1:34:26] giving and your your integrity. He looks
[1:34:29] beyond all of the religious activity to
[1:34:32] see what's on the altar.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And there better be blood there.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; And there's only one bleeding word.
[1:34:42] There's only one bleeding word.
[1:34:48] Is there any more sons?
[1:34:52] And Ruth just says,
[1:34:56] "Remember
[1:34:59] Ruth the widow."
[1:35:01] And Ruth says wonderful words. They like
[1:35:03] to say it at different times, but Ruth
[1:35:06] lays a hold of her mother-in-law. Don't
[1:35:09] entreat me. Don't ask me to leave you
[1:35:13] because I'm not leaving you. That was
[1:35:16] the belief. That was the faith. That was
[1:35:19] the substance. God looked straight
[1:35:21] through for that. Hadn't told her yet.
[1:35:23] Hadn't revealed it to her yet. But in
[1:35:25] God's mind says, "I got a field for you.
[1:35:29] I got a Boaz for you. I got some
[1:35:32] harvest. I got some barley for you. I
[1:35:35] got a restoration for you. You don't
[1:35:38] know it yet. I haven't revealed it to
[1:35:40] you. But I look through all of this
[1:35:42] hopelessness and I see redemption."
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:52] a redemption for her.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; She had a Boaz
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; when she was still a widow. She had a
[1:36:00] redeemer. You had a redeemer when you
[1:36:02] were depths in the depths of sin and
[1:36:04] unbelief. When you were in your sin and
[1:36:07] in your hopeless condition, you had a
[1:36:09] redeemer.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had a field for you. He
[1:36:16] had a feast for you. He had a message
[1:36:18] for you. all prepared for you before you
[1:36:21] were even aware of it or conscious of
[1:36:23] it.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Are Boaz?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing I want to say to
[1:36:31] this congregation today and I want you
[1:36:33] to take it personally. There is nothing
[1:36:36] that any man, woman or child here has
[1:36:39] experienced, is experiencing or ever
[1:36:42] will experience that is hopeless enough.
[1:36:45] it. I don't care how hopeless it may
[1:36:48] appear.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; It cannot be sufficiently hopeless
[1:36:52] because Christ God has prepared a
[1:36:56] redemption that is complete.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; And the message came to let us know that
[1:37:02] redemption claims have now come. He
[1:37:05] can't claim it till it's happened.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it happened at Calvary."
[1:37:11] God has required sacrifice all through
[1:37:13] the ages. I can say to Leodysia,
[1:37:17] where's your sacrifice
[1:37:19] beyond where this message will go?
[1:37:21] Where's your sacrifice? Show me please
[1:37:24] the bleeding word. Show me please the
[1:37:26] word that God himself who held skins one
[1:37:30] day. Show me where he has stood beside
[1:37:33] the belief, the doctrine, the faith
[1:37:37] and supernaturally vindicated it and
[1:37:39] confirmed it again and again again. What
[1:37:42] God is saying is believe. Believe only.
[1:37:44] Believe. Believe. Believe it's me.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Believe it's not a man. Believe it's me.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; The scripture which we read,
[1:38:03] Christ being come and high priest of
[1:38:06] good things.
[1:38:09] Oh, how many times you listen to tapes,
[1:38:13] read the message books, how many times
[1:38:15] does the prophet ask, who did she touch?
[1:38:19] Who did he touch? Who did this one
[1:38:21] touch? Not me. I'm 30 feet from this
[1:38:25] person. Who did they touch? The high
[1:38:27] priest. They touched the high priest.
[1:38:30] And what did the angel say?
[1:38:36] If you can get the people to believe
[1:38:41] nothing will stand before your prayers.
[1:38:44] So now it was what was in the people's
[1:38:46] heart first.
[1:38:49] What was on the altar first? If you can
[1:38:53] get the people to believe and once they
[1:38:56] believed the word that was coming then
[1:38:58] nothing could stand before the prayers.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Not even cancer. Nothing can stand
[1:39:03] before the prayers. Are you people
[1:39:04] following what I'm saying?
[1:39:06] Faith is the substance. Faith, your
[1:39:09] faith. Say, "I believe it." And brother
[1:39:11] Bram says, "If you believe it, you will
[1:39:13] do it."
[1:39:16] You believe it.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:27] Now,
[1:39:30] just quickly,
[1:39:32] I don't want to take it be too lengthy
[1:39:35] this morning
[1:39:38] in the message broken sistns and I'm
[1:39:40] using quite a few quotes and I hope I
[1:39:43] know that you will appreciate that you
[1:39:46] that are visiting if you won't mind
[1:39:48] because I'm wanting to lay this out very
[1:39:50] clearly in the message broken sistns
[1:39:55] prophet said God only has one meeting
[1:39:59] place he said over there in the book of
[1:40:02] Exodus I have chosen the place to put my
[1:40:07] name and that's the only place that I'll
[1:40:10] meet the people. So now we can release
[1:40:12] our you know our imagination. People use
[1:40:15] their imagination. Oh you know my heart
[1:40:17] is the place. Okay fine
[1:40:22] like I was in a very many many years ago
[1:40:25] I was in a quite a gathering. I'd been
[1:40:27] invited and it was just in a house and
[1:40:28] everybody was you know just gathered and
[1:40:30] they had heard about the message. Some
[1:40:32] of them and a lot of them had not. And I
[1:40:34] thought, what am I going to speak to
[1:40:36] these people? And there was about 22
[1:40:38] people there. So I said, now I don't
[1:40:41] know these people. Maybe this one over
[1:40:42] here is a Nazarene, and this one over
[1:40:44] here may be from the Salvation Army, and
[1:40:46] this one over here might be a Baptist,
[1:40:48] and this one over here may be a
[1:40:49] Pentecostal. This one over here may be a
[1:40:52] a Catholic. But if I said, "Do you love
[1:40:55] Jesus?" You'd all say, you all would
[1:40:58] say, "Yes, we love Jesus." And now I'm
[1:41:02] going to read the scripture that says
[1:41:03] that Jesus was the word
[1:41:07] and the word became flesh. Jesus is the
[1:41:09] word. And I'm quite certain that you all
[1:41:13] believe a different word.
[1:41:16] You all believe a different word. You
[1:41:18] all have a different doctrine. So would
[1:41:20] the real Jesus please stand up?
[1:41:24] Who who who has Jesus?
[1:41:27] This one's got a trinity. This one
[1:41:29] doesn't even believe in the communion.
[1:41:30] And this one over here believes
[1:41:31] something else. And this one doesn't
[1:41:33] baptize. And this one baptizes. And who
[1:41:36] has Jesus?
[1:41:38] Who has blood on the altar?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Who has a bleeding word?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And there isn't a whole array of them.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And that's what people are have a hard
[1:41:50] time with. Say there's only one way.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; There's only one way.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; There's only one Jesus. There's only one
[1:41:58] voice.
[1:42:00] God's not going to confuse.
[1:42:02] I sense that that's difficult for some
[1:42:04] people that are even here, but that's
[1:42:07] the truth.
[1:42:10] There's only one place I've chosen to
[1:42:13] put my name and that he chose a place to
[1:42:16] put his name and where he puts his name.
[1:42:19] That's where he met Israel.
[1:42:22] He's got a place that he meets the
[1:42:24] church. He got a place where he met
[1:42:26] Israel. He got a place where he meets
[1:42:27] his church today. and he chose that name
[1:42:31] and that name is Jesus Christ. So now if
[1:42:34] a person says Jesus Christ,
[1:42:37] do they have that name? Someone say yes
[1:42:41] because it's in their language. So we
[1:42:43] express it and we have many many tongues
[1:42:45] that are here and we would say it in our
[1:42:50] in our native tongue. Does that mean we
[1:42:53] have him? It has to go beyond that.
[1:42:56] That's a physical thing that is taking
[1:42:58] place. But if that is taking place as a
[1:43:02] result of
[1:43:05] a pure, undiluted, unadulterated faith
[1:43:10] on the altar of the heart that has heard
[1:43:14] the voice of God and has been revealed
[1:43:16] to them. This is the word that you sent.
[1:43:19] This is your voice to me. And I cast all
[1:43:22] other things aside. I cast my own
[1:43:25] thoughts aside and I declare that is the
[1:43:27] revelation that has come from you. I
[1:43:29] believe it. God looks beyond your
[1:43:31] action. He looks beyond your voice,
[1:43:34] beyond the hearing of your voice.
[1:43:36] Because you may all say Jesus
[1:43:38] differently, but he looks down to see
[1:43:40] what is in the bosom, what is in the
[1:43:42] heart to see if there's a bleeding word
[1:43:44] there. In other words, he's saying,
[1:43:46] "What is it you've believed?"
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Here's all the various doctrines. Now
[1:43:52] friends, perhaps you can see, and you'll
[1:43:55] have to think this over. Perhaps you can
[1:43:57] see why that little messenger, why
[1:43:59] brother Brandham cut so hard and was so
[1:44:02] uh so fervent against denomination. Why
[1:44:05] I'm against denomination? Because
[1:44:07] denomination was instilling and putting
[1:44:09] different things upon the altar.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; They were putting things upon the altar
[1:44:14] and making people devoted with the
[1:44:16] doctrine from the church and putting
[1:44:18] things on the altar of their heart that
[1:44:20] God couldn't accept.
[1:44:22] No wonder he had to cut that thing down.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; He was doing them the greatest favor.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; But they said, "You're against my
[1:44:30] church. You're against my pastor. You're
[1:44:32] against my priest. You're against He
[1:44:33] wasn't against that. He was against the
[1:44:35] fact that God couldn't accept it."
[1:44:39] Said, "There's only one place." Oh,
[1:44:41] church, help me. You believe that?
[1:44:44] There's only one place.
[1:44:47] And if you can see my message of God is
[1:44:49] looking beyond
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; the actions that you may do. He's
[1:44:53] looking beyond the confession of the
[1:44:56] word of your mouth to see first what's
[1:44:58] on your heart
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; and then if what comes out of your mouth
[1:45:02] matches what's on your heart.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; God looks on the heart
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and sees a bleeding sacrifice. Said
[1:45:10] that's my bleeding word that is
[1:45:12] acceptable to me. You are redeemed.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; That's what redemption is all about.
[1:45:21] You're one I've come to redeem.
[1:45:24] And now I've come with redemption's
[1:45:26] claims.
[1:45:31] He says, "There's where he meets the
[1:45:32] true believer."
[1:45:34] The same place. It's not complicated.
[1:45:37] You don't have to explain this message
[1:45:39] I'm preaching this morning. All you have
[1:45:41] to do is believe.
[1:45:44] Believe with a sincere heart. Believe
[1:45:46] with a pure heart.
[1:45:50] And God that I'm talking about today,
[1:45:53] I need it myself because God's not
[1:45:56] looking on your heart for me. He's
[1:45:58] looking on my heart for me. Looking on
[1:46:00] your heart for you to see what's on your
[1:46:03] heart to see what is there.
[1:46:11] Ephesians, and I'm going to be closing
[1:46:13] in just another few minutes.
[1:46:16] Ephesians, Paul says, Ephesians 1:14,
[1:46:21] speaking of the spirit, which is the
[1:46:25] earnest of our inheritance.
[1:46:28] Let's let's let's turn to that. I I'd
[1:46:30] like you to read that with me. Ephesians
[1:46:33] chapter 1.
[1:46:49] We'll read verse 13 first.
[1:46:52] In whom you also trusted after that you
[1:46:56] heard the word of truth. In whom you
[1:46:59] also had faith. in whom you also
[1:47:02] trusted. After that you heard the word
[1:47:06] of truth, the gospel of your salvation.
[1:47:11] In whom also after that you believed,
[1:47:14] you trusted. And after you believed, you
[1:47:17] were what?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Sealed. Say it again. You were sealed.
[1:47:22] After you believed, so what was God
[1:47:24] looking at? He was looking at the
[1:47:26] substance
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; of the faith.
[1:47:31] on your heart. And after you believed,
[1:47:35] you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:47:37] promise, which is the earnest, the down
[1:47:40] payment of our inheritance until until
[1:47:46] the redemption of the purchased
[1:47:49] possession.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet is coming
[1:47:52] now ready to open the seals. And he's
[1:47:55] saying that this is the time. This is
[1:47:58] what is happening. This is the time that
[1:48:00] that that Ruth is to be redeemed. This
[1:48:03] is the time. This is the time, friends,
[1:48:05] for the redemption to claims to come
[1:48:08] into place.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Redemption claims have been happening.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; You know why you're here? Because the
[1:48:16] message came and the spirit of God came
[1:48:20] with that word and laid hold of you and
[1:48:23] claimed you for himself.
[1:48:27] Hallelujah.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; The very coming of the message, not the
[1:48:32] healing ministry, the first pull, not
[1:48:34] the second pull, but the healing, the
[1:48:36] opening of the message, the third third
[1:48:38] pull caught the bride.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word caught the
[1:48:45] bride.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And it was the
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; kinsman redeemer
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; making his claim on you.
[1:48:54] That's what's been happening.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; We're here because we've been claimed.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Redemption claims have all come into
[1:49:00] place.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in the in the
[1:49:04] breach, I'm going to just go very
[1:49:05] quickly here. He said, "What is the
[1:49:08] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:49:11] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:49:13] possession to the praise of his glory in
[1:49:16] the breach?" He said, "That's what the
[1:49:18] Holy Spirit's been doing. He goes and he
[1:49:21] inspects
[1:49:23] Oh, I could stop here and preach a
[1:49:26] service.
[1:49:30] Brother Be talks about people seeing
[1:49:33] flying saucers and all of these things.
[1:49:36] He just stops and says, "Well,
[1:49:39] investigating angels."
[1:49:46] Does that sound strange?
[1:49:48] Men were busy every day. Every day they
[1:49:50] were busy building the Tower of Babel.
[1:49:52] We got to we got to reach something up
[1:49:54] into heaven because there's been a flood
[1:49:56] and we want to be sure and have a name.
[1:49:57] We want to be sure and establish
[1:49:58] ourselves. We got to have a name.
[1:50:03] And the Bible says, "And God came down
[1:50:06] to see what they were doing." You say,
[1:50:08] "God, I thought he knew everything." Oh,
[1:50:10] there's times when he just wants to come
[1:50:11] and see it himself personally. And God
[1:50:13] came down.
[1:50:15] God came down in the time of in the time
[1:50:18] of Abraham
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; and he said and two messengers went to
[1:50:22] Lot to Sodom said I want to go down and
[1:50:25] see now what they've done
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; and in the end time oh in the end time
[1:50:30] we were shooting splutnicks up in uh
[1:50:33] space shuttles up into the space and
[1:50:35] going several billion miles going all
[1:50:37] out there and examining the universe and
[1:50:41] I think God just is you little twerps
[1:50:46] You haven't even You haven't even got to
[1:50:48] the first word that came out of my
[1:50:50] mouth.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; You've gone there three billion miles.
[1:50:53] How do you like to go three billion
[1:50:54] light years?
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; The kind of God that we have.
[1:51:02] And in this age,
[1:51:05] he came down.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Says to Moses, I've come down. Go thou
[1:51:10] therefore. Brother Brandon makes a big
[1:51:12] point out of that. Keep saying it. I've
[1:51:14] come down. You go. I've come down. You
[1:51:16] go. Who was I was going? Wasn't William
[1:51:19] Brandom out of Jeffersonville, Indiana.
[1:51:21] God was going.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Look through those eyes to see where
[1:51:24] this cultured, educated, theological,
[1:51:29] science generation had gone. God came
[1:51:33] down.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Let's see where they're at. And he
[1:51:37] inspected the church.
[1:51:40] It's sick.
[1:51:42] very sick.
[1:51:45] Looked at all the religions
[1:51:48] filled, the Bible says, with putrifying
[1:51:50] swords.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; He looked at the world. He looked at
[1:51:55] science
[1:52:00] going towards death.
[1:52:02] God inspected this age.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; He inspected this age.
[1:52:12] I don't believe there's a person here
[1:52:14] that has really come to a real
[1:52:16] revelation of the message. A real
[1:52:18] revelation. But what one of the first
[1:52:21] things that happened, you begin to feel
[1:52:25] such so exposed,
[1:52:29] so exposed.
[1:52:31] And things that seem so great to you
[1:52:34] just
[1:52:37] ethered away. And all of the
[1:52:40] righteousness that we once thought we
[1:52:41] had and all that we thought we knew just
[1:52:45] vanished
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; in his presence.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know why you were being
[1:52:56] inspected?
[1:52:58] The inspector come not not with some
[1:53:01] critical eye but just coming and
[1:53:04] examining you.
[1:53:07] I look across this congregation
[1:53:10] and all kinds of experiences come back.
[1:53:19] People that I've talked to, I see them
[1:53:22] sitting in the congregation today and
[1:53:25] they had something to say. You know,
[1:53:30] I might get in trouble.
[1:53:34] Sister Bobby Graham, she she knows me
[1:53:36] well enough. that she can take it.
[1:53:44] She was reared in the Catholic, you
[1:53:46] know, the Catholic faith. She knew her
[1:53:49] catechism. She knew the Bible. Brother
[1:53:51] Joe had talked to me. He said, he said,
[1:53:52] "I, you know, she she really
[1:53:55] understands. She knows, you know, the
[1:53:56] Bible and religious things." So, I said,
[1:53:58] "I haven't really got a chance with
[1:53:59] her." So, anyway, make it short. She
[1:54:03] came to church. Brother Vin was
[1:54:05] preaching
[1:54:08] and he preached on the Vatican, the
[1:54:09] Catholic Church and the Popes and the
[1:54:11] whole works and just took it all up in
[1:54:13] little pieces and dropped it all to the
[1:54:14] ground. And I'll never forget and Sister
[1:54:17] Bobby walked out that door. She wasn't
[1:54:19] Sister Bobby yet, but she walked out the
[1:54:21] door, was leaning kind of against the
[1:54:23] wall, and I kind of come by and I said,
[1:54:24] "Well, Sister Bobby," she says, "Now I
[1:54:26] know you're Catholic bashing.
[1:54:30] You remember it?"
[1:54:33] I said, "No, no, Sister Bobby,
[1:54:36] not the people, the system."
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And she and and her face just lit up.
[1:54:43] She wouldn't know it because I was the
[1:54:45] one looking at her. And she just said,
[1:54:48] "Oh,
[1:54:50] I knew it was coming through." Wasn't
[1:54:52] very long she was in the tank. What is
[1:54:55] the what what what's God doing through
[1:54:57] his servants? What's God doing through
[1:54:58] the message? begins to inspect,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; examine and take down things we have
[1:55:03] such confidence in. And that is why
[1:55:05] friends, you may you may even, you know,
[1:55:08] uh uh it it may cause you to just
[1:55:13] wiggle a little bit when you hear how
[1:55:15] stern brother Bradom comes. But when you
[1:55:17] realize that he is causing a person to
[1:55:21] know what they have on the altar is not
[1:55:23] acceptable.
[1:55:25] Forgive me for just taking these few
[1:55:27] more moments.
[1:55:29] But when Cain, you can appreciate, I
[1:55:32] want you to appreciate the grace that
[1:55:33] came to you. When Cain found that his
[1:55:36] offering wasn't accepted,
[1:55:39] he was angry.
[1:55:42] See, when Esau found that he had his
[1:55:45] value and his agenda set wrong, he was
[1:55:48] angry.
[1:55:50] When Jesus came and one of the things
[1:55:54] that the Pharisees saw is that
[1:55:58] when he prayed, he had an answer. And
[1:56:01] they found a life that was accepted.
[1:56:05] And their life that they were expressing
[1:56:07] was not accepted. And when they found
[1:56:09] they weren't accepted, their sacrifice
[1:56:12] wasn't accepted, they did the same thing
[1:56:14] as their father. They became angry.
[1:56:18] Here come a messenger.
[1:56:21] Well, I hope you see what I see. Here
[1:56:24] come a messenger,
[1:56:26] little humble man
[1:56:30] with signs and the evidence that God was
[1:56:34] supporting and accepting that ministry.
[1:56:38] And when he said they say, "Is that
[1:56:40] true? Is that true? Is that true?" Every
[1:56:44] say true. and sometimes in the most
[1:56:47] difficult of people behind him and
[1:56:49] ministers and theologians and
[1:56:51] politicians and all the rest of it and
[1:56:53] some of them for they were for the gift
[1:56:55] against what he was preaching but he
[1:56:57] would just keep plowing on plowing on
[1:56:59] and to let them know there was God. He
[1:57:02] said who would know that you got cancer?
[1:57:06] He said now I wouldn't know. He said you
[1:57:07] probably came from a lot further away
[1:57:09] maybe. He said I come from Indiana and
[1:57:11] maybe you came from Florida. I don't
[1:57:13] know. We're totally two different
[1:57:15] people. we came from to how would I ever
[1:57:17] know anything about you? But if he would
[1:57:18] let me know and people were being
[1:57:20] disrespectful and he was they've been
[1:57:22] having a hard time. He says people have
[1:57:23] spirits. There are spirits and it it
[1:57:25] it's difficult and he was you know
[1:57:28] trying to correct the people gently in
[1:57:30] the midst of trying to let this woman
[1:57:33] find her place of deliverance. So then
[1:57:37] finally said well yes. He said actually
[1:57:40] he said you don't come from Florida you
[1:57:43] happen to come from New York
[1:57:46] and you have cancer.
[1:57:49] It's cancer of the breast.
[1:57:52] Says I believe it's the left breast.
[1:57:55] Is that true?
[1:57:57] I don't care who I don't care who would
[1:58:00] resist that. I don't care if a man had
[1:58:03] one twit of intelligence. He'd have to
[1:58:05] say that is a supernatural act.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; And if what comes out of his mouth is
[1:58:13] truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.
[1:58:17] When he comes to this, I would suggest
[1:58:20] it's truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.
[1:58:24] It says the angel said, "If you can get
[1:58:26] the people to believe, nothing will
[1:58:29] stand before your prayers, not even
[1:58:32] cancer."
[1:58:33] Why is he saying that? Cancer is a cell,
[1:58:36] a wild cell goes wild. And the very
[1:58:40] utterance of this message, this
[1:58:42] messenger, listen, some people, some
[1:58:44] people think, well, it was just what
[1:58:46] brother Brandham was saying. There were
[1:58:47] times he couldn't do anything because
[1:58:49] the person didn't believe. The substance
[1:58:52] is the faith. If you believe, believe
[1:58:55] that he was God's messenger. Believe
[1:58:57] that was God's voice. If you believed
[1:59:00] then you received it.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Is that being clear?
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance.
[1:59:10] And so today,
[1:59:15] if I asked across the world,
[1:59:21] who's expecting Jesus Christ to return?
[1:59:24] There'd be multitudes and millions and
[1:59:26] untold untold countless millions of
[1:59:28] people would raise their hands and
[1:59:30] include themselves. And I would say how
[1:59:33] many expect to go? There'd be untold
[1:59:35] millions, tens of millions.
[1:59:38] But I think that you will agree with me
[1:59:41] when I say this
[1:59:44] that those that are going, that act of
[1:59:47] going is the final act of redemption.
[1:59:54] He paid for the claim.
[1:59:56] He has come now to make the claim.
[2:00:00] And the claim, the claim that he makes
[2:00:02] on the individual is not our works.
[2:00:04] They're all the things that we do. It's
[2:00:06] what you have received and believed in
[2:00:09] your heart. And God looks beyond what
[2:00:12] you do. And that is why that is why oh
[2:00:15] my I could carry on. I I just don't want
[2:00:18] to. But that is why you can make a
[2:00:20] mistake, a sincere mistake. And if you
[2:00:23] sin, you have an advocate with the
[2:00:25] father. If you fall, if you slip, if you
[2:00:28] do wrong right away, but God even looks
[2:00:31] beyond the wrong. You thought something
[2:00:34] wrong, you said something wrong, you did
[2:00:36] something wrong. And God looks beyond
[2:00:39] the wrong to see if there's something
[2:00:42] bleeding on the altar
[2:00:45] and can say, "There's a token on the
[2:00:47] altar. There's blood on the altar. Who
[2:00:50] isn't making mist? Who isn't doing wrong
[2:00:52] at some point in time? I'm glad I could
[2:00:55] say in the heart there's a faith in the
[2:00:58] word. I know I declare this message came
[2:01:01] from God. And God's looking to see
[2:01:03] what's on the heart.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And faith is the substance of things
[2:01:08] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[2:01:11] seen. And so we have that kind of faith
[2:01:17] and it's anchored to the promise of this
[2:01:19] day
[2:01:21] that I've been repeating in all of the
[2:01:23] services. My final closing statements.
[2:01:28] We shall not all sleep,
[2:01:31] but we shall all be changed
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; in the moment, in the twinkling of an
[2:01:36] eye. And when you say that and a
[2:01:38] multitude of others say that and a
[2:01:40] million other people and 10 million and
[2:01:41] 100 million people say that, I can say
[2:01:44] God is going to listen beyond what is
[2:01:47] coming out of their mouth. He's going to
[2:01:49] look beyond the activity of their being.
[2:01:52] They're faithful to the church. They
[2:01:53] give of their offerings. They do. He's
[2:01:55] going to look beyond that to see what
[2:01:57] substance is on the altar.
[2:02:04] church.
[2:02:05] We've got to be a very, very, very
[2:02:08] thankful people today
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; that by the grace of God, there's a
[2:02:13] bleeding sacrifice on the altar of our
[2:02:16] heart.
[2:02:18] Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] Let's pray.
[2:02:23] Father,
[2:02:25] something has been so moving within my
[2:02:27] own
[2:02:29] soul and being.
[2:02:32] I am just so grateful to you trying to
[2:02:34] grasp
[2:02:36] not only your greatness but your grace
[2:02:40] and how it has reached down to a people
[2:02:43] in this age, in this generation.
[2:02:46] And now, oh God, we see
[2:02:49] in this end time, we see the plan, the
[2:02:52] program as it has unfolded. And we say
[2:02:57] with everything that's in us, oh God,
[2:02:59] how glorious.
[2:03:01] And I could shout out across the world,
[2:03:03] how great thou art. How wonderful are
[2:03:07] your works. How wonderful is your word
[2:03:11] to us today, Lord. And I pray that you
[2:03:14] will bless, Father, this people. Bless
[2:03:18] those that hold your word dear and have
[2:03:22] it as it were in uh just uh graced oh
[2:03:27] God in their hearts with faith believing
[2:03:30] oh Lord and just cultivating that faith.
[2:03:34] I ask that you'll bless them Lord and
[2:03:37] whatever whatever is required here today
[2:03:40] in this service.
[2:03:43] If someone needs forgiveness,
[2:03:46] may they know that the act that they
[2:03:49] require forgiveness of, God will look
[2:03:52] beyond that to see what is on the altar.
[2:03:56] God, I pray that you will do this. I
[2:04:00] pray that you will look beyond, oh God,
[2:04:02] our frailties
[2:04:05] and look beyond all of those things and
[2:04:07] see
[2:04:09] the faith when we sing only believe.
[2:04:12] It's not just a chorus we've heard maybe
[2:04:15] hundreds of times, but we are expressing
[2:04:19] and declaring something that is in our
[2:04:22] heart. God, you said you look upon the
[2:04:26] heart. I'm so glad you do. So glad you
[2:04:29] look upon our heart. I pray that you
[2:04:32] will bless father us today and the
[2:04:34] remainder of the service and this
[2:04:37] evening as we come prepared. Oh God, we
[2:04:40] dedicate this day to you. We sanctify it
[2:04:42] to you. We set it apart. Oh God, we
[2:04:45] sanctify our hearts to you. We sanctify
[2:04:47] our whole being
[2:04:50] in the lovely name of Jesus. We thank
[2:04:53] you. Amen.
[2:05:00] Hallelujah.
[2:05:03] Well, we don't have the
[2:05:08] projector today
[2:05:11] and someone else needed it more than we
[2:05:13] did, I guess.
[2:05:17] But I can sing with all my being. I am
[2:05:20] redeemed.
[2:05:23] Would you like to stand and sing it with
[2:05:25] me?
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:34] I am redeemed.
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:47] whole life.
[2:05:52] If anybody
[2:05:54] asks you
[2:05:57] who I am,
[2:06:01] tell them
[2:06:03] I am redeemed.
[2:06:10] I am redeemed.
[2:06:15] with the
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; my Jesus
[2:06:22] my whole life.
[2:06:28] If anybody
[2:06:30] asks you
[2:06:32] just who I am,
[2:06:37] tell them
[2:06:39] I am redeemed.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; I think after the service this morning
[2:06:45] and you listened so so reverently and so
[2:06:48] nice, I want you to know I appreciate
[2:06:50] that. I think now you can understand and
[2:06:53] I question whether I would say this but
[2:06:56] I think you can understand now
[2:07:00] when I say before you were lost you were
[2:07:03] actually found
[2:07:08] before we were sick there was a remedy
[2:07:14] before you were born
[2:07:16] you were born Again,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; before we needed redemption,
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; we were already redeemed.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like taking my coat
[2:07:34] off and starting to preach. Before you
[2:07:37] were born, you were born again.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:47] Well, how could that be? I can point to
[2:07:49] the time I was born again. In the mind
[2:07:52] of God, you were redeemed. If you
[2:07:54] weren't born again, how did he write
[2:07:56] your name in the book?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; In the lamb's book of life. How could he
[2:07:59] write your name in the lamb's book of
[2:08:01] life? Before the foundation of the
[2:08:03] world.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw you down through all
[2:08:07] this dilemma.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; He saw Ruth through all of her trouble.
[2:08:13] And there's nothing too hopeless for
[2:08:15] God.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God's not got anything
[2:08:21] surprising him.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would cause me to sing that
[2:08:27] course just a little bit differently.
[2:08:30] And not only I am redeemed, I was
[2:08:32] redeemed. I am redeemed.
[2:08:35] Oh, I am redeemed
[2:08:41] with a
[2:08:45] Jesus
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:48] My whole life
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:54] if anybody
[2:08:56] ask you
[2:08:58] just
[2:09:00] I am
[2:09:03] tell
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; make it a personal declaration now
[2:09:12] I am redeemed
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:20] My Jesus
[2:09:23] has saved my life.
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:29] If anybody
[2:09:32] asks you,
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:38] tell them
[2:09:41] I am redeemed.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to break out of your shell
[2:09:47] and turn around to somebody and shake a
[2:09:49] hand and tell them, "I'm redeemed."
[2:09:52] Well, what a what a combination that
[2:09:54] makes. Hallelujah.
[2:09:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:59] God bless you. I'm redeemed.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you. So nice to have you. God
[2:10:05] bless you.
[2:10:07] God bless you, my brother.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; So nice to have you. Amen. Amen. Ernie,
[2:10:16] God bless you.
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:23] Oh, I am redeemed
[2:10:28] by
[2:10:30] the
[2:10:33] Jesus.
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:41] If anybody
[2:10:44] asks you
[2:10:46] just who I am,
[2:10:51] tell them
[2:10:53] I am redeemed.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the presence of Jehovah.
[2:11:05] I believe that's where we are.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's where we are right now. in the
[2:11:10] presence of Jehovah. Let's just worship
[2:11:12] him for a few moments before we are
[2:11:14] dismissed. I'm going to ask our brother
[2:11:16] Dier if he would dismiss us in prayer
[2:11:20] in the
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:33] God mighty
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:45] trouble.
[2:11:51] Hearts are amazing
[2:11:57] in the praise.
[2:12:06] We're just going to we're just going to
[2:12:08] sing it once more. But before we do, I'd
[2:12:11] like you to just look inwardly in your
[2:12:14] own heart, your own soul.
[2:12:18] Say, "Oh God,
[2:12:20] this must be more than just expression.
[2:12:22] I want you to look beyond the
[2:12:23] expression, beyond the song, beyond the
[2:12:26] melody,
[2:12:28] beyond the words.
[2:12:30] Look down to where
[2:12:33] the incense is rising.
[2:12:37] Smelly incense. Oh God,
[2:12:41] Jehovah,
[2:12:42] I'm in your presence.
[2:12:46] Be pleased.
[2:12:51] Let me tell you something friends.
[2:12:54] When God is pleased with life, he just
[2:12:57] pours out upon you blessing after bless.
[2:13:01] We don't have to seek blessings. He just
[2:13:02] pours it out upon you
[2:13:06] in the presence.
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:19] God
[2:13:21] might
[2:13:25] prince of peace
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:44] in the presence.
[2:14:03] Father, we thank you today
[2:14:07] for allowing us once again to sit and
[2:14:10] stand in your presence, Lord,
[2:14:14] to hear the Holy Spirit anchor these
[2:14:16] things in in our hearts, in our souls
[2:14:20] to see you drive away the questions and
[2:14:22] the wonders. Bring about such a
[2:14:25] confidence in your eternal work that you
[2:14:28] have done in us. Lord, we want to return
[2:14:31] thanksgiving unto you today. For truly
[2:14:34] it has been good to sit at your feet
[2:14:36] today and hear you, Father, tenderly
[2:14:40] minister to us that you have taken care
[2:14:43] of it all. Father, you are the great
[2:14:45] kinsman redeemer, the great Boaz. Yet,
[2:14:48] oh God, this all planned, Father,
[2:14:51] already prepared that we can walk in it
[2:14:53] in this hour, be the very interpretation
[2:14:56] of your word, Father, the very thing
[2:14:59] that you held in the back part of your
[2:15:01] mind. This great secret of redemption,
[2:15:04] oh God, to see them unfold down to this
[2:15:07] very hour and see ourselves as part of
[2:15:10] the picture this morning. We just want
[2:15:12] to say thank you father. We want to
[2:15:15] bless your mighty name. We want to
[2:15:17] appreciate you oh God. We want to say we
[2:15:20] love you father because you love us
[2:15:23] first oh God to provide a sacrifice
[2:15:26] before we even oh God come to experience
[2:15:29] sin. You made a way dear God that we can
[2:15:32] find our way back home today. So we
[2:15:35] thank you dear Jesus for you are the
[2:15:37] way, the life and the truth and you have
[2:15:40] drawn us to yourself and we love you
[2:15:43] today. We just accept everything you
[2:15:45] have said today. We say yeah amen father
[2:15:48] to your word. We receive it with
[2:15:51] gladness and joy and we go father
[2:15:53] rejoicing in what you have done this
[2:15:56] morning once again by reminding us these
[2:15:59] great things that are so true. Oh God,
[2:16:02] we agree with what you have said and we
[2:16:05] thank you for your servant and your
[2:16:07] people this morning. Bless each one.
[2:16:10] Dismiss us with your benediction now and
[2:16:12] gather us again under your mighty wings.
[2:16:15] Oh God, and anoint your servant to just
[2:16:18] continue with us from this atmosphere.
[2:16:21] Father, we appreciate you in Jesus name.
[2:16:25] Amen.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Dier. And we'd ask
[2:16:30] you to greet one another with a real
[2:16:33] godly spirit this evening at 5:00. Come
[2:16:37] early and come praying and be ready for
[2:16:40] the word as our brother Lance will
[2:16:42] minister and baptisms. Hallelujah.
[2:16:45] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
