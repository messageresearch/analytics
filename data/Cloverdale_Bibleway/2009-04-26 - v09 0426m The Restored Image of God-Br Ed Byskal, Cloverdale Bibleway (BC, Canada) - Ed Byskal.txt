I I truly believe that as a witness on my heart. And uh Brother Weathers has a prayer request here for his daughter in Louisiana. She's in the hospital.

Lord, you've carried us through so many things, Father. You've kept us in the valley. You've kept us on the mountain. Father, we're so thankful for your grace this morning and your keeping power. And Father, we have needs among us this morning. And we pray, Lord Jesus, that you would move up and down each aisle, Lord. Stop at every seat, Lord. You know the very meditation of our heart, Lord, and what's on our hearts this morning. We ask for brother Codle's mother, Lord Jesus, that you would touch her, Father. Have your way in her life, Lord. We pray for little sister Lily this morning, Lord, and asking, Lord Jesus, that you would touch her, Lord, that you would curse that virus that's within her, Lord Jesus. And we'll just wait to hear the testimony of the wonderful things you're doing in her life, Lord Jesus. And now this morning, Father, we just want to quieten ourselves at your feet. this morning and hear your instruction, Lord, to know better how to come out and how to go in and how to serve you and how to please you, Lord Jesus.

We've got uh Lydia Isabelle from Florida and also Linda Wood from Ohio. May we get you to stand? just recognize you. God bless you to have you. And uh BCA has an annual spring event coming up in May. Information for uh both is on the uh bulletin board. So you can get that in the back. And also we want to make mention only one service on uh you mark this down in your leaflets of your Bible May 18th and May 25th because of the uh Victoria and Memorial weekends and due to borders and such. So that's May 18th and May 25th. We're only going to have one service. We're going to turn the service immediately to Brother Red as he comes. Let's sing that little chorus. I just want to please the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to please the Lord. Be his will in every way. to be lost in his presence. [Music] Found in his likeness to hear say well done someday. If I want to [Music] be his inst [Music] I see his presence now in his likeness. [Music] Let's just sing it once again. I just want to be the Lord. He is will be lost in his presence. found in his likeness. [Music] Actually, I requested that we would have this course sung because uh because of the line lost in his presence and found in his likeness because that's what I'm going to be coming to in a little bit. Uh maybe we'd just uh let's just sing it another uh time or two because the uh children are coming in getting settled and then I I don't want any disturbance or as little as possible because I want to show you uh video and some slides a PowerPoint uh what we just received from China and uh it is just so moving you want to see it. You want to see it prayerfully and quietly. Uh and I pray that the Holy Spirit will make it such a reality to you. Uh it's almost as though it's overtaking us, the move of God in that in that country. It's just phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. And I want to I want to share that with you because we are such a a part. We're one. It's one body. Amen. That's good. I'm just looking for that response. All right, let's just sing it again. Brother Jason plays [Music] his will every way to be lost in his presence. out in his likeness to hear him say, "Well done." Once again, I just want to be my Lord. [Music] Be in his will every way. every way to be lost in his presence. Found in your likeness to hear well done. &gt;&gt; All right, we can just have the lights dimmed and we're going to see about a six minute portion of what we just received from China. You may want to see it. [Applause] Wonderful, isn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm sure your heart is moved and as mine is. That's receiving the word of God in simplicity. That's the way we want to keep it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way we need to keep it. And so I just feel so honored, so privileged. And actually uh I'll just share something personal with you. I feel just a a wee bit deprived because they won't take any help from us. They said the Chinese Chinese print the books for the chi for China. They're just now having a meeting in a few days in May. They're expecting about 30 ministers. Hey, &gt;&gt; just short time ago we couldn't find one. They're expecting 30 ministers and they're not wanting Brother Murphy. They're not wanting anyone else. They Nobody from oversees this is Chinese for China. We have the burden. And all the renovations that went on there, they did it. They provided. And uh I think I can just tell you that uh I was I was asked uh what should we do? Because the Chinese people themselves have out of their poverty have given funds and have given their offerings to spread the message. They want to spread the message in China so urgently and so such a great burden on their heart. They have pulled together over $20,000 US and they just want to know how is the best way and look looking for some guidance from us. We've been doing it a long time and uh I just say God bless them. &gt;&gt; My prayers are with them. Our prayers are with them and I know that as your heart is touched and moved, you won't forget tomorrow to pray for them in the coming days and they don't know when the authorities or difficulties will come. They already have financial difficulties, all kinds of things like that, but they don't know when they may, you know, be uh even taken or imprisoned or whatever more. and that and and so while we sit here in this freedom and comfort, let's not take it for granted. Let's thank God we can hear be here and do this. Can you say amen to that? Let's stand and let's let's let's sing what they were singing. Uh &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. God ever true. Let's just join with them and sing that changing me. changing you. We have love with open heart. Oh, let the word of God. Word of God ever. Changing me, changing you. We have come with all their heart. Oh, let the word of God. Let's just bow in prayer. Our heavenly father, you are indeed our father and we have been uh instructed by our lord Jesus Christ to come and we approach you. Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. This is our prayer. We pray you'll forgive us our wrong. Forgive us our failings. Forgive us our sin or anything that may stain the garment of righteousness. Remove it from us. I pray by a supernatural cleansing. May the washing of the water of the word remove anything that would prevent you or hinder you or grieve you. remove it from us, oh God. And I pray that you will move upon with a sweep, a fresh sweep of the Holy Holy Spirit of God within the congregation. Oh God, I pray that they will receive instruction and we will receive it with open heart. Oh God, speak, Father, and we're prepared to say, and now and thy servant heareth it. You speak and we will do. For your prophet has said, "If we do not do the word, if we do not do it, then we don't believe it." We are here as believers, oh God, to believe your word, use, oh God, I pray, the vessel now as I stand behind the pullpit to deliver what you have placed upon my heart and may it be received into good ground and bring forth a hundfold. I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you. If you'd like to take your Bible and read along uh with me, please. I'm going to be reading from Genesis the first chapter, very familiar, verses 26, 27, and then into the second chapter. We'll read a few selected verses as well. May God bless us as we read. Genesis 1:26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. Genesis 2. Then in verse 7. And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the earth of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. and man became a living soul. Verses 21 uh down to 24. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh there instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his own wife, and they shall be one flesh." May God bless his word as you have your seat. The Bible is a really a sphere. It's more than a sphere. It's also a it's a spiritual uh it's a spiritual universe. If you took your Bible and joined the front and the back together such as I have, you have in the beginning a creation of a heaven and an earth. And in the back you have a creation of a heaven and an earth. In the beginning you have a garden with a river flowing down through it. And then the in the end you have a a garden as it is a new creation with the river of life flowing down through it. In the first in the Genesis you have the tree of life in the midst of the garden. And in Revelation you have the tree of life again in the midst of the garden. In the in the beginning of the Bible, Genesis, you have man in the image of God. And in the end of the Bible, you have man once again in the image of God. &gt;&gt; You have man united with his wife, his bride, in the beginning of the word, and you have man with his wife, his bride, in the end of the book as well. Jesus Christ and his bride. And so it is completely a cycle. It's a circle. It's a universe, a spiritual universe within itself. And then you have Satan using the serpent in the beginning. So he uses that serpent which God had created uh a creature and Satan using him and through that he destroyed the image of God. And then then you have God destroying the image that Satan used because the serpent was not found anymore. The missing link if you would. So, brother Brandham said, "Changed his entire structure. You can't find him anymore because God destroyed that image." Satan had d is set out now to destroy God's image and and that was the beginning of it. Then in the end in the book of Revelation, you'll find the beast and the image to the beast. And then the scripture speaks of that God takes that and destroys it completely and casts it into a lake of fire &gt;&gt; and it'll be no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says Satan took advantage of the serpent's physical uh characteristics to use him to beguile Eve. Then God destroyed the pattern of the serpent. No other beast can co-ingle with man but the affinity is there. That's a very very interesting part in the it's a paragraph 102 in the church ages and it describes how even the cells in the human body they can take a I don't want to really get into this but some of you may have been wondering about it has been mentioned over the pulpit before they can take the cells of a of a unborn fetus from an animal if they take the cells from the stomach or from uh the bladder or from the liver and they take those cells because they're pure and they're strong and they're healthy and they can inject them into a human being and the cells from that part of the body of the animal will go to that part that very organ of the human being and they have done it. And furthermore, brother uh one of the pastors our our brother Nelson Guy his wife was very very sick and uh and there was a in just across the border in Mexico. There's a hospital that was uh that was originated with a German scientist doctor and they practice that very thing. Many of the wi rich and the wealthy go there and if cancer is not too far gone they will take an inject. They take them through a procedure and inject the cells uh where the cancer is and they take the cells from even an animal unborn fetus and inject them into human and those cells will go to that part of that body. And brother Brandham in that paragraph 102 you can read in the church ages he speaks specifically of that and he says and he proves that there is an affinity between animal life and the human life, the the man life. There's an affinity between the two because there was an intelligence in it in the first place. And so God destroyed the serpent which Satan had used because now he attacked the very image of God and the and the whole plan and program of God. So I want to speak to you today on the restored image of God. Brother Brandham says that God would not leave his masterpiece laying there in the dirt and the dust. But he began immediately to begin to rebuild his image once again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a sculptor we have. &gt;&gt; What a artisan. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing that God is doing. And so Eve because she doubted one word. She doubted one word and he says Satan misrepresented it to Eve caused her to doubt one word and threw the whole human race into fallen chaos. And although we're in the midst of that chaos today, I can tell you that we are also in the midst of the complete restoration of the image of God. God cannot be defeated. His program cannot be derailed. Whether you see it or whether it is happening according to the way you have set things out, that's irrelevant. I can tell you that God's word will not fail. &gt;&gt; God's program is right on track. &gt;&gt; And I want to be part of it &gt;&gt; sincerely. We want to be part of it. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have church service. We're here to move forward in this great plan of God &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the eldest that's in this building and hearing my voice today. That's why we're that's why we have been caught by the Holy Ghost, by the spirit of God in this day because we're part of a larger program. And this is what is taking place in the message. All things are possible. I'm on this this part. Eve doubted one word. He said Eve doubted the word of God. And when Satan and when Satan met Jesus said offspring of Eve, the woman's seed, not that he was direct offspring of her physical seed, but it was the promised seed where God said the seed of the woman. and he used the same technique as he did to Eve when they when Satan approached Jesus in the wilderness and uh tried to get him to doubt one word of God. Now then uh I'm just giving a a number of quick quotes also out of the Ephesians church age. He said God destroyed the pattern of the serpent. So he destroyed that image and uh and uh eliminated it from uh from the entire creation. It doesn't exist anymore. Now he began immediately to restore his uh image and the crowning act of God. The crowning act of creation in the scripture is God making man in his image. I want to just we read it so often. I want you to ponder this very very deeply and I would like to impress it upon you as I felt it impressed upon myself. Let us make man in our image. uh in a very early service, brother Brandham makes reference that I've often wondered about that scripture, but he makes reference to that very uh phrase and he goes back to God, a great being in the beginning and out from him came the logos which was the son which was the anointing which was the became the son of God eventually in flesh. And he said it was he said it was after that logos came out that the logos proceeded from God. He said let us make man in our image. So God created man in his image. In the image of God created he him. He was in the image of God. &gt;&gt; He bears his image. I'm not talking about five fingers on each hand and 10 toes. That's not what I'm talking about. Ears and a nose and so on. That may have certainly something to do with that. But the image of God because Adam was not formed out of the soil of the earth, out of the dust of the earth when this had happened. So God created man in the image of God created he him. So I will just say he is the image. &gt;&gt; The man is the image. The man in this form is the image. Male and female, masculine and feminist created he them. &gt;&gt; They are in the image of God. and that trace and even though after this crowning act of God having man in his image, then the fall, then the chaos, the sin, the hatred, the murder, and man began his his his journey into darkness. But he could not lose that trace. He could not lose that essence of that stamp regardless of where he went. Now, I'm going to say some things that maybe you just have to think about because I'm thinking about them myself. God is not responsible to have everything that came forth now through the natural process of human reproduction. When a person is born, a child is born into the world and takes that breath of life, that is not the breath that God breathed into Adam. Amen. &gt;&gt; That breath that breath of life that is a spiritual and I'm going to now give some quotes on it in a few minutes that that he became a living soul. He was already brother Brandham says clearly he was already breathing before he breathe breathed them. He was already breathing. He was already a living being before but he was a spirit. God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? and Adam with masculine feminine uh qualities. He was a spirit man. &gt;&gt; He said there's only one form of eternal life. This is in leadership, his last service. And it's very I'm very impressed by brother Brandham's last services. And I guess you know that the rapture things that are to be modern events made clear by the prophecy and leadership. In leadership he began to speak in uh in in 1965 and in these last services is where he emphasized re-emphasized the gene of God. The gene because you are a gene of your father. the gene that you came from which is a carrier of the uh characteristics and perhaps the nature and certain instincts but he said here that there's only one form of eternal life and that comes from God and he forained every creature that would ever have it. So not every creature has it but every creature that would have it. It came from God. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, these things are fundamental, uh, Brother Biscll." Well, that's fine. But I want to put it in the order that he put it in because it clears up a lot of questions for us. So, there's only one form of eternal life. Not just one form of life, but only one form of eternal life, and that comes from God. He forained every creature that would ever have it. That was for ordained. So not everyone that would come into human existence and have human life and natural life has that life. &gt;&gt; He said just as you were now here's the example just as you were that's all of us and that's every person were the gene of your father you were a gene of God as you were a gene of your father you were a gene of God. one of his attributes to begin with or you'll never be there. You come forth in the bedding ground of your mother. So he's going from the natural to the spiritual and from the natural to the spiritual. You were you came forth in the bedding ground of your mother. Your father didn't know you. You were in his loins. And when you came forth in the bedding ground of the mother, then you became a human being and you are made in the image of your father. Isn't this marvelous? Is the last servicemen. &gt;&gt; Isn't this fantastic? &gt;&gt; He's he's going to be leaving now. And he's telling the people, you are a gene in your father, &gt;&gt; humanly speaking. But as you were a gene in your father, you were a gene in God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Your father didn't know you. Our heavenly father did. &gt;&gt; He designed us. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what we would be like. Our earthly father didn't. And the seed had to come into a certain bedding ground. And then we came forth of our mother and we were in the image of our father. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now you can fellowship with him." And the same thing and the same thing by God if you've got eternal life. &gt;&gt; And if you have that eternal life, that imprint of God, that image, that determination by God that you will be part of the image of God. You'll be part of this restoration. There's no devil. There's no darkness, not even Satan himself can stop that from happening. There is no way. You may not understand the the sculpting work or the molding work of God. You may not understand what happens in your life because there isn't a human. I began to have became uh much more uh you know self-discovery and all of these things which take place today. people trying. I don't care how old you are or how intellectual or how keen or how sharp or how whatever you are. There's no one that can really fully understand their own selves. &gt;&gt; You can't sometimes you can't even sort out your own feelings. You can't sort out what your plan is or what you should be doing in the future. you you're you're you're having to exercise some faith and trust in somebody and somebody calls it fate and somebody calls it you know they don't have any uh they don't have any program just take it as it comes uh that all of that is irrelevant to me but the believer God who gave eternal life to every son and daughter of his he knows everyone &gt;&gt; he knows every single one And he will not lose one. &gt;&gt; He will bring everyone. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter from what country you are in, what culture you have come from or where you may be. He doesn't. It makes no difference. Irrelevant. It's totally irrelevant what the conditions of the nation is or the economy is or the wickedness it's in. There isn't enough wickedness to cover the seed of God. There's not enough darkness that his word cannot dispel. &gt;&gt; There isn't enough false doctrine, whether it be a Hutterite colony or a denomination or anything else, can hold back God's life from coming for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of where you were born or the kind of family you came in, there's not enough complexes &gt;&gt; that you can acquire &gt;&gt; that can hinder. It may hinder, but it cannot hold back the program of God. &gt;&gt; There's not enough reversals in life. There's not enough disease. There's not enough sickness. There's not enough uh uh of any form of trial or persecution that can stop the word of God from bringing forth the full image of Christ. Once again, &gt;&gt; he said the life that you came in, the natural life, physical life, that was by your father. The only way you can come born again is the only way it is. It has to come from the heavenly father. His attributes. Then he quotes the scripture. All all that the father has given me will come &gt;&gt; to me &gt;&gt; he said you are here because your name was placed on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before there was even a foundation of the world and that's exactly right &gt;&gt; you're a spiritual jane &gt;&gt; it would be good if you could confess this publicly. Even though it may sound strange, I am a spiritual gene. &gt;&gt; I've come out from my heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You came here to give light to the word &gt;&gt; because you are a word person. &gt;&gt; You are a word being. And you've come at this time to manifest and give light to the word that you're part that you're allotted. You have been allotted. And that is the forming and the fashioning of God making his own image. Creating his own image. To make let us make man is to not only to fashion but is to accomplish it. In other words, God's not going to leave this half done. &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave this just partially finished. He's going to complete it. &gt;&gt; And I want to move you away far from your own thoughts and your own estimation of where you are and who you are and how you think you're doing and so on because you haven't even got a clue whether God considers it being successful or not. I can give you this Bible is a record of a lot of people who thought things were going backwards. It was right on God's program. People thought they were in the depths of famine, in the depths of despair. They were facing death, the cruelty, imprisonments, and all kinds of things. And they were right in God's program. And on the other hand, Moses was in the palace of the Pharaohs. Daniel was next to uh Nebuchadnezzar. Others were in great high places. But and and you might have think, well, what am I doing here when my brothers and sisters out here dying in a famine or under persecution? They were both right in God's program. &gt;&gt; The people in China, they may be out of their meager, very little meager existence, but the spirit of God is in them forming the image of God. And you may be here sitting on plus seats and fine and uh air conditioning is just fine and you're baptized in water that's just the right temperature and they're in zero uh uh being watched and and whatever more. But all I can say is we're in God's program &gt;&gt; and we're to be what we're to be to help who we can to send the light wherever we can. And that's why God has given you what he's given you. It's not just for us to sit on and us to enjoy and have a great big old high life. That's not the plan. We're in the kingdom of God. We're here with God's program. &gt;&gt; And we're God's program is I'm going to build up and present my image again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even without the deterrence of this flesh anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let this flesh pass off the scene. And I say even while we're here in this body of flesh, let the Holy Ghost take control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost in the soul. Let the word this morning come to the soul. Rise up through the channels. Take control of the spirit, your emotions, your reasoning, your memory. Oh, your memory. Let the Holy Ghost take charge of your memory. &gt;&gt; Some of us need a Holy Ghost watching of your memory. It's plaguing your spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost wash out your memory, &gt;&gt; your conscience, &gt;&gt; your reasoning, &gt;&gt; your imagination. &gt;&gt; Don't imagine where you are spiritually. Move there in reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To fashion and to accomplish, to produce it. Let us make man and to attend to it. Not just to do it and leave it and and move away from it, but to attend to it. Oh, I love thinking about how God gave promise to his first his first man that he gave promise to Abram. And then Abram for 25 years he went. But you know where God was? Right with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've mentioned this a number of times before, but you know that during that 25 years, nations rose and kings rose and kings died and great armies came and moved over the earth and faded away and the Bible doesn't even speak about it. Economies went this way and that way, went sideways and whatever more. Rich man came, rich man disappeared, kings came, kings fell away and and and yet the Bible talks about Abraham that he moved over here &gt;&gt; and every little every little thing that happened to Abraham. God details it and he moved over there for 25 years. All God did was just follow Abraham. &gt;&gt; What? He's following his promise. &gt;&gt; He's following the man who's holding it. He's following the man who believes him. Yes, &gt;&gt; this man believes me. &gt;&gt; That's always it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The image was destroyed by doubt. &gt;&gt; And now the image is being built up by believing. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's critical. If you believe today or if you only take a haphazard, well maybe so it won't work. But you must believe &gt;&gt; with all your heart. You must believe the word &gt;&gt; as it's presented to us. And then God attends to it. He puts it in order. He ordains it. He says in the in the image of God created he him. And the word creation in the Hebrew is of new conditions and new circumstances, something new. That's why it's called a new birth because you come into a whole new realm. the things you used to do and live for and the things that were so important to you disappear because a new creation. You're a new creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wish I could stand on the rooftop and maybe I don't need to. It's probably just as well here. Let the internet be the rooftop. &gt;&gt; Take it off wherever it's supposed to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the things we used to be right, &gt;&gt; you might say, "Well, I got some of those things still hanging on to me." Well, I'm going to give you a remedy here in a few minutes &gt;&gt; towards the end of the service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, the first man that was perfectly created in God's image, and I will say the image was him. &gt;&gt; He was the image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to announce to you, you are packing the image. &gt;&gt; You may feel that you fail miserably at times, whatever more. Everybody goes through that, but you are packing the image. &gt;&gt; God's not going to put the image there, take the image out, put the image there, take the image out, work on it a while, so it's not working. &gt;&gt; That's not what he's going to do. Wherever he put that image, where that's a part of his that's a part of his own being, a part of his own life, part of his own breath, part of his own genes, however we want to say it. There's a lot of words we can use that really all are on parallel. All say the same thing. You're predestinated. How can you be predestinated if you haven't got a a gene of God, &gt;&gt; a gene of his spiritual life? If you have that, are you convinced you have it? &gt;&gt; There's no way you can lose. There's no way. That's not me saying that. That's the Bible saying God's not going to take it back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The image of God is an intrinsic. It is a uh an act of God that has become a part of you. You were born with it. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're born with it. Not in your natural human birth. But when you came forth in the natural human birth, you possessed it &gt;&gt; because of God's forordained program. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, are some born without it?" God's not under obligation to answer us or to answer to anybody else. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, what about these poor people? What about Okay, what about the people that reject God? What about them? Is it Is it wrong that God could know before the fact or does God Almighty What kind of a God does the world have that only discovers after the fact? To me, that's not God. &gt;&gt; Says people, they die rejecting God. And God is grieved and he's sorry. What? Now, I found out that they they died doubting me. They died rejecting me. They refused my salvation. And and I had to wait until they died to find out. &gt;&gt; That's not my kind of God. &gt;&gt; So God knew by the it says by fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that word. By fornowledge he predestinated. So he knew what a person was going to do. And he knew who was going to receive him. He knew who was his. So he put that seed there. He stapped that image there. And there's no way it can't happen. &gt;&gt; That is more certain than the fact you're breathing air at this moment. &gt;&gt; God's image is more certain than your human image. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and the first man that he created was spirit man &gt;&gt; and he was in the image and in the likeness of God and then he put this man in flesh and man fell. So then God came down and become the image of man. Isn't that wonderful? that he might redeem the fallen man. &gt;&gt; And that's the real gospel story. He said to my opinion &gt;&gt; in blasphemous names. He said, "But what God did, listen to this very closely now. But what God did, he breathed the breath of eternal life. Then he become a living soul, a soul that can't die. &gt;&gt; Notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils. &gt;&gt; And he became, that's Adam, he became a an eternal soul because God breathed. He said, "Not what nature done, &gt;&gt; not what nature, not what came by nature, but but what God did." &gt;&gt; Breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul. So I am making a very clear distinction between what God breathed and what nature did. You come naturally into the world and a human spirit. A human spirit contacts. A human spirit enters that body and when it takes his last breath the human spirit departs. Where does it go? I I don't know. Maybe suppose God receives it. goes back to God who perhaps gave that spirit. I don't know. But I do know one thing that the human spirit because now the people that stood in front of the prophet of God just to show you that God's in control of all things, he would say, "I'm trying to contact your spirit. I'm trying to contact your spirit." Never said, "I'm trying to contact your soul. I'm trying to contact your spirit." and he would make contact with that spirit. But that does not mean that that spirit was the result of the breath of God &gt;&gt; because multitudes of those people rejected the very word of God, &gt;&gt; rejected the Holy Spirit, rejected the presence of the pillar of fire. They were interested in being healed. They were interested in having some benefit from God, but they rejected the word of God and they rejected the author. &gt;&gt; You understand? So the the the spirit of God can't reject the very word he wrote. &gt;&gt; And that was the conundrum. That was the the irreconcilable thing in his ministry because there were people speaking in tongues and having a great time and having all kinds of you know uh spine tingling experiences and oh God spoke to me and I saw a flash of fire and I had this kind of experience and so on and then speak the word of God and they deny it. So, it's not it's not that their spirit wasn't anointed. Their spirit was actually anointed and they did actually receive gifts gifts of the Holy Spirit, but it did not it does not confirm it does not declare that their spirit was the breath of God. What I'm saying is that the breath of God is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? The breath of God is eternal life. &gt;&gt; God breathed in eternal life. He won't take it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it isn't that he breathes eternal life into all humanity and then they die rejecting him and he takes it back. That's not the plan. That's not the program. Never has been, never will be. male and female created he them. Then he said he breathed into them. And he goes on in blasphemous names and says the church is the mystical body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Born of the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Who's born of the breath of God? The church. The body of Christ. The mystical body of Christ. Why is it mystical? This isn't mystical. We that are all seated here because we can see one another and there's no mystery to it. But that which you cannot see in one another. &gt;&gt; That's what bears the image of God, the imprint of God. And that's what God is cultivating. That's what he's working on. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's still working on me. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's the mystical body of Christ born of the breath of God. And the church of God is born of the breath of God. God breathed into the nostrils spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, of Adam, spiritually of Adam. And he became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, Adam, it's not good that he should be alone. I will make same words as he did for the man. I will make for him and help for him. Same as was spoken for Adam. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, he made a woman and brought her unto the man. And when it uses the word now he made, I will make for him. He used the same as he did for Adam. Let us make man. Now he uses the same for the woman. I will make. But then he says, so he made. And the word made is quite different. This is to build, to rebuild, to establish, to cause, to continue. I will make him a wife to reestablish, to rebuild, to restore, to bring back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. to bring back a a people in whom will be the imprint of the image and I'll build again. So through that he brought people who believed. &gt;&gt; Enoch believed God. &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God. &gt;&gt; Moses believed God. &gt;&gt; Joshua believed God. &gt;&gt; Caleb believed God. Samuel believed God. &gt;&gt; David believed God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophets believed God. &gt;&gt; And God was building his image back again. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know how you can sit there without rejoicing. &gt;&gt; The apostles believed God &gt;&gt; and by believing the image kept coming up and kept coming up. Some of them were foundation stones as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Foundation stones to the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says God believed his own word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The messengers believed God in in spite of the opposition. &gt;&gt; In spite of the persuasion and the pressure. Can you imagine the pressure the messenger came under in this day? pressures of finance &gt;&gt; here. He's got, you know, we've got a little church here to uh to be concerned about and they're having tens of thousands of people. How are you going to pay the bill? How you going to continue with this? I I I'm glad, you know, I learned a few lessons from brother Brandham and one was this is God's work. &gt;&gt; He's got to support it. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't support it, then it's not worth being supported. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then ministers were saying if I preached that I' I'd be uh uh they kicked me out of my church, said I'd sooner eat crackers and soda water &gt;&gt; and crackers than to have a good position or a good church and and not preach the full council of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say you'll ruin your ministry. I heard it just the other day where he was quoting, "You'll ruin your ministry." And I have a good idea who it was that was counseling. Brother Brandham says you've been called to pray for the sick. people consider you a prophet and you'll ruin your ministry. He said if preaching the word of God will ruin a person's ministry, that ministry needs to be ruined. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And after the fall and through the through the serpent coming to the woman, after the fall, the image was shattered, was broken. But yet God could never be uh deterred from his program. Does God ever change his mind about his word? In that message, he says just like at the beginning, it was not God's perfect will. The reason I'm going back and forth, maybe move forward and then I come back and and and catch a little bit more and repeat the same things is because I'm coming to perhaps certain quotes. Sometimes brother Brandon will cover several things that uh I want to bring to you but then it comes in I want it in his order. So he said uh just like at the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the earth through sex. So we all came here that way. Not God's perfect will. That is why God's not obliged or obligated to breathe eternal life into children that came not by his perfect will. &gt;&gt; He allowed it. He permitted it. But it was not his perfect will. &gt;&gt; That is why one person can sit and hear that word and they say that's life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another person hears the same word and says, "Oh, I can't I can't go with that." &gt;&gt; One person hears it and it's from God. Next person hears it, he said, "It's of the devil." &gt;&gt; You can't get further apart than that. I trust you're here because you believe this message came from God. &gt;&gt; I believe that's why you're here. I have confidence in you. You're here. You stuck it out. You stayed with it. Things have gone sideways perhaps for you, gone in reverse. All kinds of things have happened, but still you held to it. It wasn't you holding to it. It was God holding on to you. &gt;&gt; God will never let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't his perfect will. They said, "God created man out of the dust of the earth, breathed the breath of life into him, and he became a living soul. He took from that man a helpmate and made him a wife to him." That was God's first and original will. But when sin came in and did the thing that it did, then he permitted man to marry a wife legally and have children by her, multiply and replenish the earth if that's the way you're going to do it. But you see, it never was his perfect will. So I think that's clear. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I have here there's not enough fallen angels because there was untold numbers of angels that fell and they became disobedient and they followed Lucifer and they're present today. &gt;&gt; They're here in the Pacific Northwest. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; They're in all the cities of the world. &gt;&gt; They're in every educational institution. &gt;&gt; They're in every government. &gt;&gt; They're there to influence &gt;&gt; to make suggestions, to have political power. &gt;&gt; That wasn't enough. Then it would get into the church and those angels that knew everything about worship would get into the word and began to teach and interpret the word to people and to ministers and to leaders and to whatever more in order to make and mastermind the greatest deception that ever was on the earth. But in the midst of all of that, there's a group of people that could not be deceived. There's a group of people who took the stand and said that's not right. That is not according to the message of the hour. And that group of people, God keeps forming and molding them. And the image of God keeps coming up right in the midst of Satan's Eden. The image of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where Satan began to rear up his his image in God's Eden. Now God is rearing up his image in Satan's Eden. and nothing can prevent it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what state a person is in. If they're a solid believer, God's image is imprinted upon you and you can never escape it. &gt;&gt; That's why believers that backslide, they're the most miserable of people &gt;&gt; because you can't fit in the world. &gt;&gt; Have you been there? &gt;&gt; I have. can't fit. &gt;&gt; You cannot fit in the world. &gt;&gt; You can't even fit with your peers. &gt;&gt; You can't even feel at home. &gt;&gt; And you go into a bar or you go into some place of worldly entertainment and you say, "What am I doing here?" &gt;&gt; You can try to immerse yourself in that dark world and it won't work. because of you have the imprint of God upon your life. There's only one place you can go and that's only one place you can go is come back to the very word of God because this is what's in you. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That is God's truth. &gt;&gt; God's familiar with darkness. The earth was covered with darkness that never stopped. didn't even for a moment stop the word of God from coming and the spirit of God moving over on and and and saying let there be light &gt;&gt; and light came &gt;&gt; and light is more powerful than darkness and darkness began to dissipate. You came into the world in a darkened state, but the son of righteousness rose with healing in his wings and cast light upon your soul and dispel the darkness and all that it brings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I remember some years ago when they had a lot of the hippie movement and uh drug world was becoming very popular and people especially young people were tired of a powerless religion. &gt;&gt; They were tired of what materialism had done. So they rebelled against materialism. So we don't want anything to do with it. I'll tell one on a good friend that's sitting here in the congregation today. He won't mind. And if he does mind, he'll have to forgive me. Brother Don Alexander. I don't know if you know, I understand he actually worked in a bank one time. He's a teller in the bank or worked in the bank and uh Brother Roger Smith was and we were just in the house and and the young people would give their offering. I don't even know how we handled it then. We may have had a box at the back. I don't even know. It wasn't a big issue. And uh Brother Roger came to me one day and he says, "Uh, brother Don needs $5." Okay. What? What's he need? $5 for? Well, he says he needs a I think he needs a cap and a pair of socks or something. I said, "Well, he's working. Why didn't he just go and buy it?" No, he said he doesn't he just can't stand having any money. He said, "When he gets his check, he just throws it in the offering. Then when he needs anything, he comes to me and says, "I need $5." Is too big a hassle to worry about the money and everything. They just kicked it over. All kinds of young people. We would have a c we'd have a crowd and there was three cars in the parking lot and two of them were mine. And some of the stuff I don't think I don't think the scrapyard would accept it cuz they rebelled against it. You know why? They said doesn't work. Materialism doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Politics doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Money doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Religion doesn't work. We've had enough of it. Had it right up to here. But then the word came. Oh, the word came. Hallelujah. No wonder the messenger could announce it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day. He said that first rising was wonderful. But this rising, &gt;&gt; this dual rising, when the son of son of God came out of the tomb and you and I with him, &gt;&gt; if you just say Jesus rose, that's only part of the story. &gt;&gt; If you're going to say everything, say everything he said. Jesus rose, but you rose with him. &gt;&gt; You were there in the genes of God, and your body was laying on the earth at that moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were there, young fellas. &gt;&gt; Your body was laying right in the dust. This body is sitting here in this seat, young ladies, brothers and sisters, the body you're sitting in, the body you uh dressed up this morning, that body was laying in the earth, &gt;&gt; the day the son of righteousness, Jesus Christ, rose out of the tomb. Why? Corruption couldn't take him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he was the perfect image of God. [Applause] in bridegroom form. &gt;&gt; And in him yet was a bride. &gt;&gt; And her spirit, the spirit of her was separated, literally separated from him &gt;&gt; at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And that spirit came down into that first believers on the day of Pentecost. And the church was born. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. the church was born. Why were they there? They were believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was seen of above 500. Above 500, more than 500. He was seen of more than 500 to be a good part of this congregation this morning. And Jesus showed himself by many infallible proofs &gt;&gt; that he was raised from the dead. He who suffered and hung on died upon Calvary and the people saw him and everybody in Palestine knew it &gt;&gt; and now he was seen alive by over 500 and he told them to go to Jerusalem Terry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power and go and wait there. Don't go don't dis be dispersed and don't go preaching this excited excitement message but go and tarry &gt;&gt; 120 &gt;&gt; 120 were numbered &gt;&gt; I ask how in the world did 380 miss that &gt;&gt; how would you like to have been one of the 380 on the day of Pentecost when They came out staggering like drunk men and women and uttering and speaking in other languages, not just unknown tongues. That's not correct. They the Bible says, "How hear we every man in our own tongue." Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody that comes to you with the Pentecost that they impose upon the people today that speaking speaking a lot of unknown things there is perhaps those uh tongues of men and of angels but that what they're saying is what happened on the day of Pentecost is not so on the day of Pentecost how here we every man in our own tongue and listen to this now because brother Brandham related to me and really cleared up a lot of things for himself. He said they were Galileans. Most of the people there who spoke, they spoke Galilean. He said if it was here, it would be English. And if the Holy Spirit, let's say maybe they came from Russia, they came from Germany, they came from uh Brazil, they came from Africa, and they spoke different languages. And they were all gathered for this great feast. But most of the people were Galileans. And here they came out speaking in these languages. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost. And brother Brandham said to me, "Did anybody who spoke Galilean hear in their own tongue?" And I said, "Well, yeah, there would have to be in order for the scripture to be correct. How here we every man in our own tongue." So he said they were all Galileans who were filled with the Holy Ghost. Did the Galileans hear in their own tongue? I said yes. He said they also were filled with the Holy Ghost. There could be people speaking English and they come out preaching English. I'm preaching English. If I spoke in some unknown tongue now, as Apostle Paul said, your mind would be unfruitful. You wouldn't know what I'm saying. But God by the same Holy Spirit can takes the individual and fill them with the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; and they speak the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But where were the 380? &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't want to have been one and stand on the sidelines and say, "My goodness, what in the world was I doing for the last 10 days?" &gt;&gt; Right? What was I doing the other day when the Holy Spirit came down and and licks a fire appeared upon them? I was out fixing my car. &gt;&gt; I was out scrubbing my camel. &gt;&gt; I thought it was so important. &gt;&gt; My wife was busy doing the laundry, cleaning the carpet because it was just bothering her so bad. The house is in such a mess. the tent, wherever it was, and somehow our priorities got twisted. &gt;&gt; You see, you hear me preaching and you think, "Oh, but if I heard it out of the lips of Jesus Christ, don't you fool yourself." &gt;&gt; You could hear William Brham, you could hear uh uh Apostle Paul, you could hear Moses, you could hear Jesus Christ himself. And there are some people it wouldn't click with them. It wouldn't make any difference with them. They go out and live exactly the same. I say to you, in the name of the Lord, it's not Apostle Paul or William Brham or Jesus Christ. It's that you recognize God has unveiled his word for the purposes of building up and molding my life into the image of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; into this image of God. That's the purpose. and everything else should come subject to it. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just go on just a little bit a little bit uh shorter and then I'm going to I'm not going to keep you late in the masterpiece message. Well, let me just go back because I said that uh that Adam and Eve then in the fallen state began to bring forth children. And the Bible says that that Adam knew his wife again, and she brought forth a man and called his name Seth. For God said, she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew. And then it says, "And to Seth, to him also was born a son." You see, now the the human not according to God's perfect will, but God permitted it. And to Seth was born a son, and they called his name Enos. And then began man to call upon the name of the Lord. Something happened &gt;&gt; when Enos came. Then man man began to call on the name of the Lord. In the masterpiece message, brother Brandham says, "But the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family, the masterpiece, he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down in ruin." He went immediately to build it up again. &gt;&gt; He wasn't willing that it should perish. lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; I know that you agree with that and I know that you say uh in agreement amen. Remember that amen tomorrow. Remember that amen when everything goes so in reverse you wonder. remember it when Satan comes your way and asks you if you're even a believer &gt;&gt; because I know he does. &gt;&gt; If you think that you're actually going to go in the rapture because I know that he does say that. And when you become like it's overwhelmed with a wave of this modern society, say, "Oh God, help me to find my balance. &gt;&gt; Help me to keep on course. Yes. &gt;&gt; Help me to stay away and shun these things that try to deter me and distract me and derail me. &gt;&gt; Help me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to make a statement to you in a few minutes. I want to enforce it. And that is God, listen closely now. God does not expect you to mold yourself. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the potter. &gt;&gt; We are the clay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, what do I need to do then? Brother says, "Man is always wanting something to do." The only thing that the scripture really calls on you to do is resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Resist the wrong and yield to the spirit of God. Yield to the service you're hearing this morning. Yield to the Holy Ghost. Yield to the word. And he will speak. It may be a still small voice as I spoke on a few weeks ago, but he will speak. And he will say the same thing every time. Then you yield to that. And as you yield, then the potter takes over. &gt;&gt; As you submit yourself and surrender yourself. Are you with me? Are you listening? &gt;&gt; As you surrender, God does the molding. &gt;&gt; He does the shaping. &gt;&gt; And you'll find that things that were not pleasing to your inner self, to your soul. You'll find that those things are being formed out of you. And the image of God is coming forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not just preaching to you. I've experienced these things &gt;&gt; and many of you have as well. I say to this congregation in all respect and with a great deal of sincerity. You need to be certain that when you have a desire that leads you to a decision, when you have uh something that may be a conviction to you, real strong conviction, when you determine I need to say something, I need to speak it. I need to say it. I'm going to go to that person. I'm going to say something. You want to make absolutely certain that the pattern that the pattern is a pattern of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. &gt;&gt; You know, I I get I get letters, I get emails, I get phone calls, and generally when people I'm not even speaking to this congregation at this moment, but I get them from all over and they say, "This has happened, that has happened, etc., etc., and I'm I'm thinking about doing this or I'm making a decision to do that." Sometimes it's a physical movement. Sometimes it's, you know, I'm in a kind of a marital situation. and I think I should do this, I should do that. And the one thing that I do is make absolutely certain not only that brother Brandham said it, because often I will have people say, "Well, Brother Brandham said this and then he said this and he said that." And so when they tie these things together, they come up with an obvious conclusion of what they should do. But when when I examine what it is they're going to do, I say that's not something that brother Brandham ever did. You might So it's not to put it simply to you, this is this is one of my f foundation criteria for my life. It's not only what he said, but it's what he did. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gen. You may come to a conclusion or even belief. I've listened to brothers that have put together the message and so articulated the word. So the prophet said this and this quote and this and connect them all together and and when they finally get out to the end, this is the obvious conclusion. And that conclusion is what becomes their pillar doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they spend all of their time and all of their energies preaching that conclusion. And I talked to some brothers and I'm glad to say they've actually turned away from that. But I spoke to them and I said, "The only did you ever read this?" He said, "Did you ever read this uh track that I put together?" It was all quotes. And I said, "Yes." And the first thing I did, I said, "I put the dates of everything that was said beside it." And I said, 'You know as well as I do that the message was a progressive message. Brother Brandham said in the seals, he said, oh, he said, I was in some old notes. He said, if I would have said, you know, if I would have said that, he said, I would have been so wrong, but today that pillar fire came. Today, Holy Spirit came. Aren't we thankful for that? &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a progressive message. &gt;&gt; He said, I was, you know, going even by some notes by by some that he had read and whatever more. It was a progressive. He said, "You watch that thus sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not opening the door and saying, "Oh, that we have to, you know, be a law unto ourselves." That's not what I'm saying. But I'm saying the I believe that the Holy Spirit, you see, even now you as parents, you may you may come to a decision with your children that's not exactly correct. It may not be a a a precise word conclusion. It may not be a it may not be the best decision, but you make it as a mother, as a father. God sees that. And then, you know, on down the road, you you might say you you and your wife say, "You know what? That wasn't the best thing. That that's not the best for that child." So we God gives you and gives you instruction, gives you guidance and you change that and you readjust things and you you make it uh you make a correction. But God doesn't discount you and do away with you because as a parent and we're many parents here and if you're honest with yourself, you've made wrong decisions sometimes. But God does not put a black mark in his book and say, "Ah, you made a wrong decision." No, what he does says, "You're a father. You're a mother. You were honest. You loved your child. You did everything. You did what you felt was best for it. And so, uh, you just move on. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You just move on. What are you going to do? Stay there with your mistake? Stay there with your error?" No, you move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or the brothers sitting here too. So I'll uh you know we were just in discussion the other day and and this sometimes this happens. I never never dreamed I would get onto this subject but this part of it at least. But sometimes this happen. This is like some real good instruction. We're here. I'm a daddy and I've been a father to a lot of you that have come into the knowledge of the message. But if you have children, you have a son or a daughter and they've got a certain trait and you see that that trait is not taking them in the right direction. You can do one of two things. You can ask for guidance from the Holy Spirit how to deal with that and expect that God will direct you in that or you can go another direction. You can you can just harp on it all the time. You can just get on their case all the time. You're always doing that. What's the matter with you? You know why? Why don't you change? Maybe the child can't change. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now I really get personal and probably the whole world will hear it. &gt;&gt; But one day before Joanne married Tom and I noticed she was such a good girl. She'd come and sit in church but there was just like a blank there. Dear, you can forgive me. and she's up into that mid- teen time. You know, Brother Bram talked about Becky. He says she's sitting at the back chewing gum. You know, he's just doing what girls that age do. And we were in the house and we were having four meetings a week. And I noticed that Joanne just sat there and just a a dead pan stare just straight ahead. There's only one of my messages that's ever been printed that I know of, and that's sinners die alone. And that I preached that the very next Sunday because I called her down to my office. And if you want to see the chair she sat in, it's in my office here almost like 40 years later, 35 years later. And she sat in that chair. I just I want to talk to you a minute. And I said, Joan, dear, I said, I see you sitting in the services and you're you're there all the time. I said, do you ever feel God touching your heart? And she went just pursed her lips a little bit and shook her head. It was like someone drove a dagger to my heart and I said, "Don't you have the least desire for God? Don't you have the least desire?" And her lips were still pursed. I didn't know where to go. I said, "Dear, you're sitting in the chair that dad prays in." And I said, "And he talks to me." And I said, "I've noticed this little twist in your nature and your character." And I said, 'If that doesn't change, it'll cause you a lot of heartache and trouble. Perhaps when you get married and you get older, that'll just continue. And I said, I encouraged her then. I said, I you know, I've prayed and I believe that God wants to do something. The next service, God laid in my heart. When the beggar died, the angels were there to take him. And when the rich man died, no one was there. Sinners die alone. And I just got to the end of that service and I was weeping now. And I cried out, Joanne, it's you. And it was like electric power in her chair. She leapt up out of her chair and surrendered her life to Christ. And it's that's the Joanne that you know from that day I can say with the prophet from that time &gt;&gt; could she mold her life? No. She even wept and said I've tried. I've tried. Did you? I've tried. I've tried so hard. Maybe that's you. I've tried. I've tried so hard. What can you do? Only one thing. Just surrender all. &gt;&gt; Then the potter comes in. &gt;&gt; The potter takes a surrendered life. &gt;&gt; The potter takes that molded life. &gt;&gt; The potter takes that life when the coming out of the lips is saying, "Yes, Lord. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Take me. I give you all." &gt;&gt; You're sitting here. You've experienced it. You look back. You remember that time when you just gave it all &gt;&gt; and then the potter took a hold of the clay &gt;&gt; and he began to mold it and shape it into the kind of vessel. You know what he was doing? It so pleased him because he was bringing his image beginning to see himself building that image up. Oh my friends, God is taking this service in a different direction. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; than I had planned. But I did have a weight in my heart. I wrestled all day yesterday till I was exhausted. And I was I've never even experienced a time like that. I said, "I've got to just go out and drive out. I've got to get some fresh air." And I and I went out to go for a walk. I didn't have the energy to walk. I didn't have the strength. I got depressed. I said, I can't imagine that me, Ed Biscll, doesn't have a generally so full of energy. I haven't got the strength to even walk. I was so exhausted from from this message. I've never had it in my life. Not on a single time. I laid back and I didn't have the energy. I even thought about walking and I was depressed. I thought, why I haven't even got the energy to walk. But I was wrestling over one thing. How will I tell the people that they have the image in them? That imprint is there. How will I tell this congregation that that image is in you and God will not take it back &gt;&gt; and it's better to surrender sooner than later? The Holy Spirit is so patient and long-suffering and so if I could describe to you how desirous he is to have you just brother Brandham said Jesus came to the cross and he just climbed on his altar. They didn't have to take him and throw him down on the cross. He was made for it. He knew he was a perfect image of God and he laid down on that cross. They nail him. I say to you, just climb up on the potter's wheel. Let yourself be there today as just a lump of shapeless clay and let him do the molding. and he'll begin to fashion you and stay in that condition. Stay in that atmosphere. Don't forget it tomorrow, the next day, the next week, and set it as a course for your life. I'm thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at thy love to me, but I long to rise on the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee. Have thy own way, Lord. Have thy own way. Thou art the potter. I am the clay. Mold me and make me after thy will. While I am waiting, yielded and still burdened. God is wanting to do. He's striving. He's wanting to do things in us as individuals and in this congregation. And perhaps we've been taken up with too much of just life, essential things, necessary things. Don't miss out whatever you do. Don't be one of the 380. be one of the 120. &gt;&gt; God did not speak against them. There's no scripture that chastises them. Nobody came forward and said, "You foolish, silly people. How did you miss that?" No, it just says he was seen of above 500 and 120 were filled. Say, "Oh God, don't let don't let me miss I'm speaking on your behalf. Don't let me miss this ceiling. Don't let me miss this birth. Don't let me miss this great opportunity. We're not here in an upper room to be filled. We're here in preparation of a change. &gt;&gt; Of a change. If it took faith for them to get into the upper room, brother Brandham speaks about faith for healing. I'm not I'm not so interested in faith for healing right now. I'm interested in faith for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Are you? &gt;&gt; That's what we want. &gt;&gt; That's more than everything. That's number one in our lives. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm not even interested in preaching. I'm not even interested in how the service ought to end. And I am just keenly aware that the Holy Spirit is reaching down deep into our hearts in this church and in this congregation. And I'd like you to be able to yield while the Holy Spirit is moving and saying, "I'm thine, oh Lord. I'm here. I I'm here to be the clay. I'm here to climb up on the potter's wheel. I'm here for you to speak, my Lord." And you'll find somebody saying, "Yay, Lord. I will do it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I charge you before God. &gt;&gt; Don't let this little preacher preach in vain today. this the very God that put that image and stamped that imprint before the foundation of the world and brought you here and mingled husband to wife for centuries and hundreds of years and brought you here. This may be one of the most important moments in your life. You're feeling and sensing the Holy Spirit speaking. I wanted to just sing prayerfully, have thy own way, Lord. Have thy own way. You may be here and have never never given yourself unreservedly. This is the time to do it. This is a time I prayed for this service this morning. I prayed that God would do something. I thank God for you. My mind, my eyes go over this congregation. I thank God for you and I pray in the depths of my soul the best for you and God's prosper prosper your spiritual life. Whatever you do, don't live in the shadows. Don't live in the sidelines. Don't live non-committed. Don't live without zeal. Don't seek the easy path. That God, we're in a very, very critical time. We're in a rapture moment. [Music] friends or some I trust no one here I I hope no one here would be left [Music] you don't have to be part of the 380 [Music] &gt;&gt; somebody somebody is going to have a sweep oh God, don't let me miss that. I'm talking about myself. Don't let me miss that sweep. Don't let me miss that change. Having believed what we've believed and having spent so much time sitting in these seats and giving and praying and whatever more. [Music] Let us not miss this great moment. [Music] I'm going to invite you might be here and you have never never received Christ or you have never surrendered yourself completely. I'm going to invite you to if you wish to come and stand here as a testimony, if you just wish to stand, if you wish to kneel at your seat, makes no difference to me. But I think we should sing have not my will, not your will, but his will. Have thy own way. And if you wish just to stand where you are, that's fine. Or just remain seated. makes no difference to me. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit will conclude this service the way he desires it to be concluded. [Music] own way. Lord, help. Thou art the part. I am the train me and me. I will while I am He say I way have thy way [Music] I am the way. Hold me and wait. after I will wait. [Music] Have thy own way. at my way. Search me and try me [Music] to wing [Music] us [Music] in my presence. [Music] Listen to these words. Oh, have thy known way. Lord, have thy way. [Music] And we help our &gt;&gt; Why don't you just reach on to him? We talk to him power. [Music] Touch me and he say how th way Lord have thy way. Hold on my be [Music] filled with high. Oh God plant this prayer till all shall see. Christ we all [Music] Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus how lovely you are. That's all I can say. How lovely you are. I trust. I pray. I desire, oh Lord, as I speak to you, that all that have been within the sound of my voice today, [Music] that they may recognize, that they may know that it's God speaking. It's the Holy Spirit wooing. It's a still small voice that perhaps been covered up with all kinds of affairs of life. And this life is or is is has been organized by the enemy of our soul. He tries to bring so many things in and so many things oh God that is uh opposite that to works against what it is you're seeking to do in our life. I pray father that this congregation and every man, woman and child will, Lord Jesus, by your voice and by your power and by your uncction, may they resist the devil. May they refuse his intrusion. May they refuse his suggestions. May they refuse his influence. And may they say yes to you now. I pray that the angels of God who your messenger has said, we can feel their influence. We can feel the effect of them. And they are here by the Holy Spirit under the direction of Almighty God to increase our faith that we might receive the full benefit of your word. Oh God, don't let it be lost. Don't let it trickle out. Don't let it just dissipate. Don't let it evaporate but let it let me be impregnated with it. Oh God in the name of Jesus permeate your people I pray. Oh God grant it. I would like this congregation to stand. I would like everyone who claims to be a believer to enter into prayer with me for these that are and many that perhaps even are not raised their hand or are not standing at this time. But there are needy needy ones friends. There are needy ones. I'd like you to pray with me. Oh God. Oh God, I pray that you'll meet the need and the and the hungry. May the hungry be fed. Oh God, may feeds be broken. May the enemy's work be shattered in the name of Jesus Christ. Work with my brother, Lord. Work with my sister. bring them into that very place of a perfect harmony and and oneness with the Holy Spirit, oneness as a bridegroom and the bride. Oh Lord Jesus, our lovely bridegroom as I listened to your messenger and he said it was the most wonderful most wonderful thing of his life was to have fellowship with you. I pray that will be our testimony, oh God, this morning before we leave this place that we will be able to say, "We love you because you first loved us. We love you because you gave yourself to us. You gave yourself for us. We love you because you had us in your mind when you were on the cross when you died for us. We love you, Lord. We love you, Lord. We love you, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus. We're here to worship you. We're here to exalt your more most glorious name. We're here to yield ourselves to you. We're here to give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm thine uh without one plea. [Music] No. [Music] Here's [Music] the way. You don't have to fix yourself up, friends. You don't have to wait till tomorrow. And I think if I asked you as an honest congregation, do you believe that there's more for you? &gt;&gt; You'd say yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's where I'm pointing you to. That's what I'm directing you to. &gt;&gt; There's something former. Do you think that God could more perfect the image, his image in you? I say, "Yay." Release that. Release that in the name of the Lord. Do you agree with that? Just release that while you're here. That's why we're here. We're here to do business. You saw the people in China. They're just hugging one another and weeping over one another that in that first communion service. Oh, how precious it must have been to them. But you know what? Don't let Satan tell you any different. It doesn't have to be any different than that. Right this moment. Right this moment. You can have that love relationship with him. We just give ourselves just as I am without one plea. I am [Music] one of my [Music] thy [Music] to the land of God. I [Music] just as I am and waiting till my soul on dark [Music] and bre [Music] so often in brother Brown's messages and then After service, I just sang some of these old hymns and worship one after the other. Let us just enter into that worship. And yeah, I just want to encourage you just yield to him. You feel your spirit being broken? Say, "Melt me, oh God." Oh, this world, you know, we're almost case hardened. Can you agree with that? Almost case hardened with this. The world is so harsh. It's so cold. And his spirit is so tender and so warm and and so different from this world. It's so different. You've tasted of it at some time at some point. Say, "Lord, take me back to that moment." You're standing here desiring it. I want you to be expecting it. I want to sing, "Oh, to be like thee. Oh, to be like thee in this song, the course stamp thine own image. Yes. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to lift up your voice and let your lips speak these words. Stamp thine own image deep on my heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, to be like thee. Oh, to be like thee. Gracious redeemer. Precious redeemer. [Music] Bless [Music] you as our [Music] [Music] My thy [Music] say it to him now.

Blessed redeemer [Music] pure as thy [Music] sweetness. [Music] In thy thy [Music] heart. [Music] I'd like to sing. Yes. I'll say yes. Yes. Yes. That's all this song says. Maybe I don't know. Maybe some of the young people you don't get a chance to maybe express it. If you want to express it [Music] in a prayer or in a song, I'll say yes. I'll say yes. You'd like to just testify, not only the congregation, but to the people on the internet, I wouldn't ask you to come up and sing, but if you want to come up and just say, "Brother Ed, I'd like to join you and give this testimony to the people." I am saying yes. Here I am. I'm giving. I wouldn't do it if you didn't mean it from the depths of your soul. But if if you'd like to join me here on the platform, Brother Ed is saying yes. I'm saying that to this congregation. I'm trying to say yes to him. [Music] But I want to do everything according to the word of God. Absolutely. They want my life to be lived out according to the word of God. So let's just sing the chorus and the young people. Some young men and women want to join me. You're not coming to sing. You're singing to make a declaration. I am saying yes. &gt;&gt; I'll sing yes. [Music] I'll say yes. Yes. Yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I say yes. Yes. Yes. [Music] I'll say yes. Yes. [Music] Hey. [Music] [Music] Yes. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You young people that are standing here, you've got to take God is putting it on you on your shoulders in your heart. You're the only people that God can use are those who say yes. Whatever happens to you, be it good, bad or indifferent, whatever happens, God is looking. Only God can work with those people that say yes. And if you just lay everything down, take brother Biscll's counsel today. I felt the breeze and the of your passing by as I kept my eyes closed and I felt within my heart, this is them. This is the ones must carry this message straight through to the coming of the Lord. Determine within your heart, I won't allow anything to deter me, nothing to entice me. I won't allow anything to affect my life. I'm laying it down &gt;&gt; as of this moment. I'm selling out to God. &gt;&gt; Will you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You when you leave this platform say I am leaving with full expectations. One day, whether it's one day, one week, or 10 years, one day, I will feel that sweep. &gt;&gt; And whatever, whether I live to see it or I pass and come in the resurrection, I'll be just ahead of you. And we'll meet around the supper table. &gt;&gt; And your name will be there. And you'll have a reservation. &gt;&gt; It'll be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm proud of you. I'm so thankful for you young people. You are the strength. You've got the strength of your youth. G youth. Give every bit of it, every ounce of it to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You know that minister that was in the church from China? He'd been in the message two and a half years. and just God got him out of a Bible school. God doesn't have to get you out of a Bible school. You're here. You're in the message. You're grounded. You've got your parents and friends and your peers. Oh, say, "I'm going all the way." Hallelujah. If Brother Biscell at my age can just have that same kind of zeal, I'm passing it off to you in the name of Jesus Christ. You can have the same thing. Let the world throw all of all the pleasure in front of you and all the potential and possibilities and money and wealth and whatever thing. Don't let pay any attention. Don't pay any attention. It won't distract me. &gt;&gt; I've got one thing in my goal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will be in that upper room. I'll be in that chamber. I will be in that rapture. I will be in that number. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. It's a testimony, great testimony to you as parents. &gt;&gt; God bless you.

Preserve them from the entanglements and the heartaches. Satan has tried to devise every kind of thing. But I stand here as a servant of Christ against every demon of hell. And I declare that these have been bloodwashed by the blood of Jesus Christ. The seed of the woman has crushed the serpent's head. I rejoice. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. Your promise is yay and amen. The seed of the woman has crushed the serpent's head. His image is destroyed. in the image of the Lord God himself is being formed up. Oh, step thine in own image and deep upon our heart. Oh God, stamp thine image within this being filled with the Holy Ghost those not yet filled. Turn them, oh Lord. I pray that they will turn upside down their area, their place of work. In the name of Jesus Christ, raise them up as a mighty army.
