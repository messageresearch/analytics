[17:53] going to go to prayer this time in this
[17:55] presence. Ask brother John Andy's.
[17:57] Brother John, if you'd come
[17:59] open the service in a word of prayer.
[18:02] Our sister Ela has written a note. We
[18:05] want to remember sister Rachel from
[18:07] Maine who requests the believers to uh
[18:10] support her in prayer as she was once
[18:12] again diagnosed with cancer. She's not
[18:15] able to take the medication and needs a
[18:17] desperate touch from the hand of God to
[18:20] touch her. Also, Brother Matthew Redell
[18:23] has a prayer request here for a c-orker
[18:25] by the name of Dave whose father Frank
[18:28] is in the hospital with a severe heart
[18:30] condition. Apparently, brother Matthews
[18:33] had a chance to witness to Dave. He says
[18:35] he's close to be coming to church. So,
[18:37] we just wanted to ask that God would
[18:40] move not only on Dave's father, Frank,
[18:42] but also on Dave's life himself. Amen.
[18:45] If you have any needs this morning, just
[18:47] raise your hand and heart as we go to
[18:49] prayer. Actually, I'd like to sing as
[18:51] brother brother John comes. I'd like to
[18:52] sing only believe. Only believe all
[18:54] things are possible.
[18:58] Holy
[19:00] dream,
[19:04] only
[19:07] believe
[19:09] that all things are possible.
[19:16] Holy
[19:18] believe.
[19:21] Holy.
[19:24] [Music]
[19:33] All things are possible.
[19:39] Holy.
[19:40] [Music]
[19:44] Our Lord Jesus.
[19:48] Let's believe right now. Our Jesus,
[19:54] all things are possible and all things
[19:59] [Music]
[20:00] because he's here.
[20:04] Oh yes, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Our
[20:07] Jesus
[20:10] is here.
[20:13] Jesus.
[20:16] Oh yes, Father.
[20:18] All things are possible.
[20:24] Jesus,
[20:27] let's all agree together. Heavenly
[20:30] Father, we want to bless your name
[20:32] together. Lord, we want to throw open
[20:34] the doors of our hearts, our lips, our
[20:37] lives are before you. We want to praise
[20:40] your holy name. Even before we speak
[20:42] about our needs or what's on our hearts,
[20:45] we want to express to you our love, our
[20:47] adoration. Oh, if these hands could lift
[20:50] up, Lord, if our lips could tell you
[20:52] what's in our hearts, if our hearts
[20:54] could speak this morning, it would be
[20:56] volumes right now. Lord Jesus, we love
[20:59] you. We appreciate you. We thank you for
[21:02] what you've done, what you're doing.
[21:04] Jesus, only eternity will be able to
[21:06] tell your greatness, your majesty, your
[21:09] glory. Father, Lord, we as humans, we as
[21:12] your bride, we as your lady, we open up
[21:15] our hearts to tell you we love you. We
[21:18] thank you for redemption, bringing us
[21:20] back, Lord, to our right minds, to our
[21:22] ought to be condition. You're doing that
[21:24] this morning, Jesus. And we want to see
[21:27] it happen in a further way. We want to
[21:29] see scales drop off our eyes and ears be
[21:33] open, hearts be open, even lives that
[21:35] aren't even in this room, our family
[21:38] members, loved ones that need a touch.
[21:41] Lord, we believe you're doing a miracle
[21:43] right now. We believe you're able to
[21:45] turn hearts around and move in
[21:47] situations, take cancers out of bodies,
[21:51] give a young person a right mind, the
[21:53] mind of Christ, that they would
[21:55] surrender, that they would yield, that
[21:57] your Holy Spirit would permeate through
[21:59] their lives, and bring a marriage back
[22:02] together. Bring lives that are strangers
[22:05] into the family, into the home. This is
[22:08] your house. This is your house of
[22:11] praise. This is the house of prayer.
[22:14] This is where we release our cares, our
[22:16] burdens to you. Abba Father, you are our
[22:20] father. You are the one true living God.
[22:23] You are the only God. You are the only
[22:26] truth. You are the only way. You are
[22:29] alive this morning, Jesus.
[22:35] Father, anything could happen in your
[22:36] presence. Lord, we believe our hearts
[22:40] are ready, Father, to do your will and
[22:42] submit ourselves. Lord, we pray that you
[22:45] go to Rachel there in Maine. Father,
[22:47] dealing this situation, this life, she
[22:50] needs a touch from you, Jesus. Lord,
[22:52] even this one that Matthew spoken to
[22:54] needs a touch. You're dealing in his
[22:56] life, Father. A part of the body's been
[22:59] affected affected his life. I pray that
[23:02] you would move in that situation into
[23:05] lives. Father, our hands are lifted up.
[23:07] There's needs in the building, Jesus.
[23:09] There's prayer that's gone up before,
[23:11] Lord. Even this prayer, and we're
[23:13] agreeing together that the strongholds
[23:15] of the enemy would be broken, that he
[23:18] would be crushed, that he would be
[23:20] bruised, that his back would be broken,
[23:23] that men and women would enter into a
[23:25] realm, Lord, at the sound of your voice
[23:27] this morning, that every captive would
[23:29] be set free, every life that might be
[23:32] shackled or or bruised, that you would
[23:35] heal them. Jesus, you sent your word and
[23:38] healed us. May that hand move across our
[23:42] lives again this morning. If there's
[23:44] areas, Lord, that needs to be touched,
[23:47] things that need to be dealt with.
[23:48] Father, Lord, we've not dressed for one
[23:51] another. We haven't come here to see one
[23:53] another. We want to see you, Jesus. Deal
[23:56] with our hearts, God. Do a surgery.
[23:59] Father, we know our birth is a mess. We
[24:01] haven't come here to put on a show or to
[24:04] hide behind a facade. Break us, Lord.
[24:07] Purge us, Lord. We want to bring forth
[24:10] more fruit, much fruit. Jesus.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Do a heart transplant, Lord. Take our
[24:17] lives, take our lips, take our spirits,
[24:20] our bodies, our souls are before you,
[24:22] Jesus. Lord, let the word have an
[24:25] incredible effect, Jesus, this morning.
[24:27] Don't let us be dull. Don't let us be
[24:29] drifting out into another galaxy. But
[24:32] Lord, bring us bring us subject to thus,
[24:35] sayeth the Lord. In your presence, the
[24:37] supernatural's moving. Hearts are being
[24:40] mended. Lives are being broken. Lord,
[24:43] there's a fountain of grace that's being
[24:45] made available. Oh God, we don't want to
[24:47] miss you this morning. Your appearing,
[24:50] your face, your presence is what we live
[24:53] for. We live for this, Jesus. We want to
[24:56] give our all to you. We want to
[24:58] surrender right now. Not at the end of
[25:00] the service, but right now, we want to
[25:03] yield our members. We want to let you
[25:05] have full course. Even now, those out on
[25:08] the internet, Father, those on the
[25:10] phone, hook up, those that are sick and
[25:12] body, those that need a touch. Jesus,
[25:15] time or distance means nothing to you.
[25:19] You are present and you're touched with
[25:22] the feeling of what we're going through.
[25:23] And we, as your bride, just make
[25:26] ourselves available. We make our womb
[25:28] available. Let your will be done in
[25:31] earth as it is in heaven.
[25:34] Take this service as a love gift back to
[25:37] yourself. We want to enter in now. Get
[25:40] get our hearts prepared for what you
[25:43] have to say to us.
[25:45] We love you, Jesus. Minister this
[25:48] morning in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[25:54] [Music]
[25:57] Amen. You may have your seats.
[26:05] And I have a couple of announcements,
[26:07] but as I'm making them, Sister Lesley
[26:09] and in your group, if they want to come
[26:10] up now and get ready, can you turn me
[26:12] down just a little bit? Thanks. Come get
[26:14] ready at this time. As I make these, uh,
[26:17] the Bible believers mission update is
[26:21] now available at the tape library. So,
[26:23] if you want to uh grab that, I believe
[26:25] it's most likely one per family. So, you
[26:28] can grab those at the tape library.
[26:31] Also, we want to welcome sister Adah's
[26:34] husband just arrived from the
[26:35] Philippines to sojourn with us. Why
[26:37] don't we get him to stand
[26:40] and we can welcome you. God bless you.
[26:41] It's good to have you.
[26:47] Amen. Thank you. Amen. They gave me a
[26:51] name, but I didn't want to embarrass
[26:53] myself. So, when you see him, make sure
[26:56] you shake his hand and you can ask
[26:57] Sister Ada how to pronounce his name.
[27:00] It's just safer that way. Uh, also,
[27:02] Brother Jess Berios has a announcement
[27:05] here. There will be a meeting in the
[27:06] chapel right after the evening service
[27:09] for all those who are interested in
[27:10] helping with the Bible camp this year.
[27:13] So, you can meet Brother Jess tonight.
[27:16] Amen.
[27:23] God bless you all saints. Just enter in
[27:26] and worship the Lord with us in this
[27:28] song. Amen. Jesus is here right now.

[29:52] to give us victory over death, hell, and
[29:56] the grave.

[37:10] &gt;&gt; So, we need to be in prayer about that.
[37:13] Amen. God bless you. Nice to see our
[37:16] brother here. And nice to see brother
[37:18] Gay as well. God bless you, brother Gay.
[37:22] Uh to finally
[37:26] see, I saw in the Oh, yes. Our sister
[37:28] Aida her husband here as well. You
[37:31] welcomed him. Others that may be
[37:33] visiting. and uh we were away of course
[37:38] happy to be uh back.
[37:42] We had a wonderful time at uh at brother
[37:46] Donnie Reagan's and brother Jeff Jenkins
[37:49] church also with brother Samuel Dale and
[37:52] we won't spend any time with that but uh
[37:55] brother Murphy and Sister Tracy it was
[37:58] it was sister Tracy's first time to be
[38:01] uh or to see another congregation
[38:04] outside of here and and China and she
[38:08] really enjoyed it and we were so happy
[38:10] to have Brother Murphy and Sister Tracy
[38:13] with us. The congregation there were
[38:16] very very blessed
[38:18] uh and uh have brother Murphy uh
[38:22] introduce them further with the work in
[38:25] China. And we were just so delighted.
[38:28] While we were in Lima, I had the
[38:30] opportunity to meet our brother Anoir
[38:34] Chavad and he is uh with us going to be
[38:38] speaking tonight. Our brother Anoir is
[38:41] from Pakistan
[38:44] and uh we didn't recognize him in the
[38:46] service did we? Where is our brother
[38:48] Anoir?
[38:55] Maybe you can just come here a moment.
[38:58] Our brother Anar will be preaching
[39:00] tonight.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother there.
[39:03] He will be preaching tonight and uh our
[39:06] brother has been a pastor for quite a
[39:10] number of years in Lahore Pakistan
[39:13] and then came to the message a few years
[39:16] ago. He was he was ministering I think
[39:18] pastoring for about 8 years prior to
[39:20] that weren't you? Yes. And uh and then
[39:24] God opened his understanding and his
[39:27] eyes to the message. And so we were
[39:30] happy to meet meet him there in Lima.
[39:32] And tonight you'll hear the rest of the
[39:34] story. Amen. God bless you, brother.
[39:37] [Music]
[39:43] Brother Lonnie Jenkins who has been
[39:45] really laboring for a lot of years to
[39:48] get the
[39:50] message into
[39:53] into Pakistan which is largely Muslim
[39:56] and uh it's not a difficult it's not an
[39:59] easy place it's a difficult place to get
[40:02] the message established there and
[40:06] brother Lonnie is very very encouraged
[40:08] that our brother Anoir
[40:11] has uh has taken
[40:14] a real burden to do this. One of the
[40:17] reasons of course that he's here not
[40:20] only to meet you and so I can have a
[40:22] little time with him but he's here to
[40:24] work with brother Murphy and brother
[40:26] Tony was brother Tony's burden so that
[40:30] the message could begin to have a voice
[40:33] over in their language in in that
[40:37] country. So, we're very very happy to do
[40:40] whatever we can do and to be a part uh
[40:43] and to encourage our brother Anoir
[40:46] in the work there.
[40:49] I want to go directly to the word, but
[40:52] I'd like to maybe have you stand and
[40:53] sing, I feel the pull. I hear the call.
[40:58] And we need to today,
[41:02] I don't know just exactly how the
[41:03] service is going to go, but I would like
[41:06] to encourage you to just gather all of
[41:10] your thoughts. Say we lay everything
[41:12] else aside.
[41:14] We've come here
[41:17] because God, you know, God moved on you
[41:20] at some point in your life and you feel
[41:23] the pull. We're here to hear the call.
[41:27] Amen. Appreciated that prayer this
[41:30] morning, brother John. Felt a real
[41:32] response from the people. And uh you
[41:36] know, sometimes we come to the pulpit
[41:38] and we just know exactly how we're going
[41:41] to start and feel at least unless God
[41:44] moves in a special way how it's going to
[41:46] move through.
[41:48] But uh today I'm I'm just not that
[41:51] certain. So, I want you to really feel
[41:54] the pull
[41:56] and I want you to really pull on the on
[41:59] the It's not that I am uncertain. I
[42:01] could I I guarantee I could have you
[42:04] here for the next 3 hours with no
[42:06] problem. And so, that is my big problem
[42:09] just to have that down the way it should
[42:13] be.
[42:15] And uh I would like you to be mindful
[42:19] that
[42:22] there are there are decisions that are
[42:24] being made
[42:27] say in high places
[42:30] of authority
[42:32] places within the government or within
[42:36] the religious world. There are decisions
[42:38] being made.
[42:40] There are ide are ideas being put
[42:43] forward.
[42:45] There's motions being made within the
[42:48] Senate, within the parliament, whatever
[42:51] government it might be that are going to
[42:53] affect you down the road.
[42:57] You don't know anything about it right
[42:59] now. It hasn't come to the surface. It
[43:02] maybe hasn't come into play as yet, but
[43:05] you will feel its effects on down the
[43:08] road. I believe much of what brother
[43:10] Brham has brought
[43:14] because as a prophet spoke of things and
[43:17] now we're starting to see them. But
[43:19] there may be some things that are in
[43:21] motion yet that have not come into full
[43:24] effect, but you will they will come into
[43:28] effect. And I believe that there will be
[43:31] a squeeze,
[43:33] a spiritual squeeze, and perhaps an
[43:35] economic squeeze and whatever more. And
[43:38] and today
[43:40] uh you know I would like to just expose
[43:42] some of these things and with God's help
[43:46] may the Lord May the Lord help us. Let's
[43:50] just sing this chorus before we pray. I
[43:53] feel the
[43:57] Just give yourself to him now. I hear
[44:02] the call
[44:06] and his spirit
[44:10] moving me to give my all.
[44:18] Speak to me
[44:24] and I
[44:26] agree.
[44:27] Oh yes we do Lord
[44:30] Lord
[44:32] come
[44:34] &gt;&gt; take control.
[44:36] I feel the just once again prayerfully.
[44:42] I feel the
[44:46] Holy Spirit of God
[44:54] and thy spirit
[44:58] moving me to give my all.
[45:06] speaks to me
[45:11] and I
[45:13] agree.
[45:18] [Music]
[45:23] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[45:29] with our heads bowed.
[45:31] Gracious and loving heavenly father, we
[45:35] are here standing in your presence. And
[45:38] as we prayed a few moments ago in the
[45:41] study, what is man that thou art mindful
[45:44] of him or the son of man that thou
[45:47] visitest him? But you have not only come
[45:50] to visit us, you have come to abide with
[45:54] us. You said, I will abide with you. I
[45:57] will be in you and you will be in me.
[46:01] Your messenger declared that this was
[46:04] that day. We agree and we say it again
[46:09] and again over and over. We agree that
[46:12] you are in us and we are in you and that
[46:15] this is the day of oneness. Bless not
[46:19] only those that are here but those that
[46:21] are streaming. How we feel a part of
[46:24] them and we desire they will feel a part
[46:27] of us Lord. And one day the barriers
[46:30] will be gone. One day time will be
[46:33] dissolved. One day, oh God, the curtain
[46:36] of time will drop and we will be
[46:39] together forever in your divine
[46:42] presence. And this veil of flesh will
[46:45] also drop. And we will so rejoice, oh
[46:48] God, that it's gone. and that we will be
[46:51] Lord unhindered and unfettered in your
[46:54] presence and with one another as we so
[46:57] desire to be. Bless now the word. Anoint
[47:00] us Lord. Anoint me I pray as I stand at
[47:03] this post of duty and your people as we
[47:07] move confidently in the hour that you
[47:10] have appointed us to live in in Jesus
[47:14] Christ's name. Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Open your Bibles if you would
[47:20] please
[47:22] to uh Acts the 4th. Acts the 1st chapter
[47:27] and I'm also going to read from
[47:30] Matthew 16.
[47:34] Acts the first chapter
[47:37] at verse 4
[47:41] just down through verse 11.
[47:49] and being assembled together with them,
[47:54] commanded them that they should not
[47:55] depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
[47:58] promise of the Father, which saith he,
[48:02] you have heard of me. For John truly
[48:05] baptized with water, but ye shall be
[48:08] baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many
[48:11] days hence. When they therefore were
[48:14] come together, they asked of him,
[48:16] saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time
[48:20] restore again the kingdom to Israel.
[48:24] And he said unto them, "It is not for
[48:26] you to know the times or the seasons
[48:29] which the Father hath put in his own
[48:31] power, but you shall receive power after
[48:35] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you,
[48:38] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[48:40] in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in
[48:43] Samaria, and under the uttermost part of
[48:47] the earth." And when he had spoken these
[48:49] things, while they beheld, he was taken
[48:52] up, and a cloud received him out of
[48:55] their sight. And while they looked
[48:58] steadfastly toward heaven, as he went
[49:01] up, behold, two men stood by them in
[49:03] white apparel, and said, and also said,
[49:07] which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why
[49:10] stand ye gazing up into heaven, this
[49:13] same Jesus, which is taken up, which is
[49:16] taken up from you into heaven, shall so
[49:19] come in like manner, as ye have seen him
[49:22] go into heaven. I would like you to
[49:25] notice
[49:26] that when they asked, "Will you restore
[49:30] again the kingdom
[49:32] to Israel and he said that these were
[49:36] the things the times and the seasons
[49:38] which the father had put in his own
[49:41] power like you'd notice that word and
[49:44] then he said, "But you shall receive
[49:46] power." And he used two different words
[49:48] there. It is the father hath put this in
[49:51] his own jurisdiction and in his own
[49:54] authority. But you will receive power.
[49:58] You will receive dunamis. You'll receive
[50:01] power that will carry you through.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's speaking about. In
[50:07] Matthew the 16th chapter,
[50:11] Jesus is speaking to Peter
[50:17] and the disciples, but he addresses
[50:20] Peter
[50:22] and the
[50:26] 17th verse after Jesus had asked them,
[50:31] "Who do men say that I am?" And Jesus
[50:34] answered and said unto him to Peter,
[50:38] Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah,
[50:41] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[50:43] unto thee, but my father, which is in
[50:46] heaven, and I say unto thee that thou
[50:49] art Peter, and upon this rock I will
[50:53] build my church, and the gates of hell
[50:56] shall not prevail against it.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I want to speak on
[51:03] the power of revelation.
[51:09] We are
[51:12] uh we need to be empowered.
[51:16] Jesus said to the disciples, you shall
[51:20] receive power. You will be empowered.
[51:22] And the reason he said that is very
[51:24] obvious. They would need power.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; We need power. Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; We need endurance.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; We are fascinated by power as humans.
[51:38] We're just automatically whether that
[51:39] power is exerted for good things or evil
[51:44] things. We are fascinated by it.
[51:50] We we see to see a man that is humanly
[51:55] very very strong. It's it's really quite
[51:58] amazing to see what a man might be able
[52:01] to lift or what a man might be able to
[52:04] do or what he might be able to endure.
[52:06] Or we see some machine or some piece of
[52:10] equipment and it's massive. It can do
[52:13] enormous things. It can do powerful
[52:17] things and we are uh we are attracted to
[52:20] that. We can't say that we're not. And
[52:23] when we see, you know, such things as uh
[52:26] at the space center, uh even I've never
[52:30] been there to to view it, but to see
[52:32] those rockets lift a spaceship or send
[52:37] some satellite, you you know, if you
[52:39] were there, you wouldn't be looking some
[52:41] other direction. You'd be fascinated at
[52:44] that millions of thrust of power coming
[52:48] out of the bottom of that rocket and
[52:50] sending this huge spacecraft into into
[52:54] orbit at uh thousands of miles an hour
[52:58] perhaps. I think they have to go about
[53:00] at least 25,000 m an hour to get it into
[53:04] its orbit. We would be fascinated by it.
[53:07] We'd be attracted by it. We're we're
[53:09] interested in things of power. When God
[53:12] allows nature to be released with
[53:16] enormous energy, whether it be by
[53:19] earthquake, whether it be by volcano,
[53:22] whether it be by storm, by wind, by
[53:26] tornado, by hurricane, by tsunami or
[53:29] whatever more. We are fascinated by the
[53:33] strength of power and how it is exerted
[53:36] and demonstrated and how it can change
[53:38] things in a very short period of time.
[53:42] We're interested in power. There are
[53:44] other kinds of power which are which are
[53:47] being uh which is being I would say
[53:50] exerted uh but it may be slow moving. It
[53:54] there are there is what we call there's
[53:57] chambers of power. There's halls of
[54:00] power. There's offices of power. We
[54:02] think of the power that man has taken to
[54:05] himself as uh leaders of countries and
[54:09] nations and groups of nations and how
[54:12] leaders have gotten together and and
[54:15] contrived to agree to exert power upon
[54:20] people. Unassuming people, people
[54:23] unaware, people not not not knowing what
[54:27] is taking place. But in the high some in
[54:30] high ranking office, they've come to a
[54:33] decision. Maybe just a handful of men
[54:35] have come to a decision of what they're
[54:37] going to do. And they they've they lay
[54:40] out their strategy and map out the and
[54:43] then make a decision uh of of that's
[54:46] going to affect multitudes and millions
[54:49] and millions of people. That is where
[54:52] I'm coming to this morning.
[54:55] Jesus said to Peter,
[54:59] he said that the gates of hell
[55:04] shall not prevail.
[55:06] I will build my church.
[55:09] I will build my church and the gates of
[55:12] hell shall not prevail against it.
[55:17] And the word which he used there the
[55:19] gate
[55:22] uh
[55:24] it can be either in the wall of a city
[55:29] or a palace
[55:31] or a town
[55:35] or the temple
[55:38] or a prison.
[55:40] It can be likened to a vast prison.
[55:44] the access or entrance into any state.
[55:49] I don't know. I want to just uh
[56:08] just a moment.
[56:13] I want to just come back to it a moment.
[56:25] This is called St. Peter's Square.
[56:31] It's called St. Peter's Square.
[56:34] It may not be entirely what Jesus was
[56:37] talking about, but I believe that's the
[56:39] gates of hell.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] That's right.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, even the way it was
[56:46] constructed, it's called this, if you go
[56:48] to the Bureau of Tourism, they call
[56:52] these two two arms
[56:55] to embrace
[56:57] the people. I would say to hold the
[56:59] people.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And then in here, this is an obelisk
[57:05] actually, which is from Egypt right in
[57:09] the center.
[57:12] and uh and and the whole
[57:16] encompassing
[57:19] uh office and position
[57:22] of this uh called St. Peter Square. It's
[57:26] not just a physical structure, but it's
[57:28] what takes place there
[57:31] &gt;&gt; and the decisions that are made there
[57:34] and the people. It is the who's who of
[57:38] the world.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; It's your leaders. I don't care whether
[57:41] you're from America or Canada or whether
[57:43] you're from Europe or the United Kingdom
[57:46] or wherever. The only country I think
[57:49] that has not had their leaders
[57:52] uh go there and they may well have gone
[57:54] there is China and some of the maybe
[57:56] some of the Asian countries, but they
[57:59] have gone there and decisions have been
[58:02] made that have affected their people
[58:05] dramatically. And there are leaders of
[58:08] the religious world that have gone there
[58:12] and we will refer a little bit more to
[58:15] it. Now
[58:17] I'm taking
[58:20] I showed you this picture a few days
[58:23] ago.
[58:24] This is the but I've added a little bit
[58:27] to it since I've been away. And the
[58:30] thing that I've added to it is that
[58:34] uh
[58:35] a nation is represented by their leader
[58:39] and when their leader has done made an
[58:42] act then God considers that nation to
[58:46] have be involved in that act. Not that
[58:49] all the people are but the nation as a
[58:52] nation. And because this was the first
[58:54] time in history that a United States
[58:59] president has gone to a funeral of a
[59:03] pope. This is not just a president. This
[59:07] is three presidents. It's not just three
[59:10] presidents, but two of them are
[59:11] Republican and one is Democrat. That is
[59:15] both the parties of the United States.
[59:18] That encompasses the entire United
[59:20] States. Now, Brother Brham was offered
[59:24] and uh uh I bl I believe it was Van
[59:28] Bloomberg
[59:30] uh had made an appointment for brother
[59:32] Brandham to visit the pope and the
[59:35] appointment was made for him to visit
[59:38] the pope. So, he was going to do that.
[59:42] Then he said he asked what must I do
[59:45] when I visit the pope? They said,
[59:47] "You'll need to kiss his ring and you
[59:50] need to bow down." He said, "I'm sorry,
[59:53] that's out. I'll call him brother if he
[59:56] wants to call me brother or if I'll call
[59:59] him brother or whatever, I'll give him
[1:00:01] any kind of uh respect and recognition.
[1:00:05] But to bow down, he said, would be an
[1:00:08] act of worship. And that, he said, is
[1:00:11] accepting the doctrine.
[1:00:16] bowing down and accepting the doctrine
[1:00:21] is exactly what the scripture says that
[1:00:25] they will commit fornication.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; This to me, my brother, my sister, is
[1:00:30] the very act of fornication.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; This has been spiritual fornication.
[1:00:36] America has formerly committed
[1:00:40] fornication with the Roman church
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; and have drank of her cup
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and are intoxicated with the wine of her
[1:00:50] fornication.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; All right, you can shut that off if you
[1:00:55] would please.
[1:01:04] And it's going to take some power
[1:01:08] not to be affected by the things that
[1:01:12] are taking place. And the scripture says
[1:01:16] that all
[1:01:18] the earth, all whose names are not
[1:01:21] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:01:24] worshiped
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; the beast.
[1:01:28] I personally believe that perhaps we
[1:01:31] have not uh visually seen all of it take
[1:01:36] place, but I believe we're right there.
[1:01:45] The scripture says,
[1:01:49] "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:01:51] but against principalities,
[1:01:54] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:01:57] the darkness of this world, against
[1:02:00] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:02:04] The words of our Lord Jesus to Apostle
[1:02:06] Paul when he met him on the road to
[1:02:09] Damascus.
[1:02:11] Jesus is addressing him and telling him
[1:02:13] what his commission will be. And he ends
[1:02:15] with these lines. to open their eyes and
[1:02:19] to turn them from darkness to light, and
[1:02:22] from the power of Satan unto God, that
[1:02:27] they may receive forgiveness of sins and
[1:02:30] inheritance among them which are
[1:02:32] sanctified by faith, that is faith that
[1:02:35] is in me, that they might be delivered
[1:02:39] from the power of Satan. There is a I
[1:02:42] tell you what friends this these uh
[1:02:44] things that took place in the last few
[1:02:46] days and one week ago was the inaugural
[1:02:51] uh inaugural service of the installation
[1:02:54] of the present pope who's taken place
[1:02:57] pope Benedict the 16th and uh uh he has
[1:03:01] been ready to say that he's going to
[1:03:03] continue the course of of uh unity etc.
[1:03:08] uh this thing that that is taking place
[1:03:10] has been prophesied
[1:03:13] by brother Brandham prophesied 30 and 40
[1:03:16] years ago and his the prophecies are so
[1:03:20] distinct so accurate that I intend today
[1:03:24] to at least get enough in front of you
[1:03:27] so that you'll go home and uh uh you'd
[1:03:31] be wise to perhaps take a a message
[1:03:33] that's a rather difficult message which
[1:03:35] is feast of the trumpets but with your
[1:03:37] patience and with your cooperation, I
[1:03:40] want to go into that message with quite
[1:03:42] some detail today. And you'll see that
[1:03:45] there has been prophecies which have
[1:03:47] been prophesied back there and warnings
[1:03:50] which have been issued back there. And
[1:03:52] we are seeing those things happening
[1:03:54] right now. And we would be we would be
[1:03:58] well advised to really sharpen our
[1:04:01] spiritual senses up and to p pull up the
[1:04:05] traces and to make sure that things
[1:04:08] aren't slack in our lives because I also
[1:04:11] feel very very strongly about this. If
[1:04:13] we're sitting here today in our present
[1:04:17] environment in this present rather
[1:04:20] relaxed atmosphere and things are spoken
[1:04:23] out of the word of God and and we think
[1:04:26] well you know yeah it's it's it you know
[1:04:28] that is speaking to me. Yeah the Lord
[1:04:30] you know that kind of came to my address
[1:04:33] but somehow we just you know we managed
[1:04:35] to set it aside. We managed to uh
[1:04:38] relegate it to some lower you know place
[1:04:40] on our agenda. I'll just tell you for
[1:04:43] sure that for you will not stand the
[1:04:46] pressure that is going to come because
[1:04:48] there's going to be greater pressure.
[1:04:50] There going to be a time where you're
[1:04:52] going to have to decide to stand with
[1:04:53] the word or stand with your flesh or
[1:04:56] stand with whatever it is that has you
[1:04:58] know been in your uh uh kind of in your
[1:05:02] particular thing. And uh sometimes it it
[1:05:05] can be, you know, it can be money, it
[1:05:08] can be business, it can be education, it
[1:05:10] can be all kinds of things. All kinds of
[1:05:12] things. But we can we want to be assured
[1:05:15] that we're not giving uh uh we're not
[1:05:19] giving the the message and the things
[1:05:21] that God speaks to our heart second
[1:05:23] place.
[1:05:28] Now,
[1:05:30] I would also like you to notice
[1:05:33] that when the disciples asked, "Lord,
[1:05:36] will you at this time restore the
[1:05:40] kingdom to Israel?" I want you to catch
[1:05:42] that because this is a very, very
[1:05:46] similar
[1:05:48] question that we have on our minds.
[1:05:52] Lord, will you now are we at the time
[1:05:55] when you're going to restore fully the
[1:05:58] kingdom of God? Are we going to enter
[1:06:01] into the full promise of God? Uh is this
[1:06:05] the time of the rapture? Are we actually
[1:06:08] moving into this rapture cycle? We've
[1:06:10] heard it. We've heard it. And now they
[1:06:12] had good reason to believe this must be
[1:06:14] it. They'd seen the suffering. They saw
[1:06:16] the crucifixion. They saw how the word
[1:06:19] had been treated. They saw the nation
[1:06:21] rejected. We've seen the same thing.
[1:06:23] They had been considered an oddball
[1:06:25] little group of people. You're just a
[1:06:27] little offshoot. You're just off
[1:06:29] scouring. You're just a a little group
[1:06:32] of loose people. And uh uh you know and
[1:06:35] and and then Christ himself then uh
[1:06:38] suffered the cross and the death and the
[1:06:40] resurrection. And they were not
[1:06:42] believing in the resurrection. The the
[1:06:44] nation did not come forward and say he's
[1:06:47] he's risen. It was just those that he
[1:06:50] revealed himself to. It was still power
[1:06:53] of revelation.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; The whole nation never regarded him as
[1:06:57] resurrected. They they bought a lie.
[1:07:00] They paid for a lie. And the people
[1:07:03] believed a lie rather than believing the
[1:07:05] truth. They're believing a lie today.
[1:07:07] They're absolutely hoaxed.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; They're absolutely taken in. They're
[1:07:12] sucked in.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; I I look at some of the events that's
[1:07:16] happened in the last few days. I mean,
[1:07:17] we we become accustomed to it. You see
[1:07:19] it in the newspaper, see it in the
[1:07:20] magazine, you see it on the television
[1:07:22] or you see it on and hear it on the
[1:07:23] radio. But but when it's visual, when
[1:07:26] it's visual and you and you see all of
[1:07:28] this grandeur and and this pump and this
[1:07:31] ceremony and these hats and and whatever
[1:07:35] they call them and all of the robes for
[1:07:38] this occasion and that occasion, it's
[1:07:41] ludicrous. It's absolutely bizarre. And
[1:07:44] if we we would put on those hats, they
[1:07:46] would call you the nuttiest people in
[1:07:49] the world. But they put them on and
[1:07:51] everybody goes goooo. Uh-uh. It's just
[1:07:54] bizarre. It's absolutely wild. Who in
[1:07:57] the world invented that hat? It was
[1:08:00] borrowed, of course, they said from the
[1:08:01] Old Testament. Well, I can tell you that
[1:08:04] what they had in the Old Testament and
[1:08:05] all this, you know, it has to be scarlet
[1:08:07] for this occasion, has to be gold for
[1:08:09] this occasion, has to be, you know, it
[1:08:12] has to be a certain kind of ribbon, a
[1:08:13] certain kind of this and so many of this
[1:08:14] and so many of that and on and on and
[1:08:17] on. And it's absolutely wild.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Just nonsense to the utmost degree that
[1:08:25] they can ever take Peter, the humble,
[1:08:28] illiterate fisherman, and and get this
[1:08:31] out of it.
[1:08:32] I mean that is that is the wildest
[1:08:35] imagination that you you can't even get
[1:08:37] there.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You cannot associate the two. But you
[1:08:41] know today we don't think a whole lot of
[1:08:43] it. But don't underestimate the power of
[1:08:45] that beast.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; That they got they got they got plans
[1:08:49] for you.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; They've got plans for you. They've got
[1:08:53] plans. Don't think for a minute they
[1:08:55] don't know about this message. Don't
[1:08:57] think for a minute. I've already heard
[1:08:59] years ago that they have the church ages
[1:09:01] right in the Vatican file. That is
[1:09:03] people who've been there said they've
[1:09:04] got the church ages there. I bet they
[1:09:06] have the seals there. I wouldn't be a
[1:09:08] bit surprised to have a whole set of uh
[1:09:11] of the library of the books there. I
[1:09:13] wouldn't be a bit surprised. They got
[1:09:15] scholars just studying these things all
[1:09:16] the time. How long would it take for
[1:09:19] your name to be identified in their
[1:09:21] computer or the computer system? How
[1:09:23] long would it take for them to identify
[1:09:26] you as a believer of this message who
[1:09:27] believe this kind of thing?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; How long would it take for your nation
[1:09:31] to identify you and say you you're a
[1:09:34] believer of hate literature?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; They do it in a few weeks.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; You'd all be down there. If you're
[1:09:42] identified if you own a gun, you're
[1:09:44] identified if you drive a car. You're
[1:09:46] identified if you own a home. You're on
[1:09:48] this tax role. And you're identified
[1:09:50] here. You're identified if you got a
[1:09:52] medical card. If you got medical
[1:09:53] insurance, you're identified. They got
[1:09:55] so much information on you, you can't
[1:09:57] even you can't even think about it.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; You can't even imagine it. I got a card
[1:10:03] here
[1:10:05] right here. I don't want to I'm going to
[1:10:06] put my finger over the picture. It's a
[1:10:08] terrible picture. I was I was upset when
[1:10:10] I took this picture and I looked like it
[1:10:12] too. It's up. Give me that card and get
[1:10:14] this thing over with. But implanted in
[1:10:17] this plastic here is a whole bunch of
[1:10:18] information. Implanted in that plastic
[1:10:21] is is my I think my passport number and
[1:10:25] and all kinds of details. And I just
[1:10:27] wave this thing in in front of a another
[1:10:29] piece of plastic. And the guy in the
[1:10:32] office, he just looks at what's coming
[1:10:33] up on the screen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; They know all about you.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; They know the color of your eyes. And
[1:10:39] without even looking at the picture,
[1:10:41] they know they got all kinds of
[1:10:43] information about you. And it wouldn't
[1:10:44] take any length of time. Believe me,
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; it would take zero amount of time. And
[1:10:49] they probably have everything in place
[1:10:51] to identify you already as a believer
[1:10:53] this message.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And when the disciples were asking this,
[1:11:00] they had a good reason to ask it. They
[1:11:03] had a very good reason to ask it because
[1:11:07] now he had resurrected and they thought
[1:11:10] now things are moving in a positive
[1:11:13] direction. He has been resurrected. Oh,
[1:11:16] will you now restore the kingdom? Is
[1:11:18] this what we've been waiting for? No. In
[1:11:21] fact is he said it's not for you to know
[1:11:25] the time or the season that the father
[1:11:28] has put in his own jurisdiction
[1:11:32] under his own authority. But you will
[1:11:36] receive power. They didn't know how
[1:11:39] badly they needed that because soon
[1:11:41] after this the very power of Rome which
[1:11:45] was in control of their nation now was
[1:11:48] going to come down with a heavy hand.
[1:11:50] They were going to besiege Jerusalem.
[1:11:53] And if they had not been believers of
[1:11:55] the message, they too would have been
[1:11:57] trapped in Jerusalem. But because they
[1:12:00] were believers of the message, the
[1:12:02] prophet said, "Not one of them were
[1:12:05] caught in that city."
[1:12:08] But this nation, this nation, this same
[1:12:12] power, because this is the identical
[1:12:14] power, it's just changed its mask. It
[1:12:18] was pagan Rome which slew them by the
[1:12:22] hundreds of thousands till the blood ran
[1:12:25] out of the city. All of that cruelty I'm
[1:12:28] standing here publicly today declaring
[1:12:31] all of that cruelty still is under her
[1:12:34] skirts.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; All of that wickedness has not changed
[1:12:39] one iota.
[1:12:42] And he said there exactly the same
[1:12:44] spirit that was in pagan Rome simply
[1:12:48] took on a new uh a new identity as papal
[1:12:52] Rome.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; It has not changed. And so now here we
[1:12:56] are. Here we are. There was another era
[1:13:00] where these same people called the Jews
[1:13:03] became dispersed throughout the world.
[1:13:06] And they were dispersed in all countries
[1:13:10] all over the world. Be it South America,
[1:13:13] Russia, Soviet Union, formerly all
[1:13:16] nations of the world, even into the
[1:13:18] Muslim countries of Iraq and Iran and
[1:13:21] and down through the Arab nations and
[1:13:23] North Africa and so on. Jews were
[1:13:26] scattered all over and they became
[1:13:31] uh citizens of those countries. They
[1:13:34] held passports of those nations. They
[1:13:37] were identified. They were there for
[1:13:39] generations.
[1:13:41] They were there. They had uh they had
[1:13:43] their families and on on extended
[1:13:46] families. They had their businesses.
[1:13:48] They had their farms. Farms that had
[1:13:50] been handed down from generation to
[1:13:52] generation. And then when the end time
[1:13:55] came, now the brother Brandham says in
[1:13:58] the in the feast of the trumpets, he
[1:14:01] said those those spirits
[1:14:04] 200,000,000
[1:14:06] horsemen which were held at the river
[1:14:10] Euphrates. Now it's very interesting
[1:14:12] that the river Euphrates was the eastern
[1:14:15] boundary of the Roman Empire. They and
[1:14:19] he said they could not cross into the
[1:14:21] promised land. They could not come into
[1:14:24] the promise. Now, and but it was the
[1:14:26] eastern boundary of the Roman Empire and
[1:14:28] that's as far as they could go. And the
[1:14:31] prophet says those 200,000,000
[1:14:34] horsemen, he said they're not there
[1:14:36] isn't that many horsemen in the world.
[1:14:38] Said it's not a horsemen. A horse in the
[1:14:41] scripture is a power. A power. And he
[1:14:44] said these powers, he said they were
[1:14:46] chargers. He said they were demon
[1:14:49] spirits. There were spiritual forces,
[1:14:52] powers that were held there. And he said
[1:14:55] they were held there uh and under under
[1:15:00] uh uh traditions. They were bound by
[1:15:03] certain traditions. Now, you have to
[1:15:05] really put your mind to work now. And so
[1:15:08] the the Roman church, the Roman church,
[1:15:12] it wasn't what we have today, but they
[1:15:15] had traditions and and it it was it was
[1:15:18] it was not the Roman Catholic Church as
[1:15:22] such that had armies in power to go out
[1:15:25] and destroy, but they would consent to
[1:15:28] certain things. Now, just watch a moment
[1:15:31] and then I'm going to I'm going to read
[1:15:32] quotes as I come on, but he said the
[1:15:35] traditions
[1:15:36] held them. They were bound by
[1:15:38] traditions.
[1:15:40] See, and then he said they were loosed
[1:15:44] by dictators. Now he said in the
[1:15:47] scripture it says they received power as
[1:15:50] kings. Do you recall the scripture? They
[1:15:53] received power as kings. They were not
[1:15:56] kings. He says they were dictators. A
[1:15:59] Mussolini and a Stalin and a Hitler.
[1:16:02] They they had power as a king, but they
[1:16:05] were not kings. And that is why that is
[1:16:08] why the Roman church remained silent
[1:16:12] while these fellas went and did their
[1:16:15] business.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And he said that these chargers, these
[1:16:20] these persecution forces were loosed
[1:16:24] under the dictators. And he calls it he
[1:16:27] calls it in one place the trumpet the
[1:16:29] trumpet of persecution
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; because it actually was one of the
[1:16:35] trumpets that was being blown. You
[1:16:38] always think that we'll say well the
[1:16:39] feast of the trumpets oh something
[1:16:41] marvelous going to happen. You can't
[1:16:43] it's it's hard to relate. That's why I
[1:16:45] want you to think now. It's hard to
[1:16:47] relate that when that trumpet was being
[1:16:49] blown the people, it was a trumpet of
[1:16:52] persecution and those forces which was
[1:16:56] the old pagan Rome. The same power that
[1:16:59] they had back there and under pagan Rome
[1:17:03] slew millions of martyrs of the early
[1:17:08] Christians. But now they had been bound.
[1:17:11] He said for almost 2,000 years they'd
[1:17:14] been bound, but they were released under
[1:17:17] the dictators. And that is why the Roman
[1:17:20] church and the papacy and everything
[1:17:22] remained silent. They gave consent by
[1:17:25] silence to the thing that was taking
[1:17:28] place by the dictators because they were
[1:17:30] in agreement with the thing because it
[1:17:33] was the same spirit. And in fact, the
[1:17:36] prophet said that Rome was being
[1:17:39] revived. They were having I will put it
[1:17:42] this way. It was the false bride's
[1:17:44] revival.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; The false bride.
[1:17:52] Look at not very many years ago.
[1:17:57] Many of you here are young, but some of
[1:17:59] you have a few years under your shoe
[1:18:02] leather. And it was during your time. I
[1:18:06] can tell you that what has been
[1:18:07] happening in the
[1:18:10] within the
[1:18:13] powers and office of the Roman church
[1:18:16] has changed so dramatically and so
[1:18:19] quickly that even even the Catholic
[1:18:23] people themselves many have resented
[1:18:27] what the liberalization what they call
[1:18:29] the liberalization but they don't know
[1:18:31] what is being schemed and hatched out
[1:18:34] the liberalization is to swallow it up.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; So these here we are today
[1:18:53] and I feel like maybe I'm speaking to a
[1:18:55] lot of spiritual Jews
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; and you've got your homes and you've got
[1:19:01] your profession and you've got your
[1:19:04] business. It would be like before the
[1:19:06] trumpet of persecution, someone standing
[1:19:09] up in a synagogue and saying, "Listen,
[1:19:12] folks." Uh there there's there's there's
[1:19:15] things that are moving there. There's
[1:19:17] there's undercurrents here. There are
[1:19:19] things which are uh maybe not real good
[1:19:22] signals. Uh uh we've had a we've had a
[1:19:25] prophet and he has told us that these
[1:19:27] things were going to happen. They say,
[1:19:29] "What are you talking about? We've been
[1:19:31] here for we've been here for years.
[1:19:33] We've been here, in fact, is we've been
[1:19:34] here for centuries.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; We've been established. My
[1:19:39] great-grandfather had this business, had
[1:19:41] this farm. We've been here. My
[1:19:42] neighbors, I got the most wonderful
[1:19:44] neighbors. And you're trying to tell
[1:19:45] them there's a holocaust coming.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; They just said, "You have gone bazoon.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; We have wonderful friends here."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And we've got passports and we've got
[1:19:59] identification. and our kids are in
[1:20:01] school and my my young people are going
[1:20:04] to college and then we we got thing
[1:20:07] everything's going fine, everything's
[1:20:09] looking great. We feel real positive
[1:20:11] about the future. But the word of God
[1:20:15] had declared that he was going to call
[1:20:17] them back. They never do you listen to
[1:20:19] me now? They never dreamed in their
[1:20:22] wildest imagination that a trumpet would
[1:20:24] be blown under persecution. But the good
[1:20:27] part of that was God was going to use
[1:20:30] the extreme to get them back.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And if you're a son and daughter of God,
[1:20:37] he's going to use the extreme to get you
[1:20:40] in.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You might be able to get along and say,
[1:20:46] "Well, I can kind of hang loose and I
[1:20:47] can kind of think what I want to think.
[1:20:49] I can kind of, you know, go my own way."
[1:20:50] Yeah, the Lord's kind of talking me
[1:20:51] about it, but I mean, I'll leave it for
[1:20:53] another time. If you are a son and
[1:20:55] daughter of God, God is going to act.
[1:20:57] He's going to work on your case. And
[1:21:00] you'd be far better to feel the pull now
[1:21:02] and answer the call now than to wait for
[1:21:05] that time.
[1:21:15] and tried to warn the Jews not very many
[1:21:17] years ago
[1:21:19] not very many years ago had tried to
[1:21:22] tell them there is a terrible
[1:21:24] persecution coming because because we're
[1:21:27] not where we're supposed to be. You
[1:21:29] know, we're not supposed to be here in
[1:21:30] Poland. We're not supposed to be here in
[1:21:32] Germany. We're not supposed to be here
[1:21:34] in Russia. We're not supposed to be here
[1:21:36] in the United States. We're supposed to
[1:21:38] be in Israel.
[1:21:41] And it says in the scripture, and we can
[1:21:43] read it in here in in our Bible in the
[1:21:45] Torah, we can read where our God Jehovah
[1:21:49] said, "I'm going to drive you back. I'm
[1:21:53] going to get you back in your land." And
[1:21:55] if they had said, "It's written in the
[1:21:57] word, I'm going to get you back in the
[1:21:58] land," they might have said, "Well,
[1:22:00] yeah, but you know, we've been here for
[1:22:02] a long, long time. We're established
[1:22:04] here. How we, you know, we can't we
[1:22:06] can't really do it." God knew how to do
[1:22:08] it and he did do it. And God knows how
[1:22:11] to get you, how to get your profession
[1:22:14] in second place, how to get your
[1:22:16] education on down the line and how to
[1:22:19] get everything else that concerns you
[1:22:21] and seems to be number one. He'll get it
[1:22:23] where it belongs.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And he'll get himself number one in your
[1:22:26] life somehow or other.
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:31] They could never dream that there was
[1:22:34] such cruelty that there was such an
[1:22:36] enormous cruelty which was awaiting
[1:22:39] them. They couldn't believe it. And the
[1:22:41] disciples when they were asking Jesus,
[1:22:43] are you ready to establish the kingdom?
[1:22:46] No, it was completely the other way.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; They're going to completely lose the
[1:22:50] kingdom
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; as far as the as far as the outward and
[1:22:55] physical was concerned. I'm not talking
[1:22:57] about the spiritual kingdom, but they he
[1:23:00] little did they realize that such
[1:23:02] enormous cruelty still laid within the
[1:23:05] heart of Rome, pagan Rome at that time.
[1:23:09] And then they wrote in and they tried to
[1:23:11] withstand and we have a mada and we have
[1:23:14] the places where they took a stand and
[1:23:16] tried to resist and were just just
[1:23:19] crushed.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that that was there.
[1:23:25] And Jesus didn't detail it for him. He
[1:23:27] didn't say, "Look, this is what's going
[1:23:29] to happen. I want to inform you. I want
[1:23:30] to put you on the inside track. This is
[1:23:32] really what's going to happen." He
[1:23:33] didn't tell them that. He just said,
[1:23:35] "But you will receive power."
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You will receive power. I'd
[1:23:41] like to ask you people today, have you
[1:23:43] received that power? Have you received
[1:23:45] that Holy Ghost? Is he the one who's
[1:23:48] guiding your life? Is he the one who's
[1:23:49] directing your life? Is he the one who
[1:23:52] who is who who is giving is he your
[1:23:54] wisdom? Is he your decision maker?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to ask.
[1:24:10] It might do well if you'd like to turn
[1:24:13] in your Bibles to Deuteronomy 28.
[1:24:32] Deuteronomy 28
[1:24:35] uh speaks concerning the blessings of
[1:24:38] the land if they shall heed the word of
[1:24:41] God. But if they did not,
[1:24:45] the conditions which would bring
[1:24:48] curses and chastisement.
[1:24:52] But we he gets very much more specific
[1:24:55] if we get down to about verse 49.
[1:25:00] And the Lord shall bring a nation
[1:25:02] against thee from from far
[1:25:06] from the end of the earth as swift as
[1:25:08] the eagle flieth. A nation whose tongue
[1:25:12] thou shalt not understand. And now
[1:25:14] listen to this prophecy coming through
[1:25:16] the prophet Moses to these people saying
[1:25:19] if you will heed the word you'll be
[1:25:21] blessed. But if you don't heed the word,
[1:25:23] if you will not accept the word, then
[1:25:26] then this is the kind of result that's
[1:25:29] going to happen.
[1:25:30] and a nation of fierce countenance,
[1:25:33] which shall not regard the person of the
[1:25:36] old, nor show favor to the young. And he
[1:25:40] shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and
[1:25:43] the fruit of thy land, until thou be
[1:25:46] destroyed, which also shall not leave
[1:25:49] thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the
[1:25:52] in or the increase of thy kind, or
[1:25:55] flocks of thy sheep, until he have
[1:25:57] destroyed thee. and he shall besiege
[1:26:00] thee in all thy gates. And Rome is the
[1:26:04] only one that besieged Israel in all
[1:26:06] their gates.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; They completely encompass them. And this
[1:26:11] is nothing less than a prophecy of this
[1:26:14] same this same nation, pagan back then,
[1:26:17] prophesying of their pagan destruction,
[1:26:20] but now it's a spiritual thing. And
[1:26:22] they've got it is the same demons.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You need to say amen to it. It is the
[1:26:29] same demons. Don't think it's some far
[1:26:32] away distant place. You had a prophet
[1:26:35] messenger who spelled it out in great
[1:26:38] detail of what their plan was. And
[1:26:41] that's what you need to read and
[1:26:42] understand.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm helping you hopefully to
[1:26:45] understand today and perhaps this
[1:26:48] weakness of of you know of speech and so
[1:26:50] on, but you just try to get it, please.
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And he shall besiege thee in all thy
[1:26:55] gates, until thy high and fenced walls
[1:26:59] come down, wherein thou trustest
[1:27:02] throughout all thy land, and he shall
[1:27:04] besiege thee in all thy gates throughout
[1:27:06] all thy land, which the Lord thy God
[1:27:09] hath given thee. And thou shalt eat the
[1:27:12] fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
[1:27:15] thy sons, and of thy daughters, which
[1:27:17] the Lord thy God hath given thee in the
[1:27:19] siege, and in the straightness wherewith
[1:27:22] thine enemies shall distress thee. And
[1:27:24] the prophet said, they ate their their
[1:27:26] children.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And the prophet Moses is telling them
[1:27:30] that they will do it. And I guarantee
[1:27:33] you when they looked at their little
[1:27:35] lovely ones, they and heard the words of
[1:27:38] the prophet, they could not believe that
[1:27:41] anything that God would allow happen to
[1:27:43] them. We're God's elect. We're God's
[1:27:45] chosen. But if they would not heed the
[1:27:48] word of God, God will take whatever
[1:27:50] measures are necessary to make you and
[1:27:54] them believe in him.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] So that the man that is tender among you
[1:28:01] and very delicate, his eyes shall be
[1:28:04] evil toward his brother, and toward the
[1:28:06] wife of his bosom, and toward the
[1:28:10] remnant of his children, which he shall
[1:28:12] leave, even the attraction and the love
[1:28:15] of husband and wife would fail them
[1:28:18] because of the distress that Rome would
[1:28:21] put upon them. And so that he will not
[1:28:24] give he will not give to any of them of
[1:28:27] the flesh of his children whom he shall
[1:28:30] eat because he hath nothing left nothing
[1:28:33] left him in the siege and in the
[1:28:35] straightness wherewith thine enemies
[1:28:37] shall distress thee in all thy gates.
[1:28:40] The tender and delicate woman among you
[1:28:43] which would not adventure to set the
[1:28:45] soul of her foot upon the ground for
[1:28:47] delicateness and tenderness. Her eye
[1:28:50] shall be evil toward the husband of her
[1:28:53] bosom, and toward her son, and toward
[1:28:55] her daughter, and toward her young, one
[1:28:58] that cometh out from between her feet,
[1:29:01] and toward her children, which she shall
[1:29:03] bear. For she shall eat them. for want
[1:29:06] of all things secretly in the siege and
[1:29:09] straightness wherewith thine enemy shall
[1:29:12] distress thee in thy gates. If thou wilt
[1:29:14] not observe to do all the words of this
[1:29:18] law that are written in this book, that
[1:29:21] thou mayest fear this glorious and
[1:29:24] fearful name, the Lord thy God. And the
[1:29:27] people said,
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; that's God's word.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely God's truth.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Do you acknowledge that? Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just acknowledge it
[1:29:36] when it speaks all wonderful nice
[1:29:38] things. We want to acknowledge it
[1:29:40] because these prophecies are absolutely
[1:29:42] the truth.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And there's coming there's coming a time
[1:29:48] that may be very very soon upon us which
[1:29:51] is called a tribulation period. And that
[1:29:54] tribulation period is going to make
[1:29:56] anything that has come up up to this
[1:29:58] time like kindergarten stuff.
[1:30:01] It's going to be the same spirits.
[1:30:03] They've been they have been held back
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; as the Roman powers were held back by
[1:30:09] their traditions. See, the church was in
[1:30:11] power for a lot of years, but they were
[1:30:13] held back because they had their robes
[1:30:15] and their ecclesiastical things and
[1:30:18] their traditions and things. They
[1:30:19] weren't people to go out and they
[1:30:22] weren't released. They didn't have a
[1:30:24] release to go out and slaughter the
[1:30:27] people. But the spirits which were
[1:30:29] guiding that church was murderous.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And so and so those spirits caught into
[1:30:39] the those men that were dictators that
[1:30:42] were given power as kings, but they
[1:30:45] weren't crowned. They didn't have a
[1:30:47] crown, the scripture says, but they were
[1:30:49] given power as kings. And when they went
[1:30:52] out and exercised these powers, all of
[1:30:54] this holiness and all the rest of it
[1:30:56] were in absolute favor of what was
[1:30:59] taking place because it was the spirit
[1:31:01] that was bound by those traditions which
[1:31:04] was released from the traditions by
[1:31:06] cruel men.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And those demons guided those dictators
[1:31:11] to accomplish the church's purpose.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm making it clear.
[1:31:19] But to get people to understand and of
[1:31:22] and we of all people from all the ages,
[1:31:26] there's some cunning things that are
[1:31:27] taking place. Now, let me just go back a
[1:31:29] wee bit. If we go pre the second world
[1:31:33] war and you say, well, the Jewish people
[1:31:36] have been established and I don't need
[1:31:38] to enlarge on that. They they had their
[1:31:40] farms. They had their businesses. They
[1:31:41] had all of these things for them to
[1:31:43] imagine even uh the the crushing
[1:31:46] persecution which a prophet has called
[1:31:49] the trumpet of persecution. And that was
[1:31:52] the feast of what was the feast part of
[1:31:54] it. You mean 6 million of them uh being
[1:31:58] uh cremated was a feast. It was a feast
[1:32:01] in that they could not be blessed till
[1:32:03] they would get back in their homeland.
[1:32:06] And it took that to get them back. And
[1:32:09] getting them back was the feast.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; The holocaust or the persecution wasn't
[1:32:17] the feast. He said that was the trumpet,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That blasted
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; under those dictators. It blasted
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; until it would get those people back
[1:32:28] where they belong.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. And we've had
[1:32:34] seals opened and the seals are equal to
[1:32:37] the seals are equal to the trumpets. The
[1:32:39] trumpets are to Israel and the seals are
[1:32:42] to the Gentiles. And the seals have been
[1:32:44] open. Maybe we haven't even acknowledged
[1:32:47] it. They they they heard all about the
[1:32:49] trumpets, but they didn't see it happen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; They didn't see anything taking place.
[1:32:54] So why should they be concerned about
[1:32:56] You've heard about the seals being open.
[1:32:57] What does it mean? You don't even know.
[1:32:59] But if the things which are written in
[1:33:01] there start to happen and take place,
[1:33:03] you'll be very very interested in what
[1:33:05] it says.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:33:26] Now the old Roman Empire being revived.
[1:33:35] I'm reading now if you'll just have give
[1:33:37] me your attention from I'm reading from
[1:33:39] Revelation 9 and 13. And the sixth angel
[1:33:43] sounded, and I heard a voice from the
[1:33:46] four horns of the golden altar, which is
[1:33:49] before God, saying in the saying to the
[1:33:53] sixth angel, which had the trumpet,
[1:33:56] loose the four angels, which are bound
[1:33:58] in the great river Euphrates.
[1:34:01] See, that's as far as Rome. That was
[1:34:03] their farthest boundary.
[1:34:06] Now
[1:34:08] just for a moment the river Euphrates is
[1:34:11] one. There was a river that flowed
[1:34:13] through Eden
[1:34:15] and then it went into four heads.
[1:34:18] Four different rivers went out from that
[1:34:22] river.
[1:34:23] So you and the fourth one was e was
[1:34:27] Euphrates.
[1:34:29] You know, God has such a master plan, a
[1:34:32] hope that we can even get even if we get
[1:34:34] a snibble or two or a crumb or two, it
[1:34:37] will be sufficient.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But so Euphrates was in Eden.
[1:34:43] Euphrates when a Roman power took
[1:34:46] control of the land that Jesus would
[1:34:49] walk on, as far as they could go was
[1:34:52] Euphrates. And they were bound there.
[1:34:55] That was as far as they could go. and
[1:34:57] their evil work. Now, the scripture
[1:34:59] doesn't speak about everything they did
[1:35:01] to all other countries, but the
[1:35:03] scripture is in great detail of what
[1:35:05] they did to Palestine and how they dealt
[1:35:09] with God's people. See, you are God's
[1:35:12] inheritance.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Jacob is my people.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; God loved fatherhood.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You are the the result of his love for
[1:35:23] fatherhood. He wanted sons. He wanted
[1:35:27] daughters. He wanted a family. And
[1:35:30] brother Brandham says in Christ the
[1:35:31] mystery of God revealed. That was the
[1:35:34] first thing that he wanted to do was to
[1:35:35] express himself. That was the first
[1:35:37] thing he wanted to do. And the first
[1:35:39] expression that he refers to that he
[1:35:41] wanted to express was he said because he
[1:35:44] loved fatherhood.
[1:35:46] And he said he could only manifest that
[1:35:49] through the son of man. That is why when
[1:35:52] Jesus came as the son of man, God was
[1:35:56] expressing himself as a father. That was
[1:35:59] the first thing he wanted to do. He
[1:36:01] wanted to express himself, but he wanted
[1:36:03] to express himself as father. And so
[1:36:05] when the first first begotten of God
[1:36:08] came onto the earth as God, that's what
[1:36:11] he this what he said. This is my beloved
[1:36:16] son
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased. This is my
[1:36:21] beloved son. He wanted to be known to
[1:36:23] the people. I am a father.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And through this firstborn,
[1:36:29] I will bring forth many sons and
[1:36:32] daughters.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And you are here today if you believe
[1:36:37] the word of God as I think you do. You
[1:36:39] are here today. And I'm announcing to
[1:36:41] you, you are here as the result of
[1:36:44] Almighty God, the creator of heavens and
[1:36:47] earth, desiring with his first desire to
[1:36:50] have children,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; to have offspring, to have an attribute
[1:36:55] of his own being expressed here on the
[1:36:58] earth.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And more than that, he's
[1:37:02] allowed us to come at this time and to
[1:37:04] be this kind of light, this kind of uh
[1:37:07] manifestation of his attribute in the
[1:37:10] face of his arc enemy, Lucifer.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And there they are. Hallelujah. Try to
[1:37:17] deceive her if you want. You can't
[1:37:19] deceive her.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; She's she can't be deceived because
[1:37:24] she's an attribute of mine. and I'll
[1:37:26] make myself known to her in such a way
[1:37:30] that you won't be able to deceive her.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You can try and attract her. You can try
[1:37:35] and enchant her. Do whatever you want,
[1:37:37] but you'll not be you'll not succeed.
[1:37:40] And I'll just uh there there she is.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; She's on display.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Bound in the great river Euphrates.
[1:37:51] How are you going to figure that one out
[1:37:53] without a prophet?
[1:37:56] And the fourth angels, the four angels
[1:37:58] were loosed, which were prepared for an
[1:38:02] hour, and a day, and a month, and a year
[1:38:07] to slay the third part of men.
[1:38:11] And the number of the army of horsemen
[1:38:13] were 200,000,000.
[1:38:16] And I heard the number of them,
[1:38:21] chargers, spiritual chargers.
[1:38:24] that had been bound under this pagan
[1:38:28] system but would be released
[1:38:32] and pagan Rome would become papal Rome.
[1:38:36] The old Roman Empire had been bound for
[1:38:39] almost 2,000 years and it was revived
[1:38:44] and loosed through the power of the
[1:38:47] dictators in the feast of the trumpets.
[1:38:51] I'm just I'm giving you this now. Notice
[1:38:53] over in the Bible where they received
[1:38:55] power as kings but wasn't crowned a
[1:39:00] dictator's not a crown king but just
[1:39:04] just receives power as a king.
[1:39:09] Now
[1:39:12] uh I did tell a little bit about Eden.
[1:39:14] I'm going to go directly to the feast of
[1:39:16] the trumpets. For those of you who'd
[1:39:17] want to make a note down, this is on
[1:39:19] page 23. I'm going to go slowly now. He
[1:39:23] says, "Note in Revelation the 9th
[1:39:27] chapter in the 13th verse,
[1:39:30] the sixth trumpet,
[1:39:32] there was 200,000 horsemen
[1:39:36] that had been bound in the river
[1:39:38] Euphrates
[1:39:40] was turned loose
[1:39:42] under the sixth trumpet." Now, many of
[1:39:45] the things I might be saying say, "Well,
[1:39:46] I I I don't know. I'm not following you.
[1:39:48] Just hang in there.
[1:39:50] Just hang in there. Just hold it. Catch
[1:39:52] it as a lesson.
[1:39:55] They were loosed under the sixth
[1:39:56] trumpet.
[1:39:58] A trumpet is always to call the people
[1:40:01] together. Or the trumpet is for an
[1:40:03] announcement. The trumpet there was the
[1:40:05] feast of uh and and the and remember now
[1:40:10] I'm just my mind is going faster than I
[1:40:12] can speak. But the the trumpet that is
[1:40:14] sounding now, he's calling them. And the
[1:40:18] trumpet that was released, the trumpet
[1:40:20] of persecution which was released,
[1:40:22] persecution of the Jews was sounded and
[1:40:25] blasted out to take call them back. For
[1:40:29] a trumpet is to call them call the
[1:40:31] people to an announcement or something.
[1:40:33] And it called them
[1:40:36] back to their own country. And that
[1:40:40] trumpet sound was so loud, so clear, so
[1:40:47] commanding that even though they had
[1:40:50] left their homes, they had left their
[1:40:52] lands, the war was over, the
[1:40:54] persecution, the the world's telling
[1:40:56] them it's all over now. And they didn't
[1:40:59] want to go back. We don't want to go
[1:41:01] back. We want to now the blast was so
[1:41:04] strong. I just want to go home. I want
[1:41:07] to go back to my land that they hadn't
[1:41:09] been hardly given yet. 1948 hadn't
[1:41:12] rolled around. The United Nations hadn't
[1:41:14] voted and made him a nation. But we want
[1:41:16] to go back. It was so powerful. I'm
[1:41:19] telling you, my brother, my sister, God
[1:41:21] knows how to dig down into your life and
[1:41:24] make you homesick for heaven
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and make you very unhappy with the best
[1:41:30] that this life can give you. I don't
[1:41:32] care what you have in this life. It it
[1:41:34] it doesn't even it's not even a snap
[1:41:37] compared to what God has for you
[1:41:41] and you might have to fight your way
[1:41:42] there. And they got there on boats and
[1:41:44] were turned back said go to Cyprus.
[1:41:47] We're going to put you in another
[1:41:48] concentration camp. But they could not
[1:41:51] lose their desire. Not because how did
[1:41:54] that happen with hundreds of thousands
[1:41:56] of people? How did that happen? It was a
[1:41:58] supernatural blast
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; of God's trumpet.
[1:42:03] Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't escape it.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And God knows how to bring us around. He
[1:42:09] know how to deal with natural Israel. He
[1:42:11] sure knows how to deal with us.
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me to help me to say it.
[1:42:19] Help me to preach it. Help you to get
[1:42:20] it.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "They weren't natural horses.
[1:42:30] They breathed fire and they had
[1:42:33] breastplates of jasper. They had tails
[1:42:36] and the ends of the tails looked like a
[1:42:38] serpent. A snake's head on the end of it
[1:42:40] stinging. It was spiritual horses,
[1:42:43] spiritual devils, chargers that had been
[1:42:46] bound in the Euphrates all these years.
[1:42:50] Supernatural devils. What was it? He
[1:42:52] says, "What was all this?" Now maybe you
[1:42:54] don't know the you don't know what the
[1:42:57] uh symbol is because it is so rich and
[1:43:00] deep in symbolism. You have to have a
[1:43:02] prophet. You'll get nowhere without a
[1:43:04] prophet. And he said he asked what was
[1:43:06] it? Nobody would ever tell you this. You
[1:43:08] won't get this any other book. And here
[1:43:10] it is right here. It is the old Roman
[1:43:14] Empire being revived.
[1:43:17] The persecution of the Jews. So they
[1:43:20] were being revived.
[1:43:22] Hallelujah. The old Roman Empire was
[1:43:25] being revived under the persecution. And
[1:43:28] I can just tell you, I just showed you a
[1:43:29] picture where the the presidents of the
[1:43:32] most powerful nation on earth bowing in
[1:43:36] front of that power,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; the demised
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; pope. And he talks about the beast that
[1:43:43] was and the beast that is and is yet to
[1:43:46] come. He said that's the succession of
[1:43:48] popes from one to the other. He said in
[1:43:51] pagan Rome the king died and there was
[1:43:54] no more king. Maybe another one could
[1:43:56] come but he couldn't be in the same
[1:43:58] power. Look at where where's pagan Rome
[1:44:01] today? It doesn't exist.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; They could have king after king after
[1:44:05] king but they didn't follow with the
[1:44:07] same authority in the same power. But
[1:44:09] because this this demon force has has
[1:44:12] traced itself and gives itself
[1:44:14] authenticity from being back in in Peter
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; saying we're from Peter and we have a
[1:44:21] solid connection all the way through and
[1:44:24] it passes from one to the other. The
[1:44:26] beast that was is the same as the beast
[1:44:28] that is. And this beast is the same as
[1:44:30] one that's going to come.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; And they just take the mantle of the
[1:44:35] last one and go forward with the same
[1:44:38] power and the same authority because
[1:44:40] it's a beast power and it's a spiritual
[1:44:43] thing.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that when brother
[1:44:47] Brandham spoke this, they wouldn't even
[1:44:48] have a pope come to America.
[1:44:51] They wouldn't allow him on the on the
[1:44:53] front lawn or in the rose garden or in
[1:44:55] the oval office. They would not allow
[1:44:57] him there. But Eli but but when Elijah
[1:45:00] was here, I'll tell you another Ahab was
[1:45:03] here also. And Ahab opened the door for
[1:45:06] Rome.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And a Time magazine said that President
[1:45:11] Kennedy opened the door. And they said
[1:45:13] it would have even been thought that a
[1:45:15] pope could come in the back door, but
[1:45:17] now they said he can come in the front
[1:45:18] door.
[1:45:22] And this beast power has has been so
[1:45:24] magnificent and so grand that it has
[1:45:27] swept in the most powerful nation on
[1:45:30] earth
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and had their presidents scandalous.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Bow in front of that dead carcass.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not even American.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; But neither am I Canadian.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I'm Christian.
[1:45:50] I'm a believer. I have my passport in
[1:45:53] heaven.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got my citizenship in
[1:45:58] another country. And my heart yearns for
[1:46:02] that country.
[1:46:05] I don't care what kind of a boat they
[1:46:06] put you on and say you can't get there
[1:46:08] yet. You can't you got to go through
[1:46:10] this. You got to whatever we have to go
[1:46:12] through. So be it. We'll go through it
[1:46:15] cuz we're going home.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Who go with me to my father's house?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] [Applause]
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; It's the old Roman Empire. He said, "And
[1:46:32] they'd been bound for nearly 2,000 years
[1:46:34] of the river Euphrates can't cross to
[1:46:37] the promise, a religious sect that was
[1:46:40] trying to get to the other side. Uh
[1:46:43] Euphrates, you know, came through Eden,
[1:46:46] but they were bound there for 2,000
[1:46:49] years. 2 thou 200,000 devils of
[1:46:53] persecution. And notice what happens.
[1:46:57] I'm just taking certain segments.
[1:47:00] Notice what happens under the sixth
[1:47:01] trumpet. They were turned loose on the
[1:47:05] Jews. The persecution of the Jews,
[1:47:08] supernatural devils. Now I want you to
[1:47:11] understand that's why I've been
[1:47:12] preaching here even even pre going to
[1:47:15] Awitzen since that it we we are not of
[1:47:19] one nation or another nation. This
[1:47:21] wasn't one nation or another nation.
[1:47:24] This wasn't just Mussolini or Hitler and
[1:47:26] Stalin. These were supernatural devils.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody can even imagine the kind of
[1:47:32] atrocities and human suffering that
[1:47:35] those pe it wasn't those men that
[1:47:37] brought it. It was a demon that inspired
[1:47:39] them.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just Jews. There were
[1:47:44] others.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I read things and there are people who
[1:47:48] really withstand the the Roman power and
[1:47:51] Romans it is and the papacy and all the
[1:47:53] rest of it. They're absolutely livid
[1:47:55] with the things that take place and all
[1:47:57] the rest of it. And when they took the
[1:47:59] Jews, they didn't just take Jews to the
[1:48:01] various camps. There was there were uh
[1:48:04] uh Jehovah's Witnesses.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There were Polish people.
[1:48:08] Polish people were the first ones to die
[1:48:11] in Ashwitz,
[1:48:14] British soldiers, Russian soldiers.
[1:48:18] Homosexuals were taken in and many were
[1:48:21] slain. There were other groups that were
[1:48:23] taken in. There might be other groups
[1:48:25] that were taken in, but as far as God
[1:48:27] was concerned, he blew the trumpet for
[1:48:31] one people. And as far as the seals are
[1:48:34] concerned, he opened them for one
[1:48:36] people.
[1:48:38] [Applause]
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Look how the prophet cried out against
[1:48:49] this marology
[1:48:51] and this worship of women. How he
[1:48:54] screamed about it.
[1:48:57] And now here are the leaders of the
[1:49:00] world. so enamored and so taken in by
[1:49:04] the events of the last 2 three weeks in
[1:49:08] the Vatican City. It is reported
[1:49:11] applause rang out as John Paul's simple
[1:49:15] wooden coffin adorned with a cross and
[1:49:18] an M for Mary.
[1:49:22] That is blasphemous. Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; The cross that my savior suffered and
[1:49:28] died and gave the blood of the newly
[1:49:32] created blood by almighty God quad blood
[1:49:35] like no man had. This was a new creation
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; and suffered under that agony and gave
[1:49:41] his blood as a sacrifice. No man takes
[1:49:44] my life. I lay it down. I'll take it up
[1:49:46] again. Here comes now a leader that is
[1:49:50] has the world bowing before him putting
[1:49:53] a big M with a cross.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; There's no part of the suffering.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Even the Lord himself call her call her
[1:50:02] woman.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Speak to John. Take care of her. She had
[1:50:08] to go to Pentecost
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:50:14] Yes, sir.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Her womb was just a incubator.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Satan took Eve's head and God took
[1:50:23] Mary's womb
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; and gave us a savior.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:39] Jesus said, "Woe unto you scribes,
[1:50:41] Pharisees, hypocrites." Now, I'm I'm
[1:50:44] reading this in connection to
[1:50:48] how how how they bind people to the
[1:50:51] traditions and their creeds. It's
[1:50:54] phenomenal.
[1:50:55] And Jesus said, "Woe to you Pharisees,
[1:50:57] hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom
[1:51:00] of heaven against men. For you neither
[1:51:03] go in yourselves, and neither suffer ye
[1:51:06] them that are entering to go in.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Now, neither could these go in. They
[1:51:16] were bound by ecclesiastical powers,
[1:51:19] traditions, and creeds. Now, I I I don't
[1:51:22] know if you probably just won't catch it
[1:51:24] just immediately, but
[1:51:28] I I think I've established that the
[1:51:30] pagan system, it was bound and Rome
[1:51:36] who had become papal Rome had become an
[1:51:39] ecclesiastical
[1:51:42] system. The system I talked about power
[1:51:45] now I'm talking about the power of the
[1:51:47] system.
[1:51:49] It's incredible.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; How do you hold? How do you even
[1:51:53] imagine? How do you fathom holding 1
[1:51:57] billion people?
[1:51:59] It's the power of the system. Amen.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; They may have little different beliefs
[1:52:05] and ideas, but the system, the actual
[1:52:08] structure of the system holds the souls
[1:52:11] of 1 billion people walking on the face
[1:52:14] of the earth and and controls
[1:52:19] the thoughts of hundreds of millions
[1:52:22] more.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You got to give me a little while.
[1:52:32] He said in the feast of the trumpets on
[1:52:34] page 24 he said there's that Roman
[1:52:37] Empire bound there by what? By
[1:52:40] ecclesiastical powers. Powers.
[1:52:43] Ecclesiastical stuff has power to it.
[1:52:47] And he said they're bound by
[1:52:48] ecclesiastical powers. The Roman Empire
[1:52:51] bound by ecclesiastical powers which
[1:52:54] Rome, pagan Rome become papal Rome and
[1:52:57] was bound there in its traditions of
[1:53:01] Christian. Listen very close. It was
[1:53:04] bound there in its tradition of
[1:53:07] Christian or what part of Christian and
[1:53:12] superstition. So what part of Christian
[1:53:14] they had adopted?
[1:53:16] They're bound by that because they made
[1:53:18] a tradition out of it.
[1:53:21] You know, let me just drop this in.
[1:53:23] Brother Bram says when God send the
[1:53:25] people a prophet and then they make a
[1:53:27] tradition out of their prophet,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; they build a tradition and make a
[1:53:33] tradition and the tradition begins to
[1:53:35] bind the people rather than the very
[1:53:37] word that the messenger brought.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; The word is Christ.
[1:53:42] We're married to Christ,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; not on some traditional I'm a believer.
[1:53:47] You Mal Malachi 4, Luke 17:30 and all of
[1:53:48] that. That's not it. It's what are we
[1:53:51] living?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[1:53:57] And he says they were by what part of
[1:53:59] Christian tradition
[1:54:01] and superstitions it had of Rome
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; putting together all these worship of
[1:54:09] women and all these other kind of stuff
[1:54:11] and Christian Christmas days and
[1:54:14] holidays and holy days and things. It's
[1:54:18] bound by that tradition and it cannot
[1:54:20] let loose.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; It can't let loose of those traditions.
[1:54:24] It can't let loose. I hope you're
[1:54:26] understanding me. It can't let loose of
[1:54:28] those traditions because it is those
[1:54:30] traditions that give them the power to
[1:54:33] hold the people in a false religion.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; So they can't let loose of them.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; But they have murder in their heart.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; The spirit that dominates them is
[1:54:50] against God's people.
[1:54:52] And in their mind, the Jews are a
[1:54:55] problem. And so they fabricate, "The
[1:54:58] Jews killed Jesus."
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And the Jews say, "The Romans, you
[1:55:02] killed them."
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And that has been their centuries old
[1:55:08] argument. But you know what? Of all
[1:55:11] things, they're solving it just now.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; They're solving it just now. We won't
[1:55:20] say you killed him anymore. And Israel
[1:55:23] says, "Okay, if you do that, we'll play
[1:55:25] on the same block. We won't say you
[1:55:28] killed him."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Stupid people.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was God's lamb.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; God sacrificed him
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he's going to raise him up
[1:55:43] again.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:52] And he says, "The same ungodly pagan
[1:55:55] spirit." And listen to this now. He
[1:55:58] stops. Listen close. And he says, "And
[1:56:01] that spirit,
[1:56:03] whatever I've described to you now, he
[1:56:06] said, "And that spirit caught
[1:56:10] into the nations of the world."
[1:56:16] That spirit. And that is why now there
[1:56:20] comes just little things that you've
[1:56:21] never heard before rising up in America
[1:56:26] and in this country.
[1:56:28] Oh uh
[1:56:31] we got you know these problem these
[1:56:34] people uh it comes from the religious
[1:56:37] right.
[1:56:39] They've coined little cute phrases and
[1:56:42] what they're really saying is believers
[1:56:44] of the Bible,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; people who believe the whole scripture,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; they've got you identified now. And
[1:56:50] that's the first thing they did to bring
[1:56:52] under the trumpet to bring the Jews to
[1:56:54] their persecution. They had to first
[1:56:56] identify which group they're going to
[1:56:59] single out.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; And that demon that was directing them
[1:57:02] was saying that's the group.
[1:57:06] They're not the only people who are
[1:57:08] giving us trouble because in Germany
[1:57:11] there were German people who gave them
[1:57:13] trouble
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; and they had lots of them in prison
[1:57:16] because they were political prisoners.
[1:57:18] And some of those, believe it or not,
[1:57:20] even German people went to the German
[1:57:22] concentration camp and were under the SS
[1:57:26] troops.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; You're silent. I hope you're getting
[1:57:31] what I'm saying. There were a lot of
[1:57:33] groups that were giving those people
[1:57:34] problem, but there was one group that
[1:57:37] gave them a lot of problem because those
[1:57:40] people held the testimony of the word of
[1:57:42] God.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Say, well, there's a lot of
[1:57:46] fundamentals. There a lot of people out
[1:57:48] here that give us trouble, but there is
[1:57:50] one group. They dress different
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; and they act different and they've got a
[1:57:57] different air about them and they're not
[1:57:59] the same even to these other
[1:58:01] fundamentals and while we don't care for
[1:58:03] these others but these people really
[1:58:05] give us problem and look what they say
[1:58:08] and I can hear it coming from the inner
[1:58:10] sanctums of the Vatican saying to
[1:58:13] leaders that would bow before their dead
[1:58:16] pole
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; you have a people
[1:58:20] there trouble to us.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; We want you to fix the problem.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Shut them down.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; In fact, it would please us if you made
[1:58:31] their churches warehouses.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; It would please us if you make sure
[1:58:38] they're not on the internet anymore.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; These things that they're saying about
[1:58:42] us are really by your own by your own
[1:58:46] laws illegal.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. You know what?
[1:58:53] We'd suddenly find ourselves
[1:58:56] in a strange problem. You brothers that
[1:58:58] are police
[1:59:00] upholders
[1:59:02] of the law, you'd find yourself where
[1:59:05] John in China is after arresting us and
[1:59:10] feeling so despondent over it because in
[1:59:12] inside he did not want but the power of
[1:59:15] the system said arrest them. Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Who do you listen to?
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; The system or your heart?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; They'd love to have more children. Can
[1:59:30] you have a Why don't you have another
[1:59:31] child? Oh, he said that's not possible.
[1:59:34] Why? It's against the law.
[1:59:37] Oh,
[1:59:39] so now it's the system.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to bow to one or the other.
[1:59:44] As far as I'm concerned, I think it's
[1:59:46] time we we don't wait till the future,
[1:59:49] but we settle it right now. I bow to
[1:59:51] this and this alone.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I pledge allegiance to the lamb and to
[1:59:55] the lamb alone.
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:06] And that spirit caught into
[2:00:10] the nations of the world according to
[2:00:12] the prophecies of Ezekiel and the rest
[2:00:15] of them. And they were loosed upon the
[2:00:17] Jew who knew nothing of that spirit.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Knew nothing of that spirit. And there's
[2:00:23] your mysteries hid under the seal there.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:35] As I said earlier,
[2:00:38] that is why when you hear and see things
[2:00:41] uh
[2:00:43] and one of the things that came up that
[2:00:45] if you followed news at all, that's one
[2:00:48] of the things that you know became quite
[2:00:50] prominent at this time was here's the
[2:00:53] 60th anniversary of Awitz and soon after
[2:00:57] this Pope hope goes and another one
[2:00:59] comes and there's a whole lot of things
[2:01:01] that are happening and things that are
[2:01:03] happening for the first first time
[2:01:06] for the first time.
[2:01:10] Putout
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; is now in has just visited Israel for
[2:01:17] the first time
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; that a Russian leader has visited
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; first time.
[2:01:24] And when Russia goes down there for that
[2:01:26] oil
[2:01:27] and he wants to set up his own road map
[2:01:30] to peace because he feels that Bushes
[2:01:32] isn't working and he would like to make
[2:01:35] himself as some leader in that area for
[2:01:40] influence. Friends, there's things
[2:01:42] happening. You just pull up to the pumps
[2:01:43] and say, "Wow, the gas is a dollar a
[2:01:46] liter, whatever more." But there's
[2:01:48] forces and there's things that are
[2:01:49] completely out of our control, but we
[2:01:51] don't care. Like the Jews there, they
[2:01:53] didn't know nothing about it. We don't
[2:01:54] know nothing about it.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; We don't care. This world's not our
[2:01:57] home.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Move out of my way. I'm headed home.
[2:02:03] [Applause]
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:11] Can I have a few more few more minutes?
[2:02:14] Now, brother Brandham, some of this
[2:02:17] going to be shocking,
[2:02:19] but I just want you to pay strict
[2:02:21] attention. I'm not going to read all
[2:02:22] this. I'm just going to read a few
[2:02:23] lines, but listen very close. Brother
[2:02:26] Brandham talked about David Duplly
[2:02:29] perhaps between se 70 and 100 times in
[2:02:32] the message. David Duploy from Africa
[2:02:36] from South Africa is a great scholarly
[2:02:39] man and he was with brother Brandham on
[2:02:42] the platform. He arranged meetings for
[2:02:44] him.
[2:02:46] He was in Jeffersonville. He was on the
[2:02:49] platform.
[2:02:51] Brother Brandham calls him a great
[2:02:53] friend.
[2:02:58] And then
[2:03:00] down finally when it got to about 1963
[2:03:02] in the message, Souls that are in
[2:03:04] prison,
[2:03:06] in fact is it's not souls that are in
[2:03:08] prison. That's not the that's not the
[2:03:10] message title. It's souls that are in
[2:03:13] prison now.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's crying out. He
[2:03:20] says the council of churches over there
[2:03:24] that's meeting in Rome.
[2:03:26] This circular letter that my good friend
[2:03:29] David Duples
[2:03:32] when I sat there and I cried to him
[2:03:35] about it in in in 14 mile creek. There
[2:03:38] was a certain place they were at not
[2:03:40] long ago. Not realizing that he swung
[2:03:43] the church right into Babylon.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Right. when everybody's saying, "Oh, all
[2:03:49] the churches are going to be one now."
[2:03:51] Yeah, I know that. Just exactly what's
[2:03:55] wrote on my book of prophecy in 1933.
[2:04:00] 19 and 33. Listen, friends, can you put
[2:04:03] things together? That was right when the
[2:04:05] Nazi power was was devising a a what
[2:04:10] they were going to do when they got into
[2:04:12] power.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; They were just coming into power. And
[2:04:15] here for coming against a natural Jew.
[2:04:18] And here was God devising his plan to
[2:04:23] release upon the bride so that we who
[2:04:26] would come along and years later would
[2:04:28] be free from the bondage of the system.
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; And he says it would take place. He
[2:04:40] says, "Why don't you realize that
[2:04:43] Satan's uniting together?" The Bible
[2:04:46] says that. And just after a bit, just a
[2:04:48] little while, as soon as they become
[2:04:50] one, then he notice as soon as they
[2:04:53] become one, he was saying, be declaring
[2:04:55] plainly, they aren't yet. But he also is
[2:04:58] prophesying they will.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Now, if they hadn't happened, well, I
[2:05:02] wouldn't be standing here. But what he
[2:05:04] prophesied just in straight statements
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; happening one after the other.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not drowning you.
[2:05:22] Ark of the beast rise.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; David Duples.
[2:05:28] I'd like to have had this all on a on a
[2:05:31] overhead for you and then you could read
[2:05:33] it, but you you just have to try to
[2:05:35] catch it.
[2:05:38] David Dupacy, one of the key men, this
[2:05:40] this is not a quote now. This is of his
[2:05:42] life. Just a few lines. One of the key
[2:05:45] men in bringing together Pentecostalism
[2:05:47] and Catholics. This is this is read of
[2:05:50] him and attribute to him.
[2:05:54] By the 1950s, Duples became immersed in
[2:05:58] the task of ecumenism.
[2:06:00] He preached that God was pouring out the
[2:06:03] latter reign power just preceding
[2:06:05] Christ's return. He became friends with
[2:06:08] the modernistic leaders of the world
[2:06:10] council of churches and participated in
[2:06:13] the second assembly of the WCC world
[2:06:15] council of churches in 1954
[2:06:19] and in the third assembly in 1961.
[2:06:22] Now, brother Brandham cried out against
[2:06:23] him just before 1963. He had been his
[2:06:26] friend sitting with him and so on. He
[2:06:28] said he was invited to the Vatican to
[2:06:31] speak personally with Pope John the 23d
[2:06:34] and was the only Pentecostal invited to
[2:06:36] attend the only Pentecostal invited to
[2:06:40] attend the Vatican 2 council of the mid
[2:06:44] 1960s.
[2:06:46] In his biography he testified that his
[2:06:49] heart broke and he literally wept during
[2:06:52] the performance of the Catholic mass.
[2:06:55] is a man who got brother Brandham into
[2:06:58] South Africa
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; when he met with 24 modernistic
[2:07:06] ecumenical leaders in 1956 for example
[2:07:09] he said he felt a warm glow come over
[2:07:13] him oh how he needed the message the
[2:07:15] greatest battle ever fought to find out
[2:07:17] it has nothing to do with a warm glow
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; it has to do with what the word of God
[2:07:22] has declared it only what the word of
[2:07:24] God and what you have in your emotions.
[2:07:26] You might have had a warm glow. You
[2:07:28] might have one now. Don't even pay any
[2:07:30] attention to it. Or you might say, "Your
[2:07:32] message is leaving me cold. Don't pay
[2:07:34] any attention to that. It's not whether
[2:07:36] it leaves you warm or leaves you cold.
[2:07:38] It's whether that's sayeth the Lord or
[2:07:40] not. That's what counts. Has nothing to
[2:07:43] do with how you're feeling. Has nothing
[2:07:45] to do with it brought a tear to your eye
[2:07:48] or left you dryed. It has nothing to do
[2:07:50] with that. It has to do with whether
[2:07:52] it's a truth of God's word or not.
[2:07:58] And he said he felt a warm glow come
[2:08:00] over him. Look at what the warm glow did
[2:08:01] for him. And his attitude of judging
[2:08:04] doctrine melted away. These are his own
[2:08:08] words.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; A warm glow came over him and the and
[2:08:15] and his attitude
[2:08:18] of judging doctrine melted away. A warm
[2:08:22] glow caused doctrine to become
[2:08:25] nonimportant.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "I felt such love and
[2:08:30] compassion for those ecclesiastical
[2:08:33] leaders that I would rather have died
[2:08:36] for them than pass sentence upon them."
[2:08:38] And he contra he contrasted that with
[2:08:40] the old days when he would have
[2:08:42] denounced their false doctrine.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Those were his old days.
[2:08:52] He said when he first visited Vatican,
[2:08:55] Dupacy claimed that a similar experience
[2:08:59] caused his prejudice against Catholicism
[2:09:02] to melt away so that thereafter he could
[2:09:05] readily accept priests as brothers in
[2:09:07] Christ without any judgmentalism
[2:09:09] whatsoever regarding their doctrine
[2:09:13] through powerful. I want you to hang on.
[2:09:15] I got another 10 minutes or so and I
[2:09:17] want you to listen very very close.
[2:09:19] Notice now through doctrine he the thing
[2:09:22] of doctrine melted away. Brother
[2:09:24] Brandham says I got the quote. I haven't
[2:09:25] got the time to read it to you. He says
[2:09:28] you will have to surrender your
[2:09:31] fundamental teachings
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; for this unity for this oneness to take
[2:09:37] place. And here he's saying and he's the
[2:09:39] leader of it of the movement. And he
[2:09:42] says without any judgmental whatsoever
[2:09:45] regarding their doctrine and through
[2:09:48] powerful
[2:09:50] emotional
[2:09:52] experiences
[2:09:53] at mass
[2:09:56] during the Vatican 2 council duplic
[2:10:06] doctrine.
[2:10:10] So now the doctrine
[2:10:13] and this is a man that is leading the
[2:10:15] last church
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; age Pentecostalism
[2:10:20] back to mana.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; And folks, this isn't history. You're
[2:10:27] living in it.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; This is what's happening.
[2:10:33] And now
[2:10:35] now I'm going to read to you what the
[2:10:38] Catholic theologians and leaders declare
[2:10:42] about the same movement.
[2:10:45] Are you with me?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; So the one the movement on one a warm
[2:10:50] glow on the Pentecostals cuz that's what
[2:10:52] they experienced. And here a prophet if
[2:10:55] they'd listened to him said the speaking
[2:10:57] in tongues and all of the shaking and
[2:10:59] all of this thing that's not the
[2:11:01] evidence. He said it's a evidence but
[2:11:03] it's not the evidence of the Holy
[2:11:06] Spirit.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; You can speak in English and have the
[2:11:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; You can.
[2:11:17] And now here's from the postvatican
[2:11:20] itself
[2:11:22] in an ecumenical response to the
[2:11:25] neopentecostal movement that spread in
[2:11:28] evangelical and liberal circles in the
[2:11:32] Catholic faith. says that a baptism of
[2:11:35] the Holy Spirit including speaking in
[2:11:38] tongues was evidenced by a Roman
[2:11:40] Catholic retreat at uh Dukeine or
[2:11:45] whatever university in 1967 and it
[2:11:48] spread to Southbend Indiana and to Ann
[2:11:51] Arbor then over the world. At first the
[2:11:55] movement was viewed with extreme
[2:11:57] caution. I've said to you over this
[2:12:00] pulpit many times that at the first
[2:12:03] world council of churches meeting which
[2:12:06] was 1948
[2:12:08] when Israel was established because here
[2:12:10] come a prophet saying it's uniting time
[2:12:12] everything's uniting churches are
[2:12:14] uniting Israel is uniting the nations
[2:12:17] are uniting
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; and here of course the same spirit's on
[2:12:22] these people are you with me
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; and and at those first meeting the
[2:12:29] Catholic Church was not a part. I have
[2:12:32] the three there's only three
[2:12:34] denominations are part but there were
[2:12:37] 147 represented in the first meeting and
[2:12:40] the Catholics were not part of it.
[2:12:44] They were only observers.
[2:12:47] I just want you to see friends where
[2:12:49] they've gone from observers
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; to controllers.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; From observers to controllers.
[2:12:58] from one who couldn't get into the White
[2:13:00] House, couldn't get onto the lawn, now
[2:13:02] comes in and tells the president what to
[2:13:04] do.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; And here's what they say.
[2:13:12] It was with extreme caution, but it was
[2:13:16] demonstrated that Catholics in the
[2:13:18] charismatic movement, and listen, while
[2:13:21] this was happening, here's a prophet
[2:13:22] screaming out, "Don't do it. Come out of
[2:13:24] her. Come out of her, my people. Come
[2:13:26] out of her. Don't be a part of her
[2:13:27] pledge. Don't be a part of her sins.
[2:13:29] Come out. Come out.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; They're saying, uh, he preached serpent
[2:13:33] seed.
[2:13:36] Tell little stories or whatever more he
[2:13:38] preaches. He doesn't believe in the
[2:13:40] trinity
[2:13:43] and taint and slander,
[2:13:46] a spotless ministry.
[2:13:49] In the meantime, going back to the great
[2:13:51] who has the blood of millions
[2:13:55] under her skirts,
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; you ought to stand up and say, "Amen."
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; That God should ever come and give us
[2:14:04] this kind of understanding.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; And he says that Catholics in the
[2:14:10] charismatic movement received, here's
[2:14:13] what they received. Mr. duplic received
[2:14:16] a glow and a complete purging of the
[2:14:20] importance of doctrine. Didn't care what
[2:14:22] they taught. Mary, Trinity, purgatory,
[2:14:25] the whole bit.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; All the superstitions and stuff and
[2:14:29] nonsense and all the goofy hats and all
[2:14:32] the robes and everything else without
[2:14:34] the audacity to say this is utter
[2:14:36] nonsense.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't you men just put on some
[2:14:38] clothes and stop looking like a bunch of
[2:14:40] women?
[2:14:45] You know what? Even amongst believers
[2:14:46] today, they kind of shun and shy away.
[2:14:48] Brother brother Reagan told me when he
[2:14:50] bring up these subjects, he said, you
[2:14:51] know, it falls a little bit quiet. Don't
[2:14:54] you dare fall quiet.
[2:14:57] Don't you dare leave me with just with
[2:14:58] my neck on the line. I want you to join
[2:15:00] me. Don't say, "Who's on the Lord's
[2:15:02] side? Come with me."
[2:15:05] Hallelujah.
[2:15:11] And he says that those that came in the
[2:15:12] charismatic movement received a greater
[2:15:15] appreciation for the mass marry and the
[2:15:19] sacraments. That's what the charismatic
[2:15:21] movement did for them
[2:15:24] and more support was received by the
[2:15:26] hierarchy.
[2:15:27] Charismatic meetings exist in almost
[2:15:29] every country. There are numerous
[2:15:32] charismatic bishops including one
[2:15:34] Cardinal Leo Suninins of Belgium. John
[2:15:39] Paul 2, this one that you just saw
[2:15:42] laying on the on the board commissioned
[2:15:45] Cardinal Sunnins
[2:15:47] to guide the evolution of the Catholic
[2:15:51] Charismatic renewal so that this was his
[2:15:54] commission so that it enters fully into
[2:15:58] the heart of the church. Right.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Pentecost sold themselves out.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; It's the two three popes ago sold
[2:16:08] themselves out, invited the man, gave
[2:16:11] him the kind of a, you know, respect and
[2:16:14] whatever more and swept it in. Of
[2:16:17] course, they had to do it.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; It had to be that way. Oh, thank God. I
[2:16:22] got out just in time. Hallelujah. I got
[2:16:25] out just in time. Just in time. Oh my
[2:16:29] goodness. I feel like having a jubilee.
[2:16:33] I feel like having rejoicing.
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:37] Hallelujah.
[2:16:42] I'm done. Just a few moments. I got I'm
[2:16:44] going to be finished.
[2:16:47] They had an ecumenical charismatic
[2:16:50] renewal conference in Kansas City
[2:16:54] and a bunch of names but Lutheran
[2:16:56] Baptist Episcopalian Catholic Methodist
[2:16:58] Orthodox Jesus for Jews
[2:17:02] Pentecostal Holiness
[2:17:04] Dr. David Duply, Cardinal Leo Sumins,
[2:17:09] Ruth Carter Stapleton, which is
[2:17:11] President Carter, his sister, and quite
[2:17:16] a number of others. Those are the
[2:17:18] dignitaries which were present. I'm not
[2:17:22] saying it was at this conference that
[2:17:23] this next quote came from, but this is
[2:17:25] from this is from a an article at the
[2:17:29] Pentecostal movement in the Catholic
[2:17:31] Church.
[2:17:33] And this is one of their leaders and
[2:17:35] theologians now speaking and I quote and
[2:17:37] I want you to listen
[2:17:40] over here. This been the purpose of one
[2:17:42] of the purpose of this meeting. Over
[2:17:43] here
[2:17:45] the last church age Pentecostal
[2:17:49] swallowed up into Rome and testified his
[2:17:53] major points that doctrine was not
[2:17:56] important. Amen. I was completely purged
[2:18:01] of the importance of doctrine.
[2:18:04] Now one of their people who has received
[2:18:07] what he said he has, this is the effect
[2:18:11] on him.
[2:18:13] Rebaptism, quote, rebaptism is
[2:18:17] unacceptable
[2:18:19] because of baptism, one is reborn and
[2:18:23] made a member of the church. So they're
[2:18:26] establishing it very very firmly.
[2:18:28] Rebaptism
[2:18:30] is unacceptable.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Rebaptism, rebaptism is anathema.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; That's a curse.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Too bad he doesn't say, "You know what?
[2:18:46] I come into this charismatic thing and I
[2:18:48] was just purged of all my doctrine."
[2:18:51] No, he got anointed
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; to reestablish his doctrine
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; and to tell all of these ignorant people
[2:18:59] of the Pentecostal age that they got
[2:19:01] swallowed up. We'll tell you what what
[2:19:04] is doctrine and what is not.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Here I'm still continuing. It's anathema
[2:19:13] an anathema
[2:19:15] for a Catholic to undergo believers
[2:19:18] baptism is heretical
[2:19:21] or the very least a scandal.
[2:19:25] No one can receive the knowledge that he
[2:19:27] is saved.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:19:34] You just had one of their theologians
[2:19:37] call you a liar
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; cuz you say, "I know I'm saved."
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; I know I'm saved.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, Satan is a liar and the
[2:19:49] father of all lies.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; And he's got a lot of children and
[2:19:52] priests and whatever more and preachers
[2:19:54] that are saying the same thing.
[2:19:58] He said, "No one can have the certitude
[2:20:02] about his ultimate salvation. This is
[2:20:05] unscriptural
[2:20:06] and in contradiction with a firm and
[2:20:11] unanimous
[2:20:13] Catholic tradition and with the formal
[2:20:16] teachings of the Council of Trent." Now,
[2:20:19] that's where he went back to the formal
[2:20:21] Catholic teachings and the Council of
[2:20:23] Trent. And that's why you can't know
[2:20:25] that you're saved because those guys
[2:20:27] back there said so.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on the son hath life.
[2:20:34] And he that believeth not on the son
[2:20:36] hath not life.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For God so loved the world
[2:20:40] that he gave his only begotten son that
[2:20:43] whosoever believeth in him should not
[2:20:45] die but have eternal life.
[2:20:48] Isn't that the scripture? Beloved, now
[2:20:51] are we the sons of God,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; and it does not appear what we shall be,
[2:20:57] but when he shall appear, we shall be
[2:20:59] like him.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; This man's name was
[2:21:19] Killian McConnell, quite a first name.
[2:21:27] He concludes, "Catholic Pentecostals
[2:21:30] tend to go back and cultivate all the
[2:21:33] avenues to God that they had abandoned,
[2:21:37] they had abandoned, but the charismatic
[2:21:40] movement moves them back to embrace all
[2:21:43] of them again. and he itemizes them all
[2:21:46] that they had abandoned, the rosary,
[2:21:49] visits to the blessed sacrament,
[2:21:52] devotion to Mary, and frequent
[2:21:55] confession, daily mass and communion.
[2:21:59] And at Notre Dame, Cardinal Leo
[2:22:02] Suninins, who is appointed by this pope,
[2:22:07] the one who just passed away to bring
[2:22:10] this charismatic movement to the very
[2:22:12] heart of the church. He concludes by
[2:22:15] saying, "The secret of our unity with
[2:22:18] the Holy Spirit is our unity with Mary,
[2:22:22] the mother of God." And at these words,
[2:22:25] the entire 25,000
[2:22:28] rose to their feet for a long period of
[2:22:31] applause and praise.
[2:22:38] We ought to be ashamed that when you
[2:22:40] realize that you're loose, you can't
[2:22:42] stand with a loud applause of gratitude
[2:22:47] and praise.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; There they are saying, "This charismatic
[2:22:50] movement has brought us back.
[2:22:54] to all of these things.
[2:22:57] And God would send us undeserving
[2:23:00] humans,
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; a prophet that batted his way across the
[2:23:06] country
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; to somehow speak a message on a tape or
[2:23:11] some other means and get a book into
[2:23:13] your hands that gave you the kind of
[2:23:15] deliverance that you have today. I tell
[2:23:17] you what, young people and old alike,
[2:23:19] you ought to give him all of your life.
[2:23:20] You ought to give him everything you
[2:23:22] have.
[2:23:24] We have every reason to thank him.
[2:23:33] Glory to God.
[2:23:35] Thank God.
[2:23:38] Thank God.
[2:23:41] Hallelujah.
[2:23:42] [Music]
[2:23:48] Oh, how we thank you, Lord.
[2:23:51] How we give you praise.
[2:23:55] So grateful
[2:23:57] for not caught in that place.
[2:24:00] Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:02] Oh, bless his name. Bless his name.
[2:24:05] Bless his name.
[2:24:08] Once like a bird in prison, I dwelt. No
[2:24:12] freedom from my sorrows I felt but he
[2:24:14] set us free.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; We were held and bound also by
[2:24:18] traditions. Think about where you were.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Think about where you were.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Think about what you were into.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Think about where you were.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Think about where you would be today.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; And I just tell you friends, I haven't
[2:24:37] got time to even go on and finish. I'm a
[2:24:39] long ways from finishing. But there's a
[2:24:42] squeeze coming on. There's a squeeze
[2:24:45] that's gonna The first thing they did,
[2:24:49] they identified the troublesome group.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; These people are troubled because
[2:24:55] they're blasting out
[2:24:57] on a without any shame or restriction.
[2:25:01] And we have to silence them. And you
[2:25:04] know, in this day and age, you know,
[2:25:05] it's it's diplomacy.
[2:25:08] They'll work in the background. They'll
[2:25:10] work in the back rooms and and they'll
[2:25:13] make they'll they'll make it impossible.
[2:25:16] First they identify the group. That's
[2:25:18] what they did before the Second World
[2:25:20] War. Identified the Jews are the
[2:25:22] problem.
[2:25:24] Then they, you know, however they
[2:25:27] identify, that's up to them. They made
[2:25:29] them wear a star. Well, I'd be happy to
[2:25:32] wear a star. Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'd I'd wear the five star, six point
[2:25:38] star, or whatever it is of I'd be happy
[2:25:40] to wear that.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is one of those guys. You go
[2:25:45] in the mall, you girls. Hello.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; And if you cringe now, I tell you, you
[2:25:52] won't even be in it then. That's right.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; If you cringe now,
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; if you cringe now, if you find something
[2:26:00] now that God touches your heart, say,
[2:26:05] "Well, you know, little too straight, a
[2:26:08] little too straight. I'll just wait for
[2:26:09] another time." No. When the other time
[2:26:12] comes, you you'll you'll surrender up
[2:26:14] your beliefs.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; You'll surrender them up. and identified
[2:26:22] them and they told them, "You can't shop
[2:26:26] where we shop.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; You can't ride on the same bus as we
[2:26:31] ride.
[2:26:34] Fact is, you can't be in business
[2:26:35] anymore because we don't renew your
[2:26:37] license.
[2:26:39] You're a contractor. You got a license.
[2:26:43] You got a sound
[2:26:45] studio.
[2:26:47] You're a musician. You want to have a
[2:26:50] license.
[2:26:51] You sell automobiles.
[2:26:54] You're a machinist,
[2:26:56] financial planner. Sorry. This is a
[2:26:58] church. Not anymore.
[2:27:00] We just we take we we're going to
[2:27:02] descertify it.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; But if you'd like to come in line
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; with with all the regulations,
[2:27:12] fine. No problem. We understand.
[2:27:16] Just surrender them up.
[2:27:19] And they tightened it up. You say,
[2:27:20] "Well, could it get that tight?" That's
[2:27:22] just the beginning.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; And one benefit and another benefit and
[2:27:28] they go and they're taken away.
[2:27:33] And then the who knows after that, then
[2:27:36] persecution, whatever kind of
[2:27:38] persecution, then the media gets a hold
[2:27:40] of it. They identified you. They
[2:27:43] identify you as you brothers and sisters
[2:27:45] have been in a colony. You don't know
[2:27:46] anything about being identified like
[2:27:48] this. You could have all the black hats
[2:27:50] and all the beards you want. This will
[2:27:51] be a whole lot more. Say, "Oh, you're
[2:27:53] the believers that you you believe that
[2:27:55] false cult. You got a dead prophet. Now
[2:27:58] we really know who you are."
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have a prophet, but he's
[2:28:03] not dead."
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; None of them are dead.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; But I'm prepared
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; whatever happens. And you say, "Well, do
[2:28:14] you really think?" I really think that
[2:28:16] those things those things still lay in
[2:28:17] the message.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; And they say, "There will be a squeeze."
[2:28:20] A lot of people waiting for what kind of
[2:28:21] a squeeze, but there'll be a squeeze.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to conclude just on a
[2:28:30] high note. But I will tell you
[2:28:34] that the bride of Jesus Christ,
[2:28:38] you have to decide where you are
[2:28:41] will not be in a tribulation.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; And with sorrow in my heart,
[2:28:49] unless God does some remarkable things
[2:28:53] for some folks here in this church, you
[2:28:56] will be in it.
[2:28:58] and you'll then prove what you really
[2:29:00] believed.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; And you think that you don't have
[2:29:03] support. Now, this is I got news for
[2:29:06] you. This is this is the most support
[2:29:08] you're ever going to get
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; right here and now.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; The word is here.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; The ministry is here.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters are here. The Holy
[2:29:17] Ghost is here. All these things are
[2:29:19] here. This is the greatest you're ever
[2:29:21] going to have.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; If you can't make it now, you won't make
[2:29:24] it then. Believe me, you won't make it
[2:29:26] then.
[2:29:27] And I felt in my heart I needed to say
[2:29:29] that today.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; And I want you to be able to say within
[2:29:33] the very depths of your soul,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[2:29:38] brother Ed, and whoever will hear me, I
[2:29:41] am resolved
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; to enter the kingdom
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; and nothing shall stand in my way.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; You young fell still got education. Is
[2:29:55] education going to stand your way? Tell
[2:29:56] me, sports going to stand your way?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; No, sir not.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Is music going to stand your way?
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Some talent or gift going to stand your
[2:30:04] way? Is money going to stand your way?
[2:30:06] Businessman,
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; tell me.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Is job or support from my family is
[2:30:12] going to stand your way? Are you
[2:30:13] prepared to give it all up if I need to?
[2:30:16] But I will not deny my Christ the word
[2:30:19] of God.
[2:30:24] I had a little family.
[2:30:28] I had a job
[2:30:30] and I was preaching
[2:30:33] and didn't have anything. I had a house
[2:30:35] to live in thanks to my father-in-law.
[2:30:42] And I came home from having meetings all
[2:30:44] through the states. I came home broke
[2:30:48] and I needed work.
[2:30:51] and two men, Lutheran men,
[2:30:54] hired me.
[2:30:56] And my father
[2:30:59] spent his inheritance, which wasn't a
[2:31:01] lot of money, but it was quite a bit of
[2:31:03] money for those days. He spent his
[2:31:05] inheritance that he received from his
[2:31:07] father, my grandfather, when he passed
[2:31:08] away. He spent his entire inheritance
[2:31:11] republishing and reprinting tracks of
[2:31:14] converted nuns and priests and what
[2:31:18] they'd come into in salvation. And he
[2:31:20] spent the entire inheritance and
[2:31:22] distributed to every home by hand in a
[2:31:25] city of maybe 8 10,000 and another one
[2:31:27] where my brother-in-law, brother Brenda
[2:31:29] and Anne were living and he and he got
[2:31:31] some other helpers and they delivered to
[2:31:33] every place. I didn't I was not in
[2:31:36] support of it. I was not against it. I I
[2:31:38] I just didn't know the burden that I
[2:31:40] thought maybe there's a better way.
[2:31:44] Catholic priest of the city of Dawson
[2:31:47] Creek came to my employers,
[2:31:51] Alan Dalan and Oliver Swenson, well
[2:31:55] known to my sister and her husband,
[2:31:58] senior lovely men.
[2:32:04] And we were standing at a at the desk in
[2:32:07] the store and they said, "Ed,
[2:32:10] we were visited by the Catholic priest
[2:32:13] last night
[2:32:17] and they have told us he said there are
[2:32:21] 2,000
[2:32:23] Catholic
[2:32:25] residents in this city
[2:32:27] and that our store will not be
[2:32:31] what do you call
[2:32:34] will
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; support
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; supported. Our store will not be shopped
[2:32:40] in
[2:32:42] until you are until you have you're rid
[2:32:46] of Edisll.
[2:32:49] He said, "And we told them that it is
[2:32:51] not you. It is your father." And the
[2:32:54] priest said, "It makes no difference. we
[2:32:57] will not none no Catholic will shop in
[2:33:00] your store till he's gone.
[2:33:04] And I said, "Listen,
[2:33:07] no issue, no problem. I won't put you to
[2:33:10] that." They said, "Well, listen. What
[2:33:11] we'd like you to do, you put an ad in
[2:33:14] the paper and and you know, uh, state
[2:33:20] that you h you are not associated with
[2:33:22] this. You have nothing to do with this
[2:33:24] and we will pay for the ad.
[2:33:27] and they thought that might suffice
[2:33:28] them. I said, "No, although I perhaps
[2:33:32] don't really
[2:33:35] support the way my father's doing it, I
[2:33:38] I do support what he believes and I I
[2:33:42] cannot do that." But I said, "I do. You
[2:33:45] have no problem. I won't I won't put you
[2:33:48] in that difficult place. I will leave. I
[2:33:51] will just leave."
[2:33:53] this man, a trustee of a Lutheran
[2:33:55] church. I'm talking about about 1959.
[2:34:01] He just went like this.
[2:34:04] I can't stand those people telling me
[2:34:07] what to do. And I smiled and I said,
[2:34:11] "But they are, aren't they, Oliver?
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; They're telling you what to do." 1958
[2:34:16] when a whole lot of you folks weren't
[2:34:18] born. I know a little bit about what I'm
[2:34:21] talking about. And the prophet said
[2:34:23] this. He said, "Although they never
[2:34:26] envisioned all these Protestants never
[2:34:28] envisioned it to be this way that they
[2:34:31] that the Catholic Church will take over,
[2:34:33] will unite with Protestantism and will
[2:34:35] take over." He said they never
[2:34:37] envisioned it that way. But that's
[2:34:39] what's going to happen. Amen.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; You know, in Canada, this is largely a
[2:34:51] Catholic nation.
[2:34:53] We have a large population,
[2:34:57] and I want to say this in closing
[2:35:00] in case anyone ever hears this outside
[2:35:03] of this church.
[2:35:05] It's not the people, it's the system.
[2:35:10] Brother Brandham says, and you remember
[2:35:12] Sister Bobby was the words I said to our
[2:35:15] sister Bobby Graham just outside. It's
[2:35:17] not the people, it's the system that
[2:35:20] corrupts them.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Said they go in there to be good people.
[2:35:24] They go in to be good nuns and go in to
[2:35:26] be good priests, but the system corrupts
[2:35:29] them. I had another message. We have
[2:35:32] another system.
[2:35:34] We have another system and it doesn't
[2:35:36] corrupt but it redoss.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It gives life.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing because it been on
[2:35:46] my heart all day. Search me, oh God, and
[2:35:49] know my thoughts today. And then we're
[2:35:51] going to close. Thank you for your
[2:35:53] patience.
[2:35:56] And our brother Anoir will be
[2:35:58] ministering tonight. We give him full
[2:36:02] support and time. Have a rest. Get
[2:36:03] refreshed and come back. All right.
[2:36:07] Search
[2:36:09] me,
[2:36:10] oh God,
[2:36:14] and know my heart
[2:36:19] today.
[2:36:23] Christ
[2:36:25] me,
[2:36:27] oh Savior,
[2:36:31] all my
[2:36:35] pray
[2:36:39] see
[2:36:43] there be
[2:36:47] some wicked
[2:36:49] way
[2:36:51] in
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:37:01] Every sing.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; I would like to sing just a third verse,
[2:37:11] please. Lord, take my life. Lord,
[2:37:15] take my life.
[2:37:20] Grant it Lord and make me holy
[2:37:26] thine.
[2:37:28] [Music]
[2:37:30] Fill
[2:37:32] my pure heart
[2:37:36] with
[2:37:38] thy great love
[2:37:41] divine.
[2:37:46] Take
[2:37:48] all my will,
[2:37:54] my passion,
[2:37:56] self
[2:37:58] and pride.
[2:38:00] [Applause]
[2:38:03] I
[2:38:05] now
[2:38:06] surrender
[2:38:09] Lord
[2:38:10] in me.
[2:38:13] [Music]
[2:38:18] Let us just reverently pray. I'm going
[2:38:20] to ask brother Dier if you would come.
[2:38:23] Please, brother Dier.
[2:38:26] And I would ask you
[2:38:29] today, you know where you are. You know
[2:38:31] where you stand.
[2:38:33] We don't want some emotional thing, but
[2:38:36] I would sincerely desire if God spoke to
[2:38:39] you on in a specific way that you just
[2:38:43] surrender your entire will to him and
[2:38:47] let there be a concrete change.
[2:38:50] Let it be between you and God.
[2:38:52] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother Dier,
[2:38:57] [Music]
[2:39:01] our gracious father,
[2:39:05] we're truly thankful this morning, oh
[2:39:07] God,
[2:39:10] to know the things that we know and
[2:39:13] to have hearts to believe, Father,
[2:39:18] when we consider the multitude, Father,
[2:39:20] that are walking in darkness and in
[2:39:23] spiritual for prisons. Oh God,
[2:39:26] truly our hearts rejoice this morning to
[2:39:29] know what we have heard this
[2:39:32] day, Father, and for the inspiration of
[2:39:34] the Holy Spirit
[2:39:36] to cause us to know the hour that we're
[2:39:38] living in, the seriousness, Father, of
[2:39:40] these things.
[2:39:43] Learn the solemnity of this presence
[2:39:45] that is here,
[2:39:47] of the word that has gone forth and
[2:39:49] hearts that are waited in the balance
[2:39:51] and found wanting.
[2:39:53] Lord, I pray, oh God, that you'll not
[2:39:55] let anyone escape the pool of the
[2:39:57] spirit. And would you minister an
[2:40:00] entrance, oh God, to those that are
[2:40:02] needy this morning? For the word has not
[2:40:05] been sent in vain, but truly to give us
[2:40:07] warning.
[2:40:09] How much time of warning we're entitled
[2:40:11] to, we just don't know. Father, but how
[2:40:13] we desire to maximize the opportunity to
[2:40:16] capitalize upon it today and not let
[2:40:19] these things escape our grip, but get a
[2:40:21] hold of them, Father, and believe, oh
[2:40:23] God, unto the salvation of souls for
[2:40:26] those that are in need this morning,
[2:40:28] Father. We feel the burden of the word
[2:40:30] of the Lord. And we ask, oh God, that
[2:40:33] you'll just move in an unusual way. That
[2:40:36] you'll confirm your presence, Father.
[2:40:38] that you confirm your word with signs
[2:40:40] following dear God. That those that need
[2:40:43] to escape from the grip of the enemy
[2:40:45] will find a deliverance today in the
[2:40:47] house of God. For the word has been
[2:40:49] proclaimed a trumpet of deliverance and
[2:40:52] jubilee, oh God, to set us free from any
[2:40:54] influence that'll bond us, oh God, and
[2:40:57] keep us from this free salvation that
[2:41:00] you made available to us this morning.
[2:41:02] Lord, we pray that those that have need
[2:41:05] will go receiving today and your servant
[2:41:09] who has been obedient to the voice of
[2:41:10] God. Would you renew him and strengthen
[2:41:12] him, Father? Would you just continue to
[2:41:15] unveil your word to him that he may feed
[2:41:17] the flock of God, you know how much we
[2:41:19] need to hear those things in this hour.
[2:41:22] Lord, we thank you for your grace today.
[2:41:25] We ask that you'll dismiss us with your
[2:41:27] presence and bring us back again for
[2:41:29] more of your work. In Jesus name we
[2:41:32] pray. Amen.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. Greet
[2:41:39] one another. We'll see you at 5:00. Come
[2:41:41] early. Good seat. God bless you. Bless
[2:41:44] you, brother.
