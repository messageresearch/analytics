[0:00] we were married 21 years ago by the
[0:02] justice of the peace was was it
[0:06] wrong
[0:08] yes it was wrong for you to do that
[0:11] marriage belongs in the house of God but
[0:13] being that you are married here's when
[0:15] you're really married you're married
[0:17] when you vow one to the other when you
[0:20] promise one another that you're that
[0:22] you'll take one another the justice of
[0:24] peace could give you license that's
[0:27] legal terms of living together is
[0:30] husband and wife without being common
[0:31] law husband and wife but when you
[0:33] promise this girl and this you promise
[0:36] that man that you'll live true to him
[0:38] and you take him to be your husband
[0:39] you're married Dan remember I explained
[0:42] that last week I believe it was see when
[0:44] you promis her see even in the in the
[0:47] old Bible if a man was betra to a maid
[0:51] and you know the laws on that it was
[0:53] just the same as an adultery certainly
[0:56] was and he promised that was it the
[0:57] question is asked to he was a um a
[1:00] norment a
[1:02] norment a norment the same as a
[1:07] divorce see when you ask me those
[1:09] questions friends you don't know what
[1:10] that does to me I've got many friends
[1:13] sitting here married two or three times
[1:15] did you realize I'm talking to my own
[1:18] son Billy Paul but I spare Billy Paul no
[1:22] indeed Billy Paul got married to some
[1:25] little girl he came up and said Daddy
[1:26] I'm going to get married I was was my
[1:28] said butt your head against the wall
[1:29] just kept kept on wash my car like that
[1:31] he said I'm going to get married I said
[1:32] oh go just kept on like that he goes
[1:35] around tell his mother and his mother
[1:36] laughed at him you know what he done run
[1:38] off with some little kid still in common
[1:40] school and got married we analed the
[1:43] wedding the father of the girl and
[1:44] myself we an know the wedding but he was
[1:47] married just the same he's my boy
[1:49] sitting here listen at me now that's
[1:51] exactly he come to me with the girl he
[1:53] lives with now my daughter-in-law my
[1:55] little grandson he said Daddy will you
[1:57] marry me I said by no means that's my
[1:59] own son son you think that don't cut me
[2:01] to the core and I packed him in my arms
[2:04] and done everything I could do and I've
[2:05] been both father and mother to him you
[2:07] think that don't kill me to say that but
[2:08] it's a
[2:10] truth certainly my boy sitting here
[2:13] listening at my daughter-in-law and my
[2:14] little grandson sitting right here now
[2:17] but I tell him it's
[2:19] wrong because I've got to I'm Duty bound
[2:22] to that
[2:24] word and I say you got married by a
[2:27] magistrate you should have been married
[2:28] by the church by the minister
[2:30] that's a decent thing to do for a
[2:32] Christian but being that you have
[2:34] already made that promise and vow and
[2:36] been married 21 years ago I think it's
[2:38] all right you say well I you question
[2:40] might be should I come and be married
[2:42] again if you wish to don't have nothing
[2:45] in your mind that bothers your faith
[2:46] because if anything's there you can't go
[2:47] no further than right there you stop
[2:50] right there when that question mark
[2:51] comes that's where you end right there
[2:55] but I for me it would be all right the
[2:57] man that baptized me in the name of the
[2:59] Lord Jesus Christ Christ finally run me
[3:01] out of church because I wouldn't agree
[3:02] with him on women preachers that didn't
[3:04] make me be re-baptized again
[3:08] see sure or not that's all right but
[3:12] just remember these things are cutting
[3:14] to me I got bosom friends sitting here
[3:17] men and women would take their lather
[3:20] pull a eye out and give it to me if I'd
[3:22] ask them for it yes sir and they're
[3:23] married twice sometimes three times
[3:26] sitting right here now and my own boy my
[3:29] own grandson my grand and my
[3:31] daughter-in-law I love look at Billy how
[3:34] I stood by him and how he stood by me
[3:36] but to say truth or truth is truth
[3:39] truth sister dear brother dear one time
[3:43] a Salesman tell me he walked into a
[3:45] church is Christian up in Connecticut or
[3:47] somewhere up there is wasn't he was a
[3:49] Pentecostal but he went in there to pray
[3:51] and said when he got in there to knelt
[3:53] down the church to pray says Ride Along
[3:54] he's tired kind of homesick salesman
[3:57] and's selling stuff and said he
[4:00] from to factories and he went in there
[4:01] to to make some buys or something and he
[4:03] come to the church and thought i' go we
[4:05] ever go and pray the doors open said he
[4:06] went in didn't hear nobody so I knelt
[4:09] down started praying actually he's
[4:10] praying there say about an hour that
[4:12] directly he heard some door slam or
[4:14] something he thought was custodian or
[4:15] something in church said after while he
[4:17] noticed here come he heard somebody
[4:19] talking he stepped up there look look
[4:21] around see what was custodian it was a
[4:23] man and woman standing before the altar
[4:24] holding one another's hands said I take
[4:27] you dear to be my lawful wted wife wife
[4:30] see she said I take you dear to be my
[4:32] lawful wetted husband well he said this
[4:34] is a strange thing said this Pentecostal
[4:36] he said this man in woman getting
[4:38] married without a
[4:39] preacher and so he just sat down and
[4:41] waited and after they made their vows
[4:43] and live true to one another only the
[4:44] death would separate him they put her
[4:45] arms around one another kissed each
[4:46] other turn around walked out smiling he
[4:49] said just a moment he said um I'm kind
[4:52] of curious I'm a stranger said you all
[4:54] get married said
[4:55] yes without a preacher he said no said
[4:58] we've been married 40 years years he
[5:01] said we got married right here this
[5:02] altar 40 years ago and every year we
[5:04] come back and renew our vows that's a
[5:07] good
[5:08] idea see but as far as Mary when you
[5:12] promise her she takes your word you take
[5:15] her word and God takes both your word
[5:18] see but in the days of the voice of the
[5:20] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[5:22] sound the mystery of God should be
[5:24] finished as he hath declared to his
[5:26] servants the prophets
