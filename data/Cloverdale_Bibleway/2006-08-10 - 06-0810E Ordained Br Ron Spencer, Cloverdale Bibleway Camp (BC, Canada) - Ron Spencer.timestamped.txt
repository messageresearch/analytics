[22:31] And now, Father, we've come to this
[22:33] time.
[22:34] And Lord, one time you said, "The hour
[22:37] has come and now is glorify thy son."

[23:18] consecrated it, we've dedicated to you,

[23:23] people, Lord, that you will move

[30:58] Leave me alone.
[31:02] I will
[31:33] Jason's already given you a warm
[31:36] welcome. You know you're welcome.
[31:39] We had a glorious time
[31:42] first part of this week.
[31:45] Junior camp last night. Having our
[31:49] brother Ryan Jones, his wife, Sister
[31:53] Channy, with us been a special treat.
[31:55] And I know that everyone that was here
[31:59] really
[32:01] did immensely enjoy it. We appreciate
[32:04] that. We want to be thankful that we can
[32:06] gather like we are this evening.
[32:11] We were really shocked and saddened a
[32:14] few days ago to hear that our brother
[32:17] Roy Shrew's church burned to the ground.
[32:22] And some of you may have heard that by
[32:24] now, but uh a brother from the church
[32:29] had been to the building just before
[32:32] about 30 minutes before the fire
[32:36] uh has started and turned on the air
[32:40] conditioning for the meeting that was
[32:42] going to take place, a prayer meeting
[32:44] that night. And about 30 minutes later,
[32:49] uh a lady came to his said the church is
[32:52] on fire and uh it burned very suddenly.
[32:58] They found some doors that were open. So
[33:00] they do not know what took place. They
[33:03] don't know exactly what the cause is.
[33:06] The only reason I'm giving these details
[33:08] is so that there isn't all kinds of
[33:10] stories going around that are not
[33:13] accurate.
[33:14] And uh
[33:16] the uh church, brother Shrewsbury has
[33:19] said burned right to the ground. They
[33:22] had another building uh next to it which
[33:25] was like a fellowship hall and that has
[33:28] been preserved. So uh they're having
[33:31] meeting there I believe tomorrow night
[33:34] and they were just getting ready for
[33:36] three week meeting with a brother that
[33:39] was coming up to preach for them and uh
[33:42] I believe they to continue and use the
[33:45] other building. They are setting it all
[33:48] up. So, I can say and ask this
[33:51] congregation that you would join us in
[33:54] your individual prayer time. This is not
[33:57] something you just pray over in a
[34:00] request time and then forget it. It's
[34:02] something I'd like you to have on your
[34:04] heart. Uh, Brother Shrewsbury is not a
[34:07] young man. His wife is not a young
[34:09] woman. and they have had this church
[34:12] established there for very many years. A
[34:15] nice congregation and for them I was in
[34:18] brother as soon as I got the news and
[34:21] the phone call came here. Brother Tom
[34:24] even while the church was on fire and
[34:27] they gathered some of the all the people
[34:29] that they could just around here on the
[34:31] campgrounds and began to pray for them
[34:34] pray over the situation.
[34:37] I was just a short time ago, probably
[34:40] five weeks ago, I was sitting in that
[34:43] office in that church and I looked
[34:46] around. Uh I just would be observing
[34:50] some of the uh not pictures but the
[34:54] poems and different things, gifts that
[34:57] had been given to brother Shrewsbury for
[34:58] his many many years of service to the
[35:01] Lord. And for me to realize that they
[35:04] were all in ashes now, it just brought a
[35:07] heaviness to my own heart. And those are
[35:10] things which are lost and can never be
[35:12] regained. So we are asking that you
[35:15] remember him in prayer. Will you do
[35:17] that? I'm sure this congregation will
[35:19] remember our faithful brother in prayer.
[35:22] And uh I've delivered a message that is
[35:24] going to him uh tomorrow
[35:28] that our church here will be praying for
[35:30] them.
[35:32] We're going to take up an offering
[35:34] tonight uh tonight, tomorrow night, and
[35:37] Saturday night because you may not have
[35:38] come prepared, but we're taking up
[35:40] offerings for the expenses of the of the
[35:44] camp uh while the those that are here as
[35:48] campers and they are they're paying
[35:51] their fee for their overnight stay and
[35:54] for the meals and so on. There are many
[35:56] many expenses that are not included in
[36:00] that and uh we need to take care of
[36:03] those. So if you will open your heart
[36:06] and just give according to as God has uh
[36:10] provided
[36:12] supplied you then we'll uh it will be
[36:16] sufficient and we are serve that. Uh
[36:19] also on Sunday uh because we're going to
[36:21] be having our Sunday service here at 10
[36:24] a.m. we'll be the offering then for your
[36:27] tithes. At that time,
[36:30] I would like to just make mention while
[36:32] the deacons get ready to take the
[36:34] offering that if you deacons would
[36:37] please be just
[36:39] uh sensitive to the uh once the sun goes
[36:43] down and it gets sometimes it gets cool
[36:45] quite quickly and if there's a cool air
[36:48] cool draft moving in from the back we'd
[36:51] like to just I know you're very faithful
[36:53] to drop the uh aprons down, but we'd
[36:57] like to make sure that the people that
[36:59] are sitting at the back are not
[37:00] uncomfortable. So, we would just ask the
[37:04] deacons to be conscious of that. I
[37:06] wonder if the deacons would come
[37:08] forward, please. And those that are
[37:11] assisting to take the offering, like to
[37:13] ask blessing upon the offering and we
[37:16] want to also
[37:18] be remembering our brother Shrewsbury at
[37:20] this time in prayer. How many who have
[37:23] been here at the camp? How many How many
[37:25] were here last night? Let me see your
[37:26] hands raised. Oh, all right. How many
[37:30] were not here last night?
[37:33] All right. Uh, you want to be sure and
[37:36] get the DVD? That was special for you,
[37:39] Brother Gary.
[37:41] I told our brother Brian, we got a lot
[37:42] of wilderness people in this church and
[37:45] he'd be right at home. I think he felt
[37:47] right at home, too. How many enjoyed it
[37:49] last night?
[37:57] And now we're commencing towards the
[38:00] supernatural.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Supernatural. We want to see the
[38:06] almighty hand of God. I don't know about
[38:09] you individually, but I for one person
[38:13] am saying I want to see in in certain
[38:16] areas that I am interested in and I am
[38:20] personally praying about I want to see
[38:23] the supernatural. I've already prayed
[38:25] here on the platform for two
[38:27] supernatural things to happen. And I
[38:30] believe if we you know what the
[38:31] scripture says, ask.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And then what's the next part?
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Let me hear it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And you shall
[38:41] &gt;&gt; receive. Isn't that good news?
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're asking for the supernatural
[38:49] tonight.
[38:52] Gary, would you ask
[39:23] We do.
[39:32] Yes.
[39:58] Amen.

[43:20] your order in.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, where are you? We're going
[43:25] to invite you to speak to us this
[43:28] evening. I don't know about you, but I
[43:30] know I know the church uh that I'm
[43:33] associated with or the people that I've
[43:35] been around with for 30 going on 31
[43:38] years. I know that they're great eaters.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; It's true. Look at us.
[43:48] You know, you see different photos of us
[43:50] when we were 21 and 25 and now we're 40
[43:53] and now we're 50. We're going on and
[43:55] there's just more territory.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; I know that if we were that in the
[44:01] natural, I know we're there in that in
[44:03] the spiritual. Amen.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you, but I've
[44:06] I've been under so, you know, since the
[44:08] end of camp and brother Ron had had
[44:11] graciously accepted the invitation when
[44:13] brother Visll said, "Brother Ron, next
[44:15] year would you be our speaker?" From
[44:17] that moment on,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to this night.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; From that moment on,
[44:23] &gt;&gt; and now I'm I'm saying that time has
[44:26] come and now is.

[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the man of God has
[44:35] done his part. He's waited on God. Now,
[44:38] let's do our part.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; That is the pull on the word of God.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we desire that the Holy Spirit
[44:44] would come and whatever your need is
[44:48] that he would come and meet you

[44:54] God. Welcome. Welcome, Holy Spirit. We
[44:57] welcome thee tonight. Let's sing that as

[46:47] &gt;&gt; It is certainly good to be in the house
[46:49] of the Lord this afternoon.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I trust that you're under expectation
[46:54] for the Lord to do something incredible
[46:56] in this meeting. Yes,
[46:58] &gt;&gt; I know that we're living in incredible
[47:00] times
[47:02] &gt;&gt; and you were ordained
[47:04] &gt;&gt; to be at this time.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; I certainly did appreciate brother Brian
[47:16] &gt;&gt; I told my wife last night, how in the
[47:19] world am I going to follow that?
[47:25] I certainly believe that we're living in
[47:27] the time God has allowed us to see a man
[47:29] that can communicate with nature
[47:33] &gt;&gt; as the world is growing. And so we're
[47:36] certainly glad that we can be here.
[47:40] Let us speak.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you all.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're under expectation that you
[47:52] would come.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; For if you don't come, it will be just
[47:59] and people that have gathered together.
[48:03] But even as we study this afternoon, we
[48:05] can feel the supernatural power of God.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you would come and I
[48:12] know you have been invited.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; We have sung the songs of Zion to
[48:17] Pararts
[48:18] and we ask you that just now that you
[48:20] would just come and captivate this
[48:22] entire congregation.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; You know our every need.
[48:27] You know every situation tonight.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you would anoint lips
[48:32] of clay.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And may you drive back every demon and
[48:35] principality and foul
[48:38] &gt;&gt; that would try to hold us captive
[48:40] &gt;&gt; and set us free to ask him.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; For we know that we are built for this
[48:46] hour.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; We were predestinated for this planet
[48:49] &gt;&gt; and we have been chosen by you before
[48:51] the foundation of the world. And we ask
[48:54] you that you would anoint us for
[48:56] service. We pray.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And anoint this congregation as we put
[49:01] our fire together. Father,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; oh God, help us tonight. We pray.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; And may we sit in heavenly places in
[49:09] this first evening in the name of Jesus
[49:12] Christ we ask.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:16] If you will turn with me to Genesis 37
[49:20] this afternoon,
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Genesis 37.
[49:50] And Jacob dwell in the land wherein his
[49:52] father was a stranger in the land of
[49:55] Canaan.
[49:57] These are the generations of Jacob.
[49:59] Joseph being 17 years old was feeding
[50:02] the flock with his brethren. And the lad
[50:05] was with the sons of and with the sons
[50:08] of Zela. And the father's wives and
[50:12] Joseph brought under the father their
[50:14] report. Now, Israel loved Joseph more
[50:19] than all of his children because he was
[50:22] a son of his old age, and he made him a
[50:25] coat of many colors. And when his
[50:28] brethren saw that their father loved him
[50:30] more than all his brethren, they hated
[50:33] him and could not speak peacefully unto
[50:36] him. Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told
[50:40] it his brethren, and they hated him.
[50:44] the more. And he said unto them, "Here I
[50:47] pray you this dream which I have
[50:50] dreamed. And behold, we were binding
[50:52] sheav in the field, and lo, my sheep
[50:55] arose, and also upright, and behold,
[50:58] your sheav stood round about and made
[51:01] obesence to my sheep." And his brethren
[51:04] said unto him, "Shalt thou indeed reign
[51:07] over us, or shalt thou indeed have
[51:09] dominion over us?" And they hated him
[51:12] yet the more for his dreams and his
[51:16] words.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I believe this is the first evening for
[51:29] the senior.
[51:32] I believe sitting before me tonight is
[51:34] the pre-planned purpose of God.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:39] And I believe that when God was like a
[51:42] contractor unfolding the earth and he
[51:45] was laying out your seeds and you were
[51:48] in his mind, Brother Brandham said like
[51:50] laying out two befores of a of a housing
[51:53] project. He knew exactly who would be in
[51:56] what day and at what time. And he knew
[51:58] even your genetic makeup and your
[52:00] genetic code. He knew the weaknesses
[52:02] that he was going to allow you to have.
[52:05] He knew the situations that you were
[52:07] going to come in. He knew the valleys
[52:09] that you were going to have and the
[52:11] mountains that you were going to climb.
[52:14] And God orained you to live in this day.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Joseph was a young man that was just
[52:22] like you.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; He was born in a message home. He was
[52:28] born as a son of prosperity.
[52:32] He literally did not have no choice of
[52:34] what God called him to be.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You see, God placed even before his
[52:40] birth a special blessing upon his life.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you sitting under
[52:46] the sound of our voices this evening,
[52:48] God gave you an opportunity to hear the
[52:51] gospel of eternal life
[52:53] &gt;&gt; and the greatest message that you that
[52:56] the world has ever heard. Amen. Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; A word that will change your body.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And transform you in the moment, in the
[53:04] twinkling of an eye,
[53:08] &gt;&gt; maybe Joseph, as he be to grow a little
[53:11] older and as he be to notice how his
[53:14] father took special favor and special
[53:17] care of him, maybe he be to notice his
[53:20] brethren of of their little hatred and
[53:23] their jealousy and their envy. and and
[53:26] he began to notice as how they conducted
[53:28] themselves around him. And but you know
[53:31] this gift be to develop in his life and
[53:33] it be to be pulled out of him because
[53:36] GOD HAD PLACED INSIDE of him the
[53:39] potential.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; This was not going to be just another
[53:42] son but this is going to be a man that
[53:46] is going to transform history. He is
[53:49] going to be ordained of God to be the
[53:52] fulfillment of the word of the hour. And
[53:54] literally, as he has talked to Abraham
[53:57] through Melazdc, how that the children
[53:59] of Israel would sojourn in a strange
[54:01] land, there has to be a man ordained of
[54:04] God to turn THE CORNER
[54:06] &gt;&gt; AND CAUSE them to go to Egypt.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And God has to have someone that is
[54:13] there in power and position. Now, a lot
[54:17] of times we don't understand maybe the
[54:19] pre-planning of God or even why that
[54:21] we're going through the processes that
[54:23] we're going through. But God has to
[54:26] develop us.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; He has to He has to be perfect IN HIS
[54:31] TIMING. A LOT OF TIMES WE don't
[54:33] understand even the purpose of what
[54:35] we're even doing here THIS AFTERNOON.
[54:37] BUT GOD IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT process
[54:40] and he has the purpose of you and his
[54:43] mind before the foundation of the world.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Random makes a couple
[54:49] of statements and I'll go there. He
[54:51] says, HE SAID THE LAST PROPHET THAT THEY
[54:54] HAD AND DR. MOSES, HE SAID THE last
[54:56] prophet they had was Joseph. And Joseph
[54:58] was a man born in the world by God to do
[55:01] a certain things and to fulfill the word
[55:04] of God. Gifts and callings are without
[55:07] repentance. So, you s JUST SIMPLY CAN'T
[55:11] PUSH something into somebody that isn't
[55:14] there to push. A man can't do nothing.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Joseph meeting his brethren, he said,
[55:22] NOTICE DOWN THROUGH THE ages when Jesus
[55:25] comes, never did he consult with any
[55:27] theologians, BUT HE CALLED A BUNCH OF
[55:29] VIPERS AND CALLED THEM A BUNCH OF VIPERS
[55:32] and snakes in the grass. Never did the
[55:35] the DISCIPLES EVER COPE WITH ANY OF THE
[55:37] DENOMINATIONS. They were on THE SIDE.
[55:39] THEY WERE ON THE SIDE. AND HE SAYS,
[55:41] NEVER DID JOSEPH EVER COPE with them. HE
[55:44] WAS HATED AND REJECTED FOR THE SAME
[55:47] PURPOSE THAT THE REST OF THEM WAS
[55:49] BECAUSE GOD WAS IN HIM IN A supernatural
[55:52] way and in a different way that he was
[55:55] in the rest of them and they hated him
[55:58] without a cause.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RHONDA, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT FROM
[56:02] THE WORLD. WE WERE ORDAINED TO BE
[56:04] DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; WE ARE A SEPARATED PEOPLE.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD CALLED YOU A SUPER RACE. MAN
[56:11] DIDN'T CALL YOU THAT.
[56:14] THAT'S RIGHT.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU A SUPER CHURCH.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; MAN DIDN'T CALL YOU THAT. GOD CALLED YOU
[56:20] THAT.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGED ABRAHAM'S NAME. Abraham
[56:24] didn't change him.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; You can DO ALL THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO
[56:29] CHANGE YOURSELF and turn over NEW
[56:30] LEAVES. YOU CAN MAKE PROMISES. YOU CAN
[56:33] IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND I'M GOING TO BE A
[56:35] BETTER PERSON. YOU CAN JOIN EVERY SOCIAL
[56:37] CLUB IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN JOIN CHURCH
[56:40] AFTER CHURCH. BUT IF GOD
[56:43] YOUR LIFE, YOU'LL NEVER be the same.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Joseph, when he was born, he
[56:55] was loved of his father, hated of his
[56:57] brethren, a perfect type of Christ. He
[57:00] was a blood brother TO THEM, THE SAME
[57:02] FATHER. But the reason they hated him
[57:04] without a cause is because God made him
[57:08] a prophet,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; a spiritual a seer and they hated him
[57:14] for that very purpose. BUT JOSEPH COULD
[57:17] NOT HELP IT BECAUSE GOD MADE HIM that
[57:21] way.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WATCH THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN
[57:25] JOSEPH. WATCH WHAT HE DID. HE HE even
[57:28] acted THE PART OF CHRIST. HE was hated
[57:30] of his brethren, loved of his father
[57:33] BECAUSE OF THE SPIRIT MADE HIM THE
[57:35] DIFFERENCE." He said he was a spiritual
[57:37] man. He saw visions. HE INTERPRETED
[57:39] DREAMS. HE DID NOT DO IT. FOR HIS OWN
[57:42] GLORY. HE DIDN'T. HE DID IT BECAUSE
[57:44] THERE WAS SOMETHING in him. Let me JUST
[57:47] SAY THIS TO YOU. GOD PUT THAT DEEP DOWN
[57:49] INSIDE OF YOU.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't put it there.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; YOU DID NOT. YOU HAD YOU LITERALLY YOU
[57:58] LITERALLY THERE'S PEOPLE THAT LIVE
[57:59] BESIDE OF YOU, THE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU
[58:02] MAY GO TO SCHOOL WITH, PEOPLE THAT YOU
[58:04] WORK WITH, AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT LITERALLY
[58:11] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WAS CALLING TO
[58:13] YOU
[58:13] &gt;&gt; AND THEY MAY LITERALLY HATE YOU. THEY
[58:16] MAY LITERALLY TURN AGAINST YOU WITH
[58:18] EVERYTHING THAT IS WITHIN THEM AND THEY
[58:20] DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY DO IT.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SCHOOL THAT CAN PRODUCE
[58:31] CHILDREN LIKE YOU.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[58:34] BUT THERE YOU'RE HATED WITHOUT EVEN A
[58:37] CAUSE
[58:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A PILLAR OF FIRE FOLLOWS YOU AND
[58:41] LIVES INSIDE OF YOU AND he quickens you
[58:44] to life and Satan HATES IT WITH
[58:47] EVERYTHING THAT is within him.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Brandon was quoting a scripture. He
[58:58] said, you know, the footsteps of the
[58:59] righteous are ordered to the Lord.
[59:02] He said that gives us ministers a chance
[59:04] sometimes to kind of catch our breath
[59:06] when we think we've made a wrong move.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES GOD'S JUST MOVING WITH us
[59:14] and we think that we're wrong, but maybe
[59:17] it's God's moving.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says this. He said,
[59:21] "Your birth year was pre-planned." HE
[59:24] SAID, "I GUESS YOU BELIEVE THAT.
[59:26] Everyone you knows that our birth was
[59:28] pre-planned. Did you know that your
[59:30] being here never originated in just a
[59:33] myth OR A THOUGHT. EVERYTHING WAS
[59:34] PRE-PLANNED BY GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[59:37] OF THE world
[59:38] &gt;&gt; that you're here.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; THE INFINITE GOD KNOWED. AND TO BE
[59:42] INFINITE, HE HAD TO KNOW EVERY FLEA that
[59:44] would ever be upon the earth and how
[59:46] MANY TIMES IT WOULD BAT ITS EYE. HE SAID
[59:48] THAT'S INFINITE. YOU'RE HE SAYS he said
[59:51] YOU'RE OUR LITTLE MINDS CANNOT FATHOM
[59:53] WHAT INFINITE MEANS. THE INFINITE GOD,
[59:56] HE KNOWETH ALL THINGS. THEREFORE,
[59:57] THERE'S NOTHING OUT OF CATER. AND HE
[1:00:00] SAYS, "IF WE KNOW THE WORD OF GOD, WE
[1:00:02] KNOW WHERE WE ARE LIVING. WE KNOW THE
[1:00:04] HOUR THAT we're living in. We know what
[1:00:06] lays ahead.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORLD IS LITERALLY IN CHAOS
[1:00:11] RIGHT NOW. BUT WE KNOW WHAT LAYS AHEAD."
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ron, I'VE HEARD THAT
[1:00:19] QUOTE A LOT OF TIMES. I WANT YOU TO
[1:00:21] UNDERSTAND. I WANT YOU TO PLACE THAT IN
[1:00:23] THE WOMB OF YOUR SOUL. BECAUSE EVERY
[1:00:26] TIME THE enemy comes to you and HE SAYS
[1:00:28] YOU'RE A BACKSLIDER, YOU'RE NOT A
[1:00:30] CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE LOOKING RIGHT SQUARE
[1:00:32] IN THE eyes and say, "I WANT TO REMIND
[1:00:34] YOU GOD FOLLOWED ME BEFORE THE
[1:00:37] FOUNDATION.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; He pre-planned me. HE NEVER LOOKED AT MY
[1:00:43] FAILURES. HE NEVER LOOKED AT MY
[1:00:45] MISTAKES. He never looked at the
[1:00:48] situation that I had. He knew what I was
[1:00:51] about to do."
[1:00:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH FOUND HIMSELF. SO,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; and I'm I TRULY I'M TRULY CAN BELIEVE
[1:01:04] TONIGHT HE WAS A HUMAN BEING AS WELL. HE
[1:01:06] WAS HURT.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY NEIGHBORS
[1:01:10] AND BY FRIENDS AND EVEN PEOPLE THAT SIT
[1:01:12] ON THE PEW AND YOU GET HURT.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; YOU GET WOUNDED.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; BUT YET, HE WAS NOT FOCUSING ON THE
[1:01:19] THINGS THAT WERE AROUND HIM. HIS ANCHOR
[1:01:22] WAS IN GOD.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; HIS ANCHOR WAS IN THE SUPERNATURAL POWER
[1:01:27] OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; He went
[1:01:34] found himself in qualifier's house.
[1:01:39] I want you to know I want you to know
[1:01:42] this. No matter where he was at, God was
[1:01:44] with him.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to just notice he was
[1:01:50] blessed. no matter where he was at.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You have a covenant with God.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; That everything that you put your hands
[1:01:58] on is blessed.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And we operate within his covenant.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want YOU TO JUST NOTICE HERE'S
[1:02:09] SOMETIMES WHERE THE ENEMY COMES IN. He
[1:02:12] comes in and he BEGINS TO SAY, "WELL,
[1:02:14] I'LL GET HIM TO WORK."
[1:02:16] And as he begins to work, IF HE'S NOT
[1:02:19] CAREFUL, HE BEGINS TO LOSE HIS FOCUS
[1:02:22] BECAUSE REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS
[1:02:24] TOUCHED IS BLESSED.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; And you may START OUT ON THE BOTTOM OF
[1:02:28] THE LADDER.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE COVENANT OF GOD THAT
[1:02:32] IS WITH YOU,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; YOU IMMEDIATELY START TO CLIMB AND YOU
[1:02:35] DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.
[1:02:37] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; YOU IMMEDIATELY START TO FLOW UP INSIDE
[1:02:41] OF A COMPANY AND YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND
[1:02:43] AND GOING, I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT I'M
[1:02:45] MOVING UP. I'M MOVING PAST OTHER PEOPLE
[1:02:48] THAT ARE MORE QUALIFIED THAN MYSELF.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; They're older than myself and they're
[1:02:53] MORE THEY'RE MORE STUDIOUS AND THEY'RE
[1:02:55] THIS AND THEY'RE THAT. THEY'VE GOT
[1:02:56] HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS. BUT SATAN CAN SEE
[1:03:00] THE LIGHT AND HE CAN SEE HE CAN SEE THE
[1:03:03] PLAN OF GOD THAT IS INSIDE OF YOU. AND
[1:03:05] SO HE BEGINS TO USE THAT
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER. AN
[1:03:15] OFFER THAT LITERALLY IN YOUR FLESH IT'S
[1:03:17] GOING TO BE HARD FOR YOU TO REFUSE.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; HE MADE JESUS AN OFFER.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; If you'll remember, HE OFFERED JESUS
[1:03:29] KINGDOMS WITHOUT A CROSS.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; HE'LL OFFER YOU A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.
[1:03:35] without a new
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; birth.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THE MESSAGE, HE'LL OFFER YOU AN
[1:03:45] INTELLECTUAL experience
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; where you CAN QUOTE EVERY QUOTE AND DOT
[1:03:50] EVERY EYE AND CROSS EVERY CAVE. BUT I
[1:03:53] WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU WANT TO GET TO THAT
[1:03:54] NEW BIRTH.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; WHEREVER IT IS, whatever it takes, you
[1:03:59] cannot have a new birth.
[1:04:03] BROTHER, WHY DO I NEED IT? THE SCRIPTURE
[1:04:05] SAID THAT YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; BEING BORN IN A FAMILY DOESN'T MAKE YOU
[1:04:11] SAVE.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I BELIEVE ALL THE MESSAGE. So
[1:04:18] does the devil.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL WAS BAPTIZED WHEN JUDAS WAS
[1:04:22] BAPTIZED. THAT'S what brother Brandham
[1:04:24] said.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But he CAN'T GET THE HOLY Ghost
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; or he'd be our brother and not our
[1:04:30] enemy.
[1:04:31] BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, HE WILL
[1:04:33] COME AND SIT IN PEACE RIGHT BESIDE YOU.
[1:04:35] AND I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR JUST
[1:04:36] NOW, BUT HE'LL HE'LL TELL YOU. HE WILL
[1:04:39] TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT.
[1:04:41] YOU'RE IN A STATE OF SATISFACTION. YOU
[1:04:44] DON'T NEED TO PRESS.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO PUSH. YOU DON'T NEED
[1:04:48] TO PULL.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT IT MADE. YOU'RE SITTING IN A
[1:04:53] QUEUE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW JOSEPH, THE
[1:04:55] FIGHT WAS ON WHEN HE ARRIVED AT
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; YES. HE WAS BLESSED. YES, HE RECEIVED A
[1:05:01] HIGH JOB, BUT THE ENEMY WAS CREEPING IN
[1:05:04] LIKE A CREEPING PARALYSIS.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS PROBLEM AT? HE LOOKED AT ALL
[1:05:12] THE POSSIBILITIES.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; May maybe I'm out of place right here,
[1:05:19] but I want you to KNOW SATAN MANY TIMES
[1:05:21] WILL OFFER YOU JOBS THAT TAKES YOU OUT
[1:05:23] OF CHURCH. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He will want to MOVE YOU TO TIMBUKTU.
[1:05:29] AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT'S AT, BUT HE
[1:05:30] WANT TO MOVE YOU TO TIMBUKTU.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; MAYBE WHEN YOU COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE
[1:05:34] FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; I want YOU TO KNOW GOD BELIEVES IN GOING
[1:05:38] TO CHURCH.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURE SAYS, "FORSAKE NOT THE
[1:05:46] ASSEMBLING OF YOURSELVES THE MORE YOU
[1:05:47] SEE THAT DAY APPROACHING." AND LISTEN,
[1:05:50] IF YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND,
[1:05:51] YOU NEED TO GET IT OUT BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:05:53] GETTING READY TO GO HOME.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; I NEED EVERY SERVICE THAT I CAN GET
[1:05:58] MYSELF INTO.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, we need the strength. WE NEED
[1:06:02] THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; NEVER SETTLE FOR A SECONDHAND EXPERIENCE
[1:06:11] OR A LITTLE STORY OF THE BIBLE. AND ONCE
[1:06:13] YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE
[1:06:16] GOD OF THIS WORLD.
[1:06:25] Joseph was incredibly moved.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; All of our's wife came to him and told
[1:06:33] him, I'm just moving through this. All
[1:06:35] of our's wife went came to him said,
[1:06:38] "You're in charge of this whole house.
[1:06:41] Come lie with me."
[1:06:46] Nobody would have known.
[1:06:49] But you know,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; but you know,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; many times, and I'm going to go here,
[1:06:57] and I'm going to only spend just a
[1:06:58] couple of moments. Many times, Satan
[1:07:00] will come to you in the privacy of your
[1:07:02] home.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking to young people
[1:07:06] now,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And cause you to compromise, if you're
[1:07:09] not careful,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; your standards
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; because if you're in a private moment,
[1:07:20] and and and you know where I'm at
[1:07:22] because you know your situation.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to go to the wrong kind of
[1:07:26] pornographic sites.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to go to the wrong sites.
[1:07:31] Period.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to just just TO SPEND YOUR
[1:07:34] TIME IN AN UNWISE WAY.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Wrong kind of music. the wrong KIND OF
[1:07:41] THE WRONG KIND of an influence THAT
[1:07:43] COMES THROUGH. LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE
[1:07:44] TIME TO contaminate our soul.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; That's Paul is preaching that we need
[1:07:54] it.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID WE NEED A PENTECOSTAL
[1:07:57] REVIVAL IN OUR HEARTS.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; WE NEED A REAL REVIVAL OF SHAKING NOT TO
[1:08:02] BRING IT INTO MORE PEOPLE, BUT WHEN THE
[1:08:05] WIND HITS THE WATER AND IT WASHES THE
[1:08:07] TRASH OUT OF OUR LIVES.
[1:08:12] YOU SEE, THERE'S A PURPOSE. AND NOT ONLY
[1:08:15] IS JOSEPH, THERE'S A PURPOSE IN YOUR
[1:08:18] LIFE.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to thwart and derail THE
[1:08:22] PURPOSE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE AT A YOUNG
[1:08:25] AGE. SO, AS YOU BEGIN TO GET OLDER, IT
[1:08:29] CAN BRING BACK THE CONDEMNATION OF WHAT
[1:08:32] YOU DID AS A CHILD.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Parents sitting ALL OVER THIS BUILDING,
[1:08:35] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT JUST
[1:08:37] NOW. AND IT REMINDS YOU MAYBE A NIGHT
[1:08:39] MANY YEARS AGO
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; THAT HE CONSTANTLY YES YOU'VE BEEN
[1:08:44] CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:08:47] BUT THROUGH THE MEMORY CHANNEL AND THE
[1:08:49] AFFECTION CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH GOD GAVE
[1:08:52] HIM THE ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH HE
[1:08:54] BRINGS BACK THE MEMORIES OF YESTER YEAR.
[1:08:59] BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S THEREFORE NOW NO
[1:09:01] condemnation
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ who walk not
[1:09:06] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Friend says this. When God speaks to a
[1:09:15] man, he has faith. He has ambition and
[1:09:18] he has purpose.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And when God speaks TO A MAN, HE GIVES
[1:09:23] HIM A PURPOSE. WHEN GOD speaks to a man,
[1:09:25] HE GIVES HIM AMBITION. WHEN GOD speaks
[1:09:28] to a man, HE GIVES HIM FAITH TO DO IT,
[1:09:30] TO ACCOMPLISH OR TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE
[1:09:33] IN HIS LIFE AND WHAT GOD CALLED HIM TO
[1:09:35] DO. HE'S CALLED US TO BE OF THE CHURCH
[1:09:38] OF GOD. AMEN. You believe that?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD SETS A TIME AND HAS A
[1:09:43] PURPOSE for everything that he does.
[1:09:46] NOTHING HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY TO THOSE
[1:09:48] WHO LOVE THE LORD, WHO ARE CALLED
[1:09:50] ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. WE ARE
[1:09:53] PREDESTINATED AND EVERYTHING WORKS JUST
[1:09:56] RIGHT FOR THAT. HE cannot lie. He said
[1:09:59] IT WAS SO. AND EVERYTHING HAS its time
[1:10:01] and its season
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS TO BE THAT WAY. GOD IS BEHIND
[1:10:06] EVERY MOVE.
[1:10:10] SOMETIMES YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S
[1:10:12] GOING WRONG AND IT'S ALL UP TO US. BUT
[1:10:15] THOSE THINGS ARE PUT ON US, TRIALS AND
[1:10:17] WANDERINGS, AND IT'S TESTING TO SEE HOW
[1:10:21] THAT WE REACT TO THAT kind of an action.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, GOD SOMETIMES TAKES THESE
[1:10:27] PEOPLE OUT LIKE THAT AND SHAVES THEIR
[1:10:29] WHEELS OFF, THEIR OWN WHEELS OFF. HE
[1:10:32] SHOWS THEM THAT THEY CAN'T DO JUST WHAT
[1:10:34] THEY WANT TO DO. GOD HELP US RIGHT
[1:10:36] THERE.
[1:10:38] Every one of us have to wrestle with our
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; self-will.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK JOSEPH HAD TO WRESTLE WITH
[1:10:44] HIS? ABSOLUTELY.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; When he's reaching a level HE'S HE'S
[1:10:48] OVER AN ENTIRE CAPTAIN'S HOUSEHOLD AND
[1:10:51] EVERYTHING THAT'S SURROUNDING IT LOOKED
[1:10:53] GOOD, BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A PHASE. IT'S
[1:10:55] ONLY FOR A SEASON. IT IS A TRAINING PART
[1:10:58] OF HIS LIFE.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I seem like I'M DOING NOTHING.
[1:11:04] YOU'RE IN TRAINING JUST NOW. AMEN.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I I'M JUST GOING TO SCHOOL.
[1:11:12] YOU'RE IN TRAINING JUST NOW.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; EVERY SCHOOL PAPER THAT YOU'RE DOING,
[1:11:16] GOD IS TRAINING YOU.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; EVERY JOB. MAYBE YOU WORK AT MCDONALD'S.
[1:11:24] GOD HELP YOU.
[1:11:27] MAYBE YOU WORK AT MCDONALD'S AND EVERY
[1:11:29] BURGER THAT YOU MAKE. OH, BROTHER RON,
[1:11:31] I'M IN A DEAD END JOB. THAT MAY BE YOUR
[1:11:34] THOUGHTS, BUT IN THAT SITUATION, THERE'S
[1:11:36] A PART OF WHAT GOD IS TRAINING YOU FOR A
[1:11:39] GREATER ARE YOU WITH me now?
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; FOR A GREATER JOB.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT FOR IT'S NOT JUST FOR THIS
[1:11:45] HUMANITY, BUT IT'S THE SUPERNATURAL.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; There's just so many people that doesn't
[1:11:57] seem to have any kind of a purpose in
[1:11:59] their life.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they do that? They lose their
[1:12:02] focus
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; and it becomes such a distraction
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; when everything Oh, brother Ron, listen.
[1:12:10] Satan desires to get you to work 12 and
[1:12:13] 15 hours a day and before long you're
[1:12:15] home, you're you're you're just you're
[1:12:18] you know, when you go home, you're
[1:12:19] literally a zombie.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You come to church, you're literally a
[1:12:24] zombie.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're not careful, the
[1:12:28] world will literally try to consume you.
[1:12:31] It will literally try TO DEVOUR
[1:12:32] EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand, we must
[1:12:36] keep our focus in all things.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; WE MUST BE TOTALLY DISCIPLINED TO ALL OF
[1:12:41] THAT.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? WE MUST BE TOTALLY
[1:12:45] DISCIPLINED TO THE WORD and make sure no
[1:12:47] matter what phase that GOD HAS ALLOWED
[1:12:49] US TO BE IN, WE MUST BE TOTALLY
[1:12:52] DISCIPLINED TO THAT WORD BECAUSE THE
[1:12:54] REMEMBER THE ENEMY IS TRYING TO
[1:12:56] INTIMIDATE US
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LAYING INSIDE OF YOU IS AN
[1:13:01] ETERNAL PREDESTINATED sin
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and HE ONLY HAS YOUR FLESH TO WORK
[1:13:06] THROUGH. So he will INTIMIDATE YOU AND
[1:13:09] TELL YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED.
[1:13:12] YOU'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE
[1:13:14] NOT HANDSOME ENOUGH. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT
[1:13:16] YOU DON'T HAVE THE MILITARY TRAINING
[1:13:18] ENOUGH. LISTEN, HE DID THAT TO DAVID.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BYPASSED BY A PROPHET OF GOD. AND
[1:13:25] THAT PROPHET OF GOD WOULD HAVE CHOSE ALL
[1:13:27] OF HIS BROTHERS RATHER THAN HIM.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; You think that didn't wear on his mind?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE PROPHET COULDN'T PICK ME OUT.
[1:13:37] REMEMBER,
[1:13:41] WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS HERE.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; REACH OVER, TAKE RIGHT HAND, PUNCH.
[1:13:45] CAN'T PINCH. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS
[1:13:46] TONIGHT.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; But remember, WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FEELINGS.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; WE TABERNACLE. WE'RE THE TEMPLE OF THE
[1:13:55] HOLY GHOST.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; BUT LITERALLY, Satan will WEAR ON OUR
[1:13:58] FEELINGS. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; But the only thing THAT HE HAS TO WORK
[1:14:02] WITH IS TO TRY TO WEAR ON OUR FEELINGS
[1:14:04] AND REMIND US AND INTIMIDATE US
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; AND TRY TO PULL THE CONFIDENCE AWAY FROM
[1:14:09] US.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Jesse sent David
[1:14:15] to the battle. When he got to the
[1:14:17] battle, what did they do? They disained
[1:14:20] him.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He was going through the some of the
[1:14:24] same things that Job went through
[1:14:27] and Joseph went through.
[1:14:29] And even Ezekiel and Jeremiah went
[1:14:32] through it. Listen, and you go through
[1:14:35] it.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; HE GOES TO THE BATTLE AND HIS BROTHERS
[1:14:38] WHO ARE HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE HIM.
[1:14:41] BROTHER SAID HE WAS A POOR EXCUSE ON THE
[1:14:43] THRILL FOR A SOLDIER
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS THERE AND EVEN HIS BROTHERS
[1:14:48] SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO TAKING
[1:14:49] CARE OF PAPA?"
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; But he had a testimony.
[1:14:56] THE MAIN THING IS YOU HAVE A TESTIMONY
[1:14:58] NO MATTER WHAT OBSTACLE COMES UP YOUR
[1:15:00] WAY.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; AND HE BEGIN TO HEAR GOLIATH SCREAM. AND
[1:15:06] WHEN GOLIATH SCREAMED, HE WAS CURSING
[1:15:07] THE GOD OF ISRAEL.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; LISTEN. GOLIATH WAS IN GOOD SHAPE UNTIL
[1:15:12] DAVID SHOWED UP.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? WHY, BROTHER ONE? HE
[1:15:18] KNEW THE GOD OF JEHOVAH.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THAT God very personally.
[1:15:24] IT MAKES AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE WHEN
[1:15:26] YOU KNOW THAT God
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; and it's MORE THAN A QUOTE. IT'S MORE
[1:15:31] THAN A PICTURE ON YOUR WALL, BUT IT'S A
[1:15:33] LIVING REALITY.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It isn't daddy's experience and your
[1:15:38] mama's experience in YOUR PREACHER'S
[1:15:40] EXPERIENCE, BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; I was in the field, HE TELLS SAUL. I WAS
[1:15:46] IN THE FIELD and God gave me a bear and
[1:15:48] God GAVE ME A LION. He had a testimony.
[1:15:53] BROTHER, WHY DID HE GO BACK AND TELL
[1:15:55] THAT TESTIMONY AGAIN? LISTEN, HE NEEDED
[1:15:58] TO BUILD THE FAITH INSIDE OF HIS HEART
[1:16:00] AND REMIND THE ENEMY, GOD DID THAT FOR
[1:16:02] ME.
[1:16:03] HOW MANY TIMES does brother IN A PRAYER
[1:16:05] LINE GO BACK AND TELL STORY AFTER STORY
[1:16:08] AFTER STORY IS TO REMIND THE ENEMY OF
[1:16:10] WHAT GOD HAS already he
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; you he may look at YOU AND SAY YOU'RE
[1:16:20] NOT QUALIFIED TO BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:16:22] CHRIST you're you're not you know you
[1:16:25] FAIL AND YOU FALL LISTEN YOU GO BACK AND
[1:16:27] YOU REMIND HIM
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; LISTEN LAST YEAR
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; accountmen
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:32] THE ANCHOR SETTLED INSIDE MY HEART
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME TO me and he spoke to me.
[1:16:38] THE ANCHOR WAS TIED DOWN AND REGARDLESS
[1:16:41] OF HOW THE WIND FAILS, I WANT YOU TO
[1:16:43] KNOW GOD LIVES INSIDE of
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Those testimonies build the faith inside
[1:16:52] of your life. Yes sir.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Scripture says all the all that live
[1:16:59] godly in Christ shall bear persecution
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; the reproach of the word.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; He said you always have to stand this
[1:17:07] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:17:09] to see. Every man that comes up to
[1:17:12] Christ must first be child trained for
[1:17:14] the purpose that God has ordained for
[1:17:16] him you for. And remember, if you could
[1:17:19] just keep quiet, remember he's if he's
[1:17:22] called you for this, there's nothing to
[1:17:24] keep it from happening.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS AND TORMENT.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT GOD'S WORD WILL be made
[1:17:34] manifest. YOU ARE BORN FOR A PURPOSE AND
[1:17:37] NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:45] He said, "YOU MIGHT HAVE IMPERSONATORS
[1:17:48] AND EVERYTHING ELSE, but there'll never
[1:17:50] they will never they will never take
[1:17:53] your place."
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER RON, I'M AFRAID
[1:17:56] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO TAKE MY PLACE OR
[1:17:57] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET WHAT I'VE GOT."
[1:17:59] NOBODY'S GOING TO GO WHAT YOU WENT
[1:18:01] THROUGH to get where you're at
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS SINGLY DEVELOPED YOU
[1:18:09] WITH THE TRIALS OF YOUR LIFE AND THE
[1:18:12] TEMPTATIONS OF YOUR LIFE and the
[1:18:14] PROBLEMS OF YOUR OWN NATURE TO DEVELOP
[1:18:17] YOU HOW HE WANTS YOU TO BE.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; BOY, IF I WAS TALLER, LISTEN, IF I WAS
[1:18:23] IF I WAS MORE HANDSOME OR IF I WAS BUILT
[1:18:25] A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, I COULD BE A
[1:18:27] BETTER CHRISTIAN. GOD KNEW BEFORE THE
[1:18:29] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD EXACTLY HOW YOU
[1:18:32] WOULD BE.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE ENEMY INTIMIDATE YOU
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You can catch that. DON'T LET HIM
[1:18:46] INTIMIDATE YOU TRYING TO BE SOMEBODY
[1:18:48] ELSE. GOD WANTS YOU
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE YOU ARE.
[1:18:59] said this. He said, "God promised
[1:19:01] tonight when you come up out of the
[1:19:02] world, you separate yourself from all
[1:19:04] your earthly associates
[1:19:06] and all the old parties that you used to
[1:19:08] go to, the worldly amusements and
[1:19:11] drinking and smoking and gambling and
[1:19:13] all those things are separating
[1:19:16] and you're walking among a strange
[1:19:18] people that you haven't known before
[1:19:20] that say amen."
[1:19:23] spiritfilled,
[1:19:24] believing in all things, hoping in all
[1:19:26] things, waiting for the coming of the
[1:19:28] Lord, professing to be pilgrims and
[1:19:30] strangers and nothing that this world
[1:19:33] they don't desire. THEY'RE JUST FALLING
[1:19:35] AWAY from the things of the world. You
[1:19:37] see what I mean? You say, "Oh, brother
[1:19:39] Juan, BUT I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID MY
[1:19:41] FRIENDS, I'M AFRAID I'll have to lose my
[1:19:43] friends." I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, IF
[1:19:44] YOU GET CHRIST, YOUR WORLDLY FRIENDS
[1:19:46] WILL LEAVE YOU.
[1:19:52] If they're influencing ME THE WRONG WAY,
[1:19:54] I DON'T WANT NOTHING to do with them to
[1:19:55] start off with.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. BELOVED, NOW ARE WE
[1:20:00] THE SONS OF GOD, AND IT DOES NOT YET
[1:20:03] APPEAR WHAT WE SHALL BE, BUT WE KNOW
[1:20:05] WHEN WE SHALL WHEN HE SHALL APPEAR, WE
[1:20:08] SHALL BE LIKE HIM. BROTHER SAID, "WE ARE
[1:20:11] INVITED TO SHAPE OUR CHARACTER TO HIS
[1:20:14] CHARACTER."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; FOR WE SHALL SEE HIM AS HE IS, AND EVERY
[1:20:20] MAN HATH THIS HOPE IN HIM AS PURIFY
[1:20:22] HIMSELF, EVEN AS HE IS PURE. NOTICE THIS
[1:20:25] SCRIPTURE. 1 Corinthians 15. AND WE WERE
[1:20:28] BORN IN THE IMAGE OF THE EARTHLY, AND WE
[1:20:30] SHALL ALSO BEAR THE IMAGE OF THE
[1:20:32] HEAVENLY. NOW THIS I SAY, BRETHREN, THAT
[1:20:34] FLESH AND BLOOD CANNOT INHERIT THE
[1:20:36] KINGDOM OF GOD, NEITHER DO CORRUPTION
[1:20:38] INHERIT CORRUPT INCORRUPTION. BEHOLD, I
[1:20:41] SHOW YOU A MYSTERY. WE SHALL NOT ALL
[1:20:44] SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED IN THE
[1:20:47] MOMENT, in the twinkle of an eye, at the
[1:20:50] last trump. FOR THE TRUMPET SHALL SOUND,
[1:20:52] AND THE DEAD SHALL BE RAISED
[1:20:53] INCORRUPTIBLE, AND WE SHALL BE CHANGED.
[1:20:56] AMEN.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; For this CORRUPTION MUST PUT ON
[1:21:00] INCORRUPTION, AND THIS MORTAL
[1:21:01] IMMORTALITY. AND WHEN THIS CORRUPTIBLE
[1:21:04] SHALL HAVE PUT ON INCORRUPTION, AND THIS
[1:21:06] MORTAL HOUSE HAVE PUT ON IMMORTALITY,
[1:21:08] THEN SHALL BE BROUGHT TO PASS THE SAYING
[1:21:10] THAT IS WRITTEN, DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP
[1:21:12] IN VICTORY.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 says, "Brethren,
[1:21:20] be followers together of me. Mark them
[1:21:23] which also walk you have an example for
[1:21:26] many walk of whom I told YOU OFTEN AND
[1:21:29] NOW TELL YOU even weeping that there are
[1:21:31] enemies of the CROSS OF CHRIST WHOSE END
[1:21:33] IS DESTRUCTION WHOSE GOD IS THEIR BELLY
[1:21:36] WHOSE GLORY IS THEIR SHAME WHOSE MIND
[1:21:38] WHOSE MIND EARTHLY THINGS FOR OUR
[1:21:41] CONVERSATION IS IN HEAVEN
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; FROM WHENCE ALSO WE LOOK FOR THE SAVIOR
[1:21:47] OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO SHALL
[1:21:49] CHANGE OUR VILE BODY THAT IT MAY BE
[1:21:52] FASHIONED AFTER HIS OWN GLORIOUS BODY
[1:21:55] ACCORDING TO THE WORKING WORD OF LIFE.
[1:21:56] HE IS ABLE TO EVEN SUBDUE ALL THINGS
[1:21:59] UNTO HIMSELF.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Notice the scripture. FOR HE THAT HATH
[1:22:04] BEGUN A GOOD WORK IN YOU.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD LIKES PROJECTS.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And I want you TO UNDERSTAND, HE WON'T
[1:22:11] QUIT.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T QUIT. HE'S NOT THE KIND OF
[1:22:17] BUSINESSMAN THAT JUST TAKES ON A JOB AND
[1:22:19] HE LEAVES THAT JOB AFTER A LITTLE WHILE.
[1:22:21] HE WON'T QUIT. LISTEN, WHEN JOSEPH WAS
[1:22:24] IN A DUNGEON, GOD WASN'T FINISHED.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL
[1:22:32] STAGE.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THERE. HE EVEN PROSPERED IN JAIL.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, IF YOU'RE A
[1:22:41] PREDESTINATED STATE, HE'LL PROSPER YOU.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; HE'LL WATCH OVER YOU.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I'm in the valley of the SHADOW OF
[1:22:49] DEATH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTS YOU
[1:22:51] TO BE. HE WANTS YOU TO BE RIGHT THERE AT
[1:22:54] THAT VERY MOMENT.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A TESTIMONY ON THE
[1:22:57] EARTH
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; OF THE GREATEST THAT HAS EVER BEEN ON
[1:23:00] THE FACE of the earth.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, ENDURE THAT TESTIMONY.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting excited. This
[1:23:11] excites me.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It so excites me tonight TO KNOW THAT I
[1:23:15] AM STANDING AMONG people that are of
[1:23:17] eternal value.
[1:23:20] YOU'RE LIKE FLY BY NIGHT PEOPLE.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT THINK
[1:23:25] THEY'RE WORTH SOMETHING. THEY STICK
[1:23:27] THEIR NOSES IN THE AIR.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; THEY CALL THEMSELVES WEALTHY. I'LL TELL
[1:23:31] YOU THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE
[1:23:32] WORLD EXCEPT for me.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have a DOLLAR TO MY NAME. I WANT
[1:23:40] YOU TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWES.
[1:23:43] YOU OWN IT.
[1:23:52] BROTHER, I'm so consumed with everything
[1:23:53] around me. I want you to understand
[1:23:56] Joseph. He looked at walls. He looked at
[1:23:59] bars.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He looked at guards every day.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Laid in the back of his mind was a
[1:24:07] vision.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; In the back of his mind, HIS BRETHREN
[1:24:13] WERE GOING TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM.
[1:24:16] And he kept THAT VISION IN THE BACK OF
[1:24:18] HIS MIND
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; AND HE KEPT WORKING TOWARD THAT VISION.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I HAVEN'T
[1:24:24] SEEN A VISION." GOD SHOWED YOU A VISION.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; He took A PROPHET OF GOD. HE SHOWED YOU
[1:24:30] YOUR FUTURE.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; HE NOT ONLY SHOWED YOU YOUR FUTURE, HE
[1:24:33] SHOWED THE DEVIL HIS FUTURE.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE. YOU'RE GOING
[1:24:41] TO ENJOY ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO HOLLYWOOD STARS,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO KINGS OF THE EARTH,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO SPORTS STARS,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; when there's no AMBASSADORS OF THE
[1:24:54] WORLD, YOU'RE GOING TO STAND THERE
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SERVE THE purpose of
[1:25:00] almighty God.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] Hallelujah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; You see, you're standing HERE AS A
[1:25:11] PROJECTION OF GOD'S MIND.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; MICHELANGELO WORKED ON THAT STATUE 44
[1:25:16] YEARS. THERE WAS A LOT OF REMOVING OF
[1:25:19] THE EXCESS.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I go to CHURCH AND THE PREACHER
[1:25:22] HITS ME. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE CALLED, "NO,
[1:25:24] IT'S JUST A REMOVING OF THE EXCESS."
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S JUST WORKING ON YOU. YOU'RE A
[1:25:31] PROJECT AND IT'S rocking and it's
[1:25:34] trailing and it's fading and it becomes
[1:25:37] personal when it comes to your
[1:25:38] household. YOU SEE, IT'S GOD THAT'S IN
[1:25:41] THE PROJECT.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PROJECT MANAGER.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I PLAY PAUL WITH I PLAY I PLAY
[1:25:53] VOLLEYBALL WITH WITH WITH BROTHER TOM.
[1:25:55] HE'S OUR BROTHER. HE'S JUST A GUY THAT'S
[1:25:57] AROUND, YOU KNOW. BROTHER VISTOL, YOU
[1:25:59] KNOW, I'VE KNOWN THEM FOR YEARS. LISTEN,
[1:26:01] BUT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU BECOME SO
[1:26:03] FAMILIAR. BUT THEY'RE GOD'S AGENTS ON
[1:26:05] THE EARTH.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S WICK
[1:26:10] WAS DIPPED INSIDE OF THAT, SIR,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; ALONG COMES A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY AND
[1:26:14] DIPPED IN THAT same
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; and IT TAKES THE MYSTERY. ARE YOU WITH
[1:26:19] ME NOW? IT takes the mystery of that
[1:26:21] WORD AND THEY'RE ANOINTED TO PREACH THAT
[1:26:23] WORD TO YOU TO DEVELOP YOU
[1:26:27] to express the glory of God.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN PAUL'S DAY OR
[1:26:34] PETER'S DAY OR JOHN'S DAY. YOU'RE LIVING
[1:26:36] IN PRIDE.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the
[1:26:51] When the Holy Spirit begins to beat on
[1:26:53] us with the gospel hymn
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; until all things of the world is beaten
[1:26:57] out
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; and we reflect the image
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus then I believe we
[1:27:03] become Christians.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; For the word Christian means to be
[1:27:07] Christlike.
[1:27:11] That doesn't mean that we have to grow a
[1:27:13] long beard AND AS AN ARTIST PAINT
[1:27:15] pictures him having AND NEITHER DOES IT
[1:27:17] mean that we grow long hair as the
[1:27:19] artist pictures him having or the robe
[1:27:21] that he wore. For we're living in
[1:27:23] another DAY. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE
[1:27:25] TO reflect the physical image, but we
[1:27:28] must IN OUR SOULS REFLECT THE HOLY
[1:27:30] SPIRIT and his manner of life.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that tonight? man makes a
[1:27:38] statement so love it. HE SAYS, "GIVE ME
[1:27:40] A PREACHER. GIVE ME A CHRISTIAN. GIVE ME
[1:27:43] A HOUSEWIFE THAT'S A CHRISTIAN."
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Give me a farmer. GIVE ME A FACTORY
[1:27:50] WORKER THAT'LL PUT GOD FIRST IN
[1:27:53] EVERYTHING.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I've got God first in my life.
[1:27:59] IN EVERYTHING, YOUR FRUITS WILL PROVE
[1:28:01] WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; COME SUNDAY MORNING, IT'LL PROVE WHETHER
[1:28:05] YOU DO OR NOT. COME WEDNESDAY NIGHT,
[1:28:07] it'll prove whether you do OR NOT.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS FIRST PLACE. HE DON'T WANT
[1:28:12] SECOND PLACE. HE DON'T WANT THIRD PLACE.
[1:28:14] IT'S WHERE YOUR ENERGIES ARE SPENT at
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll show you a man." This
[1:28:25] goes back to the covenant. I'll show you
[1:28:27] a man that'll be successful in spite of
[1:28:30] all the devil can put on him.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He seeks God first.
[1:28:38] He said the word has always bore a
[1:28:40] reproach.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't get bored with these
[1:28:43] quotes.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; He said all through the ages God
[1:28:45] anointed his word has been a reproach.
[1:28:48] But that's the reason it's so hard for
[1:28:49] people who doesn't understand how to
[1:28:51] accept that reproach. Can you remember
[1:28:53] the disciples returning back and
[1:28:55] rejoicing because they figured out THAT
[1:28:56] THEY WERE COUNTED WORTHY to stand as a
[1:28:58] reproach now. But all that live godly IN
[1:29:00] CHRIST SHALL BEAR PERSECUTION.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; LADY JOSEPH WONDERED IN HIMSELF, "WHY AM
[1:29:07] I HERE?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; WHY AM I IN A DUNGEON?" HE WAS EXACTLY
[1:29:12] WHERE GOD WANTED HIM TO BE.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; BROTHER ROD, WHY IN THE WORLD AM I GOING
[1:29:20] THROUGH THIS?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE.
[1:29:30] HE says you always have to stand this
[1:29:33] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:29:35] to see every man that comes to Christ
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; must be child trained
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; for THE PURPOSE OF GOD HAS ORDAINED FOR
[1:29:43] YOU. And remember, if you COULD JUST
[1:29:46] KEEP QUIET, REMEMBER IF HE'S CALLED YOU
[1:29:49] TO THIS, THERE'S NOTHING.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; that keep it from happening.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I FEEL SO BLOCKED. LISTEN, IF
[1:30:00] GOD HAS ORDAINED YOU
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS CALLED YOU,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE DEVIL CAN DO,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; can hold a
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Notice what he says, and you forgive me.
[1:30:17] I just I just want to lay this down. He
[1:30:19] said, "HEAVENS AND EARTH IS MET. GOD AND
[1:30:21] MAN IS RECONCILED. A restored Eden has
[1:30:24] ALREADY BEGUN. ALL THE CURSE IS GONE.
[1:30:26] JUST LIKE THE CURSE OF SIN. WHEN THE
[1:30:28] HOLY GHOST ACCEPTS YOU, HE SAYS YOU
[1:30:30] DON'T ACCEPT IT. IT ACCEPTS YOU BECAUSE
[1:30:32] IT'S GOD'S ATTRIBUTE. AND IF IT'S THE
[1:30:34] HOLY GHOST, IT MEANS GOD'S SPIRIT. IT'S
[1:30:36] ATTRIBUTE. THE THOUGHT OF GOD HAS
[1:30:38] ACCEPTED YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE ORDAINED
[1:30:40] FOR THAT PURPOSE. And yet you WERE BORN
[1:30:42] IN SIN. BUT GOD HAD THAT ATTRIBUTE. AND
[1:30:45] HERE YOU'RE EXPRESSED YOURSELF ON THE
[1:30:46] EARTH. AND HE COMES DOWN AND HE GETS
[1:30:48] YOU. AND YOU'RE BACK HERE. AND HE'S and
[1:30:51] he hears WHERE YOU BELONG. SIN LOST ALL
[1:30:54] OF ITS POWER.
[1:30:57] THE DESIRE OF SIN HAS GONE FROM YOUR
[1:30:59] HEART WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES IN.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU'RE A RESTORED PERSON
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; AND when the earth is restored at by THE
[1:31:07] SAME TIME HE SAID THERE CAN BE NO MORE
[1:31:09] CURSING, NO MORE STORMS, NO MORE WINDS,
[1:31:12] NO MORE TYPHOONS,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RECONCILED. God and man has met.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Where did that take place? IT HAPPENS
[1:31:20] RIGHT HERE.
[1:31:23] MOVING.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He says this. He said, "We want to draw
[1:31:29] this first into our mind that there is
[1:31:31] not one thing that can destroy us
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; until the purpose for he
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; who created us has been fulfilled."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, why did THIS ACCIDENT
[1:31:44] HAPPEN? WHY DID THAT situation happen?
[1:31:46] LISTEN, THE DEVIL CAN'T TOUCH A HAIR OF
[1:31:48] your head
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; until he goes AND GETS PERMISSION FROM
[1:31:52] PAPA.
[1:31:59] WHERE YOU FEEL AT SATAN? OH, I'VE BEEN
[1:32:01] GOING TO AND FRO IN THE EARTH.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; WHERE AT? I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
[1:32:05] CLOVERDALE.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I'm down in plain THIS WEEK. WHAT HAVE
[1:32:10] YOU BEEN DOING? I'M TRYING TO DESTROY
[1:32:12] YOUTH CAMP.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; NOT A CHANCE.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to rock their worlds.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO CAUSE THEM TO MAYBE GET
[1:32:21] DISTRACTED FROM THE NO SIR. No sir.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram said before HE CAN SICK
[1:32:27] THE ENEMY ENEMY ON YOU, he has first had
[1:32:30] fellowship with you.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; What has he done, Brother Ron? HE'S WENT
[1:32:35] TO SCHOOL WITH YOU.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN THE CAR WITH YOU.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN YOUR BEDROOM.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; HE'S WATCHED YOU ON YOUR KNEES PRAYING.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S WATCHED YOU IN THE SACRED MOMENTS
[1:32:49] WORSHIPING THE LORD. AND NOBODY WAS
[1:32:52] INTERFERING. YOU WERE JUST IN A SHINE OF
[1:32:55] GLORY WITH THEM THAT INTERVAL. AND HE
[1:32:57] WAS HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. BUT THERE'S A THOUSAND
[1:33:01] PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING. BUT SOMETIMES HE
[1:33:03] COMES TO YOU PERSONALLY.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And before that, he can sick THE ENEMY
[1:33:14] ON YOU. HE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
[1:33:16] HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE IN YOU
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; that when you go through the trial
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; when you go THROUGH THE TRIAL,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THAT.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He's got confidence.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Many times we WANT TO TESTIFY WHAT GOD
[1:33:33] DID FOR US AND I'M TRUSTING GOD. I'M
[1:33:36] THANKING GOD. BUT LISTEN, WHEN THE DE
[1:33:38] WHEN GOD WANTS TO TESTIFY, HE CALLS HIS
[1:33:41] ENEMY UP AND SAYS, "COME HERE.
[1:33:43] I WANT TO HAVE A TESTIMONY SERVICE.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; He don't CALL THE ANGELS TOGETHER. HE
[1:33:51] SAYS, "COME HERE, SATAN. I WANT TO HAVE
[1:33:53] A TESTIMONY SERVICE."
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Have you CONSIDERED EDIS?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU considered Tom Ray?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Have you considered Ron Spencer?
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I consider them, BUT THERE'S A
[1:34:07] PILLAR OF FIRE ALL AROUND THEM. THERE'S
[1:34:09] ANGELS in amen.
[1:34:12] Yes, sir.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A MESSAGE, THIS
[1:34:16] ALL-ENCOMPASSING MESSAGE. LISTEN, THEY
[1:34:19] they can believe THAT THEY'RE A SUPER
[1:34:21] RACE, A SUPER CHURCH.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE BONE AND THESE
[1:34:24] BONES ARE LIFE OF HIS LIFE. THEY BELIEVE
[1:34:26] THAT WITH ALL THEIR HEART,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THEM? OH, YOU HAVE
[1:34:31] CONSIDERED THEM.
[1:34:36] And then comes your testing and you feel
[1:34:38] like an orphan child
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; and Satan whispers into your ear
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; that God don't love you. And you know
[1:34:45] right there he just crossed the line.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz he loved you when you were yet A
[1:34:50] SINNER.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that HE GAVE
[1:34:53] HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER
[1:34:54] BELIEVETH IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; LET'S HAVE eternal life in the house.
[1:35:02] IF NOBODY ELSE LOVES YOU IN THE WORLD,
[1:35:05] BROTHER, I'VE NEVER HEARD I LOVE YOU
[1:35:06] FROM NOBODY IN THE WORLD. GOD SENT YOU A
[1:35:09] LOT.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; HE SENT you a lot,
[1:35:13] I love you.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; On my purpose,
[1:35:26] my purpose is kind of like
[1:35:31] just
[1:35:32] I just don't know.
[1:35:35] All I do is come to church and clap my
[1:35:37] hands. That's a victory.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's incredible victory.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; All I do is I just come and I sit and I
[1:35:46] worship the Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; That's incredible.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're one in a million people.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT HAVE
[1:35:58] absolutely no desire.
[1:36:02] THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO EVEN
[1:36:05] SPEND 10 MINUTES in this tent.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Now, IN THE REGION OF HELL, THERE'S A
[1:36:10] LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE
[1:36:12] TONIGHT
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; CUZ THEY MIGHT PASS THEIR OPPORTUNITY.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, YOU PASS PEOPLE ON THE
[1:36:19] STREET THAT WOULDN'T GIVE $10 TO SIT IN
[1:36:21] THIS BUILDING TONIGHT.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; They don't care. THEY HAVE NO DESIRE.
[1:36:26] BUT GOD PLACED THE DESIRE DOWN inside of
[1:36:30] you.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; God put that thing.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And God KNOWS WHERE HE PUT IT.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; TO GO GET YOU.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER ON OUR RUN. JUST GO AHEAD.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; HE CAN FOLLOW YOU TO THE EDGE OF THE
[1:36:50] EARTH. HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND HIS WAY.
[1:37:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I say this from personal experience.
[1:37:07] I ran.
[1:37:13] I grew up in the message.
[1:37:15] I was brother's funeral. I grew up in
[1:37:18] the message. I heard I heard brother's
[1:37:20] voice every day.
[1:37:24] I didn't hear I didn't hear television.
[1:37:26] I heard brother
[1:37:29] every day.
[1:37:31] There came a time that I ran I ran from
[1:37:34] the Lord.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; But in his loving care and grace, he
[1:37:39] knows how to follow you.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; And he tries to bury. You say, "Brother
[1:37:47] Ron, I'm running even sitting in this
[1:37:48] building tonight." He knows how to
[1:37:50] follow you.
[1:37:53] and he don't mind allowing you to grow
[1:37:55] old.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; He's not in a great big hurry.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's aging.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; You're the one THAT'S GETTING GREAT.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GETTING STOOPED
[1:38:09] SHOULDERS.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; WHY NOT SPEND THAT ENERGY FOR JESUS
[1:38:12] CHRIST?
[1:38:17] YOU SEE, GOD IS eternal
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and he KNOWS HOW TO FOLLOW YOU. GO TO
[1:38:22] THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. GO TO ALASKA. GO
[1:38:24] WHEREVER. HE KNOWS HOW TO SEND A
[1:38:26] PREACHER RIGHT TO YOU.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HOW TO SEND A WORSE WOMAN TO
[1:38:31] YOU.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'LL CLEAN OUT A STABLE.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; HIRE A PREACHER. AND MAYBE ONE BOY GETS
[1:38:37] SAVED IN THAT ENTIRE MEETING. THAT'LL
[1:38:39] LEAD 500 500,000 SOULS TO JESUS CHRIST.
[1:38:44] GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Joseph was down there
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; with a butler and a baker.
[1:38:56] Weren't exactly credible human beings,
[1:39:02] but they were spiritual enough to have a
[1:39:03] dream.
[1:39:07] They were quarreling amongst him.
[1:39:10] And so he just simply expressed the
[1:39:11] message of the hour to them.
[1:39:15] Even in a jail, he expressed the message
[1:39:18] of the hour.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He expressed the life.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; There was something about him. NO MATTER
[1:39:24] WHERE HE WAS, HE GLOWED.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; The presence of God just glowed in his
[1:39:29] life.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; It was JUST LIKE A SHAKINA GLORY. NO
[1:39:32] MATTER WHERE HE WAS AT, you can you CAN
[1:39:34] SELL HIS COAT. YOU CAN THROW HIM IN A HE
[1:39:37] THROW HIM IN A DUNGEON. NO MATTER WHERE
[1:39:39] HE WAS AT, GOD WAS THERE.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And he SPENDS ALL OF THIS TIME AND HE
[1:39:44] WAS IT WAS IN THAT CONDITION. And
[1:39:46] listen, IT LOOKED HORRIBLE for him. BUT
[1:39:48] NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS AT, HE SIMPLY WAS
[1:39:51] FULFILLING THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, HE WAS ON HIS WAY.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; AND HE KEPT GOD'S VISION IN HIS MIND.
[1:39:58] LISTEN,
[1:40:01] HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS ALL GOING TO
[1:40:03] COME TOGETHER
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER, IF GOD IS THE ONE
[1:40:07] THAT'S PROVIDED THE VISION,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; he's more THAN ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, HOW'S THIS ALL GOING TO
[1:40:14] WIND UP WITH ISRAEL AND THE HASPEL?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man the other day
[1:40:20] that just came to our church and he was
[1:40:22] a denominational man and he said, uh, I
[1:40:25] asked him, I said,
[1:40:27] You ever read much about the image of
[1:40:29] the beast? He said, "Oh yeah." He said,
[1:40:30] "My former pastor taught me that the
[1:40:32] Hezbollah is the image of the beast."
[1:40:39] I just I just kind of amused
[1:40:43] and I thought, you know, thank God for
[1:40:44] truth.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Thank God for truth.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; When I begin to just spend maybe 10
[1:40:53] minutes with him, his eyes begin to open
[1:40:54] up.
[1:40:56] That's how it all works. You see, you
[1:40:58] see here we're sitting tonight and the
[1:41:00] whole world is shaking.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; They're in a turmoil. How is this going
[1:41:04] to happen? An analyst are saying this
[1:41:06] and saying this and saying this and
[1:41:08] you're in the ark of safety.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; You don't need to build a bomb shelter.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; You've already had an INOCULATION OF THE
[1:41:16] HOLY GHOST.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You're under a token
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; that IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPLIED TO YOU.
[1:41:23] IT'S ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; YES, WE MAY FEEL PRESSURE. YES, WE MAY
[1:41:28] HAVE FEEL SOME SQUEEZE, BUT WE'VE
[1:41:30] ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED THE GRACE
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; TO HELP US MAKE IT THROUGH IT.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT JOSEPH KEPT HIS MIND
[1:41:39] ON. YES, THIS IS PRESSURE. YES, THIS IS
[1:41:42] DARKNESS. YES, THIS IS PERSECUTION. THIS
[1:41:45] ISN'T WHAT I LIKE. BUT HE KEPT HIS MIND
[1:41:47] ON THE FOCUS OF THAT VISION.
[1:41:50] And one DAY HE WAS INVITED TO THE KING'S
[1:41:53] CHAMBER AND HE SHAVED AND HE CLEANED
[1:41:55] HIMSELF UP.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; AND HE STEPPED BEFORE THE KING EXACTLY
[1:42:01] WHERE HE WAS ORDAINED TO STAND.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS CALLED TO STAND. IT
[1:42:06] HAD BEEN A LONG ROAD.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It been a long ROAD COMING UP TO THIS
[1:42:12] POINT. HE HAD A LOT OF TESTIMONIES
[1:42:14] GETTING TO THIS SPOT, BUT HE was
[1:42:16] standing EXACTLY
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY where God or you stand.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been a LONG TIME IN THIS
[1:42:24] ROAD, BUT YOU'RE STANDING EXACTLY WHERE
[1:42:27] GOD HAS ORDAINED YOU TO STAND.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Remember what God has ordained or what
[1:42:40] God has imagined in his heart. He's
[1:42:42] going to fulfill it.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; How many were born after 1977?
[1:42:51] Raise your hands up high. After 1977,
[1:42:55] some of you trying to figure out when
[1:42:56] you were born.
[1:43:03] I could speak in Zul.
[1:43:12] You were born in total darkness.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; The wickedest world there's ever been.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Even a prophet could see over into it.
[1:43:26] You were ordained.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; You were called before the foundation of
[1:43:33] the world.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Just take just a moment here. Listen,
[1:43:38] when God in his infinite mind was
[1:43:40] looking over who all was going to be on
[1:43:42] the earth,
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; he chose you
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; to be one of the men to fulfill the
[1:43:51] purpose of the hour.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He chose you. Oh, brother Ron, nobody
[1:43:56] even knows my name. Don't matter. He
[1:43:58] knows your name.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm insignificant. I I'm a
[1:44:05] nobody. LISTEN, WITH GOD, YOU ARE
[1:44:06] SOMEBODY.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; You are somebody. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
[1:44:11] YOUR PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE TO THE
[1:44:13] DEVIL.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; You're his worst nightmare.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, BUT THE DEVIL TORMENTS ME
[1:44:21] SO BAD. YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG. YOU'RE
[1:44:23] TORMENTING THE ENEMY.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Your life is tormenting the enemy.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Your victory is tormenting the enemy.
[1:44:34] And just AS MUCH AS ISRAEL HAS PUT IT IN
[1:44:36] THEIR GOD HAS PUT IT IN THEIR HEART,
[1:44:38] DRIVE BACK THEIR ENEMIES. I'm not giving
[1:44:40] up.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; He's put something IN YOUR HEART.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I will not accept compromise.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT STEP BACK. I WILL NOT TURN
[1:44:56] AROUND.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; I will be a liar.
[1:45:02] I am really power.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I am his victory.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; I am the vic.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; WHO BROTHER RON? YOU
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; I AM. AMEN.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; YOU.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I I DON'T DO MUCH. I WANT
[1:45:25] YOU TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STANDING
[1:45:27] HERE TONIGHT, YOU'RE SITTING HERE
[1:45:29] TONIGHT, YOU ARE A VICTORY.
[1:45:41] BROTHER Brown was preaching Garnet
[1:45:43] Pete's funeral.
[1:45:47] He makes this quotation.
[1:45:49] He said, "I am so happy as far as I know
[1:45:52] within the reach of my understandings by
[1:45:54] the word of God, by the witness of his
[1:45:57] holy spirit."
[1:45:59] This boy met that condition.
[1:46:02] He was born of the spirit of God, a
[1:46:04] changed man. The spirit of God was upon
[1:46:07] this little fell. He was a staunched
[1:46:10] Christian.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; He served God's purpose.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; What if he would HAVE WOULD HAVE DIED
[1:46:18] BEFORE THIS TIME? POLIO DROVE HIM TO
[1:46:20] GOD.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; He was TO BE A TOBACCO AUCTIONEER.
[1:46:25] THAT'S WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T HIS PURPOSE AT ALL. HE KNEW
[1:46:30] THAT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO BE A CHRISTIAN.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; NOW A TOBACCO AUCTIONEER, SOMEBODY SAID
[1:46:36] MAYBE 75 YEARS FROM TODAY IF THE WORLD
[1:46:39] SHOULD STAND THAT LONG, GARNET WAS A
[1:46:41] GREAT AUCTIONEER. MAYBE THAT'S ALL A
[1:46:43] MINISTER COULD HAVE SAID AT HIS FUNERAL.
[1:46:45] HE WAS A GREAT AUCTIONEER. BUT WHAT CAN
[1:46:47] WE SAY TODAY? HE'S A CHRISTIAN.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; AS AN AUCTIONEER WITHOUT THE GERM OF
[1:46:52] LIFE, JUST A MEMORY OF A GENERATION,
[1:46:55] HE'S GONE from among a few men. BUT NOW
[1:46:58] HE'S AMONGST IMMORTALS.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; You just have a little sister THAT
[1:47:04] PASSED BEYOND THIS ROUND. SHE SERVED
[1:47:06] GOD'S PURPOSE.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; SHE'S STANDING amongst immortals.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. She's waiting on you.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; She served the purpose.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, WAS A DEFEAT. NO, WAS A VICTORY.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; SATAN SWORE HE WOULD GET, BUT GOD TOOK
[1:47:26] CARE OF IT ALL.
[1:47:29] YOUR ENEMY HAS SWORE THAT HE WOULD GET
[1:47:31] YOU. HE SWORE WITH everything you need,
[1:47:34] HE WOULD BOMBARD YOU WITH EVERY ROUND OF
[1:47:36] TELEVISION, with every realm of music,
[1:47:39] every round THAT HE COULD BOMBARD YOU
[1:47:41] WITH A MESSAGE protecting you.
[1:47:45] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:49] Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; I can hear.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says here. The Lord hath
[1:48:04] this day to for his people to be a
[1:48:06] particular people
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; as he promised them that thou should
[1:48:10] keep thy commandments.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12, he says, "NOW ARE WE
[1:48:15] THE BODY of Christ members in
[1:48:16] particular?" Ephesians 5:33,
[1:48:19] nevertheless, let every one of you in
[1:48:21] particular, he says, and he begins to
[1:48:24] come down, excuse me, EVEN AS HIS WIFE
[1:48:26] THAT is her husband. Titus 2:14, WHO
[1:48:29] GAVE HIMSELF FOR US THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM
[1:48:31] US FROM ALL INIQUITY, PURIFY UNTO
[1:48:33] HIMSELF A PECULIAR PEOPLE, ZIOUS OF GOOD
[1:48:36] WORKS. FIRST, FIRST PETERAP 2:9. BUT YOU
[1:48:40] ARE A CHOSEN generation
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; and Royal preach.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't Roy? I'm sitting with them
[1:48:48] tonight.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; No matter where you're at,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; the ground was just going to mail some
[1:48:59] mail.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; His plane had been grounded.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Said, I believe I'll go mail some mail.
[1:49:07] And he starts going down the road. The
[1:49:09] Lord says, "Come with me.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Now, another one of the pray
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; she was not a part of the who's who.
[1:49:32] She didn't know the name William Brown,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; but she said, "I'd be like the shootite
[1:49:37] woman."
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I'd be like the shootite woman. Where is
[1:49:42] my life at?
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; SHE SIMPLY WAS FULFILLING HER POSITION
[1:49:49] AND her purpose of life.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, her testimony WILL GO AROUND THE
[1:49:54] world many times.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS IN CONTACT WITH GOD.
[1:49:59] THREE HEBREW CHILDREN WE DON'T KNOW
[1:50:01] ANYTHING ABOUT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
[1:50:03] OF JOB THEY HAD, HOW MUCH FAMILY THAT
[1:50:05] THEY HAD. BUT WE HAVE A TESTIMONY THAT
[1:50:07] THEY FULFILLED THE PURPOSE OF GOD.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; They would not bend. They would not bow.
[1:50:13] They would not defile theirelves.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; They went to THE FIERY FURNACE. ARE YOU
[1:50:18] WITH ME TONIGHT? YOU WILL STAND IN THAT
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; JALLELUJAH.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to us? When a man once
[1:50:30] catches that vision of the invisible God
[1:50:32] and know that he's he's always present,
[1:50:34] there's something that stabilized that
[1:50:37] man's thinking. It stabilizes his
[1:50:39] action, his action. And in the time of
[1:50:42] distress or trouble, it'll still make
[1:50:44] him look upward.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, you can't lose.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; There's no way that you can lose
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; when you're looking upward.
[1:51:03] Brother
[1:51:09] shar
[1:51:14] something in my heart to witness to one
[1:51:16] person
[1:51:17] about this message.
[1:51:21] Now after you after you
[1:51:24] witness to all your your neighbors and
[1:51:27] your enemy, you begin to run out of
[1:51:29] people.
[1:51:33] Lord, I need to witness.
[1:51:37] Listen,
[1:51:39] in your homes are some of the greatest
[1:51:41] missionary journeys that you can be in.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; I might get called from heaven,
[1:51:47] but I want you to understand,
[1:51:51] God, how do I do this?
[1:51:53] I witness in my own neighborhood like I
[1:51:56] should
[1:52:00] friend of mine said
[1:52:05] I went home and told my wife
[1:52:13] I was expecting no from her she said oh
[1:52:15] that'd be great
[1:52:19] you know I walked to a door knocked on
[1:52:21] the door and got those doors slammed in
[1:52:22] my face with wanting to hand them a
[1:52:24] track.
[1:52:30] I knocked on their door and I told them
[1:52:32] I said Spencer's chief sweetheart
[1:52:42] bucks
[1:52:48] over THE ONE. YOU SEE, YOU SIMPLY FIND
[1:52:50] THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN your life
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; and you catch THE CATEGORY THAT GOD
[1:52:55] WANTS TO BLESS YOU IN.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I I I stood before some some
[1:53:03] HOLLYWOOD STARS AND WITNESS TO them the
[1:53:06] message
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; as a chimney sweep.
[1:53:10] I stood before mayors and governors and
[1:53:14] witness to them as a chimney sweep.
[1:53:19] I'm just dropping this to you. This is
[1:53:20] free.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I STOOD BEFORE JUST A LATE I STOOD
[1:53:27] BEFORE THE THE THE PRESIDENT OF AN
[1:53:29] ENTIRE COLLEGE. I SAT AND DRINK HIS
[1:53:31] COFFEE AND I WITNESSED THE MESSAGE OF
[1:53:33] THE HOUR. AND HE AND HE SAID TO ME, "YOU
[1:53:36] KNOW, IF YOU'D HAVE KNOCKED ON MY DOOR
[1:53:38] AND TOLD ME YOU WANTED TO WITNESS
[1:53:39] WITNESS THAT TO ME, I WOULD HAVE NEVER
[1:53:41] let you in." HE SAID, "BUT God
[1:53:46] Hallelujah.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; He looked at me AND HE SAID, "GOD KNOWS
[1:53:49] HOW TO DO HIS BUSINESS."
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I don't want you TO BE A KID
[1:53:57] TONIGHT. BUT LISTEN, YOU FIND YOUR
[1:53:59] PLACE.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT'S NOT TO BE A PREACHER. MAYBE
[1:54:04] IT'S NOT EVEN TO BE A SINGER.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not to DO A WHOLE LOT OF
[1:54:09] THINGS. BUT IF YOU FIND YOUR PURPOSE OF
[1:54:11] LIFE AND YOU BECOME a witness,
[1:54:15] and you BECOME A WITNESS OF A LIVING
[1:54:18] LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE A LIFE THAT COMES FORTH FROM
[1:54:24] YOU.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; But before you CAN BE A WITNESS, THERE'S
[1:54:27] GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE
[1:54:29] INSIDE of you.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; That this BOOK HAS BECOME A LIVING
[1:54:33] PERSON TO YOU.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN JUST BOOKS,
[1:54:37] QUOTES, AND TAPES.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; But it lives in life.
[1:54:45] I'm a young man. I'm a young lady. I'm
[1:54:49] not trained. He don't need you to be so
[1:54:51] trained.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Heard you heard a man today
[1:55:01] found his flesh.
[1:55:04] He said he preach
[1:55:10] a fine job of preaching
[1:55:14] with this job.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm a sister. I'm not a
[1:55:18] preacher. You do a fine job of preaching
[1:55:21] with your life.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; When you walk through Walmart, I'm sure
[1:55:28] you've got at least two here.
[1:55:32] When you walk through Walmart, you're a
[1:55:34] light to the entire world.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; They may hate just like just like they
[1:55:39] hated Joseph and they hated Jesus. They
[1:55:42] may literally hate the ground that you
[1:55:43] walk on and don't even know why.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; But you walk as a victory
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; that somebody's still living.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Because remember, WE'RE NOT HERE FOR
[1:55:54] VERY LONG.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; WE'RE PILGRIMS AND STRANGERS IN SEARCH
[1:56:00] OF THE CITY.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be HERE FOR MUCH
[1:56:02] LONGER. HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; WHY YOU SPEND SO MUCH ENERGY, BROTHER?
[1:56:06] LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE
[1:56:08] very much longer.
[1:56:11] I'm going TO SPEND EVERY MOMENT THAT I
[1:56:13] can Jesus Christ.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; When a RACER COMES ACROSS THE END OF THE
[1:56:20] race and he falls against AND HE'S IF HE
[1:56:23] HASN'T SPENT ALL of it, HE HE'S REALLY
[1:56:26] JUST WASTED IT.
[1:56:28] BUT WHEN HE'S GIVEN HIS ALL
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; AND HE FALLS ACROSS THAT FINISH LINE,
[1:56:33] YOU CAN SAY THAT man has given
[1:56:35] everything.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I pray when I fall into his arms
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; in a rapture in a grave, I FALL WITH NO
[1:56:43] ENERGY AT ALL IN my
[1:56:46] one.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, this message is for you.
[1:56:56] Joseph had his turn.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Whenever he was bowing to it,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; he was standing. He was revealing
[1:57:03] himself to his brethren. One day you
[1:57:05] will reveal yourself to the whole world.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY YOU'LL REVEAL YOURSELF TO THE
[1:57:14] WHOLE WORLD.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; I'm a PART OF THAT RAPTURE.
[1:57:23] YOU THOUGHT I wasn't. You thought I was
[1:57:26] a fanatic.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; But I want to
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; I'M THE CAUSE, THE PREDESTINATE,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to reveal. I WANT TO REVEAL
[1:57:40] TO YOU THE REAL JESUS CHRIST.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; You know, this is the first
[1:58:02] I really don't know my own purpose.
[1:58:10] I don't know. I just kind of drifted
[1:58:12] along and kind of banged against the
[1:58:14] rocks and banged against
[1:58:18] my own ambition.
[1:58:20] I've been my own greatest
[1:58:30] secret.
[1:58:48] You're not the only
[1:58:50] his father's
[1:58:58] control.
[1:59:32] I want to invite you.
[1:59:41] conversation.
[1:59:44] I want to ask you
[2:00:04] sort out your own direction.
[2:00:17] I want to serve his purpose, not my
[2:00:19] ambition.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Even my parents purpose.
[2:00:26] A lot of times parents live their lives
[2:00:28] through their children. This has to be
[2:00:30] personal to you.
[2:00:50] looking for supernatural things to
[2:00:51] happen.
[2:00:54] We're not necessarily looking for
[2:00:56] emotion,
[2:00:58] but we're looking for something that
[2:00:59] happens eternally.
[2:01:04] A preacher didn't lay his hands on me.
[2:01:07] There's a greater than a preacher in
[2:01:08] this
[2:01:12] greater than Solomon in this.
[2:01:17] He simply asked him to be the king of
[2:01:19] the control room of your heart.
[2:01:23] He's asking that can I be your guide?
[2:01:28] Can I be your direction?
[2:01:31] Can I spend a few moments with you in
[2:01:32] your day?
[2:01:36] Can I show you my word in a reality
[2:01:38] form?
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight
[2:01:44] you see every young man and every young
[2:01:46] lady that has walked to this altar
[2:01:47] tonight.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have invited you and you're
[2:01:55] here.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; These are your children.
[2:02:00] Maybe they've wandered and kind of lost
[2:02:03] their way a little bit.
[2:02:06] Maybe they sat on A PEW AND IT FELT LIKE
[2:02:08] THEY WERE JUST GOING THROUGH THE motions
[2:02:10] of it.
[2:02:12] But oh God, TONIGHT MAY WE GRAB A HOLD
[2:02:15] OF THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN THEIR LIFE.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And it's more than going to church.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; It's more than listening to a tape.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; It's more than just singing a song.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; But it becomes a living reality in our
[2:02:28] eyes.
[2:02:30] Oh, come rude over our soul tonight, oh
[2:02:32] God.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; May we step within the veil tonight. May
[2:02:37] this kind of glory of God just be like a
[2:02:40] column that comes down over top of us.
[2:02:42] Oh God,
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; may we just simply lose ourselves.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Oh God, YOU KNOW WHERE WE'VE BEEN.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE SITUATIONS in our lives.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND US.
[2:02:55] You know the dungeons that we've lived
[2:02:56] in. You know our private ambitions
[2:02:59] tonight. WE GIVE IT ALL TO you in the
[2:03:01] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; We want to serve this message in Christ
[2:03:06] with all of our hearts.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We want the significance of your word of
[2:03:11] your vision to become a living reality
[2:03:14] in our hearts.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God, COME FILL US NOW WITH YOUR
[2:03:18] PRESENCE. Oh Lord,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, you
[2:03:22] see this many people tonight. Oh, how
[2:03:25] they need you. Oh God, you made us a
[2:03:28] promise that you would come.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, won't you just move with us
[2:03:34] tonight?
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; We lay aside every weight and every sin
[2:03:37] that's just easily beset us and we're
[2:03:40] going to run like never before in our
[2:03:41] lives.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Forgive us, oh God. We need
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:57] Jesus Christ.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Won't you pray with your lips?
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Just my Jesus, come to me right where
[2:04:05] I'm at. You know my situation. You know
[2:04:09] my condition of your life.
[2:04:12] Oh God, would you just come now?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, hear my humble cry.
[2:04:28] Hallelujah.
[2:04:38] Hallelu
[2:04:47] Christ.
[2:04:58] Savior
[2:05:19] is thou.
[2:05:26] Oh,
[2:05:28] God.
[2:05:37] Say
[2:05:40] you are
[2:05:43] saveior
[2:05:49] my
[2:05:53] cry.
[2:06:03] The sound are
[2:06:12] the
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; We believed.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; We believe God has spoken.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many can testify that God
[2:06:27] has spoken to them?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Young people, how many could say God has
[2:06:32] spoken to them?
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Our dear brother Ron never realized what
[2:06:39] we did in junior camp.
[2:06:41] He didn't know we did two nights of
[2:06:43] Joseph
[2:06:45] and the Holy Spirit has come behind that
[2:06:48] to confirm
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; This is not the orchestration of man.
[2:06:55] This has been the orchestration of God.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; And saints of God, you should be
[2:07:00] spiritual enough that you can say, "God
[2:07:03] is doing something new."
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you tonight, if you are
[2:07:07] still in your prison,
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; if you are still in your prison,
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; the God that got Joseph out of that
[2:07:15] prison
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; is the same one that is here tonight.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And we need business tonight.
[2:07:24] You say, "Well, I haven't made a move."
[2:07:26] Make a move now.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Show God you mean business.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; This is God made. This is the Holy
[2:07:32] Ghost.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; And who wants to be loosed?
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Pass me, oh gentle
[2:07:40] God,
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; loose me
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; from myself.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; My worst enemy, myself." Yes,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; God is here tonight
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; to punctuate, to tell you that you're
[2:07:54] free tonight by the word of God.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And if you want to be free tonight and
[2:08:00] get that devil that has been driving you
[2:08:02] down off your back, why don't you reach
[2:08:05] out to him and say, "Pass me."
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; And I said, "God bless you."
[2:08:13] Maybe there's still another young person
[2:08:14] that says, "I'm going to make a move
[2:08:17] tonight. I'm going to make a move."
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, you made a move one night
[2:08:22] and God's done great things and he's
[2:08:25] willing to do more great things. Don't
[2:08:27] look around. Look up. You're redemption
[2:08:30] from God.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Who wants to be free tonight?
[2:08:39] He cried out, "Brother Brandon, free us
[2:08:41] from this house of hell. Free us from
[2:08:44] this prison house." He looked at his
[2:08:46] arms. He said, "I'm not strong enough.
[2:08:49] How will I do it?" Then that purifier
[2:08:52] said, "Say it in the name of Jesus
[2:08:55] Christ." And those bars started to pump.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Those walls gave way.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; We believe the prison bars are made
[2:09:05] loose tonight. The walls be ready in the
[2:09:09] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] Hallelujah.
[2:09:17] Ask me
[2:09:25] Lord. Hear me tonight.
[2:09:31] The halls are full. Don't look around.
[2:09:34] Look up.
[2:09:35] Look up to him.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; This
[2:09:45] is on the move. We're in the vision.
[2:09:49] We're in the vision. We see ourselves in
[2:09:51] the vision. We're free. According to the
[2:09:54] vision,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; we are liberated people. According to
[2:09:57] the vision,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; there are overcomes according to the
[2:10:02] vision today.
[2:10:14] Make a personal
[2:10:21] hear my humble
[2:10:27] cry.

[2:14:09] and praise
[2:14:13] my
[2:14:19] will

[2:14:25] name.
[2:14:29] Bless your name.
[2:14:34] I bless you again.
[2:14:39] I give you
[2:14:46] praise.
[2:14:50] for the
[2:14:54] blessings
[2:15:14] of God.
[2:15:28] Brothers and sisters, we're going to be
[2:15:32] here.
[2:15:34] Amen. If you create a prison in your
[2:15:36] mind, God is here to lose your mind.
[2:15:41] Reach up
[2:15:43] and believe
[2:15:45] God is going to set you free. Let's
[2:15:50] Jesus believe we're in the presence of
[2:15:55] the word of Goden.
[2:15:57] We believe the mind of God.
[2:16:00] We believe young people have been moved
[2:16:02] by the word of God. They found
[2:16:04] themselves in the vision. Lord, they see
[2:16:07] themselves in the word. They're chosen
[2:16:10] of this
[2:16:11] chosen elected
[2:16:15] by the word of God.
[2:16:18] Walking in the vision. Satan is
[2:16:21] defeated.

[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; The enemy.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; We got him under what tonight.
[2:16:32] For we know whom the sun sets free.
[2:16:37] Who that sun sets free.
[2:16:39] Whom the sun sets free. It is free
[2:16:43] indeed.
[2:16:45] The Lord is young people tonight. We
[2:16:47] lift up our voices and indeed say, "I'm
[2:16:50] free.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; I am free by the word of God."
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm free by the preaching of
[2:16:59] the word.
[2:17:09] We've been waiting for the breast to
[2:17:12] move out of service.
[2:17:14] service. We came building up and
[2:17:17] building up. But now the time has come
[2:17:19] and now is Lord God that we will stand
[2:17:23] in our position. Sons and daughters of
[2:17:26] God adopted in this last age.

[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; I take it tonight in the name of Jesus
[2:17:51] Christ.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; I got the devil on the run.

[2:43:09] in the blood that is
[2:43:14] from day
[2:43:16] to day.
[2:43:18] It will never
[2:43:22] lose
[2:43:23] his power.
[2:43:28] It will never
[2:43:31] lose
[2:43:33] his power.
[2:43:38] We will
[2:43:48] Hallelujah.
[2:43:51] Hallelujah.
[2:44:04] Thank you very much in prayer
[2:44:07] right from tonight
[2:44:09] through to the service starting time
[2:44:12] tomorrow.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; Let's set our minds and hearts on God.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; Let's be in a prayerful aptitude
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; atmosphere when you do that.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting incredible things.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how to describe what
[2:44:27] I'm expecting. Hallelujah. expecting
[2:44:29] great victories because I've already
[2:44:32] seen
[2:44:34] God has been moving behind the scenes.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; And people are getting miserable in
[2:44:40] their sinful life. People have been
[2:44:42] praying for you to see them here.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; I sat here on the platform and my mind
[2:44:54] was preoccupied.
[2:44:56] I look down into the audience of the
[2:45:00] young men and young ladies tonight and I
[2:45:03] remember last year,
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; right,
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; they were in a great struggle,
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; Last year, Satan was voting for their
[2:45:10] life.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Last year, Satan thought he had them,
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; but the the power of the enemy was
[2:45:16] broken and they're sitting here tonight.
[2:45:24] We ought to be rejoicing.
[2:45:27] Mothers and fathers and parents ought to
[2:45:29] be rejoicing.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; We prayed for this and now we see it.
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to take it for
[2:45:36] granted. We're going to give him glory.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; I look down in the audience and I see
[2:45:41] homes that were troubled. I've seen
[2:45:43] homes that were almost broken. And
[2:45:45] tonight, Satan's been defeated.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see young ladies that had
[2:45:55] a real struggle and they were rebellious
[2:45:58] against God. And I look down in this
[2:46:00] audience tonight and for the last year
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; or more, they've been living a surrender
[2:46:07] life to Jesus Christ. All it takes is
[2:46:10] give it all. I surrender all. Just say
[2:46:13] yes to the Lord and mean business and
[2:46:16] God will do the rest.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; You can't say, "Well, I'll try." That
[2:46:21] doesn't work. say, "I'll do it."
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; And then God will honor that.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; And look down in your faces. I'm glad
[2:46:38] you're here.
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; The very fact you aren't here is a
[2:46:41] testimony. Satan wasn't strong enough.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; He's what the prophet said. He was a
[2:46:47] block.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; He's a block.
[2:46:50] And you prove these are blood.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; And there's some others that's going to
[2:46:54] prove it, too.
[2:46:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Try to get a little bit
[2:47:01] of rest. It's hard after a night like
[2:47:04] this. Isn't this marvelous?
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends.
[2:47:08] I'm all done. I asked Brother Tom, when
[2:47:12] did God start to speak to you about
[2:47:14] Joseph?
[2:47:16] Many of you were not here. Monday night.
[2:47:19] I wasn't here, but I want to see it as
[2:47:22] soon as I can. And Tuesday night, Monday
[2:47:26] night, they put on a for the young
[2:47:29] children, the juniors. I wish everybody,
[2:47:34] it was, it was a marvelous, incredible
[2:47:39] presentation of Joseph.
[2:47:43] Joseph rejected of his brother.
[2:47:46] Joseph cast into a pit.
[2:47:50] screaming and crying
[2:47:53] at Hebra,
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; I don't hold this against you.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; Joseph going to the Piper's house and
[2:48:01] Piper on the platform.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Joseph stolen in the slave and in prison
[2:48:08] and Joseph going to the right hand of
[2:48:10] Pharaoh. He said two weeks two weeks
[2:48:13] before camp started the Holy Spirit
[2:48:17] spoke and said that's the subject I want
[2:48:20] you to know friends tonight almighty God
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; who put the stars in place and the
[2:48:26] planets in place and put all the animals
[2:48:28] on the earth that brother Brian was
[2:48:30] telling us about last night that God has
[2:48:33] come to this species
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; that God has got a plan and a program
[2:48:39] for your life and mine
[2:48:41] and he's already talked to brother Tom
[2:48:43] and got right on the theme. And here
[2:48:45] comes a man from 3,000 miles away says
[2:48:48] to turn to Genesis 37. We ought to be
[2:48:51] right away.
[2:48:53] &gt;&gt; We ought to say, "God, that's you.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; I may not understand it all, but I will
[2:48:58] accept. I will acknowledge and I will
[2:49:01] confess. That's nothing short of
[2:49:04] almighty God."
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; But miss the voice of God. Amen.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Without you, dismiss you in the name of
[2:49:13] the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you and
[2:49:15] said, I'm coming with great expect. I am
[2:49:18] coming.
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I'm coming. Great
[2:49:22] expectation. Tomorrow night, I'll be
[2:49:24] sitting on the edge of my seat as I was
[2:49:25] tonight to hear what God has for his
[2:49:28] mother. Amen. In Jesus name.
[2:50:25] This is victory
[2:50:28] from me.
[2:50:31] Thank you.
[2:50:44] to the highest
[2:50:47] mountain.
[2:51:09] Amen.
[2:51:29] All right. Praise God.
