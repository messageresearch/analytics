[1:53] [music]
[1:59] [music]

[2:26] is love like this.
[2:30] [singing]
[2:32] Hallelujah.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Happy Father's Day.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; The great father in [music] heaven sent
[2:38] his own son.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; So that we could have a Father's Day
[2:41] [music]
[2:42] and rejoice together. God bless you this
[2:44] morning. We want to go right to prayer.
[2:46] If the deacons [music]
[2:47] wouldn't mind coming, preparing to
[2:50] receive the offering and the tithes
[2:51] [music] this morning. The lovely Lord
[2:53] Jesus has prepared a pastor, prepared a
[2:57] heart so that we could have a church
[2:59] like this [music] this morning. [snorts]
[3:02] Many sacrifices we don't necessarily see
[3:05] that have gone on over the years. We
[3:07] think [music] about the Bible
[3:08] translation, the Chinese Bible,
[3:11] all the sacrifices [music] that have
[3:13] gone in to make print media available
[3:14] for us.
[3:17] [music] Amen. so that our hearts could
[3:19] be changed, be turned, receive a
[3:21] prophet's message to be good prepared
[3:24] [music] ground. Isn't that nice this
[3:26] morning? Amen. Let's agree together.
[3:28] [music] We do want to remember the Carol
[3:30] family. Brother Jeremy is suffering with
[3:32] the kidney stone this morning. Just
[3:34] asking that the Lord would touch him
[3:36] [music]
[3:36] this morning as we bow our hearts and
[3:38] heads. Heavenly Father, as we approach
[3:40] the throne of grace this [music]
[3:41] morning,
[3:44] what a sacrifice.
[3:46] What a word that you have sent, [music]
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Lord. You prepared a prophet for us
[3:52] today so that we could receive your word
[3:54] so that we could walk in the light of
[3:56] the hour that would literally change our
[3:59] mortal bodies [music] as we stand this
[4:01] morning.
[4:03] Lord, would you come by our way this
[4:05] morning? Anoint our pastor, Lord,
[4:08] Brother [music] Ed Biscll, a man of God
[4:11] whom you have placed your hand upon his
[4:13] [music] life. Would you minister through
[4:15] him to the needy people this morning?
[4:18] Each one of us need more of you this
[4:20] [music] morning as the songwriter wrote
[4:21] more and more of Jesus. Lord, we long to
[4:25] see [music] you this morning in the
[4:26] opening of your word. Lord, lives need
[4:29] to be touched. Souls [music] need to be
[4:31] one for the kingdom. We just want to put
[4:34] our shoulder to the wheel as it were
[4:35] this morning, Lord. We just want to do
[4:37] our little part. All that we can do,
[4:40] Lord, we want to do for you. [music]
[4:42] Lord, we pray a blessing upon the
[4:44] officers of the church. We look around
[4:46] the room and we [music] see faithful
[4:47] trustees and deacons, Lord, at their
[4:49] post of duty, the congregation, the
[4:52] ministry. [music] Lord, all things are
[4:54] placed in their order. And we pray,
[4:56] Lord, that you would now come and cap
[4:58] [music] off this meeting this morning.
[5:00] There will be a baby dedication and
[5:02] special sung, the ministering of your
[5:04] word. We give you all the praise, all
[5:07] the glory, and the honor. Touch Brother
[5:09] Jeremy this morning, Lord. [music]
[5:12] Lord, he has a need in his body. Would
[5:14] the angel of the Lord so minister to him
[5:16] this morning, grant him quick relief, we
[5:19] pray, [music]
[5:20] committing this service to you, all
[5:22] things that will be said and done to the
[5:24] glory of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ.
[5:26] Amen. And amen. As you have your seats
[5:29] this morning,
[5:31] let's sing Just a Closer [music] Walk
[5:34] with Jesus. Just a Closer Walk. We do
[5:36] want to remember

[5:43] convocation ceremony at 6 pm on Friday
[5:47] [music] at the BCA gym. All are invited

[6:08] time, [music] but uh you can speak with
[6:10] brother Matthew or uh anyone at the
[6:12] office and they'll know what times to
[6:14] appoint for that. Amen. We're going to
[6:17] have [music] the baby dedication just
[6:19] after just as we sing this song. We'll
[6:21] ask [music] uh Treasure and Meline Kanga
[6:25] to come. Be ready for the baby
[6:27] dedication. Brother [music] Tom will be
[6:28] taking that this morning. Praise the
[6:30] Lord. It's good to be in the house of
[6:32] the Lord this morning. Let's [music]
[6:33] sing this chorus together. We'll start
[6:35] with the first verse.
[6:39] I [singing]
[6:41] weak but thou
[6:44] strong.
[6:48] Jesus [music and singing]
[6:51] keep me wrong. [music]
[6:56] Will you be satisfied?
[6:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[6:58] &gt;&gt; I
[7:00] will be satisfied
[7:03] as long [singing] as I want.
[7:07] As [music] I walk, let me walk
[7:12] close to thee. [music]
[7:16] [singing]
[7:17] For it's just
[7:20] just a closer one with the
[7:24] friend Jesus.
[7:28] [music]
[7:30] Jesus [singing]
[7:32] is my
[7:33] [music]
[7:35] [singing]
[7:38] daily
[7:40] walking [music and singing]
[7:41] close to thee.
[7:46] [music] Let me
[7:49] dear you Lord. Take [singing] me

[9:12] not [music] leave our little ones
[9:13] behind.
[9:15] Amen. and his treasure maline [music]
[9:18] make their way up. We'll sing this
[9:20] together. A few Sunday school children
[9:21] are coming in. We'll invite brother Tom
[9:23] to come [music] as we sing this.
[9:26] We'll not [singing] leave our little one
[9:28] behind
[9:31] [music]
[9:32] for [singing] our heart.
[9:35] [music]
[9:39] [singing]
[9:41] [music]
[9:46] [music]
[9:47] Heat. Heat.
[9:52] [music]
[9:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[9:59] [singing]
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Sorry, [music]
[10:06] sorry.
[10:10] [music]
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. These are special part of
[10:19] the meetings. This is the future church
[10:21] if the Lord should terry. and brother
[10:24] Treasure and Sister Maline Kapunga, they
[10:27] have their children in their arms that
[10:29] God has blessed them with.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; And you never know when these blessings
[10:32] come. [clears throat]
[10:33] &gt;&gt; You know, you have plans and you have
[10:35] things that you've got in mind and and
[10:37] God has plans.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; And God has given them this uh blessed
[10:42] son, Danell Kapanga, a gift from God.
[10:47] And he's a bruiser.
[10:49] I picked him up the other day and and I
[10:52] said, I I'd want if I had a football
[10:53] team, he would be on my team.
[10:57] But God's gifts come in various
[10:59] packages.
[11:01] And every gift and every good gift, the
[11:03] Bible says in 1 John 2:14 or I'm sorry,
[11:07] James 1:17, every good gift and every
[11:11] perfect gift
[11:14] is from above and comes from the Father
[11:16] of light. And so we're looking at a
[11:20] perfect gift.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Treasure, Sister Meline,
[11:23] &gt;&gt; not just a gift, but a perfect gift in
[11:26] God's eyes.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; And we understand through things that
[11:30] are to be that the that lineage that
[11:32] comes from our heavenly father is a gift
[11:37] of God. And that is a gene that God put
[11:40] there. And God brought two a couple
[11:43] together to have this son in the mind of
[11:46] God. And it'll go back to the very mind
[11:48] of God, brother Taser and Sister Meline.
[11:52] And I so I looked at, you know, every
[11:54] time Brother Bram says the gifts of God,
[11:57] every gift, every good gift. He says it
[11:59] about 165 times.
[12:02] So there's many great gifts from God.
[12:05] Many great gifts. He said healing is a
[12:08] good a great gift from God. Perfect
[12:10] gift. And he talked about salvation.
[12:13] Then he ends off and he says,"Oh God,
[12:16] author of life, giver of every good
[12:18] gift, send your peace." And I thought
[12:22] about what you said, brother T. A peace
[12:24] of God came down on the family. And that
[12:26] was a gift that God gave you.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; A peace to raise this child for the
[12:32] glory of God. Then he says, "Oh eternal
[12:35] author of life, giver of every good
[12:37] gift, send thy blessing upon this little
[12:40] child." I said how perfect for this baby
[12:44] dedication that God has given you a gift
[12:47] and then he said the greatest gift is
[12:49] the gift of eternal life.
[12:52] So this young man means uh Danielle
[12:55] means gift of God, but it also branches
[12:59] out and there's another part and it it
[13:02] branches out into God's judgment
[13:06] and not to judge as in a judgment of of
[13:10] of
[13:11] uh to judge or cause hurt. It is judge
[13:17] right from wrong.
[13:19] So may this son have this anointing of a
[13:23] gift from God. Right's right. Wrong's
[13:26] wrong. Because we're living in an age
[13:29] that's a pale age, a gray area age. But
[13:33] this son has been given a gift to judge.
[13:37] To judge what's right and what's wrong.
[13:40] And that goes all the way into Samson
[13:43] and how he judged Israel. And then it
[13:46] goes into Daniel. And it just goes all
[13:48] through the scriptures. So may that
[13:50] judgment of God to know what's right,
[13:54] what's wrong, to judge. I want this God
[13:57] of mother and father. May God's blessing
[14:01] be upon this beautiful son that God's
[14:04] given.
[14:11] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[14:16] Precious Lord,
[14:20] it's so true, Father, that
[14:23] these gifts that you give us
[14:26] are perfect gifts.
[14:28] And Lord, this couple has walked with
[14:31] you along life's road, you've brought
[14:33] them together. You've given them two
[14:36] boys
[14:38] to raise in the presence and the glory
[14:40] of God. May you grant them wisdom and
[14:44] leadership, Lord, in the days that lay
[14:47] ahead and the peace that came down upon
[14:50] brother Treasure at this time of knowing
[14:53] of this child coming. I pray the peace
[14:56] of God upon Danielle and pray that you
[14:59] will bless him and may the glory of God
[15:02] that has given him life give him the
[15:05] greatest gift of eternal life. Bless
[15:08] this child. May he be a blessing to the
[15:12] home, Lord, mother and father. May Jesus
[15:16] be awakened to him early in life. And
[15:19] may he be pleasing in your sight. And
[15:22] may the grace of God ever abide upon his
[15:25] heart, Lord, that he would walk in the
[15:28] very glory of your presence. We dedicate
[15:31] this son to you this morning for your
[15:34] glory. Bless this child in Jesus' name.
[15:39] Amen.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Right at home.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you, honey.
[16:00] along this morning. Not that this is a
[16:02] good announcement.
[16:04] It's to do with our precious sister
[16:07] Jenny. Where is she sitting this
[16:09] morning? Is she here?
[16:12] She's at the school.
[16:15] Okay. Well, her mom and dad are here and
[16:18] they're here for a reason. And I told
[16:20] them I told Sister Connie she's a thief.
[16:25] I meant that in a very good way. And I
[16:28] said, ' Because whenever a thief comes,
[16:30] he doesn't steal the cheap stuff. They
[16:34] always come to steal the important
[16:36] things, things that are of value.
[16:38] Brother Ken, we valued your daughter. We
[16:42] value her highly and we're thankful for
[16:44] the years that you have given her to us
[16:48] and uh you've raised a wonderful

[16:55] 4:00 for the church, a going away for
[16:58] Sister Jenny Leonard. And uh I know your
[17:03] presence would be appreciated. We just
[17:05] want to tell her individually, like
[17:07] brother Biskoff often said, don't give
[17:08] your life story, but just tell her how
[17:10] much she meant uh to you and this this
[17:13] assembly. So, everybody's invited be in
[17:16] the fellowship room and it'll be a
[17:18] wonderful afternoon. So that will be
[17:20] next Sunday at 4:00 June 23rd for our

[17:27] God bless you.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Biscal sisters are going to
[17:34] come and sing for us this morning just
[17:36] as Brother Ed's preparing to come out.
[17:38] So why don't they come and get ready at
[17:40] this time? We'll sing together uh 869

[17:49] Amen.
[17:54] Christ the transforming [music]
[17:58] [singing] life.
[18:00] [music]
[18:01] It touches his heart [singing]
[18:05] of mind.
[18:09] [music] You sing the darkest [singing]
[18:13] night [music]
[18:16] making [singing]
[18:18] his glory
[18:20] shine.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, to reflect
[18:27] his grace, [music]
[18:32] causing [singing]
[18:33] the world
[18:35] to see. [music]
[18:38] [singing]
[18:39] The will
[18:43] [music]
[18:45] shall [singing] go.
[18:48] Jesus revealed [music and singing]
[18:51] in me
[18:55] here Lord [music and singing]
[18:57] I bring my heart
[19:03] my [music] love my strength I will
[19:06] [singing]
[19:09] [music]
[19:10] praise me in every
[19:14] [singing]
[19:18] with all [music]
[19:19] my spirit. [singing]
[19:25] [music] Oh, to reflect
[19:28] his [singing] grace, [music]

[19:34] the world to see.
[19:39] [music and singing]
[19:41] Love that will
[19:45] till others [music] shall know.
[19:47] [singing]
[19:50] Jesus
[19:51] revealed [music]
[19:53] in me.
[19:58] [music]
[20:29] There's [singing]
[20:30] something
[20:32] that's different
[20:35] about [singing and music] him.
[20:40] For his [singing and music] voice has
[20:42] calmed the angry
[20:45] raging sea.
[20:50] There's [singing]
[20:51] something
[20:53] that's different [music]
[20:55] about [singing] him.
[21:00] for his touch has changed [music] a
[21:03] sinful [singing]
[21:05] wretch like me.
[21:10] And although [singing and music]
[21:12] I can't explain,
[21:14] God's life's been different since he
[21:18] came, [music] there's something
[21:21] different [singing]
[21:22] about the one whose name is Jesus.
[21:27] [music]
[21:30] Some say he's [music and singing] just
[21:34] another but or his head rest the
[21:38] [singing and music] star
[21:40] that guided
[21:43] lowly shepherds [music]
[21:45] and [singing] wise men from afar.
[21:48] [music]
[21:50] And though [singing] he was just [music]
[21:53] a child,
[21:55] he amazed [singing]
[21:57] all the crowd. And in the temple,
[22:01] [singing and music]
[22:03] you could hear the people say,
[22:10] "There's something
[22:13] that's [singing] different [music]
[22:16] about him.
[22:20] For [singing and music] his voice has
[22:23] calmed the angry [singing and music]
[22:25] raging sea.
[22:30] There's [singing]
[22:31] something
[22:33] that's different [music]
[22:36] about him.
[22:40] for his touch [music]
[22:42] has [singing] changed a sinful
[22:45] wretch like me.
[22:48] [music]
[22:50] And [singing] although
[22:52] I can't explain,
[22:54] my life's [music] been different since
[22:58] he [singing] came, there's something
[23:00] [music] different about the [singing]
[23:03] one whose name is [music] Jesus.
[23:10] Some [singing] say [music] he's just a
[23:13] prophet.
[23:15] Others say he's just [music] a man.
[23:20] Some say he's just a [singing and music]
[23:23] teacher
[23:25] doing good throughout
[23:28] [singing and music] the land. But those
[23:31] who heard the [music] master say,
[23:35] "Peace be still. One [music and singing]
[23:38] stormy day turned to the others and you
[23:43] could [singing] hear them say
[23:50] there's [singing] something
[23:53] that's different
[23:56] about [music]
[23:57] him.
[24:00] For his [singing and music] voice has
[24:02] calmed the angry
[24:05] raging [singing]
[24:06] sea.
[24:08] [music]
[24:10] There's [singing]
[24:10] something
[24:12] that's different [music]
[24:15] about [singing] him.
[24:19] For his touch [music] has changed
[24:22] [singing] a sin for wretch like me.
[24:27] [singing]
[24:29] And although
[24:31] I [music] can't explain,
[24:34] my life's been different
[24:37] since he came, [music] there's [singing]
[24:39] something different about the one whose
[24:45] name is [singing] Jesus.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[24:50] &gt;&gt; And although
[24:52] I can't explain,
[24:54] [music]
[24:55] life's been different
[24:57] since he came. There's something
[25:01] different [music] about [singing] the
[25:03] one whose name is Jesus.
[25:08] [singing]
[25:13] Jesus. [singing]
[25:18] Jesus, [singing]
[25:23] he [singing and music] means all
[25:25] the world
[25:28] to me.
[25:32] [singing]
[25:34] Jesus,
[25:37] [singing]
[25:39] Jesus,
[25:44] where [singing] do
[25:49] I be? [singing and music]
[25:54] [music]
[25:56] Without [singing] Jesus,
[26:00] where [music] would
[26:02] [singing] I be?
[26:13] [applause]
[26:31] I have this. Is this on? Okay.
[26:36] Without Jesus, where would we be?
[26:39] Amen.
[26:40] Well, uh, this is Father's Day,
[26:43] apparently, and I didn't know it was
[26:45] going to be Father's Day. I just did it
[26:48] as a matter of uh duty and I think uh I
[26:52] wanted to wait until brother Tom and
[26:55] everyone was home. So uh here we are.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Glad everyone is here.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; And uh we want to make an announcement
[27:10] for our brother Nathan Wymer.
[27:14] And uh uh they were ready, but I wasn't
[27:17] ready on Wednesday.
[27:22] You know, you're always ready when
[27:23] you're going to get married,
[27:26] but not everyone else is ready.
[27:29] [laughter]
[27:32] So on on Sunday, June the 12th, which
[27:36] was this last week,
[27:39] uh I met with brother Nathan and Sister
[27:44] Charity McGary
[27:47] and uh they were engaged last Tuesday or
[27:51] was it Monday?
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Monday. [laughter]
[27:55] See, I was testing you out whether you
[27:57] knew it when it happened.
[28:02] Uh, Sister Charity is the daughter of
[28:04] Brother Dennis McGary. [snorts]
[28:07] Uh, and Sister Dennis, Brother Dennis
[28:10] and Sister Dennis McGary of Flagstaff,
[28:14] Arizona.
[28:16] I spoke with the couple Wednesday, June
[28:19] the 12th, but was unable unable to make
[28:23] the announcement at that time. And so I
[28:27] think we have a a scene up here
[28:32] that's too beautiful for Arizona.
[28:37] It's too green for Arizona, isn't it?
[28:40] Anyhow, I think they will be looking
[28:43] forward to a wedding date towards mid uh
[28:48] July next month. And if possible, if it
[28:53] works out, uh we we'd like to be there.
[28:58] Uh
[29:00] I will say more about uh the
[29:04] church and our calling and
[29:07] responsibilities as we go along. I have
[29:10] also I received an email and I receive
[29:15] them quite frequently. Actually, this is
[29:18] a a testimony and I'm not going to read
[29:21] it all because
[29:24] uh of the time constraint, but it's from
[29:28] a a brother and he didn't tell me who he
[29:31] was other than his name. And he
[29:35] apparently knows
[29:38] uh Colin, Sister Natasha Hoyer's
[29:42] brother.
[29:44] uh he knows him and it turned out that
[29:48] this brother is the son-in-law of a
[29:51] pastor in North Carolina
[29:55] and they're just a few lines of his
[29:58] testimony which I will
[30:01] he said that
[30:04] I was hit with multiple cerosis
[30:08] uh which I was in a wheelchair for
[30:11] several years.
[30:13] They had me on shots and lots of
[30:16] medication each and every day.
[30:20] Well, he said the years went by.
[30:23] I never got any calls from the preachers
[30:27] I knew and fellowshipped with. No
[30:31] encouragement or comfort from anyone.
[30:34] You know, God will do that. He lets
[30:36] people get down
[30:38] uh alone and no one ever even called me
[30:42] to pray for me.
[30:45] Uh he said, "The devil said, "See,
[30:48] nobody cares for you." Didn't the devil
[30:51] say that once before?
[30:53] &gt;&gt; He said that quite a few times. I think
[30:55] probably said it to you.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Uh no one called or prayed for me. No
[31:01] one cares for you. Nobody loves you. Why
[31:05] don't you just kill yourself?
[31:07] If you've ever heard that,
[31:09] &gt;&gt; you know where it comes from.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[31:13] Uh he said, "Why why don't you just
[31:15] quit?"
[31:17] Well, I got depressed.
[31:19] That's a good way to get depressed. We
[31:22] are poor and no help from anywhere.
[31:26] I didn't understand all this that's
[31:29] happening to me. my wife having to do
[31:33] everything I should be doing. I wanted
[31:36] to end it all, but I couldn't.
[31:40] But at that desperate moment, I wanted
[31:44] to end my life.
[31:46] Something happened.
[31:48] Something came over me and I tried to
[31:52] stand up.
[31:55] When I did, I got up. From that moment
[31:59] till now, it's been 2 or 3 years and
[32:03] I've been made whole. Hallelujah.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; And I can walk
[32:08] I walk five miles.
[32:10] I can walk five miles. Praise almighty
[32:14] God.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; That's something. [applause]
[32:20] Amen. [applause]
[32:22] Praise the Lord.
[32:26] So God can come to a person at a very
[32:28] desperate time.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "My wife's testimony
[32:34] uh she was a nurse."
[32:36] And then he said, "I received a call one
[32:39] evening. It was my wife calling me. She
[32:43] is a nurse." Well, I said hello and all
[32:47] I could hear was ug
[32:51] that's all he could hear on the phone.
[32:54] He said I asked what's the matter and uh
[32:58] there was no response just uh uh uh and
[33:02] it's all she could say. So my daughter
[33:04] lived near
[33:06] where she worked.
[33:08] So I told her to go and find uh find out
[33:12] what is h what is happening? Is
[33:15] something wrong? Well, my daughter got
[33:18] me on the phone. My wife was in a room
[33:21] there and couldn't get out
[33:26] and she couldn't remember anything.
[33:29] still uh not sure but knowing something
[33:33] was wrong, my wife miraculously drove
[33:37] home with my daughter in the car and she
[33:41] was she was actually having a stroke
[33:43] having a series of strokes
[33:47] and he said, "My wife miraculously drove
[33:50] home with my daughter in the car. At
[33:53] first I thought, well, everything must
[33:56] not be so bad."
[33:58] But when she came in, she didn't know me
[34:03] or anyone and she could not speak at
[34:06] all. So I called 911 emergency service.
[34:11] They arrived here, found out she had had
[34:14] a stroke. So they rushed her to the
[34:17] hospital
[34:19] to the stroke specialist. I arrived soon
[34:23] after where they found out that her main
[34:27] artery in her neck had tore open and she
[34:33] had several strokes,
[34:36] had a blood clot on her brain
[34:39] and uh on the thinking side.
[34:43] That's pretty hopeless, isn't it?
[34:50] He says that they asked me
[34:54] uh what did I want to do?
[34:57] Well, to give her blood
[35:00] uh clot uh to give her blood clot buster
[35:04] uh medicine or surgery. And he didn't
[35:07] know what to do. He said, uh, it had to
[35:11] be within no more than two hours from
[35:14] the time of the stroke.
[35:18] And I couldn't determine the time
[35:20] because no one had been with her at the
[35:24] time.
[35:27] And so they knew that uh nothing
[35:30] anything was wrong. They didn't know
[35:32] anything was wrong because she was in a
[35:34] room by herself and couldn't get out.
[35:39] She was still having strokes and went
[35:42] completely out. I found out
[35:46] that uh
[35:49] I found out she had been struck there at
[35:52] work
[35:54] all and and all
[35:58] and all time. You have to excuse me
[36:00] because he's kind of broken up in his
[36:02] language. and all time combined she was
[36:06] 4 to 5 hours before she got uh to the
[36:10] Moses Cone Hospital.
[36:14] They said after a few hours thousands of
[36:17] brain cells die
[36:20] she could not have any thinking after
[36:22] that. They said she had 1% chance to
[36:26] live. 1% chance.
[36:30] I think that's what God likes is 1%.
[36:35] She would be brain damaged.
[36:39] Well, I was in shock. I had planned to
[36:43] never go back home.
[36:45] How was I to live with without her? My
[36:50] parents had done gone.
[36:52] He says, I met and the reason he's
[36:54] writing is he was here in the log church
[36:58] and I do not remember him at all.
[37:03] So he's just writing he felt to write us
[37:06] and give us this testimony
[37:10] and he said that uh
[37:13] I was homeless as a young boy. He was
[37:16] homeless and almost starved to death. He
[37:20] said he was less than 120bs.
[37:25] Uh
[37:26] he said he he he he wanted to know if
[37:29] there was some place he could find a
[37:31] real true where he could feel being
[37:35] loved by someone. That's something for a
[37:38] man to be
[37:40] uh a full-g grown man and wonder if
[37:43] there's any place or anybody that can
[37:46] actually care for him and love a person.
[37:50] And uh and now here was his wife
[37:54] [snorts]
[37:54] uh is with 1% chance to live. They'd
[37:59] been married 42 years. He was in the log
[38:02] church in Cloverdale in 19
[38:06] pre977.
[38:09] So I can I cannot put a face to his name
[38:14] and I don't want to give his name over
[38:16] the internet
[38:19] thinking that when no one would give me
[38:21] the time of the day while I was homeless
[38:24] half starved to death 120 pounds. I went
[38:28] to the church as the songs were sung
[38:33] and I felt something different. I looked
[38:37] at the signs on the wall that read,
[38:41] "When love projects,
[38:43] grace takes over."
[38:47] And that's what he saw on the wall of
[38:50] this church.
[38:51] And uh and something was burning in my
[38:56] heart. I began to cry. I looked around
[39:00] and as the message was being preached I
[39:04] heard the name brother William Br Marian
[39:07] Brham.
[39:08] Something jumped in my heart as the
[39:12] service continued. I and then he he saw
[39:16] this girl and that became his wife.
[39:20] First he said I had never dated in his
[39:22] life. He'd been on the streets and he
[39:25] married this girl and had been married
[39:28] at 42 years
[39:30] when he wrote this letter last night. I
[39:33] got it.
[39:35] I would like to say to you
[39:38] because he ends he ends this testimony.
[39:45] He said, "So here she came back to
[39:48] recovery.
[39:51] Within a couple of hours she was laying
[39:54] there, had her cell phone in her hand.
[39:59] That's a woman. She'd have a cell phone
[40:02] in her hand.
[40:06] And she knew me.
[40:08] She was in her right mind."
[40:11] Didn't we hear that in the scripture?
[40:14] She was in her right mind. And now just
[40:17] a few months ago,
[40:20] dying, no hope, lost everything, our
[40:24] home to buy her life, everything
[40:28] at risk. God restored her to me.
[40:33] I thank
[40:35] &gt;&gt; I thank him so much. words cannot find
[40:40] to express
[40:43] uh to God for his promise.
[40:46] We we lost our home but we got what
[40:51] money could not buy.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; She is normal again and released to
[40:58] work.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[41:02] A man was in a wheelchair
[41:05] [applause]
[41:06] and he thought just I'll stand up.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And he stands up.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And by the time he wrote this or he's
[41:12] walking five miles a day,
[41:15] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Anybody [clears throat] that thinks
[41:21] God's not supernatural, God is
[41:23] supernatural.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Does he need people? Do you have to be
[41:27] up and be even prayed for? No. You have
[41:30] to just believe the word.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; And nobody was there to help him stand
[41:34] up. Said, "Stand up." So he stood up
[41:38] &gt;&gt; and then he tried to walk and he could
[41:40] walk.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; And then he calls his wife and she's in
[41:44] the midst of having strokes and can't
[41:47] even talk to him. And when he gets to
[41:49] the room, she doesn't know him and can't
[41:51] remember anything. And the brain is
[41:54] destroyed. Think of it. God recreated
[41:58] these things. I say this is the God we
[42:02] serve. This is a God I believe in.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And he said at the end he said
[42:09] that brother Colin that is Sister
[42:11] Natasha's brother is going to have a
[42:14] benefit service to help us with hospital
[42:18] bills and all that goes with it. I thank
[42:22] God, Brother Ed. I love him with all my
[42:26] heart and mind and soul.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Love you and your church. And I thought
[42:33] that I needed to read that. Here's a man
[42:36] you can't even remember.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; And this is what he's just gone through.
[42:39] This has just happened. And I love you
[42:42] with all my heart and soul.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; It's God supernatural has to do
[42:49] something.
[42:51] And he says, "And uh thank God, Brother
[42:55] Ed, I love him with all my heart and
[42:58] mind and soul. I love you and your
[43:01] church people. We stream some and enjoy
[43:06] so much. Brother Ed, I want to I want
[43:10] you to forgive me. I'm sorry. I didn't
[43:14] realize when I was there how precious it
[43:18] was. God gave me a gift to come there. I
[43:22] was lonely and discouraged, nervous,
[43:27] uh afraid,
[43:29] but your words and the love was
[43:33] uh has stuck with me all these years.
[43:40] You might be sitting here today
[43:43] &gt;&gt; and you'll find that God's going to
[43:45] strike your [snorts] soul
[43:47] &gt;&gt; and you'll never get away from it.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You can try to get away from it and you
[43:52] can move geographically across the
[43:54] nation, but if it's God that does it,
[43:57] then you can never get away from it.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; You'll always remember the atmosphere
[44:03] cuz we don't create the atmosphere. It's
[44:05] him.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. And all these years now
[44:13] I'm 62 now. And you said simply preach
[44:18] the message. God will do the rest. And
[44:22] and he has.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; And my my message to you is the same
[44:30] today as it was 62 or when he was 62. He
[44:34] said he's 62 now. So all these years
[44:36] ago, it's the same thing. Stay with the
[44:40] message.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been hearing. Just
[44:43] preach and testify the message and God
[44:46] will do the rest.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Did he do the rest? He stood up. Did he
[44:51] do the rest? He walked.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; His wife has a brain destroyed and her
[44:57] memory gone and 1% chance to live and
[45:01] she's back to nursing.
[45:04] I say praise be to God.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your love and kindness you
[45:10] showed me. God bless. I had I have to
[45:13] leave out quite a bit detail but I
[45:17] wanted you to know.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now now you know.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; It pays to get to be 50. Brother
[45:28] Matthew, Brother Matthew Redell turned
[45:31] 50 years old. Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; So I said that just gliding on in now.
[45:41] You that aren't 50 yet, you got a little
[45:43] bit of climbing to do. You'll climb a
[45:46] little bit higher. Well, you came not
[45:49] just to hear me, but to We'll read some
[45:53] scripture as well.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that all right? Would you like
[45:56] to stand?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ryan. And we'll have
[46:00] you uh
[46:03] we'll dismiss the musicians in just a
[46:05] few moments,
[46:07] but I'd like to read in the scripture.
[46:11] And if you wish to turn to First John
[46:16] chapter 2
[46:18] verses 12, 13, and 14.
[46:24] 1 John
[46:27] chapter 2.
[46:31] Let's have prayer.
[46:35] Heavenly Father, you are our father.
[46:38] And we want to say as a congregation,
[46:43] everyone's heart being knit together in
[46:48] one voice. Now I say in prayer, thy will
[46:52] be done.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Touch every heart that you would touch,
[46:56] oh God.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Let them know that you are present. Let
[47:01] your presence be felt. Let your power be
[47:05] manifest. Lord, the one that's bound,
[47:09] set them free
[47:11] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you
[47:14] cannot hold God's people.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot hold them.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; We declare deliverance from them
[47:22] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; With no effort on our part, it's all his
[47:28] part.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; You're the one that healed our brother
[47:31] Vince. Oh God,
[47:33] &gt;&gt; you're the one that caused him to walk.
[47:35] We thank you for the strength you gave
[47:37] to his legs. We thank you for what you
[47:40] have done for his wife. We want to give
[47:42] you praise.
[47:45] You're worthy of all glory.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Your prophet has said a doctor may cut
[47:51] out the bad part, but God will do the
[47:54] healing. And sometimes, oh God, there's
[47:57] a supernatural miracle on your part, and
[48:02] no doctor is needed. Oh, we thank you,
[48:05] Father.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; We thank you, oh God. We thank you for
[48:10] all that you have given us and
[48:12] contributed to your people. And now here
[48:15] we are. And on this Father's Day, we ask
[48:18] your blessing upon every father. And you
[48:21] are a father.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; You know about caring for the people.
[48:26] You know about the spiritual leadership
[48:28] in the home. And we pray oh God that our
[48:32] homes will be according to your word.
[48:35] Lord Jesus, let our parents be according
[48:38] to your word. Let our young men and
[48:41] young ladies be according to your word.
[48:44] May our children, oh God, be according
[48:46] to your word. And our school teachers
[48:49] and Sunday school teachers and all that
[48:52] have a responsibility, let it be
[48:54] according to your word. We have
[48:56] trustees. Father, we pray your blessing
[48:59] upon each trustee, upon our deacons, oh
[49:03] God, each one of them, upon our
[49:06] ministers, oh God. Anoint them mightily
[49:09] with the Holy Ghost. And when they open
[49:12] their mouth, Father, may it be just
[49:15] nothing short of sheep food, food for
[49:19] the sheep, oh God, we pray that you will
[49:22] give them utterance of the Holy Spirit
[49:25] in Jesus name. Help us this morning we
[49:28] pray and this day we ask that your grace
[49:32] will be upon our lives in Jesus name.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll read now 1 John 2. I write
[49:42] unto you little children,
[49:46] the little children.
[49:48] Are you here?
[49:50] Yes.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; I write unto you little children because
[49:54] your sins are forgiven you for his
[49:58] name's sake.
[50:01] I write unto you little children
[50:04] because your sins are forgiven you
[50:07] &gt;&gt; for his name's sake.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Aren't those wonderful words?
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Can you buy that down at the drugstore?
[50:15] Never.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; You can never hear that. You can s you
[50:19] could go in and say, "I'd like to buy a
[50:22] a pound of my sins are forgiven." They
[50:25] would look at you stunned because they
[50:27] don't know what to do with that. But
[50:29] here we just read it. I want you to
[50:32] really appreciate it. And incidentally,
[50:35] as we go through the message today, you
[50:38] may want a little booklet to put down.
[50:42] And I would like you to put down the
[50:44] scriptures that we read and the
[50:47] questions that you might have and the
[50:50] various scriptures and various places
[50:52] and the various quotes. You may want to
[50:55] you can just raise your hand when you
[50:56] see a deacon go by and we have these
[50:59] little books so you can just write the
[51:01] scriptures down or write your thoughts
[51:04] down and you will need it.
[51:09] I write unto you little children because
[51:11] your sins are forgiven you for his
[51:15] name's sake. I write unto you fathers.
[51:19] This was father's day so I thought it
[51:22] would be good. I write unto you fathers.
[51:24] John says because you have known him
[51:28] that is from the beginning. I write unto
[51:31] you young men because your you have
[51:35] overcome the wicked one.
[51:38] I write unto you little children because
[51:42] you have known the father. I write I
[51:45] have written unto you fathers because
[51:48] you have known him that is from the
[51:51] beginning.
[51:53] I have written unto you,
[51:56] young man, because you are strong and
[52:01] the word of God abideth in you and you
[52:04] have overcome the wicked one. Amen. You
[52:08] may be seated.
[52:19] Is that Tyler beside you, brother Mark?
[52:21] Tyler, would you stand up for a second?
[52:26] Tyler's 18 years old or going to be?
[52:30] You're going to be in a day or two?
[52:33] Tyler and his do and his sister went to
[52:37] Africa and were with uh brother
[52:43] who was here.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Jim Jones. Jim. No, not not Jim.
[52:51] Brian Jones.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Brian Jones. Brother Brian Jones. How
[52:54] many remember Brother Brian Jones when
[52:56] we had him here? See, Tyler, you're
[52:58] around friends.
[53:01] Tyler and his sister, they made their
[53:04] own way,
[53:06] paid for their fair, went and gave a
[53:10] couple weeks of their time at Brother
[53:13] Brian Jones.
[53:15] He's a man that you have never met a man
[53:18] like this before. His pastor was brother
[53:22] Ret, senior brother Ratif. And brother
[53:26] Ret told me that he got after Brian
[53:30] because Brian wouldn't carry a gun. And
[53:33] he said, "Brian,
[53:35] somebody's going to get hurt and you
[53:38] don't have a gun."
[53:40] So Brian had a a gun mixed up with all
[53:44] the mud and the dirt and the sand and
[53:46] the gravel in the back of his pickup,
[53:48] but he didn't pay much attention to it.
[53:51] And uh a a woman came from the Nutell.
[53:56] Now you've never heard this, Tyler, and
[53:59] your sister, so I want you to be able to
[54:02] hear this. And uh so Brian told me this
[54:07] himself.
[54:08] And so they heard such spectacular
[54:11] things. He was just a man of the jungle.
[54:15] And uh
[54:18] so this news reporter said, well, she
[54:21] couldn't believe it. So she came out to
[54:23] the ranch to the farm. And he he never
[54:27] had his own ranch. The ranch you were at
[54:29] was owned by a doctor, I think. Wasn't
[54:32] he looking after injured animals? Yes.
[54:36] And so that's what he was doing. And
[54:39] when you gave your time there
[54:42] and uh this news reporter was there and
[54:46] uh so he he took her on a walk on a
[54:49] trail, but it was late at night and it
[54:52] was dark and and they came around the
[54:55] bend and there was a big female lion and
[54:58] she had just had finished a kill
[55:02] and uh and she just turned and wheeled
[55:05] around
[55:06] and Brian man said to her without
[55:10] moving,
[55:12] he said, "Don't move or you're dead."
[55:15] And so he just stood still and she and
[55:18] she come on a charge. This lion, mother
[55:20] lion, and then about three feet because
[55:23] he didn't move about 3 feet before she
[55:26] got to him. She just get it to a stop
[55:29] and reached out her her nose so she
[55:33] could smell him. and she she
[55:35] [clears throat] did a smell and then she
[55:37] wheeled around and went back to her
[55:39] kill.
[55:41] And uh then he said to the reporter,
[55:45] "Now we we got to get out of here
[55:47] because the next time she doesn't stop.
[55:50] [laughter]
[55:51] You can sit down." Thanks, Tyler. God
[55:55] bless you on your graduation. If you
[55:58] ever get a chance to go back, that can
[56:00] get a hold of you. But he's a he's a
[56:02] he's he's a he's a strange man, Brian
[56:06] Jones, and he'll probably hear this as
[56:08] well. But uh but when we were there and
[56:12] my wife is there, my wife, she's not,
[56:14] you know, she come from the north, but
[56:16] she's not been around all this kind of
[56:19] thing. And and then they take the they
[56:22] take the pickup and drag the live meat
[56:25] through the bush to attract the animals
[56:27] and then bring it right out close to you
[56:30] and and put a sleeping bag so you can
[56:32] sleep there all night while the lions
[56:35] come in and feed.
[56:37] Thank you very much.
[56:41] Just as long as they're not feeding on
[56:42] the sleeping bags
[56:45] and the people that are in them. But
[56:48] anyway, that's Brian Jones.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; God's got all kinds of folks, hasn't he?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; I think that some are way over there and
[56:56] some are here.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; I want to uh I just want to talk to you
[57:05] and speak to you this morning about some
[57:08] things that I have been thinking about
[57:12] that very much affect
[57:15] us today.
[57:17] And one of the things is this
[57:21] that while
[57:23] we are members of the human community
[57:26] because we had a natural birth
[57:29] but we are here in this building and I
[57:32] may not be speaking to everyone but I
[57:34] trust I am. We are here in this
[57:37] sanctuary because we have been born
[57:41] again.
[57:42] And because we have because you have
[57:45] been born again,
[57:48] you are part of another community
[57:52] &gt;&gt; which is eternal community.
[57:56] And so you are here in a dual
[58:00] a dual purpose.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; You are here and you're doing natural
[58:05] things, but you may not even be aware of
[58:08] it. You're doing supernatural things.
[58:11] You're doing things that pertain to
[58:14] another kingdom. They're not related to
[58:17] this kingdom. And although Satan is got
[58:21] the he's the prince of the power of the
[58:23] air and he's got control of things and
[58:28] maybe bring in laws or bring in
[58:30] restrictions and bring in things or
[58:34] bring in uh glossy things to attract
[58:38] your attention and get you all taken up
[58:42] with the world and the cares of the
[58:44] world. And he's a he's a slicker. The
[58:47] prophet says he's a slicker.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And so while we have to work, that's in
[58:51] this kingdom. We need to keep these two
[58:54] kingdoms. And this will mean something
[58:56] to you, brother Matthew. We have to keep
[58:59] these two kingdoms always in our mind
[59:03] because we cannot allow the kingdom of
[59:07] this world to eat up. Yes, you might be
[59:11] gifted. You may have a certain
[59:13] intelligence and you'll want to take and
[59:16] or you may excel in sports. You may
[59:19] excel in some kind of beauty and so on
[59:22] so forth. And we had a we had my wife
[59:25] and I had a daughter Joanne who's at the
[59:28] organ and she excelled in sport. She
[59:32] excelled. She didn't know it. Uh she
[59:35] came to a school here. We just my wife
[59:37] went there because the girls were you
[59:40] know it was kind of a girls club etc etc
[59:43] and she went there she didn't know that
[59:45] the man that was directing the young
[59:48] ladies was actually the teacher of the
[59:53] uh the gymnastic team which went to the
[59:56] world Olympics and won the gold medal
[1:00:00] and that was already passed and he saw
[1:00:03] that you know
[1:00:05] he just observed two of the young ladies
[1:00:08] and one of them was in training with him
[1:00:12] and he put his eyes on our daughter who
[1:00:16] was 10 years old and said, "Well, uh uh
[1:00:21] who is this little girl?" My wife said,
[1:00:24] "Well, it's our daughter." Well, right
[1:00:26] away it's another kingdom that starts to
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. uh utilize or see or uh you know
[1:00:36] they'll get some celebrity and and and
[1:00:40] uh they're gifted maybe in in
[1:00:43] [clears throat] uh
[1:00:45] drama or whatever more and you have to
[1:00:47] be very very careful because that starts
[1:00:50] reaching into another kingdom. It
[1:00:53] doesn't matter how much you excel in
[1:00:55] that use it for the kingdom of God.
[1:00:59] Don't waste your time on the things of
[1:01:02] this world. Don't waste your beauty on
[1:01:04] the things of this world. Don't waste
[1:01:06] your skills or your abilities on the
[1:01:10] kingdom of this world. If whatever you
[1:01:13] gain of this world, say, "How can I use
[1:01:16] that to further the kingdom of God?"
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way to do it. I
[1:01:21] should have amen throughout this whole
[1:01:23] congregation. That's what definitely you
[1:01:26] want to do. Use your abilities. Use
[1:01:29] whatever God gives you. God, your father
[1:01:32] gave it to you. This is Father's Day. Th
[1:01:35] this is our father gave it to us.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And then and so now I'm going to try to
[1:01:42] stay with the scripture. Now the fact
[1:01:45] that we have two uh
[1:01:50] we are a dual person. The Bible says
[1:01:53] this, "While
[1:01:55] we look,"
[1:01:58] now I'm going to be reading in a few
[1:02:00] moments. You have five senses of this
[1:02:02] body, this outer body. You have five
[1:02:05] senses. Every person has five to feel,
[1:02:09] to smell, to taste, to see, and to hear.
[1:02:14] And the prophet says they do not declare
[1:02:19] God.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; They only are here so you can touch and
[1:02:24] contact this world
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; that he allowed us to be born in. That's
[1:02:29] by our natural birth. It says while we
[1:02:33] look now we have sight while we look not
[1:02:38] at the things which are seen but at the
[1:02:42] things which are not seen. You say,
[1:02:45] "Well, how do I see the things that are
[1:02:47] not seen?" You sense them. You have a
[1:02:50] six a sixth sense.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And it says, "But as the things that uh-
[1:02:59] which are seen, but at the things which
[1:03:01] are are not seen, for the things which
[1:03:05] are not seen are the things which are
[1:03:08] seen are temporal, but the things which
[1:03:12] are not seen are eternal." So, here you
[1:03:16] are. You're here on a Sunday morning.
[1:03:19] I'm going to announce to you, you have
[1:03:21] the ability to contact and to interact
[1:03:25] with the things which are seen, but they
[1:03:27] are temporal.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; You work at something, you build
[1:03:32] something, but it's temporal.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; God gives you a house to live in, it's
[1:03:37] temporal.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; It's passing.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And when you're gone, it's gone. It'll
[1:03:42] be gone. And you you you got to always
[1:03:46] remember these things are temporal.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; We get married. We have children. We
[1:03:53] have families. It's temporal. It's here
[1:03:56] for a time. And as you grow older, you
[1:04:00] see it diminishing. And yet the
[1:04:03] influence down here
[1:04:06] retain you retain an influence because
[1:04:08] God wants you to have an influence on
[1:04:11] your family. He wants you to have an
[1:04:14] influence in the church. And the and the
[1:04:16] prophet of God said, "You are
[1:04:20] influenced. You also are an influence
[1:04:24] whether you realize it or not." I said
[1:04:26] to one of the brothers of this church, I
[1:04:29] said, "You were in another city recently
[1:04:33] where your uh children were grown
[1:04:36] children now, and it's been a lot of
[1:04:39] years since many of these people saw
[1:04:42] him. But I said this, and I believe it
[1:04:44] with all my heart, and that's why I'm
[1:04:46] saying it to the congregation. your
[1:04:48] young people are screaming out an uh a
[1:04:52] message that you can't even begin to
[1:04:55] preach. You can't preach. You don't have
[1:04:57] an opportunity to preach. You don't have
[1:04:59] an you don't have a pulpit to preach it
[1:05:01] behind. But your family or your own
[1:05:04] lives will scream out the testimony that
[1:05:08] Jesus Christ is here in another another
[1:05:11] dimension and you are ex an expression
[1:05:14] of that. Now, you may have a lot of
[1:05:17] questions on that, but just let me
[1:05:19] continue on here.
[1:05:22] The eternal kingdom of God
[1:05:25] merging with time
[1:05:28] in and through the believer,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; in and through you as an individual, the
[1:05:35] eternal kingdom of God
[1:05:38] merging with time. Yes.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Uh the believers, the children of God.
[1:05:44] God our father placed us down here in
[1:05:49] time to declare the eternal kingdom of
[1:05:53] God. That's your purpose. That's why
[1:05:56] you're here. Not just to get an
[1:05:58] education, not just to get a skill, get
[1:06:00] as much as your mind will take you. Take
[1:06:04] it all, but say, "This is for the
[1:06:06] kingdom of God. I am here for that
[1:06:09] purpose. And and I may be undercover
[1:06:13] because people don't know. The world
[1:06:15] doesn't know. They don't know this
[1:06:17] world. They people even try to figure
[1:06:19] out. My neighbors try to figure us out.
[1:06:22] You'll have an opportunity. But your let
[1:06:25] your life preach the message to them
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; to declare the eternal kingdom. We are
[1:06:34] born, live, die, but that is not the
[1:06:39] end.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Your life will continue. We read the
[1:06:44] Bible. We read from Joshua here. We read
[1:06:47] about Moses. We read about the the
[1:06:50] prophets and so on so forth.
[1:06:55] Are we affected by their lives?
[1:06:57] Certainly are.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what God intended.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might think of when you're
[1:07:04] cold and stiff and wait till I read some
[1:07:07] scripture uh to you.
[1:07:13] You're very much alive
[1:07:18] in a message faith.
[1:07:22] You have five senses of the body. See,
[1:07:26] taste, feel, smell, hear. Now, none of
[1:07:30] those
[1:07:32] uh senses will declare God.
[1:07:37] He put him in five senses to contact his
[1:07:41] earthly home,
[1:07:43] not to contact God with.
[1:07:46] And then in a message, God doesn't call
[1:07:50] man to judgment without first warning
[1:07:52] him. He said, "There's another world."
[1:07:56] Oh,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. There is
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; there's another world.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; While you're in this one,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; while you're sitting listening to me,
[1:08:06] there's another world. You don't have to
[1:08:09] leave very far.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to believe this.
[1:08:17] It's right with you.
[1:08:20] It's right around you.
[1:08:23] God only give you five senses
[1:08:27] and that's to contact so much of this
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; this world. But there's another world
[1:08:35] that you haven't got any senses to
[1:08:38] contact.
[1:08:40] You ha you can't contact it because you
[1:08:44] don't have it in a in a natural life. We
[1:08:49] haven't got it just ready. But it he
[1:08:52] doesn't say you can't. I'll I'll read
[1:08:54] some other quotes to you.
[1:08:59] Our kind heavenly father, this is in a
[1:09:01] message inspiration.
[1:09:03] We are grateful for this grand glorious
[1:09:07] privilege that we have tonight. What is
[1:09:10] the grand glorious privilege that we
[1:09:13] have tonight? This is this morning to
[1:09:16] assemble together. Here we are. You've
[1:09:19] assembled together. that's in this life.
[1:09:22] You used your energy.
[1:09:25] You used your strength to drive to come
[1:09:29] here. You had a plan that's in this life
[1:09:33] to contact the world and that you're in.
[1:09:37] He said, "But we have another
[1:09:40] we have a grand glorious privilege that
[1:09:43] we have tonight to assemble together
[1:09:47] again.
[1:09:48] Another night this side of when time
[1:09:52] will merge with eternity." We can say,
[1:09:56] "Well, that's future." Just listen.
[1:09:59] The believer's life down here is made up
[1:10:01] of number one things of this life and
[1:10:06] two things that are from the kingdom of
[1:10:10] God.
[1:10:12] You have to remember that. And you have
[1:10:15] not come here in a birth
[1:10:18] for just the things of this life.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You've come here to testify there's
[1:10:25] another kingdom. There's a kingdom of
[1:10:28] holiness.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; This one may be full of lies. This one
[1:10:32] may be full of uh contrary regulations,
[1:10:36] but there's another kingdom.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And you are here to declare the
[1:10:41] cleanness and truth of that kingdom.
[1:10:44] You're here to declare the presence of
[1:10:46] God.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; The there's a holiness about the people.
[1:10:50] Like this man that wrote, I have this uh
[1:10:53] I have this testimony here. He comes
[1:10:56] into a church. He doesn't know anybody.
[1:10:59] So that has nothing to do with the
[1:11:01] physical. It isn't what he knows. It
[1:11:04] isn't what he sees. It isn't what he
[1:11:08] can taste or feel.
[1:11:11] But he sees a picture on the wall.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Love projects.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; It speaks to something within him.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Here's a man that's looking
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. to be cared for. Here's a man that
[1:11:27] doesn't know anything about a love of a
[1:11:31] father or a mother. Listen, I know what
[1:11:34] I'm talking about.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; My wife is writing my memoirs.
[1:11:40] And uh
[1:11:44] caused me and forced me, well, when were
[1:11:47] you living here? I said, you don't
[1:11:50] understand.
[1:11:52] I don't know when I was living there and
[1:11:54] I don't even know why I was there. I was
[1:11:57] there because the people would have me
[1:12:00] or whatever more. I know what I'm
[1:12:02] speaking of. I'm not speaking a fairy
[1:12:04] tale.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; You young men have a home to go to. You
[1:12:09] thank God for that home. He gave you
[1:12:12] those parents. Hey, he gave you that
[1:12:14] mother and dad. You thank God for that.
[1:12:17] There are those that such as this man
[1:12:20] said he was homeless. I understand that
[1:12:23] he was homeless. He didn't know where
[1:12:25] his home was.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; You're you're sitting very very quiet.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you about someone I have
[1:12:38] never known what my own room is.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; It might be there for a week or two.
[1:12:45] That's not your room. That isn't where
[1:12:47] you stay to go to a school. You You go
[1:12:52] to the school over here. I worked and
[1:12:55] others in this congregation
[1:12:57] worked with our hands to provide you
[1:12:59] with that school. I've never been in a
[1:13:02] school like that. I visited, but I have
[1:13:05] never had a room in a school like that.
[1:13:09] Twice in my life in grade four and grade
[1:13:11] six, I was in a in in a room of about 20
[1:13:15] students from grade one to grade eight
[1:13:19] in one room. That was it.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That was school.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Don't don't say don't look at me and
[1:13:27] think, well, you you're back in the dark
[1:13:29] ages. There was good schools.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Sure. And it was modern schools that
[1:13:34] were being built.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; But that happened to be the time. But I
[1:13:39] can tell you something. I learned
[1:13:41] something about God
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that maybe you didn't learn in a in a
[1:13:46] school where you had a teacher that was
[1:13:49] given. How I thank God.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; You may wonder why I have such
[1:13:54] appreciation. I look down and I see the
[1:13:57] teachers and see the principal of the
[1:14:00] school here. And I'm we'll speak about
[1:14:01] it a little bit later. But how I thank
[1:14:04] God for it. And God knows I'm saying
[1:14:07] thank you, Father,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; for caring for us,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; caring for our children.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for giving us people
[1:14:16] that are clean and holy and have a good
[1:14:20] desire. YOU MIGHT SAY, "WELL, I FALL SO
[1:14:22] SHORT." DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW short you
[1:14:25] fall. be you can be concerned about it
[1:14:28] but uh let God just surrender your life
[1:14:31] to God and whatever you have me we do
[1:14:36] I'll domen
[1:14:42] the prophet said so let me take faith
[1:14:46] if the doctor says
[1:14:49] and I know that I'm going to be speaking
[1:14:50] to a lot of people just this moment if
[1:14:53] the doctor says
[1:14:55] you have a doctor. I have a doctor
[1:14:59] and we think very kindly about our
[1:15:01] doctors.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And those that have given their lives,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; some of you are nurses.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; My daughter took and became practical
[1:15:12] nurse in one year and then this guy back
[1:15:14] here behind me asked her to marry him
[1:15:18] and that was the end of it.
[1:15:22] But it's been a a big help to a lot of
[1:15:25] people.
[1:15:26] The nursing you know things and I I
[1:15:30] called sister
[1:15:32] uh Lisa St. John. I wanted to find a
[1:15:36] specialist down in Seattle and I didn't
[1:15:39] and I mean she just I don't know if she
[1:15:42] shook the branches until all the doctors
[1:15:44] fell out.
[1:15:49] So, so let me take faith. If the doctor
[1:15:52] says you're going to die with a cancer,
[1:15:56] some of you have heard that.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; If a doctor says you're going to die
[1:16:03] with a cancer,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; that's all he knows.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the book told him.
[1:16:12] When you see these signs and when you
[1:16:14] have that many cells,
[1:16:16] that's all he knows about. Have faith
[1:16:20] and it will change the situation for
[1:16:23] you.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; If he says you'll never walk again, the
[1:16:29] man's telling the truth. That's all he
[1:16:33] knows.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Because that's his source of
[1:16:37] understanding.
[1:16:39] That's what he can look at.
[1:16:43] What he can He can only go by his
[1:16:47] senses.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; He tastes feels
[1:16:52] goes by his senses
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; his understanding,
[1:16:58] feel, smell, taste, hear. But you see,
[1:17:02] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:17:06] for, the evidence of things you don't
[1:17:10] feel.
[1:17:20] things
[1:17:22] you don't hear.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; It's faith. It's a it's it's a six
[1:17:26] sense.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:17:32] It's a six sense. A man in the
[1:17:35] wheelchair says, "I'm going to get up
[1:17:37] and walk."
[1:17:40] Well, the book didn't say that. The book
[1:17:43] said, "You're
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; bound to a wheelchair."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I want to get up."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Think of it.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I want to walk.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I talked to a man. He was here one year,
[1:17:56] one time. I think it was before you were
[1:17:59] here, Brother Tim. Maybe
[1:18:03] probably you were here
[1:18:09] from South Africa, little fellow.
[1:18:13] Uh
[1:18:14] he got very very sick.
[1:18:17] He got very sick. He was lived in Cape
[1:18:19] Town, got very sick and he they couldn't
[1:18:24] figure out what was wrong with him, but
[1:18:25] he got so sick and he bounced off the
[1:18:27] walls and he couldn't walk.
[1:18:30] And he was so determined he thought,
[1:18:32] "I'm going to get up and I'm going to
[1:18:34] walk to that wall and go to the wall and
[1:18:37] bang on it and bounce on it." And he was
[1:18:40] so determined. I talked to him there. I
[1:18:43] saw him here.
[1:18:45] And uh I'll just think of his name in a
[1:18:48] moment
[1:18:49] hopefully.
[1:18:51] Um
[1:18:56] but the thing that struck me was his
[1:18:59] determination.
[1:19:02] It was something that was unearly.
[1:19:06] It was more than human. He was just
[1:19:09] determined. I'm going to get up. and how
[1:19:12] he was he must have been alone often in
[1:19:15] the room and he would stagger around and
[1:19:17] bounce into the wall. But I also saw him
[1:19:21] completely healed.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; It's a sixth sense
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; beyond the five senses.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You can't hear this. You can't see it.
[1:19:38] You can't prove it.
[1:19:40] You can't prove it. I want to speak to
[1:19:43] you intelligent people. You can't prove
[1:19:46] it.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; There's no place to prove it. It's
[1:19:50] faith.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; It's called faith. It's the things
[1:19:54] that's hoped for.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And the proof of evidence of things that
[1:20:00] are not seen.
[1:20:03] He said it's a six sense. Five senses
[1:20:06] won't touch it. It's the sixth sense.
[1:20:09] This is in We would see Jesus in Spokane
[1:20:13] 1962.
[1:20:15] Five senses won't declare faith at all.
[1:20:18] It's the sixth sense.
[1:20:21] And the sixth sense
[1:20:24] is the one that declares the whole armor
[1:20:26] of God.
[1:20:28] And the whole armor of God is nothing
[1:20:32] that the he said one of the five senses
[1:20:35] will declare.
[1:20:38] He said, ' Do you believe that?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Look, he says, "Faith, love, joy, peace,
[1:20:44] longsuffering,
[1:20:46] meekness, gentleness, patience." Who can
[1:20:50] declare
[1:20:51] that by some of your science?
[1:20:56] You can't do it. It's a faith that six
[1:21:00] sense. Friends, the reason I have to
[1:21:02] believe that is because
[1:21:05] you know, brother Brandham when he
[1:21:06] prayed
[1:21:07] He very seldom raised his voice.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He just told the devil.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; you must lose this. Loose this child.
[1:21:18] This person belongs to God.
[1:21:22] And when you see some divine thing take
[1:21:25] place.
[1:21:28] Have you ever seen it? I have.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; The man you're looking at has seen it.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I've seen it. I've seen it happen.
[1:21:37] I've
[1:21:39] touched the hand and shaken the hand of
[1:21:42] people
[1:21:44] and I just have to tell you
[1:21:47] my wife is sitting on the back seat
[1:21:49] here.
[1:21:53] But I had an old farmer woman and I
[1:21:56] turned around shook hands with her. I
[1:21:59] was a total stranger. Never been in that
[1:22:01] church before,
[1:22:03] ever. before or since.
[1:22:06] And I rode a motorcycle to that service.
[1:22:10] You talk about desperate. I rode a
[1:22:12] motorcycle
[1:22:14] after church. Oh, you say, "Well, I know
[1:22:18] some of you here have motorcycles, but I
[1:22:20] was driving to a church service in the
[1:22:23] freezing weather in it snowed that
[1:22:26] night, but I was determined to get to
[1:22:30] that meeting." And I got to that meeting
[1:22:32] and this old lady shook my hand said you
[1:22:35] have something heavy on your heart. I
[1:22:38] said yes. I was not going with my wife
[1:22:44] and I don't know whether she was
[1:22:45] interested me but
[1:22:49] I was a young man. I was about 17. Might
[1:22:52] have been 18.
[1:22:56] This is how sometimes it happens.
[1:23:01] Nathan.
[1:23:05] But I shook a woman's hand.
[1:23:07] I was sitting on the front seat just
[1:23:09] exactly as you are. And I turned around
[1:23:12] and there's an old farm couple
[1:23:15] and I did not know them very well and
[1:23:18] shook my hand. She said, "You have
[1:23:19] something heavy on your heart." I said,
[1:23:21] "Yes." She said, "It concerns a young
[1:23:24] lady." I said, "Yes." And she turned
[1:23:27] around. She said, "That's the one." She
[1:23:30] said, "The dark girl sitting at the
[1:23:33] back." I said, "Yes." She said, "Have no
[1:23:36] fear." That's all she said. "Have no
[1:23:38] fear. God has given her to you."
[1:23:41] Here she is 65 years later.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; God has given her to you.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Not for five minutes.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He gave her to you.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and
[1:23:52] friends, I'm talking about a real God.
[1:23:57] I'm talking to you about a real father.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; You sit down to food. He's provided that
[1:24:05] food.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; In a message, we would see Jesus.
[1:24:19] When faith anchors,
[1:24:22] it's there to stay.
[1:24:25] Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; This isn't
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; this isn't little fictitious
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; statements
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; that you can take or leave.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; But when faith anchors, it's there to
[1:24:36] stay.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; It's just done.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's what causes an old man
[1:24:42] to pray for a girl. His girl is dying,
[1:24:45] 12 years old, in the hospital.
[1:24:49] and he says the nurse is trying to tell
[1:24:53] him something.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Now, you could get all the nursing you
[1:24:57] want, but don't let that be your
[1:25:00] permanent guide.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:25:07] as he's waiting to take her out and
[1:25:10] she's she's dying.
[1:25:13] He said the difference is he says you're
[1:25:16] looking at the screen, you're looking at
[1:25:19] the equipment, but I'm looking at the
[1:25:22] promises.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:25:27] And nothing changes that.
[1:25:34] When faith anchors, it's there to stay.
[1:25:38] It'll never be moved. Nothing can ever
[1:25:41] move faith.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; I find in prayer line about 99
[1:25:48] out of a hundred
[1:25:50] that comes comes to the platform.
[1:25:55] Oh, I've got people say, "Oh, brother
[1:25:58] Brandham, I got all faith."
[1:26:02] Then what are you doing up here?
[1:26:06] See hope instead of faith. They have
[1:26:09] hope instead of faith.
[1:26:15] When Jesus foretold his sufferings, now
[1:26:17] I'm coming to some very important
[1:26:20] points. Are you okay? Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; When Jesus foretold his sufferings,
[1:26:28] his disciples recoiled
[1:26:31] at his voice, at his words
[1:26:35] as a supreme example of merging of two
[1:26:40] worlds.
[1:26:41] A supreme example. Are you following me?
[1:26:45] A supreme example. There is Jesus in the
[1:26:49] garden of Gethsemane
[1:26:53] and he often spoke of the son of man is
[1:26:57] going to be killed.
[1:27:00] Now I want you to stay with me very very
[1:27:02] close. The son of man is going to be
[1:27:05] killed and on the third day he'll rise.
[1:27:10] Remember
[1:27:12] God, almighty God [snorts] spoke in the
[1:27:15] beginning. And I don't know what he said
[1:27:17] or how he said it. He said, "If you eat
[1:27:21] of this tree, you'll die.
[1:27:25] If you eat of the tree of good and
[1:27:27] knowledge, you'll die.
[1:27:29] But if you eat of the tree of life,
[1:27:31] you'll live." Hallelujah.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And now Jesus is telling Jesus who is
[1:27:39] that word in flesh, God help me,
[1:27:44] is now telling his beloved disciples,
[1:27:47] the son of man will die.
[1:27:51] Friends, if he doesn't die, you're all
[1:27:54] sitting here in vain.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; He died the death. He died till the
[1:28:01] prophet said the sun said he died, the
[1:28:04] stars said he died, the moon said he
[1:28:07] died, everybody said he died. He died to
[1:28:10] death. He actually gasped his last
[1:28:13] breath. I said to a Muslim man in
[1:28:17] Morocco. We sat at a table having
[1:28:21] dinner, but the dinner didn't bother us.
[1:28:23] They put a very, very nice dinner on,
[1:28:26] and my family was there.
[1:28:28] But I said to this man, he was a he was
[1:28:32] the vice president of British American
[1:28:35] Oil
[1:28:37] and he just came in. He was a friend of
[1:28:39] the family
[1:28:41] and he said, "Why do the Jews so hate
[1:28:43] us?" I said, "No, I don't think so." But
[1:28:48] we got on that subject and about Jesus
[1:28:51] dying. And he said, "Well, we we we
[1:28:55] regard him as the Lord, their Lord, and
[1:28:59] that he did not die. His his uh" I said,
[1:29:03] "Well, you believe his disciples stole
[1:29:06] him away."
[1:29:08] And I said, "Listen, do you see my
[1:29:10] family here?"
[1:29:12] I said, "Do you see my daughters and my
[1:29:14] wife?" I said, "I have committed them to
[1:29:18] the gospel of Jesus Christ. If he did
[1:29:21] not die,
[1:29:23] if that was not God
[1:29:27] and giving a paying a sacrifice for us,
[1:29:30] I says we are all lost
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and we cannot be we cannot go to heaven.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; I said you might be a very righteous
[1:29:41] man. And I said, regardless how
[1:29:44] righteous I am. Now, I'm going to take a
[1:29:46] few moments with you. I said,
[1:29:48] "Regardless of how righteous I am, I
[1:29:51] cannot purchase you even five minutes of
[1:29:55] eternal life." He said, "Exact,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; exact." He understood that right away. I
[1:30:01] said, "And you might ever be so good a
[1:30:04] man,
[1:30:05] so righteous a man, but you cannot you
[1:30:09] cannot purchase me one minute of eternal
[1:30:13] life in heaven." He said, "That's
[1:30:16] correct."
[1:30:18] He said, 'Ive never heard it this way
[1:30:20] before.' I said, 'Well, this happens to
[1:30:23] be the way that it is.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And I left him with that thought. I've
[1:30:29] never heard this before.
[1:30:32] No matter how righteous a man is, no
[1:30:34] matter how many good works he does, he
[1:30:37] cannot inherit eternal life. Jesus had
[1:30:40] to die. I want to really stress that.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] Jesus said when he said to his disciples
[1:30:50] that the son of man shall die, he said
[1:30:53] in Matthew 26 and 54, if you want to
[1:30:56] write it down,
[1:30:58] but how then shall the scriptures be
[1:31:01] fulfilled that thus it must be?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; He was telling of his death. death. Not
[1:31:13] near death, but his death. He had to
[1:31:16] die. He had to die, friends, for you to
[1:31:19] be able to live.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we know that." No, no,
[1:31:22] no, that's not what I'm talking about.
[1:31:24] I'm talking about till it goes right
[1:31:26] down to your bootstraps.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; He had to die.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And everything that is looking so
[1:31:34] glamorous in the world, this Jesus died.
[1:31:45] Regardless of what this age produces,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; when the prophet talks about the world,
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; love not the world or the things that
[1:31:54] are in the world, Jesus died that those
[1:31:58] things would vanish out of our lives.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:32:05] And then it says in first John 1:1 that
[1:32:10] which was from the beginning
[1:32:13] which we have heard
[1:32:17] which we have seen these are the senses
[1:32:19] now which we have heard these eternal
[1:32:23] beings we've heard these things and we
[1:32:27] have seen with our eyes which we have
[1:32:31] held which we have looked upon on and
[1:32:34] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:32:37] life. Two worlds merging together.
[1:32:42] All things were made by him and without
[1:32:46] him was nothing was not anything made
[1:32:50] that was made.
[1:32:55] And then in John 14, and the word was
[1:32:59] made flesh. Did they Did the worlds
[1:33:02] merge together? I I want to get this to
[1:33:05] you because I have to go on from here.
[1:33:07] Did the worlds merge together? Eternity
[1:33:11] merged with this life.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Eternity merged when uh this this Holy
[1:33:18] Spirit overshadowed a virgin.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; A virgin in this life. A doctor could
[1:33:24] prove she's a virgin.
[1:33:28] That didn't have anything to do with it.
[1:33:31] She was indeed a virgin,
[1:33:34] but the seed of eternal God was
[1:33:38] conceived. And the Holy Spirit shall
[1:33:40] overshadow you
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; and you shall conceive.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And give birth to a son.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; That had to happen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's no deliverance from
[1:33:52] sin. YOU CAN SING ABOUT DELIVERANCE. You
[1:33:55] I've been redeemed. We can sing all
[1:33:58] those songs. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING
[1:34:00] unless this unless this virgin conceived
[1:34:04] a son. And that son had to go to Calvary
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; and die the death at Calvary.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And when he said, "It is finished." AND
[1:34:14] HE GAVE UP THE GHOST.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN you were free.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE SET FREE. AND ANYTHING SHORT OF
[1:34:22] THAT DOESN'T WORK.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; WE CAN SING ABOUT IT. WE CAN READ ABOUT
[1:34:26] IT. WE CAN all these senses OF WE CAN
[1:34:30] FEEL IT. NO, YOU CAN'T feel this. It's
[1:34:33] something you know
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; it's spoken in the scripture and you
[1:34:37] said that's it.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; friends. That's when faith takes hold
[1:34:44] and nothing will ever shake it.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I had people ask me when I came to the
[1:34:51] message. just said
[1:34:54] disrespectfully.
[1:34:55] He said, "What led you to Brandham?"
[1:34:59] I said, "Well, cuz I I went through some
[1:35:03] reproach."
[1:35:05] Reproach that maybe you don't know
[1:35:07] anything about, but I don't talk about
[1:35:09] reproach. I know what reproach is.
[1:35:12] I had all kinds of I had a ministry that
[1:35:15] was recognized, but doors closed. All
[1:35:19] kinds of doors closed. Thank you my
[1:35:22] friends. Thank you sons and daughters of
[1:35:25] the gospel. I thank God
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; that he sent his holy spirit to you and
[1:35:32] witnessed this is the truth.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; What kind of a gospel would we have?
[1:35:39] What kind of a church would we have if
[1:35:41] we didn't have people who had were of
[1:35:43] like faith?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Like faith.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I'm talking ABOUT THE SAME KIND of
[1:35:49] faith.
[1:35:50] I feel I don't have to make it real to
[1:35:53] you because you it's been made real to
[1:35:56] you.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; And for you that perhaps it hasn't been
[1:36:01] that real, you just hold on to it fast.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Say, I believe that because it's written
[1:36:08] in God's word and God don't lie.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing you a song.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; It's simple.
[1:36:18] I won't sing it. And it's in one key. I
[1:36:22] won't sing it. It's in one key.
[1:36:26] One of our colored sisters years ago and
[1:36:30] there was a pastor in this message and
[1:36:33] his wife and we were in their place and
[1:36:35] she said this sister got up and sang a
[1:36:38] song. She said, "My God don't lie." That
[1:36:41] was the song. That was the title and
[1:36:44] that was all the words. My God, don't
[1:36:47] lie.
[1:36:49] I said, "My God, don't lie." [laughter]
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; And when you were all through listening
[1:36:57] to it, you said, "What is she saying?"
[1:36:59] She's saying, "My God, don't lie."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You like that, don't you?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I do, too. My God don't lie.
[1:37:11] That's all you have to know. My God
[1:37:13] don't lie. He said it in his word. My
[1:37:16] God don't lie.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming to If you got tired, we'd
[1:37:28] just stand for a moment or two. This is
[1:37:29] the only service today. I'm not going to
[1:37:32] be long for uh just for that sake. But
[1:37:37] nevertheless, I want to get this across.
[1:37:39] This is very heavy on my heart.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] This is taking sides with Jesus. And
[1:37:46] brother Brandham actually lays out for
[1:37:49] you,
[1:37:51] lays out for me
[1:37:56] how
[1:37:58] I can't really explain it, but I'll let
[1:38:01] I'll let the paragraph explain itself.
[1:38:05] Now he says, "Now I notice
[1:38:08] [clears throat] that how the churches
[1:38:12] the evangelism started scattering out
[1:38:15] everywhere."
[1:38:16] And I have number one, evangelism
[1:38:20] started scattering out everywhere.
[1:38:23] That's number one. Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Number two,
[1:38:29] he said, "And then we'll take for
[1:38:32] instance
[1:38:34] the Paul becoming a great missionary to
[1:38:36] our people."
[1:38:38] We find out that he went wherever the
[1:38:42] Lord led him
[1:38:45] and established a church. Number two is
[1:38:49] Paul becoming a great missionary to our
[1:38:52] people.
[1:38:54] Evangelism scattered out everywhere.
[1:38:58] Now for the ministers and you that feel
[1:39:00] a call to the ministry, this is how it
[1:39:03] happens.
[1:39:06] Evangelism scatters out everywhere.
[1:39:12] And we find out
[1:39:14] that he went about and Paul becoming a
[1:39:17] great missionary to our people. We find
[1:39:20] out that he went about wherever the Lord
[1:39:23] led him and he established a church.
[1:39:28] Number three. Number four.
[1:39:32] And it was a new faith.
[1:39:42] Some of you have heard it
[1:39:45] for a lot of times. I believe you were
[1:39:48] 15 when you were moved here.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And it was a new faith.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; You were in a church, Brother Tom,
[1:40:00] United Church. You never heard these
[1:40:02] things. It was a new faith.
[1:40:06] Brother Tim, you were in Pentecost
[1:40:09] and you knew a lot about being saved and
[1:40:12] repenting and so on and so forth. Um,
[1:40:16] [clears throat] but it was a new faith.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; You never heard many of these things.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And things that Paul spoke about were so
[1:40:26] mysterious,
[1:40:27] but they all made sense.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a new faith.
[1:40:34] I want to say to you, this is not an old
[1:40:37] religion.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; And yet it is the oldest. It's the
[1:40:42] gospel.
[1:40:44] But it's a new faith because it's it's
[1:40:48] untampered
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; by man
[1:40:52] saying, "Well, this is the way that it
[1:40:54] is." And we have taken
[1:40:57] we've taken
[1:41:00] various scriptures and we tie them
[1:41:02] together and we end up with a trinity.
[1:41:07] But there's no trinity or even in the
[1:41:11] message. You have to be very careful.
[1:41:13] Now
[1:41:15] in the message they'll have but one
[1:41:18] quote and another quote, another quote.
[1:41:21] Connect them all together and at the end
[1:41:24] of the quotes, listen now.
[1:41:28] They'll come up with an obvious
[1:41:30] conclusion,
[1:41:32] but you'll never find that conclusion
[1:41:36] in the message.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; You'll never find that conclusion.
[1:41:41] You'll never find the prophet saying
[1:41:44] that's thus sayaeth the Lord. I think
[1:41:47] that's enough for me to say that
[1:41:54] evangelism started scattering out
[1:41:56] everywhere.
[1:41:59] Paul becoming a great missionary to our
[1:42:01] people. He went about whenever the
[1:42:04] wherever the Lord led him and
[1:42:07] established a church and it was a new
[1:42:10] faith.
[1:42:11] And number five, he had to preach the
[1:42:15] message and many was converted to it.
[1:42:20] You are here because you heard about
[1:42:23] something.
[1:42:25] You're here because you saw something.
[1:42:29] But there was something deeper
[1:42:33] inside that registered to you. And that
[1:42:37] is not something man spoke over a
[1:42:39] pulpit. You might have heard a man over
[1:42:41] a pulpit.
[1:42:43] But there was something inside
[1:42:46] and not of this world. That's why it
[1:42:48] doesn't it does not fit
[1:42:53] any of the learning or the language of
[1:42:56] this world because it come from another
[1:43:00] place.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; It come from another world.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And the people today that use the
[1:43:08] internet, listen to me. You get on the
[1:43:11] internet. I know you do. You get on the
[1:43:14] internet and you get on sites of
[1:43:17] unbelief
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and you do not need to see it.
[1:43:23] God did not sponsor that those websites
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; and it genders unbelief.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; It genders a darkness and a heaviness
[1:43:37] upon your believing
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; right then you should close off the
[1:43:43] computer and go to the scripture and
[1:43:46] just say I'll read the book of John.
[1:43:49] I'll read something of faith. I'll read
[1:43:53] something that's pure. This is not pure.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; This is not holy.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I will read something that will gender
[1:44:04] faith.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And when the disciples recoiled
[1:44:10] because he said and they were ready to
[1:44:13] take their sword
[1:44:15] and Jesus said to Peter, "Put up your
[1:44:17] sword. They that live by the sword will
[1:44:20] die by the sword.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; You don't live by argument.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; We don't live by other textbooks.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; We don't live by even taking the message
[1:44:32] and dissecting it and said, "Well, he
[1:44:34] said this and he said that." You can't
[1:44:37] get him waring against You can't get God
[1:44:41] God waring against what's already true,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; what he's already said.
[1:44:47] You might say, "Oh, I'm just trying to
[1:44:49] get you away from those sites." I am
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; trying to get you away from those sites.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I know. I I I've just seen them. I've
[1:44:57] never studied them. I've never read them
[1:45:02] because there's heavy darkness comes and
[1:45:05] I know that that darkness does not come
[1:45:08] by the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; He comes as an inspiration.
[1:45:15] And one works and the other one does not
[1:45:17] work. It only brings a person to death.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And he had to preach the message. Now
[1:45:30] I'm coming to a subject I want you to
[1:45:33] hear very very much. And that is the
[1:45:36] present stage. Brother Brandon preached
[1:45:38] the present stage of my ministry.
[1:45:42] This little uh
[1:45:49] process that I'm going through brings us
[1:45:52] to the present stage of his ministry and
[1:45:55] the present stage of our ministry.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; You listening to it? The present stage
[1:46:01] of our ministry.
[1:46:04] And Paul became a great missionary to
[1:46:07] our people. And he went about wherever
[1:46:10] the Lord led him. and he established a
[1:46:13] church and it was a new faith
[1:46:18] and he had to preach the message
[1:46:22] and many was converted to it
[1:46:26] if he left the people in that condition.
[1:46:31] Now I'm coming right to our time
[1:46:35] and to the person you're looking at.
[1:46:39] We went all over. People heard,
[1:46:43] "Oh, God has sent a prophet.
[1:46:46] They want to know what did he say."
[1:46:49] So they needed the books or they needed
[1:46:52] a tape to hear it if they could
[1:46:54] understand the English.
[1:46:56] And then people were converted to it.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And maybe only some spoke English, but
[1:47:02] they were converted to it. And the
[1:47:04] others just looked I've had them look at
[1:47:08] me and they I've had the dark eyes of
[1:47:13] people in Africa look at me so
[1:47:16] longingly.
[1:47:18] Listen, I want you to stand behind this
[1:47:20] pulpit for a moment.
[1:47:23] Look at me so longingly.
[1:47:26] And they want You have books? Yes, I
[1:47:31] have books. You have tapes? Yes.
[1:47:35] Oh, if I could only hear
[1:47:38] If I could only hear what he said
[1:47:42] and and I'm going to come home
[1:47:46] and rejoice. Oh, I got red volumes and I
[1:47:50] got brown brown volumes and I've got CDs
[1:47:53] and I've got little zip sticks
[1:47:56] and you're going to rejoice over that.
[1:47:59] How can you rejoice
[1:48:02] when you got people say, "Well, you got
[1:48:04] it in this language. You got it in that
[1:48:06] language. You got it." And you can hear
[1:48:09] it. And we can't hear it.
[1:48:14] So, I'll just tell you, I came home a
[1:48:17] burdened, broken man.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I broke down in front of Sister Glattis
[1:48:27] Dao.
[1:48:30] She said, "What's new?"
[1:48:33] I said, "Sister Dao,
[1:48:38] I have people with brown eyes,
[1:48:41] dark brown eyes. I just came from Africa
[1:48:44] and they're begging.
[1:48:47] They want to hear so much what he said.
[1:48:52] And I've got walls of tapes. I've got
[1:48:56] reels. I've got cassettes. I've got CDs.
[1:49:00] I've got red volumes. I got brown
[1:49:02] volumes. HOW CAN I REJOICE over this?
[1:49:07] When I'm looking at people, people,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; my brothers
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; in the family of God,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; they just yearned, "If only I could hear
[1:49:19] it.
[1:49:21] I can't believe that." So we came home.
[1:49:27] I said,
[1:49:29] and I got it written here, friends.
[1:49:34] I said, we've got to we've got to clean
[1:49:37] the tapes.
[1:49:39] We got to clean the tapes.
[1:49:50] Paul established churches
[1:49:54] and he said and the prophet said, "And
[1:49:57] if he left the people in that condition,
[1:50:00] they would wander right back into their
[1:50:02] pagan gods and into Judaism
[1:50:07] and whatever more because the people had
[1:50:12] no one to teach them. Amen.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; They have to have someone teach them.
[1:50:18] And you can't have someone teach them if
[1:50:20] that one doesn't know anything about it.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; They have to know. They have to
[1:50:25] experience it themselves.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say something about
[1:50:36] Canada in the United States. You're
[1:50:38] going to go from here. you're gonna
[1:50:41] have, you know, celebrate your father's
[1:50:43] day or whatever. Have your fathers over.
[1:50:47] Let me tell you something.
[1:50:53] There'll be one father
[1:50:56] and he's standing here behind the
[1:50:57] pulpit.
[1:51:00] They'll have a tough time when I know
[1:51:03] that people don't have the message.
[1:51:11] And that's why I get excited
[1:51:15] when I see a Bible is translated.
[1:51:17] Brother Murphy up here translated the
[1:51:21] Bible. I rejoice more over that than
[1:51:24] somebody getting some scholarship.
[1:51:27] scholarship where
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; am I to compare that with somebody
[1:51:32] reading a Chinese Bible
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; and knowing that this nation of 1.4
[1:51:39] billion people don't have an accurate
[1:51:43] Bible don't even have the Bible at the
[1:51:46] prophet of God and we're and I'm
[1:51:49] supposed to be so happy that God sent a
[1:51:51] prophet HOW ABOUT SAYING WHAT KIND OF
[1:51:54] BIBLE DID HE READ?
[1:51:57] YEAH.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And what about saying about 2 million
[1:52:00] people can't don't even have that Bible,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Young men and to think of you've got
[1:52:08] energy.
[1:52:10] You've got skills.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; You point everything towards the word of
[1:52:14] God. And I can tell you that is the sure
[1:52:18] way of success
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; because you become a partner with
[1:52:25] almighty God.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Good. I gave you that
[1:52:28] intelligence. I gave you that retention.
[1:52:31] I gave that to you. I gave you that
[1:52:34] strength. I gave you that energy." You
[1:52:37] said, "Well, I I saw a fire burning in
[1:52:39] in in a person we call our pastor." He's
[1:52:42] your father in the gospel, and that is
[1:52:45] why he gave you that.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; That's why you have it.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; You know what? I'm not going to I'm not
[1:53:00] going to stop and going to settle down.
[1:53:03] I'm not going to just allow us to
[1:53:07] uh
[1:53:09] just settle back and be satisfied.
[1:53:13] That's what this church stands for.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; This is what our calling is.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; And I feel
[1:53:24] I feel that I want to if if I have any
[1:53:26] power, I want to lead you to become a
[1:53:29] partner with him.
[1:53:40] Each one of these churches,
[1:53:43] he left someone who was in order, a man
[1:53:47] that was trustworthy,
[1:53:49] a man that was known as a pastor,
[1:53:53] a shepherd. And then number nine is, and
[1:53:57] is all in this one paragraph. He said
[1:54:00] and then after his church after this
[1:54:05] church they became other there became
[1:54:08] other churches
[1:54:09] came out of it I saw it happen it
[1:54:13] happened in India
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; and then they they they don't know who
[1:54:18] you are which is perfectly fine
[1:54:20] perfectly fine I just rejoice that we
[1:54:23] were able to scatter the word
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; scatter the message
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and I say to this congregation, what's
[1:54:31] wrong with that?
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a good thing?
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something you rejoice over?
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; This is going to surprise you. Can I
[1:54:46] take a few moments? That's right.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:54:54] then this that went out from him, his
[1:54:57] children, was called shepherds
[1:55:01] or pastors.
[1:55:03] And then this group of little churches
[1:55:06] all around came back to this bishop.
[1:55:12] Many ministries went out, but there was
[1:55:15] a great need especially to teach
[1:55:21] the message
[1:55:23] and secondly to translate the message
[1:55:27] into the language of the people.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:55:32] when you hear the hub, the hub, the hub,
[1:55:34] the hub, the hub, well, everybody's got
[1:55:37] a hub today and there's a hub here and a
[1:55:39] hub there.
[1:55:44] This church doesn't know
[1:55:47] perhaps how that happened. But I want to
[1:55:50] tell you about God. I want to tell you
[1:55:53] about something supernatural.
[1:55:55] And I want to go into just a little bit
[1:55:57] of
[1:55:59] background,
[1:56:00] just a wee bit. And I think you'll be
[1:56:03] keenly keenly interested.
[1:56:06] And some of you
[1:56:09] that may not be interested, you need to
[1:56:11] know.
[1:56:19] A few years ago, just a very few years
[1:56:22] ago, [clears throat]
[1:56:25] about 10 or 12,
[1:56:28] I called the trustees
[1:56:31] of the church.
[1:56:33] Some of them have gone.
[1:56:37] But I called them and I took them up to
[1:56:40] Fort Langley
[1:56:42] to a place called Bedford House
[1:56:45] and we had a dinner.
[1:56:49] And while we sat having dinner, I had a
[1:56:52] pad
[1:56:55] and I opened up my pad and I said, "I
[1:56:58] want to draw you a picture."
[1:57:02] And I started with my pen
[1:57:05] and I drew like an architect would draw
[1:57:08] in architectural angles down. I said
[1:57:12] this is about 18 to 24 in across and
[1:57:15] this about 18 to 24 in square. That's
[1:57:19] the top.
[1:57:20] This is colored kind of a steel gray.
[1:57:24] And then here is a screen.
[1:57:27] And on this screen, a person steps up
[1:57:30] and punches the screen and there comes a
[1:57:32] whole uh
[1:57:36] globe of the world.
[1:57:39] And I'm I'm kind of getting lost at this
[1:57:42] time. But then I said maybe may there
[1:57:45] might be a a finger pointing and hitting
[1:57:49] a button and they'll hit a button and
[1:57:52] and uh all the languages will come up
[1:57:55] and it has to be international because
[1:57:57] the people have to be able to recognize
[1:58:00] what language it is
[1:58:02] and uh so that's but as far as and I
[1:58:06] said down here is a slot and and inside
[1:58:09] is a computer and this unit is called a
[1:58:12] message kiosk.
[1:58:15] Never heard that name.
[1:58:17] Ever heard it before. I'm taking this
[1:58:20] time at this pulpit to tell you that's
[1:58:23] what happened up here in Fort Langley.
[1:58:30] And uh I said inside there's a printer
[1:58:36] and the computer commands the printer to
[1:58:39] print a message and it spits out here
[1:58:43] and a person gets that message
[1:58:46] and it's called a message kiosk.
[1:58:49] The only kiosk I ever had seen was one
[1:58:52] at the airport.
[1:58:55] Now that's this life.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; People went to school to learn that. But
[1:59:00] here's a band looking at it
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and I have one thing in my mind.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; That's the kingdom of God.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; How might this work
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; There's they're they're spitting out
[1:59:14] airline tickets. They're spitting out
[1:59:18] boarding passes. But I'm thinking about
[1:59:21] how do we spit out the message?
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; How do we get this that is so precious
[1:59:26] to us? How do we get it to people so
[1:59:28] they can get up there? Whatever language
[1:59:30] it is, they get it in their language. I
[1:59:32] thought this is the most wonderful
[1:59:34] thing. Well, someone else might say,
[1:59:37] "Well, do you know what? They got
[1:59:38] software that does that." Really? Maybe
[1:59:41] you know about that. I don't know
[1:59:43] anything about software, but I know it's
[1:59:45] possible.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I know that in Satan's Eden, they're
[1:59:48] going to figure that out. People talk
[1:59:51] about AI right now. Artificial
[1:59:53] intelligence, brothers. That's why I was
[1:59:56] so inspired by it the other night. I
[1:59:59] don't know how to use it, but I know
[2:00:01] that we can use I'm tied into an
[2:00:03] intelligence that's not artificial and
[2:00:06] it's far beyond anything. It's far
[2:00:09] beyond any any AI.
[2:00:12] And just this last week, I have brother
[2:00:16] Murphy Wong send me a clip and I
[2:00:20] listened to the clip and it's a computer
[2:00:23] language but it's a very good one and
[2:00:26] it's starting off with Genesis
[2:00:29] Genesis 1:1
[2:00:33] and he's speaking of reading it exactly
[2:00:36] the Bible and here's a man listening to
[2:00:40] it. the man that you're looking at
[2:00:42] behind this pulpit and my whole body, my
[2:00:46] whole being is consumed. How can this
[2:00:49] work so that a person can read any Bible
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; and listen to any message?
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to lay a challenge to
[2:00:59] this congregation. That's what we're
[2:01:01] here for.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; That's what God loves.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; He's not in love with us so much as he's
[2:01:08] in love with his word. Amen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; He loves his word.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Darren Hoffman, great is your
[2:01:14] reward in heaven. You've given hours and
[2:01:17] hours into darkness of your room, but
[2:01:20] God saw you there.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that none of that is
[2:01:24] wasted.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; And none of the effort, none of the
[2:01:29] preaching, none of THE SUNDAY SERVICES
[2:01:32] OR ANY SERVICE, none of the streaming is
[2:01:36] wasted. It's
[2:01:39] God orained and Godsponsored.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; I'll finish with that in a few moments.
[2:01:50] Is this all right, Brother Tom?
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:53] [clears throat and cough]
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Not everyone had this burden.
[2:02:02] Brother Perry Green
[2:02:06] first.
[2:02:08] He actually told me that the first
[2:02:10] spoken word books were printed actually
[2:02:13] in Tucson, the very first. I have some
[2:02:16] of the first volumes.
[2:02:19] And I said to our brother Tim Dodd and
[2:02:23] and brother Murphy, we were sitting in
[2:02:26] office.
[2:02:27] I said, 'I have some of volume one.
[2:02:31] They're not accurate,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; but did people believe them? Yeah.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Are there those that have become
[2:02:40] ministers? Probably.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; I think they have
[2:02:46] from volume one
[2:02:48] and the other volumes. Yeah. Well, maybe
[2:02:51] not every word is exactly right. Ah,
[2:02:53] that has nothing to do with it.
[2:02:57] what the Holy Spirit speaks to a person.
[2:03:00] And I'm not talking about failing. I'm
[2:03:02] talking about something that's real,
[2:03:05] something that's genuine.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; And the God that speaks to you, well,
[2:03:11] continues to take the next step.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Perry Green,
[2:03:18] then he put the books into red volumes
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; and I scattered the red volumes into
[2:03:24] India.
[2:03:26] I had brother in in India say I was I we
[2:03:30] had visitor ministers here at promised
[2:03:32] they would send books and I never got
[2:03:34] them. I said you will get a copy of the
[2:03:37] red volumes. I will send you a copy. And
[2:03:40] that brother actually was not a friend
[2:03:43] of mine in that sense of the word. He
[2:03:47] was very cutting. He was very [snorts]
[2:03:50] obnoxious in one way and yet I
[2:03:53] considered him as a brother in Christ
[2:03:56] and I sent him a box right from this
[2:03:59] office here. I think Debbie probably put
[2:04:02] it together and sent it.
[2:04:05] Incidentally, God bless you, Sister
[2:04:07] Debbie.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike,
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Kanye,
[2:04:14] great is your reward. Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Brother David Momus put together
[2:04:22] message books in a called the Brown
[2:04:24] volumes. He had a complete set. He was a
[2:04:28] very in intellectual man and he had a
[2:04:32] complete set that he put together and he
[2:04:35] had uh sisters
[2:04:38] doing the work. I think that
[2:04:41] similar to brother you, brother Ken
[2:04:44] Andes, and his wife, Sister Joyce,
[2:04:48] who was 36 or 37 years, the editor for a
[2:04:52] spoken word, sitting right here
[2:04:55] listening.
[2:04:58] Brother Roy Borders began printing the
[2:05:02] message in much larger quantities
[2:05:06] after he passed away. Incidentally, I
[2:05:09] went with brother Roy Borders. His
[2:05:11] father's buried right down here in
[2:05:13] Victory
[2:05:15] uh Victory Cemetery. He was a a veteran.
[2:05:21] And I went and he asked me to have a
[2:05:23] word of prayer over his father's grave.
[2:05:27] Then brother Joseph Brham began printing
[2:05:32] and distributing message books
[2:05:34] worldwide.
[2:05:35] We also benefited from this
[2:05:38] distribution.
[2:05:40] Some of the books that are out here and
[2:05:42] some of the tracks that are out here
[2:05:44] been sent and I think brother Matthew
[2:05:46] Redell has received
[2:05:49] tens of thousands of tracks and uh the
[2:05:53] group from the congregation, some of you
[2:05:55] young people have been out on the
[2:05:57] streets and handed those out.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You don't
[2:06:01] know where they went.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:06:08] I drove up to a gas station to get gas
[2:06:13] and there's a man sitting on a little
[2:06:15] pale or block of wood or something and
[2:06:18] he's reading a message book.
[2:06:22] I said
[2:06:25] I said that's good. Yeah. He said that's
[2:06:27] it's real good. I said where'd you get
[2:06:30] it? He said I got it in the waste
[2:06:33] basket.
[2:06:34] He said, "Someone was cleaning out their
[2:06:36] car and so they threw this in to the
[2:06:39] car." He says, "I I pulled it out." He
[2:06:41] said, "It's very real good."
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, it's real good." So, we
[2:06:46] just carried on. So, I left him with
[2:06:48] this message book and petrol.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:07:08] And brother Joseph began printing and
[2:07:11] distributing
[2:07:13] the message books and tapes
[2:07:18] worldwide and this continued for many
[2:07:22] years. And just recently they ceased to
[2:07:26] print and instituted a program to have
[2:07:29] people agree to listen to a tape, make
[2:07:34] an agreement.
[2:07:37] Tapes needed also to be translated.
[2:07:43] People say, "Well, if they just listen
[2:07:45] to a tape, if they just listen to it in
[2:07:48] English, it doesn't do much.
[2:07:52] is not fruitful
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; translated into the language of the
[2:07:58] people.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; And I want to just say a few moments
[2:08:04] just for very briefly on the hub.
[2:08:08] Are you getting tired?
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand for a minute?
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Are you okay?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:08:19] I won't be that long, but I'll be a few
[2:08:22] minutes.
[2:08:25] I told you how we went up to a
[2:08:27] restaurant and I drew this hub and a man
[2:08:30] said to me, he said, "Well," he said,
[2:08:33] "we really don't need, we just need
[2:08:35] what's inside that chaos
[2:08:38] so it can be
[2:08:42] into the language of the people."
[2:08:47] And I want to just tell you,
[2:08:50] I was in Switzerland and people said to
[2:08:52] us here, "Oh, here's a group from
[2:08:55] Romania."
[2:08:58] Romania was very, very difficult.
[2:09:03] Young people,
[2:09:06] you want an exciting life. This message
[2:09:09] is the most exciting life
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; you'll ever hear or say. Isn't that
[2:09:16] right, brothers?
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; I was sleeping in a room over here on
[2:09:30] 180th Street
[2:09:33] and uh traveling back and forth and
[2:09:36] going to this country and that country.
[2:09:40] That's what happens as a result of
[2:09:45] evangelism
[2:09:46] started to spread and started scattering
[2:09:50] out everywhere.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Evangelism started scattering out
[2:09:55] everywhere.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; And I wanted to I have had a great
[2:09:59] burden to talk to you just to talk to
[2:10:03] you.
[2:10:05] That's what this
[2:10:08] church is all about.
[2:10:11] And now you are in another era. You're
[2:10:14] in another season.
[2:10:17] But that's the season we've been in.
[2:10:19] That's the season we've been born in.
[2:10:28] And now a few years have gone by.
[2:10:37] I really think we're on the cusp
[2:10:41] of some of the greatest moments.
[2:10:45] I've wondered why the prophet never
[2:10:48] seemed to go to China.
[2:10:56] Now we're just down to
[2:10:59] and I have I think I have a right to ask
[2:11:01] this like a school teacher.
[2:11:04] How does 1.4 billion people
[2:11:08] and maybe five billion I don't know and
[2:11:12] India now has gone to 1.4 billion.
[2:11:22] Yes.
[2:11:23] Behi in Bombay. Brother Brandham was
[2:11:26] there. Yes. There was 500,000 people
[2:11:28] were there. I stood behind the the desk
[2:11:32] that he stood behind.
[2:11:35] And the grandson of the man who invited
[2:11:38] brother Brandham is standing right
[2:11:40] beside me.
[2:11:43] Does that do anything for me? No.
[2:11:45] Doesn't do a thing. But I just happened.
[2:11:47] And out there there was no buildings out
[2:11:50] there. said there was just a field out
[2:11:52] there
[2:11:54] where brother
[2:11:56] brother Dpac Titus here and his wife
[2:11:59] sister Vandy
[2:12:01] and brother Dpac I think your aunt was
[2:12:03] in one of those meetings.
[2:12:05] Yes,
[2:12:07] brother Brandham told me when he was in
[2:12:10] India
[2:12:13] and the people were stretched out
[2:12:14] because they couldn't get them anywhere
[2:12:16] near the building.
[2:12:18] And this young man told me there was no
[2:12:21] buildings across the street. It was just
[2:12:23] open field.
[2:12:26] Brother Brandham told me that that field
[2:12:28] was full of people.
[2:12:30] And sometimes it took
[2:12:33] a long time to get people from there.
[2:12:37] And that was where they were tried to
[2:12:39] tear his clothes
[2:12:41] so they get a piece of cloth
[2:12:47] off of him.
[2:12:49] See friends,
[2:12:53] it might be the children of someone who
[2:12:55] tried to grab his cloth. Yes.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Might be their children.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; But I like to think, Brother Tom,
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not just emotional,
[2:13:13] but what if the people here in this
[2:13:15] congregation
[2:13:19] gave their tithes
[2:13:21] and they gave their mission offerings?
[2:13:24] You might say, "Well, that was just a
[2:13:26] little bit, a little bit of this, a
[2:13:28] little bit of that." What happens if
[2:13:32] those went over and for 30 years? 10,
[2:13:38] 20, 30 years.
[2:13:43] We're printing. Do we have problems?
[2:13:45] Lots of them.
[2:13:51] But we go through this hurdle and
[2:13:55] there's speed bumps and there's all
[2:13:57] kinds of things that happen in this
[2:13:59] life,
[2:14:02] but they don't realize we're not working
[2:14:04] for this life.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; There's people they said, "Well, the
[2:14:09] newspaper said if you let us go,
[2:14:13] we've got to be paid a
[2:14:16] a fee.
[2:14:18] We got we got to be paid a
[2:14:23] vacation vacation fee.
[2:14:26] And we once had 16 people working and
[2:14:30] we're down have to be down to about
[2:14:33] eight. And we got great big presses,
[2:14:40] offset presses.
[2:14:42] And then now it now it's all to be
[2:14:46] duplicated.
[2:14:49] So, it's all digital
[2:14:51] and then you say, "I'm telling you why
[2:14:55] I've got white hair."
[2:14:59] And then it's all digital. Then we have
[2:15:02] a fire
[2:15:06] and the Telugu language is mostly lost.
[2:15:12] Now [clears throat] it falls.
[2:15:14] You're trying to get the Telugu back up.
[2:15:19] So we're trying to deal with that even
[2:15:21] now.
[2:15:23] Is that simple?
[2:15:25] No. That's in this kingdom.
[2:15:30] So we know what it is to work and keep
[2:15:33] hammering through,
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; So that somebody is going to hand a book
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; to somebody
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; or speak a message to somebody
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; or they're going to say it in someone
[2:15:45] else's life. Amen.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Like you, Sister Vandy, your family,
[2:15:51] brother Deepac,
[2:15:53] somebody's going to see it.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; And your life is going to scream out.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; It's going to speak of another kingdom.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; It's going to speak of another place,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; going to speak of another world.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; And you people that are sitting here,
[2:16:08] you think you're just taking in another
[2:16:10] meeting. You're being transformed
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; from another world. Yes.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; I can I can tell you I can tell you on
[2:16:19] authority that that the word of God that
[2:16:22] was spoken, the word of God, not the
[2:16:25] word of a teacher, not a word of an
[2:16:27] instructor, not a word of a preacher,
[2:16:30] but the word of God
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; has transforming power.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; And you'll find yourself way different
[2:16:38] six months from now than you were. Why,
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Frank? Because the word of God
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; transforms a person
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; in spite of themselves.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; And the prophet speaks about it all the
[2:16:56] time. Only we miss it because he reaches
[2:16:58] into this world says once you were a
[2:17:00] gambler, once you were a drinker, once
[2:17:02] you and then he will say those are
[2:17:05] attributes of sin.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; But the word of God
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; will take those attributes away. will
[2:17:13] take take it away at its very source.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; I've had a man right here in in White
[2:17:19] Rock
[2:17:21] on a restaurant, a Greek man.
[2:17:26] He said he went in and and he smoked
[2:17:28] real heavy and he went in and to get a
[2:17:32] cigarette. He said that he was so
[2:17:36] something came over him and he drove a
[2:17:39] long distance to get to a church and he
[2:17:41] walked into a a Greek temple. I don't
[2:17:44] care what they walked into it. He could
[2:17:46] have walked into a doghouse.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Had nothing to do with the building. It
[2:17:50] has nothing to do with this building.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; It has to do with what your heart
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; is connecting to. Who are you connecting
[2:17:59] to?
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; WE'RE CONNECTING TO GOD. AMEN.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; We're connected to another kingdom.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm enthused about it.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; And that man told me with his own mouth.
[2:18:12] He said, "I tried to take a cigarette."
[2:18:15] He said, "It was the most awful thing. I
[2:18:19] couldn't even understand how he could
[2:18:21] ever smoke it." He wondered himself,
[2:18:23] "How can you ever smoke this stuff?" Did
[2:18:26] I try to witness to him? NO. I JUST
[2:18:28] thought that's just the gospel of Jesus
[2:18:31] Christ. I don't know how his heart is
[2:18:34] connected to where it's connected to,
[2:18:37] but I know that he's got a hold of
[2:18:39] something that's real and it's not of
[2:18:43] this world.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; All right. I think that I'm
[2:18:53] at a point where I can
[2:18:56] bring this in.
[2:19:06] Can I be a few more minutes, please?
[2:19:11] I just want to go back for a moment.
[2:19:19] You know, people talk about the
[2:19:23] the cross.
[2:19:26] Do you know that that was the focus of
[2:19:28] the entire world?
[2:19:34] This this whole
[2:19:38] uh physical world that we are in.
[2:19:43] Listen friends,
[2:19:46] I want to speak to you.
[2:19:49] One day,
[2:19:52] even you young men, one day you're going
[2:19:54] to find out
[2:19:58] that all of this is quite meaningless.
[2:20:02] We have all the music and but be one day
[2:20:05] when that'll be silenced.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; One day you're young and strong.
[2:20:15] Then you'll see the breath start to
[2:20:18] shorten.
[2:20:21] One day you're going to leave this
[2:20:23] world. And I say with the songwriter,
[2:20:27] what then?
[2:20:32] And I'm not preaching for time.
[2:20:35] I'm not preaching for this life.
[2:20:38] I'm not even here for this life.
[2:20:40] I feel very connected
[2:20:43] to another world
[2:20:46] and I feel like I'm a representative
[2:20:50] of that world.
[2:20:54] That's where God is.
[2:21:03] And I want to talk to you about as a
[2:21:05] representative of that world
[2:21:33] A phrase that you're very common with,
[2:21:36] very well known, noted with
[2:21:39] I just want you I woke up
[2:21:42] maybe two weeks ago and I've been
[2:21:45] pondering this ever since.
[2:21:51] And you're here because of a certain
[2:21:54] message that said this makes known to
[2:21:57] you the son of man.
[2:22:03] And this son of man died
[2:22:07] a full death.
[2:22:09] Exactly what is each person here.
[2:22:15] We're not going to live forever.
[2:22:20] Unless you have eternal life.
[2:22:24] And then besides the son of life, the
[2:22:27] son of man, there's another son and he's
[2:22:32] called the son of predition.
[2:22:37] And he also died.
[2:22:43] But there were certain things that the
[2:22:45] son of man said
[2:22:47] that the son of predition could not say
[2:22:50] and never did say.
[2:22:53] The son of man said
[2:22:56] because he rose again.
[2:23:00] And that's the key. That's the key.
[2:23:03] That's the key. And friends, this
[2:23:07] happens to be the critical part of the
[2:23:09] message. That's the critical part
[2:23:14] is the revelation
[2:23:16] that Jesus Christ
[2:23:18] is resurrected.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; And is here. Amen.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; And when a person gets that, it's all
[2:23:27] over
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; for that person. It's all over. Faith is
[2:23:31] then anchored and it can never stop
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; and it can never let go.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to get across to
[2:23:39] you.
[2:23:41] And the son of predition,
[2:23:43] his insides spilled out. He also died to
[2:23:47] death.
[2:23:49] But he could not say I'm alive.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; I was dead, but I'm alive.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; And one thing I want to get across to
[2:24:00] you today,
[2:24:02] especially,
[2:24:04] and I want you to listen very close.
[2:24:07] People think Judas betrayed him. I want
[2:24:11] to I want to I want to get that out of
[2:24:13] your mind.
[2:24:15] Judas did betray him. But the Bible
[2:24:17] says, "And a multitude,
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; and a multitude
[2:24:24] went to the garden."
[2:24:27] Judas was just the one that gave him the
[2:24:29] kiss of betrayal.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; But I I I have never heard a sermon on
[2:24:36] the multitude that went with him. Chief
[2:24:39] priests,
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; elders of the people. Amen.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; And now I want you to really listen.
[2:24:47] When Joshua called the people together,
[2:24:50] he said, "I'm old.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; This is where I'm at. I'm old and he's
[2:24:56] had stricken in age."
[2:24:59] Joshua
[2:25:01] 13.
[2:25:03] And the Lord told him, "You're old
[2:25:07] and you're stricken in age." It was
[2:25:10] seven years later. Seven years after
[2:25:13] that time, Joshua called all the people.
[2:25:17] He called you elders.
[2:25:20] He called you people who maybe come from
[2:25:22] the Philippines. He called them all. He
[2:25:25] called them all the people. He called
[2:25:28] the elders. He called the deacons. He
[2:25:30] called the trustees. He called the
[2:25:32] ministers. He called them all together
[2:25:36] to tell them, "I'm old." But God told
[2:25:39] him something else also. He said, "But
[2:25:42] there's much land
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; for you to possess.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's not over.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to go out
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; and do exactly what we've always done."
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Do you understand where I'm going?
[2:26:00] Nothing's changed.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; He intends for the church to do what it
[2:26:06] always has done. And he called him and
[2:26:09] said, "There's much land yet to
[2:26:11] possess."
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; And your land is things.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; It's not enough for me to tell you what
[2:26:20] I've experienced.
[2:26:21] This this thing has been nothing but a
[2:26:25] supernatural event from one to the
[2:26:27] other.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; And this is what he said.
[2:26:39] And after the supple
[2:26:43] part, this is not just a part of reading
[2:26:46] in the scripture. They went for a last
[2:26:48] supper and they had a last supper and
[2:26:51] then John laid his head on Jesus' bosom
[2:26:54] because Peter didn't have that closeness
[2:26:58] quite with the Lord that John had. And
[2:27:02] so he said, "Who is it that betrays
[2:27:04] you?"
[2:27:05] And he said, "Who I give the sub to?"
[2:27:08] The sub was a special
[2:27:11] part and he gave a sap to Judas and then
[2:27:16] said,
[2:27:18] "What thou doest do quickly
[2:27:22] and the Bible says
[2:27:24] then Satan entered into him." You know
[2:27:27] what, friends?
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether what you think
[2:27:31] about it, but I don't think he even knew
[2:27:33] it.
[2:27:36] There was nothing in this life.
[2:27:41] There was nothing in this body that was
[2:27:43] meant to contact this world. There was
[2:27:46] no sense.
[2:27:48] He didn't feel a shiver go down his
[2:27:50] back.
[2:27:53] He just
[2:27:55] thought things over and he thought,
[2:27:56] "Well, I can
[2:27:58] betray him."
[2:28:01] And he did the most
[2:28:03] vile thing he could ever do. He betrayed
[2:28:06] the Lord Jesus. But what [clears throat]
[2:28:09] about all those other people who were
[2:28:10] with him?
[2:28:21] to think about them. You want to read
[2:28:23] about them?
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; They had all levels.
[2:28:27] And your prophet, your prophet, I'm
[2:28:30] laying it at your door. Your prophet
[2:28:32] said he could go out and cast out devils
[2:28:35] and pray for the sick. In Matthew 10,
[2:28:40] he went and did all kinds of things. He
[2:28:42] sang the same songs.
[2:28:45] He maybe played the same instruments.
[2:28:49] He went to church. He was with the very
[2:28:52] disciples of the Lord Jesus.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you.
[2:29:00] Yet in his heart, he was not prepared to
[2:29:02] go all the way. And they said that he
[2:29:05] could not go up to Pentecost.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; He could not get sealed. My brother, my
[2:29:11] sister, I appeal to you.
[2:29:14] The answer is the Holy Spirit
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; anchors it in your heart.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; And the the Holy Spirit, you can't say,
[2:29:23] "Oh, it's God. I feel him." You don't
[2:29:25] feel him.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; It's God.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; You just know it because he said it.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; And in the good times and in the bad
[2:29:39] times,
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; he's always the same. whether it's in
[2:29:42] UBC or whether it's in the university or
[2:29:46] whether it's in uh the wherever
[2:29:52] we are
[2:29:54] what's it BCIT isn't it
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; BCIT
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; whether it's in BCIT or we become we
[2:30:02] become a we excel in a certain thing and
[2:30:06] I I can tell you
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends if Anybody should
[2:30:12] have been at the bottom of the stack.
[2:30:15] It's a man that's speaking to you now. I
[2:30:18] was at the bottom of the stack. I didn't
[2:30:20] excel in anything. But God opened the
[2:30:23] door.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; I talked to the woman that's sitting at
[2:30:27] the back of the church. I said, "I can't
[2:30:29] give you the kind of life that you've
[2:30:32] had."
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; God has called me
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; to preach. Amen.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; And I can't give you that kind of life.
[2:30:45] We sat in the back of her daddy's car.
[2:30:49] A friend of mine was driving the car
[2:30:53] in a muddy, muddy road come from a small
[2:30:57] town in northern Alberta.
[2:31:01] We came from a meeting.
[2:31:04] I don't know why she wanted to be in a
[2:31:06] meeting.
[2:31:08] She always wanted to be in a meeting. I
[2:31:10] was RAISED IN THE CAMPS in the US Army
[2:31:13] camps.
[2:31:17] I didn't have a dog. I had bears.
[2:31:22] Do you know what that kind of life is?
[2:31:24] You say, "Oh, that's a wonderful life
[2:31:27] out in the wilderness and the
[2:31:29] cleanness." I didn't know nothing about
[2:31:31] that. All I knew is about being lonely.
[2:31:37] friends. And people talk to me about my
[2:31:40] friends. My friends,
[2:31:44] what friends?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; What kind of friends are they?
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; You're better to have the wilderness as
[2:31:52] a friend.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Now you know a little bit about what I'm
[2:31:57] saying. Laying here in one of the
[2:31:59] hospitals, not knowing whether I'll come
[2:32:02] out.
[2:32:08] And then you you don't have any mistake
[2:32:10] about who it is that's talking to you
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; because there's only one in the in the
[2:32:17] universe that knows where you're at.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; And I don't know if I'm going to come
[2:32:23] out and see the daylight again.
[2:32:27] And I hear
[2:32:29] someone talking,
[2:32:32] talking so specifically, so clearly that
[2:32:37] I had to answer back.
[2:32:39] And you've heard this before, but not
[2:32:41] this way.
[2:32:43] Where were you?
[2:32:47] Where was I?
[2:32:50] I know I don't know hardly hardly how to
[2:32:53] answer it, but where were you? said,
[2:32:56] "Well,
[2:32:58] I'm laying
[2:33:01] going in for heart operation."
[2:33:06] And you think, "Well, there's all kinds
[2:33:07] of things to think about." No.
[2:33:10] Where were you? Well, where were where I
[2:33:15] I didn't even understand the question,
[2:33:17] but it keeps coming back.
[2:33:20] Where were you?
[2:33:23] Well,
[2:33:26] I was a young man
[2:33:29] and I was raised in army camps,
[2:33:33] but where were you?
[2:33:36] It seemed so persistent.
[2:33:39] I I didn't know what kind of answer it
[2:33:41] was. Well, I was
[2:33:45] and it kept coming until I thought maybe
[2:33:48] it's making reference to
[2:33:52] the prophet of God.
[2:33:54] I thought, well,
[2:33:57] I I I I I took Brother Brandham up the
[2:34:00] highway, the Alaskan Highway. Then, same
[2:34:04] voice. But where were you?
[2:34:08] And then I begin to feel
[2:34:11] I don't know how old how old are you?
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; 13.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; 13. I was younger. How old are you?
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; 11.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; Nine.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; 11.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; 11. I was about your age. Will you stand
[2:34:26] up for a second?
[2:34:29] I was about this boy's age.
[2:34:35] And he says, "Where were you?"
[2:34:38] You could say, "Well, maybe I was in
[2:34:41] Bellingham or I was at my mom and dad's
[2:34:43] place or something."
[2:34:46] I didn't have that memory.
[2:34:49] You can sit down. Thank you.
[2:34:52] I was about his age.
[2:34:55] Where were you?
[2:34:58] Excuse me.
[2:35:00] I said, "Well, I was about 10.
[2:35:05] I was about 10
[2:35:11] and I
[2:35:14] I saw myself
[2:35:16] in the snow and the cold.
[2:35:22] I was about 10.
[2:35:24] But where were you? I said I was at at
[2:35:27] mile 351 on the Alaskan Highway.
[2:35:33] But where were you?
[2:35:37] And then a picture all came to me. I saw
[2:35:41] that. That's where I was as a boy. And
[2:35:43] then [clears throat] when I was 27,
[2:35:47] 17 years later,
[2:35:50] I'm with the prophet of God. And I saw
[2:35:53] that time
[2:35:55] meant nothing.
[2:35:59] You know, maybe you're 16, 17, 18, and
[2:36:01] people over here,
[2:36:04] 60, 70, and maybe 80 years old. It
[2:36:07] doesn't mean a thing. It's
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; true.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean a thing. You guys are 16,
[2:36:13] 17, 14, 15, it doesn't mean anything.
[2:36:17] You young ladies,
[2:36:20] whatever age you are, doesn't mean a
[2:36:22] thing.
[2:36:23] Doesn't mean a thing.
[2:36:25] There's nothing between
[2:36:28] time.
[2:36:30] That's what I want you to get. That will
[2:36:33] really make this congregation a
[2:36:34] different place. But doesn't make a
[2:36:37] different place. Doesn't mean a thing.
[2:36:39] Here's brother Frank Fletcher. 92.
[2:36:42] You're 93 years old. Doesn't mean a
[2:36:45] thing. Your father and my father's the
[2:36:48] same age.
[2:36:52] My father and your father's the same
[2:36:54] age, Nathan.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; My dad and your father is the same age.
[2:37:02] You got a father back here that brought
[2:37:04] you into this world.
[2:37:09] But you have another father,
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; and he's the one I'm talking about.
[2:37:17] Amen.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "I I brought you here.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; I led you into this place.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; I led you to hear these words.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; It's my will that you hear these words."
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; That's the difference, brother.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm speaking about.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Where were you? Say, "But when you
[2:37:41] talked to me, that was the first time it
[2:37:43] really meant something."
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:52] You may say, "Well, my home I come from
[2:37:55] some place in China."
[2:37:59] It has nothing to do with it.
[2:38:02] I went to Cloverdale, Bible. It has
[2:38:04] nothing to do with it.
[2:38:07] I lived up it.
[2:38:11] That's why I felt I felt Brother Nathan
[2:38:14] to even be at your wedding.
[2:38:17] I thought it'd be good
[2:38:20] for what I've experienced
[2:38:22] is not very different from what you've
[2:38:24] experienced.
[2:38:27] Not very different from what the people
[2:38:29] in Flagstaff have experienced. Doesn't
[2:38:32] mean nothing to God.
[2:38:35] What means something to God is who has
[2:38:37] heard my voice.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what did you do?
[2:38:54] I just wish I could make it
[2:38:57] as real as it is.
[2:39:03] This God that I'm talking about
[2:39:07] has nothing to do with things.
[2:39:12] Cars that are out in the parking lot
[2:39:14] doesn't mean nothing.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean nothing.
[2:39:20] Our hardships,
[2:39:22] our trials
[2:39:24] doesn't mean nothing.
[2:39:28] He said, "I'll never leave you, Brother
[2:39:30] Darren.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you, Sister Jenny.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[2:39:37] you."
[2:39:38] That's not only in this life. That's at
[2:39:41] the very final breath of this life. And
[2:39:46] our Lord, your Lord,
[2:39:50] he hung on the cross. You say, "Well, I
[2:39:53] heard that, but don't let me put it that
[2:39:55] way." says, "Where were you?"
[2:39:59] "Well, I was hanging on a cross."
[2:40:02] "Who for?"
[2:40:05] "Well, there'll be a church full of
[2:40:08] people
[2:40:11] and there'll be a man
[2:40:14] up talking to them."
[2:40:16] And he's aged now.
[2:40:25] and he will have told Joshua a few years
[2:40:29] ago
[2:40:31] said you're getting old
[2:40:34] and you know what this word stricken is
[2:40:37] you've been introduced I've been
[2:40:39] introduced to a lot of things
[2:40:43] and that's why I'm so glad
[2:40:46] friends I'm not ashamed of it but I'm
[2:40:49] happy
[2:40:51] I'm happy
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; yes
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; for being around the people who didn't
[2:40:57] know the message and I was able to share
[2:41:00] it with them and now you can get it
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; in their language.
[2:41:07] You can preach it to them and just think
[2:41:11] about how happy they will be. You made
[2:41:14] it possible
[2:41:16] and you [clears throat] gave your little
[2:41:17] bit of tithes or whatever more
[2:41:38] And my Lord Jesus said, "While I was
[2:41:40] with them
[2:41:42] in the world,
[2:41:49] I kept them in your name."
[2:41:53] This is what your Lord said.
[2:41:58] Those that thou gavest me, those that
[2:42:00] you gave me,
[2:42:03] You've been given
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; by your father from another place.
[2:42:09] You've been given
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; to this word.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; You've been given
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; even to this congregation.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; You've been given to live
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; before these people. Amen.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I have
[2:42:28] I have kept them
[2:42:31] and I've lost none of them."
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; And none of them is lost.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; But the son of predition.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; I lost him.
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[2:42:50] in the prayer. He says that
[2:43:01] and that
[2:43:03] then when they came into the book of
[2:43:06] Acts,
[2:43:07] they said that he may take this ministry
[2:43:12] and apostilhip
[2:43:14] from which Judas by transgression fell
[2:43:19] that he might go to his own place.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; He was just one.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe you brothers will look it up.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; He was just one.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; But there was a multitude with him.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; And these were the people that were very
[2:43:38] very connected
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; to this world.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; They were elders. Elders of what? They
[2:43:46] were elders in this world. They were
[2:43:48] leaders.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Those of us that are given a place of
[2:43:55] leadership
[2:43:58] in this world, we do it with great
[2:44:01] humble humility.
[2:44:07] And I want to say to this congregation,
[2:44:10] are you all listening?
[2:44:12] These men that are deacons, these men
[2:44:14] that are trustees,
[2:44:16] do you know that they come here in the
[2:44:18] evening and they labor? Do you know that
[2:44:21] they're on the on the phones?
[2:44:26] And do you know that they're called
[2:44:29] when they have other things? I have
[2:44:30] families
[2:44:36] and I I know something about that,
[2:44:40] brother.
[2:44:44] Brother Ray,
[2:44:46] Michael Ray,
[2:44:48] everybody calls him to do something.
[2:44:53] Abigail, I [clears throat] understand
[2:44:56] what it is.
[2:45:00] You know, friends, I'm not here
[2:45:04] to bring you bring you a sob story, but
[2:45:06] I'm here to tell you what this gospel
[2:45:09] costs.
[2:45:21] I'll tell you what it costs. You know
[2:45:24] how many times I've been away from my
[2:45:26] family,
[2:45:28] over New Year's,
[2:45:31] and over Christmas,
[2:45:34] and over wedding anniversaries.
[2:45:37] And do you know that we saw my eldest
[2:45:39] daughter? I had to go by the hospital
[2:45:45] and we're on our way to the airport.
[2:45:49] My wife is saying, "I just can't hardly
[2:45:52] believe we're leaving her."
[2:45:57] But the gospel was calling
[2:46:00] these little people
[2:46:03] maybe in India or Africa.
[2:46:06] Somebody's calling. You say, "Well,
[2:46:08] you're just making that up." Not a
[2:46:10] chance.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; I was in Africa and they they a phone
[2:46:16] call come to a pastor's house said,
[2:46:19] "Your stepmother just died
[2:46:22] and the funeral is going to be in a day
[2:46:24] or two." I couldn't leave. I was to
[2:46:28] preach.
[2:46:30] I was to preach this gospel to people.
[2:46:34] And we're here. We're here this morning.
[2:46:39] And I hope it means something to you.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; I really do.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; If you think that
[2:46:48] if this church
[2:46:50] fails to pick up that vision, to pick up
[2:46:54] that burden, it will just reduce to
[2:46:56] another church.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; That's all it'll be.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Go to church. We'll hear the piano.
[2:47:04] We'll hear people sing. We'll hear, you
[2:47:06] know, hear stories and hear sermons and
[2:47:09] so on so forth.
[2:47:33] When Judas and the group came,
[2:47:36] don't forget the multitude
[2:47:39] multitude
[2:47:44] that was with him.
[2:47:47] And that's when Judas, that's when Peter
[2:47:50] drew his sword.
[2:47:54] And I want to tell you,
[2:47:56] God knew what was in his heart. And he
[2:47:59] struck the high priest's ear off. He
[2:48:03] wasn't aiming at his ear.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; He was aiming to split him down the
[2:48:07] middle.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; He had He was going to kill him.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Going to save his Lord.
[2:48:14] And sometimes our our motive motivation
[2:48:20] is
[2:48:21] and even then Jesus just said he didn't
[2:48:24] rebuke him. He said put up your sword
[2:48:28] Peter. They that live by the sword will
[2:48:30] die by the sword. That was all.
[2:49:02] Well,
[2:49:05] this isn't maybe exactly what you
[2:49:08] thought it was going to be.
[2:49:18] But when God spoke to Joshua, he said,
[2:49:21] he didn't want to tell him he was
[2:49:23] getting old.
[2:49:25] I want to tell you that I'm getting old
[2:49:29] and I've had
[2:49:31] [clears throat] a lot of age advancing
[2:49:33] on me.
[2:49:35] And the age has introduced me to
[2:49:39] sight problems,
[2:49:41] has introduced me to hearing problems,
[2:49:44] has introduced me to a lot of things
[2:49:48] that I have resisted over the years. But
[2:49:53] I feel that I must
[2:49:56] give time to my
[2:49:58] my family.
[2:50:02] And I want to just read in Joshua
[2:50:08] 24.
[2:50:10] It says he gathered all the people,
[2:50:13] all the tribes of Israel to Sheckchham
[2:50:16] and called for the elders of Israel
[2:50:20] and for their heads and for their judges
[2:50:23] and for their offices.
[2:50:26] And they pre presented themselves before
[2:50:28] God.
[2:50:30] And Joshua said unto all the people,
[2:50:33] "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, your
[2:50:37] fathers dwelt on the other side of the
[2:50:40] flood
[2:50:42] and time in old time, even Tara,
[2:50:47] the father of Abraham."
[2:50:50] You see, this was Joshua's time after
[2:50:52] Moses and all the rest of it. It meant
[2:50:54] nothing. Time was nothing.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I mean?
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. And here's God saying to Joshua,
[2:51:02] "Now you're old and you're stricken in
[2:51:06] age."
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean a thing.
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; Just doesn't mean a thing. God remains
[2:51:12] the same.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; God's purpose is going to be fulfilled.
[2:51:16] He's going to find a person. He's going
[2:51:18] to find men that will do it.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; That'll burn in their soul.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; And they can't shake it.
[2:51:30] And this is what God said. I took your
[2:51:33] father Abraham
[2:51:35] from the other side of the flood and led
[2:51:38] him throughout the land of Canaan. And
[2:51:40] the next verse, and I gave unto Isaac,
[2:51:45] Jacob, and Esau.
[2:51:47] And next verse, I sent Moses also, and
[2:51:51] Aaron, and I plagued Egypt. Was he going
[2:51:56] all down? Where were you?
[2:52:00] Number six.
[2:52:02] And I brought your fathers out of Egypt.
[2:52:05] That's 40 years later. Doesn't mean
[2:52:06] anything.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; I brought them out.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; And verse seven. And when they cried
[2:52:14] unto the Lord, he put darkness between
[2:52:17] you and the Egyptians. Oh, that was
[2:52:20] wonderful. No, they were there. That
[2:52:22] actually happened.
[2:52:26] He says, "And you dwelt in the
[2:52:29] wilderness a long season,
[2:52:34] and I brought you into the land of the
[2:52:37] Amorites. I brought you into these
[2:52:40] difficulties. I brought you into these
[2:52:42] battles. I brought you there
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; and I'll take you out.
[2:52:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't bring you in there to be bound.
[2:52:49] I didn't bring you in there to be
[2:52:50] defeated. I brought you into this
[2:52:53] difficulty.
[2:52:54] I thought of some of the difficulties
[2:52:56] that this congregation experienced and
[2:52:58] has experienced right now. And I can
[2:53:01] tell you, he brought us in and he brings
[2:53:04] us out.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; I brought you into the land of the
[2:53:08] Amorites and the N Gegosites and so on
[2:53:12] so forth. I brought you into these
[2:53:14] nations and I bring you out.
[2:53:21] And then Bailac, the son of Zapor, king
[2:53:24] of Moab, arose.
[2:53:27] God brought you before great
[2:53:29] authorities. And they said this, that,
[2:53:31] and the other thing.
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; But the same God that will see that king
[2:53:36] of Moab on a slab. Our God still lives.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still alive. [laughter]
[2:53:43] Hallelujah.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; You get my You get my point?
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; He's saying the same God that says,
[2:53:52] "You're old.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; You're stricken in age."
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; But he's the same God that says, "I
[2:53:57] brought the people in.
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; I brought you people in.
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; I brought you to this difficulty."
[2:54:04] You're in a problem. I brought you there
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; and I'll bring you out.
[2:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:12] Yeah,
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; I have such a rejoicing over that.
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve
[2:54:22] him in sincerity
[2:54:25] and truth.
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord.
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; Serve him. Serve me.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; Serve me.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:54:37] Don't go back
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; and be the same
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; same person at your job that you were.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm a son of God.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; My God brought me here.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; My father brought me here. And if I'm
[2:54:53] not where I ought to be, then take me
[2:54:55] out. Move me out from this place. Do
[2:54:58] whatever you want to do." Hallelujah.
[2:55:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And in that
[2:55:04] final hour, in that final test, you can
[2:55:07] just look up and you're at such peace
[2:55:10] and people say, "Oh, if I only had peace
[2:55:12] like that."
[2:55:17] Sometimes I don't even know. I think of
[2:55:19] things and I don't even know whether
[2:55:22] there was a young man
[2:55:25] and he was in our place of work and my
[2:55:28] wife came in to see me.
[2:55:32] Nathan, you want to hope you have this
[2:55:34] in the future.
[2:55:37] And my wife asked for me and I came
[2:55:40] running downstairs and hi dear, how are
[2:55:43] you?
[2:55:44] And this young man, he was about 19, 18,
[2:55:47] 19, standing right beside me. He said,
[2:55:50] "Boy, I wish I could smile like that at
[2:55:52] my wife."
[2:55:54] [laughter]
[2:55:57] And he you don't even know you're being
[2:56:00] at a testimony right then.
[2:56:03] Boy, hi dear. How are you? And here's a
[2:56:06] young man saying, "Boy, I wish I could
[2:56:09] smile like that at my wife." [laughter]
[2:56:14] You might just shake hands with another
[2:56:16] brother.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Or your father.
[2:56:22] Or your mother.
[2:56:26] God bless you, brother Mark.
[2:56:30] Something you said the other day about
[2:56:32] your son. I said he's a fine young man.
[2:56:36] You just said we're proud of him.
[2:56:41] That hung in. God bless you, Sister
[2:56:43] Sally.
[2:56:45] You've got your dad lives on.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're still a bomber.
[2:56:59] you young people. It's nice to see
[2:57:01] brother Doug, your daughter, and her
[2:57:03] husband Scotty.
[2:57:05] God bless you. Thank you.
[2:57:08] Shall we stand?
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just sing if we could please
[2:57:16] till we meet at
[2:57:21] Sorry for keeping you so long.
[2:57:25] Wonderful.
[2:57:33] I wonder, brother Derek, could you just
[2:57:34] come up and help me?
[2:57:46] You want to sing till we meet? Till we
[2:57:48] meet at Jesus feet. Okay.
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; Till [singing] we meet.
[2:58:11] [music]
[2:58:12] Till we meet.
[2:58:17] Will we be [music] at Jesus?
[2:58:33] [music]
[2:58:37] God [music and singing]
[2:58:38] [chant]
[2:58:39] be with you till we meet again.
[2:58:45] [music and singing] Till we
[2:58:50] [music]

[2:59:13] go [singing]
[2:59:16] with you till we meet [music]
[2:59:19] again.
[2:59:21] &gt;&gt; Now I'd like you to shake hands with one
[2:59:24] another as we sing the [music] chorus
[2:59:25] once again. Just once again and then
[2:59:27] I'll pray.
[2:59:29] Till we meet. [singing and music]

[2:59:38] Till we meet.
[2:59:42] And [music and singing] Jesus.

[3:01:44] Heavenly Father, [music]
[3:01:47] we've come to the closing moments of
[3:01:50] this time
[3:01:52] and we feel very connected
[3:01:56] to the eternal. [music]
[3:01:58] &gt;&gt; You are our father.
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; All things are
[3:02:04] uh within your hands [music]
[3:02:07] and you just deal with us so tenderly.
[3:02:11] You show us your will.
[3:02:14] You tell us we shall fulfill it all. We
[3:02:18] shall do it, oh God. And we're so
[3:02:22] thankful you've allowed us to have this
[3:02:24] piece of eternity
[3:02:26] here in this time. And you've allowed
[3:02:30] this message to cause [music]
[3:02:32] us to be merged with the eternal realm.
[3:02:37] Oh God,
[3:02:40] may the people see it. Father, may they
[3:02:43] go out of here walking knowing that they
[3:02:46] are eternal sons and daughters of the
[3:02:50] living God. Yes, we're here for a very
[3:02:53] short time, but [music] we are eternal
[3:02:56] beings. We're eternal sons and
[3:02:59] daughters. [music] Lord, when we greet
[3:03:02] one another, let it be a full
[3:03:05] understanding that comes our way in
[3:03:08] Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now, we
[3:03:11] pray, to be witnesses of [music] the
[3:03:14] eternal realm in Jesus Christ's name.
[3:03:18] Amen. Amen. You may be seated. You
[3:03:21] [music] may be dismissed. I mean,
