[0:01] amen uh just before we uh turn to the
[0:04] word and carry on with the scripture I
[0:07] thought I'd like to uh just also
[0:10] mention uh we we had a look at the
[0:14] website that our brother Robert Wilson
[0:17] has and it's really amazing what God is
[0:20] providing to especially English-speaking
[0:24] people uh and uh I'm maybe I'll just
[0:27] have you have your seats for just a
[0:28] moment it be easier this
[0:33] way we had an unusual thing in fact is I
[0:36] had never if You' have told me a few
[0:38] years ago that this is what I was going
[0:40] to experience I would could never have
[0:43] believed that uh such a thing was going
[0:47] to take place this is what
[0:49] happened uh since the work started in
[0:52] China which is about uh 12 to 15 years
[0:55] ago and then into Vietnam and our whole
[0:59] Focus was on India we printed in India
[1:02] for messages Untold Millions from
[1:07] 1980 81 all through up till just
[1:11] recently and then the the messages now
[1:15] have gone onto the internet and and
[1:17] what's called the message Hub and would
[1:21] would surprise you there's 60
[1:23] languages we have 60
[1:26] languages uh and it's and and as trans
[1:29] translators wherever they are in the
[1:31] world they could be in Mongolia they
[1:33] could be in uh Southern Tiff of South
[1:35] America they could be in the Arctic they
[1:37] could be wherever anywhere on Earth that
[1:40] they are translating they're just a
[1:42] certain format they have to put it in so
[1:44] the title's right that and the date and
[1:47] so on so forth and then they can they
[1:50] can just click it like that and that
[1:52] message goes on internet and can be
[1:56] accessed read printed listen to
[2:00] providing it's got a voice over at this
[2:03] time and many of them do not but many of
[2:06] them do there's Now 60
[2:09] languages on the internet this year just
[2:13] from 23 till now in the first part of
[2:17] May there was
[2:19] 1,1
[2:28] 145,146 send them out over the country
[2:31] which we did in
[2:33] India and uh people got books maybe they
[2:36] didn't even want but these are people
[2:38] who want books these are people who
[2:40] print the the book they want and the
[2:43] title they want and uh and so it and
[2:47] this this is a faith challenge report
[2:50] which is just printed I just got it off
[2:52] the press from the office just before I
[2:55] came and it it speaks about Uganda and
[2:59] Africa
[3:00] uh and the center spread is of China and
[3:04] then the next spread is the print
[3:07] stations in Mexico and let let me just
[3:10] you might just be here you say well I'm
[3:12] just a farmer I'm a
[3:15] mechanic this is a brother I've never
[3:18] met that I know of he wrote from
[3:21] Trinidad when he heard about the Hub
[3:24] station and on his own salary he bought
[3:29] Hub station
[3:30] the station the printer the whole thing
[3:32] is a printer is only about $5 $600 it's
[3:36] HP you can buy it at any Office Depot
[3:40] and they're workhorses they're a duplex
[3:43] printer and he takes those printers and
[3:46] a computer if he needs to to South
[3:49] America and has put print stations in
[3:52] every country of South America at his
[3:54] own
[3:57] expense and he just goes and he leaves
[4:00] he he leaves a he here's where we're
[4:02] going and he sends a report back and he
[4:05] says gone to Bolivia in Bolivia met this
[4:08] brother met that brother had a meeting
[4:10] met brother trained them in the hub
[4:12] station and and and loaded and
[4:15] downloaded something and then he puts
[4:17] mission accomplished he goes to the next
[4:19] place and that's a kind of repy
[4:22] sense but this is what has
[4:25] happened in in China the translators if
[4:29] I could just describe to you how
[4:30] diligent they are and I'm going to be
[4:32] very brief they started translating and
[4:35] they have a Bible that's called the
[4:37] union Bible of China and that's the one
[4:40] the government allowed them to have and
[4:43] I have to describe something to you
[4:45] friends China was in existence long
[4:47] before America was discovered you
[4:50] understand that and hundreds of millions
[4:53] and the Bible says that the eyes of the
[4:55] Lord go to and fro throughout the whole
[4:57] earth not just north America or America
[5:00] or Canada or Europe throughout the whole
[5:02] earth and there are people there that
[5:05] are so so intensely it just humbled me
[5:11] to tears to see people that were they
[5:14] were teachers they were professional
[5:17] people they were Common People
[5:20] everything you could imagine there's
[5:21] educated or more educated than any
[5:23] person in this building and I know that
[5:25] some of you are highly educated and they
[5:28] they go into a closet door and bring out
[5:30] little kindergarten plastic chairs
[5:34] because they have to be put away real
[5:35] quick if there's a wrong knock on the
[5:37] door and I know I was there my wife
[5:41] knows she was there and I happened to be
[5:43] there when the police walked in and the
[5:47] rest is history but we were in we were
[5:50] in prison for some days and that they
[5:53] will if there's a knock on the door and
[5:55] it's a wrong kind of knock and they look
[5:56] and say the police are here they put
[6:00] scoot all those chairs away and they get
[6:02] around a table have a cake and have a
[6:04] birthday having they're having a
[6:05] birthday gathering and there's a cake
[6:08] there and so on so the friends are here
[6:09] around this birthday we couldn't do that
[6:12] because there's about 80 people
[6:15] there and during the
[6:17] arrest but some of these
[6:20] people uh I will say almost all of them
[6:24] they they' they print these message
[6:27] books print finer books than we have
[6:29] here they actually said they didn't
[6:33] complain to me they don't complain to
[6:35] anybody they just said these books wear
[6:36] out too fast because they that's they
[6:39] they read them and pass them around and
[6:42] they print a book for the sake of giving
[6:44] it out and it just going like a prairie
[6:46] fire we can't even begin to keep track
[6:48] of it but they
[6:50] laminated beautifully laminated the
[6:52] covers the covers are just beautiful all
[6:56] different and they printed all their own
[6:58] books they don't ask for any help we
[7:00] give them help because we know that they
[7:03] need it but they they don't ask for any
[7:05] help they just say we'll do it ourselves
[7:08] and they print the books one little
[7:10] print station itself printed over 50,000
[7:13] books they burn out the they burn out
[7:16] the printers and all the rest to just
[7:18] replace it and keep on going but while
[7:21] they were doing that while they were
[7:24] translating several translators working
[7:27] under brother Murphy Wong and they would
[7:29] would find what the prophet of God and
[7:31] they so beli that prophet of God said
[7:34] this is what he said look in their Bible
[7:36] that's not what our Bible says so they
[7:39] diarize those errors and then they would
[7:42] look there's one scripture 1 John 5 and
[7:45] seven for there are three that bear
[7:48] record in heaven the word the uh the
[7:50] Father the word and the the Father the
[7:52] spirit and the word and these three are
[7:55] one that verse isn't even in the Bible
[7:58] that's true that verse which the prophet
[8:01] emphasized is not even in their Bible at
[8:05] all and and uh they found so many errors
[8:10] so they they began to diarize those
[8:12] errors unknown to me I didn't know it I
[8:14] wasn't aware of it at all and finally a
[8:17] Chinese brother who's a deacon in our
[8:19] church walked into my office and he
[8:21] wanted to know if he could just talk to
[8:23] me a few minutes and he told me how many
[8:26] 500 million people have cell phon
[8:30] he said the Chinese people have an
[8:32] insatiable insatiable desire to just
[8:35] read and they're reading walking down
[8:37] the street and reading some have two
[8:38] phones and they're just reading and he
[8:41] says we are going to make a Bible reader
[8:44] and a message reader so they can read
[8:46] the Bible and the message on a reader
[8:49] similar to what brother uh Wilson was
[8:52] saying today I didn't see
[8:55] that the but I heard a little bit of it
[9:00] and uh and and and then what they did
[9:04] was he
[9:05] said we are we're going to translate the
[9:10] Bible just floored me I said translate
[9:13] the Bible that's an enormous enormous
[9:16] task why are you going to translate the
[9:17] Bible they have it in Chinese no he said
[9:20] we haven't he got we got a King James
[9:23] but it's a it's a uni Bible they call it
[9:25] uni Bible and it's not accurate in fact
[9:29] is fundamental Christians real
[9:31] fundamental solid Christians in Hong
[9:33] Kong did the Old Testament and he says
[9:35] they've offered it to us just free just
[9:38] take it and have it and he says we're
[9:40] doing the entire New Testament and he
[9:42] said we'll be done by April that was a
[9:45] year ago April and that's how far they
[9:48] were along then they discovered there
[9:50] were so many errors in what these people
[9:53] had done even though they had improved
[9:55] it they did
[9:57] 30,000 Corrections
[10:00] in the Old
[10:01] Testament and so he said we're having to
[10:04] do it again and he said all I can tell
[10:06] you is that the uni Bible is nothing
[10:08] more than a reference
[10:10] book Believers discovered listen
[10:13] Believers Believers discovered the
[10:17] errors Believers are translating the
[10:20] entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[10:22] it's it's just right at the they're
[10:25] we're doing a proof reading right now at
[10:26] our office and believers are going to
[10:30] make this Bible available to the
[10:33] entire world Chinese population on the
[10:37] internet free it's going to be printed
[10:40] as a Bible and and also almost identical
[10:44] to what brother Wilson has this the
[10:48] search engine has already been finished
[10:51] and completed and the search engine will
[10:53] not only work in Chinese it'll work in
[10:55] any language but as a person is reading
[10:58] the Bible just catch this as they're
[11:01] reading the Bible and they see a little
[11:03] icon like to know what does this
[11:05] scripture mean they just touch that icon
[11:08] takes them right to the message Hub and
[11:10] has the prophet interpret that scripture
[11:12] for them prise Lord how do you like that
[11:17] that is well thought out we don't even
[11:19] have that
[11:21] ourselves as yet and takes them right to
[11:25] and then gives them a list of all the
[11:28] all the messages
[11:29] that brother Bram referred to that
[11:32] scripture and I thought that was quite
[11:34] remarkable they're just finishing just
[11:36] finishing it
[11:38] now we don't even have
[11:42] that how many remember the old books
[11:46] that Brother David momas
[11:49] did absolutely and that's the one I
[11:52] mentioned to you brother brother Robert
[11:55] that he did all of that work and it's
[11:59] it's been resurrected now because that's
[12:01] exactly what they needed to do and so
[12:04] they don't have to do it that's
[12:06] wonderful amen aren we rejoicing the
[12:10] Bible says that even the angels of God
[12:13] Rejoice over one Soul isn't that what he
[12:16] said so we're so thankful for it
[12:18] wherever they are whether it be in
[12:20] America or Europe or Canada or or over
[12:23] in Asia someplace we're just so thankful
[12:25] for it God bless you thank you for uh
[12:29] inviting us thank you for coming if you
[12:31] didn't come we wouldn't have much of a
[12:35] service and thank you for uh accept my
[12:39] apologies for the long service this
[12:41] morning and we uh we kind of put a lot
[12:44] in there and this evening might be a bit
[12:47] of a a little strange but at the end of
[12:51] this service today I'm going to give a a
[12:55] part of my
[12:56] testimony and to
[13:00] to maybe correct some things that have
[13:03] been improperly or wrongly propagated
[13:07] even on the internet and it's not
[13:09] accurate and the reason I can correct it
[13:12] is because I was
[13:16] there you know that song I was there
[13:18] when it happened and I guess I ought to
[13:21] know Hallelujah all right why don't you
[13:24] stand to your feet and we're going to
[13:26] just look to the Lord and then we're
[13:27] going to read a scripture and move along
[13:29] real quickly let's bow our heads father
[13:33] how we thank you for the kind
[13:36] warm of uh attention of the people thank
[13:41] you for the reception that we've been
[13:43] given and once again I pray that you
[13:45] will touch our precious brother Ivy Lord
[13:49] what a responsibility to pastor and in
[13:52] the condition you know exactly how to
[13:55] touch that nerve and how to heal it and
[13:58] to remove remove the pain I pray father
[14:01] in the name of Jesus you said whatsoever
[14:04] we ask that we should expect it that it
[14:07] will take place and so I believe that
[14:09] that is exactly what will take place
[14:12] just touch our brother father in a
[14:14] supernatural way and by whatever means
[14:17] you choose we just ask that you will do
[14:20] it and do a marvelous healing and for
[14:23] everyone that is here tonight Lord I
[14:25] pray that you will send a special
[14:28] portion and let us as we hunger after
[14:31] you and we do Hunger after you God be
[14:35] glorified in Jesus Christ name amen
[14:40] amen I'll have you turn with me to the
[14:42] book of Isaiah the 14th
[14:47] chapter this morning you
[14:50] recall
[14:53] uh I stressed the point that brother
[14:56] Brandon made he said in the back part of
[14:59] of God's mind you remember that I said
[15:03] the prophet you know whether it's future
[15:05] past or present it's irrelevant because
[15:08] God Is Timeless now we're going to read
[15:10] in Isaiah where the Prophet speaks
[15:14] about how art thou Fallen Lucifer how
[15:18] art thou fallen from Heaven how did he
[15:19] know he was fallen from Heaven he's Way
[15:22] Back Into The Eternity someplace and
[15:24] then John John in the Revelation he he
[15:28] advances it he goes forward and he sees
[15:30] them thrown into cast into the Lake of
[15:32] Fire yeah so I I mean you know with God
[15:35] we have to understand the kind of God
[15:36] that we have is he isn't he marvelous
[15:39] praise be to God so in the 14th chapter
[15:43] we'll just read in the 12th
[15:45] verse how art thou fallen from Heaven o
[15:48] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[15:52] cut down to the ground which this weaken
[15:55] the Nations for thou Hast said in thine
[15:58] heart I will ascend into heaven I will
[16:00] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[16:04] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[16:06] congregation in the sides of the north I
[16:09] will Ascend above the heights of the
[16:11] clouds I will be like the most high yet
[16:15] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[16:18] the sides of the pit and they that see
[16:21] thee shall narrowly look upon thee and
[16:23] consider thee saying is this the man
[16:26] that made the Earth to tremble that did
[16:28] Shake kingdoms you may be
[16:39] seated it's very very different I have
[16:41] never I only spoke this at my church one
[16:45] other place and it's just very very
[16:48] recent from last month but I want to
[16:51] speak to you on the evolution of
[16:55] Lucifer think about it a
[16:57] moment and
[16:59] uh a subject the characteristics of
[17:04] Lucifer brother brandham speaks in one
[17:07] place he talks about the evolution of
[17:09] the
[17:11] spirit and the the way that the Holy
[17:15] Spirit has worked from age to age and
[17:17] time to time but now I want to just draw
[17:20] your attention to the evolution of
[17:23] Lucifer
[17:25] because what what the prophet has said
[17:28] not once but many times he said we need
[17:31] to know our
[17:34] enemy and I want to ask you as a
[17:37] congregation do you know your
[17:40] enemy do you know him
[17:42] well the prophet said we need to study
[17:45] his
[17:46] moves study how he did things and study
[17:50] how he he said even a boxer will stand
[17:53] back as brother brandham was a boxer and
[17:56] stand back and study the other boxers
[17:58] licks he called it and how he move why
[18:01] so he doesn't get hit so he doesn't get
[18:04] he doesn't get pounded by that and I
[18:07] think we as Believers we sometimes have
[18:10] suffered some real hard knocks and we
[18:13] didn't need to we need to study him and
[18:16] say oh that's that's that's him and fact
[18:22] is in counseling we have counseled I
[18:25] have counseled many many people in my
[18:28] min history but and and you might be
[18:31] here this might just be for someone I
[18:32] didn't intend to say this but I have
[18:36] counseled uh and a person will be uh
[18:40] well in the medical world they would say
[18:42] they're manic depressant but that's not
[18:44] in the
[18:45] Bible that Spirit of depression is just
[18:47] nothing but the devil you say well that
[18:50] may be simplistic that's overs
[18:52] simplistic no I think you're over
[18:55] complicated if a person wants to take
[18:57] some brother B says you call it cancer
[19:00] it's a
[19:01] devil and I would say we need to heed
[19:04] him and he starts talking way back in
[19:06] the 50s how a how a cell becomes wounded
[19:10] and then it and then it attaches and
[19:11] fastens itself and then the enemy takes
[19:15] a hold of it and and he said it is a
[19:17] devil and for someone who had such
[19:20] success as he had at casting that demon
[19:23] Spirit out and the cancer dying I tell
[19:26] you what friends that's the message I I
[19:28] want to listen
[19:30] to and so now uh there have been these
[19:34] that have been they said well they're
[19:36] just I'm I'm depressed and there maybe
[19:39] somebody here goes through this and
[19:40] fights that I fight depression uh-huh
[19:44] and uh and I can tell you what happens
[19:46] and I just tell these people without
[19:48] knowing without necessarily knowing
[19:50] their individual situation I said you
[19:53] get up of a morning and maybe things
[19:55] don't go just exactly right but you you
[19:58] begin to feel just a heaviness just a a
[20:00] cloud and you just feel dark and heavy
[20:04] you they said we do I do I said that is
[20:08] that demon Spirit that's the presence of
[20:11] that one and now he's an opportunist and
[20:14] he just wait till this goes wrong and
[20:17] that goes wrong and you just go deeper
[20:19] and deeper and deeper and soon he's got
[20:21] control of your thoughts in your mind
[20:24] and you just go into pits of depression
[20:26] as soon as you feel that heavy wa you
[20:30] need to turn around and say I know
[20:33] you I've experienced that before and
[20:37] you've made my life miserable and now
[20:39] I'm identifying you and I am naming you
[20:42] that's why Jesus said what's your
[20:45] name you might as well know that's a
[20:48] mortal
[20:49] enemy and God is here to give you an
[20:51] absolute
[20:53] Victory and if you've ever been bothered
[20:55] with that and that fits a depression and
[20:57] whatever more sh Shake It
[21:00] Off Hallelujah I mean business friends
[21:04] I'm not here I'm not here to just
[21:06] exercise myself but I inan business
[21:09] shake that thing off say well I've had
[21:10] it for years that doesn't mean anything
[21:13] just shake it off be be rid of it refuse
[21:16] it what does the Bible say what does
[21:18] your Bible say my Bible says rebuke the
[21:21] devil or resist the devil and he will
[21:25] flee from you is that what it says we
[21:28] ought to
[21:30] Rejoice thank you
[21:33] Lord I'm going to take this subject from
[21:38] Lucifer to the
[21:40] serpent from the serpent to Satan and
[21:44] from Satan to the devil and from the
[21:48] devil to the
[21:49] dragon now we may think of oh the dragon
[21:53] some Fierce thing flaming fire out of
[21:56] its mouth no no no no the Greek word for
[21:59] Dragon is a fabulous animal fabulous
[22:04] animal now the Bible says how art thou
[22:08] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[22:11] morning son of the morning and the
[22:15] Hebrew word is Dawn yeah and as soon as
[22:18] I read that and heard that
[22:23] Dawn and the prophet said now the the
[22:26] message is the key and you're going to
[22:27] have to this is a this is a bit of a
[22:29] study but it's an incredibly important
[22:32] one because I want to on your behalf if
[22:37] if I'm able I pray that God will allow
[22:39] me to put something into your hand that
[22:42] will disarm him yes render him helpless
[22:47] that you go out those doors tonight that
[22:49] you'll be equipped such as you've never
[22:51] been equipped before say Satan I'm
[22:54] prepared to meet you and Stand My Ground
[22:57] I'm not going to be just defend now but
[22:59] I'll be offensive I have reason I have
[23:02] family I have friends I have children I
[23:05] have husband I have wife I have my own
[23:07] body to care for I am I'm going to
[23:10] resist you I'm going to effectively
[23:13] resist you according to the word of God
[23:17] you have another kingdom it's a kingdom
[23:19] of darkness but I am of the day I am of
[23:21] the light I'm of this resurrection power
[23:24] and you have no place with me whatsoever
[23:28] amen
[23:30] so over the years our Christian walk we
[23:33] have studied we've desired we have
[23:36] believed for the nature and character of
[23:40] Jesus Christ but the prophet said in
[23:43] questions and answers in 61 he said
[23:45] study the enemy what he's going to do
[23:49] what's his move and then know how to
[23:52] meet him and he said and that's what
[23:55] we're here for now I've preached here
[23:57] several times but I've never preached on
[24:00] study your enemy but tonight this is not
[24:03] a negative this is not a negative
[24:05] message this is a positive message and
[24:08] you need to know and the prophet said
[24:10] study your enemy I can tell you he
[24:12] certainly knew he certainly had studied
[24:14] him and he said that's what we're here
[24:16] for and study your enemy's moves and
[24:18] knowing how to meet him and the thing
[24:20] that will overcome
[24:22] [Music]
[24:25] him so the word of God is always the
[24:27] focus of Satan's attacks
[24:30] yeah the message and the Integrity of
[24:33] the message and the Integrity of the
[24:35] revealed word is being questioned by
[24:39] some right in this message is being
[24:42] questioned and now they have the tool of
[24:45] internet and all of these access and
[24:49] bring it into people's homes and so
[24:51] doubt Satan is using these Technologies
[24:55] to to the ultimate and maximum purpose
[24:58] purpose for the kingdom of darkness and
[25:01] we need to I'm not I'm not interested so
[25:03] much in the technology for the kingdom
[25:06] of God As I Am that God chose to preach
[25:09] the word and the word that we preach
[25:12] being the truth has got power to
[25:14] overcome
[25:16] that and God's not going to have any of
[25:18] his children deceived but they are using
[25:22] all of these things and this is part of
[25:23] the reason why I perhaps will give
[25:26] testimony tonight the
[25:28] Prophet said that he speaking of Satan
[25:31] hates all scripture and it's the whole
[25:34] Canon of scripture but if anything he
[25:37] desires mostly is
[25:39] revelation that that he despises I'm
[25:41] sorry he despises mostly is revelation
[25:45] in Genesis because Genesis tells the
[25:48] beginning and Revelation reveals what's
[25:50] going to happen to him in the last
[25:53] [Applause]
[25:54] day and to understand the subject we
[25:56] need to start at the beginning and in
[25:59] the beginning God the SCP the prophet
[26:02] says God was alone with his thoughts in
[26:05] the beginning God dwelt Alone with his
[26:09] attributes and that's his thoughts there
[26:12] was nothing just God alone but he had
[26:15] thoughts yeah he created the angels to
[26:20] worship him right and the angels
[26:23] worshiped him and he said and that made
[26:25] him God he said his own being now if you
[26:28] have a question and you want to jot down
[26:30] some places of scripture that's
[26:32] perfectly fine as well because I have
[26:34] some scripture uh some locations in
[26:37] Scripture that might be of very interest
[26:40] to you Keen interest to you but he said
[26:43] he his own being created creatures to
[26:47] worship him
[26:49] right he said to my opinion the first
[26:52] thing that he made was angels and then
[26:55] they worshiped him and that made him God
[26:58] and he started from there yeah he
[27:01] created angels so he could be God
[27:05] right he said in order to be God there
[27:08] had to be something to worship him so he
[27:11] created angels and beings and cherubims
[27:14] and so forth to worship him now you may
[27:17] think that I'm repeating being repe
[27:19] repetitious but not so because there are
[27:22] some added added words so he created
[27:25] cherubims and seraphim an order of
[27:28] Angels in fact and Lucifer was part of
[27:32] the Heavenly creation you followed me
[27:35] now have you God was alone with his
[27:38] thoughts now he's got a host of angels
[27:42] and Lucifer was one of those from the
[27:45] initial Creation in fact is uh I will
[27:49] give you a quote in a few minutes where
[27:52] brother brandham says
[27:54] this and it certainly ties in with
[27:56] Isaiah saying the son of the Dawn yeah
[28:01] perhaps the dawn of
[28:03] creation and the prophet said that the
[28:05] only thing that Satan couldn't do was
[28:08] create yeah he couldn't create right I
[28:13] believe in my own heart of hearts is not
[28:15] a Doctrine I just believe that he was
[28:17] standing there while God's word went
[28:21] out and through Jesus Christ he created
[28:26] all things and with without him was
[28:28] nothing
[28:30] created you believe
[28:32] that so the scripture tells us now that
[28:35] there was war in heaven and Michael and
[28:37] his angels fought against the dragon and
[28:40] his angels and the dragon fought in his
[28:43] angels and prevailed not neither was
[28:46] their place found anymore in
[28:50] heaven I asked the question why was
[28:53] Satan cast out into the Earth and his
[28:56] angels with him I mentioned this morning
[28:59] why was he not cast to perhaps the outer
[29:03] reaches of the uh so the universe and
[29:07] into some dark abyss why wasn't he why
[29:11] wasn't he well he was cast in fact is it
[29:14] it is a great plan yeah I personally
[29:19] believe that time was
[29:21] created and creation took place to draw
[29:26] Satan into this uh alltime battle
[29:30] because I believe that God has set aside
[29:32] this time to destroy him I don't want to
[29:36] go to a heaven where there's another
[29:38] War amen I want to go to heaven knowing
[29:42] Satan has been destroyed annihilated all
[29:46] his angels everyone he deceived and that
[29:49] we are free from
[29:52] sin and that's what God's promised
[29:58] so why was he cast to the earth now you
[30:03] can you'll have to listen to the whole
[30:06] service very
[30:07] closely because the
[30:10] battle that started in heaven was not
[30:14] one yet right your Prophet said and I
[30:18] keep saying your Prophet so you'll know
[30:19] it's not me saying it your Prophet said
[30:22] that the battle that was Angels Angels
[30:26] battle fell on hum
[30:29] humans how many humans do we have
[30:33] here oh we got a
[30:37] few your Prophet said the Battle of
[30:41] angels fell on you
[30:44] yeah come on you're you're not going to
[30:48] you're not going to just get mind over a
[30:49] matter and say you know well I I don't
[30:52] have it no no the that battle fell upon
[30:56] humans we are humans
[31:02] so he said the the this great first
[31:04] battle that was ever fought begin in
[31:07] heaven when Michael and his angels
[31:10] fought against Lucifer and his angels it
[31:13] first started the first battle was in
[31:15] heaven so sin did not originate on Earth
[31:18] it originated in heaven and then was
[31:21] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[31:24] Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[31:28] beings then the battle from Angels
[31:31] became human battles and he said another
[31:34] place has been raging ever
[31:39] sense amen doesn't matter how quiet you
[31:42] are it's still the
[31:44] truth still the
[31:46] truth God sent a messenger to alert us
[31:49] to
[31:51] this right and if we don't know and we
[31:55] don't understand and we don't make it
[31:57] our business or we don't it might well
[31:59] be that we live a defeated
[32:02] life and Satan can defeat a person with
[32:05] a lot of
[32:07] things he can he brother Brown says he
[32:10] take some to an early
[32:12] grave it's not God's will say oh well
[32:15] you know I can't go till God pulls my
[32:17] number well that's only part of it the
[32:20] other thing he said some go to early
[32:23] grave don't let them go he prays that
[32:26] and then some some are taken by success
[32:31] yeah you know that Satan uses success
[32:34] right so oh I you know I've got to keep
[32:36] reaching out here because I've got
[32:38] scholarships and I've got this and I've
[32:40] got what about a scholarship in the word
[32:42] of God what's wrong with that what's
[32:44] wrong with studying this what's wrong
[32:47] with studying and knowing the enemy and
[32:49] say I faced you
[32:51] before uh yeah you've tried that before
[32:53] come on you you've got a friend of mine
[32:56] you've got a family member of mine do
[32:58] you have someone you should be praying
[32:59] for do you have someone we should have
[33:01] victory over I believe that the the
[33:04] prophet also said that God hates a
[33:05] powerless
[33:06] church he expects the church I've given
[33:09] you power don't live
[33:12] powerless
[33:14] amen now now you you can believe with I
[33:18] I'll tell you in advance Satan doesn't
[33:20] want me to preach this but I'm going to
[33:21] preach it
[33:24] anyway he doesn't want to be exposed
[33:28] he'd sooner have us ignorant about his
[33:30] moves about his tactics but we won't be
[33:33] so now the first the first human that
[33:36] this battle fell
[33:39] upon was Adam's
[33:42] wife she was the first human to come
[33:45] under the
[33:47] effect
[33:49] yeah and the prophet said I'm going to
[33:51] give you the quote later on the pro
[33:54] brother Brenham said that Satan Lucifer
[33:58] was right next to
[34:01] God you recall that said he was his
[34:05] right hand
[34:07] man almost
[34:11] co-equal only in creation he could not
[34:15] create listen friends he our Prophet
[34:18] said he was a Slicker don't try and
[34:20] debate with him he knows more about the
[34:23] Bible than we do you talk about worship
[34:26] he was created to worship
[34:28] he knows all about worship and that is
[34:31] why even even into even into the music
[34:34] realm and the Arts realm and that's why
[34:36] he dwells there yeah Prophet even said
[34:40] that Hollywood was his was the seat of
[34:43] Satan right he just moved it from Paris
[34:47] or
[34:48] someplace so now Lucifer needed a
[34:53] vessel Lucifer needed a vessel I hope
[34:56] you can follow me
[35:00] and so he who stood right next to God in
[35:05] heaven and is cast down now he goes and
[35:10] there's a God on the earth which is Adam
[35:13] the Son of
[35:14] God and he takes and he takes and uses
[35:18] the vessel that's right next to him who
[35:23] is the serpent The Serpent and it took a
[35:26] prophet to expose it he is not a
[35:29] snake he's a
[35:31] creature and he says perhaps more
[35:34] handsome and more uh appealing than Even
[35:39] Adam what kind of a creature and he
[35:42] stood on his
[35:43] feet what kind of a being and and and
[35:48] Satan Lucifer knew he was the only one
[35:51] with seed that would
[35:54] mingle with the woman you talk about an
[35:58] intelligence he knew some things so now
[36:01] the one that was right next to God in
[36:03] the heavens and is cast down Earth he
[36:06] goes right next to the one that was next
[36:08] to man and uses him as a vessel and
[36:13] approaches not him but her right because
[36:17] he didn't have the he didn't have the
[36:20] facility she had the facility to carry
[36:23] the seed
[36:25] right right amen Lord oh my I'm just
[36:30] holding back a little bit
[36:33] friends Satan when he came to Jesus
[36:36] Christ he came to the m Jesus Christ
[36:40] overcame
[36:42] him and stripped him and it is Jesus
[36:46] Christ speaking through this messenger
[36:49] you want to listen to me now and saying
[36:52] to you making a declaration your Mo womb
[36:56] is sealed
[36:57] [Music]
[36:59] Hallelujah he can come and with all of
[37:01] his attacks and do whatever he might do
[37:04] and pass thoughts through your mind and
[37:06] torment you and Hound you and all the
[37:09] rest of it but the elect of God cannot
[37:13] receive his
[37:15] seed because Jesus Christ died to seal
[37:19] your womb your mental womb Hallelujah do
[37:23] you believe that you believe that sealed
[37:28] thank God I'm sealed sealed
[37:32] sealed there's nothing else in this
[37:34] world that'll do
[37:37] it so he chose the closest thing to the
[37:40] human race the
[37:43] serpent now Lucifer is the son of the
[37:47] morning that's his
[37:50] characteristic the son of the morning
[37:53] don't confuse them all now now he comes
[37:56] and uses
[37:58] the facility of The Serpent and the
[38:00] serpent even the name indicates he was
[38:04] one of
[38:06] cunning and the and even the
[38:10] name means uh
[38:14] divination so
[38:16] now just being the son of the morning
[38:18] that isn't going to work down here right
[38:22] he has to use that cunning
[38:25] deception on Eve's mind
[38:29] and he has a question I want you to be
[38:33] fully awake now on he has a
[38:36] question and
[38:38] many some have raised up in the message
[38:41] with a question yeah you can have a
[38:45] question I've had questions but this is
[38:48] a question with an agenda behind it
[38:51] right the agenda is to get this person
[38:54] to disbelieve am and I I can Proclaim
[38:58] and tell you that there are those that
[39:00] have raised up that within the message
[39:04] and they're asking questions but the
[39:06] question is to get the people who read
[39:08] the question to disbelieve the
[39:11] word if you agree you can say
[39:15] amen and I say to you give no place to
[39:19] the devil I wouldn't even take time to
[39:23] read the
[39:24] garbage I don't I really don't I'm just
[39:27] been made aware aware of others that are
[39:30] tormented by
[39:33] it come
[39:35] on and whatever you
[39:39] do don't give me the impression that you
[39:42] don't know anything about
[39:46] it be truthful say yeah I'm aware of it
[39:51] and I will say to you give no room to
[39:53] him give no space to
[39:56] him I do with people that they spend
[39:58] their time reading all about all the
[40:01] trash and stuff that all the accusations
[40:03] and everything
[40:05] else why why why waste our time with
[40:09] that you spend that kind of time
[40:11] studying the
[40:13] message
[40:16] on and all these Network things hundreds
[40:20] and hundreds of millions tell your
[40:22] friends Hello
[40:24] friends tell my friends there all those
[40:27] people out there aren't my friends
[40:29] they're not your
[40:35] friends
[40:37] hallu angels are skilled in worship
[40:40] friends come on yeah they're skilled in
[40:42] worship
[40:49] right that's what they were made
[40:53] for so now here's brother bram's
[40:56] description I i' I've gone to a lot of a
[41:00] lot of work to have this just
[41:03] down
[41:05] concise he said the serpent which was a
[41:07] being more like a
[41:10] man all right that's right upon his feet
[41:14] just like a man yeah in heaven Lucifer
[41:19] was right next to God and on Earth he
[41:21] entered and used the serpent which was
[41:23] right next to man who was God of the
[41:26] Earth
[41:29] and in the mark of the beast he said
[41:30] Satan could not have been the serpent he
[41:33] said Satan could not have been the
[41:35] serpent said in Corinthians it speaks
[41:38] the Bible said that transformed himself
[41:41] into an angel of Light he said you just
[41:45] underestimate Satan we don't want to do
[41:48] that we don't want to underestimate him
[41:51] we're not glorifying him we don't want
[41:53] to underestimate him he's our enemy he's
[41:55] an arc enemy he's God's enemy he's a
[41:58] prophet's enemy he's the enemy of this
[42:02] message he said if he could come into
[42:05] the kind of substance like being made an
[42:09] angel of Light and here's what brother
[42:10] bam says if he could come into that kind
[42:12] of substance then why could he not come
[42:15] into a beast the next thing to a man
[42:19] next thing to a man yeah so now notice
[42:23] Satan changes his
[42:25] mask Corin says Paul speaking in
[42:29] Corinthians lest Satan should get an
[42:31] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[42:35] of his
[42:36] devices we know his scheme in other
[42:38] words we know his
[42:41] methology we understand it says put on
[42:45] the whole armor of God that you may be
[42:47] able to stand against the Ws of the
[42:50] devil is that the scripture put on the
[42:52] whole armor of quad that you might be
[42:55] able to withstand the wild of the devil
[42:58] and the Ws of the Devil is a is the
[43:00] scheming or the craftiness the strategy
[43:03] and the deceit for we wrestle not
[43:06] against flesh and blood but against
[43:08] principalities against Powers against
[43:10] the rulers of Darkness of this world and
[43:13] against spiritual wickedness in high
[43:15] places how the prophet says know your
[43:17] enemy he said a real good fighter
[43:20] usually knows and studies his opponent
[43:23] he studies his licks or his blows right
[43:29] study the enemy and the questions and
[43:31] answers again he said what's he going to
[43:33] do what's his move and then know how to
[43:36] meet him and that's what we're here for
[43:41] yeah come
[43:43] on now I had some slides but I think
[43:46] I'll just omit these these first
[43:50] slides he says in the Seal of the
[43:54] Antichrist the rightand man of almighty
[43:57] God was Lucifer the son of the morning
[44:01] the
[44:03] first I want this congregation and think
[44:05] of that the
[44:07] first
[44:10] yeah let's think about that a moment the
[44:13] right-hand man of almighty God was
[44:16] Lucifer the son of the morning or the
[44:18] son of the Dawn the first
[44:23] yeah I assume and I believe that perhaps
[44:26] he was the first one
[44:28] created and the Bible the prophet said
[44:31] in another place in the beginning when
[44:33] God spoke and Satan was standing there
[44:35] and heard it in the beginning when God
[44:39] spoke yeah Satan was standing there and
[44:42] heard
[44:43] it so he saw that
[44:46] word let the let there be
[44:50] light
[44:52] yeah I don't know aons of time when
[44:55] light appeared
[44:59] let the Earth bring forth all
[45:01] right let the water dry
[45:04] up and he sees the Power this word of
[45:08] power going forth and the prophet said
[45:11] to give you some concept to give you a
[45:14] concept and I think we need this I
[45:16] really do I believe we need this to give
[45:18] us some concept we also want to know our
[45:22] God he said uh uh like a little sacred
[45:26] light way back when he was
[45:28] alone uh sa how can the prophet go back
[45:32] well Isaiah went back Ezekiel went back
[45:35] John went
[45:36] forward I don't have any trouble so the
[45:39] prophet went back way back in the back
[45:41] part of God's mind way back when God was
[45:43] alone and he said to give you some
[45:45] concept in Christ the mystery he said
[45:48] because this great being that fills all
[45:50] time and space fills the space between
[45:53] you and
[45:55] I sometime we want pray and I ask oh God
[45:58] send your virtue down his virtue and all
[46:01] of his attributes are right here closer
[46:03] than your
[46:05] breath if I get you to see that be be
[46:08] nothing impossible for us you get this
[46:11] group of people to believe that be
[46:13] absolutely nothing impossible all
[46:16] healing Mercy forgiveness is everything
[46:19] God God fills all time and
[46:24] space Hall hallah
[46:27] is fill this fill this building with all
[46:30] the attributes of God no wonder the
[46:33] prophet so strain if he could just get
[46:35] the people to accept that to receive it
[46:38] it was right here and it just speak the
[46:40] word and if they would believe it
[46:42] whatever they would whatever you would
[46:43] say it'll
[46:45] happen according to his
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] will
[46:54] amen hallelujah thank you Lord
[46:59] and Satan was standing
[47:03] there and the prophet Isaiah picked up
[47:05] the
[47:07] scene and he says Lucifer
[47:11] said I'll
[47:13] Ascend yeah I'll do that
[47:17] yeah that was the only thing that he
[47:19] couldn't do so he lusted after that
[47:21] power of the spoken

[52:05] word is Satan is not very far away he's
[52:08] right there handy he wants that he
[52:11] desires that and he despises the fact
[52:14] that you as a little a little piece of
[52:16] dust as a human can believe God and have
[52:19] that spoken word act and he can't make
[52:22] it

[52:29] preach
[52:31] anyway so he comes down and now he's
[52:33] with the serpent and he he works let
[52:36] let's just follow that guy that serpent
[52:38] for a
[52:39] moment the serpent to practice
[52:42] divination Insight or foretelling like
[52:46] he always like he has some kind of
[52:48] wisdom seeking knowledge by Supernatural
[52:51] means to discover hidden
[52:54] knowledge this is his nature I'm talking
[52:56] about the characteristics of
[53:00] Lucifer in the mark of the beast he says
[53:03] further Satan was kicked out of heaven
[53:05] and came to the Earth there was nothing
[53:07] else he could do he could get into the
[53:10] animal would be too far from him seed
[53:13] wouldn't mix so he had to get into this
[53:16] serpent which was a being more like a
[53:19] man yeah he was the most subtle most
[53:23] shrewd cunning wisdom smarter than the
[53:26] animal he was right next to the man now
[53:31] you he didn't he hear it from Brother
[53:33] Bisal you heard it from the prophet of
[53:34] God right next to the man in the
[53:37] questions and answers he said in 64 he
[53:39] said the Satan the serpent almost
[53:44] almost almost had a
[53:49] soul it's impossible for us to determine
[53:53] how close that
[53:54] was almost had a soul and he stood upon
[53:58] his feet just like a man he says then
[54:00] that seed which was next to the human
[54:02] seed and he goes on to say and you
[54:04] better believe this Satan himself the
[54:07] spirit knew that there was only one seed
[54:10] the that that was the only seed that
[54:13] would pregnate the
[54:15] woman hey that's how we got into the
[54:18] human
[54:19] race but now listen closely and the
[54:23] serpent I want to say the serpent in
[54:25] Moses Ministry Moses the first word
[54:30] Prophet oh my you've got to let me
[54:33] preach folks the first word Prophet the
[54:37] people had heard the voice of God in the
[54:39] mountain and the prophet says so many
[54:41] times they said don't let God speak to
[54:44] us anymore that's too fearsome you speak
[54:47] you go up and meet him you hear him and
[54:49] then come and speak and that was the
[54:51] first time Moses is the first prophet of
[54:54] that nature and he hears the word of God
[54:57] speaks and God speak mouth to ear to him
[55:01] and sends him down and speaks of the
[55:04] people on and when Moses first heard saw
[55:09] the pillar of fire and met that God in
[55:12] the burning bush I'm the god of Abraham
[55:14] the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob
[55:16] take off your shoes you're standing on
[55:19] Holy
[55:21] Ground on he says I'm going to send you
[55:25] I've heard the Cry of the people I'm
[55:26] going to send you yeah and he now he
[55:29] begins to make excuse says what's in
[55:32] your
[55:32] hand
[55:34] Rod cast that rod and it become a
[55:38] serpent
[55:42] serpent hallelujah hallelujah because
[55:44] the serpent you're looking at me
[55:47] earnestly the serpent had already been
[55:50] judged and God spoke to the serpent and
[55:54] said because you have on this I'm
[55:57] putting enmity between you and a woman
[56:00] and between her seed and your seed
[56:04] anybody ever disputes with you about the
[56:05] serpent seed take them to Genesis 3:16
[56:08] and say what does this mean but what is
[56:11] this seed I'll put enmity between you
[56:13] and the woman and between your seed and
[56:16] her seed and the seed woman doesn't have
[56:19] a seed as a prophet has said but she has
[56:21] a
[56:22] field she has a field
[56:27] Hallelujah love to preach you right now
[56:29] on the field of
[56:31] Boaz Hallelujah Ruth was boaz's field we
[56:36] are the bridegroom's field he SS his
[56:40] seed Hallelujah you were meant for his
[56:44] seed you were not meant for the
[56:47] Serpent's Seed and so God through Jesus
[56:50] Christ announced To Us by a messenger
[56:53] your mind your SE move womb has been
[57:00] sealed Hallelujah because it was made
[57:03] for one
[57:04] seed Glory thank you Lord you might have
[57:07] known others who were in the
[57:09] denomination but their seed wouldn't
[57:11] work they were dead and Jesus went
[57:14] because you were United to sin by birth
[57:17] you were born in sin right shaped in
[57:21] iniquity and the only way in invisible
[57:24] Union we that was our first First Union
[57:27] and Jesus Christ that Union could only
[57:30] be broken by
[57:32] death that's the only way your union
[57:34] could be broken every man woman and
[57:37] child in this place and on Earth was
[57:40] born in sin and shapen in iniquity and
[57:43] married to that sinful
[57:46] nature that was the first husband and in
[57:49] order to have a legal separation from
[57:51] that husband he had to die and so our
[57:55] lord Jesus Christ came and went to
[57:58] Calvary and died to break that
[58:02] Union and set you and I free thank
[58:06] Hallelujah and he rose again so the
[58:09] Apostle Paul said so you can be married
[58:11] to another even Jesus Christ raised from
[58:15] the dead and bring forth fruit unto
[58:19] him oh my goodness Hallelujah help me
[58:24] out Hallelujah
[58:26] thank you
[58:28] Lord hallu glory and Satan was the
[58:32] serpent the serpent now we're saying
[58:34] Satan but we don't want to Interchange
[58:36] the names the
[58:38] serpent he said he's already been judged
[58:42] and so when he put it on the ground it
[58:44] became a serpent and the Bible says and
[58:47] Moses fled from it says take it up by
[58:50] the tail he reaches down takes it by the
[58:52] tail and it becomes a rod again becomes
[58:55] as his staff again and the staff was
[58:58] always an emblem of the word of
[59:02] God now I may create more questions than
[59:05] I will answers but I want you to think
[59:08] of it'll set you thinking and it becomes
[59:10] a rod again then he comes before pharaoh
[59:13] and the prophet said Satan was in
[59:16] pharaoh and God was in Moses you believe
[59:20] that God was in Moses God is in you God
[59:24] was in Moses Satan was in pharaoh and so
[59:27] Moses does uh uh one of the plagues a
[59:31] cheap magician trick come on magicians
[59:33] they do the same thing false anointed
[59:35] ones Moses did something they did
[59:38] something he did something they did
[59:40] something he cast down his Rod it become
[59:43] a snake yeah they cast their rods down
[59:48] they become snakes right and his snake
[59:51] snake his serpent swallowed all theirs
[59:55] up yes sir and the prophet said what did
[59:58] Moses do he said he took the rod that
[1:00:01] had just swallowed all theirs up and
[1:00:02] went out and went out in the wilderness
[1:00:04] and did Miracles with it
[1:00:11] hallelujah our trouble is we got too
[1:00:13] small a
[1:00:14] God
[1:00:16] hallelujah
[1:00:18] hallelujah I'm going to grind it down
[1:00:20] friends going to say strong things he
[1:00:22] said strong things I'm going to repeat
[1:00:24] what he said he said Sin Sin there isn't
[1:00:28] anybody free from sin but sin he said
[1:00:31] once it's confessed when it's confessed
[1:00:34] I'm talking about a real confession it
[1:00:36] drops into the bleach of the blood of
[1:00:39] Jesus Christ and he says and you cannot
[1:00:42] find it again because it breaks up it
[1:00:45] breaks up it's even even the
[1:00:47] construction of of the chemistry breaks
[1:00:50] up and you can never put it back
[1:00:52] together again you can never find it
[1:00:55] again and he says furthermore that it
[1:00:57] actually becomes
[1:01:00] bleach Hallelujah and you'll never find
[1:01:02] it again say well I don't know if my
[1:01:05] God's that big well my God is that big
[1:01:07] you can never find it again no use
[1:01:10] praying and asking God to remember
[1:01:12] something in the past that he's already
[1:01:14] forgotten Hallelujah he has the capacity
[1:01:17] to completely forget and annihilate the
[1:01:20] thought of it Hallelujah that's my God
[1:01:23] Amen Hallelujah
[1:01:27] amen thank
[1:01:29] you so Aaron threw it down the rod of
[1:01:32] Moses before pharaoh and it became a
[1:01:35] serpent and demonstrating that the
[1:01:37] serpent identified sin already judged he
[1:01:43] was demonstrating before Pharaoh this is
[1:01:46] already judged and Moses serpent
[1:01:48] swallowed theirs up and the Bible says
[1:01:51] in Moses also that Moses made a serpent
[1:01:55] of
[1:01:56] grass and put it upon a pole and it came
[1:02:00] to pass that if a serpent had bitten any
[1:02:04] man when he beheld The Serpent of brass
[1:02:08] when he beheld sin
[1:02:12] judged yeah that's true when you behold
[1:02:17] sin judged soon as something begins to
[1:02:20] cause you to quiver or to tremble or to
[1:02:26] you feel you're going to be overcome
[1:02:28] just look yeah and look at the word of
[1:02:31] God look at the promise and see sin
[1:02:35] judged and if you behold sin judged and
[1:02:39] you can say Satan you have already been
[1:02:42] judged you are
[1:02:45] doomed thank you that's righten and you
[1:02:48] keep holding to that you keep confessing
[1:02:51] that you're going to be a free man and a
[1:02:53] free woman in no time
[1:02:56] glory to God
[1:02:59] hallelujah
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:03] hallelujah so the two that fought in
[1:03:06] heaven
[1:03:09] now come
[1:03:13] on
[1:03:15] hallu as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[1:03:18] the wilderness Jesus said even so must
[1:03:20] the son of man be lifted up and
[1:03:22] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:03:24] perish but have eternal life he's
[1:03:26] dealing with the consequence of death
[1:03:28] he'll not perish and no Marvel he said
[1:03:31] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:03:34] angel of Light at First Corinthians uh 2
[1:03:37] Corinthians
[1:03:38] 11:14 but now I want to come to
[1:03:42] Satan who's the
[1:03:44] adversary and one who withstands one who
[1:03:49] opposes another in a purpose or act the
[1:03:53] first
[1:03:54] time are you interested in this the
[1:03:57] first time that Satan is mentioned in
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:02] Bible is in
[1:04:04] Chronicles yeah 1 Chronicles 2
[1:04:08] And1 and Satan stood up against
[1:04:12] Israel and provoked now he doesn't come
[1:04:15] and show himself as an angel of Light
[1:04:18] right he doesn't come with div
[1:04:20] divination of the
[1:04:21] serpent he's coming now to
[1:04:24] oppose yeah you see the
[1:04:27] characteristics if he can't come and
[1:04:28] show you more light but even when he
[1:04:31] came through the serpent to Eve he said
[1:04:33] he offered her more light there's people
[1:04:37] and trouble that has arisen even within
[1:04:40] the ranks of the message because people
[1:04:43] come and are offering said oh if you
[1:04:46] believe this you'll have more light just
[1:04:48] say excuse me folks I've got a entire
[1:04:51] message I've got the entire message
[1:04:54] spoken by a of God and that is the light
[1:04:57] of the
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] hour
[1:05:02] Hallelujah glory to God I tell you what
[1:05:05] I can say that with and I do say that
[1:05:07] with some Force because I have heard all
[1:05:10] kinds of winds that have come through oh
[1:05:13] this like a special light no special
[1:05:15] light Christ is the light he the
[1:05:18] revealed word is a special
[1:05:20] [Applause]
[1:05:21] light but he offered Eve more light
[1:05:27] yeah and
[1:05:29] now he's he's changed his characteristic
[1:05:32] has changed from a messenger of light to
[1:05:37] one of divination and a question did God
[1:05:41] say yeah now that doesn't really sound
[1:05:43] terrible does
[1:05:45] it did God say on it's not the words
[1:05:48] that sound so terrible it's the agenda
[1:05:51] behind it
[1:05:53] right yeah well how I know that's where
[1:05:57] you need
[1:05:58] to really be in tune with
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:02] God what's behind the
[1:06:05] question right come on Hallelujah and
[1:06:09] the Bible says and Satan stood up
[1:06:11] against Israel and that's the first time
[1:06:14] the term is
[1:06:15] used for this dark enemy of the Church
[1:06:20] of the bride of Christ and Satan stood
[1:06:22] up against Israel and provoked David to
[1:06:25] number Israel and I don't know exactly
[1:06:27] why but that was a grievous sin to God
[1:06:30] that he would number
[1:06:31] Israel right I suppose it showed some
[1:06:34] lack of trust yeah the the term
[1:06:39] Devils first mentioned in Leviticus and
[1:06:42] three or four times in the Old Testament
[1:06:45] is in direct reference to sacrifice to
[1:06:49] Devils he use the term Devils but
[1:06:52] singular devil the devil does not appear
[1:06:56] in the Old
[1:06:57] Testament and the first time it appears
[1:07:00] in the Bible is
[1:07:03] when and the devil you want to be
[1:07:07] interested in this come on the Bible
[1:07:10] says then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[1:07:13] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:07:16] devil yeah had not been before right
[1:07:21] you're you're seeing it up there all
[1:07:24] right and the the devil now it's not
[1:07:27] it's not light son of the morning right
[1:07:32] it's not hath God said
[1:07:35] yeah I can show you a better way it's
[1:07:38] not that yeah now and it's not Satan
[1:07:41] who's opposing now he's coming he's
[1:07:45] opposing God's King opposing the truth
[1:07:51] and and and causing him to do something
[1:07:55] that's contrary to God but
[1:07:58] now
[1:08:00] now
[1:08:02] oh I want this church yeah I want the
[1:08:05] people to see what I'm speaking now the
[1:08:10] two that were in eternity yeah back in
[1:08:15] the eternities yeah and one wanted the
[1:08:18] word and now the word has become
[1:08:21] flesh and now they look at each other
[1:08:24] again I to
[1:08:27] eyeball and now it's the
[1:08:30] devil and the Bible teaches us to be
[1:08:33] tempted of the devil and the devil is an
[1:08:38] accuser see he didn't come just to show
[1:08:41] you more light he didn't come just to
[1:08:44] entice you in some nice things that's
[1:08:46] what people say oh they feel that you
[1:08:48] know this might even be God come on wake
[1:08:52] up what's the end thereof which
[1:08:55] direction is it taking a person saying
[1:08:57] no I'm not going there I'm not going to
[1:08:59] some old cold formal thing I'm not going
[1:09:03] to become LAX and lukewarm I'm going to

[1:09:44] he's gone from son of the morning son of
[1:09:47] the Dawn but we need to know what his
[1:09:50] agenda was his agenda says I want that
[1:09:53] spoken word and when he gets down and
[1:09:56] now he's facing with the creature of the
[1:09:59] spoken word which is Adam and Eve God
[1:10:03] God of the earth he comes and says I can
[1:10:06] show you more light yeah and this is
[1:10:08] more wonderful and this is more enticing
[1:10:11] did God say you shouldn't partake of
[1:10:13] this well this is this is going to take
[1:10:16] you you be sure he's going to take it in
[1:10:18] the wrong
[1:10:19] direction Amen on come on folks that's
[1:10:23] exactly
[1:10:26] so well this doesn't hurt does it do any
[1:10:32] good and now to be tempted of the devil
[1:10:36] and here's here's Christ himself made
[1:10:40] flesh facing the enemy that he faced in
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:46] eternities to be tempted of him now now
[1:10:50] the word has become flesh do you think
[1:10:53] for a second that the that the enemy
[1:10:55] didn't know that that that that that
[1:10:58] body now the word was in the body and
[1:11:00] the word became flesh and there certain
[1:11:03] restrictions he got
[1:11:05] tired he got hungry and after 40 days
[1:11:09] the scripture says he wasn't hungered
[1:11:12] that didn't happen in
[1:11:13] heaven that happened here and now the
[1:11:17] same one that looked at they looked at
[1:11:19] each other eye to eye over there now
[1:11:21] they're on Earth where he's been cast on
[1:11:24] Earth and and and what does Jesus use
[1:11:28] what does Jesus use against him the very
[1:11:31] thing he lusted after the spoken word of
[1:11:35] God and your Prophet happened to say
[1:11:38] listen to me folks your Prophet happened
[1:11:40] to say Jesus did not use any of his
[1:11:42] Grand and wonderful gifts he used what's
[1:11:45] available to you and it's your fault my
[1:11:49] fault if we don't use it it's like
[1:11:51] having an Armory full of assault weapons
[1:11:54] but we won't use them I tell you take a
[1:11:57] hold of the word of God said my Prophet
[1:12:00] sent from God our lord Jesus spoke
[1:12:03] through him and the same one who denied
[1:12:06] you and rebuked you there is now
[1:12:08] rebuking you because he dwells in
[1:12:11] me and you have no part of me Hallelujah
[1:12:16] and my God has said I am sealed and you
[1:12:19] don't even have any access to me
[1:12:21] Hallelujah
[1:12:28] hallelujah thank you Lord and I hear you
[1:12:32] maybe somebody's saying well you don't
[1:12:33] know what I go through yeah I do I know
[1:12:37] what he goes through I can tell you that
[1:12:39] he's one fellow that doesn't leave the
[1:12:41] minister alone because he's afraid we
[1:12:44] might say something of Eternal worth he
[1:12:47] might say feel that we're going to use
[1:12:49] something of the spoken word of God and
[1:12:52] speak the word hallelujah and I've made
[1:12:55] real enemies of his I told you this
[1:12:58] morning I just read one line This is a
[1:13:01] wounded one and her husband doesn't know
[1:13:04] she's read this listen friends because I
[1:13:07] obeyed that to the letter I flew four
[1:13:11] and a half hours with my wife in Reverse
[1:13:14] by jet to come to that town of Geneva
[1:13:17] Switzerland and two strangers total
[1:13:19] strangers picked us up there were the
[1:13:22] two that I'd got emails from and drove
[1:13:25] us to their home and took us up into the
[1:13:27] bedroom which they had prepared and I
[1:13:30] stood there my suitcase is right there
[1:13:32] my wife is right here I'm standing
[1:13:35] here and they closed the door and said
[1:13:38] refresh yourself and we'll come down
[1:13:40] have
[1:13:42] coffee I said to my wife what are we
[1:13:45] doing
[1:13:47] here what are we doing here for 5 days
[1:13:50] we're going to be here we never stay
[1:13:52] with people
[1:13:55] we never stay with people we always
[1:13:57] arrange our own
[1:13:58] hotel what are we doing here but because
[1:14:02] of that a
[1:14:04] convention because some people came over
[1:14:08] and I told them no meetings I won't
[1:14:11] preach no meetings but they said well
[1:14:13] there's a little we little we building
[1:14:15] here it's a quaint cute little church in
[1:14:17] a town of about 150 people where we are
[1:14:19] and we're just going to have our family
[1:14:21] gather there all right so and I spoke to
[1:14:23] the family and because of that two of
[1:14:27] the brothers
[1:14:29] said you must come
[1:14:32] back we must have a service and you know
[1:14:35] gather the people could you come next
[1:14:38] spring we pray about it we
[1:14:42] did and we're in a magnificent place in
[1:14:45] the windows all along that side and
[1:14:47] there's a
[1:14:48] grand mountains of Switzerland and snow
[1:14:52] in the valley all green and the pasture
[1:14:55] land it was just picture
[1:14:58] perfect and God spoke to me and said
[1:15:03] conference with
[1:15:05] God and I went and got the message he
[1:15:08] says and God will choose a beautiful
[1:15:10] place something like
[1:15:13] Geneva and get people
[1:15:16] aside away from their families and away
[1:15:19] from all other things because of because
[1:15:22] of
[1:15:23] Crisis because there's a
[1:15:26] crisis God already said these people are
[1:15:29] wounded you're talking about bruised
[1:15:32] reads bent over to the Earth not knowing
[1:15:37] how we'll ever straighten up again and
[1:15:40] so we had a
[1:15:41] gathering about 120 130 140 people and I
[1:15:47] tell you it's the only time in my life
[1:15:48] it was like came into the room but this
[1:15:52] many people like a blanket fell over
[1:15:56] and there was people from all kinds of
[1:15:59] doctrines this Doctrine and that
[1:16:01] Doctrine and people who were afraid of
[1:16:03] each other and it kind of looked around
[1:16:05] the room and God and I said conference
[1:16:08] with God God said you'll call people to
[1:16:11] a beautiful place something like Geneva
[1:16:13] I said look at
[1:16:15] that and I said the reason he calls them
[1:16:17] is because there's a crisis and you
[1:16:21] people are in a crisis amen
[1:16:26] and it's like God Brothers threw a
[1:16:28] blanket over the place and and and it
[1:16:30] was a witness even to senior men who
[1:16:32] came from Belgium they came from Holland
[1:16:36] they came from Germany They Came From
[1:16:38] Italy they came from Romania they came
[1:16:40] from Croatia they came from all over the
[1:16:42] place and the next year even before we
[1:16:45] left they said when is the next meeting
[1:16:48] and it's like God drew a blanket around
[1:16:50] and said this is my convention nobody's
[1:16:54] going to to tamper with this glory to
[1:16:57] God said oh God have your way have your
[1:17:00] way these people have been beaten these
[1:17:02] people have been bruised these people
[1:17:04] have been uh gone after this personality
[1:17:07] gone after that personality and I spoke
[1:17:10] very straight to them and God gave them
[1:17:12] a heart to receive and we just finished
[1:17:15] the fifth year of Glorious almost 300
[1:17:18] people and that blanket is still over
[1:17:20] the group Hallelujah I tell you what
[1:17:24] friends I said this is a neutral country
[1:17:26] it's known as a neutral country and let
[1:17:29] people come from all over the country
[1:17:31] they even want to come from my church
[1:17:33] and they did and they flew from
[1:17:35] different places to be there in a
[1:17:37] neutral place and hear the word of God
[1:17:40] With No Agenda No Agenda we have one
[1:17:44] agenda that we will fall in love with
[1:17:46] the bridegroom that's our agenda
[1:17:50] hallelujah hallelujah and we won't let
[1:17:52] Satan we deny Satan the right to tamper
[1:17:55] with this kind of love
[1:17:59] affair
[1:18:00] Hallelujah glory to you I won't say
[1:18:03] forgive me but at least pray for me I
[1:18:06] have such an urgency Within
[1:18:15] Myself and so he was to be tempted of
[1:18:19] the
[1:18:21] devil Jesus in the form of the second
[1:18:24] Adam
[1:18:25] by a new creation uses the same word
[1:18:28] that Lucifer
[1:18:29] desired to have and defeats him and he
[1:18:34] perhaps did not realize that the very
[1:18:36] word of creation that he lusted to have
[1:18:40] would destroy him when the word became
[1:18:43] flesh yeah amen come on Amen our lord
[1:18:48] Jesus Took of this Earth that had been
[1:18:50] cursed because of him and our lord Jesus
[1:18:54] even took of the cursed Earth and and
[1:18:56] and lived in a body God in flesh and he
[1:19:01] took it to Calvary listen friends I'm
[1:19:04] going to say something perhaps you've
[1:19:06] heard it before but in the in the
[1:19:08] servant that we have as a servant of God
[1:19:11] our precious brother brandham God took a
[1:19:14] man who was born in sin he said he was a
[1:19:17] sinner we know that born in sin and
[1:19:19] shape iniquities and took him to a a
[1:19:22] place of adoption where he where he was
[1:19:26] wholly surrendered to the will and the
[1:19:28] word of God and he wasn't interested in
[1:19:31] any denomination he wasn't interested in
[1:19:33] wealth and those things and showed us
[1:19:36] another way and we aren't virgin born as
[1:19:40] Jesus was virgin born but we are born in
[1:19:43] sin but now we have an example that you
[1:19:47] can be born in sin and overcome the
[1:19:49] enemy and live an overcomer life that's
[1:19:53] why the message came the message didn't
[1:19:56] come just to have us with churches
[1:19:58] dotted across the landscape the message
[1:20:01] came that there's going to be a people
[1:20:03] these buildings going to be empty one of
[1:20:05] these days there's going to be a people
[1:20:07] that's going to depart them and go to
[1:20:09] some unknown place going to be taken
[1:20:12] into another realm into another
[1:20:15] dimension I will come again and receive
[1:20:18] you under myself that where I am not
[1:20:21] where I will be where I am there you
[1:20:24] shall be also do you believe that I'm
[1:20:27] rejoicing in that brother hallelujah
[1:20:30] we're going to be
[1:20:32] there I believe that with all my heart
[1:20:35] and soul thank you Lord
[1:20:38] amen hallelujah and
[1:20:43] then as
[1:20:45] Lucifer
[1:20:46] came and used the one
[1:20:51] next to Adam
[1:20:55] now we have the second
[1:20:58] Adam yeah and we have one next to him
[1:21:03] right yeah his name is
[1:21:06] Judas yeah and they are in the Last
[1:21:11] Supper looking over the table
[1:21:16] together he is not afraid of your
[1:21:20] home he is not afraid of this church
[1:21:23] he's not afraid of this building he's
[1:21:26] not afraid of just what a person utters
[1:21:28] from their lips but when a person by the
[1:21:30] inspiration and the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:33] Ghost speaks the word of God he is he is
[1:21:39] disarmed
[1:21:42] Hallelujah and now think of it friends
[1:21:45] I'm I'm moving on down now it comes
[1:21:48] right next to the one the second
[1:21:53] Adam yeah and I look right across the
[1:21:55] table I won't look at any person I look
[1:21:59] right across the table at each
[1:22:01] other and Jesus
[1:22:04] said what thou
[1:22:07] doest do
[1:22:09] quickly
[1:22:10] amen yeah and the Bible says read it in
[1:22:14] your Bible then Satan entered
[1:22:19] him and he became the son of
[1:22:22] predition yeah and the son of of God and
[1:22:25] four
[1:22:27] died one took one to Calvary at Calvary
[1:22:31] Son of God took one to heaven the son of
[1:22:34] predition took one to
[1:22:36] hell that's the account of the Gospel of
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ and the devil is an
[1:22:44] accuser now he's moved from one that
[1:22:47] opposes you to one who accuses
[1:22:50] you oh you think you're in the rapture
[1:22:55] you think you're going to heaven you
[1:22:57] think you're a special elect group
[1:23:00] that's exactly that sounds just exactly
[1:23:02] like
[1:23:04] him and he's an
[1:23:07] accuser
[1:23:09] yeah I know come on he'll dig up stuff
[1:23:13] he'll dig up some weakness something
[1:23:15] something you said a long long time ago
[1:23:17] and repented over a multitude of times
[1:23:19] to say you said that you think you're a
[1:23:22] believer
[1:23:26] what's what's what what what should we
[1:23:28] answer then brother bisc what should we
[1:23:31] answer come on well answer him with yes
[1:23:36] I've been cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ which you haven't amen yeah I've
[1:23:41] repented over my sin which you
[1:23:43] can't I've just done a whole lot of
[1:23:45] things that you can't do and I'm a Son
[1:23:48] of God which you aren't and I'm destined
[1:23:52] for heaven which you aren't Hallelujah
[1:23:54] there's a big difference
[1:23:56] friends glory to God
[1:24:02] hallelujah so the two were face to face
[1:24:05] again in a different form yeah and the
[1:24:09] prophet said in the first seal and in
[1:24:11] this act
[1:24:13] tonight in this act
[1:24:16] tonight he said we're going to see that
[1:24:19] it's Satan changing his mask he changes
[1:24:23] right
[1:24:24] son of the morning yeah to
[1:24:28] divining
[1:24:29] creature offering more light and
[1:24:32] something more more knowledge and a
[1:24:35] brighter Kingdom now and then he moved
[1:24:39] and he's opposing now he's opposing you
[1:24:41] feel that opposition same one right same
[1:24:45] one and now he takes another position to
[1:24:49] accuse yeah oh how he can accuse he
[1:24:53] knows the scripture
[1:24:54] yeah he's a Slicker he knows the word of
[1:24:57] God and he uses it and twist it around
[1:25:00] yeah that's
[1:25:01] right and his
[1:25:04] intent is to degrade you to deny you
[1:25:09] right your
[1:25:11] claim right come
[1:25:14] on and one of the things and that's why
[1:25:18] I'm coming to it
[1:25:20] now that
[1:25:23] uh he's attempting to do is find and he
[1:25:27] raises up those to find things that they
[1:25:31] say are
[1:25:33] irreconcilable in the
[1:25:35] message yeah and they're saying is this
[1:25:38] what the message says does it say this
[1:25:43] and and and if you were to say well yeah
[1:25:45] yeah it does say that I guess
[1:25:48] yeah the it's not the question it's what
[1:25:52] is the agenda don't forget what is the
[1:25:55] agenda behind the question is get you to
[1:25:58] disbelieve the messenger
[1:26:02] amen it's the same serpent asking the
[1:26:05] question with the intent of getting the
[1:26:08] person the believer the one that God has
[1:26:12] put his hand on to
[1:26:14] question the source of the spoken word
[1:26:18] because that's the thing he
[1:26:22] despises come on
[1:26:26] come
[1:26:28] on so he says the second writer was
[1:26:31] exactly the same as the first horse he
[1:26:33] says what happened he changed his
[1:26:35] ministry another place he said he
[1:26:37] changed his
[1:26:42] position
[1:26:47] right now before I come to my testimony
[1:26:50] just hold it a moment
[1:27:03] I'm just
[1:27:10] questioning there's a tactic of war and
[1:27:13] war is certainly something of Satan
[1:27:17] right and during the second world war
[1:27:19] horrific things took
[1:27:21] place the Holocaust
[1:27:25] I understand 54 million young men and
[1:27:30] people perished 54 million that's a very
[1:27:34] sizable country let alone a
[1:27:38] city perished some of our finest of
[1:27:42] young men and young
[1:27:44] ladies perished for what here we are a
[1:27:48] few years later some we hardly know what
[1:27:50] happened War yeah
[1:27:55] but there was a tactic of
[1:27:59] infilt infiltration rather a tactic of
[1:28:02] infiltration which was first implemented
[1:28:05] during the first world war or the first
[1:28:09] birth pain I prefer to use the prophet's
[1:28:12] language and was used to gain further in
[1:28:15] the second world war but infiltration
[1:28:18] attacks began with brief and violent
[1:28:21] bombardments of the enemy front lines to
[1:28:24] suppress and de and demoralize the
[1:28:26] soldiers stationed
[1:28:28] there Satan knows this tactic very well
[1:28:32] he doesn't just come with
[1:28:34] one and the reason why people perhaps
[1:28:37] become a little quiet and and withdrawn
[1:28:40] when I come to a subject that's so close
[1:28:42] to home is because it is so
[1:28:44] revealing and I can just hear there's
[1:28:47] somebody here that has felt the
[1:28:49] bombardment it's come from One Direction
[1:28:52] and another Direction and another
[1:28:53] Direction
[1:28:54] in another Direction I'm not talking
[1:28:57] about succumbing to it I'm talking about
[1:28:59] overcoming it have you felt that you
[1:29:03] wouldn't be ashamed to raise your hand
[1:29:04] would you you've had the bombardment
[1:29:07] okay I'm I'm preaching even for a few of
[1:29:10] you the bombardment also targeted the
[1:29:14] enemy re areas rear areas to destroy and
[1:29:18] disrupt roads and artillery and command
[1:29:20] units this was done to confuse the enemy
[1:29:23] and to reduced their capability to
[1:29:25] launch an effective
[1:29:28] Counterattack I have people that have
[1:29:30] you know maybe they start to get cool
[1:29:32] and then they're not in the service and
[1:29:34] not in the church and the house of God
[1:29:36] and they go and talk to this person that
[1:29:38] person and and and maybe there's a
[1:29:41] question first but before long they're
[1:29:43] questioning the minister the pastor
[1:29:47] that's not sufficient then they question
[1:29:49] the church then they question the
[1:29:51] message then they question the Prophet
[1:29:54] himself and that's the pattern that it
[1:29:57] usually takes and from there the next
[1:29:59] time you'll find them they're in the
[1:30:02] world absolutely in the
[1:30:05] world and I've had them Laden with sin
[1:30:08] dark with sin
[1:30:11] yeah and say I'm
[1:30:15] okay that's the next one I can't even
[1:30:18] believe the deception that has
[1:30:19] completely swallowed them completely
[1:30:21] swallowed them up completely in the
[1:30:23] world say hey I'm okay my kids are okay
[1:30:26] and you know their kids are drunkers and
[1:30:29] prostitutes they were okay I tell you
[1:30:33] what your children your family you may
[1:30:36] have loved ones in that state there's
[1:30:38] only one remedy and that is that the
[1:30:41] Holy Ghost will draw them to a place of
[1:30:43] repentance and they will find peace with
[1:30:46] God once
[1:30:50] again I'll be personal with you right
[1:30:53] now
[1:30:54] I'll be personal with you come
[1:30:57] on come
[1:30:59] on come on I have a half
[1:31:04] sister that has experienced a lot of
[1:31:06] trouble in her life but she's done very
[1:31:09] well she's a professor and teachers in
[1:31:11] our
[1:31:13] University but she was going through a
[1:31:15] very very difficult time very very
[1:31:17] Grievous time in her
[1:31:19] teens that's right when I was with
[1:31:21] brother Brenham
[1:31:25] and it so happened that I had to ride
[1:31:27] out and leave brother brandham and the
[1:31:29] hunting group we in this beautiful place
[1:31:31] of the
[1:31:33] mountains and I had to ride out about 30
[1:31:36] miles on
[1:31:37] Horseback and I couldn't believe that
[1:31:40] brother Southwick was going to let me go
[1:31:41] alone at least he'd have his son go with
[1:31:44] me to lead the way I'm in I'm in Grizzly
[1:31:47] infested country I mean absolute you
[1:31:50] haven't got Wilderness or perhaps have
[1:31:53] seen wilderness like
[1:31:54] this and I am I am I I am I have some
[1:31:59] fear yes I do I've got across Rivers
[1:32:02] where the horse may have to swim I don't
[1:32:04] know and so I said but is is Blaine
[1:32:08] going to go with me now I said the horse
[1:32:09] knows the way hey I've ridden horse when
[1:32:12] I walked in the na to stand put their
[1:32:14] head up against a tree and they want you
[1:32:16] to tell them what to
[1:32:17] do they don't know which way to go and
[1:32:20] it wouldn't help for me if I don't know
[1:32:21] which way to go so here we are and I I
[1:32:24] wake up that morning and the great big
[1:32:26] snowflakes are coming down total white
[1:32:28] out of snow coming
[1:32:30] down and there were all in the Cook
[1:32:32] House and brother brandham and Billy
[1:32:34] Paul and all of them in the cook house
[1:32:35] and I went to the next tent it was one
[1:32:37] year where brother brandham and I and I
[1:32:40] believe uh I believe brother San was
[1:32:41] there and we I was rolling up my my bag
[1:32:45] my sleeping
[1:32:47] bag I down my hands and knees and
[1:32:50] rolling up sleeping
[1:32:52] bag and and uh brother Bren crawls in on
[1:32:55] his hands and knees Parts the tent and
[1:32:59] he sits and squats
[1:33:01] down he said well brother Eddie said
[1:33:06] really hate to see you
[1:33:07] go and I said yeah I hate to go too he
[1:33:12] said uh oh he said just be nice if we
[1:33:15] could just be up here for a month or so
[1:33:18] and the sun would come out and shine
[1:33:20] nice and warm and we'd go up and see
[1:33:23] some big Rams and these mountains and I
[1:33:25] bit my lip because I was starting to
[1:33:27] tremble a wee bit and I I was saying
[1:33:30] Within Myself brother brandom don't do
[1:33:32] this to
[1:33:33] me you're just killing me you know and
[1:33:37] then he turned real serious and he says
[1:33:39] but I know he said you know you've got
[1:33:42] family and you've got to work and you've
[1:33:44] got
[1:33:45] responsibilities I understand he said
[1:33:47] and I understand about the church in
[1:33:50] Dawson Creek the UPC was trying to take
[1:33:53] it
[1:33:55] away and he said I understand about the
[1:33:58] church in Dawson Creek and about your
[1:34:00] sister that's all he had to
[1:34:03] say I'm here preaching tonight and I
[1:34:07] told that sister of the prophet's words
[1:34:11] praying that they would anchor in her
[1:34:13] heart that she could never have peace
[1:34:16] till she has received this Lord Jesus
[1:34:19] Christ amen friends I'm I'm with you
[1:34:23] we're all in this together I'm holding
[1:34:26] fast Hallelujah we've got battles to
[1:34:28] fight and I'm saying she's not yours
[1:34:32] devil she's not
[1:34:34] yours God spoke through a prophet's
[1:34:37] mouth and spoke some things and said
[1:34:39] some things say he has another
[1:34:42] intention
[1:34:47] amen may I give you part of my testimony
[1:34:50] now
[1:34:55] do we have about 20 minutes is that all
[1:34:59] right you have never heard this isn't
[1:35:01] never been written in a
[1:35:05] book and I only give it because there
[1:35:09] have been those who
[1:35:12] have uh took it upon
[1:35:16] themselves to go
[1:35:18] public and to say some things which I
[1:35:21] think are not right
[1:35:26] and I feel that it would be good to
[1:35:29] alert you and make you to know it as
[1:35:35] well and This concerns
[1:35:38] the uh brown bear
[1:35:41] Vision that brother Brown spoke of and
[1:35:45] there's no record of it
[1:35:48] happening how
[1:35:50] many have that have had that question or
[1:35:54] you understand you heard about
[1:35:56] it quite a few how many raise your hands
[1:36:01] all
[1:36:04] right I want to be uh
[1:36:08] forthright and yet
[1:36:11] honest this is my
[1:36:14] testimony and I speak it because I was
[1:36:20] there these men who I'm famili with and
[1:36:24] acquainted with took it upon
[1:36:26] themselves and on uh on the
[1:36:30] internet have gone on a site called
[1:36:34] believe the
[1:36:35] sign when these men put that site up
[1:36:39] they were indeed professing to be
[1:36:43] Believers but I say without any
[1:36:45] hesitation they have since become
[1:36:47] enemies of the message and still
[1:36:49] maintain that sight to me it is so
[1:36:52] cunning
[1:36:54] that people would come on and with that
[1:36:56] with the heading believe the sign the
[1:36:59] web the website the web page believe the
[1:37:01] sign when in fact those behind it have
[1:37:04] their full intention to see that you
[1:37:06] don't believe the
[1:37:08] sign and I am here to be truthful and to
[1:37:12] be honest with you and to show you in
[1:37:14] the message so that you are never shaken
[1:37:16] by such a thing
[1:37:47] on the site you will
[1:37:50] see uh
[1:37:54] in May
[1:38:00] 1962 possessing all things brother
[1:38:02] Brenham said many of you remember the
[1:38:04] vision that I had where I had shot the
[1:38:07] grizzly bear 9- foot grizzly bear and
[1:38:10] the church remembers me telling it here
[1:38:13] and the Caribou I was in that that took
[1:38:15] 6 hours that Vision to be fulfilled so
[1:38:18] I'm not speaking of that I am the one in
[1:38:20] the green checkered shirt that was
[1:38:22] waiting for him
[1:38:24] he said I had another remember it's on
[1:38:27] tape here and I seen a great huge brown
[1:38:30] bear that might be a Kodiak and it
[1:38:33] wouldn't have worked down here there in
[1:38:36] Canada cuz they're not there you see but
[1:38:40] wherever it will be it will be it'll be
[1:38:44] it will be that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:38:48] it will be in the next uh slide then he
[1:38:53] he come that's now may 1962 now this is
[1:38:56] June 1962 the next month now I'm going
[1:39:00] back into the country that you might
[1:39:02] know when I come back next year I'm
[1:39:06] going to get a brown bear that's almost
[1:39:09] twice that size you see if it's right or
[1:39:13] not I seen it when we were standing put
[1:39:16] my hands on his hunches laying on the
[1:39:19] ground like that and I could put my
[1:39:22] hands on his hips like that and him
[1:39:24] laying down now you find out if that's
[1:39:28] right or
[1:39:31] not
[1:39:35] then in
[1:39:39] August okay just just hold that one off
[1:39:41] a moment would you
[1:39:43] please in August of
[1:39:47] 1962 uh we went up on the hunt
[1:39:54] and these people who put the sign up
[1:39:58] said William
[1:40:02] brandom William Brandon returned to
[1:40:04] British Columbia in July of
[1:40:07] 1962 these are their
[1:40:09] comments and preach six services on
[1:40:12] Vancouver Island those were the services
[1:40:14] which we
[1:40:16] arranged my wife played the piano and I
[1:40:19] was on the
[1:40:20] platform but did not fulfill the vision
[1:40:23] of the time uh at that time he returned
[1:40:27] in British Columbia to British Columbia
[1:40:29] again in October
[1:40:31] 1964 with Perry
[1:40:33] green but did not fulfill the vision at
[1:40:37] that time either when William Branham
[1:40:40] passed away on December 25th 1965 the
[1:40:43] vision had never been
[1:40:46] fulfilled what does that mean a
[1:40:50] question it means that when William
[1:40:52] brandham said in 1962 that he would
[1:40:56] shoot a brown bear in British Columbia
[1:40:59] and that this was thus sayi the Lord he
[1:41:03] spoke
[1:41:05] presumptuously and presumptuously is to
[1:41:08] infer that someone is speaking beyond
[1:41:10] the realm of authority their realm of
[1:41:12] authority he was speaking
[1:41:15] presumptuously now if you'll go back
[1:41:17] please to September
[1:41:20] 1962 and the reason I understand this is
[1:41:23] because this was after the hunt that I'm
[1:41:26] going to describe in a few moments and
[1:41:28] now brother brandham says so I in these
[1:41:32] 30 going on 32 years of ministry I have
[1:41:36] tried to stay true to the
[1:41:38] word I don't know of one thing I've ever
[1:41:42] had to alter on because I just read it
[1:41:45] out of the
[1:41:46] Bible just and said just what the Bible
[1:41:50] said and Let It Go like that and so so I
[1:41:53] haven't had to try to back or rearrange
[1:41:57] because I just said it the way the that
[1:42:00] the Bible says it and I find out if God
[1:42:04] now notice if God has spoken anything
[1:42:09] then we must go with that word in order
[1:42:13] to make it be
[1:42:20] fulfilled he said we seen that as I told
[1:42:23] you last night of a vision just recently
[1:42:29] see that it I had to be
[1:42:31] there I had to be there he's just
[1:42:35] finished saying you have to you must go
[1:42:38] with that word in order to make it be
[1:42:41] fulfilled and he said now I had to be
[1:42:43] there and warning to be there and
[1:42:46] telling me 6 months before to be on that
[1:42:50] spot and stand there and send saying go
[1:42:54] down there three times with them and I
[1:42:58] just walked on with the other men and
[1:43:01] the vision passed right through exactly
[1:43:05] God's part and I was left
[1:43:09] standing you
[1:43:11] understand so we want to re
[1:43:14] remember you've got to stay on the word
[1:43:17] just stay right with the word and where
[1:43:20] the word leads you go right with the
[1:43:22] word word and it'll bring you out all
[1:43:26] right I'm
[1:43:28] sure now the reason why I understand
[1:43:31] that is
[1:43:32] because I was there in August with him
[1:43:36] and this is what
[1:43:37] happened it's my
[1:43:41] testimony brother brandom did not
[1:43:45] describe in
[1:43:47] detail uh the brown bear Vision like he
[1:43:50] did of the caribou and the grizzly which
[1:43:52] he told it
[1:43:53] very fine detail the measurement of the
[1:43:55] horn and so
[1:43:57] on and uh however he did say that he was
[1:44:01] out with some small fellows when he got
[1:44:04] this particular
[1:44:05] bear and here are the details as it
[1:44:09] happened we had traveled on
[1:44:12] Horseback about 25 miles and we made
[1:44:17] Camp way far into the Rocky Mountain
[1:44:20] trench mountains on all sides beautiful
[1:44:23] place brother Bram said it was just like
[1:44:26] beyond the curtain of
[1:44:29] time and uh we made camp and the next
[1:44:34] next day we looked and we uh we we just
[1:44:38] saw you know it was a beautiful
[1:44:42] day and brother brother Southwick he
[1:44:45] said to his son Blaine there was Blaine
[1:44:47] his son Billy Paul brother brandham son
[1:44:50] myself brother Southwick and brother
[1:44:54] Brenham and
[1:44:57] uh
[1:44:59] brother brother Southwick suffered with
[1:45:02] angina a little bit so he couldn't exert
[1:45:05] himself too much and so climbing he was
[1:45:08] slower than us younger fellas we were
[1:45:10] about half their age I was 27 brother
[1:45:13] Brandon was 52 I might have been 28 and
[1:45:16] he might have been 53 our first time I
[1:45:19] was 27 he was
[1:45:21] 52 so brother BR a brother Southwick
[1:45:24] said Blaine he said
[1:45:27] you take brother Billy Paul and Eddie
[1:45:30] and go a certain direction he directed
[1:45:34] us and he said and I'll take brother
[1:45:37] brandham and we'll go here on a hill a
[1:45:39] mountain right behind the camp it was
[1:45:41] beautiful grass not much trees some
[1:45:45] Willows and easy climb much easier than
[1:45:48] where we were
[1:45:49] going and so we left we left that
[1:45:52] morning and
[1:45:53] uh walked we walked to a place down this
[1:45:57] beautiful magnificent
[1:46:00] Valley and then a mountain was here and
[1:46:03] there was a a small Valley like a
[1:46:06] v-shaped valley which just came up to a
[1:46:08] ridge in a saddle down from this
[1:46:10] mountain and went up between these two
[1:46:12] mountains and uh so we'd climb partway
[1:46:15] up in what we'd call the first ledge the
[1:46:18] first bench of this mountain and it just
[1:46:20] came around like this and this Valley
[1:46:23] going this
[1:46:25] direction Big Valley vast vast areas and
[1:46:30] we got up on this bench and we just just
[1:46:32] as we started to walk on this bench we
[1:46:34] look up and here's a massive bear coming
[1:46:38] down equal to us but he's coming down
[1:46:41] just on the other side of this little V
[1:46:45] and it's widening out a wee bit until
[1:46:47] here when it Go flows into this Valley
[1:46:50] it turns this way and this ours turns
[1:46:52] this way and so when we saw him coming
[1:46:55] down we got behind some
[1:46:57] Willows and and kind of hid and because
[1:47:01] there wasn't any trees or bushes such
[1:47:03] but just these Willows and we got down
[1:47:05] behind the Willows and he's coming down
[1:47:07] we watched him for perhaps as long as a
[1:47:09] half an hour and he's turning over
[1:47:12] stones and looking for rodents and
[1:47:14] looking for they also eat Roots these
[1:47:17] big big grizzly bears and uh so he just
[1:47:22] made Moses his way down feeding as he
[1:47:24] came and he came right down across from
[1:47:27] us dead across from
[1:47:30] us I have never seen a bear like this
[1:47:32] I've lived in the north most of my life
[1:47:36] I've been in the woods I've been in
[1:47:39] camps where as I said in the meeting I
[1:47:42] haven't had dogs as a friend but I've
[1:47:44] had Bears because they were in Camp
[1:47:46] every night dumping over the garbage
[1:47:48] cans and so on they were so common black
[1:47:51] bears and whatever more but this bear I
[1:47:54] have never seen a bear like that he was
[1:47:56] massive absolutely massive I'm not
[1:47:59] exaggerating but the outstanding feature
[1:48:01] of him is from he was dark he was dark
[1:48:03] in color but right behind his ears
[1:48:08] came uh a a band from his hump as the
[1:48:12] Grizzlies have a hump a band about I
[1:48:14] would say about a foot wide coming right
[1:48:17] down and down over his chest over his
[1:48:20] cape area like this
[1:48:22] and it was the color of golden
[1:48:26] wheat absolutely ripe harvest wheat it
[1:48:30] was gold I have never seen an animal
[1:48:33] like that in my life brother Blaine
[1:48:36] Southwick who still
[1:48:38] lives has told me that that is the
[1:48:40] largest grizzly he's ever seen or the
[1:48:43] largest bear he's ever
[1:48:44] seen and he thought it probably would go
[1:48:47] 1,000 PB that was a massive massive
[1:48:51] animal and and he just stood there and
[1:48:54] he was on this Bluff and we're on this
[1:48:56] one right
[1:48:57] across so Blaine and Billy both are
[1:49:01] they're saying shoot him brother Eddie
[1:49:03] shoot him why don't you shoot him and I
[1:49:05] said no no I'm not I'm not going to
[1:49:07] shoot him I said brother brandham hasn't
[1:49:09] I don't think's even fired a shot and I
[1:49:12] you know we want want him to get
[1:49:15] something and so we just watched him and
[1:49:17] we watched him maybe 10 15 minutes and
[1:49:21] they after a while he said why don't you
[1:49:23] shoot him take a shot you know I said no
[1:49:25] I don't want to shoot him he quite a
[1:49:27] distance but I had a very flat shooting
[1:49:28] gun and I said no I I I I won't shoot
[1:49:31] him I said I I want brother Brenham to
[1:49:34] get a shot first and get an animal and
[1:49:38] then that bear he just standing there
[1:49:40] like this and he goes his head massive
[1:49:44] head goes up and he just waves it from
[1:49:46] side to side like this and I know that
[1:49:49] he's he's got a wind of something and
[1:49:51] he's smelling their eyesight is very
[1:49:54] poor but boy their their scent of smell
[1:49:57] is just incredible and he's going like
[1:50:00] this and we're over here he goes like
[1:50:08] this just like that H he zeroed right in
[1:50:12] on where we were and we were probably 5
[1:50:14] 600 yards away and he just looked like
[1:50:17] that and then he just wheeled around
[1:50:19] this way and started straight up this
[1:50:21] mountain and he and and he he ran came
[1:50:25] to the glacier went right over the
[1:50:27] glacier great big pal marks we were
[1:50:30] watching him in our scope and went over
[1:50:32] the top he was gone somewhere between 12
[1:50:34] and 15 minutes over over that mountain
[1:50:37] peak as was the most incredible thing so
[1:50:41] we continued on that day and then that
[1:50:44] evening when we got back to camp we said
[1:50:48] well we saw this magnificent bear and uh
[1:50:52] and they hadn't shot anything and so
[1:50:55] that night some Somewhere in the Night
[1:50:58] started to
[1:51:01] rain and it
[1:51:04] rained rained steady rained the next day
[1:51:08] clouds hanging
[1:51:10] down rain the next day rain the next
[1:51:13] night rain the next day rain the next
[1:51:17] night rain never let up rain the next
[1:51:20] day 1 2 3 4 for days and nights and just
[1:51:25] rained everything was just sogging wet
[1:51:30] heavy clouds
[1:51:32] cold
[1:51:35] miserable and brother brother Southwick
[1:51:38] he he I was the kind of the point man
[1:51:40] because I arranged the Hunts bought the
[1:51:43] food and so on and you actually when you
[1:51:46] buy the food for a hunt you count how
[1:51:48] many eggs you're going to eat a day each
[1:51:51] how many slices of bread because you got
[1:51:53] to pack it on horses all that distance
[1:51:58] so if there was any message that brother
[1:52:01] brandom wanted to get to Bud or
[1:52:03] something yeah they would talk between
[1:52:04] themselves but if there was anything
[1:52:05] having to do with the arrangement they
[1:52:07] would generally say well you know so Bud
[1:52:10] says to me just in the tent we're all in
[1:52:12] the tent but he says he said I guess
[1:52:15] brother Brandon wants to go home I said
[1:52:17] what I turned around brother brandham
[1:52:20] was over here I said brother brandham I
[1:52:22] said do you want to go home oh he said
[1:52:25] we've had a wonderful time brother Eddie
[1:52:28] I would my heart just went down to this
[1:52:30] my boots I said we just got here we just
[1:52:33] started you haven't fired a shot he said
[1:52:36] that means I can come back next
[1:52:39] year that didn't satisfy me I just I
[1:52:42] said well you
[1:52:46] know I didn't know what to
[1:52:49] say I just didn't couldn't believe that
[1:52:52] he was going to leave and then he said
[1:52:55] well you know he said by the time I get
[1:52:57] home I've been gone quite a while and I
[1:52:59] started to think yeah a day we rode in a
[1:53:02] day we ride out that's two days 4 days
[1:53:05] sitting in there that's 6 days he drives
[1:53:07] up probably 3 days you know and has to
[1:53:10] drive back yeah he's it's it's over two
[1:53:12] weeks by the time he gets back I said I
[1:53:16] understand so we start to dismantle
[1:53:20] things we have to pack everything
[1:53:23] and Bud he just that was one job he did
[1:53:25] not like and he began to pack all the
[1:53:27] food and the stuff and we're all working
[1:53:29] around we had to pack everything up in
[1:53:32] the tent roll up our bags and get all
[1:53:34] ready and then and the horses now let me
[1:53:37] tell you folks if in case you don't know
[1:53:39] horses hate to be packed up when they're
[1:53:42] wet and cold and get those Saddles and
[1:53:45] cinches on their wet cold skin they're
[1:53:48] just like humans they don't want to they
[1:53:50] don't want that and so we have to start
[1:53:52] finding the horses and bringing them in
[1:53:54] and tying them up and putting the saddle
[1:53:56] blankets on and the Saddles pack saddles
[1:53:59] and cinch it up and our riding horses
[1:54:02] there's you know there's there's three
[1:54:04] five of
[1:54:05] us and so I I got on my horse I'm just
[1:54:10] sitting on the horse everything is so
[1:54:12] cold and Bud is starting to pack the
[1:54:15] panyards as the side boxes on the horse
[1:54:19] and Blaine has to help him it it's a
[1:54:21] Twan job and brother brandham came out
[1:54:23] and he says brother Eddie he said where
[1:54:26] did you brother see that bear I said
[1:54:29] write down here I said you just go down
[1:54:33] this Valley and that first first Little
[1:54:36] Valley that you see going up into the
[1:54:38] mountain he was right there on that
[1:54:40] first ledge that's where he was right on
[1:54:42] the edge of it and so he said uh I
[1:54:45] wonder how I wonder how much longer
[1:54:47] we're going to be Bud he says how long
[1:54:49] will it be before we have to pull out
[1:54:51] bud says oh you got all kinds of time he
[1:54:54] says we're not leaving here for 2 3
[1:54:57] hours or whatever he said uh you know
[1:55:00] it'll be noon before we're
[1:55:02] gone he said just go and you know and uh
[1:55:07] just go you got lots of time so brother
[1:55:09] Bram just took off in that direction and
[1:55:12] uh I just saw him disappear in the
[1:55:14] Willows and he was gone and there's not
[1:55:17] not much that I could do because you
[1:55:19] know we're just helping out and whatever
[1:55:21] more and and and then when about an
[1:55:24] maybe hour and a half to 2 hours later
[1:55:26] brother brandham came back I was sitting
[1:55:29] on my horse at that
[1:55:31] time in rain
[1:55:33] gear brother Bud was just up a few yards
[1:55:36] from
[1:55:37] me and uh brother brandham came up and
[1:55:40] stood right beside my horse right here
[1:55:43] and he looked up at me says brother
[1:55:44] Eddie he said I'm the Jonah in this
[1:55:48] group now all I can tell you is the
[1:55:50] truth I'm the Jonah in in this group and
[1:55:53] he pointed to the sky he said this is on
[1:55:56] account of me he said it's only the
[1:55:58] second time I know in my life that I
[1:56:01] disobeyed a vision he said you know that
[1:56:04] first time was in in Africa and and then
[1:56:07] he started talking about Africa and and
[1:56:10] and he didn't I remembered that there
[1:56:12] was a time when the ministers and
[1:56:14] different men were trying to persuade
[1:56:16] him to go someplace or have meetings or
[1:56:19] whatever more and then I think that's
[1:56:21] when he got sick
[1:56:23] and he said and it's the only second
[1:56:25] time that I know that I disobey the
[1:56:28] vision and he said just like
[1:56:31] this but it's
[1:56:33] over and we'll ride out of here
[1:56:37] dry
[1:56:39] friends but it's over and we'll ride out
[1:56:42] of here
[1:56:46] dry those are the most unbelievable
[1:56:50] words that you could possibly
[1:56:54] here and I didn't even
[1:56:57] respond I didn't know about the other
[1:56:59] Vision I didn't I didn't know that this
[1:57:03] was part of the vision that had taken
[1:57:05] place but now he's identified it said
[1:57:08] it's on account of
[1:57:11] me and so I'm sitting on my horse and
[1:57:14] I'm I'm just I'm I'm just I'm pondering
[1:57:17] the event caught in kind of the vortex
[1:57:21] of something
[1:57:22] but it was not unusual to have this kind
[1:57:25] of experience with this servant of
[1:57:28] God and while I'm sitting there I think
[1:57:35] probably 10 12 15 minutes I'm just
[1:57:39] sitting
[1:57:41] there and it was a puff a puff of
[1:57:45] air I it's not a wind but it was just a
[1:57:49] puff a movement of air just but
[1:57:53] passed me that way I remembered like it
[1:57:55] was 5 minutes ago I thought Bo that was
[1:57:59] warm that was so nice and warm and uh
[1:58:03] and and and then there was a air
[1:58:06] movement but no wind no Breeze just air
[1:58:09] movement and it just increased and kept
[1:58:12] moving around like that and clouds all
[1:58:15] hanging down low and everything just
[1:58:18] sogging
[1:58:20] wet and now this air movement going and
[1:58:23] and then it kind of turned into a bit of
[1:58:25] a breeze in a few moments and and the
[1:58:28] Willows were right about where this wall
[1:58:30] is near where this brother's sitting
[1:58:33] that's where the Willows were and the
[1:58:35] horses were tied in there and we were to
[1:58:39] to pack them and and I noticed the
[1:58:42] leaves on the Willows starting to shake
[1:58:44] like
[1:58:46] that hear me
[1:58:48] now 2 minutes walking through those
[1:58:51] bushes
[1:58:52] you'll be soaked to the
[1:58:54] hide everything was so soak and
[1:58:57] wet and now I see the leaves are just
[1:59:00] moving and shaking like that and and I I
[1:59:04] I was just sitting there on the horse
[1:59:07] and right out in front of me probably
[1:59:09] where these sisters are sitting maybe a
[1:59:11] little
[1:59:12] further there just a big a
[1:59:16] big
[1:59:18] uh Sunshine struck the Earth
[1:59:23] and I thought Bo and I looked up like
[1:59:25] this and there was a like just a big
[1:59:28] hole in the sky and I was looking for
[1:59:30] the first time at Blue Sky hadn't seen
[1:59:32] Blue Sky for days I I didn't think
[1:59:35] anything spiritual I just thought isn't
[1:59:37] that nice you know first Sunshine I've
[1:59:41] seen in days and and that sun in a
[1:59:44] little bommy air moving around I thought
[1:59:47] this just great and before long that you
[1:59:51] know the whole of sunshine got bigger
[1:59:53] and bigger and finally it was you know
[1:59:56] surrounding us and I take off my rain
[1:59:58] gear and take off that and and I'm
[2:00:00] finding in my short sleeves and before
[2:00:03] our horses took one
[2:00:08] step there was I I cannot tell you there
[2:00:11] wasn't a cloud but I never saw a cloud
[2:00:14] the sky was just blue from from one Peak
[2:00:18] to the other and we rode out of there
[2:00:20] that day the the next 8 hours in hot
[2:00:25] Sunshine of the northern and up there
[2:00:27] the sun doesn't go down till very very
[2:00:30] late in the day probably 9 10:00 at
[2:00:32] night and all I can tell you I tell you
[2:00:36] friends you may wonder why I preach with
[2:00:38] such Earnest Zeal I have been in these
[2:00:42] kind of experiences and I want to tell
[2:00:44] you that if I had rode out wet I would
[2:00:48] not be here behind this
[2:00:50] Pulpit he said the only second time I
[2:00:53] know that I disobeyed a vision and he
[2:00:56] said that Vision passed by
[2:00:59] exactly God's part exactly I was not
[2:01:03] where I and left me standing he wasn't
[2:01:06] standing where he was supposed to be the
[2:01:08] vision God's part god uses
[2:01:14] man Moses didn't always do exactly what
[2:01:17] he was supposed to do but yet God didn't
[2:01:21] God didn't change mind he's still
[2:01:23] Prophet he's still God's Prophet still
[2:01:25] comes with God's word and that's exactly
[2:01:28] and I'd like to hear you say amen toight
[2:01:31] amen thank you God bless you it's been a
[2:01:34] pleasure to be with you amen
