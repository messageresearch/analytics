[11:29] Hallelujah. He is here. I'm going to ask
[11:31] if the brothers if they would just
[11:32] prepare for the morning offering this
[11:34] morning. We do have a number of prayer
[11:35] requests, but maybe we could just sing
[11:37] this as a confession as we just prepare
[11:38] to go to prayer this morning. Amen. He
[11:41] is here. You can touch him. Amen. And
[11:43] you'll never be the same.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he is here.
[11:52] Hallelu.

[13:27] your name.
[13:30] He is here.
[13:33] You can touch him.
[13:37] You will never
[13:40] be the
[13:42] [Music]
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just going to ask brother Tim Don
[13:47] would you come please? We have a couple
[13:48] prayer requests. Children's family is
[13:50] asking that we would please remember
[13:52] brother Elass's dad Eddie. He was taken
[13:54] to the hospital today for small seizures
[13:56] and being dehydrated. just asking for a
[13:58] touch for him. Also, brother Hugh was
[14:00] just asking we'd remember Sister Sylvia.
[14:02] She's hurt her ankle and is in pain. And
[14:04] Sister Shenise is asking we please pray
[14:06] for her dad. He's in the process of
[14:08] trying to come here and join us in
[14:10] church. So, please remember him. If
[14:12] there's something on your heart that
[14:13] you'd just like to let be known with an
[14:14] upraised hand. Amen. I believe God sees
[14:17] that even that is an act of faith as you
[14:19] raise your hand saying, "God, remember
[14:20] me this morning." Amen, brother Tim.
[14:24] [Music]
[14:27] Amen. Let's pray together as we lift our
[14:30] hearts before the Lord.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful redeemer.
[14:36] We're so thankful. We're so grateful
[14:39] that we can not just sing that song, but
[14:41] believe that song. You are here.
[14:44] Wherever two or three are gathered in
[14:46] your name is, you're in the midst of
[14:48] them. And that's not just another saying
[14:50] or another scripture to us, oh Lord. And
[14:53] Lord, it causes us to desire to
[14:55] sensitize ourselves to the moving of
[14:59] your Holy Spirit this morning. We
[15:01] believe that you have a special service
[15:03] for us this morning. That Lord, it's
[15:06] good for us to be here and to be in your
[15:09] presence, to be ready to hear the word,
[15:12] to be receptive and have open hearts.
[15:15] And for that cause we do lift our hearts
[15:18] before you desiring oh Lord that you
[15:20] will come in a special way today. Lord
[15:23] may you move upon brother Biscll as he
[15:25] has labored in your word. Lord once more
[15:28] we pray that you will take the gift and
[15:30] minister to the need of the body of
[15:33] Jesus Christ. Whether it be here in the
[15:36] local assembly or out over the internet
[15:38] or somebody that might watch it in the
[15:40] days ahead. We believe that you're able
[15:42] to sovereignly direct the gift according
[15:45] to your perfect will in mind today. And
[15:48] Lord, we're needy this morning. Lord, as
[15:51] long as we're on this earth in these
[15:52] mortal bodies, we will have needs. We
[15:55] remember brother Ricardo this morning
[15:57] who's injured. Oh God. Lord, we remember
[16:00] the children's dad. We remember Sister
[16:03] Sylvia, oh God. We remember the others,
[16:06] oh Lord, that are held before us. Sister
[16:08] Chenise's father, oh God. Some have
[16:11] physical needs. Some have spiritual
[16:13] needs. Some, Lord, have financial needs.
[16:16] There's hands raised before you. And you
[16:18] are a great God, a personal God that
[16:21] knows each and every need. Lord, it does
[16:24] not need to be made known before the
[16:26] congregation. But Lord, we come to you
[16:29] with our request this morning believing
[16:31] that the blood of Jesus Christ has paid
[16:34] for every redemptive blessing.
[16:37] We count the blood as sufficient this
[16:40] morning.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; And we give our knees. We lay our
[16:42] burdens at your feet.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Asking Lord not our will but thy will be
[16:48] done
[16:49] &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just surrender ourselves to
[16:54] you. Bless Lord the remainder of the
[16:56] song service. Bless Lord the ministry of
[16:59] the word. And as we give this offering
[17:01] unto you, we give it as a form of
[17:04] worship this morning. And we ask you
[17:06] Lord to receive our worship. Bless the
[17:09] offering and may you use it for the
[17:11] glory of the kingdom of God. We commit
[17:14] all to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I forgot to mention our brother
[17:22] Ricardo had also had a a fall off of a
[17:24] ladder and was taken to the hospital and
[17:26] I thought how fitting the same morning
[17:28] we had a prayer request that we had a
[17:29] testimony from a brother Vile for the
[17:31] same type of thing. Amen. God knows. God
[17:34] bless you. As you have your seats, why
[17:35] don't we sing There is none like you. As
[17:37] we take up the morning offering.
[17:40] Amen.
[17:42] Oh, there is none like you,
[17:50] Lord. No one else can touch my heart
[17:54] like you do.
[17:57] And I can search for all eternity,
[18:02] Lord, and find. There is none like you.
[18:10] There is none. There is none like you,
[18:19] Lord. No one else can touch my heart
[18:23] like you.
[18:27] And I can search for all eternity,
[18:31] Lord.
[18:33] And
[18:34] there is none like you. Sing it out to
[18:39] me again. There's none, Lord. Lord,
[18:41] there is none
[18:44] like you.
[18:46] [Music]
[18:49] No one else can touch my heart like you
[18:53] do.
[18:54] [Music]
[18:56] And I can search for all eternity, Lord,
[19:01] and find. There is none like Hallelujah.
[19:06] Once more, there is none like you, Lord.
[19:10] Yes, there is none
[19:12] like you.
[19:17] No one else can touch my heart like you.
[19:24] And I could search for all eternity,
[19:28] more
[19:29] and
[19:31] there is none like you.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:38] Amen. I believe brother Mike Ray has an
[19:41] announcement for us. Maybe he could just
[19:43] come uh have that right now. And as he's
[19:46] coming, we have a thank you from our
[19:48] sister Barb and the Drake family. We

[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be gathered in the house of
[31:36] God.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Or I thought of house of prayer, house
[31:40] of worship. And it's so nice to see you
[31:43] all here. I'll just have you have your
[31:45] seats for a few moments.
[31:51] I' I've also requested that brother Ryan
[31:55] and uh the choir group will sing the
[31:58] fourth man in the fire. I want to
[32:00] glorify him. Amen.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; The living word of Christ.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; And they didn't that was a surprise and
[32:10] they didn't expect to see one like under
[32:12] the son of God in the furnace. But he
[32:14] was he's in our furnace.
[32:18] Amen.
[32:22] Um, I want to thank brother Jim Hayes
[32:24] for the email yesterday and
[32:28] um, he stayed here for the service and
[32:32] rather than take a flight overseas and I
[32:35] started I'm just going to give you a
[32:37] couple details that have made me feel
[32:39] very very humble and uh, said that he
[32:42] was going to bring his brother I believe
[32:44] that's brother Henry. Is brother Henry
[32:47] here? Could you stand so I can see you
[32:50] there? God bless you. Thank you. And
[32:52] they've made such an effort. Thank you,
[32:54] brother Jim. The other night, I thought
[32:57] I was just making a rather casual
[32:59] announcement for everyone. I'd like
[33:02] everyone from the assembly to be here.
[33:04] And uh brother Timothy Anoco was
[33:07] streaming the meeting in Johannesburg.
[33:10] And uh and when I said, "I'd like to
[33:13] have everybody here at church on Sunday
[33:16] morning as I thought I had something,
[33:18] you know, I wanted everyone to hear."
[33:21] And so he said, "Well, yeah, you know,
[33:22] within himself, he said, "Yes, I I I'll
[33:24] be there because I'll be streaming." He
[33:26] said, "And just as I said that in my
[33:28] heart," he said, "and you said, "And I
[33:30] don't want you staying at home
[33:31] streaming."
[33:34] And he just said, "Oh, well, that's it."
[33:37] So he picked up the phone and called the
[33:39] airlines, called his travel agent and
[33:42] they said, "There's no flights." He
[33:44] said, "Just keep trying." And they
[33:46] finally found a seat on Air France and I
[33:48] picked him up the next night and Brother
[33:50] Timothy Anatogo is here. I said, "I've
[33:52] never had anybody."
[33:55] You stand, brother Timothy.
[34:01] I picked him up at the airport and I
[34:03] said, "I've never had anybody fly 15,000
[34:06] kilometers to come to church, but now we
[34:09] have it." So I I think we set a record
[34:11] this time as well. So God bless you,
[34:13] brother Timothy. Brother and sister
[34:16] Poacher are here from Montana. Did we
[34:20] have Did you have them stand?
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Uh I'd like to have them stand. Brother
[34:25] Shannon,
[34:27] God bless you.
[34:33] We've had some nice times of fellowship
[34:35] and we look forward to more.
[34:40] Then the family and friends of the uh uh
[34:43] of the family of brother Levi and sister
[34:47] Karen Drake, who I now call Karen Drake,
[34:51] uh from the wedding yesterday. and we've
[34:53] heard some of the singers and brother
[34:56] brother Danny Steam the pastor down in
[34:58] Sarasota will be speaking tonight
[35:01] &gt;&gt; so we're looking forward to that and his
[35:03] wife Michelle with him and he rather
[35:06] than sit on the platform he thought
[35:07] he'll sit down in the seat so anyway
[35:10] brother Danny and we get to go to
[35:14] Sarasota then you'll let me sit down
[35:16] there
[35:24] and the group in church in Reton and
[35:28] brother brother Peter, God bless you,
[35:31] met brother Freddy and some of those
[35:33] from the uh from the church down in
[35:36] Seattle Tacoma which meets in Reton at
[35:38] the church in Reton. They canled their
[35:41] service today to be with us and we
[35:44] really appreciate that. That's just
[35:46] really special to have you. We we love
[35:48] that fellowship.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Some of the ministers will be arriving
[35:54] in the next few days that will be
[35:56] coming. Some ministers are coming in for
[35:59] brother Tim and sister Sarah's wedding,
[36:02] which is the following week on the 17th.
[36:05] But I wanted to say that brother Steven
[36:07] Abali
[36:09] from Uganda is one of the ministers that
[36:11] is coming. And for those young people's
[36:14] group that went to uh Uganda, you
[36:17] remember him well. And he will be
[36:19] speaking on Sunday the 18th,
[36:23] May the 18th.
[36:25] So, we're happy. Uh I've asked if
[36:28] brother Ryan and the group could could
[36:31] sing. So, I wonder if the singers could
[36:33] come and uh join Brother Ryan to sing
[36:38] Fourth Man in the Fireplace. And then
[36:40] we're going to go right into the word of
[36:42] God. Will that be fine?
[36:45] We'll just take an extra few moments to
[36:49] concentrate as they sang about this one
[36:54] unexpected. They didn't fast for him.
[36:57] They didn't do any long prayers for him.
[36:59] He was just there.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And at the moment,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; the moment we need him the most,
[37:05] &gt;&gt; he will be there. And that's what we
[37:07] want to be able to say this morning
[37:09] freely. The light's here.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I say it again? The light is
[37:14] here.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I should say something inspired by the
[37:31] Ryan. He wrote this song, but it's one
[37:34] of our favorites.
[37:47] [Music]
[38:07] The moment now has come.
[38:12] There's nothing to be done.
[38:18] My accusers stand
[38:21] before me and there's nowhere left to
[38:27] run.
[38:30] And so it ends this way.
[38:36] There's nothing more to say.
[38:42] I will pay the price
[38:45] and give my life for the choice that I
[38:50] have made.
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] Oh, but suddenly,
[38:57] [Music]
[39:00] what is this I see
[39:04] as I'm cast into
[39:08] the fire? There is one who stands by me.
[39:16] I saw the fourth man
[39:21] between the flames and night.
[39:27] When there was no hope at all, he saved
[39:33] me just in time.
[39:37] pulling back the forces
[39:42] that press on every side.
[39:46] I am saved
[39:49] by the voice in the fire.
[39:56] I am saved
[39:59] by the fourth man in the fire.
[40:04] [Music]
[40:12] And now the test is passed.
[40:17] But it was not the last.
[40:21] For my accusers seek to find me weak and
[40:27] constantly
[40:28] attack.
[40:31] They're searching to and fro.
[40:36] Constantly
[40:38] they go
[40:40] and in my desperate hour seek to devour
[40:45] and strike the fatal blow.
[40:50] But I am not afraid.
[40:54] Oh, and they are much dismayed.
[40:59] For between a stand, the son of man and
[41:04] the standard he has raised.
[41:10] I saw the for
[41:14] between the night
[41:19] and there was no
[41:23] s
[41:24] [Music]
[41:39] By the fourth man in the fire,
[41:45] I saved
[41:48] by the fourth man in the fire.
[41:54] [Music]
[42:01] Jesus
[42:03] for me.
[42:07] Jesus Christ
[42:10] for my hour of
[42:13] &gt;&gt; in my desperate hour
[42:18] [Music]
[42:21] at my side. at my side.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; The time was
[42:32] at all. He saved me just in time.
[42:38] I saw the for
[42:42] between
[42:43] &gt;&gt; between the and
[42:48] there was no battle. He saved me just in
[42:54] time.
[42:57] Nothing else can harm me
[43:01] with Jesus.
[43:04] Jesus.
[43:05] I say
[43:08] by the fourth man in the
[43:13] army. I am I save
[43:17] by the fourth man in the fire.
[43:23] [Music]
[43:28] I am saved
[43:31] by the fourth man in the fire.
[43:38] [Music]
[43:40] [Applause]
[43:51] If you've never met him,
[43:55] if you've never met him, I don't know
[43:56] how he might meet you. I can tell you
[44:00] once, once you meet him, your life is
[44:02] never the same.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Never the same.
[44:07] I have you stand with me if you would
[44:09] please, and we're going to read in the
[44:11] scripture
[44:15] in Matthew the 13th chapter.
[44:24] And I'll also read Isaiah 61 or rather
[44:28] 60 and one and two just two verses.
[44:34] Matthew is going to be the 13th chapter
[44:36] and we will begin reading at verse 24.
[44:40] But just before we read, we'll ask the
[44:43] Lord's blessing
[44:45] upon our gathering.
[44:51] Dear heavenly father,
[44:55] we are so so grateful. Our hearts are
[44:58] filled with thanksgiving.
[45:00] You are the author of salvation.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And we came into the world as sinners
[45:05] born in sin and shapen in iniquity.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; But your cleansing was more than
[45:10] sufficient.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; You have cleansed us, oh God. Not merely
[45:15] forgiven, but you have cleansed us, oh
[45:18] God. You brought forth a virgin bride to
[45:21] Jesus Christ. This one was has been sung
[45:25] about the fourth man in the fire. You've
[45:28] been all down through the generations,
[45:30] Lord. And we did not leave you in the
[45:32] past. We do not leave you in history. We
[45:36] believe that you are present.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; You are here in this uh in this
[45:40] sanctuary.
[45:42] You are where each one is gathered,
[45:43] whether they be streaming or in some
[45:46] hospital bed or some room. We pray that
[45:49] you will meet with us, oh God, in a
[45:51] special way. We give ourselves to you
[45:54] unreservedly, Father, to the Holy
[45:56] Spirit's leadership and guidance. Be
[45:59] glorified for you are the only one that
[46:02] is worthy. No flesh shall glorify be
[46:05] glorified in your presence in Jesus
[46:08] Christ's name.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; We thank you. Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Reading from Matthew.
[46:20] The kingdom of heaven. Verse 24.
[46:23] Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
[46:26] which sowed good seed in his field. But
[46:30] while men slept, the enemy came and swed
[46:33] tears among the wheat.
[46:36] But when the blade was sprung up and
[46:39] brought forth fruit, then appeared the
[46:41] tears also.
[46:44] So the servants of the householder came
[46:46] and said unto him, "Sir, did thou not
[46:49] sow good seed,
[46:52] good seed in thy field? From whence then
[46:55] hath it tears?"
[46:58] He said unto them, "An enemy hath done
[47:00] this?"
[47:01] The servant said unto him, "Wilt thou
[47:03] then that we go and gather them up?" But
[47:06] he said, "Nay, lest ye gather up the
[47:10] tears, lest while you gather up the
[47:12] tears, ye root up also the wheat with
[47:15] them.
[47:18] But let them grow together until the
[47:21] harvest. And in the time of the harvest,
[47:23] I will say to the reapers, gather ye
[47:26] together first the tears, and bind them
[47:28] into bundles to burn them. but gather
[47:31] the wheat into my barn.
[47:35] And then if you want wish to read in
[47:38] Isaiah chapter 60 two verses,
[48:01] shine for the light has come in the
[48:04] glory of the Lord. Lord has risen upon
[48:06] thee. Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall come,
[48:10] shall cover the earth, and gross
[48:12] darkness the people. But the Lord shall
[48:15] rise upon thee,
[48:19] and his glory shall be seen upon thee,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[48:26] light, and the and the kings and kings
[48:29] to the brightness of thy rising.
[48:33] You may be seated.
[48:40] I want to more clearly define verse 30
[48:43] which we read
[48:45] on the screen. Please, if you'll put it
[48:47] up,
[49:00] that's the verse 30 of Matthew.
[49:05] And I'd like to define it a little more.
[49:08] You young people are accustomed to this.
[49:11] Let them both grow together.
[49:16] until the harvest.
[49:19] until the harvest.
[49:21] And in the time of harvest,
[49:24] I will I will say to the reapers,
[49:28] gather ye together first the tears, and
[49:32] bind them in bundles to burn them.
[49:36] But gather the wheat into my barn. While
[49:38] those are still there,
[49:41] a prophet of God has spoken of gather
[49:44] first the tears and bind them into
[49:47] bundles to burn. I want you to remember
[49:49] that.
[49:50] And he said also that the gospel,
[49:54] the preaching of the gospel
[49:56] blind some. And the two messengers were
[49:59] actually angel messengers went to Sodom
[50:02] &gt;&gt; and they were beating at the door of Lot
[50:07] &gt;&gt; but they were struck with blindness.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the gospel blinds
[50:12] here here in the physical earth. We may
[50:14] see people as being very popular and and
[50:18] uh and they are messengers of God and
[50:21] the world may take them wrong and may
[50:25] you know uh Billy Graeme was one of
[50:27] those messengers. All right.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Uh he consorted with the presidents and
[50:36] many presidents and that might give a
[50:39] wrong impression to us. But whether they
[50:43] saw something or whether they were
[50:44] blinded, that's up to God. That that's
[50:47] not up to us.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; So I just want you to see that we can we
[50:52] can uh then go on to the next uh
[50:57] the parable.
[50:59] the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:03] uh when he said that the kingdom of
[51:05] heaven was like unto a man who sowed
[51:07] good seed
[51:09] only to have an enemy come and plant
[51:10] tears uh amongst those good seeds. God
[51:16] did not plant the tears.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Satan planted those tears right amongst
[51:20] the good seed of God. Those two kinds of
[51:24] plants or people from two different
[51:27] seeds grew up together.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; This is what I want you to notice. They
[51:31] partok of the nourishment in the same
[51:34] earth.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; They shared in the same sun,
[51:38] &gt;&gt; rain and other benefits
[51:41] &gt;&gt; and both were harvested in their turn.
[51:46] Uh this was this has special meaning for
[51:48] me because when I actually had met
[51:50] brother Brandham this was one of the one
[51:53] of 10,000 questions I guess at least a
[51:55] thousand questions in my heart. How
[51:58] could we gather together and fellowship
[52:01] and sing the same songs
[52:04] and weep over the same preaching and be
[52:08] affected emotionally. I was affected
[52:10] others were affected and then I would
[52:13] hear some rank story. right
[52:15] &gt;&gt; uh out of a minister's mouth. I and I
[52:17] was struck
[52:19] &gt;&gt; how could that come out of the same
[52:20] mouth. I just was thanking God a few
[52:23] moments ago
[52:24] &gt;&gt; and and and I just saw things in a
[52:26] spiral
[52:28] &gt;&gt; going down. And that was one of the
[52:30] things I asked him that how could they I
[52:34] said I know what the anointing is and I
[52:37] know they're anointed and they're
[52:39] incredible preachers. How is this
[52:42] happening? And he asked if I had heard
[52:44] his service, false anointed ones. He
[52:47] hadn't preached it yet for four years,
[52:50] but he asked me if I'd heard it. See, in
[52:52] the you you you as as individuals, we as
[52:56] individuals must realize we're here in a
[52:59] physical body that's not going to last
[53:00] all that long.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; But our souls is from another realm.
[53:05] Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; And the souls of a believer
[53:08] of God's seed that he sowed,
[53:11] &gt;&gt; he's going to, he said, he will not lose
[53:13] one of them.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And no man, Jesus said, can pluck them
[53:17] out of my hand.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; That's something you have to remember.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I know that you do.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; All right. I'd just like to leave that
[53:25] for now.
[53:27] uh
[53:30] then
[53:32] uh
[53:34] I want to make some points here that you
[53:36] can remember please.
[53:38] Light is by the spoken word of God.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; In other words, the manifested word of
[53:43] God, the word of God identified is
[53:47] light.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; The most intense heat
[53:53] &gt;&gt; from the sun is at the harvest time. The
[53:57] most intense sen light is when the
[54:00] spoken word or prophecies are being
[54:04] fulfilled.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; The death, burial, and resurrection of
[54:09] Jesus Christ was a time of rapid
[54:13] fulfillment
[54:14] &gt;&gt; or I should say bright
[54:17] sunshine or harvest
[54:20] &gt;&gt; uh harvest sun. The intensity of harvest
[54:24] sen
[54:25] brought an entire group or crop of
[54:28] individuals
[54:30] both for and against the living revealed
[54:34] word.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And we've just come through the uh
[54:38] through the resurrection
[54:40] uh Easter time. And so some of these
[54:42] comments now I'm going to tie it all
[54:44] together as we as we move forward. We
[54:46] can shut those off now, please. Thank
[54:48] you.
[54:56] Now there is a
[54:58] I just have you listen to this out of
[55:00] the message shalom and two or three of
[55:03] you or some of you have asked which
[55:05] message you should read for today's
[55:07] service
[55:08] but in the message shalom and going to
[55:11] be turning some corners here so I hope
[55:14] you just stay with me you'll have to
[55:16] ponder this service arise and shine 9 in
[55:20] the message shalom. For the glory of God
[55:23] has come upon you. He's quoting
[55:27] Isaiah 60. The light is here.
[55:33] And then the very next verse says, gross
[55:36] darkness is upon his people or this
[55:39] people.
[55:41] And then when we are in a mixtury of
[55:44] light and darkness and I just like you
[55:48] to notice a word that there is it's not
[55:50] in any dictionary but whoever invented
[55:53] words we have new words that come up
[55:55] every year every new year they always
[55:57] give the new words that have come up
[55:58] that year but they don't say who
[56:00] invented them they just kind of evolve
[56:03] and people start using new terms and new
[56:07] terminology and new words. Well, this is
[56:10] a word and as far as I'm concerned, the
[56:12] prophet used it and it had some meaning.
[56:15] So, we have light. Arise and shine. The
[56:18] light has come and then there's darkness
[56:21] and gross darkness upon the people. So,
[56:24] we have light and darkness. But now he
[56:27] introduces and then when we are in a
[56:30] mixtury of light and darkness and if you
[56:33] googled that word you would find that it
[56:35] has been used and is being used with uh
[56:38] one gentleman who's using or orchestra
[56:42] uh live orchestra. He's putting he's
[56:45] putting and blending the instruments and
[56:48] the instrument sounds together in such a
[56:51] way that they actually use the word
[56:53] mixtury there. and and so it has been it
[56:56] has been used by the world but there's
[56:59] no terminology for it but today uh I
[57:03] want to use it quite freely uh when and
[57:06] then when we are in a mixtury of light
[57:09] and darkness
[57:11] and then my address to the church is
[57:14] shalom peace
[57:17] &gt;&gt; my address his address
[57:20] &gt;&gt; to the church is shalom you can take it
[57:23] from William Brandham or you say he was
[57:24] speaking by inspiration
[57:27] &gt;&gt; speaking as a servant, a prophet,
[57:29] messenger,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; my address. So I receive that from the
[57:33] Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I'm using I'm looking upon him as a
[57:36] vessel.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; I'm saying as he said it already in the
[57:40] scripture,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; my peace give I unto you.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I would say that we're in a mixtury.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's anybody here that
[57:48] wants to say that there's no darkness in
[57:51] the world. Uh when there seems to be
[57:54] such neurotic insanity everywhere and
[57:59] governments and and people of stature
[58:03] making uh making statements and making
[58:06] promises that uh are not
[58:10] being kept or we we find things taking
[58:13] place today literal genocide almost
[58:18] happening within countries talking about
[58:20] such violence and yet great powerful
[58:23] leaders with nuclear power at their
[58:25] disposal and all. Not that they should
[58:27] use it, but to say that they've got
[58:29] sophisticated power and all the rest of
[58:31] it and tremendous uh tremendous
[58:34] persuasion in the world and yet nothing
[58:36] can be done and you have a million or
[58:38] more Syrian people and children. Do
[58:41] those children earn that? Do those
[58:44] children do anything for that? or you
[58:46] find other places within Africa or Asia,
[58:49] other parts of the world and it just
[58:51] seems like uh in in most incredible and
[58:55] and indescribable pain and slaughter
[58:57] taking place and the world seems
[59:00] helpless to put an end to it or to stop
[59:02] it. You have to say this is not a uh
[59:05] this is not a world of peace.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of that,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; yes,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; there's one who is the prince of peace.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And it's not something that you are to
[59:17] enjoy on a Sunday morning service
[59:20] &gt;&gt; or on the Lord's day or at any other
[59:22] evening time, but there's this is
[59:24] something that's supposed to work
[59:26] &gt;&gt; in your day-today life.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; This is something in the darkest moment
[59:32] &gt;&gt; somehow there's a a a peace.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And so I want to speak about that. But I
[59:37] also want to bring to you the this
[59:40] bright light that is shining as a
[59:43] harvest light and probably in a way that
[59:46] many of you have not uh perhaps thought
[59:49] of but I've been speaking a number of
[59:51] services here and so if I repeat some
[59:54] things to the congregation you'll
[59:56] understand why.
[59:58] And further in shalom
[1:00:01] he said uh
[1:00:03] that's him among us his word being
[1:00:07] identified. And for those of you that
[1:00:09] may be visiting and so on when I make
[1:00:11] these statements and make them strong
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and make them very very clear.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; You listen close because further on I'll
[1:00:19] be evidencing that.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; I'll be addressing that.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; That's him among us. And may I say I
[1:00:28] have been in the services where he said
[1:00:31] that's him among us
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; and then go into the supernatural realm
[1:00:36] and prove it was him
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; because he proved it was beyond a human
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; ability. And I will I will refer to some
[1:00:44] of that and quote some of that and I
[1:00:46] will give you one experience one in
[1:00:48] special that that you can go to the
[1:00:51] office and get the get the interview. I
[1:00:54] interviewed the ma'am. No prayer cards,
[1:00:57] nobody on the platform. Called right out
[1:00:59] of a car like this. And I know the man
[1:01:02] very very well. Personally interviewed
[1:01:05] him on a at a television station and uh
[1:01:10] down in Ron Oak, uh Virginia, I guess it
[1:01:13] is Ron Oak. And uh
[1:01:17] and uh and the whole staff invaded us.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; They were so moved by that testimony.
[1:01:24] And brother Brandham is calling him out.
[1:01:26] That's what I am referring to. That's
[1:01:29] him among us. His word is being
[1:01:32] identified.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; That's when you get shalom.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; The darkness is separating itself from
[1:01:39] the light. And I'd like you to know that
[1:01:41] in the messages I haven't got time, but
[1:01:44] he he talks about the darkness at 1958.
[1:01:47] He talks about the darkness and the
[1:01:49] light and it's there. And now 1964 he
[1:01:53] says the darkness is separating itself
[1:01:55] from the light. And he takes that
[1:01:57] process.
[1:01:58] So we all agree I'm sure that there's
[1:02:01] plenty of darkness. He says God's
[1:02:04] causing it and the light's doing it.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I even know I know for many believers
[1:02:10] that's that's a stickler. We want to
[1:02:11] think about it.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; The darkness God's causing it.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; The separating
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and the light's doing it. See, he said
[1:02:20] the light's pressing itself
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; in such a way until the darkness has to
[1:02:26] congregate together.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this that the to the I
[1:02:33] have Jewish friends and they have said
[1:02:35] to me openly that uh because they do not
[1:02:40] believe in Jesus Christ as we do but
[1:02:43] they have said they feel that they what
[1:02:45] about all the scriptures that have been
[1:02:47] fulfilled? Well, they felt that the uh
[1:02:50] the disciples did certain things to
[1:02:53] create the event
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; so that you know him riding on the
[1:02:57] donkey and the f of an ass and coming
[1:03:00] into Jerusalem, they thought that was
[1:03:02] kind of a put up. It was kind of done.
[1:03:05] And then at the time of the crucifixion,
[1:03:07] they said they they they offered the
[1:03:10] chief priest offered money and said
[1:03:12] that, you know, if he's if if if he's
[1:03:15] taken down from the cross or if he's
[1:03:17] they'll say that he's risen out of the
[1:03:19] tomb, if his body is not there and we'll
[1:03:21] give them money. And they said, well,
[1:03:23] we'll we'll even secure you the
[1:03:25] soldiers. And they gave them large
[1:03:26] money, the Bible says, because they
[1:03:28] said, then the first first error will be
[1:03:31] worse than the second, I guess it was.
[1:03:33] and and here they're making all kinds of
[1:03:35] things but they were thinking that the
[1:03:38] people were engineering the fulfillment
[1:03:41] of scripture
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; but if you look carefully God does it in
[1:03:45] such a way and I'm coming to a point
[1:03:47] that point is that that we must be able
[1:03:50] to identify scripture
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; that interprets and identifies perfectly
[1:03:56] clearly events in our time
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; otherwise this is only a book of history
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; we're Not just studying history. If
[1:04:05] we're studying history, you might as
[1:04:06] well lock the doors up and go home. We
[1:04:08] need something that's relevant.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; We need something that is relevant to
[1:04:13] not only youth, but families,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; something to seniors. We need something
[1:04:18] that's relevant
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; that that interprets the day that we're
[1:04:22] in.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And that is the purpose of of the
[1:04:25] service this morning. And he said, "So
[1:04:27] the light is pressing itself in such a
[1:04:30] way until the darkness has to congregate
[1:04:33] together."
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; And they had a chance to accept it. They
[1:04:37] wouldn't do it. So it's condensed
[1:04:40] itself. The darkness has condensed
[1:04:42] itself. And they do that by putting the
[1:04:45] church together and the council of
[1:04:47] churches that the council of churches
[1:04:49] was being congregated at the at the time
[1:04:52] these messages were being spoken. But
[1:04:54] now we're in another season. And uniting
[1:04:57] it with the pagan darkness when they so
[1:05:00] firmly disagree with one another.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You'll find out out in the darkness,
[1:05:07] they completely disagree with one
[1:05:09] another, but they will join forces
[1:05:12] against the word, revealed word. Yes.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And when they so firmly disagree with
[1:05:19] one another, but yet they had to go
[1:05:21] together to make the night come upon the
[1:05:24] people.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; So there's innocent people that find
[1:05:28] themselves in darkness, find themselves
[1:05:31] in utter confusion and they don't know
[1:05:34] exactly why. All they know they've come
[1:05:36] under the influence of something, but
[1:05:38] it's not it's not for the believer.
[1:05:41] Light is by the spoken word of God. as
[1:05:44] we just had up a moment ago. And the
[1:05:46] most intense heat is the harvest sun.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, and there's a man
[1:05:54] that can turn on the light. It's the
[1:05:56] same sun, but each day it brings forth
[1:05:59] its strength a little stronger to ripen
[1:06:02] the grain uh for the harvest. Each day
[1:06:06] now they'll get a little stronger, a
[1:06:08] little stronger until finally the wheat
[1:06:11] that's laying there, it'll go to taking
[1:06:15] life.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful and strange
[1:06:18] statement. The wheat laying there will
[1:06:21] go to taking life.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; All the life that was in the root, all
[1:06:26] the life that was in the stock, all the
[1:06:28] life that was in the head, and all the
[1:06:30] life that was in the shock,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; all that life will now be in the wheat.
[1:06:34] That's not so with the weeds.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; The just and the unjust are having the
[1:06:41] same nourishment, the same rain,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; the same benefits,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; the same sunshine, everything the same,
[1:06:48] but are coming to a different a
[1:06:50] different conclusion
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; at the end. And the sun comes a little
[1:06:55] stronger each day, each day. And the
[1:06:57] grain should be a little more matured to
[1:07:00] receive the sunlight. I expect I'm
[1:07:03] speaking to some mature people.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Now, the intensity of the harvest son, I
[1:07:10] want to take it at the time of we just
[1:07:12] came through the crucifixion and the
[1:07:14] time of uh
[1:07:17] the time of the cross, the judgment, the
[1:07:20] crucifixion. Listen to these words. And
[1:07:21] now we in this context that the son is
[1:07:25] the word manifested. Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says, Jesus
[1:07:30] speaking in John 13:18, I speak not to
[1:07:34] all. I know whom I have chosen, but that
[1:07:38] the scripture might be fulfilled,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; but that the scripture might be
[1:07:43] fulfilled. The fulfillment of scripture
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; is sunlight. It's heat,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; it's intensity. Now watch in the rapid.
[1:07:51] There were so many scriptures that were
[1:07:53] being fulfilled right at the time
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; of the crucifixion. and the resurrection
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; one after the other. And so he said,
[1:08:00] "But that the scripture might be
[1:08:01] fulfilled. He that eateth bread with me
[1:08:05] hath lifted up his heel against me."
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Now listen real close.
[1:08:11] Listen real close. We say, "Well, that
[1:08:15] it might be fulfilled for Jesus." It
[1:08:17] also had to be fulfilled. This occasion
[1:08:21] had to arrive and the sun had to shine
[1:08:24] with this intensity to fulfill the
[1:08:27] scripture to give the opportunity to the
[1:08:29] one who was going to lift up his heel.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; It was the sunlight that caused the
[1:08:36] darkness
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; to make darkness to be what it was.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he'd have never had anybody
[1:08:42] lift up his heel against if the sun
[1:08:44] hadn't shone. And the sun shone said,
[1:08:47] "I'm going to fulfill that scripture. It
[1:08:49] must be fulfilled."
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Matthew 26:54. But then how how then
[1:08:57] shall the scripture be fulfilled that it
[1:09:00] must be?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; It must be the sun must shine,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; but also uh the weeds must grow.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Matthew 26:56. But all this was done
[1:09:11] that the scriptures of the prophets
[1:09:14] might be fulfilled. The scriptures of
[1:09:15] who? You mean these men? You mean these
[1:09:18] men that were killed? These men that
[1:09:21] were slain by righteous people or
[1:09:23] so-called righteous were killed because
[1:09:26] they said those things. And now here
[1:09:28] they are being fulfilled
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and being manifested and God
[1:09:32] supernaturally is saying that it's his
[1:09:34] word.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; These scriptures must be fulfilled that
[1:09:39] the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
[1:09:41] all the disciples forsook him and fled.
[1:09:43] Right
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; now, they were in darkness, but they
[1:09:46] were caught in that.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; They were caught in uh an unsuspecting,
[1:09:52] shall I say, an unexpected event.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; There's good people,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; good believers
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; that get caught in a in a moment
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; that they did not anticipate
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; and they said, "I didn't know that this
[1:10:07] was going to happen in the message.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I didn't expect this." And so they uh
[1:10:12] then all the disciples forsook him and
[1:10:15] fled. Why? Because the sun was shining
[1:10:18] in greater heat. They hadn't fled from
[1:10:20] him before.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; They didn't run from him on the mount uh
[1:10:24] on the mount of transfiguration. They
[1:10:26] didn't run from him when he was speaking
[1:10:28] uh on on the mount, the sermon on the
[1:10:30] mount and saying all those wonderful
[1:10:32] things. They never ran. Now they did.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sun is rising and
[1:10:37] shining at a different intensity.
[1:10:41] And then in Mark 14:49,
[1:10:44] I was daily with you in the temple
[1:10:46] teaching. He's talking to all the
[1:10:48] people.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; I was daily with you in the temple
[1:10:51] teaching and you took me not
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; but that the scripture but the scripture
[1:10:56] must be fulfilled.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; He's shining. It's a different season.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And then they took him. that gave them
[1:11:10] the opportunity
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; for the darkness to manifest itself.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Mark 15:28, "And the scriptures was
[1:11:21] fulfilled." And the scripture was
[1:11:22] fulfilled which saith, "And he was
[1:11:24] numbered with the transgressors."
[1:11:28] Now, I just I I just gave you those
[1:11:32] so I could come back to this.
[1:11:35] The intensity of the harvest sun
[1:11:38] fulfillment
[1:11:40] brought an entire crop of individuals
[1:11:44] both for and against the living revealed
[1:11:47] word of God.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Caiaphas was able
[1:11:52] I will say that the sun shining in its
[1:11:55] intensity
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I'll have to listen very close. Don't be
[1:11:58] distracted. The sun shining in its
[1:12:02] intensity
[1:12:05] gave Caiaphas opportunity
[1:12:07] to make the decision. The chief priests
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; brought them to their harvest time.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Judas the son of predition,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; captains of the of the temple,
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Pilate,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; and his wife to have her dreams.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; What caused that? The sun was shining.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Herod,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; the mocking soldiers,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; the crowd wagging their heads.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; The soldiers casting lots for a garment.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; They might have done it before, but not
[1:12:50] this garment.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; What allowed all this to happen? The sun
[1:12:56] was shining
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; and there was a harvest
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; and the harvest was the son of God.
[1:13:05] Not three died at Calvary, four.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; The son of God
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; took one thief.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And the son of predition took the other.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he might go
[1:13:20] to his place.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. But Jesus died that he
[1:13:25] might go to his place.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he wasn't telling a lie
[1:13:29] when he said, "I go to prepare a place
[1:13:33] for you."
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you may be also.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's not a myth.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's not a story. That's not church
[1:13:45] annity. That's not religion. You don't
[1:13:48] have to go to church to find that out.
[1:13:50] But Jesus said that the sun shining
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; said that.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And the son that he was speaking to,
[1:13:59] perhaps they didn't regard that at all
[1:14:02] because they said he he's a blasphemer.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We we we've got accusers that have come
[1:14:09] in here that have heard him and they
[1:14:12] said he said he's going to destroy the
[1:14:14] temple. And he didn't say that. He said
[1:14:17] to them, "Destroy this temple." And the
[1:14:20] word that he used there in the Greek is
[1:14:22] not is not to destroy, to annihilate,
[1:14:25] which he used that he did use that word
[1:14:27] with that meaning before. But when he
[1:14:29] said to the Pharisees and the leaders,
[1:14:31] "Destroy this temple." In other words,
[1:14:33] do what you're going to do.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Get it over with.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; But when he used the word destroy this
[1:14:38] temple and I will in three days I'll
[1:14:40] raise it up, it was loose me.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Loose me.
[1:14:46] loose me from this uh body
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and in three days I'll raise it up
[1:14:51] again.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But they had false accusers that come in
[1:14:58] just change one word.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, we heard him." And the
[1:15:02] government listened to him.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; The government took it down in their
[1:15:06] records
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; that he had said this, that he had
[1:15:09] blasphemed, that he came against us. And
[1:15:11] then they used politics and they said,
[1:15:14] "Shall I crucify your king?" He's not
[1:15:16] our king.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; We have one king. It's Caesar.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Can we imagine them choosing Caesar over
[1:15:24] Jesus Christ, the son of God?
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You talk about being deceived.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And so there was a harvest.
[1:15:36] Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and one thief.
[1:15:43] And the son, Judas, the son of
[1:15:44] predition, took his own life,
[1:15:47] and one thief went his way. He railed on
[1:15:50] Christ. If you're the Christ, deliver
[1:15:52] us.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; The sun was shining.
[1:16:00] false accuser said, "We found this
[1:16:02] fellow perverting the nation
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and forbidding to give tribute to
[1:16:06] Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ
[1:16:10] a king." Find that scripture.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; These people said they heard it.
[1:16:17] There's people today saying they've
[1:16:19] heard things. Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; I just wonder and I would like to ask
[1:16:25] you reverently. Do you think these
[1:16:27] people would have made a website if
[1:16:29] they'd had the opportunity?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I thought I should ask that question. Do
[1:16:34] you think that they would be on Twitter?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Would they would they use emails?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Now you know. Now you know who's doing
[1:16:42] it.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Also
[1:16:50] there had the sunshine brought out
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Barabus.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Barabus a murderer, a known murderer,
[1:16:58] noted murderer in prison for murder.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; But the sunshine
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; brought him a deliverance
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; and an acquitt of a sort.
[1:17:14] Simon the Serene. Simon of Serene.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He had an opportunity to carry a cross.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; He would have never had that opportunity
[1:17:22] if the sun hadn't been shining.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the scripture to be rejected.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And soldiers casting lots
[1:17:33] for his garment. Let us not ren it but
[1:17:36] cast lots for it.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Whose it shall be that the scripture
[1:17:40] might be fulfilled? Yes.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That the light might shine.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; We have to do this because this is
[1:17:48] causing the light is causing us to do
[1:17:50] this.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Oh friends.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And they parted my raignment among them.
[1:17:58] And for my vesture did they cast lots.
[1:18:02] These things therefore the soldiers did
[1:18:05] that the scripture might be fulfilled.
[1:18:07] Right?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this variety
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; because there's a host of things
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; that will take place in your day,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; in my day,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; in this season,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and you have to make the discernment
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; whether it's light or darkness.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; And if it's darkness, it has nothing to
[1:18:28] do with you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; People say to me, "Have you heard this?
[1:18:34] Have you heard that?" No, I said, "I
[1:18:36] haven't heard it. I feel like an
[1:18:37] ignoramis. Did you read this? No, I
[1:18:39] haven't read it.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Why should I?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; It It's not of my kingdom.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It's not of my It's not of my realm.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; It has no interest whatsoever.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; I haven't hardly got enough time to read
[1:18:53] the scripture.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Don't forget this
[1:18:57] Sunday morning.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Don't just say amen and nod to it.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; You go home and practice it.
[1:19:06] Because I can tell you there's spirits
[1:19:08] with that stuff.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And they are spirits of darkness.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; They're spirits of heaviness.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; They want to they want to fasten
[1:19:20] themselves.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And once you hear something,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; sometimes a moment later, you're sorry
[1:19:27] you ever heard it.
[1:19:35] The harvest son.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; It was the harvest son. Don't forget
[1:19:44] that also shone upon
[1:19:47] Peter
[1:19:49] even though he denied even though he
[1:19:52] wept bitterly
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; at just the view of the Lord. Even
[1:19:55] though it is weak moment
[1:19:58] and we do things
[1:20:01] often that we may be very ashamed of
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; he wasn't the only one that wept.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Judas wept
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; bitterly
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; but found no no no repentance.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; He the prophet said he didn't expect it
[1:20:16] to go that far.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; So I don't want nothing to do with this.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Say I'm sorry I put that website up. No,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to do with that.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; They'll say exactly the same spirit that
[1:20:27] was on the leaders. Then we'll be on the
[1:20:29] leaders today. Say that has nothing to
[1:20:31] do with us.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; You say whatever you say, take whatever
[1:20:36] stand you want to say, blasphe, do
[1:20:38] whatever, but it come back and repent.
[1:20:40] It has nothing to do with us.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And it had nothing to do with them. And
[1:20:44] Judas did not find it. He was repenting
[1:20:46] to the wrong people to begin with.
[1:20:58] Repentance is very specific and
[1:21:00] repentance furthermore is a gift of God.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It's the goodness of God. And sometimes
[1:21:08] because I'm so so I cut so accurately to
[1:21:12] the scripture, people sometimes feel
[1:21:14] it's it's kind of overboard. No, it's
[1:21:16] not.
[1:21:17] If anything, it's probably less than it
[1:21:19] ought to be.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; But the scripture says uh it it says if
[1:21:24] somebody did you wrong. No, it doesn't
[1:21:26] say that.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; The scripture says it's the goodness of
[1:21:32] God that bringeth a man to repentance.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; That's the goodness of God.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And godly sorrow
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; workketh repentance. Yeah.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I've had people come over to my house
[1:21:46] and said, "Well, if I did anything
[1:21:47] wrong," I said, "Why'd you come here? I
[1:21:49] mean, you know, not if you did.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Did you
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; or didn't you?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Did you say it or didn't you say it?"
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Then you find people start mumbling
[1:22:00] around. Well, well, maybe I Well, you
[1:22:02] know, I I I'm not interested in that
[1:22:04] kind of thing.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the truth.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Says godly sorrow. Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't in Judah's case, it wasn't
[1:22:14] godly sorrow. And don't forget also that
[1:22:18] after the body is long gone, the spirits
[1:22:20] still around.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Those spirits don't die.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the light of the
[1:22:33] hour. Now, I'm coming down, moving down
[1:22:35] into our time. Come on.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So don't forget that also the shining of
[1:22:41] the light that had to shine for Peter.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Peter had to experience what he
[1:22:48] experienced.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; It had to shine for John
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; being fulfilled. He had to resurrect.
[1:22:56] You might think this is Easter. No,
[1:22:57] we're past Easter. But there's another
[1:23:00] resurrection
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and we want you to know about that.
[1:23:06] had to shine for James and Andrew and
[1:23:08] Thomas.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to say to Thomas, "Stretch
[1:23:14] forth thy hand
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and feel the prince."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Thrust your finger into the prince.
[1:23:21] He had to experience that
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; cuz the sun was shining
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; to eliminate any doubt
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; to invalidate it
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and remove it permanently from him.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what friends, some of us
[1:23:40] need something more than we have yet.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Even in this message, we need something
[1:23:46] more. You might say, "Well, that's
[1:23:47] almost like fanatical." Well, it perhaps
[1:23:50] has to go there and maybe even further.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be left.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hearing what you've heard and preaching
[1:24:02] that has been preached and you don't
[1:24:04] want to be standing on the sidelines.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; You want to become I believe that this
[1:24:08] congregation and all who hear my voice
[1:24:11] even after this service or I I trust
[1:24:13] from the preaching of the brethren the
[1:24:15] kind of services that I've heard. I
[1:24:17] heard brother John Andy's the other
[1:24:19] night as a masterpiece of a service and
[1:24:22] it was really up to-date.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; You especially to the young people, you
[1:24:26] want to take and absorb those things.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Don't go out like this is some school
[1:24:31] class and you just wait for the next
[1:24:33] one. Not that
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; you want to absorb these things.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And so Thomas needed that. The other
[1:24:42] disciples needed it.
[1:24:44] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary Mary
[1:24:46] Magdalene who maybe you wouldn't want as
[1:24:48] a neighbor who had seven devils cast out
[1:24:51] of her.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what friends, I'm so humbled
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; at the mercy and the longsuffering and
[1:25:03] the greatness
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:08] He even in his death and resurrection
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; shawn to fulfill the scriptures in such
[1:25:14] a way that Mary Mary Magdalene
[1:25:19] mentioned twice at least and and the
[1:25:21] other Mary
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; coming to the tomb and finding it
[1:25:24] unsealed. They had to have that.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; They weren't part of darkness. They were
[1:25:29] part of light. But they needed that
[1:25:32] experience.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And children of light, the scripture
[1:25:35] says you're the children of the light.
[1:25:37] How come your children are light?
[1:25:38] Because you believed. You have to
[1:25:40] believe the manifested word of God,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; the vindicated word of God.
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be deathbed earnest. I
[1:25:51] don't understand everything.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; How how's this going to happen? Or how's
[1:25:56] that going to happen? Or why did the
[1:25:58] prophet say that? I don't know why he
[1:25:59] said that.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I know one thing that I've seen too much
[1:26:03] vindication to deny that.
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:09] And those that want to question, they
[1:26:11] don't want to even look at the
[1:26:12] vindication.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they're they're
[1:26:25] nice people.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; They're good people.
[1:26:31] He said something just
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; something just seems to come over them.
[1:26:36] They they want to take it, but they
[1:26:37] can't take it.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; They want to live it, but they can't
[1:26:41] live it.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I may have that a little later on.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand if the message is
[1:26:50] little
[1:26:52] uh chopped up.
[1:27:05] Cleopus had to have
[1:27:08] Cleopus had to have his his time of such
[1:27:12] terrible sorrow and and and
[1:27:15] disappointment.
[1:27:17] He had to have this his friend with him.
[1:27:21] They had to walk. Otherwise, listen to
[1:27:24] this. Those two men back there, those
[1:27:27] brothers back there, they had to have
[1:27:29] that. And they only had that by the
[1:27:31] sunshining in resurrection power. Now,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; it was fulfilled. It was fulfilled. It
[1:27:37] was fulfilled. That it might be
[1:27:38] fulfilled. That it might be fulfilled.
[1:27:40] Every time you hear that, you just got
[1:27:41] to think the sun is shining stronger,
[1:27:43] stronger, stronger, stronger.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Not shining for the weed, shining for
[1:27:47] the weak.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; There's a life there. And I'm preaching
[1:27:53] today because I believe there's a life
[1:27:54] there
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; that's greater than all of the conflicts
[1:27:59] and the darkness of this world. I don't
[1:28:01] care anything about the darkness. People
[1:28:03] will have to do what they have to do.
[1:28:05] Family will have to do what they have to
[1:28:06] do. Unbelievers will have to do what
[1:28:09] they have to do. And it's the sun that's
[1:28:11] shining
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; that's causing the darkness
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; to congregate
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; to congregate.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely bizarre. I mean I find
[1:28:26] it absolutely almost almost uh
[1:28:29] unbelievable who joins together. People
[1:28:32] joined together have absolutely nothing
[1:28:34] in common. in fact is they bitterly
[1:28:37] oppose one another, but they will join
[1:28:39] forces against this word.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? They don't join forces
[1:28:45] against some of the dark godless
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; countries and and and people that don't
[1:28:52] even believe in God,
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Why don't they take up to talk about
[1:28:57] that?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Talk about a godly life.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; A flawless life, a pristine life.
[1:29:07] Isn't that incredible?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; The only way in the message shalom, the
[1:29:21] only way as God was, Jesus Christ was
[1:29:26] the manifestation of God's spoken word,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; the light of the hour.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Glory.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; There's a man who can turn on the light.
[1:29:36] He says, "Now great light the Gentiles
[1:29:38] who sat in the regions of the shadows of
[1:29:41] death. Great life,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; great light sprung up among them
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; in Zabilon and Nephilim sir
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; by the way of Galilee of the Gentiles.
[1:29:51] Great light. They saw a great light.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm a Gentile and I'm so glad I saw a
[1:29:57] great light.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that the light came across
[1:30:00] my way." And what happened in the
[1:30:03] darkness? It congregated and fled
[1:30:05] someplace.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus moved steadfastly to Calvary
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; and to the transition from son of man.
[1:30:18] Now, here for some of you that perhaps
[1:30:20] are visiting or some that are uh on the
[1:30:23] internet and have not heard, I want to I
[1:30:27] want to have you have a paradigm shift.
[1:30:33] The account of the crucifixion,
[1:30:37] the account of the crucifixion and the
[1:30:40] death and the burial of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:42] the resurrection
[1:30:44] that's so fixed in the minds of
[1:30:46] Christianity. Yeah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; As being that's what it was. We have
[1:30:50] Easter and so on so forth.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That was even much more than just the
[1:30:56] death. That was a transition
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; from mortal to immortality
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; to lay out a pattern
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; for the believers
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; that this is how it happens. And then
[1:31:10] when a prophet comes in the end time,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; his second last message,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; just as he's getting ready those lips to
[1:31:19] be sealed,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; the second last message,
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; he goes to that Luke. Now, many of you
[1:31:25] have heard me say this, but it not
[1:31:27] enough times. He goes back to Luke 24.
[1:31:30] If it was enough times, you'd go and
[1:31:32] read and study Luke 24 carefully.
[1:31:37] and Luke 24 and he says modern event not
[1:31:42] historical event
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; modern event
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; this is going to be a modern happening
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; modern event made clear why made clear
[1:31:52] because it's not clear
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; by the prophecy
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; it's a prophecy
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; you'll have the same circumstances
[1:32:01] the same thing happening what will be
[1:32:04] happening the sun will shine again
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; and there will be a time of rapid
[1:32:10] fulfillment of scripture.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; There will come an end time when the
[1:32:15] scripture starts being fulfilled so fast
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; that there will be a bewildered people.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; There might be a disappointed people.
[1:32:23] There might be a people who say what
[1:32:25] what's all this darkness of all the all
[1:32:27] this government and all the institutions
[1:32:29] and all these organizations
[1:32:32] against us and and all these in all
[1:32:35] these things happening and people who
[1:32:37] were our friends and people who are
[1:32:39] believers and or we thought they were
[1:32:42] believers. We don't know. And then we'll
[1:32:44] finally find out the sun shining will
[1:32:47] determine who's a believer, who's not a
[1:32:50] believer.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sun shining will cause
[1:32:55] the darkness to congregate.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; The sun being spoken for the sun the s o
[1:33:02] the s u n is the result of the spoken
[1:33:05] word of god. And when the sun begin to
[1:33:08] shine darkness was pressed to the other
[1:33:10] side of the world.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And when the sun arises in your life
[1:33:16] darkness went.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; How many can say that happened in your
[1:33:20] case? Darkness went.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I can raise both hands.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Darkness went
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; when the sun shone.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; When the son of righteousness arose
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; in your personal life,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; the darkness was banished
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; and went to the other side.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You can't even find it. And in this age,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; in the harvest time,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; and this is the harvest time. Why is it
[1:33:50] the harvest time? Because the scriptures
[1:33:53] are being fulfilled
[1:33:55] and in the message uh there's a not
[1:33:59] there's a man who can the flashing light
[1:34:01] of his coming. I believe was the
[1:34:03] flashing light of his coming and they
[1:34:05] were and the people and he says what was
[1:34:07] all that movement? What was all that
[1:34:09] noise down there? What was all the noise
[1:34:12] when they saw this light? What was all
[1:34:15] the noise? because it was the scriptures
[1:34:18] being fulfilled
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; and that's what's caused the stir.
[1:34:22] What's caused a stir? Even in this
[1:34:24] congregation, people are discovering
[1:34:27] scripture in their time is being
[1:34:30] fulfilled.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; That's their scripture.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And when you realize that scripture
[1:34:37] speaks of me, then you can say my light
[1:34:40] has come.
[1:34:42] That's my light
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; that came to give me make me alive
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Young men, this isn't just a sermon.
[1:34:55] This is for you
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; young ladies. This is for you.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; This congregation is for you.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; When you see that the word of God has
[1:35:04] come and made alive in your heart and
[1:35:06] you can say, "That's my light
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; that came to give me life.
[1:35:12] And that light is shining to press the
[1:35:15] darkness back.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need to participate in darkness.
[1:35:19] What's all this nonsense about? I don't
[1:35:22] have any part of it. It has no part of
[1:35:24] me.
[1:35:25] [Applause]
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; The intense harvest son.
[1:35:37] Oh yeah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Incidentally, that is the title of my
[1:35:40] message.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; The season of the harvest son.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; The intense harvest son brought all a ll
[1:35:50] the seeds to their maturity.
[1:35:54] Whether it be a Caiaphas, as I said, or
[1:35:56] a Herod or a Judas. And the Bible, your
[1:35:59] Bible says that
[1:36:01] Caiaphas and or rather Pilate and Herod
[1:36:05] had been enemies up to that time.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; They even found their friendship.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; They could find they found that they had
[1:36:13] a common a common cause.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And they joined together. Think of that
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; enemies.
[1:36:21] And that'll be a game.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And it is even now
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; when people have absolutely no agreement
[1:36:27] with one another, but they will agree on
[1:36:29] one point that we're opposed to this
[1:36:31] word.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Praise God."
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest evidence of the
[1:36:37] truth.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; They always did it.
[1:36:42] [Applause]
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:36:53] hold in your heart and hold in your mind
[1:36:55] this transition from one office to
[1:36:58] another
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; because there's a multitude of people
[1:37:02] serving a historical Jesus that doesn't
[1:37:05] exist.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; He's not someone walking in the sands on
[1:37:11] the shores of Galilee
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; with the flowers touching his feet.
[1:37:15] That's just
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; some emotional
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; who knows what
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; whimper weepy nothing.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He came first as a prophet and they
[1:37:30] crucified him.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; His own crucified him.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; He came as the son of man.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; The son of man.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; The fourth man in the fire.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He was before that. Then after the Holy
[1:37:44] Spirit came, he was then the son of God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; He was the Holy Spirit, son of God.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; He lived through the church ages.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; As the son of God
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and in the millennium,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; he'll be son of David
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; sitting upon the throne of his father
[1:38:05] David.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He is the son of David.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And remember between
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; the son of God. and remember.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be people that
[1:38:17] would be after this that would hear this
[1:38:19] and read this and he's saying and
[1:38:21] remember
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; between
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; the son of God
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; in the Leodysian church age
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; they put him out
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; and Luke see now you may think this is a
[1:38:35] little overboard but I don't think you
[1:38:37] will.
[1:38:39] They put him out. That is why they had
[1:38:41] to close all the doors on William
[1:38:43] Brandham.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I perhaps haven't told this church maybe
[1:38:49] once or twice, but when I'm away in the
[1:38:52] conventions quite often I do, and I did
[1:38:54] in Switzerland just a few days ago, and
[1:38:57] brother Brandham told me
[1:39:00] that he was off the he was in a side
[1:39:03] room at a Christian Businessman
[1:39:05] International convention. He was the
[1:39:08] speaker. They would use his name to get
[1:39:10] crowds.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; So, they have a big crowd. They go on
[1:39:13] with their singing and they go on with
[1:39:14] how how God made them rich and how much
[1:39:17] money they're giving and all the things
[1:39:19] that they're doing and and and he's
[1:39:21] sitting there waiting to come to the
[1:39:22] platform. The doors open. He's looking
[1:39:25] right at the man at the at the podium.
[1:39:27] And the man at the podium says, "I'm
[1:39:28] very sorry, ladies and gentlemen, to
[1:39:32] announce tonight that Brother William
[1:39:33] Brandham's not able to be with us. He'd
[1:39:35] been called to the bedside of his either
[1:39:38] sick brother or somebody. Brother Brham
[1:39:41] was sitting there looking at him.
[1:39:44] Billy Paul said to me, I he said, "I can
[1:39:46] tell you the man's name."
[1:39:50] And I'm stunned.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was telling me this
[1:39:55] and I said to Brother Brandon, I said,
[1:39:57] "Brother Brand,
[1:39:59] because this is what I would have done."
[1:40:03] I said, "Why didn't you walk out on the
[1:40:06] platform?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Why didn't you just walk out on the
[1:40:11] platform and say, "Hi, folks.
[1:40:16] Now you know what he is."
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And when I said that, he said, "Oh," he
[1:40:23] put his head back. He said, "Oh," he
[1:40:25] said, "I could never do that."
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And right away, I said to myself,
[1:40:29] "That's why I'm not a prophet.
[1:40:33] I could do that
[1:40:35] and and and and probably a lot of you
[1:40:37] folks would too.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; You'd come jumping out and said, "No,
[1:40:40] I'm I'm here."
[1:40:44] He wouldn't put them in bad light. Said,
[1:40:46] "I couldn't do that." That kind of a
[1:40:49] person. And yet yet they can find no
[1:40:53] squeeze around to find some thing.
[1:40:59] And remember between and in the
[1:41:00] Leodysian church age they put him out.
[1:41:03] And in Luke he said he would be revealed
[1:41:06] again. In Luke 17:30 he would be
[1:41:08] revealed again as a son of man the
[1:41:11] prophet fulfilling the rest of it.
[1:41:14] Listen friends this is what this
[1:41:15] messenger left.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; He left not so he not for somebody to
[1:41:20] build some organization on
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; but it is that because there were things
[1:41:24] that were spoken that would pertain to
[1:41:26] days ahead. Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And we are in those days.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; We're in these times.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; And and and I can understand amongst
[1:41:33] believers saying, "Oh, it's going to be
[1:41:34] this way or it's going to be this way.
[1:41:36] It's going to be that way." That's fine
[1:41:37] that, you know, I I don't know. I I
[1:41:39] would take a hard look at it and and see
[1:41:41] how it's going to be because Jesus said
[1:41:43] all kinds of things they didn't
[1:41:45] understand. What could be difficult
[1:41:47] about saying, "Uh, the son of man is
[1:41:49] going to be killed, going to be
[1:41:50] crucified, and after three days he'll
[1:41:53] raise again."
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And they were saddened by it.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:00] But he'll be revealed again.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And they said the scriptures tie
[1:42:04] perfectly together. Son of man, son of
[1:42:06] God, son of David. What was it?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It's the same God
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Just changing his form.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And Morphe, he just changed it.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; It's a great drama to him. He's acting
[1:42:22] it out. And so now I want to take the
[1:42:24] entire crucifixion and resurrection
[1:42:27] scene
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; and say to you it's changing its form.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; That's really what's happening.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Did he change his form?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; He went in a bleeding.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; He stood and he stood out and talked to
[1:42:40] Mary.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He went in mutilated.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; But now he's in a different form.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And in that form it's it's it's it's
[1:42:50] hazy.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's not clear.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Uh he said things but we we don't
[1:42:55] understand it
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and now he looks like the gardener. Sir,
[1:42:59] where did you take him and that I may go
[1:43:01] to him and they're talking to him.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; He changed his form
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; and all these things happen. You've got
[1:43:08] at because the sun is shining so strong.
[1:43:11] You have believers and they don't quite
[1:43:14] understand perfectly everything that's
[1:43:16] happen but they're believers.
[1:43:18] Wherever he took him, I'll go to him.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Where there was spices, he didn't need
[1:43:24] the spices, but but he knew what was in
[1:43:27] their heart.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; They were believers.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. This one was cast out seven
[1:43:33] demons out of her, but she was free.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; and the other Mary
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; and the other women that were there,
[1:43:42] they were believers. The sun had to
[1:43:44] shine on them. They had to see the
[1:43:47] resurrection had happened. They couldn't
[1:43:49] understand the resurrection. We don't
[1:43:51] understand it.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand everything.
[1:43:54] You have to believe it.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; You have to believe what you can't
[1:43:58] understand.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; We're not here interested in anybody's
[1:44:01] opinion because your opinion is going to
[1:44:04] be wrong. What if it's wrong? What if I
[1:44:05] put my faith in your opinion and it
[1:44:07] doesn't happen? You say, "Well, well,
[1:44:09] I'm sorry." No, that's not good enough.
[1:44:11] God's not going to say, "I'm sorry." He
[1:44:14] doesn't have to say that. He just says
[1:44:16] things and we believe it and we just go
[1:44:18] on and move and say, "Father, I'm not
[1:44:20] too sure what's happening, but I'm a
[1:44:22] believer."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; And I know one thing that this was your
[1:44:26] vindication. No man could do these
[1:44:29] things.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what was in John's gospel
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; when when Nicodemus came to Jesus.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; No man can do these things. We know
[1:44:39] you're of God.
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:44] He was a leader.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Dramatic events take place
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; at the change of form because it's also
[1:44:58] a change of administration.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It's a change of order.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And in this time, friends,
[1:45:05] you're all it's a mixed audience here.
[1:45:08] But let me tell you something. that many
[1:45:11] of you know
[1:45:13] and I just want to say it to impress
[1:45:15] myself even further.
[1:45:18] This is a different season.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming in flesh as a lad.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And don't forget that these process
[1:45:27] sometimes things people think oh they
[1:45:29] just happen you know bang and it's all
[1:45:32] over. No, no. Jesus, his first coming,
[1:45:36] the season of that son began to come,
[1:45:39] began to happen
[1:45:41] when John the Baptist was conceived.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And then maybe nine months later, he was
[1:45:48] born.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; And during that time, Jesus is
[1:45:52] conceived.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, the Messiah is on the
[1:45:56] road.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; You can't deny that. The Messiah is on.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; We can say Jesus is coming.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And when he was born, we can say Jesus
[1:46:09] is here.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt call his name Jesus
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; for he'll he'll he'll save his people
[1:46:14] from their sins.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Who is it that was born? Jesus was born.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; The Messiah was born.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; 30 years later, during that time, John
[1:46:27] the Baptist has his head cut off. Right.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; What a record.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; The great the great the one to forun the
[1:46:36] one that Isaiah prophesied about. He's
[1:46:38] got his head cut off.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. That must have been for
[1:46:42] a just cause.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Was that a great spiritual
[1:46:46] cause? Well, a little girl danced.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:46:51] must be something wrong with that. Maybe
[1:46:53] he wasn't the person we believed he was.
[1:46:57] Maybe he wasn't the spirit of Elijah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a that that's what
[1:47:02] Zachchariah said.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but you know, he's just a priest
[1:47:06] anyway.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Is there any reason to doubt? Well,
[1:47:12] yeah, we have a lot of reason to doubt.
[1:47:14] Was there anybody recorded it? No. Well,
[1:47:16] nobody really recorded it.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, well then, you know,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; then it puts doubt, cast doubt on any
[1:47:24] everything. Then I'd turn around and
[1:47:26] say, "Well, who are you?"
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; What What's your vindication?
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I h I have a prophet. And you got you
[1:47:36] got something problem with something
[1:47:37] that he said. I happen to be I happen to
[1:47:40] be with the man who
[1:47:43] works for a mining company.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I was introduced to him
[1:47:48] by brother Ernest Phil Fulture.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. and and I was introduced to this
[1:47:54] man
[1:47:58] and I heard that he had uh he'd been to
[1:48:01] brother Ernest Fulture took him to one
[1:48:03] of William Brown's meetings. He never
[1:48:05] knew the man, never saw the man, never
[1:48:07] heard the name before
[1:48:09] and they go and find out where he's
[1:48:11] having a meeting and go into the meeting
[1:48:13] and he's just sitting in the
[1:48:14] congregation.
[1:48:16] He's waiting right now for an operation.
[1:48:18] At that time he was waiting for an
[1:48:19] operation because the the mining company
[1:48:22] he worked for had discovered a big tumor
[1:48:26] the size of a man's fist in his left
[1:48:29] lung and they they sent him to three
[1:48:33] hospitals around at Bristol in Tennessee
[1:48:35] Bristol and Kingsport and another one
[1:48:38] because they wanted to find out what is
[1:48:40] the degree of their uh liability
[1:48:44] to this man who's now been not given too
[1:48:47] long limit. And that hospital said, "You
[1:48:50] got to have that out within within the
[1:48:52] next month. We got to take that out.
[1:48:55] We're going to book a hospital for you
[1:48:56] right away." And he said, "Well, just
[1:48:58] hold off." And and his pastor, who was
[1:49:02] his pastor then, Reverend Ernest
[1:49:04] Fulture, drove him to Brother Brandham's
[1:49:06] meetings. He's sitting in the service
[1:49:09] and brother Brandham says
[1:49:12] these words.
[1:49:17] I'm kind of ahead of myself, but that's
[1:49:19] all right, I suppose.
[1:49:25] And if you want to hear it,
[1:49:28] we have it
[1:49:32] we have it uh on a disc.
[1:49:39] And he said, "Let the God that wrote the
[1:49:43] word, if he is God,
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; let him come." Now,
[1:49:50] uh
[1:49:52] I I thought I just I I know that now I'm
[1:49:55] going to come across it when I
[1:50:03] Anyway, I'll I'll come across it and
[1:50:05] I'll read it for you if we have time.
[1:50:08] And he says, "Let the God that wrote the
[1:50:11] word, if he is God, let him come now
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; and show himself or prove that he's God.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; The God that wrote the word,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; let him come now."
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; And he and he stands and he says,
[1:50:24] "There's a man in big audience." He
[1:50:26] said, "There's a man out here." And he
[1:50:28] calls out a minister. And he said, "You
[1:50:30] you've got a bad throat and you're under
[1:50:33] pressure because you have to get out of
[1:50:34] here because you have some appointments.
[1:50:37] Reverend Smith, go your way. And then he
[1:50:40] says, "Now this other man," he said,
[1:50:43] "and you have you've been examined. You
[1:50:46] have a tumor and it's in your left lung
[1:50:49] and you're up for an operation right
[1:50:51] away." He said, "You have been a mine
[1:50:55] worker."
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And the reason why he said, "I have been
[1:50:59] a mind worker." He never went back to be
[1:51:01] a mind worker. He became a pastor. and
[1:51:04] he pastored for many years in Virginia.
[1:51:07] And uh he said, "You have been a mine
[1:51:10] worker and you're up for an operation
[1:51:12] right away." And he says, "Mr. Mitchell,
[1:51:16] go home to Virginia
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; and be well."
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And he went right back to the same
[1:51:21] hospitals where he had to have this
[1:51:23] operation. And they took it. They took
[1:51:26] another X-ray and could not find the
[1:51:28] tumor. It was not there. And he and he
[1:51:32] and he lived many years. I know him very
[1:51:34] well. And we went right to went right
[1:51:37] went right to the uh uh uh the Ron Oak
[1:51:42] television studio. They charged us $120.
[1:51:45] Never forget it. And it was the best
[1:51:48] best 120 we ever spent. And we had an
[1:51:50] engineer and cameraman and all the rest
[1:51:52] of it and told the story. And when we're
[1:51:54] done, one of the men, one of the
[1:51:56] directors come down. He's already
[1:51:58] crying. He said, "My" He said, 'I want
[1:52:00] you to pray for my brother. He's got
[1:52:02] cancer. And another another the director
[1:52:05] came down and he said, he said, 'You
[1:52:07] know what? He said, I can't believe I
[1:52:10] can't believe he said, you men sat here
[1:52:12] and we did 20 minutes, over 20 minutes
[1:52:15] without stopping the cameras once. He
[1:52:17] said that only took us 20 minutes. He
[1:52:20] said, I had the governor of the state
[1:52:22] here doing a 4-minute advertisement and
[1:52:25] took us a half a day. But he said the
[1:52:27] difference is you fellas are telling the
[1:52:29] truth.
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Those are his words
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and we were telling the truth and you
[1:52:37] can still hear it and it's still the
[1:52:38] truth.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And the one who spoke it through the
[1:52:42] messenger
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; is still the truth.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; It's the fourth man in the fire. The
[1:52:48] fourth man in the fire stood for brother
[1:52:51] Mitchell
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; between him and the flames
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; and him and this killer and him between
[1:52:56] him and this demon and delivered him.
[1:52:59] We're not just talking about a God now.
[1:53:01] Now we're talking about a God changing
[1:53:03] his form.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And in this end time, this is where it
[1:53:07] has to shine. This is where these
[1:53:09] scriptures, these fulfillment, that's
[1:53:12] where the intensity
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; we talk about Luke 17:30, but no, no, in
[1:53:16] the revealing of the son of man, there
[1:53:18] was a lot of scriptures that had to be
[1:53:20] fulfilled.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Please let me carry on.
[1:53:40] And the reason I'm being so precise is I
[1:53:42] I do not want to leave anything out if
[1:53:46] too possible
[1:53:50] in the message convinced and concerned.
[1:53:53] Then two men,
[1:53:55] brother Brown calls it an oral Roberts
[1:53:58] and a Tom and a
[1:54:03] Billy Graham
[1:54:05] and went down and preached to Sodom to
[1:54:07] Lot. That was a nominal sleeping virgin,
[1:54:10] a representation of it. And they
[1:54:13] preached repentance and never done that
[1:54:15] much of a miracle. They blinded the
[1:54:17] people. Of course, preaching of the
[1:54:19] gospel blinds the unbeliever.
[1:54:22] And the greatest news flash, they had
[1:54:26] they had their messengers and their eyes
[1:54:28] were blinded to the door.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; But the elected group saw God manifested
[1:54:34] in the flesh. Isn't that the most
[1:54:36] incredible thing? The elected group
[1:54:38] because one of the messengers stayed
[1:54:40] back with Abraham.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; One of the messengers turned his back,
[1:54:44] which we have seen happen, and you have
[1:54:47] had it on record many times as well. But
[1:54:50] the elected received God in flesh. Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Is that too strong?"
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; You have to be deity in flesh.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Did not Jesus is Jesus deity? You say,
[1:55:01] "Well, yes, he's deity." Jesus said, "I
[1:55:04] will be in you."
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; How's that?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I will be in you.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; You will be in me.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; I will be in the Father. Is that so?
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture says?
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It's time to believe it.
[1:55:19] People
[1:55:22] say, "Well, I haven't got I I didn't get
[1:55:24] anything. I don't get it." Maybe you
[1:55:26] maybe your believing needs to increase.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe the son
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; and the revealed word
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; has to take a hold in your life
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and you'll start seeing God do things.
[1:55:43] You know, we're of the we're the kind of
[1:55:44] people, well, you have to try it out and
[1:55:46] test it and prove it and all these
[1:55:48] things and finally come to a general
[1:55:50] consensus and this one found it. So,
[1:55:52] that one found it so. I like what our
[1:55:54] brother Steven, brother Steven, you're
[1:55:56] sitting right here. He he just got
[1:55:58] introduced to the message. He doesn't
[1:56:00] know volumes of what the message perhaps
[1:56:02] doesn't know volumes of the scripture.
[1:56:05] But when he found out God sent a proven
[1:56:08] vindicated messenger, a prophet,
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; he just said, "I don't care whether they
[1:56:13] agreed with it. I don't care whether
[1:56:14] they could prove it or not." The prophet
[1:56:16] said it and that was enough.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we we people,
[1:56:22] civilized and cultured people, we need
[1:56:25] to understand what a prophet is.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You need to go into the Bible and find
[1:56:29] out what a prophet is.
[1:56:31] instead of having a bunch of scarecrows.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; There's false prophets. There's all
[1:56:36] kinds of them
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; because I have no no proof whatsoever.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; I have a very very dear lovely friend, a
[1:56:43] Catholic friend. We're very close. In
[1:56:45] fact, as I saw him for the first time in
[1:56:47] many many years just a week or two ago,
[1:56:51] we were listening to a tape. I was
[1:56:53] listening to he was in my car and we're
[1:56:54] riding in my car and I had on one of
[1:56:57] brother Bham's tapes and he comes to the
[1:57:00] discerning of the people and and telling
[1:57:02] the secret of their heart one after the
[1:57:04] other after the other and I said
[1:57:09] call him by name. I said did you ever
[1:57:10] have a pope do that?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I just said very lovingly, very
[1:57:16] respectfully,
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; have you ever had a pope do that?
[1:57:20] He looked down. And he just thought for
[1:57:22] a moment. He said, "No, I don't think
[1:57:23] so.
[1:57:25] I wanted that to speak to him."
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; You call a man a holy father
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; and all kinds of Protestants aren't even
[1:57:36] troubled with that.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; They talk about the immaculate
[1:57:39] conception
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; of Mary and all kinds of absolute
[1:57:44] blasphemous stuff.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And no, nobody's in an uproar over it.
[1:57:49] But when I talk about William Brham,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; who had all this vindication,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; year after year, meeting after meeting,
[1:57:56] I've been in I've been in over 30
[1:57:58] services myself, over 30 meetings, and
[1:58:00] just saw it again and again and again. I
[1:58:02] said, "How can anybody?"
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody with a seventh grade education
[1:58:06] out of Kentucky ever could even begin to
[1:58:08] do this.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And he would even even ask the ministers
[1:58:11] behind him, would you like to do that?
[1:58:13] Now, after he told a prophet can't say
[1:58:16] something that's not so or not true, I'm
[1:58:19] off on on another subject. But I'll tell
[1:58:22] you what, friends, I was convinced.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad you're convinced.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; They had their messengers. And then this
[1:58:38] day is the scripture fulfilled. He says
[1:58:40] it, and here here's where it is. If you
[1:58:43] preach anything and here's what h
[1:58:44] exactly what happened and you can hear
[1:58:46] it this day is the scripture fulfilled.
[1:58:50] If you preach anything and it's the
[1:58:52] gospel truth then God is obligated to
[1:58:54] vindicate it vindicate that. Is that
[1:58:57] true? Now if that be so let the God that
[1:59:00] wrote the word, let the God that made
[1:59:02] the prophecy, let the God who is God of
[1:59:05] the word come forth and prove that he is
[1:59:08] still God.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; How's that?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; That sounds good, doesn't it? And a few
[1:59:12] lines later, a little just a little bit
[1:59:14] later, he says, "There is a man sitting
[1:59:16] right back here. He is suffering. He's
[1:59:18] got a tumor on his left lung. He isn't
[1:59:20] from here. You have been a mine worker.
[1:59:24] That is right. I'm a total stranger to
[1:59:27] you. If that's right, shake your hand.
[1:59:29] The tumor is in your left lung." If you
[1:59:31] like to see it, get the DVD from the
[1:59:34] office. The tumor is on your left lung
[1:59:36] and you're up for an operation right
[1:59:38] away. That's right. You're not from
[1:59:41] here. You're from out of town. You're
[1:59:43] from Virginia. That's right. You believe
[1:59:46] God knows who you are, Mr. Mitchell.
[1:59:49] That's right. Go home and be well. Jesus
[1:59:52] Christ makes you whole. Ask the man.
[1:59:55] Never seen him in my life. He was
[1:59:58] sitting there praying. This day, this
[2:00:00] scripture
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; is fulfilled.
[2:00:06] What kind of intelligence would want me
[2:00:08] or you to put that aside
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, we're going to tinker
[2:00:13] with something else.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; We're going to listen to somebody who
[2:00:16] hasn't got one scratch of vindication,
[2:00:20] not one ounce of vindication. And we're
[2:00:23] going to take time and take it into our
[2:00:25] brain and listen to that." No. Why are
[2:00:28] these things happening? Or why what what
[2:00:30] kind of season are we in? This is a this
[2:00:32] is a time when everybody has a right to
[2:00:34] say something. Well, because of the
[2:00:36] season that we're in. That's that's the
[2:00:39] reason for it. Everybody should be
[2:00:40] heard. And the whole thing becomes a
[2:00:42] community, a community thing.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord God identifying, vindicating
[2:00:51] his word and showing that's exactly and
[2:00:54] never let nothing be said unless it
[2:00:57] comes to pass perfectly. Now he's
[2:00:59] describing and now uh think of the word
[2:01:03] mixtury
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and people sit and look at that and
[2:01:09] continue right on in their same
[2:01:11] condition
[2:01:13] and they're good people.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; They're fine people.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; But yet it seems like that they can't
[2:01:21] understand.
[2:01:22] Look like they can't get it. He asked
[2:01:25] why. He said, "Here's a sister once had
[2:01:28] lovely long hair and she cut her off.
[2:01:31] Here's a man that once looked like
[2:01:33] looked like he took a stand and went out
[2:01:36] for the thing that was right. He's right
[2:01:38] back in it." He said, "Like a dog to its
[2:01:40] vomit,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; a a hog to its wallow." He say, "Well,
[2:01:44] that's strong." Well, that's a
[2:01:45] scripture.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; He's just saying what's written in the
[2:01:48] scripture. This what's happening
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; and people hear it and they look at it
[2:01:52] and they're fine people. They're good
[2:01:54] people. He said they're sociable people.
[2:01:56] You like to have them. You like to talk
[2:01:58] to them, but it seems they can't take
[2:02:00] it.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; It seems that they can't. They want to,
[2:02:03] but they can't. And he talks about
[2:02:05] sisters and caught in the web of
[2:02:07] fashion.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, young ladies, caught in the web
[2:02:12] of fashion.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I'll read it for you.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And he says that and he feels so sorry
[2:02:18] for them. He said, "I feel sorry for
[2:02:20] them."
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "They're such nice people and
[2:02:23] they seem to be caught in this web. and
[2:02:26] and I feel so sorry for them.
[2:02:30] And so he says,
[2:02:34] and here's a sister and here's a man.
[2:02:37] And he says,
[2:02:40] uh,
[2:02:55] yeah, I I
[2:03:00] says, it seems like there's something
[2:03:03] that has struck our people.
[2:03:07] It struck the world that they don't seem
[2:03:10] to have the understanding
[2:03:13] there's something wrong.
[2:03:15] And the preaching of the gospel, if it's
[2:03:18] not received, blinds the unbeliever.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; See, listen. Now, we're down where the
[2:03:29] rubber hits the road, folks.
[2:03:33] Uh, I'll be glad, of course, when the
[2:03:34] service is over because I just have to I
[2:03:37] have to say some things that they're
[2:03:40] they're not hard, but they're I believe
[2:03:43] that they're true.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; There there's something people come in,
[2:03:49] they're baptized,
[2:03:51] they want to,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; they see the light,
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; and they're influenced
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; somehow.
[2:04:00] And there's a mixture.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through
[2:04:05] family.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through
[2:04:11] education.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; People sell out to it.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through
[2:04:19] business.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through
[2:04:23] opportunity.
[2:04:26] Now, just so you don't think I'm going
[2:04:28] overboard,
[2:04:31] I'm going to talk about a man.
[2:04:34] He wasn't next to William Brandham.
[2:04:37] He wasn't next to Jeremiah or Isaiah.
[2:04:43] He was next to Jesus Christ.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; He was his right-and man.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; He was involved. He was there when they
[2:04:54] sent him out.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; He was there when when they fed the
[2:05:00] people. He He saw the bread multiply
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; and the fishes, cooked fishes, he saw it
[2:05:07] happen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; He was right next to him.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:13] And uh and then when the light began to
[2:05:16] get shine in its intensity, harvest
[2:05:19] light, he was in all of that light,
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; but now the light is shining and the
[2:05:24] word is fulfilled, fulfilled, fulfilled.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And he hears the light say, "One of you
[2:05:30] will betray me."
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; And good believers are saying, "Is it
[2:05:35] me, Brother Tom? Is it me, Brother John?
[2:05:37] Is it me? Is it me, Brother Tim?
[2:05:40] Who who is this? Put everybody under a a
[2:05:44] shadow of question and they're asking
[2:05:47] one another.
[2:05:50] And and Judah said, "Is it me?"
[2:05:55] And Jesus, the light said, "Thou
[2:05:57] sayest."
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; And the others are others are saying,
[2:06:01] "Who's now? How did all this happen?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; We we've had Passover for 30 years.
[2:06:10] We've had Passover for 30 years.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; How did this This was a little different
[2:06:15] because he took a towel this time and
[2:06:17] washed our feet.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; How How did this happen?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; The sun was shining, folks.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't, "Oh, I feel the glory." No,
[2:06:34] no,
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; no. the sunshining sometimes can cause
[2:06:38] very different an examination inside
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; where do I stand and oh I don't want to
[2:06:44] be that and and finally Peter says
[2:06:48] though I die with you um I won't
[2:06:53] surrender
[2:06:54] Jesus said well
[2:06:57] before this is over
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; before all this before the intensity of
[2:07:01] this son you're going to deny me three
[2:07:04] times
[2:07:07] You know, it's amazing. Jesus didn't
[2:07:08] have to preach a big hard sermon and get
[2:07:10] them to repent.
[2:07:12] All Jesus had to do was just
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; look over at him.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; When those two eyes caught,
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; the sun was shining.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; But what's it do for Peter?
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; It put more life into the wheat.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; He went out and wept bitterly and
[2:07:33] repented.
[2:07:38] That's what the sunlight, that's what
[2:07:39] the fulfillment does to wheat.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And finally, the prophet in this age
[2:07:45] says, "The wheat
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; has come back to wheat again."
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; He knew what it was.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; The wheat's come back to wheat again.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends,
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, believers, I'm so glad that you're
[2:07:59] here.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; And when I shake your hand and say, "I'm
[2:08:02] glad that you're here. Glad to hear it.
[2:08:04] I I I just want you to be under the
[2:08:06] effect of what is happening. And and the
[2:08:09] word is at opening up. And we need it.
[2:08:11] We need we need this sunshine.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; We need this light. This isn't some
[2:08:16] gibberish.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; This isn't some light frivolity and
[2:08:20] frothy stuff.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; We know it's heavy duty.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; And people come and go.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; But we'll keep going. I can't do
[2:08:32] anything else.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Just can't do anything else.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Sometime you're almost, you know, I
[2:08:40] can't I can't help it. I'm a believer.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I I just I
[2:08:44] can't help I can't get rid of it.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what happens. Doesn't
[2:08:51] matter who comes or who goes or what
[2:08:54] anybody says or what kind of lie is
[2:08:56] propagated or somebody says, "Did you
[2:08:58] see what's on the internet?" And now I
[2:09:00] haven't got I've got time for the word.
[2:09:02] I haven't seen what's on it.
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:04] [Applause]
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; You understand where I'm coming from?
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, the darkness is congregating
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; because the light is shining.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm not rejoicing that the darkness
[2:09:18] congregates. I'm rejoicing that the
[2:09:20] light is shining.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; The light is my kingdom.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; The word is my That's my world.
[2:09:29] This world's not my home anyway.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Now, folks, don't go home and slip back
[2:09:37] into an old mold or something. If that's
[2:09:39] been part of your diet, put it away.
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And today, the light
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to watch my time. Oh my.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Am I all right for a few more minutes?
[2:09:55] And today, the light of God is the word
[2:09:57] of God made manifest.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; And that's the light made manifest. The
[2:10:01] light is the works of God spoken by the
[2:10:04] word of God brought to life. And it's a
[2:10:08] greater light. Listen to this.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Everyone's attention. It's a greater
[2:10:12] light
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; than it was at the dawn of creation.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; So, I'm so glad I can go out and get a
[2:10:23] suntan. Be glad that you got a light
[2:10:25] that'll take you to another earth,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; another world,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; a new heaven
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; and a new earth.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; And the mixture now is between mortal
[2:10:36] and immortality.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're at.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's why he preached this.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; You might say, well, that that's 30, 40,
[2:10:46] 50 years ago. They could have said that
[2:10:48] of Jesus when he was crucified. said,
[2:10:50] "Well, this was, let me see." John
[2:10:52] talked about him and he was here
[2:10:54] ministering. He was here living with us
[2:10:56] 30 years and now ministered 33 30
[2:11:00] another three years, three and a half
[2:11:01] years. And now, now we're on into
[2:11:04] Pentecost. And Pentecost just started.
[2:11:06] Let me let me just see here from
[2:11:08] Pentecost
[2:11:10] uh according to Scoffield,
[2:11:16] the book of Acts. And we have Pentecost
[2:11:19] happening around 33.
[2:11:22] We have uh we have John or Paul rather
[2:11:27] being converted
[2:11:29] about a year later or so.
[2:11:32] And then towards the end of the book of
[2:11:34] Acts, that's another about another 30
[2:11:38] years. So it's been about 60 years and
[2:11:41] you're still reading it in the book of
[2:11:43] Acts.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that was 60 years ago." That
[2:11:46] doesn't mean anything to God. Talk to
[2:11:49] God about 60 years.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; You understand? We don't understand that
[2:11:58] dimension.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; We don't understand that timeless place.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't understand a prophet
[2:12:05] standing at the pull pit. uh this I gave
[2:12:07] to the people in Switzerland and he says
[2:12:09] uh now and he talks to he talked to two
[2:12:12] individuals and I read the quote and he
[2:12:14] says now you've been to a doctor and and
[2:12:17] they're consulting together and they
[2:12:20] want to remove an organ out of your
[2:12:21] body. Where is he? Tell me.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I'd like some of the smart people to put
[2:12:28] websites together. Tell me where he is.
[2:12:32] Tell me, where is that man standing on
[2:12:34] the pullpit in front of in front of this
[2:12:36] man?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I ask you as a congregation, where is
[2:12:39] he?
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's seeing a dream. No, he's not
[2:12:43] seeing a dream. He's seeing a vision.
[2:12:46] He's He calls it a vision. He's actually
[2:12:48] in another realm.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you now, explain this one.
[2:12:51] He says, "I'm in two worlds." Amen.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; And what was happening at the
[2:12:55] crucifixion, please now catch this,
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; is the merging of those worlds.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Here's Jesus Christ in another world.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Walking in the same dust.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's some things we need
[2:13:09] to learn about the resurrection that's
[2:13:11] going to take place
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be the way
[2:13:14] most people think.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be the way most people
[2:13:17] are taught.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; And there he is in another world. Yeah,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; the two worlds are merging.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand what I'm saying.
[2:13:27] And once again for the first time in
[2:13:29] history actually have a messenger a
[2:13:32] prophet messenger standing on the earth
[2:13:35] in another world in this one and in that
[2:13:39] one and telling you this person's life
[2:13:41] that person's life in another world.
[2:13:44] What they did last week and what they
[2:13:46] did then and stands here preaching the
[2:13:48] word and telling us what the serpent did
[2:13:51] and how he looked 6,000 years ago.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; How come? Well, anybody that can hear a
[2:13:56] doctor that speaks a a week ago can
[2:13:59] certainly tell what what Adam said and
[2:14:02] what Adam did 6,000. What's the
[2:14:05] difference in eternity with 6,000 years
[2:14:08] one day or a multi-million years
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; and to have that same messenger with
[2:14:13] that kind of indication? Are you
[2:14:15] listening to me students? Say what God
[2:14:18] had in the back part of his mind. That's
[2:14:21] this.
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:24] And when he says my peace, that's why
[2:14:27] I'm talking to you today. That's why I'm
[2:14:29] speaking.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; I give you I give you peace.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Who's talking?
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; You tell me it's a man. That's fine for
[2:14:40] you. That that that's what you get.
[2:14:45] He says to someone standing in front of
[2:14:47] him, if you think that if you think this
[2:14:49] is of Satan, that's where your reward
[2:14:51] will come from. If you think this is of
[2:14:54] God, that's where a reward will come
[2:14:56] from. Either come from the kingdom of
[2:14:59] darkness or the kingdom of light. Make
[2:15:01] your choice. I say it's God speaking to
[2:15:04] me.
[2:15:06] God using the vessel.
[2:15:09] God speaking.
[2:15:11] God has said to this people, "Show
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; God's peace."
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Not as the world gives it.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; You go out there, you're in a bunch of
[2:15:20] mystery.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; You don't know if you have it or you do
[2:15:24] have it.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; It's an age of mystery.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; And the mystery is between
[2:15:32] the mortal and the immortal because
[2:15:34] we're moving in that room.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I didn't quite want
[2:15:40] to get there." Well, do you want to go
[2:15:42] or don't you?
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; You want to go to heaven or don't you?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; You want to go into an immortal life.
[2:15:47] Thank God. Thank God for a messenger
[2:15:50] that will announce to us. It's a time of
[2:15:53] mystery, but breaking. He said it's a
[2:15:55] new day breaking between mortal and
[2:15:58] immortality.
[2:16:00] Oh, I want the sun to shine on me. Shine
[2:16:04] on me. Shine on me.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; From an all, he said sick bound world.
[2:16:14] All the sickness and the affliction and
[2:16:16] the trouble and the sickness that is
[2:16:18] right here in this congregation. The sun
[2:16:21] is shining, friends.
[2:16:24] The sun,
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; the sun is rising
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; with healing in his wings
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; for these mortal bodies
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; and the sun is is is rising.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; It is. It's not. Is it the rising of the
[2:16:40] sun? He said it is the rising of the
[2:16:43] sun. Good morning, bride.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Shalom, bride.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; God's peace.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:53] [Music]
[2:17:02] In this day, the Janice and the Jambers
[2:17:06] have to come.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Not because we're going to say, "Oh,
[2:17:10] this one is that that none of my
[2:17:12] business." The sun does it all.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; The fulfillment does it all.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm announcing to this
[2:17:19] congregation, you don't have to do a
[2:17:20] thing.
[2:17:22] You don't have to do a thing.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; You just believe.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Make yourself yielded to the word
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; and leave all the rest up to God.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; The son will do it.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; The fulfillment will do it.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; You live the life.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; You live the message. You live the
[2:17:38] sermon and the son and the fulfillment
[2:17:41] in you will do the rest. Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Things that the sun will do.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; And this great darkness that's swinging
[2:17:55] over the earth now is 58. It's swinging
[2:18:00] over the earth now
[2:18:03] is nothing but to declare that the light
[2:18:06] is pressing its way down.
[2:18:10] Friends, when you read that when you
[2:18:12] read this message, you need to read it
[2:18:14] more than just a book.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; You have to read it with a concept.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Is a prophet speaking
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; and much of this is from another
[2:18:26] dimension. When I say much of this,
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; because certainly it's a man,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; he might say, you know, I got a flat
[2:18:33] tire. That isn't thus sayith the Lord.
[2:18:34] That's thus said the flat tire.
[2:18:40] You understand what I'm saying?
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; So, I'm tired. You know, I need to have
[2:18:45] a rest or something. You know, I was
[2:18:49] with him for
[2:18:51] many, many days at a time.
[2:18:54] And we'd rest and talk about things and
[2:18:56] have be in a restaurant and have lunch
[2:18:59] and whatever, just talk about. And he
[2:19:02] said, "I like being with you, brothers."
[2:19:05] Said, "You treat me like a man.
[2:19:08] That's what he wanted.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Place where he could relax and get his
[2:19:12] mind free.
[2:19:14] But now he says
[2:19:19] the light is pressing its way down.
[2:19:22] He said if death is hanging so close,
[2:19:26] what is it doing it? It's life like a
[2:19:30] coming. The resurrection, the Easter for
[2:19:32] all of God's children is hanging low.
[2:19:34] It's pressing. The angels are coming
[2:19:36] down. The Holy Spirit's moving in.
[2:19:40] Darkness is taking its last toll.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; For light will soon be here.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to this announcement. Christ will
[2:19:46] come. The joy and the hope of the ages.
[2:19:49] A real resurrection for all believers.
[2:19:52] For we will share with him in his
[2:19:54] resurrection as we have shared with him
[2:19:57] in his suffering. Then in 64. Now we've
[2:20:00] gone from 58 to 64. The hour is upon us.
[2:20:04] Darkness grows. Darkness grow darkness
[2:20:06] upon the people. That's what it is. What
[2:20:10] does it all mean? Where where are we
[2:20:13] standing? The hour. What hour are we in?
[2:20:17] How close are we to the coming? Fear not
[2:20:20] little flock.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; It's the father's good pleasure to give
[2:20:24] you the kingdom. What does it mean? God
[2:20:27] has be to separate the light from the
[2:20:29] darkness. Not the darkness is coming. He
[2:20:32] said, "Now God's be to separate it,
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; pressing it behind
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; like he did in the beginning to show the
[2:20:39] dawn of a new day." That's what's
[2:20:42] happening.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; And and and the church ages are fading
[2:20:46] out. God is pressing the darkness into a
[2:20:48] place. It has to do it to fade out the
[2:20:51] church organization and fade out the
[2:20:53] world. You are not. You are not of the
[2:20:56] world, little children.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Who's talking
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; to me? It's a God's authorized voice.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; You are not of the world, little
[2:21:05] children. You are of heaven, and this is
[2:21:09] not your home.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to rejoice over
[2:21:13] that.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Not a preacher telling you,
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; not just a prophet, not a minister
[2:21:21] telling you,
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; not a musician, not a ortor telling you
[2:21:26] God speaking.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; You're from heaven.
[2:21:30] is not your home.
[2:21:32] And then in further on in that same he
[2:21:35] said that's him among us
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; who not not not the man not the
[2:21:41] messenger said that that's him among us
[2:21:44] his word being identified shalom in this
[2:21:48] congregation we ought to be able to well
[2:21:52] I'm sure that you can I say to you
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; on the basis of this word shalom
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; peace go out these doors with peace.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Peace that passes all understanding.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of gross darkness on
[2:22:10] the people.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; It's not here to trouble you.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; It's here to bring peace.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; The great day is fixing to break. When
[2:22:23] the morning breaks eternal bright and
[2:22:25] fair, when his chosen ones will gather
[2:22:28] to their home beyond the sky. When the
[2:22:31] role is called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Our names are on his book.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Our names are on his book.
[2:22:39] [Applause]
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; You're my friends.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; You come to the congregation.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; You serve God.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; What more what more blessed thing could
[2:22:54] we say? Say your name
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; is on the book. Amen.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; How are you ever going to be lost with
[2:23:00] your name on the book?
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Well, if I turn away and if I backslide,
[2:23:06] you just try to backslide.
[2:23:09] If you're a wheat and the life has come
[2:23:11] and the wheat can't become a weed, it
[2:23:14] can't become a weed.
[2:23:27] Let's hear it.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Let's hear it.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; When the role is called up yonder, I'll
[2:23:33] be there.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Our name,
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; our names are on the book.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Would you care to say that, please?
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Our names are on the book.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; And say the next one, we'll be there.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; We'll be there.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; We'll be there.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; We'll be there.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Peace to you.
[2:23:55] Peace unto you.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; The darkness is separating itself
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; from the light.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Not the darkness is pressing down or the
[2:24:05] darkness is leaving, but the darkness is
[2:24:08] separating itself from the light.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; That's where you live.
[2:24:19] [Applause]
[2:24:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; God's causing it.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; God's causing it.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; The lights doing it.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The light's pressing itself
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; in such a way until the darkness has to
[2:24:54] congregate together.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; The lights doing it.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Friends, we're in this season.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; People hear this messenger's voice
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; and it so aggravates and irritates the
[2:25:09] spirit that's in them. They have to
[2:25:11] congregate together
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; and they don't agree, but they have to
[2:25:16] congregate together. And God doesn't
[2:25:19] want any of his children lapping it all
[2:25:21] up and they say what they say and hear
[2:25:24] what they said about us or or about me.
[2:25:27] Who cares?
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Can you picture wheat laying there in
[2:25:35] all of its beauty? and the shock is
[2:25:37] pulled away and the weed is standing
[2:25:39] there in all its beauty and says, "You
[2:25:41] know what? I feel a little discouraged.
[2:25:42] Look at this weed over here."
[2:25:45] What kind of nonsense is that?
[2:25:48] Well, you know what? I I grew up a wheat
[2:25:50] and I grew right next to a stingweed.
[2:25:56] Now, don't get too serious. That's what
[2:25:58] he said.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's what that's the term he used. I
[2:26:03] didn't have the bravery to use it in in
[2:26:05] guest meetings, but I thought I could
[2:26:06] use it at home.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "The wheat rejoices
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; and says hallelujah."
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the weed rejoices and
[2:26:17] says hallelujah."
[2:26:19] [Applause]
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Anyway, do you believe it?
[2:26:28] Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; The congregate together.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; They had a chance to accept it and they
[2:26:37] wouldn't do it.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; So it's condensed itself.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Darkness can never stand. And I know my
[2:26:44] redeemer liveth. Can never stand in the
[2:26:47] presence of light. It cannot do it.
[2:26:50] Light is 10 million times stronger than
[2:26:53] darkness. So light and dark cannot dwell
[2:26:56] together.
[2:26:58] Hallelujah.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; This is the end. The wheat has come back
[2:27:02] to wheat again. The wheat has come back
[2:27:05] to its grain and the shuck has pulled
[2:27:07] away from it. And the wheat must lay in
[2:27:10] the presence of the sun to be ripened.
[2:27:13] Oh God,
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; let the sun shine on me in all of your
[2:27:18] intensity. Whether I agree with it,
[2:27:21] whether it brings hardship, whether it
[2:27:22] brings a delusionment, whatever, shine
[2:27:24] on me.
[2:27:26] Bake the greenness out.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:44] John 1 and5 says in him and this is the
[2:27:48] message
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; which we have heard of him and declare
[2:27:54] unto you
[2:27:55] that God is light
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; to you French people to
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; that's the end of it
[2:28:11] there's no darkness at all.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:16] [Applause]
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Do we love it? Yes, we love it. Do we
[2:28:22] love him? Yes, we love him.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wonder if we could sing. Brother
[2:28:26] Ryan, if you could help us or Linda,
[2:28:28] whoever is playing, Shine on Me, Shine
[2:28:31] on Me.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; And tonight, friends, Brother Danny
[2:28:36] Stemon will be here.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Put the icing on the cake. Brother
[2:28:41] Danny, God bless you. We've been to
[2:28:44] Brother Danny's church and his wife,
[2:28:46] Sister Michelle, is with him. Others of
[2:28:48] his congregation. Brother Danny's mother
[2:28:51] is here.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; I'd like her to stand.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Sitting. No.
[2:29:03] I'd like if sister
[2:29:06] Sister Steam, if you could just stand
[2:29:08] for another moment, please.
[2:29:11] I just need her to stand. Look how young
[2:29:13] she looks.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; After raising people like Danny, I tell
[2:29:18] you what, and the rest of the family,
[2:29:22] I'm sure she prayed many prayers.
[2:29:25] Her and her husband, her husband,
[2:29:27] Brother John, has gone on to be with the
[2:29:28] Lord, but he pastored, they pastored in
[2:29:32] uh Sarasota, Florida for many years.
[2:29:35] This is special special meaning.
[2:29:39] Brother Danny's daddy
[2:29:43] and this woman you see standing, sister
[2:29:47] Steven, sister Diane Stemon
[2:29:50] was sitting in the house of brother Tom
[2:29:53] Browns
[2:29:55] and I was there I and my wife
[2:29:59] and her husband was not saved yet
[2:30:03] and he told me I wish you could to meet
[2:30:07] him is to love him And he says, "I drive
[2:30:10] I drive past." He knew his wife was in
[2:30:12] the house. And he said, "I just shake my
[2:30:16] fist at that house." He was so upset.
[2:30:20] You know what that is? That's like Paul.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Paul was so angry with these believers.
[2:30:26] So angry. And finally, he became a
[2:30:28] fanatic of one.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what her husband did.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Brother John. And we're so happy, Sister
[2:30:35] Dan, to have you here. God bless you.
[2:30:38] Thank you for standing.
[2:30:40] [Music]
[2:30:48] Why don't we all stand? And could we
[2:30:50] sing this? Help us out. We give him some
[2:30:52] power there, please.
[2:30:59] Oh, shine
[2:31:01] on me.
[2:31:03] Let the light
[2:31:05] of the light
[2:31:08] shine
[2:31:10] on me.
[2:31:12] Oh, shine
[2:31:14] on me.
[2:31:17] Shine
[2:31:18] on me.
[2:31:20] Let the light
[2:31:25] shine
[2:31:27] on me. Oh, shine
[2:31:31] on me.
[2:31:34] Sh.
[2:31:35] [Music]
[2:31:48] Shine on me.
[2:31:51] Shine
[2:31:53] on me.
[2:31:55] Let the light
[2:32:00] shine
[2:32:01] on me.
[2:32:04] I asked the Lord
[2:32:07] just simply
[2:32:09] not knowing how the service was going to
[2:32:10] go and I asked the Lord to help me to
[2:32:12] convey one thing to the people and I I
[2:32:15] prayed that there would be one result at
[2:32:18] least one main result and that is that
[2:32:20] all of us all of us would become more
[2:32:23] fervent
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; in everything that we do everything we
[2:32:28] do more fervent in our conversation with
[2:32:30] one another more fervent in our prayer
[2:32:33] more fervent in are singing and worship
[2:32:35] to God. Let's just be so fervent. What's
[2:32:38] wrong with being fervent? Let's just be
[2:32:40] in simple faith and so fervent to God.
[2:32:43] I'd sooner be that way than any other
[2:32:45] way. Let's just be so in intent and
[2:32:49] intense with serving God.
[2:32:52] Hallelujah.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing it once again.
[2:32:56] Shine
[2:32:58] on me.
[2:33:01] Oh, shine
[2:33:03] on me.
[2:33:05] Let the light
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:10] shine
[2:33:12] on me. Let your heart shine
[2:33:16] on me.
[2:33:18] Oh, shine
[2:33:21] on me.
[2:33:23] Let the light
[2:33:25] come
[2:33:29] on.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord our God, how great thou art.
[2:33:38] Sing the sing the chorus.
[2:33:42] and see my soul,
[2:33:46] my savior
[2:33:49] to
[2:33:53] how great.
[2:33:56] [Music]
[2:33:59] How great
[2:34:00] are
[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:05] my
[2:34:07] [Music]
[2:34:15] how great
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:21] how great
[2:34:26] this is amongst his hands. This is him
[2:34:29] who changes this mask from season to
[2:34:32] season. This is him who brought us into
[2:34:34] this transition period and he sent this
[2:34:37] sign of Messiah, sign of the
[2:34:40] resurrection for the sheep, for the
[2:34:43] elected. I hope it means something to
[2:34:46] you. I have been sent a sign by my
[2:34:50] father.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Is it yours? My sign? I've been sent a
[2:34:55] sign by my father. This a resurrection
[2:34:59] time.
[2:35:00] [Music]
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet said a sign point someplace.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; It's just pointing.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; We've been in the transition time.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Don't lose it in the transition time.
[2:35:17] Don't lose sight of it. God will bring
[2:35:20] you around to it. And I pray he will use
[2:35:22] this service. use these words and even
[2:35:25] if there's one phrase or one quote that
[2:35:28] hangs in your heart,
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; oh Lord my God,
[2:35:35] how great thou art,
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; then sings myior
[2:35:48] to thee.
[2:35:52] Heat. Heat.
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:36:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:36:13] [Music]
[2:36:15] How great are
[2:36:18] [Music]
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to ever lose sight of
[2:36:29] this. Something just came to my mind
[2:36:31] while I was singing that.
[2:36:33] [Music]
[2:36:35] I said a word while we were speaking.
[2:36:38] said, "Sometimes darkness can creep in
[2:36:40] through opportunity.
[2:36:42] Opportunities are wonderful and we need
[2:36:44] opportunities."
[2:36:46] But the Bible says this of Judas.
[2:36:50] And let me, you know, emphasize to you
[2:36:53] that spirit is not dead.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; I today have spoke this message in the
[2:37:00] name of Jesus Christ. I come against
[2:37:02] that power of darkness.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; That betrayal spirit. I come against it.
[2:37:07] Amen.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; And the Bible and the Bible says this
[2:37:11] that he went to the Caiaphas. He went to
[2:37:15] the chief priest's palace and he
[2:37:18] consulted and talked with some people.
[2:37:22] And then the Bible says from that time,
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; yes sir,
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; he sought opportunity
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; to betray him. Can you imagine what he
[2:37:32] must have been like
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; when he was with them at the last supper
[2:37:36] and in his heart he's actually seeking
[2:37:38] opportunity
[2:37:40] and opportunity then the opportunity
[2:37:42] came and everything worked out. Tell you
[2:37:45] what, all opportunities are not
[2:37:47] necessarily of God. We want to examine
[2:37:49] opportunities in this time of mixtury.
[2:37:52] We want to examine our future in this
[2:37:54] time of mixtury.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; We want to examine all of these things
[2:37:57] in this opportunity of mixtury. Amen.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; And I don't feel him being, you know,
[2:38:06] easy or passive
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; with these spirits of the world. Kick
[2:38:10] them out.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with them.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; Reject them
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; completely and fully say, "I'm a I'm a
[2:38:18] son and daughter of God."
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; uh we've been long this moment and this
[2:38:26] morning and the people have been so kind
[2:38:29] and attentive. I pray that you'll bless
[2:38:32] those, Father, that perhaps some have
[2:38:34] appointments or whatever more and
[2:38:36] they've driven long distances. I pray
[2:38:38] that you will bless them, oh God, and be
[2:38:41] with them. I ask your blessings upon
[2:38:43] this congregation. I pray your blessing
[2:38:45] upon every man and woman that's sat in
[2:38:47] the audience and has listened, those
[2:38:50] that have been streaming, Father, in the
[2:38:53] name of Jesus Christ, may your spirit
[2:38:55] reach out to them. And may each person
[2:38:58] receive their portion, oh God. We're
[2:39:00] here, oh Father, not to just hear
[2:39:02] sermons. That's not the point. We're
[2:39:05] here, oh God, that we might be
[2:39:06] introduced to truth that the light may
[2:39:09] shine even more intensely upon us. Oh
[2:39:13] God, I pray, Father, you will just deal
[2:39:16] with each one of us in your own sweet
[2:39:19] and wonderful way. And we'll thank you.
[2:39:21] I pray you'll dismiss now the people
[2:39:24] in Jesus name with your blessings. And
[2:39:28] may they return tonight.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; Oh God, hear our brother Danny Stemon.
[2:39:32] The only service he'll be able to preach
[2:39:34] at this time in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you each one. You're dismissed
[2:39:40] in Jesus name. We send you with God's
[2:39:42] blessings.
[2:39:46] [Music]
[2:39:48] God bless you.
[2:39:53] [Music]
[2:40:02] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:08] [Music]
[2:41:02] very
[2:41:11] easy.
[2:41:20] [Music]
[2:41:23] Just remember
[2:41:26] [Music]
[2:42:04] Here
[2:42:09] [Music]
