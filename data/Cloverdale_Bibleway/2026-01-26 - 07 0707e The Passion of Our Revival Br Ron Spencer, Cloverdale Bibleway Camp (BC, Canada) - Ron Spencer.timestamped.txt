[4:22] I'm already out the door.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove
[4:29] I'm ready to move.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; I' got
[4:34] to prove I'm ready to move.
[4:38] Well, I've got Holy Ghost here to prove

[4:45] to move.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Ready to move.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:05] Uh, that sounded like about 10% of you.
[5:08] Are you ready to move?
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we got some company.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Well, here we are Saturday evening and
[5:19] uh we have one more service after
[5:21] tonight.
[5:23] It's been a grand time.
[5:26] We have enjoyed so much the fellowship,
[5:29] more than the fellowship, the
[5:30] instruction, the preaching of the word.
[5:34] Wasn't last night wonderful?
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell you what, uh, put us in
[5:39] heavenly places.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; This evening, our brother Ron Spencer is
[5:43] going to be coming after a little bit,
[5:44] but we're going to be taking up an
[5:46] offering this evening. And the offering
[5:48] this evening is uh going to be somewhat
[5:51] different. I'm going to ask if the
[5:54] deacons could uh and the ushers if they
[5:57] could please make their way to the
[5:58] front. We want to have a word of prayer
[6:02] about the offering. There will be no
[6:04] singing during the offering. I want you
[6:07] to see uh what is taking place in Congo.
[6:12] Our brother Dio is directing
[6:16] uh Shakina Publications.
[6:18] Shakina Publications is doing I think
[6:21] the by far the greatest work for the
[6:24] Frenchspeaking people in the world. and
[6:28] they are working with such efficiency.
[6:31] How it's happening, I cannot I cannot
[6:34] tell you. I've been there several times,
[6:37] but I can't tell you how it happens. How
[6:39] all this equipment and how they're able
[6:42] to support it and how they're able to
[6:44] continue. I know that some of the people
[6:47] have worked for very, very little pay.
[6:50] and these people who you see operating
[6:52] on the equipment uh because we're going
[6:55] to be showing you the operation and
[6:58] instead of music we're going to be
[7:00] having just the ambient sounds. Uh I
[7:03] want you to see the equipment. I want
[7:05] you to see what's happening and so you
[7:08] can look at that and ask God, what would
[7:12] you have me to give towards this work?
[7:15] because the entire offering tonight is
[7:18] going to go to sending the message to
[7:21] the French-speaking peoples and they
[7:23] they also print for uh also some in
[7:27] English and I better not say because
[7:29] there some of the tribal languages and I
[7:31] don't know them all but this is what is
[7:34] happening there and I believe it's u a
[7:38] an an incredible work and no matter what
[7:41] we give tonight I'm quite confident
[7:45] that you will not regret what you give.
[7:49] Uh and if you want to if you're not
[7:51] fully prepared tonight and say, "Well, I
[7:53] once you see this, I would like to give
[7:56] a check. I would like to give a
[7:57] substantial gift." All you have to do is
[8:01] you can uh put it tomorrow in an
[8:05] envelope and we will be having envelopes
[8:07] here tomorrow morning. Tithe and
[8:09] offering envelopes. I'm going to ask
[8:11] them to bring them and have them
[8:13] available. Uh then you can if you just
[8:15] put Congo
[8:17] that's all you have to put on the
[8:19] envelope Congo and we will see that it
[8:22] goes directly to that work 100% of it
[8:26] will go there. So if the deacons I
[8:29] wonder if uh could they come forward
[8:32] please?
[8:44] And we're going to have a word of
[8:45] prayer.
[8:59] Thank you.
[9:03] Why don't we all stand?
[9:11] Heavenly Father,
[9:13] we are your children.
[9:16] You have given us a birth, a new birth,
[9:19] a spiritual birth, a new birth. We are
[9:23] born again. And there are others, many
[9:27] others in different lands, different
[9:30] countries that have received the birth
[9:35] by the spirit and by the word. Lord
[9:38] Jesus, tonight as we contemplate this
[9:41] offering, as we ponder what you have
[9:45] done, why you have chosen this country,
[9:48] this nation of Congo, it's not our
[9:51] thought. It's not our plan but it was
[9:53] your plan. What you have done there we
[9:56] say it is it is something that you have
[9:59] achieved. It is something that has been
[10:02] done supernaturally. It it it functions
[10:05] day by day out of supernatural. It's
[10:08] like bread from heaven as it were that
[10:10] has sustained these people. And I pray
[10:13] that you will bless the people that
[10:14] labor. Oh God, bless the people who
[10:17] sacrifice in that land. Bless the people
[10:20] tonight as they give in this offering.
[10:22] And I pray that you will endure our
[10:24] brother Deoka with wisdom, oh God, that
[10:27] he might know just exactly how to
[10:29] conduct your affairs, Lord. I pray
[10:32] you'll give him Holy Ghost wisdom,
[10:34] Father, not the wisdom of a man, oh God.
[10:37] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[10:39] Christ that you will receive our
[10:41] thanksgiving tonight that we can be a
[10:44] part of this great program. In the name
[10:47] of Jesus, we ask it. bless the offering
[10:49] and the giving and the givers I pray.
[10:52] Amen.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[11:13] But I walked upon the
[11:19] just
[11:22] I would do anything.
[11:26] There's no price I would not
[11:33] just
[11:36] give everything.
[11:39] I would give my life
[11:43] away.
[11:46] Yeah.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; We are now in the printing shop. We have
[12:04] many kinds of machines from
[12:08] to many.
[12:12] Our machines we have some for printing,
[12:15] other for
[12:17] bounding.
[12:20] With all these machines, Shaka missions
[12:24] is now able to print about 1,500,000
[12:30] books a month.

[15:40] people that we're associated with.
[15:43] Here's people who are part who worship
[15:46] like we do. We are not just some single
[15:49] little offshoot all by ourselves. We are
[15:52] connected to a group of people and he
[15:54] can tell them we're connected to the
[15:56] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Brother
[15:59] Dioa, here's the man that's responsible.
[16:03] Amen. God bless you.
[16:06] You might just want to say a word of
[16:08] greeting or thanksgiving to the people.
[16:17] God bless you.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting my uh translator, my
[16:24] interpreter.
[16:26] Waiting for the interpreter.
[16:41] I preach in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:43] Christ.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Id like to thank Pastor Ed for this
[16:52] opportunity I have to greet you.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; And especially for the burden he has in
[17:02] his heart to support the missionary
[17:04] work.
[17:08] when I saw what he did yesterday
[17:15] and what he's doing in the rest of the
[17:16] world to support the work of God.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; May God richly bless him.
[17:25] May he bless you also
[17:28] for everything that you're doing
[17:32] to support us in this work.
[17:36] It's true that it's a hard work.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; It's truly difficult
[17:44] as it is in Africa.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; It is done with much difficulty.
[17:52] That is why we are soliciting your
[17:54] prayers.
[17:57] Especially your prayers will be of great
[17:59] support to us.
[18:01] May God bless you much
[18:05] even if there's a lot of opposition
[18:10] &gt;&gt; but as we know this is the word of God
[18:14] the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:17] we are going to go forward
[18:21] and the Lord will support and sustain
[18:23] his work
[18:25] may God bless you
[18:27] &gt;&gt; and thank you very much thank you very
[18:37] I don't know what the message means to
[18:39] you, but I can tell you I have seen the
[18:42] messages copied by hand on brown paper
[18:46] bags. I've seen the messages uh written
[18:50] out uh handed out one page at a time and
[18:53] then when the people meet for service
[18:55] then they exchange the pages and they
[18:58] have the next one to read. I've seen
[19:00] that. I've seen them all entire messages
[19:04] written by hand so that the people
[19:06] because there was only one printed copy
[19:08] so they had others written out by hand
[19:11] and uh uh brother Hildebrand could tell
[19:14] you many many experiences. I talked to
[19:17] another person today during the
[19:19] minister's uh brunch and they said as
[19:22] soon as we would get a message book we
[19:24] would take it apart, take the staples
[19:27] out and photocopy page by page so we
[19:30] could then get g have a few other
[19:33] copies. You know friends, this has been
[19:36] uh this this message has not come easy
[19:40] and so we who have it should appreciate
[19:42] it and people who have gone to such
[19:45] extremities to get it sometimes walked
[19:48] miles to have it then you know that they
[19:51] really appreciate it. They don't have it
[19:53] sitting like an ornament on their shelf
[19:55] that it is something that means life to
[19:58] them. And and I I trust that when you
[20:01] leave this place tonight, you'll know
[20:03] that your gift has put the book in the
[20:07] hands of somebody who's going to deeply
[20:10] appreciate it because it's not in some
[20:13] of these countries, it's very difficult
[20:15] to get it distributed. And there's
[20:16] people out there to have it. And we just
[20:20] got to find ways to get it to them. And
[20:22] God will. He'll get it to them. But we
[20:25] have our part, too. Amen. Brother
[20:27] Anatoli, please come.
[20:34] This is brother Anatoli say from
[20:38] Usbekistan.

[23:29] not only inbakistan but in the whole of
[23:31] central Asia.
[23:34] God has opened the message to us
[23:40] and we're very thankful to the Lord that
[23:42] he is doing his work among us
[23:46] and God is adding the saved to the
[23:48] church.

[23:59] would like to tell you
[24:02] we don't have any persecution against
[24:03] Christians.
[24:07] That is why all the religions in that
[24:09] country can can just go freely.

[41:42] that I am the Lord.
[41:49] Just be still
[41:51] and know
[41:54] that I am
[41:57] the Lord.
[42:14] Brother Ken has experienced what he's
[42:15] singing about this young man.
[42:21] when he was in the world, he sang.
[42:25] He knew what it was to sing, be part of
[42:28] a group, and then
[42:32] his life and
[42:35] the way that he had experienced life.
[42:38] Then he came in contact with Jesus
[42:41] Christ, came in contact with the
[42:43] message, and he laid aside
[42:47] everything. He said he didn't want to
[42:48] sing. I don't want to. He needed he felt
[42:52] I just want to be washed by the word. I
[42:55] just want to hear the word. I just want
[42:58] the wa the water of the word to wash me.
[43:01] They don't want any part of the world
[43:04] just to be able to come in purity. And
[43:07] this is maybe the third time he sang.
[43:10] And you know when that was a part of
[43:11] your life, it means something just to
[43:13] lay it down. and you have certain
[43:16] relationships, you just lay it down and
[43:18] say, "This is a whole new life." Amen.
[43:22] Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; How are you doing, folks?
[43:28] &gt;&gt; You feel like praising the Lord?
[43:31] Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[43:33] Isn't he worthy?
[43:36] Praise to God. Hallelujah. We're going
[43:38] to have our speaker this evening, our
[43:42] brother Ron uh Spencer to come. And uh
[43:47] brother Ron has blessed us. God has
[43:50] blessed us through brother Ron's
[43:52] ministry. And we are happy for a
[43:54] dedicated life.
[43:58] Happy for
[44:00] very very thrilled to see that God
[44:02] brought and wrought a great deliverance
[44:04] in his life. Amen. And I'd like to have
[44:08] you stand. We want to sing. We place you
[44:13] in the highest place.
[44:16] Like this congregation to lift it up and
[44:19] do what the prophet of God says. Get in
[44:21] the spirit of the meeting.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; If you're not in it yet, let's just do
[44:25] it. Amen. Just get in the spirit of the
[44:28] meeting. Amen.
[44:32] We place you
[44:35] in the highest
[44:41] for you.
[44:45] A great high.
[44:50] Give praise to you.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; High above all else.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; We worship
[45:16] your feet.
[45:24] We place you
[45:28] Lord in the highest
[45:33] you
[45:35] only
[45:41] praise you.
[45:50] else
[45:58] and we
[46:02] will
[46:11] have you join me in a love song to him.
[46:13] I love him. I love him because he first
[46:15] loved me. You can sing that in every
[46:17] language. Sing it in your language.
[46:19] Whatever language you sing, just sing it
[46:21] in your mother tongue. I
[46:26] love him.
[46:30] I
[46:33] love
[46:40] to hear.
[46:46] me.
[47:20] Sing it one more time to
[47:33] love him
[47:37] Because
[48:18] Hallelujah.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:23] We stand here tonight to recognize the
[48:25] transforming power
[48:27] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; If you have a need in this building
[48:32] tonight, won't you just raise your hands
[48:34] to him tonight?
[48:36] We didn't come to see the personality of
[48:39] men, but we come to meet him
[48:42] &gt;&gt; and to have a conference with Jesus
[48:45] Christ.
[48:47] Let's ask him to come to our respective
[48:49] places where we're sitting at tonight.
[48:52] Say, "Father, my door is open.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You know what I need, Lord Jesus, we bow
[49:00] our heads to the dust of the earth which
[49:03] we came.
[49:08] It is only because you place something
[49:10] on the inside of us
[49:13] &gt;&gt; which is the eternal part of us.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And dear God, it's a deep calling to the
[49:20] deep tonight.
[49:22] Lord, we are needful for you to come.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; We're needful for you to speak tonight.
[49:29] We're needful for you to walk these
[49:31] aisles, Father. We're needful for you to
[49:34] come to our our pew where we're sitting
[49:36] at.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you'd drive every
[49:40] enemy that has bound us tonight. We pray
[49:45] that you would break every chain and
[49:47] every fed.
[49:49] We pray that we can break through the
[49:51] boundaries, Father, tonight.
[49:54] That Lord, that we could have a
[49:56] conference with you.
[49:59] This meeting has the potential to be the
[50:01] greatest meeting that there has ever
[50:03] been on the face of the earth.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; We're one day closer to the coming of
[50:07] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:10] And we are the bride that you have been
[50:13] looking for,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; that you predestinated before the
[50:16] foundation of the world. Lord, not only
[50:19] visible but invisible before us tonight.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, through the internet, Lord, we ask
[50:25] you to speak to hearts.
[50:28] Lord, you know our needs.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the greatest gift that any of
[50:33] us could have, whether with the speaker
[50:35] or the hearer, is to get our own ideas
[50:38] out of the way. Get our own
[50:40] personalities out of the way tonight and
[50:43] ask you to manifest yourself
[50:45] &gt;&gt; in this building. We pray
[50:48] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Let's just sing
[50:50] another course of that tonight. I
[50:56] love him.
[51:00] I
[51:04] love him
[51:08] because
[51:26] Just like,
[51:51] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad that you can love him.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me tonight
[51:56] to Revelations chapter 19,
[52:02] I feel extremely humbled to stand before
[52:04] you tonight with trembling knees
[52:09] and I am certainly honored that brother
[52:12] Ed would ask me to to be a part of this
[52:14] meeting.
[52:17] I stand before the greatest men that God
[52:20] had predestinated before the foundation
[52:22] of the world to preach the gospel.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And he saved them for the last.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Many preachers were probably in his mind
[52:36] throughout the eternities
[52:38] through the dawn of time. And he said,
[52:40] "I think I'll save a certain group of
[52:42] men
[52:44] &gt;&gt; with a certain characteristic about
[52:46] them."
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And they stand before us tonight. And
[52:50] maybe you don't have the right kind of
[52:52] respect for these men, but I feel
[52:54] extremely humbled to stand before them
[52:57] tonight to preach not only a message,
[53:01] but something that is extremely dear to
[53:04] my heart. Amen. Brother Tim and I had
[53:07] not talked.
[53:09] We're personal friends, but we had not
[53:11] talked about what we're preaching this
[53:12] week. But he finished last night with
[53:15] Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. It
[53:19] just so happens to be the spot to where
[53:21] I would like to start at tonight.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and verse six. And I
[53:30] heard as it was a voice of a great
[53:32] multitude, as a voice of many waters,
[53:36] and as a voice of a mighty thunderings,
[53:38] saying, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God
[53:42] omnipotent reignth."
[53:44] Let us be glad and rejoice, and give
[53:46] honor to him, for the marriage of the
[53:48] Lamb is come, and his wife hath made
[53:52] herself ready.
[53:54] And to her was granted that she should
[53:56] be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
[53:58] white. For the fine linen is the
[54:00] righteousness of the of the saints. And
[54:03] he saith unto me, write, blessed are
[54:06] they which are called unto the marriage
[54:09] supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me,
[54:13] these are the true sayings of God. You
[54:17] may be seated.
[54:26] I would like to, if I could title this
[54:28] tonight, I would like to take a thought
[54:32] on the passion of our revival.
[54:37] I remember and as I was thinking earlier
[54:39] today and this week, I remember as a
[54:42] young man sitting in a congregation just
[54:45] newly saved like this young man that was
[54:48] just sung the song here, just newly
[54:51] saved with my new wife, Sister Connie,
[54:54] which is with us tonight. And I was
[54:56] sitting and brother Biscll, it was the
[54:58] first time that I would hear him speak.
[55:00] I'd heard him speak in 1978 at brother
[55:03] Falters and he had preached he took a
[55:06] title on on his experiences and and it
[55:10] always hung with me
[55:12] since that time. And then the next time
[55:15] that I would hear him speak, he he came
[55:17] to a pull pit much like this before a
[55:19] crowd of people like this and not
[55:21] knowing that I was sitting in the
[55:23] congregation, not even knowing that I
[55:26] felt something in my heart. And as as I
[55:30] was sitting and listening, I felt like I
[55:32] was just just transformed sitting in my
[55:35] pew as I heard him preach a sermon
[55:37] called Let Us Run. And as he begin to
[55:41] preach, he he talked about great men of
[55:43] the ages and what their job and their
[55:46] responsibility was and how the great
[55:48] Lord Jesus Christ came and lived in
[55:50] their lives and what a great revival was
[55:53] stirred in their lives. And in the he be
[55:56] to turn to where it was our turn to run.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Taking the scriptures of Hebrews chapter
[56:04] 11 and reading verse 31 down through the
[56:07] end and coming to chapter 12. And and
[56:10] I'm not going to rehearse that whole
[56:11] sermon for you tonight. But when he
[56:14] turned and he said, "Let us lay aside
[56:15] every weight and the sin which would so
[56:18] easily beset us. Let us run this race
[56:22] with patience.
[56:24] looking unto the author and the finisher
[56:26] of our faith.
[56:29] There was something immediately that was
[56:31] anchored in in my heart because I had
[56:34] not wanted just what my mother and
[56:37] father had. I didn't want just exactly
[56:40] what other people had because if I had
[56:42] what they had, I would have a secondhand
[56:44] experience. But I wanted something new
[56:47] for me. I wanted the same Lord Jesus
[56:50] Christ to come and live inside of my
[56:53] heart
[56:56] &gt;&gt; because I would quickly recognize I
[56:58] could tell the stories of brother
[56:59] Brandham but that was brother Brandham's
[57:02] stories I could tell the stories of
[57:04] maybe brother Bisll but that's brother
[57:07] Biscll's stories tell the stories of
[57:09] brother Tim Puit but that's brother Tim
[57:11] storuit stories but I needed to know
[57:14] that same Lord Jesus Christ and enter
[57:18] into the inner veil for myself.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I had to recognize the revival of my day
[57:24] &gt;&gt; and what this message personally meant
[57:28] to me.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; If you can imagine of all the writers of
[57:34] the scriptures, the all of them had the
[57:37] same author. All of them were under the
[57:40] direction of the composer. All of them
[57:42] feeling the same spirit of a
[57:44] supernatural God. For they were not
[57:47] writing down the mind of a man, but they
[57:50] were writing down the mind of Almighty
[57:52] God. And if we can just imagine, many
[57:55] people have picked up these Bibles and
[57:58] begin to read. And many of them were
[58:00] great intellectual giants that would try
[58:03] to figure out the scriptures and they
[58:06] would go to the same scriptures like you
[58:08] and I go to Revelations 19 and6. But in
[58:12] no way could they understand what was
[58:15] delivered to us even last night. That
[58:18] how that our deed has been cleared. Our
[58:21] title has been cleared by the blood of
[58:24] the redemption.
[58:25] No longer is it justification
[58:29] that Luther would nail 95 thesis upon a
[58:32] door and shake the world with. When he
[58:35] would say the just shall live by faith
[58:38] that we don't need your rosary beads. We
[58:40] don't need your penance of prayer. We
[58:43] don't need to go through a priest.
[58:44] There's one mediator between God and
[58:47] man, and that is the man Christ Jesus.
[58:49] And he shook the world with a revival.
[58:54] But with the illumination of the light
[58:56] of this day, it's more than just the
[58:59] word justification. But a man like stood
[59:01] and sung or a man like myself that was a
[59:04] drag addict that was addicted to many
[59:07] things of this world could stand here
[59:09] tonight with the revelation of the word
[59:12] and say it was as though I never did it
[59:15] in the first place.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And I can stand and say it because it's
[59:23] not just written down on paper. It's not
[59:26] just brother Brandham's voice. But I
[59:28] most believe it was the redeemer, the
[59:30] blood of Jesus Christ that came and
[59:33] cleansed my life.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I wish I could preach like these guys,
[59:40] but I tell you, for the life of me, I
[59:42] can't.
[59:48] Many pick up the scriptures of 1
[59:50] Thessalonians chapter 4 and it says,
[59:52] "But I would not have you to be
[59:54] ignorant, brethren, concerning them
[59:56] which are asleep. that you sorrow not
[59:58] even as others which have no hope. For
[1:00:01] if we believe that Jesus died and rose
[1:00:03] again, even so them also which sleep in
[1:00:07] Jesus will God bring with him. For this
[1:00:09] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:00:12] that we which are alive and remain. Many
[1:00:17] generations has stood there and read
[1:00:19] that scripture believing they were that
[1:00:21] group. But because of the identification
[1:00:25] and the characteristics of this age, we
[1:00:28] can stand here tonight and proclaim.
[1:00:35] We can stand here tonight and proclaim
[1:00:38] that we are a part of that group that
[1:00:41] are alive and remain and we are watching
[1:00:45] for the coming, the literal coming of
[1:00:47] our Lord Jesus Christ and go to meet him
[1:00:51] in the air.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And we say this to you by the word of
[1:00:55] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:00:57] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:00:59] not prevent them which are asleep. For
[1:01:01] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:01:03] heaven with a shout. And we believe he
[1:01:05] has, don't we? And the voice of the
[1:01:07] archangel, and the trumpet of God, and
[1:01:10] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:01:12] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:01:15] be caught up together to meet them when
[1:01:17] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,
[1:01:19] and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:01:22] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:01:24] words.
[1:01:26] But he continues, "But," which is a
[1:01:28] conjunction between the past participle
[1:01:30] and the future. And he says, "But of the
[1:01:32] times and the season, brethren, you have
[1:01:34] no need that I write unto you. For
[1:01:36] yourselves know perfectly," it becomes a
[1:01:39] personal revelation. You know perfectly
[1:01:42] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:01:44] thief in the night. And when they shall
[1:01:46] say peace and safety,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:01:51] as travail upon a woman with a child,
[1:01:53] and they shall not escape. But ye,
[1:01:56] brethren, are not in darkness,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; that that day should overtake you as a
[1:02:01] thief. Ye are all the children of light,
[1:02:05] and the children of the day. We are not
[1:02:08] of the night nor of the darkness.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; I stand here tonight and I read that
[1:02:16] scripture to you.
[1:02:20] Many times did rabbis and priests stand
[1:02:24] and read Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6.
[1:02:31] Many times did they stand and read,
[1:02:33] "Behold, a virgin shall conceive."
[1:02:36] But One day a rabbi stood
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; and he read that scripture
[1:02:44] and it was quickened and inspired to a
[1:02:47] little lady sitting in the congregation
[1:02:50] and something became incredibly real to
[1:02:53] her. It was more than just another
[1:02:55] sermon. It was more than just another
[1:02:58] thought given by a by a priest. But this
[1:03:01] day, something happened on the inside of
[1:03:04] her heart.
[1:03:08] I believe that there's men of God on the
[1:03:10] scene as they begin to read these
[1:03:12] scriptures talking about a rapture.
[1:03:15] You're not children of the night.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And we sit amongst a group of people
[1:03:20] that are not going to be overtaken by
[1:03:23] the cares of this world.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, what is a
[1:03:29] revival?"
[1:03:31] So many people have misconception of
[1:03:33] what a revival is. A lot of times we
[1:03:35] think of revival as all emotion.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was standing beside Lake
[1:03:42] Michigan and he said, he says, "I
[1:03:46] thought, what does a city jump like that
[1:03:48] for?
[1:03:49] Where there's a great mighty rushing
[1:03:51] wind comes down and causes a revival.
[1:03:54] That same amount of water, it has the
[1:03:57] same amount of water, but it's got a
[1:03:59] revival. What does it do? It floats all
[1:04:03] the trash up to the floor.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; He says we need a scouring out once in a
[1:04:08] while. God gives us a revival, a
[1:04:11] sweeping mighty wind, and he rushes down
[1:04:13] through the church like that and floats
[1:04:15] all the trash.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; As we heard last night, it floats all
[1:04:20] the creeds and the dogmas and all the
[1:04:24] isms out of our lives. And we're washed
[1:04:27] by the washing of the word.
[1:04:32] God purifies us by the Holy Spirit. Even
[1:04:36] while the word is going forth, the
[1:04:38] purifying of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:41] of the Holy Spirit comes through the
[1:04:43] congregation and begins to reach down in
[1:04:45] our souls.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] We could think of revivals and measure
[1:04:54] revivals and we could look at maybe
[1:04:58] a revival like when the children of
[1:05:00] Israel
[1:05:03] had gone across the land and they had
[1:05:06] went with Joshua
[1:05:08] and the scripture says that God spoke to
[1:05:11] him. It says, "Take sharp knives
[1:05:16] and circumcise again the children
[1:05:20] that have been born among you."
[1:05:24] Maybe we could liken today that you say,
[1:05:27] "Well, brother Ron, we have no need for
[1:05:29] a fresh revival. We've had it all of
[1:05:31] these years." But there's many times
[1:05:33] children that grows up among us
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; and they conform to the message.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Many people come to church and conform
[1:05:44] to the church.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Many people conform to their favorite
[1:05:48] preacher, but we're not to come together
[1:05:51] to catch the church's spirit. We're not
[1:05:55] to come together to catch the pastor
[1:05:57] spirit.
[1:05:59] We're not even wanting the spirit of the
[1:06:01] prophet of the Lord. We're here to catch
[1:06:04] the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:11] These young men had grew up in the
[1:06:13] message. They had seen the mighty
[1:06:15] prophet of God. They had heard of all
[1:06:17] the the great feasts of God through
[1:06:20] Moses.
[1:06:22] They had seen the splits of the
[1:06:24] churches. They had seen the problems
[1:06:27] that had went on. They had heard about
[1:06:29] the mana in the wilderness.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet of the Lord was gone off the
[1:06:36] scene now. But here stood Joshua. The
[1:06:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost for our day
[1:06:42] was standing there leading them.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And the challenge was made. Circumcise
[1:06:50] again.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Circumcise again. I say this to you. If
[1:06:56] you don't have a a baptism of the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost tonight, listen, I pray to God
[1:07:01] before this meeting is over with.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a supernatural touch
[1:07:10] of God, Brother Ron, how do I know if
[1:07:13] I've got it? Does your life produce the
[1:07:16] works of Jesus Christ?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; There's one way to measure. Do you have
[1:07:21] the life? I'm talking about more than
[1:07:24] knowing the quotes, more than having the
[1:07:26] pictures, more than having the dress
[1:07:28] code, more than having the hair do just
[1:07:30] right, more than having just the right
[1:07:33] things to say at the right time, but
[1:07:35] does that pulsation of that bubbling
[1:07:38] stream down on the inside of you, does
[1:07:41] it pulsate out of you?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Do you have to make yourself live it? Do
[1:07:47] you have to make yourself go to church?
[1:07:49] Do you have to make yourself pray?
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. I say this to you tonight.
[1:07:57] You can have the very life of God.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; There can be such a hunger in your heart
[1:08:02] that you can't get enough of it.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I don't serve the Lord just because of
[1:08:12] somebody else. I don't serve him because
[1:08:15] of my wife. I don't serve him because of
[1:08:17] my father. I don't serve him because of
[1:08:19] my friends. I serve him because there's
[1:08:23] something on the inside of me. A deep
[1:08:26] calling to the dead.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, Brother Ron, nobody can
[1:08:34] live that close to the Lord and have
[1:08:36] that excitement every day." I've got
[1:08:38] news for you. Once you enter into that
[1:08:40] inner veil,
[1:08:44] you enter. Listen, in the Old Testament,
[1:08:46] they could not go into that inner veil.
[1:08:49] It was death for them to go in there.
[1:08:51] But listen, as a believer tonight, as
[1:08:53] sons and daughters tonight, we it's
[1:08:56] death if we don't enter inside of there.
[1:08:59] We can live in constant fellowship.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Constant fellowship with our
[1:09:07] Lord Jesus Christ, with our bridegroom.
[1:09:16] For those that don't like excitable
[1:09:18] preachers,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; bad night.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Just a word for those that might have a
[1:09:35] little criticism for excitement.
[1:09:39] There's there's some quotes that I can
[1:09:40] give you right now that stillborn
[1:09:43] children, they're dead.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And anything without emotion, it's dead.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Random must had quite a bit of
[1:09:58] emotion
[1:09:59] when he was dangling his feet off of off
[1:10:02] of the pull pit.
[1:10:16] Brother Ram standing and recognizing
[1:10:17] your day and its message and he says
[1:10:19] everywhere there's no revival. Now think
[1:10:21] just for a moment in that day everybody
[1:10:23] thought they were having revival.
[1:10:26] He says everywhere there's no revival
[1:10:28] everybody's complaining ministers
[1:10:30] crying. I was reading one of the
[1:10:31] outstanding papers and here comes to the
[1:10:33] church a very fine paper. I know the
[1:10:35] editor. I know the people. They're godly
[1:10:37] people.
[1:10:39] They're very fine. Brother and sister
[1:10:41] Moore of the Hurl of His coming. One of
[1:10:43] the finest papers on the field. The hurl
[1:10:46] of his coming. But they hardly will
[1:10:47] print anything unless it's about fast
[1:10:49] and pray. Fast and pray. Sound a
[1:10:52] trumpet. He says, "How many reads it?"
[1:10:54] You know, you see it all the time. Fast
[1:10:56] and pray. Fast and pray. That's all you
[1:10:58] hear. Fast and pray. We're going to have
[1:10:59] a great breaking of the day. There's a
[1:11:01] great thing that's going to happen. All
[1:11:03] of you pray. Pray, pray. We're not too
[1:11:06] late yet. Why do they do that?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Why do they do that? They want a great
[1:11:12] awakening. They're crying, believing
[1:11:15] that there will be an awakening. They're
[1:11:17] good people.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Many of your family members that's still
[1:11:21] wrapped in denominationalism.
[1:11:23] They're good people.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Why is it? What? What have
[1:11:28] they done? They have not recognized
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; the awakening of the bride.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; See, by feeling the Christ, being a
[1:11:40] Christian, they feel the pull of the
[1:11:43] hour,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; but they haven't recognized what has
[1:11:48] been done. That's what's making them
[1:11:50] feel that way. They know something is
[1:11:52] supposed to happen, but they're looking
[1:11:53] for it way off in the future. I'm afraid
[1:11:56] too many people still looking for it way
[1:11:58] off in the future. This has got to
[1:12:00] happen and this has got to happen and
[1:12:02] this has got to happen when it's
[1:12:04] happening right now.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, give me an illustration.
[1:12:13] Sure will. John 14:11 says, "Let not
[1:12:16] your heart be troubled. You believe in
[1:12:18] God, believe also in me. In my father's
[1:12:21] house are many mansions. If it were not
[1:12:23] so, I would have told you. I go to
[1:12:25] prepare a place for you. And I and if I
[1:12:28] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[1:12:30] come again and receive you unto myself,
[1:12:32] that where I am, there you may be also.
[1:12:35] And he says, "And whether I go, you
[1:12:36] know, and the way you know." And Thomas
[1:12:38] saith unto him, Lord, we know not
[1:12:40] whether thou goest. And how can we know
[1:12:42] the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am
[1:12:46] the way.
[1:12:51] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:12:54] And no man cometh unto the Father but by
[1:12:56] me. And if ye had known me,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid too too many people know,
[1:13:09] brother Brandham, but they don't know
[1:13:11] the voice behind the voice.
[1:13:16] They don't know who this MelzDC really
[1:13:18] was.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Because remember in Exodus chapter 3,
[1:13:26] God spoke and said, "I am come down."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; And once again in this evening hour,
[1:13:32] that same Christ has come down.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And listen, he didn't leave.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't leave. He is here
[1:13:48] to anoint his work.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Where is he at? He's not just laying on
[1:13:54] paper, but he's anointing those
[1:13:56] predestinated saints.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; The people of the open book, the
[1:14:02] redeemed ones that stand and say, "I
[1:14:05] have recognized
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; that my name is written in the book.
[1:14:18] Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the
[1:14:20] Father, and it sufficeth us. And Jesus
[1:14:22] said unto him, Have I been so long time
[1:14:24] with you, and yet you have not known me?
[1:14:26] Phillip, he that hath seen me hath seen
[1:14:29] the Father, and how sayest thou then,
[1:14:32] show us the Father? Believest thou not
[1:14:34] that I am in the Father, and the Father
[1:14:36] in me? And the words that I speak unto
[1:14:38] you, I speak not of myself, but the
[1:14:41] Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[1:14:43] works. Believe me that I am in the
[1:14:46] Father and the Father in me, or else
[1:14:49] believe me for the very work's sake.
[1:14:55] Matthew chapter 16. Jesus was having a
[1:14:57] little committee meeting with his with
[1:14:59] his boys and he said, "And when Jesus
[1:15:01] came to the coast of Cesaria Philippi,
[1:15:03] and he asked his disciples, saying, whom
[1:15:05] do men say that I, the son of man, am?"
[1:15:10] Because remember, a revival can't take
[1:15:12] personally to you until you personally
[1:15:15] recognize it for yourself.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You can't do it for your children. Your
[1:15:20] children have to have their own personal
[1:15:22] revelation.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I've been in church 30
[1:15:25] years. I believe the message 30 years.
[1:15:29] Listen, I want to thank God for that.
[1:15:31] But until that message has come clear to
[1:15:33] you,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and that same Christ, it's living in
[1:15:39] your life.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's somebody else's revival and not
[1:15:43] yours.
[1:15:47] All
[1:15:51] right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Whom the men say that I the son of man
[1:15:57] am?
[1:15:59] And they said some say thou art John the
[1:16:02] Baptist.
[1:16:04] Because there was
[1:16:08] stories going around about a return
[1:16:10] ministry.
[1:16:17] Some said Elias,
[1:16:20] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
[1:16:25] And he saith unto them, but whom say ye
[1:16:30] that I am?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou
[1:16:37] art the Christ,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God.
[1:16:46] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:16:48] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[1:16:50] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:16:52] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:16:54] heaven."
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, the seals had been
[1:16:58] opened to him.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word had been open to
[1:17:06] him. Something had taken place in his
[1:17:09] life. He had seen more than the flesh of
[1:17:11] a man.
[1:17:13] Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you recognize it's more
[1:17:17] than your flesh that's doing this work
[1:17:19] today.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; When you recognize it's more than your
[1:17:23] ability that's doing this today. I want
[1:17:26] you to know then you'll recognize that
[1:17:28] it is the mighty God that is still doing
[1:17:30] the work today.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And he said, I will give unto thee the
[1:17:35] keys of the kingdom. And whatsoever thou
[1:17:37] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:17:39] heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt loose on
[1:17:41] earth shall be loosed in heaven. You
[1:17:44] believe that? Tonight,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says,
[1:17:48] watch what he says just for a moment.
[1:17:50] This may be just a little lengthy, but I
[1:17:51] want to I just want to lay some thoughts
[1:17:53] here. He said, Genesis 1:11 and spoken
[1:17:55] word is the original seed. Let every
[1:17:57] seed bring forth of its kind. Simple
[1:18:00] principle. Cows have cows. Horses have
[1:18:03] horses.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Chickens have chickens. Eagles have
[1:18:07] eagles.
[1:18:09] And when God wants to reproduce himself,
[1:18:12] he's going to have sons and daughters of
[1:18:14] God.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hybrid corn. It brings forth a big super
[1:18:22] better crop. Better looking, but it's
[1:18:24] dead. Plant it back. It can't reproduce
[1:18:27] itself again. It's done. It's finished.
[1:18:29] Like Eve, she brought forth a hybrid
[1:18:31] crop. Look at us today. Look around and
[1:18:33] see. See that it's true. Sure it did. It
[1:18:36] wasn't God's purpose. No, sir. just had
[1:18:39] just have to hold back for something
[1:18:40] that I'm thinking right now. He said to
[1:18:43] mix it brings forth a hybrid crop.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, to mix this message
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; brings death into it.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, Luther's revival was great, but
[1:18:55] listen, it won't work today.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Wesley's revival was great. Listen, when
[1:19:01] he was standing there, the supernatural
[1:19:03] power of God, 10,000 people standing in
[1:19:06] a hail storm and the power of God came
[1:19:08] down and 10,000 people are slain in the
[1:19:11] spirit of God. That's great for that
[1:19:13] day. It won't work today.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The Methodist church denominated and
[1:19:20] they died.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; To mix it with this message, it will
[1:19:24] kill it.
[1:19:28] Pentecost was great at Isuza Street. The
[1:19:30] Welch revival, it was great for its day.
[1:19:34] It was the real supernatural hand of
[1:19:36] God. But to mix it today,
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. To mix it today with this
[1:19:44] fresh mana will bring death to it.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; To mix Dr. Dobson with this message.
[1:19:56] to mix TD TD Jake. Are you with me now?
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; To mix Benny Hen. And I'm sorry, but I'm
[1:20:04] preaching.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, but they're great men.
[1:20:12] They've got their calling.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; But we're a bride group of people. We're
[1:20:16] not a church. We're the bride.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; We're the astronaut age.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; We're to be lifted up. I got news for
[1:20:25] you. The chicken yard don't satisfy me
[1:20:28] tonight.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, they got good things to
[1:20:32] say. But listen, I don't need to dig
[1:20:34] through all of their hogwash.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:20:51] Even if they do raise a message book up
[1:20:53] and say, "This is thus sayaeth the
[1:20:55] Lord." But when they pan out across
[1:20:57] their audience, there sits bobt
[1:20:59] Jezebels, painted face Jezebels.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Random was preaching to
[1:21:04] those Pentecostals. He said, "I push the
[1:21:06] word down their throat, put my hands
[1:21:08] over their mouth, and they still try to
[1:21:10] spew it out through my fingers. They
[1:21:13] didn't want it then. They don't want it
[1:21:15] now.
[1:21:30] Brother Ron, I'm looking for something
[1:21:31] new. Well, listen to the tape again.
[1:21:34] You'll catch something new.
[1:21:42] The more I listen to this day this
[1:21:44] scriptures fulfilled, the better I like
[1:21:47] it. The more I listen to indictment, the
[1:21:50] better I like it. The more I listen to
[1:21:52] future home about where I'm going to
[1:21:54] live one of these days, the better I
[1:21:56] like it.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The more that I listen to
[1:22:00] things that are to be, the more I
[1:22:02] recognize that's what God was talking to
[1:22:05] me.
[1:22:15] Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; That is why each revival, each
[1:22:20] generation has to have its own.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It has to have its own revival.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; A chance at the word. Oh, don't you love
[1:22:31] that tonight? Isn't he good to us?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I just need something
[1:22:38] deeper. I don't know if I can go further
[1:22:41] in the message.
[1:22:48] Watch what he says. He said Luther
[1:22:51] refused it.
[1:22:54] So it is today with every one of them.
[1:22:57] They failed to take the word.
[1:23:00] They refuse Christ.
[1:23:04] And anyone that refuses Christ, a man
[1:23:07] and his child has no right to be a wife
[1:23:10] to him.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; He says, you remember in the Bible when
[1:23:16] the king married Esther
[1:23:20] because the queen refused,
[1:23:23] he just got him another.
[1:23:29] What happened when she refused to come
[1:23:31] out with the king to obey him? The same
[1:23:34] thing it is today with a woman that
[1:23:36] refuses to be a wife to her husband. And
[1:23:39] so it is with the church that refuses to
[1:23:42] be compreated
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; in the age that we are now to live in.
[1:23:47] Listen, we're no longer his girlfriend
[1:23:49] that he's flirting with.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; We are now the lamb's wife.
[1:23:58] He slipped the wedding band a
[1:24:01] predestinated grace upon us before the
[1:24:05] foundation of the world.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And we have been invited not just to the
[1:24:10] kitchen, not just to the living room,
[1:24:13] but we have been invited to the bedroom
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; that we might know him.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you?
[1:24:29] He says, "We're not Lutheran."
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And the church said, "Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; We're not Wesleyans.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals." Because
[1:24:38] remember, Pentecostals was the man age.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "We've got to be the
[1:24:48] children of this age through the
[1:24:50] pregnancy of the word to bring forth a
[1:24:52] child of this age, the seed child." He
[1:24:56] says, "I hope that you understand it."
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Couldn't be impregnated." No.
[1:25:02] What did he do? He put her away in
[1:25:04] divorcement, but she dares took him to
[1:25:06] put her away. He put her away. He went
[1:25:09] right on revealing his word to the body
[1:25:12] and vindicated his sane by himself. His
[1:25:15] children begin to kind of look more like
[1:25:18] him.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't look like Mama
[1:25:23] Rome.
[1:25:24] We don't act like mama wrong.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we had a great revival 50
[1:25:40] years ago. I'm glad that you enjoyed
[1:25:42] that.
[1:25:46] Brother Ron, you ought to have been
[1:25:47] here.
[1:25:49] I wish I could have.
[1:25:52] I would have liked to been here when
[1:25:53] brother Brandon preached the seals,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; but he had him here.
[1:26:04] It was his turn.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; It was his turn. He was sitting in the
[1:26:12] back of the building and brother Brand
[1:26:14] says, "You're" He says, "That's not the
[1:26:16] Amen corner. Come on up here.
[1:26:24] All those guys, those great theologians
[1:26:26] looked around said, "Who is this Eddie?"
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; They looked, "Who is he?"
[1:26:40] Boy,
[1:26:42] a boy. Why is Brother Brandon praying
[1:26:44] him special attention? I'll tell you
[1:26:47] why. Because God was paying special
[1:26:49] attention,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but God didn't call my
[1:26:59] name. Sure he did. Before the foundation
[1:27:02] of the world,
[1:27:05] he called your name when you was out in
[1:27:07] drugs and he loved you. Like Romans 5
[1:27:09] said, while you were yet a sinner,
[1:27:11] alienated from the economy of God, God
[1:27:14] spoke to you. He knew where you was at.
[1:27:18] He knew what your condition was. He came
[1:27:21] personally to you.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Many men hunted with brother Brandham.
[1:27:31] That didn't give him eternal life. Many
[1:27:33] men fished with brother Brandham. That
[1:27:35] didn't give him eternal life. It may
[1:27:37] have gave him a great name for a while.
[1:27:39] But listen, it's more than hunting. It's
[1:27:41] more than fishing. But it's catching the
[1:27:43] voice that is behind the voice.
[1:27:49] Many people come to our churches, but
[1:27:52] listen until you catch the voice that's
[1:27:54] behind the voice.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Until that supernatural God begins to
[1:28:00] speak directly individually to you, that
[1:28:02] that word can be made flesh in your
[1:28:05] life.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; How old do I have to be? Listen, I've
[1:28:13] got kids in my church that have stood up
[1:28:16] in their in their school
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and preach serpent seed in kindergarten.
[1:28:24] I've had little girls that refuse to let
[1:28:26] the teacher cut their hair and stand
[1:28:29] there and say, "That's the glory of
[1:28:30] God." First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not how old that you are.
[1:28:37] It's that something that anchors down in
[1:28:39] your heart.
[1:28:43] I love it when threeyear-old children
[1:28:45] come up and say, "I want that same Jesus
[1:28:47] that you talk about to come save my mama
[1:28:50] and come save my daddy." and to watch
[1:28:53] the transforming power of God and save
[1:28:56] mama and save daddy.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, God don't do miracles
[1:29:11] anymore.
[1:29:14] I got news for you. I walk on two feet
[1:29:16] tonight that I was paralyzed in 1995
[1:29:20] and I wasn't supposed to ever walk again
[1:29:22] in my life. But God did an incredible
[1:29:25] miracle laying right in a trauma unit
[1:29:27] with every vertebrae in my back broken.
[1:29:30] God came down to my room.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; God don't save anymore. I'm sorry.
[1:29:44] You're too late. Just in the last few
[1:29:47] weeks, we've seen four drug addicts come
[1:29:49] into the church and get transformed by
[1:29:52] the power of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:58] We're seeing families reunited. We are
[1:30:01] seeing the power of God. If your church
[1:30:04] is dead, try my God.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Ephesian church age, he said this. I
[1:30:19] believe the first meeting was about
[1:30:20] cycles and who how was I to know that I
[1:30:22] was to end in tonight with this with
[1:30:25] this with this thought in mind and then
[1:30:26] we'll carry just a little bit longer. He
[1:30:28] said, "Nevertheless, that I have
[1:30:29] somewhat against thee because thou has
[1:30:31] left thy first love."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; To understand this, you must realize
[1:30:35] that the spirit is not speaking to just
[1:30:37] the original saints of Ephesus alone.
[1:30:40] The message is to the entire age that
[1:30:42] lasted 120 years. It's the message then
[1:30:45] it is to all generations in that span.
[1:30:49] History keeps repeating itself.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ronald never happened to me. The
[1:30:59] greatest robbery that a church ever has
[1:31:02] is when it loses its vision.
[1:31:08] The greatest robbery that you will ever
[1:31:10] have as a personal individual living in
[1:31:12] Leoa
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; is when you come to the place let
[1:31:17] somebody else go to church and let me
[1:31:19] stay home.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I believe I just need to relax.
[1:31:26] When you start
[1:31:29] just saying, "Oh, Brother Ron, but I I
[1:31:31] just need to entertain myself.
[1:31:34] Brother Ron, I just think I'll let
[1:31:36] somebody else worship the Lord.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; When we put up the steer crows that we
[1:31:43] don't have to pray anymore
[1:31:46] when we put up the steer crows, we we
[1:31:48] don't want to go back to that that
[1:31:50] Pentecostal man. I'm afraid somebody
[1:31:53] will say amen too loud.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid somebody will shout.
[1:32:03] Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; But when I get to thinking about what
[1:32:06] Jesus did for me,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; when I start thinking about what he's
[1:32:18] done for my children,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I get excited.
[1:32:23] When I start thinking about the young
[1:32:25] people that have walked watched walk
[1:32:27] watch walk to an altar,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; they had sat for years without an
[1:32:32] experience from God and become
[1:32:34] transformed by the power of Jesus Christ
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; and become preachers and become deacons
[1:32:40] and become anointed and raise families
[1:32:43] by the power of the Holy Ghost. And this
[1:32:46] is more than a book. It's more than a
[1:32:48] tape. It's more than an MP3 player. But
[1:32:52] it's God living inside of them.
[1:32:58] To me, this is more than a church. This
[1:33:00] is more than just another meeting. But I
[1:33:03] believe God in his divine providence
[1:33:05] said, "I'm going to do some last day
[1:33:08] gathering.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; I want to shake you out of your leodyian
[1:33:14] spirit.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I want to wake you up one more time. I
[1:33:18] want to stare you.
[1:33:25] Hallelujah. Brother Ron, I'm saved. I'm
[1:33:28] not questioning that tonight. Brother
[1:33:30] Ron, I have a sanctified life. I'm not
[1:33:32] questioning that tonight. But I want to
[1:33:34] question tonight. How long has it been?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I received the Holy Ghost
[1:33:42] 40 years ago. Bless God. But what about
[1:33:45] tonight?
[1:33:49] What about tonight?
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, man, it will not do you no
[1:33:53] good today.
[1:33:56] Brother, used to I did this and used to
[1:33:58] I did this. What about tonight?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:17] He said the original flame.
[1:34:19] He said simply the manifestation.
[1:34:22] He said then God lights that fire again.
[1:34:24] And the same process is repeated. He
[1:34:27] said it's simply the manifestation of
[1:34:29] truth that God has no grandchildren.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, how dare you to challenge
[1:34:36] my children.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. How dare me?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Listen. Because I want you to know if
[1:34:42] they don't get a supernatural birth with
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; The first time they hear rock and roll
[1:34:48] music, it'll they'll go right toward it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're pushy. Yes, sir. I
[1:34:55] used to push drugs.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I used to push the wrong kind of thing,
[1:34:59] but now I push.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I push Jesus Christ.
[1:35:12] Listen, I don't have to work this word
[1:35:14] up. It's got life of its own.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; The fervent desire to please God, the
[1:35:23] passion to know his word, the cry out
[1:35:25] for the reaching out of the spirit of
[1:35:26] God, all begins to fade. And instead of
[1:35:28] the church being on fire with the fire
[1:35:30] of God, it has cooled off and become a
[1:35:32] bit formal.
[1:35:36] You think that spirit's died?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; They got all their churches.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Now we have to be tried by every spirit.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You have to overcome.
[1:36:01] It's not enough for your pastor to
[1:36:03] overcome.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; It's not enough for them to preach this
[1:36:08] message with all their heart.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; But what about you?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a gift of giving, but
[1:36:17] there's a gift of pulling.
[1:36:25] It'll never come into my church. The
[1:36:28] very slimy hands of the devil wants to
[1:36:32] stop every one of our message.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; We can have all the mechanics exactly
[1:36:41] right and know all the doctrines exactly
[1:36:43] right,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; but if the life of Jesus Christ don't
[1:36:47] live,
[1:36:49] All of that matters nothing.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a proper balance
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; to it all.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; What are we going to prevail against,
[1:37:01] brother Ron?
[1:37:03] Formality,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; fashionable worship.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; The polishing up of the world. Before
[1:37:15] long, we don't have preachers that's
[1:37:17] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; We've got quotas.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Before long, we've got congregations
[1:37:25] that live any kind of way that they want
[1:37:27] to.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But I've got news for you. There's going
[1:37:30] to be a bride that is without spot or
[1:37:32] blemish.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; They're going to look at the word just
[1:37:40] like Jesus looked at the word.
[1:37:44] And Jesus believed the word for himself
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; when he looked at the word. And we're
[1:37:50] going to look at the word for ourself.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And we're going to read where it says,
[1:37:55] "You're a super race, a super church.
[1:37:59] You're an invincible army upon the
[1:38:02] earth.
[1:38:14] We are going to look at this word, our
[1:38:16] script.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; We're going to look at our script and
[1:38:21] see where it says shall be bone of his
[1:38:24] bone, life of his life, power of his
[1:38:27] power.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Who is that? Me.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:38:35] God is not going to rapture this paper.
[1:38:37] He's not going to rapture these screens.
[1:38:40] He's not going to rapture these pews.
[1:38:42] He's going to rapture human vessels.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; That God has emptied them of their
[1:38:51] humanity. He's emptied them. He's took
[1:38:54] all of their sins away.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Satan, the accuser of the brethren, he
[1:39:01] remembers what you used to be.
[1:39:04] But the lamb who is worthy stepped forth
[1:39:07] from the throne. He took the book.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Your original auto autobiography
[1:39:17] had a lot of bad stuff written in there.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Yours was like Abraham rolling around on
[1:39:24] the ground and laughing at God.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yours was like Abraham. You were liars.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; The children were liars.
[1:39:33] Yours was like Jacob. None of us would
[1:39:36] have picked Jacob.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; But probably people sitting in your pew
[1:39:40] wouldn't have picked you
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; 25 years ago. You wouldn't have wanted
[1:39:47] to hear me and Tom preach.
[1:39:54] You can't imagine a boy being redheaded
[1:39:56] with long hair down his back standing
[1:39:59] before you tonight with a transforming
[1:40:02] power.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Don't throw your nose in the air and
[1:40:15] say, "I never did that." I've got news
[1:40:17] for you. God just gave me an
[1:40:19] illumination of what predestination was
[1:40:22] and real justification was.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And remember, it took just as much blood
[1:40:27] for you as it did for me.
[1:40:35] Hallelujah. And when so I when I read a
[1:40:38] quote, it says, "It was as though you
[1:40:40] never did it in the first place." and sa
[1:40:44] and Satan begins to go down through my
[1:40:46] memory channel and reminds me of this
[1:40:48] and reminds me of this and reminds me of
[1:40:51] this and reminds me of this.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I shake those chains
[1:41:01] off.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was part of a
[1:41:06] bootleggger's family.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Most of his family is in jail tonight.
[1:41:12] But I want you to understand tonight, he
[1:41:14] was not so proud of mom and daddy, but
[1:41:17] he was proud of his heavenly father.
[1:41:21] I'm not so proud of my past history. But
[1:41:23] Jesus Christ rewrote my book. He took my
[1:41:27] claim. He took my redemption.
[1:41:35] Satan wars with you in your mind. He
[1:41:38] wars with you. He torments you.
[1:41:41] You've got the picture the wrong way.
[1:41:43] You are sent here to torment the devil.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; You are sent here to create an
[1:41:52] atmosphere around you that an amateur
[1:41:55] god can create with a positive attitude
[1:41:58] that the devil can't do nothing.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah. He can't touch a hair on my
[1:42:02] head. He can't touch a hair on my head.
[1:42:11] Hallelujah.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; He can't touch one hair of your head
[1:42:14] before he goes before my father and gets
[1:42:17] permission from my father. And before he
[1:42:19] gets permission from my father, he's had
[1:42:21] fellowship with me. And he has a trust
[1:42:23] inside of me that he can send me through
[1:42:25] the valley of the shadow of death.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah.
[1:42:31] He can send me through the valley of the
[1:42:33] shadow of death. And as David said,
[1:42:35] "Yay, though I walk through the valley
[1:42:36] of the shadow of death, I will fear no
[1:42:38] evil, for thou art with me."
[1:42:45] Your God hasn't left you.
[1:42:48] This is the greatest revival that has
[1:42:50] ever struck the earth. This is the
[1:42:53] awakening of the bride. This is the son
[1:42:56] of man that has been revealed to you
[1:42:59] that's living inside of your life.
[1:43:19] Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] Brother said, "Now if the church could
[1:43:28] only realize how much power and
[1:43:31] authority that she has." Thank you,
[1:43:33] brother Ed.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; He said that you were ambassadors.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm waiting on something. What
[1:43:44] are you waiting on?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You may be the only one living in your
[1:43:48] school.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You may be the only one living in your
[1:43:51] community in the internet. You may be
[1:43:53] the only one in your whole state,
[1:43:58] but God is dependent on you.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation world, he saved
[1:44:06] you to this hour.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; He pre-planned you that you can live
[1:44:12] right here in 77 2007. You can live to
[1:44:17] see this day.
[1:44:22] God has saved a witness for the earth.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You just happen to be that witness
[1:44:29] today.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I'm only trying to catch my breath.
[1:45:00] Brother Tim touched this this last
[1:45:02] night,
[1:45:04] but I want to read you about you. This
[1:45:06] may be common to you, but I want to read
[1:45:08] about you just for a minute.
[1:45:12] Because listen,
[1:45:14] President Bush
[1:45:16] does not speak to as a powerful group of
[1:45:18] people as I'm speaking to tonight.
[1:45:28] the governors and the kings of the earth
[1:45:30] when they gather all their pump and
[1:45:31] their splendor together and have their
[1:45:33] $1,000 plate meals and they have all
[1:45:37] their protocol and they gather them in
[1:45:38] and they set them down at a certain spot
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; and all the men behind the scene gather
[1:45:43] them and set them at a certain position.
[1:45:45] Everybody's sitting there to wait to
[1:45:46] hear something that don't mean nothing
[1:45:48] way.
[1:45:54] all promises.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Can't live through it.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Screaming for peace and safety.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Wondering why the world has fallen
[1:46:04] apart.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Wondering why every demon of hell has
[1:46:07] been loosed from the river Euphrates?
[1:46:09] We've got the answer.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Wondering why our streets are becoming
[1:46:15] more polluted? Wondering why the morals
[1:46:17] of the world is falling apart? We've got
[1:46:20] the answer.
[1:46:23] Wondering why America's falling apart?
[1:46:25] We've got the answer.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Wondering why Russia's coming back up on
[1:46:29] the scene? We've got the answer.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Wondering why the church world don't
[1:46:34] have answers anymore? We've got the
[1:46:36] answer.
[1:46:49] A goat farmer talked to you last night.
[1:46:56] of all the theologians of the whole
[1:46:58] world,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; they build their huge giant structures
[1:47:05] of buildings,
[1:47:07] brains from their head to their waist.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And God calls us from all over the
[1:47:19] earth.
[1:47:22] the most powerful people in the whole
[1:47:24] world.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; How God must chuckle sometimes. Satan's
[1:47:28] looking and he's looking and he's
[1:47:30] looking and here we are.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He don't have to look no more. Here we
[1:47:34] are.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; When they didn't recognize it, we did.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says there's living
[1:47:44] physical attributes of God that God
[1:47:46] thought of before the foundation world.
[1:47:48] Here we are.
[1:47:54] So he calls this group of people
[1:47:55] together and he's had people from
[1:47:57] country all over the world. And then he
[1:47:59] has a goat farmer last night
[1:48:02] and here tonight he's got another
[1:48:04] country boy. It's a mile up my gravel
[1:48:06] driveway. Before I left, I had to shoe a
[1:48:10] 200lb bear out of a pine tree.
[1:48:15] My dogs should run a bear up pine tree
[1:48:17] right beside of my house. I live in a
[1:48:19] little old cabin. Listen to the world. I
[1:48:22] am a nobody.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; The who's who don't have my name.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I don't sit on the great boards of the
[1:48:30] world.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; But God thought of me.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I was important to him.
[1:48:50] I was a bag of nerves before we got
[1:48:52] here, Brother Tim.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; But feels pretty good right now.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you about yourself.
[1:49:13] You may have read it a thousand times.
[1:49:14] I'm going to read it one more time to
[1:49:16] you,
[1:49:19] brother Ron. We've heard that a thousand
[1:49:20] times. Can you imagine how many times
[1:49:21] the devil stood in a prayer line?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham reminded him,
[1:49:26] "Satan, I want to talk to you.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; that I met an angel.
[1:49:40] I met an angel in a cave. And he told me
[1:49:44] that if I could get the people to
[1:49:45] believe
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; that not even cancer would stand before
[1:49:50] me.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan, I want to remind you that
[1:49:53] you're stripped.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have any power.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have any power.
[1:50:00] And he heard that night after night
[1:50:03] after night after night.
[1:50:11] Brother Ron, I don't feel nothing here
[1:50:12] tonight. In deep callth to the deep,
[1:50:14] there's a man standing there. He's kind
[1:50:16] of humped over in his shoulders and he's
[1:50:18] standing up kind of like this right
[1:50:19] here. And brother Brown said, "I see
[1:50:21] you're excited."
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He don't look excited to me.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; So you can't measure anything by
[1:50:31] physical action.
[1:50:35] Brother Bram said, "I see that you're
[1:50:36] excited." He said, "It's not me that has
[1:50:39] caused you to be excited. It's him."
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham didn't heal
[1:50:45] him. Jesus Christ healed him.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; This wasn't the words of a man. This
[1:50:57] wasn't the words of William Brandham.
[1:50:59] This is the words of Jesus Christ to you
[1:51:02] and I.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Let me show you another reason why that
[1:51:10] Satan hates the book of Revelation of
[1:51:11] Jesus Christ in the church. Important
[1:51:15] when it's in the church.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; He knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:51:21] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; If he ever heal one person,
[1:51:31] He's still in the healing business.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; If he ever saved one person, he's still
[1:51:37] in the saving business.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; There was a revelation went on one time
[1:51:43] that said nobody could get saved after
[1:51:45] 1977. I don't believe it
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; cuz I got saved in 1983.
[1:51:56] He knows that a whole lot more than 90%
[1:51:58] of the theologian. He knows that since
[1:52:00] God is immutable in his nature, he's
[1:52:02] immutable in his ways. He said, "Thus
[1:52:05] Satan knows assuredly that the original
[1:52:07] church at Pentecost with the power of
[1:52:09] God." Mark 16 in action. It's the true
[1:52:11] church that Jesus claims is his own, and
[1:52:14] all else is false.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Now remember this. Christ in the true
[1:52:22] church. How many believes you're part of
[1:52:23] the true church?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; It's a continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "But the book of Revelation
[1:52:31] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[1:52:33] would come into the church and defile
[1:52:35] it, making it lukewarm and formal and
[1:52:37] powerless." He said, "It exposes Satan
[1:52:40] and reveals his works, the attempted
[1:52:42] destruction of God's people, right down
[1:52:44] to the discredited of God's word, right
[1:52:46] down to the time that he is cast in the
[1:52:48] lake of fire. He fights it.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; He fights you coming to church.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; He fights you on your job. He fights you
[1:53:00] in your neighborhood. He fights you
[1:53:02] every way that you can. Cuz if you can
[1:53:04] get back to your source of your revival.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, you're strong only as
[1:53:14] strong as your source is.
[1:53:25] Brother Harold, seven church ages. Every
[1:53:28] one of those candles, their wick went
[1:53:31] right down into the same oil.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Under Luther was some powerful preachers
[1:53:37] that came caught the same anointing that
[1:53:40] Luther had.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; They preached the same word that Luther
[1:53:43] preached under John Wesley. Powerful men
[1:53:46] all the way across the earth caught that
[1:53:48] same anointing. Not with the same gift,
[1:53:51] but caught the same anointing.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; They may have never laid their eyes on
[1:53:56] the prophet of God,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; but because they were drinking from the
[1:54:03] same oil.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am the vine and you are
[1:54:09] the branches,"
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; we get energized from that same vine.
[1:54:20] Same Lord Jesus that walked into that
[1:54:22] little room and told Brother Brandham
[1:54:23] what the next seal was.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; That same Lord Jesus, Brother Ernie
[1:54:28] wants to live in your life.
[1:54:32] You believe that, don't you?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Why you quiet now?
[1:54:46] That same Christ, that same anointed
[1:54:49] one,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; that same anointed one wants to come to
[1:54:54] your pew.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He wants to be your source.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Denomination is not my source.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; The newspaper is not my source.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; TBNN is not my source.
[1:55:10] I have a source
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; of strength when I am weak.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to tire you. I won't be much
[1:55:21] longer.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; He fights it. He cannot stand it. He
[1:55:29] knows that if the people Who are those
[1:55:31] people?
[1:55:40] I know my name is written in the book.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Ray, you know that your name is written
[1:55:50] in the book.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Not because Edis told you.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; He was only anointed to carry it across
[1:56:01] the pulpit. And then all of a sudden a
[1:56:03] revival takes place in your private pew.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true
[1:56:16] revelation
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; of the true church
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; and what she is and what she stands for.
[1:56:30] She can do the greater works.
[1:56:36] She will be an invincible army.
[1:56:48] I'm just going to jump down. He said
[1:56:50] this. He said, "You will recall that I
[1:56:53] mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:56:54] message that this book that we're
[1:56:56] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:56:57] Jesus Christ himself in the church." and
[1:57:00] in his future work in his work in the
[1:57:01] future ages. And then I mentioned that
[1:57:03] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:57:05] revelation or we will fail to give it.
[1:57:08] He said bringing these two thoughts
[1:57:09] together, you will see it will just take
[1:57:11] more. It won't just take ordinary study
[1:57:14] and thinking to make this book real.
[1:57:17] Listen, if this book isn't real to you
[1:57:19] tonight,
[1:57:24] if this book is not real to you
[1:57:30] when you come to church,
[1:57:33] if there's not a real
[1:57:35] move of God going on in your life,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; if that fountain inside of you feels
[1:57:42] like it's dried up and it's become
[1:57:44] common,
[1:57:48] I adjure you by the I challenge you
[1:57:50] tonight.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight.
[1:57:55] Quit arguing with the message.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Quit fighting with the message.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Quit quit dotting the eyes and crossing
[1:58:04] the tees.
[1:58:06] Quit look trying to see who's holier
[1:58:08] than thou.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Come to the revelation in your heart. If
[1:58:14] there's one going in British Columbia,
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; if your jobs getting in your way, your
[1:58:25] home's getting in your way, your
[1:58:27] family's getting in your way, shake it
[1:58:29] off,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; brother. I thought revival were only for
[1:58:39] another day. I didn't live in another
[1:58:41] day.
[1:58:44] I'm sorry I didn't live in another day.
[1:58:47] This is my day.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; My passion is not for Michael Jordan and
[1:58:54] the Bulls. My passion is not for
[1:58:56] Hollywood.
[1:59:00] My passion is not for baseball. My
[1:59:03] passion is not for football. My passion
[1:59:05] is not for the world and it's rock and
[1:59:08] roll and it's country music.
[1:59:11] My passion,
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; my passion tonight
[1:59:18] is that he might live among us.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; How do I know if I've got it? What does
[1:59:38] your life produce?
[1:59:46] I'm going to finish with this thought.
[1:59:50] At the end of the day,
[1:59:54] you forgive me if you think that I tried
[1:59:56] to work you up,
[2:00:00] but I'm just excited about what I
[2:00:02] believe.
[2:00:14] At the end of the day, when there's no
[2:00:15] more organ playing,
[2:00:21] when the iPod has been laid down,
[2:00:26] when your favorite preacher's voice is
[2:00:28] not echoing in your ears,
[2:00:31] when you turn the the lights off at
[2:00:33] night,
[2:00:37] And all the emotion of the day is over
[2:00:39] with.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Can you look back and say he lived
[2:00:43] today?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; What did my life produced today? Not my
[2:00:51] works, but him living through me.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Was an actor. Was I an impostor? Was a
[2:01:01] phony?
[2:01:03] Excuse
[2:01:09] me.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; But what I read about brother Brandham
[2:01:13] and listening about brother Brandham, he
[2:01:14] was a real man.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Wasn't no fake about him. He was honest.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; He told us when he made mistakes.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; He was a man. He told us when he made
[2:01:27] mistakes.
[2:01:32] He told us that he wanted to be a
[2:01:34] trapper.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; But there was something that so lived in
[2:01:38] his life that changed prostitutes lives
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; that made devils run for cover.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to say this to you. When
[2:01:50] Jesus walked before Pilot, he didn't say
[2:01:53] a word, but there was so much about his
[2:01:55] presence
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; until a howling mob
[2:02:01] couldn't be heard in Pilot's ears. But
[2:02:03] Jesus with his own non-speaking voice
[2:02:08] stood there with his presence
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; and shook one of the mightiest governors
[2:02:13] that ever lived.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; When you walk onto your job, does your
[2:02:22] presence, and I'm not talking about your
[2:02:24] humanity,
[2:02:27] Listen,
[2:02:29] because his presence will live in China.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; His presence will live in Zimbabwe.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; His presence will live in Virginia. His
[2:02:38] presence will live here in Canada.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It's the same God in Zimbabwe as it is
[2:02:44] right here.
[2:02:54] presence of Jesus Christ living in your
[2:02:56] life.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Does it make other people salty
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; to want to be a real Christian?
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; No, this isn't deep tonight.
[2:03:12] This is what God laid on my heart.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; We can have a meeting like this and
[2:03:18] we've got some of the speakers that ever
[2:03:20] lived. And I felt so ashamed that I took
[2:03:22] I I'm here tonight.
[2:03:25] But when this meeting is over with,
[2:03:28] he don't live in your life.
[2:03:33] He he our Lord Jesus Christ don't live
[2:03:38] in our life.
[2:03:41] We wasted power.
[2:03:52] He don't meet you in your private prayer
[2:03:54] closet.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; He don't come off the pages.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; You can have an intimate affair with
[2:04:05] him.
[2:04:13] Brother Ron, I know the message, but do
[2:04:16] you know him?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Don't roll your head at me.
[2:04:26] Don't stick your collar out at me.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'd rather stand here today a poor
[2:04:33] preacher like David was the poorest
[2:04:35] excuse for a for a soldier on the field.
[2:04:39] I'd rather stand here tonight and say,
[2:04:41] "Do you know him
[2:04:44] today?
[2:05:01] the
[2:05:05] ghost.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:40] with our heads bowed just a moment.
[2:05:51] said, "But brother Ron, we're beyond
[2:05:53] altar calls."
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid sometimes we went too far
[2:05:59] beyond.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Intellectualism won't get you nowhere.
[2:06:16] It has its place.
[2:06:21] But I want to ask you tonight just if
[2:06:23] you be honest with yourself and say,
[2:06:24] "Brother Ron, I personally need a
[2:06:27] revival in my heart, in my life. It
[2:06:30] feels like I've just been running
[2:06:31] through the meal, just one service after
[2:06:34] another, making myself come.
[2:06:38] It feels like that when I pray, it just
[2:06:40] don't get nowhere. It feels like the
[2:06:43] chains of sin has me bound." Maybe
[2:06:45] there'll be one here tonight to say, "I
[2:06:47] just can't lay those things down, those
[2:06:50] habits down." I want to say to you,
[2:06:52] tonight is your night.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Don't wait till tomorrow. Don't make
[2:06:57] promises you can't keep because you
[2:06:58] can't do it on your own. Let him come.
[2:07:01] Let him be that supernatural God to you.
[2:07:04] I'm not talking about a euphoria you
[2:07:06] can't live up to, but I'm talking about
[2:07:08] a reality.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; You take one step, he'll take the next
[2:07:13] one.
[2:07:15] You say, "God, help me."
[2:07:18] Brother Ron, you're a different kind of
[2:07:19] preacher. I just got to be who I am. I'm
[2:07:21] asking you tonight, would you take a
[2:07:24] step out and say, "God, I need a revival
[2:07:26] in my life. I invite you to this altar.
[2:07:29] I ask you tonight, would it be your turn
[2:07:32] tonight? God, rekindle the flame in my
[2:07:34] life.
[2:07:37] Rekindle the flame in my life tonight.
[2:07:41] Rekindle me tonight.
[2:07:45] I'm not talking about emotion.
[2:07:48] I'm talking about a real life.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go down.
[2:08:04] I'm reminded every time that brother
[2:08:06] Brandham would sit in a congregation,
[2:08:08] you hear somebody else preach, as soon
[2:08:10] as the altar call came, he was the first
[2:08:12] one on the altar. We all can say, "I
[2:08:15] need more of God."
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I got news for you tonight. Before I
[2:08:20] could preach this to you, I had to pray
[2:08:22] through for myself because a preacher,
[2:08:24] his qualification is that he meet that
[2:08:26] pillar of fire for himself.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; You can't preach something you don't
[2:08:30] have for yourself.
[2:08:35] My children are falling away. What about
[2:08:37] your life?
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; I just don't get as much out of services
[2:08:45] as I used to get.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; What's got in the way?
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:03] He
[2:09:07] just smile.
[2:09:30] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads before
[2:09:32] you tonight,
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; whether we're standing at this altar,
[2:09:35] standing at the back of this building,
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; we ask you at the first of this meeting
[2:09:44] to have a conference.
[2:09:52] Many people standing in prayer lines
[2:09:54] didn't hear what they wanted to hear.
[2:09:58] Many times as a congregation, we don't
[2:09:59] get what we're expecting for the night.
[2:10:04] I watched you even as you turned my own
[2:10:07] thoughts this evening
[2:10:09] because there's children here that have
[2:10:10] a need
[2:10:12] and you told your disciples, "I have a
[2:10:14] need that I might go by Samaria."
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's a woman at the well that
[2:10:21] you needed to talk to tonight.
[2:10:23] Maybe even out on the internet, there's
[2:10:25] somebody you're talking to just now.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; There's one mediator between God and
[2:10:30] man, and that is the man Jesus Christ.
[2:10:33] Lord Jesus, we ask you to come to where
[2:10:35] we're at.
[2:10:38] We ask you to loose the chains of sin.
[2:10:42] We ask you to go down through our memory
[2:10:44] alley tonight.
[2:10:46] What can wash away my sins? Nothing but
[2:10:49] the blood of Jesus.
[2:10:51] What can restore me again? Nothing but
[2:10:54] the blood of Jesus.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Redemption's claim has already been
[2:10:59] made. The accuser stands there with
[2:11:02] nothing to say. Oh God, you're the one
[2:11:05] tonight.
[2:11:07] These you're they're your children. This
[2:11:10] is your wife tonight. You're responsible
[2:11:12] for them, Father.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, brood over our lives and speak to
[2:11:17] our hearts tonight in the name of Jesus
[2:11:19] Christ.
[2:11:22] Come to every heart, Lord. We pour with
[2:11:25] our voices to you, dear God.
[2:11:29] Rekindle my flame.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; David said, "Restore to me the joy."
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Cares of life
[2:11:47] deteriorate us.
[2:11:50] cares of life.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; The reality of working nine and 10
[2:11:55] hours. The reality of Leoa
[2:11:59] irks at our lives. The reality of this
[2:12:03] dark age and the demon powers of hell
[2:12:07] makes us get weary. But you said don't
[2:12:10] get weary and welloing.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; So we come back to our source tonight.
[2:12:16] We come back to the well tonight.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; We come back to our place of strength
[2:12:22] tonight.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; And I ask you tonight that you would
[2:12:25] strengthen us. If Jesus had to go away
[2:12:27] to pray, how much more do we need to
[2:12:30] step aside for a little while? Come
[2:12:33] aside for a little while that you can
[2:12:36] renew our strength.
[2:12:44] We open the door tonight, Father.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Come, we pray. Rude over our lives.
[2:12:58] We welcome you here tonight. We welcome
[2:13:01] the word tonight.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; We have a welcome spirit for you
[2:13:05] tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:12] Save loved ones tonight.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Save our loved ones tonight.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Arrest him tonight.
[2:13:24] May the Holy Ghost take them prisoner
[2:13:26] tonight.
[2:13:28] Go to where they're at tonight.
[2:13:31] May they find their lives miserable
[2:13:33] until they find their way to Jesus
[2:13:35] Christ.
[2:13:55] Oh Jesus, it's you we want to see.
[2:14:05] Won't you just pour your heart to him
[2:14:07] just now?
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:14] Hallelujah.
[2:14:16] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:31] You are
[2:14:50] glorious.
[2:15:03] Hallelujah.
[2:15:20] Hallelujah.
[2:15:34] glory.
[2:15:37] Hallelujah.
[2:16:06] I
[2:16:09] love him.
[2:16:14] I
[2:16:17] love you
[2:16:21] because
[2:16:25] he first
[2:16:28] loved me.
[2:16:40] Just my
[2:16:44] Sal
[2:16:56] dream
[2:17:02] after service such as this and after a
[2:17:05] word we've heard such as this and after
[2:17:07] the Holy Spirit. How many agree the Holy
[2:17:11] Spirit is speaking?
[2:17:14] I want to say to this congregation with
[2:17:16] all
[2:17:18] whatever authority God gives me, I
[2:17:20] believe I can say it with his authority.
[2:17:24] Either
[2:17:26] we need prayer ourselves or somebody
[2:17:29] beside us needs prayer, someone in this
[2:17:32] building needs prayer. And I believe we
[2:17:35] have a lot of evidence.
[2:17:38] I would be happy to have every person in
[2:17:41] here pray for me.
[2:17:44] I want to live
[2:17:48] a greater reflection.
[2:17:51] I want that very nature of Christ.
[2:17:55] I'd be happy tonight to have every bit
[2:17:58] of Edis burned out of me and have God so
[2:18:03] fill every every part of my being.
[2:18:07] That's my desire.
[2:18:10] We have many ministers here and there's
[2:18:13] people here
[2:18:15] that need prayer. I wonder if you could
[2:18:18] come and pray for someone. Just come
[2:18:22] behind them and pray for them. The
[2:18:25] ministers can come if you would. Let's
[2:18:28] pray for these that have come. And we're
[2:18:32] going to we're going to pray for one
[2:18:35] another. We could sing, but we're not
[2:18:37] going to sing just now. We're going to
[2:18:39] pray. We're going to pray earnestly.
[2:18:44] And if you feel so inclined, why don't
[2:18:46] you pray for someone else?
[2:18:50] Someone that may not even be in this
[2:18:52] building.
[2:18:53] The Holy Spirit is not restricted by
[2:18:55] these walls. Would you go, oh Holy
[2:18:59] Spirit,
[2:19:01] into the room or into the place where my
[2:19:05] loved one is, my son, my daughter? Do
[2:19:09] you believe that God would hear us as we
[2:19:11] pray? I believe he will. I'd like this
[2:19:15] whole congregation to enter into prayer.
[2:19:18] Maybe you want to pray for yourself.
[2:19:21] Maybe you want to empty out yourself and
[2:19:23] just surrender yourself and find a new
[2:19:26] place of surrender with Christ.
[2:19:30] Oh God, visit us.
[2:19:33] Visit us. I pray
[2:19:36] these that are have come and have a
[2:19:39] desire. Oh God, they've come with a
[2:19:42] purpose. Lord, every man of God now
[2:19:47] prays a prayer. Let this whole
[2:19:49] congregation now enter into prayer.
[2:19:53] Let's lift up our voice to him.
[2:19:57] Our God
[2:19:59] is a God that hears us when we pray.
[2:20:05] Father,
[2:20:09] look down into the inner region, inner
[2:20:12] bar.
[2:20:15] Oh, how our soul, my soul thirst after
[2:20:19] the living God.
[2:20:23] Let your perfect will be done. Those of
[2:20:26] you that have come, those of you that
[2:20:29] are praying here, open your mouth. Lift
[2:20:32] up your voice.
[2:20:36] If you desire to be filled, say, "Fill
[2:20:39] me now, Lord. Not tomorrow. Fill me now.
[2:20:42] I'm here to be filled now.
[2:20:46] I'm here to receive it now.
[2:20:49] Let that fullness of the Holy Spirit.
[2:20:52] Let that baptism of fire take place.
[2:20:57] Let it be a change, a transformation as
[2:21:00] the man of God, our brother Spencer
[2:21:02] spoke tonight.
[2:21:05] Let the lives be changed.
[2:21:08] Let the transforming power, oh God,
[2:21:12] reign supreme through these beings.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Let the prayer now be answered. Father,
[2:21:20] we come to you believing
[2:21:23] as your children.
[2:21:25] As your children,
[2:21:27] Lord, break down the resistance. Break
[2:21:30] down the break down the unbelief. Oh
[2:21:33] God, break down the walls. Remove, oh
[2:21:36] God, the hindrances.
[2:21:39] I pray there be a cleansing fire.
[2:21:41] Cleanse me now. Cleanse me now. Fill me
[2:21:44] now, oh God. Hear the prayer.
[2:21:48] And may the answer now come.
[2:21:53] Oh God. Oh God.
[2:21:57] Grant it Lord Jesus.
[2:22:05] Hallelujah.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; How long shall I pray? Pray until.
[2:22:12] Pray until
[2:22:14] you tell him, "I'm here until
[2:22:17] I'm not leaving here till I receive what
[2:22:20] I've come for."
[2:22:22] Come with that kind of faith.
[2:22:26] I'm here to receive it. I'm here to
[2:22:29] receive a full measure.
[2:22:34] If you're sick, if you're sick and
[2:22:36] afflicted, I believe in healing power.
[2:22:41] God, come and heal.
[2:22:45] Remove the sickness. Remove the disease.
[2:22:51] Let the supernatural take place.
[2:22:55] He's a supernatural God.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:11] Fill me now.
[2:23:14] Oh,
[2:23:15] fill me
[2:23:19] with
[2:23:22] me now.
[2:23:26] Jesus
[2:23:28] come
[2:23:30] and fill
[2:23:32] me now
[2:23:38] with
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Are you able to hear receive more of the
[2:23:45] Holy Spirit? The spirit of God come and
[2:23:49] take control, Lord. You want them to
[2:23:51] have the preeminence in your life, in
[2:23:53] your home.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Let him change the atmosphere.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus, my Jesus, come
[2:24:10] and fill
[2:24:13] me now.
[2:24:15] Oh, fill
[2:24:18] me with
[2:24:20] Thy Holy
[2:24:23] Spirit
[2:24:26] come
[2:24:30] and
[2:24:34] come by here. Come by here. Come by
[2:24:37] here.
[2:24:39] Come by here. Come here. Come by here.
[2:24:44] My Lord.
[2:24:48] Oh, come by.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Invite him to come. Invite him.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, come
[2:25:03] by.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; When you invite him, he'll come. The
[2:25:09] prophet said,
[2:25:28] I'd like everyone to maybe close your
[2:25:30] eyes and sing it now. Someone's praying,
[2:25:34] Lord.
[2:25:39] Lord,
[2:25:42] my king
[2:25:55] of my
[2:26:03] Break my heart.
[2:26:09] Come by.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Someone's praying. Lord,
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; we're praying.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; We're praying. I'm praying people
[2:26:40] Lord someone
[2:26:42] pray
[2:27:16] Jesus is passing this way.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus is passing this way.
[2:27:38] Oh Jesus
[2:27:41] is passing
[2:27:44] this way
[2:27:48] is passing
[2:27:51] this way.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus friends. Oh, it is Jesus.
[2:27:58] Oh, Jesus
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; is passing
[2:28:04] this way.
[2:28:19] Jesus is
[2:28:29] passing.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; I feel somebody still needs
[2:28:40] that breaking
[2:28:43] of that fedter. And I want the
[2:28:46] congregation to come in one heart and
[2:28:48] one spirit
[2:28:51] as we join and blend our voices
[2:28:55] in one attribute to the other
[2:28:58] and utter these words in song. Jesus
[2:29:01] breaks every feder
[2:29:05] and sets me free. And if there's one
[2:29:09] bound person or more and you know that
[2:29:13] there's still shackles on your life, I
[2:29:16] want you to say the words, "Jesus breaks
[2:29:20] every feeder
[2:29:23] and sets me free."
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; We're a people that are free.
[2:29:32] how Satan would like to have you walk
[2:29:34] out of the building tonight still bound
[2:29:36] and say, "I still got them. I still got
[2:29:39] them. I still got them bound. Let those
[2:29:41] shackles fall. Hallelujah. Let those
[2:29:44] shackles be broken. Let those chains
[2:29:48] fall in the name of Jesus Christ that he
[2:29:51] might be rejoiced, that he might be
[2:29:54] given the victory, that he might be
[2:29:56] given the praise that he earned at
[2:29:59] Calvary.
[2:30:02] Jesus breaks
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; every
[2:30:09] fatterus.
[2:30:23] Oh my Jesus.
[2:30:30] every
[2:30:32] feather
[2:30:35] and he
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; and then we'll rejoice and give him all
[2:30:46] the glory
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:31:05] Every
[2:31:09] Jesus
[2:31:11] pray
[2:31:20] and he set
[2:31:25] me
[2:31:28] free.
[2:31:30] I will shoutout.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; I will shout
[2:31:37] hallelujah.
[2:31:41] I will
[2:31:53] shout.
[2:31:56] I will shout hallelujah
[2:32:03] for he
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; I know he set me he set me free. Let's
[2:32:11] sing that again.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; I will shout I will shout hallelujah.
[2:32:24] I will shout
[2:32:35] I will
[2:32:46] for he sets
[2:32:50] me
[2:32:57] Oh, so wonderful.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:18] God in mercy.
[2:33:24] sending his son. Oh, we were undone.
[2:33:30] God rich in mercy.
[2:33:34] Oh, and God rich in grace,
[2:33:38] God rich in love. He sent out his from
[2:33:44] heaven
[2:33:48] to all
[2:33:51] today.
[2:33:55] God rich in mercy.
[2:34:01] God rich in mercy.
[2:34:06] Oh God rich in mercy.
[2:34:12] God rich in mercy.
[2:34:20] We were God
[2:34:23] rich in mercy.
[2:34:28] God rich in grace, God rich in love.
[2:34:33] sending Israel from heaven above
[2:34:39] to all men today.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God rich in mercy.
[2:34:52] God rich in mercy.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it one more time.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God rich in mercy.
[2:35:02] God in mercy.
[2:35:10] Oh, we were our God. God rich in mercy.
[2:35:18] Oh, God rich in grace, God rich in love,
[2:35:23] sending his best from heaven above,
[2:35:28] saying to all men today,
[2:35:36] God rich in mercy,
[2:35:41] God rich in mercy.
[2:35:46] He was rich in his word tonight. He was
[2:35:49] rich in his word last night. He's been
[2:35:52] rich in his word all through this
[2:35:55] convention and before the convention.
[2:35:58] Hallelujah.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; And he will be tomorrow.
[2:36:05] Our brother Gideon Ratif preached last
[2:36:08] Sunday morning, Breaking the Cycle.
[2:36:11] I've been looking for that moment where
[2:36:14] some of you would respond and break the
[2:36:17] cycle. Hallelujah.
[2:36:20] I love to see the devil defeated. I love
[2:36:23] to see him defeated. We ought to rejoice
[2:36:26] when he's defeated.
[2:36:32] Hallelujah.
[2:36:34] The scripture tells us that when they
[2:36:36] saw they saw the judgment of God and
[2:36:39] they saw the judgment of the great
[2:36:41] and they saw him cast into the lake of
[2:36:44] fire, the saints of God said,
[2:36:46] "Hallelujah.
[2:36:49] Glory to God." We don't have any
[2:36:52] sympathy for the enemy.
[2:36:54] He
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; We're his enemy.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:37:03] Praise God.
[2:37:05] Praise God.
[2:37:08] Hallelujah.
[2:37:10] God rich and mercy.
[2:37:14] Hallelujah.
[2:37:17] Praise the Lord.
[2:37:19] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:37:23] Praise his name.
[2:37:26] Praise our God.
[2:37:29] The devil hates it. We love it. Praise
[2:37:33] our God.
[2:37:35] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:37:38] Hallelujah.
[2:37:40] Oh, we've heard the joyful sound.
[2:37:42] There's been a voice behind the sign.
[2:37:46] We've heard the voice. God gave us ears
[2:37:48] to hear. Amen. Praise him. Praise him.
[2:37:54] Hallelujah.
[2:37:55] Oh, we have a
[2:37:59] we have a good reason to shout and sing.
[2:38:02] Amen.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Have you been the recipient of his
[2:38:07] mercy?
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am redeemed. I am redeemed.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[2:38:24] A cry
[2:38:26] Jesus
[2:38:29] my whole life.
[2:38:34] If anybody
[2:38:40] just
[2:38:44] tell them
[2:38:46] I am redeemed.
[2:38:52] Oh, I am redeemed.
[2:39:01] You might
[2:39:13] as you
[2:39:16] just
[2:39:17] I am
[2:39:22] that I am
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; just once more
[2:39:33] and
[2:39:38] that Jesus
[2:39:40] has saved my whole life.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; If anybody
[2:39:50] ask you
[2:39:52] just who I am,
[2:39:56] tell them
[2:39:59] I am free.
[2:40:05] If anybody
[2:40:08] asks you, ask you just who
[2:40:12] I am,
[2:40:14] then tell them
[2:40:17] I am.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; If anybody
[2:40:26] asks you
[2:40:29] just who I am, what do we do? will tell
[2:40:34] them
[2:40:36] I am redeemed.
[2:40:53] All the glory
[2:41:07] Amen.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; Well, this is an atmosphere you don't
[2:41:13] really want to leave.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Our brother Tim Pro is going to be
[2:41:18] preaching tomorrow morning
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; 11:00 our last service here.
[2:41:25] We will not be having a Wednesday
[2:41:27] meeting at the church. We have to move
[2:41:30] all the equipment from here and there's
[2:41:34] many brethren that are leaving on
[2:41:36] Tuesday and Monday and Wednesday and we
[2:41:39] have a very very full schedule for the
[2:41:43] first of the week. So we won't be having
[2:41:44] a Wednesday service. We're getting
[2:41:47] everything back from here. We've had a
[2:41:49] glorious glorious time and it's not over
[2:41:53] yet.
[2:41:56] It's still going on.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends. I I as
[2:42:01] pastor of the local congregation, I'm
[2:42:04] going home this evening filled, full.
[2:42:08] I've just every day just kept my mind on
[2:42:12] on the things of God and just laid down
[2:42:14] and even rest for 20 minutes or 30
[2:42:17] minutes and just want to meditate on
[2:42:20] what God has spoken. Keep it in your
[2:42:23] mind day and night. Do you believe
[2:42:25] that's good advice? Whatsoever things
[2:42:28] are pure, whatsoever things are good,
[2:42:32] think on these things, let's not think
[2:42:34] about the things of the world as little
[2:42:36] as possible.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:40] I can't get away from something. Brother
[2:42:43] Rod, I'm going to need you to help me.
[2:42:47] It's been on my mind since before I came
[2:42:49] to church. And may and may be somebody
[2:42:52] here needs the words of this song. I
[2:42:56] want to sing as a as a declaration in
[2:43:00] the face of the enemy. Somebody here
[2:43:03] probably needs to sing it. And to say
[2:43:05] it, it is well
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; I feel the spirit of God. So I wasn't
[2:43:14] going to do it. I've been I've been
[2:43:16] standing here saying, "Well, the
[2:43:17] meeting's gone on long enough, but I
[2:43:19] feel I must we must do it." Somebody
[2:43:22] here needs it. It is well with my soul.
[2:43:27] When peace like a river attendeth my
[2:43:30] way. Oh, when sorrows like sea billows
[2:43:34] roll, whatever my lot, thou hast taught
[2:43:38] me to say, it is well, it is well with
[2:43:42] my soul.
[2:43:44] All right.
[2:43:48] In peace
[2:43:50] like a river
[2:43:56] my way
[2:44:13] for thou has called
[2:44:16] me to
[2:44:19] It is well
[2:44:25] with my soul.
[2:44:30] It is well
[2:44:36] my soul with my soul.
[2:44:42] is well
[2:44:47] with my soul
[2:44:59] and
[2:45:03] they will
[2:45:06] bless
[2:45:09] to find
[2:45:15] that Christ be
[2:45:21] my
[2:45:29] own
[2:45:43] with my soul. With my soul
[2:45:52] is well
[2:45:54] with my soul.
[2:45:59] Listen to these words. my sin.
[2:46:03] Oh, the blessing
[2:46:11] out
[2:46:15] in my heart
[2:46:25] to the cross
[2:46:28] and
[2:46:30] Ira
[2:46:38] the Lord
[2:46:40] my soul
[2:46:46] is well
[2:46:52] my soul
[2:46:54] my soul Oh,
[2:46:58] well,
[2:47:04] my soul
[2:47:12] is the day
[2:47:14] when my
[2:47:17] shall be
[2:47:23] my people.
[2:47:30] Amen.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; And the Lord
[2:47:40] has
[2:47:49] my soul.
[2:47:55] is well
[2:48:00] with my soul.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; My soul
[2:48:06] is well
[2:48:12] with my soul.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; Look at these words now. Oh my
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; wait
[2:48:29] for the sky.
[2:48:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:48:58] My soul
[2:49:04] is well
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; with my soul
[2:49:12] with my soul.
[2:49:15] It is well
[2:49:21] with my soul.
[2:49:28] It is well
[2:49:34] with my soul.
[2:49:37] With my soul
[2:49:48] with my soul.
[2:49:52] Sing it out again.
[2:49:55] It is well
[2:50:01] with my soul.
[2:50:04] With my soul
[2:50:15] with my soul.
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:24] Glory,
[2:50:26] hallelujah.
[2:50:29] It is well with my soul.
[2:50:36] I want to sing once more if you don't
[2:50:38] mind. My sin
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; not in part
[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; but the whole.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; It's all been nailed
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; to the cross.
[2:50:52] and I bear it
[2:50:55] no more.
[2:50:58] Put that one in the devil's ears. And I
[2:51:01] bear it no more.
[2:51:05] It's not a blessed hope. It's a reality.
[2:51:08] The shout of the angel is not a hope.
[2:51:11] It's a reality.
[2:51:12] Hallelujah. Even the songwriter wrote
[2:51:15] the song for his day, but we're under
[2:51:18] another anointing. Hallelujah. The
[2:51:20] book's been opened. And we've heard the
[2:51:22] voice.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; We've heard the shout. Have you?
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Have you heard the shout?
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; My s
[2:51:40] my
[2:51:43] not
[2:51:46] the
[2:51:51] It's
[2:51:54] the cross.
[2:52:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:52:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:52:07] Oh my soul
[2:52:14] is well.
[2:52:17] Hallelujah.
[2:52:20] My soul
[2:52:22] with my soul.
[2:52:24] It is well.
[2:52:28] It is well
[2:52:31] with my soul.
[2:52:38] Glory.
[2:52:52] I trust
[2:52:54] the song tonight from your soul was
[2:52:57] music to his ears.
[2:53:00] I trust, Lord Jesus, you've been so
[2:53:02] pleased.
[2:53:05] We love your word. We've heard it
[2:53:08] and we believe it.
[2:53:11] going to ask our brother Tom Ray to come
[2:53:13] and
[2:53:16] send us from this place with God's
[2:53:17] blessings and
[2:53:20] to pray specifically that this
[2:53:22] atmosphere will go with you.
[2:53:25] Satan will not be successful to rob it
[2:53:28] from you
[2:53:30] and that you will arise in the morning
[2:53:33] and have a time of alone with God. Be
[2:53:37] here early. The service will begin at
[2:53:39] 11:00 a.m. Our last service for the
[2:53:42] talk.
[2:53:49] Father,
[2:53:54] you're all together lovely.
[2:54:00] Lord, we love your word
[2:54:04] and we love that presence that is in the
[2:54:06] attendance to the word.
[2:54:11] I believe lives have been changed by the
[2:54:14] word.
[2:54:18] As we heard this evening, there's been
[2:54:20] many revivals.
[2:54:24] This is the greatest
[2:54:32] What an invitation
[2:54:34] to this revival
[2:54:38] that God should love sinners such as I
[2:54:42] and turn our sorrow
[2:54:45] into bliss.
[2:54:49] Lord, may we
[2:54:54] continually
[2:54:55] dwell in his glorious presence. Would
[2:54:57] you go with your children tonight?
[2:55:02] Lord, I was just thinking how that
[2:55:06] you came to a prophet. He so often said
[2:55:08] that an angel was sent from the presence
[2:55:12] of God.
[2:55:16] We've had an angel come down tonight.
[2:55:21] The glorious Lord Jesus Christ sent from
[2:55:24] this glorious presence. And I pray Lord
[2:55:27] that you will have a glorious effect
[2:55:30] upon all of our lives.
[2:55:33] We're changed Lord and we are being
[2:55:36] changed from glory into glory and to
[2:55:39] glory.
[2:55:42] Father, it's been unusual and we love
[2:55:45] you for it. I just pray now that you
[2:55:49] will watch over your children as they'll
[2:55:52] go their separate ways. When we arise in
[2:55:55] the morning at the rising of the sun,
[2:55:57] may your presence be close to all of us.
[2:56:00] And Lord, if there should be one last
[2:56:02] service and we should be raptured away,
[2:56:04] Lord, that's what we're waiting for. We
[2:56:07] just pray that you'll anoint your
[2:56:08] servant, our dear brother Tim. We love
[2:56:12] the gift of God within his life. We pray
[2:56:14] you'll anoint him for service. anointing
[2:56:17] us to hear what the spirit would say to
[2:56:19] the church.
[2:56:21] We so appreciate our brother Spencer.
[2:56:25] We so appreciate his life in Christ, the
[2:56:29] gift of God. Would you strengthen the
[2:56:31] man of God tonight?
[2:56:36] Bless your children again. We pray now.
[2:56:39] Go with us in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:56:48] We're dismissing you in the name of the
[2:56:50] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:56:52] Greet one another. God bless you. We'll
[2:56:55] meet you in the morning. Amen.
[2:56:58] Dismissed.
[2:58:44] Heat. Heat.
