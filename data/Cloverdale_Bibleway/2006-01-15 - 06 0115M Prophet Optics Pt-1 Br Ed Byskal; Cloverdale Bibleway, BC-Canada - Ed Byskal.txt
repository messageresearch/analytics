We just have a couple of requests here this morning. and uh we just want to bring them before the throne of grace. There's a testimony. Sister Leverne, she said, "I requested prayer for Paris Tuk, I believe in uh April 2005. A horse had fallen on her and broken her back, totally dislodged her pelvic bone. Um just uh 9 months later she had her second surgery to remove the rods and uh she has had a complete healing and recovery. She asked me to thank the saints for your prayers. Always wonderful to hear someone that's been healed and delivered. We want to remember and I'm going to ask brother John Andy's. Brother John, if you'd come this morning, there's a request that we uh pray for sister Lisa St. John's mother, Sister Jean Watkins. She recently had neck surgery and has lost a lot of blood. The doctors are not sure why. The families asked that we pray this morning. Brother Mark and Sister uh Deborah Lowry have an unspoken request this morning. I know there's a lot of needs in our midst. If you've got a need, just lift it before the Lord. If you're listening in on the internet this morning and you've got a need, you just lift it before the Lord as we come before him this morning. Brother John. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just approach him together. [Music] Hallelujah. Lord, we're standing on holy ground and we know there's angels all around. Ministering spirits have been dispatched to this meeting. Your Holy Spirit is present. &gt;&gt; Your spirit is here. Your your throne is open. &gt;&gt; As far as we understand, the door is still open. As far as we know, there's still blood on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; God, we've gathered around your presence, lifting up holy hands, not because we're holy, but because you have &gt;&gt; desired to live inside of these houses of clay. We lift up our hearts together as a congregation in unity and unison. We look to you. We run into this strong tower, city of refuge. &gt;&gt; We kneel at your feet. &gt;&gt; We feel like the sister in the scripture that when everyone else would not come, they didn't recognize it was you. She came and threw herself at your feet. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said she be to kiss and weeping and under such a spirit of anointing. She was under a spirit of worship. Father, we feel that same atmosphere is in this building. We want to throw ourselves at your feet and cry, "Aba, Father, our father, our husband. Everything that we desire is in you. Our healing is in you, Lord. You are the great physician. You're the one that put this lady's body back together nine months ago when this horse fell on her. Bones put back together, ligaments put back together, muscles put back together. Father, we are your body. You have put us back together, God. Satan thought to crush us, but you have put us back together. Every joint supply, every need supply. We are here for you to do surgery on our lives. Oh God leads among us. Father, Sister Watkins has need there in South Carolina of your touch. Lord, the doctors have tried to put her back together, Lord. But Lord, we know you are the only one that can rightfully do a healing in our bodies. Our families are in need. Congregation is in need. Hands are lifted up. Father, we stand in your presence believing that you're still a God of miracles. You're a God of divine healings. If we can just speak the right word and have the faith, believing all things are possible. Lord, if we can just touch the hymn of your garment, Lord, as you pass by this service this morning, God, I pray that you would visit us especially today, God. unspoken requests, spiritual needs, emotional needs, needs that cannot be spoken out, Lord. But you know the secret of our hearts, Lord. You passed by this generation 40 years ago. You used a man to express yourself. Would you come this morning and express yourself, God? &gt;&gt; You have not changed. Your word is still the same. The pillar of fire is not left. You know the secrets of our hearts. We're a people that has developed under your harvest, son. And we're still listening for the sound of your voice to change these bodies, oh God. And give us a word in due season, the mind of Christ spoken across this altar. Lord, we're judging ourselves this morning. Lord, we know that you closed the door one day in Noah's time and the door was shut. Lord, we don't know when that door is going to be shut. We don't know when mercy is going to end. But I pray this morning you would deal with our souls. Deal with souls of men and women. God, move among us in a special way. Let grace be spoken over this altar. God, over this judgment seat. Let grace be ministered to hearts that are awaiting. &gt;&gt; Bring in lives that are wayward. God, family members that are away. Father, may the token be applied to hearts. God, break us down to nothing. That you would be able to do an eternal work among us. Let us see it happening right here this morning. That you would change lives while we hear your word. that you would break prison bars and go out among us and heal lives that are broken, missing limbs and lives that need a touch. Father, touch us all. Let us respond under your divine presence as it were our last opportunity and we reverence you, Lord. We cherish these moments. We are focused on your presence, believing, Lord, that every syllable and every line, I pray that you would anoint this congregation. Let there be a quickening life among us. Let there be a spirit of liberty and a and a breaking out of your presence. Let us be lost under your shakina glory. That we'd all be under the impact of your nearness. Take control of the minister, our pastor. Lord, let him move in a channel that is so divine that they would so express your heart that we as your people would express deity. also take this meeting under your divine care and reach out Lord into those realms where all things are possible in Jesus name. We thank you for what you're going to do what you're doing already to move our hearts into this place of believing God in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. got some announcements this morning and uh Sister Florence and a group have a song to sing this morning. If they could come and get ready while we're going through these announcements, appreciate it very much. Um first of all, we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. We're just real happy to have each and every one of you here this morning and uh and just uh pray that you'd enjoy the service. Um let's be praying for a pastor as well that God just speak through him. Amen. We have uh some uh additions to the assembly. Brother uh Junald and Sister Alda Juno would like to announce the arrival of their baby boy born January the 10th 2006 at 12:07 a.m. So he's an early riser 5 lb and n this can't be right. 19 o 16 ounces. Oh well he's not too big. We're thankful that mother and baby are doing well. Um, and also, uh, Brother Jason, Sister Sarah Tagert, would like to announce the arrival of their daughter, Tabitha Briala, born on January the 12th, weighing in at 8 lb 2 oz, and they're they're doing well. So, we're thankful for that. Uh, there's going to be a young people's meeting. Brother John Andy's asked me to announce this Friday night, January the 20th, uh here at the church, 7:30 p.m. And although the young people uh been enjoying those with brother John, so let's be praying. Amen. And and remember to come out to that meeting this this Friday, there's a reminder to parents with children in Sunday school. Sunday school starts when?4 to 10. And the reason that uh they're asking me to announce this, I assume, is that some of you are late. So get there on time and uh make sure kids, if you're listening to make sure your parents get out the door on time, don't don't do anything to slow them up. Kids are good at that sometimes. Um and also for parents of this year's graduating class, uh so if you got a child in grade 12 this year and they are graduating uh from high school, um and that means that you're almost certain they're going to graduate. Um, there's a meeting in chapel music room after the evening service tonight. Amen. [Music] I was in prison, locked up in chains. Sin held me captive to sorrow and pain. Years of frustration as love passed me by. Until the master heard my heart's cry for grace, marvelous grace. I needed grace to pardon and make me whole. Grace, marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love. marvelous grace. [Music] I was downhearted. I was broken inside. [Music] Praying for mercy with nowhere to hide. There was a soulless searching for me with grace ever flowing and it set my soul free. It was grace, marvelous grace. I needed grace to pardon and make me whole. Grace. Marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love. Marvelous grace. I am forgiven. [Music] I am redeemed. A brand new creation. He saved me and he gave me a reason to sing. Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleans within grace. Grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sins. [Music] Grace, marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love. Marvelous grace. marvelous grace. &gt;&gt; Marvelous gra marvelous grace. [Applause] Praise God. Thanks, Sister Florence. Brothers and sisters who took the time to learn that song. I want to hear that one again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful for God's grace? &gt;&gt; Amen. The king of this universe. Amen. Looked down and had unmmerited favor on you and on me. Thankful for that. This morning, we're going to be turning to the word now as brother Biscll comes. Let's sing together. Above all powers, above all kings. Amen. You know, the fragrance of the rose doesn't come out until it's crushed. You know, that's when you get the true fragrance. You know, when he was crushed, Amen. and condemned for you and me. Aren't you thankful this morning? Let's stand and sing it this morning. Above all power, [Music] above all, above all nature and all creation, above all wisdom and all the ways of man, You were here before the world began. Above all kingoms, above all thrones, above all wers the world has ever known. above all and treasures on the earth. There's no way to measure behind a soul. You live to die rejected and I like trampled on the ground. Oh, we took the fall and you my behind You die on the ground. You took the fall and you me above all power above all. [Music] You're above all natur and all the ways of man. For you were here before the world ends. Above all the world and above all and trees of the earth there's no way to And you are my Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. I deserve the fall and I meat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] You fall and [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We worship him. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; We love him. &gt;&gt; He loves you. &gt;&gt; That's what's really important. Amen. So happy to be with you this morning and see the church full packed out means you want to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we come here for a divine purpose that's give him praise &gt;&gt; that his name might be praised. I've always been so amazed in the scripture how that people suffered. blind man was blind not because anyone sinned said but so that God could be glorified. So we're here for one purpose that he might be glorified. &gt;&gt; Not that we can get things or you know get our desires met but that he can be glorified. And however he chooses to do that we say praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn to the word uh directly this morning. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Thank you. And uh want to take our time with your patience. I'd like to do that. &gt;&gt; Are we are we in business? All right. Good. Uh I'm not going to finish the subject this morning. So if you feel when I come to the end I I I'm going to I'm going to speak according to a certain amount of time. When I get to the end, if you kind of feel like you're left hanging, you are. There'll be more to come. And uh if if you don't, you know, don't get to the second service, you won't enjoy this one nearly as much. But uh sometimes we need to, you know, lay quite a bit of groundwork. And uh that doesn't mean that it's boring at all. I think all of the word is exciting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read out of Matthew the 13th chapter and going we'll be starting at the 10th verse of chapter 13 Matthew and want to say once again that we are so uh thankful and we so much appreciate all of your prayers uh and the kind words and emails and so on that you have sent our way. I just really really appreciate it. I don't know how to thank you enough just to say that we love you in Christ and uh someday I just pray that God will reward you accordingly. Amen. Appreciate this congregation and what you uh what part you play and everyone plays a part. I wouldn't want you for a moment to think that you sit in this audience and you're obscure and you're not seen and not appreciated and not needed. You are needed and you play an important part. You'll never know until we cross over what part that was, but everyone plays a part. Amen. All right, we'll start to read at the 10th verse. And the disciples came and said unto him, why speakest thou unto them in parables? Now the parable that Jesus had just given them was the famous parable of the swer and the seed. And uh verse 11, and he answered and said unto them, because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. I think we should read that again. And he he they said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" And he answered, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given." You have to really understand God to understand that scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, "By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive. For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed. Lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see &gt;&gt; and have not seen them, and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say we are a blessed people. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow in prayer. Almighty God, gracious and loving heavenly father, we can say this morning, our loving heavenly father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. I pray Lord this morning that as you see this waiting audience here, those that are on the internet, in their rooms, in their buildings, wherever they may be, I pray that the Holy Spirit will surround each individual. Make yourself known to them, Lord. Pray that the word will be quickened. Pray that the speaker will be quickened. Pray that Christ himself will be seen and that he may be the only one glorified. Oh God, you know why we are here to get closer to you. We want to be drawn nearer to you. And so I pray that you will just envelop us somehow, Lord, and draw us into your own bosom, oh God. Make known your will and purpose in our lives, and make us to know the time and the season that we're in. Lord, I pray, Father, you will bless us as we have gathered together in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I have two titles for the service this morning. And uh one that I have been uh I I I've I've had this on in in my notes now for some time and I call it prophet optics and you'll understand it as we as we go through the service but uh I thought to make it more under more understandable to the people uh the subject really will cover looking to the unseen. and the unseen looking to the seen. Going both ways. That means that we humans, we look to the unseen and the invisible God looks to the seen and sees the visible. I want to go into both aspects and I won't manage both this morning but uh it is uh I've been pondering this for quite some time and some of the uh thoughts were actually expressed in brother Mike's service because I was already in that vein and in that channel and I felt that God knew that that I was already in that channel. So I'm not changing anything. There is different kinds of sight in vision. We have sight by our natural eyes which are very limited by the way. Uh we can only see just a certain distance. Uh and what our eyes register to us might not always be accurate. &gt;&gt; You can't believe everything you see. As they say, don't believe everything you hear. You can't believe everything you see either. &gt;&gt; I have fellowshipped with people and they've seen pillars of fire and they've seen doves and they've seen eagles and they've seen all kinds of things, but it didn't register anything on their spiritual life cuz they're out there. I don't know where they are today, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're as lost and in darkness as they can be. So that whatever vision that was that they saw, they saw literal things, but it didn't do a whole lot for them. And then there is there is insight. There's inner sight or insight that we have by understanding. We learn things. We discover things. And then there are those that had sight by inspiration because even before they saw something, inventors, uh, men who rise into such heights of inspiration, they could see something out there, they can't describe it yet. They can't define it yet, but they see it in in in some fashion. They see it out there, and they just know. I guess Alexander Graham Bell just knew somehow that he could achieve some of these inventions that he uh persisted in and even after failure after failure after failure he persisted because he believed that it was possible somehow had some inspiration that reached out there and said this is possible and I'm going to pursue it till somehow I achieve it and uh so we have sight by that uh uh that kind of inspiration and sight by mental comprehension may not be something we fully understand yet but we we have a mental comprehension of of a certain matter certain subject in the message testimony uh brother Brandham telling the testimony of raising the dead boy says where my faith is based is concerning a gift he's speaking of his faith where my faith is based is concern concerning a gift that was given me. Some people receive a revelation. Some people pick it up out of the word. Some people take it by inspiration. But he said, "Mine is in a vision." And so he says, "When I see those visions happen, there's nothing in the world that can change that." Amen. &gt;&gt; His faith was in that vision because he knew it was supernatural and he knew it was from God. &gt;&gt; Now there's people even in the world that have supernatural experiences. Uh it but it may not be it may not be of God. There are supernatural things which are beyond the realm of the natural and it doesn't uh it not necessarily divine or from God. The prophet knew that those visions were from God. &gt;&gt; He could anchor it back in the scripture. &gt;&gt; He knew that there was a message and a messenger to come at this time. So he anchored that back in the scripture and they coordinated together. They linked up and connected together and that gave him a perfect faith in that in that vision. There are also degrees of clarity. Brother, the Lord Jesus prayed for a man and for he was blind and it could he see. He said he saw men as trees. See, and that wasn't enough. And Jesus carried on with him until he could see clear clearly. Now, we have today we've got, you know, in the medical field, they've got the doctor can't see it, but he says, "Well, I'll send you for a CAT scan. I'll send you for an MRI. We'll send you to the to the lab and we'll have some X-rays done, and then they get those negatives and get those pictures and they can see something within your body. There's something there we need to check out." Uh, I had a CAT scan uh when I had the uh the my disc in the my neck herniated and pressed in against the my spinal cord. And so uh sometime later they sent me for a CAT scan. And when I I got the CAT scan, the specialist in uh Vancouver General Hospital looked at it. He said, "Where do you have this done?" So I told him where I had it done. He said, "It's it's good enough for a diagnostic purposes, but it's not good enough for an operation. I wouldn't operate with this with this uh CAT scan." And so he needed something that had greater clarity and it would have to go through another process. I would have to have it again. So there and it's very important when you get to some critical stage that you see things clearly. You don't want to just have some general idea of the message. For example, I believe that God gave us this message so you could see it clearly. It just doesn't have to be something of general information out there. God didn't give it to that. And I would ask you not to be satisfied with some just general understanding when they when when there's a better picture available. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Science has empowered governments in this day to essentially take the privacy away from their subjects. There's big cases about it. They've, you know, generally in a in a military uh arena they are doing well computers first were military you know it wasn't built for us. It was built for military purposes and of course now it's it's such a tool for the public. But they've got such power in vision and their optics today that they essentially can see into your home. And uh uh I I was wanting to show you a little object, but we couldn't quite find it. Brother Randy Snow who works in uh fire prevention technology and he has seen some pretty advanced stuff. And one day I was with him and a couple of other brothers. Brother Roy Florent was there and uh we were in the uh Sheraton Hotel at Guilford and he took a little object out of his I wanted to have that object here today. It was about about that long and about that wide and about that thick. Just shiny shiny stainless steel silver object and had a ring on one side about the size of a quarter. Just a a line in it and a ring on the other side about the size of a dime. He said, "See this?" So we're all looking at it. He said, "This was developed by the United States military." He said, "This object is an optic eye. This eye is in the satellites over your head right at this minute. It is it is for spy work and military and whatever more." He said, "This right now can look through this 17story concrete building and tell you the time on your watch." And those brother's eyes, including mine, got us about that big around. We said well you know uh he said thi this this this thing here now we are using it in the domestic field for fire prevention because it used to be that they had to wait they had sensors that were heat sensors and then when the fire would get that sensor hot it would activate the fire retardant system. But he said now this this object sees the flame and sets it off instantly. And he said on ships and and airports where it's very highly flammable inflammable. He said this is the this is the thing that they use. So it came down from a military purpose down to be used in industry. But I thought if I had this here today, it would help you to see that there are there are things that have sight and have vision can look through this building, can look through concrete building and tell you the time on your watch. Let me say that with the two eyes you have in your head, you don't see very much. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are worlds that are around us &gt;&gt; unseen. &gt;&gt; That even man with his technology has proven that we walk in a very very narrow tunnel of space. &gt;&gt; You don't see very much. And if we walk just by sight, we certainly will not walk by faith. and your faith. God has given an element of faith that can reach far beyond what you see. And as believers, we need to walk where we don't see things. &gt;&gt; We can't walk by sight and really be a full believer. We just can't do it. And I I believe that we're for the most part far too taken up and guided by directed by influenced by what it is that we see. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Now I have a I have a short clip here for you. H I would like uh our brothers to show you. And this starts from about either 10 or 100 million light years into space and takes you to a leaf on a tree in Florida and ends up in such minute detail that it will be uh I just want I want you to see this while you're looking at it. Number one, you you with your naked eye, you don't see the heavens where this is going, and you don't see where it's going to come to. So, we'll just watch it for a moment. 10,000 light years. 1,000 light years. 100 light years. 10 light years. One lightyear. 1 trillion kilometers. 100 billion kilometers. 10 billion kilometers. 1 billion kilometers. 100 million kilometers and 10 million kilometers, 1 million kilometer, 100,000 kilometers. Now you see the Earth, 10,000 kilometers. Now you see Florida 1 th00and kilometers 100 kilometers 10 kilometers 1 kilometer 100 m see the buildings there's the trees 10 m there's some leaves one meter I'll let you go on with it and just watch it a centimeter A millimeter micrometers. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That beautiful. &gt;&gt; And you step on those leaves all the time. There's a world out there in the universe and there's a world right under your feet and you we don't know a thing about it. &gt;&gt; And God made it all. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brothers. &gt;&gt; God made it all. &gt;&gt; That marvelous. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that God made the worlds. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Rod, for sending that to me about three years ago. Every once in a while somebody sends me something says he said I think brother Ed can use that so I just tuck it away. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Faith is a substance of things hoped for, and it is the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report, and through faith we understand that the worlds, plural, were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen are not made of things which do appear. There's whole worlds of this minute world. And fact is we wouldn't put this kind of microscopic evidence on the hamburger you eat from some of the fast food joints or you probably never eat another one. &gt;&gt; You know that's true. &gt;&gt; You're going to think it over today before you ordered that hamburger. Things that you don't see. whole worlds that are out there and God made it all. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are living friends, we are living in such a narrow little tunnel. And if we are only going to be directed and dictated and our mind is just going to be filled with all of these things that are in here, we're going to miss out on what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Our God is great. &gt;&gt; Our God is mighty. &gt;&gt; Our God is eternal. Hallelujah. And we love him for it. &gt;&gt; The things which are unseen. And the scripture says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but the things which are unseen." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now that I have a quote I'd like to show you also, and I don't don't read it faster than I do. And we and we see that Abraham, he was not a young man when this happened. He was an old man, 75 years old, and his wife Sarah, which was his halfsister, and they had been married many, many years since she was a girl of about 17. It's believed. And God told Abraham, "I have chosen you and Sarah that you are going to have a child." And Sarah had been barren all her life. But Abraham never looked at what his eyes would see. An old wrinkled woman many years past the time of life to have children. But he looked at the unseen and he saw Isaac. I want you stop there a moment. He saw Isaac. That's very important. He looked and he saw Isaac by faith. He saw Isaac and uh just trust. Only believe. Technology will bring it all back. I could read it for you, but I want you to see it. He looked at the unseen and he saw Isaac by faith. He saw Isaac. And notice please, and he after looking to the unseen, he called those things which were not as though they were. After he looked to the unseen, but by faith he looked to the unseen. But after he looked to the unseen, he called. In other words, after he looked to the unseen, then he made a confession, and he staggered not at the promise of God, and he called those things which were not as though they were. He got a glimpse of the unseen. By faith he saw it, and the Bible says that he endured as seeing the invisible God with him all along the road. We say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring a very important point here. It didn't say that he looked at the promise. Now, the promise was made. God made the promise. But we we say so often just keep looking at the promise. Looking at the promise, but while we're looking at the promise, we're looking at all the conditions and all the circumstances around us. And we keep quoting the promise like it's brainwashing ourselves. Quote the promise and quote the promise. No. He saw Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw it already finished. He was rejoicing cuz he already had the son. &gt;&gt; He already had him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make make the booties. Get the things ready cuz I see the son. &gt;&gt; I see Isaac on the way. &gt;&gt; It isn't that. He kept just quoting well God said to me. Well, God said to me, "Well, God said to me." And we can get into a pattern. We just say, "Well, it says in the word, ask what you will. Ask what you will. Only believe." And what we are, we're looking at the promise instead of looking to the unseen. We need to look to the unseen and see the thing that you are praying as it's according to the word. You have to know there's a promise for it. But then you look to the unseen and see it finished. &gt;&gt; See it done. That's what God wants you to see. He wants you to see it finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm praying for loved ones. And I decided instead of quoting the just quoting the promise, I'm going to see them here in church. I see them with their hands raised. I see them rejoicing. I see them on the streets of glory because God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; He didn't say he'll honor your quote quote quote quote. He'll honor your faith. &gt;&gt; And faith has sight. Faith sees the finished product. &gt;&gt; Faith sees the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Faith sees it all done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, may we rise up in faith &gt;&gt; and see it as a finished work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's a marvelous principle &gt;&gt; that we certainly need to put into practice &gt;&gt; and hold it there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith sees it finished. So faith indeed is the substance. Now for for us to think that man merely by reading the word of God by simply reading it that we have a perfect understanding of the word. I'd say that is folly. That's a great deception. I say that because if that were so, then all humans with uh uh some level of intelligence could read the scripture and we would not be having churches on every corner because they'd all be believing the same thing. If it was just by human intelligence reading the Bible and say, "Oh, that's what it means." Then we'd all believe the same thing. But that isn't the case because Jesus said, "To you it is given &gt;&gt; and to them it's not given." &gt;&gt; And that's a hard statement to make at times. But the scripture says in 1 Corinthians 1:19, "For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Who is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" I would say just with the little clip we saw coming from a 100 million lighty years out of space or whatever it was to a leaf in Florida, I would say even that would make uh the wisdom of the wise utter foolishness. &gt;&gt; God in his greatness. Who can understand it? &gt;&gt; And that is God. We just addressed him in prayer as our father. Our father made that &gt;&gt; and that is just a that that is such an infotal uh amount of what he's made. We we can't eternity eternity itself is without beginning and without end. I feel sorry for anybody here that has not got in uh eternity as their goal. &gt;&gt; We have eternity. Eternal life is our goal. I was trying to ponder. I prayed this morning said, "Oh God, help me to understand something more about eternity, eternal life, and and what's on the other side." Because I began as I pondered this over the last few weeks, we're living in such a uh such a small, it's just like a tunnel. We have tunnel vision. And and I think it's a real trick of Satan to just get us so engrossed with just our little lives and our little circle to eat up all of our energy, eat up all of our time, eat up all of our whole being, just consume ourselves with something and pass off the scene with actually no testimony and no record when God himself put us here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? put you here for a purpose, to be a witness and to have a testimony for him. And may we say this morning, oh God, let me live here for the divine purpose, the purpose that you have. Otherwise, it's just a exercise of futility. But we're here that we might be an expression of Jesus Christ. He hath hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world. I'll say that the message that we believe and the message that God sent through his prophet messenger is an such utter simplicity that it has made foolish the wisdom of the world. &gt;&gt; Look at the message of the serpent seed. One of the mysteries the message of the serpent seed and the original sin. The host of churches in in the religious world believe in some kind of an apple, believe in some kind of a fruit. And a prophet comes in his simplistic way and says it's nothing short it was a act of adultery and it was a sexual sin. It is a blood sin. Thus, it had to be a blood sacrifice. It was a blood sin. That's why Abraham had to be circumcised as God testifying. And he says, "And that foreskin will be a token to me." Why would that uh embarrassing part of of of a a man's body be a token to God? Cuz God was declaring, "I'm not going to use the human instrumentality to bring my promised son on the scene. I will promise you a son. But that promised son is coming by my word. Not coming by your efforts. Not coming by what you can do. And you circumcise yourself. And that will be a token to me. That'll be a token unto me because this son isn't coming that way. And it all ties together with the original sin. And it has made foolish &gt;&gt; all the apples and all the other fruit and whatever more. And they can't even explain the original sin. God sent a messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and a light that has made this book a new book. Has made it alive. Hallelujah. I say blessed be his name. In the simplicity of the of the message came the revelation of and but to you it is given and to others it's not given. I thank God it was given. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bear with me. Apostle Paul says, "Bear with me in my folly. And indeed, bear with me, for I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband, &gt;&gt; that you may be a chasteed virgin unto Christ, but I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve." Oh my. &gt;&gt; So your mind shall be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the Apostle Paul saying? He's saying in the clearest language that can be said that Eve didn't have one husband &gt;&gt; and she did not come to that one husband chasteed or virgin. And I don't even know why I'm saying this this morning, but that's absolute scripture from Genesis to Revelation. And you can't escape it. And every soul will have to answer to that one day. God sent a confirmed message, a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My friends here, young men, young ladies, brothers and sisters in Christ, if this would be my last message, let me declare to you that God, the unseen that you can't see, has come from the unseen and come down into the visible and confirmed his word with signs and wonders and powers and the fulfillment of the prophecy of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And don't ever stray from it. Hold right fast to it &gt;&gt; and it will open up to more things and more things. You'll see more on down the road than you'll see even today. This God is endless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not coming down to nanometers and fem or whatever it was. We're not coming down inspecting some leaf or some bug. We're going out into the great beyond. Hallelujah. into that great place that God fills all time and space and his children shall be with him. His family shall be with him. You think of God that can do that and show that on just a leaf. You think he had any trouble making us a body, a theophony? Hallelujah. A glorified body. You think that God has any trouble raising up a body out of the grave and changing the atoms or taking the gases of one that has been burned at the stake that God will call it all back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he will not lose one thing that he had purposed in his mind. He will call it all back. &gt;&gt; That's the God I believe in. That's the God I'm preaching this morning. He's the eternal God. He's the creator of heavens and earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the preaching this morning, as simple as it might be, as humble as it might be, in the foolishness of preaching, &gt;&gt; God chose to save those that will be saved. He's got somebody that'll scream out and he's got somebody that he's screaming out for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For I and then the uh and then Job he saw some things. He said, uh, for I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. Let the skin worms eat up my body, digest the material thereof, but yet in my flesh I shall see God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had a he had an understanding. He finally came to a place where he began to see and he said, "Whom I shall see for myself, I shall see him &gt;&gt; and mine eyes shall behold and not another. Though my reigns be consumed within me, &gt;&gt; shall he'll see him." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message, "Show us the father." He said, "Now that's been the cry of the human heart. Through all the ages is to see God. We see him in nature. You can see him in a flower. You can see him in so many. You can see him everywhere." Brother Bram tells the story that little boy asked his Sunday school teacher, I believe it was, he'd like to see God. He said, "No, no one can see God." And the old man, they were in the boat &gt;&gt; and the sun was setting out in the west and the whole sky was painted all the colors that only the creator can paint them. And a little boy said something to him. I may not be telling the story completely, but he just said, "You want to see God?" Teacher said, "Nobody can see God." The old fisherman said, "Son, that's all I've ever seen is God. &gt;&gt; We see him in the mountains. &gt;&gt; We see him in the weather. We see him everywhere. &gt;&gt; We see him in his word. &gt;&gt; We see God and we see him in one another. We see him in his body." And I can tell you that seeing him in his body is a more that's a more accurate view than even seeing him in nature. All kinds of people in the world see him in nature. They see God, they want to identify. They see God in the universe. Of course, even a fool, a fool said in his heart, there is no God. They see him in in the universe. All kinds of people see him in in nature. And a lot of people see him in the various churches, but their vision is not very clear. But then there's got to be a place where you see him in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see God, this God that I'm talking about in his people in such such a variety of ways. He said every man has wanted to know God and to see God. Job wanted to see him. Moses wanted to know who that was in the burning bush. Then he said, "Show me your glory." Moses said he wanted to see some manifestation to know that it was God. And all of us do that. I wonder if you have that cry in your heart this morning. Said all of us do that. We have that cry. We want to know that God. We are. We all long to see something that's real. To see something to prove that God is. You know, we're not here just to come to church and hear some songs and hear a sermon. We're not here for that. Our real purpose down deep in our heart, every person hungers and longs for a God that that is &gt;&gt; present in my situation, in my home, in my family, in my job, in every area of my problems or my concerns. This God is not can't be something that is a god of the past or a god of the future or a god of somewhere else and great things happen back there. They got to happen now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This God is not limited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This God I'm preaching is here at this instant &gt;&gt; and he's here to deliver any bound person that wants to cry out for deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what that bondage is, this God is here now to give sight, spiritual sight. &gt;&gt; If you're blind, and I can tell you there's more blindness in the world than there is sight when it comes spiritually speaking. And if you do have vision, but it's not clear, say, "God, give me clarity of view of vision. Let me see with clarity." &gt;&gt; Don't let it be some cat scan. Don't let there be some MRI that they can't that you can't perform a surgery with. Do whatever is necessary and give me a clear vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If my soul needs an operation or something within my spiritual life, do that for me. &gt;&gt; That God has to be present. And he is present. And I want to see that God doing those kind of things on a regular basis &gt;&gt; in God's people. I don't want to be speaking about a God that just you get enthused with for a moment or a Sunday or from one meeting to the next. But we want to see a God that's working in your lives, working in your daytoday life. Amen. Doing things that you can come to the house of God rejoicing that he has done such marvelous things for you. &gt;&gt; He's great. And the disciples came and said unto him, "Why speakest thou unto them in parables?" The disciples themselves didn't understand the parable. &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; if you read the scripture, they even asked him, &gt;&gt; "What does this mean? And he's told them you understand them. &gt;&gt; Others it's not given but to you it's given but why do you speak to them in parables? And he answered now just put yourself in their place. They're asking their Lord Jesus the master why are you using these parables? Well, because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it's not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. I'd like to just break that down a moment. To whosoever hath, what do you have? If you haven't had that seed of eternal life, it can never be added to. But those that have are predestinated by almighty God, this God who's the invisible God, that you cannot even begin to uh to grasp the scope, you can't even begin to grasp the scope of his of some of the minor and the lowest forms of life. &gt;&gt; We can't grasp it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You know, we get so elevated in our mind, we understand such great things. &gt;&gt; That kind of wisdom is foolishness to God. &gt;&gt; What kind of wisdom is is is is real wisdom to God is wisdom that comes by faith or faith wisdom. &gt;&gt; Faith wisdom, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because it is given to you. And for whosoever hath to him shall be given, he that hath that eternal life seed in him, to him, to her it shall be given, and to him that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. And therefore I speak to them in parables because they seeing they see not and hearing they hear not and neither do they understand. If they don't understand how in the world is a person going to be enlightened. We all have gone to school some a whole lot more than others but we go there to understand. And then we find out that technology advances so fast that what we had is just a boat anchor. &gt;&gt; It's just gone so quickly. &gt;&gt; There isn't there isn't a person there isn't a carpenter here that works the way carpenters do. My father was a carpenter. I saw how he worked. There isn't anybody here. There's not an accountant here that's doing things exactly as they did. There's no one here. Everything is so advanced and we don't want to go back to the old the old system. We might get melancholy when we talk about the old ways, but somehow nobody wants to go back. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to go out here and and get their horse out of the barn and bring it up to and hitch it up and get out in the wagon and drive home in the rain. &gt;&gt; I'd be home in 10 minutes and take you a day or so. &gt;&gt; You want to go back to the old times? No, just in your mind. We'd like to think about it. You kids, you don't know anything about some of these. All you know about is automatic dishwashers and automatic, you know, dryers and and I'm not that ancient, but I have run one of those that went like this washing machine. That's what agitated it for my mom. I run that thing like that. Or you go to get the homogenized milk, you know, but you don't know anything about, you know, going like this for a cream separator. How many know anything about this? Oh my, there's a few more ancients around here. Praise the Lord. We're not all alone. But we don't want to go back there. You want to go back? No, I don't want to go back. I soon just stop at the store and pick up a 2% homogenized. That's the way we are spiritually. I know where I'm going spiritually. Oh, we'll send them. Brother Tony on Wednesday mentioned, you know, being in Bible school, I think four years, and Rebecca about three years. And many others have been there, too. And you go there. Oh, we're going to learn about God. And we're going to come out of here and tell people about God because we it's been handed down and handed down and handed down and handed down and to get all of this all systematic and all of this put together in nice neat packages and even learn exactly how to present it and how you make your entrance into your message and how you reach your peak and then how you come down and how you really uh you know uh uh strike a certain nerve with the people and and how you close and how you get people forward and how you get them to members and all of this is studied and learned and because every organization's interested in membership and they learn about they learn about the original sin and they learn about predestination or they ignore it completely and as ministers that I've called right in this community in this city I've called them asked him about Revelation 17 and one says oh he says stay away from that he says that's dangerous and he's a scholar. He's a learned man. And then you have then you then you have God raised up someone who's got his hints and his canes and can't get the grammar exactly straight and as someone said to me off the radio broadcast uses the English uses the queen's worst English but he said but what he says is the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know the man who wrote the letter, but then he he raises up one and in his utter humility and simplicity says there's a a pillar of fire. And that pillar of fire is none other than the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I'm just your brother. I couldn't do anything. I don't know you, but he knows you. &gt;&gt; But if he will come and then he'll say, "He's here." Who's here? The one that made these, &gt;&gt; the one that knows every secret. &gt;&gt; And then you hear him say, "You couldn't hide anything in your life for me. You couldn't hide anything now if you tried. &gt;&gt; It's all exposed. Why? Because a prophet optics. &gt;&gt; God looking from the unseen to the scene. &gt;&gt; And starts telling the people this is what the situation is exactly. Even the doctors with their medical science, they have said it's this. And you've had one, two, three, four, five operations, but they couldn't find it. And then the prophet optics, God speaking, but it's this. &gt;&gt; Now, any accur any any vision that is that accurate, you better believe one thing. Those kind of optics are the only optics that can look at this and tell you what it is. &gt;&gt; They're the only optics. &gt;&gt; The only thing that has such intensity and clarity that can look at this word of God that has puzzled the world for centuries and centuries since it's been written. It puzzled it because God hid it. And Jesus said these are the mysteries and only that kind of optics is going to understand the mysteries of God. Man with his understanding will get one interpretation, another man another interpretation. Who are we going to believe? I'm going to believe the angel of the Lord. I'm going to believe the pillar of fire. It's not a man that we're believing. It's God that made those things that speaks through the individual. How do we know? because he was he was uh he was strong enough to be able to say the God let the God &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; now come and prove it. &gt;&gt; Let the God who gave the word let the God who spoke the word let him now come and prove that word &gt;&gt; and let him prove what I've said is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus gave a number of parables and I'll I'll going to give you some slides just now. I would like mysteries starting with mysteries of the kingdom please. A mystery. Jesus spoke now a number of mysteries. A mystery is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but in which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation. So many people I've had I've had literally uh thousands of people say I got the revelation and for some it was absolutely true because it proved that they had the revelation because their life remained stable and they continued on. They had a hold of something from the unseen invisible realm. And and a mystery according to the according to the Greek is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed. And when it was spoken, when the prophet messenger spoke it, it was divinely revealed. But there was still a supernatural element that remained despite the revelation. And only God who spoke it, only God who revealed it. Like Jesus, now now just hold it closely, please. Jesus told the parable, and we're going to go into that in a moment. A parable of the swer and the seed. He He spoke it. Now, a parable, as we'll see in a few moments, is something that is a it's an example. It is something that goes parallel. Here's the truth of it and here's here is something now that's being spoken that is to go parallel with it that should that should inform the person of what that is that was spoken. So he spoke of the swer and the seed asked him what is that what does that mean? Well, he said the the the swer is the son of man. The good seed are the children of the kingdom. The world the earth is the world. And he began to tell them what it is. And the seed is the word of God. He began to explain what it was. But there is a divinely a divinely a supernatural element that still remains despite the revelation. And the disciples did not have it at that moment even though he revealed what it was but they came to know what it was. And that's exactly the same as it is with us. Now please if we go to the next one the first mystery Jesus went on and told and if you had a Scullfield Bible Brother Brandham quoted Dr. Scoffield in these first uh first number of of mysteries. The mystery of the kingdom of heaven. That's the one he said we're talking on now. The second mystery was the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age. Romans 11 and 25. And the third mystery was the mystery of the translation of the living saints at the end of this age. Uh 1 Corinthians 15 and so on. And the fourth mystery, the New Testament church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles. And I've given the scriptural references there for you. The fifth mystery is of the church as the bride of Christ out of Ephesians 5:28:32. The sixth mystery is the living Christ, same yesterday, today, and forever. And we have that in Hebrews 13:8 and so on. Now the seventh mystery is of God, even Christ as the incarnate fullness of the Godhead bottle embodied in whom all divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man. The eighth mystery, the mystery of the processes by which godliness is restored to man. And the ninth mystery, the mystery of iniquity found in 1 Thessalonians 2 and 7. Next one, please. The 10th mystery, the seven stars of Revelation 1:20. The seven stars are the seven church ages and the seven messengers and so forth. The 11th mystery is mystery Babylon the prostitute spoken of in Revelation the great harlot 17 revelation 175-7. Now, brother Brandon goes on here at this point. He says that is some of the mysteries that this angel is supposed to wind up those 11. Dr. Scoffield has in in his notes in the Bible. I carry a Scoffield Bible. He says that is some of the mysteries that this angel is supposed to wind up. And may I say this with reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God. Now, brother Brandham is going to go on from here, but he has inserted this. Let me refer to the angel of God. Let me refer to that supernatural element in the ministry. Hallelujah. I can't do that this morning. I am not that prophet messenger. But he could do that. But I can say one thing. I believe what he is saying &gt;&gt; because of the supernatural element, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you stood here on this platform and and had that kind of a record and that kind of a testimony, it would carry some weight. &gt;&gt; If you even spoke something that was strange as he did out of the scripture, but said now and and many out there, uh I'm not pointing to you, but out in the audience at that time couldn't couldn't even believe what he was saying was the truth. But then to have the uh uh the confidence to say let the God who wrote the word, let the God who does the supernatural, if he is God, and if I have spoken the truth, let him come now and confirm that it's true. That one that came was the angel of God. &gt;&gt; And I would say, what would God who cannot honor error? God who cannot stand unbelief. God who knows nothing of telling a lie. What kind of a God would he be coming and confirming all kinds of falsehood &gt;&gt; and false doctrine? Never. &gt;&gt; I say never. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me? &gt;&gt; Never. Not my God. &gt;&gt; My God will only honor the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Will only honor the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how people are theologians and think they know the scripture can say that some a man can stand there and and their god is going to come and confirm error and lead people into false doctrine. I say never. The problem is they don't have clarity of vision. &gt;&gt; We need to have clarity of vision. Friends, we need to be able to see more than we have seen. &gt;&gt; I trust you're not satisfied with where you're at. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I got even saying this little clip. I got such an appreciation. Oh God, you can take me down into a leaf on a tree in Florida and show me all of that. And when you get to the end, there's such marvelous colors and I step on those things. It doesn't mean a thing to me. And here there's whole worlds down there. Oh God, if that is the case on a little leaf, a botany plant, what about the eternal God? What about this right here? What about this eternal God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I deny every falsehood, every false spirit. This word is true and this messenger spoke the truth. &gt;&gt; And my God confirmed it was the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I'm on a war path after the devil today. &gt;&gt; Any spirit that tells you anything else, any spirit that cause you to doubt this word, that is not from God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not referring to myself, but I'm referring to the angel of God." That is in Is this the time, sir? Next slide, please. Now, these are some of the other mysteries. The serpent seed, that's been a hidden mystery all through the years. And I will say that God God made man's wisdom utter foolishness. &gt;&gt; You want to be sit here and believe it was an apple, you go right ahead. &gt;&gt; I say you're a foolish man or a foolish woman &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. That's such utter foolishness &gt;&gt; that somebody ate an apple and plunged the whole world into sin. She defiled the womb. &gt;&gt; And the only reason she was saved is because Adam took her quickly and gave her his seed. &gt;&gt; And God could not destroy her with Adam's seed in her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And look where we were. &gt;&gt; Look at the look at the debauchery and sin we were in. But God, he would have destroyed us. But Jesus Christ came. Hallelujah. And pregnant us with his seed. eternal life seed &gt;&gt; and God can't destroy that seed. &gt;&gt; He can't destroy you &gt;&gt; and made you and him one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a couple more moments. The grace straightened out as brother Tony preached Wednesday. Not disgrace but real true grace. &gt;&gt; No such a thing as an eternal burning hell. Hey, how you going to be in eternal hell without eternal life? And the only eternal life is from God himself. There can be no eternal hell. It might be millions of years as he said. He said it might be for millions of years, but anything that was eternal had never beginning or end and hell was created. Listen friends, that's the scripture. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your religion told you. I don't care what your preacher told you. I don't care what your Bible school told you. I have a prophet that has pointed to the word. And the scripture says that hell was created &gt;&gt; for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; And the devil's not going to be there forever cuz he doesn't have eternal life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And by the foolishness of preaching, God has made foolish the wisdom of the world. I so thank God for the word that we have. Hallelujah. I say praise be to God to all of those that are on internet today. You ought to stand up in your room and say praise be to God for this glorious message that God has given us. Hallelujah. To them it has not been given. To you it has been given. You should say thank you Lord. You gave it to me. You gave it to me. I didn't deserve it. I didn't earn it. I couldn't buy it. You gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the next slide, please. &gt;&gt; The mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation, but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did. and the mystery of water baptism where the extreme tr trinitarianism has brought it into the titles of father, son, and holy ghost. And the mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to conclude there. I know you want to go on, &gt;&gt; but I feel I'll just conclude there. &gt;&gt; There's a lot more, isn't there? I said to my wife, I was going to preach by the watch today. &gt;&gt; If I preach according to your hunger and your appetite, I'd carry on and I' I'd blow my wad. Hallelujah. Let me just look here and see. Maybe I'll just I'll give you just something so you can think on for uh next next service because Jesus was speaking of parables. He said a parable said I speak to them in parables. A parable is a placing of one thing by the sight of another. A parable is a comparison of one thing with another, a likeness, a similitude. And a parable is an example by which a doctrine or precept is illustrated. The placing of one thing beside another. It goes in parallel. It goes in tandem. It goes alongside of it. And there was Jesus himself, the sewer, sewing the seed, the good seed into the earth. It was going right along with what he was doing. So he gave a parable of exactly what was happening. And he revealed it to them, but they didn't they didn't understand it. They didn't comprehend it. There was it was revealed, but there was still a supernatural element that that remained in the revelation of it. Here we have, you know, uh, you that have read the seals and you've lived in the message and you've heard it so many times. I want to say to you, don't don't just sit in a service and don't just read a book through. It's not a paperback book. Don't take the Bible and just read it. Well, I got to read a chapter tonight because I'm I'm going through the Bible. That that's that's whether you're going through the Bible, well, God bless you for it. But that there's more to it. Maybe it's the Holy Spirit wants to speak to you out of John's gospel instead of back in Genesis or someplace. You want to be mindful of the Holy Spirit and the thing that God causes you to ponder. Maybe you heard something in a service today and God will cause you to ponder something and you go home and then a certain scripture come. Don't don't push it away. Go right now and get your concordance and if you got a computer, get there and search it out and go and read it and ponder it. Maybe a certain quote will come. Oh yeah. What message was that? And go and get that and listen to it carefully and ponder it and let the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; give you the supernatural element. &gt;&gt; It's been revealed. &gt;&gt; But there's a supernatural element to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we'll be going on from here in the next service. We have so much more and I want you to have a bit of time out and be rested for this evening's meeting. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet, shall we? I want to sing a little bit and just worship. I'd like to sing a verse or two of Open Mine Eyes &gt;&gt; that I may see glimpses of truth. You able to follow me this morning? &gt;&gt; It's pretty simple, pretty elementary. &gt;&gt; You like the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. Open mine eyes that I may see. Glimpses of truth thou has for me. Placing my hand to that wonder that shall last and set me free. Silently now I wait for thee. Ready my God I will to see. Open my eyes and see. [Music] Oh my voices of truth. And while the angels fall my ear, everything else will silently now I wait for thee. My God, I will sing. Open my eyes. [Music] Open my mouth and let me gladly truth everywhere. Open my heart and let me prepare love with my children [Music] to share. Silently I wait for thee. Ready my God I will to see. Open my eyes to you and me at this place junction in the service. [Music] I believe there are those here that need to say, "Open my heart. open my heart that I may, you may not have agreed with everything I said today. But you need to say, "Open my heart &gt;&gt; not to me, but to God that confirmed the word." &gt;&gt; Because friends, I can say I can say with a great deal of feeling this morning, you're just passing through this little short life. And it could be very brief. Sister Biscll and myself got in the car this morning and we started to drive. [Music] And of course, we're so mindful of the loss of our son-in-law said only two weeks ago, they stepped into a car and and within two hours the whole scene had changed. within 2 hours someone was on the other side and you have no guarantee that you'll even see this evening. You have no guarantee. And you say, "Well, you know those things. We've heard those things before." Listen, I'll tell you one thing in the authority of God's word. You're only living here once. And I don't care whether you live 5 minutes or 50 years. Every one of those we give an account for before God. how we live it. And the scripture says that and we'll give an account for what God has given us. God has given us an opportunity this morning to open our heart and let the divine Holy Spirit come in and take absolute control. We've been given an opportunity time after time in meetings and I know there are those that need to perhaps surrender their lives. Those that need to be delivered from habits of life, those that need to uh let loose of their own their own mind, their own thoughts and whatever it is, whatever it is, we have no we have no excuse in this kind of an atmosphere to live at something below what God has for us. And we need to open our heart and say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; give me the strength. &gt;&gt; Give me the stamina. Give me the insight. Let me see life for what it is. Let me see my life for what it is. Let me see eternity. Let me peer into that realm. Oh God, let me be moved &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord. Let me be moved by the Holy Ghost. Let me be moved when I have this opportunity." People say, "I'll have it next week." You may not. And there's a good chance you won't because God gives you this opportunity and he's not obliged to give us at our time. &gt;&gt; This is his time. Today is the day of salvation. Today is the day when God is speaking. And I want to seize upon that opportunity. I'm sure this congregation will agree with me. This world is getting darker and darker and more deceptive all the time. Is it not? It's becoming more corrupted. &gt;&gt; I say thank God &gt;&gt; for a word that's an anchor &gt;&gt; to the soul. Thank God for a message that is made that has made foolish the wisdom of man. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you'll see where I'm going to be going in another verse and another part of this message. What does God see? I don't really want to say this because I start off in uh my next message. But the first place that the Bible says, "And God looked and God looked, he looked upon the earth &gt;&gt; and the Bible says and it was corrupted. says, "God saw and everything was good. Everything was very good cuz he'd made a little bit of what you saw in the clip and God saw. But then one day and God looked and the earth was corrupted." There's another phrase that we want to love and hold very dear. When I see the blood, &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can say, "Where is that blood today?" &gt;&gt; Where is it? &gt;&gt; It's not back on Calvary. It's not on a wooden cross. It's not even on the ground. &gt;&gt; That blood is in his word. &gt;&gt; When I see the blood, &gt;&gt; remember before it was blood on a doorpost. It was a spoken word. The blood was only the evidence of what was spoken. And when they heard the word and did what the word said, then God saw that it wasn't just the paint that was on the post. He saw that there was a people obedient to his word. I said, God sent his message, a vindicated messenger, and it is today the bleeding word. The bleeding word. And when I see that, &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God. Glory be to God. When I see that, I'll pass over you. Make sure you have that &gt;&gt; and I'll pass over you." &gt;&gt; Christ my redeemer. 24:51. And we're going to close. Christ my redeemer died on the cross died for the sinner paid all his dash [Music] [Applause] will pass for You are sing for you [Music] Jesus. Jesus will say all your promises will he [Applause] [Music] for you. Heat. Heat. I pass [Music] [Applause] [Music] all each one through hide in the saving blood and I will pass will pass for Heat. Heat. When I see the pass, I will pass for you. When I sat on a log, I stand as a testimony and looked in the eyes of that prophet, precious brother Brandham. And all he said was, [Music] I believe you have three questions. Said he came to me this afternoon. I believe you have three questions. Before he opened his mouth, I knew I was so exposed. And the thought that passed through my mind, and I'll never never forget it, to my dying day. There is nothing I can hide. I am naked from my earliest memory of anything in my life. I'm naked. I stand in his presence naked. I'm glad he didn't start saying, &gt;&gt; "I see you when you're in sin. I see you going to the hunts. I see you going to places. I see you thinking things you shouldn't think. &gt;&gt; I see you doing all of this wicked things. But when it came under the optics of the prophet messenger, you have three questions. He asked three questions on baptism and on the godhead and on the serpent seed and then went into the scripture and those prophet optics went from my heart into the word of God and answered all of those questions. I say my brother, sister, a God that can take a leaf and come from a 100 million light years and come down until that leaf that isn't little insignificant just minute microscopic little things and all of the color that's there. I'm glad that that God can look down into our heart and take all the layers away and peel all of that aside. And my brother, my sister, he's not examining. He's looking at the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bleeding word. &gt;&gt; And even when we didn't know how to believe it, he saw the desire and the call of God said, "Blessed are you. It's given to you &gt;&gt; to understand the mysteries of the kingdom." &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love him. &gt;&gt; How we love him today. I just love him with everything that's in my heart, friends. So glad. Oh great compassion. And we're going to close. [Applause] [Music] I [Music] for you when I see the blood when I see the blood. I will pass. I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; We just want to please you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want to please you with all that is in our hearts. I am coming, Lord Jesus, asking in your name. You the one who uttered these words, they were scribed in the scripture by Matthew and you told the many parables of the kingdom of heaven. Oh God, let the supernatural element come to us at the people. We are the children of this end age. There's not going to be another one. &gt;&gt; Not another message. There will not be another message like this ever. You said, "Oh God, you'll send these seven, the eyes of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh, how you've looked down, Father, into the innermost region of our hearts. &gt;&gt; And Lord, the day came when we had a sense of conviction and we surrendered our lives. And now today, we pray that you'll give us spiritual insight, spiritual understanding. and I'm burdened. Lord, I'm praying for those that are standing here that are in need. Don't let them walk out of here in need. Don't let them walk out of here bound. Don't let them walk out of here in a confusion or in darkness. I pray that you will give such insight, Lord, and give them courage to surrender now. Say, Lord, I give you myself and all that I am. the name of Jesus Christ. I pray, Father, that as the people leave the sanctuary or as they remain before you in prayer, I pray that you will continue whether they leave or whether they stay. I pray that you will continue by the Holy Ghost to indelibly mark and brand their souls with the truth of your word. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it. [Music] Amen. I'd like to just sing with you before you go. Pleasing. Pleasing. I want our life to be pleasing. Pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. Let everything that I do, oh God, you praise. [Music] and everything I pursue to you. And let's be praying for one another as we sing it once again and shake hands. Please, please, let me be pleasing to you. [Music] Let everything that I do be pleasing to you. I pray for you. Pray. [Music] Let everything I pursue be pleasing. Lord to you. &gt;&gt; You're all dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you're in need of prayer, you can come. There's brethren here to pray with you. Don't leave here bound, hindered, fettered. God will meet you here. Brother Tom, could you please Brother Tony? Brother, yes. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. [Music] Christmas. [Music] Hallelujah. All my God is present in the house. Amen. [Music] Good morning.
