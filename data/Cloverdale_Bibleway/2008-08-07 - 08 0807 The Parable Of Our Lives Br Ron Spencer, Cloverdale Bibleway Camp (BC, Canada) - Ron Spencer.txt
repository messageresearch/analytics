TRANSCRIPT
========================================
have never been. camp on this. We had camp here seven years, but it's quite a few years ago. And how many of the campers that are here now that never have been on this camp? Never been here on this camp. I want you to stand up. Never been in the camp. It's their first time in the camp. All right. Wonderful. Wonderful. I wonder uh you can sit down. And how many adults here, how many have been here and have come here as campers? You have been campers here. You've grown up. Now you're not allowed to come anymore, but you try to do everything you can. You say, "Can I be a counselor? Can I work in the kitchen? Can I wash dishes? Can I sweep floors? Can I put up the tent? Can I do anything, please, but just let me come to the camp?" Uh, and you you've you've used all those tactics and we've let all kinds of you come. So, how many have come here to the camp and now you're adults and but you you have been here in this camp. Let's have you stand. Look at all these old people stand. Well, that's wonderful, too. And there's a lot that haven't been here at all. Well, I tell you that. That's wonderful. Well, we're in for a great time. We're ready here to hear the word of God. And thank you all for coming. And thank you for those of you that have been praying. You prayed. God has heard. And now we're going to begin receiving some answers. You believe that? Is that wonderful? Uh I I'd like to just maybe have you stand and sing uh brother. I'd like to sing born again. All because of me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. born again. There's really been a change in me. Born again just like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lift it up to him now. born again because of Calary. I'm glad so glad that I' been &gt;&gt; I've been born again. There's really been a change in me. Born again just like Jesus said. Born again and all because of Calary. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad so glad that I've been born again. you love the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; I am grateful to be here. Thank you for the applause to the Lord. And we just know that it's absolutely supernatural that I'm just able to be here this year. And uh when I was asked to come to the camp, I was in a coma. That's right. &gt;&gt; The doctors were saying something completely different than what brother Ed was saying and what God was saying. &gt;&gt; They were saying I was going to die and he was saying I was going to live &gt;&gt; and not only live but I would stand here tonight. by the resurrection power of Jesus Christ. I'm so happy to have my family with me, my mother and my father and and my my children. It just it just you just don't hardly believe how how almost my heart wants to just explode to to have them with me. And so we're so thrilled to be here and such a warm reception and we love you with all of our hearts and and we're looking forward as well to what God would do in these meetings for them, &gt;&gt; for myself and for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray just now. Lord Jesus, we know just to step to this pull pit tonight was saw by God. Last July when I stood and I preached that Satan couldn't touch a hair of my head &gt;&gt; until he first got permission from my father. Little did we know that this last year would take us through a dark, dark valley. But in the midst of it, you showed us a glimmer of light and it was whispered into my ears even in a coma that I would be speaking this meeting. And Lord Jesus, I thank you for this day. I'm almost overwhelmed within my own being. I'm trembling, not from nerves, but from the power of the Holy Spirit. And Lord, I pray that that would be conveyed into words tonight. May you use this oracle tonight and may as this week progresses, Father, may you give us a temporary resurrection through which that you would speak through us. Lord, you see the hungry hearts tonight and you see souls that are imbalances and you see where they are just now. I pray that you would bless Brother Ed and Brother Tom and all the ministries of this congregation, every worker. You see every minute that they labored to bring this camp together. Lord, you see all the days and the hours and the months that they've worked. Lord, that might been looked over by many, but you have not looked over it. And you're a rewarder. And I pray that tonight that you would speak to our hearts. And may we step into heavenly places just now. May you come and help us tonight. And may we be fully aware that you're the one that speaks. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And amen. If you will turn with me into your scriptures this afternoon to Psalms 139. I would like to thank brother Ed for this wonderful invitation and brother Tom all the other ministries here. So glad to have sister Connie. Amen. I appreciate your prayers for her as well. I slept through the whole trauma and she prayed through the whole trauma. Amen. David is pouring his heart out to God. Oh Lord, thou searches hast search me and known me. Thou knowest my downsings and my uprising. Thou understandest my thought a far off. Thou compasseth my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all of my ways, and there is not a word in my tongue. But, oh L, oh Lord, thou knowest it all together. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high, and I cannot attain unto it. Whether shall I go from thy spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into the mount into the heavens, thou art there. And if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. And if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. And if I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall the light be about me. Yay, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day, and the darkness the light are both a light to thee. For thou possesseth my reigns. Thou hast covered me in thy mother's womb. And I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance is not hid from thee. And when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect, and in and in thy book are all my members were written, which is continuence were fashioned. When as yet there was none of them. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them, and if I should count them, they are more in number than in sand. When I awake, I am still with thee. You may be seated this evening. I would like to start out tonight and and just kind of draw you into to some thoughts that the Lord has just laid on my heart. I would like to look at the parable of our lives and and I would just I would like to I would like to take it in two different directions. First of all, and I I I actually actually actually planned to get away from Brother Ed for a couple of days. He didn't know it. But I when I asked him coming from the airport the other day, I we were just talking and and I said, "What did you preach Sunday?" And he said, "I preached on the book of life and the Lamb's book of life." And I thought, "Oh Lord, how can I follow that?" And here I am standing tonight and I'm going to discuss our book of life and our lamb's book of life. But it only allowed me to let me know that God is in complete control of everything. &gt;&gt; When we begin to look at a great patriarch like David and and the book of Hebrews and we begin to look at these men, sometimes we look at him when we think within ourselves, we think there's no way that we can compare to them. And we realize very quickly that every one of them were were human beings just like you and I. And we realize that we came and every person that comes upon the earth is their names is in the book of life. And and we realize that every person that ever breathes, they go in there and as a record begins and their their life begins and and they begin to go through some things of their life and they don't understand. Brother Brandham makes some statements. He said, "Maybe you just staggered into a meeting and you know," he said, "but it wasn't it wasn't by accident that God brought you here." And he begins to tell you that you were pre-planned by God. &gt;&gt; And your names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Just a couple of statements that you're very familiar with. Brother Bram says that God took a picture of you at your best before the foundation of the world. And and we know that God had us on his mind. And he begins to project us and and he begins to look for us and he knows the way that we're going to come from it. And David begins to be very honest in Psalms 139. And he begins to realize that God is an omnipotent God. God is an all knowing God. and he realizes that no matter what he does, he cannot cover himself up. He has a lot of weaknesses. He has a lot of dark places in his life. He's been through a lot of valleys in his life. And he realizes, God, when I was in the valleys, thou art there. &gt;&gt; When I was having extremely great places in my life, thou was there. &gt;&gt; And he realizes that even while I when I was made in wrought in secret that was there. Brother Brandham says this in why Christ speak. He said he said that's the reason the very purpose that Jesus came here to the earth was to serve those that God through his fornowledge seen and he wanted to be saved. He said because the whole earth was condemned and he said I don't know how that we could teach it any other way than to than the fornowledge of God. And the Bible plainly says that he knows the end from the beginning and could tell it. And he says, "Therefore, when a person tries to be something that they're not," he says they're only making an impersonation and sooner or later you'll find it out. &gt;&gt; And he says, he says, "And your sins finds you out." So, we're realizing brother Brandham is beginning to make these statements and they don't sound very complex, but if we could only catch them and if really we're only trying to be an actor, God knows. &gt;&gt; And if we're only impersonate something, God knows. And if we're only going to church and we're running through the meal, GOD KNOWS THAT. BUT GOD ALSO KNOWS where you're living at. &gt;&gt; He knows where you're living at. He's very strategic. He's very accurate. He was very in this end time, he was very strategic and accurate to tell people exactly where they lived, exactly what their address was, exactly what their conditions was. &gt;&gt; Backsliding, WANTING A REVIVAL IN THEIR CHURCH, the condition, the doctors, THE AFFLICTIONS. GOD KNEW ALL of that, but he was only letting his people know. I know that. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. AND HE SAID, "THEREFORE, a tr a person that they're not. They're only making an impersonation and sooner or later you'll find it out. YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT. YOU CANNOT COVER THEM." He says, "And there's only one covering FOR SIN AND THAT'S THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S NOT AN OLD STORY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A FAMILIAR STORY. THAT'S AN UPTO-DATE STORY TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says, "And it cannot be applied unless GOD HAS CALLED YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION of the world." &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother, I want to be a Christian. I want to do this and I want to do this." No man can come to him EXCEPT THE SPIRIT OF GOD DRAWS him first. &gt;&gt; And listen, JUST TO FEEL THE TUG OF GOD ON YOUR HEART. THIS, LISTEN, IS A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, I I FELT GOD COME." THAT'S A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; THAT WITHIN ITSELF IS A MIRACLE. And never overlook THAT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S BILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE EARTH THAT GOD NEVER TUGS ON THEIR HEARTS, &gt;&gt; better jobs, better education, bigger churches. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; COMPLEX MINDS ANOINTED. THEY CAN SING, they can preach, THEY CAN DO ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS. BUT GOD CALLED YOU. &gt;&gt; And never overlook that. NEVER ALLOW THAT TO BECOME COMMON TO YOU. GOD GOD CALLED YOU. &gt;&gt; Watch this statement. He said, he said, "Now Abraham, we find out, he didn't appear until about the 12th chapter of Genesis, 11th chapter." He said, "We find out his father came from Babylon." And Abraham was just an ordinary man. He says as you and I or anyone else. And he was gathering, he said, getting rather we would think an age man. He was 75 years old and he had a he married his half sister. Her name was Sarah. And he said his name then of course wasn't Abraham. He was Abram and hers was Sarah. So we find out it was 10 years younger. And he says which made her 65 and and him 75 YEARS OLD. HE WAS PROBABLY a farmer and he lived in the valley of Shinar there and he lived an ordinary life and he probably WENT OUT IN THE DAYTIME and got his meat from the bush and he picked berries and and he lived that SORT OF LIFE. HE WAS JUST AN ORDINARY MAN. &gt;&gt; And he SAID THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL about him AND HE SAID BUT ONE DAY GOD CALLED HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND SAID OH THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL OUT ABOUT YOU. I WAS ON THE PLANE WITH A BUNCH OF PROFESSIONAL ball players the other day and you know men ran up to him and you KNOW AND SHOOK THEIR HAND CALLED THEIR NAMES. I didn't know him. I SAT BESIDE OF ONE OF THEM ON THE PLANE. I DIDN'T KNOW HIM. HE'S PROFESSIONAL BALL PLAYER. HE WAS PLAY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING TO THE ALL-STAR GAME AND you know and all of these different kind of things. HE WAS EXCITED. EVERYBODY AROUND ME WAS EXCITED BECAUSE HE WAS THERE. BUT I WAS JUST AN ORDINARY MAN &gt;&gt; AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GIFTED TO PLAY BALL. HE WAS GIFTED TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. MY SON BACK HERE WON THAT ONE TIME PLAYED BALL. AND YOU KNOW, HE WAS A VERY SPECIAL ATHLETE. HE WAS HE WAS AN ALL STATE ATHLETE back here. Thank God he was that cuz he dragged me out of the fire here a while back. &gt;&gt; But anyway, ANYWAY, ONE DAY, ALL OF THAT SPECIAL FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WAS A PHASE OF HIS LIFE. BUT ONE day &gt;&gt; in A MEETING LIKE THIS, GOD CAME. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, THAT'S YOUR SON." LISTEN, BEING MY SON DIDN'T GIVE HIM SAVED. &gt;&gt; That didn't get him saved. DIDN'T GET HIM THE HOLY GHOST. HE HAS TO GET IT THE SAME WAY I'VE GOT TO GET IT. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to polish it up and we want to simonize it a little bit and we want to we want to say we've got to go through a church ritual. We got to read certain books and we got to do this kind of thing and we want to make it easy on our children. But I got news for you. To get A NEW BIRTH, YOU'VE GOT TO STRUGGLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO DIE OUT TO TO THE LORD. YOU'VE GOT TO TOTALLY SURRENDER. AND I KNEW THAT HE HAD TO COME TO THAT PLACE IN HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD DON'T FORCE nothing on you. And as a parent, I DIDN'T FORCE NOTHING ON HIM. BUT I KNEW IF I JUST KEPT WATERING, &gt;&gt; if I just kept HIM IN THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE, &gt;&gt; ONE DAY THEY WOULD COME TO AN ALTAR SUCH AS THIS AND RECEIVE GOD AND MEET THAT SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT I'M AT. It was in a service much like this when he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. A few days later, he walked into my office. He sat down and he seemed to be a little troubled. He looked across and colleges were calling and they were writing, they were wanting, they were projecting a lot of things. And he looked over and he said, "It's over. IT'S ALL OVER. &gt;&gt; I PUT MY HELMET ON THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; I sacked my last quarterback. &gt;&gt; Why? God came. &gt;&gt; God came. &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST A TEACHING, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A FEELING, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME. &gt;&gt; I trust you believe in that. He says, he says, "And God," HE SAID, "PROBABLY a farmer." HE SAID, "BUT ONE DAY GOD CALLED HIM." And he said, "That makes the difference." Brother Ram says, "There's a major difference between a being a Christian and a Holy Ghost fililled Christian." &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN GOD MAKES THE CALL, THAT'S THE WAY IT TAKES. IT TAKES GOD." It isn't what you do, IT'S WHAT GOD DOES. YOU SAY, "I SOUGHT GOD. I SOUGHT GOD." YOU'RE MISTAKEN. NO MAN SEEKS GOD. IT'S GOD THAT SEEKS MAN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT'S NOT BY AN ACCIDENT. YOU'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; GOD SAW THIS CAMP. &gt;&gt; HE SAW THE ORCHESTRATION OF THIS MOMENT. Maybe you labored hard. Maybe you gave monies that you FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE. BUT LISTEN, THE ETERNAL THING IS WHEN GOD BEGINS TO DRAW HIS CHILDREN TOGETHER AND HE COMES ON TO LISTEN, THERE'S BILLION DOLLAR BUILDINGS AND MILLION DOLLAR BUILDINGS THAT ARE BUILT THAT GOD DOESN'T EVEN ATTEND. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WANTED A TENT TO BE SET ON THIS PROPERTY &gt;&gt; THAT HE COULD GATHER HIS CHILDREN AND HE NOT ONLY GATHER THEM TOGETHER, BUT OUR GOD COULD COME DOWN IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING AND HE COULD MEET YOU. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT IT JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT, JUST FOR A MOMENT. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL WHISPERS in your ear, NO MATTER HE WHAT HE TELLS YOU, YOU NEED TO BE LIKE THE WORLD, YOU NEED TO COMPROMISE WITH THE WORLD. LISTEN, IT IS A SPECIAL PLACE THAT GOD WOULD CALL YOU TO THIS NIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And he said, he said, "So you're chose before the foundation of the world or you wasn't even chose at all." He said, "Your names," he says he just came to redeem that name. And all whose names were not in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world is only going to be there anyway. He said, "You were chosen him before the foundation of the world." When the lamb was chosen, HE SAID, "THEN YOU WERE CHOSEN WITH HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD." AS I SAID LAST NIGHT, YOU'RE AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD'S THINKING. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN BE ETERNAL AND HAVE AN ETERNAL LIFE. THERE'S ONLY ONE FORM OF ETERNAL LIFE, AND THAT'S IN GOD. SO IF GOD THOUGHT OF me being here &gt;&gt; and this tent BEING HERE AND THESE PEOPLE BEING HERE, &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE THOUGHT YOU BEING HERE. &gt;&gt; Are you with me just now? &gt;&gt; Now I want you to just notice David no doubt Abram no doubt looked at themselves as an ordinary man. No doubt when he be God be to talk to him, he he thought within his own mind, there's no way there's no way that I can have children. As a matter of fact, the scripture tells us when God speaks to him, he literally rolled on the ground and laughed in the presence of God. AND YOU KNOW, NO DOUBT, YOU KNOW, AS many of us would not want this to be done, no doubt when maybe the biography of his life is written and Moses is writing out his life, if he could look over Moses's shoulder and he could look over his shoulder and he's watching, maybe if he could watch Moses right, no doubt, thank you, brother. No doubt HE WOULD SAY, "PLEASE DON'T WRITE THAT. &gt;&gt; Please don't write that. And you know THE INSPIRATION THAT YOU KNOW A MAN IS LED BY THE INSPIRATION OF GOD AND HE'S AND HE'S WRITING OUT AND HE'S AND HE GOD IS WRITING AND HE'S HE'S BEGINNING TO WRITE AND HE'S beginning to write about Abram and and he said Abram begin TO WALK WITH GOD AND THIS GOD SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND THEY now Abram I'm not going to call you Abram no more BECAUSE YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT PRODUCE THE PROMISE OF GOD AS THE MAN ABRAM. AND HE SAYS, "I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME." &gt;&gt; AND SO HE PUTS HIMSELF, JEHOVAH PUTS HIMSELF INSIDE OF ABRAM'S NAME, and now he's called Abraham. &gt;&gt; AND HE REALIZES THAT SARAH BEING A DOMINATING FEMALE. &gt;&gt; HE REALIZES THAT IN HER NATURE, she can't produce the word of God &gt;&gt; because they've been together all these years and they've never been able to produce it in that way. AND YOU SAY, "BROTHER, HOW IN THE WORLD CAN I MAKE A RAPTURE? YOU CAN'T IN YOUR ORIGINAL BIRTH." &gt;&gt; And you SIT AND YOU RRESTLE AND YOU AND MAYBE you're in even in a spot of maybe just kind of on THE OUTSIDE FRINGE LOOKING IN AND YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THESE PEOPLE AND I CAN'T GO TO CHURCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE AND AND I CAN'T LIVE A LIFE WHAT like what people are talking about. I've been raised IN THE MESSAGE, BUT I CAN'T LIVE IT LIKE MOM AND DAD. I I GO TO CHURCH AND I JUST DON'T GET ANYTHING." WELL, THAT ONLY LETS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY MET GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, GOD IS CALLING YOU. &gt;&gt; JUST YOUR BEING HERE HAS REPRESENTED THAT THERE'S A CALLING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I'VE GOT ISSUES." ABRAHAM HAD ISSUES. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE BOOKS AND THEY HAVE STORIES ABOUT THEIR ISSUES IN THEIR LIFE. People want to blame their parents. THEY WANT TO BLAME THE SCHOOLS. THEY WANT TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT. THEY WANT TO BLAME EVERYBODY ELSE BUT THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST ENEMY THAT YOU HAVE IS YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THE GREATEST OVERCOMING THAT YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE, IT'S OVERCOME YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM REALIZED AS ABRAM, HE WAS A LIAR. &gt;&gt; He run from pressure. &gt;&gt; HE RAN TO GREER. PRESSURE CAME DOWN CUZ YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE. Pressure came down. He said she's my sister. Please don't write that. Please don't write that. I'm sure when he was writing, MOSES IS EVEN WRITING ABOUT himself &gt;&gt; and GOD WAS SAYING, "TELL THEM YOU HAVE A TEMPER. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME WRITE THAT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I got news for you. GOD LOVED YOU WHILE YOU WERE YET A SINNER. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE DAVID HAS SOME TIMES IN HIS LIFE THAT HE WISHES THAT IN THE BOOK OF LIFE WASN'T written there. &gt;&gt; THERE'S AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? &gt;&gt; THERE'S A MURDER OF A MAN. THERE'S A MAN RUNNING FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A CAVE. &gt;&gt; HE'S FEIGNING HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF GOLIATH CITY. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE THAT I'M SURE THERE'S SPOTS IN HIS LIFE, PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE DON'T. YOU'RE THE SAME WAY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'D BE HONEST TONIGHT, THERE'S BEEN SOME REAL SPOTS. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, this is not for me." I got news for you. If you've been a Christian 70 years, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STILL THANKFUL &gt;&gt; THAT HE TOOK OUR TOOK OUR OLD UNION, &gt;&gt; INVISIBLE UNION OF THE BRIDE. HE TOOK OUR OLD UNION, &gt;&gt; OUR FIRST NATURE, OUR OLD DESIRES. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THOSE DESIRES AND HE PUT THEM IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU AT ONE TIME HAD A DESIRE FOR THE WORLD. HAD A DESIRE FOR THE WORLD'S MUSIC. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to hide that side of ourselves. Jesus turns around to Simon and he said,"Simon, SATAN HATH DESIRED TO SIFT YOU. &gt;&gt; You're in Leosa tonight and I have news for you. You are going to produce something &gt;&gt; and you are at war. &gt;&gt; You're at war. YOU HAVE AN ENEMY AGAINST YOU. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T PLAY HIS HALFWAY GAME. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT EVEN A good negotiator. Oh, brother Ron, I just I WANT TO HE WILL BEGIN TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH without a birth. You don't have to have the HOLY SPIRIT. YOU CAN JUST HAVE AN EDUCATION. THAT KIND OF THING wants to creep right in the message. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE LONG, WE GET AN intellectual experience &gt;&gt; AND WE SIT RIGHT THERE. OH, WE GET THE DRESS RIGHT AND WE GET THE WE GET THE TIE RIGHT. WE GET OUR HAIR RIGHT AND WE GET EXACTLY RIGHT WITH OUR SHOES. BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE DIDN'T GET THE LIFE. AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; ABRAM COULD NOT PRODUCE THE PROMISE WITHOUT THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Well, I want to be like this one and I want to be like this one and I want to BE LIKE THIS ONE. AND I LOOK AT A STRONG ONE IN THE CHURCH AND I WANT TO BE LIKE THEM. I GOT NEWS for you. Without Christ, &gt;&gt; they were a stinker. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT CHRIST, I WAS A STINKER. &gt;&gt; AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO THERE. BUT GOD TOOK MY BOOK. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT BOOK. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT DRUG ADDICT BOOK. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT ADDICTION BOOK. AND HE WASHED IT WITH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AND IT'S NOT EVEN THERE ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; GOD SO JUSTIFIES YOU UNTIL IT'S AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. MANY PEOPLE SIT AND LISTEN THAT THE DEVIL BEAT THEM IN THEIR MEMORY CHANNEL AND THEIR IMAGINATION CHANNEL AND THEIR AFFECTION CHANNEL &gt;&gt; AND HE WARS WITH THEM AND HE REMINDS THEM OF YESTERDAYS OR WHAT COULD BE OR THE WHATIFS OF LIFE OR THE PEER PRESSURE OF LIFE AND TELLS YOU YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING THIS AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING THAT AND THEY'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION BUT WE'RE NOT CALLED TO THIS WORLD. THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. I'M JUST A PASSING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; They seem like they're having JUST SUCH A GOOD TIME. THIS IS THE only heaven they'll ever have. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THIS IS THE ONLY HEAVEN THEY'LL EVER HAVE. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, I WANT TO JUST GO TELL THEM THEY'RE GOING TO HELL. THIS IS THE ONLY HEAVEN THEY'LL EVER HAVE. YOU WERE CALLED BECAUSE THE SEED IN YOU THAT WAS PUT THERE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THERE WAS A DEEP THAT COULD RESPOND TO THE DEEP. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD DIDN'T SATISFY YOU. &gt;&gt; They look at you strange. &gt;&gt; They looked at you strange when you look them in the eyes said, "I don't do that. Why do you dress that certain way?" I'll tell you why you dress that certain way. And it's not because of church. It's because of God's word. &gt;&gt; Why do you not cut your hair? It's because that's what God's word tells me. &gt;&gt; And they begin to look at you in a certain way. AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T DO THIS FOR A PEOPLE. I DO THIS FOR GOD." &gt;&gt; And they want you TO TURN TO A CERTAIN RADIO AND YOU SAY, "NO, I DON'T LISTEN TO THAT KIND OF TRASH. I DON'T WATCH THOSE THOSE KIND OF MOVIES. &gt;&gt; I DON'T GO TO THOSE INTERNET SITES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Ron, but I CAN'T DO THAT. I I just can't seem to live the life." LISTEN, WITHOUT GOD, NONE OF US CAN. Brother Bram SAYS WE ARE INVITED TO SHAPE OUR CHARACTER TO HIS CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS HE SAID SHAPING OUR CHARACTER HIS TO HIS OWN CHARACTER. THEN WE BY HIM ARE THE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE OH BROTHER I I I I WANT TO BE I WANT TO BE. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Oh one day one day ONE DAY ONE DAY. LISTEN NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD. God in his fore planning in his fore planning when he was preparing Lelay Oysa and he was watching who would live in this age. Abram was called to live in his day. Jonah was called to live in his day. Nehemiah was called to live in his day. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; They overcome their age. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THE APOSTLE PAUL AND ALL THE followers overcame their age. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther and the followers overcame their age. &gt;&gt; And here came brother Brandham in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Sure, he had weaknesses, but I'm not here to destroy him with HIS WEAKNESSES CUZ I GOT WEAKNESSES. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DEITY THAT LIVED INSIDE OF HIM. THE VOICE THAT WAS BEARDING THE VOICE OF WHO IS THIS MELZDC also lives in us. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT HELPED HIM TO OVERCOME AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A TREE. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD COMES TO MEETINGS LIKE THIS &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THE VOICE OF A SPEAKER TO YOU. AND TELLS YOU YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE AN ORDAINED PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A CAUSE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PREDESTINATED PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SOME REAL BATTLES. YOU'VE GOT FREE CHOICE BECAUSE GOD DON'T FORCE NOTHING ON YOU. &gt;&gt; You come TO CHURCH. MAYBE YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER HAS HAS THROUGH THE INSISTENCE OF THE WORD HAS SAID, "NO, I WANT YOU TO GO. I want you to go. I WANT YOU TO GO." BUT ONE DAY, YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE TO MAKE. &gt;&gt; AND GOD DON'T FORCE NOTHING ON YOU. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T SEND YOU THROUGH A PIPE AND JUST ALLOW YOU TO COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. HE DON'T PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY OVERCOMING. YOU'VE GOT SOME WRESTLING TO DO. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOME FIGHTING TO DO. YOU WALK TO AN ALTAR, YOU COME TO A SERVICE, YOU FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD. HEY, LISTEN. THAT ISN'T FINISHED PRODUCT YET. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL BATTLES THAT YOU'VE GOT TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE 20 OR YOU'RE 90, YOU'RE STILL OVERCOMING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN, WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THESE scriptures are more ALIVE TONIGHT THAN THEY'VE ever been, &gt;&gt; THAT THE GOD THAT CHANGED ABRAHAM &gt;&gt; AND PRODUCED A SON CALLED ISAAC IN HIM &gt;&gt; IS GOING TO PRODUCE A SUPER RACE AND A SUPER CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO PRODUCE &gt;&gt; A PROJECTION OF HIS MIND. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SURE. IN OUR BOOK OF LIFE, IN OUR PARABLE OF LIES, WE HAVE WEAKNESSES WITH THE WORLD. WE HAVE WEAKNESSES WITH OURSELVES. &gt;&gt; We be real honest. There's some times that, listen, YOU FEEL LIKE GOD OUGHT TO TAKE YOU UP AND PUT YOU OVER A DUMPSTER SOMEWHERE ANOTHER AND PUT YOU IN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME TIMES THAT GOD, YOU FEEL LIKE GOD'S RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU. THERE'S TIMES YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S A MILLION MILES AWAY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES THAT YOU HOPE GOD IS RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. AND THERE'S TIMES THAT YOU HOPE GOD IS A MILLION MILES AWAY &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH YOUR WEAKNESSES. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE, "OH, BROTHER RON, NOBODY KNOWS." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. GOD KNOWS. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; SANTA CLAUS, HE DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP. HE KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE. HE KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD. SO be good FOR GOODNESS SAKE. &gt;&gt; WHAT AN IMITATION. MY GOD, &gt;&gt; MY GOD IS ALIVE TONIGHT. AND HE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOUR WEAKNESSES HAS CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO PREACH THE SERMON TONIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT. HE WANTS TO COME TO YOU. HE WANTS TO HELP YOU. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I WRESTLE WITH MYSELF. SO DID JACOB. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; JACOB WAS A REAL RASCAL. &gt;&gt; HERE WAS A MAN THAT'S GOING TO BE CALLED ISRAEL, A PRINCE WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, HE'S A DECEIVER. &gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THIS CHURCH would have picked him. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, &gt;&gt; "I LOVE JACOB AND I HATE ESAU." &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, HIS OWN FATHER, GOD HAD TO BLIND HIS EYES. &gt;&gt; HE WAS STAGGERING IN THE DARKNESS. HE WAS STAGGERING IN THE DARKNESS, MAYBE FEELING HIS WAY TO the tent, FEELING HIS WAY TO THE TABLE, feeling his wife, his beautiful wife, A LOVE STORY. AND HE WAS FEELING HIS WAY BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE PICKED JACOB. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD HAVE NEVER PICKED JACOB. SO GOD SENT A BLINDNESS ON HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD DID HIM A FAVOR. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER, WHY DID I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT TRIAL? WHY DID THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT TRIAL?" HE DID YOU a favor. &gt;&gt; I WILL TELL YOU THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF LAST SEPTEMBER 10TH, HE DID ME A FAVOR. While I couldn't even write, WHILE I COULDN'T EVEN USE A COMPUTER, WHILE I COULDN'T EVEN USE A PHONE, I COULD HEAR THE VOICE OF THAT PROPHET. &gt;&gt; AND FOR MONTHS, LISTEN, A MONTH, SITTING IN A WHEELCHAIR, MONTHS SITTING THERE WITH MY WIFE WAITING ON ME HAND AND FOOT LIKE AN IMBLELET CHILD. WHILE I SAT THERE, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. I SAT AND I ALLOWED GOD TO ABSORB INTO MY LIFE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. I SAY HERE TONIGHT, HE DID ME A FAVOR. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, WHAT A HORRIBLE THING THE DEVIL DID. HE DID ME A FAVOR." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD'S BIGGER THAN THE DEVIL. WE GIVE THE DEVIL TOO MUCH CREDIT. &gt;&gt; GOD IS BIGGER THAN ANY DEVIL IN HELL. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I CAN'T OVERCOME MY WEAKNESS." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. THERE'S NOT A WEAKNESS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CAN HELP YOU WITH. &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER RON, I DON'T HAVE A THIRST FOR GOD. I DON'T HAVE A HUNGER LIKE I NEED TO." PRAY GOD, TAKE THE DESIRES OUT OF MY LIFE THAT ARE SUBSTITUTING THEMSELVES FOR GOD. GOD CREATED ME A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SCRIPTURE DAVID SAID. CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART. OH GOD, &gt;&gt; RENEW. Renew a right spirit. Brother said each generation has to have its own revival. &gt;&gt; The reason we have seminaries, polish schools, is because they have rearview mirrors. &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to the 1500s. the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to Luther. &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to Westley. They want to take you back to Isuza Street. &gt;&gt; Not done. &gt;&gt; Want to take you back to 1965. &gt;&gt; I wasn't sitting in the meetings then. He was. &gt;&gt; But when it came my turn to set in his meetings, he took me there. &gt;&gt; DAD SAID, "YOU'LL ENJOY HIM." And he began to SPEAK AND LET US RUN. 12-500 PEOPLE SITTING there and I sat there AND HE BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT PAUL RAN, &gt;&gt; Gford ran, Peter Cartright ran, &gt;&gt; William Brham ran, &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID THE BATON HAS BEEN HANDED OFF. AND AS I SAT THERE AS A YOUNG MAN &gt;&gt; JUST MARRIED TO MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WIFE HERE, SOMETHING STRUCK IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THAT SEED THAT HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; That seed THAT THROUGH NATURE HAD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. MAYBE MY FOREFATHERS CAME ACROSS ON SHIPS AND STORMS WENT AGAINST THEM, BUT THEY WERE CARRYING MY SEED. MAYBE THEIR FOREFATHERS WERE IN WARS AND GOD PROTECTED THAT SIN. &gt;&gt; HE STOPPED BULLETS. &gt;&gt; HE STOPPED BRIGADES. &gt;&gt; HE WATCHED OVER MANY TIMES IN DEATH CAMPS, &gt;&gt; THE BUBANIC PLAGUES, &gt;&gt; THE FLU, &gt;&gt; BABIES DYING. HE WATCHED OVER MY NATURAL SEED. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE SAY, "OH, GOD'S NEVER DID NOTHING FOR ME JUST TO GET YOU HERE." IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE. Whether you have red hair, BROWN HAIR, BLONDE HAIR, GOD KNEW THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WHETHER YOU'RE TALL OR YOU'RE SHORT, YOU'RE SKINN OR YOU'RE FAT. GOD KNEW THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HE WATCHED OVER YOUR NATURAL HOUSING BECAUSE INSIDE OF THAT NATURAL HOUSING, HE WAS GOING TO PUT A SEED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LITTLE BUTTON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL BANKRUPT HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; GOD IS DETERMINED. HE WILL BANKRUPT HEAVEN BECAUSE BEFORE HE LOSES ONE OF YOU, YOU SAY, "I'LL RUN." GO AHEAD AND RUN. &gt;&gt; RUN. &gt;&gt; RUN TO ALASKA. &gt;&gt; RUN TO NEW ZEALAND. &gt;&gt; RUN TO VIRGINIA. GOD'S THERE. &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time at a camp and they had a bull horn on the outside of the camp and WAS A MAN SITTING IN THEIR TRUCK. HE HAD BROUGHT HIS WIFE TO CHURCH. HE HAD RAN 3,000 MILES AND HE'D MARRIED A WOMAN from that LOCAL COMMUNITY WAS SITTING IN CHURCH. HE HATED CHURCH AND HE WAS LISTENING TO THAT bullhorn and all of a sudden he came through the back door and all of a sudden he was sitting on the front row and all of a sudden he was at the altar before the service was over. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'D BEEN RUNNING." HE SAID, "BUT GOD FOUND ME. YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M ON THE RUN." GO AHEAD, RUN. &gt;&gt; RUN. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD RUN A 4-MINUTE MILE AND YOU CAN'T OUTRUN GOD. &gt;&gt; I'm going to GET A JOB AWAY FROM CHURCH. GO AHEAD. GOD WILL FIND YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT MY CHILDREN. GIVE THEM TO GOD. &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, I CAN'T CONVICT THEM, BUT YOU CAN. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY HUSBAND. I WANT YOU TO GO GET MY CHILDREN. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE HOLY GHOST AND SEND GOD'S HOLY GHOST AGENT. I HEARD BROTHER RAM SAY JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE SAID, "MAY GOD SEND HIS HOLY GHOST AGENT AND SEND CONVICTION ON THEM." &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, I GIVE UP. GOOD. CUZ WHEN YOU GIVE UP, GOD BEGINS TO DO SOMETHING. It isn't supposed to be this easy on the first night. &gt;&gt; Run. &gt;&gt; AND I WAS RUNNING AND HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT RUNNING AND SOMETHING STRUCK THAT STREET THAT WHICH GOD HAD DEPOSITED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND I IN MY HUMANITY COULD NOT PRODUCE WHAT GOD WANTED. &gt;&gt; I DID NOT WANT TO BE A PREACHER. &gt;&gt; I hated being a preacher. I still hate being a preacher. &gt;&gt; Makes me too nervous. But you see, gifts and callings are without repentance. So he begins to pull on you and he pulls and he moves and no man can come except the spirit of God draws him. Now he knows you've got some overcoming that you've got to do. But so did the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; And she had some weaknesses. She had some excuses. And you've got some excuses. You're said, you're sitting here tonight and you said, "My friends." Well, what are your friends? &gt;&gt; A friend that'll put a beer bottle to your to your mouth is not your friend. &gt;&gt; A FRIEND THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE WRONG KIND OF A MOVIE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. &gt;&gt; A FRIEND THAT PLAYS THE WRONG KIND OF MUSIC, HE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND. A FRIEND THAT WILL HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN CHURCH IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Just the first night. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I know everything brother Ram said, so does the devil. &gt;&gt; He attended every one of Brother Ram's meetings. That don't give him a new birth. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I ain't been here 17 years. I've been in church ALL THESE YEARS. YOU STILL NEED A BIRTH. &gt;&gt; If Mary had to go to Pentecost, &gt;&gt; you've got to go to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'd walked to an ALTAR AND I WALKED AWAY AND THE NEXT WEEK, YOU KNOW, I WAS STRONGER. AND THEN WEEKS LATER, YOU KNOW, I I FOUND OUT THAT I just didn't have it. And so I kind of I kind of just kind of went back. And brother Ron, I want to BE IN A CERTAIN CLICK IN THE CHURCH. I want to be in the click. &gt;&gt; The click that is filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The click that has a Holy Ghost meeting &gt;&gt; and I MEET GOD. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE IN the click &gt;&gt; TO WHERE WHEN I GET SICK, I CAN SAY, "YOU PRAY for me." And you just immediately go to prayer. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of click I want to be in. I want to be in the kind of group that IS NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST SITTING IN A PEW. &gt;&gt; I want to be in THE GROUP THAT IS NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST CLAPPING THEIR HANDS, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A BURST FROM THEIR HEART. &gt;&gt; I'm one OF THEM. I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M SO GLAD THAT I CAN SAY I'M ONE OF THEM. TELL ME, BROTHER RON, WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE? I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU MEET GOD. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT WILLIAM BRANDON MET AT THE OLD WOODSHED. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT MET HIM AT A CAVE. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT STOOD AND PREACHED THE SEVEN SAILS. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD IS STILL ALIVE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST IN A BOOK. IT'S NOT JUST IN A PICTURE ON THE WALL, &gt;&gt; I tell you what. The same transforming power that turned Simon to Peter. &gt;&gt; The same transforming power that turned Abram to Abraham. &gt;&gt; The same transforming power that turned Sarah from a dominating female to a princess with God. &gt;&gt; The same transforming power can take a lessian Jezebel, &gt;&gt; THE BARBIE DOLL OF THE CHURCH, AND MAKE A SAINT OF GOD out of her. THAT SAME GOD CAN TAKE A BOY ON THE FRINGE. &gt;&gt; HE MAY BE THE DEACON'S KIDS, THE PREACHERS'S KIDS, &gt;&gt; BUT ONE DAY HE MEETS THE FIRE FOR HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. They told me not to preach for a year. &gt;&gt; One time. I said just one time. And every time I get in the pull pit, I preach one time. &gt;&gt; I want to read about you. Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian. The woman at the well once she left the presence of God no longer had a weakness for men. &gt;&gt; And if you apply it the right way, once you leave this altar, YOU MAY HAVE HAD SOME weaknesses in the old book. &gt;&gt; You say about it, Brother Ron, nobody knows. God knows. GOD KNOWS THOSE SITES THAT YOU GO TO, &gt;&gt; THOSE MY SPACES, &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THOSE PLACES THAT YOU GO WHEN NOBODY ELSE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN SUCH AN INFORMATION AGE THAT EVERYTHING IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL. ONLY A click &gt;&gt; and YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE PIT OF HELL. &gt;&gt; AND SATAN WARS WITH YOUR MIND BECAUSE THAT'S THE SPACES THAT HE CAN GO TO. LISTEN, HE CAN'T GO TO YOUR SOUL, BUT HE CAN COME TO YOUR MIND AND HE WARS WITH YOU AND HE WARS WITH YOU. BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE THAT SUPERNATURAL TONGUE AND SAY, "DEVIL, YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS, NO AUTHORITY OVER ME. I CHASTISE THOSE THOUGHTS IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST AND YOU HAVE DEFEATED ME." HOW MANY TIMES DID BROTHER BRANDHAM LOOK AT THE devil and say, "Satan, I want to take you back to a place in a cave where an angel of the Lord met ME AND YOU'RE STRIPPED OF ALL YOUR POWER. &gt;&gt; And I was TOLD BY AN ANGEL OF THE LORD THAT NOT EVEN CANCER could stand before me." &gt;&gt; Listen, the devil KNEW THAT, BUT HE WAS REMINDING HIM OF THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I HAVE COMPLETELY I HAVE WEAKNESS AFTER WEAKNESS." JUST KEEP REMINDING THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; It might HAVE TO GO ON A YEAR THAT YOU WRESTLE WITH HIM, BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL GET VICTORY. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE IT DON'T GO AWAY IN A MONTH, IT DON'T GO AWAY IN A YEAR. DON'T QUIT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR ENERGIES DOING IT ANYWAY. IT'S A SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT YOU KEEP FEEDING YOUR SOUL WITH. YOU KEEP TAKING THAT WORD AND YOU KEEP TAKING THAT SWORD AND YOU KEEP CHOPPING THAT DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I can do all things THROUGH CHRIST WHICH STRENGTHENS ME. &gt;&gt; I've been TO THE ALTAR ONE TIME ONCE. KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE. KEEP WRESTLING UNTIL HE COMES &gt;&gt; AND HOLD ON TILL HE CHANGES YOU. &gt;&gt; Parent says, "Oh, brother, my children don't need that." I knew I'll tell you tonight without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Satan has every right to ATTACK THEM. AND WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, THE FIRST TIME THEY HEAR ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC, IT'LL TAKE them that way. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, MY CHILDREN'S BEEN RAISED IN THE MESSAGE. SO WAS I. &gt;&gt; BUT WITHOUT A NEW BIRTH, &gt;&gt; BUT THEY BELIEVE, BROTHER BRANDON, SO DID I. &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET, I HAD A FIGHT IN A BALLROOM ONE NIGHT. SOMEBODY SAID, "YOUR DADDY DON'T PREACH TRUTH." AND I BLACKED HIS OWN. Short men can't fight. But that didn't prove I had a birth. MOSES HAD A NEED. AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE HAD WHAT HE LACKED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, you can't get IT WITH NATURE VALLEY HERBS. You can't get it with psychology. &gt;&gt; JOEL OLSTEIN WITH ALL OF HIS PSYCHOLOGY DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; DR. DOBSON DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; BENNY CHICKEN DOES NOT PRODUCE A A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; TD J DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, CHRIST THE ANOINTED WORD, &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTED WORD FOR THIS DAY, &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE THAT CAME AND GAVE MY DAD A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD CAME AND GAVE ME A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD CAME AND GAVE MY SONS A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SATAN WANTS US TO POLISH. And before long, ALL THE BUSINESSMEN ARE HAPPY IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG, WE'VE GOT POLISHED SONG LEADERS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT POLISHED PREACHERS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT ENTERTAINMENT RATHER THAN A HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows. Brother Brandham was standing there and he said, "I see you just about hit in a dark colored car by a by a train and you're with a man other than your husband." Don't tell it. He knew. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew you've had incidents and you cover it up. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, I GOT IT COVERED." GOD KNOWS. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU STATED IT THROUGH, BUT GOD KNOWS. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU TOLD A FEW LIES BECAUSE IF YOU TELL A LIE, YOU GOT TO TELL 42 TO GET KEEP COVERING IT. AND YOUR FIRST NATURE BECAUSE YOU GIVE INTO IT BEFORE LONG THEY'RE TELLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO KEEP IT COVERED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, actors are not just in Hollywood. Sometimes they're sitting right here. &gt;&gt; We got Oscar winning performances. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU DIG A DICK HERE AT THIS CHURCH DON'T MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT A POLE UP DON'T MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN RUN A SOUND SYSTEM THAT DON'T MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, BUT I WORK SO HARD THAT DON'T PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; THAT'LL GET YOU REWARD, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. BUT I I'VE BEEN SO LONG AWAY FROM COMING FROM THE CAMP AND I, YOU KNOW, I I I REALLY I DO A LOT OF THINGS. I GO TO EVERY SERVICE. BUT DO YOU REALLY HAVE IT? The reason we have CHILDREN DELINQUENCY, WE HAVE PARENT DELINQUENCY. &gt;&gt; THE REASON CHILDREN DON'T PRAY IS PARENTS DON'T PRAY. &gt;&gt; THE REASON CHILDREN WATCH TELEVISION, MOMS AND DADS WATCH TELEVISION. The reason ch &gt;&gt; am I the right place? &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE SO EXHAUSTED. THAT'S THE DEVIL'S JOB. HE KEEPS YOU SO BUSY, HE KEEPS YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; You're numbed and he begins to paralyze you. He paralyzes the church. &gt;&gt; Just okay. &gt;&gt; You see, it's like a creeping paralysis. Brother Brandham says it creeps into the church and Before long, there's things that come in there that used to didn't come in there. &gt;&gt; I'm on the pews now. &gt;&gt; Brother DDA, Brother John, Brother Tom, the Ed ministries, we watch and we watch things begin to creep in. &gt;&gt; AND YOU PREACH YOU THRUST YOUR VOICE BY THE ANOINTING OF GOD AND YOU WATCH SATAN BEGIN to creep in. &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS NOT A SON OF BIN LADEN. &gt;&gt; A WOOLLY MAN THAT LIVES IN A CAVE. &gt;&gt; Sounds like a little Disney tale, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS NOT RUNNING OUT OF FUEL. IT'S NOT THE EARTH WARMING. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN IRAQ OR IRAN. &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS WORLDLYISM. BECAUSE THAT FIRST BOOK &gt;&gt; IS ATTACHED TO THIS THIS EARTHLY WORLD &gt;&gt; AND IT BEGINS TO CREEP INTO US &gt;&gt; AND IT ATTACKS US AND BEFORE LONG OUR PRAYER LIFE IS ERODED. &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG WE FEEL SO EXHAUSTED WE'VE GOT TO ENTERTAIN OURSELVES. For long we don't go to church we scream and for that let me just say this to you never forsake the assembling of yourselves together &gt;&gt; so much the more as you see that day approaching &gt;&gt; and it is here. &gt;&gt; There may not be another camp next year. Every signpost is here. &gt;&gt; We put it off a million miles. I got NEWS FOR YOU. IT'S NOT A MILLION MILES OFF. IT'S HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO HOME? &gt;&gt; IF OUR SPIRITUAL ACTS COULD ONLY COME OPEN TO US, &gt;&gt; God ordained you to live in 2008. and he sees the weaknesses that you deal with on an everyday basis. Now, we could glamorize this thing and TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT Samson how he overcame and Shamgar and how he overcame AND PAUL HOW HE OVERCAME. But I want to see you overcome. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT PERSONAL STRUGGLES. AND LET'S NOT BE HOLLYWOOD ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE REAL. &gt;&gt; You go home with them. &gt;&gt; YOU SIT WITH THEM AND ON THE PEW BESIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY'RE DOING THIS, THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART LONGING FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THE PEER PRESSURES THAT ARE AROUND YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU WRESTLE WITH IT EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; YOUNG MAN, YOU SITTING RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T FIGHT THE BATTLES HE DOES. HE DON'T FIGHT THE BATTLES YOU DO. BUT THOSE BATTLES ARE REAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS AN OVERCOMING POWER. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T READ ABOUT SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEO BECAUSE THEY QUIT, &gt;&gt; THEY BENT, THEY BOWED, THEY GAVE UP, THEY COMPROMISED. &gt;&gt; They overcame. &gt;&gt; THEY OVERCAME. SURE, YOU'VE GOT WEAKNESSES. &gt;&gt; SURE, YOU FALL. BUT IT'S NOT HIM THAT FALLS AND LAYS THERE THAT OVERCOMES. IT'S HIM THAT &gt;&gt; GETS UP. &gt;&gt; IT'S HIM THAT GETS UP. &gt;&gt; ANYBODY CAN FALL AND STAY THERE, BUT HIM THAT GETS UP. I came out of the coma after after weeks. I didn't KNOW WHERE I WAS, WHAT WAS GOING ON. BUT AFTER I begin to get SOME SENSES TO MYSELF, AND I BEGIN TO REALIZE, I realized that there WAS A SEED DOWN INSIDE OF ME THAT HAD TO RESPOND OVER TOP OF MY FLESHLY FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; I never felt like I could ever preach again. BUT I JUST SAY IT STARTED SAYING TWO WORDS. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Sister Connie was driving me home from the hospital and all THE WAY UP AFTON Mountain I was saying boovil. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; OH GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH. I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PREACH THIS MEETING, &gt;&gt; BUT I TELL YOU TONIGHT, THERE'S A SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL, A SUPERNATURAL POWER THAT IS IN THIS TENT AND ON THESE HALLOWED GROUNDS THAT WANTS TO MEET YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say a couple of more words and I'll leave you with this this evening. I know many of you traveled distances. You've just settled into the camp this evening. You left your home. This meeting you've been praying for for months. &gt;&gt; Many of you labored for this camp. You've taught. You've become exhausted. maybe even weary and welloing. You walk into this meeting and the enemy that has been battling you and war with you would like to distract you again and like I'd like to tell you that this is just another camp. I'm here to tell you if God brought me from the throws of death God had this camp bought. God had all of this work done just to gather you here. &gt;&gt; This is not just another meeting. Nobody knows you like you know you. &gt;&gt; Parents don't know you. Friends sometimes don't really know you. WE HEAR STORIES MAN MURDERS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND people that live right with him says I didn't know him like that. &gt;&gt; No way could have been a murderer. No way could have did all OF THAT. I KNOW HIM. THEY NEVER THEY'D never touch a flea. They didn't know them. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S SAD TO SAY MANY TIMES THAT PEOPLE SIT RIGHT IN THE pews &gt;&gt; and you really don't know them cuz they WRESTLE WITH THAT FIRST BOOK. &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, ONCE YOU MEET THE PILLAR OF FIRE, AND THE CLEANSING BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND YOU MEET A SUPERNATURAL GOD AND HE HAS CAME TO MEET you here tonight. &gt;&gt; He said, "Cast all your cares." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't want to be honest. We want to be an actor impersonator. We want to be we want to be something that we're really not. can't come to God like that. You be honest with God. God, I have got some real problems. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; This is what God laid on my heart. I just I have some real problems. That man was a good man, my dad. But I had some real problems. But I became honest and I SAID, "GOD, I RON HAS GOT SOME REAL PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; Are you with me?" &gt;&gt; And until Ron &gt;&gt; could make the decision, &gt;&gt; Ron, YOU'VE GOT TO DIE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE THIS WAY NO MORE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE A DOUBLE STANDARD. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE ON THE FENCE. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH WORLDS. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SATISFY BOTH PLACES. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T QUIT RUNNING FROM YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT DAY, OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT DAY, I MET GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD CAME TO ME. &gt;&gt; SURE, I HAD ALL THE BOOKS AND I LISTENED TO THE TAPES AND I'D HEARD PREACHING, BUT I NEEDED GOD HIMSELF. MORE THAN A HANDSHAKE, MORE THAN A PAT ON THE BACK, MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER TAPE, MORE THAN JUST SOME OTHER BOOK. &gt;&gt; I needed more than a motivational sermon. &gt;&gt; So, I'm laboring tonight cuz I know without an experience, you're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; Brother You don't have to have emotion. Any thought with anything without emotion is dead. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to help help the birth to come play. But that eagle, he has to peck on that egg. &gt;&gt; And if mama helps him, he'll die. &gt;&gt; And he has to peck. And all the strength that it takes him to peck his way through will give him strength to live. &gt;&gt; And the strength that you HAVE TO OVERCOME AND STEP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND GO TO AN ALTAR AND SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING FOR ME AND NOT THE PREACHER, NOT BROTHER ED. &gt;&gt; I CAME TO THIS CAMP UNDER EXPECTATION." IF IF YOU CAME UNDER EXPECTATION, YOU GET WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING. IF YOU CAME TO GO HOME A DIFFERENT PERSON, YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T TAKE GOD 20 YEARS. &gt;&gt; GOD COULD COME IN FIVE MINUTES AND CHANGE your life forever. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT MY WEAKNESS. GIVE YOUR WEAKNESS TO GOD AND GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH WHEN YOUR WEAKNESS COMES BACK. HE WILL OVERCOME THAT WEAKNESS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet this evening. Bow our heads. Musicians would come please. Lord Jesus, in my weakness of my own humanity, I realize the fraily my own being. I realized as I was studying in the coming weeks what you had laid on my heart for this first night, I realized the difficulty it would be to speak because Satan wants to disguise his weaknesses and if he continues can continue the weakness can constantly bombard the He can constantly pull away from the fellowship of God. But when we realize what we've been called to do from this age, and it's been more than just to come to church, more than just occupy a few people, but we've got some real overcoming to do. I can't overcome for them. Brother Ed can't overcome for them. Brother Tom can't overcome for them. Their best friends can't overcome for somewhere or another. We have to be honest and say, "God, I need you to help me. I need you to change my name. I need you to change my nature. &gt;&gt; I need you to change my being, God. Change my desires. Change my heart away. I feel the deep calling to the deep. I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of playing church. God, you did all of this to call us to this night. I come to my place.
