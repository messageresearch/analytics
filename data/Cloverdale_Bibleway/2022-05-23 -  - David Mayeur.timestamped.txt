[16:39] and
[16:39] that's the song
[16:46] [Music]
[16:52] good evening and god bless you just
[16:54] wanted to say a few words maybe i'll
[16:55] just start by saying i don't make a
[16:57] habit of dressing like a cowboy but it
[16:59] was wild west day at the school today
[17:00] and i didn't have time to go home so we
[17:02] have fun at bca and
[17:05] i honestly i can't say i can't really
[17:07] express with words just how much i
[17:09] appreciate
[17:10] all these students bca just the fact
[17:12] that we have that school and
[17:14] that i was able to
[17:15] get that position and it's just been
[17:16] such a blessing to me in so many ways
[17:19] these these children are amazing these
[17:21] young lives
[17:23] uh i think
[17:24] it's part of the you know the the vision
[17:26] of this church right that's kind of an
[17:28] extension of the bible we've come to
[17:29] bibleway christian academy so we wanted
[17:31] to have something to kind of represent
[17:32] at these meetings but one thing i wanted
[17:34] to say was
[17:36] one thing that really impresses me about
[17:37] the bca students is just how
[17:40] how much comes up from inside them you
[17:42] know like i know brother michael ray has
[17:44] been preaching a lot about tower the
[17:45] body and it's not just a one-man show
[17:47] anymore everybody's kind of working
[17:49] together and that's exactly what i see
[17:51] like the song we're about to sing for
[17:52] you tonight a young man approaches me
[17:55] and he says
[17:56] i was down in some special meetings and
[17:57] there was this song and it was really a
[17:59] blessing to the believers down there
[18:01] and i just thought maybe you know if you
[18:02] wanted we could do that as a choir and i
[18:04] thought yeah absolutely i want to
[18:06] support you in that so we're going to do
[18:07] that and then while we're practicing a
[18:09] young sister jumps up and says hey it
[18:10] sounded like that section needed a
[18:11] little bit of help do you want me to go
[18:13] yeah absolutely you know i think it
[18:15] almost feels like i'm just the guy that
[18:16] just was standing there and everything
[18:17] happened so
[18:19] i hope you hope the song's a blessing
[18:37] [Music]
[18:49] sometimes on this journey i get lost in
[18:52] my mistakes
[18:54] what looks to me like weakness is a
[18:57] canvas for your strength
[19:00] and my story isn't over
[19:03] my story's just begun
[19:06] failure won't define me cause that's
[19:09] what my father does
[19:11] yeah failure won't define me cause
[19:14] that's what my father does
[19:17] [Music]
[19:30] is
[19:33] [Music]
[19:50] heaven is the ankle
[19:53] but the journey's where we are
[19:56] he never wanted perfect he just wanted
[19:59] my heart
[20:01] and the story isn't over
[20:04] if the story isn't good
[20:07] a failure's never final and the father's
[20:10] in the room
[20:12] yeah failure's never final when the
[20:15] father's in the room
[20:19] [Music]
[20:22] is
[20:25] [Music]
[20:42] [Music]
[20:46] love is on the move
[20:48] when the father's in the room
[20:51] the prison doors fleeing wide
[20:54] the dead come to life
[20:57] love is on the move
[21:07] [Music]
[21:15] strongholds now are shaken
[21:18] love is breaking through
[21:20] when the fire
[21:23] love is breaking through
[21:30] [Music]

[39:22] brother
[39:23] tim pruitt
[39:25] and brother tim pruitt has said
[39:30] he said again at our table
[39:33] and i believe it with all my heart
[39:36] he said brother ron spencer
[39:39] is a miracle amen when he stands and
[39:42] preaches
[39:44] every week and i know something about
[39:46] that
[39:47] [Applause]
[39:50] and he's the man who prayed a prayer
[39:54] when i was laying in the hospital
[39:57] and i
[39:58] suddenly
[40:00] i jerked my head
[40:02] because i knew my family was waiting
[40:06] and
[40:08] i said i don't know and i said out loud
[40:12] i don't know if i'm going to come out of
[40:14] there
[40:17] i had had
[40:20] brother ron spencer pray
[40:23] and i said
[40:25] i'll just call his cell
[40:27] you don't mind standing do you
[40:29] a few moments
[40:31] i'll call his cell
[40:34] and if he answers
[40:36] then i know that god is
[40:38] has put it together
[40:41] and i
[40:43] called his cell
[40:45] and i said brother ron
[40:47] i called you once
[40:49] for prayer
[40:50] now i'm calling you again
[40:53] for prayer
[40:55] the first time
[40:57] it was just a
[41:00] physical thing
[41:02] but this time it's a spiritual thing and
[41:06] i don't know whether i'm going to come
[41:07] out of this place
[41:11] and
[41:12] he said sure brotherhood
[41:15] and he prayed a prayer and he started to
[41:17] pray
[41:19] and i thought
[41:21] while he was praying i thought i'm going
[41:22] to

[42:47] and a half hours
[42:49] and he
[42:50] dr chung was his name
[42:54] and i thought it was dr watson going to
[42:57] be doing the operation

[43:01] i i just
[43:03] when brother
[43:04] ron spencer was praying

[43:13] or the woman
[43:15] or the doctor he said anoint them
[43:18] anoint them
[43:20] so that they will
[43:22] rise to the

[44:48] and he said all of our people our
[44:50] teams are good

[46:09] he was ready to do the surgery for me
[46:13] and he
[46:15] i want to
[46:16] say this
[46:19] my daughters were there
[46:22] and they tapped real quick and my for my
[46:25] wife's sake
[46:27] and brought up the google
[46:29] search
[46:31] and brought up
[46:32] dr
[46:33] chung's name
[46:35] and he got famous
[46:37] by transplanting
[46:39] three human hearts
[46:41] in one evening
[46:44] and that was a
[46:46] 15 he stood on his feet for 15 hours
[46:49] and transplanted those three hearts and
[46:52] i
[46:54] i felt okay
[46:59] i felt okay
[47:01] and in the morning he said hi i'm dr
[47:04] chung
[47:05] i said nice to see you he said this is
[47:08] dr kang from singapore he's going to be
[47:12] assisting me
[47:14] and
[47:15] watching while i do the surgery i said
[47:18] well great i prayed for you
[47:20] all both of you and by name dr chunk i
[47:24] prayed for you
[47:26] dr kang i prayed for you
[47:29] and they said well thank you
[47:31] they accepted that
[47:34] but i i wanted to get that
[47:37] in and i had prayed for them
[47:40] and a man who was a cardiologist was not
[47:43] even there
[47:45] but he was looking at the pictures and
[47:47] he said
[47:48] well he said we have
[47:52] 14 blockages
[47:54] and we've bypassed those
[47:58] and
[47:59] the dr chung was able to bypass them
[48:03] with about
[48:04] three
[48:06] only three bypasses
[48:10] it was just miraculous
[48:12] and uh
[48:15] so i was standing there and he said
[48:19] he said you have this bypass
[48:22] and that bypass
[48:24] and you have a uh
[48:26] an extra one
[48:28] he says and my wife said to him
[48:31] why do we have that he said it's because
[48:34] he's a man of god
[48:37] and he's jewish
[48:39] he was jewish
[48:41] cardiologist
[48:43] but he said well he's a man of god
[48:46] and
[48:46] so they operated on it
[48:50] and he
[48:52] he wouldn't let michael in the room
[48:56] michael wanted so badly to go in
[49:04] michael is our in-house doctor
[49:08] but he this was above him
[49:11] apparently
[49:14] anyhow michael
[49:16] that was the other part of the story
[49:19] and that's why they wouldn't let
[49:21] because i had said to my wife nobody
[49:24] goes in and sees
[49:26] until the tube is on
[49:28] i don't i don't want them to see in tube
[49:32] and that was because
[49:35] my friend
[49:37] my
[49:39] son-in-law
[49:41] who's married to
[49:43] linda ordeal
[49:46] and kenneth ordeal was there
[49:49] and i said i do not want them to see
[49:52] them
[49:53] moving that two boat two weeks before
[49:57] he had saw he had
[49:59] had to give the word for his
[50:02] mother
[50:03] to have the tube taken out and she
[50:06] didn't last
[50:08] and they had a
[50:10] funeral for her and i said i don't want
[50:13] that right i i don't want that to happen
[50:18] i want to
[50:19] him to know that it's all done
[50:22] and it's finished
[50:24] and the man who was doing it he said
[50:27] can you hear me yes i said i can hear
[50:29] you
[50:30] he said the last little thing i'm going
[50:33] to do is take the tube out
[50:35] and i took it out i wasn't in tubed
[50:38] anymore

[1:10:41] what an honor to be standing here
[1:10:43] that's from the bottom of my heart
[1:10:45] it's good to be back but it's an honor
[1:10:48] to be standing here
[1:10:49] in front of the saints
[1:10:51] for this
[1:10:52] 50th anniversary
[1:10:55] my
[1:10:56] i just want to take a before i preach
[1:10:59] this is the moment i want to take so
[1:11:01] maybe if you can take your seeds just
[1:11:05] so i bring you greetings on behalf of my
[1:11:07] precious wife family the church and
[1:11:11] i have my son with me i'm very happy he
[1:11:13] could join
[1:11:15] when i asked him do you want to come oh
[1:11:16] for the meetings i want to come so he
[1:11:18] made it possible so
[1:11:20] but again i repeat it's an honor to be
[1:11:22] standing here
[1:11:24] many would have loved to be here
[1:11:27] so i thank brother ed brother tom for
[1:11:29] the invitation
[1:11:31] and we want to give honor where honor is
[1:11:34] due
[1:11:35] so i want to take my time
[1:11:38] and
[1:11:41] we have all the generals behind so
[1:11:46] it's really an honor and a blessing
[1:11:49] but when god calls a man he calls his
[1:11:52] wife
[1:11:54] so brother ed sister ruth
[1:11:58] i looked up the word
[1:12:00] legacy what a legacy
[1:12:03] it says a gift
[1:12:05] or something transmitted
[1:12:09] now 50 years is
[1:12:11] well if if youngsters
[1:12:13] and you know teenagers you tell them
[1:12:15] you're 50 you're old
[1:12:18] i know what i'm talking about so
[1:12:21] but 50 years in a church
[1:12:24] many things happen
[1:12:26] we could see the pictures log church how
[1:12:28] it
[1:12:30] how god blessed
[1:12:32] because that's been said but i want to
[1:12:34] say because a man of god had a vision
[1:12:38] maybe you were not there
[1:12:40] but when you look around
[1:12:43] that's god's doing
[1:12:45] and it is marvelous
[1:12:48] it is marvelous
[1:12:51] brotherhead has given all
[1:12:54] he had
[1:12:55] for the wonderful world of god
[1:12:59] and when i said he has it ain't over yet
[1:13:02] because if he wants to give advice even
[1:13:04] now
[1:13:05] he will say spread the message spread
[1:13:08] the word give it out wherever
[1:13:12] and when i said it's an honor to be
[1:13:13] standing here is you can look around and
[1:13:15] please do
[1:13:18] you know your brothers and sisters but
[1:13:20] there's an unseen
[1:13:23] huge crowd
[1:13:25] maybe we don't think about
[1:13:27] but that were touched because they
[1:13:29] received
[1:13:30] one message book
[1:13:33] because a man of god had
[1:13:35] a passion
[1:13:36] a zeal
[1:13:39] so yeah we want to give honor where
[1:13:40] honor is due
[1:13:42] i met brother i heard brother ed years
[1:13:46] years and years ago and but for the
[1:13:48] first time we met brother ed
[1:13:51] in germany that was the first time we
[1:13:53] met at brother gert rodowals
[1:13:56] in beaslesburg and there was a direct
[1:13:58] bond the direct connection and direct
[1:14:00] love if i may say so don't be jealous
[1:14:04] please because some people could be
[1:14:06] jealous but don't be jealous
[1:14:10] you cannot manufacture that
[1:14:16] and through the years
[1:14:18] i've spent time with brother ed i've
[1:14:20] been honored to have him in my home and
[1:14:22] listening to advice and and
[1:14:26] what a blessing
[1:14:27] you are blessed we are blessed
[1:14:31] and then i learned
[1:14:32] and that understands even better the
[1:14:34] connection is of course we love the word
[1:14:38] we do everything we have for the word of
[1:14:40] god
[1:14:41] and then also hearing his life story or
[1:14:44] you know
[1:14:45] when brother ed was born he was in the
[1:14:48] anna turnbull memorial hospital in
[1:14:50] saskatchewan i'm sorry my pronunciation
[1:14:54] but what struck me is that since 1908
[1:14:57] there was a doctor r g scott
[1:15:00] that was from the geneva mission
[1:15:02] who was in charge
[1:15:04] so brotherhood there was a connection
[1:15:06] already
[1:15:07] you were
[1:15:08] born
[1:15:10] but even before we were born there was
[1:15:13] already a connection
[1:15:15] we were together before the foundation
[1:15:17] of the world
[1:15:19] and we are feasting
[1:15:21] on what god has done through a vessel a
[1:15:24] surrendered vessel 50 years many things
[1:15:27] happened
[1:15:28] many joys
[1:15:30] many hardships
[1:15:33] many birds
[1:15:35] baptisms
[1:15:36] some people has left us
[1:15:39] but i thank god
[1:15:41] for brother redd sister ruth
[1:15:44] you know brother branham he speaks about
[1:15:46] great woman
[1:15:48] this is a woman who has
[1:15:50] faith sister ruth
[1:15:57] and greatness says brother branham is
[1:15:59] humility
[1:16:02] thank you brother ed
[1:16:03] he would never take credit for what he
[1:16:05] has done for the message
[1:16:08] if you want to speak that's why i want
[1:16:10] to take this opportunity please forgive
[1:16:12] me brotherhead but
[1:16:14] from the bottom of my heart i would like
[1:16:16] to say thank you
[1:16:18] and when i say there's an unseen
[1:16:19] invisible crowd yes when brother ed came
[1:16:22] over
[1:16:23] to the meetings
[1:16:26] you have people from different countries
[1:16:28] coming and say thank you
[1:16:30] for sending us the message thank you for
[1:16:33] translating
[1:16:35] maybe you don't understand that
[1:16:39] because you speak english
[1:16:41] you got all the message books you got
[1:16:43] all the tapes and audio but out there
[1:16:45] there are
[1:16:46] people that live with one message book
[1:16:51] for months and months and months
[1:16:55] so i thank god for a vision that he gave
[1:16:58] to a man we're not lifting up man but
[1:17:00] yes we want to be thankful to god for
[1:17:03] what he has done for us
[1:17:07] never wants to take credit
[1:17:09] but i want to say thank you brother ed
[1:17:12] i love you from the bottom of my heart
[1:17:14] we love you family loves you the church
[1:17:17] loves you the saints love you
[1:17:20] and
[1:17:21] while i was coming here
[1:17:24] i listened to a tape on the plane and
[1:17:27] randomly
[1:17:30] and it was proving his word
[1:17:32] and your brother branham starts talking
[1:17:34] and
[1:17:35] he says well there's my precious friend
[1:17:38] of mine brother reverend eddie biskell
[1:17:40] said well hallelujah
[1:17:42] now god knows how to do things
[1:17:45] his brother and my reverend good friend
[1:17:47] brother reverend eddie biskill wife and
[1:17:50] children
[1:17:51] and he says
[1:17:53] probably he was looking for brother
[1:17:54] eddie
[1:17:56] now that's not the a-man corner
[1:18:00] he says you can come over here on the
[1:18:02] platform
[1:18:03] you're welcome to come up and then he
[1:18:05] continues to give the testimony about
[1:18:08] the green checkered church and so on
[1:18:10] so i'm glad
[1:18:12] the prophet called him a good friend
[1:18:15] and by god's grace
[1:18:18] i can call brother ed biskell
[1:18:21] a friend of mine
[1:18:23] it is an honor
[1:18:24] to be standing with real man of god
[1:18:30] so may god bless him may god bless us to
[1:18:32] ruth
[1:18:34] amen
[1:18:37] and like the prophet would say
[1:18:40] the rights is to root a huge portion of
[1:18:42] heaven
[1:18:43] awaits thee
[1:18:45] what you have done to the least
[1:18:51] you have done it unto
[1:18:52] me god bless you brother adam
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:57] and thank you thank you
[1:19:06] so it ain't over
[1:19:09] it's just a continuation
[1:19:12] because something has been transmitted a
[1:19:15] passion a zeal
[1:19:17] and we will continue
[1:19:19] until we leave this place
[1:19:21] amen why don't we stand
[1:19:24] hallelujah
[1:19:33] if we can take the word of god
[1:19:36] take leviticus
[1:19:42] and please forgive me if i didn't shake
[1:19:44] your hand yesterday night
[1:19:47] so we'll have the whole weekend to shake
[1:19:49] hands so
[1:19:51] i wanted to get ready for today but
[1:19:54] i believe god will bless us tonight and
[1:19:57] through the whole weekend
[1:19:59] so leviticus 25 verse 8.
[1:20:13] and thou shalt number seven sabbats of
[1:20:15] years unto thee seven times seven years
[1:20:17] and the space of seven sabbaths of years
[1:20:20] shall be unto thee forty and nine years
[1:20:22] then shall i cause the trumpet of the
[1:20:25] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[1:20:27] seventh month
[1:20:29] so we see here revelation 10 7 okay
[1:20:32] please read
[1:20:34] just putting some foundations here
[1:20:36] in the day of atonement shall you make
[1:20:38] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[1:20:40] land
[1:20:41] and you shall howl the 50th year and
[1:20:43] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[1:20:46] and to all the inhabitants thereof it
[1:20:48] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[1:20:51] return every man unto his possession and
[1:20:54] ye shall return every man into his
[1:20:56] family a jubilee shall be the fiftieth
[1:20:58] year be unto you ye shall not sow
[1:21:00] neither reap that which grow it off
[1:21:02] itself in it nor gather the grapes in it
[1:21:05] of divine undressed for it is the
[1:21:08] jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye
[1:21:10] shall eat the increase thereof out of
[1:21:12] the field and in the year of this
[1:21:15] jubilee ye shall return every man unto
[1:21:18] his possession
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] another scripture in john 8
[1:21:26] verse 31.
[1:21:44] then jesus
[1:21:46] then said jesus to those jews which
[1:21:48] believed on him if you continue in my
[1:21:50] word then are ye my disciples indeed
[1:21:54] and ye shall know the truth and the
[1:21:56] truth shall make you free
[1:21:58] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[1:22:01] and we were never in bondage to any man
[1:22:04] house saith thou ye shall be made free
[1:22:06] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[1:22:09] unto you whosoever committed sin is the
[1:22:11] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[1:22:13] not in the house forever but the son
[1:22:16] abideth ever
[1:22:17] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:22:22] ye shall be partially free you shall be
[1:22:24] 99.9
[1:22:26] no ye shall be free indeed
[1:22:31] hallelujah may god add the blessing to
[1:22:34] the reading of his word let's pray
[1:22:36] precious heavenly father
[1:22:38] lord once again we want to give you all
[1:22:41] the glory father

[1:22:53] all those that have labored for this
[1:22:55] weekend i pray may you give them a
[1:22:57] special blessing lord may you bless
[1:22:59] brotherhood sister root father lord may
[1:23:01] you watch over them lord and how
[1:23:04] thankful we are father to have been
[1:23:06] standing together here on the
[1:23:07] battlefield lord and father for the
[1:23:09] blessing lord through the vessel lord so

[1:23:29] oh lord make yourself real to each and
[1:23:31] every one father it may it not be just

[1:23:36] may each and every one receive his
[1:23:38] liberty his freedom lord that you have

[1:23:43] control father i surrender lord and may
[1:23:46] you speak through the vessel we pray and
[1:23:48] ask these things in jesus christ's name
[1:23:50] amen and amen
[1:23:52] god bless you you may be seated
[1:23:56] amen for a title tonight
[1:24:01] i was listening to this song and i said
[1:24:03] no they're
[1:24:04] they're taking my sermon
[1:24:08] for a title
[1:24:10] the bride's jubilee is a reality
[1:24:14] amen we sung the song my jubilee so it's
[1:24:18] something personal my jubilee
[1:24:20] amen there where the spirit of the lord
[1:24:22] is there's liberty amen so our worship
[1:24:25] is not to bring us back to a souza
[1:24:27] street or no no it's not just an emotion
[1:24:30] or an excitement no but it's it's the
[1:24:33] word of god the opening of the word that
[1:24:35] produces
[1:24:37] that
[1:24:38] the dynamics on the mechanics but how
[1:24:41] thankful we are amen for the true
[1:24:43] jubilee
[1:24:44] if we look up in the in the lexicon in
[1:24:46] hebrew it says yobel means trumpet the
[1:24:49] greek lexicon
[1:24:50] says
[1:24:51] release from bondage
[1:24:53] forgiveness or pardon
[1:24:55] letting them go as if they had never
[1:24:58] been committed
[1:24:59] amen so therefore i'm gonna put bring a
[1:25:02] parallel now we read amen 10 7
[1:25:05] revelation 10 7 amen
[1:25:08] and god is so good because the prophet
[1:25:11] could say it's like you've never done in
[1:25:13] the first place
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:16] the definition of jubilee amos is a
[1:25:19] season or occasion of joyful celebration
[1:25:23] so i don't want to see any sad face this
[1:25:25] is an opening service but it's not an
[1:25:27] opening service amen it's a continuation
[1:25:30] amen it's a book of acts that is being
[1:25:32] written so it's from glory to glory and
[1:25:35] glory to glory if you don't want it i
[1:25:38] will take it
[1:25:41] amen amen 50 years is gold
[1:25:45] this is a golden time in the world they
[1:25:47] speak it's it's a horrible time this is
[1:25:49] a golden time for us for the bride amen
[1:25:53] brother branham says 50 means jubilee 50
[1:25:56] is god's jubilee number the word
[1:25:58] pentecost means 50. so let it be another
[1:26:01] pentecost this after this weekend
[1:26:04] jubilee means the going up
[1:26:06] the release
[1:26:10] oh that's the jubilee i want
[1:26:12] that's the jubilee i want
[1:26:14] amen we can look into sabbath the
[1:26:16] sabbath means arrest
[1:26:19] amen then brother abraham says the holy
[1:26:21] spirit is the sabbath
[1:26:23] amen so we're gonna we're gonna just
[1:26:26] amen travel along through the scriptures
[1:26:28] if that is okay
[1:26:30] amen and for the americans i i did some
[1:26:32] research for the our dear friends from
[1:26:34] the united states who cross the border
[1:26:38] i will have a big amen on that one we'll
[1:26:41] see the
[1:26:43] yeah
[1:26:45] the liberty bell
[1:26:48] was
[1:26:49] a symbol of the american independence
[1:26:53] the first time it was rang was on july 8
[1:26:57] 1776
[1:26:59] and it was to summon the people to hear
[1:27:01] the declaration of independence
[1:27:03] and on that bell was written a part of
[1:27:06] leviticus 25 10. it says proclaim
[1:27:10] liberty throughout all the land unto all
[1:27:13] the inhabitants thereof so a country can
[1:27:17] proclaim liberty
[1:27:18] and people rejoice about it people oh
[1:27:21] they have a big party because we are
[1:27:23] free i mean we can hear wars rumors of
[1:27:26] wars and and and we're sad and we pray
[1:27:28] for our beloved ones there and the
[1:27:30] saints there and when a people is an
[1:27:32] oppression
[1:27:34] yes people live
[1:27:36] under fear and all this but then when
[1:27:38] the liberty is proclaimed it's a time of
[1:27:41] great celebration amen but i'm not here
[1:27:44] to ring the liberty bell of the united
[1:27:46] states i'm here to proclaim the liberty
[1:27:49] that god has given us amen and we're
[1:27:52] gonna pray we're gonna ring that bell so
[1:27:54] loud through the weekend aiming that
[1:27:57] each and every one can receive the
[1:27:59] liberty
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:03] hallelujah
[1:28:05] glory
[1:28:07] so my liberty
[1:28:10] make it personal
[1:28:12] we know brother branham speaks about
[1:28:13] seven sabbats
[1:28:15] which is the seven church ages now the
[1:28:18] jews they have been blinded and they're
[1:28:19] waiting all this time while the
[1:28:21] pentecostal first fruits has been poured
[1:28:24] out upon the church amen so through the
[1:28:27] ages amen the pentecost of first fruits
[1:28:30] have been poured out
[1:28:32] and here we are
[1:28:33] here we are
[1:28:34] my what a celebration amen in return and
[1:28:38] jubilee and brother branham says as a
[1:28:40] type we're going to use israel
[1:28:43] because
[1:28:44] amen it's a jubilee time and the church
[1:28:47] was given a portion
[1:28:49] which was who christ himself
[1:28:52] that was poured out by the holy spirit
[1:28:55] into each heart that would receive it
[1:28:58] and then become sons of god
[1:29:02] listen now
[1:29:03] we're building up now
[1:29:05] israel was a servant to god and was
[1:29:08] given a possession
[1:29:10] okay
[1:29:12] and this possession
[1:29:14] was not given to anyone else
[1:29:18] oh i love that
[1:29:20] so when satan comes around he tries to
[1:29:23] steal your blessing tries to steal your
[1:29:25] possession
[1:29:28] the jubilee trumpet sounds
[1:29:32] and when i hear the word of god i can
[1:29:34] claim my god-given rights
[1:29:38] oh glory glory
[1:29:41] if someone
[1:29:43] or an individual lost their inheritance
[1:29:46] that was given to them by god
[1:29:50] so it's not any inheritance that god
[1:29:52] it's given by god
[1:29:55] it's about time we wake up
[1:29:59] the awakening of the bride is a reality
[1:30:04] the bride's jubilee is a reality
[1:30:06] not an emotion not something
[1:30:08] manufactured it's a reality
[1:30:14] glory
[1:30:15] so if any individual lost their
[1:30:18] inheritance given by god there came a
[1:30:20] year called the jubilee year
[1:30:23] and every seven years there was a
[1:30:25] sabbath and this jubilee every man that
[1:30:28] had lost his inheritance every man
[1:30:34] i'm looking to
[1:30:38] by some means
[1:30:40] if he was a free born
[1:30:47] brother branham says
[1:30:48] we are not born to be in bondage to be
[1:30:51] slaves
[1:30:53] we are born to be sons and daughters of
[1:30:56] god
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:02] freeborn and true-blooded israelites
[1:31:06] brother branham would say i'm not born
[1:31:09] charles alaba and branham
[1:31:13] i come from god i go back to god
[1:31:18] glory
[1:31:20] so no matter who held the possession he
[1:31:23] it had to go back to him free
[1:31:26] he didn't have to pay anything
[1:31:28] he didn't have to do a thing
[1:31:31] but just stop what he was doing and go
[1:31:33] back to his inheritance it was a
[1:31:35] god-given right because by grace
[1:31:39] he inherited it
[1:31:43] so no matter what had taken place so no
[1:31:46] matter what has taken place before you
[1:31:48] arrive here
[1:31:52] if he lost it
[1:31:53] it must go free because it meant grace
[1:31:56] is a way provided for each individual
[1:32:00] to return to their rightful inheritance
[1:32:04] my
[1:32:06] the jubilee is god's manner of
[1:32:08] expressing grace to his people i love
[1:32:12] that
[1:32:14] i love that
[1:32:16] for restoring or peop or be brought back
[1:32:18] to their rightful position
[1:32:22] our rightful position in jesus christ
[1:32:29] now i believe that this is the hour
[1:32:31] again of jubilee i believe it's the time
[1:32:34] of jubilee says a prophet
[1:32:41] now a man and his family could go back
[1:32:43] to their original inheritance
[1:32:46] if they could hear the jubilee
[1:32:49] now we know revelation speaks about he
[1:32:51] that had an ear let him hear what the
[1:32:54] spirit says and to the churches
[1:32:59] so lord
[1:33:00] let my spiritual ear be so sensitive
[1:33:03] when the word comes forward i don't want
[1:33:05] to be busy with all kinds or going
[1:33:07] around with all my mind battles all
[1:33:09] kinds of thoughts i want to receive
[1:33:12] if only a word i know my life can be
[1:33:16] changed
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:23] so if he could hear the jubilee the
[1:33:25] trumpet sound
[1:33:26] and know what it meant to them
[1:33:29] the priest brother brown calls it the
[1:33:31] jubilee priest
[1:33:33] the jubilee priest
[1:33:35] let's sound a trumpet meeting service
[1:33:37] after service service after service
[1:33:43] amen the jubilee priests sound the
[1:33:44] trumpet the minister the trumpet is a
[1:33:46] gospel so no matter where they're lost
[1:33:49] how far they went back
[1:33:52] listen now how far you went back
[1:33:55] doesn't matter
[1:33:57] whatever they had to do they had the
[1:34:00] privilege
[1:34:01] we have the privilege tonight to be in
[1:34:05] the presence of god almighty
[1:34:10] to come and receive again their
[1:34:12] inheritance
[1:34:14] come on mom and dad listen to this
[1:34:17] the whole family could come
[1:34:19] and receive their inheritance
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:25] you have a way we're trying the way
[1:34:27] we're dotted it doesn't matter it's your
[1:34:29] inheritance it's your possession
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:35] glory
[1:34:37] came many many men
[1:34:41] or
[1:34:42] there's the other crowd
[1:34:44] that have walled themselves
[1:34:46] so far
[1:34:48] that they want to listen
[1:34:50] to
[1:34:50] what somebody
[1:34:52] says about it
[1:34:55] instead of listening to thus say it the
[1:34:58] lord
[1:35:00] you know i'd rather listen to somebody
[1:35:03] who might have a clearer understanding i
[1:35:05] might listen to somebody who got a
[1:35:08] revelation or some kind of doctrine or
[1:35:10] whatever nonsense
[1:35:12] give me the pure word
[1:35:14] god send me a vindicated prophet
[1:35:17] for who for me
[1:35:19] [Applause]
[1:35:21] for my jubilee
[1:35:26] hallelujah thine of glory
[1:35:28] now is the hour of jubilee
[1:35:32] come on now is the hour of jubilee
[1:35:36] come on church
[1:35:38] don't put it on tomorrow tomorrow we'll
[1:35:40] have another jubilee
[1:35:42] now is the hour of jubilee
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:35:52] come back to your original
[1:35:54] inheritance to a real holy ghost again
[1:36:01] and outside of the pure word
[1:36:04] you won't have a real holy ghost you can
[1:36:06] have sensation you can have emotions you
[1:36:09] can have all kinds of goosebumps or hair
[1:36:12] coming like this and all kinds of things
[1:36:15] but it's not a true
[1:36:17] real baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:22] now you could go free didn't have to pay
[1:36:26] anything didn't have to do nothing just
[1:36:28] get up and go that's all he had to do
[1:36:30] amen if he knew the sound of the trumpet
[1:36:34] but he had to know the sound of the
[1:36:36] trumpet for they were sons of god
[1:36:44] now you know a trumpet can sound
[1:36:46] many ways
[1:36:47] in the army a trumpet can sound and it's
[1:36:50] one sound to call you let's come and
[1:36:53] dine
[1:36:54] another sound just to wake you up
[1:37:00] or another sound for
[1:37:02] the raising of the flag
[1:37:06] but the jubilee trumpet had a sound
[1:37:09] a clear sound
[1:37:11] not an uncertain sound it was a sound
[1:37:14] from god himself
[1:37:19] and the people knew when i hear that
[1:37:21] sound
[1:37:23] the scene in me knows when i hear that
[1:37:25] sound
[1:37:26] no matter where i'm at i hear the sound
[1:37:30] i can go free
[1:37:32] i be
[1:37:33] i can be delivered i can be healed
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:40] ma
[1:37:42] but it's individual
[1:37:44] it's your jubilee
[1:37:48] let's come back to to israel moses
[1:37:51] receives the promise
[1:37:52] go deliver my people
[1:37:56] they go out
[1:38:00] now the front of this
[1:38:02] nice country
[1:38:03] moses couldn't go there's joshua and
[1:38:06] caleb
[1:38:08] the land where it's flowing of milk and
[1:38:10] honey
[1:38:12] brother says you've been on this
[1:38:13] mountain long enough but come on
[1:38:16] let's go over
[1:38:19] let's possess our inheritance
[1:38:22] it's time to rise to be sons of god in
[1:38:26] the name of jesus christ and rise to a
[1:38:28] place so you can return in this jubilee
[1:38:32] and hear the sound of the trumpet of the
[1:38:34] gospel of the word of god
[1:38:39] you are brethren
[1:38:40] not a denomination
[1:38:42] you are born sons and daughters of god
[1:38:46] but if the slave wants to stay a slave
[1:38:50] let him be let him stay in these walled
[1:38:53] cities
[1:38:56] but you are free he says
[1:39:00] let's go back to our inheritance let's
[1:39:02] go back to the beginning
[1:39:04] let's go back to what we were from the
[1:39:07] beginning
[1:39:09] an attribute of god we come from god we
[1:39:12] go back to him
[1:39:15] now
[1:39:17] joshua
[1:39:20] he didn't have the poor me attitude
[1:39:24] he didn't have the grasshopper attitude
[1:39:29] he didn't have the defeat attitude
[1:39:36] i'm making it personal now
[1:39:38] how do we come to church
[1:39:41] oh
[1:39:41] poor me
[1:39:44] no not poor me
[1:39:46] joshua said we're more than able
[1:39:50] you think joshua didn't have eyes
[1:39:53] oh yes you did he even knew very well
[1:39:55] how thick the walls were
[1:39:58] god always does
[1:40:00] like brother joe would say incredible
[1:40:02] math
[1:40:07] so here we have joshua how can i destroy
[1:40:10] the walls
[1:40:12] the land is ours the promise is ours
[1:40:15] god gave it to us but how can i possess
[1:40:18] the land there has to be a way that
[1:40:21] these walls these seals can open
[1:40:27] if those seals don't open
[1:40:30] i won't see my full possession i won't
[1:40:32] see my true identity i won't see my full
[1:40:35] inheritance
[1:40:40] so what does he do
[1:40:42] we never pray enough so he goes that's
[1:40:45] biblical huh
[1:40:46] he goes to prayer
[1:40:48] and here he meets someone the angel of
[1:40:51] the lord
[1:40:52] he has his sword drone
[1:40:54] are you for me or against me
[1:40:58] i'm the captain here
[1:41:02] i'm the captain here and i'm in charge
[1:41:04] of this
[1:41:05] so joshua
[1:41:07] you're going to follow me
[1:41:09] i'm leading this battle
[1:41:12] our lord is mighty in battle
[1:41:16] glory glory glory
[1:41:19] amen even brother branham himself needed
[1:41:22] the angel to come down
[1:41:27] he says it himself for those that want
[1:41:30] to make from brother branham a god and
[1:41:31] with all due respect but he isn't god
[1:41:35] he said if the angel wouldn't have come
[1:41:37] i would have told you a terrible mistake
[1:41:44] so no one is worthy
[1:41:46] to take the book to open the seals
[1:41:49] thereof
[1:41:50] only the lamb
[1:41:52] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:41:54] is worthy to take the book and to open
[1:41:57] the seals thereof so no man can claim
[1:42:03] my revelation
[1:42:06] god keeps up to himself
[1:42:11] so this is not a revelation
[1:42:13] of brother branham
[1:42:17] come on
[1:42:20] this is not brother branham's property
[1:42:23] or anybody's property
[1:42:25] this is god's property
[1:42:32] some people don't like it but it's the
[1:42:33] truth anyway
[1:42:36] i'll be gone in a few days so
[1:42:40] the word is god's property
[1:42:43] and he reveals his own word
[1:42:48] so god himself chose his bride
[1:42:53] just like i explained there's a
[1:42:54] connection love
[1:42:56] appreciation respect
[1:42:58] i mean
[1:43:00] that's what god he chose his bride
[1:43:04] it's not a person it's not a group it's
[1:43:06] not a headquarters
[1:43:08] god himself so now during those seven
[1:43:10] church ages they have been walking in
[1:43:13] silence around the walls
[1:43:16] and here comes the seven church age
[1:43:18] and it says but in the days of the voice
[1:43:22] when he will begin to sound
[1:43:25] the mystery of god shall be finished
[1:43:28] shall be revealed shall be made clear
[1:43:32] christ revealed
[1:43:34] amen it shall be finished these walls
[1:43:36] these seals shall be opened
[1:43:41] these thunders
[1:43:42] will utter their voices
[1:43:45] whoo
[1:43:48] and you will have a jubilee
[1:43:51] not a man made you believe
[1:43:53] not from a man somewhere in the country
[1:43:55] or so no
[1:43:57] a real jubilee from god himself
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:08] for some there's still silence
[1:44:11] but for the bride the silence is broken
[1:44:15] for the bride it is a rejoicing time
[1:44:18] it is a jubilee time
[1:44:20] oh hallelujah
[1:44:23] there has been a message
[1:44:25] of resurrection
[1:44:27] a rapture message an adoption message
[1:44:30] given to his bride
[1:44:33] that's why in the seventh time while
[1:44:35] there is shouting
[1:44:37] and these walls are coming down
[1:44:40] i don't want to go ahead
[1:44:42] building up
[1:44:44] let's go back to our origin
[1:44:50] the young people sung about it
[1:44:52] failure
[1:44:53] failure won't define me
[1:44:59] although satan comes around and he says
[1:45:01] you did you've done this you've done
[1:45:02] that you did this you did that
[1:45:05] your background is this your background
[1:45:07] is that
[1:45:08] failure won't define me i am a son of
[1:45:11] god i am a daughter of god
[1:45:14] amen and it's about time we don't just
[1:45:17] say things but we believe what god amen
[1:45:21] it's not what satan says what anybody
[1:45:23] says in what god says about me
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:29] glory glory
[1:45:31] amen amen amen so what happens when god
[1:45:34] sends a jubilee in them days
[1:45:37] listen the god that sends a jubilee in
[1:45:39] them days
[1:45:40] is the same god that sends the jubilee
[1:45:43] today
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:47] all the ones that were in captivity
[1:45:49] didn't have to pay any price they could
[1:45:51] absolutely go free
[1:45:55] but it was their choice choose ye this
[1:45:59] day
[1:46:02] tonight
[1:46:03] you can be delivered
[1:46:05] tonight you can be healed
[1:46:08] tonight you can be sealed
[1:46:10] oh i just want to wait until brother
[1:46:12] rombro the team brotherhood
[1:46:14] no tonight
[1:46:16] you can be delivered
[1:46:26] glory
[1:46:29] now
[1:46:30] those that didn't want to go free
[1:46:33] what happened
[1:46:34] the master would take an owl bore the
[1:46:36] ear
[1:46:38] which marked them to serve their master
[1:46:41] forever
[1:46:43] you know why it was put on the ear
[1:46:47] because hearing faith cometh by hearing
[1:46:50] hearing of the word of god so to reject
[1:46:55] the message to reject the resurrection
[1:46:58] message the rapture message the jubilee
[1:47:00] message
[1:47:01] the word of god
[1:47:04] is being bored in the ear
[1:47:07] and be spiritually deaf that's why we
[1:47:10] have all this nonsense everywhere on on
[1:47:12] the internet so don't even waste your
[1:47:14] time
[1:47:15] amen brother sorry brother tim to
[1:47:18] mention that but people try to write you
[1:47:20] know all kinds of males and tried to
[1:47:22] provoke we don't even want to waste time
[1:47:24] on it
[1:47:26] i'm getting ready we're getting ready to
[1:47:28] leave here
[1:47:30] there'll still be fussing and the
[1:47:32] rapture will be gone already
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:39] so tonight
[1:47:41] if you want to run
[1:47:42] don't run outside
[1:47:44] run to jesus
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:47] if you want to doubt doubt the devil
[1:47:53] if you want to hide hide in the word
[1:47:57] because there's no time for wasting
[1:48:01] jesus is the way the truth and the lies
[1:48:05] there's one way that's jesus
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:11] he came down listen
[1:48:13] he came down in a blood cell
[1:48:16] not through a man but by the holy ghost
[1:48:19] and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for
[1:48:22] the purpose of death was build
[1:48:26] so let's look at the resurrection a
[1:48:28] moment is that okay
[1:48:32] the value
[1:48:33] i heard
[1:48:34] can't remember who but i heard
[1:48:37] somebody say the value of something
[1:48:40] is the price somebody is willing to pay
[1:48:44] hmm you can think about that
[1:48:49] and you can think what he has done for
[1:48:51] me
[1:48:51] for us
[1:48:53] that's the value that's your value
[1:48:56] that's how he saw us
[1:48:59] so let's never take things for granted
[1:49:02] or just an ordinary service or something
[1:49:04] commonly no
[1:49:06] god is so good to us
[1:49:11] so we can look into the gospels
[1:49:14] there's the four gospels and we can see
[1:49:16] that they all
[1:49:18] tell us the stories what happened around
[1:49:21] jesus where jesus was so they all have
[1:49:24] different perspectives of what's going
[1:49:26] on
[1:49:27] now some tell it a certain way others is
[1:49:30] not her for example there's only in john
[1:49:32] that you will read about lazarus
[1:49:36] but
[1:49:38] there's one thing they have in common
[1:49:41] that is the resurrection message
[1:49:44] they all write it
[1:49:47] what happened
[1:49:49] so it must be something quite important
[1:49:53] jesus told exactly what would happen
[1:49:56] he told it to his disciples for the sake
[1:49:58] of time you can read it in matthew 16 21
[1:50:01] where he says and i'm gonna be killed
[1:50:02] and be raised again the third day
[1:50:04] he told it even to the pharisees
[1:50:07] but they were not listening to the sound
[1:50:10] of the trumpet
[1:50:13] they didn't want it because it was out
[1:50:14] of their
[1:50:16] you know
[1:50:17] they were so blocked chained by
[1:50:19] traditions
[1:50:23] but even there they heard it matthew 27
[1:50:25] says saying sir we remember that the cv
[1:50:28] the deceiver said while he was yet alive
[1:50:30] after three days i will rise again
[1:50:34] and people hear the word of god
[1:50:36] and they just want to continue
[1:50:40] but not for me
[1:50:44] it's my jubilee
[1:50:47] you want you don't want your jew it's my
[1:50:49] jubilee
[1:50:52] so the resurrection message
[1:50:54] was didn't start by the disciples
[1:50:58] it started by jesus himself
[1:51:04] god keeps that to himself
[1:51:06] because he doesn't want anybody to
[1:51:08] interfere with whatever it's only after
[1:51:11] in the book of acts that you see the
[1:51:12] disciples amen writing about amen and
[1:51:16] the book of acts
[1:51:18] didn't stop didn't end
[1:51:22] hey
[1:51:23] we are living a book of acts
[1:51:28] so now paul says
[1:51:31] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[1:51:33] jesus shall raise up us also by jesus
[1:51:36] and shall present us with you in one
[1:51:39] peter 1 it says blessed be the god and
[1:51:42] father of our lord jesus christ which
[1:51:44] according to his abundant mercy had
[1:51:46] begotten us unto a lively hope
[1:51:49] by the resurrection of jesus from the
[1:51:52] dead to an inheritance
[1:51:58] incorruptible and undefiled
[1:52:01] and that faded not away
[1:52:04] reserved in heaven for you
[1:52:07] [Applause]
[1:52:09] where is the you group here
[1:52:13] wonderful
[1:52:15] so the resurrection the rapture message
[1:52:18] is not an ending it's not a conclusion
[1:52:21] it's a climax
[1:52:26] revelation 1 18 says i am alive
[1:52:29] forevermore
[1:52:31] paul tells us in 1 corinthians 15 but if
[1:52:34] there be no resurrection of the dead
[1:52:35] then christ is not risen and if christ
[1:52:37] be not risen then is our preaching in
[1:52:39] vain and your faith is also in vain
[1:52:43] there was a resurrection
[1:52:45] so god intended for man of god to preach
[1:52:49] the word
[1:52:52] not to push play and obey
[1:52:54] hey
[1:52:56] sorry brother tom brother and
[1:53:00] hey it might set somebody free
[1:53:02] that's what it's all about
[1:53:05] satan has bound so many people
[1:53:08] by all kinds of ids of men doctrines of
[1:53:10] man while the trumpet the sound of
[1:53:13] freedom has been proclaimed
[1:53:23] the rest
[1:53:25] in hebrews 4 there remain and therefore
[1:53:27] arrest a sabbath to the people of god
[1:53:29] for he that has entered into his arrest
[1:53:31] he saw he also had cease from his own
[1:53:34] works and guarded from his so the rest
[1:53:37] is a confirmation
[1:53:40] and makes you a witness of the
[1:53:42] resurrection
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:45] now follow me
[1:53:46] it's just some teaching
[1:53:49] building up
[1:53:51] so when that happens it's not
[1:53:53] my daddy told me that
[1:53:55] my redeemer lived
[1:53:57] it's not a testimony of someone that
[1:53:59] told me god is alive
[1:54:02] i
[1:54:03] know
[1:54:04] my redeemer liveth
[1:54:07] i know he is alive tonight
[1:54:11] hey man he's living in me
[1:54:13] i feel him in my hands i feel him in my
[1:54:16] feet i feel him all over me
[1:54:22] god's not dead he is alive
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:30] because i live
[1:54:33] ye shall live also
[1:54:37] i am the messiah
[1:54:39] and you're messiest
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] hallelujah
[1:54:46] matthew 21 1 says if the in the end of
[1:54:50] the sabbath as it began to dawn toward
[1:54:52] the first day of the week now listen
[1:54:56] we're going to continue i want to stay
[1:54:57] on that for a while
[1:54:59] the sabbath ends at sun down when the
[1:55:02] sun goes down
[1:55:05] when the sun comes up
[1:55:07] that's the witness of a new day
[1:55:10] now we know the jews they didn't name
[1:55:13] their their days and and but matthew
[1:55:15] here he wants to make sure that
[1:55:18] everybody would recognize
[1:55:22] what they were talking about
[1:55:25] this marks a changing of time
[1:55:28] this will be the last sabbath
[1:55:34] where
[1:55:35] we will bring lambs bring doves we'll
[1:55:38] bring saba so after this sabbath it will
[1:55:41] never be the same
[1:55:46] because
[1:55:48] a perfect lamb
[1:55:50] was slain
[1:55:51] for me
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:56] there's a new covenant a new day
[1:55:59] this sunday
[1:56:00] proved that god is almighty
[1:56:09] now let's look for a little while
[1:56:12] what we find at the tomb
[1:56:15] okay
[1:56:16] the first witnesses of the resurrection
[1:56:21] were women
[1:56:23] we know in the bible
[1:56:26] women
[1:56:27] represent a church
[1:56:29] a type
[1:56:31] so the first witnesses of the
[1:56:32] resurrection is the church
[1:56:37] what are they doing there
[1:56:40] they have seen him lay him in the tomb
[1:56:42] they saw him crucified they saw all the
[1:56:44] events happening
[1:56:47] the following day
[1:56:48] they come with spices to anoint him
[1:56:52] they are mourning
[1:56:56] they go there out of love
[1:57:00] out of sympathy
[1:57:03] they love jesus
[1:57:04] they go there
[1:57:07] but they haven't went there for a
[1:57:10] resurrection message
[1:57:14] and maybe some are here tonight
[1:57:18] and you have come out of love for your
[1:57:19] mom for your dad
[1:57:21] or maybe out of love and sympathy for
[1:57:24] for for brother ed and sister rude
[1:57:26] because it's a an anniversary
[1:57:29] but god has other plans for you
[1:57:32] you will hear the resurrection message
[1:57:36] you will feel the resurrection power
[1:57:41] stop limiting god
[1:57:43] [Applause]
[1:57:44] stop making your own programs
[1:57:47] and surrender to god
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:56] isn't it something while they were on
[1:57:57] their way
[1:57:58] the bible says in march 16 2 and verily
[1:58:01] early in the morning the first day of
[1:58:02] the week they came into the sepulcher at
[1:58:05] the rising of the sun
[1:58:09] and they said among themselves who shall
[1:58:12] roll away the stone from the door of the
[1:58:15] poker so here we have these women
[1:58:19] all kinds of mind battles
[1:58:22] here we have the spices we have we will
[1:58:24] do all we can all we have
[1:58:27] out of love
[1:58:29] but
[1:58:30] what will happen
[1:58:33] who will roll away that stone
[1:58:39] they were walking in darkness they were
[1:58:41] waiting for the rising of the natural
[1:58:43] sun
[1:58:45] but they are fixing to be witnesses of
[1:58:47] the resurrection
[1:58:50] of the rising of the son
[1:58:57] they don't even know that something
[1:58:58] happened already to that stone
[1:59:01] during that time
[1:59:03] you know satan tries
[1:59:05] to attack the word every time
[1:59:09] he tried even while jesus was here
[1:59:12] that's the antichrist spirit that we can
[1:59:14] see working all over the world
[1:59:17] but god's spirit is here and he raises a
[1:59:19] standard
[1:59:23] so during that time we can see in
[1:59:25] matthew 26 pilate said unto them you
[1:59:27] have a watch go your way make it as sure
[1:59:30] as he can
[1:59:33] stupid devil
[1:59:37] so they went and made the sepulcher sure
[1:59:40] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[1:59:44] they couldn't see it enough
[1:59:47] god is almighty and he will always break
[1:59:50] the seal to prove his resurrection
[1:59:56] my god is awesome
[1:59:59] mighty in battle
[2:00:01] woo
[2:00:02] hallelujah matthew 28 2.
[2:00:05] we're building up here now
[2:00:07] matthew 28 2
[2:00:09] and behold there was a great earthquake
[2:00:12] for the angel of the lord descended
[2:00:16] revelation 10 1 and another mighty angel
[2:00:19] descended
[2:00:21] glory another an angel from the lord
[2:00:24] descended from heaven and came and
[2:00:26] rolled back the stone from the door and
[2:00:28] sat upon it
[2:00:33] come on church
[2:00:36] my god is almighty
[2:00:38] [Applause]
[2:00:40] what rome what satan has sealed
[2:00:43] god just sits on it
[2:00:48] satan tries to keep you bound
[2:00:52] but jesus set me free
[2:00:54] satan tries to keep you down
[2:00:57] but satan is finished because jesus
[2:01:00] proclaimed me free
[2:01:03] glory

[2:01:48] surroundings

[2:02:06] there was a real trembling taking place
[2:02:10] they ended up dead
[2:02:18] couldn't stop the angel from coming down
[2:02:22] and opening that seal
[2:02:25] and he couldn't stop the angel from

[2:12:08] and jesus says let me go to them i'm
[2:12:10] going to instruct them for 40 days to
[2:12:13] cast out devils it didn't end with the
[2:12:15] disciples at that time
[2:12:18] [Laughter]

[2:12:39] ones will come die hey we're gonna be
[2:12:40] preaching here's brother branham ma

[2:12:48] brother david i hear now the critics say
[2:12:50] brother david i'll wait until you know
[2:12:52] what you won't see them
[2:12:54] you won't see them because it's only the
[2:12:57] elect it's only the bride that will see
[2:13:00] them oh my
[2:13:05] if you've never shouted before

[2:13:10] my hallelujah
[2:13:13] when i because i live

[2:13:23] my thank you jesus
[2:13:26] thank you lord
[2:13:28] hallelujah amen when he died amen and he
[2:13:32] shed his blood listen the perfect life
[2:13:35] of god was liberated
[2:13:40] the perfect life of god was liberated to
[2:13:44] come back upon the sinner who would
[2:13:48] accept the christ as his savior
[2:13:52] ma
[2:13:54] so how are we
[2:13:56] responding
[2:13:59] to the jubilee trumpet
[2:14:01] to the freedom trumpet
[2:14:04] all that god was he emptied in christ
[2:14:06] all the great eternals of god was
[2:14:09] emptied in christ and all that christ
[2:14:11] was he emptied into the church
[2:14:14] and man and woman are afraid to claim
[2:14:18] their god-given privilege and stand upon
[2:14:21] the truth of it
[2:14:23] not what you think not what satan says
[2:14:25] not what anybody says but what the truth
[2:14:28] what the word of god says about you
[2:14:34] we have the privilege to enforce upon
[2:14:38] satan the claims that god has given us
[2:14:42] my
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:48] therefore we have the right to force
[2:14:50] these claims upon satan
[2:14:56] and say give it back
[2:14:59] [Applause]
[2:15:01] i heard the trumpet sound
[2:15:04] this is my inheritance
[2:15:06] this is my property
[2:15:08] get it behind me
[2:15:12] some of you were at camp and some of you
[2:15:15] have written something on the soul
[2:15:17] because that's where satan belongs but
[2:15:19] it's about time maybe you rewrite
[2:15:22] something
[2:15:23] and start putting satan under your feet
[2:15:28] well brother david i was not camp don't
[2:15:30] you worry you got your time now this is
[2:15:33] the hour of jubilee
[2:15:35] this is the hour of jubilee

[2:15:41] rory give it back
[2:15:43] and he has to do it

[2:15:54] ma
[2:15:58] hallelujah
[2:16:06] [Music]
[2:16:11] and if that ain't enough
[2:16:16] we can take god's agent
[2:16:18] the holy spirit
[2:16:20] go route that right down on our knees
[2:16:23] and say it's the say of the lord he's
[2:16:26] got to give up that's all
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:34] hallelujah
[2:16:38] that's all cause the holy spirit is
[2:16:40] there to make him do it
[2:16:43] this ain't your
[2:16:44] battle he proclaimed me free
[2:16:48] he gave me an open book
[2:16:51] he broke the seals at all
[2:16:53] therefore my jubilee
[2:16:56] i can rejoice i can be glad
[2:17:00] word he is the lamb
[2:17:02] he alone is worthy
[2:17:05] [Applause]

[2:17:09] living in a jubilee
[2:17:12] i'm living my jubilee

[2:17:17] this book of acts is a reality
[2:17:21] amen you heard testimony testimony not

[2:17:44] again
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:47] it's not our claim it's our claim
[2:17:49] because god gave it
[2:17:53] by his stripes we are healed
[2:17:55] [Applause]
[2:17:57] amen brother on
[2:18:00] [Applause]
[2:18:05] i prayed and it didn't happen and
[2:18:09] there's this poor me attitude
[2:18:14] joshua went there
[2:18:16] with a victorious attitude
[2:18:23] he knew in who he believed
[2:18:26] and i'll send my angel before thee
[2:18:31] glory
[2:18:33] thank you jesus
[2:18:35] amen he was wounded for our
[2:18:37] transgressions by his stripes we are
[2:18:38] healed
[2:18:40] and the lawgiver the holy spirit himself
[2:18:43] listen the lawgiver
[2:18:45] not satan
[2:18:48] that's the nonsense giver
[2:18:51] the liar giver
[2:18:55] come on
[2:18:57] that's what he is
[2:18:58] that's his nature
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:02] he can seem very honest
[2:19:07] very truthful
[2:19:09] quote 99.9 percent of the truth
[2:19:13] but he's still a liar
[2:19:15] he's still a liar
[2:19:17] but here
[2:19:18] [Applause]
[2:19:19] the law giver the holy spirit himself is
[2:19:23] here the agent of god to see that it's
[2:19:27] done that way amen
[2:19:33] ma
[2:19:34] you want to talk about a jubilee
[2:19:38] that's a true jubilee
[2:19:40] because when this trumpet was sound when
[2:19:48] they put down everything
[2:19:50] if you wanted to be free
[2:19:54] you could continue
[2:19:56] and keep on
[2:19:58] slave massacre
[2:20:00] but it's up to you
[2:20:02] each and every one
[2:20:06] so i don't want to look to my mom look
[2:20:09] to my dad look to my brother look to my
[2:20:10] sister it's me myself and i
[2:20:16] to take a step
[2:20:19] and say this is my jubilee
[2:20:23] this is my liberty
[2:20:26] this is my freedom
[2:20:30] whom the son
[2:20:31] has set free is free indeed
[2:20:35] and he oh my
[2:20:37] brother branham says once
[2:20:41] once he was freed
[2:20:43] he could never be a slave no more
[2:20:48] hallelujah
[2:20:51] you never have to live under the yoke of
[2:20:53] bondage my god has set me free
[2:21:00] therefore it's not an excitement oh yeah
[2:21:03] i can act excited but it's the reality
[2:21:08] the jubilee of the bride is a reality
[2:21:12] hallelujah
[2:21:14] we've got the authority by jesus christ
[2:21:17] that's the reason
[2:21:19] demons scream
[2:21:23] [Applause]
[2:21:25] are you hearing me
[2:21:26] [Applause]
[2:21:28] that's the reason
[2:21:31] demons scream
[2:21:34] it's about time we give them
[2:21:38] a good whipping
[2:21:44] enough is enough
[2:21:47] satan had me bound
[2:21:49] but jesus set me free
[2:21:55] oh brother david that's not a deep
[2:21:57] message oh yes it is
[2:21:59] because satan tries to keep you bound
[2:22:01] satan tries to keep you in bondage
[2:22:04] try to do everything
[2:22:07] to stop you from praising worshiping god
[2:22:10] receiving the word receiving the
