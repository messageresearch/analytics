[0:01] I
[0:03] [Music]
[0:22] Amad praise the Lord is that a
[0:25] revelation to you
[0:31] one of the children was singing that
[0:34] chorus Jesus loves even me and they they
[0:39] they thought it was just Eve and
[0:42] them so they doesn't Jesus love anybody
[0:46] else just even me oh well he loves us
[0:51] all Amen brother maddin and sister
[0:54] Sandra of their family here with them
[0:58] but they've come to dedicate their
[1:00] daughter
[1:01] Anna so I
[1:03] said what are her other names I said
[1:06] that's it Anna and of course Anna one of
[1:12] the uh at least it's one of the names
[1:15] that means
[1:17] Grace So when you say Anna and that's
[1:20] enough we can say grace and that's
[1:22] that's
[1:23] it amen that's
[1:26] sufficient I have a I have a scripture
[1:29] I've never never use the scripture in
[1:31] fact is I mostly have a different
[1:33] scripture each time and as I thought
[1:36] about this little one which we saw just
[1:39] a short time ago in your home as our
[1:42] sister Sandra prepared a nice dinner for
[1:44] us and we spoke
[1:46] together but there's a scripture and
[1:48] it's in
[1:50] Proverbs and it says this the just man
[1:55] walketh in his
[1:57] Integrity his children are blessed after
[2:00] him and before I came to the scripture I
[2:04] thought rather than just having a
[2:06] dedication I was
[2:08] feeling uh an
[2:11] Impulse I wanted to bless this child and
[2:15] I thought how will we not just dedicate
[2:18] the child Anna but bless
[2:20] her and as I looked into it and saw that
[2:26] that's exactly what this scripture means
[2:27] I was directed to this scripture
[2:30] the just man walketh in his Integrity
[2:33] the just man that's a righteous man a
[2:36] man that conducts himself and his
[2:39] character in a righteous way a man that
[2:42] is
[2:43] Justified know that he's
[2:46] Justified and uh and then they see he
[2:49] walks in his
[2:52] Integrity he walks in his in a in a
[2:56] completeness in a fullness in a full
[2:59] assurance
[3:00] and in this scripture it is that he
[3:02] walks in his innocence and he walks in
[3:05] his Simplicity and I have found as I
[3:08] read the scripture and went into all the
[3:11] various components of it I have found
[3:14] that they were applicable to our brother
[3:15] maddin and his good wife sister
[3:18] Sandra he walks in his Integrity he
[3:21] walks in Simplicity before God he walks
[3:24] as a burden man and to be a witness for
[3:27] Christ and then the scripture
[3:30] says his children are blessed after
[3:35] him and uh the blessedness that comes
[3:38] from a man that walks in his Integrity
[3:41] before God the blessedness that we can
[3:44] bless this child with is that it is a
[3:48] life of
[3:50] Happiness blessed are
[3:53] they it is an assurance that they shall
[3:56] go straight they're
[3:58] blessed they they will progress on they
[4:01] will
[4:02] advance they will make
[4:05] progress says pronounce them happy
[4:08] that's exactly what I was feeling in my
[4:10] heart pronounce them happy and call them
[4:14] blessed because they have righteous
[4:18] parents and a father to head a home and
[4:20] to train them up in the way that they
[4:22] should go and so today our prayer of
[4:26] dedication is not merely going to be a
[4:28] dedication to the Lord but a
[4:31] pronouncement because they have
[4:33] righteousness in the
[4:35] home they have justification in the home
[4:38] and the presence of the Living God in
[4:40] the home amen so we're going to bless
[4:45] Anna you come to me
[4:48] Anna not
[4:52] really amen I'll pray for her heavenly
[4:57] father as I
[5:00] am surrounded with this lovely
[5:03] family and my precious brother madin and
[5:07] his wife sister
[5:09] Sandra you've given them a daughter and
[5:12] they felt to call this child Anna Grace
[5:17] I pray oh God that you will bless this
[5:20] child and father as they dedicate her to
[5:23] you we do not just dedicate her to you
[5:26] but we bless her in the name of the Lord
[5:28] Jesus Christ
[5:30] we bless her in the name of God of
[5:32] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[5:35] Jacob the god that has brought this
[5:39] couple to Salvation and to Redemption
[5:42] and Lord we dedicate this gift back to
[5:44] you yes we give her to you this is
[5:47] what's in the hearts of the father and
[5:49] the mother and you have given her to
[5:51] them and now we give her back to you and

[5:56] we pronounce a blessing oh god of
[5:58] salvation

[13:26] SE
[13:30] [Music]
[13:39] word
[13:41] hallelujah all right if you would turn
[13:43] in your Bibles please to the book of
[13:46] Zechariah Chapter 4 we will begin to
[13:52] read they consider it one of the Minor
[13:55] Prophets and while you're looking for
[13:59] Zachariah right after habac or hagay I'm
[14:02] sorry Zephaniah
[14:05] Hagi
[14:09] zachari
[14:11] now for many of you perhaps this is uh
[14:15] you wouldn't be aware of this but the
[14:19] book of Ezra and Nehemiah which we know
[14:22] are restoration books recording the
[14:26] restoration and recording the people
[14:29] coming back from Babylon after their
[14:33] captivity there was not only Ezra a
[14:36] scribe and
[14:38] Nehemiah but
[14:40] Hagi
[14:42] Zachariah and Malachi and also the Book
[14:46] of Esther are all involved with a return
[14:50] from
[14:51] Babylon back to Jerusalem back to
[14:56] Judah and so all these books record
[15:00] events that were taking place at that
[15:02] time and you'll find in the book of Ezra
[15:05] for example you'll
[15:07] find uh the you'll find some statements
[15:11] that are made regarding zerubabel which
[15:14] is a main figure in the book of
[15:16] Zachariah and so these people were all
[15:19] involved at that time and we're going to
[15:22] read out of Zachariah now starting in
[15:24] the fourth
[15:25] chapter and the angel that talked with
[15:28] me came
[15:29] again and wake me as a man that is
[15:32] wakened out of his asleep and said unto
[15:35] me what seest thou and I said I have
[15:37] looked and behold a Candlestick all of
[15:40] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[15:44] his seven lamps there on and seven pipes
[15:47] to the seven lamps which are upon the
[15:50] top thereof and two olive trees by it
[15:54] one upon the right side of the bowl and
[15:56] the other upon the left side there are
[15:59] so I answered and spake to the angel
[16:02] that talked with me saying what are
[16:04] these my Lord then the angel that talked
[16:08] with me answered and said unto me
[16:11] knowest thou not what these be and I
[16:13] said no my Lord then he answered and
[16:16] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[16:18] the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by
[16:22] might nor by power but by my spirit
[16:25] sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh
[16:28] great Mountain before zerubabel Thou
[16:31] shalt become a plain and he shall bring
[16:33] forth The Headstone thereof with
[16:36] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it
[16:40] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[16:42] me saying the hands of zerubabel have
[16:45] laid the foundation of this house his
[16:48] hands shall also finish it and thou
[16:52] shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath
[16:55] sent me unto you for who hath disp R the
[16:59] day of small things so many things that
[17:01] God does begin small for they shall
[17:04] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[17:07] hand of zerubabel with those seven which
[17:10] are the eyes of the Lord which run to
[17:13] and fro through the whole earth God
[17:16] bless you you may be
[17:24] seated I pray that God will give a
[17:26] special Grace today
[17:29] we just need a special Grace I would
[17:32] like to Carry On from last week but I
[17:35] don't have any idea how we're going to
[17:38] tie it in but I so that's where I trust
[17:41] that God will just bring it to you
[17:44] sometimes it seems like it's just a
[17:46] whole lot of Burden that's on your heart
[17:49] and things that you see the message is
[17:51] so
[17:53] expansive the message is so enlightening
[17:57] it is it is it is so gripping because of
[17:59] its enormity it's so it just
[18:04] so covering all aspects of of of time
[18:09] and and our life and our especially of
[18:12] the day that we're in and so I'm just
[18:14] praying that God
[18:16] will help me to bring this to you now
[18:20] the Apostle
[18:22] Paul uh in Corinthians he related to the
[18:26] Corinthians uh some of the events that
[18:28] happened with the children of Israel and
[18:30] in the Old
[18:31] Testament and he said to them all these
[18:35] things happened unto them for our
[18:38] ensamples or our
[18:41] example and they are written for our
[18:44] admonition upon whom unto whom the ends
[18:48] of the world are come so the things that
[18:52] took place in the Old Testament and
[18:55] happened with God's
[18:57] people uh
[18:59] they are not just isolated events it's
[19:03] very important it's not just something
[19:05] that happened to the children of Israel
[19:07] or happened to the Jews or happened to
[19:12] uh uh you know the the people that live
[19:15] back there and that it has no further
[19:17] reference because so many times those
[19:20] events actually have a compound meaning
[19:22] it happen in a natural way but it has a
[19:25] a a spiritual a profound spirit
[19:28] spiritual application and that is
[19:32] exactly what I want to refer to this
[19:34] morning and when Apostle Paul said that
[19:38] uh that these things uh are for our
[19:42] admonition it is for our understanding
[19:46] and more than just a mental concept but
[19:49] it is that our mental and
[19:52] intellectual mind our faculties will
[19:56] gain understanding and furthermore
[19:59] that by the power of considering and
[20:02] judging
[20:03] soberly calmly and impartially it's the
[20:07] fact of perceiving things and if we
[20:10] perceive Divine things spiritual things
[20:13] it should have an effect upon our life
[20:16] and so i' i' I've condensed it into this
[20:19] these few
[20:20] words we see and I'm talking about
[20:23] spiritually see the example that's what
[20:26] I hope we see in the in the script
[20:28] scripture today and by using God's
[20:32] Divine powers that has given to us and
[20:36] as we consider the example and ponder
[20:39] it seriously that we will receive Divine
[20:46] understanding to do the right thing to
[20:50] make the right choice that our lives may
[20:53] be guided correctly and if we were
[20:56] becoming kind of der or off track that
[21:00] the things we hear the things that we
[21:02] see in the in the example as we Ponder
[21:06] the example we say that example fits
[21:10] today even though that was centuries ago
[21:13] that fits perfectly today and God
[21:16] allowed those things to happen for your
[21:20] admonition but even if it is for our
[21:23] admonition you have to consider it you
[21:25] have to ponder it you have to uh
[21:27] seriously think think about it and say
[21:29] God allowed that to happen for my
[21:32] admonition that my life can be
[21:36] instructed so we are going to look at
[21:38] some of the events in the Old Testament
[21:41] that have a direct reference to our time
[21:44] and that is always the challenge it's a
[21:46] challenge for me and it's a challenge
[21:48] for you the greater challenge for myself
[21:51] as I Ponder these things I always think
[21:54] how will I bring those things from the
[21:57] past up for forward to this time and
[21:59] make them pertinent to our our
[22:03] environment and the things that happen
[22:04] to us because there are so many things
[22:07] that are in our language you can't find
[22:09] those words in the Bible there are
[22:11] things which you know we rub shoulders
[22:13] with every day and you can't find a a
[22:17] spiritual scripture that actually has
[22:19] direct reference to it but yet by the
[22:22] Holy Spirit there are things and that is
[22:25] why it's so essential that a prophet can
[22:28] reach into into the scripture and bring
[22:30] forward those scriptures to our
[22:32] attention that we can ponder those
[22:35] scriptures but we know that when God
[22:37] sends a voice sends a message sends a
[22:39] messenger then we know what comes from
[22:42] his mouth is pertinent to our time and
[22:45] the things that we may encounter in the
[22:48] direct in immediate
[22:50] future we looked last week and spoke
[22:53] on King
[22:56] Hezekiah and the the evil conditions of
[22:59] his time because his father was a wicked
[23:02] King in fact as they' had a series of
[23:05] wicked Kings and I believe he was the
[23:07] 13th King from uh uh from the time of
[23:12] the dividing from Solomon and out of
[23:15] Solomon then Solomon's son rabom and his
[23:18] servant Jobo and the the nations were
[23:22] divided into uh into 10
[23:26] into 10 were given to jobal and one was
[23:30] actually given to riab and there's one
[23:33] because there's there's 12 but I just
[23:35] want to I'm going to just show you a
[23:37] number of slides here uh to kind of set
[23:40] the scene because under Hezekiah he
[23:43] wasn't influenced by his father he was
[23:46] just a young man 25 years old when he
[23:49] came to the throne and at 25 it was
[23:53] really amazing of
[23:55] the uh the the cleans cing and the
[23:59] purging and the purifying that he did in
[24:03] Israel so you see the uh you see where
[24:06] Jerusalem is here in the in the green
[24:10] portion and so this area here you see is
[24:14] the kingdom of
[24:16] Judah and then these others the kingdom
[24:19] of Moab Moab which of course came from
[24:24] lot's uh two daughters Moab and Ammon
[24:28] then we have the Kingdom of Israel so
[24:31] now Dan is up here to the north and
[24:34] beerse is way down to the South so this
[24:37] is the northern kingdom and this is the
[24:40] other Kingdom now Babylon is way over
[24:44] here and so the king of Babylon actually
[24:48] the king of Egypt from the south down
[24:51] here came and he raided and besieged
[24:54] Jerusalem and uh and then and he took a
[24:58] King one of the Kings down there and
[25:00] then after that was a succession of a
[25:03] couple other kings and the king of
[25:05] Babylon from over here came and took
[25:09] took uh took these tribes first and took
[25:12] a bunch of them into captivity and then
[25:14] came and besieged Jerusalem and that's
[25:16] kind of where we're going to be but I
[25:18] want to I want to go through the
[25:20] scriptures so we get a an idea of what
[25:24] actually Hezekiah did and I have made
[25:27] this brief the reign of the king of
[25:29] Hezekiah and the return to God this is
[25:32] from 2 Chronicles the 29th chapter and
[25:35] he did that which was right in the sight
[25:37] of God in his first year of his Reign
[25:40] and in the first month opened opened the
[25:43] doors of the house of the Lord and
[25:45] repaired them I would like you to when
[25:47] we just read these don't read them as
[25:48] just a as just scriptures and events but
[25:52] think about what was involved this was
[25:55] over a period of years a number of years
[26:02] and he brought in the priests and the
[26:04] Levites and gathered them together and
[26:07] said unto them hear me ye Levites
[26:10] sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the
[26:13] house of God the Lord God of your
[26:16] fathers and carry forth the filthiness
[26:19] out of the Holy
[26:22] place now it is in my heart to make a
[26:26] covenant with the Lord God of Israel
[26:28] Israel that his Fierce wrath may turn
[26:30] away from us then Hezekiah the king Rose
[26:34] early and gathered the rulers of the
[26:36] city and went up to the house of the
[26:39] Lord and all the congregation worshiped
[26:42] and the singers sang and the trumpeter
[26:45] sounded and all this continued until the
[26:48] burnt offering was finished and when
[26:50] they had made an end of the offering the
[26:52] king and all that were present with him
[26:55] bowed themselves and worshiped is not a
[26:58] marvelous record for a young man this is
[27:01] listen this is in God's word this is
[27:04] God's word God gave this testimony of
[27:07] this young man this young king and I
[27:09] thought he did uh really some
[27:12] remarkable remarkable things so they
[27:15] established a decree to make
[27:18] Proclamation through all Israel from
[27:20] Bersa even to Dan that is from the north
[27:24] down to berseba in the South that they
[27:27] should come to keep the Passover under
[27:29] the Lord God of Israel all of them in
[27:32] the North had gone into idolatry all of
[27:34] them in Judah had gone into idolatry he
[27:36] had one king after another you'd have
[27:38] almost thought what is the use but he
[27:40] was as a young man was determined to
[27:42] follow the things of God and to bring
[27:45] blessing upon upon
[27:48] Israel and he established the he
[27:50] established the Passover and he invited
[27:53] all of those were up to the north to
[27:55] come down and keep the Passover at
[27:57] Jerusalem M for they had not done it of
[28:00] a long time in such a sort as it was
[28:04] written and the Lord hearkened to
[28:07] Hezekiah and healed the people so there
[28:11] was great joy in Jerusalem for since the
[28:14] time of Solomon the son of David king of
[28:17] Israel there was not the like in
[28:21] Jerusalem isn't that
[28:23] marvelous Hezekiah then as I ended last
[28:26] Sunday and spent some time on it that he
[28:28] made his grave error and it was how be
[28:31] it in the business of the ambassadors of
[28:34] the princes of Babylon who sent unto him
[28:38] to
[28:39] inquire of the wander that was done in
[28:42] the land god left him to try him that he
[28:46] might know all that was in his heart
[28:49] Babylon was established in the Book of
[28:52] Genesis Babylon is in the middle of the
[28:55] it's in the first of the Bible it's in
[28:57] the last of the the Bible and it's in
[28:59] the Book of Revelation Babylon goes that
[29:03] whole spirit and that whole event of
[29:06] Babylon and what it represents goes it's
[29:08] present in our time and it goes beyond
[29:11] us so it's not something that was is
[29:14] historical it's something that's very
[29:16] very present and that is why we want to
[29:19] uh make some references to it but God
[29:22] left him to to try him that he might
[29:26] know all that was in his heart and
[29:30] Hezekiah hearkened unto these
[29:32] ambassadors from Babylon and showed them
[29:35] all the house of his precious things the
[29:37] silver and the gold and the spices and
[29:40] the precious ointment and all the house
[29:42] of his armor and all that was found in
[29:45] his treasures there was nothing in the
[29:48] in his house nor in all his Dominion
[29:51] that hazekiah showed them
[29:54] not then came Isaiah the prophet unto
[29:57] King King Hezekiah and said unto
[30:01] him what said these men and from whence
[30:05] came they unto thee and Hezekiah said
[30:07] they come from a far country even from
[30:10] Babylon and he said what have they seen
[30:12] in thine house and Hezekiah sh answered
[30:16] all the things that are in my house have
[30:19] they seen there is nothing among my
[30:22] treasures that I have not showed
[30:25] them and Isaiah said unto Hezekiah
[30:28] hear the word of the Lord behold the
[30:30] days come that all that is in thine
[30:32] house and that which thy fathers have
[30:35] laid up in store unto this day shall be
[30:38] carried into Babylon and nothing shall
[30:42] be left sayith the
[30:45] Lord and of thy sons that shall issue
[30:49] from thee which Thou shalt beget shall
[30:52] they take away and they shall be Unix in
[30:55] the Palace of Babylon
[30:58] then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah good is
[31:01] the word of the Lord still a hell is
[31:03] righteous hell is righteousness which
[31:06] thou Hast spoken and he said is it not
[31:09] good if peace and Truth be in my
[31:16] days I want to just perhaps I'll I'll
[31:20] take that back a moment and refer to it
[31:23] in just a
[31:26] moment now
[31:29] the
[31:30] era
[31:32] of
[31:35] Hezekiah you cannot Escape that it was a
[31:38] time of
[31:39] blessing I just want to go very slowly
[31:42] now it was a time of prosperity it was a
[31:46] time when treasures and gifts and things
[31:49] were laid up in
[31:52] Israel and this is a
[31:56] time uh that this is a this is a type of
[32:01] scene
[32:03] that had was
[32:06] repeated and it was repeated in our
[32:10] time
[32:12] in brother brandom's
[32:18] Ministry broke on the world
[32:21] scene just after the second world
[32:25] war the Second World War was a
[32:29] catastrophic
[32:31] event there was more people
[32:35] died in the second world
[32:38] war than had ever happened in the entire
[32:42] history of mankind you have to believe
[32:46] that that was a major event brother
[32:48] brandham speaks about the second world
[32:50] war as a second birth pain I have found
[32:54] many other ministers pick up and use
[32:56] that and I can only believe that they
[32:58] actually got it from his
[33:02] message and he speaks and he even I even
[33:04] saw where another gentleman I want to
[33:07] get don't want to get into it at all but
[33:08] he's a great Apostle Prophet of another
[33:12] organization and he even describes
[33:14] exactly as brother Brandon describes how
[33:16] that birth pains coming upon a woman and
[33:20] travail and they come
[33:23] faster as the birth is getting ready to
[33:26] take place and with a greater
[33:30] intensity the second world
[33:34] war was a worldwide
[33:37] conflict that was fought from 1939 to
[33:40] 1945 those six
[33:43] years and armed forces from over 70
[33:47] Nations engaged in this
[33:50] war Aral Naval and groundbased
[33:56] combat spanning much of the
[33:59] globe World War I resulted in the deaths
[34:04] of
[34:05] over you ready 60 million
[34:10] people in six
[34:13] years 10 million a year 60 million is
[34:18] greater than Many Many Nations that
[34:21] exist today in six years the blood of 60
[34:26] million people was spilled
[34:28] and the prophet comes and lets us know
[34:31] this was a second birth pain and he said
[34:35] in the message the first world war
[34:38] showed great birth pains it showed one
[34:41] of the first birth Pains of her going
[34:44] into
[34:45] labor because of that time for her we
[34:49] had brought forth the bombs and we had
[34:52] machine guns and poison gas he says and
[34:55] we find out now that we've had a second
[34:58] world war now I want you to know he's
[35:00] speaking these words and his ministry
[35:03] although the prophet of God registered
[35:06] many visions and things that God had
[35:08] told him from
[35:09] 1933 yet from 1933 up until after the
[35:13] second birth pain his ministry is not
[35:16] Thrust out into the Earth he's preaching
[35:19] but it's not Thrust out into a global I
[35:22] will call it the
[35:24] globalization of the Gospel
[35:27] and after it's it's less than 24 months
[35:31] it's about 22 months after the war was
[35:35] over from the time it closed with dday
[35:38] in June of
[35:40] 1945 from that time the prophet's
[35:44] Ministry within 22
[35:46] months it was overspreading the earth
[35:50] and beginning to God released it as it
[35:54] were to the
[35:55] world and in that short period period of
[35:58] time from
[36:00] 47 48 and 49 there were some great men
[36:05] that were leaving the scene Smith
[36:08] Wigglesworth passed away in
[36:10] 1949 called an apostle of Faith great
[36:13] man of God and others were just fading
[36:16] off the scene and God was bringing a
[36:18] whole new era it is also referred to in
[36:23] Professor Harold's book all things are
[36:26] possible professor Herald of Birmingham
[36:28] Alabama and he calls it and and I I and
[36:32] brother Lonnie had dinner with him here
[36:34] he called me you saw that I used his
[36:37] name on the radio broadcast and flew up
[36:40] here he was going to San Francisco to
[36:42] speak at a conference and he said he'd
[36:44] like to spend some time and we came up
[36:46] here he came up here specifically to
[36:48] speak about brother bram's
[36:51] Ministry and he has said he's made some
[36:55] comments statements about about brother
[36:58] bram's Ministry but he he said he found
[37:00] that there was a a sweep Over America
[37:03] that changed the face of America and he
[37:06] calls it the Revival from 1948 to 1958
[37:10] and he's a historian a professor of of
[37:15] uh Biblical history and he determined
[37:18] that it was a very unique time and so I
[37:23] will be focusing on some of that time so
[37:26] now what we have we have the the Earth
[37:27] coming out of the world coming out of
[37:30] one of its greatest and the greatest in
[37:34] all of history the greatest troubled
[37:37] time in a short six years birth pain and
[37:41] the prophet said it almost gave way
[37:44] because they had an atomic bomb that had
[37:46] been developed and you must remember the
[37:49] countdown that spiritual things are
[37:52] taking place in concert with natural
[37:56] things
[37:58] you believe that all right and he goes
[38:02] on to say now she must give way he said
[38:05] the second world war he said and her
[38:07] pains were much greater more terrific
[38:10] all the time the birth Pains of the
[38:14] earth she almost had to give away during
[38:18] the time of the atomic bomb because it
[38:21] would destroy a whole city it was much
[38:25] greater than the Pains of the first
[38:27] World War of destruction of the earth he
[38:30] said now she knows she must give away
[38:35] she cannot stand it Russia I believe
[38:38] would destroy this nation today if she
[38:41] thought that she could destroy it and
[38:42] then and then and then preserve
[38:45] herself some might here might be
[38:48] inclined to think well that was in the
[38:50] era of the Soviet Union and it was a
[38:53] great powerful superpower and it's
[38:54] nothing today don't you believe it
[38:58] you want to see uh you want to see the
[39:00] video of the general of all of all the
[39:03] atomic forces of America and the general
[39:07] of the atomic forces of Russia and they
[39:11] said you think that Dan Rather was
[39:14] conducting the uh the
[39:16] interview and the general from Russia
[39:20] came to America and the general from
[39:22] America was uh the general from Russia
[39:27] was reciprocal in his invitation and had
[39:29] the general from United States who was
[39:31] over all
[39:33] all nuclear power in the air in the
[39:36] ocean in the land in the silos and then
[39:39] they were comparing and they showed they
[39:42] took the Russian general right into the
[39:44] mountain in Colorado and the American
[39:48] General five-star general went right
[39:51] into the nerve center and that Nerf
[39:54] Center while America has it in a
[39:56] mountain in color
[39:58] in Russia it happens to be right on the
[40:02] I understand on the north side of the
[40:04] outskirts of Moscow and they always
[40:06] refer to it as Moscow brother branaman
[40:09] speaking in Phoenix he said they can
[40:12] unleash a a missile and he didn't say
[40:16] Russia this time he said from
[40:19] Moscow and landed on Fourth Street here
[40:23] in Phoenix I tell you what friends you
[40:26] don't want to take too lightly what a
[40:28] prophet of God
[40:31] speaks it is dead
[40:33] accuracy it may sound like it's in
[40:37] generalities but it's deadly accurate
[40:40] and we're deadly serious about it do you
[40:43] believe
[40:44] it and he
[40:46] says and listen to this
[40:49] now it's in
[40:53] 1965 she could if she could preserve
[40:56] herself listen to this
[40:59] statement any of those little
[41:02] Nations could do it back then there was
[41:06] no little Nation to my knowledge that
[41:09] had any nuclear power it probably was
[41:12] only United States and
[41:15] Britain and perhaps Russia maybe three
[41:19] that were part of that and now here's a
[41:22] prophet speaking in the future tense and
[41:26] it sounds like he's speaking right as of
[41:29] that time any of those little Nations
[41:32] could do it but they're afraid because
[41:34] they know that this world cannot stand
[41:37] in its orbit under such conditions and
[41:41] so the world knows that her birth pains
[41:44] is so great she's got to give away
[41:47] there's going to be a new birth born at
[41:51] hand and I'm thankful for that I'm tired
[41:54] of this one can we all say Amen to that
[41:57] I say if you're happy with this world
[41:59] you can have it you can take this whole
[42:02] world Give Me Jesus Christ give me the
[42:05] new one give me the Rapture you can have
[42:08] this old body I'll take the next one
[42:11] I'll take the one that's beside me I'll
[42:14] take the word body that I skipped around
[42:16] because of Eden's
[42:20] sin said anyone knows here it's a place
[42:23] of death and sorrow and all kinds of
[42:26] discrepancy
[42:27] and so forth and I'm glad that you have
[42:30] to give away I'm glad that time is at
[42:33] hand as John said of old even so come
[42:38] Lord Jesus and I believe we can all say
[42:40] Amen to
[42:43] that now brother brandham turns to the
[42:47] spiritual aspect of this which I've just
[42:51] read and I would like to insert right
[42:55] here that even though I've described now
[42:58] the war and described that event and
[43:02] described the prophet's Ministry now
[43:04] starting to overspread the earth I want
[43:06] you to understand that it was also a
[43:10] Time according to history it was a time
[43:14] of spiritual outpouring and there was
[43:17] and and brother Brandon refers to it all
[43:19] through the messages and hundreds of
[43:21] other ministers refer to it as the
[43:24] restoration of the gifts the Revival of
[43:26] the restoration ation of the gifts now
[43:29] follow this very closely this is perhaps
[43:32] like a a Sunday school lesson but it's
[43:34] going to be quite intense and I want you
[43:37] to be able to hang
[43:39] on uh to to the statements that I'm
[43:42] making and I'm I'm just being hesitant a
[43:45] wee bit because I want to make it
[43:48] carefully in the Book of Ruth and as you
[43:52] know the Book of Ruth is the book of
[43:55] redemption you know that it pointed
[43:57] directly to this time and between the
[44:00] church ages if I had the messages were
[44:02] spoken by the prophet in the church ages
[44:06] notice now you've heard me say it many
[44:08] times but I need to say it again in
[44:10] reference to my few comments in just a
[44:13] moment the church ages church is always
[44:16] a woman church is in the feminine gender
[44:20] it's not masculine gender so it's in the
[44:23] church ages or the time of the woman the
[44:26] church Church ages and then come the
[44:29] opening of the seals brother brandham
[44:31] never said he made statements about the
[44:34] opening of the seals that he never made
[44:35] about the church ages he said the seals
[44:38] was Christ taking the seals off of
[44:41] himself he said he said the the the
[44:44] seals that was Christ himself never said
[44:47] that about the church ages so you have
[44:50] the time or the era of the women of the
[44:53] woman which was right from Pentecost
[44:55] where the church was born until now at
[44:58] the end and the Earth is entering into
[45:01] birth pain and soon after another great
[45:04] birth pain and since then they've been
[45:06] trying to control the powers that could
[45:09] destroy and annihilate the entire world
[45:13] and you know they have that it's it's
[45:15] not something in the future it's sitting
[45:17] in the Earth right now it's under the
[45:20] ocean right
[45:22] now and in that same time God sends out
[45:26] m
[45:27] Messengers and he pours out a spirit of
[45:30] a restoration of the gifts gifts
[45:33] Treasures so it is now a comparison to
[45:37] hezekiah's time under Hezekiah there is
[45:41] a a tremendous uh uh blessing of God
[45:45] upon the nation upon what he was doing
[45:47] under his Reign and treasures were
[45:50] heaped up in fact is they had such they
[45:53] had such blessings and you can read it
[45:55] in Chronicles I believe it is and the
[45:57] people brought in from their uh from
[46:01] their wealth and so on and they brought
[46:03] in until there were heaps and they
[46:05] didn't even know what to do with
[46:07] everything that came in they and they
[46:09] had these heaps and they had to build
[46:10] storehouses for all of the heaps of the
[46:13] Grain and the wealth and all of these
[46:15] things the blessing was so happening if
[46:17] you go to the Book of Ruth and you find
[46:20] out where the messenger where Boaz Boaz
[46:24] comes to the field in the evening even
[46:27] and Jesus said the field is the world is
[46:30] the Earth and so Boaz as as Christ
[46:34] coming I mean he's in the kingly
[46:38] lineage hasn't come to David yet but the
[46:41] kingly lineage is coming
[46:44] on and it's and before the king can come
[46:48] into the Millennium where the king he
[46:51] will be son of David and prior to that
[46:54] it must be Boaz must must come and
[46:57] redeem a gentile bride who's in the
[47:01] earth who's actually she is in a state
[47:06] of almost starvation she is in a state
[47:09] of just trying to survive but she
[47:11] happens to be in that state in an era
[47:15] when there's great
[47:20] blessing and Boaz comes to the field and
[47:23] the field is the world and the Earth the
[47:27] field was full of
[47:29] Reapers full of
[47:31] preachers full of people gathering in
[47:34] the Harvest it was not a time of famine
[47:37] they had come from where her husband had
[47:39] died had come from a place of famine had
[47:42] come and they were still suffering the
[47:44] after effects the after effects of
[47:47] having a husband who could a
[47:50] denomination who couldn't give them
[47:54] seed and they were in another country
[47:56] and Ora's husband died Naomi's husband
[48:01] died Ruth's husband died and Ora went
[48:05] her way back to her gods and Ruth said
[48:08] to Naomi your God will be my
[48:11] God and your people will be my people
[48:15] and where you live that's where I'll
[48:17] live where you die that's where I'll die
[48:20] she was so committed to it and she comes
[48:23] back and here here it just so happens
[48:26] isn't it wonderful it just so
[48:30] happens aren't you thankful that a Time
[48:33] came in your life it just so happened
[48:35] you came under the eye in the eyesight
[48:38] of Boaz and he looked down at you and he
[48:41] says to his servant now and when Boaz
[48:44] comes now here's Boaz coming moving
[48:46] towards the Earth coming into the field
[48:49] and he says to all of the Reapers the
[48:51] Lord bless thee you're
[48:55] blessed and they said
[48:57] and your and bless and blessings to you
[49:01] so it was a time of spiritual
[49:05] Prosperity I'm not talking about dollars
[49:07] I'm talking about spiritual
[49:09] outpouring and when the prophet's
[49:11] Ministry even though he begins to see
[49:14] visions and all of that and has that
[49:16] spiritual dimension in his ministry it
[49:19] does not break on the earth till after
[49:22] the second birth
[49:24] pain because there had to be a certain
[49:27] era that it would be
[49:47] released is it all
[49:51] right can I write can I just read some
[49:54] of my notes to you that I felt very
[49:57] inspired and I just penned them and I
[50:00] read them before I came to the
[50:03] pulpit and I
[50:05] thought those are very very
[50:10] inspired I'm actually I haven't given
[50:12] you the title of my message but the
[50:14] title of my message is from Jerusalem to
[50:18] Babylon and
[50:22] back from Jerusalem to Babylon and back
[50:26] because that's precisely what
[50:30] happened Hezekiah was a king and needed
[50:34] God's Prophet to come to
[50:37] him and God's Prophet came to him only
[50:40] when he began to show all his treasures
[50:42] and his
[50:44] gifts and the things that God had so
[50:46] blessed him
[50:51] with although the condition of
[50:53] hezekiah's time repeated again
[50:57] the restoration of the gifts and it it's
[50:59] many dozens of times that the prophet
[51:03] makes that reference not only David
[51:06] Harold Professor Harold but all manner
[51:10] of Ministries all recognize that it was
[51:13] a time of the restoration of the gifts
[51:15] now hold
[51:17] that and it was the
[51:20] gifts that
[51:22] Pentecost really was they were being
[51:25] poured out from 1906 but now was a
[51:28] restoration of the gifts it was
[51:31] something that was a a remarkable world
[51:35] event not something just happening in
[51:36] Aza Street not something just happening
[51:39] in Los Angeles or a few cities in
[51:41] America but now it was poured out over
[51:44] the whole
[51:45] earth a
[51:49] globalization of the gifts
[51:58] I know that I don't expect you to just
[52:01] grasp where I'm
[52:03] going but as you follow along very
[52:05] carefully you'll
[52:08] see one of the
[52:12] things the first thing that the prophet
[52:15] breaks on the scene how he's had Visions
[52:17] all these years but now
[52:19] 1947 is the first taped message that you
[52:25] have and the first thing that the
[52:28] prophet the very first thing that
[52:30] establishes him as a
[52:32] prophet is that he has a a remarkable
[52:38] gift and it's he'll have a sign the
[52:41] angel says you'll have a sign in your
[52:44] hand like Moses you'll have two signs
[52:46] and if the people won't believe the
[52:48] voice of the first sign they will
[52:51] believe the voice of the second they
[52:53] will have to believe it because you'll
[52:55] know the very secrets of their their
[52:56] hearts so now here comes a a time after
[53:00] the second birth pain and the and the
[53:02] ministry is being thrusted over spread
[53:04] the earth and the tool that God uses is
[53:09] a sign which is a a gift that has never
[53:12] been expressed this way and he begins to
[53:16] show and demonstrate the gift and now he
[53:19] wants to show it to everybody and
[53:22] explain it to them and the angel rebukes
[53:26] him
[53:28] for showing the sign to the people don't
[53:32] try to explain it because you'll only
[53:35] bring a bunch of
[53:37] impersonations and he said it did bring
[53:40] a bunch of
[53:41] impersonations and the angel rebuked him
[53:44] for trying to explain it trying to make
[53:47] it trying to show it to a bunch of
[53:51] heathens and so he is now trying to tell
[53:56] the Pentecostal
[53:59] movement and warn
[54:02] them that this is not something and they
[54:05] said oh oh because at the same time I'm
[54:10] going to give you some dates now at the
[54:12] same time now here's an era the prophet
[54:16] the birth pain comes and the prophet's
[54:19] Ministry breaks onto the Earth and at
[54:21] the same time Billy graes Ministry
[54:24] breaks onto the earth and the same time
[54:26] time or Robert's Ministry breaks onto
[54:28] the Earth and a prophet is coming and
[54:30] saying there has to be two Messengers to
[54:33] Sodom to the
[54:35] world and he said nobody has it down
[54:38] like Billy Graham on the on a
[54:43] repentance and to turn people away from
[54:46] sin in the fundamental of repentance no
[54:49] one has it down like him and these
[54:51] Messengers went out but now Pentecost is
[54:55] being God has pouring out the
[54:58] gifts and I was in
[55:01] it and I can preach this because I know
[55:05] exactly what I'm talking about and I
[55:08] started myself becoming troubled because
[55:12] the Pentecostal Brethren that I was with
[55:15] and here here they began to be swallowed
[55:19] up and they began to feel they began to
[55:23] be
[55:24] impressed that others of the world and
[55:28] the
[55:30] denominations who had their idolatrous
[55:33] religions now begin to look into
[55:38] Judah and see that they were blessed
[55:42] with gifts and
[55:45] treasures and they said we want that we
[55:50] could use that and where did that desire
[55:53] how far did it reach right to the the
[55:59] Vatican right to
[56:03] Babylon and God sent a prophet brother
[56:06] brandham didn't need a prophet because
[56:07] he was a prophet Hezekiah needed a
[56:10] prophet to tell
[56:12] him who did you
[56:15] receive well I received celebrities I
[56:19] received great
[56:21] people from where from a far country
[56:25] even Babylon
[56:28] and what did they say and what did you
[56:30] do he said I showed them all my gifts I
[56:34] showed them all my treasures I showed
[56:37] them everything God has blessed me with
[56:40] and he says and those those gifts are
[56:43] going to go right back to
[56:46] Babylon and your sons who you have
[56:50] progyny from they're going to go back
[56:53] there
[56:54] too and there came a real alliance
[56:57] between Babylon and
[56:59] Hollywood in case you don't know it and
[57:03] I tell you those gifts went straight
[57:05] back into the denominations and the
[57:07] prophet is screaming out and telling
[57:10] them can't you see can't you understand
[57:13] when the foolish virgin gets stirred and
[57:16] comes for the oil she does not get
[57:23] it got a gift and that is why as a young
[57:28] Minister been ministering for several
[57:30] years and
[57:33] sitting with brother brandham just
[57:35] across from me and he went like
[57:39] this this is a gift of William brandham
[57:44] this is not William
[57:50] brandham and Pentecost could never get
[57:52] that separated oh because I speak in
[57:55] tongues because I got the gift of
[57:56] Prophecy or the gift of this or the gift
[57:58] of something else I've got the Holy
[57:59] Ghost no you've got a gift of the Holy
[58:03] Ghost and the prophet had to come and
[58:05] say it he said justification made way
[58:08] for sanctification and sanctification
[58:11] made way for the Holy Spirit the baptism
[58:14] which is a gift of the Holy Spirit but
[58:16] he says and the baptism of the Holy
[58:19] Spirit made way for the Holy Ghost
[58:23] himself but the Holy Ghost himself
[58:26] happens to be the author of this word
[58:29] and the author of this word has laid
[58:31] down baptism in the name of the Lord
[58:33] Jesus Christ baptism in water in the
[58:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the author
[58:39] the Holy Ghost you can receive a gift of
[58:41] the Holy Ghost and be baptized in the
[58:43] name of father son Holy Ghost which
[58:45] there is no
[58:47] name but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[58:51] is the person himself
[59:09] I want to just
[59:10] establish brother bram's ministry here
[59:12] and then we're going to go on to some
[59:13] other events William brandham
[59:16] conducted great healing Crusades
[59:19] throughout the
[59:20] world and was one of the fathers of the
[59:23] modern healing movement this is the
[59:26] dictionary of Pentecostal and
[59:28] charismatic movements this is the
[59:30] dictionary of Pentecostal and
[59:33] charismatic movements and this is a
[59:35] quote out of their uh this is a
[59:39] statement from them and it says about
[59:42] branam the person universally
[59:46] acknowledged as the Revival's father and
[59:48] pay Setter was William
[59:54] brandham the sudden appearance of his
[59:56] miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set
[1:00:00] off a spiritual explosion in the
[1:00:04] Pentecostal movement which was to move
[1:00:08] to Main
[1:00:19] Street this was really the
[1:00:22] beginning of the globalization it set
[1:00:24] off an explosion
[1:00:28] brother brandham in the angel of the
[1:00:30] Lord he said I know the next thing to
[1:00:32] happen is the restoration this is
[1:00:35] 1948 he said I know the next thing to
[1:00:38] happen is the restoration of the gifts
[1:00:41] to the church historians looking back
[1:00:45] say it happened
[1:00:47] 1948 here is someone here is a prophet
[1:00:49] speaking in that very ear and he says
[1:00:52] that's the next thing to happen
[1:00:56] are you with
[1:01:00] me if anybody has any questions in your
[1:01:04] mind about what God did and what God
[1:01:07] sent onto this Earth you shouldn't have
[1:01:09] any when this service is
[1:01:14] over he said then it's the hardest
[1:01:17] thing I have to do is this pioneering
[1:01:21] work it is to do this as to see the
[1:01:26] people he said God cannot give back the
[1:01:28] gifts to the church as long as the
[1:01:30] church is
[1:01:33] divided Billy Graham's Crusade his first
[1:01:38] crusade was in Los Angeles in 1949 this
[1:01:41] is the within a few months or Roberts
[1:01:45] conducted his first Tent Revival in
[1:01:50] 1948 the initial Declaration of the
[1:01:53] United Nations took place on January the
[1:01:56] 1st 1942 involving 26 governments they
[1:02:00] felt forced to this because the war was
[1:02:02] in the midst of a threatening the whole
[1:02:06] earth and the nations of the world were
[1:02:10] so concerned and consumed because so
[1:02:13] many of their people were
[1:02:16] dying this may surprise you we have a
[1:02:18] very International audience here Canada
[1:02:22] is really quite quiet about their
[1:02:24] involvement do you know that more men
[1:02:27] per capita served in the second world
[1:02:30] war from Canada than any other Nation
[1:02:34] this little country sent 1 million
[1:02:38] men to fight in the second world war and
[1:02:42] were involved in the invasion of
[1:02:44] Normandy my wife's father was in the
[1:02:48] first world war when the gas and the
[1:02:50] mustard gas and all these things were
[1:02:52] involved and lost almost all of the
[1:02:55] people people he he was a sergeant he
[1:02:57] finally became a sergeant I believe it
[1:02:59] was and lost all of his all of his troop
[1:03:02] at one time but this this is why the
[1:03:05] Nations began to speak about having a
[1:03:08] United
[1:03:10] Nations I want to give the chronology at
[1:03:12] this time now we've got the messenger
[1:03:15] 1948 we've got Billy cram 1949 we have
[1:03:19] or Roberts these three Messengers
[1:03:22] 1948 and now I have a chronology of this
[1:03:25] nation of Israel and this is from
[1:03:28] President Truman's Museum in his
[1:03:31] Library February the
[1:03:34] 7th of 1946 or 47 rather 47 and the
[1:03:40] reason I'm raising this is because you
[1:03:42] that listen to the message do you I'm
[1:03:46] sure you do you listen to the tapes
[1:03:48] brother brandham says the very day which
[1:03:53] I believe he puts as May the 7th
[1:03:57] 1947 that very day that the angel of the
[1:04:00] Lord came to him and told him he was
[1:04:04] going to take this ministry to the world
[1:04:06] he said was the very day that Israel was
[1:04:09] recognized as a nation now if you just
[1:04:12] read what is commonly in the papers
[1:04:16] you'd say well no it was May the 14th
[1:04:19] 1948 and now he's not consistent and you
[1:04:23] can't reconcile it and people who want
[1:04:25] want to say he a false prophet but it
[1:04:27] happens to be in February
[1:04:31] 1947 the British government announces
[1:04:34] that it will terminate its mandate in
[1:04:36] Palestine because it
[1:04:39] the the nation of the British government
[1:04:42] had control of
[1:04:44] Palestine and February the 14th 7 Days
[1:04:48] Later the British government announces
[1:04:50] that it will refer the problem of the
[1:04:53] future of Palestine to the United
[1:04:56] Nations this in
[1:04:58] 47 on May the 13th of that same year the
[1:05:02] United Nations General Assembly appoints
[1:05:05] an 11 Nation special committee on
[1:05:08] Palestine to study the Palestine problem
[1:05:11] and report back in September of
[1:05:15] 1947 now what am I saying this for does
[1:05:18] this just sound like a history class to
[1:05:19] you no I hope that you can see that
[1:05:22] there came a second birth pain and God
[1:05:26] himself knew the Earth cannot it cannot
[1:05:30] even endure the third one if it does it
[1:05:34] will birth right into a new kingdom and
[1:05:37] destroy the Earth and it's sending a
[1:05:40] messenger and and and now there's a
[1:05:42] Vortex of time please see this and the
[1:05:45] events start to happen and a messenger
[1:05:48] to a messenger to collect a bride out of
[1:05:50] the church and Messenger to go to the
[1:05:52] world a messenger with the gifts of
[1:05:55] healing
[1:05:56] representing the whole movement of the
[1:05:58] Pentecostal and going to show it how who
[1:06:00] has the largest tent nothing against him
[1:06:04] this is what had to happen absolutely
[1:06:07] great men of God great friends of the
[1:06:10] prophet of God and he understand but now
[1:06:13] you see the things are coming almost
[1:06:15] like into a congested era and the United
[1:06:18] Nations has to be has to form and become
[1:06:20] stronger and the and the World Council
[1:06:23] of churches also this is from the Yale
[1:06:26] law of
[1:06:27] school regarding the state of
[1:06:30] Israel he said it's uh the general
[1:06:34] assembly on the 29th of November
[1:06:37] 1947 and it'll take steps to bring about
[1:06:40] the economic Union of the whole irit
[1:06:44] Israel issued at Tel Aviv on May the
[1:06:47] 14th 1948 so what I want you to see is
[1:06:51] that in God's mind a prophet says the
[1:06:54] day the angel came to me that very night
[1:06:56] God recognized Israel as a nation I want
[1:06:58] to say this congregation and all that
[1:07:00] are listening that God it God's not
[1:07:04] concerned when the United Nations
[1:07:06] recognize it when he recognized it and
[1:07:10] he recognized
[1:07:11] it sent an angel to the messenger said
[1:07:15] take this to the world and so what he
[1:07:17] takes to the world is a gift that's
[1:07:19] never been seen before and he starts to
[1:07:22] show this gift it's at a time when
[1:07:24] there's a great great benefit great
[1:07:26] blessing and Boaz is coming to the
[1:07:30] earth oh my goodness now the Redeemer
[1:07:34] coming with fullness of redemption
[1:07:36] coming to the Earth and he sends his
[1:07:38] Forerunner Forerunner ahead of him with
[1:07:40] a gift and the Forerunner now is going
[1:07:43] to try to explain the gift to everybody
[1:07:46] he even has he even had a a a a woman
[1:07:49] whose son I know them both and he told
[1:07:52] her just watch my hand trying to explain
[1:07:56] the sign that was given and and a boy
[1:07:59] had been to a male clinic he 8 years old
[1:08:02] I know him well and they said he won't
[1:08:05] live past
[1:08:06] 10 and his father's a Pentecostal
[1:08:09] Minister sitting on the platform brother
[1:08:11] CF hu and said to me he said to me I sat
[1:08:16] there and I said if he says what's on
[1:08:19] that card what they had written on the
[1:08:22] card and they gave the three main diseas
[1:08:25] Jesus that had happened the boy drank
[1:08:28] sewage out of water out of a ditch and
[1:08:31] it attacked his heart and he was a dying
[1:08:34] boy couldn't only be in school a little
[1:08:37] time and his father said if he
[1:08:40] says what is on night my card said I'll
[1:08:44] believe he's that
[1:08:46] prophet and brother brandham took him by
[1:08:49] the hand sister hu standing right with
[1:08:51] the boy and he standing there that
[1:08:53] little humble servant and tells exactly
[1:08:56] tell her you look at my hand and if it
[1:08:58] if it becomes normal when I finish
[1:09:00] praying that God God has chosen to heal
[1:09:04] him if it does not become normal he's
[1:09:07] chosen not to heal him I love that
[1:09:09] Simplicity don't
[1:09:12] you he prayed for him and the man is
[1:09:16] living today in
[1:09:20] Idaho and then these people that write
[1:09:23] all these criticisms and things about
[1:09:25] this messenger they don't tell about
[1:09:28] those
[1:09:29] things they maybe pick one item or pick
[1:09:32] something that they think they
[1:09:34] understand they have no understanding
[1:09:36] but I'm saying to this congregation when
[1:09:38] God sent that gift and then he wanted to
[1:09:41] show the gift to all the people let all
[1:09:43] the denominations know let all the idol
[1:09:46] worshippers know and the angel came and
[1:09:49] rebuked them don't show it because they
[1:09:52] can't understand it and so now
[1:09:56] also at the same time the Christian
[1:09:58] businessmen are formed and the World
[1:10:01] Council of churches is
[1:10:04] form how is it that all of these things
[1:10:07] are coming into such a
[1:10:09] congestion of time within months of each
[1:10:14] other it's God it's repeating exactly
[1:10:18] what happened and the prophet tried to
[1:10:20] tell the people you can't and even the
[1:10:24] angel said you cannot you cannot make
[1:10:28] babies to understand spiritual things
[1:10:32] one place you call a Pentecostal babies
[1:10:34] and they were all taken up and I was
[1:10:37] troubled I was very troubled myself
[1:10:41] because I saw I saw here there was a uh
[1:10:44] kind of a movement within the ministry
[1:10:47] and the people and people were coming in
[1:10:49] from the church of England coming in
[1:10:52] from the Salvation Army coming in from
[1:10:54] all matter coming coming in and they're
[1:10:56] coming in coming in and all them and
[1:10:58] getting the gifts of speaking in tongues
[1:11:01] then they laugh and become irreverent
[1:11:04] and I said something's wrong something's
[1:11:08] wrong went into a church where the whole
[1:11:10] charismatic thing was moving in Toronto
[1:11:13] just went in someone said I said go and
[1:11:15] see what's happening they thought it was
[1:11:17] great I went in there and as I was going
[1:11:19] in here's two of the ministers from the
[1:11:22] church smoking their cigarettes outside
[1:11:25] on the on the on the steps and we go in
[1:11:30] and then they move from this place and
[1:11:32] there are people from all manner of
[1:11:34] churches then they moved from there into
[1:11:36] the into the church proper and while
[1:11:39] we're sitting there I'm troubled I'm
[1:11:42] grieved and I got my little family with
[1:11:44] me and then they were going to kneel on
[1:11:46] the uh they have a little uh a little
[1:11:50] bench there you can kneel on and then
[1:11:52] they're going to give communion
[1:11:55] those two men up there speaking tongues
[1:12:00] prophesy you know what happened the
[1:12:03] gifts the treasures had all gone back to
[1:12:09] Babylon and I said to my wife sitting
[1:12:11] beside
[1:12:13] me we're going out of here even though
[1:12:16] everyone's getting ready for communion I
[1:12:18] couldn't care less we're getting up out
[1:12:21] of here we're walking out of here as a
[1:12:24] rebuke right will I said I'll not have
[1:12:27] these men serve me communion and we all
[1:12:30] stood up and filed out and I would do
[1:12:33] the same thing today Hallelujah you
[1:12:37] think it was because I'm an old man it's
[1:12:39] not that I was a young man with little
[1:12:42] children sitting beside me and I had the
[1:12:46] same conviction I have at this moment
[1:12:48] and I'm so thankful how much more God
[1:12:51] has made known and I can share this with
[1:12:53] you today
[1:12:55] amen hallelujah and here God sent a
[1:12:58] prophet Messenger to tell them don't
[1:13:01] show these gifts this isn't for the this
[1:13:04] isn't the way it's in fact as he said
[1:13:06] it's not the initial
[1:13:09] evidence and they were
[1:13:13] determined oh they couldn't wait they
[1:13:16] could not wait till a prophet got up and
[1:13:20] began to reveal the secrets of their
[1:13:22] heart oh you ought to just listen listen
[1:13:25] to a message I just listened to he just
[1:13:28] you can cut the air It's So
[1:13:32] Silent in fact there's one message are
[1:13:34] you listening one service he preaches
[1:13:38] and he's preaching the on the way the
[1:13:40] women should
[1:13:41] dress the way they should conduct
[1:13:43] themselves and they should not be having
[1:13:46] this makeup and should not cut their
[1:13:47] hair and not dress in a sexy manner and
[1:13:51] not wear these shorts and not wear these
[1:13:53] clothes and the man he says you men you
[1:13:56] husbands not having enough gumption
[1:13:59] enough enough strength to deal with your
[1:14:02] wife and preachers that they won't
[1:14:04] preach it and he was dealing with all of
[1:14:15] that then he says to them it's just did
[1:14:18] quiet you can feel the resistance you
[1:14:20] can actually feel the hatred
[1:14:25] and he gets up says
[1:14:29] now he says how
[1:14:32] many would like to have prayer how many
[1:14:34] would like to come in Repentance after
[1:14:37] he' broke this hard
[1:14:40] message and one man
[1:14:43] came you know where I'm
[1:14:46] going he says God bless this man coming
[1:14:51] up
[1:14:53] here now he says that you might
[1:14:57] know that I have told you the truth he
[1:15:01] begins to call the people out you reveal
[1:15:04] a secret heart you secret heart this man
[1:15:08] this woman this man this woman and your
[1:15:11] name is such and such and you are in
[1:15:13] this and you have got this condition and
[1:15:15] you're in that kind of a state he says
[1:15:18] now how
[1:15:19] many and I just flooded The Altar and he
[1:15:23] said I did that to show you that you're
[1:15:28] deceived why were they deceived because
[1:15:31] they would move for a gift but would not
[1:15:34] move for the
[1:15:37] word thank God he put something in our
[1:15:41] heart to be moved by the
[1:15:45] word something in the word moves
[1:15:49] me something in his holy
[1:15:52] book moves a soul
[1:15:58] not the gift not the
[1:16:00] Glamour and where did it
[1:16:03] go I can tell you where it went it went
[1:16:06] to
[1:16:12] Babylon brother brandham speaks
[1:16:15] about in
[1:16:18] 1962 he says the pope they have
[1:16:20] now which was John the 23d
[1:16:26] and it says of John the
[1:16:28] 23rd John is not only a person of
[1:16:31] luminous human qualities this is
[1:16:36] historical quotes about him but an
[1:16:40] intuitive judge of Mankind's hopes and
[1:16:44] needs at first regarded as a
[1:16:46] transitional Pope who had only warmed
[1:16:49] the chair of Peter he took over the
[1:16:52] Catholic church in 1958
[1:16:55] unlike his predecessor the scholarly and
[1:16:58] aloof Pious the 12th John lets his
[1:17:03] interests lets his interests range far
[1:17:06] beyond the Catholic fold to embrace the
[1:17:09] fundamental plight of man in the modern
[1:17:13] world however soon or late that humble
[1:17:15] life may end the world will not be able
[1:17:18] to ignore or forget the forces that Pope
[1:17:21] John unleashed the world will not be a
[1:17:24] able to forget the forces that Pope John
[1:17:28] released and there was a prophet
[1:17:31] speaking to the whole Pentecostal World
[1:17:34] telling them that's exactly where he's
[1:17:39] going and he's going to bring back all
[1:17:42] the brothers lost brothers and he
[1:17:45] screamed out his warning they're going
[1:17:49] back to the
[1:17:51] horor they're going back to the mother
[1:17:55] and they would because they are
[1:17:57] Daughters of
[1:17:58] hers harlots according to
[1:18:05] Revelation just preaching in a church a
[1:18:09] short while ago last
[1:18:12] year and a girl a young woman in that
[1:18:16] church who's a Believer the
[1:18:18] message spoke to one of her professors
[1:18:21] because they're in a they're in a
[1:18:23] fundamental Baptist time
[1:18:25] large over 2, 2500 2700 students and she
[1:18:30] said we're having brother bisc is coming
[1:18:33] us to come and hear him and he came and
[1:18:35] he was in the church I didn't know he
[1:18:37] was in the church and I came to perhaps
[1:18:40] not this subject because I haven't
[1:18:41] preached this before but I began to
[1:18:43] speak
[1:18:44] about the mother of
[1:18:46] harlots the of Revelation
[1:18:51] 17 and of course he identified it right
[1:18:54] away because many did believe that and I
[1:18:57] said and you hear a lot of that subject
[1:19:01] you hear a lot of the mother of harlots
[1:19:04] but I said a mother has children and
[1:19:07] they had daughters and the scripture
[1:19:10] says that God would kill him with death
[1:19:13] spiritual
[1:19:14] death and he walked out of there and
[1:19:18] said to one of the man at the back of
[1:19:19] the church one of the elders or the
[1:19:21] leaders of the
[1:19:23] church had never thought of that before
[1:19:26] and he said
[1:19:28] this I've heard about the the great
[1:19:31] but he said I didn't
[1:19:34] realize I was one of the one of the
[1:19:43] daughters and brother Brandon was out
[1:19:45] there screaming the message trying to
[1:19:48] warn the people as Isaiah said to
[1:19:52] Hezekiah who did you show this to
[1:19:55] and what did you show them we showed
[1:19:57] them everything I was amongst those
[1:19:59] brothers and that's when I was coming
[1:20:01] out I was amongst them they're
[1:20:03] determined we're going to show them how
[1:20:05] to speak in tongues put our hand upon
[1:20:07] them say this say this say this you get
[1:20:09] this gift this wonderful gift they got
[1:20:12] that gift and live like
[1:20:16] devils and the thing went right back you
[1:20:19] ought to see the movement now the
[1:20:21] movement now is the Born Again movie
[1:20:23] stars that's a big movement Born Again
[1:20:26] movie stars and those they bring all
[1:20:29] kinds of perversion to the people and
[1:20:32] the Very gifts are gone right back to
[1:20:53] them can I continue continue on just a
[1:20:55] few more
[1:20:58] minutes I I promised myself that I would
[1:21:01] not race through this so I'm not taking
[1:21:04] my time for you I'm taking it for
[1:21:07] myself this article is concluding with
[1:21:11] John
[1:21:12] Paul who brother Bram spoke about
[1:21:15] several times and he says the world will
[1:21:18] not soon
[1:21:19] forget or ignore the forces that Pope
[1:21:23] John not John Paul I'm sorry Pope John
[1:21:26] has unleashed the importance of the
[1:21:28] council this was Vatican Council 2 the
[1:21:31] importance of the counil that he called
[1:21:33] is already clear by revealing in
[1:21:37] Catholicism the deep-seated presence of
[1:21:39] a new spirit crying out for Change and
[1:21:43] Rejuvenation it scattered it shattered
[1:21:46] the Protestant view of the Catholic
[1:21:48] church has a monolithic and Absolut
[1:21:52] absolutist system and and and then it
[1:21:55] moved on here's what brother Bram said
[1:21:57] in the paman church age and notice the
[1:22:01] that Pope John the 23rd has asked all
[1:22:05] the little daughter churches to come
[1:22:08] back home isn't this amazing
[1:22:15] language Vatican Council
[1:22:20] 2 listen now was called in 19
[1:22:26] 62 brother brandham is making this
[1:22:29] statement in
[1:22:31] 1960 2 years
[1:22:33] before and he says he's asked all the
[1:22:36] little daughter churches to come back
[1:22:38] home to the mother Church don't worry
[1:22:42] she will they
[1:22:51] will you don't know how moved I am
[1:22:55] did God send you a
[1:22:57] messenger did God send you a
[1:23:05] prophet and he says they're already back
[1:23:08] they don't have to go back they're
[1:23:10] already back there and then the Bible
[1:23:13] said he said that she will take it by
[1:23:19] flatteries I don't have the time I would
[1:23:21] like to read for you what the bishop of
[1:23:24] San Francisco has said and he's a great
[1:23:27] leader listen
[1:23:30] now I have a lot of things in here I
[1:23:33] hope that you can even if it goes over
[1:23:34] your head hold it it's like a class
[1:23:37] young
[1:23:39] people brother Ed may not be able to get
[1:23:41] into this the way I'm doing it right
[1:23:45] now the first church that became
[1:23:48] organized an organized church was the
[1:23:51] Catholic Church they're the first one
[1:23:54] that came out of the movement when the
[1:23:57] church was born in the book of Acts the
[1:23:59] first one to form and become the
[1:24:02] mother was the ca Roman Catholic church
[1:24:06] and that's why she has and and well I
[1:24:08] won't get into but that's why she has
[1:24:10] all the Heathen all of heathen holidays
[1:24:14] and everything brought back and brought
[1:24:16] it and introduced it to protestan Isel
[1:24:24] okay that's the first one the last
[1:24:28] denomination as a world movement was the
[1:24:33] Pentecostal and brother Brenham says to
[1:24:36] you he says all all these revivals that
[1:24:41] God sends they become denominated within
[1:24:45] three years he said this has been going
[1:24:48] now for 15 years and longer and he says
[1:24:53] and it has not nominated and it
[1:24:57] cannot because this one was the last one
[1:25:00] and that is why when the charismatic
[1:25:03] movement was spawned and went throughout
[1:25:06] the world also even right back to the
[1:25:08] Vatican in fact is I had I had word that
[1:25:12] the Pope's secretary himself had
[1:25:17] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:19] or the gift of the holy spirit with the
[1:25:21] speaking in tongues a pastor who I know
[1:25:24] know very very well my sister and
[1:25:27] brother-in-law know him also very well
[1:25:28] they may not know what I'm saying just
[1:25:31] now I happened to be in Zurich
[1:25:35] Switzerland and there was about 900
[1:25:37] Believers of the message in a room and
[1:25:41] several Ministers of Believers ministers
[1:25:43] were speaking and when I walked out into
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:47] foyer uh here I could see that there was
[1:25:50] another big Gathering taking place
[1:25:53] because this building had multiple
[1:25:55] meeting rooms large meeting rooms when I
[1:25:58] came back to America to Canada I'm
[1:26:01] walking in a store I run right into this
[1:26:04] pastor much older than myself and I and
[1:26:07] he said I was just in Zurich he said oh
[1:26:11] he said oh he said there were nuns and
[1:26:15] Priests and he said they're all speaking
[1:26:17] in tongues he said it was
[1:26:19] glorious I said that is something I said
[1:26:22] I was just in Zur what are you yeah I
[1:26:26] said we're right in Zurich and we had a
[1:26:28] meeting I said where were you in the
[1:26:29] meeting we in a certain certain place I
[1:26:31] said that's where our meeting was what
[1:26:33] day was it it was this day I said that's
[1:26:35] when we were and and he got a shock look
[1:26:37] he says oh that was
[1:26:40] you he said we knew there was a meeting
[1:26:43] taking place you know like Believers of
[1:26:45] this message we we saw that that was
[1:26:48] taking place and I said to him I said
[1:26:50] and I called him by name said I want to
[1:26:52] ask you a question
[1:26:57] if the pope speaks in
[1:27:00] tongues will he be the pope for
[1:27:05] you
[1:27:07] oh never said a
[1:27:09] word hadn't thought of
[1:27:12] that will he change his office if he
[1:27:15] gets his gift will he be the pope will
[1:27:19] he be the viker of
[1:27:22] Christ will he still explain all the
[1:27:24] scripture to you will it still be a
[1:27:26] Purgatory will you worship
[1:27:30] Mary where does this thing
[1:27:32] end and the gifts went right back to
[1:27:37] Babylon but listen friends I say here to
[1:27:40] this congregation we were many of us
[1:27:43] born in Babylon and we come back to
[1:27:47] Jerusalem hallelujah
[1:27:50] hallelujah I was born in bondage I was
[1:27:53] born in confusion but I've come out
[1:27:58] hallelujah it's from Jerusalem to
[1:28:01] Babylon and back
[1:28:05] Hallelujah and they begin to come back
[1:28:08] they begin to come back the Bible says
[1:28:09] that in in the year that's uh Darius and
[1:28:13] God put it in his heart to raise the
[1:28:16] funds and to raise up people and who
[1:28:18] will go back and God has put in my heart
[1:28:21] to build a house for the Lord God Of
[1:28:23] Heaven heaven in Jerusalem and I can
[1:28:26] tell you God put it in his heart because
[1:28:28] God put it in his
[1:28:32] word and it got to be known who's going
[1:28:35] back who's got it in their heart to
[1:28:47] build Hallelujah
[1:28:55] sometimes I'm not preaching I'm going to
[1:28:57] end in just a few
[1:28:59] moments brother brandham makes these
[1:29:01] statements nothing in the Bible types
[1:29:04] the
[1:29:05] denominations but
[1:29:07] Babylon do you believe
[1:29:12] that in the message Jehovah
[1:29:16] Gyra preaching Grass Valley California
[1:29:19] and I was with the minister that was
[1:29:21] hosting these messages and preached in
[1:29:23] his church
[1:29:25] and he says he was telling the little
[1:29:28] account I'm I'm going to dra try and
[1:29:29] draw to a close now but it's not easy I
[1:29:32] have so much that I would like to
[1:29:36] say but he was saying
[1:29:40] that the animals and had a great
[1:29:44] earthquake in
[1:29:45] India and he says the the birds they
[1:29:48] found the birds that would be in these
[1:29:50] rock
[1:29:52] walls out in the field field and they
[1:29:55] said the birds left those places where
[1:29:58] they even make their nests would leave
[1:29:59] and go out in the middle of the pasture
[1:30:01] and and be fluttering in the
[1:30:04] trees and the animals would stand the
[1:30:07] cows and The Oxen would stand near the
[1:30:10] wall to get shade from the heated sun he
[1:30:13] says they all went out into the middle
[1:30:16] of the pasture and stood in the heat
[1:30:19] something in them an instinct in them
[1:30:22] and a great earthquake came and shook
[1:30:26] those walls down and crumbled those
[1:30:28] stones and perhaps destroyed those nests
[1:30:32] but the animals lives were saved and the
[1:30:34] prophet says and if he can guide an
[1:30:36] animal by Instinct how much more ought
[1:30:40] the Church of God to get away from these
[1:30:43] man-made walls of
[1:30:46] doctrines of the churches Babylon is
[1:30:49] going to fall some of these days Jehovah
[1:30:52] Gyra has provided hisself a resting
[1:30:56] place for you he says Fly
[1:31:02] Away From The Towers of the world fly
[1:31:05] away from the glamour of
[1:31:10] Hollywood oh how Satan is so subtle so
[1:31:15] enchanting try to make and especially
[1:31:17] get a whole of the young people I tell
[1:31:20] you young people stay away from the
[1:31:22] styles of the world world that's where
[1:31:25] Satan tries to creep in well it's the
[1:31:27] style we don't care about the style stay
[1:31:30] away if you see everybody on the street
[1:31:33] doing it you go the other
[1:31:35] direction you say well this is this is
[1:31:38] the only thing this the only thing I can
[1:31:39] find in the store will you
[1:31:43] pray I had three daughters my wife
[1:31:47] prayed she even
[1:31:49] wept she said I just I have such an
[1:31:52] agony such a turmoil inside and I have
[1:31:55] to go shopping for the
[1:31:59] girls and she
[1:32:01] sold some of the girls
[1:32:05] sewed was that the end of their battles
[1:32:08] no not necessar the end of our battle
[1:32:11] but we're in a
[1:32:12] Warfare we're in a real
[1:32:18] struggle Babylon is going to fall one of
[1:32:21] these days stay away from the glamour of
[1:32:24] Hollywood the churches are trying to
[1:32:26] mock after
[1:32:29] them it's night you ought to see it
[1:32:31] today friends it's all Hollywood is it
[1:32:35] not so it's Hollywood it's a performance
[1:32:39] it's featuring this star and that star
[1:32:42] the whole thing has gone back it's all
[1:32:45] homogenized that's why some of these
[1:32:48] absolutely demon-possessed perverted
[1:32:51] rock
[1:32:52] stars that that's why they're received
[1:32:54] in the highest places of government and
[1:32:58] given great uh you know titles and even
[1:33:03] received and Pope John Paul comes and
[1:33:06] and and
[1:33:08] uh fellowships with those that are rock
[1:33:13] stars you know that's true I guess you
[1:33:17] do why the whole thing is corrupted it
[1:33:21] all has to do with money it all has to
[1:33:23] do with uh Society it all has to do with
[1:33:26] celebrity it all has to do with you know
[1:33:29] uh identification and Swinging people
[1:33:34] in we want no part of it we want no part
[1:33:38] of it whatsoever and I'm preaching this
[1:33:41] so that you can go out of this place
[1:33:42] today and say thank God I have a
[1:33:45] protection and you want a little short
[1:33:47] scripture for it it's in the prayer of
[1:33:49] our Lord Jesus Christ Our Father which
[1:33:52] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[1:33:55] kingdom come thy will be done on Earth
[1:33:58] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[1:34:00] daily bread and lead us not into
[1:34:05] temptation that's exactly what God did
[1:34:07] by sending you a messenger is answering
[1:34:10] that prayer giving you the guidance so
[1:34:12] that you will not be led into
[1:34:15] temptation he said dress this way and if
[1:34:18] you dress that way you will not be led
[1:34:20] into
[1:34:21] temptation don't hold that voice boy's
[1:34:24] hand and as a young man don't touch that
[1:34:28] girl and you will not be led into
[1:34:31] temptation God made you a certain way
[1:34:34] you have certain certain strengths God
[1:34:36] Made You he gave you the sexual desires
[1:34:39] because it's there to to be kept holy
[1:34:42] it's there to be a progenitor of of life
[1:34:47] it's not there to drag down in the mud
[1:34:49] of the world and you can point your
[1:34:50] finger in the devil's faith and say I'm
[1:34:52] not ashamed
[1:34:54] that I have those strengths I'm not
[1:34:56] ashamed of my appearance I'm not ashamed
[1:34:58] of what God has put in his body but
[1:35:01] you're not going to drag it in the
[1:35:04] muden and you're not going to pervert it
[1:35:06] and you're not going to twist it and
[1:35:09] you're not going to condemn me because I
[1:35:11] have
[1:35:14] it I'm saying some pretty plain things
[1:35:16] today
[1:35:26] especially the young people they have
[1:35:28] certain desires certain
[1:35:31] drives sexual attractions and they come
[1:35:34] to me and they say I'm so condemned what
[1:35:37] are you condemned well because I have
[1:35:39] these desires don't be condemned for
[1:35:41] that God gave them to you he did of
[1:35:44] course where did you get them God gave
[1:35:46] them to you it's a devil want to drag it
[1:35:48] in the mud you don't let him drag it in
[1:35:51] the mud you don't let him tempt you some
[1:35:53] other Direction you hold that as a
[1:35:55] sacred thing from
[1:35:59] God can you say Amen have the support of
[1:36:02] this congregation
[1:36:27] one of the last
[1:36:29] messages that brother brandham
[1:36:32] preached was Modern events made
[1:36:35] clear and he said this in prayer Lord
[1:36:40] Jesus and I'll repeat the prayer from My
[1:36:45] Heart Lord
[1:36:47] Jesus we thank
[1:36:50] you we praise you Lord
[1:36:53] we give you praise for a called out
[1:36:56] people out of
[1:37:00] Babylon I think praise be to God I give
[1:37:04] him praise also I thank him from the
[1:37:07] depths of my heart for a called out
[1:37:09] people that's been called out of
[1:37:15] Babylon tell you what I could do a dance
[1:37:18] I'm rejoicing I've come back to
[1:37:21] Jerusalem and a prophet said Jerusalem
[1:37:24] is where the word issued out of I'm
[1:37:26] dwelling right where the word came
[1:37:44] from and now I close with this I am
[1:37:50] done in the message
[1:37:53] listen now i' i' I put this together I
[1:37:57] believe I was divinely led of God you
[1:37:59] can take it for what it means to
[1:38:02] you whenever I get a quote whenever I
[1:38:06] begin to see something that I feel
[1:38:08] directed the prophet of God has said
[1:38:10] certain things I go and see what he
[1:38:12] called that message because that
[1:38:15] indicates to me where we are in the
[1:38:19] program and now i' I brought this to you
[1:38:22] with a lot of dates statistics and I've
[1:38:24] left out
[1:38:25] some there's just so
[1:38:29] much but at the
[1:38:32] time he came and began to preach the
[1:38:35] message of
[1:38:38] Grace the message of Grace was in 1961
[1:38:42] just before Vatican
[1:38:45] council is going to announce we want to
[1:38:47] bring all the brothers back we want to
[1:38:50] bring it actually they call it the lost
[1:38:52] brother and the prophet said said it was
[1:38:53] the
[1:38:55] daughters they were bringing
[1:38:57] back you got spiritual
[1:39:00] minds and so he comes and listen to this
[1:39:03] as very in fact is brother Tom it ties
[1:39:06] into the last message brother Tom
[1:39:08] preached I met him out in the hall and I
[1:39:11] don't often speak to a brother about
[1:39:13] quotes that he used but I said I use
[1:39:15] that quote so many times it's so very
[1:39:18] dear to
[1:39:19] me and brother brandom in the message of
[1:39:22] Grace read read Zechariah
[1:39:25] 41 those verses I read to you and speaks
[1:39:28] about zerubabel and talks about he that
[1:39:31] laid the foundation is also he that
[1:39:35] brings The
[1:39:36] Headstone because he's a he's a
[1:39:38] messenger representing Christ himself
[1:39:41] bringing the
[1:39:44] headstone the message is Christ Christ
[1:39:48] Christ the word is Christ
[1:39:51] amen in the beginning was the word and
[1:39:53] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:39:57] the Word was God God and the Word was
[1:40:01] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:40:04] beheld his glory as the only begotten of
[1:40:07] the father full of full of full of and
[1:40:16] truth and he
[1:40:19] reads this is the word of the Lord that
[1:40:21] came under zerubabel
[1:40:23] not by might nor by power but by my
[1:40:26] spirit say the Lord who art thou oh
[1:40:28] great Mountain before zerubabel Thou
[1:40:31] shalt become a plain and he shall bring
[1:40:33] forth and he shall bring forth The
[1:40:34] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:40:37] Grace Grace unto it and he said we know
[1:40:41] that this was during the time of the
[1:40:43] preparation of the restoration of the
[1:40:46] temple listen very close he even asked
[1:40:49] the people to listen very close so I'm
[1:40:54] asking this congregation listen very
[1:40:58] close don't miss
[1:41:01] it and he was a great Prince amongst the
[1:41:05] people who had laid the foundation of
[1:41:07] the building now
[1:41:10] you I want you to put on your spiritual
[1:41:14] thinking anointing
[1:41:17] jacket this morning as we think and this
[1:41:21] great Prince zerubabel he said had
[1:41:23] determined to rebuild the house of the
[1:41:27] Lord and then when he did he laid the
[1:41:30] foundation stone and we find out what
[1:41:33] God Said zerubabel has laid the
[1:41:36] foundation with his hands he also shall
[1:41:39] bring forth The Headstone I want you to
[1:41:42] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:41:44] forth the head the Cornerstone he shall
[1:41:47] bring forth The
[1:41:49] Headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:41:52] I'm coming down to it we know that the
[1:41:55] scripture says that Jesus is the Chief
[1:41:57] Cornerstone and he's also the
[1:42:01] headstone now if we will think for a few
[1:42:04] minutes that the seventh Church
[1:42:07] messenger now he jumps right from
[1:42:09] Zachariah please have my have have your
[1:42:12] have my let me have your attention he he
[1:42:14] comes right from Zachariah and brings it
[1:42:17] comes a Quantum Leap and brings it right
[1:42:19] to this very moment and he says that the
[1:42:23] seventh Church messenger was to restore
[1:42:27] the faith of the children back to the
[1:42:29] fathers that's Malachi which is one of
[1:42:33] the writers of the
[1:42:35] restoration Malachi 4 behold I'll send
[1:42:39] you Elijah the prophet because there can
[1:42:41] be no rebuilding without that
[1:42:45] Ministry and Malachi had to say it
[1:42:48] because he was one of the he was one of
[1:42:51] the people that were there at the first
[1:42:53] first return and he's saying there's
[1:42:55] going to be another return and how it's
[1:42:58] going to happen it can't happen without
[1:43:00] Elijah the prophet and he's going to
[1:43:03] return the hearts back to the fathers
[1:43:06] the faith of the fathers and so he goes
[1:43:09] on to say the seventh Messenger to
[1:43:11] restore the faith of the children back
[1:43:13] to the fathers and here's the phrase I
[1:43:15] hope you can memorize it and never
[1:43:17] forget it in other
[1:43:21] words you know Mal 4 5 and
[1:43:25] 6 h i s your Elijah the prophet and
[1:43:29] he'll restore the heart he'll restore
[1:43:32] the faith of the fathers the children
[1:43:35] back to the faith of the fathers and now
[1:43:37] he puts it another language in other
[1:43:40] words
[1:43:42] rebuild the church again under the power
[1:43:47] of the
[1:43:50] spirit you're sitting here today you say
[1:43:53] come to clor Bible way to church if
[1:43:55] you're under the opes of this message if
[1:43:58] you've been birthed under this glorious
[1:44:01] word I want to announce to you that the
[1:44:04] Holy Spirit has sent you personally the
[1:44:07] angel of the Lord in the form of a word
[1:44:10] and to rebuild you back into the house
[1:44:12] of
[1:44:14] God and this ministry has built you back
[1:44:19] rebuilt in other words under the power
[1:44:22] of the spirit to rebuild a people my
[1:44:26] brother my sister I may be beside myself
[1:44:30] but I used to speak in tongues not that
[1:44:32] I don't now I still do but it's under
[1:44:34] the under the exact direction of the of
[1:44:37] the ministry that we've received I heard
[1:44:40] so many all of the gifts of every
[1:44:45] kind until I didn't know what to do with
[1:44:47] it
[1:44:53] I have to be
[1:44:54] honest I was a
[1:44:56] teenager I was one of you boys right
[1:44:59] here and the services were so mighty
[1:45:02] there was such an anointing we were
[1:45:05] afraid to
[1:45:10] leave and a man I just read about he
[1:45:12] just passed
[1:45:14] away he he would come to church a number
[1:45:16] of times and brother Bram talks about
[1:45:18] the latter rain movement and the latter
[1:45:20] rain movement they thought that actually
[1:45:21] brother brandham had been sent to become
[1:45:23] part of their movement and they came out
[1:45:26] of birthed out of North Battleford
[1:45:27] Saskatchewan I know quite a bit about
[1:45:29] them my father was even there for a year
[1:45:32] at their Bible school not studying but
[1:45:34] seeing what it was all
[1:45:37] about and they believ that they put
[1:45:39] hands on people and gave gifts and the
[1:45:42] prophet came to them clearly and says
[1:45:44] you can't give a gift you're born with
[1:45:47] it now I could to I could bring a whole
[1:45:50] another message right here you that have
[1:45:52] talent you all got gifts and you all got
[1:45:55] talents and those talents are not for
[1:45:58] the world those talents are for
[1:46:01] God
[1:46:03] hallelujah they're not to throw out and
[1:46:05] say I'll spend all my energy I'll give
[1:46:08] all my talents to the
[1:46:12] world you go right back into a
[1:46:17] mess you believe
[1:46:19] that and I sat in the service and it
[1:46:22] began to to prophesy they prophesied
[1:46:25] over one couple said prophesied over my
[1:46:28] father said you're going to go to Africa
[1:46:31] my own dad said to me you better save
[1:46:33] your pennies we're going to Africa my
[1:46:35] father never left the shores of this
[1:46:39] country my sister and her husband were
[1:46:41] prophesied over they may not even
[1:46:43] remember I remember well you're going to
[1:46:45] go to
[1:46:46] Indochina they never went to
[1:46:48] Indochina his brother was prophesied
[1:46:50] over they're going to go to Indochina
[1:46:52] they went to to Jamaica prophesied over
[1:46:54] another couple you're going to go to the
[1:46:57] Arctic they in Vancouver
[1:47:02] Island what are you supposed to do with
[1:47:07] that and people are
[1:47:09] misled and the prophet comes and it's so
[1:47:12] true God can't speak a
[1:47:15] lie we can say write it off and say well
[1:47:18] it's just a mistake to me it's not a
[1:47:20] mistake it misleads the people and now
[1:47:23] we have a perfect word now we have an
[1:47:26] absolute that keeps us out of that mess
[1:47:29] and they showed all the gift to the
[1:47:31] world here's our gifts here's our
[1:47:32] Treasures here our talent and it all
[1:47:34] went back to
[1:47:37] Rome and good Pentecostal Brothers of
[1:47:40] mine a pastor friends of mine going in
[1:47:44] and mingling with all the nuns and the
[1:47:47] priest and everything else and I I have
[1:47:49] a quote right here I have I have Pope
[1:47:52] John Paul Paul's words to the Seminary
[1:47:56] here on the West Coast instructing the
[1:47:58] priests and telling them you cannot
[1:48:01] deviate from the doctrine of the church
[1:48:05] this charismatic movement it's good for
[1:48:07] us but you cannot deviate from the
[1:48:10] doctrine of the church the church still
[1:48:13] becomes the absolute we've got another
[1:48:15] absolute and it's called the word of God
[1:48:19] as revealed and spoken in the mouth of a
[1:48:22] prophet and now friends I can say as he
[1:48:25] has said now it's off of my hands and
[1:48:28] it's onto
[1:48:29] yours and you do what you wish with it I
[1:48:33] feel as though I have relieved myself of

[1:51:50] children before we read s the next verse
[1:51:54] I started three services
[1:51:56] ago and I call it being impressed by
[1:52:02] Revelation and whether you believe it or
[1:52:04] not that theme still lingers on it's
[1:52:07] what we're impressed
[1:52:11] with and I never got a chance to tell
[1:52:15] you I was referring back and I did touch
[1:52:18] on I touched on the mixed multitude that
[1:52:22] came came out with Moses because they
[1:52:24] were impressed by the signs and the
[1:52:28] gifts and they were the persons that
[1:52:30] gave trouble once they got out into the
[1:52:34] Wilderness in this if you read in
[1:52:39] Ezra you go in there just a short
[1:52:41] distance and they begin to rebuild the
[1:52:45] walls and
[1:52:47] rebuild the kingdom the temple once
[1:52:50] again and there came a whole group of
[1:52:52] people another mixed
[1:52:56] multitude they were
[1:52:58] impressed all the treasures and the
[1:53:00] gifts were coming back to Jerusalem and
[1:53:02] they said we're going to build with you
[1:53:05] we're going to be a part of this thing
[1:53:07] we've never seen anything like this
[1:53:10] before and the
[1:53:13] leader don't have his name just now in
[1:53:15] my mind he says you have no part of this
[1:53:19] thing you have no part of this thing
[1:53:22] where the elect of God we're going to
[1:53:23] build it ourselves we don't need your
[1:53:26] money we don't need your talents we
[1:53:29] don't need your schemes we don't need
[1:53:31] your glamour we don't need the celebrity
[1:53:34] we don't need
[1:53:35] it the elect of God we'll build this
[1:53:39] thing amen and that is why that second
[1:53:41] verse said if we just go back the second
[1:53:44] verse
[1:53:45] please let those refuse to sing who
[1:53:49] never knew our God
[1:53:54] maybe I'm off in a my own little world
[1:53:56] but just leave me there I'm having a
[1:53:58] great
[1:54:01] time quite frankly I'm not interested
[1:54:05] who gets
[1:54:06] impressed with what this message
[1:54:08] produces they got to be impressed with
[1:54:11] the one who brings them they got to be
[1:54:14] impressed with him and the prophet says
[1:54:18] the bride the bride is attracted to the
[1:54:23] bridegroom Ruth in the field was not
[1:54:26] attracted to The Barley not attracted to
[1:54:30] her bracelets not attracted to his gifts
[1:54:33] she was attracted to
[1:54:35] Boaz I'm
[1:54:36] attracted I'm impressed with Boaz I'm
[1:54:40] impressed with him who's made himself
[1:54:42] known to

[1:58:54] father Yes this message is a closing out
[1:58:57] of
[1:58:58] history and if we can only grasp that
[1:59:01] Lord we would lay aside all the
[1:59:03] foolishness of this
[1:59:04] life we would lay aside the sin that
[1:59:07] does so easily beset us and we would run
[1:59:10] this race with patience
