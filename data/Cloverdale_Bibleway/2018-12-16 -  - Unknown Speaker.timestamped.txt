[21:06] anybody else does they're on the back
[21:07] table by the office and there's some
[21:11] unique articles in here we have one we
[21:13] were actually hoping to have brother
[21:15] Jason Jackson with us from Arkansas here
[21:18] just last month but he got pulled aside
[21:21] because of the hurricane that they had
[21:23] down there in Florida and he went to
[21:25] have some meet with some and help some
[21:27] family members but he helped us to put
[21:30] an article together of the impact of his
[21:33] church sponsoring a print station in
[21:36] Angola and that is such a unique article
[21:40] you'll want to read that personally it
[21:42] has had a huge impact on their church I
[21:44] won't I won't give you any spoilers as

[22:07] detail and pictures in there that you'll
[22:08] enjoy reading about China and what's

[22:30] faith amen we want our faith challenge
[22:32] you know faith has to have a challenge
[22:34] in order to operate if there's no need
[22:38] there's no need for faith amen and but
[22:42] we thank God that he challenges us and
[22:44] puts a pressure to our faith but he
[22:47] gives us a faith to overcome the
[22:49] challenge and let's believe together not

[38:21] god bless you this is my story also all
[38:27] the day long and I have another story
[38:31] I'd like to just sing a wee bit about he
[38:34] came to me when I could not go to him he
[38:38] came to me and I trust that would be
[38:42] your experience today I stood right
[38:45] about where Thomas sitting and we were
[38:48] singing he came to me I remember even
[38:52] looking up in the balcony over to this
[38:54] side I don't know why I just looked over
[38:56] there and I said yes you came to me you
[39:03] came to me in my element you came to me
[39:06] and in the wilderness as it were and you
[39:10] came to me there you came to me in a
[39:13] profit and you answered many questions
[39:17] you came to me and like you if you would
[39:20] stand if you wouldn't mind and just sing
[39:23] that and I'd like your thought to be
[39:26] upon that very thought perhaps this is
[39:32] the moment he would just come to me in a
[39:35] special way lets us say him
[39:45] [Music]
[39:54] [Music]
[40:32] have you singing I'll have you sing once
[40:35] again with me and rather than singing it
[40:38] like a lullaby we'll say it like a song
[40:43] like putting words to your putting music
[40:47] to your words he came to me he came to
[40:54] me when I could not come to where he was
[41:00] he came to me saying it like a like an
[41:06] event in your life would you do maybe
[41:09] you want to close your eyes and just
[41:11] think about that I'm just wanting to
[41:13] create that kind of an atmosphere say
[41:17] your brother
[41:23] [Music]
[41:35] [Music]
[41:45] [Applause]
[41:49] [Music]
[41:52] [Applause]
[41:56] [Music]
[42:09] now his prey a moment please our
[42:11] Heavenly Father we're indebted forever
[42:17] then you came to us when you came our
[42:21] life was changed our life was
[42:24] transformed by the transforming power
[42:28] which we could not even begin to
[42:30] comprehend but you have done it and
[42:33] we've gathered here this morning for
[42:36] various reasons perhaps some say well
[42:40] it's Sunday and we always go to church
[42:42] but may it be more than that may it
[42:45] become a time when we come and speak to
[42:49] you and you speak to us may it be a time
[42:53] the old God that this will be a house of
[42:56] prayer a house of communicating with you
[43:00] Heavenly Father bless your word now and
[43:03] now we pray that we'll be worthy to read
[43:07] your words things that you've spoken
[43:10] things that were in your heart things
[43:14] that you had intended shall be and they
[43:17] shall be Oh God whether we see it or do
[43:21] not see it they shall be thy will be
[43:24] done on earth as it is in heaven we
[43:27] speak O Lord to you as our Father we
[43:31] pray your will be done in Jesus name
[43:33] Amen
[43:35] anointest Lord we pray amen well you
[43:43] enjoyed I'm sure brother God's comments
[43:48] about faith challenge report well I
[43:52] haven't read it yet
[43:54] I'm certainly going to read it and I
[43:58] trust you be blessed this week as you
[44:00] ponder the things that God has for us
[44:05] made this Sunday be a Sunday are we
[44:09] different from others I just pray that
[44:12] you will have a testimony such as I had
[44:15] just a moment ago I maybe just said it
[44:17] quickly I was standing where brother
[44:20] Thomas sitting and I was standing and I
[44:23] was just singing he came to me it was
[44:27] just another course but that day it was
[44:30] a different course that day it was
[44:33] different words and I don't even know if
[44:36] the author of this song felt what I felt
[44:40] thought that day he came remember when
[44:44] he looked at you saw you what did he see
[44:46] in you
[44:47] and so I I pray that today will be a
[44:51] blessed time in his presence
[44:53] amen amen
[44:58] I'll have you take your Bible and
[45:02] because I'm going to be speaking from
[45:08] I'm going to speak from the old creation
[45:11] and the new creation our first birth and
[45:16] our second birth and why believers even
[45:21] believers have a lot of trouble have a
[45:24] lot of difficulty because we're living
[45:26] in both places at the same time that's
[45:30] and brother Ernie you lead a wonderful
[45:33] foundation for that on Wednesday it was
[45:36] really wonderful someone was asking me I
[45:38] was smiling of course I was smiling
[45:41] through the whole time I just enjoyed I
[45:44] enjoyed the word real a whole lot is
[45:48] what I'll say and a few a few weeks ago
[45:53] brother Tom preached the series and I
[45:57] don't know if you caught it as in a
[45:59] series but he started on the theme here
[46:04] ye him and
[46:06] and the second service he spoke on those
[46:13] that heard him said but blessed are your
[46:16] ears for they hear for the things they
[46:19] hear and your eyes for the things a lot
[46:23] of people could see physically but they
[46:27] weren't seeing what they were given to
[46:30] see and then I think the third service
[46:34] was and you'll just forgive me Tom if
[46:37] I'm not exactly on cue here but I think
[46:40] the third service was that you could see
[46:45] and you could hear even if you wanted to
[46:50] you could see in here only by his grace
[46:53] and by his predestinated and you'll only
[46:58] see in here what you hunger and really
[47:02] hunger after today it won't it's God's
[47:08] not going to force it down your throat
[47:10] it's something you will need to hunger
[47:13] for you desire for you think about it
[47:16] you ponder it and you think about his
[47:19] greatness and your unworthiness and when
[47:22] you see things in a in the light that
[47:25] they really are and I'm just seeking to
[47:28] prepare you for what I have further to
[47:31] say amen
[47:34] and then in that third service the the
[47:39] last service at least whether it was the
[47:41] third or fourth service it was that we
[47:47] we are predestinated to a certain
[47:50] purpose and God does he opens our eyes
[47:57] causes us to see causes us to hear
[48:01] because it is to direct our life in a
[48:05] certain pre-planned direction and God
[48:10] has his intent in fact is that's why you
[48:14] were perhaps some of you may be born in
[48:17] the home you were born in
[48:19] he wanted you to hear certain things
[48:22] perhaps others of you worked with
[48:24] someone who you worked with a colleague
[48:28] or you ran into somebody and they just
[48:31] casually said something to you and it
[48:35] just that was different and you followed
[48:38] on or you got invited to church this
[48:42] this is a church it's not a church
[48:44] Church this is just a building that we
[48:48] come we come to hear the word of God we
[48:52] come to let the Holy Spirit have his way
[48:55] and that's the whole desire and failing
[49:00] that we fail completely there's all
[49:03] kinds of churches all kinds of buildings
[49:06] their monuments is what they are and we
[49:11] don't want this to be just a monument we
[49:13] don't want this just to be a formality
[49:14] if there's just a formality to you as to
[49:18] the Holy Spirit
[49:19] Jarre me from that jar me out of that
[49:22] and let me know that I'm here for a
[49:25] divine purpose for Tomita to have of a
[49:30] divine meeting with the Holy One of
[49:33] Israel
[49:34] amen god bless you now with I'll just
[49:39] have you take your Bibles if you would
[49:41] if you don't have a Bible shared with
[49:43] one right next to you
[49:46] because I like you to read from John the
[49:50] seventeenth chapter and the eleventh to
[49:55] the sixteenth verse and while you're
[49:58] turning I might as well say this to you
[50:01] because that came to my mind today and I
[50:05] said father let me be worthy to read
[50:08] these words this was not just some
[50:11] printed words on a page this is the
[50:15] prayer of Jesus Christ
[50:19] we're not worthy to even read it cause
[50:24] us to be worthy and it's a conversation
[50:27] earlier in John Jesus had a
[50:32] recession with Nicodemus and we will
[50:36] turn to that just after I'm going to
[50:42] turn this on so you can read it and now
[50:49] I am no more in the world like you
[50:53] notice the word in the world but these
[50:56] are in the world and I come to the Holy
[51:01] Father keep through then all name those
[51:05] whom thou hast given me that they may be
[51:09] one as we are while I was with them in
[51:15] the world I kept them in thy name
[51:19] those that thou gave us me I have kept
[51:22] and none of them is lost but the son of
[51:26] perdition that the scripture might be
[51:29] fulfilled and now I come to thee and
[51:35] these things I speak in the world that
[51:40] they might have my joy fulfilled in
[51:44] themselves not his not a distress but a
[51:49] joy fulfilled in themselves not
[51:53] something hilarious or jovial as such
[51:56] but a deep settled joy verse 14 I have
[52:01] given them thy word and the world hath
[52:05] hated them because they are not of the
[52:09] world and I would like you to notice now
[52:12] the word of of' they are not of the
[52:16] world
[52:16] they haven't proceeded from the world
[52:19] they may have gone through the school
[52:22] system that may have gone through
[52:23] further education but they're not of the
[52:26] world they may earn a living there and
[52:29] survive and raise a family but they're
[52:32] not of the world they're not a product
[52:35] of the world and the world have hated
[52:40] them and they are not of the world even
[52:43] as I
[52:45] not of the world
[52:48] I pray that thou sure to take them I
[52:52] pray not that thou shouldn't take them
[52:55] out of the world but that thou should
[52:58] has keep them from the evil they are not
[53:02] of the world even as I am NOT of the
[53:06] world verse 16 and I'm going to turn
[53:12] back to in John's Gospel - John the 3rd
[53:19] chapter and I just want to read a couple
[53:24] of verses starting John 3 and the 3rd
[53:32] verse jesus answered and said unto him
[53:36] that was Nicodemus verily verily I say
[53:40] unto thee except a man be born again he
[53:44] cannot see the kingdom of God
[53:47] so there's another birth except a man be
[53:50] born again except a man be born again he
[53:56] cannot see the kingdom of God
[53:59] Nicodemus saith unto Him how can a man
[54:03] be born when he is old can he enter the
[54:08] second time into his mother's womb and
[54:10] be born and I want to answer no he
[54:13] couldn't because if he with the birth
[54:19] that he had entered into the second
[54:21] second time in his mother's womb and was
[54:24] born it would still be flesh it would
[54:27] still be death it would still be sinful
[54:31] and I'll talk about that in just a
[54:33] moment so jesus answered verse 5 jesus
[54:36] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[54:40] except a man be born of water and of the
[54:44] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[54:49] of God
[54:50] god bless you you may be seated
[54:55] now we had our first birth and that's
[54:59] why we're here you're all here and you
[55:05] have a father and a mother someplace but
[55:12] you were born in sin and you were
[55:16] shaping in iniquities and you came with
[55:19] a human nature and you came as a result
[55:25] of unbelief you're the product of
[55:28] unbelief Eve disbelieved the word Adam
[55:33] went to redeem her and so the first
[55:37] birth we were born in sin and shapen in
[55:41] iniquity x' secondly we're born subject
[55:46] to pain to disease to sickness you're
[55:52] born subject to those things we have
[55:55] Wars all kinds of infirmities and
[56:01] because of that birth this birth that
[56:05] I'm speaking of now the second birth the
[56:09] second birth is the beginning of the
[56:12] creation of God I'd like you to if you
[56:15] have your Bible if you just turn also to
[56:20] Revelation the third chapter and I was
[56:23] very affected by this particular verse
[56:45] revelation the third chapter and the
[56:50] fourteenth verse and unto the Angel of
[56:54] the Church of the Laodiceans write these
[56:59] things saith the Amen now a few moments
[57:04] ago we were reading words that he spoke
[57:07] on earth spoke to mortal ears the very
[57:13] few that will understand these words but
[57:16] now he's still speaking and under the
[57:20] angel of the church of the laodiceans
[57:22] under the messenger of that church he
[57:29] has a special message and he didn't even
[57:34] say speak he said write these things
[57:37] saith the angel these things saith the
[57:41] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[57:45] beginning of the creation of God this is
[57:50] the beginning of another creation the
[57:57] beginning of the creation of God it
[58:02] isn't that God failed in the first
[58:03] creation God knew it was going to go
[58:07] that direction because we sit here in a
[58:11] body through that creation and we're all
[58:16] born in sin I don't care how good you
[58:19] are I don't care what you've believed
[58:20] that has nothing to do with it we are
[58:23] born in sin and shapen iniquities and in
[58:27] this body we will get older we will get
[58:31] weaker brother branham even asked a man
[58:35] he said is it not true that as I eat
[58:38] food and as digested in this body he may
[58:42] not have used those words but he said as
[58:45] I ate food
[58:46] and I eat vegetables and so on I get
[58:50] stronger yes he said that that's correct
[58:53] you get stronger it's because it's
[58:57] bringing blood cells into the
[59:00] bloodstream and you get stronger he said
[59:03] then how is it that I eat today I still
[59:06] eat the same food I still eat the same
[59:10] potatoes they made the same meat and so
[59:12] on but I get weaker and the man didn't
[59:16] have an answer form he gets weaker you
[59:19] get weaker eating the same food but you
[59:23] don't regenerate the same as you do when
[59:27] you're younger so we have a mixed
[59:29] audience here today we have some of you
[59:32] that are receiving the benefits of what
[59:35] you eat on that end but gradually as
[59:39] time goes on you'll find that it becomes
[59:44] more more weight than you want it
[59:50] doesn't do what you want it to do you
[59:52] know I said I used to be able to always
[59:54] do this I could always do this well we
[59:58] don't anymore
[59:59] sister biscuits sitting back there she
[1:00:01] used to run like an antelope today it's
[1:00:07] more difficult even to walk steady
[1:00:10] same thing with myself and so that is
[1:00:15] one birth and Jesus said to Nicodemus
[1:00:20] you must you must be born again you
[1:00:25] cannot see the kingdom of God until
[1:00:29] you're born again it isn't friends that
[1:00:32] you sit in this church or any other
[1:00:34] church that will not give you the vision
[1:00:37] that you need to have you can clean your
[1:00:40] glasses that do whatever you wish but
[1:00:43] that doesn't give you the vision you
[1:00:45] must be born again
[1:00:47] and then you shall see the kingdom of
[1:00:50] God except a man be born again he cannot
[1:00:54] see the kingdom of God he cannot enter
[1:00:57] the kingdom of God and I can tell you
[1:01:00] that this life that you're representing
[1:01:04] today sitting in the seat that you're in
[1:01:08] will end then a prophet of God his words
[1:01:13] will mean so much to you when his words
[1:01:17] that he spoke and said that this life
[1:01:20] are you listening this life only changes
[1:01:24] there's no change actually you you and
[1:01:28] this life you step into another life you
[1:01:32] just take one footstep as brother Ernie
[1:01:34] was describing to us on Wednesday night
[1:01:37] and you take one step it'll be in time
[1:01:40] and you'll take another step and you'll
[1:01:43] be an eternity if you're born again amen
[1:01:52] allow me just to read I want to read
[1:01:55] something that I thought of you brother
[1:01:58] Ken Andes because you put so much
[1:02:03] meaning and depth to the church ages and
[1:02:09] I really appreciate that brother Branham
[1:02:13] says in the church ages
[1:02:22] just a moment please
[1:02:25] it's in the layout of sin church age
[1:02:28] page 336 he says but now he is standing
[1:02:34] in the midst of his church speaking of
[1:02:37] Christ as he stands there revealing who
[1:02:41] he is
[1:02:41] in this last age he calls himself the
[1:02:46] author of the creation of God which we
[1:02:49] just read he calls himself the author of
[1:02:53] the creation of God this is another
[1:02:57] creation this has to do with the church
[1:03:01] this is a special designation of himself
[1:03:05] he is the creator as John's Gospel says
[1:03:11] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:03:14] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:03:17] all things were made by him and without
[1:03:21] him was nothing made that is made he
[1:03:25] created all things so now he is saying
[1:03:28] this is another creation this has to do
[1:03:33] with the church in other words he's
[1:03:35] going to create something this is a
[1:03:37] special date designation of himself he
[1:03:41] is the creator of that church the
[1:03:44] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:03:49] bride as the Spirit of God as the Spirit
[1:03:55] of God he came down and created in the
[1:03:59] Virgin Mary the cells from which his
[1:04:03] body was born I want to repeat that he
[1:04:08] created the very cells in the womb of
[1:04:11] Mary for that body it was not enough for
[1:04:17] the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a
[1:04:21] human ovum supplied by Mary
[1:04:24] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:04:29] producing a body that would not have to
[1:04:33] the last Adam are you receiving this of
[1:04:38] him it is it was said lower body has no
[1:04:44] father has now prepared for me God not
[1:04:50] Mary provided that body Mary was the
[1:04:55] human incubator and she carried that
[1:05:00] holy child and brought him to birth it
[1:05:04] was a god man he was the son of God he
[1:05:10] was the new creation man and God met and
[1:05:15] joined he was Colossians 1 and 18 for he
[1:05:20] is the head of the body the church who
[1:05:24] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:05:27] dead hallelujah and in and in all things
[1:05:32] he may he may have the preeminence 2nd
[1:05:37] Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any
[1:05:41] man be in Christ I wish to have this on
[1:05:45] the slides but I don't have it prepared
[1:05:47] for you therefore if any man be in
[1:05:50] Christ he is a new creation you believe
[1:05:55] that you are a new creation If any man
[1:05:59] be in Christ he is a new creation old
[1:06:04] things have passed away and behold all
[1:06:08] things become new there you can see that
[1:06:13] though man was of the old order or
[1:06:17] creation now in union with Christ and
[1:06:22] here's the key in union with Christ he
[1:06:26] has become the new creation of God
[1:06:30] Ephesians 2 and 10 for we are his
[1:06:33] workmanship created in union with Christ
[1:06:37] unto good works visions 4 and 24 and
[1:06:42] that you might put on the new man
[1:06:47] this is how you do it which after God is
[1:06:50] created in righteousness and true
[1:06:54] holiness this new creation is not the
[1:06:58] old creation made over or it could not
[1:07:01] be called a new creation this is exactly
[1:07:05] what this this is exactly what it says
[1:07:09] it is new creation
[1:07:11] it is another creation distinct from the
[1:07:15] old one no longer is he dealing by the
[1:07:19] ways of the flesh this was this was how
[1:07:24] he dealt with Israel
[1:07:26] he chose Abraham is the mammoth of the
[1:07:30] flesh and of Abraham's issue see God had
[1:07:35] promised him seed of Abraham's issue
[1:07:40] through the godly Isaac lion but now out
[1:07:46] of every kindred tribe and nation he has
[1:07:51] proposed a new creation he is the first
[1:07:55] of the that creation he was God created
[1:07:59] in the form of man now by his Spirit he
[1:08:05] is creating many sons unto himself God
[1:08:09] the creator of creating himself a part
[1:08:13] of his creation is not wonderful this is
[1:08:17] the new revelation this is the new
[1:08:19] revelation of God this was his purpose
[1:08:23] and then I have underlined and
[1:08:25] highlighted this purpose took form
[1:08:28] through election and I could continue on
[1:08:32] but I want to just stop there you cannot
[1:08:35] supersede the election of God you're
[1:08:39] sitting here by his election you owe a
[1:08:42] debt to him to thank him to worship Him
[1:08:47] because he simply elected that you'd be
[1:08:50] born in a certain place I want to just
[1:08:53] speak about these two births for a
[1:08:55] moment I've been pondering them for days
[1:08:58] weeks and
[1:09:02] you that are mothers and fathers well
[1:09:07] bye with technology maybe you didn't
[1:09:10] know it was a boy or a girl but you knew
[1:09:13] very little and and and that's not
[1:09:15] thanks to you that's thanks to
[1:09:17] technology when my daughters were born
[1:09:20] they wouldn't even let me go into the to
[1:09:23] the sea where the children were I was
[1:09:27] not permitted I could only look at them
[1:09:29] through a glass you say how horrible
[1:09:31] well that's part of my life as a
[1:09:35] horrible part of my life you know I
[1:09:37] couldn't even see my daughters I
[1:09:39] couldn't even see him my children that's
[1:09:42] you know for a husband to stand there
[1:09:44] it's very humiliating yeah it's my seed
[1:09:47] but I can't even see them I can't
[1:09:49] they've got to put this glass between me
[1:09:52] and my child and my wife is sitting
[1:09:54] there
[1:09:55] our last daughter that is sitting here
[1:09:58] today Tom's wife Joanne I was working
[1:10:05] and so I raced home because I was going
[1:10:08] to fix myself something to eat real
[1:10:11] quick and run down to the hospital and
[1:10:13] so I phoned nurses station and I said
[1:10:18] how's Ruth Fiscal said she bought the
[1:10:21] same I said okay fine I had lots of time
[1:10:24] so about 25 minutes later I got a phone
[1:10:28] call and it's from the hospital my wife
[1:10:32] was on the phone I said oh hi I just
[1:10:35] talked with the nurses station and she
[1:10:38] said well it's a girl
[1:10:41] I said come on I said aye aye aye
[1:10:45] I know better I've just talked to the
[1:10:47] nurse and she said everything's probably
[1:10:48] the same no she said it's a girl I said
[1:10:52] you're kidding
[1:10:53] and what I didn't know is that her
[1:10:56] father came in to see her and the bed
[1:11:00] was empty and there was another sister
[1:11:03] there we knew and related by marriage
[1:11:07] and and she was there she said well I I
[1:11:13] think she maybe just went down to the
[1:11:14] washroom or something so he said well
[1:11:17] I'll just go there's another old timer
[1:11:18] here I'll go and visit him and then I'll
[1:11:20] come back so he came back in the boat 20
[1:11:24] minutes or half an hour he came back
[1:11:26] after a little time of visiting and and
[1:11:29] she's in her bed and well he said I was
[1:11:33] just in here she said well it's a girl
[1:11:35] and there was a shock to him as well and
[1:11:39] so I I raced out of the hospital of
[1:11:42] course it was a girl and I had prayed
[1:11:46] because I had doubted my own prayer I
[1:11:49] guess I prayed for a son and I said if
[1:11:54] it's a girl just make it that they all
[1:11:57] can sing and so that part of my request
[1:12:03] I got but the other part I didn't have I
[1:12:07] wanted a boy but I never got a boy got
[1:12:10] three girls all right that's natural
[1:12:13] birth but isn't it in it incredible that
[1:12:17] something this dynamic something so
[1:12:21] life-changing something that's going to
[1:12:24] change your entire home and your life at
[1:12:27] home and maybe your job and all of these
[1:12:30] things you don't have anything to say
[1:12:32] about it
[1:12:34] is that amazing heavenly father
[1:12:38] something like this I don't have
[1:12:40] anything to say about it and I'd
[1:12:42] furthermore you have nothing to say
[1:12:44] about their nature or their character or
[1:12:47] what you're going to like her what
[1:12:49] they're going to dislike you you have
[1:12:51] very
[1:12:52] little whether they've got skills or
[1:12:54] whether they're gifted you don't know
[1:12:56] anything about it you say well I'll do
[1:12:59] everything I can well you can do
[1:13:01] everything you can but if the kid hasn't
[1:13:03] got it they don't have it you can't put
[1:13:06] it in them I know a little bit about
[1:13:09] that I had I had one daughter you know I
[1:13:14] I have a lot of experience and I had one
[1:13:17] daughter and she would she would come
[1:13:19] and tap on my cheek at about 3:30 in the
[1:13:22] morning many many mornings
[1:13:26] yes Marilyn she'd be standing there in
[1:13:29] their little nightgown and tapping and
[1:13:32] she it was like the Chinese torture
[1:13:37] treatment I believe they had and she
[1:13:41] would just tap on she would tap on there
[1:13:43] as long as it took for me to open my
[1:13:45] eyes and she couldn't say her arse
[1:13:48] either at that time which is no surprise
[1:13:51] I couldn't say until I was about 8 but
[1:13:54] she would tap on my face and then when I
[1:13:58] had opened my eyes she'd say I need a
[1:14:00] pencil and a paper because she was going
[1:14:05] to be an artist someday now you ought to
[1:14:08] see when she takes a pen in her hand and
[1:14:11] I and and I said there and say how do
[1:14:14] you know to do that well it was back
[1:14:16] there I should have known when she was
[1:14:19] saying I need a pencil in the paper that
[1:14:21] she was trying to tell me I got it in me
[1:14:24] and I have to do something about it
[1:14:27] I need a pencil and a paper so I get up
[1:14:31] and get her a pencil and a paper that
[1:14:36] was a natural birth natural birth as
[1:14:39] wonderful as it might be we're born in
[1:14:41] sin and Chafin iniquities doesn't
[1:14:44] regardless of how beautiful you are or
[1:14:46] how young you are or and that has
[1:14:50] nothing to do with that you're still
[1:14:52] gonna get stooped over and you're still
[1:14:54] hair is gonna turn white in they're
[1:14:55] still gonna get wrinkled and and and
[1:14:59] shaking when you get older you
[1:15:02] that happens it's and that's this life
[1:15:05] thank God that there's a new birth thank
[1:15:09] god there's another birth it's not
[1:15:11] wishful thinking it's not in our mind
[1:15:14] and I want to talk about these two do I
[1:15:17] have a few minutes we have a second
[1:15:20] birth the beginning of the creation of
[1:15:23] God the beginning of the creation of God
[1:15:27] comes and washes away that deformities
[1:15:32] of the first birth it's either a weaker
[1:15:37] birth or it's a stronger birth and my
[1:15:40] conviction to you is it's a stronger
[1:15:43] birth there's a light that comes within
[1:15:46] the body to this in this flesh in this
[1:15:51] beginning of the creation of God or this
[1:15:54] shall I say this old creation and you
[1:15:58] know there's some light we have light I
[1:16:03] don't know how to describe it exactly we
[1:16:07] can say well because you can speak or
[1:16:09] because you can see or because well it
[1:16:11] has a measure of light but the second
[1:16:15] birth is a perfect light the second
[1:16:18] birth your thinking will be correct and
[1:16:21] your thinking will not be of doubt or
[1:16:23] unbelief there's a complete change
[1:16:27] between the new birth second birth and
[1:16:31] the first birth the beginning of the
[1:16:39] creation of God comes and washes away
[1:16:42] the deformities of sin and the Mar of
[1:16:49] the effects of unbelief you know when
[1:16:54] the serpent and Eve had their initial
[1:16:56] conversation it wasn't just what was
[1:17:00] spoken but it was a displacement of
[1:17:06] headship
[1:17:10] the Bible says clearly that she should
[1:17:13] have been able to go and talk to her
[1:17:14] husband but neither was he able to give
[1:17:19] her the kind of instruction that she
[1:17:21] needed I'm just thinking of something
[1:17:30] that I perhaps should say and I don't
[1:17:32] want to say but and I have said this
[1:17:36] over the pulpit here when brother
[1:17:39] Branham speaks about the masterpiece and
[1:17:41] how Michelangelo struck that masterpiece
[1:17:45] when he finally sought what was an image
[1:17:48] in his mind and he finally sought there
[1:17:51] and he says they may be picked at it for
[1:17:55] years and someone maybe would say why
[1:18:00] are you picking at that why you hitting
[1:18:03] that stone but when they finally saw the
[1:18:06] image of what he had in his mind he
[1:18:11] thought it should speak to him and he
[1:18:13] struck it on the knee and made him are
[1:18:17] he marred the image and he said speak
[1:18:23] because he thought it should speak to
[1:18:25] him it looks so real it was such a
[1:18:28] fulfillment of what he saw in his mind
[1:18:30] and brother Branham says and it could
[1:18:34] only take a prophet you couldn't say
[1:18:36] this with human intellect he said Tamar
[1:18:40] is what made it the masterpiece and we
[1:18:46] think now of the Mahr of the first birth
[1:18:50] and we were marred you can take a child
[1:18:56] out of a good home on a good Christian
[1:19:00] parents and put them up in the mountain
[1:19:03] where he'll never see any evil or never
[1:19:06] never contact anything he won't see
[1:19:09] other peers of his of his age dabbling
[1:19:14] in sinful things but he'll still have a
[1:19:17] sinful nature
[1:19:19] he'll still come against things that are
[1:19:23] right and pure and so on and that's
[1:19:26] because he'll be he could be better but
[1:19:28] the gospel didn't come to make people
[1:19:30] better
[1:19:49] the Prophet said in the message he swore
[1:19:53] by himself he says in Jesus Christ
[1:19:57] formed from a blood cell and the outside
[1:20:03] shield of the cell itself which is
[1:20:07] billions times billions smaller than a
[1:20:11] human eye can see but that was the body
[1:20:17] the Lord Jesus inside of that was God
[1:20:22] himself wrapped himself around the blood
[1:20:26] cell in order to take his own blood and
[1:20:29] to spill his own blood or give it freely
[1:20:35] that we through the breaking of that
[1:20:39] blood cell to our to our mortal to our
[1:20:45] mortal when when it breaks and our life
[1:20:49] leaves from here to go out through the
[1:20:53] redemption of the blood that God
[1:20:56] required we can we can be brought into
[1:21:01] that body and brought a part of God
[1:21:05] himself as a son of God brother if you
[1:21:09] can digest that it'll share do you good
[1:21:13] I wish I had some way to just show you
[1:21:19] what it what what it is just think of
[1:21:24] God Jehovah coming down into the womb of
[1:21:28] a woman overshadowed come down in that
[1:21:32] in the down in this down to spirit and
[1:21:36] he's in them where is he he's the
[1:21:40] creator himself he made the very woman
[1:21:44] in the womb he made the very woman in
[1:21:48] the womb that that he was in right then
[1:21:54] God made I excuse me but it's not always
[1:21:57] easy to easy to read exactly as the
[1:22:00] Prophet speaks
[1:22:02] God made himself little came down and
[1:22:06] got into his blood own into this blood
[1:22:10] cell and his and he began to build
[1:22:15] something around him what was it he said
[1:22:21] when the Holy Ghost overshadowed her and
[1:22:24] put a blood cell in into her womb in
[1:22:28] creation God the creator made that made
[1:22:35] that and and that came to be the son of
[1:22:39] God amen
[1:22:41] outside of believing that you're lost by
[1:22:45] all you could do you have to believe
[1:22:48] that in order to be saved now here we
[1:22:55] have the beginning of the creation of
[1:22:57] God I have a thought that I want to
[1:23:07] convey to you and I think that I will
[1:23:10] just speak it to you now I've
[1:23:18] established there is a new birth there's
[1:23:21] an old birth and a new birth I want this
[1:23:25] congregation to understand except ye be
[1:23:28] born again you cannot enter the kingdom
[1:23:32] of God you can do a lot with this you
[1:23:38] can go shopping you go fix it up you get
[1:23:43] your hair cut you ma'am you can look
[1:23:48] fine you can go to the gym and all of
[1:23:52] that other stuff but still one day
[1:23:55] you're going to lay on a cold slab
[1:23:58] whether you're a Bill Gates with twenty
[1:24:02] or thirty or forty billion dollars just
[1:24:05] paper or where you're somebody who's in
[1:24:09] debt
[1:24:10] you'll all lay on the slab and that's
[1:24:12] where you'll find common ground when the
[1:24:17] ecumenical movement was moving and
[1:24:20] everybody was joining this and speaking
[1:24:22] in tongues and so on and so forth I was
[1:24:26] in a house on Vancouver Island as a
[1:24:29] result of the radio broadcast and the
[1:24:32] family who's who owned that house their
[1:24:35] own brother Roger Smith's church in
[1:24:37] Abbotsford to this day and they invited
[1:24:42] me to come there and brother Amy Mullin
[1:24:45] how many remembers brother
[1:24:46] Amy Mullin put your hands up high so
[1:24:50] he's not a stranger to the congregation
[1:24:52] brother
[1:24:53] Amy Mullen was in his brother was his
[1:24:56] brother in the flesh he was a hopeless
[1:24:59] hopeless hopeless alcoholic he was a
[1:25:03] good Catholic and he gave himself to go
[1:25:07] to Borneo and the islands in the South
[1:25:12] Sea to work on a gospel ship he thought
[1:25:16] surely I will find peace with God and I
[1:25:20] will find freedom from this demon of
[1:25:24] alcohol and he came to the knowledge of
[1:25:27] the message as a result of my visit over
[1:25:29] there he wasn't there he heard of it
[1:25:32] through his brother but I remember they
[1:25:35] were seated on the floor started here
[1:25:37] went around some in chairs there was 22
[1:25:41] people and I said I didn't know what to
[1:25:46] say really I just came there as a
[1:25:48] visitor and I was looking to the Lord
[1:25:52] that I could say something of value so I
[1:25:55] said now I don't know you you're all
[1:25:59] strangers to me I said this person over
[1:26:03] here might be Salvation Army this one
[1:26:05] might be Catholic and this one over here
[1:26:07] might be a Baptist and I I went around
[1:26:11] this maybe jovis witness this baby
[1:26:14] whatever and I just named all the
[1:26:18] different groups that I could recall
[1:26:20] quickly and I said now
[1:26:23] would like to have the Bible says now
[1:26:27] I'm quoting the Bible the Bible says
[1:26:29] that Jesus the Word was made flesh I
[1:26:35] said I would like the real Jesus to
[1:26:38] stand up nobody stood up I said and I
[1:26:43] read from the scripture I said this is
[1:26:49] Christ this is him and I said I know
[1:26:54] that the Salvation Army they described
[1:27:00] Jesus one way and Catholics another way
[1:27:03] and Baptists another way and I know that
[1:27:07] they do not agree
[1:27:09] I said who has Jesus I'm confused I want
[1:27:15] to know who has Jesus and and as a
[1:27:19] result the owner of the home gave his
[1:27:23] life to this Jesus that he was hearing
[1:27:27] now I'm coming to my main thought in
[1:27:30] just a moment so I want your listening
[1:27:33] real nice and I said this Jesus this
[1:27:41] word this we will refer often to the
[1:27:45] word but the words of God please just
[1:27:52] give me your full attention
[1:27:53] thank you your mother when your father's
[1:28:00] seed I'm speaking to adults now your
[1:28:03] father's seed came to the womb of your
[1:28:07] mother and your mother a of the
[1:28:15] vegetation of the earth the herbs the
[1:28:19] fruit whatever more you are a product of
[1:28:24] the Word of God even this shell here you
[1:28:31] are a product of the Word of God in that
[1:28:34] in that sense
[1:28:37] you also our product of Eve's and Eve's
[1:28:41] disobedience of disbelief that's why a
[1:28:45] prophet comes and says sin is not the
[1:28:50] drinking and the smoking and the
[1:28:51] gambling that's not simple that those
[1:28:53] are the attributes of said even adultery
[1:28:57] and all of those things as the
[1:28:59] attributes of sin the sin is not
[1:29:03] believing the fullness of the word of
[1:29:06] God that's the sin I hope you get that
[1:29:11] we all came the same way our mothers and
[1:29:15] fathers were product of the earth Jesus
[1:29:20] Christ Himself the body was formed the
[1:29:24] Bible says she believed let it be unto
[1:29:27] me as thou has spoken she believed the
[1:29:32] Virgin Mary believed the Word of God
[1:29:35] that a virgin would conceive and a
[1:29:40] prophet of God you'll not hear it
[1:29:42] anywhere else so pay real strict
[1:29:45] attention the prophet of God said those
[1:29:48] words those words that were spoken by
[1:29:52] the Prophet because it wasn't a man it
[1:29:56] wasn't just Isaiah speaking it was God
[1:29:59] issuing his intent concerning the new
[1:30:03] creation through Herman through there
[1:30:06] his mouth said a virgin shall conceive
[1:30:09] and he says those words anchored in her
[1:30:14] heart in her in the womb of Mary and the
[1:30:18] end and those words anchored in her womb
[1:30:21] here she is a vessel of the earth and
[1:30:24] those who eternal words that were spoken
[1:30:27] by the mouth of God had a different
[1:30:31] intent I hope you're able to understand
[1:30:33] even though even though she herself was
[1:30:37] a product of the earth
[1:30:39] her mother ate the vegetables and so on
[1:30:42] and she's going to continue to eat to
[1:30:44] give a human life to a man and God would
[1:30:51] be in him reconciling the world to
[1:30:54] himself and that is why he went to
[1:30:57] Calvary people celebrate Easter they
[1:31:00] know nothing about Easter I tell you
[1:31:03] that this is a new creation walking
[1:31:07] amongst an old creation and Friends
[1:31:10] here's the struggle that you and I have
[1:31:12] we are a new creation we're no creation
[1:31:18] by the Holy Spirit of God he brooded
[1:31:23] over the earth and up came the flowers
[1:31:26] and up came and God said let the earth
[1:31:30] bring forth and it brought forth trees
[1:31:34] and herbs thou shalt eat of all the
[1:31:38] herbs and the plants and the things and
[1:31:40] they could eat of it but they could not
[1:31:43] partake of the tree of knowledge of good
[1:31:47] and evil and of that tree in other words
[1:31:51] there was an object that would present
[1:31:53] itself and they must not partake of that
[1:31:56] and I can tell you friends today this is
[1:32:00] not just my own thoughts but you have to
[1:32:03] have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost one
[1:32:08] person goes through further education
[1:32:11] and they can come out fine because they
[1:32:15] keep eating from another tree they keep
[1:32:18] eating from the tree of life which is
[1:32:21] greater than the tree of knowledge of
[1:32:23] good and evil the light that's in the
[1:32:26] believer is greater than the darkness
[1:32:29] that's in the world you say amen to that
[1:32:34] the message is greater and now we have a
[1:32:37] people birth by the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:41] feeding on the word that God gives
[1:32:46] to the believer it's a divine thing you
[1:32:51] have nothing you go to the you go to the
[1:32:54] stored you go to the fruit stand and you
[1:32:57] say well I'll have some of this and I'll
[1:32:59] have some of this dill and I'll have
[1:33:01] some turnips and I'll have you had
[1:33:03] nothing to do with bringing that forth
[1:33:06] the people who we did the garden had
[1:33:09] nothing to do with it
[1:33:10] it grew because God said it back there
[1:33:13] let the earth bring forth and I Drive
[1:33:16] past the fields here on 40th Avenue and
[1:33:20] I think Oh God
[1:33:22] how man just is so benefited from the
[1:33:27] from what you said hundreds and
[1:33:30] thousands of years ago let the earth
[1:33:32] bring forth every season it brings forth
[1:33:36] and we go to the store and we think that
[1:33:38] we're wonderful I'm able to save on
[1:33:41] foods or safely or wherever mourn by all
[1:33:44] of these vegetables we didn't have
[1:33:46] anything to do the man who put them
[1:33:48] there didn't have anything to do the man
[1:33:50] who bought them and paid for them and
[1:33:52] the farmer who sprayed it he doesn't
[1:33:55] have anything to do with that the earth
[1:33:56] brought it forth and our mothers and
[1:34:00] fathers ate it and produced us by the
[1:34:04] act of marriage we didn't have very
[1:34:07] little to do we had very little to do
[1:34:10] with bringing ourselves forth and then
[1:34:12] you went to a church you went to a
[1:34:14] certain place and this one preaches that
[1:34:16] and that one preacher something else it
[1:34:18] and they made denominations and made
[1:34:21] creeds and made books and you had to
[1:34:24] believe these books or some and then
[1:34:26] Satan is so subtle he said say they just
[1:34:29] got books yeah they just got something
[1:34:31] to believe well Jesus also believed
[1:34:36] something
[1:34:39] he said what Moses said to do that do
[1:34:45] but don't be as these people who say it
[1:34:49] but don't do it I stood here in red and
[1:34:54] I felt unworthy reading John 17 don't
[1:35:00] John 17 ever don't ever look upon John
[1:35:03] 17 as just some verses in the Bible it's
[1:35:07] more than that it's a man of God the Son
[1:35:11] of God son of the Living God speaking
[1:35:15] these things to his father and it says
[1:35:17] father I'm no longer in the world but
[1:35:21] these are in the world be with them I've
[1:35:25] kept them from the world he's kept you
[1:35:30] from the world and then he turned around
[1:35:33] and said these are not of the world even
[1:35:36] as I am NOT of the world I'm not the
[1:35:40] product of the world
[1:35:41] I'm the product he didn't even came to
[1:35:44] be the product of Adam and Eve he was a
[1:35:47] product of Almighty God and we have been
[1:35:51] birthed by the Holy Ghost
[1:35:53] we've been birthed that's not just a
[1:35:55] phrase we've been birthed by the Holy
[1:35:58] Spirit of God
[1:35:59] it has brooded upon this word these
[1:36:03] seeds this happens to be God's seed
[1:36:12] human seed brings forth all kinds of
[1:36:15] life human seed brings forth all kinds
[1:36:19] of life some that God will destroy and
[1:36:23] some that God will take as his own
[1:36:27] family human seed you know who are yours
[1:36:32] your relatives
[1:36:34] whatever more but God's seed is this and
[1:36:39] the Holy Spirit comes and broods upon
[1:36:43] this seed and splashed to life
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:49] the human seed the sperm of the man I'm
[1:36:54] speaking now to adults the human sperm
[1:36:57] of the man goes and you'll understand
[1:37:03] something in just a moment but it goes
[1:37:05] and of all those billions of germs one
[1:37:11] will go and attach itself to the egg of
[1:37:17] the female and to the wall where it's
[1:37:22] intended and the organs who put those
[1:37:25] organs there God himself he made the
[1:37:29] whole thing
[1:37:30] who did the conception God and by
[1:37:35] election he elected some some he elected
[1:37:40] this will be my child
[1:37:43] he doesn't care where they were born he
[1:37:46] doesn't care what color they are he
[1:37:49] doesn't care what he gave them the color
[1:37:51] their eyes and the color of their hair
[1:37:53] he gave it all at that time that's God's
[1:37:57] doing aren't we glad for God's plan oh
[1:38:01] thank you friends we think we thank our
[1:38:06] Heavenly Father it is such a marvelous
[1:38:10] plan and then now here is a god he
[1:38:15] brought about the first creation and it
[1:38:18] fell he brought about the second
[1:38:20] creation and it does not fall it does
[1:38:24] not fail and down through the centuries
[1:38:27] he sent his messengers and the world
[1:38:32] slew them jesus said you kill the
[1:38:36] prophets fill up the cup of the prophets
[1:38:40] because fill up the cup of wrath because
[1:38:43] he do they were not accepting him are
[1:38:47] you following me and Almighty God who
[1:38:52] created all things and the earth and all
[1:38:56] of these things he's not going to allow
[1:39:01] he's not going to allow the product of
[1:39:05] the new birth to be overcome by the
[1:39:08] product of the earth he's not going to
[1:39:12] book he's not going to allow the new
[1:39:15] creation to be overcome by the old
[1:39:18] creation and so the Holy Spirit brooded
[1:39:24] upon the earth we know that and up came
[1:39:27] the growth and the vegetables and so on
[1:39:31] and so forth of the Prophet brother
[1:39:33] branham even speaks of it and I hope
[1:39:36] that you have the capacity to understand
[1:39:40] that the product of the old birth has
[1:39:43] brought this life and Satan he just
[1:39:46] plays games he tantalize and with it and
[1:39:49] all kinds of things and makes things
[1:39:52] that are so have such an effect upon the
[1:39:57] emotions and brother Ernie that's why I
[1:39:59] so enjoyed the service that he took the
[1:40:03] power of the senses and how Satan so
[1:40:06] tantalizes those senses and and anyone
[1:40:10] who has not got the new birth they'll be
[1:40:13] taken by these but when you have the new
[1:40:17] birth it's not when you're old and
[1:40:20] naturally when you have the new birth I
[1:40:22] didn't have any interest in the world
[1:40:25] when I was just a teenager before we
[1:40:28] were married I had a vehicle and I had
[1:40:31] guys that could come by they come by
[1:40:33] where I worked and say do you want a
[1:40:36] drag race I thought drag race are you
[1:40:40] crazy why did I think that what he
[1:40:44] thought was exciting was it crazy to me
[1:40:47] I don't know I don't know I can't
[1:40:50] explain that I just can't explain that
[1:40:54] and here I got something you know I want
[1:40:57] to ask you I was age some of you young
[1:41:01] men I had to work to we had to work and
[1:41:08] earn very little money it was before
[1:41:12] credit cards
[1:41:13] and I couldn't run up the gas pumps and
[1:41:16] get money that way get credited that way
[1:41:21] but I had a hunger just want to want to
[1:41:26] ask you about that's why I'm standing
[1:41:27] here today had a hunger a hunger I was
[1:41:32] so hungry
[1:41:33] for the things of God so we heard that
[1:41:37] there was a meeting my wife went with a
[1:41:40] friend and some pick up her car or
[1:41:43] something I didn't know it was 350 miles
[1:41:47] for where we lived I got on a motorcycle
[1:41:51] I had a motorcycle I had to work until 5
[1:41:55] or 6 o'clock and after that that I got
[1:41:58] on the motorcycle and started to drive
[1:42:01] into Alberta to northern Alberta to a
[1:42:07] city called Manning Alberta there was
[1:42:11] very little pavement it was mostly it
[1:42:14] was cold colder that it is outside but
[1:42:18] it reminds me of the time this is still
[1:42:22] the same person it was these legs I
[1:42:27] threw over a motorcycle and I got and we
[1:42:32] didn't have nice outfits that you could
[1:42:35] buy there were weather proof and I drove
[1:42:39] tell away late in the night and it was
[1:42:43] becoming one on two o'clock in the
[1:42:44] morning and past Grand Prairie brother
[1:42:47] Tim and over the smokey River and I got
[1:42:52] it got very cold at night and I was
[1:42:55] pounding these legs to keep them from
[1:43:00] freezing yeah these lace legs of the
[1:43:07] earth legs is the first creation but
[1:43:11] inside was another creation
[1:43:15] inside there was a hunger the no man was
[1:43:19] so hungry for God and I pulled into a
[1:43:25] place I see light often and I just have
[1:43:29] something in the human nature I just oh
[1:43:31] I don't want to bother people I don't
[1:43:33] want to I don't want to interrupt their
[1:43:36] evening as one as put two o'clock in the
[1:43:39] morning and then there was light right
[1:43:43] beside the road in a little log house so
[1:43:46] I just pulled quickly off I couldn't go
[1:43:49] any further and I leave my motorcycle
[1:43:52] against the wall came to the front door
[1:43:54] just heard of man inside y'all come on
[1:43:57] em so I opened the door and here's a guy
[1:44:00] at the back and he's got his feet up on
[1:44:02] the table he's reading a book he said
[1:44:07] you ever hear this author he named the
[1:44:10] author I thought I'm a total stranger
[1:44:12] but we know we never worried about
[1:44:15] anybody coming in to rob anybody
[1:44:17] yeah that was out of our mind and he
[1:44:20] said do you ever read a book by this
[1:44:22] soul I said no I haven't no I never did
[1:44:24] so I said listen I I just I just came up
[1:44:29] with a motorcycle I said I didn't hear I
[1:44:31] said yeah I parked it right outside and
[1:44:34] I said I'm just wondering if he got a
[1:44:37] place I should kind of camp over the
[1:44:40] night oh yeah I says bedrooms right
[1:44:43] there you can stay there I don't know
[1:44:45] why I don't know his name I don't know
[1:44:48] anything about him I don't know if it
[1:44:49] was married or not married it probably
[1:44:51] wasn't
[1:44:52] but anyway said you didn't just stay
[1:44:54] there I'll make it bacon eggs in the
[1:44:56] morning and so I never did find out his
[1:44:59] name and I prayed God just make a place
[1:45:04] to give him a bed some place some time
[1:45:07] and I got up in the morning and went the
[1:45:09] rest of the way you know why and then
[1:45:12] there was about four inches of snow
[1:45:14] fresh snow and the cars were going by an
[1:45:17] a started to melt and they thought it
[1:45:19] was fun you know they just splash splash
[1:45:21] me up with with their cars they sped by
[1:45:25] that was the only direction only time we
[1:45:27] had a little
[1:45:28] better pavement and I finished off the
[1:45:32] trip why I'm just hungry for a meeting I
[1:45:36] just want to be in church that night I
[1:45:38] don't know the name of the pastor yes I
[1:45:41] do his name was Erickson I think he was
[1:45:44] a Baptist Baptist and organization
[1:45:47] didn't mean nothing didn't mean nothing
[1:45:50] it was in that atmosphere the prophet of
[1:45:54] God's ministry was born and that's one
[1:45:58] we just accepted this is just a natural
[1:46:02] thing and you know what we said we said
[1:46:05] he's a prophet we didn't we didn't know
[1:46:08] any of the scripture we didn't know
[1:46:09] Malachi for we didn't know revelation 10
[1:46:12] we said there's a prophet
[1:46:14] this is what a prophet does this is what
[1:46:17] a prophet says and so we went to that
[1:46:20] meeting and and I'm just gonna tell you
[1:46:24] this and I'm finished with it that night
[1:46:30] I stated in the sleeping bag with four
[1:46:34] or five other brothers at the back of
[1:46:36] the church in the kitchen or something
[1:46:38] and I got down in that sleeping bag and
[1:46:42] I got such a burden I got I to intercede
[1:46:47] I didn't know what a hardly intercession
[1:46:50] was but I knew what a burden was friends
[1:46:54] this is a real life this isn't just
[1:46:57] going to church Sunday morning this is
[1:46:59] going so hungry and so sensitive to the
[1:47:04] Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit can
[1:47:07] speak or can lay something on your heart
[1:47:10] you don't have to be thinking about what
[1:47:12] you're going to do tomorrow it's God
[1:47:15] Almighty thinking what he's going to do
[1:47:17] tomorrow
[1:47:18] and so I I rolled and I wept and I
[1:47:23] groaned and I didn't know what I was
[1:47:25] praying for and I groaned and rolled
[1:47:27] until I just was weak and I finally just
[1:47:31] went to sleep in the morning the pastor
[1:47:35] I've never heard he got up in the
[1:47:38] morning and he said
[1:47:40] we grieved the holy spirit last night he
[1:47:48] said we grieved the holy spirit last
[1:47:50] night I didn't know what he was talking
[1:47:54] about then he said somebody prayed and I
[1:48:01] went to him right after the service and
[1:48:03] told him what happened to me said that
[1:48:05] was it he never said anything further so
[1:48:11] there was a almost like a little mystery
[1:48:18] to the whole thing you know brother
[1:48:21] Branham speaks about people who are led
[1:48:25] by the Holy Ghost and there are almost
[1:48:28] mystics to the world the world can
[1:48:32] understand that isn't two and two makes
[1:48:34] four that is that's above algebra that's
[1:48:37] that's something from another realm but
[1:48:40] when you're born again you're dictated
[1:48:44] to by the Holy Spirit and we have those
[1:48:48] things I don't tell about a lot of those
[1:48:51] things that happen regularly in this
[1:48:54] congregation supernatural things and
[1:48:58] that's what makes me to know there's a
[1:49:01] God in heaven as ordained Himself is
[1:49:06] ordained that we should believe and
[1:49:09] furthermore that is why ministry comes
[1:49:14] behind this pulpit and begins to speak
[1:49:20] from the message from the word and here
[1:49:25] I'm going to make known to you something
[1:49:28] that perhaps hasn't come to your mind
[1:49:33] the Prophet said lay sell upon sell sell
[1:49:42] upon sell do you know anything about
[1:49:46] your body forming that you're sitting in
[1:49:50] right now is you
[1:49:52] you know anything about performing you
[1:49:54] weren't around did you give any
[1:49:58] instruction or direction
[1:50:00] did your mother or father give any
[1:50:03] instruction or direction is how he's
[1:50:07] going to be this house she's gonna be it
[1:50:12] didn't have anything to do with it and
[1:50:19] now a message comes and you don't know
[1:50:23] anything about the servant the vessel
[1:50:27] and God is pushing himself himself
[1:50:33] through clay redeemed clay and it takes
[1:50:41] a vessel and people to me it's so absurd
[1:50:47] forgive me but I think that people will
[1:50:51] rise themselves up in their mind and say
[1:50:53] well I this is what I think of William
[1:50:55] Branham and this is what I think of the
[1:50:57] Pope and this is what I think who cares
[1:50:59] what you think
[1:51:01] God's already decided God's already got
[1:51:05] election God is saying and I am saying
[1:51:09] on his behalf
[1:51:10] God says election is mine I do what I
[1:51:14] will I do what I intend to do and I will
[1:51:18] fulfill it you you can wrestle all you
[1:51:23] wish friends but God in the end his Will
[1:51:27] shall be done and the elects sake I will
[1:51:32] be done on earth as it is in heaven
[1:51:38] this is mine you are my father and this
[1:51:42] is my attitude towards you I bless your
[1:51:46] name I worship you because you have
[1:51:50] brought me your holy spirit has has
[1:51:53] brooded over the words how will I how I
[1:51:57] know which words it is he selected
[1:52:00] certain ones he selected a message for
[1:52:04] Philadelphia for Thyatira and verse
[1:52:06] artists and he selected a message from
[1:52:09] Laodicea and he says to John write and
[1:52:15] tell him who's speaking
[1:52:17] I'm the faithful one I'm the a man of
[1:52:21] God
[1:52:22] I'm the faithful messenger and write
[1:52:26] these things to the angel or to the
[1:52:29] messenger the angel of the church and I
[1:52:38] wonder I had not intended on saying much
[1:52:46] about this
[1:53:20] you're familiar with all the destruction
[1:53:24] that's been taking place and I'm just
[1:53:32] reading what others have said the 2018
[1:53:38] wildfire session is the most destructive
[1:53:43] on record in California with a total of
[1:53:49] seven thousand five hundred and seventy
[1:53:52] nine fires burning an area of 1 million
[1:53:59] six hundred and sixty seven thousand
[1:54:02] eight hundred and fifty five acres the
[1:54:09] largest amount of burned acreage
[1:54:12] recorded in a fire season according the
[1:54:19] California Department of Forestry
[1:54:25] brother branham spoke a message in Yuma
[1:54:29] Arizona right on the border on December
[1:54:35] the 4th in 1965 listen close now if you
[1:54:41] were Almighty God women man if you were
[1:54:48] Almighty God and you could sit on your
[1:54:52] throne you say well now this is the last
[1:55:01] message and I send it to the earth
[1:55:11] and I've said to my Apostle John
[1:55:17] I showed him gave him the message to the
[1:55:22] lay of the sins now I want you to write
[1:55:27] write it and send it to the angel of
[1:55:33] that church and now the great eternal
[1:55:38] God when that season comes his spirit is
[1:55:46] directed his spirit who's the author of
[1:55:49] this word see now there's a certain
[1:55:54] thing that must be said and I want you
[1:56:00] now to brood over these cells brood over
[1:56:09] this might eternal life giving Word of
[1:56:13] God there will be some elected people
[1:56:18] they will be living by the first birth
[1:56:26] but I am not willing that they shall be
[1:56:31] destroyed I am not willing that my enemy
[1:56:35] our enemy Satan should foil my plan they
[1:56:41] shall come forth and I shall send this
[1:56:45] holy spirit my spirit to brood over the
[1:56:49] earth now the word has gone yeah they
[1:56:54] put it into books they put into all
[1:56:56] kinds of theological seminaries etc and
[1:57:00] have declared this and that and the
[1:57:02] other thing but I have a prophet down
[1:57:05] there and I want you to get this message
[1:57:09] to him and let him identify himself in
[1:57:14] the scripture in my word let him
[1:57:18] identify himself he's the one who must
[1:57:21] speak
[1:57:21] and say these things and this is the one
[1:57:25] this is the almighty speaking this is
[1:57:28] the Amen the faithful and true witness
[1:57:31] furthermore this is the beginning of the
[1:57:35] creation of God and brood over these
[1:57:42] words and as it's brooding over the
[1:57:46] words the brooding of the great son of
[1:57:51] God shines upon stones nothing happens
[1:57:58] shines upon some part of Earth and maybe
[1:58:04] vegetation comes but signs upon some
[1:58:08] wheat gathered into my car I have much
[1:58:15] to say and at the end of this age these
[1:58:19] are the things that are going to take
[1:58:21] place and this prophet his book is the
[1:58:29] message of rapture you plan to be in the
[1:58:33] rapture he spoke about the rapture this
[1:58:36] is the fourth the last message that he
[1:58:40] speaks and as three hours and 41 minutes
[1:58:44] by car to go to Rialto California and
[1:58:50] there he will preach things that are to
[1:58:54] be and this is where much of this
[1:58:59] message even came from he speaks of the
[1:59:04] relationship and now of the coming of
[1:59:11] the children coming forth and then 40
[1:59:19] minutes from there 40 minutes he'll
[1:59:24] speak the next night in San Bernardino
[1:59:27] and he will speak their modern events
[1:59:32] made clear by prophecy
[1:59:35] and in that service he says this is a
[1:59:38] horrible time but it's the most glorious
[1:59:43] time in the world to preach the gospel
[1:59:48] what's he talking to talking about the
[1:59:50] tooth to move to to creations
[1:59:54] it's a horrible time for the lost it's
[1:59:58] the most glorious time to preach the
[2:00:01] gospel that's the only way you can have
[2:00:04] a horrible time in a wonderful time my
[2:00:07] friends believe her friends this is a
[2:00:12] horrible time but it's a glorious time
[2:00:16] to stand for Christ and for the new
[2:00:20] creation of God the most glorious time
[2:00:27] to preach the gospel if I could have
[2:00:31] stood on the brink of time before it
[2:00:34] came into existence and the father would
[2:00:38] have looked at me and said what time
[2:00:42] down through the ages would you want to
[2:00:45] preach I'd want it right now that's
[2:00:52] right just before the coming just before
[2:00:59] the coming of hell oh if I could only
[2:01:03] preach just before he comes just before
[2:01:09] this rapture which he described just two
[2:01:12] days ago I would want to preach at this
[2:01:16] time even though it's a terrible time
[2:01:19] it's a wicked time and the thoughts of
[2:01:23] man's mind and intent are only evil
[2:01:26] continually
[2:01:29] friends this world is fitted for
[2:01:32] destruction
[2:01:34] California will be just child's play
[2:01:39] alongside of what's going to happen the
[2:01:42] prophet of God spoke about the earth
[2:01:45] erupting and coming forth I'll tell you
[2:01:52] what even down in Hawaii they even tried
[2:01:55] to figure out how to stop the lava they
[2:02:01] couldn't stop it and couldn't stop it
[2:02:04] from burning the tribe this prophet of
[2:02:07] God said and you can take whatever
[2:02:10] direction you want to take I just say I
[2:02:12] believe it he said the earth will burst
[2:02:15] forth so I don't believe in some someone
[2:02:19] might say I don't believe in the hell
[2:02:21] you're standing on Earth is sitting this
[2:02:23] morning Sunday morning on a whole globe
[2:02:26] full of it 40 minutes from San
[2:02:38] Bernardino and he was in Covina to
[2:02:43] preach the last service I suggest you
[2:02:47] read all of those rapture three hours 40
[2:02:55] minutes later things that are to be 40
[2:03:01] minutes another direction to Covina and
[2:03:04] Neri preaches leadership and he asks in
[2:03:09] there who's leading you now who's
[2:03:15] leaving you now what about a young
[2:03:21] fellows well my teacher or my professor

[2:03:33] be around my boss my superior said I was
[2:03:37] doing this I was doing that but what
[2:03:41] does he say that's the one to listen to
[2:03:47] that's the one to listen to and all
[2:03:51] these other things we may just use use
[2:03:56] them but say this life will be given to
[2:04:03] hunger after God that doesn't mean we
[2:04:07] just walk around you know and do nothing
[2:04:09] no but we have a direction and God is
[2:04:13] our direction

[2:11:34] [Applause]
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:12:21] the musicians continued to play I
[2:12:24] thought it was just the Lord that we
[2:12:27] showed a picture of a little baby at the
[2:12:30] beginning of a service the natural but
[2:12:35] how greater is that spiritual birth that
[2:12:40] joy that bring that little baby will
[2:12:41] bring a home will be just tremendous but
[2:12:45] the joy that brings the body of Christ
[2:12:46] is a new birth and that is the most
[2:12:50] important thing not allowing the new
[2:12:53] creation to be overcome from the old
[2:12:55] creation this new creation that God is
[2:12:58] creating there's a deep calling to the
[2:13:01] deep I don't know about you but that's
[2:13:03] all I've been in in the last few days
[2:13:05] future home things that are to be it's a
[2:13:08] call it's a poll we're living in the two
[2:13:12] realms in the two worlds but I'm so
[2:13:15] thankful at a horrible time as the
[2:13:18] pastor was saying this is the most
[2:13:21] glorious time for the elect of God and
[2:13:24] if you haven't come to this knowledge of
[2:13:27] salvation or Jesus Christ as a personal
[2:13:31] Savior maybe this is your service and
[2:13:34] the Holy Spirit is tugging at your heart
[2:13:36] saying just surrender I feel appalled I
[2:13:40] want to pass from death unto life I want
[2:13:43] to go into his glorious Kingdom I want
[2:13:46] to be carried away I want to be raptured
[2:13:48] I want to be changed maybe the word is
[2:13:51] speaking to you because each and every
[2:13:54] one must be born again
[2:13:58] I feel
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:49] [Music]
[2:14:56] it's bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[2:15:00] maybe there's somebody here this morning
[2:15:02] that actually feels the pole or the tug
[2:15:05] of the Holy Spirit and God's dealing
[2:15:09] with your heart and you on a surrender
[2:15:12] in a greater way a more consecrated way
[2:15:16] a more dedicated way as a scripture was
[2:15:21] read this morning you must be born again
[2:15:24] it's not an option it's it's it's
[2:15:28] something that it comes from within and
[2:15:33] if you're here this morning you just
[2:15:35] want to lift up your heart lift up your
[2:15:37] hand and say lord save me deliver me set
[2:15:43] me free from the entanglements of sin
[2:15:47] and depression for the burden of being
[2:15:51] lost no hope nowhere to go
[2:15:55] but there's something within you that it
[2:15:57] feels the pull that said Lord here am i
[2:16:00] Lord save me save me Lord and Lord with
[2:16:08] these hands and different ones raised
[2:16:10] around the room you know the heart
[2:16:15] you know the reason where some feel the
[2:16:20] pull and others it just goes right over
[2:16:23] so father I pray that that hand and lift
[2:16:26] it up that God you'll reach down your
[2:16:29] hand and he'll start and Kindle a fire
[2:16:32] that will never be quenched Lord that
[2:16:35] the Holy Spirit Himself would breathe
[2:16:38] upon that life and bring forth a new
[2:16:40] creation by the word of life that was
[2:16:44] spoken this morning confirm your word
[2:16:47] Lord confirm it in the hearts of your
[2:16:50] children and let the Holy Ghost have its
[2:16:54] free course and committing these hands
[2:16:58] in these lives and these needs to you in

[2:22:19] that we can ascend may God bless you may
[2:22:22] the presence of God go with you may you
