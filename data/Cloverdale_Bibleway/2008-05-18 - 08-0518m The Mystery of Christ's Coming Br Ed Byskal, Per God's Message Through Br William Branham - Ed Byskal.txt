That's why he came to love me so he be my fault and s [Music] my eyes to How to cross where Jesus died for me. Oh, how the grace of my heart. [Music] He loves me. I fall and saw my Amen. I've got I'm so glad we've got a God that looked past all of our faults, all of our failures. And I was reading this morning and he called us his bride. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful privilege we have. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. This morning, I'd like to maybe do things a little different, but I'd like to uh start off with He Knows My Name, number 979 on the screen. And then after we sing that, I like Jeremy, Lesie, and Flo and Liz to come up. They'll sing a song. I have a m [Music] and before I began my life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my every sing and hear me when I [Music] have a father. [Music] and you me no matter where I go. [Music] He know he knows my name.

Brother Jeremy met me this morning in the study and said, "We've got a song that we'd like to sing and if you want to come and listen to it." And I said, "Sure." So, I went into the the music room and and listened to it and and I I just felt led in my heart that this is something that we should maybe have right at the beginning of the service. And I know Wednesday night we had uh our brother Jason here preaching and uh how many how many had a need need met Wednesday night? I know I was sitting right where brother Ron Garrick's sitting and there was something specific on my heart and it took brother Jason Walkin from 2500 miles away to come and the Lord met my need &gt;&gt; and this this is this song is called by his word and I know many times uh a couple of times know brother Ed has has through ministry and the ministry ministry here when they've spoken they said think of something specific that you need and the Lord will will will meet And I think this song is something that will bring us to a place where I believe our our needs will be answered. So I want you, as our pastor said, I want you to think of something specific that you want met this morning. And I've I was in the study and I told Brother Tom when he came in, we talked about we kind of joke back back and forth about pacing. You're nervous, but I just feel really heavy on my heart and I was just pacing back and forth said, "Lord, whatever it is, whatever you need from us this morning. Meet my need. Meet our people's need. You know, you're worthy. You met me Wednesday. I believe today you can meet us today. So I want you, this is just Brother Jason. I'm just a nobody, you know, but I really love you and I appreciate you." And I just think just pick something in your life that you want him to meet and I believe he'll meet you. And then after that we'll we'll join them in the course. [Music] It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. And by his word, he gave his son for us on Calary to pay the price of sin for you and for me. &gt;&gt; By his word, &gt;&gt; he raised the sick man from the bed. &gt;&gt; He gave life unto the dead. Oh, he brings hope to the hopeless. By his word &gt;&gt; you can have the victory &gt;&gt; for he has set the captive free. &gt;&gt; Oh he gives life to you and me. [Music] Just one word was broken in Eden and that's what caused the fall. So it would take all of the word to bring us back to God. And through this last day message, all his word has been made known. And through his power, we shall overcome his word. He spoke and squirrels did. Storm go back from where you came. Little fish, I give you back your life. He spoke the tumor out of existence. &gt;&gt; By his word, &gt;&gt; he gives to voice salvation. &gt;&gt; By his word, he gives life to you and me.

But I'm ask brother Ken Andes, Brother Kenny, if you'd come open the service in a word of prayer. We want to remember Sister Doris Hayes. She was taken Friday by ambulance to the hospital. Today they're doing an ambiogram. They believe that she's got some blockages in her heart. So we want to pray for her. Also, our sister Melissa Walman was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital this morning. The doctors are not too sure what the complications are. And uh Sister Gail Kemper has written here. We just want to remember her sister Lori as uh she just had an operation. There are also some complications and are now having to do some tests. Pray that all goes well and that the Lord would just draw her closer to himself. Amen. By his word. Just claim it. Amen. It's yours. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ken, if you can pray. Heavenly Father, we're thankful to come into your presence this morning, well aware of the power of your word, the power of cross, and the shed blood of Christ. Lord Jesus, I pray that you would increase our faith even now while we think upon these needs, Sister Lauren, Sister Woman, and Lord Jesus, these needs, Father, upon the lives of the people and so many unspoken requests in our congregation here out upon the internet. Lord, each life is so near and dear to you, so precious. And Father, as we lay our hands upon the bloody sacrifice of Jesus Christ this morning, believing that everything that we have need of and each need specifically being mentioned up by our prayers this morning shall be answered by no less than the power of the living God that created the universe. Come near, Lord, unto each worshshiper. Come near upon unto each family, Lord, each member of that family. We pray, heavenly father, that the sick would be healed according to our prayer of faith and that wonderful impossibilities would come to pass by the spoken word of our hearts this morning. And Lord Jesus, as we've come to hear your word, we pray Lord Jesus that you'll anoint our pastor. That you'll anoint our lives as well, unite us together by the Holy Ghost to every spoken word that we know that your prophet William Brandham has brought to us. And Father, in this end time, we are laying hold upon eternal life. every word that you have spoken, our dear Lord Jesus, we commit the remainder of the service to you, Father, for your wonderful works to be done among us. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may have your seats. [Music] Amen. God bless you. It's good to have you in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you're visiting with us and we got on telephone hookup, we want to say God bless you. It's good to have you.

Um, David Roy and Sister Naomi Fairclav's wedding is going to be on Saturday, May 24th. Uh, the ceremony will be held at 10:30 for all those who would like to attend. Brother John and Sister Leah Brryer are happy to announce the arrival of their daughter weighing in at 8 lb 13 oz, 22 in long. We just want to thank the Lord for his goodness. Amen. And there'll be a short meeting uh just for the graduates only for this year in the music room after the morning service. And the Russians can come. Russian believers, wherever you're hiding, don't be afraid. I do this all the time. All right. And then we have um uh this announcement here. We are having a 10-minute meeting immediately following this morning's service uh in the fellowship room for anyone interested in assisting with the summer camp in any capacity, which includes counselor, assistant counselors, helpers kitchen, or in the drama section. uh it's imperative that that you attend.

Can I praise him? I'll praise him. Oh, I praise him. I praise the lamb that was slain. Praise him. How praise him. How praise the lamb that was made. Would it be wonderful just take some time this morning and say, "Praise him." &gt;&gt; I will praise him. Isn't he lovely? Isn't he wonderful? Has he been good to you? &gt;&gt; So wonderful. Look around you. Look where you could have been. Look where you are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Where would you have been without this gospel? Where would you have been without this Christ? Oh, and here we have the opportunity this morning just to give him thanks and praise. Wonderful Lord Jesus. How we love you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Well, you have a few things to say before we start the message this morning. We're really grateful to see everyone here, those that may be visiting and those that have been welcomed. We welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Only one service today. Brother Tony will be speaking on Wednesday night. So, we'll be able to hear of all of their uh journeys at the meetings and what God has done in the last three months or so in uh Middle East countries. Uh we are so thankful for the hour that we're in. &gt;&gt; It's a golden age. &gt;&gt; It's an age that's full of uh uh many events and we're not able to even keep a breast of them. I thought of the scripture this morning that when Jesus had spoke in Matthew 24 and we will be there a little later on but he said when you see the abomination of the desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place and then he added these words who so readeth let him understand didn't say who so seeth in other words we don't have to wait for the event people see events and then they at all. Oh, where is that? No, what we need to do is we see it written, &gt;&gt; we hear hear it spoken by God's messenger, and that's sufficient. &gt;&gt; It's as it's as good as done. &gt;&gt; When we hear it, and when we see it written, who so readth, let him understand. &gt;&gt; If we have to wait to see it to get all inspired, you're too late. &gt;&gt; That's the whole problem. always been too late. Wasn't Elijah supposed to come? Isn't the rapture supposed to come? That's too late. It's who so readeth, let them understand because uh the believer who receives the word by faith, it's already finished. It's already finished. Whether we live to see it or don't live to see it or whatever or it may happen and we wouldn't even I be able to identify it exactly, but once we read it, let him understand it's a finished fact. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we approach him that way. I want to uh make uh a couple of announcements and next Sunday also is one service uh and we're we're dealing with uh in the complications at the border and there are going to be some added complications because the uh on the US uh border at peace arts they're going to commence uh going to commence construction uh they have commenced construction but they're going to shut down some of the lanes that they have there. And so we're we're looking at that to address that situation. Uh our brother DJ's father, brother Coli, was taken to the hospital and uh uh they've determined that they've given him a calf scan right away and they've determined that there's some bleeding in the brain, which is not good. Uh they're taking him to the Royal Colombian Hospital. So, we want to have prayer for him this morning. And I have a couple other requests. I know you've had prayer already, but my aunt, my aunt Ethel, uh, she's in the hospital. I told her yesterday that we would be remembering her and this whole congregation. We remember her in prayer. She's of a Catholic background, same background. My parents came from, same family. and uh uh but she has she has seen so many things. uh she has been to various weddings and different functions here at the church and uh I believe she was speaking to uh Sister Keer once and uh uh they got talking about their background and I somebody said I don't know whether it was uh Sister Keer said to her that you know uh well I don't know why I wasn't here or something and she says well I don't know why I'm not here too sort of thing and that's kind of the mind she actually came over to our house here just a few weeks ago and she wanted me to pray for her. That's never happened in all these years. She wanted prayer. She asked that we would remember her in prayer again. And uh she goes in for open heart surgery uh this week, I think about Thursday. So if you just remember her, I can see a light is turning on on the inside and she has more confidence in in uh your prayers. Uh and and so I I just am praying for illumination in her soul. And I I've spoken to her very very directly about salvation, about calling on the name of the Lord and being saved. I'd like to remember also brother Jim Douly's family uh brother Jim's uh sister her her name is Win she passed away yesterday morning he said just about the time of sunrise she passed into eternity and he had prayed with her also dealt with her she also is from a Catholic background as brother Jim is and uh uh he said that she had made her peace with God and he was satisfied with that. Uh he was still looking to the Lord knowing that all things are possible with God. She was 64 years old. uh and uh but she has passed away. Her funeral service will be on Tuesday. And I although brother Jim Douly is not one that shows he doesn't show his burdens and he doesn't speak his burdens to others, but I I felt led of the Lord to say some things to him in an email. Uh he has been a real tower of strength not only within his family but his extended family. And you know, sometimes it takes a crisis just such as this for an unbelieving person to finally reach the point where they can say, "It's your God that I trust in. &gt;&gt; It's your God that I recognize. The God you serve is God." And so, however, whatever it takes, we just pray. I pray that people don't have to wait that long. I would like to serve God all my life. Wouldn't you? And so you young people, you have such a you have a privilege that many people don't get to have and we want to so I want to remember the Douly family. So I wonder if you would just stand with me once again before we go any further in the service. I'd like to remember these three and uh um I'd like to sing Bring all your needs to the altar. Brother Ryan, bring all your knees to the altar. [Music] Oh, great [Music] to [Music] for a to help you. Oh, bring all your peace to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I felt we would sing that, but then I would like to add another verse to that and that is leave it there. Leave it there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you've brought your need to the altar, don't go and pack it away. Leave it there. Leave all all your burdens there. Leave it there. Leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. &gt;&gt; Leave it there. Leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out. Oh, take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. Leave it there. [Applause] Leave it there. Oh, take your words to the Lord and be there. If you trust and never down, he will surely bring you out. take your burdens to the Lord and be there. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what we're doing, Lord Jesus. We've brought our needs to the altar. We've heard the prayer that's been prayed earlier in the service. And we thank you, oh God, for the faith that is in the hearts of the people. And faith that cometh by the word of God, by hearing the word, by receiving the word, and by believing it. You've made so many promises, Lord, and we have no one else to come to. So, we're coming, Lord, and we're leaving our burden here. We're asking that you'll be with brother uh Jim and sister Lynn, oh God, and the extended family. The words that have been spoken, oh God, I pray the words that have been spoken by brother Jim will be so anchored, oh God, and as the as the rest of the family looks to him as a spiritual guide, spiritual counsel, I pray the Holy Spirit will be in attendance. Lord, just anchor the words. I pray illuminate darkened places, oh God, and darkened hearts. And may they who are still unbelieving receive you. I know this is brother Jim Sister Lynn's prayer. And all that are uh all that are part of the family, I pray that you will deal with them. And now, Lord, we're lifting up our brother Columb. You've been so gracious to him, oh God. He's been in several crises, but you have intervened time after time. And I know, oh God, brother Dier, sister Les Leanne are praying. I know that Sister Columbi is praying. And so you have said in your word, when one suffers, we all suffer. When one rejoices, we all rejoice. So we all are praying now, our Lord. Now we're praying for these that are carrying this burden. And we're praying, oh God, that you will deliver, I pray, to the room where brother Columb is. Deliver the sufficient virtue, oh God. Deliver, I pray, the power that will cauterize the bleeding, oh God. And that the bleeding may cease. Father, we have here even standing in the in the service this morning our sister Sally Dodds who the medical science and the medical profession gave up on said she couldn't survive. Oh God, but you wrote a different record. You brought her out, Lord, and she's with us this morning worshiping and she's been with us all this time. And I pray you'll raise up brother Columb. Oh God, raise him up once again in the name of Jesus Christ. hear us, Father. Do what we cannot do, but we're believing your word and trusting you. And my aunt, oh God, sister, in my sister's aunt, Father, I pray that you will remember her, oh God. And she's a got a soft heart, Lord. Pray you'll touch her heart, Father. I ask that you'll illuminate, Lord, and brush aside all the darkness in the traditions of that church. Oh God, I pray you'll move it aside and let her spirit taste of truth, Father. She believe she's seen it. She has seen it in your in your believers, Father. And I pray, oh God, that you'll satisfy that hunger and see her through this operation, oh God, as as it is needed. And I ask, Father, for your grace upon her life. And now, Father, we'll soon be turning to the word. I ask that you will just give special utterance to your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Just while you're standing, before we read the scripture, I want to give a special thanks on behalf of uh Brother Randy sent me an email said to be sure and thank you. I spoke with brother uh Chris Peterson this morning as well. And brother Randy, both of them. We the the men all the men that came to the camp the last two days. It's just absolutely miraculous. You can see some uh pictures if you wish on the notice board outside. wanted to have a few slides for you this morning, but we have so much to to go through. Uh, but it was they just started from a slab, a cement slab, and in the two days the whole building is up. The partitions are all in. Some of the plumbing is already been finished. The roof is just got to be sheetated. It's all on and tar papered and the trusses are up is and two days. This building's 24x 40 ft. This is no small shack. It's uh houses all the electrical equipment and the sprinkler system and the uh washrooms for ladies and men. So when we have special meetings, we will have be able to have those washrooms. And it gave us more room in the chapel. I pasted out uh Friday when I was there and that chapel will probably seat 325 people comfortably. And that's very very wonderful. It's going to be a wonderful um uh a wonderful facility. Now, I just want to have you standing for a few minutes cuz I'm going to be standing for a while yet, too. So, that's fine. You folks get to sit down five minutes or so. I have never really spoken what my vision for this camp has been. Well, you might as well sit down. Thank you. But soon as we say camp here, the only uh the only mental picture I think that we have as you know we have a youth camp, we have a family camp etc etc. My vision for the camp has been completely different from day one. Absolutely different from day one. And I was even waiting till we would have a presentation to be able to show you. so that you could follow through pictorially and and visually uh see what's going to uh take place. I'm looking upon it as being um moving towards and eventually being a believer's retreat. when we want to go someplace, believers, uh, well, we we go, you know, every place we go, even if it's to go out and have a something to eat, it's always a worldly atmosphere and with worldly people and so on so forth. So I looked upon this as a yearround place where believers can go because the camp as it is right now, excuse me, and the way they've operated it, they've been able to have uh several camps going simultaneously. They might have one. One time when I was there some months ago, they had a a Korean Christian group was up in one area about 18 or so, and they would cook for themselves as they wanted to cook for themselves. Then there was a group down here that was about 50 people, but they needed uh meals from the dining room. And then there was a larger group and they of course were having meals from the dining room. So in the meantime, uh, Bill and Donna Gene who have been managing the camp out there, they always are, you know, uh, needing to handle all the logistics of who's coming and what will be needed, etc. And I think doing a lot of that manually. Uh, brother Jack Aguiri has has been taken on and he is, uh, learning all that aspect of it. But I envision that let's say that uh uh any of you families that are here, you may have some uh believers that are visiting you or some of your family that's visiting you and would want to be able to take them out. And I think I've just said a wee bit about this before, but now I want to enlarge on it a wee bit. And I could say that there would be perhaps a group of of of people from the church or families from the church, uh, visiting friends coming from overseas or coming from wherever. And to be able to go out there at any time of the year, winter or summer, to be able to go out there and say, "Well, you know, this time we we'll we'll we'll look after our own meals or this time we would sooner, you know, just have the meals in the dining room and then to be able to utilize that as a place where you can just go. I'd like to take my family. I'd like two, three of our families, we'd want to go or some of our friends, we want to go and we're just going to spend uh uh some of the time out there even if it was over a weekend because you're only one hour at the most to come into church and you could attend attend. So, you're don't have to give up services like going to the mountain someplace and well, we can't get to church because we're 3 4 hours away or 5 hours away. You won't be in that situation. and and uh to be able to make use of this place. It's a place where the the school can go out and have a a nature study and be overnight and maybe be over a couple of days uh some of the seniors from the school. Um uh and then we're it's open to us to use for say for families. We could have uh we could have ministers uh gatherings there. We can have just any number of people within the congregation. We want to be able to open it up and other congregations of believers and they that may want to come from other places because it will be uh it was so magnificent. I understand that when we were all done on Friday night, I left uh about quarter 6 and uh and the brothers were just winding up some of the work there. Uh, I guess the moon came out over Mount Baker and uh the beauty of it all that Brother Chris, didn't you just stay there? See, he stays there all day, but it it's so beautiful. He just couldn't tear himself away. So, he just sat down and drank in the beauty of it. It was just so so marvelous. I'd like I'd like to say also about the So, it's not merely a camp. It is a believer's retreat. And I'm I would like you to become acquainted with that term, a believer's retreat. It's a place where you could perhaps go on and we want to I'm trusting that brother Darren will be able to write the program. They're looking into the programs right now where you would be able to go on and say, do you know what? We just like to get away. There's eight or 10 of us or whatever more. There's three or four families. We just like to get away or and we like to be there. You be able to go on to the website. The website is already finished. If you went on to it, uh it's mountbaker Bibleway.org, I believe. And uh it's a beautiful website, but we're going to be adding to that website. So, you'll be able to go on and find what what what cabins and what facilities are available. You could just click on there and see that. Oh, that's available from Thursday right through to Monday. Okay. We'd like to stay there. Yes, we'd like to stay there. Click. Okay, it's available. We have it. Uh, do you want meals? Yes, we'd like to have meals. So then already the the dining room knows that you're you're going to be there. Believers are going to be there. And uh so I envision it to be entirely utilized by believers eventually. That's the direction. And uh it it and quite frankly it's a it's a very very uh very it's not just a possibility. I believe you'll live to see that's exactly what's going to happen unless the Lord takes us in the rapture and we'll be camping on the hills of glory. So and that that'll be fine with us. And when you see the number of uh people both children and young people that are adults in this tank and how many of them I have counseledled with and they also how many have stood in this tank and said uh asked when did God deal with you? They said in two years ago or three years ago at camp the speaker was so and so and they were speaking on a certain subject or it was a certain evening and God spoke to me that night and that is when God dealt with me and then they end up in the baptismal tank and many of you are sitting here this morning. That's what it's all about. You see we talk about families. There's a lot of singles here. There's couples without children here. Don't forget you. It's you don't you're not without a family. &gt;&gt; You singles are not without a family. You that don't have children, you're not without a family. You empty nesters, you're not without a family. You widows that are here, you're not without a family. Your family right here. Your children are right here. And that I'm not that's not poetic license. You need to have a burden for the young people and for the children that are right here. and the energy you spend at this kind of facility, God will honor it. &gt;&gt; I was moved this morning as I thought about this. Brother Randy, he has a a phrase and I'm looking at some of his daughters right now and he says the reason why they're here, it's not been easy. It's been a difficult adjustment and coming from a secure job and and the the uprooting from Phoenix and the area and the nice weather and the sunshine to come and it's been a horrific uh change for them and it's not been easy. But Ry's phrase is it's a family. We feel as a family. my my children feel that bond of a family. And he said, "I'm doing this because it's a family." And you wouldn't believe the amount amount of days and time that he spent on this because to him, it's the family of God. And I know that he's got his family. And brother Chris, you and Sister Cigarette, I'd like to say something. They don't have children, but I haven't found anybody more devoted and more dedicated for the families and for the children and for the people of this congregation. You've been so giving of yourself and generous to see that these things happen. And I say, God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you immensely. And I think you know that comes from my heart. It will be a place where many people will be blessed. Many people will be able to get away from the pressures of life and just spend some time. Brother Joseph and brother James Lei, brother Joseph took the responsibility of seeing that everything was happening. And uh this next Saturday, this is this is the kind of the final push. Friday, Saturday is the last two days. We expect to have the bathrooms completely finished, perhaps drywalled inside and everything. So I would So I'll just say this and it's not only that then we're just restoring the they're going to seed and restore the whole grounds and it's in it's just going to be uh really really lovely and once it's done there's no possibility of going back and doing it again. I know when this church was finished and uh brothers who worked day after day after day for three months when it was all done, I had so many come to me said, "We're sorry. It's over. We just got to a place we so enjoyed being with one another." So, you don't have to be a carpenter. You don't have to be skilled. And you don't have to be called on. You can phone Brother Jack or Brother Chris and say, "I'm available. Is there anything to do? I you know I can handle a shovel or a rake or whatever more and if there's anything to do you could just do that because we don't want to you know be necessarily making these announcements but uh next next uh Friday and Saturday is the final push. So as many as can come especially those that were there the last time and framers and skilled carpenters etc. drywallers we would appreciate it. God bless you. I just had that on my heart. Thank you. Now, if you wish to stand and we'll read. Sorry to be so long, but I enjoyed those songs. Didn't you? &gt;&gt; Both the groups that sang and the Russian group and the other brothers and sisters that sang that first song. It's really wonderful. Turn with me, would you, to Matthew 24, the uh the we'll read verses 1 to3. And I'd like if you would just ask God to do something special for you right now in this service. Just say, I'm I'm asking, Father, for the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Come to me personally. That's what I'm going to pray that God will just take charge of the entire rest of the service and the word and the preaching of it. Oh God. Oh God. We're going to read in just a few moments. Lord, we're going to read, but we need you. We need you, oh God. We want you to be the one that speaks. We want your thoughts to be made known. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you will take supreme control for your glory and your honor. Amen. Amen. Matthew 24:es 1 2 and 3. And Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things. Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. And as he sat upon the mount of olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world? God bless you. You may have your seats, and I would ask you to keep your Bibles open, please, to that 24th chapter. I'll be referring to quite a few other verses. Now Jesus actually gives an overview and you'll just need your full focus on the service and as little movement as possible because this may feel like a little bit laborious but I I need to uh uh I I want to give you quite a few quotes and they do tie beautifully together. But Jesus gives an overview in chapter 24. And the overview has to do with the Gentiles and the gospel going to the Gentiles. It has to do with the tribulation and what takes place in Jerusalem and its destruction. And it also gives the gospel going to the Jews. So the destruction uh of the temple, the uh tribulation period and the gospel going to the Gentiles and his coming. Those are the things that is a is a he he gives an overview and brother Brandham uh says about the three questions and the three questions are tell us when these things shall be. What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world? Those are the three questions brother Brandham says about those three questions in the flashing red light. They ask three questions and he answers back three questions. When will there come a time when there won't be left one stone upon another? What's the sign of your coming? And what about the end of the world? He says, "And many I believe and that we brethren make mistakes by trying to apply it all to his coming." But he's answering three different questions that was asked him. And he starts off asking one answering one about when the stones won't be left uh not one upon another. And then after he finishes that question, then he starts off the sign of his coming and then goes into the end of the world. Now uh as soon as brother Brandham finishes that part then he takes for a text and I should tell you that I was uh directed by the Holy Spirit to to go to Matthew 24 and so I was uh uh I hadn't even really got into it yet. And also I felt as though I should be uh directing my thoughts to a certain message. So I thought of uh another message uh other than uh the flashing red light. I thought of warning than judgment because my thoughts were so much on judgment and I wanted to bring it but I I I felt directed that I should be bringing it in a certain way but I couldn't quite get that direction. And so then uh uh I was directed to flashing red light of his coming. And so I just put it on. I began to listen to that and immediately brother Brandham goes now to Matthew 24. Well, when you have that kind of thing happening, you know, and especially it's not just a thought that zaps into your mind with a minister, you're waiting and you're you're almost uh uh straining as it were in the traces. You're just what is it? You've got the radar out, you know, and I I feel led in this way. And then this thought here, you know, on on the judgment and and uh I want to bring it to the people and I see things happening that are taking place that God has spoken of. I'd like to bring that to the people because we don't want to be caught unawares. &gt;&gt; We we want to be informed ahead of time. &gt;&gt; And so and then you feel, okay, no, I I should listen to this or I should start reading this message. And I put it on. I was just listening to it. And then here he comes right away to Matthew 24 and he reads a text which actually starts in the 32nd verse of uh of chapter 24. And I'm going to read those as well. But he he he just finishes this text and then he goes right back to uh verses 1 2 and three about the three questions. So in verse 32, the scripture says, "Now learn a parable of a fig tree." Now let me just stop there and have you look this way one more moment. Now up to this time, remember Jesus is answering these questions. Uh what is uh when will these things be? When are these stones going to be torn down? So it won't be one upon another. And now try to put yourself back. Try to put yourself back into this time zone. Try to make yourself for a few moments this morning uh a believer. You're a believer. Not here in Cloverdale in this Cloverdale Bible Church, but you're back there and you're in Jerusalem and you you are impressed with the building and the stones and the many years that they were building and the skilled worksmen that put those stones together. and you're sufficiently impressed. You actually want the Lord Jesus who you know who he is. You want to show him the stones of the temple. Now, I'm sure he had seen the stones of the temple, but you're you're impressed with the disciples were impressed with it. It was a magnificent place. And so, they want him to see these stones. I'm sure it would come to you as a shock to have him say back to you, don't be impressed with this. Don't look at this because I tell you there there's coming a time there won't even be one stone left here upon another. &gt;&gt; It would be uh it would be a shock to you. It would be startling to you to look at this. You you're already looking at it. you you're there for the purpose of showing him and speaking about this magnificent structure and he's telling you don't look at this because there these stones there won't even be one left on another that must have seemed like such an impossibility to them and and now part of it is going to be because of judgment now remember God allowed judgment to come to Israel to come to Palestine and to the Jews in particular because that temple meant something very special to them and they the Rome that had control of Israel. Rome was kind of a uh uh they had a system by which all they wanted was control of lands and their kingdom was very extensive and they really didn't care how the people worshiped within that system. The system was to control this vast area. And so that is why they had their rulers and but then underneath that they had like the religious community, the Pharisees and and the Sadducees and they they were allowed to function and operate. They weren't restricted. But Rome just wanted to have control. Now, if you can keep your thoughts going and I pray that God will help me this morning because the pope that was just now in America, he had he had and I have here the record of he had uh the religious leaders of the world uh including Muslims, including Judaism and including the James from India. He had those there. there was no Christian representative because he was considered as the Christian representative of the Christian world and and they just had that meeting just taking place. You see, they really don't care if the James worship one way and the Muslims worship another way and the Jews want to worship another way. But they're seeking for control that's beyond &gt;&gt; and above exactly, you know, how you go and worship, whatever you want to do, fine. But they want control. That's all. That's the spirit that's been there since day one. And if this one is antichrist and this one's antichrist and the Muslim anti-word and the James anti-word and this one's anti-word and there all it is is a conglomeration of antichrist. &gt;&gt; They don't care if this one's this one's off the word and that one's off the word and that one's they're all off the word. But one who's off the word wants control. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're not trying to bring everybody in line. They're not trying to make everybody Catholics. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that &gt;&gt; they're not trying to make everybody Catholics. I think this service today should be a real enlightenment for many of you. &gt;&gt; So Jesus describing these conditions and now brother Brandham takes Matthew 24 and aligns it with the opening of the seals. You know that &gt;&gt; he aligns it with the opening of the seals. Then he says, "Now Jesus didn't say anything about the seventh seal." He comes down and ends it in verse uh 31. Sorry. Yes. Verse 31, he says, "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the one end of heaven to the other." And it is one place at least, Brother Brham ties that to the gathering of the Jews back to Israel. He does it in fact in flashing red light of his coming. So he ties it and then because that is something that is actually part of the opening of the seals and then he says now in verse 32 he starts off in parables because it's a parable of his coming and the seventh seal is his coming. &gt;&gt; So he's starting off he says Jesus doesn't say anything about the seventh seal. All those seals are from the from the verse one through uh not actually verse one but like from about about verse 4 all to verse 31. And then he says then he starts off on parables. And the parable is now learn a parable. We're reading verse 32 of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves. You know that summer is nigh. So likewise ye, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. You notice now I've been speaking also on the power of the word, the transforming power of the word. and uh about two services ago spoke of and took one line and I'll just bring it back to you now because this is anchored right back into it. And the the the the word is the agent for judgment. &gt;&gt; Because once it's spoken, whether you see it or not, maybe some of those disciples didn't all live to see the destruction of Jerusalem. But the nevertheless once Jesus spoke it, it was finished. &gt;&gt; The destruction was as sure as there. When uh when God speaks, thus sayith the Lord, Los Angeles is going to sink. You don't have to wait for an earthquake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The earthquake already took place when he spoke it. &gt;&gt; It's as good as done. &gt;&gt; If you wait for something physical to happen, say, "Oh, now let's look in the word." You're too late. &gt;&gt; It's far too late. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Then you'll know that summer is nigh. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away, but of that day, of that day and hour, knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven, but my father only." Now, just for this congregation, for those of you that understand the message, listen very closely. Many times, many times, brother Brandham refers to the coming of Christ and he does not use the word coming. He does not actually uh make direct reference to it, but he uses this scripture as a reference to it. He uses this one for no man knoweth the day or the hour. That's what he uses. And he expects a believer to catch that what he's referring to is the coming. No man knows the day of the hour. He'll say another place, no man knows, not even the angels know. No man knows, not even the son himself knows. And he'll make reference to it in different ways, but he doesn't refer to the he doesn't speak the words. Uh this is the coming of Christ or the second coming of Christ, but he's making direct reference to the coming because it is in parable form. And that's how he used it. You'll find it in the seals. You'll find it in the seventh seal. And so for those of you that are uh students of the message, you read and you listen to it, re remember my words. Now when you see that he's talking about the coming. So watch the context that he's speaking of it in when you come to that phrase. And then he ends this with this. This is the ending of his text. But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the son of man be. as the days of Noah. Then he goes into the conditions of of uh Noah's time which we will touch some on that now. So Jesus is describing the conditions. What Jesus is doing is describing the conditions that will exist in the times in the era of these three questions. When will these things be? So he tells them what the abomination of Daniel spoken of the abomination as spoken by Daniel the prophet and what's going to happen and he that's on the rooftop don't even come down and that's going to be it's going to be a destruction like has never been and he's speaking then about that. So he tells them the conditions that are going to exist at that time. how he also speaks to the conditions that are going to exist in our time and we're seeing those conditions but we don't need to see every detail when we read it. Let him who readth understand &gt;&gt; that this is the time and let's live as we as though we understand it. Let's not be consumed by consu with consumerism. Let's not be consumed with popularity or fashion. Let's not be consumed with the things of this life because they are passing away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks about the tribulation. He speaks about God's dealing with the Jews. And then also brother Brandham makes a reference to that in the seventh seal. He said he speaks now uh 1,000 years on earth is only one day with God and 3 and 1/2 years talking about the 3 and 1/2 years of tribulation. He said what would it go to so many seconds in God's time? He said that's the reason he said now watch those words. I'm I'm very very I'm very personnicity about the words even one word sometimes he said and that's the reason he said it's at it is at the door. &gt;&gt; That's the reason he said that's it's at the door because it's such a brief period of time. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you that this generation shall not be consumed or done away with this people." In brackets, "Until all these things are," and he stops. He said, "What what won't be done away with? They've tried to kill the Jew off the earth all the time. They'll never be able to do it." See that? That won't that generation won't pass away. It won't they won't be able to destroy it. And he and he said the generation what generation that generation shall not be consumed or done away with until all these things are what? What won't be done away with? They've tried to kill the Jew. They won't be able to do away with them. Hey, they're they're completely surrounded &gt;&gt; with multiplied millions of people intent on their total destruction. Right. &gt;&gt; And the world is calling for them to make peace with them. In fact, is America and the United uh nations and the United European nations. This is not a political sermon. Now we we're but this is just a good background. They are all putting forward. It is the it has to be the epitome of hypocrisy. They're all putting forward pressure on that little nation to give up land, to pay the bills of their enemies to do all kinds of things. And not one of those nations would do that. &gt;&gt; Not one of those nations would take their an enemy who says, "We're out to destroy you." There isn't one of those nations would put up with that. &gt;&gt; But they're pressuring Israel. This thing, that's why I can say this is not a physical war. It's a spiritual war. It's it's not even based on it's not even based on human common sense. You can't even feature a man who who's who's mature or a woman who's mature mentally that would say this is your enemy. Feed them. Make a way for them. Pay their bills. Do this. It has nothing to do with accepting them as a people. Say accept these as a people. They don't want to be accepted. They want control. What man is going to allow a a a neighbor to take that position of and even displace a father in a family or or or or a country, a nation, nobody's prepared to do that. And so he says, so notice the very generation of Jews that seen the return back to Palestine, that generation would see these things happen. So he says that generation that returns to Palestine, they will see these things happen. And just the last two and a half years, this is in the seventh seal, something you probably want to mark down. Remember, in just the last two and a half years, she was fully become a nation with her own money and whatever. And there she is in the feast of the trumpets. He said, "Now Pentecost finishes at the period of the seventh seal." In the seventh seal, he says also that this seal is the end of all things. It goes right on to the even the very very end of time. So the seventh seal, it isn't as though you have a a cut off date for it. But the Pentecost feast finishes at the period of the seventh seal. For the next is the coming of Christ. And also the trumpet is sound for the Jews. I got this on a slide. Later on I'll show you. Also the trumpet is sound for the Jews. Their sixth trumpet is sound. And when it does, it makes known to them the revealed son of God. 1 half hour is fixed. And remember, all trumpets sound on the sixth seal. The sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh opened. &gt;&gt; The seventh is the coming &gt;&gt; of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and now I I'm referring to some of the some of the scriptures so you can just listen it but I'll give them as I go through because they're not in total continuity but it's in continuity of thought on from in Matthew 24 6th verse. And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places. Didn't say specifically when. And I know that we look for an increase of earthquakes. Jesus didn't really say there'd be an increase of earthquakes as such, but there will be earthquakes in diverse places. One of the articles that uh I gathered said that uh they didn't really have record that they had that uh earthquakes of seven magnitude and greater were actually increasing. But they said that what they have they have sensors now set up. They used to only have a few hundred and I believe they got about 8,000 sensors now around the world where they're able to record and find out the amount of uh of earthquake and earthquake activity is taking place. And so consequently, he said we have many more recorded because we have more systems whereby we can uh report what is taking place. But now the other thing is it's not just what takes place but it's where it takes place. &gt;&gt; You see I don't think that Katrina was an accident. &gt;&gt; Neither was it just a hurricane. &gt;&gt; But it happens to be probably one of the vilest of cities &gt;&gt; in America. one of the most perverted of cities. &gt;&gt; They go with their mira &gt;&gt; which is hell on earth. &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to say amen. &gt;&gt; God sees that. &gt;&gt; God looks upon that. God doesn't hate people. He hates the sin, &gt;&gt; the system. God doesn't hate denominational denominational people. &gt;&gt; He does hate the system &gt;&gt; because it's anti-word. &gt;&gt; It's antirist. &gt;&gt; And that's very important that we are able to establish that. And we speak about people with their twisted and perverted and and and they give themselves to it. As they give themselves to it in unbelief, they will certainly perish with it. They will perish with the sin &gt;&gt; and the sinful if they give themselves to it. Anybody will, anyone here, anyone under the sound of my voice. If you give yourself to the world, give yourself to sin, you'll be destroyed with the world. That's all there is. There is no other solution. And so now we find not just a hurricane, not just a incredible disaster, but in a specific place &gt;&gt; that is a uh it it is just a fostering and festering cesspool of sin. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if God doesn't just judge America, he'll have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize. But we get we we get it every day. We see it every day. It's on the street. It's in the restaurant. It's in the airplane. It's everywhere. And and Satan's Satan's idea is to get you cooled off to accept it. And it's in the fashion industry. It's in the clothes that you men buy. It's in the clothes you women buy. There's the most perverted and the most twisted of of minds that design those things. run away from it. &gt;&gt; Go the other direction. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be changed. We don't have to what you see on Vanity Fair or see in some magazine. Go the other direction. You see some Hollywood star dressed that way. Dressed opposite. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. There skin tight clothes showing every every part of a man's body or a woman's body. And it's a woman's body that Satan used in the first place. I say you women want to keep your bodies sacred and keep them covered and keep it holy. And if you go the way of the world, there's no there's no other uh uh there's no other solution. There's no other conclusion we can come to than this one conclusion that you're you're speaking you're speaking by your action another gospel that's not the gospel of Jesus Christ because actions speak louder than words. And in our actions, we're preaching a gospel. And we must not preach the gospel of Hollywood. We must not preach the gospel of the fashion industry. We must not preach the gospel of the sports world. We must not preach the gospel. If these young men are going along with their spiked hair and all the rest of it, go the other direction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm oldfashioned." You'll find on the other side. It's the oldfashioned way. That's the gospel way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what what becomes popular in the world. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in their popularity. We're not interested in the direction they're going. We're not interested in their music. We're not interested in what they what they're entertained with. We're not interested in their in their videos and their movies and all. We're not interested in it. We got another city. We got another land. We got a place of holiness. Hallelujah. And we're planning on going there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it says pestilences. They can say all they want about the AIDS and all the most popular people and great movie stars and everything else all getting behind the, you know, trying to recover from AIDS. They know where it started. Right. &gt;&gt; They know it's a perverted life that brought it. &gt;&gt; And it's wiping out entire generations. &gt;&gt; They said in in countries of Africa, it's going to wipe out an entire generation of men and women. &gt;&gt; A whole gap of a generation is gone. Gone. &gt;&gt; Yes. And to think that this perverted community wants to lay out the responsibility upon you upon every uh even uh Christian people of the Christian community to support the result of their sin and the consequence. And so they say a lot of innocent people are caught in it. Innocent babies are caught in it. Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; But God's going to hold them responsible for everyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the beds that are occupied by people who have AIDS who say, "Well, should they not have a a hospital bed, not over and above your sick child &gt;&gt; or this godly man or woman?" &gt;&gt; Not over and above them to lay in a bed for three months and and and you can't find a bed. &gt;&gt; I went last night to visit visit my aunt And then and they have these hospital rooms now, which I think is such a disgrace and an embarrassment for these countries that are as wealthy as America, Canada, and the Western world. And they they now they make these rooms unisex. There's my aunt, and behind the curtains a a man, and across the aisle is a Chinese woman. And when I went there f uh Friday, there was the three of them. And that's only three beds in the room. And I go there yesterday. And just as I go in, there's a a little frame with a curtain cloth on it and it it goes out about 2 feet and then on a angle for about 68 ft that way. And the bathroom door is right behind it. as I as I go in then great big strong young man probably all of 240 250 lb young man just a picture of strength 25 years old in there for heart surgery and my aunt says he he just came in and that was his room behind those two cloths to find space for him no beds you I'm not laying the blame to anybody, but the system isn't working. &gt;&gt; We're smart, intelligent, got universities, we're further down the road, got more money, billions of dollars in oil, and can't find a bed for a young man that's sick. &gt;&gt; Something's wrong with the system, folks. &gt;&gt; I'm not here for politics. I'm here to tell you that the politics has failed. &gt;&gt; Democracy has failed. &gt;&gt; There's only one hope. &gt;&gt; That's for Christ himself &gt;&gt; to establish his kingdom once again. And he's already establishing it in the hearts of men and women. &gt;&gt; That thing that's in you is the kingdom that's coming into place. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "There'll be pestilences, and pestilences are plagues." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Here's the overview of the global AIDS epidemi epidemic. It's very brief. This is the overview. You can go on a United Nations or go on all these other research official places. I won't bore you with it. An estimated 38.6 million people worldwide were living with AIDS in 205. An estimated 4.1 million became newly infected with HIV and estimated 2.8 million lost their lives. It's almost three million people lost their lives in one year, 12 months. and greater population than this entire nation of Canada is infected with AIDS. There's places in Africa where it has reached 50%. Are there innocents? Yes, of course there are. And this is something that we may not understand. And I'm just praying that God will give me leadership here. Brother Brandham spoke about compassion. He said you don't know what compassion is. People don't know what compassion is. He said compassion is when Jesus went to the pool of Bethesda Beth Bethesda &gt;&gt; and he goes to the pool and the Bible says there's a great multitude of people that are laying there waiting for the stirring of the waters. And brother Brandham goes into description because he's one who's chosen. He's the one who's chosen to reveal the son of man. and he sees them come by. We don't have children. I have seen children with the water heads and massive heads. We don't have it much today. It's very unusual. But he uses that term several times. So you young people don't know. You can see a little child about this size, maybe three, four years old with a massive head like that. Grotesque. And that is a water head. Brother Brandham said, "Jesus walks at the pool and he steps by the mother holding that little child and crying out, "Oh, someone help me and a blind man and he steps over him. Somebody help me. Help me. Can somebody lead me?" and he steps over him. And he steps by the sick and the afflicted and comes to a man who's had an infirmity. He's not even sick, &gt;&gt; but he's had an infirmity and he can't make it to the pool. He's been there 38 years. &gt;&gt; And Jesus heals him, &gt;&gt; bypassing all others. And brother Brandham said, "That's compassion." He said, "Compassion is doing the word of God." And that's what the father showed him. That's compassion. That goes beyond your understanding. We're not here to move within the realm of your understanding or my understanding or what I think compassion is or what I think love is or what I think judgment is. &gt;&gt; Jesus said the words of Jesus. He said many many widows We're in Samaria. &gt;&gt; Many widows. Not only widows, but besides widows were many children and many babies &gt;&gt; and many mothers and many fathers and many a young man and many a young woman maybe working their fingers to the bone just trying to find enough to eat. He said many widows were in the land in the time of Elias but only one. Was he sent to? &gt;&gt; Hey, just a second. I'm putting this congregation, all who are listening on the internet on notice today that famine, listen to me, that famine came as a result of one man's words, &gt;&gt; and that man was Elijah himself. &gt;&gt; And he said, "There will not even be due on the ground until I call for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was an Ahab. &gt;&gt; Because of the system, &gt;&gt; because of the system that was ignoring God, turning from God. &gt;&gt; I come to America, and brother, I'm going to give you quotes in a few minutes, but I'm on a bit of a roll here. I come to how the prophet Elijah once again crying out &gt;&gt; in his country to the leaders and to all who will hear. &gt;&gt; This country was established at Plymouth Rock by brethren by brethren who were fleeing persecution of Rome. They were fleeing that persecution. Came here for freedom and they fought and they struggled and they trusted in God and how they had their meetings and served God with sincerity of heart. We're here and were free and they gave thanksgiving. So they have a thanksgiving time in this country and in America. They thank God for their freedom because they had fled the Roman persecution. &gt;&gt; And they finally had a president, President uh Abraham Lincoln. And he did not speak kindly about the Jesuits and the cruelty and the murder that took place and the people that died under that system. And now just a few years later, couple hundred years later, God raises up a prophet and and goes back to their beginnings &gt;&gt; and then tells them, "You're in the book. You're in Revelation in the 12th chapter, and you're going to join up with this beast power. You're going to change your system. You're going to become uh uh acceptable with it, and you're going to accept it. And now it comes and in your time in your day &gt;&gt; it's received just for the second time &gt;&gt; and when the prophet was speaking it the first Catholic president was in power &gt;&gt; when the prophet was here you think that and and he identifies it as an Ahab and a Jezebel &gt;&gt; you think that was just some words he wanted to put in you think it was an accident that he was here at the same time that president was there that's absolutely the or a order of God &gt;&gt; and warning the people and warning the churches and warning the businessmen and warning whoever would listen that it's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; I tell you the darkness, all the darkness is still in that system. All the cruelty is still in that system. All the blood is still under her skirts. &gt;&gt; And that was the first one. And he went also, not speaking against him now, I'm just saying he he's probably a good man, but the system he was under and went to alleviate the concerns of the Southern Baptist people and spoke of their conference so that that he would walk the fine line between state and church. &gt;&gt; That he didn't really believe in state and church, which was fine. But what happened friends is that he opened the door &gt;&gt; and they said they said that the pope which was able to visit in the garden in the back garden which it would have been they said that he's he's been received to the front door when it would have been absolutely unthinkable to even have him at the back door &gt;&gt; and he opened the door and this is now the second pope that came and visited America and have a president look in his eyes and say, "What did you see?" When you look in his eyes, he said, "I saw a god." &gt;&gt; I can tell you he had a hallucination. [Music] I had the actually had this the schedule of events and I was going to read for you and it's one of things I slipped up bringing and calling all the various religions and they were there and they came. So, how does this relate even by me bringing these things out to you? They're happening even when you aren't aware of it. They're happening while you're sleeping &gt;&gt; and this thing is slipping by and the days are going by &gt;&gt; and events are taking place. And that is why God knew well you wouldn't know about all events. You wouldn't see all the events. You don't have the capacity to retain all the events. You are you're not even made privy to it. You're not even made aware of it. It's not even announced. A lot of these things aren't announced, but it's happening. That's why the scripture says, "He that readth, &gt;&gt; let him understand." &gt;&gt; When you read it, &gt;&gt; ask today, "God, help me to understand what I need to read. &gt;&gt; And what I'm reading, help me understand it." Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines which there are and pestilences which there are and pestilence pestilence is an epidemic uh a highly contagious or infectious disease and I put AIDS right in that category amongst perhaps a lot of others but there's been nothing that has come come to the surface such as this one. And it has come through sex, &gt;&gt; perverted sex. Let's face it, folks. That's where it had its beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had people that have official position hand me a package. And this was not for distribution to the public. Actually, nailed it right down because even those that are distributing don't want to be identified as being anti-gay or anti- something. We're not that. We're anti- sin. We're anti-perversion. We're anti- the system. And if a person wants to give themselves to it, that's up to them. So be it. And they pay a penalty for it. &gt;&gt; Say, are you going to bring a penalty? Not at all. &gt;&gt; They bring it upon themselves. &gt;&gt; Where did this thing come from? &gt;&gt; I guarantee you. I believe with all my heart there's not there's it's not in God's mind that one of his children should die from that disease. Amen. &gt;&gt; You live clean. You live holy. You live separated from the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there will be diseases. Brother Brandham said there'll be diseases that they won't be able to find a solution to. And as these various viruses mutate and become anti- uh uh they become almost resistant to any kind of antibiotics. &gt;&gt; He says there there'll be diseases that's coming that cancer just be like a toothache. &gt;&gt; You ought to sit in my place, friends. You ought to talk to the people I talk to. I'm not saying everything, but I know a whole lot more than what I'm saying. You just want to believe it. Who so readeth, &gt;&gt; let them understand. &gt;&gt; Read it in the book. &gt;&gt; There will be famines. &gt;&gt; There will be pestilences. &gt;&gt; And there will be earthquakes and it'll be in diverse places. &gt;&gt; I hope you're not weary. And it says, "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Make sure that your love doesn't wax cold. And iniquity is a transgression of the law. Either because of ignorant be as of ignorant of it or because of violating of it. There's people that just violate it. They know it's wrong. Iniquity is contempt and violation of law. Iniquity, wickedness. Then Jesus comes and says, "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." You cannot read these verses without coming to the conclusion that these conditions that Jesus Christ has described and which exist amongst us today. He is saying very clearly those conditions have a tendency to wear a person down. He's talking to his own disciples. He said, "But he that shall endure to the end because these things are not easy necessarily to endure." You read about these things. You see the pictures. You see the suffering that is taking place in China and in Myanmar right now, formerly Burma. And and I've got some slides. We've got people. There's a group of believers right in the midst. And I have a great testimony this morning. I'm going to show you some pictures of of right where it happened in China. Uh but you have all of these things they have a tendency to to wear a person down because it is as though we become like shock proof. It it is though we become almost calloused. We read it in the newspaper. You hear it on the radio in your car. You hear it in the conversation and it it is it's something that has a tendency to wear on a person and make them weakened as it were. But then let him who readeth understand These things must be. &gt;&gt; They must be. &gt;&gt; It's going to touch a lot of innocent lives. Going to touch a lot of children. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just say something. Even amongst the believers, I find too many of us and we're all subject to it to being to being influenced and actually directed by our emotions. &gt;&gt; We need to understand what compassion is and we need to understand what God's word says and what he says must happen. And there's going to be innocent people. &gt;&gt; There's going to be good people affected as there was many widows. &gt;&gt; In the time of Elijah, &gt;&gt; what kind of God do you think it is that has Elijah walk past maybe many widows? As the Bible says, many widows. You know, I'm speaking seriously because it's imperative that you know God and you know the nature of God and you're not not being dictated to by a whole realm of of of what this world says is understanding and what this world says is compassion and what this world knows about love is zero &gt;&gt; just below zero. &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about love. Amen. &gt;&gt; How is it that they love and come to a a wedding and are married and and in a few months the love's gone? Where the love? It wasn't love in the first place. &gt;&gt; And these spirits are here. And it's not that they don't stop at the doors there. They're here to plague the believer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How far shall I go? How plain shall they get? &gt;&gt; This spirit of perversion that's in the world, it's rampant &gt;&gt; on men and women. &gt;&gt; And I say to any young woman here, any young man here, if you feel and begin to sense you're getting afflicted with a twisted, perverted spirit, you come to my office right away. Hallelujah. I got an injection for you. &gt;&gt; I got a remedy for you. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you it's worked. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've used this hypodermic needle before called the word of God. And we've injected young men and preserved them from a twisted life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've seen it. &gt;&gt; I've experienced it. &gt;&gt; I've seen him transformed and released from that horrible spirit. &gt;&gt; And it is a horrible spirit. It twists them down into the most captive, unclean lives and won't let them go. &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape from Dawson Creek. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. Brother Brenam singing. Brother Bren is there. and is there because he first loved me everyone so sweetly. You will not commit suicide, soldier boy. &gt;&gt; That's the devil talking to you. Deny him. Deny him and you'll go home and be a real gentleman. Be a real man. I met that boy the next day gripped with a spirit of homosexuality and had tried already to commit suicide three times. It wasn't the gospel that tried to have him commit suicide. It was a spirit driving him. A young fine soldier of the US Army trying to commit suicide because of being haunted and driven with the spirit. Listen to me, men, women, don't put up with it. That's from the kingdom of darkness. Send it back where it belongs in the name of Jesus Christ. Send it back. And if you even feel the first inkling of it, go to your parents. Go to your pastor. Go to a minister and tell him to pray with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something else. You can't h You can't hanky panky with it. You can't be soft with it. You have to hate it. You hate that thing because it comes to it come to do mortal conflict with you. It come to destroy you. &gt;&gt; It come to enslave you. &gt;&gt; What does this all boil down to in brother brother Brandham's terms, those you know the message, it's women who don't want to carry seed. &gt;&gt; That happens to be what lesbianism is. Yes, &gt;&gt; we'll satisfy this lustful nature woman by woman. &gt;&gt; You didn't expect that perhaps here. The country is absolutely infested with it. &gt;&gt; Agree with me? &gt;&gt; This isn't off the wall. That's &gt;&gt; right. And man, entire gay parades and cities getting behind it and mayors getting behind it and and and and kings and all kinds of people getting behind it. What is it? It's men who don't want to give a woman seed. &gt;&gt; To me, it's the ultimate insult &gt;&gt; to God, the giver of life. &gt;&gt; To put the seed where they put the seed. &gt;&gt; Terrible thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Terrible insult to God. &gt;&gt; No wonder God said, "I'm going to destroy it. &gt;&gt; You took my life. &gt;&gt; You took my seed that I give you as a gift and put it and showed me that it threw it in my face." &gt;&gt; And then things like this go on. Do you know that Thailand and where the Indonesian terrible tsunami took place? Do you know that people fly from this country? They fly from Europe. They fly from North America to go to that part of the world for things that they're disallowed in this country. Abuse of children. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; One of the one of the greatest spots of the world where people go for that kind of every kind of possible evil, twisted, perverted, and they bring children into that kind of slavery. Can you imagine? You have a child, if you've ever had a child, and think they'd be subjected to that kind of thing. And then they have a great giant earthquake under the earth and uh uh 330ome thousand of them destroyed innocent people destroyed. I can tell you according to God's word it's judgment. &gt;&gt; And it's not only judgment it happens in a certain place. &gt;&gt; I don't find Katrina happening in in New Orleans as an accident. &gt;&gt; I don't find a tsunami happening in Indonesia as an accident. It wasn't only happening in the earth. It happened in a certain spot. &gt;&gt; Remember that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The earthquake in Eliah's day or the famine in Eli in Elijah's time happened in Samaria where he was. &gt;&gt; That's where it was. &gt;&gt; And when and when Los Angeles sinks, they're going to sink for a purpose. &gt;&gt; For a purpose. And he spoke it. He said, "Because you spewed out &gt;&gt; your evil all over the earth. &gt;&gt; You've exported it. We used to import it from Paris. Now Paris gets it from us." &gt;&gt; And they're the biggest supporters, some of the biggest supporters of let let's all get together loveydovey and fix the AIDS program. Go fix it yourself. &gt;&gt; Let those who brought it on pay for it. I know I'm going to get a bad name for this. &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to be considered a some kind of a whackle for this. &gt;&gt; Don't you have compassion? Absolutely. Have compassion according to God's word. You want to have compassion, then turn from your sin. Say to all who ever hear this, turn from your sin and God will receive you. &gt;&gt; Turn from the evil and you'll have repentance and forgiveness of sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't ever fool with God. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to give you a couple. I was at a big meeting down in Tennessee and a man came before me. happened to be a good friend of mine just came before me and I said, "You're troubled with a homosexual spirit, aren't you, just struck the nail on the head till he couldn't hardly speak." He said, "Yes." And I said, "And that's why you're here." I was in another city, Edmonton. In fact, great big gathering taking place. It wasn't a meeting. It was just a big gathering and they were eating and festivities were taking place and people going by, a few hundred people there and and somebody just uh young young people walking back and forth and a young man walked by me and God just spoke to me and says he's a homosexual. just a dark cloud, dark presence. I didn't say anything. I waited some time later, maybe one or two years later, I was in a meeting and he was sitting in the pew and it happened to be down here. He was attending a service and just about everybody had gone out and he remained sitting there and I came I had left the service I came back I saw him sitting there I came down I sat beside him I said I want to tell you something that happened to me up in Edmonton there was some festivity taking place it was like a banquet was taking place and people and all walking by and talking and laughing. I said, "You walked by and God spoke to me and said, you're homosexual." He plunged his head down between his legs. He says, "I hate it. I hate it. I hate it." What do you think that does to a minister's heart? What do you think it does to his heart? I loved him and I hate that spirit, &gt;&gt; that demon spirit &gt;&gt; that wants to put its roots down. Hang on to him and say you're mine. I'm going to dictate to you. I'm going to tell you who your friends are. I'm going to tell you who your associates are. I'm going to deprive you of a decent marriage. I'm going to deprive you of the things of life. You're going to serve me. What do you think goes to my heart? Cast him out &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and give him a direction for his life and say those things that even you start feeling a urge to have, you know, maybe some strong perfume and you want to look at a certain magazine of deny him. &gt;&gt; Do what the prophet said, deny him. Deny him. Deny him. Go the other way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, my friends, this may seem sound harsh, but this is a delivering message. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people want to complain upon society and where we're at, but you got to do something in the first place. Do something yourself. &gt;&gt; At your own place, within your own realm of influence. &gt;&gt; God's true. &gt;&gt; I feel like singing God's true. &gt;&gt; The devil's a liar. Listen friends, if you love the world or the things of the world, &gt;&gt; the love of the father's not in you. &gt;&gt; That's just that simple. &gt;&gt; The love of the father is not in you if we love the world. And we want to, you know, just kind of pamper. We don't want to pamper those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought of the quality of endurance and they that endures. Jesus said these things because they that endure to the end. He was simply stating there will be those that will deserve that will preserve be preserved and endure to the end. &gt;&gt; There are those. He said listen anointed ones look at the last days. It'll be so close it'll deceive the very elected if possible. The reason why the elected can't be deceived. You know why? The reason why the elected can't be deceived. Do you want to know why? It's because they are the word. &gt;&gt; They are the word and they can't be deceived. Christ could not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. The first Adam was not deceived. The second Adam was not deceived. Eve was deceived. The church has been deceived. But in the end time, this second Adam takes a wife to himself and she becomes him. &gt;&gt; She becomes what he is. She becomes bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, spirit of his spirit and word of his word. And because she's word, she can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's why we preach what we're preaching. The bride of Jesus Christ can't be deceived. I'm talking about the real bride. The church is deceived. &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say it's because they are the word. And just like the life that's in the root, it can't deny itself. It is the word and the season of the word. &gt;&gt; The reason he said the elect, the reason the elected, Jesus said, won't be deceived because they are the word. He repeats it again. They can't be nothing else. &gt;&gt; They are the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They can't be anything else. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; They can't hear nothing else. &gt;&gt; They don't know nothing else. &gt;&gt; I like all of those. &gt;&gt; They can't be deceived. Why can't you be deceived? Because you're the word. &gt;&gt; You must say, "I am the word." &gt;&gt; And when any of those feelings come or anything, Satan, he doesn't care who he tempts or who he becomes. You need to say as soon as that you feel that haunting spirit, I am the word. Put him on notice. You can't deceive me. I've already identified you. You dark evil spirit. Depart from me. &gt;&gt; And he'll come in such a nice way, such an intense, such a interesting way as he did to Eve, but you deny him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Okay, just give me a little bit of time and I'm going to close. I don't want to wear you out, but there's only one service today. &gt;&gt; And nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, there'll be famines, pestilences, and these are the beginning of sorrows. And then, because of iniquity, it shall abound. The love of many shall wax cold, and then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another, and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many. People say William Brandham, they try to identify it. Many don't say he's a false prophet, but they want to say that we're false, which is saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; I'm prepared to wait out and see who's false. &gt;&gt; Faith can afford to wait. &gt;&gt; I'm prepared to wait. Are you prepared to wait? Amen. &gt;&gt; I go back 35 years right here in this same town and I could write you a big volume of book of those that have lived and served Christ. I thought so many uh some of the brothers working at the camp there. Brother Joseph, brother James both said and another brother said, "We were children in this camp. We were children in this camp. Did my heart good." Here they're children in the camp. Now they're fathers themselves and building so some other children can go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I've seen it remain steadfast. &gt;&gt; This the same gospel as brother Brandham could say. It's the same thing I believed when I was a young man. Same gospel. It's the same gospel. We're just further down the road. It's the same gospel. The same character. &gt;&gt; You have to help me now. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, now we're just coming to where I want to preach. &gt;&gt; Uh, the first coming, I'm going to come come back to some of these things I've just spoke on, but the first coming of Christ, say it this way, please, for me, just prick your conscience and your mind now. The first coming of God's presence. So I'll I'll just move from the word coming for a moment because it uses presence. You go to the go to the diglot you'll see the word presence because the presence and the coming and the face seeing him face to face all those are in in one line that has to do with his coming. So the first coming of God's presence to the earth. Now could you please see for a moment? Can you see uh the great eternal being that covers all time and space? And now he's focusing and coming down to a vortex, an incredible intensity. This God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. This creator, creative power in flesh, walking in a body exactly the same as yours. Such a concentration until they could say the whole godhead bodily was in the person of Jesus Christ. And as such, when he opened his mouth, not a myth, not some little story, but he opened his mouth, spoke to the waves, &gt;&gt; and they obeyed and still, &gt;&gt; spoke to the wind. Imagine one man speaking to the wind and the wind subsides. One man crying at the tomb of Lazarus. And in there a man stinkketh already. Four days in that heat closed up in that tomb. One man, Lazarus, come forth. &gt;&gt; After he had cried, after he wept, not for Lazarus's death, he wept for their unbelief, &gt;&gt; not knowing what was there. What? Not knowing what was right with them. Maybe they were touching them. Maybe they were shouldertosh shoulder. &gt;&gt; I'm not just preaching. That's exactly where you stand. &gt;&gt; If we could believe and have a united faith, I'll say what brother Brandham said. There wouldn't be a sick person here in the next five minutes. &gt;&gt; If we realize who is here and why he's here and who spoke these words and what kind of a message that you have come to believe, I tell you what, it's unworthy. If it if it's beyond this planet, &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be a sick person here. &gt;&gt; Choose to believe in the name of Jesus Christ. Choose to believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 33 years of that concentrated presence on earth. 33 years. But in the 33 years he grew up, he was the age of these boys here, the age of these young men here. Then he got the age of the older. He became 30 years old. And now then he stepped onto the scene and went down to the river and was baptized of John. And the voice speaking out, this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. this concentration and then three three and a half years of incredibly intense ministry, hardly having time to eat and sleep many times and then ending on a cross. God followed this same pattern in the last days and a messenger that he sent and a prophet that he raised up that would minister for 33 years the same length as the life of Jesus Christ. only now this time it's not just a Palestine it must go to the world so it can't be just three and a half years but it's the same length of God's concentration of his presence on earth &gt;&gt; hear me now &gt;&gt; and get the get the thought now brother Brandham is not just a messenger not just a prophet this was a concentration &gt;&gt; of God's presence &gt;&gt; on earth &gt;&gt; because this is part and parcel of his second coming. &gt;&gt; He has to have this to introduce it. And so comes the same ministry &gt;&gt; when the dead are there and the mother with a stiff baby in her been having it for 12 hours. the Mexican woman and coming and screaming and wouldn't let it crawling under the feet of the deacons and the ushers and whatever more and holding and been standing in the rain for hours and I got that child under a blanket and it warms under the prophet's hands and came to life and screamed out because there was and and on the mountain and I was there on the mountain after four days of storm and rain and cold and I wore my rain clothes to have him stand and say this is over and we're right out of here dry. &gt;&gt; In 20 minutes, the sun is shining. Within 20 minutes, a warm wind is blowing and the clouds dispense and disperse and we ran. I was I was closer to the willows than I am to those doors. And by the time I would have hit those willows, I'd have been soaked to my skin. By the time we rode out, which is my maybe a half an hour later, those bushes were already dry, the leaves were dry, and the wind came and blew everything. Hear the at the voice of a man. &gt;&gt; Storm, go back. &gt;&gt; Fisher, you have your life. &gt;&gt; Possum &gt;&gt; has its life. Go back to your babies. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a creator. &gt;&gt; Speaking through an adopted son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In our time. So we could take those words that would utter from that mouth also not having to do with things of the past, but even for this time there will be an earthquake. &gt;&gt; Don't anybody here ever dare to call upon him when you hear or if you shall hear that Los Angeles in that area is shaking and heaving. I don't expect it'll sink in just moments of time. I expect it will slide as he said into the ocean. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will belch up with its great upheavalss from underneath and that bench that holds the city of Los Angeles is going to give way and it's going to sink into the ocean. I will see I see that there'll be perhaps great fishissurers of ocean water start to come in. Ambulances won't be able to go. Air airplanes won't be able to fly off of the the airport at Lax Air Force at the air base rather. the trains, uh, subways, nothing else will be able to move for the fissurers and the sinking and the and the disparity and the diverse uh levels of the ground. That's it may even take a few days. How many people are you going to haul out of a city of maybe 10 million, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, how does that happen? You know how it happens? Because the creator &gt;&gt; who made the belching of the earth for those that wouldn't believe in a hell is sit on a whole planet of it. &gt;&gt; He said it'll belch forth. Chile is belching forth where brother Louise is. Send us pictures of dust caked all over their cars. Everybody wearing masks &gt;&gt; because one man speaks. Amen. &gt;&gt; This may be over the edge, but I'm satisfied myself. &gt;&gt; This earthquake, and I'm going to show you pictures of two brothers that were put in prison last year. &gt;&gt; We prayed for them right here. They were put in prison in China for this message. &gt;&gt; And a few months later, it's a enormous earthquake and buildings shook. I'll read for you what came yesterday. Many believers have asked about the saints in China after the destructive earthquake happened four days ago. Brother Murphy phone brother Ivan and Sister Asenath. Where's Brother Ivan and Sister Asenth? Maybe they're maybe they're up in the room there with brother Murphy. Sister Asenth's parents live in this city and there's about 30 believers there. It's about maybe 200 kilome or 200 miles from the actual epicenter right at the epicenter of the earthquake. and her parents live in Deao Sashwan uh province about 390 kilometers for those of you that in kilometers eastward of the epicenter there's about 30 saints in the city the earthquake happened at 2:30 in the afternoon on Monday their time most of the believers either work or or at home two of the sisters were visiting each other and cooking together while one of the sister's husbands was downstairs. They lived in a very old 8 to 10 floor apartment. And when the quake struck, the building was fiercely rocking. Then the sisters immediately know that it's an earthquake. So they kneel down right away and pray, but not with fear, only praising the Lord. They even thought that the rapture is coming. And after they prayed, they felt great peace in their heart. So they they just stand up and keep making their dumplings. This time the sister's husband ran up when he saw them making their dumplings because he's not a Christian. He's not a believer. And he saw the sisters standing there chatting, fellowshipping, and he was more stunned by their reaction than he was by the earthquake. And he asked them with stammering lips, "Why? Why? Why? Oh, oh, shall we run?" Because he saw everybody out in the buildings and the streets were packed with frightened people and screaming. And the sisters just assured the husband that everything was fine. Actually, not one item in their house was damaged. Not even a glass. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You talk about a preserve preservation. They then contacted with other believers and all of them are fine. Some of the believers were praying at that time. And when the quake struck, they just filled with joy because they all thought this is the time that the Lord is coming to take them home. They even felt a little bit sad when this was not actually happened. No one was injured. No one had any fear. One sister said when she feel the shaking and the only thing that came to her mind is Lord am I ready? Then she knelt down and crying to the Lord to search her heart. God has a way to bring people down on their knees but for good. And after this earthquake there are several aftershocks that are also strong. Two measured six and five measured five. That's seven more earthquakes. But none of them affect this city of Dao. It is such a contrast between the believers and the world. The peace and the calmness showed in the believers, men and women, greatly impacted their loved ones who are not believers. The one that disrespect and scorn their belief now turns silent and even asks their wife or husband, "Shall we run or not?" asking them, "Should we run or don't run?" When the aftershocks happened, they dare not to make any move, for they knew better. Whatever their their believed wife or husband said is come from above, the heavenly one is more stable than the earthly. There are several signs forewarned the people about the earthquake, but men ignored it as usual. There are thousands upon thousands of toads and frogs ran out of their hiding place in the epicenter and crossed the road and everything three days before the quake struck. It's on YouTube apparently. You can type toad's earthquake. People reported to the television station, but the scientists said it's normal because their mating season, but the lowest creature without sin knew better than the highest creature after the fall. &gt;&gt; May this earthquake serve as a sign that warns the people that now is the shaking time. from Hebrews 12:27 said that this word yet once more signifyth the removal of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We pray that the Lord will shake open the doors, he said, for the message spreading in China. &gt;&gt; Well, our time has slipped away and I don't want to keep you, but I have so so much more and so we'll just take it uh uh at another time, but I have I have these slides. I want you to see these. And uh I have some on Israel perhaps. I will I'm just being I was just showing you about China. I will go down to uh can you give me slide 12? Is that possible? Give me slide 12. Okay, here's the area and that's pretty well self-explanatory. This quake was of such magnitude friends that it was felt here and here. So here's a dou where the believers are and it's right in this area that the quake took place. I'll show you the pictures of this brother and this brother. Those are the two that were imprisoned. I don't know which of these sisters, but isn't that a lovely group of people? There's the two brothers that were in prison. I don't know just how long they were in prison. Now recent national disasters uh 204 the Indian Ocean and the tsunami 225,000 deaths 1.69 million displaced 7 billion given in aid. The hurricane Katrina 1836 deaths 76 78,000 displaced 81 billion cost of destruction in Kashmir Pakistan 79,000 deaths this is all just recent 3.3 million displaced 5 billion estimated cost of destruction 208 Burma cyclone 78,000 plus deaths and incidentally I just had to bump that up 56,000 missing, 2 to 3 million homeless. In China, 35,000 deaths. I had to bump that up also. 220,000 injured, 115 billion in destruction. says, "But notice the very generation of Jews that seen the return back to Palestine, that generation would see these things happen and just the last two years she was fully become a nation without her own money." Uh, and and there she is. I just want to say I'll just shut that off just now. I just want to say we as believers with the with what the message has made known to us, we see it. And today I felt as though I was just more or less giving an overview. So we touched on the conditions that we're living with. Don't get accustomed to these conditions. We talk about some of the disasters that are taking place and these things. Perhaps you may have heard me say it before, but I'll say it this way. When I speak, I get asked frequently about what I think will take place. Uh will we be here when will we be here when uh uh the earthquake and when Los Angeles sinks? Uh I say this that if I'm here, I'm not worried. I'm not concerned the least. What happens the whole West Coast 1500 miles? I'm not the least bit concerned. I'm no more concerned than Rahab was right on the wall that was to fall. &gt;&gt; I'm no more concerned than the two sisters cooking dumplings. &gt;&gt; God called us to be here. &gt;&gt; God has brought you here. &gt;&gt; God has called us for a voice. And you could be sitting right on the very epicenter of an atomic bomb and you be maybe the only one that would survive. There's nothing that can affect the believer. Do you believe that? Not a thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see what's happening with with with the Jews, with Israel. Do I understand everything? No. I don't understand all the politics and all. But the thing is, I want you to go with this in your heart today. Blessed is he that readeth. Blessed is he that readeth. Read. Understand what he reads. Not don't wait till you see something happening and say, "Oh my, isn't that wonderful? I look in the Bible. Now I can see it." No, that's not that's backwards. We believe it. And when it happens, we say, "Well, that's what I always knew was going to happen." We believe that. That's the way it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; I had I have a minister's wife, minister's wife is down in Eastern Washington, and they were withstanding the message and withstanding any of those that were receiving it. And yet, Brother Brandham to them was a great man, one of the greatest men, one of the greatest ministries. And they were withstanding believers coming and young people coming to believe. And here they had an earthquake there in in San Francisco. Who was the first one on the phone to me? That pastor's wife, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know what her words were? What did brother Brandham say about the earthquake in California? Did he say there's going to be three? &gt;&gt; Why don't you read it yourself and find out what he said? &gt;&gt; Why get all distressed when you when you've been withstanding something that it deep in your heart of hearts? &gt;&gt; See, why did Jesus tell the Jews? Why did Jesus tell them in Matthew 24 about the destruction coming and there won't be left one stone upon another? You wouldn't find another preacher saying, "But a prophet stands up in this day there wasn't one believer caught in that city." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one believer caught &gt;&gt; in the destruction in the judgment. Judgment. &gt;&gt; We're actually in a judgment right now. The world is being judged. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, right now things are rocking and reeling. The financial Who's got control of the finances? &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; Who's got control of inflation? Nobody. &gt;&gt; Who's got control of your fuel at the gas pumps? Nobody. &gt;&gt; Who's got control of anything? Nobody's got control. Right. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't take anything. H how do you know that your country isn't already absolutely broke? &gt;&gt; How do you know that you're not just spending money that they're just printing? &gt;&gt; So, oh, I'm getting I'm I'm making so much. I'm making 100 grand a year. I'm making 50 grand a year. What are you making when it you go you go to the you go to the grocery store and that's gone and the rent that's gone. Yeah, you're making three times what you used to make, but still don't have anything and maybe even go behind. &gt;&gt; What is it? Who's controlling it? &gt;&gt; You see this antique right here? Come on, Paul. It's not such a joke. Antiques are supposed to be hundred and over. So, I'm just shy of that. See this? If you put your cards down, you can get anything these days. &gt;&gt; Alaska Airlines and American Express. Sad thing is they want to get paid air miles and my air card so I can go to the hospital and don't have to pay anything and all these fine things. In my short lifetime, when I was your age, I never saw one of those. &gt;&gt; I never saw one. &gt;&gt; There was no credit card. &gt;&gt; There wasn't. How the world run? Oh, it barely ran, but we ran all right. We ran just fine. Well, what'd you pay with? Ever hear money? Cash. Ever hear cash? We paid with cash. How'd you get paid? In a little envelope with a little money in it. Heavy on the little. I worked for my father-in-law. That's why it was little. And you know what? When I got to be I want to I wanted a guitar. I want to get a guitar. I would Oh, I just yearn for a guitar. There's no such thing as charging. No such a thing as credit. Buy it now and don't pay till next year. There's &gt;&gt; no such a thing. Had to pay cash for it. But you know what? It was better then. &gt;&gt; It was better then. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, I had some change in my pocket, but it wasn't worth anything, so I didn't bring it here. But when I was your age, you know what? The quarters were silver. Pure silver. The 50 cent piece were pure silver and the dimes were pure silver. I had something. &gt;&gt; I had some substance. Now it's pot metal. I don't know. Might be made out of beer cans for all I know. Just a bunch of metal stamped out. And here you are. It's still worth 25 cents. Not worth nothing. &gt;&gt; Not worth nothing. Isn't this a joke? This is humorous, but it's true. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely true, friends. This is the world we're in. But you know what? Prophet said it would be this way. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is. Oh, they're buying and they're selling and they're doing all kinds of trade. That's the day that we're in. &gt;&gt; You know what? I've just started preaching. Really? &gt;&gt; He starts right in the days of Noah. &gt;&gt; Says the first thing, oh, thank God I didn't forget this. Said the first thing they multiplied. Yes. &gt;&gt; As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the son of man. He was comparing that with his day, &gt;&gt; the day of his ministry, the day of the revealing of the son of man. As it was days of Noah. So they multiplied. And you know what he goes to? Never saw it before. In all these years, never saw it before. He says there won't be enough food. &gt;&gt; Who in the congregation's been hearing about the shortage of food? Raise your hands. &gt;&gt; How many been hearing about the shortage of food? 45, 50 years ago, a prophet said, "As it was in this day, &gt;&gt; as it was in that day, there'll be a repeat in this day." &gt;&gt; And a shortage of food, limiting even Walmart, limiting how much rice you can buy. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there'll be a shortage of food because he says the population, they won't be able to feed the population. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Then he goes right into the second thing was the beauty of women. Just happens to be a fact, friends. &gt;&gt; And quite frankly, I've gone so far out now. I've probably made so many enemies. I hope I've made a few friends. &gt;&gt; But it's today and you young fellas that look out and say and think you see something beautiful. Make sure it is what you see. Right. &gt;&gt; Make sure it's not Max Factor &gt;&gt; and these other people that make all kinds of body parts. &gt;&gt; Say it with such a wonderful shape. That shape might be silicon. &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen. &gt;&gt; And here we got a message that protects us from that kind of thing. He said we look at character. Beautiful character. character that comes from the word of God. That's what we see. Hallelujah. And here people all falling in love with a whole bunch of false nothing, false eyelashes and false makeup on and false body parts and false hair and extension this and extension that. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you young sister just forgive me. Is old brother Ed. Remember the antique preached this morning, &gt;&gt; but it's still true. &gt;&gt; It's still God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Make sure it's character that you see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet said it'd be the beauty. &gt;&gt; It'd be a snare. And then from then on that led right into led right into men just taking taking to them wives. They didn't get married. Oh, has there ever been an age like this? &gt;&gt; Just take a woman. W woman just taking a man. In this day, as I said earlier, woman with woman, man with man, just taking woman. And now even on my marriage certificate, it has to do with partner. Which partner do you have? Why partner? What's wrong with wife? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with wife? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with husband? &gt;&gt; Who are they talking about? &gt;&gt; What are they trying to say? &gt;&gt; And that isn't my choice. That's imposed upon me as a minister of the gospel to marry people. And I'm to ask the young lady, do you want to keep your own name? Because there's a section there for to keep her own name. Do you want to go by your maiden name? The scripture teaches that the wife takes the husband's name. &gt;&gt; We've taken the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Who here wants to say, "I want to go by own my own name." Your name's not worth anything. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's not worth anything. It's only the trail of your lineage down here. We want to take his name. I want to be Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to become one with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if I left anything out, we'll come to it another time. &gt;&gt; We're going to see it, friends. We're going to see days yet that we never even thought was we'd ever see. &gt;&gt; They're on the way. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking fear. I'm speaking very positive. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they do. &gt;&gt; Take the whole world. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. Let this whole world crumble. &gt;&gt; Just give me this word. Hallelujah. This word has seen me this far. And I've been so happy with this word. So happy with this message. So happy with thus sayeth the Lord. And the more I see the world crumble, I say, "Thank God I've got this word revealed. &gt;&gt; Thank God we got this message." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to sing? &gt;&gt; Ready to worship. &gt;&gt; Right now, you know, I get so independent. I don't care how you did. I had a great time. &gt;&gt; I just love this word. I just love this message. Oh my heart. Amen. Let's sing take this whole world but give me Jesus.

Uh, I'm going to I and my wife are going to be taking the Memorial Day service for Pastor Ivy in Gibson's, Missouri. We've never been there. Been wanting a meeting for a lot of years.

Brother Frank, would you come and ask a prayer blessing upon this group of people? Love Brother Frank's testimony and his approach, [Music] one antique to another. [Music] You know, one thing I enjoyed about brother Frank when I was just early into his uh coming to the knowledge of the message, I found this man very unusual. He talked about the bride. He would make comments about the bride and he had songs that from the old hymns about the bride of Christ. That always was something that must have stuck with him. And now he come to the message of the bride. God bless you, brother Frank. Amen. We just bow our hearts and heads together. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for the privilege of being able to be here today. Oh God, how faithful you are, Lord, faithful amongst unfaithful around us, but Lord, amongst your precious little bride. There's that faithfulness, Lord. That dedication, oh God, that you've put in our hearts to serve you and honor you, Lord, till you come, Lord. We we've heard all about what's going what's happening around the world, but we know that you have secure you've secured us in your in your word, oh Lord, to glorify your holy name, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for this time together. Bless your precious servant, Brother Ed, and strengthen him for further labors, Lord, and give him wisdom and guidance, Lord, as he minister to the saints next week. Ask you to bless the saints there, too, Father. Oh God, just bless and keep us each and everyone through the rest of the day. Lord, we thank you. Pray for the saints that have to go over the border. Lord, I pray that they'll make it a easier path for them to get home tonight and ask your blessing from the from the rest of the day.
