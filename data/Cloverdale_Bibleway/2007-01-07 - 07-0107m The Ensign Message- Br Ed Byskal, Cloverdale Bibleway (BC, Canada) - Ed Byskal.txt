Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We got a number of requests here this morning. And we're needy people. I'm going to ask our brother Darren Hoffman. Brother Darren, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer this morning. There's a request that's come from uh brother Ron Borthwick and this requesting we pray for sister Karen Belarski's parents. Um she lost both of her parents within a few days. They had been in uh intensive care for some time and she had to run back and forth to the hospital and her father died on the 26th of December was buried yesterday and last night her mother, dad and died and uh sister Karen has just shattered. They said brother Ron took the funeral yesterday and we'll probably have to do a repeat in a few days time. and the two children, Shar Sarah and Jonathan. Um I said, "Brother Tony has kept so busy with all two and he's now concerned for his wife's health and um the funeral was just finished when she got the call from the hospital to attend her dying mother and her mother didn't even know that her husband had died. So we want to pray for sister Karen this morning. Uh there's a request that we pray for brother Dutch Scott's family. his dad passed away. Want to remember brother Jim Lo who's battling cancer and the doctors have only given him a few days to live. Uh there's a a request for prayer for brother Tommy Milsaps. He's going in for surgery on his wrist. They have to graft bone from his hip onto his wrist. Sister Filina Dross called in to request prayer. She's at home sick. We want to remember this morning um Sister uh Norma Smith. She was taken into the hospital uh with pneumonia. Uh Sister Lynn Franos is at home sick this morning. There's a request we pray for a name a lady by the name of uh Gay Shoots. She was in a car accident three years ago and is still in the hospital. Uh she can't do anything for herself. She was pregnant at the time and her husband is now raising the child alone. Sister Faith neighbors requesting we pray for her sister Alena Kolkurt who's having a heart operation uh tomorrow sometime want to remember brother Burkhard and sister Doris the Lord would uh bless them as they go overseas and keep them in the center of his will and also there's a testimony here from our sister Lisa St. John, the doctors in Florida and Washington had thought Samuel was having seizures when he's sleeping, and we finally had him tested at their insistence. Praise God, there were no seizures, and want to thank God publicly for his faithfulness in healing Samuel completely. We give God all of the glory. Amen. So, let's remember these requests this morning. And uh if you've got a need this morning, hasn't been mentioned, the Lord knows what it is. And if you're listening in on the internet this morning and you've got a need, you just take it before the Lord as you go to prayer and the D. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we are thankful, Lord Jesus, we can come, Lord, that we can come before you this morning. Lord, we're truly such a needy people, Father. Well, I'm thankful, Lord God, that we have one who is allsufficient. One that is able to hear our heart's cries, Lord. One that sees our conditions. One who experience what we're going through. You know the pains, Lord. You know the agonies, Father. You know the tears, Lord, that we go through each day, Lord. You're mindful, Father, of of your children, Lord, and what they're going through, Father, and how that can give us such comfort, Lord Jesus, knowing that we're not alone, knowing that you're by our side. You said you'd never leave us nor forsake us, but that you'd be with us, even in us to the consummation of the ages, Lord. And this morning, Lord Jesus, you've heard, Lord, the prayer requests that Brother Rod has mentioned, Lord. So many of them, Father. Many more, Lord Jesus, that weren't even mentioned, Lord. prayers that are being tucked within the hearts of your people. Lord, those that are sick, Father, those that are in need of financial help, Lord, those that are need of spiritual help, uh, mental health, Father, we ask, Lord Jesus, that you are as you are the provider of our every need, Lord, that you go to each one of these needs, Lord. Those that have have that have their hands raised up, Father, may they not be left out, Lord Jesus. those on the internet, Father, those that are part of the congregation, Lord, may you go to them and meet them in their hour of need, dear God. Lord, we think of these ones that have lost loved ones, Lord. Our sister Karen, I believe our brother Dutch Scott, Lord. Father, I pray that you'll go to them, Lord Jesus. I pray that you'll bring them comfort, Lord. How there are missing lives in their in missing people in their lives now, Father. Lord, there's there's holes, Lord Jesus, where which were once filled with loved ones. Lord, I pray that you'll go and that you'll be very near unto them. And Lord Jesus, through the trial, Lord God, bring them strength, Lord. Bring them comfort, Father. May they be stronger, Lord God, through this trial. Lord, we think of all those that are ailing in body, Lord Jesus. So many, Father. Lord Jesus, we Lord, we know what you've done for little brother Samuel, Lord. Father, Brother Bram, if we just have the right mental attitude toward any promise of God, you'd bring it to pass, Lord. So give us that right mental attitude. Father, let us confess, Lord Jesus, that we're already healed. Let us claim the promises of God. Father, increase our faith, Lord Jesus, that unbelief would scatter, dear God. And Lord Jesus, that you would back up our confession by bringing to pass your word, Lord, not the words of a man, but words of Almighty God. Lord, that we can confess, that we can claim for ourselves and for our loved ones. Lord, we ask, Lord Jesus, that you'll meet each one. Father, we ask that you'll come and speak to us through our pastor this morning, Lord. Father, we're a needy people. We need our faith increased, Father. We're in that cycle of the rapture, Lord. And where are we today, Father? We're closer and we want to be ready for it, Lord. Father, we want to be used this year, Lord, as you just been speaking to our pastor about this being the year of witness. Let us be witnesses, Lord. Let us be bright and shining lights. Let us brighten the corners where we are, Father. That our loved ones would see the glory of God. That they would see Jesus Christ veiled once again in human flesh. That they would desire what we have, Lord. Father, because it's for them. Because you said the promises unto you and to your children, to them that it's far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. So we're claiming our loved ones, Father. We're claim each and every one of them, Father. We'll not leave one of them behind. So give us strength, give us courage, father, to press on in this year, Lord Jesus, to be better examples, better witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is our desire, Lord, to honor you, to worship you, Lord, to praise you. And Lord, just thankful that your word says that these signs shall follow them that believe, Lord. and all these prayer requests that we've spoken of. Lord, help us, Lord God, as we wait upon you, knowing that these shall come to pass. Those things we've asked for. Be with us now the remainder of the song service. Lord, strengthen us, we pray, Lord, and just remembering Brother Burkhard, Sister Doris, Father, as they'll be traveling, give them traveling mercies, Lord. Father, just pray that they'll have a blessed time, a fruitful time, Lord, and bring them back to us safely. We ask in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. may be seated.

I really appreciate everyone who's here and uh just before we read the scripture and all if you don't mind remaining standing for just a moment and you'll be you'll be seated in a bit. Uh we we join with congregation of our brother pastor Schumacher in Germany who was called to be with the Lord in the last couple days. And uh this is the brother he had uh he had a some heart difficulty and I think a kind of a minor heart attack or a major heart attack. I don't know which. And here he was he came right to the pulpit a day or two right afterwards and has been taking his post there and we don't have any other details and just to say that he was called to be with the host of witnesses &gt;&gt; just quickly we've prayed for our sister Norma Smith uh who has pneumonia she was taken to the hospital last night about uh midnight and her daughters and granddaughter Sister Jen Johnson other sisters are with her and Sister Sharon Braxton. I believe I really have a great deal of respect for Sister Norma Smith just as quiet spirit godly woman and comes always to the house of God under any circumstances or condition. And so I know that she'd just dearly love to be here this morning. And we say, "May God's Holy Spirit hover in that room and be near our sisters that are there. And may his perfect will be done. I don't want to see her suffering at all." So, God be with her. We didn't have a time on New Year's Eve to say everything we would like to have said. Uh but I I want to make a comment uh regarding our our brother Richard Drake who's standing here. And our brother Richard Drake is a has been a been here since been a a young teenage boy in a long time. And he has a a responsible position with the Translink and the bus system, but he has a responsible position also amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. and he has taken as a personal commission really to send humanitarian aid to the Ukraine to orphanages to Russia to Siberia in the far north has worked with brother Gido and it unbeknown to perhaps many in the congregation that we need to take time and think about it uh and because I believe that as much as you have done it under one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me. And brother Richard has collected clothing from schools uh because he used to work in the school system and has connections gets clothing that's left at the schools uh that's left on the buses that is sent here from churches in different places until we've had to tell people don't send anymore. But this year's this last year's shipping totals was 9,752 pounds to the believers and orphans of the Ukraine. That was a total of 212 boxes and 29 boxes uh to the believers and orphans in Siberia. And from the initiation of each of these projects, from the initiation of each of these projects, our monthly average for boxes that have been shipped stand at 16 boxes per month to the Ukraine and one and a half boxes per month to Siberia. That's since the program was initiated. And I want to say to uh brother Richard and uh the men of vision under whose opaces this has all been happening during this time. God bless you for the last year. And God prosper you even much more in the f in the future years. And it's not just clothing but other things. They've sent dried food and the and the thanks the letters of thanks that have come from these places. in fact is the the director of the orphanages in the Siberia has said that men of vision is the only organization that stood by their promise and said they would do something and have done it and I say God bless you brother Richard and those that help you. Amen. I think they deserve. Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer, please, before we turn to the word. Lord, our hearts are filled with thanksgiving that we could be called the sons and daughters of God to be birthed into this family to have Lord the opportunity and the privilege, the honor to call others that are around on the surface of this globe in other countries our brothers and sisters. Lord, you have called our brother Schumacher to come into your presence to a higher calling to join this great host of witnesses. Pray for his assembly. Pray for those that are stepping into his uh place of responsibility. Give them wisdom, oh God. Give them courage, I pray. May they declare your word with a mighty witness. And father, as we are gathered here today, we have uh uh many needs amongst us. We've heard the prayer already that's been prayed, but now we pray especially, Father, as your word lays open before us that it will be illuminated. And may we be a quickened people. May we be illuminated by the Holy Spirit. And father, I pray that all of the flu, all of those channels of the flesh and all of those channels to of the spirit that all the memory and the imagination and all the other affections, oh God, and things which would be hindrances, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God, the flame of God, the fire of God will burn everyone clear, Lord, and may the word have free access to the soul And let that one channel, Lord, be filled with faith. Let it be supercharged with faith, oh God. And as the word is spoken, I pray, Lord, it'll be illuminated every individual in the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint us now, Lord. We thank you for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe it, don't we? &gt;&gt; Turn in your Bibles, please, to John, John's Gospel, the 12th chapter. We're going to read some verses from starting with verse 27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this hour came I But for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. Then down to on down to verse 32. The people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered. Others said, "An angel spake to him." Jesus answered and said, "This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out. and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. I'll have you read that verse 32 together with me, and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. While you're still standing, Brother Brandham made uh I think a very very significant point when he came to this verse. He turned to it in the first seal before the seals were now to be delivered and preached and he turned to John the 12th chapter and began with the 23rd verse. And he said, "Now listen here real close, and then you won't have to wonder no more what it is." And Jesus answering them said, "The hour is come that the son of man should be glorified." So you're at the end of an age there. His ministry is ending. I draw want to draw your attention. The prophet's ministry too was ending. The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified. And he said, "Then what about the hour has come that when his bride must be taken away?" What that hour? What the hour has come that time shall be no more? And the angel is ready to set one foot on land and the other on the sea. With a rainbow over him, that's the covenant. With his with feet and say, "Times run out." &gt;&gt; And besides that, he raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more. And the scripture says that it's that time will be no more. There'll be no more delay for those things that have been sealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now he says and and he says time has run out and besides that he raised up his hand and swore that that would be that time would be no more when this happened. How perfect it is. He said a sworn affidavit to the church. The hour is come that the son of man should be glorified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he is glorified in the fulfilling of his promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you read with me two other scriptures, three scriptures actually. Isaiah the 11th chapter and we'll read verses 10, 11, and 12. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an end sign of the people. To it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamoth and from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an end sign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. God bless you as you have your seats. I want to greet you all the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and all who are joined with us today from many places around the world and it's an increasing congregation and we say God blessings upon them as well gathering in rooms in perhaps places where they've chosen to gather and so they are with us and we are one body &gt;&gt; in Christ. I want to speak to you today on the ends message. Nine ens the end sign. The scripture says that he will set up an end sign. And an end sign is simply something that is lifted up, a standard, a signal or a banner. An end sign is a rallying point, something we rally around. It is something that is not only to be lifted up, but we think of an end sign as a a flag or something that we identify with. And uh we all are identified as as as individuals we are identified immediately we think of we're identified with a certain nation. Uh I understand that even this month there has been a great deal of pressure upon the Canadian government by the American government to cause the people within this country that do not yet have uh legal status as a as a passport. They're perhaps on visas, student visas, visitors visas, etc. within Canada and America wants them to have Canadian passports. And so there's a enor enormous Russian crush at this time for everyone to get their passports and hundreds are lining up trying to get their passports so that they will be able to freely cross the border back and forth. What is America saying? We want we want a a country to step up to the plate and take responsibility that these people are indeed citizens of the country and then they have freedom to go back and forth. And uh of course I don't want to get into this but Canada says well give us a little more time because there's so many people that are here and we've got to process all of these documents. As individuals, we are identified with a a country or a nation or a place or a people, but yet we we may not have been uh personally in attendance when great events took place and unfolded within the country to which we are associated with or identified with. But yet we are identified with what that country stands for. &gt;&gt; And when they put up their flag and uh uh we we have respect and awe and reverence to what that flag represents because it represents a people. It represents a culture. It represents an idea. It represents uh either democracy or dictatorship or freedom or or whatever. it it represents a free market or it represents something that we say I identify with that and uh uh however we we may not you know be in agreement with everything that our nation stands for but uh we are still identified with it and brother Brandham says to be an American I must be identified with my nation When I am born here in this country, I become a citizen and I'm identified with this nation. All it is, all that it is, I am. All that it has been, I am. For I'm identified as an American. Then I have to take all of its shame, all of its glory. Whatever it is, I am because I'm identified with it. And Almighty God unveiled. He said, "I'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of God." &gt;&gt; I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with that group. &gt;&gt; I can say that. &gt;&gt; You can say that. I trust you can say that. I'm identified with a group of people that believe that the bride of Jesus Christ has been called. I'm identified with a group of people that believe we have heard indeed the rapture call and we're on our way in that direction. I believe that. And he said he's identified with a group that knows that he's unveiled and knows he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. were identified with that group of people, identified with that kind of a message. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Just laying a foundation now. &gt;&gt; There was only a few, I would say, brave American Marines that were actually on the hill called Euima. But a whole nation identifies with it. One of the most famous pictures that's many know perhaps and don't even know why it's a famous picture, but they they they see it, but there's a people and a nation that is identified with it. And there's a reverence and respect that is attached to such an event. When a flag or an end sign is desecrated, stepped on, spit on, and burned. There's a a resentment or a disgust that comes within a person that that because there is a a feeling that's being expressed not not to a piece of cloth but to a whole people to a whole idea to a whole thought to a whole way of life. We're saying these people hate the way I live. They hate the country and the things that we stand for. And so it's something that is really raises feelings of resentment. An end sign is raised to be looked upon with a sense of pride, awe, respect and to give courage. Also, it identifies ownership. It's an evidence of ownership. We fellowship around a message. And I want to come to just a moment in a few moments, but I'm going to show you some end signs and just to recap in visual form what we have uh what I've been saying up to this point. And thanks brother Aaron Hardy for assisting me. And I wonder now if the brothers would just run through these video clips. All that you see here are identified in this congregation. And perhaps we've missed some just about couple two three seconds. Congo, Trinidad, Bosnia, Germany, Holland, Belgium. I want to show you a short actually clip of what took place for this famous picture of the Marines on Just takes a moment for the brothers too. Bring it around. This cost while we're going back to the picture. This cost 4,000 uh American lives in just a very very short time. 4,000 more than died in 911 and 20,000 Japanese that were attempting to defend just they say, well, it's just a piece of rock. Uh but it has some significance and it was a strategic point. And when these boys, you'd think when there's artillery and mortar shells and ships blasting the this piece of stone, this rock, and dive bombers bombing it, just bombing it to gravel, to pebbles, and all of this cost. and men lying everywhere wounded and crying and screaming and men dying. Uh that's 24,000 men in a short 24,000. A reasonable city that perished in a short time in an island that has that has no buildings on it, no nothing. And in the boy's minds, in the boy's minds with all of this noise and the den of war and the emotion of the moment, somehow they had it in their hearts and minds to go up that steep hill several hundreds of feet and there raise the flag of their nation, old glory. And this picture was shot and it's very very famous picture and we may go to the next one. We have a an end sign. &gt;&gt; This came at great cost. This is the one that's been raised up. He was lifted on this pole for the world to see, desecrated, spit upon, beaten, hated, despised, rejected, and still is today. This one has gone through a second crucifixion. You know that this living Christ is alive today and is despised by the world and hated by the world. But God has lifted him up &gt;&gt; high and lifted up &gt;&gt; is this end sign is this banner. And he's in our end sign. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we'll rise to whatever position we need to. We'll climb whatever hill. We'll span whatever country. We'll cross whatever ocean. We'll go up to every mountain and cross the mountain ranges, whatever is necessary to lift up this end sign and say, "He's not dead. He's alive." Hallelujah. And the life of him, it's not a piece of cloth, but the life of him has come down into me, into you as by the Holy Spirit. And he I can declare he's alive. &gt;&gt; He represents my country. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's more than stars and stripes, friends. It's more than crosses and emblems of different kinds. This is our end sign. &gt;&gt; And God sent a messenger in our time to declare to you, he's not in the grave. He's alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to tell us we are citizens of another country. &gt;&gt; Our citizenship is not here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe something went through our heart as we saw the different flags of my country. Some are more patriotic than others. But I'll tell you when this when this one comes up that I identify with him. Identify with this end sign. I identify with this message to some people perhaps the message doesn't mean anything but when I say the message of the hour it has come here at great cost and I say this is he identifies he represents my nation he represents my citizenship I have my passport in his countrymen &gt;&gt; and he will turn he will turn and reveal himself to the people of this next flag. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they too &gt;&gt; shall know that this one is their king. &gt;&gt; This one is their end sign also. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you brothers. We're identified with all of its glory. We're here today as part of the human community. And as humans, we're identified with all of the failures of humanity. We're identified with Adam and Eve's transgression and their fall. We're identified with the deception that took place in the Garden of Eden. We might say, "Well, I don't identify with as a human in the human community." We all are marked &gt;&gt; in our bodies &gt;&gt; by what happened in Eden &gt;&gt; because every man, every woman, every child here is identified by death. &gt;&gt; In a as a human, we're dying. But as a son of God, we're alive. &gt;&gt; We have eternal life. And that eternal life never had a beginning and does not have an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, you're lost. &gt;&gt; Hopelessly lost. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't come to the time where you say, "I switch my allegiance from my country &gt;&gt; to that end sign of the word of God." Hallelujah. Doesn't mean we reject our country. Not at all. I say that the only real true good citizen of a country is a bornagain &gt;&gt; son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; We are identified with it. We're identified with Adam's transgression. And the Bible says, "For if by if by one man's offense death reigned by one, I may be misunderstood and perhaps I may have to even go back and explain some things, but the scripture says that death reigned." Reigned that's supremacy by one death became king. Much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. Now the believer can say grace is king. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Death was king. Death reigned by one man. And in the human life in the human body, we're identified in our body. We're marked &gt;&gt; by his transgression. You you can say this morning as I spoke last Sunday on attribution by attribution, you can say, "I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask to be born in a world filled with sin and trouble and injustice. And I didn't I didn't ask to be born in a world that's full of war and our best boys dying on the fields. &gt;&gt; 54 million &gt;&gt; died in the last Second World War. 54 million. And you never heard it until a prophet came and said the earth was suffering a birth pain. &gt;&gt; It had a great birth pain in the First World War. and and men were gassed and laid out on the on the grounds of of of the best of all of the countries. We're not in we're not here to take up the sight of one against the other or this one against that one. It's it's it's sin. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. It's death. &gt;&gt; It's is all that comes. It's from Satan. &gt;&gt; And the pride of man and the deception of man has cost us a very great price. &gt;&gt; No wonder. I mean, it it should beat in the heart of every of of any man, any woman that even has a basic human intelligence. They ought to say, "Whoever started this entire globe here, this little piece of dust that's circling out into the great universe, whoever started it, it's time for him to come back. It's time for him to correct it all. It's time for him to take and burn this pollution out of the earth and out of the air." And the prophet says, "And he shall do it and make it a thick dwelling place for himself and his bride." Hallelujah. I rejoice in that, friends. It's going to be a whole lot more than an evila. Calvary. That piece of rock on Calvary where they put the cross of Jesus Christ and hung the son of God there dying for you and dying for me. I tell you, that's our end sign. The boys fought a bloody battle getting up on top of bee with Jima. But I'll tell you another one. He didn't go with a whole bunch of guns. He didn't go with a bunch of ships backing them up. He didn't go with dive bombers coming down. He walked up there alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He walked up alone. God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he would not be deterred from his footsteps. Those are the bloody footsteps that walked up to the Mount Calvary Goltha and there hung alone before a world. I tell you my brother, my sister, that's why you're here. &gt;&gt; We're not here just having church. We're here to say I swear allegiance to the lamb. With all that I am, with all that I can be, with all that I have and all that I am, &gt;&gt; I swear allegiance to this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the scripture goes on to say, "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses." Death reigned. Death was king from Adam to Moses. Why? Because it was not until Moses when God would raise up this one who was first a prophet with the word in his mouth and come down from another mountain si with the word in his mouth. And it says and death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression. You might say, "I didn't sin like Adam sinned. I didn't do that. I didn't want that." But we're identified with it &gt;&gt; as humans. And the penalty came upon us by attribution. &gt;&gt; I know a little bit about death. So do you. I've stood by the caskets of too many people. I've stood in the in the rooms of too many people that are dying. How brother Brandon says nothing wants to die. Animals don't want to die. Things always are are doing everything they can to escape death and the agony of death. They don't want to die. Birds don't want to die. Nothing wants to die. They try to escape. says a man struggles and he says with the death gurgling in his throat striving trying to struggling to just get another breath and live a little bit longer. He doesn't want to die but he says the dying tree and the dying flower the dying man down here only testifies that there's another land where the tree doesn't die and the flower doesn't die and the man the woman doesn't die. Hallelujah. Do you want to go there? &gt;&gt; Do you plan to go there? Have you made your reservations? Do you plan to be there? &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; We're not here just having church. We're not here just to have a good time. We're certainly not here to be entertained. We're here to be a participant in this great body called the body of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the message that you say you believe. Even we've come here in comfort of your car or your automobile and come into this uh into this sanctuary and sit here today in the comfort of this room. Just remember this message did not come here in that kind of comfort. &gt;&gt; This message came here with a little prophet. You ought to you ought to listen to and and hear a service and just watch where he went the next day and the next day and the next day week in and week out and month in and month out with hardly a moment rest for his body. And I I can't even imagine knowing what time it takes for me to study and prepare for a service. And he's going night after night after night and having the people come forward and and they're pulling on him and the visions that are coming till they're almost packing him out. Literally are packing them out. That's how this message came. &gt;&gt; Didn't come for us to sit and quibble about. didn't come for us to sit and try to find some little uh special thing that ex excludes everybody else. That isn't why it came. It came so we could include the others. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we did not transgress after Adam's transgression, after the similitude of his transgression, the penalty of his transgression passed upon all. &gt;&gt; Okay. What is the way out? What is the answer for this? God has made a program and the program happens to be very simple. But it is absolute. &gt;&gt; And that program is this. God speaks his word. God confirms that word as being his word. You and I are responsible to believe that word. &gt;&gt; And in the simple act of believing it, God looks down and says, "You are righteous." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By my decree, you are righteous. &gt;&gt; On this side is an unbeliever. By his decree, you're a dying human &gt;&gt; and you're already dead spiritually. But by his decree, if you simply believe what he said and believe it's his word and say, "I believe it," he declares you're righteous. &gt;&gt; And he he gives you the gift of eternal life. though you could never earn it. &gt;&gt; It is that simple. &gt;&gt; Some say, "I want a deep res revelation." That's a deep one. &gt;&gt; That's a deep one. &gt;&gt; Because if Satan wants to do anything, he'll he'll sidetrack people, get their minds going a multitude of different directions, trying to get you away from the main main uh theme. And that theme is do you believe or do you disbelieve? As I mentioned last week, when God had raised out of the dust of the earth, you might not even looked at flags and whatever you thought when your flag came up, it it it wouldn't even begin. It wouldn't even be a spark of what was in God's mind and heart when he saw all of his creation was made and came up and let the grass bring forth and let the waters bring forth and created created his Eden &gt;&gt; and it was so marvelous. And then he put his own son there &gt;&gt; an end sign that this is mine. This is mine. And it was so wonderful when he had finally took out of the dust of the earth and raised the dust to its highest position &gt;&gt; and had one like himself &gt;&gt; and he came down &gt;&gt; and had to have fellowship with his son. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he walked with him. I believe there's just something very special in the very mind and heart and bosom of God. It's coming now, the cool of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I look forward to this time in the cool of the day when I'll be able to go down and fellowship with my son and walk with them in the in the beautiful gardens of paradise and have the trees and the and the uh the birds singing and be there and have fellowship. &gt;&gt; That was his end sign. And he raised it up. This is my standard. This is my image. And then the image fell. &gt;&gt; The image was worse than spit on. The image was disgraced and it was crushed and it no more resembled him. The prophet says he went right away. &gt;&gt; I will raise it up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will rebuild it again. I cannot leave it laying down there in the dust. I cannot leave it there stepped on. I can't leave it there dying. &gt;&gt; I will raise it up again. &gt;&gt; And he could only raise it up by finding those that would believe &gt;&gt; him. And Abraham believed God. And the scripture says, "And it was counted to him for righteousness." In other words, Abraham believed God and God took the attribution of death from him and attributed him with righteousness and said, "You are as you were supposed to be." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're dying. You're an old man. But I I decree that you are as you were supposed to be, as you were intended to be in my mind, in my thoughts. &gt;&gt; We'll walk again. In the paradise of God. &gt;&gt; And all down through the centuries of time came people. And God faithfully in each generation sending his word for his word was his end sign. And the people would look upon the end sign and they would see the end sign and something would move in their heart say that's that's my country. In this end sign, it spoke. &gt;&gt; These flags can't speak. We just have something in our heart because our mind and our memory and our imagination is filled with what it I what it represents and we say I'm identified with that representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now was another one &gt;&gt; and this end sign spoke said I go to prepare a place for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you shall be also. &gt;&gt; This end sign speaks. &gt;&gt; This end has a voice. &gt;&gt; This ends sign had a secret. So, I'm going to hold the secret till the very end time when I'm ready to call them home to the place that I've got ready for them. And then I'm going to come myself. I'm going to come. Oh my friends, I'm going to be short this morning. Even I got so much in my heart. But he said, I'm going to hold it. And this secret only the lamb himself can speak this and can loose it. I'm going to I'm going to come to receive them to myself. And the prophet says that that was the very revelation. That was the message in hearing the message and receiving it was him receiving you, not you receiving him. &gt;&gt; Amen. to receive them. &gt;&gt; I will come and receive them to myself. And that is when you heard his voice. &gt;&gt; And he drew you to himself. &gt;&gt; He was already receiving you, which is part and parcel of his coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of his coming. People are waiting to say, "Oh, when the Lord comes, when the Lord comes, he he already has arrived &gt;&gt; in word form. &gt;&gt; His word coming. to speak the word. &gt;&gt; And a group of people will say, "I don't believe that. I can't swallow that." But there's another one says, "And their ch they're Abraham's children by attribution." &gt;&gt; And they're like their father. &gt;&gt; They're like Abraham. I can't understand that. I don't understand how my body's going to be changed. I don't understand how I'm going to bring forth Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm so needy. &gt;&gt; He knows that. But he attributes &gt;&gt; his life &gt;&gt; by attribution. &gt;&gt; I say, is there nothing for us to do? Oh yes, of course. But our works, our works do not bring us any. I say zero righteousness. His righteousness is because he attributes it to you. &gt;&gt; Our works is that what we do because he has because he has loved us because he has saved us. We do it out of love. We don't do it out of service. We do it out of love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sin through an inherent sinful nature and death through sin passed upon all. And now I'm going to read a number of scriptures. And this if you want to follow along, it' be good for you to turn to Romans the 5th chapter. We start reading at verse 12 just so it gets really established in your heart. Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned. For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, understand that. For if through the offense of one, many be dead, the many are dead by attribution. They did not sin as as the original parent did. Much more the grace of God, and the gift of by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many, and not as it was by one that sinned, and not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is to many offenses unto justification. And the people could say, "Amen." For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, see, death became king, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the offense by of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we want to say grace is king. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Grace is king. Amen. &gt;&gt; King of my life, I crown thee now my thine that let the the the glory be king of my life. Grace this morning is king. &gt;&gt; Remember that &gt;&gt; not condemnation is king. Not death is king. You say well I am dying. I am getting older. But grace is king &gt;&gt; because who is greater? The one who brought the offense or the one who brought the free gift? the grace. He's the great one. &gt;&gt; And one more verse, verse 21. Now, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. And to reign, I say grace is king, but to reign. It is not only to be king, but to exercise kingly power, to exercise the highest influence. There was a time, and you know what? There are people who say they are believers, say they are Christians, but condemnation reigns in them. And I'm not surprised that you're here this morning. And you live with condemnation. You can never tell me that condemnation makes you feel and have a sense, well, I just want to worship God. I just want to serve him. Condemnation doesn't do that. Condemnation drives you down. Drives you down. And I can tell you that Satan is filled with glee when he sees you under condemnation. And death is king. Condemnation which came by death which comes by this this uh foul enemy. Condemnation's a real thing. You c you cannot find manic depression in the Bible. But you can find condemnation in the Bible and all of these nice terms that they have. And they have uh medicinal uh you know uh the pharmacy the local pharmacy can give you something the local doctor can prescribe something for for this depression. I got a name for depression. The letter is still D and it's called the devil. &gt;&gt; It is the devil. The prophet says you may call it cancer. That's a name you give it. It is a devil. And I respect I respect with all my heart not just what a man was saying said brother Brandham said that to me he represented he represented and spoke a word that for my part is the end sign in the end time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And unless you are prepared to hold that end sign up I mean you you should be prepared. Even more so than the brave Marines on Ewaima. You should be more prepared whatever the cost and whatever it takes and whatever resource, whatever energy, I have a loyalty in my heart to this one who's I'm on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my allegiance goes to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if that's not in your heart, sir, &gt;&gt; it's a hypocrisy to say I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; We're not riding along on easy street just to be identified. I'm identified with Bible way. You can go straight to hell with that. &gt;&gt; People say I'm identified with Christianity. You can go straight to hell still with that on your lips. But when you say God has spoken, God has sent his word. God has confirmed his word. God has clearly identified that this is of him &gt;&gt; that he sent this. &gt;&gt; I say, who did this vindication? &gt;&gt; Who did this vindication &gt;&gt; in this message? Who vindicated this message? &gt;&gt; I wouldn't advise you to do this, but I have done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've sat with people that were antagonistic against the servant of God, against the prophet of God, against his ministry, against his message. And when I get right into that tight tight time, when they're so opposed to it, I say to them, and I have said it on occasion, but I don't recommend unless you've been fully led by the Holy Spirit to do so, but I felt I was led. And I said, "Well, then say that he was of the devil. Say that this message is of Satan." And they become silent. And I don't let them go. Brother Ernie, I said, "Say say it. I want you to say it. Go ahead and say it. Say this message is of the devil and say this ministry is of the devil and say that he was of the devil and their own silence condemns them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They may be very religious and they'll tangle and antagonistic against it, but they're afraid. &gt;&gt; But this prophet wasn't afraid to say, "Your denomination is of the devil. your denomination came from Rome. &gt;&gt; It was birthed at Naa and it's of the devil. &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to say what was of Satan. And I say today uh before this end sign that's been lifted up in this end time, this vindication was none other than God himself. &gt;&gt; That's why he said he's a mighty God unveiled. Not veiled, not hidden, unveiled. &gt;&gt; Why unveiled? So the people would be forced to look at it. &gt;&gt; This cross that hung on Mount Calvary on that rock pile called Gol Gotha. And he the prophet said that day the mercy seat which was always hidden in the in the holy of holies of the tabernacle. But this day God pulled the veil off &gt;&gt; and he hung there. He said the mercy seat was fully exposed. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they walked by. People who never were able to see the mercy seat &gt;&gt; walked by &gt;&gt; and looked on the mercy seat in full view &gt;&gt; and Bible says they wagged their heads. &gt;&gt; They thought it was such a failure. They thought it was such a a loss. He was a good man. He was a great teacher. What a shame. &gt;&gt; And there was God when they thought all they thought the whole system was collapsing. There was God taking off the veil and the seals &gt;&gt; and say it's in full view. &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's in full view. God's end sign was hanging on Calvary on another pole. Not Ewima, Mount Goltha. &gt;&gt; There came another mountain called Mount Sunset &gt;&gt; and a redeemed son, &gt;&gt; a saved, a born again, a redeemed son had come to maturity. Said, "Now the time has come. a sworn affidavit to the people. &gt;&gt; And a sworn affidavit is a legal document absolutely binding. Not by some attorney or not by your attorney or your lawyer, not by that, but by God himself. &gt;&gt; Says, "I bind myself to this word." And he descended with one foot upon the land and one foot that was amongst the people. &gt;&gt; The land and the sea identify the people. He came down amongst the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My goodness. And declared, "This is a legal binding document." &gt;&gt; And I have a servant on earth that's been proven and tested. And everything that he spoke has been true, true, true. &gt;&gt; This is the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; He is my ordained vessel, predestinated at the last messenger. And now I give to the people my binding document &gt;&gt; and I raise up for them &gt;&gt; the end sign &gt;&gt; once again &gt;&gt; and they still walk by sir &gt;&gt; wag their heads nice they're nice people kind of funny got some strange ideas but I like them they're nice. He was a good man. It's a nice message. But they have not the wherewithal to understand the legal document, the seals, &gt;&gt; unveiled, &gt;&gt; and the mercy seats in plain view for all to see. &gt;&gt; Not a flag on Euima. Not with a few thousand men laying dead around the cross. One man &gt;&gt; on the cross. One man. I say one man. &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our end sign stands before us today. &gt;&gt; To me, it's glorious. When you see this picture of the bleeding figure, something, oh my, their emotions get but my emotions just go screaming out. Oh, how glorious is that? How glorious is this scene? &gt;&gt; I don't even feel like I'm preaching to you this morning. I'm just having my own relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've taken put my arms around that cross for the one that hung there as my end sign in the end time. I'm identified with him. I'm represented with him with all of its shame and all of its glory. &gt;&gt; My end sign came out of the tomb. My end sign corruption couldn't take him. My end sign. This stone couldn't hold him. Hallelujah. My end sign. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pledge allegiance to him. Hallelujah. What about you young people? Is he worth your youth? Is he worth your strength? Is he worth your energy? Is he worth your beauty? Young ladies, what is he worth? He's worth it all. Is he worth your job? &gt;&gt; Is he worth your business? &gt;&gt; What's he worth? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's worth everything. &gt;&gt; These boys said it was worth everything. &gt;&gt; They said it's worth it. &gt;&gt; This rock pile is worth it. &gt;&gt; We're going to drag this flag up these several hundred feet. It's worth it. It is worth it. We couldn't do a lot for it because of our weakness of this flesh which came by attribution. I tell you in all honesty, if you would to ask me, brother Ed, is your flesh weak? Everybody's flesh is weak. Mine is weak. The prophet says his biggest biggest problem was himself. William Brandham, your biggest problem is yourself. &gt;&gt; And you got that by attribution. The flesh is weak. It was weak yesterday. It's weak today. It'll be weak tomorrow. Don't say, "I'll serve him when my flesh gets strong." That doesn't work. Let Let grace come to you by attribution. The free gift. The free gift. Say it. The free gift. Say it again. The free gift. &gt;&gt; He saw you bankrupt. He saw you as you have nothing. He said you can never do it. You can never live the life. You can never have it. I'm going to deposit it in your account. &gt;&gt; You can't earn it. You can't buy it. I'm going to deposit it in your account &gt;&gt; and I'm going to reckon. &gt;&gt; I'm going to impute to you righteousness &gt;&gt; and I will not impute your sin. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, is this kind of a loose arrangement of grace?" Not at all. &gt;&gt; Before that happens, you have to believe. &gt;&gt; When you believe, &gt;&gt; he does it. when you believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so simple. &gt;&gt; People make it so complicated, but it's so simple. &gt;&gt; We're having a baptismal tonight. The brother of baptizing, one of our native brothers from Canada. He spent about four years in the Marines, Terry Thomas. He's going to be baptized tonight. I'm sure when he saw the flag going up in Euima, something moved in his heart. That was a Marine. Brother Gary St. John was a Marine. Something moves in their heart when they see old glory raised up. But in this day, in this day, something moves in my heart. I see him raised up before the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that why you see the prophet, the prophet, I tell you what, he was so moved. He was so moved by his beauty when he saw him raised up. He saw the message being raised up. And I can see as it were his hands on that pole, raising it up so the raising up high on the hill so the people can see. The people can see far. It'll go far and wide. and he knew there'd be a company of people. I I I'm amazed sometime when he'd be speaking to just a handful of people and he said, "These tapes go to the jungles. These tapes go around the world." &gt;&gt; He saw there would be people that would come and they would be gathered. &gt;&gt; When I saw those flags go by on the screen and as the brothers were putting it together and I was going over them and saying, "Don't forget this country. Don't forget that country. and we see our flag go up there. Some may feel a sense I I need to, you know, I need to salute. I need to stand. I need to put my hand up across my heart. But I am raising up for you today an end sign. The one that was on Calvary, but the one that is here now, the one that's been raised up in this end time. And I trust that he becomes so visible to you in word form that you say, "I give my all. I give my all. I believe it with all my heart. I don't understand it, but I believe it with everything in me. &gt;&gt; And the life, the life from that end sign, either I'm a liar or this is the truth of God's word. The life from that end sign will come into you and dwell in you and make you make you one with it. We can stand before a flag and say what it is. I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with everything. I'm identified with it shame. I'm identified with this glory. I was there at the Boston Tea Party. I was there with George Washington. I was there. And yet it all has to be imagined. &gt;&gt; But this identification doesn't have to be imagined. This identification is a reality. &gt;&gt; This identification is the same spirit &gt;&gt; that was in him comes into you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; We are one &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; And God is dealing with you and speaking to you. I would take about one tenth of one second to respond to it. I wouldn't I wouldn't wait and say, "Well, I'm drafted and I'm pulled and I'm trained before I come up to my this mountain." I would say, "No, I'm going to come. I give my life. I surrender all that I am to him right now." &gt;&gt; And he will pass upon you, &gt;&gt; not death, but his righteousness. all of his righteousness. &gt;&gt; You didn't get half of Adam's transgression &gt;&gt; in this flesh. You didn't get half of the penalty. You're not half dying. You are dying. Not long after you're born, you start to die. And if times should go on, we all perhaps from different countries, different cultures, different backgrounds, we'll all find common ground. And it's on a slab in a mortuary or someplace. I can tell you friends, for the believer, that's why you're here. &gt;&gt; I will not be in that slab, and neither will you. By God's grace, by a gift, by the free gift, I will be another place. I will be I'll be watching them say like brother uh our brother brother Mark and brother Ricard's grandfather who passed away in a hospital after an operation and I sat with him while he told me what took place and how after his the nurse said to the wife sister uh just forget her name just now but he said to her Brother Duply, brother Con, Brother Dupy, he said to her, "Go, go, go, go. You need to go." And she was working with the tubes in his throat and one of the tubes had come against a part of his body and he wasn't able to get any air and he died right there. He wasn't dead for a few moments. He was dead for between 12 and 15 minutes. So the brain is completely gone. While his wife stood on the other side of the bed, he watched the tears form in her eyes, described it to the letter. And the nurse, he saw the nurse working with the tubes in his throat. And he stood there. He said about the height of the door. And he watched her. And he thought, if this is death, this is nothing to be afraid of. If this is death, wonderful brother, wonderful, one of the most lovely believers I have ever met, trustee in brother Ratif's church. And says, and and when he got to a certain point, he said he couldn't know anymore. He said to his wife, "You you know, you have to fill in your part." And when the nurse says, "You leave now. You must leave." She stepped out into the passageway of the hospital and one of her two daughters, one of the mothers, either Rickart's or or Marco's mother, was in the hall and said, "Come quick. Daddy's leaving us." And she had written, I think, on her hand the number of the doctor's cell phone or automobile phone's mobile phone. And she went quickly to the pay phone and called the doctor and said said uh duplic duply emergency duplic operation emergency and he's on the freeway already has left the hospital he's miles away on the freeway and at that moment friends nothing s nothing happens by accident at that moment the other attending physician was going on the freeway and he motioned to him like this to go back go back And they both turned around and came back. Brother Duplo saw the doctor get out of his car and he even had some difficulty with the car getting out or whatever it was or or locking it or something. He described the whole scene. He's in a brick building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the body I want. &gt;&gt; Described the whole thing. And the doctor comes running down the passageway. And while he's running, he's throwing his coat off. And the nurse is standing going like this. Don't don't don't hurry yourself. Don't bother yourself. He's already gone. And the next thing Brother Dupy knows, he just comes to Sister Dupy is patting his cheek, saying, "Lovey, lovey, lovey." Patting his cheek like that, and he just comes alive. He says, he says to me after that, he says, Brother Ed. Brother Eddie. He calls me Brother Eddie. He says, "I'm better now. I feel like I'm 21 again." &gt;&gt; And he still lives tonight. &gt;&gt; What a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet went beyond the curtain of time said in one place said, "I saw you all there." &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope he saw me. &gt;&gt; Saw millions of people. &gt;&gt; Is this a fairy tale? This is reality. &gt;&gt; And if it's not it, we're living a fairy tale down here. This is a passing human parade. &gt;&gt; Do you like what you see? &gt;&gt; Do you like what you see on the street &gt;&gt; in a sad place? Trouble everywhere. And I won't measure on that. I'm done. I'm done preaching. But there is a land. There's a land &gt;&gt; and my my end sign represents that land. &gt;&gt; My end sign, the life of my end sign represents everything that my soul cries for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We love everything he represents. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm proud. I'm happy to be identified with its failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the world considers a failure. What the world considers a shame, they think it's a shame. &gt;&gt; Many in the world think that you sisters are so oppressed. &gt;&gt; I glory in it. &gt;&gt; They think our men are so deprived. I glory in it. &gt;&gt; So, oh, you have such talent and you have such this and you could do this and you could do that. We're not interested in it. We're not interested in that. We're not interested in the biggest church. We're not interested in that stuff. We're interested in what the kingdom. Well, what's right for the kingdom? What's right for my country? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Am I just using up a bunch of energy today or is this touching your soul? &gt;&gt; I close with this. It's not a flag. It's a life, &gt;&gt; not a flag. And let us not have men and women who've devoted their lives to fight for their country put you and I to shame with the allegiance that they have for a country that is passing off the scene. And you and I that are sitting here, let us not be put to shame by men and women who belong to some denomination or some organization and they will just serve that thing just night and day. I urge you with all that's in me. Give your best &gt;&gt; to this kingdom, to this end sign that is raised up in this end time. And I'll close with this. In 1962 in Phoenix, I believe it was, Brother Brandon preached an end sign and he just what the end sign was and what it is today and who it is. He preached on the end sign. He says, "I've lifted up before you." And he calls the people to prove that that was our end sign. And he tells one after the other after the other after the other the supernatural truth of vindication so that we could sit here today and say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; how wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; It's without error, &gt;&gt; without a mistake. &gt;&gt; It's truth." &gt;&gt; My end sign. &gt;&gt; I don't care which flag came up today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care which flag you're represented with. There isn't a man or woman in the right mind that can stand up and say my flag represents truth. &gt;&gt; It doesn't &gt;&gt; the you can put the best men the best women in the government but the there's a system will corrupt them. Even the prophet said that even men that go into the priesthood or a nun that goes to be a nun and cloister themselves, he said they don't go there to be bad people. They go there to be good people. But the system corrupts them. &gt;&gt; Politics corrupt the people. Politics in the church corrupts people. We're not interested in politics. We're interested in truth. But I can point to my end sign. My Christ is lifted up. I can say he is truth, all truth. There's no error in him. There's no weakness in him. There's no frailty in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He deserves &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; your all. &gt;&gt; Your all. And I would urge you today &gt;&gt; to give him your all. &gt;&gt; And don't hesitate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give him your all. I wonder if we could stand and sing. I pledge allegiance to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll be able to sing it different. [Music] If you know the words, you may want to just close your eyes. And if you can't sing it, you may want to come here and we'll pray with you till you can sing it. Dear friends, my brothers and sisters, [Music] is a serious moment. You know as well as I know you're passing from this scene. We're just crossing the little stage of life. [Music] And when you take your last breath, I want to ask what then? It's a songwriter. What then? Where will you be? What will it be then? Whatever you do, don't leave this service. be disappointment to me if you leave this service and say really spoke deep to me really spoke deep but I for one reason or another I just couldn't make that step I couldn't make that move I couldn't make that consecration what about tomorrow you don't know about tomorrow anyway leave it in God's hands this is now right here now I pledge allegiance to the lamb not the flag of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray now the Holy Spirit come and take over in this meeting. Do all manner of marvelous victories amongst us. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. We've so rejoiced in what you have done in the recent year year that we've just passed through. But now we're looking for greater victories, oh God. even greater victories. Come, oh Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brood upon this congregation. Let every man and woman that believes this word pray with me. Brood upon this congregation, Lord. Brood upon our hearts. Move us, Father. Move the enemy out of the camp.

In the name of my Lord Jesus, I pledge alrenor [Music] is our [Music] course once again [Music] with all my strength. With all I am, I will sing to his command. [Music] Before we sing it, just once again, and while we sing it, I want you to take Take inventory, a mental inventory of your life, where you're at at this moment. We're starting a new year. Will it be just a repeat of last year? Or will it be different? Will it be different? You might say, "Well, I don't have the strength." That's not what I'm asking you. I don't have the ability. That's not what I'm asking you. I'm asking you, are you willing? &gt;&gt; Are you just willing? Are you just willing? Are you willing? Is this congregation willing? &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. I pledge &gt;&gt; al [Music] with all my strength with all I am. I will seek to honor his command. I [Music] &gt;&gt; first I have heard how long were [Music] They were told that we would spend their lives. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, but one by one to the son of God. They will not [Music] I can there [Music] we All my strength and all I will see to his command. I pledge to and the years have come and the years have gone. [Music] &gt;&gt; It still goes on now. The time has come to &gt;&gt; the cost to reject. &gt;&gt; We'll make it more than a song, Lord. &gt;&gt; The cost. &gt;&gt; Let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life. Good sound. Let us proudly stand and sing. [Applause] Alance to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will see to all his command. I pledge allegiance to the lamb to the lamb of God. to the lamb of God. Who bore my pain? Who took my place? You my shamb. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to sing that verse again. And when we come to who bore my pain, a lot more than our pain he bore. He bore our stain. I was stained. I was marked. You were marked by the transgression of Adam. It passed upon you. And death passed upon you. And time shall go on. My words will be proven true. There'll be more services take place in this church perhaps. with a wooden box here. If it so happens I have to go the way of death and you see my casket here, I want to make this declaration before that happens. I want to go down in a blaze of fire. &gt;&gt; I want to go down and someone that if I see these boys on Ewima, I see Christ on Calvary and he just demands everything. He demands my all. Everything you can do, everything you can be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does he not? &gt;&gt; Am I alone? No, I'm not alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know that God is &gt;&gt; gripping your heart. How many are resolved? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I'm resolved. Want to see you young people raise your hand. I'm resolved. Want to see right here at the front. Want to see you young people doing everything that you can. &gt;&gt; Your spirit, your whole will, &gt;&gt; your whole mind, your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. I call this church to dedication. Dedicate yourself &gt;&gt; body, soul, and spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; To the lamb of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Your place. and my shame. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're saved. &gt;&gt; I will seek to seek, &gt;&gt; seek to obey. Just come out. [Music] &gt;&gt; To the lamb. Once again to the lamb of God who my face and my shame I will sing to his [Music] to the &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God of Moses, Elijah, the prophets, God of the apostles, and of the messengers, God that stood in attendance continually with our prophet, messenger, our precious brother Brandham. And you are the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. You brought him forth. He was conceived in the womb of a woman, Mary, a virgin. And from there, he took a body of this earth, the same dust that we are in. And the word was in him, and he was the word. [Music] &gt;&gt; He lifted up and reclaimed this earth as his own possession. and was raised up high. We can say today, high and lifted up, &gt;&gt; higher than Goltha, &gt;&gt; higher than the heavens, higher than the angels to the right hand of the majesty on high. You are raised up. And we see we see the end sign. We see the banner, our standard. And oh God, not a prayer but my very soul rising up within me. Say we we we are we pledge our allegiance &gt;&gt; to this end sign, this lamb of God, this sacrifice that bore our stain. And now send forth your Holy Spirit. And I ask that it shall continue with the people. Surround them, permeate them, &gt;&gt; and do not allow these words to escape their minds. &gt;&gt; Seal it in the womb of their minds. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let every life be holy, fully surrendered, so much in oneness and unity until you just come, oh Lord, and you'll be so pleased to be in attendance. Come tonight, oh God, as our brother Lance comes and as he opens up the scriptures, I pray, Father, it'll be such an illumination. Come and fellowship with us. &gt;&gt; We want to walk in this Eden, not Satan's Eden, but this Eden that you have made for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have fellowship with you. Father, I commend this word and the burden of the word of the Lord which was in my heart today and delivered by the Holy Spirit to the people and now it's the Lord Jesus on their hands. May they ponder deeply these things. And I pray that in the coming days and even beginning today, there will be dramatic changes that will take place by the power of the Holy Ghost. Let all manner of glorious things take place. May the sick be healed. &gt;&gt; May the demonp possessed be free. &gt;&gt; May Satan be rebuked even now. The Lord rebuke you, Satan. You cannot hold God's property. Whether it be present in this building or elsewhere, you cannot hold it. For we, oh God, are your servants. We, oh God, are your ministers on earth. I pray that even now, Father, you'll bring the bring those that are in bondage and set them free that they may be here in the house of God, rejoicing in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. &gt;&gt; Let this word be anchored and lodged in our hearts. Lord, as we depart this place, I pray we will do so with all somnity. [Music] &gt;&gt; I commit this congregation to you. In the beloved name of our Lord Jesus Christ, our end sign, lifted up, our wave chief waving over us, &gt;&gt; we give ourselves to you. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. Bless your people in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to dismiss you without any further words. you obey the Lord. Have the kind of afternoon that would be pleasing to him. Don't let these things slip out of your mind and out of your thoughts, but I would encourage you to ponder them and let them have an effect upon you. God bless you. You're dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] I want to mention also that next Sunday evening is the Lord's table. We have communion foot washing next Sunday. God bless you. [Music] Heat.
