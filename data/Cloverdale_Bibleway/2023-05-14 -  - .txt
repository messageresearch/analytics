TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but for me it means we're holding each other accountable [Music] sort of fidelo stands for always faithful to the Core and every turn to your back on it [Music] what is somebody you can rely on like one time they're going to get tough you know that there's going to be someone there to back you up and it's going to be your fellow Marine that's on your left or your right so we're always faithful we're always there with each other we'll always be fighting for each other if we have nothing else left at the end of the day me that is just a level of commitment unlike any other and I will never be a part of anything else [Music] I think it speaks volumes of character of Queen's past present usually thinking about what culture of ourselves always faithful to each other to our country for families [Music] foreign hey I'm not even American I'm proud of them soldiers but they don't have an eternal Bond like you and I have I'm sorry they might carry the motto Semper Fidelis hmm but I said no way I was studying halfway through I had a totally different title and I came across that he said um that's my title that's exactly what my motto is always faithful always loyal that's what it means I'm sorry but at least one lady said I'll never be involved if something is bigger than this sorry there is something bigger that's called a battle for life and death and there's an army that's raging against the enemy and I'm part of that big army [Applause] I'd take semper fidelis my way you know what they say about that it damage to demonstrate that in Practical terms new recruits are told story after story of how Marine sacrificed in combat to remain faithful to their fellow Warriors and so they're constantly telling each other of a warrior I've gone by they're telling each other of a shamgar they're telling each other assumption they're telling each other of a David of people gone by saying you know them December Philadelphia you know that person except for Phil Dallas you know any biscoll stiffer for Dallas look to each other and you say hey Stanford from Dallas putting their lives at risk to save all the Marines refusing to leave one of their own behind alive or dead that's this Earth but not dead in this light in eternity because this semper fidelis this army goes through a prayer meeting on a Monday night and they're praying for those that are wounded those that are somewhere left into battle and they're saying ah nah devil we're fighting we're going to be going to Warfare we're going to be telling each other except for Dallas oh he's faithful we can talk about Peter and Noah different ones who risk their life think about John the Baptist they would have been telling each other do you know what he did he put his life on the line he was preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ they cut off his head Semper Fidelis faithful loyal families moving here and there trying to uproot their families to grow and go maybe go to church many of you moved in here so your children could be in a school you're sacrificing your livelihoods you're sacrificing your ease why you're faithful to the cause you're faithful to the words that need whatever I can for my children Semper Fidelis story after Story encouraging each other in the faithful gone by and the faithful that are present you know what the rest says it says in many of the stories one one Marine made a conscious decision to die in order to save the lives of others and so they tell the story this one died and it would start to well up something some comrade ship loyal to the Core and this commitment to semper fidelis was one of the reasons Marines enjoy the well-deserved reputation for Valor in combat because they encourage each other telling each other of different counts because they go to like I said and they gather together they edify but I said let me tell you of a story of all time of one that gave his life on a cross for you and I it is a no Marine which I respect but the king of glory came down to a stable to save Mankind and give salvation for all oh that's them for Fidelity that's always faithful I will sing of my redeemer and its precious love for me on a cool crossy suburb pain that dead and made me free single thing that's what I'll say to the next one that builds up Valor in combat amen that's why things say Leave No Man Behind comes into play here with the Marines it's burned into their being it becomes part of really who they are far be it from an Earthly Army Corps to have more Valor more loyalty more comrade Chef more faithfulness than the armies of the Living God that's why each one of us young old middle-aged teenage walking down the hallway at school he said how you doing Sandra Fidelis faithful loyal or are you just pretending we don't need feigned loyalty now feign loyalty because what happens there after a time I don't have time to get into it that that manifests itself so if you need loyalty you need to Pledge of Allegiance not to No Flag but to the word [Music] maybe it's in your bedroom he said Lord I need that except for Fidelis eternal what a great example we had John 15 greater love hath no man in this that a man laid down in his life for his friends
