[0:02] Help me find you.
[0:07] How I need your touch.
[0:14] Oh, find my dryen
[0:20] places
[0:23] thirsty for your love.
[0:29] When Lord forgive me
[0:33] if I wander
[0:38] so far
[0:43] away from you.
[0:47] Oh, you are all I
[0:52] have ever wanted.
[0:55] Oh, come and make me new. Oh, as a
[1:00] prayer now, pour your spirit out, Lord.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, fall
[1:09] just like the rain.
[1:13] Saturate
[1:15] my thirsty soul.
[1:19] Come and fall aresh on me.
[1:23] Lord, fill my cup again.
[1:29] Heal my heart
[1:32] and make me whole.
[1:36] I need you. I need
[1:40] you now.
[1:42] For your spirit.
[1:46] For your spirit.
[1:48] For your spirit.
[1:51] My gra.
[2:00] My thirsty soul.
[2:04] Come and walk on me.
[2:08] Lord fill my cup again.
[2:12] Heal my heart.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Heal my heart. Oh, and make me
[2:20] how I need you, Lord.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; I need I need you now.
[2:26] Pour your
[2:32] hallelujah. I know that's the prayer of
[2:34] every person here this evening. Amen.
[2:36] Want to greet you this evening in the
[2:38] name of our precious Lord and Savior
[2:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:41] You having a good camp? It's been
[2:42] wonderful. How many were blessed by this
[2:44] morning service able to be here? I was
[2:46] just wonderful. The atmosphere was just
[2:48] just a supernatural experience and I was
[2:51] so blessed to be a part of it. And as he
[2:54] was winding up the service, it just
[2:55] began to go through my mind. It's like I
[2:57] am so tired of walking around packing
[3:00] broken chains. It's like we're not a
[3:02] chained people. So why do we walk around
[3:04] like we are and live beneath our
[3:06] inheritance? say, "I don't want to do
[3:08] that anymore, and I don't have to do
[3:09] that anymore." I trust you identify with
[3:11] that. So, I thought we should open this
[3:13] evening with Broken Chains. We can sing
[3:15] the chorus together. You may bend, but
[3:17] you won't ever break. Hallelujah. And
[3:19] when Brother Brandham talks about those
[3:21] trees that were just flexible as the
[3:22] wind blew. Amen. Nothing's going to take
[3:25] you down, saints. Hallelujah. Let's sing
[3:27] this together now in victory and we
[3:29] won't be bound by broken chains. Amen.
[3:32] We'll just sing the chorus.
[3:34] Oh, you may
[3:39] but you won't pray
[3:43] and you may stumble
[3:47] and even feel you lost away but you
[3:51] won't fall.
[3:58] You won't be
[4:02] my
[4:06] you.
[4:19] to pray
[4:22] and you may sound
[4:28] lost away but you won't
[4:39] be
[4:42] My
[4:47] bound
[4:51] I may bend but I won't break. Oh and I
[4:54] may
[4:56] open confess it now but I won't break. I
[5:01] may stumble. I may stumble.
[5:07] Jesus.
[5:10] Hallelujah. God's word remains. God's
[5:14] word
[5:15] remains. I won't be bound.
[5:19] Oh, praise his name, saints. My broken
[5:23] chain. I can't be bound. I can't be
[5:26] bound.
[5:29] My Lord. Sing that once more. I revenge.
[5:33] Oh yeah,
[5:37] but I won't break
[5:41] and I may stumble.
[5:45] Oh, and even
[5:47] I've lost my way, but I won't fall.
[5:52] Thank you, Lord.
[5:54] I know.
[5:57] I won't be bound.
[6:01] My ro in change.
[6:05] I can be bound.
[6:09] How can we sing that once more? I'm
[6:13] Yes, I'm
[6:17] but I won't.
[6:21] Yes, I may stumble.
[6:25] Oh, and even
[6:27] I've lost my way. that I won't
[6:33] God's word
[6:35] remains.
[6:37] I won't be bound. Hallelujah. I won't be
[6:40] bound.
[6:42] Oh, sing. I can't be bound. I can't be
[6:46] bound.
[6:49] My broken
[6:50] chains.
[6:53] Hallelujah. You believe that this
[6:55] evening? Hallelujah. I will not fall.
[6:59] Glory to God. He's already finished the
[7:02] work sense. It's not about you anymore.
[7:04] It's about what God has done for you
[7:06] already. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed
[7:10] be the name of the Lord.
[7:12] Amen. I'm going to throw a little
[7:14] surprise at our musicians here, but I
[7:15] want to sing Arise, possess your
[7:17] inheritance.
[7:18] Hallelujah. We're going to sing it with
[7:20] the verses, too. So, I scratched out
[7:21] some chords that I hope will help you,
[7:22] Brother Ben.
[7:26] Amen. And let's go ahead and start with
[7:27] the first verse. Entangled
[7:30] with heavy chains of captivity.
[7:35] Oh, entangled
[7:38] by heavy chains of captivity.
[7:43] I was bruised,
[7:46] battered by sin.
[7:50] Yes, I was condemned
[7:53] and sentenced to a life of bondage.
[7:58] Oh God, there was no peace within. Oh,
[8:03] but then a sound was heard. Hallelujah.
[8:07] But then a sound was heard. It was like
[8:11] the abundance of rain. Sing rejoice.
[8:16] You have received his own.
[8:20] Oh, he said the parting word
[8:26] for life for you because you're not
[8:31] woman.
[8:39] possess your
[8:44] glor
[8:47] of
[8:53] not
[8:58] understand the liberty by which Christ
[9:02] said to you, "Oh, aren't you tired of
[9:04] living under privilege? Aren't you tired
[9:08] of living under privilege?"
[9:13] Oh, saints, don't you?
[9:16] Don't you hear?
[9:21] Bring freedom to the captives.
[9:25] Restoration
[9:27] to the blind.

[9:40] fill them with Lord. You are free. You
[9:45] are free. You are free. Oh, I love this.

[10:45] that I am free.
[10:48] Comfort

[10:52] tubing.
[10:54] Yes, there's freedom for all burdens
[10:59] and say, "Hey, my comforter
[11:03] has given me."
[11:06] Oh, peace within. And the sun is set
[11:09] free. The sunrise

[16:14] again, tomorrow morning, if you're not
[16:15] prepared this evening, we will take up
[16:17] an offering tomorrow morning. And maybe
[16:19] if the deacon brothers could just come
[16:21] at this time and we'll prepare for the
[16:23] offering. And I just want to sing so
[16:25] glad I'm yours. Just simple little song
[16:28] that I grew up with that I just love
[16:29] every time cuz I nothing ever changes
[16:31] fact that I'm just so glad I belong to
[16:34] the Lord Jesus. Aren't you so thankful
[16:36] for that? As we prepare to go to prayer,
[16:38] maybe we could just sing that chorus
[16:39] together.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours, Lord. Maybe you could
[16:47] just worship him as we go to prayer.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad your

[17:02] has
[17:03] me. I'm so glad

[18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; How many have enjoyed the camp?
[18:12] &gt;&gt; We still have two services left. and
[18:14] we're thankful for everything that the
[18:16] Lord has done for us thus far. And if
[18:18] that was all that we got, we would be
[18:20] extremely blessed.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; But we want to enter in with everything
[18:24] that we have. And tonight's offering is
[18:25] going for the expenses that are above
[18:28] and beyond what your fees pay for. Those
[18:30] of you that are on the grounds or those
[18:32] of you that are off the grounds, it
[18:34] gives you an opportunity to participate
[18:37] in worship through our giving. So, it
[18:39] goes towards expenses and also for a
[18:42] love offering for the speakers. And
[18:44] let's just ask God to bless the offering
[18:46] and to bless this service tonight. If
[18:48] you have a need, why don't you why don't
[18:50] you just say, "Lord, I've enjoyed so
[18:52] far, but I want more from you."
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just signify to that to
[18:56] him tonight? Wonderful,
[18:59] &gt;&gt; blessed redeemer.
[19:02] Oh Lord, how humbled we are that the
[19:05] great and mighty God,
[19:08] the creator of all things, the very
[19:11] author of life has chosen to come here
[19:14] on the backside of the mountain as it
[19:17] were and to meet with us, Lord, to
[19:20] gather together with us as you said that
[19:22] you would be wherever two or three of us
[19:25] would be gathered in your name. But
[19:27] Lord, it's been a special experience
[19:30] this weekend. We thank you for the
[19:33] ministry. We thank you for the word. It
[19:36] has been anointed and it has touched our
[19:39] hearts and it has blessed us, oh God.
[19:42] And we're desiring once again tonight
[19:44] that you'll pour out your spirit in a
[19:47] fresh way upon us, Lord. We don't want
[19:50] to put any limitations on you, Lord. We
[19:53] want you to have the preeminence. We
[19:55] want you, Lord, to have the liberty. We
[19:58] want you to take complete control over
[20:00] every part of this service. Oh God, take
[20:03] brother Ron into your hands once again.
[20:06] Anoint him aresh for our sakes, Lord.
[20:09] You know everyone individually
[20:12] what we have need of, Father. And we
[20:14] commit ourselves to you. We commit our
[20:16] needs to you. There might be one person
[20:19] here tonight that maybe this is their
[20:21] first service and they say, "I need a
[20:23] touch from you, Lord." We know you're
[20:25] here to touch them, Father, as they lift
[20:27] up their heart to you. And we give
[20:30] ourselves unreservedly. You know the
[20:32] needs both here out over the internet,
[20:34] Lord, wherever it might be. Lord, may
[20:37] you come to each one individually. And
[20:39] Father, we want to lift up this offering
[20:41] to you. Lord, you know the needs that
[20:44] are here, financial needs. We pray that
[20:47] you take what we're able to give. We
[20:49] give it as worship unto you. And we ask,
[20:52] Lord, that you'll bless it and multiply
[20:54] it. And Lord, may you bless the giver
[20:56] also. We commit this service and this
[20:59] offering into your hands in the
[21:01] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:04] Amen.
[21:08] Amen. Maybe we can just sing that a
[21:09] couple more times as you have your seats
[21:11] and we take up the offering. So glad I'm
[21:15] yours,
[21:16] Lord.
[21:18] So glad I'm yours.
[21:24] So glad your mercy
[21:29] has followed me.
[21:34] I'm so glad you found me
[21:40] and you set me free.
[21:45] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[21:50] So glad I'm just once more. So glad I'm
[21:54] yours. So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[22:00] So glad I'm yours.
[22:06] So glad your mercy
[22:11] has followed me.
[22:16] So glad you found me
[22:21] and you set me free.
[22:26] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[22:31] So glad I'm yours.
[22:35] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to invite
[22:37] Sister Margaret in your cabin to come if
[22:39] you'd like to come just right at this
[22:40] time and get ready. Uh we do have one
[22:43] announcement that they just wanted us to
[22:45] make for tomorrow morning. It's our last
[22:47] morning of camp, but it's been a
[22:49] wonderful week and it's just been
[22:51] requested that those who are staying in
[22:53] the cabins, campers and non-ampers, you
[22:56] please have your rooms cleaned up and
[22:58] the trash taken out before you come to
[23:00] service in the morning. So, you have
[23:01] time between breakfast and service uh to
[23:04] clean up your cabin and uh just to have
[23:07] that done. It ends up lingering quite a
[23:09] bit into the afternoon and then some of
[23:10] us counselors end up being here till
[23:12] 4:00 cleaning cabins. So, we don't like
[23:14] to not do that. But uh we just
[23:16] appreciate your help with this and I
[23:18] just encourage you to express your
[23:20] appreciation. How many enjoyed the
[23:21] activity today? That was quite the quite
[23:23] the activity to put together. But I
[23:26] heard nothing but good things. And it's
[23:27] okay to express your appreciation to the
[23:29] ones who put that on and tell them how
[23:30] much you appreciated it. Amen.
[23:35] Everyone by now knows who brother
[23:38] Michael is, Sister Abigail. Just, you
[23:40] know, shake their hand, give them a hug,
[23:41] and tell them how much you appreciate
[23:42] the labors and all those who have
[23:43] worked. Amen. And it's a labor of love
[23:45] for you because they want to see you in
[23:47] an atmosphere where God can do something
[23:48] for you. And so we certainly appreciate
[23:50] them and each one that's given over
[23:52] these last days. Amen. God bless you.
[23:54] Sister Margaret,
[23:56] &gt;&gt; the girls said they they said that
[23:58] they'd like to sing a special and um I
[24:01] was sitting there after service last
[24:04] night and this song came on my heart and
[24:06] I was I said, "Lord, is did you want me
[24:08] to sing that song? Is it you?" And then
[24:10] when I went in my cabin, I walked in the
[24:12] door, Chenet was singing that song. So I
[24:15] thought I'd sing it. We'd sing it
[24:17] tonight.
[24:36] Touch your people once again.
[24:42] With your precious holy hand
[24:47] we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon
[24:53] this earth

[30:41] families would come, but make your way
[30:43] on up and just sing. There is none like
[30:44] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[30:46] you do as they come and prepare for us.
[30:50] Lord, there is none like you.
[31:00] No one else can touch my heart like you
[31:04] do.
[31:08] And I could search for all eternity,
[31:13] Lord,
[31:14] and find
[31:16] there is none like
[31:20] sing it once more. There's none like
[31:22] you, Lord.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, there is none.
[31:28] No one like you, Lord Jesus.
[31:33] No one else can touch my heart like you
[31:39] do.
[31:41] I can search for all eternity,
[31:46] Lord,
[31:47] and find
[31:49] there is none like you.
[32:34] I believe your love
[32:38] is faithful
[32:41] when all my hopes
[32:44] have crumbled.
[32:47] It is standing strong and aable
[32:54] when everything
[32:57] else fails.
[33:00] I believe your love
[33:04] will cover me through every storm.
[33:12] I am persuaded.
[33:19] Nothing in life,
[33:22] nothing in death,
[33:25] no mountain high,
[33:28] no ocean death, no power below
[33:34] on earth or above
[33:39] can separate me from your love.
[33:48] I believe beyond
[33:51] the shadow.
[33:55] You never will
[33:58] forsake
[33:59] me and your love endures
[34:04] forever.
[34:07] When all my strength is gone,
[34:13] I believe your love
[34:16] will carry me and hold me close.
[34:25] I am persuaded.
[34:31] Nothing in life,
[34:34] nothing in death,
[34:37] no mountain high,
[34:40] no ocean death, no power below
[34:46] on earth or above
[34:50] can separate me from your love.
[34:55] Nothing in life,
[34:58] nothing in death,
[35:01] no mountain height,
[35:04] no ocean death, no power below
[35:10] on earth or above
[35:14] can separate me from your love.
[35:19] Nothing in life,
[35:22] nothing in death,
[35:25] no mountain in height,
[35:28] no ocean death, no power below
[35:34] on earth or above
[35:38] can separate me from your love.
[35:44] been separate. We found your love.
[36:02] Amen. God bless you all. Nice to be here
[36:05] tonight.
[36:06] Amen. It's wonderful to see the young
[36:09] people participate. Tremendous. We thank
[36:13] the Edmonton young people for being a
[36:16] part of camp. God bless you for coming
[36:18] all this way and blessing us and each
[36:20] and every one of you that have come from
[36:22] various parts of the world to be here.
[36:26] It's been a special camp.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; It's been a supernatural camp
[36:30] &gt;&gt; and I believe that God is going to do
[36:32] something very supernatural again
[36:34] tonight. My expectation is so high.
[36:39] Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; I trust your expectation is so high
[36:43] &gt;&gt; that God is going to come in this tent
[36:46] and God is going to visit us in a very
[36:48] supernatural way. And I'm crying in my
[36:51] own heart, Lord, one more time, let the
[36:54] angel of the Lord himself come and visit
[36:57] his people and come and meet with us in
[36:59] a supernatural
[37:02] time such as this. Before I make any
[37:06] further remarks, I must make this
[37:08] announcement that tomorrow for the and
[37:10] we want to greet the saints at
[37:13] Cloverdale Bible Way and all that are
[37:16] streaming with us this evening. We have
[37:18] a number of our people that can't make
[37:21] it across because of certain documents
[37:23] they haven't obtained as yet. They will
[37:25] be gathering tomorrow morning at the
[37:28] church at 10:00. Brother Tim Dodd is
[37:31] going to sacrifice his presence here and
[37:33] he will be there at the church. Brother
[37:35] Joe Waldner will be a a faithful deacon
[37:38] and he will be there at the church. And
[37:41] I I trust and I know that God is no
[37:49] respector of places.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; I believe he's here right now. Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And young people, if you've ever pulled
[37:58] in your life tonight, I know tonight is
[38:01] a night to be
[38:05] &gt;&gt; I have been looking to the Lord myself.
[38:08] You know, not that we're anything, but
[38:11] we know that when God brings certain
[38:12] vessels here, that is for a reason and
[38:15] for a time.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And I believe
[38:20] the word is going to come in power. I
[38:23] believe the Holy Spirit is going to come
[38:25] and confirm it. And I believe that God
[38:28] is going to do the impossible.
[38:30] You might as well start speaking it. And
[38:33] you might as well start believing it.
[38:35] Don't dis, you know, settle back on it.
[38:37] Say, "Amen. This is what we believe.
[38:40] This is what we believe." I'm going to
[38:43] say something tonight. I have not said
[38:47] until just yesterday.
[38:52] For those that were at the 2007
[38:55] convention,
[38:58] Brother Ron Spencer was preaching at the
[39:01] pulpit and ministering the word of God.
[39:07] And I just said to the Lord,
[39:11] I said, 'Lord,
[39:13] is that same angel that was with the
[39:15] prophet,
[39:17] is it standing right there? And the Holy
[39:21] Spirit moved on me. I I didn't even know
[39:23] what happened in that service.
[39:26] I felt I was identifying the presence of
[39:29] God with his servant and God was
[39:32] confirming it within my heart. and
[39:36] tonight and today this afternoon I just
[39:38] went to my room and I I thought I
[39:41] haven't said that before and
[39:45] then I was just playing a tape on
[39:47] experiences and then I listened to a
[39:50] prayer line and brother Bram said that
[39:53] angel of the Lord is standing right here
[39:55] tonight and he said not only tonight is
[39:58] he going to stand here he said it'll be
[40:00] tonight and for the next generations to
[40:03] come and I said that's this generation
[40:06] I said that's tonight. God, come to the
[40:09] word and confirm it with signs
[40:12] following. And whatever God has laid on
[40:15] brother Ron Spencer's heart, I say, "Oh,
[40:18] Holy Spirit, we welcome you in this
[40:21] tent." And whatever your need is, I
[40:23] believe God is going to meet that need
[40:25] through the vessel of God that God has
[40:28] called to be here tonight. And don't sit
[40:30] there looking at me. You say, "Lord
[40:32] Jesus, Lord Jesus, minister to me. Let
[40:37] the Holy Ghost himself
[40:40] come and meet
[40:43] my individual need." We're going to,
[40:46] Lord willing, have a prayer line
[40:48] tonight.
[40:50] So, I want you to tuck something in your
[40:51] heart and say, "I believe.
[40:54] I believe, Holy Spirit." Whatever your
[40:59] heart's desire is tonight, God is going
[41:03] to grant it. So, I want you to be
[41:06] prepared. I'm prepared. Brother Ron
[41:09] Spencer has laid himself aside. I said,
[41:12] "Lord, use the man of God. Use the
[41:16] brothers as we will be in a prayer line
[41:19] praying with you, believing for the
[41:22] supernatural." He's a supernatural God.
[41:26] So, as we welcome our precious brother
[41:28] Ron Spencer who has come to be with us
[41:31] and if you haven't given an offering,
[41:33] the offering table's over there. Be sure
[41:36] saints of God, we want to bless the man
[41:39] of God and their labors. Brother David
[41:42] Mayor, God bless him. He'll be flying
[41:45] out tomorrow morning and won't be here
[41:47] for tomorrow. But we will we'll send a
[41:50] good report of what God is going to cap
[41:53] this me these meetings off. So why don't
[41:56] you stand with me? Are you believing?
[42:00] Are you believing?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Are you expecting?
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Say, I'm expecting, Brother Tom. I'm
[42:08] expecting the unexpected.
[42:11] Amen. Welcome, Holy Spirit. We are in
[42:15] your presence as we welcome brother Ron
[42:18] Spencer,
[42:20] a friend
[42:23] and a man of God.
[42:28] Welcome, Holy Spirit.
[42:35] We are in your presence.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:42] Fill us with your power
[42:49] inside
[42:50] of me.
[42:55] Welcome, Holy Spirit.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you just lift your
[43:02] hands in your
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Give him a little wave offering this
[43:07] evening and say, "Lord, here am I. Your
[43:10] power
[43:15] live inside
[43:17] of me.
[43:37] Fill us with your power
[43:44] inside
[43:46] of me.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire tonight?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:56] Hallelujah.
[43:58] We want to just welcome him to wherever
[44:00] you're at.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; We're very aware that he's here.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; We know without a shadow of a doubt. We
[44:15] don't have to beg him now. He's here.
[44:20] Now, I would like for you to reach
[44:22] beyond your senses just for a bit
[44:26] &gt;&gt; and say, "Father,
[44:28] pass by my way.
[44:32] Would you pass by my way?"
[44:35] These are very sacred grounds.
[44:38] These are grounds that God chose to to
[44:41] bless.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; We're coming up on our 10th anniversary.
[44:50] And I was burned by a propane explosion,
[44:56] laying in a coma
[44:58] with with both lungs completely full of
[45:03] pneumonia
[45:05] and also soot from the fire. And they
[45:08] declared them to be 75% destroyed.
[45:14] The doctors had just told my wife
[45:18] that it would be impossible for me to
[45:21] live.
[45:24] Brother Bisll called my wife,
[45:28] caught her on the phone,
[45:31] which was a miracle within itself.
[45:35] And he began to tell her that
[45:38] you were praying for her. He was
[45:40] burdened on his heart
[45:43] that of what all was going on and
[45:46] burdened for her as well. She's in the
[45:49] building.
[45:52] One son was in the hospital. The Matthew
[45:55] that one had saved my life.
[45:58] He was burned and he was in one hospital
[46:02] and I was in another ICU burn unit.
[46:08] My lungs burned, my mouth burned, my
[46:11] throat burned, my face, my arms burned,
[46:16] my arms burned completely to the bones.
[46:20] But God's rich in mercy.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; And as the doctors were giving up,
[46:27] there's a voice that spoke to brother Ed
[46:30] &gt;&gt; that told him they had just bought Bible
[46:34] Way Mount Baker Camp. Yeah.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And that I would be the speaker next
[46:41] year.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Now to humanity it looked impossible.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And if you were looking at the
[46:49] circumstances,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; it would have been impossible.
[46:54] But the God that is in this building
[46:56] right now
[46:58] &gt;&gt; is a God of the impossible.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:05] And I came the next year and spoke that
[47:08] meeting, my family with me. That was the
[47:11] year that Brother Andrew would receive
[47:13] the Holy Ghost.
[47:17] The next week we went home. My lungs
[47:21] were scarred and I was great dealing
[47:23] with great difficulty of the scarring of
[47:26] my lungs.
[47:28] Brother Ed Bisll was preaching a meeting
[47:31] at Ruth, North Carolina, a mission camp.
[47:34] And as he was speaking,
[47:37] and he was speaking on God takes those
[47:40] bruised cells
[47:43] and not just heals them, but recreates
[47:46] them
[47:47] &gt;&gt; the same way that he did the earth that
[47:50] was without form and void.
[47:52] And as I was listening to that service
[47:54] that night, something began to respond
[47:58] inside of me
[48:00] &gt;&gt; that said, "Tonight's your night."
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, that that would be your response
[48:07] tonight.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Tonight's your night. Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I could have spent the rest of my
[48:13] life and with scarred lungs and and an
[48:16] an oxygen tent the rest of my life, but
[48:20] I want you to know the healer came in
[48:22] the room.
[48:24] I stood to my feet as brother Ed was
[48:26] speaking and the power of God came down
[48:29] over top of me like a great giant oxygen
[48:32] tank and it literally felt like a fire
[48:35] that went down in my lungs.
[48:38] felt like my chest was going to blow up.
[48:40] I want to report to you tonight since
[48:43] that time, I haven't had one infection
[48:48] in my lungs since then.
[48:56] Hallelujah.
[49:04] Hallelujah.
[49:05] Hallelujah. Let's just go to prayer just
[49:08] now.
[49:11] I'd like for you to brother to a
[49:13] brother, sister to a sister, husband to
[49:15] a wife,
[49:17] could you just take them by the handle?
[49:22] And I want you to repeat these words.
[49:24] Tonight's my night.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Tonight's my night.
[49:32] Almighty God,
[49:34] &gt;&gt; we bow our heads before you just now
[49:41] &gt;&gt; and we felt the angel of the Lord come
[49:43] this morning
[49:46] &gt;&gt; as brother David Mayer was speaking
[49:51] &gt;&gt; while we were in the tent
[49:53] &gt;&gt; even preparing for this prayer line
[49:55] today.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Your presence came rich and real.
[50:01] Now, Father, we admit tonight
[50:04] &gt;&gt; it is you that we want to see.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; To reach out and grab my garments
[50:11] &gt;&gt; is not enough,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; but we want to reach and grab your
[50:14] garment today.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, right now in the name of
[50:20] Jesus Christ, may faith arise throughout
[50:24] this tent,
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Lord. Not just in this tent, but around
[50:28] the world. Father, may faith arise,
[50:31] Father, with healing in its wings, dear
[50:34] God.
[50:36] May Satan be bound in the name of Jesus
[50:39] Christ.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:43] We remind the devil, he has no keys to
[50:46] his own house. He has no arrow for his
[50:49] own bow. He is nothing but a bluff. He
[50:53] is powerless at the name of Jesus
[50:56] Christ.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; We as your children just now,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, we become very aware,
[51:07] we become very aware that we're standing
[51:09] on hallowed holy ground.
[51:14] Oh God, not because men and women are
[51:18] here, because you're here.
[51:22] You're the God that makes it holy.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Oh God, Moses was commanded, take your
[51:29] shoes off. The ground you're standing on
[51:32] is a holy ground. So now may our
[51:36] thoughts and our focus be 100% on you
[51:40] right now.
[51:43] Oh, bring victory to this camp like
[51:47] never before.
[51:50] We thank you for every service that's
[51:53] ever been held on this ground. But may
[51:56] tonight go beyond
[51:59] every expectation. Father,
[52:03] we invite you to this place. We invite
[52:06] you to our pew. We invite you to our
[52:10] need right now.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll give you all the
[52:18] glory.
[52:20] In the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:33] Hallelujah.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 14 and verse one.
[52:44] If I could have just a touch more volume
[52:46] here, if it would be okay.
[52:53] St. John chapter 14 and verse one.
[52:58] Let not your heart be troubled.
[53:02] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[53:06] In my father's house are many mansions.
[53:08] And if it were not so, I would have told
[53:12] you.
[53:13] I go to prepare a place for you.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[53:22] I will come again and receive you unto
[53:25] myself. And I love these words that
[53:29] where I am,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; there you may be also.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to be where he's at.
[53:40] in Revelations chapter 1 and I want to
[53:42] read a portion of verse 17 and then 18.
[53:46] Fear not.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; I love those words. Fear not. I am the
[53:52] first and the last.
[53:55] I am he that liveth and was dead. And
[54:01] behold, I am alive forever more.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and have the keys of hell and of
[54:11] death.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; In the mighty conqueror, brother
[54:21] Brandham says it like this.
[54:24] He said, "I can see him as the heavens
[54:26] and the earth turning black, the rocks
[54:29] belting out of the mountains, the whole
[54:31] heavens, the moon, the stars refused to
[54:34] shine. He conquered it.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And when he went down and descended and
[54:41] knocked at the door where the lost souls
[54:43] was, and when the doors came open, and
[54:46] those people who laughed and made fun of
[54:49] Enoch, who made fun of Noah, I can hear
[54:52] him say, "I am that one
[54:55] &gt;&gt; that Enoch said would come with 10,000
[54:59] of his saints."
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Why didn't you believe Enoch? Why didn't
[55:03] you believe Noah? Everything had to know
[55:06] that he had conquered. When he shut the
[55:09] door on them, the days of mercy was
[55:11] passed. And on down into the lowest pits
[55:15] of hell he went and he knocked at the
[55:17] city doors of the devil's hell. And the
[55:20] devil comes to the door.
[55:23] You remember this Satan when it happened
[55:27] &gt;&gt; and the devil comes to the door as he
[55:30] could look to see. And there he said,
[55:32] "Well, here you are after all. I sure
[55:36] thought I had you when I cut John's head
[55:39] off in prison, but now after all you've
[55:42] got here, I can hear him as he
[55:45] straightens himself out and says,
[55:47] "Satan, I'm the virgin born son of God
[55:52] of the living God. My blood still wet on
[55:55] the cross. I paid the price.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; I have conquered. I have come down to
[56:02] take over, to strip you of everything
[56:04] that you claimed that you had.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; He reached over to his side and jerked
[56:09] off the keys of death and hell off of
[56:12] him and kicked him back in the place
[56:14] where he belonged. He conquered hell.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; And when he arose, he had the keys of
[56:21] death and hell hanging on his side.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Then what's the church scared about
[56:27] then?
[56:28] He conquered Satan. He conquered
[56:31] sickness. He conquered death. He
[56:34] conquered hell.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I would like to speak to you tonight. A
[56:46] subject is very dear to my heart. I
[56:49] started this in the first night I ever
[56:51] spoke along this line, but I want to
[56:54] continue with it this evening.
[56:57] And God just inspired me
[57:01] when brother Bisll got sick.
[57:04] So it becomes a very pertinent sermon
[57:07] for this night.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And I want to not just give a sermon
[57:12] title.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; But I want to make a declaration with
[57:16] this sermon title.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; you can't take his life.
[57:28] Yes sir.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; I want this echo and this reverberation
[57:36] that I feel in this platform.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; I want it to sweep across this audience.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I want I want even hell to know tonight.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; you can't take his life.
[57:55] Now, we must understand we are we go
[57:57] through trials here. We're very honest.
[58:00] The scriptures tells us that we go
[58:02] through trials. Sometimes our trials are
[58:05] very dark and extremely difficult that
[58:08] we go through
[58:10] before there can be a victory. There has
[58:12] to be a a valley. Before there can be a
[58:16] testimony, there has to be a trial that
[58:19] we walk through. We know and we've heard
[58:21] of this week Shadrach, Mach, and Abedneo
[58:25] who were thrown in a furnace of fire.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; They were thrown there only to be
[58:33] protected
[58:37] &gt;&gt; with a furnace that was heated up seven
[58:39] times hotter than normal. But I got news
[58:43] for them. They could have heated it up
[58:45] 70 million times hotter and it still
[58:48] would not have burned them.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Because the son of God met them right in
[58:56] the middle of their fire.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; We have spoke of Bardameus. He
[59:01] experienced a lifetime of blindness
[59:04] prior to experiencing the great
[59:06] physician's healing touch.
[59:09] A man named Legion would face demon
[59:12] after demon that would consume his life.
[59:15] But one day Jesus would come
[59:18] &gt;&gt; and look those demons in the eye and
[59:21] tell them that they couldn't stay there
[59:23] no longer.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you if you have been
[59:27] entertained or tormented by demons, you
[59:30] have came to the right meeting.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It is not the
[59:38] personality of a man that can shake
[59:40] those demons, but it's the power pack of
[59:43] the word of God that stands there. Are
[59:47] you with me? In a true believer's heart,
[59:49] and we are commissioned to cast out
[59:52] devils.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Lazarus had to die
[1:00:01] before he could arise.
[1:00:03] Sometimes we get impatient with God.
[1:00:06] Sometimes we think, will God ever, ever,
[1:00:10] ever, ever do anything? Will he ever
[1:00:14] come on the scene? Will he ever move?
[1:00:18] Lazarus had been a personal friend to
[1:00:20] Jesus. Brother Brandham tells us that
[1:00:22] Lazarus had been the man that took Jesus
[1:00:25] to John's baptism. He was a close
[1:00:28] friend. No doubt that they had a home to
[1:00:30] where Jesus was comfortable in. But
[1:00:32] Lazarus got sick
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; and Jesus seemably was going another
[1:00:37] way. And they told him he was much
[1:00:40] sicker and he seemably went other
[1:00:41] farther even away. Let me just say God
[1:00:44] has a plan in our lives.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; There's a plan and a season that is in
[1:00:49] our lives. But God is always on time.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We must be reminded tonight
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; that death is a doorway.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; It is a doorway. It is only a tool in
[1:01:07] the hand of God.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; That allows us to go from this portal to
[1:01:14] that portal.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I must remind you that the last breath
[1:01:18] here is the first breath there.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And many times we fear death. We look at
[1:01:26] death as some great tormenting thing.
[1:01:28] For a Christian, it is the friend.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; From that point, cancer is defeated,
[1:01:36] tuberculosis is defeated,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; paralyzation is defeated.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And there is a land beyond the river
[1:01:45] where there's no pain, no agony, no
[1:01:48] sorrow.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:57] Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] I share this with you this afternoon.
[1:02:04] I stand as a witness.
[1:02:08] Some people can preach on victory,
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; preach on trials, and they've only read
[1:02:14] them out of books.
[1:02:17] They can speak a lot of things that can
[1:02:20] can shake great congregations,
[1:02:23] but it makes a real difference when
[1:02:24] you've lived through
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; some trials.
[1:02:29] I didn't ask for trials to come my way.
[1:02:32] I I I didn't I didn't see them coming. I
[1:02:36] never intended them to happen.
[1:02:39] But God allows trials to come
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; sometimes to see what we'll do with it.
[1:02:45] I stand as a witness
[1:02:48] that my God is bigger than every trial
[1:02:53] that I've been through.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I fell off of a house 40 ft and landed
[1:03:00] on concrete solidly on my back. It broke
[1:03:05] every vertebrae in my back. The doctor
[1:03:09] telling me that I would never walk
[1:03:11] again.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And we spoke to that doctor and said,
[1:03:18] "You just don't know who you're talking
[1:03:20] to."
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; My dad came in and prayed for me. And he
[1:03:25] said, "The spirit of the Lord spoke to
[1:03:27] him this night. He'll ride home with
[1:03:29] you."
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And after several hours, feelings
[1:03:35] started coming back in my legs. Let me
[1:03:38] just say, that was Friday. On Monday, I
[1:03:42] went back to work.
[1:03:56] two strokes.
[1:03:59] Heart conditions.
[1:04:01] One of the strokes was a uh one that
[1:04:03] would keep me for eight days.
[1:04:06] I could not stand light. I thought that
[1:04:09] was the way I was going to be. Now it's
[1:04:11] eight days. And I was praying.
[1:04:14] While I was praying, God spoke to me
[1:04:17] during the night and said, "Who are
[1:04:19] you?"
[1:04:21] And I just called out. I remember
[1:04:23] calling out to him, raising my hands in
[1:04:25] that bed, saying, "I'm a son of God."
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord moved in the
[1:04:30] room. A nurse came in that had not been
[1:04:33] taken care of me before, and she was
[1:04:36] using a little flashlight. The room was
[1:04:38] completely pitch pitch black cuz I could
[1:04:40] not stand light. And she she said, "Mr.
[1:04:44] Spencer," she said, "I I I'm here." I
[1:04:47] said, "The other people have told me
[1:04:48] about you and you're a preacher." I
[1:04:50] said, "Yes, ma'am. She said,
[1:04:54] "When I walked through your door, I felt
[1:04:56] something.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I felt something move.
[1:05:02] I'm not a Christian, but I sure would
[1:05:04] like to be a Christian."
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; I said, "Tonight, you can bow on your
[1:05:10] knees and give your heart to Jesus
[1:05:12] Christ."
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And she got down on her knees and she
[1:05:16] put my hand into her hand and and we
[1:05:18] begin to pray. after get done praying
[1:05:21] for her, God healed me 100%. And I went
[1:05:26] home the next morning.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God. He said,
[1:05:38] "Satan may pin you in a corner with
[1:05:41] cancer."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "God will make a way of escape.
[1:05:45] Satan may pin you down under a car,
[1:05:47] brother David, but God will make a way
[1:05:50] of escape. Satan may have taken your
[1:05:53] family away from you, but God will make
[1:05:55] a way of escape.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; God has made a way of escape.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I don't believe
[1:06:10] in miracles. The days of miracles are
[1:06:12] passed." You have came way too late.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; You were at the wrong meeting.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Our God is alive.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; He has proved himself to be alive.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Our God, I don't want to say this in the
[1:06:28] wrong way, but our God did not die in
[1:06:30] 1965.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He is still here tonight.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And the reason that he has came to this
[1:06:39] meeting tonight is because of your need.
[1:06:45] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would use this
[1:06:55] scripture over and over again. And this
[1:06:57] got to be a haunting scripture in hell.
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:07:06] and forever.
[1:07:08] Isaiah 53 and verse one says, "Who hath
[1:07:11] believed our report and to whom is the
[1:07:13] arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall
[1:07:16] growth before him as a tender plant, a
[1:07:18] root out of dry ground, and he hath no
[1:07:21] form of comedies. And when we shall see
[1:07:23] him, there is no beauty that we should
[1:07:26] desire him. He is despised and rejected
[1:07:29] of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted
[1:07:32] with grief, and we hid, as it were, our
[1:07:34] faces from him. He was despised and we
[1:07:37] esteemed him not. Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:07:40] Surely he hath borne our griefs,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[1:07:47] him, stricken and smitten of God, and
[1:07:49] afflicted. But he was wounded for our
[1:07:51] transgressions.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for our transgressions.
[1:07:58] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:08:01] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[1:08:04] And with his stripes,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; with his stripes we are healed.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. He had
[1:08:28] power to call 10,000 angels to set him
[1:08:32] free.
[1:08:38] But he refused
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; to utter and even look at them in in a
[1:08:43] in a certain way to bring them on the
[1:08:45] scene
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; because you was so important.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And he knew that every strike that Satan
[1:08:55] unleashed on top of him,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; they were surrendering. They didn't
[1:09:00] realize it, but they were surrendering
[1:09:03] their power.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; If you could just look at it tonight,
[1:09:09] they unleashed their demonic power on
[1:09:13] the body of Jesus Christ. I say, "Bring
[1:09:18] it on."
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; As they beat him, the more they beat
[1:09:25] him, the more they freed us.
[1:09:32] Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; No wonder we can stand here by the word
[1:09:37] of God and say this promise is mine.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; John 19:10. I'm trying not to get too
[1:09:48] excited too quick. Not doing a good job
[1:09:51] of it. Then said Pilate unto him, "Speak
[1:09:55] thou not unto me. knowest not that I
[1:09:59] have power to crucify thee, and have
[1:10:02] power to release thee? And Jesus
[1:10:05] answered, Thou couldest have no power at
[1:10:10] all against me,
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; except it was given thee from above.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he that deliverth un me unto
[1:10:19] thee hath the greater sin.
[1:10:25] John chapter 10 and verse 14. I am the
[1:10:28] good shepherd and know my sheep and know
[1:10:32] and I'm known of mine. As the father
[1:10:34] knoweth me, even so know I the father
[1:10:38] and I lay down my life for the sheep and
[1:10:41] other sheep I have which are not of this
[1:10:44] fold. Them also I must bring and they
[1:10:47] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[1:10:49] one fold and one shepherd. Therefore
[1:10:52] doth my father love me because I lay
[1:10:54] down my life that I may take it up
[1:10:57] again.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Notice these words. No man taketh it
[1:11:02] from me.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; No man.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; No man taketh it from me.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; But I have I lay it down on myself. I
[1:11:15] have power to lay it down. and I have
[1:11:18] power to take it up again.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; This commandment have I received of my
[1:11:26] father.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; In Philippians chapter 2 and verse 10,
[1:11:31] that at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:11:34] should bow of things in heaven, of
[1:11:36] things in earth, of things under the
[1:11:39] earth. Acts 4 and verse 10. Be it known
[1:11:42] unto all of you, and to all the people
[1:11:44] of Israel, that by the name of Jesus,
[1:11:47] Christ of Nazareth, whom you have
[1:11:49] crucified, whom God hath raised from the
[1:11:52] dead, even by him this man stand before
[1:11:55] you whole. This is the stone that setth
[1:11:58] the naught of the builders, which has
[1:12:00] become the head of the corner. Neither
[1:12:02] is there salvation in any other. For
[1:12:05] there is none other name given in heaven
[1:12:09] given among men whereby we must be
[1:12:12] saved.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; There's not another living God on the
[1:12:18] earth
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; that could pay the price of redemption
[1:12:22] for you.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care what rock you pray to.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care what statue you kiss. I
[1:12:30] don't care how many rosary beads. Let me
[1:12:32] just say this you. My Jesus is alive and
[1:12:36] well tonight.
[1:12:40] I declare to you one more time. We have
[1:12:42] an empty tomb.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He did not need to buy the tomb. All he
[1:12:49] needed to do was borrow the tomb.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wasn't going to be there
[1:12:58] very long.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; He looked at what the word said.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and in 3 days I'll
[1:13:07] raise it up again.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; When he walked to Lazarus's tomb,
[1:13:17] when he walked to Lazarus's tomb, who
[1:13:19] was who's was his friend?
[1:13:24] He said, "Roll away the stone."
[1:13:28] You better know who you are.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; You better know who you are when you
[1:13:32] step out by that kind of faith.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He not only knew who he was, but he had
[1:13:37] power.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's how powerful this message is.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God overseas.
[1:13:52] And he's standing there before all of
[1:13:54] those Hindu and Muhammad gods.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; And he's standing there. He's had a
[1:13:59] vision of this blind man before him.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And he stops. He's had a vision of this
[1:14:04] man's eyes coming open.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Which of your gods can come
[1:14:10] and heal this man?"
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people make boast
[1:14:15] they can't back up.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; They can tell you how great their their
[1:14:18] God is. Well, back it up.
[1:14:23] I want to tell you, my God's never been
[1:14:25] in a crisis.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; My God has never been bankrupt.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; He has never broke one promise.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Men may disappoint you,
[1:14:38] but my God has never disappointed me one
[1:14:42] time.
[1:14:45] He's never turned his back on me. Not
[1:14:48] one time.
[1:14:54] Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Lazarus no doubt was fellowshipping with
[1:15:01] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he was
[1:15:04] talking to them about what it was like
[1:15:06] to be with Jesus as he was baptized. And
[1:15:10] Abraham Abraham said, "I met him as
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Melazdc,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and after I met him, I turned young
[1:15:18] again.
[1:15:20] It was amazing to my community, but he
[1:15:23] told me I was going to have a son, not
[1:15:25] as an old man. And Sarah, she doubted
[1:15:29] and she laughed. Isn't that right,
[1:15:30] Sarah? And Sarah said, "Yeah, I laughed
[1:15:32] in the tent. I couldn't believe it would
[1:15:35] happen to me, but after he left and I
[1:15:38] realized my revelation of the promise,
[1:15:40] that promise was not only for you, but
[1:15:42] it was also for me." And I began to
[1:15:45] grasp a hold of it in my life.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And one morning
[1:15:52] we woke up.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And my hair was new and my teeth was new
[1:16:00] and my body was too.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's my God.
[1:16:17] That's my God.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; No doubt Lazarus could tell some
[1:16:24] testimonies of what he was beginning to
[1:16:26] see. And he said, "Hang on, boys.
[1:16:29] I hear a voice."
[1:16:35] Brother said that voice be to circle in
[1:16:38] that realm
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; and it be to go out in that realm
[1:16:43] and death could not hold on to him
[1:16:46] anymore
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; and Lazarus be to respond to that voice.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I love these words.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Loose him.
[1:17:01] Loose him.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Loose him and let him go.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; I declare unto you tonight, you don't
[1:17:08] need those grave clothes.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; You might have been dead in trespasses
[1:17:14] and sin and your life may have seem been
[1:17:17] buried and you thought you had no hope,
[1:17:20] but Jesus came in this meeting and he
[1:17:23] called for you.
[1:17:27] Satan, you can't have his life.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, dig those grave clothes
[1:17:38] off of your children.
[1:17:41] Dig them off. Dig them off. Dig them
[1:17:45] off. There's some change that's going
[1:17:47] on. Dig them off.
[1:17:51] Glory.
[1:17:53] Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus is on his way to your house
[1:18:10] tonight.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Give me a moment just to relish in this.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; It was December the 30th.
[1:18:39] I was awakened by a dream.
[1:18:44] In this dream,
[1:18:46] dreams operate a little bit different
[1:18:48] than visions.
[1:18:51] In this dream, I I saw myself,
[1:18:55] brother Tim Puit, other ministers, and
[1:18:58] brother Ed Biscll together.
[1:19:02] We were at the end of the meeting, and
[1:19:04] we was all standing having our pictures
[1:19:05] taken.
[1:19:12] We were just relishing in what a great
[1:19:13] meeting that we had.
[1:19:15] We were just talking about his presence
[1:19:17] and
[1:19:19] what a great thing that was happening.
[1:19:25] Then that dream swapped
[1:19:28] and it went to memorial service
[1:19:32] and Timothy Puit was preaching. I am the
[1:19:35] resurrection
[1:19:36] and I am the life.
[1:19:40] I am the resurrection and I am the life.
[1:19:44] Then it's twitch scenes again.
[1:19:47] Brother Tim Puit, we were in a a large
[1:19:51] audience and he calls out to me and he
[1:19:54] says, "I have a best friend here in the
[1:19:57] building. His name is Brother Ron
[1:19:59] Spencer." He said, "Brother Ron," he
[1:20:03] said, "Oh, thou suffering,
[1:20:07] stand and be healed." Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; In that moment, I woke up
[1:20:15] and I just began to lift my hands and I
[1:20:18] got up out of bed and the presence
[1:20:20] that's in this room right now was in my
[1:20:22] room
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; and I begin to worship the Lord. Before
[1:20:27] long, my my my English went into a
[1:20:30] heavenly language
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; and I begin to worship the Lord in that
[1:20:35] presence.
[1:20:37] Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Soon it was over. I I wrote it down real
[1:20:41] quickly.
[1:20:43] Later in the day, I would send it I
[1:20:46] would send it to brother Tim.
[1:20:49] We would make comments backwards and
[1:20:51] forwards.
[1:20:53] You see, four weeks before that, I'd had
[1:20:55] a heart attack.
[1:20:58] And I was thinking this is my my healing
[1:21:02] that God was going to heal me.
[1:21:05] Then
[1:21:07] I would have my son-in-law Dave Breeden.
[1:21:12] It was during the winter and we had what
[1:21:15] we call black ice and he hit a patch of
[1:21:18] black ice and it literally wrapped his
[1:21:21] tree his his truck around a tree
[1:21:26] and it pinned David be between the door
[1:21:31] the seat and that tree.
[1:21:34] It crushed his shoulder. It crushed all
[1:21:37] the back of his shoulder, front of his
[1:21:39] shoulder. It crushed his ribs. It
[1:21:41] crushed his back, five different
[1:21:43] vertebraes. It crushed his pelvis to
[1:21:46] where the doctor said, "We've never seen
[1:21:48] a pelvis crush this much."
[1:21:51] And then it crushed his knee as well.
[1:21:58] I would go to the doctor an hour later
[1:22:02] not knowing all of that was going on
[1:22:06] and I would sit Andrew my son was with
[1:22:08] me and we sat in the doctor's office and
[1:22:11] Andrew's giving me sermon reports he's
[1:22:13] he's telling me daddy you believe daddy
[1:22:15] you believe daddy you believe you
[1:22:16] believe you speak it we're going to
[1:22:18] believe it and that doctor came in with
[1:22:21] a declaration
[1:22:24] he said yep you had a heart attack.
[1:22:28] He said, "But you have zero damage."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "What we've got to do is make
[1:22:36] sure that you don't have another one."
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Well, this might be my
[1:22:42] dream."
[1:22:44] Saturday morning,
[1:22:46] I get word that my mother's sick.
[1:22:50] My mother's very nauseated.
[1:22:52] Now, it becomes beyond nausea.
[1:22:56] and they take her to a hospital. In a
[1:22:58] couple of hours, they're rushing her to
[1:23:00] a big hospital. I live about two hours
[1:23:03] away from them. I have service that
[1:23:05] afternoon.
[1:23:07] Davey's in the point of could go either
[1:23:10] way. Now, my mother's in a point of
[1:23:12] could go either way. After coming home
[1:23:15] from service that evening, just the
[1:23:18] spirit of the Lord spoke to me. Go to
[1:23:21] your mother's side.
[1:23:23] I told Andrew, I called Andrew, "Can you
[1:23:25] go?" And he said, "Dad, I'll go with you
[1:23:28] in the morning. You just tell me what
[1:23:30] time." And so we picked a time to leave.
[1:23:32] And we got in the car and just something
[1:23:35] spoke out of me. Today is going to
[1:23:37] change her life.
[1:23:40] And they begin to send us word before we
[1:23:42] got there that she's coding and she's in
[1:23:45] very bad shape. She's just barely
[1:23:47] hanging on.
[1:23:48] Brother Tim Puit sent me a note and he
[1:23:53] said, "Brother Ron, your dream is
[1:23:55] getting ready to happen."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And I ran down the hallway when I
[1:24:02] arrived and doctors met me in the
[1:24:03] hallway and said, "There's just no hope.
[1:24:07] There's just no nothing more that we can
[1:24:09] do for her. She has told us she does not
[1:24:11] want to be resuscitated."
[1:24:13] I didn't know what I was walking into,
[1:24:15] but my mother was a believer. Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I want to report to you, you would not
[1:24:22] want to you would not want to wrestle
[1:24:23] with her about whether brother Brandham
[1:24:25] was a prophet or not.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You probably wouldn't want to bring up
[1:24:31] no bad opinions of Brother Brandham to
[1:24:33] my little mother.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You see, she had a Bible completely full
[1:24:38] of checks.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And she had read where brother Brandham
[1:24:43] said, "Write the check out." And she
[1:24:46] just didn't have one check. She had
[1:24:48] thousands of checks inside of there.
[1:24:51] Every one of them were cashed.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; This message is real.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; You come too late to tell me that this
[1:25:02] ain't the truth.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; This message is more than books and
[1:25:07] tapes and tracks. This message is a
[1:25:10] living word.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] My mama could whisper in prayer and
[1:25:19] shake the kingdom of hell.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I walked in and the first words I heard.
[1:25:28] They asked her said, "Are you in any
[1:25:30] pain?" She said, "Oh, I'm fine."
[1:25:34] And the nurse turned around and knows I
[1:25:38] was standing there. She said, "Even in
[1:25:39] death, she's fine." said, "That's the
[1:25:42] sweetest person we've ever worked on."
[1:25:46] I got the opportunity about 10 seconds
[1:25:50] to talk to my mom. Wouldn't give you $10
[1:25:53] million for what that conversation was
[1:25:55] like. She talked to me
[1:25:59] like we were having a casual day.
[1:26:05] Andrew's at home tonight and she said,
[1:26:08] she said these words, "I love you.
[1:26:12] I love you.
[1:26:14] I love you." She told Andrew, "I love
[1:26:16] you. I'll see you a little later."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; The doctors jumped in where we standing.
[1:26:30] They held her hand. No, I'm not in pain.
[1:26:32] I'm not in pain. Mrs. Spencer, do you
[1:26:35] know that do you know that uh if we
[1:26:39] don't if we don't resuscitate you, you
[1:26:42] you're going to die? And she looked up
[1:26:44] in their eyes and she said, "I'm ready
[1:26:48] to go."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, she went
[1:26:56] amazing.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that sounds difficult.
[1:27:01] Hollywood can't write it like that.
[1:27:04] My mom does not suffer with a heart
[1:27:06] condition no more.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to worry about her
[1:27:10] blood pressure no more. The message that
[1:27:13] she lived by, she could die by.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; My son-in-law would go through surgery
[1:27:26] after surgery after surgery after
[1:27:28] surgery.
[1:27:31] But we never heard one negative word.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Stop your whining.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Stop worshiping the disease that you got
[1:27:47] a hoe of.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Quit worshiping that devil. How it has
[1:27:55] control over your life. My God's greater
[1:27:58] than that disease.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; He's greater than heart disease. He's
[1:28:05] greater than cancer. He's greater than
[1:28:08] every disease that there is.
[1:28:16] as it would be.
[1:28:19] He would be off off of work in
[1:28:22] rehabilitation
[1:28:24] until the first day of this senior camp.
[1:28:30] He went to work Thursday.
[1:28:41] That's pretty needed.
[1:28:49] cuz I believe it was the same God that
[1:28:51] was there with that little girl in
[1:28:54] Memphis who was blind
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and she said, "If you can get me to the
[1:28:58] healer, I'll find my daddy."
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Georgia Carter laid in a bed for over
[1:29:03] nine years and everybody around her
[1:29:06] doubted, but she read a book that gave
[1:29:08] her faith.
[1:29:11] And one day the physician walked into
[1:29:13] the room and she didn't have to lay
[1:29:15] there another day like that.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the doctor come to your room
[1:29:21] tonight.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God. How many
[1:29:26] times has he sat in the seat with you?
[1:29:29] How many times has he stood with you in
[1:29:30] the hours of your trials and your
[1:29:32] troubles and you didn't realize it? How
[1:29:35] many times was he at the wheel when you
[1:29:37] almost was killed in an accident or you
[1:29:39] just dodged that accident or something
[1:29:41] and you didn't recognize it was him? How
[1:29:43] he was set was with you. He said when
[1:29:46] the barrel was empty and the cruise was
[1:29:48] dry and there was nothing for the
[1:29:50] babies. How that that man come through
[1:29:52] and set them groceries down at the door.
[1:29:54] Whatever it was, that was Christ. He is
[1:29:58] alive today.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I declare unto you, he is on his way.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; He is on his way to where you are.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I want to declare unto you that Satan
[1:30:18] knows.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Satan knows that he's on his way
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and all of his devils lined up in hell
[1:30:29] cannot stop him.
[1:30:34] He's greater than the army in Russia.
[1:30:37] He's greater than all the Pope's
[1:30:39] challenges. He's greater than North
[1:30:41] Korea. He's greater than every
[1:30:44] government.
[1:30:47] He's greater than every leotan devil
[1:30:50] that has got you bound tonight. My God
[1:30:53] is greater than that.
[1:30:58] Listen,
[1:31:02] brother Brandon, pray. Satan, you can't
[1:31:04] hold them no more.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; They're God's children right now.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing that before you. You have
[1:31:11] to take your hand off of their life.
[1:31:13] They belong to God. I claim them for
[1:31:16] now. I claim them as trophies of
[1:31:18] Christ's love for Calvary. I challenge
[1:31:20] you to a debate. You don't have any
[1:31:23] legal power. You have no power over
[1:31:25] them. You didn't have it in the first
[1:31:27] place. You was only bluffing them. You
[1:31:30] was only bluffing them. Christ stripped
[1:31:32] you of everything that you had at
[1:31:34] Calvary. He stripped you of every power
[1:31:37] that you ever had. And you're nothing
[1:31:39] but a bluff. And we've called your
[1:31:42] bluff.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He said he took him up on a mountain.
[1:31:53] and he set him down and he rebuked him
[1:31:55] again and again. He said the word
[1:31:58] defeated Satan with the word of God,
[1:32:02] showing that the weakest of Christians
[1:32:04] can defeat Satan with thus sayeth the
[1:32:07] Lord. It is written. It is written. It
[1:32:12] is written.
[1:32:15] If the devil has told you that you're
[1:32:17] nobody, that you're the weakest one in
[1:32:19] the room, I got a quote for you.
[1:32:24] The weakest one in this building is more
[1:32:28] powerful than every devil that is in
[1:32:30] hell.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54, Behold, I have created the
[1:32:43] smith that bloweth the coals into fire,
[1:32:46] and bringeth forth an instrument for his
[1:32:48] work. I have created the waster to
[1:32:50] destroy.
[1:32:52] No weapon.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; No weapon
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee shall
[1:33:03] prosper.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, but you don't know what
[1:33:06] I've been facing over the last days. No
[1:33:08] weapon. Say it with me.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; This is your service. No weapon that is
[1:33:17] formed against me shall prosper,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:33:25] thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Come on, church. Here's
[1:33:35] the way I look at this. that every devil
[1:33:36] that hounds me,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; every devil that hounds me and knocks
[1:33:41] and frails and torments me, I just take
[1:33:43] down its name.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, just take down its name. And I
[1:33:50] take it before Papa God.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I take it before Papa God
[1:34:00] and I title tell Papa God, "This devil's
[1:34:04] been picking on me."
[1:34:08] Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] Glory.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember one scripture. If
[1:34:23] you never get this concept in your mind,
[1:34:26] I can do all things.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; I can do all things. I can do all
[1:34:35] things. I can do all things. I can do
[1:34:39] all things. I can do all things. I can
[1:34:43] do all things. I can do all things. I
[1:34:47] can do all things.
[1:34:58] The devil tells you you can't do it. I
[1:34:59] got news for you. I got a promise from
[1:35:01] God. I'll believe God over every devil
[1:35:03] that's in hell. I can do all things.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; He's passed out by now.
[1:35:37] Sister Melody standing up back there
[1:35:38] back there with her arms raised up.
[1:35:41] There was a time that she had been
[1:35:42] t-boned in an accident and she was going
[1:35:45] to therapy five times a week.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And I preached a meeting for her father
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; and I was sitting in the car after a
[1:35:52] service and she was standing through
[1:35:54] glass doors and something spoke to me.
[1:35:56] Go in and pray for her.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Go in and pray for her. And I walked in
[1:36:04] and I said, "Sister Melanie, God just
[1:36:06] spoke to me to come in here to pray for
[1:36:07] you." Her family was having to do a lot
[1:36:10] of her work for her. She was doing the
[1:36:11] best that she could do. But God being
[1:36:14] rich in mercy came on the scene and
[1:36:17] touched her life and healed her from the
[1:36:20] crown of her head to the soles of her
[1:36:22] feet.
[1:36:37] Stand up, Sister Millie. I'm not done
[1:36:38] yet.
[1:36:40] She was going through a great trial. Her
[1:36:42] daddy called me and I was sitting on the
[1:36:44] 10th floor in the Ramada Hotel in in in
[1:36:47] Jeffersonville,
[1:36:49] Kentucky.
[1:36:51] Jeffersonville, Indiana, Kentucky. God
[1:36:53] help me.
[1:36:56] And he was telling me about a situation
[1:36:58] that was she was in. And we talked about
[1:37:00] 30 minutes on that situation. I was
[1:37:03] looking at the bridge that everybody
[1:37:06] wants to fight about.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; But let me just take you a little
[1:37:13] further than everybody's fight.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I told Brother Kelly, I said, "Brother
[1:37:19] Kelly, I want to give you a word of the
[1:37:21] Lord.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; When she gets through this trial, God's
[1:37:26] going to give her a husband.
[1:37:44] in five weeks. Five. Come on in the
[1:37:49] house.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; This is faster than you, boy.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; In five days.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:05] In five days,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; God gave her a prince.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Boo
[1:38:16] devil.
[1:38:32] Oh, brother Ron, you're getting excited.
[1:38:34] We got something to get excited about.
[1:38:46] children and have overcame them because
[1:38:49] greater is he that is in you.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:39:00] that is in the world.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? Greater is he
[1:39:06] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:39:09] world. Greater is he that is in me.
[1:39:16] Hallelujah.
[1:39:27] Isaiah 40 verse 29. He gives power to
[1:39:30] the faint and to them that have no might
[1:39:33] he increases strength. Even to the youth
[1:39:36] shall faint and be weary and the young
[1:39:38] men shall utterly fall. But they that
[1:39:41] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:39:43] strength. They shall mount upon wings as
[1:39:46] an eagle. They shall run and not be
[1:39:48] weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:39:58] you can have.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Prayer has atomic power to it. Prayer
[1:40:03] changes things. Prayer changes the mind
[1:40:05] of God. Moses prayed and the greatest
[1:40:09] army in the world.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Drowned.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, it's proven by
[1:40:22] science that that didn't happen. Well,
[1:40:24] it's amazing that the greatest army in
[1:40:27] the whole world drowned in kneedeep
[1:40:30] water.
[1:40:33] But no, God opened up the Red Sea so
[1:40:36] wide that 2 million people could go
[1:40:39] across in dry land.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And then their slave masters and their
[1:40:45] governors and their king and their
[1:40:48] tormeners all ran inside of that and
[1:40:52] they became fish food.
[1:41:01] Daniel prayed and the lions laid down.
[1:41:05] Those same lions would later eat and
[1:41:08] devour the same people that had tried to
[1:41:11] destroy Daniel.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Elijah prayed and being an older man got
[1:41:17] so anointed of God, he ran 40 miles and
[1:41:22] he outrun the fastest horses in all of
[1:41:25] Israel.
[1:41:28] Prayer works.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is that uncircumcised
[1:41:37] devil? Who is that devil that has no
[1:41:39] relationship with God at all? Who is
[1:41:42] that devil that stands with nothing but
[1:41:43] a defeated thing behind him? His master
[1:41:46] was defeated at Calvary by our Lord and
[1:41:48] conqueror. He's a bluff. He said we
[1:41:51] won't believe him anymore. Down with
[1:41:54] him. Jesus Christ robbed Satan of
[1:41:56] everything that he had. He's full
[1:41:58] principalities and powers and dominion.
[1:42:00] And his dominion reigns over the heavens
[1:42:02] and earth. And we're subject to his
[1:42:04] domain. Hallelujah. And that puts him
[1:42:07] where he belongs. The devil down there
[1:42:10] and Christ the victor up there. You're
[1:42:12] David's.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You're called, elected, anointed,
[1:42:17] positionally placed, and put in the body
[1:42:19] of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the
[1:42:21] Holy Ghost. Goliath, you are defeated.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] Hallelujah. Prayer changes things.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:42:40] was ever put on the face of the earth.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; In the control of human beings, there's
[1:42:45] no atomic bomb or hydrogen junk bomb as
[1:42:49] powerful at prayer. Prayer will change
[1:42:52] the mind of God.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; I want to declare to you one more time,
[1:42:57] he is not dead, but he is alive.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; He has the keys to death and hell and
[1:43:04] the grave.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I want to quote the prophet of God
[1:43:07] tonight. House of hell give way in the
[1:43:11] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:16] Yes, sir.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus walked to Lazarus's tomb and then
[1:43:20] he be to worship.
[1:43:22] Let me just share some worship with you
[1:43:24] tonight.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; You know, people get excited at a ball
[1:43:28] game and they don't think there's
[1:43:29] nothing wrong with that.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; They get excited at political rallies
[1:43:34] and they think there's nothing wrong
[1:43:35] with that.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; But when people come to church, the
[1:43:38] devil will whisper in your ear. That's
[1:43:39] emotion.
[1:43:45] That's emotion. Well, let me just tell
[1:43:46] you this. There's where too many
[1:43:48] steelborns are.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; They have no life on the inside of them.
[1:43:54] Oh, if the great doctor could tonight
[1:43:56] could take us and give us a little
[1:43:58] breath smack and wake us up tonight and
[1:44:02] bring us to life, our cry would be unto
[1:44:06] Almighty God, let it live. Let it live.
[1:44:11] Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Prayer is more than a one-way dimension,
[1:44:20] but it's another dimension where you
[1:44:22] start worshiping back to God. Sometimes
[1:44:25] it's a lost art, but we are to call to
[1:44:28] worship back to God. Trees have leaves
[1:44:31] to worship to God. The grass, the
[1:44:34] flowers, they worship God. The birds,
[1:44:37] the animals, they begin to worship God
[1:44:40] and they sing and they sing and they
[1:44:42] sing. They don't get embarrassed about
[1:44:43] us being around. They just continue
[1:44:46] singing unto God.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Whether it's a hummingbird or a mighty
[1:44:51] eagle.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; But God loves to hear your voice.
[1:45:04] This book's full of promises.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; He's just waiting for you to take your
[1:45:09] spot.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; To take your position, to speak to your
[1:45:14] mountain, to speak to your giant.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I stand here commissioned this service.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; In January,
[1:45:39] we were driving down the highway to
[1:45:41] hearing your pastor preach.
[1:45:44] Brother Ed was speaking in a January
[1:45:47] meeting and it came to a certain spot
[1:45:51] and that certain spot I said, "Andrew,
[1:45:54] roll that back. I want to hear it
[1:45:55] again."
[1:45:57] He rolled it back and I listened to it
[1:46:00] again. I said, "Roll it back and let me
[1:46:01] listen to it again." He rolled it back
[1:46:03] and let me listen to it again. And he
[1:46:05] said, "What are you listening to,
[1:46:06] Daddy?"
[1:46:08] I said, "Listen, I want to listen to it
[1:46:10] again." I said, "Brother Ed's sick.
[1:46:16] He's sick. He's preaching. He's sick."
[1:46:22] We went to prayer.
[1:46:25] when I went to Switzerland with him and
[1:46:28] these brothers
[1:46:30] and he took the Sunday morning service.
[1:46:40] And as he preached,
[1:46:42] I could just feel it. I could feel what
[1:46:46] was going on.
[1:46:48] Somebody came up, I don't know who it
[1:46:50] was, Brother David, you might know who
[1:46:51] it was, came up on this side and had
[1:46:53] prayer. Another one came up to have
[1:46:55] prayer. Before long, there was a group
[1:46:56] of people that came up to have prayer.
[1:46:57] Another one came up to have prayer. This
[1:47:00] one came up to have prayer. And he came
[1:47:01] and he prayed on this side. And
[1:47:03] something just nudged me. Take him off
[1:47:06] the stage.
[1:47:10] And I stepped up. I stepped up beside
[1:47:12] him trying not to be irreverent.
[1:47:15] Brother Glenn, you were there. And I
[1:47:18] whispered in his ear, "It's time to go.
[1:47:24] And we took him and I didn't say a word
[1:47:26] to him. We went all the way up the steps
[1:47:29] and went to his room and he said, "Won't
[1:47:32] you come in?" Who can refuse Brother Ed?
[1:47:37] Who can refuse him? Won't you come in
[1:47:38] and we just talk? We don't get much of a
[1:47:40] chance to talk. And I said, "No, because
[1:47:43] I love you.
[1:47:46] I want you to rest knowing what I felt.
[1:47:52] A few weeks ago, he called me.
[1:47:56] He said, "Will you have prayer for me?"
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; And I went to prayer.
[1:48:14] I went to prayer
[1:48:17] and the presence of God dropped where we
[1:48:20] was at.
[1:48:23] I don't know how many miles away, 3,000
[1:48:25] miles away,
[1:48:27] but that same angel of the Lord
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; came down.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I let him tell you what all happened in
[1:48:36] that prayer. But God came on the scene.
[1:48:39] Hallelujah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; I came off of that off of that prayer,
[1:48:46] out of that out of that that event that
[1:48:48] took place and God dropped this sermon
[1:48:52] in my heart.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; you can't take his life.
[1:49:17] Who are you, brother Ron? I am a son of
[1:49:20] God.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; I could care less if you know my name. I
[1:49:29] could care less what you think of me. I
[1:49:32] am a son of God. I believe there's sons
[1:49:35] of gods in this building tonight that
[1:49:38] can look the devil right square in the
[1:49:40] eyes and say, "I've had enough of you.
[1:49:49] It's at the end of a trial we should
[1:49:51] rejoice.
[1:49:54] I have a right to rejoice. I've given
[1:49:56] you list after list of things that
[1:49:59] Satan's tried to thwart the children of
[1:50:02] God and we have become overcomers.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to need an example of
[1:50:11] I'm going to need an if God gives me
[1:50:12] strength for about three more minutes.
[1:50:17] Hallelujah. It's the best workout human
[1:50:20] beings ever had.
[1:50:25] Satan, I want you to listen as well.
[1:50:29] Children of God, I want you to be with
[1:50:30] me.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; We are a team.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Psalms 150. Praise ye the Lord.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him
[1:50:45] in the firmament of his power. Praise
[1:50:47] him for his mighty acts. Praise him for
[1:50:50] his excellent greatness. Praise him on
[1:50:52] the sound of a t trumpet. Praise him
[1:50:55] with a saucery and a harp. Praise him
[1:50:57] with a timal and a dance. Praise him
[1:51:00] with a string instruments and organs.
[1:51:02] Praise him upon the loud sounding
[1:51:04] symbols. Praise him upon the high
[1:51:06] sounding symbols.
[1:51:11] Let everything that hath breath
[1:51:28] Let everything that hath breath praise
[1:51:32] ye the Lord.
[1:51:45] Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all
[1:52:06] you lands.
[1:52:08] Serve the Lord with gladness. Come
[1:52:10] before his presence with singing. Know
[1:52:13] ye that he is the Lord. He is God. It is
[1:52:16] he that hath made us, not we ourselves.
[1:52:19] We are his people, and the sheep of his
[1:52:22] pasture. Enter into his gates with
[1:52:24] thanksgiving, into his courts with
[1:52:26] praise. Be thankful unto him and bless
[1:52:29] his name. For the Lord, he is good.
[1:52:59] Hallelujah.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] Hallelujah.
[1:53:13] Hallelujah.
[1:53:15] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[1:53:19] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[1:53:23] Let your voices cry out to your
[1:53:25] circumstances tonight.
[1:53:31] Glory.
[1:53:34] Glory,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; glory and power.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:56] Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:54:03] Yes.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, I'd have liked to been
[1:54:07] in a prayer line with brother Brandham.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not brother Brandham, but the same
[1:54:12] angel of the Lord's in the building
[1:54:14] right now.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; I am nothing, but Jesus Christ is
[1:54:22] everything.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Throw your scarecrows away right now and
[1:54:28] defy the demon powers out of hell.
[1:54:34] I would refuse to listen to the devil
[1:54:36] another day. I would refuse to go home
[1:54:40] slave to those sweetnesses in your life.
[1:54:44] I would declare today that today is my
[1:54:48] jubilee day.
[1:54:51] I am a slave no more.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:55:31] Praise him, saints.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:41] God is in the tent.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Now, if the brothers would come that I
[1:55:47] spoke to this afternoon,
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; would you come here, please? I believe
[1:55:54] it's time.
[1:55:56] Yes, sir.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I believe it's time because brother Ron
[1:56:00] opened the service said, "He's always on
[1:56:02] time.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; He's always on time." And I believe he's
[1:56:07] on time right now. So, I looked up a
[1:56:10] quote and I was thinking there was a
[1:56:11] little lady that said, "When is it my
[1:56:13] time? When is it my time?" All of a
[1:56:17] sudden, that prophet turned around and
[1:56:19] said, "This time is your time."
[1:56:24] Hallelujah.
[1:56:26] This is your hour. This is your night.
[1:56:30] This is your time.
[1:56:38] Amen. People can walk out, but God is
[1:56:41] here to deliver you tonight. Whatever
[1:56:44] your situation is,
[1:56:46] Jesus, come on the scene now. Confirm
[1:56:49] your word with signs following.
[1:56:53] Satan, you cannot have her.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Brothers, if you would line up here,
[1:57:04] please
[1:57:05] listen to that prophet say that presence
[1:57:07] and that angel that is with me on that
[1:57:10] platform tonight is not only for this
[1:57:13] generation. He said it is for
[1:57:15] generations to come. And I stood up and
[1:57:18] said, "Brother Ron, Brother Ron, it's
[1:57:20] going to be tonight. This generation is
[1:57:23] going to have a visitation with that
[1:57:25] same angel that was with the prophet.
[1:57:28] Can you say amen?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe it's your time
[1:57:33] tonight? Is he always on time?
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ella, why don't you make
[1:57:43] your way, honey? Why don't you make your
[1:57:45] way?
[1:57:48] Always on time. He's on time every time.
[1:58:00] That's right, sister. This is your hour.
[1:58:06] He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:58:09] forever. And if there's anybody else
[1:58:12] that would like to come and have prayer
[1:58:14] right now, you come here tonight.
[1:58:18] You make your way. the brothers will
[1:58:20] help you. Amen. And if you don't need
[1:58:24] prayer, well, you stay in there and you
[1:58:25] start praying with us. But I believe God
[1:58:28] is here to deliver, to set free, to
[1:58:32] heal, to move. Amen. To fill with God's
[1:58:36] Holy Spirit.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; If you want to line up right here, you
[1:58:44] just make your way of Jesus Christ right
[1:58:47] now.
[1:58:50] sweatshirt.
[1:59:14] Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[3:42:27] glory. Glory. Glory.
[3:42:31] What a love story. What a love story.
[3:42:35] What a love story.
[3:42:38] Glory.
[3:42:41] Hallelujah.
[3:42:43] I call on the Lord and he hears me.
[3:42:47] How many called on the Lord tonight?
[3:42:50] &gt;&gt; Did he hear you?
[3:42:54] &gt;&gt; Did he hear you?
[3:42:56] Amen. Let's sing that chorus once again
[3:42:59] because I know my God loves you very
[3:43:01] much
[3:43:03] &gt;&gt; to bring the ministry through this
[3:43:05] weekend.
[3:43:07] Look out devil.
[3:43:09] Satan, be careful.
[3:43:14] That's what it's all about. A victorious
[3:43:17] church,
[3:43:20] a super church, a super race. Don't look
[3:43:25] for it. You are it.
[3:43:29] Glory.
[3:43:31] I don't have to.
[3:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got the devil on the run. We
[3:43:40] might as well keep him running.
[3:43:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, our God is tremendous. His grace
[3:43:46] never failing. He goes through the fire
[3:43:49] just to save
[3:43:57] me.
[3:44:00] Oh, there is no one powerful. Our God
[3:44:03] cannot handle our mindless
[3:44:07] feeling you and me.
[3:44:13] The greatest love story.
[3:44:17] So when I need I call the Lord
[3:44:22] and he hears me and tells me
[3:44:32] never never
[3:44:39] true
[3:44:42] a wonderful Savior
[3:44:46] Jesus.
[3:44:47] The lion of Judah
[3:44:53] is great.
[3:44:55] He'll go through the fire
[3:44:58] sle.
[3:45:12] Our God is blessed revealing you and me
[3:45:16] down from glory
[3:45:20] the grace of story.
[3:45:30] Glory.
[3:45:32] He gave us the victory, Josh. He gave us
[3:45:35] the victory.
[3:45:37] He gave us victories tonight.
[3:45:42] We are not a defeated people. We are a
[3:45:45] victorious people through the word of
[3:45:48] God.
[3:45:51] Hallelujah. I had the pleasure of
[3:45:54] standing with these dear brothers and
[3:45:56] having brother Ron and listening to him
[3:45:58] discerning the different needs blowing
[3:46:01] my mind because I know the need.
[3:46:05] God's gifts are in the body.
[3:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I'm so thankful I happen
[3:46:12] to be a part of the body. What a
[3:46:15] wonderful body. Look around the room.
[3:46:18] Try and think who could have put us
[3:46:20] together.
[3:46:22] Only God could have put us together. I
[3:46:25] look at you in in the beauty of
[3:46:27] holiness. I say our God is tremendous
[3:46:29] tonight.
[3:46:31] &gt;&gt; Deliverance.
[3:46:34] &gt;&gt; Deliverance.
[3:46:36] &gt;&gt; How many got filled with the Holy Ghost
[3:46:38] tonight?
[3:46:40] Amen.
[3:46:42] How many got healed tonight? Amen.
[3:46:47] Our God is where do we stop? Where do we
[3:46:51] stop? I said to brother John all all
[3:46:53] through the week and my wife, I said,
[3:46:55] I'm so burdened for Josh. I'm so
[3:46:57] burdened for Josh. I'm so burdened for
[3:46:59] Josh. And at the last one coming up,
[3:47:02] then brother Ally comes up and brother
[3:47:04] John has a dream about him. Said he's
[3:47:07] going to be here. I say God's working
[3:47:09] amongst his people.
[3:47:17] I could almost do a brother Ron.
[3:47:22] Glory.
[3:47:30] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my.
[3:47:43] all night.
[3:47:45] &gt;&gt; Wow. It is a night time.
[3:47:50] Ah. The brothers came up where he said,
[3:47:51] "We're we're going to have a three." I
[3:47:53] said, "There we're going to be you guys
[3:47:54] are going to be praying forever." I
[3:47:56] said, "Man," I said, "I prayed Brother
[3:47:59] Lou in China. We had what, brother Lou?
[3:48:01] Where are you?"
[3:48:02] &gt;&gt; Here. Here. H how long of a prayer line
[3:48:04] did we pray for?
[3:48:05] &gt;&gt; 5 hours.
[3:48:06] &gt;&gt; 5 hours.
[3:48:08] &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Murphy and I stand there,
[3:48:10] brother Luke for 5 hours.
[3:48:13] &gt;&gt; So if you think that this was a long
[3:48:15] prayer line, think again. But our God is
[3:48:19] tremendous.
[3:48:20] &gt;&gt; Whether it's in Canada, United States,
[3:48:24] China, the same God that meets them over
[3:48:26] there is the same God that is in this
[3:48:29] tent tonight.
[3:48:35] Glory.
[3:48:38] Amen. The gifts are in the body. It's
[3:48:41] not a one-man ministry. It's a body
[3:48:44] ministry.
[3:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the wonderful thing,
[3:48:47] Brother Nathan. The thing's finished.
[3:48:48] It's over. It's gone. It's complete.
[3:48:50] &gt;&gt; We just now march on.
[3:48:53] &gt;&gt; You came to me and said, "We had your I
[3:48:54] had these problems. I've been battling
[3:48:56] this. It's over."
[3:48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:49:00] &gt;&gt; Where's Leah? Is Leah still here? I want
[3:49:03] to sing the bloodline.
[3:49:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:49:06] &gt;&gt; I want to sing in that bloodline. I've
[3:49:09] got that on my iPod or whatever they
[3:49:11] call it podcast. I play it over and over
[3:49:16] and over because I keep on telling the
[3:49:18] devil, you can't cross this bloodline.
[3:49:24] Do we know it well enough? Brother Ryan,
[3:49:26] you do too. Leah, is she here? No.
[3:49:30] you. I'm sure she's going to come up
[3:49:32] here because she's going to have a
[3:49:33] victory in her life.
[3:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:49:42] &gt;&gt; You have words for it or no words for
[3:49:43] it?
[3:49:53] Well, I'll sing it with you.
[3:50:11] Good all night.
[3:50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I was listening to a tape
[3:50:17] today. Brother Bram said as he came to
[3:50:19] the platform, he said, "The angel of the
[3:50:20] Lord is standing right here on the
[3:50:22] platform." And I thought, "Well, he's
[3:50:24] just going to go into discernment." An
[3:50:26] angel of the Lord waited until brother
[3:50:27] Brandham was finished.
[3:50:30] 35 minutes he started to preach a
[3:50:31] message. Now he says, "Now that same
[3:50:33] angel is still here right now."
[3:50:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't go.
[3:50:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here.
[3:50:39] &gt;&gt; And we're basking in the presence of
[3:50:41] God.
[3:50:43] Are we going to sing it? by the rank.
[3:50:48] Want to tell you Satan,
[3:50:52] you can't cross the blood
[3:50:58] because I'm covered by his blood.
[3:51:06] And you may stand and you may fight, but
[3:51:11] you're going to lose this battle
[3:51:15] tonight.
[3:51:17] Remember,
[3:51:19] we can't cross the bloodline.
[3:51:25] Sing it again.
[3:51:26] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you, Satan,
[3:51:32] you can't cross the blood line.
[3:51:39] by his blood.
[3:51:48] You will find
[3:51:51] you're going to lose
[3:51:54] tonight.
[3:51:55] Remember,
[3:51:58] you can't cross the bloodline.
[3:52:06] Even though my spirit's low
[3:52:11] and it seems I can't hardly go, but
[3:52:15] still I see
[3:52:19] &gt;&gt; victory.
[3:52:26] Many times I'm walking by faith.
[3:52:30] I can't see what lies before me, but
[3:52:35] still I see
[3:52:39] victory.
[3:52:44] And I just got to tell you, Satan,
[3:52:50] you can't cross the bloodline.
[3:52:55] because I'm covered by his blood.
[3:53:04] So you may stand and you may fight, but
[3:53:09] you're going to lose this battle
[3:53:12] tonight. So remember,
[3:53:16] you can't cross the blood line.
[3:53:23] Sometimes
[3:53:25] the battle gets hot
[3:53:28] and it seems we're fighting along. But I
[3:53:34] remember
[3:53:36] I'm standing on that rock.
[3:53:42] No, Satan.
[3:53:44] If I were you,
[3:53:47] I'd turn around and give that to cuz I
[3:53:52] do believe
[3:53:55] you're going to lose.
[3:54:01] And I just want to tell you, Satan,
[3:54:06] you can't cross the bloodline
[3:54:12] because I'm covered by his blood.
[3:54:20] And you may stand and you may fight, but
[3:54:25] you're going to lose this battle
[3:54:28] tonight. So remember,
[3:54:32] you can't cross the bloodline.
[3:54:38] And I just want to tell you, Satan,
[3:54:44] you can't cross the blood line
[3:54:49] because I'm covered by his blood.
[3:54:57] And you may stand and you may fight, but
[3:55:02] you're going to lose this battle
[3:55:05] tonight. Cuz remember,
[3:55:09] you can't cross the blood line.
[3:55:35] I'm happy.
[3:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55:38] &gt;&gt; I'm happy
[3:55:40] &gt;&gt; for you.
[3:55:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to see what God has done
[3:55:44] for all of us today.
[3:55:48] Well, if this was a meeting,
[3:55:51] and it was a meeting,
[3:55:53] &gt;&gt; it was a real meeting, Brother Sam.
[3:55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was a meeting.
[3:56:00] &gt;&gt; What's tomorrow going to hold?
[3:56:05] &gt;&gt; And I just want to want to say something
[3:56:07] to you, saints.
[3:56:09] That isn't uh
[3:56:12] I hate to say just a a message is put
[3:56:14] together. That's a life history.
[3:56:18] That's years of hardship, heartache, a
[3:56:23] man's that had been molded by fire. And
[3:56:26] then understanding other men that are
[3:56:28] being molded by fire, and then standing
[3:56:32] here and proclaiming to you to the devil
[3:56:35] himself, the devil can't have your
[3:56:37] pastor.
[3:56:46] That was a message from heaven for you.
[3:56:50] Amen. Amen. We love him. We love Sister
[3:56:55] Ruth. We love the effect of the gospel
[3:56:58] through their lives. And now we're going
[3:57:00] to hold them in high esteem and however
[3:57:04] we're going to give them their space and
[3:57:06] their time. But we thank God because
[3:57:09] this wouldn't even have happened if the
[3:57:12] one man wouldn't had the vision.
[3:57:16] &gt;&gt; And I thank God
[3:57:18] for men of vision
[3:57:20] for one man, our pastor.
[3:57:24] Tomorrow morning at 10:00
[3:57:27] 10:00 tomorrow morning, I know there
[3:57:30] will be a fight for the front seat.
[3:57:34] I believe we'll start at the front and
[3:57:36] work our way back. I don't think that
[3:57:37] that's really a problem here. Never
[3:57:40] been.
[3:57:42] May God grant to you not only tonight,
[3:57:44] but now you walk in it. Now you confess
[3:57:46] it and you speak it.
[3:57:49] &gt;&gt; It's not a mind game.
[3:57:52] &gt;&gt; It's a heart game.
[3:57:54] &gt;&gt; A faith.
[3:57:55] &gt;&gt; I have spoken that, Billy. You spoke
[3:57:58] that thing. You walked down that line
[3:58:00] and you told these brothers, men of God,
[3:58:02] it's over.
[3:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:04] &gt;&gt; And you might as well say it's over
[3:58:05] again.
[3:58:07] It's just over.
[3:58:08] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[3:58:08] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[3:58:10] &gt;&gt; Finished.
[3:58:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a new man.
[3:58:13] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation.
[3:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, musicians, thank you.
[3:58:36] brothers that have been around here,
[3:58:38] thank you that you be able to send this.
[3:58:41] It it will indeed go around the world.
[3:58:44] &gt;&gt; And and if you didn't have these kind of
[3:58:46] men, look, turn around. You can take a
[3:58:48] look at those kind of men. Those are
[3:58:49] special men to stand back there.

[3:59:00] has done.
[3:59:05] Amen. And you wouldn't even you would be
[3:59:07] losing 10 lbs if you didn't have a

[3:59:14] says they've lost weight at Bible Way
[3:59:16] Camp. So, can we thank the kitchen

[4:01:22] of man cuz it's a phony. Yes, sir.
[4:01:25] &gt;&gt; It's a phony.

[4:01:29] a pretty good Superman around here.
[4:01:32] &gt;&gt; Super John.

[4:01:51] Here's I I am so humbled. I get up in
[4:01:54] the morning, open my computer, going to
[4:01:57] do some reading, and brother John is
[4:01:59] polishing my golf cart.
[4:02:03] That's humility.
[4:02:06] It makes me ashamed.
[4:02:09] But I'm so proud of you. I am so proud
[4:02:12] of you.

[4:03:12] What a meeting. Praise be to God. Let's
[4:03:15] bow our heads together.
[4:03:19] If you're thankful tonight, why don't
[4:03:21] you just raise your hand to God?
[4:03:24] Oh, heavenly father.
[4:03:28] Lord, how thankful we are.
[4:03:32] You are so merciful to us, oh God. So
[4:03:36] mindful of us, Lord. We are not in
[4:03:39] ourselves deserving of the least of your
[4:03:42] mercies. But Lord, you found in your
[4:03:45] great mind that we would be worthy, that
[4:03:48] you would shed your own blood on our
[4:03:50] behalf and pay for every redemptive
[4:03:53] blessing that we would have need of,
[4:03:56] Lord. that you would ascend up on high
[4:03:59] and you would give gifts unto men and to
[4:04:02] some apostles and to some prophets and
[4:04:05] to some evangelists and some pastors and
[4:04:08] some teachers. Your love gifts to your
[4:04:11] body, oh God. And we give you all the
[4:04:14] praise and all the honor and all the
[4:04:16] glory. We thank you for brother Ron.
[4:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, how he's labored, how he's given
[4:04:21] himself. And there's one more service.
[4:04:23] Lord, we're asking that you'll pour in a
[4:04:25] special portion for him, Lord, that we
[4:04:28] might have some more from you tomorrow.
[4:04:31] I guess in this way, Lord, we're a
[4:04:33] little bit greedy. We want more of you.
[4:04:36] We want more of your love. We want more
[4:04:39] of your grace. We want more of your
[4:04:42] blessings, Lord. We want it to just
[4:04:44] overflow in our lives until, Lord, the
[4:04:47] cup cannot contain all that you give to
[4:04:50] us. We thank you, Lord, for your
[4:04:53] goodness and your mercies to us, Lord.
[4:04:58] Thank you for this service.
[4:05:01] Lord, I'm mindful of those that couldn't
[4:05:03] be here tonight cuz my own wife would
[4:05:05] love to be here, but she couldn't be
[4:05:08] here.
[4:05:10] Lord, we commit all that are out on the
[4:05:12] internet,
[4:05:14] &gt;&gt; different ones, Lord, that wish they
[4:05:15] were in the prayer line.
[4:05:20] strengthen it.
[4:05:26] &gt;&gt; May your healing
[4:05:30] &gt;&gt; be upon each one of them.
[4:05:33] &gt;&gt; We love them, Lord. And we pray, Lord,
[4:05:36] that you'll just continue to move on
[4:05:39] through the night. May you be in our
[4:05:41] dreams. May you be with us as we gather
[4:05:44] tomorrow, whether here, whether those
[4:05:46] that cannot cross the border, if they
[4:05:48] gather at the church, Lord, over on the
[4:05:51] internet in different places.
[4:05:54] Lord, gather us together again tomorrow
[4:05:55] morning, unless, Father, you choose to
[4:05:58] take us home. That would be the great
[4:06:00] gathering.
[4:06:02] Lord, we commit this service to you.
[4:06:04] Grant each one a good night's sleep.
[4:06:05] Grant safety upon the roads, Lord, and a
[4:06:08] good night's rest. We commit all to you
[4:06:10] in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ.
[4:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06:24] &gt;&gt; The kitchen has prepared something for
[4:06:26] the campers that are on camp. So those
[4:06:29] that are off camp, just make your way
[4:06:32] quietly. If you want to linger here,
[4:06:33] that's fine. But when you're finished,
[4:06:35] just make your way off grounds. That
[4:06:37] will be great. And then for the
[4:06:39] counselors in your cabins, if you want
[4:06:40] to make your way up to the kitchen, that
[4:06:42] would be fine. Tomorrow's morning in
[4:06:45] people is 10:00.
[4:06:48] And we want to bless the servant of God.
[4:06:50] I know we only have one table here with
[4:06:52] the offering envelopes. We should have
[4:06:54] had it at two doors, but forgive us for
[4:06:56] that. I want you to come prepared
[4:06:59] because we're going to take an offering
[4:07:00] up for tomorrow morning just for brother
[4:07:02] Ron Spencer. And I want to say to you,
[4:07:05] an ox is worthy of its labor. That was a
[4:07:09] labor tonight. So remember, tomorrow
[4:07:13] you're giving in worship. You're
[4:07:15] dismissed. God bless you all. Good
[4:07:17] night.
[4:07:29] Heat. Heat.
[4:07:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:08:13] Glorious
[4:08:34] Jesus.
