========================================
[music] all around. So let us praise [music] Jesus [music] now. We are standing [music] in his rest. Just sing it one more time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We are standing on [music] ground and [music] I know that there are angels [music] all around. So [music] let us pray. Jesus found [music] we [music] are standing in his presence [singing] on holy [music] ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 104:31, the glory of the Lord shall endure forever. The Lord shall rejoice in his works. Verse 33. [music] I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. My medit my meditation of him shall be sweet. I will be glad in the Lord. Amen. That little song that we used to sing came in my mind that repeats [music] those couple verses the other day. So, I thought that was fitting. God bless you. Welcome to the house of the Lord this morning. Are you here to hear the word? I trust that you've come expecting. Why don't we stand and let's sing that song? When I see the blood, &gt;&gt; aren't you thankful for the blood? &gt;&gt; Oh [music] Christ our redeemer died on the cross.

Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We're going to ask brother Mikey [music] if he would come and sing for us. I [snorts] was I called brother Mike this morning and I asked him if he would sing. [music] I don't like doing that to people, but I've had it done to me. No. Um, I was listening to the podcast and I thought, they uploaded this song and it was uh, no matter what shaking. I was like, really the mic? Hasn't sung [music] that in a long time, so this must just be an upload from an older one. So I asked for the mic, he would sing that for [music] us. And so he was gracious and said yes. Amen. So no matter what's shaking, Amen. Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Because [music and singing] he lives, I can face [music] tomorrow. Because [singing] he lives, all [music] fear is gone. Because [music] I know, yes, [singing] I know. Behold my future. [music] I'll &gt;&gt; because [music] he lives [music] I can face tomorrow because [music] all fear is gone. And [music] because I know, [singing] yes, I know he holds my future. [music] And [singing] life is worth the living just because [music and singing] he lives. Is that on now? Last time I didn't turn it on. a couple times it didn't turn on. God bless you, saints. And uh you know the song, so I trust you'd sing it with me. Um afterwards, there was a little chorus that was going through my mind as I was grinding meat throughout the week. I I just I was grinding some hamburger and I was just singing I want to live what you know what I'm talking about. And it it just kept going over my head and suddenly it was a little chorus. I thought maybe you'd want to share it with me and sing it. So, we'll see. Did you get that to to on the screen? I don't know. Okay, good. There [music] are winds of doctrine. There are stumbling stones. There are some [music] won't even shake your hand. I won't let that bother me. I'm standing on the word. Soon we're [music] getting out of here. That's the best news that I've heard. No matter what's shaken, [music] I'm hanging in. No push over Satan then sealed [music] in. No matter what's shaken, I'm pressing on. You're going to be shaken. When you [music] find out that I'm gone, I've heard enough words, Satan. [music] This box car's been packed tight. There ain't enough devils on the track to make me lose [music] this fight. It's too late to slicker. I've heard the conductor's call. [music] Inspector Jesus sealed me in. There's no way I [music] can fall. No matter what's shaken, I'm hanging in. No [music] push over, Satan, been sealed in. No matter what shaking, [music] I'm pressing on. You're going to be shaken. When you find [music] out that I'm gone, there are times I get so lost, seem battle, worn, and stressed. But I know the [music] word abides my strength throughout the test. Just [music] remember one thing. I hope you get this clear. That [music] no matter what's shaking, I'm standing without fear. No matter [music] what's shaking, I'm hanging in. No push over Satan [music] and sealed in. No matter what's shaking, I'm pressing on. You're [music] going to be shaking when you find out that I'm gone. No matter what shaking, [music] I'm hanging in. No push over, Satan. Then seal it in. No matter [music] what's shaken, I'm pressing on. [music] You're going to be shaking when you find out that I'm gone. [music] That door's good. Could you put them up back there, too? Cuz when I get nervous, I don't do that very well. [music] I singing all week long was going over my head in my sleep over and over and over. And I thought, "Okay, Lord, I've had enough. Let's sing it. Still can't see it though. Old man eyes. [laughter] Okay, I'll do the alternative here. You going to Okay, thank you. Beautiful. That's good. I want to live what I'm talking [music] about.

Sing of a brighter day soon. for my heavenly [music] home. God bless you saints. [applause] That's certainly our testimony, isn't it? Love while we're walking about and living here expressing Jesus Christ. Amen. Nice to see you all here today. We've got a full service. So, I'm going to uh move along without a whole lot of delay, but we've got some uh announcements that which we want to make. And uh we're so thankful we can report um brother John Andes and one van load is over in Victoria and next van load went to be witnesses over there with brother Matt Matthew Redell and uh so he took a group so there's two vans that are over in Victoria said they'll be streaming the meeting. So, God bless those in Victoria and Brother Alex and brother Al Sam and all of the others that are there. We're we're just pray that God will make them very very fruitful. They've had some wonderful time on the streets and uh we believe that you'll still be witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We also we want to welcome our brother Yuri and sister Valentina Chuckov. I don't know if I pronounced her name exactly right. Uh, three of their four children are here and that's Anna and she's 18, Joseph is nine and Daniel is eight. I wonder if they would stand, please, so we can welcome them. Here we have them. They [applause] they are here from Sacramento, California. [applause] God bless you. They have already moved into a home in Ferndale and uh they will be part of the congregation here and we welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. [applause] There's one daughter that is just finishing college and she's 20 or 21 years old and she will be uh joining them here in a in another short time, another week or two. Uh also, brother Yuri, for those of you that living on the on the US side, uh brother Yuri will be looking for employment on uh on that side. Now, you and I was impressed here a few weeks ago, perhaps two, three months ago. Uh they showed up, they drove all the way from Sacramento to come here for the Lord's table for communion &gt;&gt; and footwashing service. And I remember that that went down and deep in my heart. Brother Yuri, Sister Valentina, and uh first time I actually saw them was in Ukraine and right in the city where there's an awful lot of war and fighting right now, which is the city of Daetsk. And it's kind of a stronghold for the u Soviet people. I won't say Soviet people, but more for the Russian, those that want to lean towards Moscow. And there's a kind of dividing line in the country, and they're going through a lot of trouble. We we actually didn't only help to build that church. We provided all the funds for that church. And the people that worked through the winter, and I tell you, they worked like heroes. They're heroes in my books. And I believe hero in God's books. uh just a fire down on the in the basement to keep themselves so they could keep putting together the pipes and all of the concrete and everything. And I just say God bless them. They have one of the finest churches in Europe right now as far as it can hold. I think there was about 700 people at the opening and it is remarkable. It's a center for the uh uh for for the distribution of the messages in uh throughout the Ukraine and throughout that whole region. And so we we're thankful uh for that and we ask you to remember them in prayer. But that's where I first met Brother Yori and Sister Valentina. And so we're happy to have them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, right after right after the message, the service will not be over when I'm done. Uh and I'm very conscious of that because we're having four that are being baptized &gt;&gt; and we're so indeed thankful for that. Uh, Sister Lesie Lee, her son Alex, and uh, her daughter Kitty Lee. All of them. I wonder if they would just stand. They're being baptized. And Sister Melissa Molley. Melissa, are you present here? We'd like you to stand if you would, too. Uh, Sister Melissa's right there. These are the four that are being baptized. Isn't that wonderful? [applause] God bless you. Uh, Sister Leslie's children, Alex and Kitty, are are twins. And, uh, you don't have to be ashamed of that. That's fine. We've got quite a few twins here in the church and even some triplets that belong to me down the line. Sister Helen Bsberger, nice to see you. God bless you. We've been praying for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give Sister Helen a hand. [applause] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're very, very thankful for that. We're going to just change the order of the service for a moment and we want to have prayer with our brother Dominic Sangamina. Brother Dominic uh felt led and feels led and uh the Holy Spirit seemed to speak to him a name that he didn't know where it was of a town of a city and it's St. Jerome in Quebec. It is on uh So he looked it up. It's on the on the highway between Montreal and Ottawa. He doesn't know anybody there. Doesn't know any church there. We don't know any church there. We don't know anybody there. But he said this is a name that has come to him and he is to go there. And that doesn't happen every day. So we want to pray for him. And then he says, "From there, I don't know what's going to happen there, but when we're done there, I plan to go to Ethiopia." Our brother Dominic has been responsible for uh assisting to get another a couple of churches started in Africa. And so we want to have prayer for brother Dominic. If you would come forward, Brother Dominic, where you wish to pray with you. Aren't these Congalles people regal? I wish I was that tall, brother Dominic. And I don't know what God has spoken to you, but uh the Bible tells us of an account and a prophet of God referred to it where Philillip was sent from Samaria to go into the desert right in the midst of a big meeting and he left and he was reading the prophet Isaiah, the unic from Ethiopia. And he was reading and I know you know the scripture well and the account well and this is in thou knowest all things in the message thou knowest all things. He said he he didn't understand what he was reading. The unic didn't understand what he was reading and God told Philillip go join yourself with him. And when he did, he spoke to him about Christ Jesus, baptized him in a little hole of water out there, and Philip never did return back to Samaria, as far as we know, or that the Bible gives reference. And the Holy Spirit caught him away. And the unic didn't see him no more. And the unic taken that message on down into Africa. Well, there you are. You see, God knows what to do. Many times we guess at it, but God knows just exactly what's right, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; We all agree with that. We're going to pray. I'll ask a brethren to come and we're going to pray with brother Dominic, lay hands on him, and uh we can't impart anything to him, but we can ask God's blessings upon what God's intended. Heavenly Father, as this congregation views and is a witness, and those that are streaming are a witness, we are laying our hands upon our brother Dominic Sangamina. We're laying our hands upon him, oh God, because we believe that he did hear the name St. Jerome. And we don't know what what your intent is, but you know, &gt;&gt; we can guess at it, but you're not guessing at it. We can make a certain plan, but you're the one we ask to go ahead. Go before him. Lord, speak to whatever heart you have. And I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, that he will be there until you are finished. Oh God, there might be one soul. There might be more. We do not know. There may be be believers there that need to be encouraged. We do not know. But you know, thou knowest all things. and into your hands do we commit our brother and Lord Father I pray that your Holy Spirit will give speech to his lips. We pray oh God you will give thoughts to his mind and bypass the human element. We pray and may it be a direct contact with the people. Pray father that if you shall lead him and open doors to Ethiopia as brother Bus has already been there and the brethren from Kenya and brethren from Uganda. I pray oh God in the name of Jesus Christ that you will use not only one, use two, not only two, use three, use more, use our brother. I pray and as you lay your hand upon brother Dominic, we only lay our hands, oh God, upon him, acknowledging and believing that by the Holy Spirit, you will accomplish your work. And we say, "Let thy kingdom come in Jesus Christ's name." Blessings upon him and safety, I pray. and for his wife, oh God, sister Astrid, and the children. I pray, oh God, you'll watch over them and you'll provide for them. You'll give peace of mind and peace of soul in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother Dominic. God bless you. Bless you. What's that course I wondered about the Bible? Yeah. Word of God ever true. God bless you, brother Dominic and Sister Astrid. We pray that God will ever be with you. And we also want to remember uh the Roach family. Uh, Sister Glattis wrote passed away on Friday morning and my wife and I on yesterday ran into several of them in the White Rock area, the daughter Paula and her husband. Uh, her husband is a deacon at brother Tim Dodd's former church and we uh feel very close to them. uh brother Tom Ray was ministering up in Quinnel, British Columbia when they came to the knowledge of Jesus Christ in the light of this message. So we want to be remembering them and their family. We also we had an encounter with them which we don't believe was accidental. We nothing happens by accident. We hadn't planned to go where we were going and we were walking and we came right upon them. In fact, as we passed them and I said to my wife, I said, "That looks like Paula, but I wasn't sure." And so, we came upon them a second time when we changed our direction. We came upon them the second time, walking where we don't usually walk. And uh and then we saw it was Paula and her father and her brother who has just arrived from Chile had just arrived. I I don't believe he's a believer, but we he was a very fine young man. And we we had a time to speak together and share some things. And when we walked away, we knew that it wasn't a per chance happening. It was God ordained. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. I was going to tell you also uh I I did mention it Wednesday. It happened on It happened on Tuesday this last week when our phone rang and my wife answered the phone and while she was on the phone, the other line rang and uh she put her hand over the speaker and said, you know, would you go and get it? and I ran to her office to get the phone and I didn't reach it in time. And uh it it wasn't uh there was no one there. So [clears throat] when I came back out to the kitchen, I said, "Look on the LCD and see what what that number was." And so she said, "This is the number." And I wrote it down. And then I went into my office because I was studying. And I started studying. And then I thought I should call these people or call I don't know who it is but first I would go on the I would just Google the number and see what part of the world it was and it was in Buford, South Carolina. And so uh I thought well some of our one one of our families are down there. Brother Gary and Sister Lisa St. John are there. Maybe it's them. It might be brother Jason Watkins who's a pastor in the church there. It might be him. So, I dialed the number and a sister was on the phone and I just let my wife uh speak to her for a moment or two and then uh she handed the phone back [clears throat] to me. And I had I had prayed for this uh woman's husband about a year year and a half ago and I'll just give you a couple more details. I take time to tell you and and he had had an experience where uh he became very had a great a lot of pain in his elbow. So he went to the doctor just to see about it. And then after they did some tests and so on, he came back home and then he got a call at home and say, "Come right back to the office." And they came back to the doctor's office and they told him, "You have cancer and it's in the bones." And they didn't give him much hope. And I spoke with him. We spoke together and then we had prayer. And uh I hadn't heard from them since. And this was the man. And she said he had a turnaround and uh she said he was doing so well. And that's maybe a year or more ago. And then she said just recently he just uh he he had he he really had a downturn just recently. And I said well can I pray with him? And she said I don't know if he's strong enough. And she said but how did you how did you get our number? I said you called us. She said we didn't call. I said, 'Well, your number came up on the LCD.' And we wrote the number down. She says, "Uh, we we didn't call. It must have been an accident." Well, uh, I like those kind of accidents. And so, we were able to have prayer together. This is all in the last two, three weeks, we've had no less than three supernatural encounters. &gt;&gt; Isn't that our God? &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be surprised with those kind of things. We just say, "Pour it on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's have more of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll have you stand with me and we'll have we'll have prayer just before we go to the scripture. And I'd like to sing that chorus, Word of God, Ever True. Changing [music] me. Changing you. We [music] have come with open heart. Oh, let the word of God. [music] Let &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there. I'd like to ask, have we come with open heart? &gt;&gt; Can we sing that as we have as a prayer? I have come with open heart. Word of God ever true. Word [music] of God, ever true changing me, changing [music] you. We have come with open heart. [music] Oh, let the word of God. The word [music] of God [singing] ever changing [music] me, changing you. Oh, we [music] have come with open heart. Oh, left the [music] word uponart [music] as we pray. Father, we come to you through the name of Jesus Christ. our access [music] and we claim the finished work of Calvary. We claim the Holy Spirit that filled [music] the church on the day of Pentecost. We claim, oh God, the message of the [music] hour that you have given us. We claim that the prophecies which you have spoken, so many many of them have been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Give us receiving hearts today. Oh God, remove every barrier by the power of the Holy Spirit of God. And father, we pray that your thoughts, not man's thoughts, your [music] thoughts, your words inspired. And I give myself in total surrender to you, Father, that you might have your way. And I pray that each member of the congregation, all that are streaming wherever they may be in the world. I pray that you will bless them, Father, whether they be in Switzerland or in Norway or in Europe and other places in Belgium. Oh God, in [music] in Africa, Father, we just pray you'll bless the people throughout North America. I pray you'll bless the people. Oh [music] God, however many are ordained to hear this service, [music] in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles to First Peter, the Epistle of Peter, first chapter, and we'll read uh the first nine verses. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontis, Galatia, Capidosia, Asia, and Bethania, elect according to the fornowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the SP, spirit under obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, &gt;&gt; ready to be revealed in the last time, &gt;&gt; wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be. You are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. I trust you follow those uh last words and I'm going to going to be dwelling on the seventh verse and I'll be putting it up on the screen in a few moments. God bless you as you have your seats. I'll just have you notice this scripture here first, please. that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth, though be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. This is not the trial, not the trial being much more precious than that of gold. Everybody has trials, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not just your trials. We have all kinds of human natural trials. It's not your trial that's more precious. We want to read the scripture, but the trial of your faith. &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. It's the trial of your faith. If anything seeks to remove you from your faith, &gt;&gt; then God has given special special strength, &gt;&gt; special endurance &gt;&gt; to keep you through that &gt;&gt; and that shall not pre that shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; No weapon that's that's formed against you shall so the the testing of your faith in the revelation that God gave you. Now I will be speaking uh mainly upon that. So not the trial please note that down not the trial just the trial being more precious than gold but the trial of your faith. So I want to refer to some uh things we'll see now uh in this next the message of the anointed ones of the end time. What is faith? Brother Brenham asked that. What is faith? Faith is something that's revealed to you. That is not yet, &gt;&gt; but you believe it will be. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen. So that's that's not yet, &gt;&gt; but you believe it will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; All right, I'll just leave the last slide for a few moments. Faith is not something mentally perceived. It's not something that we imagine. And he said, "Oh, if you could only get this, you'll see the greatest thing you've seen in years." As I studied and as we going to move through the service this morning, uh I thought of, you know, some some things and uh the scriptures full of principles. You know what a principle is? A principle is for example, fire is hot. It was hot yesterday. It was hot a thousand years ago. It'll be hot tomorrow. It'll be hot next year. In the springtime, uh plant life and botney life comes up at the warming of the sun and drawing the earth close. The earth becomes closer to it in its orbit. Uh uh in the spring, things come up. In the fall, things turn color and uh and uh and and and life goes back down into the roots so it won't be destroyed in the winter time. Those are principles. principles. Give and it shall be given to you. That's a law. God loves generosity. Give and it shall be given to you. That's a law. And there are even people who are not believers who are not Christians. They practice that law and and God honors that law. &gt;&gt; Uh faith is a principle. If if a person believes and there are people and brother Brandham said there are people the godly sister will come up and she misses it and a and a maybe even just a street woman a prostitute or whatever a woman of the world will come up and she just gets it. She gets her healing or gets whatever she's asking God for because she believes &gt;&gt; and that's a principle. So this is also a principle that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold. We don't we want to be careful. We don't whine or complain about it. Now uh in the in who is this Melzdc? The scripture, the prophet goes to the scripture, if this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle, we have another one. See, he said we have we have bypassed that to come straight. In fact, is I have this on a on a slide, so I'll I'll have you read it with me. We have bypassed that and I have I've bolded I've made that bold because what we've bypassed is the scriptures Apostle Paul is talking about in first 2 Corinthians 5:1 if this earthly body be dissolved this earthly tabernacle he explains we have another one that's the one you bypassed &gt;&gt; we have another one &gt;&gt; you have a and prophet calls it a theophony body. We have another one &gt;&gt; that we go to &gt;&gt; as this body that you have today and you whatever condition you're in, but you have this body &gt;&gt; and it was formed and nurtured in the womb of your mother and you were issued into this world. And when you were issued into this world, you already had a body &gt;&gt; that was a little baby body that was received by your parents. and uh and and when we leave this life and the and the spirit that came into this body which gave it animation gave it life and movement when that breath is gone if you are a believer you will go to a believer's place &gt;&gt; Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; and you're not going to go there bodyless &gt;&gt; you're going to go there in another body and he said that's the one that you bypass that to come straight from God. &gt;&gt; The attribute, you're an attribute of God &gt;&gt; to be flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just to be flesh, but to be flesh, to be tempted &gt;&gt; and tested by sin like Adam did. But when the testing of his word is over, then we are taken up to this body, &gt;&gt; this other body &gt;&gt; that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the word that it is the word there that we skipped &gt;&gt; to come straight around down here to be tempted and tested. So it is the word that is being tested. It's God's word that is being tested. And this is where I want to uh I want I want to look at three junctions of time and two individuals specifically. And they're strange. You probably never ever heard of these two individuals being uh uh gathered in one service in one sermon. I want to speak about Abraham. And you've heard hundreds of messages on Abraham. And the other one I want to refer to as Mary Magdalene. And perhaps some of you hardly know anything about her. So I looked back and found exactly where she was first mentioned in the scripture and how her life went until she stands outside of the tomb and comes to the sephilar of Jesus. And there's very very much similarities. That was a great junction of time. the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It was a great junction of time when Abraham, the first man that received promise from God of another seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First man, listen folks, first man from the fall of Adam, the first man to receive promise, that kind of promise of a seed &gt;&gt; that will become a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have an inheritance and have a land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And become a nation. that that man Abraham and and we want to see his life. And there's a here's here's the similarity between the two. Now, you might think I'm way out there, but I'll try to bring you into the scene. Both of these individuals, Abraham was without a child. And so, he was waiting, waiting, waiting. And I don't want to labor on it because I want to go into it a little later. But he's waiting, waiting, waiting for the sun. Mary Magdalene along with others, but I want to focus on her. She was waiting, waiting, waiting for as a nation was waiting for a messiah, for the Christ, for you know the Messiah is going to come. Waiting, waiting, waiting. And then the son came. Abraham got the son and she, the Messiah found her. She found the Messiah. They crossed paths and she became a believer. And I don't know, I can tell you, I don't know exactly what joy filled Abraham's heart, but he looked for that son for 25 years. Now he had the son. I don't know how long she looked for a Messiah to come, but he came and now now she has the Messiah. And she she becomes a follower of and and Abraham, his son, is is growing getting older and into his uh youth. And uh and then God calls Abraham, "Give him away. I'm going to take him away. Go up in this mountain that I'm going to tell you and slay your son." &gt;&gt; And Mary Magdalene, she wasn't called on to do that exactly, but God took the son away. and she comes to the sephilar and says, "Where have you taken him that I might go to him?" I want to refer to this as the assay test and it will cover I think everybody's life somewhere along the line. It is the trial of their faith &gt;&gt; that was taking place here. And then I want to come to the body bride of Jesus Christ. In this day, we are not to think that everything is just going to come up roses and everything is just glorious and wonderful. There comes a time where you you just receive this word. You receive this revelation. You receive this message and God becomes so real. Oh, this is so wonderful. And then as time goes on, you everybody encounters someplace along the way. said, "I prayed. It didn't seem to go any further than the ceiling. Where is he? &gt;&gt; Did he hear me? &gt;&gt; Where where's all my friends? Where where's where's all this blessedness? Where's this wonderful the fellowship seems to nothing seems to register anymore?" Do you get my layout? &gt;&gt; Okay. This is where the message is going to go. And the Bible says, "And God spoke to Abraham, and he said,"I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo Sarah, thy wife shall have a son." And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him, and we've had a messenger this time, I sat on the platform myself. When brother Brandham referred to this very scripture and said, "I'll turn my back." He turned his back and looked up in the balcony, not the balcony, but up in the gable end of the hall in Port Al Burnernney, British Columbia, and and detailed a man that was paralyzed and wheeled around and he said, "Isn't that right, Mike?" And pointed down and Mike was sitting in about the third row. And I knew Mike and I knew the man that he was describing. And he tells where the man is. And he says he's in a place called Nanimo. Listen friends, you can't have that kind of indication without saying something supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; There's something from another realm, another place, another world, another dimension. Say, call it whatever you want, but it's not of this earth. It didn't come out of a Bible school. It didn't come out of a out of uh in intellectual things. It doesn't come out of psychology. It's God. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says the Bible says this of the of the scripture. And it came to pass after these things. I'll read that scripture for you. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham. And the word tempt is he was going to grind him. And this is the assay test. How many know what the word assay means? The assay perhaps you you know what it mean? You might know what it means. But in it's very very well known in the mining and in the medical industry they it's an analysis it's an analysis of of something and and it's it's a test in fact is they have today a a test a software test for for those of you that are techies for browsers and and the test is an acid one an acid 2 and an acid 3 and those three different softwares will check browsers and see uh how how they handle uh material coming over the internet. And that that is the acid test for a browser. And in fact is uh we don't need to get into it but that's actually where the term came from in the drug world acid because it was breaking them into another another dimension and and that's why they called the drugs that did that acid. But that's not really what it's about. We're in the true acid test. &gt;&gt; This is the true assay. &gt;&gt; This is the true assay. In the mining industry, they will take and they will take rock, big loads of rock and pour it down into a ball mill. And the ball mill will grind it and grind it and grind it. Not into little pieces, into powder. &gt;&gt; A powder about the texture of household flour. And once it's in ground into powder, there's nothing left. There's no evidence of what it was. And then they put it uh into a in onto maybe tables and trays and whatever more and and and mix it with some acids. And then the acids as they work in this powdered rock and then it begins to show whether it's gold, silver, copper, what quality it is, the purity of it or the impurity of it. And again, you have an acid test and that is the assay and that's what God is doing. Not that God without his profound and infinite knowledge doesn't know, but he's he's giving a man an opportunity. He speaks a promise to him. And the Bible says after these things. So here you'll be able to put yourself someplace after he was called. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we can identify with that. after he'd been called by God to go out and to leave his country or to leave his his associates or to leave his peers or to leave his family whatever it was he was called of God and he Bible says and he went out &gt;&gt; he he left his comfort zone &gt;&gt; and God might be calling even your name today &gt;&gt; to perhaps leave a a comfort zone that we have after he had worshiped because he had worshiped this God he worshiped the true God after he had heard God's promise of a son in a land after going and doing battle to retrieve Lot uh from captivity. &gt;&gt; And it was after Lot and his servants and Abraham's servants had uh had uh trouble between them over the over the pasture land and the feeding of their cattle and their animals and so on. And Lot chose the the well-watered plains of Sodom. He chose that. And Abraham told him to his nephew, "Wherever you go, you make a choice. Wherever you go, I'll go the other direction." And so he chose the well-watered plains. And that's he went and lived in Sodom. It was after the struggle with that. And it was after then when they when the kings came and took Lot and had war and there was quite a number of kings. Abraham, he took the people from his own that had been raised in his own uh uh in his own tribe and went out after him and retrieved Lot. So the Bible says after these things, so I'm telling you what he went after. You've had your battles. You've had your victories. You've had your time of worship. You've heard God call. You've left your maybe your comfort zone and you've moved out and you've you you feel, well, I I'm following along. I worship God. I'm here in church. this morning and perhaps this was very different. And the Bible says, the Bible tells us after his victory with these war and kings, he he went and fought and he had victory and after victory Melzdc, king of Salem appeared. After meeting Melzdc &gt;&gt; and after meeting Elohim, &gt;&gt; HE MEETS GOD IN different forms &gt;&gt; and he meets Melzdc. And that is why it says that he looked for a city in the New Testament. He looked FOR A CITY WHOSE BUILDER and maker was God. And the prophet said HE SAW THE KING OF THAT CITY. &gt;&gt; And so HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE CITY. And John spoke about it AND SAID HE SAW THE NEW Jerusalem coming down. He thought HE THOUGHT THE CITY MUST BE ON EARTH AT THIS TIME CUZ I'VE MET THE KING OF that city. So he was looking FOR A CITY. SO IT'S AFTER ALL OF THESE THINGS. THESE ARE WONDERFUL REVELATIONS, FRIEND. THESE ARE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES. YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME wonderful experience and so I'M GOING TO COME EVEN AFTER THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Following that &gt;&gt; and it was after he met Melzdc after he met and the prophet said Abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose builder and maker was Guad. that prophet knowing that it was somewhere. &gt;&gt; John saw it coming down. But Abraham thought it must be on the earth right then. Why? Because he met Melzdc, the king of it, and he gave him tithe. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; And now I'm coming to I'm coming to a moment of his life that's after all of this. after the grief between Sarah and Hagar and listening to his wife and Sarah said because her womb was closed, take Sarah, take Hagar. And he took Hagar, an Egyptian maid. And we have a ongoing problem with Ishmael and his seed &gt;&gt; ever since. And then Sarah says Sarah said because now Ishmael is making mockery of Isaac when he was being weaned and and this is all after this. He's experienced all of these things. He's now he's got the son. &gt;&gt; The son has come. THE SON OF THE PROMISE. OH, THE GLORIOUS THINGS ARE HAPPENING. He's arrived and now there's trouble in the home and the family. It wasn't THE TRIAL OF THAT PROBLEM. wasn't the trial of LOT'S PROBLEM. IT WASN'T the trial at Lot being down in Sodom or the servants arguing over over the grass IN THE PASTURES. IT WASN'T THAT. THAT wasn't more precious than gold. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUST LIFE. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, folks? &gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUST LIFE. IT WASN'T THAT THE FACT OF HIS JOB OR HE WAS DIDN'T HAVE A TRIAL OF NO money or too much money. He didn't have a problem OF A TRIAL. THOSE WEREN'T THE TRIALS. It was THE TRIAL OF GOD'S PROMISE. WHAT GOD SPOKE &gt;&gt; SAID, I'm going to give YOU THIS. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE PROMISE? WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, &gt;&gt; BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED. WHAT ABOUT THAT PROMISE? SHOULDN'T THAT BE MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD? AND YET the world will KIND OF EMULSIFY, TRY TO, you know, to to uh make that weaken that somehow. AND THE PERSON BECOMES DISCOURAGED AND SAY, "WELL, DOES IT REALLY WE HEAR ALL THIS STUFF AND ALL THESE THINGS?" WHEN YOU HEAR THINGS THAT WILL TAKE AWAY FROM the ferveny of your faith in the promise OF GOD, YOU DENY THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; That's the one you deny. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEM. I HAD A FLAT TIRE IN THE CAR. JUST SAY, "PRAISE GOD. THE TOAST burnt this morning." SO, ANYWAY, WHAT'S the difference? Well, we ran out of this or we ran out of that or we had this kind of problem, THAT KIND OF PROBLEM. THAT'S JUST DAYTODAY THINGS. GOD GOD JUST EXPECTS US TO BULLDOZE THROUGH THAT STUFF. &gt;&gt; That's not worthy of of of affecting our faith. &gt;&gt; And and SO YOU WON'T FORGET AFTER this service. YOU WON'T FORGET IT WAS AFTER THIS AFTER HE WAS CALLED, AFTER HE WAS WORSHIPED, AFTER HE MET MELZDC, AFTER HE WAS AFTER HE HAD A BATTLE IN VICTORIES, AND AFTER HE MET ELOHIM, AND AFTER HE RECEIVED THE SON, AND AFTER ALL OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED, And Sarah saw the Egyptian son Ishmamail, the son of Hagar, mocking, and she says TO ABRAHAM, "CAST THIS BOND woman out." The son of the bond woman will not be part of the son of the free woman. &gt;&gt; And that's quoted IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. THAT'S PART OF YOUR BIBLE. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS QUOTING SCRIPTURE. SHE WAS ACTUALLY initiating scripture. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL, APOSTLE PAUL PICKS IT UP. SAYS THE THE the the bond woman and he likened it with Hagar refers to Sinai and the law. AND WE'RE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW. CAST THAT THING OFF. YOU GOT TO do this and do that and do SOMETHING ELSE. YOU'RE NOT SAVED BY THAT. We may have to do that, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S A LAW IN OUR HOME. THERE'S A LAW. My wife sits back there. I I RESPECT HER. I HONOR HER. NOT BECAUSE there's a law or anything written on the wall says you're married and you can't do this and no one else washes. Brother Bam says when he goes over says he doesn't worry. She doesn't grab him by the His wife doesn't grab him by the tie and don't you have anybody else, you know, wash your socks or something. He wouldn't do that. HE SAID I I love her. &gt;&gt; We love him. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A CERTAIN LAW AND THE LAW IS A LAW OF LOVE. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT GROUND into us. &gt;&gt; So God wasn't trying to get Abraham to love him more. God was testing him to SEE WHAT HE WAS MADE OUT OF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW? BUT WHAT THE TEST YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND THE TRIAL YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ISN'T SOMETHING THAT GOD IS IS BUILDING YOU AND BUILDING A NATURE AND A CHARACTER IN YOU THAT WILL STAND THE TEST. LET'S NOT BE LAX, LUKEWARM, &gt;&gt; HALFHEARTED, &gt;&gt; SPINELESS PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION. THIS WILL THIS THIS GENERATION WILL DEVELOP really weak people. &gt;&gt; We're not interested IN WEAKNESS. WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE STRENGTH THAT GOD GIVES. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE BOLD, not weak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm I'm going to speak because I probably won't speak this again, but I'm going to take my time and and speak it. It was after all of these things &gt;&gt; that God did tempt and to attempt the you and it's only this only has a single meaning really in the Old Testament. Nasaw to test to try to prove to tempt to assay to put to the proof test. And my message this morning is a tried and proven faith. &gt;&gt; We're not here to just develop, you know, uh kind of a fellowship and we're going to have coffee in the in the They wanted to put a coffee where our stairs are. I said, "You're in the wrong place. We're not have Well, all the churches want a coffee bar, not this one. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have coffee and to have some fellowship. We're here to hear the word of God. We're here to worship the Almighty God and we're here to GO OUT OF HERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; But the final testing of Abraham's faith was not for the struggles of life and family, relationships, etc., etc., but rather that he continued to believe the promise of God &gt;&gt; in another season, &gt;&gt; in another form of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. LISTEN FRIENDS BECAUSE EVEN I HAVE THE I have the prophet's words where he SAY SPOKE OF ABRAHAM WHEN Abraham took the son and after all of these things and it came to pass after these things &gt;&gt; that God did tempt Abraham. I wonder perhaps we might come to a place like that. WHY AM I preaching this? that when you come to a place where you think God has ground you out, this isn't a maybe a, you know, jump up and down and dance kind of a message, but I believe it's exactly one that we need. &gt;&gt; This age is so filled with, you know, how do you feel and the feelings God's not interested in how you feel. Right. &gt;&gt; Of course, we're to have joy unspeakable and full of glory, but it comes as a result of a certain thing. Let me carry on. &gt;&gt; And he said, and God said, and God did tempt Abraham and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, behold, here I am. And I want to ask this morning, and I had to write write it further down in my notes by hand. Is God calling your name &gt;&gt; today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do I know he's calling my name? I I I may not hear my name speaking Ed or Mary or Susie or someone else, Bill or someone else." No, it is when something is spoken &gt;&gt; and it's quickened to you inside. And it means more THAN JUST A CASUAL CONVERSATION. YEAH, &gt;&gt; I WAS IN CHURCH THIS MORNING AND THAT WAS MORE THAN JUST A SERMON TO ME. &gt;&gt; I HEARD SOMETHING RESOUNDING WITHIN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S calling your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God knows your name. &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; AND IT MIGHT MIGHT NOT BE JUST BECAUSE I'M MAKING VERY DIRECT PERSONAL, BUT GOD NEEDS TO CALL OUR NAME. &gt;&gt; HE HAS SOMETHING FOR US. HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING SPECIFIC. &gt;&gt; And then you want to answer the way Abraham did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here am I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Take your son to a certain mountain that I will show you, and there I will tell you this place." And he begins to follow. And he knows that he's supposed to offer his son. And God is very specific. Says, "Your son, your only son." &gt;&gt; God was not required regarding Ishmamail in this in this project. &gt;&gt; This your son, your only son. &gt;&gt; That was the son of promise. &gt;&gt; That was not the son of product of the flesh. &gt;&gt; In fact, this it wasn't just a a sexual relationship because they were long past that. IT WAS HOPELESS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAUSED IT. &gt;&gt; AND SO IN A DEAD BODY, &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT AND THE PROPHET brings that out. And I want to bring it out to you today that God God allowed him to see to test his faith even though the son had come from a body that was dead &gt;&gt; and into a womb that was dead. &gt;&gt; And he regarded that God HAD GIVEN LIFE &gt;&gt; OUT OF DEATH. AND HE RAISED HIS BLADE IN HIS KNIFE AND WAS READY TO THRUST IT INTO THE BOSOM OF HIS SON WHEN GOD THEN HELD HIM BACK AND SAID, "Do not hurt THE SON. DO NOT DO THAT." AND THEN GOD SAW IN IN in Abraham's faith &gt;&gt; that Abraham was believing that &gt;&gt; if IF I DO TAKE HIS LIFE, GOD WHO GAVE HIM FROM DEATH IN THE FIRST PLACE RAISED HIM UP AND gave him a resurrection. &gt;&gt; HIS FAITH, FRIENDS, WAS IN THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; HE SAW HIM RESURRECTED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY GIVEN HIM FROM DEATH. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS CALLED YOU FROM DEATH. YES. &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLED YOU FROM DEATH. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU OUT OF DEATH. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANOTHER RESURRECTION? &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU A RESURRECTION NOW. &gt;&gt; THIS BODY IS NOT GOING TO STOP THAT LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE'S ALREADY GIVEN YOU A RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; SURELY HE WILL RESURRECT THIS THIS BODY. WHAT IS THIS BODY? IT'S JUST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHEMICALS THAT COULD BE GROUND UP TO POWDER. SURELY HE WILL GATHER THAT TOGETHER and all the atoms and whatever made THIS BODY AND GATHER IT BACK TOGETHER. THAT'S OUR PROMISE. &gt;&gt; And Abraham, we are children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can see what he had the experience that he had. Glory. &gt;&gt; And as they as he's going with the son, this was the assay test in the in the message victory day. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "So he got up there and tied his hands and laid him upon the altar like that." Little Isaac never murmured &gt;&gt; because he was a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Obedient. See the type of Christ. And he says, "And then when he pulled the knife from his scab, it scabbard and pulled his hair back &gt;&gt; out of his face to take his life." That was Abraham's &gt;&gt; Vday. &gt;&gt; Oh my. When he tested to that VERY LIMIT &gt;&gt; OF HIS ONLY SON. &gt;&gt; He said, notice Vday, Abraham's Vday was on Mount Jeriah. &gt;&gt; It was Mount Mariah, but his Jeriah's the God will provide. Jehovah Gyra, God will provide. And the prophet, I love that where he said it was on Mount Jeriah where God will provide. He knew that God would give it even even Abraham, even the son Isaac ON THE WAY UP. ISAAC and it was one of my first messages when I started in the ministry YEARS AGO SAID, "BEHOLD THE FIRE and the wood. &gt;&gt; Behold the instruments. BEHOLD THE ACCESSORIES. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE MUSIC. BEHOLD THE PEWS. BEHOLD THE SOUND. BEHOLD THE LIGHTS. BEHOLD ALL OF THESE THINGS. BEHOLD THE PREACHERS and the ministry. WHERE'S THERE'S THE FIRE AND THE WOOD. But where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE FOCUS? WHERE'S THE CENTRAL PART? &gt;&gt; WE HAVE CHURCH. WE HAVE WORSHIP. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL THINGS. ALL KINDS OF THINGS, ACCESSORIES, &gt;&gt; BUT WHERE'S THE LAMB? YEAH, &gt;&gt; we want AN HOUR SERVICE. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A NECESSITY. &gt;&gt; We have water IN THE TANK AND BAPTISMS AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SPRINKLE AND PEOPLE THAT DO THIS AND GOD'S NOT INTERESTED IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS. HE ALREADY GAVE A PLAN. HE ALREADY gave a program. EVERYONE BAPTIZED IN THE IN THE SCRIPTURES BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE WAY THESE FOUR WILL BE BAPTIZED TODAY. WHY? NOT BECAUSE IT'S OUR IDEA. IT'S HIS IDEA. And so Isaac is Isaac is saying, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; Where's the central part?" &gt;&gt; AND FRIENDS, WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE PREACHING. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE SINGING and just praying. WE WANT TO HAVE CONTACT WITH GOD. WE WANT TO FEEL AND SENSE THAT HE'S BEING LIFTED UP and honored and the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is BEING LIFTED UP. WHERE'S THE LAMB? I'M A CHRISTIAN. I DRESS RIGHT. I SPEAK RIGHT. I DO ALL THESE THINGS. BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LAMB IS present &gt;&gt; and the lamb is being projected. &gt;&gt; So in that day, Abraham proved to God without a shadow of a doubt his loyalty in Abraham proved to God his faith in him. For he said, "I got this boy when I was 100 years old by believing a promise, and he told me I was the father of nations. If he asked me to take his life, God is able to raise him up from the dead." Woo! My oh, what that ought to make a Presbyterian shout, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God can raise him up again. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass after all of these things, &gt;&gt; and Abraham said, "Behold, I am." And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father. And said, "My father." And he said, "Here am I, my son." And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood." But where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So they went went both of them together. And he said, "Lay," and God spoke when he raised his knife out of the scabbard, ready to plunge it into the boy's bosom, and he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad, &gt;&gt; neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, &gt;&gt; seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. Now I'm going to ask for your undivided attention. I have named this the piercing faith because he pierced through all the elements of the human life. He pierced through until he come. And friends, I'm not preaching at you. I thought very very seriously and even spoke to my wife. Sometimes we're called on to speak things that perhaps we haven't attained to yet. Perhaps I haven't attained to. But I'm standing here today thinking maybe there's somebody here that's going to. Maybe someone else is going to. Maybe one of you young men, one of you young ladies, one of your families, some of your brothers. that you're going to attain to this kind of faith. I pray that I will also but this kind of grinding not too many people survive it and not too many people are even entrusted with it and God crowned him down. He doesn't have a wife or family to support him then he's alone. He's alone with a young lad that he's going to take his life. A young lad that God gave him. And he waited FOR HIM. I WAITED FOR HIM 25 YEARS AND YOU ASKED ME TO take his life. He wasn't whimpering. &gt;&gt; He wasn't complaining. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God Abraham, here I am. Take your son, your only son. Take your entire life, everything that's wrapped, your life is wrapped up in &gt;&gt; and I want you to offer it. And he just ground him down till he came to full surrender. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Full surrender. &gt;&gt; And he finally said, "God gave me what I have. God gave me what I am. And if God even asked me to give it all up and surrender, I would offer it to him because he can give me double portion. He can give me more if necessary. Lay not thy hand upon the son. Now I know that thou fearthst God. And I called it a piercing faith. Please hold your attention because I'm going to describe and show you in the scripture and actually show you in the Hebrew uh and the especially the Greek words, not so much in the Hebrew and the Old Testament, but then we get into the New Testament because now it's after the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. And the Bible tells us this. And others, it's speaking of those in Hebrews 11. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. The Bible tells us of those in Hebrews 11. And I guess perhaps I should just take a moment and read it for you. Uh, I have it here in my notes as well. I feel I just want to read it here now. And others had trial. Hold the word trial. Hebrews 11:36. of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were saw a sunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth. And all of these having obtained a good report. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A good report &gt;&gt; through faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; because they didn't lose their faith in all of these things &gt;&gt; through faith and received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect or be made complete. &gt;&gt; And the trial there is a a trying or approving that which something is tried or proven. It is an experience a trial approved by and tried character. &gt;&gt; A proof of tried worth &gt;&gt; to see what he's worth. See what Abraham's worth. &gt;&gt; He was worth when because God made him the father of nations. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; And then that comes from another word. It is tried ex to made to be made acceptable. &gt;&gt; And that is why the apostle Paul in writing Ephesians could say to the praise of the glory of his grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; TO THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF HIS GRACE WHEREIN &gt;&gt; IN THAT HE HATH MADE US ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. AND THAT IS WHY THE PROPHET OF GOD IN THIS DAY COMES TO THAT SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW THE WORD OF GOD oh my uh you you just pray for me and pray for yourself. One of the scriptures that is used all the time through the prophet WHILE HE'S SPEAKING TO people for the word of GOD &gt;&gt; IS QUICK AND powerful &gt;&gt; and sharper than any TWO-EDGED SWORD. WHAT IS IT? The word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word, the actual THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; NOT THUS SAITH the denomination or the church or the Bible school or the theologian. THUS SAITH THE LORD, THAT WORD IS QUICK AND POWERFUL and sharper than any two-edged sword. BY HEARING THE WORD, FAITH COMES INTO THE HEART. THEN GOD CAN TRY that faith and test that faith. But it says and and and uh the SHARPER THAN ANY TWO-EDGED SWORD piercing piercing piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul AND SPIRIT NOT BODY and soul or body and spirit but soul and spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that WE KNOW THAT THAT SOUL REALM, THAT SOLOULISH realm of all the emotions of of memory and imagination and conscience and affection. Oh my goodness. I tell you what, in this day, we certainly need the word of God to come and divide affection so people know, oh, that's just an affection of my emotional life. BUT THEN GOD GIVES A evidence of when when a person receives that's why I believe in in relationships between young men and young women. You can't get it on the internet friends. &gt;&gt; You cannot find it on the internet. HE DIDN'T SAY WHOSOEVER YOU FIND ON THE INTERNET. THAT IS NOT IT. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen because that is the truth. that only that instrument just as to to excite A PERSON'S AFFECTIONS AND TWIST THE AFFECTIONS OFF OF THE RIGHT WAY. It's the word of God that divides between the soul and THE SPIRIT. IT'LL DIVIDE THAT STUFF off &gt;&gt; and AND BRING A PERSON INTO REALITY WITH someone who's a tested tried word son of God &gt;&gt; OR A TESTED TRIED DAUGHTER of God. Listen to me young people unmarried. That's who you want for a husband or wife. &gt;&gt; Not all of you said amen. &gt;&gt; That's who you want. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to see one who's gone through the mill, &gt;&gt; one who's lived a life, one who's not had everything come their way. &gt;&gt; You want to see one that's grounded in the word of God. You want to see somebody not not not nice eyes and nice this or nice that. That's not it. That's not it. It's one who has a developed a character &gt;&gt; from hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; They've gone through thick and through thin. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GONE THROUGH GOOD TIMES AND THEY'VE GONE THROUGH BAD times &gt;&gt; and still they remain steadfast. Okay. And now here's a point that I I need to make. Says others had trial. And that trial that word is very very important for you to remember. I would like to have had it up on all on the board. That word trial is like a trial by assay. They said by mockings and scourgings and all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of things happen there. But this was an assay. And and furthermore, listen now, it's an assay, a trial experience to have a trial of a thing, to learn by experience. But it came from another word, a derivative of this word. And that word is to pierce. Because God's intention &gt;&gt; of these series of things was to take these people and give them a FAITH THAT WOULD ACTUALLY TRANSPORT THEM. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET IT. TRANSPORT them &gt;&gt; from from this realm &gt;&gt; to an immortal realm. &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY COULD SEE IT. &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY COULD SEE THAT THIS WAS THIS WORLD IS IS NOT THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. WE MAKE LITTLE PHRASES LIKE THAT, but it goes way way beyond that. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And it goes further to pierce. &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; To pierce even between Why am I SAYING THESE THINGS? BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; that's where a lot of people fall away. &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS IS NOT JUST a word that you heard in another church &gt;&gt; or something you read on the internet &gt;&gt; or or something you heard uh you heard. I like that preacher because he doesn't really, you know, it doesn't dig very deep. We want to have a preacher and preaching. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, take the gloves off. &gt;&gt; That kind of preaching. Amen. And tell it THE WAY IT IS. BECAUSE FURTHERMORE, IT'S NOT JUST TO SPEAK ABOUT THOSE THINGS. That's not it. But it's to TELL YOU WHAT THE PURPOSE OF GOD IS &gt;&gt; BY PIERCING TO GIVE A PERSON THE FAITH. FAITH THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE PIERCING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT GOD WANTS to use this God WANTS TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO TRANSPORT US TO ANOTHER LEVEL. AND THAT IS WHY THAT WORD THE trial uh OTHERS HAD TRIAL. WHAT DID THEY HAVE? They had something THAT WOULD TAKE THEM BEYOND all of the natural elements. They had trial that would give them a faith that PIERCED BEYOND THIS LIFE when they had mockings and scourgings and imprisonment and death AND THEY THEY SAW BEYOND the mocking. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have mocking today. &gt;&gt; We have mocking today. &gt;&gt; We have mocking of this word today. &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you, do you have faith that sees beyond that &gt;&gt; that that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't even register with you? &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT GOD DOESN'T EVEN IT'S NOT EVEN IN GOD'S BOOK? &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN IN GOD'S MIND. AND THEY WENT BEYOND MOCKING. THEY WENT TO SCOURGING, PHYSICAL ABUSE, and they went beyond that. THEIR FAITH PIERCED BEYOND. &gt;&gt; And the next word it comes to to take you beyond. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? The word trial. &gt;&gt; Wasn't just an assay test. We don't stop there. &gt;&gt; But it is that the experience that you go through because of what you see penetrates penetrates all these things. moves aside the mocking, moves aside all the all all the uh uh speech and all the accusations. MOVES IT ALL ASIDE. PIERCES, PENETRATES, GOES BEYOND THAT. GOES BEYOND HARDSHIP. OH, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS JOB. KEEP moving straight on. Doesn't matter. I don't get that job. UH MY MY CO-WORKERS, THEY SAY I I'M A FANATIC. I GO OUT OF THIS. It goes beyond that. JUST KEEPS PIERCING PIERCING. WHY PIERCING? BECAUSE GOD WANTS YOU TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FAITH. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PIERCING, YOU REACH AN IMMORTAL STATE. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; isn't that what Apostle Paul says? Yes, &gt;&gt; we sorrow but not as others &gt;&gt; who have no hope &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FAITH THAT they have been received, the faith that they have received takes them beyond &gt;&gt; the natural element of death. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I just told this to brother Miguel the other day. I was right here in this town of Cloverdale and I was a young man with a young family and I had some kind of experience. Could have been a dream. It wasn't a dream because there's no picture. Dreams usually have pictures. My father was 64. He was very youthful. He only had a just a few sprinkling of gray hair. We were taken like brothers often. and my father was going to come up and help me build a house right over here in 180th Street that we lived in for over 20 about 24 years. I said, "I have to put some weeping tile around the basement and uh carpenters are there doing the framing. So, I need to get some material." But I said, "Could you come and help me with the weeping tile?" Yes. He was happy to do that. and he said, "I'll go and get Allan," which was my brother-in-law, "and uh I'll I'll see if he's free, and I'll come." And then I said, "Okay, Dad." Uh my last words to my father on earth was, "I'll see you in the morning." I just didn't know which morning it was. &gt;&gt; I just gave this testimony to brother McU. And that next that night in the morning, I woke up from the bed. I was convulsing in tears. I've never had my tears make the pillow wet in my life except that day. It was early in the morning and all I was the presence of death was there and it was as though my wife had died, my father had died, my sister had died and it I and I woke up and I thought this should be this kind of loss should affect me more. And in the next few moments, it just swept over me like a tsunami wave. And I just broke in two. And I began to sobb. And the bed was shaking. And my pillow was wet. And I awakened from where wherever what state I was in. And I thought that is anyway that's bad. I just, you know, you want to put that out of your mind. And we I was having breakfast. I told my wife, you know, this kind of thing that happened and we waited. Then I went up to the house and my dad didn't come for breakfast and went up to the house, got some materials for the men and my wife drove up the drive and she said, "Uh, Ed, I think you better come. Your father's been taken to the hospital to Vancouver General Hospital. He's unconscious." What happened? And he said, "Well, the the lady in the house found him in the apartment." And I said, "Well, he must have he must have hit his head. Those are my words." And she said, "Well, I don't know, but they've called from the hospital and they going to need his medical medical information." And I said, "Well, I'll go right down." So, I went right down, walked into the Vancouver General Emergency, and a doctor came up. He said, he was a doctor on staff. I said, "I'm the son of Mr. Fred Biscll." And I said, "I understand he's been brought here." I said, "What what happened to him?" He said, "We don't know, but we suspect it's a massive cerebral hemorrhage." And I said, "All right." You know, they said, "He's right here off to my right behind the curtain and it's a busy place as you know." And so I walk behind the curtain and my father's strong, healthy, very strong, breathing, [snorts] his chest heaving up and down. He's totally unconscious, but he had aged 20 years. He aged at least 20 years. And I took his hand and uh I held it. And uh words of the message, prophet's words tell me and we know from science that we have senses that contact this present world. Five senses. And I said, "Father, he can't feel me. He can't see me. the smell and taste that's not there and he can't hear me. And I just said, "God, where is he? Where is he?" Because he's not here in that sense. He's somewhere. And uh I left there. I came home to our little house, which was a old Bible way house. And uh the uh promise box was on the mantle in the living room. And I said I stood in front of that m that promise box and I said, "God, I don't answer. I don't ask you for easy answers, but I need something." So I took a promise, picked it up, said, "In my father's house are many mansions." I said, 'Is that what it is? And I put it back and I went and sat in the chair and the girls were running around and I heard my wife say, "Girls, I think you should come here. I think daddy wants to be alone." And I sat in that chair and without any other thought what I experienced in the morning a few hours earlier with the bed shaking and the convulsing I just broke into just like a whole heart and being spilled out and sobbed of course and it it just overwhelmed me. I won't dwell on that because I'll tell you what else happened than the grace of God without without even asking without any knowledge of it. I lost all sorrow. I lost all feeling it left me. I never cried or I never shed a tear from that day forward. He died a few days later after they did a brain operation. We had to ship him to be had to arrange a funeral. I never shed one tear. I went to the service. The preacher preached a service. I saw my father buried. And from that day to this day, such grace. My daughters got up and sang at his funeral. Friends, I'm not here as a preacher. I'm here to tell you, we've experienced a few things. &gt;&gt; I've experienced a measure of the grace of God. That is absolutely true. &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. And I would say that perhaps I had a little foretaste of faith that penetrates the bed, the unconscious state, the operation, all of this thing, &gt;&gt; the loss of of a loved one. What are you going to do without your father? And we were close as brothers. And it's just taken an instant arranging and getting all the family together and having the service and shipping the body and all that friends. I think the rest of the family, his family is Catholic and they were so filled with of course they would be but I think they thought that I was some kind of strange person because I didn't have the same affection or display of it. It was what was called grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. &gt;&gt; I didn't feel to bring that. I wasn't going to say that. I got to watch my time. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; I would be I would be doing a you an injustice if I didn't come to my second person and I'll go quickly. Mary Magdalene. She appears in Luke the 8th chapter and immediately after it mentions her, Jesus tells the parable and speaks the message of the swer and the seed. So I want to say after for Mary after she had been healed and delivered of demon spirits, seven evil spirits. The Bible said healed. Can you imagine what this woman experienced? She's like any of you women here. She was delivered of demon powers &gt;&gt; and she was there when the great crowds were there. She was there and it was after the people had gathered the Bible says out of every city. She saw that she saw all the multitudes of the early ministry. She hear she could hear not by tape but she could hear by individual by being there of all of the first poll and the people. that would gather around and perhaps she did not realize when she heard about the good ground that she was actually the good ground he was speaking of. &gt;&gt; She perhaps was there the day when Jesus said when they said to Jesus, "Your mother and your brethren are here." And she said, and he said, "My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God and do it." That's in Luke the 8th chapter also where she's first mentioned. And then perhaps she was there when the crowd was there and the woman came through and she was looking because she the Bible says that she attended to Jesus. She and others attended to his needs and so on. And the Bible says and ministered to him. She may well have been there when when he turned around said, "Who touched me?" She saw these things. I'm giving you a bit of her life. She saw people perhaps like you. I'll refer to you. She saw the people. She'd been in the She's seen the great wonderful times around the altar service. You've seen it. You've seen people delivered. You There's people sitting here. You've seen their lives changed. You know, they've been changed. We've seen what happened at SFU. And we've seen these that have been baptized, 12, 13 of them out of the Simon Fraser University. And those of our own congregation have been uh in a lukewarm backsliden state. and God moves on them. Friends, we've seen that. &gt;&gt; What are we seeing? WE'RE SEEING THE LIVING JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I just wish I wish that God would give me and give you and give us time. I I just need to take a little bit of time &gt;&gt; if you don't mind, friends. &gt;&gt; She she saw all these things and she was perhaps there when the bread was multiplied. Give ye them to eat. They said, "We have no more but five loaves and two fishes except except they go and buy meat for all this people." But then I want to go quickly after she had seen all &gt;&gt; after she had MINISTERED TO JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT SOME FOLLOWER, NOT SOME MESSAGE BELIEVER. She actually MINISTERED TO THE CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. and she sees the crucifixion and all the things that took place. And then here's where my message title actually came from. And the first day of the week cometh Mary. Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark under the sele and seeth the stone taken away from the sephiler. Then she runth and comes to Simon Peter and the other disciple which happened to be John whom Jesus loved and saith unto him, they've taken away my Lord. They've taken away the Lord out of the sequel, and we know not where they have laid him. I want to go to John's report now of this. And as yet they knew not the the scripture. And the Bible says of her in John's gospel, "And then the disciples went again as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead. And then the disciples went away again to their own house. Peter and John came." Mary was there first and she sees the stone rolled away from the sephiler. And Mary stood without the sephiler weeping. Her emotions are stirred. She's weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the sephiler and sees two angels. She doesn't run AWAY AND SAY, "I SAW TWO ANGELS. I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE." Now her grief goes beyond seeing angels. sitting and one on the at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had laid. And they say unto her, "Woman, why weepest thou? Congregation of Cloverdale Bible way, please put yourself back here. &gt;&gt; Put yourself &gt;&gt; in this scene." &gt;&gt; And I have a reason for saying that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they say unto her, "Well, why weepest THOU?" AND SHE SAID UNTO THEM, "Because they've taken away my Lord." She had WAITED FOR HIM, RECEIVED HIM, HAD ALL THE GLORY OF SEEING THESE MIRACLES AND MARVELOUS THINGS AND THE MESSAGE COMING AND HEARING WORDS THEY'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE. DID YOU HEAR THAT? SURELY THIS IS THE CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD. OH, NOTHING COULD AFFECT THAT. And now &gt;&gt; he's gone. And he doesn't just disappear. He goes in degrees and they take him and bind him. Surely he's going to loosen these things. Surely he's going to overcome this difficulty. Then they accuse him. And all these accusers come in. SURELY GOD'S GOING TO SMITE THEM. But he doesn't. SURELY GOD'S GOING TO INTERVENE. THIS IS HIM. THIS IS THE MESSIAH. THIS IS THE CHRIST. I'VE HAD THE REVELATION. Now the death, the crucifixion, nothing happens. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Everything they believed in IS DETERIORATING AND FALLING in ashes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; But she had a faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please get me. She had a faith that penetrated. &gt;&gt; Move that aside. I don't care what they say. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF ACCUSATION. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT LIES THEY TELL ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; I HAD A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AND HER FAITH WAS BEING TRIED. &gt;&gt; BUT HER FAITH WAS HOLDING STEADFAST. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A PENETRATING FAITH. IT WAS A PIERCING FAITH AND CARRIED HER OVER AND SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST ONE TO HEAR JESUS speak &gt;&gt; an immortal body. &gt;&gt; Immortality speaking to a mortal the first one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's he say? doesn't say to her, "You're a wonderful woman." Said, "Marry, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's all. Marry." &gt;&gt; He was standing there. She thought he was the gardener. &gt;&gt; He was standing there when she was talking talking TO THE ANGELS. SHE SAID, "THEY'VE TAKEN HIM AWAY." and she turns and sees him, SAYS, "TELL ME WHERE YOU'VE TAKEN HIM THAT I MIGHT go to him." [sighs and gasps] Friends, I'm talking about that's the kind of faith the believer has. That's the kind of faith this message produces. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messages that you are hearing. That's where God intends you to go. THE FAITH THAT WILL PENETRATE THE 20TH CENTURY, THE 21ST CENTURY, ALL OF THE GIMMICKS AND THE GADGETS AND ALL OF THE SEXUALITY AND ALL OF THAT NONSENSE AND ALL OF THIS FILTH AND ALL OF THIS VILE GENERATION. YOUR FAITH WILL PENETRATE ALL OF THAT AND BRING YOU VICTORIOUS TO THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S GOD'S PLAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH THIS STUFF. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH WHAT PEOPLE SAID. SHE NEVER REFERRED TO WHAT SOMEBODY SAID OR WHO SAID this or WHO SAID THAT. WHO GIVES A CARE WHO SAID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is instruction. You won't hear it again from me. &gt;&gt; I tell you, in the name of the Lord, leave that stuff out. &gt;&gt; Set the DOOR ON IT. &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE IT IN YOUR HOUSE. It'll only take you down. I'm pointing it to two people that refuse to let it affect them. &gt;&gt; He said, "WE DON'T CARE." LIKE ABRAHAM, IF I EVEN PLUNGE THIS KNIFE IN HIS BODY, GOD WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO ME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KIND OF FAITH THAT CARRIED him over &gt;&gt; to be a father. &gt;&gt; In fact, is you're of his seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith seed. and Mary, I'm preaching to you. I'm preaching to everyone. I'm preaching to my wife and my family. I'm preaching to you families. I labored over this for several weeks that you give him. He gave this message. I was in such confusion about the godhead, about baptism, about serpent seat, ALL OF THESE THINGS. THIS ONE SAYS THAT AND THIS PREACHER SAYS THAT AND SOMEONE ELSE SAYS SOMETHING. So what is it? It wasn't sincerity I needed. I had that. &gt;&gt; It wasn't desire I needed. I had that. &gt;&gt; What I needed was to have faith &gt;&gt; to penetrate through all that. &gt;&gt; And even without me knowing, God has given you given me. Look what you've gone through. LOOK AT THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD. Think about families or whatever and emotions and all the connections and everything else &gt;&gt; and you go beyond it. You penetrate beyond it. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know you say within yourself and there's something deep within you saying this message is more than this. This message is more than that. This message is more than what people say it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. faith that would take them over. &gt;&gt; Faith that would go beyond. &gt;&gt; And I want to go beyond. &gt;&gt; You can have this world. &gt;&gt; You can HAVE ALL THIS VILE PERVERSION AND SIN. YOU CAN HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD'S HEADED that way BECAUSE THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE, HE DESIGNED everything that direction. I'm closing right now. I just say, "Where are all the multitudes?" I so identify with Mary when they were bringing all this rot and filth and viol vile accusations. She could have said, "WHERE ARE ALL YOU MULTITUDES? &gt;&gt; Where are all you people that were healed? &gt;&gt; WHERE ALL YOU PEOPLE THAT FED OF THE BREAD AND THE FISHES? &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; Where are all YOU THAT WERE HEALED?" AND HE SENT HIS WORD AND HEALED every one of them. &gt;&gt; Where all you people that were healed? &gt;&gt; See, friends, it has to go way beyond that. even getting healed and even seeing a miracle and even eating of miracle bread that doesn't keep you in the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a FAITH THAT GOES BEYOND THAT. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it, folks? &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I won't take the time, but I have a whole series of quotes. And brother Brandham says to the people and he talks about the two on the way to Emmas, just give me these few moments. And he said, "If they only knew who he was, they were talking right with him and they were eating with him and didn't know who he was." And friend, and I'm saying and friend to you today. I'm not here to preach a sermon. I'm here to bring these as a reality to today. Brother Ram talks about the two in the way to Amaze. He comes up 2,000 years and he says, "And today, that's as true as it could be today. That's as true as I'm standing on this platform that the resurrected Jesus Christ is right in this building." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't tell you more purposefully. I couldn't tell you with more uh determination and fervent of zeal in my heart that Jesus Christ who said marry that Jesus Christ who stood with the prophet of God, that Holy Spirit, [snorts] that very pillar of fire is right in this building today. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO BE THE SAME BECAUSE HE SAID HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY. TODAY. &gt;&gt; EVERYONE SAY TODAY. &gt;&gt; TODAY. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; We're not WORRIED ABOUT THE FOREVER RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT WORRIED about the past. WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME JESUS WHO SAID, "Mary &gt;&gt; knows your name." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Jesus, do you have something for me?" &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell him my name is Ed. &gt;&gt; He knows it. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's the matter with healing today? Somebody sick here? somebody didn't need a healing. Here's a prophet who saw thousands of them. That's the problem with healing today. They fail to recognize &gt;&gt; that he's right by you. I either have to believe that &gt;&gt; I have to chuck this Bible away. You're right here. If we had faith that could penetrate, you don't have to see them with these eyes because these eyes can tell you all kinds of things that aren't true. Right. &gt;&gt; But I'd sooner to a prophet &gt;&gt; that penetrated on a regular basis and have him tell you, "Oh, if you could only realize he's right beside you. &gt;&gt; He is right beside you." Not your theophony or something else, but he right. He he told Pentecostal people interdenominational at a big convention and you Pentecostal people he said if you could only realize he said if you could realize what is what is here he said a a revival a move of God would break out he said you wouldn't be able to stop &gt;&gt; said if you could hear and recognize that it's God's promise And I'm closing with this. This so touched me. I wanted to touch you. A woman stood in front of brother Brandham, Sarasota or I'm sorry, San Fernando, California. And he and he talks about he keeps the woman in the whole prayer line standing there and he begins to talk about John the fourth chapter and the woman at the well and perhaps 15 20 minutes and I'm only taking two or three 15 20 minutes he talks about the woman at the well a Samaritan and then he says he says to her I wonder if you ever thought that if you could stand where that woman stood. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wouldn't that be wonderful?" &gt;&gt; He says to her, "You always thought it would be wonderful." Then he goes from a suggestion, "I wonder if you've ever thought that. Wouldn't it be wonderful to stand where that woman stood?" And then he takes her thought. He says, "You always thought that would be wonderful." And he says, "If you only knew, my dear sister, you're standing in that same place." &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; when I said a while ago, you could put yourself back there. This kind of faith, &gt;&gt; this kind of faith &gt;&gt; literally [clears throat] transports. &gt;&gt; You're back there. The same Christ is there. I'm at the seeler. I'm I'm there with Mary. I'm seeing the angels. And then the same Christ is in another form. FAITH THAT CAN SEE HIM IN ANOTHER FORM. Does it make any difference if I say this is him? &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; Hollywood can't make a movie. This is not just a classic. &gt;&gt; THEY TAKE A CLASSIC book and and and make a hero and and they search all over the world to FIND SOMEBODY WHO COULD ACT THE MAIN PART. GET HIM TO SAY THIS RIGHT THING AND to look the right way and and to pour himself INTO A CERTAIN MOLD OF THE CHARACTER of the book. &gt;&gt; And God says, "That's not enough. I'll send you my spirit &gt;&gt; and my SPIRIT WILL COME INTO you &gt;&gt; and you will BE A DIFFERENT KIND of a person &gt;&gt; and you will NOW SPEAK THE WAY I SPEAK &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WON'T BE YOU. It'll be me in you that'll be doing the TALKING AND YOU'LL SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, NOT ACCORDING TO YOUR EYES. YOU'LL SEE THINGS ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE IT'LL BE me in you. And the APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "THIS IS THE GREAT MYSTERY. Christ in you, the hope of glory." says, "If you only knew, dear sister, [snorts] you're standing at the same place." He says, "You're aware that you're aware as a believer now that something's going on. And just since I turned this way and started talking, a real sweet, humble feeling has come over you. That is right. Cuz between you and I, &gt;&gt; you probably never seen the picture of it. That light &gt;&gt; is just milling between you and I. Oh my dear beloved friends, if you only knew Cloverdale Bible Way or whatever name, whatever church you come from or whatever it is, please hear these words, that same Christ. And it's a preacher's duty. It's my solemn responsibility to create this kind of atmosphere and let the Holy Spirit bring it as such a reality that you'll leave this place and say, "I I may not have that, BUT I WANT THAT." &gt;&gt; I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Though others don't follow you, I'm going to go with you. I don't care what they say. All I know is you touched me. You spoke to me. You called my name. And nothing nothing on this earth can ever change that. No kind of difficulty. And anything that tries to tamper with my faith, I'll penetrate straight through it with the faith that you've given me, I'll penetrate straight through it. This faith is sharp because it came this faith came from the word of God which is so SHARP IT PIERCES BETWEEN EVEN THE soul and you'll carry me through &gt;&gt; to my place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you my precious friends. God bless you. Don't let the world manhandle this blessed word. &gt;&gt; Don't let the man handle it. Don't let somebody try to dissect it &gt;&gt; and hand it to you. Let the Holy Spirit now finish his work in this service. Perhaps, Brother Ryan, if you would come, please. And we'll pray. Lord Jesus, I've been rather long. I just ask that you will take over, that you will say the things that should be said, that you will speak to the heart. man looks on the outward, but you said to Samuel, "Oh, God looks on the heart." And now we've had a message, oh God, that your messenger has said over and over and over again, this is his appearing. You have appeared. And now, Lord, you've even you've even come to us. You've come, oh God. I do not I do not ask you to explain it any further. I don't need it to be explained, but my faith believes it. I believe it. I pray that you will bless this congregation of people, visitors that are here that have been kind to perhaps sit and listen. I pray that you will touch every heart and every life. And now those that are going to be baptized. Oh holy one of Israel, &gt;&gt; I pray you'll hover over this tank of water. I pray that as each one is baptized, they will also be filled with the Holy Spirit that their life they will have a transforming experience in their life. In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit this congregation to you and the words that have been spoken now be glorified. Amen. I wonder if we could sing silently now. Uh what what number is that, please? Open my eyes. Would you like to stand with me, please? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And those that are going to be baptized, if you'd like to go and we'll have the baptismal immediately thousand [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] Silently [singing] now [music] I wait for thee [singing] to [music] see &gt;&gt; as a prayer now my eyes [singing] [music] [music] silently now once again silently I wait [music and singing] for thee. My God will [music] his will. Open [singing] my eyes. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Open my ears that I may [music] hear. Voices [singing] of truth thou sendest [music] clear. And while [singing] the rain on [music] my ear, everything else [music] will disappear. [singing] Silently now I pray [music] for [singing] thee. Pray my God I will to see. [music] Open [singing] my eyes. Spit [music] [singing] divine. [music] Open [singing] my mouth and let me hear [music] [singing] the warm truth everywhere. [music] Open my heart [singing] and let me [music] prepare love with [singing] my children [music] to share. Silently [singing] now I wait for thee. [music] Pray [singing] my God thy will [music] to see. Oh [singing] my eyes. [music and singing] Join me. I say open mine eyes. Open [music and singing] my eyes. Me [singing] [music] [music] [singing] everyone now. [music and singing] Open my eyes to [music] be spine. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful &gt;&gt; to be able to express something [music] silently? Now I wait for thee. Ready my God I will [music] to see. Open [singing] my eyes [music] [music] with the woman at the well. I have. You have. [music] God sent you a messenger with a personal message. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Ben. Personal message to us. We don't want to read about her being back there. But she's that one that was with her. He said he's not a liar. He said, "You're there and he's here." I felt if I could get out of the role of being a [music] preacher, if I could get out of the role of being someone behind the pulpit, if I could only get the people to see that. If I could only see it, things we've [music] prayed for, things we've cried out to God for would begin to take [music] place. He said, "If you can recognize this," he said, "A revival would break out. &gt;&gt; A moving quad would break out." &gt;&gt; He said, "That you wouldn't be able to stop." &gt;&gt; I say, "God, do it. &gt;&gt; Take us, OH GOD, MOVE IN OUR HEART. MOVE IN MY HEART. Move in your heart. AND HELP US TO BELIEVE. HELP US TO SEE. HELP US TO GO BEYOND THIS flesh and the weakness and the frailty and all the failures. Have we failed?" WE'LL ALL SAY WE FAILED. WE DON'T WANT TO SAY that right now. We want to SAY DO YOU BELIEVE? YES, WE ALL BELIEVE. [music] &gt;&gt; I believe what you said, brother. Believe that it's here. It's calling my name. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Continue to talk, Lord Jesus. You that stood just outside [music] behind Mary. You that stood and you watched Abraham take over. You You've been with us. You've seen everything. You've seen us in our joyous times. And you you've seen us when we've had maybe family and friends together and we have such a a nice time. It's not that you want to have a special time with us. Make it this morning, Lord. Make it this morning. Soon after the baptisms, the people will be going. I ask that you'll take this afternoon. Oh God of Israel, God of the prophets, God of Elijah, God of Moses, God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ, God of the prophet of God at this age. &gt;&gt; You're the God of William Brham. You're the God of Elijah. You're the God of this people. You're the God that we worship. &gt;&gt; There is no other God. &gt;&gt; You're the God of truth. You're the God that's made promises. &gt;&gt; You're the God of the eternal realm. You're the God that has spoken to us. You've spoken to us and told us about the two worlds. You've spoken us, oh God, and call us out of that realm, from that realm. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. I ask you to have your seats for a moment. A little chorus we know. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill it up. Fill [music] my cup. I [music] lift it up. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; and his thirsty [music] my [singing] soul out of heaven [music] till [singing] I walk no more [music] till and make me. [music] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what each one of us won in the baptismal tank. We have brother Alex, sister Katie, Sister Lesie. They're here in the waters of baptism for one reason, one reason alone, that the Holy Spirit would come and fill them up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we heard this morning about faith. We wouldn't even know what faith was unless faith was brought through Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That piercing faith that we heard about today. And how did sister Lesie come to to the waters of baptism? How does she have her two children standing in in these waters? is because another man was given a message and he carried it to them &gt;&gt; and gave them the message rapture. Is that right, Lesie? &gt;&gt; And and the church age book &gt;&gt; two books. Okay. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we saw a heart turn &gt;&gt; and we've seen two children's hearts turn &gt;&gt; and and their daddy is not here or Leslie's husband's not here. &gt;&gt; But God did a wonderful thing by just coming to church. Brother Murphy and Sister Lesie were telling me today &gt;&gt; that he would be one uh smoking cigarettes here and at a pack a day and two packs in China a day. But by hearing the word of God and the washing of the water of the word, it took that sovereignly away from him. And sister Leslie has talked to her husband on the telephone. He's in China today. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is a great day for our family." &gt;&gt; And I want to thank the Lord that this is a great day for Sister Leslie, would you like to say? &gt;&gt; I know today this is a very important day for me and my family. So I'm so thankful to the Lord that the message of Abraham preached &gt;&gt; so that our blind can see &gt;&gt; and our deaf can hear &gt;&gt; so that we can escape from the denomination of bondage. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Sister Lesie. I was reading this morning in the Bible &gt;&gt; and in Isaiah 30:18 &gt;&gt; and the Bible says that in that day &gt;&gt; the deaf shall hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. The meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, &gt;&gt; and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel. I think we can rejoice because I say that blind eyes do see, the deaf ears do hear, and a faith is still alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, let's leave. Why don't you stand right over here, children? You stand right there and you hold your wrist right here like on your wrist. You hold this right here like this. That'll help me. All right. All right. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Truly, we can say it's manifesting time. The fruits are on the vine and this lovely one is coming in please. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've opened Sister Leslie's eyes. You've given her ears to hear. Lord, we rejoice in what you're doing in her heart. What you're doing in her children and her husband's life, Lord. No man can do this. But it's the Holy One of Israel. It's our lovely Lord Jesus Christ. The one that's present here in this baptism. I pray God you fill sister Lesie with the Holy Ghost. Lord, I pray that those that are around here will see the Lord. Make her life a witness and a test. Bless her and her husband. Lord God, we're so thankful for what you've done. Baptize her with the Holy Ghost and fire. Lord, let her testimony so rain that Jesus Christ is alive and well. Bless her now Lord. Let the dove descend and let the glory of God fill her heart in Jesus name. Sister Lesie, by your desire, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your personal savior, I baptize you in true Christian love in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Lee. [applause] Glory, glory, glory. It's Katie, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Katie, would you like to say anything? &gt;&gt; You're fine. Well, she she told me, she said, "I come to church and and to see the people and to see what God is doing amongst this church. I want to be a part of that." &gt;&gt; Amen, Sister Katie. And God grant you desire your heart. God will fill your soul. Put your hands. &gt;&gt; Here's a young lady, Father. &gt;&gt; She's spoken from her heart. She's seen a life in a people. She saw God in this church, not in a building, Lord, but living in flesh. And that's the God that she's thirsting for that will dwell within. There will be a power that lays within her soul. &gt;&gt; God, I pray for Katie. &gt;&gt; You'll give her such strength. Lord, to her friends. Speak of this glorious message. This Jesus Christ, the one that she has seen in flesh. May I come and dwell in her flesh Lord &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; And sister Katie by your desire and confession that Jesus Christ is your personal savior I baptize you in true Christian death in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call Alex my little man. Amen. Alex saying the same thing. Coming to a church, witness Jesus Christ amongst the people. And all I believe what Alex said to one of the people, he said, "All I want I want to meet God. &gt;&gt; I want more of God." &gt;&gt; How old are you, Alex? &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; 11. My what I would have given to be 11 standing in the waters of baptism. &gt;&gt; I know you want more of God, brother Alex. I know your desire. We went through salvation. Now Jesus Christ is your savior and your repentance. Now the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. And brother Alex, your desire will be fulfilled and he shall fill you with the Holy Ghost. Let's pray. Grab your hand there. Here's a little man standing in the waters of baptism. &gt;&gt; Maybe not understanding at all, but having a great desire to walk in the fullness of your word. I pray God you'll give Alex such boldness. I pray that he'll be a strength to the family. I pray that his life would be a dedicated life, Lord. that he'll find a secret place alone with God, that the scripture will come alive to him, that the boldness of the lion will be his portion, this glorious line of the tribe of Judah that have prevailed. Lord, anoint fill our dear brother Alex, we pray in Jesus name. And brother Alex, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your savior, I baptize you in true Christian love. &gt;&gt; In the name of our Lord, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, Lord, Brother Lee, it's worth it all, isn't it? Brother Lee that I believe gave him the books and here he is rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Put it all together. Brother Murphy witnessing 10 years ago to brother Lee. Brother Lee, Lord gets a hold of you. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden Lesie and two children are in the baptism. &gt;&gt; Brother Johnny, which is their father, he's not far behind. &gt;&gt; When he comes back, he wants to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's a precious soul, Sister Melissa. God bless you. Amen. I know sister Melissa since a little girl. Real cough. Melissa real cough. Then one day, of course, as time would go on in life, she's gone on her way. Got married. All of a sudden, the Lord started to get real real to you, didn't you? Says Melissa. Just happened to be preaching that morning. and I was in seeing another brother in the office and and I had a tap on the door and and they knew that I was seeing this brother. I didn't know exactly what what was happening and they said, "Well, there's a sister out here that needs prayer." And brother Andy's just happened to be walking by the office door. And I said, "A sister that she wants prayer." And I come around the corner, of course, I see Sister Melissa. I said, "Well, it's not just a sister. This is Sister Melissa. I've been away for how many years? nine eight years and all you wanted to make sure is that the blood would cover your sins and brother Andy's we had the pre uh pleasure to pray sister Melissa &gt;&gt; and God has been dealing with you service service and you just want to put the past behind and go on with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you want to say anything sister I don't know what I can say. Thank you. Just doesn't seem to be enough. I just thank the Lord for his grace and his mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would help me by putting That's it. That's how we're going to do it. Okay. All right. Let's pray. Father, we stand here. I believe in your August presence. [snorts] I believe your presence is confirming the word of God that we heard this morning. And I just pray Lord that as Sister Melissa has bass in the presence and the word of God that it will become alive to her. Lord, what can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; What can make me whole again? nothing but the bleeding word, &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus. And father, she's standing here. She wants wanting to make a commitment and a stand to stand in the waters of baptism and to testify. Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm a believer &gt;&gt; and I'll stand for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'll live the life that's worthy of the gospel of Jesus. I desire God a a refilling of the Holy Ghost. I pray Lord that you will so move &gt;&gt; in Melissa's life Lord that not only her husband will be affected but all around her will be affected Lord I pray that you'll give her such a peace that passes all understanding that Lord the shalom will be her portion in Jesus name and sister Melissa by by your desire to be identified with Jesus Christ in his death burial and resurrection ction and testifying that Jesus is your savior, your lover, your redeemer, your bridegroom and friend. I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] It was a great thing. Why don't we stand? We're going to be dismissed right now. We'll have brother [music] Brother Tim Dodd dismisses in prayer. In just a moment, we're going to sing this [music] and and don't don't sing it if you you listen to the words. It was a great thing that [music] he did for me. Maybe you've had wonderful experiences. But after perhaps today, this morning, as I've been going over it, while I've been sitting there, after all these wonderful things that have happened in the past, perhaps he wants to sit down with you, talk to you today, and say some different things. Keep your heart open, keep your keep your ear open for it, okay? that he did [music] for me. It was a great thing [music] when he set me free.

If you think I'm fanatic, just [music] don't see me on the other side. Going to turn loose over there. Let's pray. [music] Wonderful heavenly father, what a great thing that you have done for us. Lord, just so reveling and feasting on the word that you have spoken this morning that zeroed us in, Lord, that it's not just your desire to bring us out of a world of sin and leave us in the humanity of frailty, but Lord, you do grind and assay that down, Lord, through the trials of our faith to take us beyond our humanity into the supernatural realm that we were meant to dwell in. Oh, how great thou art, oh God. And we desire that, Lord, as hard as it was to be birthed from the world to the new birth, yet take us further, Lord, to be birthed from this realm to another realm, from mortal to immortality, from this body to another body, Lord. We want all of it. That's our confession this morning. We want all of it. No matter what it takes, Lord, no matter what we have to go through, and we might have to go through some hard times, [music] Lord, let the trial of our faith bring forth that realm that you have for us in our lives. Oh God, we thank you for what you've done in these lives this morning in the waters of baptism. [music] It's a great step, oh Lord, a great confession. Thank you, Father, for what you did in every life in this service. [music] Thank you, Father, for what you did for those that are watching and will watch on the internet. We are sure that your word will not return to you void. So, as we go our way, we go in expectation. [music] We go joyously. We go not caught up in the human emotion of the event, [music] but we go being moved into a greater depth and a greater joy of our salvation [music] in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father, for this time we've had in your presence, [music] the time of prayer, the time of worship, the time around your word. We pray you'd restore brother Biscll's strength and Lord, you' just pour in abundantly as he has labored in your word. And Lord, we just commit our ways to you as we go this afternoon, whether here [music] to or to other meetings. We commit it all into your hands for your glory in the name of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. The service is dismissed. Shake hands with one another as you go in [music] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. Hey. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
