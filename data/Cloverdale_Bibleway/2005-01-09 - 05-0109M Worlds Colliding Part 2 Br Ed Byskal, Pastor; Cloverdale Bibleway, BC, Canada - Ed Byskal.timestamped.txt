[11:17] [Music]
[11:18] Amen. We've got a number of prayer
[11:19] requests this morning. I'm ask brother
[11:21] Ricardo, brother Ricardo, if you'd come
[11:23] and open the service this morning in a
[11:25] word of prayer.
[11:28] Sister Dorothia. His note here says, "I
[11:30] want to thank and praise God for
[11:33] protecting me after I hit an ice patch
[11:36] and other car and I collided head on and
[11:38] we both were not hurt."
[11:42] Amen. The Keer family would like to
[11:45] thank the Saints for their prayers and
[11:47] labors of love for Mark's funeral. It
[11:51] was a tremendous testimony for family
[11:54] and relatives alike.
[11:56] And uh want to remember in prayer this
[11:59] morning, continue to remember the Keer
[12:01] family. There's a
[12:04] request from uh brother Gary and sister
[12:07] Lisa St. John in Orlando with Samuel.
[12:10] He's got a bad respiratory infection
[12:12] again. They're requesting prayer for
[12:14] him.
[12:16] Uh Sister Sheila is requesting prayer
[12:18] for brother Peta, uh who's at home with
[12:21] a swollen left foot from slipping in the
[12:23] snow. Um, Sister Roxan
[12:28] um says, "My dad said to thank everyone
[12:32] for their prayers and that he
[12:33] appreciated them. Please continue to
[12:34] remember him in prayer as he's in
[12:37] extreme pain today and we're believing
[12:39] for a complete deliverance."
[12:42] Uh, and I want to continue to thank
[12:44] everyone for prayers for my dad. He's at
[12:46] home and uh, he's doing much better.
[12:51] And uh we just appreciate all of your
[12:53] prayers and the thoughts.
[12:56] Um
[12:57] brother Ernie called last night from
[12:59] Indonesia
[13:01] and he was standing outside the airport
[13:03] and said there must have been a hundred
[13:05] ambulances in the area. He said the
[13:08] devastation and the hardship on the
[13:09] people is beyond comprehension. So we
[13:12] want to remember
[13:14] those that are suffering from uh a tidal
[13:17] wave. Also, Brother Luis called from
[13:20] Argentina this morning. He asked that we
[13:22] greet the congregation. They've been
[13:23] blessed by the messages they've received
[13:26] and uh we want to continue to remember
[13:28] them in prayer as well. Amen. How many
[13:30] have a need they want to be remembered
[13:31] before the Lord as we go to prayer. If
[13:34] you're listening in over the internet
[13:35] hookup or over the phone lines, you just
[13:38] lift your need, whatever would be before
[13:40] the Lord as well. Amen. Brother Ricardo,
[13:44] [Music]
[13:47] let's bow our heads.
[13:50] Heavenly Father,
[13:53] we just want to slow down, Lord.
[13:56] We want to thank you, Lord God. We don't
[13:59] want to get in any repetition
[14:01] of raising our hands, Lord God, or when
[14:05] the song leader says something, Lord
[14:07] God, but we want it to come straight
[14:08] from our hearts. We want to praise you,
[14:11] Lord God. Take us out of any type of
[14:13] formalness, Lord. Take anything away
[14:16] that's not of you, Lord, and let it come
[14:18] straight from our souls. For you said,
[14:20] Lord Jesus, whatever we have need of is
[14:22] already there. So, we're asking, Lord
[14:24] God, that our hearts would rejoice
[14:26] knowing that you're the one who put it
[14:27] there in the first place. Father God,
[14:30] there's many prayer requests, many
[14:31] needs. You know, every single one of
[14:33] them, and I can't remember them, Lord,
[14:35] but you saw them, they were pinned down,
[14:36] Lord God. Maybe the ones who are here,
[14:38] the ones who are at home sick, the ones
[14:40] over the internet, Lord, you know our
[14:42] every need. So we ask you, would you
[14:44] just come and would you touch it? Would
[14:46] you touch us here, Lord God, from the
[14:48] musicians to the song leaders to the
[14:50] minister, Lord God, we all have needs,
[14:52] Lord God. I have needs, Lord Jesus. We
[14:55] all come up short, but Father God, you
[14:57] said you'd be the finisher of our faith.
[14:59] So we're asking you, would you pour out
[15:00] abundantly and what our hearts receive
[15:02] it, Lord? We love you, Lord God. And we
[15:05] just want to tell you we need you more
[15:07] than ever. We need you now, Lord God.
[15:10] Would you come on the scene, Father God?
[15:12] Would you do that work, Lord God, that
[15:14] maybe our mind says impossible, but what
[15:16] we know that you said that if we ask, we
[15:18] shall receive. We ask you just put the
[15:21] minister out of the way, Lord God. Be
[15:22] with us today. Slow us down, Lord God,
[15:25] and give us revelation upon the words
[15:27] that are spoken. We need you, Lord. We
[15:29] love you, and we commit this day before
[15:31] you. In your blessed name we pray. Amen.
[15:38] You may be seated.
[15:50] Got a lot of announcements here this
[15:52] morning.
[15:54] And uh
[16:00] we're not going to have a service
[16:01] tonight and uh a lot of reasons. I uh I
[16:05] know the roads in the US and in the
[16:08] valley we were out uh
[16:11] just out even towards Alder Grove
[16:12] yesterday. There's a lot of blowing snow
[16:14] across the road and uh there's snow
[16:17] predicted again for tonight apparently.
[16:19] And uh you know some of you young young
[16:24] bucks may say, "Hey man, I can drive
[16:25] through the snow." But you got to
[16:26] remember that uh there are some older
[16:30] people who maybe uh don't uh have an
[16:33] easy time as you do and not everyone has
[16:36] got as reliable transportation and uh
[16:39] brother Lance has a message on his heart
[16:41] and we want to make sure that we don't
[16:43] have the church half empty when he's
[16:45] speaking and want to make sure that
[16:46] we've got everybody here to hear it. So,
[16:49] we just uh
[16:51] um I know that this the uh I5 is
[16:55] extremely slip slippery and um and it's
[16:58] just not safe to drive. So,
[17:01] um so there's not going to be any um
[17:04] service tonight, but you can uh spend
[17:07] the time to bless somebody here in the
[17:08] congregation. I'm sure uh be a wonderful
[17:12] time of fellowship that you could have.
[17:14] Um,
[17:17] we have a petition at the back of the
[17:19] church on behalf of brother Al Alons and
[17:23] his family. Uh, we'd appreciate if
[17:26] everyone here at the church could sign
[17:27] it and um
[17:33] to deal with uh immigration issues and
[17:35] uh want to make sure that we do
[17:36] everything we can to uh to help brother
[17:39] Alons and his family. Um,
[17:43] we want to um remind everyone of uh the
[17:48] marriage that's going to be next
[17:51] Saturday here at the church at 10:00.
[17:54] Sister Licia Hart, Brother Mike
[17:56] Anderson, and we're really looking
[17:58] forward to that and uh
[18:01] know God will bless them. So, let's be
[18:03] in prayer for that. I want to um sure
[18:05] that everyone knows that it's at 10:00
[18:07] here at the church next Saturday,
[18:09] January 15th. Um,
[18:12] Brother Tony has been arranging a
[18:14] possible tour of Israel for May.
[18:17] However, uh it has been decided not to
[18:20] go ahead with these plans at this time.
[18:22] If you've got any questions in this
[18:24] regard, please contact Brother Tony.
[18:28] And uh
[18:31] as well there's a testimony that I
[18:32] missed here. Last uh service we had
[18:35] prayer for sister brother Ron Spencer's
[18:37] wife who was going in for immediate
[18:39] surgery to remove a fast growing tumor.
[18:42] Uh the surgery was a complete success
[18:45] and the tumor was benign. So we're
[18:47] thankful for answered prayer. Amen.
[18:50] Um, and as well we want to remind
[18:53] everyone that received an invitation to
[18:56] Brother Martin Walman and Sister Diana
[18:58] Ivanenko's wedding, you must RSVP.
[19:02] Uh, that means respond. For those of you
[19:05] from the States who don't know what that
[19:07] means, it's French.
[19:09] Um, or we will assume you're not coming.
[19:13] So, please respond by next Saturday. An
[19:15] email address and phone number can be
[19:17] found on the sheet with a map that was
[19:18] provided in the invitation. It's very
[19:20] important that you reply as soon as
[19:23] possible as the food is being catered.
[19:25] There will be a signup sheet coming to
[19:26] the bulletin board soon. So, keep your
[19:29] eyes posted.
[19:32] Amen.
[19:34] I think I covered everything. But I want
[19:37] to welcome all those who are visiting
[19:39] with us. We're happy to have you here
[19:40] this morning. I think I saw Sister
[19:42] Debbie Grant out in the foyer this
[19:44] morning and didn't get a chance to say
[19:46] hi to her. There you are, Sister Debbie.
[19:48] God bless you. And any others that are
[19:50] visiting, we want to make sure that you
[19:51] know you're real welcome. Let's sing
[19:52] together. Take up your cross and follow
[19:54] Jesus. Take up your cross and follow
[19:56] him.

[20:40] got um I hope everybody's at a Sunday
[20:42] school by now. Uh Sister Lesnanne has

[24:34] I was chosen to be his bride.
[24:42] I was always a part of his land.
[24:49] And even though
[24:53] this world is dying,
[24:57] I will never be araid

[30:26] [Music]
[30:27] all
[30:29] [Music]
[30:31] and we come to you
[30:35] and worship.
[30:44] Hallelujah.
[30:46] Hallelujah.
[30:50] We come to worship at his feet. That's
[30:53] what we're here for today.
[30:56] Are you ready to worship at his feet?
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:03] Well, we want to enjoy the service this
[31:05] morning with no service this evening.
[31:09] I know a lot of people could make it, a
[31:11] lot of people can't.
[31:13] Uh the roads south of the border are
[31:16] very slippery. We talked to some had
[31:18] been stuck in snow drifts
[31:21] and some hadn't even been out of their
[31:23] house as of yesterday
[31:26] and uh then at the evening of course
[31:28] it's dark and we just don't want people
[31:31] to risk
[31:33] and then it brings up another point. We
[31:36] are we've maxed out on our internet
[31:39] connections.
[31:41] As of last Sunday, there was 113
[31:44] locations
[31:46] that were connected on the internet and
[31:49] we only actually have facility for 100
[31:53] live.
[31:54] Some can go on the archiving over that
[31:58] to get other services and then if we
[32:01] have a difficult weather at all and then
[32:06] people say well I'll just stream that
[32:08] means that somebody in Switzerland
[32:11] somebody in New Zealand somebody in
[32:14] Belgium somebody in Germany somebody in
[32:16] Norway somebody in Africa is not able
[32:19] to. So, we're looking into trying to
[32:23] expand that so we can get some more, get
[32:27] another 50 or another hundred locations.
[32:30] And those are all costs which are we
[32:34] have to bear every month. So, we want
[32:37] you to remember that as well if you
[32:40] would.
[32:41] Uh, I know brother Rod made the
[32:44] announcement about brother Alons and his
[32:47] good wife, Sister Odette.
[32:50] He's wanting badly to leave his family,
[32:52] have his family remain here while he
[32:55] continues to
[32:59] uh deal with his businesses,
[33:02] but he felt led to open a television
[33:05] station
[33:07] in Muja.
[33:09] And I asked if I could mention that this
[33:12] morning. He said it would be fine. It's
[33:15] going to be the most powerful station
[33:18] uh in a region that covers a captive
[33:21] audience of 7 million people.
[33:24] And that station is opening next month
[33:27] in about another three four weeks time.
[33:30] It's all finished. It's all settled.
[33:32] It's the latest technology
[33:35] uh complete digital
[33:38] system and that will be next month. Uh
[33:43] the one thing that I am certain of I'm
[33:46] certain that it is going to give the
[33:49] message
[33:51] uh uh much more coverage
[33:55] uh and uh an opportunity to get into the
[33:58] homes of a lot of other people. So we
[34:01] don't know just what God has in mind but
[34:03] even if we reach a few or one it's worth
[34:07] it all.
[34:09] Amen. So we remember our brother Alons
[34:13] and their uh
[34:15] their desire to have the family be here
[34:19] and we do
[34:21] pray that that will happen.
[34:26] I want to continue on with the service
[34:30] uh from last Sunday
[34:32] and I need to have you just pray that
[34:35] God will give us a real
[34:39] spirit of revelation understanding.
[34:43] Uh there are some things I want to I
[34:46] want to take the ministry that you've
[34:47] been called under this uh end time
[34:51] message ministry and try to give a broad
[34:54] overview.
[34:56] And that's where we really need to have
[34:59] uh retentive minds, focused minds. Don't
[35:04] let yourself be distracted
[35:06] because if you lose a thought or lose a
[35:08] sentence, you might not catch up for a
[35:10] little while. It'd be hard enough just
[35:12] to try to stay focused.
[35:15] So, we want to pray and ask God to
[35:18] uh to help us. You can
[35:23] uh open your Bibles
[35:26] and uh
[35:29] to second Corinthians and we'll just
[35:31] remain if you don't mind. I'll have the
[35:33] musicians to remain for a moment.
[35:36] 2 Corinthians 4 and 18. We're going to
[35:39] read
[35:47] while we look not at the things which
[35:50] are seen, but at the things which are
[35:53] not seen, for the things which are seen
[35:56] are temporal,
[35:58] but the things which are not seen are
[36:01] eternal.
[36:03] Let's read it together.
[36:06] While we look not at the things which
[36:08] are seen, but at the things which are
[36:12] not seen, for the things which are seen
[36:15] are temporal, but the things which are
[36:19] not seen are eternal.
[36:22] May God be blessed.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:27] We place him in the highest place.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; God dwells in a place.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; He dwells in a special place. He has a
[36:35] place and we want to be in contact with
[36:38] that place today. So let's in our hearts
[36:41] place him in the highest place. Would
[36:43] you sing it once again?
[36:45] We place you
[36:49] in the highest place.
[36:54] For you
[36:58] are the great high.
[37:03] We bless you.
[37:05] [Music]
[37:16] Oh,
[37:19] and we come to you
[37:24] and worship
[37:35] You may have your seats. Keep your
[37:37] Bibles, please, ready to be open as I'll
[37:41] be reading some more scriptures in just
[37:44] a few moments.
[37:49] in the book, a man sent from God.
[37:54] Uh they were quoting
[37:56] one of the men. I didn't bother to go
[37:59] back and see who it was they were
[38:01] quoting.
[38:03] But this uh author
[38:08] or whoever the author was quoting said
[38:10] of brother Brham, when the gift is
[38:13] operating,
[38:15] brother Brandham is the most sensitive
[38:17] person to the presence
[38:22] and uh
[38:24] to the presence and working of the Holy
[38:27] Spirit and to spiritual realities of any
[38:32] person I have ever known. known
[38:35] under the anointing which operates his
[38:37] spiritual gifts. And when he is in when
[38:41] he is conscious of the angel's presence,
[38:45] he seems to break through the veil of
[38:48] the flesh into the world of spirit
[38:53] to be struck through and through with a
[38:56] sense of the unseen.
[38:58] And Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 4:18,
[39:02] "We look not at the things which are
[39:04] seen, but at the things which are not
[39:06] seen, for the things which are seen are
[39:08] temporal, but the things which are not
[39:10] seen are eternal." Paul's words here
[39:13] indicate that we are now living in two
[39:17] worlds at the same time. The world of
[39:21] sense and the world of spirit. The world
[39:25] of spirit surrounds
[39:28] and spheres and in in interpenetrates
[39:33] the world of sense. Both worlds occupy
[39:37] the same space at the same time. The
[39:41] material realities which we see with our
[39:46] natural eye exist in the midst of the
[39:50] far better realities which are unseen by
[39:54] the optic nerve.
[39:57] The scriptures teach us that the
[40:00] superior eternal realities compass us.
[40:04] Now
[40:06] what sites might every one of us see if
[40:10] every moment of our existence at every
[40:14] turn of our path had we anointed eyes
[40:18] with which to see them? The seen exists
[40:22] in the midst of the unseen and the
[40:26] temporal in the midst of the eternal.
[40:31] I want to read out of second Peter the 3
[40:34] chapter in the fifth verse.
[40:48] It's not working.
[40:56] Is this mic working?
[41:22] I'll just use this microphone here.
[41:34] out of second Peter 3 uh chapter.
[41:39] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[41:43] that by the word of God the heavens were
[41:46] of old and the earth standing out of the
[41:49] water and in the water whereby the world
[41:53] that then was brother Bram says the
[41:56] antelvian world being overflowed with
[41:59] water perished but the heaven and the
[42:02] earth which are now by the same word are
[42:05] kept in store reserved under fire
[42:08] against the day judgment and predition
[42:11] of ungodly men. But beloved, be be not
[42:15] ignorant of this one thing that one day
[42:18] is with the Lord as a thousand years,
[42:21] and a thousand years as one day. The
[42:24] Lord is not slack concerning his
[42:26] promise, as some men count slackness,
[42:29] but is long-suffering to usward, and not
[42:33] willing that any should perish, but that
[42:36] all should come to repentance. But the
[42:39] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[42:41] the night, in the which the heavens
[42:43] shall pass away with a great noise, and
[42:46] the elements shall melt with fervent
[42:48] heat, and the earth also and the works
[42:51] that are therein shall be burned up.
[42:53] Seeing then that all these things shall
[42:56] be dissolved. What manner of persons
[42:59] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[43:03] and godliness,
[43:06] looking for and hastening unto the
[43:08] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[43:10] heavens being on fire shall be
[43:12] dissolved, any element shall melt with
[43:15] fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according
[43:18] to his promise look for a new heaven and
[43:22] a new earth wherein dwelleth
[43:24] righteousness.
[43:26] Also,
[43:28] uh if you'd like to just turn to Acts
[43:30] the 17th chapter, want to read two
[43:32] verses there.
[43:54] Sometimes God uses these things and
[43:57] sometimes the devil tries to use them.
[44:00] And I'm just I just want to be
[44:03] absolutely certain here that God has his
[44:06] way today.
[44:13] Now Paul
[44:15] because he
[44:18] understand there was no New Testament
[44:21] when he spoke now here in Acts there's
[44:23] no New Testament. So his understanding
[44:26] there's two things coming together here.
[44:28] His understanding is that of the Old
[44:31] Testament which that was his that was
[44:36] his knowledge of the world as being the
[44:39] heavens and the earth. That was his
[44:42] knowledge of it. But now what is coming
[44:45] together in the apostle Paul is that he
[44:48] is chosen to be the first church age
[44:51] messenger. So he is also what's merging
[44:55] with that is that anointing or that
[44:58] inspiration that is given to him so that
[45:01] he can introduce it to those Gentiles
[45:05] that are now to receive the gospel. And
[45:08] so he says in Acts 17 and 23 he's on
[45:13] Mars Hill in Athens and to the
[45:16] Athenians. So he's saying, "For as I
[45:19] passed by and beheld your devotions, I
[45:23] found an altar with this inscription to
[45:26] the unknown God, whom therefore ye
[45:29] ignorantly worship him, de uh excuse me,
[45:33] whom therefore ye ignorantly worship
[45:36] him, declare I unto you. For God,
[45:41] God that made the world and all things
[45:44] therein, seeing that he is Lord of
[45:47] heaven and earth, dwelleth not in
[45:50] temples made with hands. Now, this was
[45:52] something that the Jews understood and
[45:55] this was something that now the Greeks
[45:58] could understand that God made the world
[46:02] and everything that's in it. And that
[46:06] encompasses the understanding in the
[46:09] beginning God created the heavens and
[46:12] the earth. Now when we when we uh hear
[46:16] that well we think well the heavens and
[46:19] the earth uh but not only that Paul is
[46:22] saying didn't only make the heavens and
[46:24] the earth but he made everything that's
[46:25] in it as well. All things that are and
[46:28] and that encompassed the whole the whole
[46:31] uh thought. Now last week just breaking
[46:35] into the subject I was introducing there
[46:39] are I won't say two worlds but we live
[46:42] in two worlds and there's actually more
[46:47] uh spheres or dimensions that we could
[46:49] talk about but the two worlds is the one
[46:52] that God made and the one that we live
[46:56] in that we understand
[46:58] not as a a world as such but it's a
[47:01] cosmos which is the arrangement of
[47:05] things that are presently in the world
[47:08] that we are connected to. But the born
[47:11] again believer actually
[47:14] uh has a plurality or lives in a dual
[47:20] realm because he lives in both of those.
[47:23] So that's really another aspect. So we
[47:25] have the unbeliever, they just live in
[47:28] this world. We have God and the presence
[47:32] of God which is in another realm. That's
[47:35] another world. And we as a as born again
[47:39] believers, we're in contact with both of
[47:42] those. Now,
[47:44] uh the first world, I want to just go
[47:46] slowly. the first world when the
[47:49] scripture says in the beginning God
[47:51] created the heavens and the earth. The
[47:55] the Hebrews have a have a word for
[47:58] heavens. Samim which is heavens and
[48:02] arises which is earth. And these two
[48:05] amount to the the technical term for the
[48:09] entire created order. And so that's how
[48:13] they understood it. In the beginning,
[48:14] God created the heaven and the earth.
[48:18] I'm just I'm I'm just abbreviating now
[48:20] some of the scriptures. And God said,
[48:23] "Let the waters bring forth abundantly."
[48:26] And they did. Every moving creature,
[48:29] every creature that had life foul, and
[48:31] so on. And then God created great
[48:34] whales, and every living creature that
[48:36] moveth, which the waters brought forth
[48:38] abundantly.
[48:40] And then on Genesis 21:24, and God said,
[48:43] "Let the earth bring forth the living
[48:46] creature after its kind, cattle,
[48:48] creeping thing, etc., etc." And it did
[48:50] is all part of the world that uh apostle
[48:56] Paul was talking about. He created all
[48:59] things. And then in Genesis 1:27, so God
[49:02] created man in his own image, in the
[49:05] image of God created he him, male and
[49:08] female created he them. And God blessed
[49:11] them. And God said unto them, "Be
[49:13] fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth,
[49:17] subdue it, have dominion over the fish
[49:19] of the sea, over the fowl of the air,
[49:22] and over every living thing that moveth
[49:24] upon the earth." And God said, "Behold,
[49:26] I've given you every herb
[49:29] bearing seed which is upon the face of
[49:32] the earth, and every tree in the field
[49:35] in the every tree in the which is the
[49:38] spirit or the I'm sorry, the fruit of
[49:40] the tree yielding seed. To you it shall
[49:43] be for meat, and to every beast of the
[49:46] earth, and to every fowl of the air, and
[49:48] to everything that creepeth upon the
[49:50] earth, wherein there is life. I've given
[49:52] every green herb for meat. And it was
[49:56] so. And God saw
[50:00] everything that he had made. And behold,
[50:05] it was very good.
[50:08] That's the world that God made.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; As I said last Sunday, that's the world
[50:16] that God loves.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; That was his own handiwork.
[50:21] He wrought everything by the power of
[50:24] his word.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; And whether it took millions of years or
[50:28] trillions of years, there is no time
[50:31] with God. We have no concept of it
[50:34] because we are creatures of time.
[50:37] Everything begins and everything ends.
[50:40] And our breath is just a vapor.
[50:44] Just a vapor. There is a God. He is
[50:48] eternal. No beginning, no end. We can't
[50:51] understand that. There's nothing in our
[50:53] language that helps us to grasp it. We
[50:55] just have to believe it that somehow
[50:58] there's a being uh almighty divine uh uh
[51:03] being has no beginning and no end. And
[51:06] with the power of his own word, he has
[51:09] structured these things. He divinely
[51:12] ordered them. And not only did he create
[51:14] them, but there's an order to it. He has
[51:16] a certain order to it. And that's what I
[51:19] want you to see. And it was finished.
[51:21] And he and it was very good. And then it
[51:24] says, "And thus the heavens and the
[51:28] earth were finished. and all the host of
[51:31] them.
[51:33] Adam and Eve,
[51:35] they enjoyed a or possessed a capacity
[51:40] for fellowship
[51:42] that none of us have ever really tasted
[51:45] because it was untainted.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; There was no They had never had an evil
[51:49] thought.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; They had never had an evil thought.
[51:55] There hadn't even been a uh there wasn't
[51:58] a even a shadow of anything of that
[52:02] nature. And in that from that place they
[52:05] were able to have fellowship with God.
[52:09] It is so marvelous. I just sense such a
[52:13] presence you know with us today as I
[52:16] speak about these things because that's
[52:18] the Eden we're going back to.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; There won't be a trace. You won't
[52:25] remember this life.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; You won't remember.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; There will be no remembrance of the evil
[52:30] things.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a rejoicing.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And it might raise questions. Well, what
[52:38] about this or what about that or what
[52:39] about this person? What? It's it's far
[52:41] beyond that. It's so far beyond that.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that realm, I
[52:48] believe he likened it. He said it would
[52:49] be like a pig trying to imagine what our
[52:53] life is like.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; There just no possible way to grasp it.
[53:00] So they lived in a realm or a dimension
[53:03] which they could commune with God
[53:06] directly
[53:08] and they were a they were acquainted
[53:10] with the unseen world because the
[53:14] scripture also says no man hath seen God
[53:17] at any time. They did not see God but
[53:20] they heard his voice walking in the
[53:24] garden. So it is something that we have
[53:27] not we we can't even anticipate we can't
[53:30] understand we can't grasp that but they
[53:32] they in the cool of the evening the
[53:35] communion was was absolutely unde
[53:39] undefiled and undiluted. It was just a
[53:42] perfect communion that they had and they
[53:45] heard his voice walking in the garden in
[53:48] the cool of the day.
[53:53] But while they lived in this state,
[53:57] they had no concept of the nether world.
[54:02] They had no concept of the grave.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; They had no concept of the end of life.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; They had no concept of it. So that world
[54:15] they knew nothing about.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; It's one we're very acquainted with.
[54:21] We just had a service the other day and
[54:25] laid one of our brothers away. We're
[54:28] very conscious of it. But they became
[54:31] aware of it when they looked into the
[54:34] face of their slain son
[54:37] &gt;&gt; and now for the first time were tasting
[54:41] of the knowledge of evil.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; It was already bearing fruit. And now
[54:48] they looked into the face of their slain
[54:50] son and could for the first time say,
[54:53] "Where is he?"
[54:55] &gt;&gt; He's not here.
[54:57] Where is he? Where did he go?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure those questions flooded
[55:04] their minds.
[55:07] Where did he go? Does he come back?
[55:13] That was a totally new thing to them.
[55:19] But I want to just take a step back to
[55:21] this perfect
[55:23] perfect world that God had made
[55:27] with his children in harmony and
[55:30] fellowship with him. I want to establish
[55:32] this because it's going to be important
[55:33] in the rest of the service. That was the
[55:35] paradigm
[55:37] or the model,
[55:40] the example
[55:43] world against which all of history and
[55:47] everything that should follow will be
[55:50] evaluated against.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; That was the example. That was the
[55:56] model. paradigm can
[56:00] I suppose maybe mean a little different
[56:02] things to different people but I want to
[56:05] use it as a as the model the example the
[56:09] pattern
[56:11] against which
[56:14] all that shall follow
[56:16] will be evaluated against that world
[56:20] that example world
[56:23] it was the one God said when it was
[56:25] finished he looked on it The whole order
[56:30] said this is very good. God,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; God, holy, righteous, just, perfect God
[56:38] saying this is very good.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I want say our poor
[56:45] minds trying to grasp it. The only thing
[56:47] we could say with our mouth, father, if
[56:50] you said it's very good, then I say it's
[56:52] very good also.
[56:58] So this divine arrangement
[57:02] culminated with God and his children in
[57:05] fellowship.
[57:08] And now
[57:10] we have a collision.
[57:15] We have a colliding
[57:17] of another world.
[57:20] And I'm not going to go into a lot. I
[57:22] described it last week in quite some
[57:24] detail.
[57:26] But this world,
[57:28] please now this world of evil, this
[57:33] world of iniquity, this world was highly
[57:36] organized, this world that knew its
[57:40] creatures knew lots about worship. They
[57:43] were around the throne and its leader
[57:46] Lucifer. He knew all. He even knew the
[57:49] mind of God. He was speaking uh he was
[57:53] speaking to Eve concerning the thought
[57:56] of God and and what the program was and
[57:59] he added one word. Thou shalt not not
[58:03] surely die.
[58:07] Now I just want to say something to you
[58:09] said release
[58:11] your mind and your thoughts. I want you
[58:13] to think. I've been thinking very, very
[58:15] deep. And if I say some things that kind
[58:17] of reach out, you just attribute it to
[58:20] how God is dealing with me.
[58:25] If Satan,
[58:29] if Lucifer, a fallen angel,
[58:34] could inspire or use the instrumentality
[58:38] of a beast
[58:41] called a serpent
[58:43] and cause him with one word,
[58:47] with one word to bring everything that
[58:51] you see on the face of the earth today.
[58:54] Then I want to ask you,
[58:56] is it unreasonable
[58:59] that we should believe that God can take
[59:02] a man
[59:04] in his own hand
[59:07] and through his mouth utter creative
[59:10] power?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; If Satan can take a beast,
[59:16] &gt;&gt; you better believe that God can take a
[59:19] man. If God chooses and says, "You're
[59:22] going to be a prophet. You're going to
[59:24] utter my word. You're going to declare
[59:26] my very breath. You're going to breathe
[59:29] it into the people out of your mouth.
[59:32] Then I say, if God can use if Satan can
[59:35] use a serpent, God can use a man. God
[59:38] can use Moses, God can use Elijah, God
[59:41] can use Samuel, and God can use William
[59:43] Brham."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And everybody in their season
[59:49] at their appropriate time.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; So this leader, this lover of beauty,
[59:57] this slicker, this wise one,
[1:00:03] this one of reason
[1:00:05] polished as brother Brandham said, he
[1:00:09] introduced another order, a different
[1:00:11] arrangement, a different program
[1:00:16] with himself as its head.
[1:00:19] Lucifer, this proud prince,
[1:00:23] the slicker with his hordes of demons
[1:00:28] and his kingdom of darkness following
[1:00:31] collided with this perfect heavens and
[1:00:34] earth
[1:00:36] and brought
[1:00:38] what we have
[1:00:41] today.
[1:00:45] this subtle instrument,
[1:00:48] the serpent.
[1:00:52] I just repeat from last week.
[1:00:56] Sin
[1:00:59] and unbelief which started out
[1:01:02] appealing,
[1:01:06] intriguing,
[1:01:08] enchanting,
[1:01:10] tantalizing,
[1:01:12] you know, to the eyes,
[1:01:16] to the senses.
[1:01:18] And then once it was touched,
[1:01:21] once it was yielded to, it became
[1:01:26] burdensome.
[1:01:28] It became crushing. It became sorrowful.
[1:01:31] That's when tears, that's when pain,
[1:01:33] that's when enslavery was introduced. It
[1:01:36] all looks good. And sin's the same
[1:01:38] today.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; It looks appealing. It just looks, oh,
[1:01:42] if I just touch it, if I just have a
[1:01:43] taste of it, and so on so forth. I tell
[1:01:45] you what,
[1:01:47] there's sorrow attached with it.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; There's chains attached with it. There's
[1:01:52] bondage attached with it.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You'll get to a place you can't get out
[1:01:56] of,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And we have plenty of it today.
[1:02:02] That's the world that Satan introduced.
[1:02:09] It's a world of pleasures.
[1:02:12] As Paul said in Timothy, it's a world of
[1:02:16] cares,
[1:02:17] as Jesus said.
[1:02:20] And I noticed,
[1:02:22] he said that the seed was choked out
[1:02:24] with cares and the riches and the
[1:02:28] pleasures of life. And of course, that
[1:02:30] makes that makes just perfect sense
[1:02:32] because this b this world and this time
[1:02:36] that we're in is a age of great cares
[1:02:39] and burdensome. It's a burdensome time.
[1:02:42] And it's no wonder that people seek
[1:02:44] pleasure to drown out their burdens and
[1:02:48] their cares and to lessen them.
[1:02:53] God made foolish the wisdom of this
[1:02:55] world. Paul said,
[1:02:58] "And Jesus said that there would be
[1:03:01] signs in the heaven, in the sun and the
[1:03:03] moon and the stars and upon the earth
[1:03:06] distress of nations with perplexity."
[1:03:10] Mentioned that to you. Perplexity
[1:03:14] is without the resources. It is
[1:03:17] perplexity is doubt. What do I do now?
[1:03:20] And it is a state in which people are
[1:03:24] left wanting.
[1:03:27] They don't know which way to turn.
[1:03:30] And then brother Brandham concludes I
[1:03:32] concluded with him great burden of this
[1:03:35] last age is the pressures of riches and
[1:03:38] soft living and nervous tensions in a
[1:03:42] complex age that we seem unfitted to
[1:03:46] live in. Don't know about you, but I
[1:03:49] feel unfitted
[1:03:52] to live in this generation. It doesn't
[1:03:55] fit me,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; and I don't think it fits you
[1:04:04] in the end time.
[1:04:06] Brother Brandham said, in invisible
[1:04:08] union, the complete total insanity this
[1:04:12] world will go into right away. Now
[1:04:14] notice the
[1:04:17] connotation of prophetic here.
[1:04:21] We'll go into right away. It's almost
[1:04:24] there now.
[1:04:26] Why? You can see the footprints of it.
[1:04:28] So he was watching the trajectory
[1:04:31] of the way things were going. This is
[1:04:34] 1965.
[1:04:36] He says there it is marching right out
[1:04:38] on the street right down the church pew.
[1:04:40] Total insanity. do things that a human
[1:04:43] being wouldn't think of of doing and
[1:04:46] being civilized. Look what Hollywood's
[1:04:48] done to the woman. Look how it has
[1:04:51] robbed the sacred virtues of the woman.
[1:04:54] On and on we could go. See all this uh
[1:04:59] see all this she lost. How did she do
[1:05:01] it? Because there was a subtle
[1:05:04] instrument called the church.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's not a subtle instrument called
[1:05:10] the serpent. now is a subtle instrument
[1:05:13] called the church
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; like there was in the Garden of Eden. A
[1:05:20] subtle person, the devil, walked into
[1:05:23] the church just like he did into the
[1:05:26] garden. Isn't that incredible? He walked
[1:05:29] into the church just like he walked into
[1:05:31] the garden
[1:05:34] and deceived her into it. She's deceived
[1:05:37] and the woman thinks he said she don't
[1:05:40] mean to be wrong. Eve didn't mean to do
[1:05:43] wrong. It wasn't willfully.
[1:05:46] He said the Bible said in in 2 Timothy 1
[1:05:51] Timothy 3, she was deceived. And
[1:05:54] deceived is not when you willingly do
[1:05:57] it. It's when you are deceived into it.
[1:06:02] now.
[1:06:04] And so now we have this introduction
[1:06:08] of the world that we presently know.
[1:06:12] There has been some intervals
[1:06:16] when God has called the world into
[1:06:18] account.
[1:06:21] He's called certain ages into account
[1:06:25] and measured them against the paradigm
[1:06:28] of the beginning.
[1:06:31] one of those times. And I'll just say on
[1:06:34] the stage, enter Babylon.
[1:06:38] I want to introduce
[1:06:40] Babylon.
[1:06:42] This majestic city,
[1:06:46] magnificent beyond
[1:06:48] what we architecturally today
[1:06:52] understand.
[1:06:54] It stands for the city of man as opposed
[1:06:58] to Jerusalem. That's the city of God.
[1:07:02] Babylon is associated with the tower of
[1:07:05] Babel
[1:07:08] meaning confusion
[1:07:11] as opposed to Jerusalem which is the
[1:07:13] city of peace.
[1:07:16] And in the Latin Jerusalem was
[1:07:18] interpreted as vision of peace.
[1:07:22] Jerusalem the city of peace
[1:07:25] as opposed to Babel. that confusion, the
[1:07:29] city of confusion,
[1:07:32] Babylon serves as a reference point in
[1:07:36] the Middle Ages.
[1:07:38] That's why I'm referring to it because
[1:07:41] it's in Genesis. It has its roots in
[1:07:44] Genesis. It's there in the Middle Ages
[1:07:47] and it appears at the end of the Bible
[1:07:49] in Revelation.
[1:07:51] It appears it's with us.
[1:07:58] Babylon marks the beginnings and the
[1:08:01] endings. For when they when
[1:08:05] Nebuchadnezzar had his dream and only
[1:08:08] Daniel the prophet could interpret the
[1:08:10] dream, he said, "You are the head of
[1:08:13] gold."
[1:08:16] That was the beginning. That was the
[1:08:17] highest that he would get.
[1:08:21] And it would go on down.
[1:08:24] it would progress or degress I should
[1:08:26] say through other three more kingdoms
[1:08:32] and would finally end up as iron and
[1:08:36] clay in the toes. Now you might say well
[1:08:38] how does this relate? It will you just
[1:08:40] hold on for a few moments.
[1:08:44] At the end of time is where spiritual
[1:08:48] Babylon
[1:08:49] we find spiritual Babylon is present in
[1:08:54] the end time and antichrist which is
[1:08:57] anti-word
[1:08:58] is there that is his seat. Now in the
[1:09:03] message of mark of the beast, brother
[1:09:05] Brandham says how Babylon appeared in
[1:09:08] Genesis and then the middle of the Bible
[1:09:12] and the last of the Bible
[1:09:14] in Israel at Kadesh Barnea.
[1:09:18] He said they start in Genesis winding up
[1:09:22] here in the last day
[1:09:24] and then he says how that formal
[1:09:26] religion begin with Cain
[1:09:30] and how it came in on out down through
[1:09:33] the sons of Noah Ham. Out of Ham he had
[1:09:38] Nimrod and Nimrod built the tower of
[1:09:41] Babel. Babel comes on down through King
[1:09:45] Nebuchadnezzar's time and on out into
[1:09:48] Revelations.
[1:09:50] Babylon, how that little seed started
[1:09:54] way back there in the east side of the
[1:09:57] gates of Eden, coming on down, winding
[1:10:00] out. All kinds of cults and everything
[1:10:03] started back there, winding themselves
[1:10:06] out to the end. He said, "Now it
[1:10:08] behooves us
[1:10:11] to watch."
[1:10:13] See, this isn't some history he's
[1:10:15] talking about, but this is something
[1:10:17] that is connected with us right now in
[1:10:20] our time. He said, "Be careful. It
[1:10:23] behooves us to watch. Be careful.
[1:10:27] Be set in the word.
[1:10:30] Many things are taking place today which
[1:10:33] are unscriptural.
[1:10:35] And let's watch the scripture and be
[1:10:37] sure that we're we're we're right.
[1:10:47] Just hold it very close.
[1:10:51] Daniel said,
[1:10:53] "Thou, oh king, are the king of kings."
[1:10:57] This to Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:11:00] For the God of heaven hath given thee a
[1:11:02] kingdom power and strength and glory.
[1:11:06] And wheresoever the children of men
[1:11:08] dwell, the beasts of the field, and the
[1:11:10] fowls of the heaven, hath he given into
[1:11:13] thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over
[1:11:17] them all. Thou art this head of gold. I
[1:11:20] tell you, he was given a prestigious
[1:11:22] position
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; by God.
[1:11:28] And in the days of these kings on down,
[1:11:32] he's interpreting because he saw a stone
[1:11:35] cut out of the mountain without hands.
[1:11:38] And in the days of these kings, these
[1:11:40] other kings, shall the God of heaven set
[1:11:44] up a kingdom which shall never be
[1:11:47] destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be
[1:11:48] left to other people, but it shall break
[1:11:50] in pieces and consume all these
[1:11:54] kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.
[1:11:57] I would say that if one foul word
[1:12:01] introduced
[1:12:02] from Lucifer through the instrument of a
[1:12:05] beast which is lower than us in Eden
[1:12:08] could bring influence upon all these
[1:12:12] nations of the world. the seed of that
[1:12:15] back there rippling all out through
[1:12:17] man's history bringing this catastrophic
[1:12:21] absolutely degradable and degenerate
[1:12:25] condition of the world today if that
[1:12:28] could happen by Lucifer through one
[1:12:30] being lower than ourselves what can God
[1:12:33] do through a one man in the hand of God
[1:12:37] to the nations which you may not see the
[1:12:39] effect of the word you can't see the
[1:12:42] effect of that word Not
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; you only see the circumstances but we
[1:12:47] we're not conscious of the fact we say
[1:12:50] well every but the prophet saw it he
[1:12:52] said every hospital bed
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; every prison
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; every prison cell
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; was hinging on that one word
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; every graveyard
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; all the flowers you see every graveyard
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; is hinging on that one word I say If
[1:13:13] that if that be so, God can take one
[1:13:16] word out of a prophet's mouth and swing
[1:13:19] the world upside down.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You might not know the process,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; but you have to know who's speaking
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; cuz that's exactly what's happening.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And it shall stand forever for as much
[1:13:42] as thou sawest that the stone was cut
[1:13:45] out of the mountain without hands, and
[1:13:48] that break in pieces the iron, the
[1:13:51] brass, the clay, the silver, and the
[1:13:53] gold. The great God hath made known to
[1:13:57] the king what shall come to pass
[1:14:00] hereafter, and the and the dream is
[1:14:03] certain, and the interpretation thereof
[1:14:06] sure.
[1:14:10] King Belshazzer.
[1:14:12] The Bible says it's his son. There's
[1:14:14] some dispute about that. They thought it
[1:14:17] might be his grandfather, which is
[1:14:19] irrelevant to us. But King Belshazzer
[1:14:22] followed him.
[1:14:25] You should see the grandeur.
[1:14:27] I've looked at a few drawings, but the
[1:14:31] grandeur and the the marvels of Babylon,
[1:14:35] which I won't get into, but Belshazzer,
[1:14:38] he just got completely carried away with
[1:14:40] the glory and the power because they
[1:14:43] were the superpower.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; They at that time of the Middle Ages
[1:14:48] controlled the world. And that's why God
[1:14:51] is calling him into account. And the
[1:14:54] only way he can call him into account is
[1:14:56] he gives him a dream that uh
[1:14:58] Nebuchadnezzar that he can't understand.
[1:15:01] And God has a prophet on hand who can
[1:15:04] interpret the dream and tell him every
[1:15:07] detail of it. And that prophet is there
[1:15:09] while another king comes into into
[1:15:11] power, Belshazzer. And he made a great
[1:15:14] feast for a thousand of his lords and
[1:15:17] drank wine before the thousand. and
[1:15:20] Belshazzer, whilst he tasted the wine,
[1:15:23] communed, uh, commanded to bring the
[1:15:26] golden and silver vessels which his
[1:15:30] father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of
[1:15:33] the temple in Jerusalem,
[1:15:35] and the king and his his princes and his
[1:15:39] wives and his concubines that they might
[1:15:42] drink therein. And then they brought the
[1:15:45] golden vessels that were taken out of
[1:15:47] the temple of the house of God, which
[1:15:50] was at Jerusalem. And the king and his
[1:15:53] princes, his wives, and his concubines
[1:15:56] drank in them. They drank wine and
[1:15:59] praised the gods of gold and of silver
[1:16:02] and of brass and of iron and of wood and
[1:16:06] of stone and all the material things
[1:16:08] that we have today. They're glorifying
[1:16:11] the automobile industry, glorifying the
[1:16:15] fashion industry, glorifying all the
[1:16:18] universities and all the places and
[1:16:21] institutions of education and higher
[1:16:24] education and higher education and on
[1:16:26] and on and on. They're glorifying and
[1:16:29] consumed with the works of their hands
[1:16:32] and the things they had built and the
[1:16:34] cities they had built and all the wisdom
[1:16:36] that they had. And they were glorifying
[1:16:38] them. And they took vessels
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; that have been dedicated to God
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and began to drink them and use them.
[1:16:48] And the king of Babylon drunk on his
[1:16:52] power, blinded by his glory,
[1:16:57] blinded by his iniquity and the
[1:16:59] blasphemy
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; of his actions
[1:17:03] and drinking as he was in this drunken
[1:17:06] banquet. And God decides to call him
[1:17:10] into account,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; this great power. call him into account
[1:17:15] and evaluate him with the paradigm of
[1:17:18] the beginning. And he was weighed in the
[1:17:20] balances. And remember, if you're
[1:17:21] weighed in the balances, there has to be
[1:17:23] there has to be an absolute.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And there was an absolute. And it was a
[1:17:28] paradigm of the beginning. And the
[1:17:29] prophet spoke and said, "You have been
[1:17:31] weighed and you are wanting."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That was Babylon then.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And Babylon
[1:17:43] got weighed out again,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; today
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and a prophet again,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; weighed them out,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; confusion of the ages,
[1:17:54] sir.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And call the denominational world into
[1:17:57] account. And he said, "You're Hollywood.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; You got Hollywood evangelism.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You're Hollywood. You've been weighed
[1:18:06] and you're found wanting." And he
[1:18:07] preached handwriting on the wall again.
[1:18:15] in the mark of the beast. Once again,
[1:18:19] brother Brandon says it begin Babylon
[1:18:21] begin in Genesis and ends up in
[1:18:23] Revelation.
[1:18:27] It brought in idolatry,
[1:18:29] idols,
[1:18:32] worship of idols.
[1:18:34] He said it came right on down through
[1:18:36] and it's so cunning in the last days
[1:18:39] till it takes on the name of
[1:18:41] Christianity here. Now the prophet is
[1:18:44] pulling the covers back.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Now we might say well brother Brand's
[1:18:52] not the first one to identify that
[1:18:54] though that's true but the first one
[1:18:57] with the kind of vindication he had.
[1:19:02] That happens to be a very big thing. I
[1:19:04] want you to know right the offset that's
[1:19:06] a very big subject with me
[1:19:09] is a vindication.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Fact is, I might as well say it right
[1:19:14] now. There has been nothing in recorded
[1:19:19] history that I know of or that anyone
[1:19:22] else has told me about or that any
[1:19:26] research has uncovered since the
[1:19:28] beginning of the world
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; to this time
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; that God raised up a man
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; with that kind,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; not a gift,
[1:19:40] that kind of voice that was coming out.
[1:19:46] If there is, it's incumbent upon you to
[1:19:48] tell me who it is.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; It's never been. Why? Because it had to
[1:19:56] be for the last one.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; This had to be for the last one. Because
[1:20:02] God is going to call the world to
[1:20:05] judgment against the paradigm
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; of the perfect creation.
[1:20:14] He said the city of Babylon was the
[1:20:16] greatest city of the known world. The
[1:20:19] word Babylon first means it was the gate
[1:20:22] of paradise.
[1:20:24] Secondly, it was called the gate. It was
[1:20:27] called confusion which means backslid
[1:20:31] and the city he said was a great place
[1:20:32] and all nations around it paid tribute
[1:20:35] to it. All of them were taxed by Babylon
[1:20:38] and it became a great wicked and
[1:20:40] indifferent city.
[1:20:43] God attested to its glory.
[1:20:46] Babylonian then meet a Persian Greece
[1:20:50] and the Romans.
[1:20:57] Oh,
[1:20:58] now it is when that fourth
[1:21:02] generation, the last one, the Roman
[1:21:06] power. Now, they had and I had it on a I
[1:21:11] could have showed you on a map. It's
[1:21:13] impressive the Roman Empire,
[1:21:17] their domain.
[1:21:19] Oh, how they built roads
[1:21:22] and how they had a parliamentary system
[1:21:26] and how genius they were and the control
[1:21:30] and the way they governed and so on so
[1:21:32] forth. I've read quite a bit about it.
[1:21:34] It was not recently, but it's very
[1:21:37] interesting how the Romans ruled and
[1:21:39] it's still admired today, their form of
[1:21:43] government and the way that they had
[1:21:45] things. And now when they were at the
[1:21:48] peak and the apex of their power and now
[1:21:53] they had
[1:21:55] the world, the world.
[1:21:59] That is when God decided there needed to
[1:22:03] be a collision,
[1:22:06] a colliding
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; of another world.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; This world under the sentence of death,
[1:22:15] there must come life
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and a different kind of life.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And this is where I ended last Sunday.
[1:22:22] And that is why God created a life
[1:22:25] unlike any other life. that was a a god
[1:22:29] seed
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; in the womb of a virgin
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; and he's going to turn the world upside
[1:22:35] down with one man
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ.
[1:22:46] Won't you think about it?
[1:22:50] I know there was a great roar of amen
[1:22:53] last week.
[1:22:56] He said, "Behold, I make all things new.
[1:23:00] I make a new heaven and a new earth."
[1:23:04] Brother Brandham says that that body of
[1:23:06] Jesus, born of a woman, of Mary,
[1:23:11] that body was formed in her womb
[1:23:14] of the nutrients which she received of
[1:23:18] the earth. She ate, he received
[1:23:21] nutrition, and that body was formed. and
[1:23:24] he had a body that aged.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; When he was 30, he looked 50
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; because he was under the weight of the
[1:23:34] sins of the world.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; And when he got hot, he prosperspired.
[1:23:38] And when he got tired, he had to sleep.
[1:23:40] And when he was thirsty, he needed a
[1:23:42] drink by the well.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; He was a man.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; And when he stood at Lazarus's grave, he
[1:23:48] wept for the hardness of their heart.
[1:23:50] And brother Brandham said of all the
[1:23:51] human emotions, he he he cried. He had
[1:23:54] tears. That was the human emotion he he
[1:23:57] showed most.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He wept.
[1:24:02] But now that body
[1:24:05] is taken to the cross, is slain. He
[1:24:08] takes his last breath,
[1:24:10] speaks his last words, and gives up the
[1:24:13] ghost. He said, "No man takes my life
[1:24:16] from me. I lay it down myself. I will
[1:24:18] take it up again. and is in the tomb.
[1:24:21] And on the morning of the first day of
[1:24:23] the week, the disciples, Mary comes to
[1:24:26] the tomb, finds that the stone is rolled
[1:24:29] away, looks in, and the body is not
[1:24:31] there.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That body
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; now that body will never be the same. It
[1:24:38] is the same Christ, but it's not the
[1:24:40] same body that came out of the womb of
[1:24:41] the woman.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; It is a new earth.
[1:24:47] Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; On the collision with a cursed earth
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and he dropped the blood from that body
[1:24:56] that was on the cross. He dropped the
[1:24:58] blood onto the blood of the blood of God
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; onto the ground of the earth that you're
[1:25:04] walking on today claiming it as my own.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't want it in its present
[1:25:11] state. He's going to purge it. He's
[1:25:14] going to purify it. He marked it with
[1:25:16] the blood of God. He claimed it back as
[1:25:19] a redeemer. I'm redeeming it. I'm buying
[1:25:22] it back with the very blood of God. And
[1:25:25] when he raised up from the grave,
[1:25:29] he referred to his body.
[1:25:34] They said it's a spirit.
[1:25:37] He said a spirit hath not flesh and
[1:25:39] bones, but he didn't say blood.
[1:25:43] What kind of body that is, I know not.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; But it is a new body.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of body.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And this scripture which we have says
[1:25:52] that he will give us a body like unto
[1:25:55] his glorious body.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. It's a
[1:25:58] glorious body. It's a glorious body. He
[1:26:02] took a body and the scripture says of
[1:26:04] our humility, of our defilement. He took
[1:26:07] a body like us. He who knew no sin was
[1:26:10] made sin for us that he could condemn
[1:26:14] sin and death in the flesh.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; And there was a an incredible
[1:26:21] an incredible cosmic class collision
[1:26:26] and Christ Hallelujah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; How you came out of the grave.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; He descended.
[1:26:36] While he was there, he descended to the
[1:26:38] lower regions. He went to a lower world
[1:26:42] so that you wouldn't have to go there.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; He went to the nether world. He went to
[1:26:47] the underworld. He went to hell itself
[1:26:51] so that you wouldn't have to go to hell.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I love the way the prophet puts it. He
[1:26:58] said, you know, Eve said, "Who is it?"
[1:27:01] He said, "It's the seed of the woman."
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham said, "Who is it?"
[1:27:07] He I'm the promised son.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Joseph said, "Who is it?" I'm the son uh
[1:27:14] of prosperity.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Daniel said, "Who is it?" I'm the stone
[1:27:23] that was cut out of the mountain without
[1:27:24] hands.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Rising.
[1:27:31] And he went and rattled the cage of
[1:27:34] Satan himself,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; his arc enemy that he cast out of
[1:27:38] heaven,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; said, "I come to get you.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; I come to destroy you.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; I come to strip you."
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; And he took the keys of death, hell, and
[1:27:50] the grave and ripped them off of him and
[1:27:53] ascended victorious.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; That's a new world coming into
[1:28:00] existence.
[1:28:04] Brother Brandon said, "The earth will
[1:28:06] burst forth with volcanics." I tell you,
[1:28:10] that was a volcanic that was equal to
[1:28:12] any volcanic explosion when Christ burst
[1:28:16] out of the earth.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Here I am,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; alive again.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And behold, I live.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And he that liveth and believeth on me
[1:28:26] shall never die.
[1:28:29] I'm alive. And because I live, you shall
[1:28:32] live also.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; That's a new world.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's a new world.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; It's not just some words of history.
[1:28:40] It's a world that was introduced back
[1:28:42] there.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Let me drop this in.
[1:28:48] When you were born,
[1:28:50] were you in the world? Of course.
[1:28:55] Did you know anything about
[1:28:57] you girls that were born? I got a little
[1:29:00] baby girl.
[1:29:01] Were you in the world? Yeah.
[1:29:05] You didn't know much about it.
[1:29:09] gradually
[1:29:10] over a period of time.
[1:29:13] And through the processes of growing,
[1:29:16] through the processes of developing,
[1:29:19] through the processes of learning, you
[1:29:22] learned
[1:29:23] how to do things.
[1:29:26] You learned maybe how to cook.
[1:29:28] You learned the responsibilities.
[1:29:31] And what were you doing? You were
[1:29:32] learning about this world.
[1:29:36] And you began to discover too that
[1:29:38] things aren't very permanent. They're
[1:29:40] not very stable.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And you soon begin to taste of its of
[1:29:45] some of its trouble. You begin to taste
[1:29:47] at a young age of some of its pressure.
[1:29:49] You begin to you begin to experience
[1:29:51] some of its its hardship. You experience
[1:29:54] some of its joy and happiness and
[1:29:55] frivolity and and fun and all the rest
[1:29:58] of it. And the men as you begin to grow,
[1:30:00] you found out I got I've got to I've got
[1:30:03] to learn something. I've got to learn
[1:30:04] how to do something. I've got to work
[1:30:06] for a living. I got to That was this
[1:30:08] world.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Well, the world that Jesus introduced,
[1:30:11] that's what we're doing right now.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; We're developing and we're learning
[1:30:15] something about that world because and
[1:30:18] you want to get all you can of it right
[1:30:20] now because that's the world you're
[1:30:22] going to.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You plan to go there.
[1:30:32] Is that your destiny?
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; They introduced
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; another world. They began to bring it
[1:30:40] into being.
[1:30:43] Whereas
[1:30:46] in Eden with the first Adam, God created
[1:30:50] all the lower forms of life and it
[1:30:52] evolved, evolved, evolved
[1:30:56] and he capped it off with his son.
[1:31:00] And that one fell
[1:31:03] through the son's wife.
[1:31:05] This one, he starts with his son.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Completely the opposite. He starts with
[1:31:14] his son and then he begins to populate
[1:31:17] it.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You see, he he started with all the
[1:31:20] lower creation. Then he came and ended
[1:31:23] it with his son and then gave his son a
[1:31:25] bride and then they began to populate
[1:31:27] afterwards.
[1:31:30] Now it's different.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; They begin to populate after she had
[1:31:34] already been polluted,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; after she had already carried a false
[1:31:39] seed.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But God said, "I'm going to reverse it.
[1:31:42] I'm going to start with the perfect now.
[1:31:45] I'm going to start with the son who's
[1:31:47] already overcome the devil."
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; And the devil did approach him. The
[1:31:53] devil did try to get him to worship. The
[1:31:55] devil did try to get to interpret the
[1:31:58] word to him, but he had no capacity.
[1:32:01] There was no place found in him for this
[1:32:04] foul one. And he defeated him on earth
[1:32:07] and he defeated him in hell.
[1:32:10] He defeated him in heaven. He defeated
[1:32:13] him in every in every dimension.
[1:32:16] Can you say amen? Glory to God.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He defeated him. Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And so now the son
[1:32:29] comes first
[1:32:32] and then
[1:32:35] first he creates his bride.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You might think you just heard the
[1:32:41] message.
[1:32:46] You might think, well, yeah, brother
[1:32:48] Brian was a prophet. Yeah, yeah, I
[1:32:50] believe that all the rest of it. Let me
[1:32:52] tell you something.
[1:32:54] If you haven't already thought of it,
[1:32:57] it was the word of God,
[1:33:00] thus sayeth the Lord, which wasn't
[1:33:02] brother Brandham's words
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; coming through that mouth
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; that actually created
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; a virgin bride.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And the power of that word annihilated
[1:33:14] your sin
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; and you repented. It takes repentance.
[1:33:22] Without the shed blood, there's no
[1:33:23] remission of sins. It took all of that.
[1:33:25] It took the cross.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It took Christ. But remember, Jesus is
[1:33:30] the word. Jesus is the word outside. You
[1:33:33] can't have Jesus over here and the word
[1:33:34] over here. They are one and the same.
[1:33:37] And when the word comes forth, that's
[1:33:39] Jesus coming forth.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; This business about talking I love Jesus
[1:33:45] and denying what's in here. It's not the
[1:33:47] Jesus of this Bible.
[1:33:51] Jesus is the word.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And so now he creates
[1:34:05] a virgin bride. It's not just a people
[1:34:08] rising up and say, "Well, you know, I'm
[1:34:10] an elect and I'm a bride and I'm the
[1:34:11] elect lady and all the rest of it." It's
[1:34:13] not what you say it is. It's what you
[1:34:14] believe.
[1:34:20] Hallelujah.
[1:34:25] And having spoiled principalities and
[1:34:28] powers, he made a show of them openly,
[1:34:31] triumphing over them in it.
[1:34:36] He was the one who said he was the I am.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; I'm Abraham's shield. I am thy shield.
[1:34:44] He was Ruth kinsman's. I am thy near
[1:34:46] kinsman
[1:34:48] in Isaiah. I am he that blotth away thy
[1:34:52] out thy transgressions in John. I am the
[1:34:54] bread of life. I am the light of the
[1:34:56] world. I am the door of the sheep. I am
[1:34:58] the good shepherd. I am come that they
[1:35:00] might have life. I am the resurrection
[1:35:02] and the life. I am the way, the truth,
[1:35:04] and the life. I am the true vine. I am
[1:35:06] from above.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Said you are of this world.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me he didn't know who he was.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He was a great I am.
[1:35:17] and he still is.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I'm the alpha and the omega, the
[1:35:21] beginning and the ending.
[1:35:24] And finally, I am he that liveth
[1:35:27] and was dead. And behold, I'm alive
[1:35:29] forever more. Amen. And I have the and I
[1:35:31] have the keys of death, hell, and the
[1:35:34] grave.
[1:35:41] was like a volcanic eruption.
[1:35:50] It would be nice if we could see for
[1:35:51] just a moment
[1:35:53] all the powers of hell. All the angels
[1:35:56] that fell
[1:35:59] following their leader. All of those
[1:36:03] great angels that could only be cast out
[1:36:05] with fasting and prayer. The Bible says,
[1:36:07] "And all the other demon powers, the
[1:36:11] demons of cancer and of disease and
[1:36:14] sickness, the demons of lust and the
[1:36:16] demons of uncleanness and the demons of
[1:36:19] perversion and all those demons when
[1:36:21] that eruption took place, they trembled
[1:36:23] in their shoes.
[1:36:27] Who's this is coming forth?
[1:36:30] Who's this?"
[1:36:32] I said Ezra spoke of pillars of smoke
[1:36:35] and who is this that's coming.
[1:36:38] He made hell tremble.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; I tell you there was an eruption in the
[1:36:44] other world unlike anything.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It never will happen again like that.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; That's the one and only time in all of
[1:36:52] the span of eternity that anything like
[1:36:55] that's going to happen. I say glory be
[1:36:58] to God in the highest.
[1:37:03] Victorious is our Christ.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Up from the grave he arose,
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; triumphant over his foes.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And to think that this little body of
[1:37:16] flesh that sits here today or stands
[1:37:18] here has the privilege to open its mouth
[1:37:21] and take in God's free air and use his
[1:37:24] use the energy that he's given with the
[1:37:26] muscles and body that he's given us that
[1:37:28] we could praise his name. Well, what a
[1:37:31] pleasure it is for us. What a privilege
[1:37:33] it is for us. And what an insult if we
[1:37:35] won't do it.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; God, you did all that, but I refuse to
[1:37:39] open my mouth. I refuse to praise you. I
[1:37:42] say God gave you life
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; and the purpose of your life is to glory
[1:37:47] to him.
[1:37:58] the foundation stone
[1:38:02] and the headstone
[1:38:04] of the new creation begins cleansing the
[1:38:07] earth of evil.
[1:38:11] So he says to disciples, "Go preach this
[1:38:14] gospel.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Cast out devils.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Freely you've received, freely give.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Displace him.
[1:38:24] move him out of here.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Lay hands on the sick and they'll
[1:38:28] recover.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was already done.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; It's not God doesn't have to come down
[1:38:35] and heal you. God has healed you. He
[1:38:38] said God can't heal you. God has already
[1:38:40] healed every person. He said that God
[1:38:43] has healed every person.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; God has healed every person. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Sister Marge Miller, I prayed for you
[1:38:51] this morning that God would take this
[1:38:53] message and just uh uh penetrate your
[1:38:56] soul with it.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; God has healed you.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; This isn't some merely excitement,
[1:39:08] friends. This is the truth of this word
[1:39:10] of God. And God has announced these kind
[1:39:14] of things to us so we can take it. So we
[1:39:16] can believe it. So we can uh harbor it
[1:39:20] in our hearts and love it and embrace
[1:39:22] it, cherish it.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; This Christ,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; the headstone,
[1:39:32] the foundation stone,
[1:39:35] begins cleansing the earth of evil and
[1:39:38] brings forth to bring forth a perfect
[1:39:40] dwelling place.
[1:39:42] When the earth goes through the process
[1:39:45] that you and I go through
[1:39:49] by repentance,
[1:39:52] the water baptism
[1:39:55] and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the
[1:39:58] cleansing fire of God,
[1:40:02] he said the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[1:40:05] that cleansing of the fire of God will
[1:40:07] take the want out of you.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; There's a a
[1:40:13] A woman that's not properly dressed
[1:40:16] walks by says there still is. It'll take
[1:40:19] the want out of you.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Doesn't take the temptation, but takes
[1:40:24] the want out of you.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Man has been a drunkard. He gets a whiff
[1:40:29] of that drink and and and there's the
[1:40:31] want there. The Holy Spirit will burn
[1:40:33] the want out of you.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You'll still smell it. You might have
[1:40:37] the temptation, but you won't want it
[1:40:40] anymore. The want goes out of you.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Rejoice, saints of God. The baptism of
[1:40:52] the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God has
[1:40:55] come into you and taken the want out of
[1:40:58] you.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; We're free.
[1:41:08] whom the Son sets free is free indeed.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Calvary made you free.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And the resurrection proved it.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Any man can say something, but
[1:41:21] when he rose from the dead, he proved
[1:41:24] who he was."
[1:41:27] And in this generation, he proved who he
[1:41:29] was. He proved who he was. He proved
[1:41:34] there wasn't uh a Kuckian with seventh
[1:41:37] grade education. It was God in the man.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Continuing his
[1:41:45] creation.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Continuing the process
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; of his creation and populating it.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And the earth is going to be made ready.
[1:41:58] The earth has to have a holy fire
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; to burn the heavens.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And all the demon power and evil power
[1:42:07] and spirits, they're going to be
[1:42:09] annihilated.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That demon who's haunted
[1:42:15] you, he's going to be annihilated.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Rejoice over him today.
[1:42:23] Hallelujah.
[1:42:25] Don't let him hound you. Don't let him
[1:42:27] be in your tracks. Don't let him be on
[1:42:30] your case. You defeat him. He's already
[1:42:33] destroyed.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a key on him left.
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] So I say
[1:42:53] in this day
[1:42:59] we come to another
[1:43:01] not an interval in time but we came to
[1:43:04] the consummation of the ages.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about the consummation
[1:43:09] of the ages. Speaks about the conditions
[1:43:12] that will exist in the consummation of
[1:43:14] the ages. And it speaks of the ministry
[1:43:16] that will come in the consummation of
[1:43:19] the ages. Behold, before that great and
[1:43:22] terrible, terrible day of the Lord, the
[1:43:25] judgment day, I'll send you Elijah the
[1:43:27] prophet to turn the hearts of the
[1:43:30] children back to the fathers.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Back to the word.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Some preachers in the message use that,
[1:43:38] but they're talking about their
[1:43:40] understanding of the word. I'm not
[1:43:42] talking about their understanding. I'm
[1:43:43] talking about what Elijah said about the
[1:43:45] word.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And that's the only world word that'll
[1:43:53] produce the world that God's going to
[1:43:55] dwell in.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:44:06] listen closely
[1:44:09] in the message. Notice the titles of the
[1:44:11] message. at thy word.
[1:44:14] In other words, he said, a vision causes
[1:44:18] you to be in two worlds at the same
[1:44:20] time.
[1:44:25] This is what
[1:44:28] uh
[1:44:33] one of the Bible encyclopedias
[1:44:36] says concerning vision. I think it's
[1:44:39] worthwhile.
[1:44:41] Psychologists find that man is
[1:44:44] prevailingly and persistently eyeminded.
[1:44:48] That is in his walking life he is likely
[1:44:52] to think, imagine and remember in terms
[1:44:57] of his vision.
[1:44:59] Naturally then his dreaming is
[1:45:01] predominantly visual.
[1:45:04] So strongly visual, we are told that it
[1:45:07] is not rare to find dreams defined as
[1:45:10] trains of fantastic images.
[1:45:14] Whether man was made this way in order
[1:45:18] that God might commune with him through
[1:45:21] dreams and visions is hardly worth
[1:45:24] debating.
[1:45:26] If the records of the human life in the
[1:45:28] Bible and out of it are to be trusted at
[1:45:31] all, there is nothing better certified
[1:45:34] than that God has communicated with man
[1:45:38] in this way. God communicating with man
[1:45:42] said that is the most certified. It's
[1:45:44] not even debatable. There isn't even a
[1:45:46] negative to it. God communicates with
[1:45:50] man by vision. Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Now you have a prophet that has visions.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; 10, 100, a thousand,
[1:46:03] innumerable.
[1:46:05] vision.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Living by vision.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Speaking to people by vision. Making
[1:46:11] decisions by vising
[1:46:14] vision of the governments and the world
[1:46:17] affairs. Seeing visions of communism and
[1:46:20] of America and of Hollywood and all.
[1:46:23] Seeing by vision, speaking by vision.
[1:46:26] You have,00 messages. I tell you, many
[1:46:30] of them are by direct vision
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; because that's how God chose to
[1:46:37] communicate with man.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; When a vision comes
[1:46:43] to you,
[1:46:45] a vision causes you to be in two worlds
[1:46:48] at the same time. You're in this world
[1:46:52] here now and you're in another world and
[1:46:55] you're speaking over there knowing that
[1:46:57] your voice is heard back here. Place
[1:47:00] yourself there once and just see what
[1:47:04] it'll do for you.
[1:47:11] The revealing of Christ himself
[1:47:14] in the opening of the seals.
[1:47:17] the time of the marriage of the lamb
[1:47:19] with his bride. This is the time. It had
[1:47:23] to come in this time. There had to come
[1:47:25] a time in the consummation of the ages
[1:47:27] for the seals to be open. That which was
[1:47:29] sealed up which Daniel couldn't write.
[1:47:31] That's what John couldn't write. It had
[1:47:33] to be spoken.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; It was the time of the marriage of the
[1:47:38] lamb
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; and his bride.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Where is this bride?
[1:47:49] Check it out.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And someone might say, well, you know,
[1:47:56] you really want to take that kind of a
[1:47:58] position. Say, I am the bride of Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ. I'm an elector of God.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; On what authority? On the authority that
[1:48:09] God sent a vindicated prophet and spoke
[1:48:11] it. And I believe what was said and that
[1:48:14] because I believe what was said, I
[1:48:16] believe I'm in what he said I'd be in.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; This stone,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; remember now, it did not hit the head of
[1:48:26] gold
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; or the breast of
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; of silver
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; or the midsection of brass and neither
[1:48:36] the legs of iron. But at the end time,
[1:48:40] at the consummation of the ages, when
[1:48:43] Rome will be mixing with all the nations
[1:48:46] of the world, when it will become the
[1:48:49] soul, the sole world power, you can say,
[1:48:52] "Well, America is a superpower." I tell
[1:48:54] you, Rome has more power than America.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; It holds the souls of men
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; at their disposal.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm getting through to you. Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't don't fear those shiny
[1:49:10] missiles. Rome is more powerful than
[1:49:12] those shiny missiles
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; in the in the silos.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; What is this world?"
[1:49:28] I pondered for days since the last
[1:49:31] service.
[1:49:33] What do we see? What do we discover from
[1:49:37] this world that brother Brandham said
[1:49:40] I'm in two worlds where he said we're in
[1:49:42] two worlds.
[1:49:44] I found out it was a world
[1:49:47] of absolute knowledge.
[1:49:52] A world of absolute knowledge.
[1:49:54] Listen very close.
[1:49:57] We read accounts of him speaking with
[1:49:59] people who was in front of him and so on
[1:50:01] and so forth.
[1:50:04] But the startling thing,
[1:50:07] it never aired.
[1:50:10] Never aired.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; There's not an account
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; by any minister,
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; by any writing, by his enemies.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; There's no account that was ever wrong.
[1:50:22] What is it? Absolute knowledge. That
[1:50:24] happens to be a very important point
[1:50:26] because he said some things about you.
[1:50:28] He says some things about me. And if
[1:50:30] it's not from a position of absolute
[1:50:31] knowledge, I could doubt those.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; If people rose up and said, "Well, he
[1:50:35] said that." It was no, it didn't make
[1:50:38] any sense to it at all.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Like somebody trying to use this gift
[1:50:42] down in the church in Tennessee and told
[1:50:46] a woman, "You're this, that, the other
[1:50:48] thing." It was an imitation,
[1:50:52] an impersonation.
[1:50:56] And a woman came to her pastor and said,
[1:50:58] "He told me I think two or three things
[1:51:00] and not one of them was correct."
[1:51:03] So the pastor went to the minister,
[1:51:05] pastor of another church in this
[1:51:07] message.
[1:51:09] Not the message I'm in,
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; but what he calls message and said, "You
[1:51:15] said this, that, and the other thing,
[1:51:16] and the woman has come to me and
[1:51:17] said,"None of them are true." All he
[1:51:19] says is hit and miss. You know, he says,
[1:51:21] "If you hit it 50% of the time, you're
[1:51:23] happy.
[1:51:26] 50% of the time. What kind of
[1:51:28] confidence?
[1:51:32] But that's what's out there.
[1:51:34] That's what's out there.
[1:51:38] I'm sure you appreciate
[1:51:40] something of what we have here. At least
[1:51:42] with a sincerity,
[1:51:54] a world of absolute knowledge.
[1:52:00] It was a world of absolute power.
[1:52:04] He says
[1:52:07] a man standing in front of him.
[1:52:12] He says, "Your makeup from a childhood
[1:52:14] has been strange."
[1:52:17] Now, tracing this man from his childhood
[1:52:23] since you've been a boy.
[1:52:26] It's been strange.
[1:52:29] That is right.
[1:52:31] You're desiring a worthy thing.
[1:52:34] He said sterile.
[1:52:37] Is that right? Is that true?
[1:52:41] He says, "Aren't you in the Navy?
[1:52:45] Aren't you a sailor?
[1:52:47] I see clothes
[1:52:50] or a man standing by the side of you
[1:52:52] just it it's you.
[1:52:55] You're a sailor."
[1:53:00] He says just standing there in a moment
[1:53:04] has gone back when he was a a young boy.
[1:53:08] So you've been strange since you're a
[1:53:10] child,
[1:53:12] but you're here for a worthy cause.
[1:53:15] You're sterile
[1:53:18] and you're in the Navy.
[1:53:20] I see your clothes.
[1:53:23] Tell you what, friends,
[1:53:25] that might be fine for that man, but it
[1:53:28] means infinitely more to me.
[1:53:33] That tells me that the God who spoke
[1:53:35] this message saw me way back in my very
[1:53:39] beginnings saw me tramping through the
[1:53:41] woods and through the trees. He saw you
[1:53:43] in your confusion. He saw you in your
[1:53:45] state. He saw you in your sin. He saw
[1:53:48] you in your bondage. And God sent a
[1:53:50] word. One day I'm going to loose him.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna send a creative word. I'm
[1:53:58] gonna speak it. And oh, I hope they
[1:54:00] don't miss it. I hope they believe it in
[1:54:02] that moment. In that moment because
[1:54:04] Satan already has been defeated.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I wish every person who ever
[1:54:12] came to this church was here today.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] Glory be to
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Said you're living in two worlds. I'm
[1:54:29] describing it to him, not repeating
[1:54:31] myself.
[1:54:32] In redemption by power.
[1:54:36] You're in a world here, speaking of his
[1:54:39] experience, and you're in a world there.
[1:54:41] These are two worlds. This isn't just
[1:54:43] two feelings.
[1:54:46] This isn't just something that he he he
[1:54:50] was feeling uh I you know emotionally I
[1:54:53] I feel over here and I feel over here. I
[1:54:55] wasn't he was in two worlds.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; So it tore him apart
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; weakened him.
[1:55:02] And he says here,
[1:55:04] he said, "And you're in a world there
[1:55:07] and be with somebody
[1:55:11] 50 years ago."
[1:55:17] He wasn't dreaming a dream. He wasn't
[1:55:19] seeing a picture on the wall. He was
[1:55:21] with that person 50 years ago.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Literally with them. He told me of the
[1:55:28] man whose eyes had been burned out in in
[1:55:30] in India that he he he had to come out
[1:55:33] of the vision and look at the man. He
[1:55:35] saw the man turning his head and he saw
[1:55:38] him active. So he knew that he had a
[1:55:40] sight but he didn't know when it would
[1:55:42] happen. So he wanted to look at him and
[1:55:45] and and pulling out of one world into
[1:55:48] another world. And he in the vision he
[1:55:52] had graying on his sideburns. And when
[1:55:56] he kind of shook his head and looked at
[1:55:58] him, his sideburns were black. There was
[1:56:01] no gray hair. He said to me, "Then I had
[1:56:04] to exercise my faith that God would do
[1:56:07] it at that moment."
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; And he was healed by the word of the
[1:56:13] Lord out of the mouth of a prophet. He
[1:56:16] was healed. And the place went chaotic.
[1:56:18] They tried to tear the pants off of
[1:56:20] Brother Brandham to get pieces of cloth
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; from him.
[1:56:25] when I saw such a miracle.
[1:56:28] And he had challenged the James and the
[1:56:31] Muslims and the British doctors and all
[1:56:35] of those that were there. He said, "If
[1:56:37] you can give him his sight, come up here
[1:56:38] and give him his sight."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "You say that Jesus was a
[1:56:45] prophet, but Muhammad was God's
[1:56:49] prophet." He said, "If Muhammad can give
[1:56:52] him his sight, come and give him his
[1:56:54] sight.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; If your God can give him his sight,
[1:57:01] sounds like Elijah on Mount Carmel.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; If your God can do it, then come and let
[1:57:06] him do it."
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; And nobody moved.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said to me, "That place
[1:57:12] was so quiet." Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "But if I testify to you that
[1:57:16] Jesus Christ has risen from the grave,
[1:57:19] there's an empty tomb back yonder and
[1:57:21] his sight comes to him, then will you
[1:57:23] receive him as your savior?" And the man
[1:57:26] began to scream. His eyes burned out
[1:57:28] from being a sun worshipper.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a new heaven and a new
[1:57:34] earth coming into existence.
[1:57:39] Not some gift
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; as a man said when brother Brandham was
[1:57:44] exercising a gift that that gift came
[1:57:47] went came came all the time he was
[1:57:49] dwelling in that place.
[1:57:59] He said you're 50 years ago
[1:58:02] and then you may be you may be with
[1:58:05] somebody
[1:58:08] years from today to come
[1:58:12] and let you realize you're standing on
[1:58:14] the platform
[1:58:16] here and you're speaking something what
[1:58:19] happened many many years ago maybe weeks
[1:58:21] ago months ago another nation another
[1:58:24] place or something and then you try to
[1:58:26] keep yourself straight in your thinking
[1:58:29] It's quite a thing, but the Lord has
[1:58:31] blessed us so far in it and we're very
[1:58:34] happy and trust God in conference with
[1:58:37] God. He says to the man, I'm talking
[1:58:40] about absolute knowledge. You should
[1:58:42] listen to it. Conference with God.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Uh you want to if you want something
[1:58:48] from me personally, I'm dropping it into
[1:58:50] you.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; You need to have a much deeper grasp of
[1:58:55] what that ministry was. Amen.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; He comes up and starts conference with
[1:59:00] God and he says
[1:59:04] in his opening comments starts talking
[1:59:06] about a doctor.
[1:59:08] How kind they are and with tender hands
[1:59:13] they try to make life easier for the
[1:59:15] people and they you know with tender
[1:59:18] hands they take their patients and he
[1:59:20] talks so nice about the doctors. Then he
[1:59:23] preaches an entire service maybe hour
[1:59:25] and a half on conference with God. Then
[1:59:28] they call a prayer line.
[1:59:32] And the first man that comes and stands
[1:59:33] in front of them says, "You believe it,
[1:59:37] doctor, don't you?"
[1:59:40] When did you think he knew he was a
[1:59:41] doctor? He knew it at the beginning of
[1:59:43] the service.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; That's absolute knowledge.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's why he's talked like that. said,
[1:59:52] "You believe it, too, don't you, doctor
[1:59:55] and mother.
[1:59:58] You're not from here.
[2:00:00] You're from another place, from another
[2:00:03] city.
[2:00:05] You're from Canada,
[2:00:07] Vancouver,
[2:00:09] but you're not from there. You're from
[2:00:11] Finland."
[2:00:14] Anybody can take and trace
[2:00:17] that man standing there all the way
[2:00:19] back. You're not from here. You're from
[2:00:21] Vancouver. You're not from Vancouver.
[2:00:23] You're from Finland. He can take and
[2:00:24] trace you. You're not from me. You're
[2:00:26] not from this world of sin. Neither are
[2:00:28] you from you from this church. Neither
[2:00:30] are you Presbyterian. Neither are you
[2:00:31] Pentecostal. Neither are you anything
[2:00:33] else. You're a son of God, a daughter of
[2:00:36] God.
[2:00:37] And your home is in eternity. Your home
[2:00:40] is in another world.
[2:00:42] I'm not going to leave you here to
[2:00:44] mildew. I'm not going to leave you here
[2:00:46] to be burdened down with these cares.
[2:00:48] I'm not going to leave you here. I'm
[2:00:50] taking you where I am
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; of that stone
[2:01:03] that was cut out of a mountain without
[2:01:05] hands. It didn't come out of a book. It
[2:01:06] didn't come out of some theologian's
[2:01:08] mind. It didn't come out of a Bible
[2:01:10] school, some institution.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; It came from the very mind of God.
[2:01:16] came speaking through a mouth,
[2:01:18] vindicated mouth,
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I speak now personally. Oh, when I when
[2:01:26] that stone spoke,
[2:01:30] when a voice came out of that stone to
[2:01:32] me,
[2:01:35] "Come out of her and be separate, sayeth
[2:01:38] the Lord.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; You be my people."
[2:01:42] Oh, how it resounded to the very depths
[2:01:45] of my soul. Prophet, what about all
[2:01:47] these anointed ones? What about all
[2:01:49] these prophecies? What about all the
[2:01:51] speaking in tongues? What about it? And
[2:01:52] I know that their life is not right.
[2:01:54] They tell nasty jokes and all kinds of
[2:01:57] things. And he began to quote the
[2:01:59] scripture scriptures that I knew. But
[2:02:01] now it was coming from a different
[2:02:02] source.
[2:02:06] And it settled all my questions.
[2:02:14] Is it coming from another world?
[2:02:19] It's a place of absolute power.
[2:02:22] A world of absolute power.
[2:02:25] Since when? Tell me the last time you
[2:02:27] heard or where you read where any man
[2:02:29] stood in front of thousands of people
[2:02:31] and spoke these words. And every spirit
[2:02:33] in the building is subject to me by
[2:02:36] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Every spirit. Yeah,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; a lot of spirits in this building.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; This ministry came and took subject
[2:02:45] every spirit by Jesus Christ.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; What world is he in? A world where we
[2:02:51] eat, drink, and drive in a car? No,
[2:02:53] another world. A spirit world. He's in
[2:02:55] another world. I take control of your
[2:02:58] spirit.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Not once. That's not an odd phrase. That
[2:03:05] happened over and over again. He took
[2:03:08] control of the spirits.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's why he said don't move.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Don't flash a camera.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Every spirit in the name of the Lord
[2:03:21] Jesus Christ, I take possession
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; of every spirit in this building.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; When did you hear words like that?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; I take possession
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; a man.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] flesh and blood.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; A man with weaknesses.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; A man of not tired.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; A man who didn't maybe speak the queen's
[2:03:45] best English.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Think about those words. Your spirit.
[2:03:50] You don't even have control of it.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have control of it.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And here comes a man says, "I take
[2:03:58] control of it. I take possession of it."
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:04] Let me tell you that was a William
[2:04:06] Brandon speaking. God Almighty is the
[2:04:08] only one. Take possession of your soul,
[2:04:10] your spirit.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Take possession of it.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God it wasn't entrusted to
[2:04:20] some TV evangelist.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; I thank God he didn't loose my spirit to
[2:04:25] some is some minister, but he looed it
[2:04:28] to a prophet. word prophet
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; who would do it no damage
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; and wouldn't send you home wounded
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; but send you home healed send you home
[2:04:40] delivered
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; absolute power absolute knowledge
[2:04:53] and absolute authority
[2:04:56] he says and every person is now under
[2:04:59] subjection
[2:05:01] to this supernatural being.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Next time you hear a tape, next time you
[2:05:11] hear that voice, you just better think
[2:05:13] about where it originated.
[2:05:23] If you believe me as his prophet,
[2:05:27] you can receive what you desire. That
[2:05:31] was the key.
[2:05:40] And I said
[2:05:42] today
[2:05:44] before I come up to this pulpit
[2:05:47] said I'm so glad
[2:05:50] not only glad not only thankful
[2:05:53] that oh God and you begin to speak to
[2:05:56] me.
[2:05:58] There had been no voice like this. There
[2:06:00] been no prophet like this. There's been
[2:06:02] no vindication like this. You can search
[2:06:04] all your search engines. You can go
[2:06:06] through all the theology you want. You
[2:06:08] can go through all the Bible
[2:06:10] dictionaries and the Bible commentaries
[2:06:12] and the ancient fathers and the
[2:06:14] anti-sean antiian fathers and the
[2:06:16] postnian fathers. You can go through all
[2:06:19] them. You'll not find anybody saying
[2:06:21] these kind of words said, "Oh God, how
[2:06:24] thankful I am you allowed me to be
[2:06:26] called in this hour at this time under
[2:06:29] this voice. I believe that prophet's
[2:06:31] voice.
[2:06:35] So why do I say that?
[2:06:40] Because no, no one demonstrated that
[2:06:43] kind of vindication. And he gives that
[2:06:45] vindication said I can take control. I
[2:06:48] take possession of your spirit.
[2:06:51] And every spirit he said is under my
[2:06:53] control for the glory of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:56] And that supernatural being that is here
[2:06:59] now, which was that being. And I felt
[2:07:01] within my depths of my soul that being I
[2:07:04] asked him if he would be in attendance
[2:07:07] at this pulpit today and in this
[2:07:09] building today. And if you feel anything
[2:07:11] echoing down into the inner regions of
[2:07:14] your soul, it is that being. It's not
[2:07:16] me.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; It's not the emotion of the moment.
[2:07:26] what you believe the vessel to be.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And if you think I'm some kind of
[2:07:33] hypocrite,
[2:07:34] you won't get any value out of this
[2:07:36] message.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that he was a
[2:07:42] vindicated prophet of God,
[2:07:45] you'll not get what you desired.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; He was the vessel.
[2:07:56] Can I go just a few more minutes?
[2:08:05] I'll say,
[2:08:07] "Oh my,
[2:08:10] in the midst of Satan's Eden,
[2:08:13] oh, how he had developed it up."
[2:08:17] Enchanting once again,
[2:08:20] exciting.
[2:08:22] If you got burdens, he's got he's got a
[2:08:25] program that you can forget your
[2:08:26] burdens.
[2:08:30] He's got all kinds of ways and avenues
[2:08:34] for you to forget the reality of this
[2:08:37] life.
[2:08:39] You don't have to be worried about your
[2:08:41] problems.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; They've got drink,
[2:08:44] they've got drugs,
[2:08:47] they've got dollars.
[2:08:49] It's exciting.
[2:08:51] Making dollars is exciting, but I'd like
[2:08:54] to see you at the tomb
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; clutching a million bucks and see what
[2:09:01] it does for you.
[2:09:09] All kinds of ways to escape reality,
[2:09:14] but there's none like this. There's no
[2:09:17] way like the like his way
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; to escape the reality of this world. For
[2:09:23] Jesus said,
[2:09:26] you are not of this world.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; And I hope it means something more to
[2:09:30] you today. Why? He said, I'm not from
[2:09:32] this world.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; I'm from above. He said to the
[2:09:35] Pharisees, you're from below. I'm from
[2:09:37] above. I come from above. I'm going
[2:09:40] back.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:44] says, "And I'm going now to prepare a
[2:09:46] place for you,
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; and I will come again and I will receive
[2:09:50] you unto myself. I will come again and
[2:09:53] receive you unto myself." He's not going
[2:09:54] to come here, walk by the shores of
[2:09:56] Galilee or walk downtown Bellingham or
[2:09:58] Seattle or Vancouver. That's not what
[2:10:00] he's going to do. He's going to come
[2:10:02] He's going to He's going to draw near
[2:10:04] from the world that he's in and draw us
[2:10:06] into his world.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; He's not coming down to suffer in this
[2:10:10] world again. He's not coming down to
[2:10:12] taste our way of life anymore. He's
[2:10:14] going to take you into his.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; And that's so he had to start with the
[2:10:17] be. He had to start with the creation.
[2:10:19] He had to begin to say to this little
[2:10:21] lump of clay that came into the earth,
[2:10:23] let this earth bring forth,
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; not bondage, liberty. Let this earth
[2:10:29] bring forth not unrighteousness,
[2:10:32] righteousness.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Let this earth that's bound by habit and
[2:10:36] bound by the world. Let this earth bring
[2:10:39] forth
[2:10:42] Hallelujah.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; And it did.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; And it did at his word.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; It brought forth righteousness. It
[2:10:53] brought forth, brother John, a life you
[2:10:54] couldn't live yourself.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; It brought forth at the word of God.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. Sister Margaret
[2:11:04] delivered you from lupus. Now, the Elite
[2:11:07] sat there in the office and said, "Call
[2:11:09] her and curse that thing."
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was already cursed, but
[2:11:16] you believed it and it happened.
[2:11:19] Hallelujah. And he's the same God today.
[2:11:24] That demon of cancer has been destroyed
[2:11:27] at Calvary.
[2:11:31] Destroyed.
[2:11:33] God's already healed you.
[2:11:36] Nobody can heal anyone.
[2:11:39] He's already done the healing.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; It's believing it.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Believing what he sent. He that
[2:11:47] believeth on him who he has sent hath
[2:11:49] everlasting life.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; We don't believe on him who he has sent.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; That person might be right next to you.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Might be behind the pullpit.
[2:12:03] might be the prophet of God. Not might
[2:12:05] be. It is
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; that God sent
[2:12:16] in the midst of Satan's Eden.
[2:12:20] I can't quit, friends. Not for a few
[2:12:23] moments. I can't quit. In the midst of
[2:12:25] Satan's Eden, come a rock in the arm of
[2:12:29] Revelation 10:1. a mighty angel
[2:12:32] descending from heaven. He wasn't
[2:12:35] designed by any man. He come descending
[2:12:38] down into Satan's Eden to claim his
[2:12:41] bride in the end time and to wed her and
[2:12:44] to announce to her she was not of the
[2:12:47] world as I am not of the world.
[2:12:50] Hallelujah.
[2:12:52] And as Satan had no place in me, he has
[2:12:54] no place in you. And he had to tell you,
[2:12:56] your mind, your womb is sealed
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; and it's been prepared for my seed and
[2:13:02] my seed alone.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I remember this. I
[2:13:08] remember that." He says, "Forget it. I'm
[2:13:10] making you a new creature in Christ
[2:13:13] Jesus for a new world.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; I've started making the world and I must
[2:13:19] populate it."
[2:13:22] Hallelujah.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:13:37] He said now
[2:13:39] he's standing in the midst of his church
[2:13:43] revealing who he is in this last day.
[2:13:48] He calls himself the author
[2:13:51] of the creation of God. It's another
[2:13:54] creation.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; This has nothing. This has to do with
[2:13:59] the church. This is a special
[2:14:02] designation of himself. He's the creator
[2:14:05] of that church. The heavenly bridegroom
[2:14:08] created his own bride. Listen friends,
[2:14:12] we say glibly sometimes, I'm a member of
[2:14:14] the bride. But think about how this came
[2:14:17] about. This great creator who rose in
[2:14:20] the volcanic eruption out of the tomb
[2:14:23] with a new body who promised you a body
[2:14:26] like his body. He said, "I have created
[2:14:29] you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Not
[2:14:33] just a creature, but a woman, a bride
[2:14:37] for me, for myself. I designed you. I
[2:14:41] thought about you before the foundation
[2:14:43] of the world. Before Adam even walked
[2:14:45] here on earth, I thought about you.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of wisdom is that?"
[2:14:51] Absolute wisdom.
[2:15:09] He says, "The world that is to come."
[2:15:12] I'm going to close in about six, seven
[2:15:14] minutes at 1:00. The world that is to
[2:15:17] come.
[2:15:19] He said, "Right now
[2:15:22] in Revelation series, right now it is a
[2:15:24] spiritual kingdom. It is not of this
[2:15:27] world system even as we are not of this
[2:15:28] world. And that's the reason we act
[2:15:31] different from the world. Our
[2:15:32] citizenship is in heaven. We reflect the
[2:15:35] spirit. We reflect the spirit of the
[2:15:38] world of our rebirth where Jesus is the
[2:15:42] king.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you're oddball.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; You have to be. And if you're not, you
[2:15:49] better check out what you're reflecting.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; We reflect the spirit of the world that
[2:15:55] we come from. Right.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; He said in things that are to be
[2:16:04] concerning that world, he said it's
[2:16:07] continuing.
[2:16:09] It's continuing of this same life in
[2:16:12] another world,
[2:16:15] another place. You're going to be who
[2:16:17] you are. You're going to have a
[2:16:19] different body. It won't be subject to
[2:16:20] these senses
[2:16:23] in another world.
[2:16:26] And he says,
[2:16:28] "One time," referring to himself, he
[2:16:30] says, "One time I was his or Satan's
[2:16:33] property, but not now." One time the
[2:16:37] little woman was his property, but not
[2:16:40] now. He come to lose the grip of it. He
[2:16:43] lose the grip of sin, of Satan upon my
[2:16:45] life, upon your life, and now we're not
[2:16:48] his. Oh my. He said in future home, not
[2:16:52] annihilated. You're not going to be
[2:16:53] annihilated. Said, uh, not annihilated,
[2:16:56] but take your hands off it to loose it.
[2:17:01] Let it go. Pass away.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; You have, if you believe what we've been
[2:17:07] saying this morning, you have that
[2:17:11] perfect and absolute right to say, "Take
[2:17:15] your hands off of God's property
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; and keep them off. pass away. In other
[2:17:23] words, loose it, disappear.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, we let sometimes the enemy just
[2:17:32] hound and hound and stay on our case.
[2:17:34] Don't we should not do that.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Just
[2:17:39] confirm in your own heart and declare
[2:17:42] with a confession.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; He has no right.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of God's property.
[2:17:52] I'll soon conclude the absolute
[2:17:56] talk about the absolute knowledge,
[2:17:58] absolute wisdom, absolute power,
[2:18:01] absolute authority.
[2:18:03] I I can't pick up anything else. It's
[2:18:05] all here. And absolute the absolute of
[2:18:10] thus saith the Lord. Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; And I believe God has called this age
[2:18:19] into account
[2:18:22] to account with the paradigm of the
[2:18:25] original creation.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; This man we call brother Brandham. This
[2:18:32] man spoke from another world so much of
[2:18:36] the time. He described what it was like.
[2:18:38] He acted in it. and and the and and
[2:18:41] listen now, God doesn't God God doesn't
[2:18:44] honor falsehood. He acted
[2:18:47] according to what he saw in another
[2:18:49] world and the results was in this world.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me he didn't have some
[2:18:55] authority.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; And he did that not to raise up his
[2:19:02] position, but that you and I would
[2:19:04] understand where this is coming from.
[2:19:07] Yes.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Don't look on it just as you know
[2:19:10] healing for the body or something to
[2:19:12] make life better here. It's to prepare
[2:19:14] you for that world.
[2:19:30] The world
[2:19:32] which is to come.
[2:19:36] Prophet said
[2:19:38] Jesus didn't know,
[2:19:42] people didn't know what world he was in.
[2:19:46] He was in another. He said something
[2:19:48] happens.
[2:19:51] It's another world. There's no no need
[2:19:54] of trying to explain it. So he said it
[2:19:56] can't be explained.
[2:20:05] says, "Now, is this announcement or is
[2:20:08] this correct?" I feel a little time
[2:20:10] pressure now as I said a close.
[2:20:13] But he says, "We are in an exodus."
[2:20:17] You're actually,
[2:20:19] you say, "Well, I turned another
[2:20:21] birthday.
[2:20:23] I'm 50 now or I'm 40 now or I'm 60 or
[2:20:26] I'm 70 or whatever more.
[2:20:31] That's not how you're moving along.
[2:20:36] get my message.
[2:20:38] You are being You talk about jet
[2:20:41] propulsion.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; We've got word propulsion.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; We're being propelled by the word that
[2:20:47] was spoken.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; And God is moving you sometimes
[2:20:51] imperceptibly
[2:20:52] and you I want you to get your eyes off
[2:20:55] of your personal aging process and and
[2:20:59] have your eyes more on God moving you
[2:21:02] through this age. And if a prophet if
[2:21:04] the prophet didn't come and say you're
[2:21:06] 50, he said you're in an exodus.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Do I have to tell you this world's
[2:21:17] passing away?
[2:21:19] Jesus said it was passing away.
[2:21:22] Paul said in Hebrews
[2:21:24] that they perish but thou remainest and
[2:21:28] they all wax. He's talking about the
[2:21:31] earth and the heavens. They all wax old
[2:21:33] as doth a garment and as a vesture thou
[2:21:36] shalt fold them up and they shall be
[2:21:39] changed but thou art the same. Someone
[2:21:43] uh Sister Magda I believe it was sent me
[2:21:46] gotten some various emails and uh
[2:21:50] addresses where they have pictures of
[2:21:52] the tsunami. Of course, we don't want to
[2:21:55] keep referring to that, but they had
[2:21:58] satellite pictures of the areas before
[2:22:01] and after. Very, very clear, very sharp,
[2:22:04] very detailed. And I can tell you that
[2:22:08] God allowed the coastlines to change.
[2:22:14] That which was a certain shape before is
[2:22:16] in that shape today because of what was
[2:22:20] allowed in this tremendous eruption.
[2:22:23] That's only a small eruption.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Tell you what
[2:22:29] he said. Los Angeles
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; will slide into the ocean.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to be filled with fear
[2:22:36] and run here, run there, or run any
[2:22:38] other place, but it's going to be it's
[2:22:41] going to slide into the ocean for her
[2:22:44] sin and her corruption.
[2:22:47] I was doing some research, but listen,
[2:22:52] uh, I'm just going to be quick.
[2:23:01] Brother Brandham speaks about the
[2:23:02] invasion of America.
[2:23:07] I don't want you to hear it.
[2:23:09] America, Canada, it's all six of one,
[2:23:11] half a dozen of another.
[2:23:15] Here's how he starts out. Notice
[2:23:18] in France they started all their
[2:23:20] rottness and going on the way they lived
[2:23:23] over there and then God sent Germany in
[2:23:27] to them to beat them off a little bit.
[2:23:30] Then we went over there to save their
[2:23:33] hide.
[2:23:35] And as soon as we done that and won the
[2:23:37] war, sent the Germans back, had peace
[2:23:41] with France,
[2:23:43] did they turn to God?
[2:23:46] No, sir. Woman, wine, debauchery,
[2:23:51] sin, filth to the gills.
[2:23:55] Then what did they do? What happened?
[2:23:58] Here's where we started. The devil set
[2:24:02] up his headquarters there.
[2:24:05] There's where he started right there to
[2:24:08] demoralize the world from Paris, France.
[2:24:13] Then if you notice, he couldn't set he
[2:24:17] couldn't get in here through the
[2:24:19] ministry.
[2:24:21] So the thing that he done, you have to
[2:24:23] remember this 54. He couldn't get in
[2:24:25] here through the ministry. So the thing
[2:24:27] that he done was come in to Hollywood
[2:24:30] out here.
[2:24:32] Now, I'm not done,
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; but just remember now, there's the same
[2:24:37] mouth that says to a man standing here,
[2:24:39] you're not from this place. You're not
[2:24:41] from this country. You're from another
[2:24:43] place. You're it's it's Canada. It's
[2:24:45] Vancouver, but you're not from there.
[2:24:47] You're from Finland. Now, he's following
[2:24:50] the corruption of the nation
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; and the invasion of the very country
[2:24:56] he's in.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; And it says the power had its
[2:25:00] headquarters. It was seated over there
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; and there was a physical war. There was
[2:25:06] a physical conflict and we went over
[2:25:08] there and and armies were exchanged wars
[2:25:11] and battle and some were defeated and
[2:25:13] some won some victory. But was there any
[2:25:16] cleanness to it? No.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; And what they did he said they couldn't
[2:25:20] get in here through through the
[2:25:21] ministry. So the thing that he done was
[2:25:24] come in to Hollywood out here. He set up
[2:25:27] his headquarters over here in Hollywood.
[2:25:30] The devil landed back here a few years
[2:25:33] ago, 15 or 20 years ago. He was so
[2:25:38] accurate,
[2:25:41] it would shake you in your boots, if you
[2:25:44] even saw the rest of my notes. He's so
[2:25:47] accurate of the time
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; that that Hollywood begin to take its
[2:25:53] power. And he talked about the
[2:25:55] backsliding Wall Street Jews. And it was
[2:25:58] the Jews who came over in the early
[2:26:01] 1900s and they came to they came to
[2:26:04] California to escape Edison's Edison had
[2:26:09] copyright on moving pictures and they
[2:26:12] wanted to escape his agents so they came
[2:26:14] all the way to California so they could
[2:26:17] get away from the royalties on his on
[2:26:21] his uh uh
[2:26:24] what do I want to say on his patents.
[2:26:27] And so that's why they settled over
[2:26:29] there and and uh uh Goldwin Meyer and
[2:26:34] Zukov and Zukardis and Fox and all these
[2:26:39] guys are Jews.
[2:26:42] When you think for a moment that when
[2:26:44] when God
[2:26:47] has already prophesied and Jews who
[2:26:51] ought to be in Israel
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; now have become so degraded,
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; so backslid that they become the very
[2:27:01] instrument to spew out the perversion of
[2:27:04] Eden across the whole world out of
[2:27:08] Hollywood where a little prophet stand
[2:27:10] up when everybody scream screaming,
[2:27:12] "Fight communism, fight communism, fight
[2:27:13] communism." And he stands up with one
[2:27:15] voice says, "Forget communism." It's
[2:27:18] just a tool in the hand of God. Satan's
[2:27:21] got a seat in Hollywood. Hollywood gave
[2:27:24] you the fashions that's in our stores.
[2:27:26] Hollywood has given you all the
[2:27:27] magazines that's on the magazine rack.
[2:27:30] Hollywood has made popular
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; the rise of woman
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; in the world and the disgrace of her
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; as well. her righteous and her god-given
[2:27:44] uh graces that the prophet speaks about.
[2:27:47] Hollywood has dragged them. He says, "I
[2:27:50] feel sorry for them." And they turn
[2:27:51] around, call him an enemy of the women.
[2:27:54] He
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; said, "I feel sorry for them."
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "They're in a trap. They're in
[2:28:00] a snare.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Don't even know what they're doing.
[2:28:04] Hollywood did it.
[2:28:18] He says he went in with his great army
[2:28:20] and went and hit in Hollywood,
[2:28:23] California.
[2:28:25] He's invaded the United States with his
[2:28:28] demon powers.
[2:28:31] Right. All of our fashions come from
[2:28:35] Paris. They get into Hollywood and onto
[2:28:38] the screen and these little girls and
[2:28:40] little boys and he goes on. He's
[2:28:43] preaching on the invasion of America.
[2:28:45] There wouldn't be very many that would
[2:28:46] believe that back then,
[2:28:51] but America
[2:28:54] and our nation has rotted from within.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; We have no substance left.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; We have no integrity left. and it's been
[2:29:05] accepted.
[2:29:07] And I thought I would just do a little
[2:29:09] looking and see
[2:29:11] how the world has even connected
[2:29:14] Hollywood with Babylon. And that's a
[2:29:17] very famous book,
[2:29:20] Babylon, Hollywood,
[2:29:23] and they trace its history.
[2:29:26] And they said that this book, this book
[2:29:31] has uncovered
[2:29:34] all of those hidden dark secrets of
[2:29:38] Hollywood. On the cover is Marilyn
[2:29:40] Monroe, not very well-dressed.
[2:29:46] Now, I'm concluding.
[2:29:51] United States is the greatest power in
[2:29:55] the entire earth
[2:29:57] and President Bush is the most powerful
[2:30:00] man
[2:30:01] on earth as far as military power is
[2:30:05] concerned. This last election
[2:30:09] they said was influenced by two movie
[2:30:12] directors,
[2:30:14] Mel Gibson and Michael Moore.
[2:30:18] And one brought forth The Passion of
[2:30:21] Christ, which they thought would be a
[2:30:22] flop and has been an enormous success
[2:30:26] financially speaking. And Mel Gibson did
[2:30:29] that. And this Michael Moore targeted
[2:30:33] the President Bush and his family.
[2:30:37] And he and both of them galvanized two
[2:30:40] groups in America. And that is why
[2:30:42] America was divided right down the
[2:30:44] middle. And Mel Gibson, they said,
[2:30:47] galvanized all the fundamental
[2:30:49] Christians and brought them in behind
[2:30:52] President Bush. And Michael Moore
[2:30:54] galvanized all the liberals.
[2:30:58] galvanized them all on the Democratic
[2:31:01] side with his movie of Fahrenheit 9/11,
[2:31:06] I guess it was.
[2:31:08] And the United States right today
[2:31:11] has a grave concern that their political
[2:31:15] power is going to be dictated from
[2:31:18] Hollywood
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; because those are the people. I have a
[2:31:27] list here of the celebrities that were
[2:31:31] working for the Democrats and the
[2:31:33] celebrities working for the liberals.
[2:31:38] And I can tell you it is some eyeopener.
[2:31:41] And there's article after article after
[2:31:43] article about how they influenced and
[2:31:46] how they affected and what they should
[2:31:47] have done, what they shouldn't have
[2:31:48] done, and how the Democrat should have
[2:31:51] shouldn't allow this celebrity to say
[2:31:52] thus or thus or thus. And so what are
[2:31:54] they saying? What did the prophets say?
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; What do they say? And do you think that
[2:31:59] devil changed his colors just because he
[2:32:01] went from Hollywood into politics?
[2:32:03] That's why he said Satan is in control
[2:32:06] of politics.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; But we didn't dream when we first read
[2:32:11] that. When we first heard that how he
[2:32:14] was going to control the politics, we
[2:32:16] didn't dream that the whole economy of
[2:32:19] the world, are you listening? was going
[2:32:22] to go from agriculture pre-cond world
[2:32:24] war
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; and then because of war because of death
[2:32:28] because 54 million people died the world
[2:32:32] became industrialized
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; suddenly isn't that marvelous now it
[2:32:37] became industrialized and we got more
[2:32:40] things and more material things and more
[2:32:42] wealth and then it went from the
[2:32:44] industrial revolution to the technical
[2:32:46] revolution and the world become driven
[2:32:48] the economies of the world become driven
[2:32:50] by technology and the computer and the
[2:32:53] advancement along that line. But now
[2:32:56] they have announced and statistically so
[2:32:58] that the economies of the world is
[2:33:01] driven by entertainment
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; and entertainment has its roots in
[2:33:06] Hollywood and of every if Satan himself
[2:33:10] and every demon from hell has made it
[2:33:12] its headquarters what is the world
[2:33:14] getting ready for judgment.
[2:33:17] There's no way to escape it. They've
[2:33:20] glamorized homosexuality
[2:33:23] and lesbianism and every kind of
[2:33:26] terrible sin. They've glamorized it.
[2:33:29] They haven't only made it acceptable,
[2:33:31] they made it popular.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Who could do that? But those people,
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; it's a hell hole.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; And God's going to sink it.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; And a prophet said it's going to slide
[2:33:46] into the ocean.
[2:33:50] There are no doubt be waves. I'm not a
[2:33:52] bit afraid. They say, "Well, you're on
[2:33:53] the West Coast. I'm safer in God's will
[2:33:56] in the middle of a tornado or in the
[2:33:58] middle of a war or on the top of a
[2:34:00] volcano when we're in the middle of
[2:34:02] God's will." God has to have that kind
[2:34:04] of voice here.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; And from this place, the gospel has been
[2:34:09] able to go to China, to Yugoslavia, to
[2:34:14] Serbia, to Congo. And the message has
[2:34:17] gone so many places and to India and the
[2:34:20] Philippines and in the in Indonesia. Got
[2:34:23] a call from Brother Ernie.
[2:34:26] Got a call from Brother Ernie. He was at
[2:34:28] the airport. He said, "Brother Ed,
[2:34:30] there's about a hundred at least a
[2:34:32] hundred ambulances outside and they're
[2:34:36] firing the wounded and the injured from
[2:34:39] the tsunami." He said, "I've never He
[2:34:40] said it's like being in the middle of
[2:34:42] the tribulation.
[2:34:51] This world is not my home.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up somewhere
[2:35:00] beyond the blue.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; The angels beckoned me from heaven's
[2:35:06] open door.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; And I don't feel at home
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; in this world anymore.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad?
[2:35:14] I say, "Let this world go.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be tied up with it. Don't be taken
[2:35:19] up with it. It's passing away." Jesus
[2:35:22] said it is.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it 2,000 years ago, and
[2:35:25] you're living to see it.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:35:35] you. And if heaven's not my home, then
[2:35:40] Lord, what would I do? The angels beckon
[2:35:45] me from heaven's open door. And I can't
[2:35:51] feel at home in this world anymore.
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; You want to think these things over
[2:36:03] seriously?
[2:36:05] If you would think them over seriously.
[2:36:07] I've been long no service tonight.
[2:36:13] just pray for us. I'm thinking about
[2:36:16] things that I've never thought about
[2:36:17] before.
[2:36:19] It's
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; really amazing what God is doing. I want
[2:36:22] to be in the center of his will. I want
[2:36:24] to keep every word
[2:36:27] for I want to hear welcome.
[2:36:30] Well done. Let's stand. Thank you for
[2:36:32] your kindness and your patience sitting
[2:36:35] and waiting such as you have. I want to
[2:36:38] thank brother Lance for his uh gracious
[2:36:42] uh attitude and he was all ready for
[2:36:45] tonight. Brother Lance has a message
[2:36:47] very much on his heart and I just felt
[2:36:50] that it's too valuable to have our
[2:36:52] brother Lance preach and a third of the
[2:36:54] people miss it or some try to get on
[2:36:58] stream and you can't stream now near as
[2:37:01] well when so many people are on it. And
[2:37:04] so I want he's going to be speaking the
[2:37:07] 23rd
[2:37:08] and I think the 30th, the last two
[2:37:10] Sundays of this month. So, Brother Lance
[2:37:14] has a word from God on his heart and we
[2:37:17] want to hear it.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. I'm just a
[2:37:27] passing through. My treasures are laid
[2:37:31] down somewhere beyond
[2:37:36] angels
[2:37:38] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[2:37:43] feel at all in this world anymore.
[2:37:48] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:37:52] you. And if heaven's not my home, then
[2:37:57] Lord, what would I do? The angels said
[2:38:01] to me from heaven's open door, and I
[2:38:06] can't feel at home in this pure anymore.
[2:38:11] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[2:38:15] thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus.
[2:38:21] years ago.
[2:38:23] I know you see me through though I am
[2:38:27] weak and poor and I can't
[2:38:31] [Music]
[2:38:33] anymore.
[2:38:34] Oh Lord know I have no friend like you.
[2:38:40] And if heaven's not my own then what
[2:38:44] will I do? The angels can't be me from
[2:38:49] heaven's open door. And I can't feel at
[2:38:53] home in this world anymore.
[2:38:58] Destroy in the glory land. We live
[2:39:02] eternally.
[2:39:03] And saints on every
[2:39:07] victory.
[2:39:09] The song is still praying
[2:39:12] back from heaven shore and I can't hold
[2:39:18] this world anymore.
[2:39:21] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:39:25] you. And if heaven's not my home, then
[2:39:30] Lord, what would I do? the angels back
[2:39:33] to me from heaven's open door. And I
[2:39:38] can't feel at home in this world
[2:39:42] anymore.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a people that could
[2:39:46] say, "These are the days of Elijah."
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's what makes you what you are.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:57] [Music]
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; It'd be good to sing that. made a

[2:40:54] These are the days of Elijah
[2:40:59] preparing the word of the Lord.
[2:41:05] And we are the prophets of
[2:41:09] angels, righteousness
[2:41:13] restored.
[2:41:15] And all these are days of trial
[2:41:21] of
[2:41:22] confidence and sorrow.
[2:41:27] We were the Lord in the desert crying
[2:41:32] preparing away.

[2:41:54] Salvation
[2:41:56] God

[2:42:09] these are the days of his servant Elijah
[2:42:14] rebuilding the altar of praise
[2:42:19] and the days of the highest.
[2:42:25] We are in your world
[2:42:30] and we are

[2:43:40] salsa
[2:43:45] here.
[2:43:47] I wonder if we could just bow our heads
[2:43:49] in prayer.
[2:43:52] And I wonder if God moved upon
[2:43:55] the congregation and you're here and
[2:43:58] you're not ready for that moment. You're
[2:44:01] not ready for that time and you want to
[2:44:04] say, "I want lift my hand. I want to
[2:44:07] identify myself. I want to be prepared.
[2:44:11] I want the Holy Spirit now to do that
[2:44:14] final work in my life.
[2:44:17] Oh God.
[2:44:20] Oh God,
[2:44:23] you are already healed. You are already
[2:44:25] delivered.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; You're already set free. And if you want
[2:44:29] somebody to pray with you, you just step
[2:44:30] forward and come down here. We'd be
[2:44:32] happy to pray with you. We got men of
[2:44:34] God, deacons, and we got ministers and
[2:44:36] so on be happy to pray with you. Feel
[2:44:39] like you'd like to come? You need to
[2:44:41] come. Oh God,
[2:44:44] Father,
[2:44:45] we know not what more to do,
[2:44:50] we spoke what was so heavily laid upon
[2:44:53] my own heart woke up
[2:44:56] and I was thinking and pondering and
[2:44:59] rejoicing in
[2:45:02] when that voice resounded deep within my
[2:45:05] own young heart.
[2:45:07] Oh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2:45:11] God that showed himself in Boaz, a
[2:45:16] kinsman redeemer.
[2:45:18] God revealed in Jesus Christ, and there
[2:45:21] is no God
[2:45:23] but Jehovah. There is no God but you.
[2:45:27] There are people here, Lord. They need
[2:45:29] to believe what you have said. They need
[2:45:32] to believe your word right now. They
[2:45:34] need every shackle of their mind to be
[2:45:36] broken aunder.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; Loose their mind, Satan, in the name of
[2:45:44] Jesus Christ.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; May the traditions and may the bonds of
[2:45:51] their emotion and their spirit be burst
[2:45:55] Lord so that the word can penetrate to
[2:45:57] the soul.
[2:46:00] Let the soul soar out of its cage.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Let it rise.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Let the soul of man and woman rise.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; oh God, gracious and merciful,
[2:46:22] gracious and merciful.
[2:46:25] Show now your amazing grace. Would you?
[2:46:29] Would you, Lord, upon each life that's
[2:46:32] represented by a raised hand
[2:46:35] and more by a raised heart,
[2:46:38] God, I pray you'll make us so serious
[2:46:40] with your word and you make us so
[2:46:43] serious with this message that you send.
[2:46:47] Make us so serious and sincere with our
[2:46:50] faith.
[2:46:52] Help me, Lord, also
[2:46:54] be more sincere. I pray father do this
[2:46:59] great work this gracious work upon every
[2:47:02] life in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:47:06] The name of Jesus Christ. We now step
[2:47:10] into that world of absolute wisdom that
[2:47:12] absolute authority and absolute power.
[2:47:16] Your word has declared whom the son sets
[2:47:18] free is free indeed.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; And we do not have to add anything into
[2:47:23] it. It's not Calvary Plus. It's Calvary
[2:47:26] and Calvary alone. It's the blood and
[2:47:28] the blood alone. It's the word and the
[2:47:31] word alone. For the word and the blood
[2:47:33] and Christ are all one, synonymous.
[2:47:37] Father,
[2:47:39] may
[2:47:41] their lives now be touched by the
[2:47:43] brooding of your spirit upon them in
[2:47:46] Jesus Christ's name.
[2:47:50] In Jesus Christ's name.
[2:48:00] I think we'll just while the brothers
[2:48:01] are here

[2:49:20] for his son.
[2:49:23] When he reached out his hand
[2:49:27] for me. Once my soul was a stray. Once

[2:51:55] While we're in this prayerful
[2:51:56] atmosphere, I'm going to ask brother
[2:51:57] Diddy to come ask God's blessing upon
[2:52:00] the people and dismiss us in his grace.
[2:52:04] And also, I'm going to ask him to pray
[2:52:06] that a a spirit of revelation will
[2:52:10] continue upon us. I believe that God is
[2:52:12] seeking to do something within our
[2:52:14] church,
[2:52:15] in the believer's heart. It's the hour,
[2:52:17] friend. It must happen. It just must
[2:52:19] happen.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; Something's taking place within us.
[2:52:25] and a prayer request. Brother DDA has
[2:52:27] just been phoned in from Poland and a
[2:52:30] sister is in bedridden with multiple
[2:52:33] cerosis
[2:52:35] and needs to be delivered. Brother Greg
[2:52:37] Novakowski has just phoned it into us.
[2:52:40] So if you'll just take that request as
[2:52:42] well, brother Diddy, please.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name, great one.
[2:52:53] our hearts rejoice this morning, Father
[2:52:56] God,
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; to be allowed this great privilege, oh
[2:53:00] God, of standing in your presence.
[2:53:03] Lord, realizing that these things didn't
[2:53:05] just happen, oh God, with the prophet or
[2:53:09] will happen, oh God, but they're
[2:53:10] happening right here in our midst,
[2:53:12] Father. Even as you lead your servant,
[2:53:15] Father, and the word opening up, Father,
[2:53:17] dimension, as it were, to lift our souls
[2:53:20] into a higher realm, oh God, we desire
[2:53:23] to be sensitized to these things. Oh
[2:53:25] God, we desire to see you, Father, in
[2:53:28] your unveiling in this present hour,
[2:53:31] dear God, as it's going from glory unto
[2:53:33] glory. We want to hold on to those
[2:53:35] things, oh God, and see them become
[2:53:38] effectual in our lives. see them affect
[2:53:40] us so deeply, so profoundly, dear God,
[2:53:43] that we'll be more sensitized to that
[2:53:46] other world, oh God, as we are, Father,
[2:53:49] finding ourselves in the midst of this
[2:53:51] great collision, Father, hearing from
[2:53:54] our theophony, oh God, bumping into them
[2:53:56] day by day, Father, thing that influence
[2:53:59] gloring upon our lives day by day. Lord,
[2:54:02] we want to be yielded to it, oh God. We
[2:54:05] just pray that you continue to lead your
[2:54:07] servant in this way. May you make our
[2:54:09] hearts, oh God, ready to receive more of
[2:54:12] your word, Father. That our cap can run
[2:54:14] over, Father. That it'll be overflowing
[2:54:16] with your goodness, dear God. That's our
[2:54:19] cry, that our desire, that is our prayer
[2:54:21] today, dear God. That you just continue
[2:54:24] with each believer, Father. That sacred
[2:54:27] atmosphere will go with us, dear God.
[2:54:30] Lord, even as we lay our hand upon this
[2:54:32] need, we believe that God had that heard
[2:54:35] our prayer before, he's able to minister
[2:54:38] to this need. Lord God, cancer is not an
[2:54:41] issue to you, oh God. Mentoposclerosis
[2:54:44] is nothing to you, oh God. We just pray
[2:54:46] that faith will take a hold. That this
[2:54:49] one who's in need can look to Calvary
[2:54:51] and know that the redemption that was
[2:54:54] paid there, the price that was paid was
[2:54:57] to secure this healing. Father, may you
[2:54:59] receive it, oh God, for your church
[2:55:02] believes today. Lord, our heart is full
[2:55:05] with faith. Father, faith that has come
[2:55:08] from hearing your word today. We believe
[2:55:11] the things that we have heard. We can
[2:55:13] say even as Aturuite did, this is
[2:55:16] nothing but the truth. Oh God, let that
[2:55:19] bring the right atmosphere. Oh God, that
[2:55:21] a promise can become our possession
[2:55:23] today. Oh father, we so thank you for
[2:55:27] your servant who labors in the word. We
[2:55:30] see the pressure oh God that is upon him
[2:55:33] to bring this hidden mana. Lord God,
[2:55:36] it's not theology that it's the Holy
[2:55:39] Ghost.
[2:55:42] The same God that was with that prophet.
[2:55:45] We see him moving right in our midst. Oh
[2:55:47] God, we feel so privileged, dear God,
[2:55:51] that you have counted us worthy, Father,
[2:55:54] to be beneficiary of your resurrection.
[2:55:57] Oh God, how we bless your name this
[2:56:00] morning. How we want to give you thanks,
[2:56:03] oh God, at a heart of sincerity this
[2:56:06] morning, Lord. Our grateful we are that
[2:56:10] you have remembered us, oh God, that you
[2:56:12] have come our way today. That you have
[2:56:15] touched our lives, oh God, that you have
[2:56:17] called even some to give themselves
[2:56:20] unreservedly this morning. Let the Holy
[2:56:22] Spirit seal these lives with the baptism
[2:56:25] of fire that there'll be such a
[2:56:28] difference. Oh God, that is our prayer.
[2:56:31] That is our desire. This is your place
[2:56:34] of business, Father. And we pray that
[2:56:36] you deal with every heart as we go
[2:56:39] thanking you, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[2:56:42] name. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:56:53] We give you God's blessings and
[2:56:55] greetings. Greet one another,
[2:56:59] Lord. Give you gracious afternoon. Lord
[2:57:02] willing, we'll see you on Wednesday.
[2:57:07] Amen.
[2:57:08] Dismissed in the holy name of Jesus
[2:57:10] Christ. Amen. God bless you.
