[10:48] &gt;&gt; We just want him to be welcome in our
[10:50] midst this morning. Hallelujah. Okay,
[10:52] we're going to ask the brothers if
[10:53] [music] they would come for the morning
[10:55] offering and open the service in a word
[10:57] of prayer.
[11:00] Amen. Our brother Mike Gier has a note
[11:02] here. Testimony. [music] He says, "I'm
[11:03] sorry that he failed to report after
[11:05] having prayer for a co-orker son who had
[11:07] to have open heart surgery. [music]
[11:09] All went well. The valve did not need
[11:11] replacing, only repair, and [music] this
[11:12] is bringing the family closer to God.
[11:14] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your
[11:16] prayers." Amen.
[11:19] It was a request that we would just
[11:20] please remember [music] our sister Helen
[11:22] Bisberger. She suffered a mini stroke
[11:23] and a possible heart attack on Saturday
[11:25] afternoon, but who was caught early and
[11:27] on time and she's now at the Langley
[11:29] Hospital under observation. She would
[11:31] very much appreciate our prayers for a
[11:33] [music] speedy recovery. And I believe
[11:34] brother Tom was at the hospital this
[11:36] morning having prayer with sister Helen.
[11:38] Maybe we could just continue to lift her
[11:40] up this morning. Brother West Ny [music]
[11:42] Garden, could you come please open the
[11:43] service for us? Let's remember the camp
[11:46] in the upcoming week. Many are already
[11:48] there sacrificing their time to prepare
[11:50] things for us. [music] Amen. I just I
[11:53] know there's a mighty expectation. We're
[11:54] believing God's going to do great things
[11:57] not [music] only at camp but this
[11:58] morning in our midst. Amen. Are you
[12:00] expecting to hear from the Lord this
[12:02] morning? God bless you. If there's a
[12:04] need on your heart and you just like
[12:05] [music] to lift him before the Lord with
[12:06] an upraised hand. Thank you, brother
[12:07] Wes.
[12:16] Gracious heavenly father.
[12:19] Lord God, it is such a privilege to

[12:51] Father.
[12:52] Lord, it's just not by mistake or a
[12:55] chance, Lord God, that we're here,
[12:57] Father. Lord, every [music] person in
[13:00] every place,
[13:02] Father God, it was in your mind before
[13:04] the beginning of time, Lord God, that we
[13:06] would be here to hear your word brought
[13:08] forth, Father.
[13:10] Lord, we've [music] come from many
[13:12] miles, Lord. Some from close by, some
[13:15] from the other side of this world,
[13:17] [music] Lord, this earth, Father.
[13:20] Lord, we've come to hear your word.
[13:22] [music] We've come to receive, Father,
[13:24] we've come to praise your name, Father.
[13:27] Lord, Lord, we've [music] come to sing
[13:29] praises to your name, Lord, to join our
[13:31] voice with our brothers and sisters,
[13:34] Lord, to make a joyful sound unto you,
[13:36] Lord God, because we love you, Father.
[13:39] Lord God, we look to you as our savior.
[13:41] We thank you, Lord God, for being our
[13:43] father. We thank you for being our
[13:44] healer, Lord God. Father, you are our
[13:48] all and all. Father, Lord, you are such
[13:50] a wonderful father, Lord. Father, we
[13:53] give you the praise. [music] You are
[13:55] worthy. We give you the glory for only
[13:58] you are worthy, Lord. Father, [music] we
[14:00] come and ask, Lord God, that you would
[14:02] just anoint us this morning, Lord God.
[14:05] Anoint our pastor as he comes forth,
[14:07] Lord God. We thank you for the gift that
[14:09] you've placed in his life, Lord God.
[14:12] Father, we as brothers and sisters, as
[14:15] sons and daughters of you, Lord God,
[14:17] we're going to sit this morning and
[14:19] receive your word, Lord God. Father, may
[14:21] we focus in on your word with laser beam
[14:23] accuracy, Lord God, and concentration,
[14:25] Lord God. Father, we see this world
[14:28] falling away, Lord God, but we see your
[14:30] word coming forth strong and mighty,
[14:32] Lord God. Father, we are sons and
[14:35] daughters, but we are soldiers for you,
[14:37] Lord God. Mighty soldiers, Father.
[14:40] [music] Lord, we love you. We appreciate
[14:42] you, Father. You've done so much for us,
[14:44] Lord. You've unfolded and opened up your
[14:46] word, [music] Father. Lord, you've
[14:48] opened and revealed and manifested your
[14:50] revelations to us, Lord God. Father, we
[14:53] come before you this morning with needs,
[14:55] Father. Lord, our sister has had a
[14:58] stroke, a heart attack. Father, Lord, we
[15:00] just ask that you would just move in and
[15:02] touch her, Lord. Touch and heal her,
[15:04] Lord God. Let her know that you are
[15:06] always with her, Lord God. You never
[15:08] leave her. You're as close as a whisper,
[15:10] Lord God. A word upon her lips, Lord
[15:13] God. Healing upon her lips, Father.
[15:16] Healing upon our lips. We're speaking it
[15:18] for her, Father.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just ask you'd be with her. Be
[15:22] with her family, Lord God. Father,
[15:24] there's many hands that were lifted up.
[15:26] My hand was lifted up. You know the
[15:28] desires. You know the need. You know the
[15:30] petition, Lord God. Father, we just put
[15:32] [music] it before you, Lord. Father, we
[15:34] have many visiting, Father, in
[15:36] preparation for our camp. We want to
[15:38] remember our camp, Lord. [music] Father,
[15:40] just move in a supernatural way, Father.
[15:43] Change lives, save souls, Father. Lord,
[15:46] may we all be there with one purpose,
[15:48] Father, as we travel from [music] far
[15:50] distances. We just ask for journeys,
[15:52] mercies, Lord God. Father, if there's
[15:54] any prayer requests I've missed, you
[15:56] know what they are, Father. We just put
[15:57] them at your feet, Lord God. And thank
[15:59] you for answering them. Thank you for
[16:01] being the wonderful father that you are,
[16:03] Lord. Father, we just ask you to [music]
[16:05] bless the remainder of the service.
[16:07] Bless brother Ed as he comes forward.
[16:09] Bless the song leader, Lord God. We
[16:11] thank you for all of them, Lord. Bless
[16:12] the the musicians. We thank them for
[16:14] their dedication and their time, Lord
[16:16] God. Father, again, we just want to say
[16:18] that we love you. We appreciate you,
[16:20] Lord. And now as we take up this
[16:22] offering, we thank you for those gifts
[16:25] that you have given to us. Lord God, we
[16:27] just give back to you. Father, bless the
[16:29] gift and the giver. In Jesus Christ's
[16:31] name we pray. Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. Amen. Why
[16:41] don't we sing that as we take up the
[16:42] offering? You may have your seats. Also,
[16:45] I'm [music] just gonna ask if the
[16:46] Nigerian believers, they have a song for
[16:49] us, if they would just come and get
[16:50] ready while we're taking up the offering
[16:52] this morning. Amen.

[28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in the house of
[28:48] God?
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; We're so happy to be here this morning
[28:53] and uh just feel the
[28:57] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:00] &gt;&gt; with us.
[29:02] Uh I have just a few things I'd like to
[29:04] mention before we turn to the word. Uh
[29:07] we've been in contact with uh brother
[29:10] Dimmitri
[29:11] uh in Norway and I mentioned we have
[29:14] prayed for him and his family and I
[29:17] would like if you would continue to pray
[29:19] for him. There are some complications
[29:22] uh with their time. They're only allowed
[29:24] to be in Norway until September.
[29:27] And I can just say this that the wife
[29:30] and the three daughters have have uh one
[29:34] type of entrance into Norway and able to
[29:37] stay there perhaps uh uh as as visitors
[29:41] and the others as tourists, the father
[29:43] and the son as tourists. So it raises a
[29:46] little bit of a complication, but they
[29:48] would like to uh uh find entrance here
[29:50] to Canada. And uh so we just want to
[29:54] pray for them. Pray also for brother
[29:56] Vladimir and the church in the Ukraine.
[29:59] That's the church that God helped us to
[30:01] build. We provided the funds and the
[30:04] people there provided all the work and
[30:07] they worked so wonderfully. They worked
[30:10] in the bitter winter. I admire them so
[30:12] so much and uh built one of out of a
[30:16] just a like a bombed out structure. But
[30:19] they built a church that is probably one
[30:22] in fact as I to my knowledge it's the
[30:25] largest church in Europe and at its
[30:28] dedication I think there was probably
[30:30] around uh 700 people. I heard there was
[30:33] even nine, but um the numbers don't mean
[30:37] anything to God. But right now, Daetsk,
[30:40] the city that the church is in, is in
[30:44] the eastern part, which is more under
[30:48] the influence of Moscow and Russia. And
[30:51] there's a lot of Russian nationals that
[30:53] are there. And so there's a lot of war
[30:55] and fighting that is going on. And some
[30:57] families have fled. They have gone to
[31:00] different places. Some have gone down to
[31:02] Alooa. Brother Vladimir said in a email
[31:06] to brother Tim Dodd that they are mostly
[31:09] with young children or with teenagers
[31:12] some families but they continue with uh
[31:15] three meetings a week and uh but the the
[31:18] city there is a a lot of struggle going
[31:21] on there and so we just want to remember
[31:23] them. Remember that God hears prayer and
[31:26] God as it was in the Philippines
[31:29] protected for those of you that don't
[31:31] know in the Philippines of that terrible
[31:34] destructive typhoon there was a church
[31:36] and the pastor felt and sometimes it's
[31:40] good to listen to the pastor the pastor
[31:42] felt led to invite the people to come
[31:45] and pray all night and they went to the
[31:48] church and prayed.
[31:52] Uh there were some that had left and
[31:55] they kind of went their own way and it
[31:58] was not good for them. I'll say it that
[32:00] much. But next to the church is a
[32:03] hospital and the hospital is two stories
[32:06] and the church is only a one-story
[32:09] little structure.
[32:10] And in the hospital the water line is up
[32:14] at the second floor above the roof of
[32:16] this church. You can see it in the
[32:18] pictures. We showed it here on the
[32:19] slides. And it's above the it's at the
[32:22] second floor
[32:24] and uh and there was such destruction
[32:26] and the tidal wave tsunami wave went
[32:29] through the whole city devastated it. A
[32:33] city of a quarter of a million people
[32:36] devastated it and the church which is
[32:38] right here and right next to it the
[32:40] hospital and just destroyed everything.
[32:44] this church. How it survived, I do not
[32:47] know. But it was undamaged and there was
[32:50] no loss of life.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Not one person destroyed. I tell you
[32:54] what, friends, God's in control.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we believe that with all of
[33:00] our heart.
[33:02] uh sister uh Sephora Chimpac Chapeka and
[33:06] uh some of the family are have have gone
[33:09] to Chad to be with uh brother Jean
[33:12] Chimpaka and uh Sister Naomi and Mila
[33:16] are still here. Uh they're remaining
[33:19] here and I wonder if Sister Naomi and
[33:22] Mila are you in the service this
[33:23] morning? I could see you.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; All right. Would you stand up please for
[33:30] me?
[33:32] Oh, there's Sister Naomi right there.
[33:35] All right. Uh, any of you families that
[33:38] would like to invite them over and give
[33:40] them some fellowship and food,
[33:42] [laughter]
[33:43] I'm sure they'd be very happy. I just
[33:45] thought I'd make that as a public
[33:47] announcement. Uh, I I told her daddy in
[33:50] a I I told your daddy in an email,
[33:52] Sister Naomi, Sister Mila, that uh we
[33:55] would look after you. So, that's how
[33:57] we're doing it. Amen. and uh I'm sure
[34:00] they would love to have some fellowship.
[34:02] Also, I have a couple of great
[34:04] grandchildren here that just get here
[34:06] very rarely and this is the first time
[34:08] they've come together and that is Mea
[34:10] and Naomi Ardal from Atlanta, Georgia.
[34:14] And they're here visiting their cousins
[34:16] Ava and Isabelle and uh all the rest of
[34:20] them there and at over at Leah's place.
[34:23] I wonder I you know uh Mela sang for us
[34:28] once and it was uh it was just so
[34:31] lovely. Touched my heart. I wonder if
[34:33] Mea and Naomi could they come up and
[34:35] sing. Would that be possible? Oh, that
[34:37] would be great. And maybe some others
[34:39] are going to join them too. That would
[34:42] just be fine.
[34:45] Then we have a baptism in the service
[34:47] today after. And I I really love some of
[34:51] these names that uh some of our African
[34:54] sisters and brothers have. Uh I tell
[34:56] you, they use biblical names. And uh
[34:59] this name that's this sister that's
[35:01] being baptized is Sister Precious.
[35:04] Isn't that all right?
[35:06] &gt;&gt; You'll never forget that. And God bless
[35:08] Sister Precious as Brother Tom will be
[35:10] baptizing her. Sister Helen Bisberger
[35:13] had a bit of a mini stroke and uh but a
[35:17] heart attack. I think that you prayed
[35:18] for her this morning and uh brother Tom
[35:21] was up and prayed with her this morning
[35:22] at the hospital and she's doing real
[35:25] well. So we'd like we'd like to just
[35:27] keep you informed and so you can be uh
[35:30] right in the same channel in your
[35:31] prayer.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. How are you? Oh, that's wonderful.
[35:37] God bless you. How are you Naomi? My
[35:40] goodness. Well, here we are. God bless
[35:43] you.
[35:53] Thanks, brother Ryan.

[40:08] blood. I found [music and singing]
[40:10] pardon
[40:13] and my sins
[40:16] are [music and singing] washed.
[40:18] They're all
[40:22] my sins
[40:24] are. [music and singing]
[40:25] Let's stand as we sing once again.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; I'm [singing]
[40:35] [music]
[40:36] thank you. I
[40:40] believe
[40:42] you
[40:44] [music]
[40:45] through your preious
[40:49] I found [music and singing]
[40:53] and my sins
[40:56] are [singing]
[40:58] all washed away. [music] All [singing]
[41:01] my sins
[41:04] are washed
[41:06] away.
[41:08] [music]
[41:08] That's my Thank you. [applause]
[41:15] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[41:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning to the word in
[41:20] just a few moments. I I would like to
[41:23] say that uh uh the the camp which is
[41:27] beginning
[41:29] uh this tomorrow starting this week all
[41:32] week and next Sunday there's no service
[41:35] here in the morning.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; It's at the camp. No Sunday service
[41:40] morning service here next Sunday. It'll
[41:43] be at the camp and the junior camp is
[41:47] starting right after the service today.
[41:49] Some of the workers go down, but the
[41:51] registration is tomorrow. So, it'll be
[41:53] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday for the
[41:55] juniors. And Thursday begins the
[41:57] seniors. And Thursday, the camp is
[42:00] completely maxed out. It's the largest I
[42:02] think we've ever had. There's about 350
[42:05] will be on the camp, including some of
[42:07] the counselors, the counselors and so
[42:09] on. Uh but in the evening is the evening
[42:13] meetings and we want everybody there.
[42:16] Everybody is welcome from here and
[42:18] abroad. Uh brother Craig Bour, pastor of
[42:23] Bible believers of Lima, the church will
[42:26] be preaching. And uh we're impressed how
[42:30] he gives himself to God. And we we
[42:33] should come there with a lot of
[42:34] expectation. I'd like you to have a lot
[42:36] of expectation this morning
[42:38] &gt;&gt; that God will just prepare our hearts
[42:41] and do whatever he wishes to do. But
[42:43] that will be the senior camp and we're
[42:45] so happy to have our brother Brewer and
[42:48] uh I would like you to be praying for
[42:52] these meetings.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Uh
[42:55] uh I'm going to have you turn in the
[42:58] Bible please to Hebrews the 11th chapter
[43:01] and we'll begin to read. I would also
[43:04] like to say and give a special special
[43:07] welcome to all of our the group that is
[43:11] here from China and those that were
[43:13] unable to come across the border for
[43:15] this morning's service but they will be
[43:17] at the camp. So you'll get a chance to
[43:19] meet them at the camp. Uh and uh it's
[43:22] just wonderful what God has done. In
[43:24] fact is I I would like to say to this
[43:27] congregation to all that are streaming I
[43:30] do not believe I'm I can't help myself.
[43:33] I'm a visionary type of person, but I
[43:35] believe that God has has done uh great
[43:39] things in China,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; but I believe that is just the
[43:43] beginning.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; It is spreading to other countries and
[43:46] what brother Timothy Maul has done in
[43:48] Vietnam.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; We have brother John Lei here today and
[43:52] and his family and brother Joseph and
[43:55] James and their families. We're so
[43:58] thankful that you're here at this time
[44:00] to be a part. This is the first time
[44:02] we've had a whole company of people
[44:04] here, Brother John. I don't suppose when
[44:07] you were over there with your packs sack
[44:09] handing out books outside of some of the
[44:11] three self churches that you ever
[44:13] dreamed we'd be here with the whole
[44:15] group, did you? But I didn't dream about
[44:17] it, but here we are.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And God bless you each one. We're so
[44:22] happy that you are here. Amen. Amen. And
[44:26] there's another first that's happening
[44:28] this morning. Uh, brother Matthew Dertie
[44:30] has brought about seven
[44:34] uh, Egyptian of Egyptian descent or of
[44:37] Arabic background. They're in the
[44:40] service this morning and up in the room
[44:42] is the service is being translated into
[44:46] the Arabic language for those that are
[44:48] here and we want to welcome you.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; We have a multicultural church and we
[44:53] just say praise God.
[44:56] God God has raised up all these people
[44:58] from all these different nations and
[45:00] we're just happy to be one family. This
[45:03] way it's going to be around the marriage
[45:05] supper, friends.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be Canadian, American
[45:09] or British or whatever more. It's going
[45:12] to be around the world.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; That's going to be some of my service
[45:19] this today. We're going to read out of
[45:22] Hebrews 11 starting with verse 8.
[45:27] [clears throat] By faith Abraham when he
[45:30] was called to go out into a place which
[45:33] he should after receive for an
[45:36] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[45:40] knowing whether he went. [clears throat]
[45:42] I want to read that verse again and put
[45:44] every person in that verse
[45:47] &gt;&gt; because it is divided into uh sections
[45:52] that include all of us. Anyone who's
[45:55] come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[45:57] and the message
[45:58] &gt;&gt; by faith Abraham when he was called
[46:04] &gt;&gt; to go out into a place we have been
[46:07] called to a place
[46:09] &gt;&gt; which he should after receive for an
[46:11] inheritance.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; He obeyed
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and he went out not knowing whether he
[46:17] went.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; How many could say amen? That's been my
[46:20] testimony. Amen. By faith he sojourned
[46:24] in the land of promise as in a strange
[46:27] country. We're in a strange country.
[46:30] Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
[46:32] Jacob. We don't have Isaac and Jacob,
[46:34] but we have a lot of other folks here.
[46:37] And that's who you're dwelling with
[46:38] really dwelling with Isaac and Jacob and
[46:42] the heirs with him of the promise. And
[46:45] that's what we have here this morning is
[46:47] the heirs
[46:49] &gt;&gt; with the promise.
[46:52] For he looked for a city. We can say
[46:54] amen. Which hath foundations whose
[46:57] builder and maker is God. Through faith
[47:00] also Sarah herself received strength to
[47:03] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[47:06] child when she was past age because she
[47:09] judged him faithful who [clears throat]
[47:11] had promised. Therefore sprang there
[47:14] even of one, and him as as good as dead,
[47:18] as many as the stars of the sky in
[47:21] multitude, and as the sand which is by
[47:24] the seashore innumerable.
[47:26] These all died in faith,
[47:29] &gt;&gt; not having received the promises, but
[47:32] having seen them aar off, and were
[47:36] persuaded of them, and embraced them,
[47:40] and confessed that they were strangers
[47:42] and pilgrims on the earth.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] going to dwell on
[47:47] the first part of this verse. These all
[47:50] died in faith, not having received the
[47:54] promises, but having seen them
[47:57] &gt;&gt; aar off, and were persuaded of them,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; and embraced them, and confessed that
[48:04] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[48:08] earth.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; You can just look this way as I read
[48:12] this verse. It's just one verse out of
[48:14] Romans 4:20. He, speaking of Abraham
[48:17] again, staggered not at the promise of
[48:20] God
[48:21] through unbelief, but was strong in
[48:25] faith, giving glory to God. And one
[48:29] other scripture, Romans 12:3, for I say
[48:32] through the grace given unto me to even
[48:35] to every man that is among you, not to
[48:38] think of himself more highly than he
[48:41] ought to think, but to think soberly
[48:43] according as God hath dealt to every man
[48:47] the measure of faith. And God bless you.
[48:50] You may be seated.
[48:59] I'll need everybody's attention and just
[49:01] as little movement as possible
[49:06] so we don't distract others.
[49:11] This measure of faith is not that God
[49:15] has given you a certain measure of
[49:17] faith. The word measure is it is a an
[49:22] instrument of measuring and you are that
[49:25] instrument.
[49:28] Because God made a promise out here
[49:32] and has given you a measure of faith.
[49:38] You hear the word
[49:40] and then you are able to obtain the
[49:43] promise. I just want you to think of
[49:45] that. Now it is the measure of faith is
[49:49] not that a certain amount is given to
[49:52] every person but it is the ability for
[49:56] you to believe.
[49:58] You are a vessel. You are a vessel that
[50:01] God and you'll see this very very clear
[50:04] throughout the scripture as I speak to
[50:06] you. But it is they the Bible says that
[50:09] they saw they saw the promises
[50:14] a far off. They were instruments of God
[50:18] down through the scriptures and
[50:20] different ones could see. Job finally
[50:23] had vision and and can say, "I know my
[50:27] redeemer liveth and at the last day." He
[50:30] had long range vision.
[50:33] There were others. Moses said, "A
[50:35] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[50:37] like unto me." That was the measure that
[50:40] was given to him. He it wasn't just a
[50:43] certain measure, but he had the ability
[50:46] to see forward and to speak of that.
[50:51] Now, we have we happen to have promises.
[50:55] It's a very critical time that we live
[50:57] in. It's always been critical for
[51:00] believers,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; but it is absolutely essential that we
[51:05] are able to see the promise,
[51:08] &gt;&gt; to embrace the promise,
[51:11] and to confess the promise
[51:14] &gt;&gt; and to believe that that is the promise
[51:16] that was sent to us
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and a messenger came and sent us and
[51:21] gave us these words that we had not even
[51:24] uh seen or had them quickened to us as
[51:28] such. So it's it's a measurement. It's a
[51:31] vessel for receiving and determining the
[51:34] quantity of things or a rule of standard
[51:38] of judgment.
[51:40] It's a sphere of influence is given to
[51:42] you. The prophet said every person
[51:44] influences someone
[51:47] &gt;&gt; and one influences perhaps more than
[51:49] another. I believe that parents should
[51:52] influence their children.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; I believe that peers peers of the same
[51:58] age or the same group or the same
[52:00] whatever. Young men should influence
[52:04] &gt;&gt; young ladies should influence. Couples
[52:07] and homes should influence individuals
[52:10] just every believer should influence and
[52:13] does influence and that is a great
[52:16] responsibility upon us. Now there is a a
[52:21] quote I want to uh read carefully in why
[52:25] Christ speak so you'll listen
[52:27] respectfully.
[52:28] Faith sees what God wants done.
[52:37] This is in why Christ speak
[52:41] paragraph 161 faith sees what God wants
[52:45] done
[52:47] not just hears this is my words he does
[52:50] it's not just hears what he used to do
[52:55] we're not going to live in the past
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and say well this is what he did 40
[52:59] years ago
[53:00] &gt;&gt; this is what he did in brother
[53:01] Brandham's ministry this is what he did
[53:03] with the apostle Paul or Peter or the
[53:05] disciples, this is our time.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; This is our day.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; So faith sees what God wants done.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Not what he has done or what he will do,
[53:18] but what he's done, what he wants done
[53:20] now. Faith sees what God wants done at
[53:24] this camp.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants done today,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; in this service,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; with your life, at this time, in this
[53:33] season. Faith sees what God wants done.
[53:36] It says, "Oh, I hope this goes in."
[53:39] Faith doesn't look at the present time
[53:41] or the circumstances around. Faith's not
[53:44] looking at the circumstances.
[53:46] Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks
[53:49] to see what God wants and it works
[53:52] accordingly.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That's what faith does. It sees what God
[53:57] wants and what God wants done. And faith
[54:01] operates through that. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Faith is a long range vision.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; It don't lower its sights. It holds to
[54:13] the target.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Holds to the prize. I've said of the
[54:16] high calling in Christ Jesus. He said
[54:19] it's a telescope. It's it's a binocular
[54:22] &gt;&gt; that you don't look around here. You
[54:25] don't use binoculars to look to see what
[54:28] time it is.
[54:30] You don't need a pair of binoculars to
[54:32] look at your watch.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You don't use that. But you use
[54:38] binoculars to look a way off. And faith
[54:42] does that. Faith picks up God's
[54:44] binoculars.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to be talking a little
[54:47] bit about that. Uh I have I have some
[54:51] binoculars here.
[54:55] And uh these are good binoculars.
[54:58] I can tell you that these binoculars
[55:00] will see an animal off in the distance
[55:04] and uh it'll it'll see a tree stump
[55:11] that you see off just a tree stump, but
[55:14] then you pick up the binoculars and you
[55:16] find out it's a it's an animal. It's a
[55:20] moose. These make all the difference.
[55:24] Uh,
[55:25] let's see.
[55:31] I'm I'm going to have uh
[55:34] I'm going to have some help up here.
[55:41] See, why don't you come up?
[55:46] See where's it? Dave Jarrenoff. Dave,
[55:50] you've looked through lots of these. If
[55:53] you you'll come up and help me here with
[55:55] uh Now, I just want to see.
[55:59] Now, if you look at these the wrong way,
[56:03] you'll see things way down there that
[56:05] are actually right here.
[56:07] You've had that.
[56:12] They've had a look through those and
[56:14] just put them in the most blurred place.
[56:20] No, it's right here.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Just see it's all blurred.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[56:34] How you doing? Have you ever used one of
[56:36] these?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You have? Good. Well, you put them up.
[56:40] These these are super good ones. These
[56:43] are uh
[56:45] these are from Germany.
[56:47] There's his eyes. Is it very clear?
[56:52] &gt;&gt; What do you see?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Blurry.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Just blurry. He says just blurry. Well,
[57:00] here. Uh, f focus it up. Focus it way
[57:04] out there.
[57:10] Is it coming any better? What
[57:13] denomination do you belong to?
[57:27] Is it clear?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Well, well, just hold them up. You got
[57:29] to use them here. What time is it?
[57:35] See,
[57:37] doesn't know. They don't help him.
[57:40] He can't say what time it is. Prophet
[57:42] said it's not to say what time it is.
[57:45] You don't use them to look at your
[57:47] watch. You use them for another purpose.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; There's scripture here. There's
[57:52] scripture isn't, you know, it isn't just
[57:54] for the little things around. Well, I I
[57:57] you know, I I I got a pain. That's fine.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; There's promise for that.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm I don't have a job. Well, that's
[58:07] fine. That might be looking a little bit
[58:08] further. And there's promise for that.
[58:11] But then you start saying, "I'm a
[58:12] sinner.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; I feel convicted. I'm a sinner. I feel
[58:17] unclean. I don't feel, you know,
[58:20] somebody here that I see has got
[58:22] something I haven't got."
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Now you're seeing further.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And you start hearing about a heavenly
[58:28] home.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; You start hearing hear seeing about
[58:31] being born again.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I was born, but I GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; And then something starts TO STIR AND
[58:38] YOU'LL FIND OUT THERE'S A PROMISE. YOU
[58:40] MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU HAVE LONG ARRANGE FAITH THAT
[58:45] LOOKS TO THAT promise and then that
[58:48] happens.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; So I got another pair of binoculars but
[58:51] no use them.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; We made our point.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Dave.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; You'll just remember what we just did.
[59:07] And he says, "And faith does that."
[59:10] Faith picks up God's binoculars.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking by faith. Seeing the
[59:18] promises plural
[59:20] by faith, seeing the promises. If you
[59:24] actually see them for yourself
[59:27] personally,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; you'll embrace it.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; You'll take it to yourself.
[59:32] So I have quite a service here and I I
[59:34] want to make it across to you. He said
[59:38] both sides,
[59:41] the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Indeed, both sides.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; If you read the science of of
[59:49] binoculars, you'll find out that they're
[59:51] very very unique things because they
[59:54] they they actually put both eyes to
[59:58] work. Not not that you don't have it
[1:00:00] right now, but they work at it in a
[1:00:02] certain way so that both eyes get
[1:00:05] extended vision
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and it's just that's the way they're
[1:00:08] designed. So he says both eyes, he says
[1:00:11] both sides of New and Old Testament
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and sees every promise that he made
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and faith sees that out yonder. And
[1:00:22] faith chooses that regardless of what
[1:00:25] the present tense says. Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what things say around
[1:00:30] around about us, he looks at the end. He
[1:00:34] doesn't drop his sights down to look
[1:00:36] this way.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; He looks out yonder.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; He keeps the crosshairs dead center on
[1:00:41] the word.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's what faith does.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's the faith
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; that the man that's [clears throat] in a
[1:00:48] man that does those things.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, as something is blurred, it needs to
[1:00:54] be adjusted and made clear.
[1:00:57] Now, Malachi 1 said, now we're starting
[1:01:01] to get into the message, and I'm going
[1:01:03] to follow it through the scripture.
[1:01:05] Malachi 1 said, "Behold, I will send my
[1:01:09] messenger,
[1:01:10] and he shall prepare the way before me,
[1:01:13] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:01:15] suddenly come to his temple, even the
[1:01:18] messenger of the covenant whom you
[1:01:20] delight in. Behold, he shall come, says
[1:01:23] the Lord." And Israel had 400 years of
[1:01:27] quietness, no prophet between Malachi
[1:01:30] and Matthew. And the first one that
[1:01:32] breaks on the scene is John the Baptist
[1:01:36] and the spirit of Elijah.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And he begins to tell the people,
[1:01:40] there's one THERE'S ONE COMING
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; WHOSE SHOE LATCHED I'm not worthy to
[1:01:45] undo.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And this IS THIS WILL BE HIM.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; AND THE people they you know, they knew
[1:01:52] there was something different. So the
[1:01:53] multitudes were gathered to him and the
[1:01:56] and the scribes and the Pharisees AND
[1:01:58] ALL THE RELIGIOUS ORDER. It happened
[1:02:00] again happened in our time. But here
[1:02:03] they people gathered and they were
[1:02:05] ATTRACTED TO AND SOME OF THEM were even
[1:02:08] smitten in their hearts and he preached
[1:02:10] baptism and they came to him to be
[1:02:13] baptized. You read the Old Testament,
[1:02:15] there's nobody in the Old Testament
[1:02:16] baptized that I know of. They didn't
[1:02:18] gather to Moses or gather to Joshua or
[1:02:21] whatever more to be baptized like that.
[1:02:23] But here they come to be baptized and
[1:02:25] John is baptizing and and disciples come
[1:02:28] to him. But there were some that saw and
[1:02:33] they became disciples. They saw
[1:02:35] something.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; They perhaps could not have defined it
[1:02:39] exactly
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; but they saw something.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; They what they were seeing was the
[1:02:44] promise. Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; They saw I behold I send my messenger.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; They may not have even known the
[1:02:51] scripture, but there was something in
[1:02:53] them
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; calling them to him
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; TO BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH HIM and to
[1:02:59] follow him and and and then eventually
[1:03:03] in a perhaps a short period of time here
[1:03:06] he sees his cousin, which a lot of
[1:03:08] people thought was his cousin coming to
[1:03:11] him while he was in the water. AND HE
[1:03:15] SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF God that takes
[1:03:18] the sin, TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE
[1:03:20] WORLD. Behold the lamb of God."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And he was pointing the people to Jesus
[1:03:26] Christ.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; But the but the leaders,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; listen folks,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; the people who were raised in church,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; the people who read the Old Testament,
[1:03:35] which was the Bible, the people that
[1:03:38] read it, they actually came to John.
[1:03:40] THEY SENT SENT PEOPLE TO JOHN and said,
[1:03:43] "Who are you?"
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; They had a pair of blurred binoculars.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see who he was.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And there was it DIDN'T SEEM TO BE
[1:03:56] SOMETHING SUFFICIENT. IT WAS SUFFICIENT
[1:03:58] TO bring them to him, but it was not
[1:04:01] sufficient to give them vision of who he
[1:04:04] was.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; They needed it to be adjusted. And and
[1:04:07] and then if if Satan can get a HOLD OF
[1:04:10] THAT PERSON, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
[1:04:11] ATTRACTED TO IT,
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:04:14] TO THIS,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; HE doesn't want THEM TO GET WHAT IT IS
[1:04:18] THAT they have.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; So
[1:04:23] then he announced that Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] would come. I'm going to move quickly.
[1:04:27] THEN HERE WAS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:04:31] And to some their vision was HE'S BLEUB.
[1:04:37] HE'S THE PRINCE OF THE DEVILS. HE HE
[1:04:39] CASTS OUT EVIL SPIRITS BY THE PRINCE OF
[1:04:41] THE DEVILS. And there are others they
[1:04:44] could see something different and THEY
[1:04:47] SAID HE'S A good man. Others said HE'S A
[1:04:51] PROPHET FROM GALILEE.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; UH IT WAS COMPLIMENTARY BUT NOT
[1:04:58] SUFFICIENT.
[1:05:00] And I'm reading and OTHERS SAID HE
[1:05:02] DECEIVES the people.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And then Nicodemus said, "Rabbi,
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; you're a teacher."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "THOU ART A TEACHER that has
[1:05:17] come from God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; For no man can do THESE THINGS."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; THOU A TEACHER. SO THOU THE TEACHER,
[1:05:24] YOU'RE A PROPHET. HE'S A DECEIVER. HE'S
[1:05:28] A HE'S A PRINCE OF THE DEVILS.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; All of THOSE THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE
[1:05:36] THEY WERE LOOKING THEY WERE EVEN IN
[1:05:38] EXPECTATION FOR A SAVIOR.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; They believed IN A SAVIOR. THEY all
[1:05:43] believed in a savior.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; They all believed they all knew that
[1:05:47] someone had to come,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; but it didn't it that's what their
[1:05:51] vision didn't extend to that degree. And
[1:05:54] then there was there was another one
[1:05:58] AND JESUS SAID, "WHO DO YOU SAY I AM?"
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And he MADE A DECLARATION THAT HAD NEVER
[1:06:04] BEEN WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE CHRIST, THE SON
[1:06:08] OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; HE GOT THESE IN. HE GOT THEM IN FOCUS.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Both sides in focus.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE CHRIST,
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HE SAW HIM RIGHT THERE IN THE
[1:06:23] PRESENT
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS FOCUSED IN WAY DOWN
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN THE ROAD. He could see that HE
[1:06:29] WAS THE SON OF GOD.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAW.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; AND THEN NOW WE HAVE A PROPHET IN THIS
[1:06:35] DAY. I getting way ahead of myself, I
[1:06:37] suppose. BUT WE HAVE A PROPHET AND HE
[1:06:39] SAID HE'S WANTING TO TELL THE PEOPLE TO
[1:06:42] TELL YOU AND I
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS ANOINTING LIKE? SAID,
[1:06:45] "WELL, let me draw a LITTLE DRAMA." AND
[1:06:47] AND AND THERE'S A LITTLE HALO OF LIGHT.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM. He's too
[1:06:53] great.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; HE'S TOO MYSTICAL. YOU CAN'T WE TALK
[1:06:57] ABOUT GOD FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE. GOD
[1:07:00] WHO, AS I SPOKE TO MY WIFE ON THE WAY
[1:07:02] HERE, GOD WHO CREATED EVERY BUG. GOD WHO
[1:07:05] created every animal and the character
[1:07:07] of different animals AND THE CHARACTER
[1:07:09] OF animals within the same specy. You'll
[1:07:12] find horses one way and other animals uh
[1:07:16] another way. BUT YOU'LL FIND EVEN
[1:07:18] AMONGST THE horses or amongst dogs or
[1:07:20] cats, they have their own individual
[1:07:22] character. AND AND GOD HAD TO BE all of
[1:07:25] that.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; EVEN AMONGST THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, GOD HAD
[1:07:29] to be all of that. And then here's
[1:07:31] Darwin.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Poor soul.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Poor soul.
[1:07:38] Think of ALL OF THESE FLOWERS and all OF
[1:07:40] THESE COLORS AND ALL OF THE DIVERSITY
[1:07:43] and and and HERE WE ARE AS HUMANS JUST
[1:07:46] AS DIFFERENT AS NIGHT IS FROM DAY AND
[1:07:49] THE MULTI- MULTIHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
[1:07:52] OF OF of skin that size and everyone has
[1:07:56] ever been different.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF A GOD IS THAT? WHAT KIND OF
[1:08:00] A BEING IS THAT? YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
[1:08:02] GOD NEVER.
[1:08:05] IT'LL TAKE ETERNITY TO
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; TO discover him and to know what he is.
[1:08:09] AND HERE COMES A PROPHET SAYS NOW THAT
[1:08:12] now to give a drama we can't understand
[1:08:15] that God like that. BUT OUT FROM OUT
[1:08:18] FROM HIM APPEARS a a little a light.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And that light is out of the bosom of
[1:08:24] the father.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; And we'll call it the logos, the word.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE CREATIVE POWER
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; coming out of God.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and through that power, he's
[1:08:35] going to create
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; ALL MANNER OF THINGS.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE LIGHT.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Hold that one.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm going to surprise you a little
[1:08:47] later on.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; So, he was all of these things, but
[1:08:50] Peter with the binoculars of Revelation.
[1:08:53] It's a good brand.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Revelation's a good make.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; It's a lot better than Ze. Yeah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Better than Schwartzki or whoever he is.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Better than Monulta and all of these
[1:09:08] others.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; When you have you have eyesight
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; of the revelation
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; He said you'll never you'll never
[1:09:19] overstate revelation.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; G
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; and by that he could say thou art the
[1:09:24] Christ, the son of the living God.
[1:09:28] He said in the me message presuming
[1:09:32] we also have preachers of denominations
[1:09:35] great denominations across the nation
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; and these ministers preach the doctrine
[1:09:41] of their denomination.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Of course they do.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Presuming that they are doing exactly
[1:09:48] what's right.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Presuming
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; that they're doing exactly what's right.
[1:09:54] Many of them, no matter how contrary to
[1:09:56] the scripture it is, they presume
[1:09:58] they're doing right when they preach
[1:10:00] that doctrine,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Let it be whatever it may be.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; They presume that that's just what God
[1:10:09] requires.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; A certain creed or a certain
[1:10:12] affiliation. They think that's just all
[1:10:16] that God requires. They presume that
[1:10:18] they're taking the people to heaven.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You know, IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I'VE
[1:10:23] BEEN TO A LOT of funerals. I've
[1:10:25] conducted a lot of funerals
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; and I've been to a lot of funerals
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; and I know the person who's in the
[1:10:31] casket
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; and I KNOW HOW THAT PERSON LIVED
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH GOD.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH SALVATION.
[1:10:39] THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH JESUS
[1:10:41] CHRIST.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH CALVARY.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; AND SOMEHOW THE MAN BEHIND THE PULL PIT
[1:10:47] MANAGES TO PUT HIM IN HEAVEN. WHAT'S HE
[1:10:49] WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN FOR? HE NEVER
[1:10:51] WANTED HEAVEN down here. He never wanted
[1:10:54] God's people down here. AND I'VE NEVER
[1:10:57] YET NEVER YET HEARD anybody
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; put anyone into hell.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus did.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; JESUS TOLD THE ACCOUNT.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:11:11] AND FURTHERMORE, THIS BIBLE, WHEN I LOOK
[1:11:13] THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, THIS BIBLE
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; TELLS me that more deceived,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; THAN THOSE THAT HAVE REVELATION OF JESUS
[1:11:21] CHRIST,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; more people are opposed TO THE GOSPEL OF
[1:11:26] JESUS CHRIST,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; according to this word. And the Bible
[1:11:30] says there'll be weeping and wailing and
[1:11:34] nashing of teeth
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; FOR WHATEVER IS COMING UPON THE EARTH.
[1:11:39] FRIENDS, LISTEN TO THIS MESSENGER.
[1:11:42] LISTEN TO MY VOICE TODAY. You do not
[1:11:44] want to be there.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I do not want to be there.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, whatever it takes.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; LET ME SEE THE PROMISE. REPENT
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED.
[1:11:59] EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:12:02] CHRIST,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A PROMISE.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH VISION TO SEE THAT
[1:12:07] PROMISE?
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, FATHER, SON, HOLY GHOST.
[1:12:14] FATHER, SON, HOLY GHOST." THAT'S THAT'S
[1:12:17] IN THE BIBLE, BUT YOU NEED TO ADJUST THE
[1:12:19] YOU NEED TO ADJUST IT AND AND get over
[1:12:22] into the book OF ACTS WHERE THEY WERE
[1:12:24] FULFILLING THAT SCRIPTURE AND BAPTIZED
[1:12:26] EVERYONE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ADJUST IT SO IT BECOMES VERY
[1:12:34] CLEAR
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT BECOMES CLEAR. EMBRACE IT.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; CONFESS IT.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; AND DO IT.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; HE WENT OUT INTO A COUNTRY HE DIDN'T
[1:12:49] KNOW, BUT HE believed it.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:59] Friends, you might as well say amen. I
[1:13:00] just started preaching.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; They didn't get focused
[1:13:10] even by seeing the resurrected Christ.
[1:13:13] Listen to this.
[1:13:16] Even by seeing the resurrected Christ.
[1:13:21] For the scripture says, "And behold, I
[1:13:24] send the promise of my father upon you."
[1:13:26] That was one tar in Jerusalem
[1:13:30] until he be endued with power from on
[1:13:32] high.
[1:13:34] Behold, I send the promise
[1:13:37] of the father.
[1:13:39] They couldn't see the promise.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW HIM AFTER HE WAS RESURRECTED.
[1:13:44] THEY SAW MANY INFALLIBLE WORKS. THEY SAW
[1:13:47] HEALINGS. WHERE'S ALL THE PEOPLE THAT
[1:13:49] HEARD William Brandon?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some testimony
[1:13:53] here in just a few moments. Where's all
[1:13:55] these people?
[1:13:57] WHERE ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE? IT'S ALL A
[1:13:59] INCREDIBLE INFALLIBLE WORK.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; That vision doesn't give you the full
[1:14:06] the fullness of the gospel.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; AND SO THESE PEOPLE HEARD THIS, "BEHOLD,
[1:14:11] I send you the promise of the father. Go
[1:14:14] and tar in Jerusalem until you be
[1:14:16] endured with power from on high." A MAN
[1:14:19] RAISED FROM THE DEAD.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; The resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And in this day and age,
[1:14:27] hundreds of times, a prophet of God
[1:14:29] said, "THIS IS THE SIGN OF THE
[1:14:31] RESURRECTION OR THIS IS THE PROOF OF THE
[1:14:34] RESURRECTION AGAIN."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; WHY? UPON THIS GENERATION, UPON THIS
[1:14:39] AGE, AND UPON US HERE, WE HAVE RECEIVED
[1:14:43] THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SOME DOCTRINES, NOT JUST
[1:14:48] SOMETHING DIFFERENT, NOT JUST SOMETHING
[1:14:50] DIFFERENT. CHURCHES, THE SIGN OF THE
[1:14:52] RESURRECTION.
[1:14:56] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You've seen it, friends.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD IT. THE SIGN OF THE
[1:15:03] RESURRECTION DIDN'T COME just to give us
[1:15:05] some different churches.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; The sign of the resurrection never come
[1:15:10] just to give us some fellowship of a
[1:15:12] different at a DIFFERENT LEVEL.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION CAME TO
[1:15:16] UNVEIL JESUS CHRIST IN THIS WORD.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:15:27] Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And then there was another and and being
[1:15:30] assembled together with them commanded
[1:15:32] them that they should not depart from
[1:15:34] Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of
[1:15:36] the father.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But others had things to do.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; They had families. They had friends or
[1:15:42] whatever more. They had jobs or whatever
[1:15:45] more. But this was the most important
[1:15:47] thing.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; But wait for the promise. The promise.
[1:15:53] The promise. THEY SAW THE PROMISE AS A
[1:15:56] FAR OFF.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Looking for THE PROMISE. NOW HE'S
[1:16:00] TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER PROMISE. I I'LL
[1:16:02] SEND YOU SOMETHING. I'LL SEND YOU THE
[1:16:04] PROMISE OF THE FATHER. And they're
[1:16:06] trying to adjust it and couldn't quite
[1:16:07] see it. And the Bible says 500
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; ABOVE 500
[1:16:13] brethren perhaps more than we have or
[1:16:16] something like we have here this
[1:16:17] morning. 500 brethren.
[1:16:21] heard and saw the infallible works. 120
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; got to the upper room. 120.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, YOU PEOPLE. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:16:30] THAT DO ARITHMETIC. 120. WHERE DID 380
[1:16:34] go?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; 320
[1:16:40] had a had a set of binoculars, the Old
[1:16:42] Testament, the New. And they they uh
[1:16:45] they apprehended and embraced that
[1:16:48] promise and ended up in the upper room.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; What are we doing?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Peter, DO YOU HAVE ANY
[1:16:54] IDEA? NO. I I don't know. Brother
[1:16:57] Brandham even says maybe they got a good
[1:16:59] feeling. Said I think this is it.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; it's not it. Not yet.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Waited 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 9 days,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; 10 days. THEN AFTER THEY'VE BEEN THERE
[1:17:13] 10 DAYS, THEY'RE KIND OF SOUND
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; FROM HEAVEN
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; LIKE A MIGHTY RUSHING WIND,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; nothing they did.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; AND THERE APPEARED CLOVEN TONGUES,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; PILLARS OF FIRE ON EACH OF THEM.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; God breaking himself up.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD COMING INTO THE PEOPLE.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE PROMISE. AMEN.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; THE OTHER 380 DIDN'T GET IT.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T FIND THEMSELVES THERE
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR VISION WAS CLEAR. WASN'T
[1:17:48] CLEAR.
[1:17:50] 120. You can't you It just CAN'T YOU
[1:17:53] CAN'T MAKE THAT KIND OF ARITHMETIC MAKE
[1:17:55] ANY SENSE. But friends, I want to be one
[1:17:58] of the 120, don't you?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever it costs.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE ONE of them. Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And you want TO SAY TO YOURSELF THIS
[1:18:10] MORNING,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; BY GOD'S GRACE,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I SHALL BE one of them.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And the third promise, and therefore
[1:18:22] being at the right hand of God, exalted,
[1:18:25] and having received of the father the
[1:18:27] promise of the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; he hath shed forth this that you now see
[1:18:32] and hear. That's what John is saying. or
[1:18:36] brother Peter is saying when they SAID
[1:18:38] THESE MEN ARE DRUNK, I tell you what,
[1:18:41] their binoculars were way out of whack.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; They all came there for a GREAT FEAST,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; A GREAT CONVENTION,
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; A GREAT CAMP MEETING,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAW ALL THESE THINGS GOING ON.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; THESE PEOPLE SO FULL OF GOD, THEY
[1:18:57] COULDN'T WALK STRAIGHT. THEY STAGGERED
[1:18:59] AROUND. THEY'RE SO FULL OF GOD AND WHAT
[1:19:02] THEY HAD EXPERIENCED. I TELL YOU WHAT,
[1:19:04] THEY WEREN'T AFRAID OF WHAT THE PEOPLE
[1:19:06] THOUGHT of them.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; We sit HERE NICE AND STILL AND STEADY.
[1:19:14] THAT'S FINE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
[1:19:16] FRIENDS, THOSE PEOPLE GOT FULL SO FULL
[1:19:18] OF GOD. NOT FULL OF EMOTION, FULL OF
[1:19:20] GOD.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD SPOKE OUT THROUGH PETER'S
[1:19:25] MOUTH TO THE whole multitude until they
[1:19:28] were pricked in their hearts. AND THE
[1:19:29] PEOPLE SAID, "WHAT SHALL WE DO? AMEN.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's what God plan was. WHAT SHALL WE
[1:19:37] DO?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; REPENT.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; AND DEP. HE'S CHECKING ON THEIR VISION
[1:19:42] NOW.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHERE REPENTANCE COME?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; REPENT.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to it in a few minutes.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; AND ALL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. You
[1:19:56] think of the book OF ACTS AND ALL OF
[1:19:58] THESE THINGS THAT HAPPENED. YOU'D THINK
[1:20:00] THAT THAT WOULD MOVE ANYBODY. Listen
[1:20:02] friends, that the Satan you're working
[1:20:05] through the flesh could give all kinds
[1:20:07] of substitutes.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE A SUBSTITUTE.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "WELL, I FEEL GOOD." HAS
[1:20:16] NOTHING TO DO WITH FEELINGS.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; FEELINGS VERSUS FAITH. I WAS GOING TO
[1:20:21] CALL this service.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And one THING I SEE A GREAT NEED in the
[1:20:24] MESSAGE IS FOR FAITH. AMEN.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Aside from feelings.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I kind OF FEEL LESS. FORGET IT.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible produces, as the prophet
[1:20:44] spoke, rugged
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; men and women.
[1:20:48] The gospel doesn't produce a bunch of
[1:20:50] well I don't feel like going or I don't
[1:20:52] feel like this or I don't feel like be
[1:20:54] being a part of that or I don't feel YOU
[1:20:57] BETTER FIND YOU BETTER GET THE
[1:20:58] BINOCULARS up and SEE WHAT THE WORD OF
[1:21:00] GOD SAYS
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL you one thing the prophet
[1:21:03] said when the doors open to the house of
[1:21:05] God you should be there should be
[1:21:08] waiting AT THE DOOR WAITING TO COME IN
[1:21:10] SIT DOWN prayerfully and get your heart
[1:21:13] PREPARED SAY GOD I know you're going to
[1:21:15] HAVE A MAN OF GOD BEHIND ON the pullpit.
[1:21:18] I have prayed for that AND I'M WAITING
[1:21:20] TO HEAR SOMETHING. YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK
[1:21:23] TO ME
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAS SAID I'M A SON OF
[1:21:27] GOD.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; I'M A DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GUIDE ME.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE HAVE TO HAVE IT.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; We must HAVE IT
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; AT ALL COST. WE MUST HAVE THAT.
[1:21:52] And then
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4:5 and 6. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU
[1:21:56] ELIJAH THE PROPHET. It's a promise.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I WILL SEND YOU. BEHOLD, I'll send you.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Not not Malachi 3, that's John the
[1:22:05] Baptist.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Now, another appearing of the spirit of
[1:22:08] Elijah. I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:22:10] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:22:14] Lord. First coming was as great. Second
[1:22:16] coming is dreadful.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; First coming is in salvation,
[1:22:19] redemption. Second coming is in
[1:22:21] judgment.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Before the great and terrible day of the
[1:22:27] Lord. And when the angel out of God's
[1:22:29] PRESENCE CAME DOWN AND spoke to
[1:22:31] Zachchariah, John the Baptist's father,
[1:22:34] told him that he would turn the hearts
[1:22:36] of the fathers to the children and broke
[1:22:39] the scripture in half because it wasn't
[1:22:41] the other half.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the day of vengeance as Isaiah
[1:22:47] spoke of the same time.
[1:22:50] And so,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; but as it was before Pentecost,
[1:22:55] many didn't have a vision,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; didn't see that. They didn't see the
[1:23:02] promise of Malachi 4, but they were
[1:23:05] attracted. I was, my parents were.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; We're attracted along with a few other
[1:23:10] thousands of people.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; I was in Vernon. I was in Tacoma. I was
[1:23:16] in uh down in Salem, down in Port Al
[1:23:19] Bernie, DOWN IN VICTORIA IN ABOUT 30
[1:23:23] MEETINGS, 30 different meetings. I never
[1:23:25] saw I didn't have the binoculars, God's
[1:23:28] binoculars,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; TO SEE WHO MALACHI 4 WAS.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Till I sat down one day.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And now a mouth
[1:23:40] speaks the same scripture which I've
[1:23:42] read many times.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:44] But it come from a different source.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It was like he was handing me a pair of
[1:23:48] binoculars
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; here. Look at this.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And I'll TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, I
[1:23:54] DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ADJUST IT VERY MUCH.
[1:23:56] IT BECAME AS CLEAR AS COULD BE.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; HIS FIRST COMING,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; HIS SECOND COMING.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; HERE IT IS IN LUKE'S GOSPEL. DOT IT UP
[1:24:07] AND ADJUSTED IT. OH, MY FRIENDS, IT'S
[1:24:10] NOTHING'S BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.
[1:24:13] AMEN.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU SEE THE PROMISE,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU SEE THE PROMISE,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; everything else is all blurred out
[1:24:22] there.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST SEE THE PROMISE FOR YOUR DAY,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; NOT BACK IN SOME DENOMINATIONAL TIME OR
[1:24:33] THE TIME OF LUTHER. LUTHER ADJUSTED IT
[1:24:36] AND HE SAW THE FAITH the the just shall
[1:24:38] live by faith.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And that was the whole foundation. THAT
[1:24:42] WAS HIS WHOLE MESSAGE,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And people were attracted to it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; But now WE HAVE, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU
[1:24:49] ELIJAH THE PROPHET,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; and he shall turn the hearts of the the
[1:24:53] the fathers to the children and the
[1:24:56] children to the fathers."
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; On top OF THAT, GOD SENT SPECIAL gifts
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; to try to get the people to adjust.
[1:25:05] Hello, folks.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; to adjust their binoculars.
[1:25:11] sent them special gifts.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Listen to this one.
[1:25:17] Consider the accuracy.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Consider the accuracy of this ministry.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And yet they could put it in every cult
[1:25:28] book
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; or false book.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And those scoundrels
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; are too cowardly
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; to put in their book what I'm going to
[1:25:39] read for you right now.
[1:25:42] Come on.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, THE PERSON SHOULDN'T USE
[1:25:44] THAT LANGUAGE." I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, GOD
[1:25:46] uses stronger language.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; If they TELL YOU SOMETHING AND IT'S ONLY
[1:25:55] A PARTIAL truth
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of misleading you, God
[1:26:00] calls it a lie.
[1:26:09] How do you like one service like this?
[1:26:11] And I've gone to a lot of work to
[1:26:13] abbreviate it for you. One service and
[1:26:16] your name is Mrs. Ralph Kepler.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; It was a meeting in Owensburg,
[1:26:22] Kentucky. Owensboro.
[1:26:25] To another one, your name is Oanyan.
[1:26:28] They call you Howard, don't they?
[1:26:31] Brother Howard from Owensboro.
[1:26:35] And your name is CB Dwit.
[1:26:38] Is that right? Go home and be made well.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That was in Phoenix.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Your name is Julia Major. That was in
[1:26:47] Phoenix.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Your name is Michael. They call you
[1:26:52] Mike,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; don't they?
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And your last name's Jordan.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And you don't live and
[1:27:00] you don't live about don't and don't you
[1:27:03] live about 718 Garfield Street?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Don't you live
[1:27:09] about
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; 718
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Garfield Street?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Where do YOU LIVE? HE KNOWS YOUR NUMBER.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS YOUR NAME. HE KNOWS HOW TO
[1:27:19] SPELL IT.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE THE ABBREVIATED name they
[1:27:23] use to call you.
[1:27:28] Is he WORTHY
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR FAITH WHEN HE MAKES A PROMISE?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, IS HE WORTHY OF YOUR
[1:27:38] FAITH?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; SAY, THIS ONE doesn't lie.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; This one tells the truth.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; THIS ONE KNOWS RIGHT WHERE I AM.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; This one knows my spiritual need.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; He knows every part of it. Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; AND FURTHERMORE, FRIENDS, IT'S NOT
[1:27:57] enough that he knows it, but you must
[1:27:59] know he has GIVEN YOU AND IS SENDING YOU
[1:28:02] MINISTRY.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He is sending you preaching.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He's sending you anointed word.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; He's sending YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT BY
[1:28:10] DIVINE REVELATION TO REVEAL JESUS CHRIST
[1:28:13] AND HIS PLAN TO YOU FOR THIS TIME FOR
[1:28:16] YOUR LIFE.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Say amen for me.
[1:28:27] Don't you live about at 718
[1:28:30] Garfield Street?
[1:28:35] You come up the river from Cincinnati.
[1:28:37] This is number six. You come up the
[1:28:40] river from Cincinnati, Ohio. Your name
[1:28:43] is Berg House. RP is your initial.
[1:28:47] Return home and be well. Say that's just
[1:28:51] to TICKLE OUR EARS. DON'T YOU FOOL
[1:28:53] YOURSELF.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A PROMISE OF GOD.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD'S PROMISE TO FULFILL MALACHI
[1:29:00] 4
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; TO FULFILL LUKE 17:30.
[1:29:03] THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE church
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; that John saw in Revelation 3:14
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; AND TO THE AND TO THE messenger
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; to the messenger
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; of Leodysia, right?
[1:29:19] these things.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; The amen's the beginning and the end.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; TELL THEM, THUS SAITH THE BEGINNING OF
[1:29:28] THE NEW CREATION OF GOD. I'M ANOTHER
[1:29:30] SPECIES.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; I'M ANOTHER SUPER SEED. I'M ANOTHER
[1:29:34] CREATION. LISTEN TO ME, FRIEND. IF YOU
[1:29:37] DON'T HEAR THIS, YOU'LL DIE LIKE A DOG.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You'll just go where other multitudes
[1:29:43] have gone.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; You must believe.
[1:29:49] Hallelujah.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; You have to answer to this.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; God sent this to you.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I'm simply repeating what did happen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; THIS DID HAPPEN.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TH THAT'S SAYAITH THE LORD.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; IT DID HAPPEN. AND THIS GENERATION HAS
[1:30:12] TO answer to that.
[1:30:15] Yes, sir.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Right, brother.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Your name's Eva
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; and your last name is York
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and you live in this city.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And your HOUSE NUMBER IS 6136TH STREET,
[1:30:31] Washington DC.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Your name's Mrs. Bayer. Like Bayer
[1:30:36] Aspirin.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Like Bayer Aspirin.
[1:30:41] And that's right. You're healed. She was
[1:30:44] in Los Angeles and that was in 1965.
[1:30:47] 1965 when the great uh theologians were
[1:30:51] saying he's gone off in the
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; end
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; because they didn't their doctrine. They
[1:30:59] were spending their time assuming
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; that they're sending PEOPLE TO HEAVEN,
[1:31:04] ASSUMING PEOPLE ARE getting repentance
[1:31:07] and GETTING SALVATION, ASSUMING THAT
[1:31:09] THEIR DOCTRINE WAS RIGHT. And none of
[1:31:12] them ever did this. I say
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; if YOU'RE GOING TO BUCKER, DO THIS.
[1:31:17] [applause]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; This a lesson to this congregation.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; You hear or say and God help you so you
[1:31:26] don't give your ears to hear this junk
[1:31:28] and nonsense.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; But when you do, and then I tell people,
[1:31:32] AND YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM OTHER MINISTERS
[1:31:33] HERE, Brother Tom, Brother John, Brother
[1:31:35] Tim, these brethren, and and there all
[1:31:38] this community stuff on on Facebook,
[1:31:41] etc. I got an answer for you.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; God's going to shut it down.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really?"
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's going to shut it down.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Then you hear these people all the
[1:31:54] skeptics and all this about God and they
[1:31:57] don't believe in God or they don't
[1:31:58] believe in this message or whatever
[1:32:00] more. Just tell them do this
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T COME BACK TO ME TILL YOU'VE
[1:32:05] DONE THIS.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You bring me your leader that does this.
[1:32:09] You bring me the man THAT YOU FOLLOW AND
[1:32:11] DO THIS.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL YOU DO THIS, STAY AWAY.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU DO THIS, YOU HAVE NOTHING
[1:32:18] VALID to say.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Will you do it? Young people,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; young ladies, WILL YOU DO IT?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; MEN, will you do it?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Remember your commission now. Remember
[1:32:32] your confession.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE PROMISE.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T SEE ALL THIS GARBAGE. WHAT DO WE
[1:32:38] SAY? OH, WELL, THERE'S A GARBAGE DUMP
[1:32:40] OUT THERE. YEAH, WELL, why don't you all
[1:32:42] go and see it? It's it's a great big
[1:32:44] garbage dump. Vancouver has a big
[1:32:45] garbage dump.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, there isn't anything in
[1:32:48] the garbage for me." That's exactly
[1:32:50] right.
[1:32:52] [applause]
[1:32:52] [cheering]
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; These skeptics haven't got anything for
[1:32:55] me. These guys with all this criticism
[1:32:57] of the women OR WHATEVER MORE, THEY
[1:32:59] HAVEN'T GOT A THING.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T GOT A STUMP TO STAND ON.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm not even asking you to forgive
[1:33:08] me. I'm not going to apologize for what
[1:33:09] I'm saying.
[1:33:13] [applause]
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Your name is Mrs. Wolf. That's number
[1:33:17] nine.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; In Topeka, Kansas in 1964.
[1:33:22] You're a reverend. It's number 10.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I just give you 10.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I could have given you some hundreds,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm just giving you 10.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You're a reverend.
[1:33:35] You're a minister.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I see you at the pulpit.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You do?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I see you AT THE PULPIT. WHO IS THIS
[1:33:45] PERSON?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Who is this man? You think William
[1:33:48] Brandham saw HIM AT THE PULPIT? NO. THE
[1:33:50] GOD THAT WAS SPEAKING THROUGH HIM was
[1:33:52] giving him sight beyond his mind. Has
[1:33:56] nothing to do with the human mind. I SEE
[1:33:58] YOU AT THE PULPIT.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:34:01] And then he said something and the man
[1:34:04] says, "Uh-huh.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Believe with all your heart and God
[1:34:08] bless you." And the man spoke up and
[1:34:10] said, "That's 22 years ago
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; that he stood behind the pulpit."
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And here's a prophet standing in THAT
[1:34:17] MOMENT SAYING, "I SEE YOU BEHIND THE
[1:34:19] PULLPIT.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS HE IN ETERNITY IN ANOTHER
[1:34:23] DIMENSION?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Bring me another man. BRING ME YOUR
[1:34:27] PRIEST. Bring me your rabbi. bring me
[1:34:30] anybody and have him do this.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't do that, SAY, "WELL,
[1:34:34] THERE'S OTHER PROPHETS." BRING THEM
[1:34:36] HERE.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And if they DON'T DO THIS, YOU'RE
[1:34:40] OBLIGATED TO HEAR SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS
[1:34:42] TRUTH.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; All this was done. Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And I thought of your message, brother
[1:34:59] Don. Brother John,
[1:35:02] when you turn, he didn't know. He was I
[1:35:04] was already deep in my message.
[1:35:08] And brother John goes to Malachi 4. He
[1:35:11] says to turn to cultivate is to dig
[1:35:14] deep.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And I thought, that's right.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; and he'll dig deep. Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; He'll turn your heart.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T CARE WHERE YOUR HEART IS.
[1:35:30] HE'LL TURN YOUR HEART.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; HE'LL TURN YOUR HEART.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Which the SCRIPTURE ALSO SAYS IS WICKED.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; THE HEART IS WICKED.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL SEND A WORD
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; AND A PROMISE THAT WILL TAKE THAT WICKED
[1:35:43] HEART
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; AND TURN IT.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; THE HEART THAT IS STEEPED IN PRIDE AND
[1:35:50] TURN IT TILL YOU BEND the knee.
[1:35:52] [cheering]
[1:35:55] SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; JESUS, FORGIVE ME.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Turning my heart.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; I ALWAYS FELT I WAS RIGHT.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Listen to some OTHER MAN THAT HASN'T GOT
[1:36:13] ANY VINDICATION WHATSOEVER." And here
[1:36:16] you bring THIS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY
[1:36:18] FACE. YEAH.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY TO ALL THAT ARE streaming
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; and all that are in this building or
[1:36:23] under the sound of my voice or will ever
[1:36:24] hear this voice,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; let it be known to you.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; God arranged you to be here.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; God arranged for you to hear these
[1:36:33] words.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; In a message why I'm a holy roller,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; brother Bam talks about a man Joel.
[1:36:47] He's speaking 53. And he said, Joel, God
[1:36:51] put a binocular on his eyes
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; one day and he looked DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:36:56] STREAM OF TIME
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; YONDER. HE SAW the church.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; He seen this vine tore down.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; He saw it destroyed.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What the palmer worm left,
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; the caterpillar is eaten. And what the
[1:37:15] caterpillar has left, the locust has
[1:37:17] eaten.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And what lot what the locust at eat
[1:37:20] another worm has eaten.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Could this church ever grow
[1:37:24] again?"
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; But God said,
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; "I WILL RESTORE, SAYETH the Lord."
[1:37:35] And Joel had enough had enough of God in
[1:37:39] him as A PROPHET TO EMBRACE that promise
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and said, "I BELIEVE THAT PROMISE."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; God will restore.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; I will restore, says the Lord.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we need to believe that
[1:37:55] even now
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; we're in that restoration. A lot of
[1:37:59] people have taken the restoration and
[1:38:00] this redemption and what the messenger
[1:38:02] said and just made it into a like a
[1:38:05] little gathering.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; This is not here so you can just come
[1:38:08] and have a comfortable afternoon.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Or say, "Well, I've been to church THIS
[1:38:12] MORNING." THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. That
[1:38:14] doesn't mean ANYTHING TO GOD. WHAT KIND
[1:38:16] OF LIFE DO WE LIVE
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; after you've left church?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] All this was done to turn the heart. And
[1:38:31] he says, uh,
[1:38:33] I will restore, say the Lord. And Joel
[1:38:35] the prophet, he said, looking down
[1:38:37] through the eyes of faith.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm preaching to you
[1:38:42] today. Don't look through these eyes
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; or hear what these ears hear.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; God's not depending on that. And that's
[1:38:50] not what he's using.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Eyes of faith. Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And looking down through
[1:38:56] the eyes of faith, he saw the vine
[1:38:59] coming up out of Genesis."
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; He saw it all as far away they he said
[1:39:06] there after the Jerusalem, thereafter
[1:39:09] Jerusalem, the Holy Ghost fell.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; He seen the dark ages coming on. He seen
[1:39:15] the vine destroyed
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; and pushed down to a stump. And but God
[1:39:21] said, "I will restore, say the Lord."
[1:39:24] When you look through the eyes of faith,
[1:39:26] it doesn't mean whether you see a see
[1:39:28] the vine coming up strong and fruitful
[1:39:32] or whether you see it being destroyed,
[1:39:34] CUT DOWN, PUSHED INTO A STUMP AND THE
[1:39:37] LIFE GOES BACK DOWN. BEING A PROPHET, he
[1:39:40] knew that the word of God,
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; the word of God is creative
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; and the life goes back down to the roots
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; where no one can find it. Right.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why it says of Jesus Christ
[1:39:51] that he's both the he's both the branch
[1:39:54] and the root of Jesse.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; They couldn't destroy him. They tried to
[1:40:00] put him into a coupe
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; called a sephilar.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; AND THEY PUT HIM THERE dead and
[1:40:05] lifeless,
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE ROOT.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; THEY MIGHT DESTROY THIS BODY. THEY MIGHT
[1:40:17] BURY YOU IN THE GRAVE, BUT THEY CAN'T
[1:40:20] GET TO THE ROOT.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITH. WHAT YOUR FAITH IS ANCHORED
[1:40:25] IN.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T GET AT YOUR FAITH.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "If it wasn't for that,
[1:40:42] you might be able to kill the branches,
[1:40:43] but the life is in the church." Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Which is in Jesus, which is Jesus
[1:40:48] Christ, the lamb slain from the
[1:40:50] foundation of the earth,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; God will restore
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; back to the word Christ.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; For the purpose of hearing the word
[1:41:04] and thus receiving rapturing faith.
[1:41:07] Friends,
[1:41:09] I was I've been
[1:41:13] yeah struggling I guess is the word
[1:41:16] striving.
[1:41:18] So you say say God I want to bring the
[1:41:20] promises for this day
[1:41:22] to these people
[1:41:25] promises that you have made.
[1:41:29] I will do it.
[1:41:33] You've been hearing the word as
[1:41:34] believers of the message
[1:41:39] and the people today assume all kinds of
[1:41:41] things
[1:41:44] and it's simply assumptions
[1:41:47] and people run off after run out after
[1:41:50] all kinds of opinions.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I heard this. It sounds good.
[1:41:54] Sounds what? Sounds good to what?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; To who?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; To your brain.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Your mind.
[1:42:02] It's got to be something within the
[1:42:04] soul.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Not something that just tickles up and
[1:42:07] down your spine. Not not something
[1:42:09] because it's just new.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Something because it's from God.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; God has proven himself.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And it's in the scripture.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; People have opinions on the horse riders
[1:42:22] in the book of Revelation.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Have the opinions on the horse riders
[1:42:26] and can tell you what the horse riders
[1:42:28] are.
[1:42:30] And how can you be so different? Are you
[1:42:32] listening to me?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; You can read it if you want to go on the
[1:42:36] internet and Google and whatever more
[1:42:38] and they'll have you the horse riders
[1:42:40] and they'll say the horse riders on a
[1:42:42] white horse and it's the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes and says, "It's
[1:42:52] the devil.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Who you going to take sides with?" Yeah.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Well, this man says the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:43:01] not too sure. And a doubt comes. Are you
[1:43:05] going to listen to that or are you going
[1:43:06] to listen to someone who tells people
[1:43:07] their names and their addresses?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; As a sign, and he tells you,
[1:43:14] furthermore, it's not me. This is Jesus
[1:43:16] Christ saying this.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know these things.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Are you going to believe that and
[1:43:22] embrace that?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; This is God speaking to me.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he says, "No, that's the
[1:43:27] devil.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; He's out to deceive.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; He's out writing in his deception." And
[1:43:35] furthermore, I want to say to you, he's
[1:43:37] been very successful in his deception.
[1:43:39] And he will be because the scripture
[1:43:41] tells us in Revelation, the same book
[1:43:43] that they're looking at, that all whose
[1:43:45] names are not written in the book of
[1:43:48] life will worship him.
[1:43:54] Don't catch yourself in that group.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Don't find yourself in that group.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; They have opinions on
[1:44:12] the Antichrist.
[1:44:14] All kinds of the opinions.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I listened to a man on the
[1:44:18] radio some years ago and he was going to
[1:44:21] open the seals and that's published.
[1:44:23] He's opened the seals.
[1:44:26] You never heard of it and a lot of other
[1:44:27] people never heard of it. Brother
[1:44:30] Brandham spoke on spoke the seals.
[1:44:33] They have all kinds of opinions on the
[1:44:35] Catholic Church. They have all kinds of
[1:44:36] opinions on Russia. They have opinions
[1:44:40] on the coming of the Lord
[1:44:42] and the different beasts.
[1:44:45] but completely missed what John saw
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; when John saw Christ.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And John said, "And I saw
[1:44:56] I saw
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; another mighty angel
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And he has over his head a rainbow,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS GOD'S PROMISE
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; TO NOAH.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; HE HAS A PROMISE OVER HIS HEAD.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD OF PROMISE. AMEN.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; I SEE THIS CHRIST COMING
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF THESE THEOLOGIANS MISS IT.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Their binoculars aren't lined up.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I learned it in Bible school. I'm
[1:45:29] sorry. You better turn the knob.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what my church teaches. You
[1:45:35] better turn the knob.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You better GET IT FROM A VINDICATED
[1:45:39] PROPHET.
[1:45:42] And he says clearly, he's descending
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and his feet are like brass,
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; like burning. And that's the way he's
[1:45:50] described in Revelation 1.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; And his voice is like that of thunders.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And he speaks
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; and puts one foot on the sea and one
[1:46:00] foot on the land.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He's in control of everything.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; This is him. Uh and the seventh verse
[1:46:07] says, "But in the days of the seventh
[1:46:10] angel or the seventh messenger, when he
[1:46:12] shall begin to sound,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; all the mystery of God should be
[1:46:16] finished." Why? Because now he's got a
[1:46:19] valid,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; proven,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; vindicated voice on the earth.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And when HE PUTS A VALID, VINDICATED
[1:46:28] VOICE ON THE EARTH, it's for you as a
[1:46:30] human to hear it.
[1:46:35] I didn't say understand it. Hear it.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Embrace it.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Confess it.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; And if you confess it, you will possess
[1:46:46] it.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'll tell you, it's your only
[1:46:49] way out of here.
[1:46:53] [applause]
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks, grow up.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; LET'S MATURE.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING down here in a bunch of
[1:46:59] froth
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and just a bunch OF EMOTIONALISM. WE'RE
[1:47:03] LIVING UP HERE IN HEAVENLY PLACES
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; WHERE JESUS CHRIST HAS BEEN MADE REAL,
[1:47:08] ALIVE.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody ought to raise their hand.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Say, I believe it.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; In the seven church ages, he says, "When
[1:47:27] I look,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; that'd be a good place for you to look.
[1:47:32] When I look
[1:47:35] said, I see the nations broke.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I see politics broke.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; I see the homes broke.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I see the church broke.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Now there's just nothing else can mend
[1:47:51] it but God.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And that's all cuz they have not nothing
[1:47:56] else. The morals of the nation is broke.
[1:48:00] And the political parties are broken.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Where we trusted so much in our
[1:48:06] politics, they are broke.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And every kingdom of this world will be
[1:48:11] broke in pieces.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ will rule and reign.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; If this were my last message, I'd want
[1:48:24] to preach it this way.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; You got faith in your government. Are
[1:48:29] they going to fix things? You know
[1:48:31] they're not.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You think the world can solve it?
[1:48:35] Listen, I'll just give you
[1:48:38] a paradox. This last week,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; this last week,
[1:48:43] this isn't ridicule. Not a bit. I
[1:48:46] respect the leaders, but this last week,
[1:48:51] the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the
[1:48:53] United States of America,
[1:48:56] Mr. John Kerry,
[1:48:59] a man of power,
[1:49:01] a man of great persuasion and in
[1:49:03] influence in the world,
[1:49:06] journeys to Israel.
[1:49:11] The president of the United Nations, Mr.
[1:49:14] moon.
[1:49:16] The president of the world body
[1:49:20] travels to Israel
[1:49:24] because there's been a few hundred
[1:49:25] people Palestinians killed in Gaza.
[1:49:32] You're normal people.
[1:49:35] Israel, Israel simply says,
[1:49:38] "Stop sending the rockets
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; and we will stop invading."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; The invasion has cost a lot of lives. Of
[1:49:50] course,
[1:49:52] Israel doesn't want Gaza.
[1:49:55] They don't want to see people killed.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking on their behalf.
[1:50:01] I'm just saying what's happening.
[1:50:04] This is what's happening.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Israel says, "Stop sending the rockets
[1:50:10] and we'll stop immediately."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Israel and Hamas have said,
[1:50:18] "We will give the people, they agreed to
[1:50:21] give the people 12 hours so they could
[1:50:23] get food and so on and so forth." After
[1:50:26] 12 hours, which has just passed, Hamas
[1:50:30] has started sending rockets into Israel.
[1:50:34] But Israel said, "No, we will we will
[1:50:38] not yet do anything. We're going to
[1:50:41] continue with a a ceasefire.
[1:50:46] In the meantime, here's Mr. Kerry.
[1:50:48] Listen to me now.
[1:50:50] I don't care what your opinion is. I'm
[1:50:52] just telling you what's happening.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Mr. Carrie and Mr. Moon, the president
[1:50:57] of the United Nations,
[1:51:01] they go where there's several hundred
[1:51:04] people killed and it's sad and children
[1:51:07] are killed and mothers and and and
[1:51:11] people are and they went over there and
[1:51:12] found themselves they found rockets
[1:51:15] stored in in in a in mosques,
[1:51:20] etc.
[1:51:21] Nevertheless, I'm not getting in the
[1:51:23] middle of it. I'm just telling you what
[1:51:24] happened.
[1:51:27] Now, I'm asking you a serious question.
[1:51:29] I want somebody to tell me, what spirit
[1:51:32] is directing those men? When in fact,
[1:51:36] not hundreds, but thousands.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Almost a hundred,000
[1:51:41] have been killed in Syria.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Did Mr. Moon go to Syria?
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Did Mr. Carrie go to Syria? No.
[1:51:53] But to go to Israel, soon as it's
[1:51:55] Israel,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; listen to me now. Serious friends
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; because this goes much deeper. This
[1:52:01] isn't politics. Politics is broke.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? Politics is broke.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; But why? I I ask you the question. You
[1:52:11] go home and ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION,
[1:52:13] WHY DIDN'T they go to Syria where
[1:52:14] thousands are being killed, CHILDREN ARE
[1:52:16] BEING KILLED, A million are up in Turkey
[1:52:19] in camps
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; living under terrible conditions.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they go there?
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Because this prophet is correct when he
[1:52:29] says every government is of the devil.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Every government.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You don't want to stay here, folks.
[1:52:41] You don't want to say they haven't got
[1:52:42] the answers.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Why do they go to Israel? Because that
[1:52:48] happens to be where God began to deal
[1:52:51] with a man by the name of Abraham
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; as one man.
[1:53:00] Started with Abraham
[1:53:02] and out from him came seed until it
[1:53:05] became an innumerable amount of people.
[1:53:09] And the Bible says
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; and they said they saw
[1:53:15] the promises of God
[1:53:19] a far off.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEY HELD AND EMBRACED THOSE
[1:53:24] PROMISES. They never inherited the land.
[1:53:28] They never got anything for it.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the kind of life you
[1:53:32] and I lived.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Many of them lived as poppers. Many of
[1:53:36] them were imprisoned. Many of them
[1:53:39] suffered many things. But the Bible
[1:53:41] tells US THEY LOOKED A FAR OFF. THEY
[1:53:44] WERE destitute
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; and they were imprisoned.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SUS
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; AND SUFFERED HEINOUS THINGS,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But they saw the promises.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; A far off
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; of whom the world is not worthy.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] and they held to those promises.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And now God has given us some promises,
[1:54:12] friends.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; When we talk about Revelation 10:1, go
[1:54:16] and read it. Maybe some of you don't
[1:54:18] even know what it says. But I saw
[1:54:20] another mighty angel descending from
[1:54:22] heaven. That's not just a story book
[1:54:25] phrase. That happens to be a promise.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; GOD
[1:54:33] OUT OF WHOSE BOSOM CAME CHRIST.
[1:54:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; HE HAD IN HIS MIND ONE DAY HE WILL
[1:54:39] RETURN BACK TO THE EARTH when it's a
[1:54:42] great scientific
[1:54:45] age.
[1:55:03] I'm going to talk about the scientific
[1:55:05] age. Want everybody watching.
[1:55:09] I've got a few slides.
[1:55:13] This first one
[1:55:16] is by faith Abraham. And then then I
[1:55:19] want to get right down where you live.
[1:55:24] By faith, Abraham.
[1:55:30] Can we dim the lights a wee bit, please?
[1:55:34] Are there? And if we need some help up
[1:55:35] there. Okay. By faith, Abraham
[1:55:39] when he was called to go out.
[1:55:43] The word here is called.
[1:55:46] How many here were called?
[1:55:50] I got I got a little a little something
[1:55:52] for you. A call isn't something where
[1:55:55] you just hear it in the morning or or
[1:55:57] hear in this service. You hear a voice,
[1:55:59] you hear the preaching and it stirs your
[1:56:01] heart. It may be that, but it's even
[1:56:03] deeper.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Prophet God, I want to touch your soul.
[1:56:10] Now, prophet God says it'll be a little
[1:56:15] uh ducks will go from Louisiana
[1:56:19] where brother John and his family are
[1:56:21] living now down Louisiana. They'll fly
[1:56:24] all the way up to the Arctic and in the
[1:56:28] marshes of the Arctic, they'll make
[1:56:30] nests. You understand that? They'll lay
[1:56:34] eggs and hatch them. And out comes
[1:56:36] little ducklings. And brother Brandham
[1:56:39] says those ducklings, they they swim out
[1:56:42] in a little pond. They don't know any
[1:56:45] other pond. That's the only pond they've
[1:56:47] ever known. Your pond. You don't know
[1:56:50] any other pond. This is where I was
[1:56:52] born. This is where I was raised. I was
[1:56:54] raised. I was born in a certain country.
[1:56:56] I was raised.
[1:56:58] You ate off that pond. That's all you
[1:57:01] know. And then,
[1:57:05] are you listening? And then the snow and
[1:57:09] the frost comes on the hills and a
[1:57:11] little breeze comes down
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; and it's a little chilly cold and that
[1:57:16] little duck will put his bill up in the
[1:57:19] air honker. Brother Brenham calls it and
[1:57:22] at the smell of that her honker he'll
[1:57:25] give a couple quack quack quack quack
[1:57:28] and all the others all the others know
[1:57:31] that he's a leader.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT?
[1:57:37] something in them says he's a leader.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; And they all swim over to him
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; and he hears that wind AND THERE'S A
[1:57:46] CALL IN HIM.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT come from?
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; AND HE TAKES OFF TO THE SKIES AND AS
[1:57:53] STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW, HE FLIES to
[1:57:55] Louisiana.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Where he's never been,
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER SAW IT.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS. YOU HEARD
[1:58:02] THIS MESSAGE. YOU DIDN'T JUST HEAR A
[1:58:04] PREACHER. YOU HEARD A CALL FROM ANOTHER
[1:58:08] PLACE. A CALL FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION AND
[1:58:11] A C IN THE COLD WINDS OF THIS WORLD AND
[1:58:14] THE VIOLENCE AND THE TROUBLE. AND I TELL
[1:58:17] YOU, ONE DAY, ONE DAY BY GOD'S PROMISE,
[1:58:20] EMBRACE IT. HOLD IT. You'll take off
[1:58:22] from here as straight as an arrow into
[1:58:26] an eternity
[1:58:28] INTO A PLACE, A PLACE PREPARED for you.
[1:58:33] Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place for
[1:58:37] you."
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Are you one of them?
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Are you one of them
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; on the balcony? Are you one of them?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Do you embrace that for yourself?
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; I prepare this place for you.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, you can just go to
[1:58:56] a casket.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, you can just
[1:59:00] remain here for tribulation.
[1:59:09] promise.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Promise of God.
[1:59:15] We shall not all sleep,
[1:59:19] but we shall all be changed
[1:59:23] in a moment. Is there anything in here
[1:59:25] is calling out?
[1:59:28] That thing that's calling is not just to
[1:59:30] escape the pond. It's not just to escape
[1:59:32] the frost, not just TO ESCAPE THE COLD
[1:59:35] WEATHER. It's to preserve their life.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And something in THEM, HE'S NEVER LEFT
[1:59:40] THERE. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE LOUISIANA
[1:59:42] IS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HEAVEN IS, BUT
[1:59:45] I'M GOING THERE.
[1:59:50] [applause and cheering]
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; THAT THING THAT CALLED ME,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; THAT THING THAT ANCHORED IN MY HEART,
[1:59:55] HE'S STILL GUIDING ME HERE. THE UNSEEN
[1:59:57] HAND.
[2:00:06] He should after receive for an
[2:00:08] inheritance he obeyed.
[2:00:11] He went out not knowing whether he went
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; like where you are today.
[2:00:16] He sojourned in a land of promise as in
[2:00:20] a strange country.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
[2:00:24] Jacob, the heirs with him of the
[2:00:27] promise. Now,
[2:00:32] we're going to take a quick turn.
[2:00:37] Two years ago,
[2:00:41] this happened
[2:00:44] on July the 22nd
[2:00:48] of 2012.
[2:00:51] about 24 months ago. This is the sun
[2:00:56] and down here is the Earth.
[2:01:00] That's the scale.
[2:01:04] And this that came out
[2:01:06] is a huge explosion
[2:01:09] from the sun
[2:01:11] traveling at
[2:01:13] 6,4
[2:01:15] 6,480
[2:01:17] miles an hour.
[2:01:21] 1,800 miles a second.
[2:01:28] It was a
[2:01:33] a satellite
[2:01:35] that took the picture and the satellite
[2:01:37] was struck straight on.
[2:01:45] This isn't some
[2:01:49] thing to
[2:01:51] startle you, but it is startling. I I
[2:01:53] thought about it most of the night.
[2:01:58] And this is what scientists NASA is very
[2:02:00] involved in this. NASA, the satellite
[2:02:03] that took this picture was a NASA NASA
[2:02:06] satellite.
[2:02:10] And they've said that while you didn't
[2:02:12] see it, feel it, or even read about it
[2:02:15] in the newspapers,
[2:02:17] Earth was almost knocked back to the
[2:02:19] Stone Age
[2:02:21] on July the 23rd,
[2:02:24] 2012.
[2:02:26] These are out of newspapers, out of the
[2:02:29] Kansas newspaper, out of the Florida
[2:02:31] newspaper, several of the newspapers.
[2:02:36] Almost two years ago to the day our most
[2:02:39] bountous and fantastical celestial body,
[2:02:43] the sun, kicked out one of the largest
[2:02:46] solar flares and coronal mass ejections
[2:02:50] ever recorded.
[2:02:53] And it missed the Earth by a whisker.
[2:02:56] If it had hit, we would still be picking
[2:02:59] up the pieces, says Daniel Baker, who
[2:03:02] led the research into the massive solar
[2:03:05] storm.
[2:03:12] It was on July the 22nd, 2012 that
[2:03:15] NASA's Stereo
[2:03:17] A spacecraft
[2:03:23] spotted what looked like an enormous
[2:03:26] solar eruption sending out a coronal
[2:03:28] mass ejection at blazing top speeds of
[2:03:32] roughly 1,800 m per second or 6,480,000
[2:03:38] mph. per hour, the fastest ever recorded
[2:03:41] by the spacecraft.
[2:03:43] By the time it actually passed stereo A,
[2:03:48] a mere 17 hours later, the magnetic
[2:03:52] cloud was still traveling at 750 m per
[2:03:54] second or 2,700,000
[2:03:58] per hour.
[2:04:03] Had the event hit the earth, it would
[2:04:07] have produced a record geomagnetic
[2:04:10] storm. It missed the earth by about 10
[2:04:13] to 15 minutes.
[2:04:17] Everything shuts down, Casey said.
[2:04:19] Without electricity, there is no
[2:04:21] manufacturing,
[2:04:23] no medicines,
[2:04:25] no processed food, no gasoline could be
[2:04:29] refined or even oil drilled.
[2:04:35] Your cell phone
[2:04:38] is instantly worthless.
[2:04:42] There's no phones. There's no
[2:04:44] communications.
[2:04:46] The earth was struck by one
[2:04:49] of these in 1859
[2:04:53] and it was a gentleman by the name of
[2:04:55] Carrington
[2:04:56] that uh was the it was called the
[2:04:59] Carrington event
[2:05:02] 1859
[2:05:04] we didn't have computers [snorts] we
[2:05:07] didn't have all of this scientific
[2:05:09] civilization
[2:05:11] and this prophet spoke about the
[2:05:14] scientific civilization
[2:05:16] and finally said and said more than one
[2:05:18] place. Listen now. He said that world I
[2:05:24] go to prepare a place for you. He said
[2:05:26] that world will have none of the
[2:05:28] scientific things.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; It'll be so far beyond this.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to think now because you are
[2:05:39] the residents of this civilization.
[2:05:42] And I felt led to say this.
[2:05:47] And in that in that there was only
[2:05:50] telegraph wires. And the telegraph wires
[2:05:53] were actually fused by the by the force
[2:05:56] of this magnetic
[2:05:59] thing. And the women that were sitting
[2:06:01] taking telegraphs
[2:06:03] and their they had their notepads in
[2:06:05] front of them. They said things sparked
[2:06:07] and the notepads caught on fire.
[2:06:12] And after the batteries were burned out,
[2:06:15] completely burned out, they could still
[2:06:17] hear the voices going by the effect of
[2:06:20] this
[2:06:24] sunburst.
[2:06:26] But they said if one happened today, and
[2:06:29] this is what all the newspapers use,
[2:06:31] they said it would literally unplug the
[2:06:35] planet.
[2:06:40] You that have electric stoves, you
[2:06:41] wouldn't turn it on and cook dinner and
[2:06:44] your fridge would immediately begin to
[2:06:46] deteriorate.
[2:06:48] Your deep freezes would begin to spoil
[2:06:51] the food.
[2:06:53] And those of you who don't know how to
[2:06:54] make a fire would have a hard time
[2:06:57] cooking anything.
[2:07:02] This is precisely
[2:07:05] and this is this is so such a reality
[2:07:08] today that in the Washington and then
[2:07:10] amongst the Senate and so on they have
[2:07:13] debate going on and discussions going on
[2:07:16] about how to harden [clears throat] the
[2:07:18] electrical systems and they're telling
[2:07:20] the electrical providers that you must
[2:07:23] take take steps to harden the system
[2:07:26] somehow and protect it against such a a
[2:07:30] last. They said that there's a 6% chance
[2:07:33] that the Earth would have a direct hit
[2:07:36] within the next 10 years.
[2:07:42] You know what I think?
[2:07:48] I think that our God
[2:07:51] who loves righteousness and hates
[2:07:54] iniquity
[2:07:55] hates this scientific age.
[2:08:09] And I was just reading this on the
[2:08:10] computer and then there's some pictures
[2:08:12] and maybe maybe you would also like to
[2:08:15] turn to these.
[2:08:17] Maybe you'd also like to read these.
[2:08:20] It's only about six of them. One of them
[2:08:22] is a woman advertising her that what it
[2:08:27] what the event was when she announced
[2:08:29] she was a lesbian.
[2:08:34] That's exactly why God's going to
[2:08:36] destroy it.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you saints from China. Maybe
[2:08:42] this isn't what you came to hear, but
[2:08:45] this is the age we're living in. It's a
[2:08:48] wicked age. The same devil that's in
[2:08:50] America is in China. The same devil
[2:08:52] that's in China is in Europe.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; The same devil's in Russia and the
[2:08:58] Ukraine and wherever more. It's the same
[2:09:00] evil spirit. And friends, I want to say
[2:09:02] to you modern people, don't get caught
[2:09:05] up in this modern world.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Your scientists are saying it could be
[2:09:09] back to the stone age in just a moment.
[2:09:12] Right.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; And perhaps this is a warning
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; that God is giving to people who will
[2:09:23] hear.
[2:09:24] This could happen in just a moment.
[2:09:27] What would you do tomorrow morning?
[2:09:32] Well, I'll go to school. No, you
[2:09:33] wouldn't go to school. There's no
[2:09:35] lights. Remember,
[2:09:38] can you imagine all the hospital
[2:09:40] equipment that shut down and the people
[2:09:43] waiting for emergency operations
[2:09:46] and there is no such a thing? Friends,
[2:09:48] you think that this is some kind of
[2:09:50] story? This is what science is telling
[2:09:51] us. The very science that produced us is
[2:09:53] telling us what it could do.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; And God, when he said, "Let there be
[2:09:59] light,"
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; he knew every flare that would come out
[2:10:02] of that. He knew where it would go.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; And if it if it strikes this little
[2:10:08] planet,
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; it'll not merely be a wakeup call.
[2:10:15] You your mind cannot grasp or comprehend
[2:10:20] what that would do.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking about it for the last
[2:10:24] several hours, for a day or two.
[2:10:42] This is the structure of what it would
[2:10:43] affect. The oil and gas, communications,
[2:10:47] the water, the banking and finance, ATMs
[2:10:51] wouldn't work, government services,
[2:10:53] emergency services, transportation,
[2:10:56] electric power. Can you imagine planes
[2:10:58] not flying?
[2:11:02] If that had happened or does happen,
[2:11:05] people are on one side of the world will
[2:11:07] remain there because I guarantee you
[2:11:09] there's no flights back.
[2:11:16] They said that it would affect no less
[2:11:19] than 130 million people. They're just
[2:11:22] showing some of it there. The these are
[2:11:25] not my findings.
[2:11:31] God give you faith to receive the
[2:11:33] promises. And there shall be signs in
[2:11:35] the sun and in the moon and in the stars
[2:11:38] and upon the earth distress of nations
[2:11:42] with perplexity,
[2:11:43] the sea and the waves roaring.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Men's hearts failing
[2:11:49] them for fear and for looking after
[2:11:51] those things which are coming
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[2:11:57] For the powers of the heaven shall be
[2:12:00] shaken.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Moses faith led him to watch what would
[2:12:08] be, not what was. Looking at tomorrow
[2:12:12] instead of today. Look at the promise
[2:12:15] instead of the glamour.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Look at the people instead of the
[2:12:18] organization.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Lot could see the glamour of prosperity
[2:12:22] down in Sodom. Lot could see the
[2:12:24] possibilities of a of of a lot of money.
[2:12:28] Lot could see the possibilities of when
[2:12:31] he looked over to Sodom and he could
[2:12:34] maybe become maybe that he was a Hebrew,
[2:12:37] he might become a great man there
[2:12:40] because he was a great intellectual
[2:12:42] figure and the nephew of Abraham. So he
[2:12:46] chose to go towards Sodom.
[2:12:49] Lot's intellects led him to see the
[2:12:52] glamour of prosperity.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Lot's intellects, you have to do what
[2:12:56] you want to do with these.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Lot's intellects led him to see the
[2:13:00] blessing of glamour, but his faith was
[2:13:03] so paralyzed
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; by it. He didn't see the fire that was
[2:13:09] going to destroy that sort of a that
[2:13:12] sort of a life. Right.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; I am not saying and I'm not here to be
[2:13:17] an alarmist, but I'm here to be a
[2:13:20] realist.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; This is God's word.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; This isn't NASA speaking now. This is
[2:13:25] God's word. I don't care whether it
[2:13:27] comes from the sun or just out of
[2:13:29] heaven, but God caused SOMETHING TO
[2:13:31] COME. FIRE CAME FROM heaven
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; and destroyed SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND
[2:13:35] THEY NEVER BEEN RAISED UP.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; God's got all kinds of ways he can do
[2:13:42] things. And the same God THAT DESTROYS
[2:13:45] ONE ALSO GIVES LIFE TO ANOTHER.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROMISE OF GOD SAYS YOU ARE A
[2:13:50] SON and daughter of God.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that? And he said
[2:13:54] furthermore that the reason why the
[2:13:56] reason why the faith worked for Jesus is
[2:13:59] because he knew where he came from and
[2:14:01] he knew who he was.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; And he SAYS EVERY BELIEVER HAS TO KNOW
[2:14:06] WHO THEY ARE.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; AND if you KNOW THAT YOU'RE A SON AND
[2:14:09] DAUGHTER OF GOD, THEN YOU CAN EXERCISE
[2:14:12] FAITH.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[2:14:15] YOU CAN EXERCISE FAITH.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN GET ON
[2:14:20] THE ON THE phone to and tell them to
[2:14:23] pray with you. That may be fine. But
[2:14:26] it's you'd have to know who you are,
[2:14:29] where you CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
[2:14:31] AND WHO SPOKE TO YOU.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD, THAT FAITH IN KNOWING WHO
[2:14:36] YOU ARE, THAT'S THE FAITH THAT OPERATES
[2:14:38] THESE THINGS.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; You don't need anymore.
[2:14:42] Do you hear me? [cheering]
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; You don't need anything more.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach, friends, till you
[2:14:51] get it.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; We want a church of faith.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; WE WANT A CHURCH THAT'S NOT LIVING IN
[2:15:00] THE PAST OR WAY UP IN THE FUTURE, BUT A
[2:15:03] CHURCH THAT'S RECEIVING THINGS FROM GOD
[2:15:05] NOW.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to camp. YOU SAY, "OH GOD,
[2:15:09] FILL ME WITH YOUR SPIRIT, WITH A MEASURE
[2:15:12] I'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE."
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; WE NEED IT. WE NEED IT FOR THE DAYS
[2:15:17] WE'RE LIVING IN. I CAN'T JUST GO ON the
[2:15:20] way we have.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; how about you up in the balcony? IS THIS
[2:15:26] SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART?
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; COME. Come to the fountain.
[2:15:37] Come.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; He has everything you need.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Come. He'll transform your transform
[2:15:47] your life.
[2:16:24] I left my cliffer.
[2:16:28] Can you change that to the next? Just
[2:16:30] lead the next one on, please.
[2:16:33] But the heavens and the earth,
[2:16:38] which are now by the same word, are kept
[2:16:42] in store,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; reserved unto fire against the day of
[2:16:46] judgment and predition of ungodly men.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Next one, please.
[2:16:53] But beloved,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; beloved,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; amen,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; I feel that with all my heart and soul.
[2:16:58] Beloved,
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; beloved of the Lord,
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; called by Jesus Christ,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; have you been called?
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; I ask it again. Have you been called?
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; You know that happened. That call came.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. The little duck
[2:17:21] has a call. The prophet talked about
[2:17:23] horses. He was plowing with his father
[2:17:26] and the horses are snorting and he and
[2:17:28] he says to his dad, "What is that?" He
[2:17:31] said, "There's a storm coming. They
[2:17:33] already know it. It hasn't even arrived.
[2:17:35] There's no evidence of a storm, but the
[2:17:37] horses snorting know it."
[2:17:40] I lived in the wilderness. When I was a
[2:17:43] boy, I would hear
[2:17:48] and it was just natural. I knew that
[2:17:51] there was a wind coming because I could
[2:17:53] hear the wind and maybe 10, 15 minutes
[2:17:56] the wind would be blowing in. But they
[2:17:58] just hear it. They know it. All the
[2:18:00] birds that nest, they get away from the
[2:18:03] walls that are going to fall and go out
[2:18:06] in the middle of the field cuz
[2:18:07] earthquake's coming. All these animals,
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; all this creation, but we're so
[2:18:13] involved. We got to be on our phone and
[2:18:16] we've got to be texting and we got to be
[2:18:19] learning and we got to be reading and
[2:18:20] we're making such plans for this life
[2:18:22] and for this and and the Holy SPIRIT IS
[2:18:25] SAYING LOOK UP.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Give ear.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hear what I sent.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; I will send you.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know why we needed Elijah?
[2:18:44] because of the day that we're in.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; We needed SOMETHING THAT COULD SHAKE US
[2:18:48] OUT OF our
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; out of our comfort,
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; out of the ease.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm not predicting. I'm not making
[2:18:56] any prediction. I'm not even I'M JUST
[2:18:59] SAYING THIS COULD BE ONE thing God could
[2:19:01] use.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; And what I wanted to register with you
[2:19:04] this morning is that that could happen
[2:19:07] today.
[2:19:09] And this whole world, the whole world,
[2:19:11] I'll use their phrase, not mine, would
[2:19:14] unplug.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; THEY'D UNPLUG THE PLANET.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, my dear friends,
[2:19:20] you'd find life has changed for you
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; drastically. And that's why we take
[2:19:26] these things serious.
[2:19:33] But beloved, be not ignorant of this one
[2:19:36] thing, that the day that one day is with
[2:19:39] the Lord as a thousand years, and a
[2:19:40] thousand years as one day. The Lord is
[2:19:43] not slack concerning his promise as some
[2:19:46] men count slackness, but is
[2:19:48] long-suffering to us word, not willing
[2:19:50] that any should perish, but that all
[2:19:53] should come to repentance.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; But the day of the Lord will come.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Is that a promise?
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; The day of the Lord will come. I want to
[2:20:03] say furthermore with with those of you
[2:20:05] that have had this revelation of the
[2:20:08] message,
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; the day of the Lord has come.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I I don't know."
[2:20:17] Well, here I'll just give you a pair of
[2:20:18] binoculars.
[2:20:27] When a prophet of God actually spoke and
[2:20:30] predicted ahead of time, prophesied
[2:20:32] ahead of time that he'd meet
[2:20:36] the angels of the Lord
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; and the seals would be open.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; And they came from heaven
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; and they and the opening of the seals,
[2:20:46] he says the seals was him.
[2:20:50] Hello. Can you embrace that?
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; The seals was him.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; And he took the seals off of himself.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; If I take the coat off of myself,
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; I don't have it anymore.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; He took the seals off of himself.
[2:21:18] Who said that?
[2:21:20] He took the seals off of himself. It all
[2:21:23] ties together. Why? Because she's bride.
[2:21:26] He's bridegroom.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; The bride and the bridegroom go don't go
[2:21:32] into marriage with all kinds of secrets.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; They come they come to marriage into
[2:21:38] that most intimate estate and completely
[2:21:41] exposed. Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; I have no more secrets. That's why it
[2:21:47] had to be that way. That's why the seals
[2:21:49] come off of him because I have no more
[2:21:51] secrets. And then the prophet says
[2:21:53] another place and he's whispering
[2:21:55] secrets to her.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE A MAN IS COMING TO BE A
[2:22:01] HUSBAND OF A WIFE IS WHISPERING HIS
[2:22:03] SECRETS TO HIS BRIDE.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; These are his secrets.
[2:22:08] I've covered a lot of ground this
[2:22:10] morning,
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; but I wanted to DO THAT SO THAT THIS
[2:22:12] CONGREGATION AND THOSE YOU THOSE OF YOU
[2:22:14] GOING to camp might know. Listen
[2:22:17] friends, if even this PICTURE WHAT
[2:22:19] HAPPENED IF THAT HADN'T MISSED IT by 10
[2:22:21] or 15 minutes, you wouldn't even be
[2:22:23] going to a camp. There wouldn't be a
[2:22:24] camp.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; You'd be trying to FIGURE OUT HOW TO
[2:22:27] SURVIVE.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Bicycles will be at a premium.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; There won't be fuel for your cars.
[2:22:36] Right?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; The pumps won't work.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Life will be changed dramatically. Is
[2:22:43] that going to happen? Is that WHAT
[2:22:44] YOU'RE PREACHING? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
[2:22:45] I'M PREACHING. THAT COULD HAPPEN. THAT'S
[2:22:47] A REALITY.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; And the great scientists who are far
[2:22:52] greater than me are the ones that are
[2:22:53] telling us about this.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; They're not to startle us. They're just
[2:22:57] telling us. And that's why they didn't
[2:22:58] tell it for about two years.
[2:23:03] But God said it hundreds and hundreds of
[2:23:05] years ago.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; So the day of the Lord will come as a
[2:23:08] thief in the night and in which the
[2:23:10] heavens shall pass away
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; with a great noise and the elements
[2:23:15] shall melt with fervent heat.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; The earth also and the works that are
[2:23:19] therein shall be burned up.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Shall be burned up.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; And the works therein shall be burned
[2:23:25] up. IF IF YOUR LIFE IS JUST ALL CONSUMED
[2:23:29] WITH THE WORKS THEREOF, you're going to
[2:23:30] lose it all.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; LET US MAKE OUR HOME OUR ETERNAL
[2:23:35] WELFARE.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; SAY TO ALL PERSONS HERE IN THIS
[2:23:38] BUILDING, IF YOU LIVE FOR THIS LIFE, YOU
[2:23:40] LOSE.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LIVE FOR THE OTHER WORLD, you
[2:23:43] win.
[2:23:52] Seeing then that all these things shall
[2:23:54] be dissolved, what manner of persons
[2:23:57] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[2:23:59] and godliness,
[2:24:04] looking for and hastening under the
[2:24:06] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[2:24:08] heavens being on fire shall be
[2:24:10] dissolved, and the elements shall melt
[2:24:11] with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[2:24:15] according
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah [clears throat]
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; to his promise.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. We according to
[2:24:25] his promise look for a new heavens
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[2:24:33] righteousness. Oh God, I want to be done
[2:24:35] with this world.
[2:24:37] I want to be done with all of this
[2:24:40] trouble and sorrow and white fighting
[2:24:43] and violence AND WAR AND EVIL and filth
[2:24:46] and so on.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; And here's our promise.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; I give it to you
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; according to his promise.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; We look for new heavens. Embrace it.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Hold it tight to your bosom
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; and a new earth
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[2:25:06] I would imagine everything that has
[2:25:08] become extinct will be back in the new
[2:25:10] heaven and the new earth.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, young men that have
[2:25:19] a few years ahead of you, those years
[2:25:22] are going to go just like that.
[2:25:29] And one day when you have my gray hair,
[2:25:32] I tell you as a father, you want to be
[2:25:35] able to turn around, young ladies,
[2:25:38] you want to be able to turn around and
[2:25:39] say, "I have nothing to regret."
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We work as hard as we can. We do
[2:25:47] all that we can and we we tell everybody
[2:25:50] we can.
[2:25:52] We live for Christ in the good times, in
[2:25:55] the bad times.
[2:25:57] We live for him. And he want to be able
[2:26:00] to turn around and say, "I don't regret
[2:26:02] it."
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Living for him.
[2:26:10] Let's all stand.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Wonder Brother Ryan or could come to the
[2:26:20] piano, please.
[2:26:22] Let's bow our heads, please.
[2:26:29] Oh, Father,
[2:26:33] in the quietness and reverence of this
[2:26:35] moment,
[2:26:37] and I respect the people that have
[2:26:40] driven long distances. I see them here
[2:26:43] from Seattle, Renton, Tacoma.
[2:26:47] The people from China have flown all the
[2:26:50] way from China.
[2:26:52] I would not want to be accused of
[2:26:54] wasting their valuable time.
[2:26:59] God, what you laid on my heart and even
[2:27:01] to this morning,
[2:27:03] I pray that you will take this word,
[2:27:05] these words.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will take these things
[2:27:10] that the prophet of God spoke so
[2:27:12] clearly.
[2:27:14] I pray that you will brand our souls.
[2:27:19] Lord, may there be an imprint upon us
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; that will be of eternal in its nature.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Let us not limp along, oh God, with a
[2:27:28] watered down confession.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; But may it be a fervent confession.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; May it be AN OLDTIME CONFESSION as the
[2:27:36] early church had.
[2:27:38] I pray, oh God, you'll take the simple
[2:27:41] things that I attempted to use today and
[2:27:45] that the people will look to see what is
[2:27:47] it that I'm looking at.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; What is it that I see? What is it that's
[2:27:51] taking up my entire being? I pray Lord
[2:27:55] Jesus, Lord Jesus, oh loving not only
[2:28:00] bridegroom but husband
[2:28:02] as you spoke in the revelation, [music]
[2:28:05] come and I'll show you the lamb's wife.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:28:10] Oh God. Oh God, let me be one of that in
[2:28:15] that number. I pray.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we desire to be in that number.
[2:28:20] Hallelujah.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, if there's any here that are
[2:28:24] not in that
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; they're not in that number and they they
[2:28:29] know that it's not right yet in their
[2:28:30] heart. They have never received Jesus
[2:28:32] Christ. May they come from sinner to
[2:28:35] saint.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; May they be transformed, oh God, from
[2:28:38] the world to the world that is to come.
[2:28:41] Amen.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, that you will work
[2:28:44] mightily in the lives of individuals. A
[2:28:47] sister's yet to be baptized, a sister
[2:28:50] desires to be prayed for. I pray, oh
[2:28:53] God, you hear us as we are in [music]
[2:28:55] prayer now. And we pray that you will
[2:28:58] come, Father,
[2:29:01] manifest and show yourself
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; today in power today. This woman that's
[2:29:07] going to be prayed for, may she be
[2:29:09] healed, oh God, but may her sight go far
[2:29:12] beyond just healing. May her sight go on
[2:29:16] to salvation to the redeemer. I pray in
[2:29:19] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:29:23] Amen. Bless the people, Lord.
[2:29:29] Oh my brother, oh my loving brother.
[2:29:34] Father Matthew, if you'd like to bring
[2:29:35] the sister, please.

[2:35:39] Lovely Lord Jesus.
[2:35:41] How we
[2:35:43] are so moved [music] in our hearts
[2:35:47] here. This young lady just coming here,
[2:35:49] Lord, and coming to church. [music]
[2:35:52] She's never been here before.
[2:35:55] She doesn't speak our language, but you
[2:35:58] speak her language.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Speak to her soul, oh God.
[2:36:04] I pray you will bless our [music]
[2:36:05] visitors.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will give them, oh God,
[2:36:10] that they might hear your call. For
[2:36:13] surely you have called. Even in this
[2:36:15] service, you have called. And while I'm
[2:36:17] at this point in my prayer, I want to
[2:36:20] ask this congregation, while my eyes are
[2:36:22] closed and I'm in prayer, [music]
[2:36:24] if you have felt God dealing with you
[2:36:26] and speaking to you and you know that
[2:36:28] there's something more for you, why
[2:36:30] don't you raise your hand and say, "Here
[2:36:31] am I, Lord. Here am I. [music]
[2:36:34] Here I am, Lord. I'm here, oh God, to
[2:36:36] hear what further you have to say. And
[2:36:38] you'll speak [music] to us. You'll speak
[2:36:40] through our brother Craig Bo. You'll
[2:36:42] speak through my friends. You'll speak
[2:36:44] through your word. You'll speak through
[2:36:46] your messenger. You'll hear I will hear
[2:36:49] specific things that you want me to
[2:36:51] hear. Heavenly Father, now I pray in the
[2:36:54] name of Jesus Christ that you that have
[2:36:57] come down and descended and have spoken
[2:36:59] with such a clear message. [music] Oh
[2:37:01] God, let it become a reality. Amen.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; I pray that a spirit of revelation may
[2:37:07] fall upon the people and that they will
[2:37:09] be openhearted and received from you, oh
[2:37:12] God, and that they might say in unison,
[2:37:15] "Lord Jesus, just lead me, direct me,
[2:37:18] direct my thoughts. Show me the path
[2:37:20] that I must take. Not the path that I've
[2:37:23] always walked in, but the path that you
[2:37:25] would have me to take at this time."
[2:37:27] [music] And father, I pray that the
[2:37:30] effect of this service will long
[2:37:32] continue beyond this this time in the
[2:37:36] name of Jesus Christ. We love you. Amen.
[2:37:40] Amen. You may be seated.
[2:37:44] We just ask you to be patient a [music]
[2:37:46] few more moments and uh
[2:37:50] we're going to baptize Sister Price. I
[2:37:53] wonder if we could just do we have a
[2:37:56] song we could just sang a [music] verse
[2:37:57] or two of a song.
[2:38:02] Okay.
[2:38:04] In the unseen hand,
[2:38:09] there is an unseen [music]
[2:38:15] [singing] hand to [music]

[2:42:52] Amen. Some people throughout the times
[2:42:55] and testimonies over the years have saw
[2:42:58] holes through the ice to be baptized.
[2:43:02] We're pretty close. We're pretty close.
[2:43:04] Sister Precious, come on over here.
[2:43:12] Well, Sister Precious, this is what
[2:43:13] you've been desiring.
