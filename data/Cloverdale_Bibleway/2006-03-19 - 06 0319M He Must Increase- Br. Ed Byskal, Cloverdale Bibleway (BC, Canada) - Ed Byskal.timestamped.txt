[0:00] Praise the Lord.
[0:02] We want to greet you each and everyone
[0:05] in the name of Jesus Christ. Welcome you
[0:07] to his house.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you the tabernacle, the living
[0:11] God?
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's certainly
[0:15] good to be standing this morning,
[0:18] breathing the air that God's created,
[0:20] enjoying these dimensions that he's
[0:22] given us to live in. Not beyond the
[0:25] curtain of time yet, but looking forward
[0:27] to it.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn the screen to 24:30.
[0:33] Soon and very soon, we're going to go
[0:36] and be with our Lord forever, eternally.
[0:40] Amen. Let's sing it together if we can.
[0:47] Oh, soon and very soon we are going to
[0:52] see the King.
[0:55] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[0:59] the king. I know soon and very soon we

[1:25] the king.
[1:27] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[1:32] the king. Hallelujah.
[1:35] Hallelu.
[1:37] We're going to see the king. Oh, there's
[1:40] no more dying there. We are going to see
[1:45] the king.
[1:47] No more dying there. We are going to see
[1:52] the king.
[1:54] No more dying there. We are going to see
[1:58] the king. Hallelu.
[2:02] Hallelu.
[2:03] We're going to see the king. Oh, soon
[2:07] and very soon we are going to see the
[2:12] king.
[2:13] [Music]
[2:15] I know we are going to see the king.
[2:20] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[2:24] the king. Hallelu.
[2:28] Hallelu.
[2:29] We're going to see the king.
[2:33] [Music]
[2:34] I'm coming up.
[2:38] Oh the rough side
[2:42] of the mountain.
[2:48] Holding God, his powerful hand.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm coming up.
[2:57] Oh,
[3:00] on the rough side.
[3:03] [Music]
[3:05] Oh, I'm doing my best. Oh, let's all
[3:09] stand and sing it together this morning.
[3:12] I'm coming up.
[3:16] Oh, on the right side
[3:20] of the mountain.
[3:25] Oh, God.
[3:28] His powerful hand.
[3:32] I'm coming up. Are you coming up? Oh,
[3:39] [Applause]
[3:40] of the mountain.
[3:44] I'm doing my best to make it in.
[3:50] I'm coming up
[3:55] on the rough side
[3:58] of the mountain.
[4:03] Holy God,
[4:07] his powerful hand.
[4:11] I'm coming up.
[4:14] Oh, on the right side
[4:19] of the mountain.
[4:23] And I'm doing my best to make it.
[4:30] Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a hand
[4:32] clap of praise this morning.
[4:35] Amen.
[4:37] Amen. Why don't you turn to somebody
[4:38] standing next to you? Give him a
[4:40] handshake.
[4:42] Say, "God bless you, brother. God bless
[4:44] you, sister. It's good to be in the
[4:46] presence of the Lord this morning."
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:50] Truly wonderful. We've got a lot of
[4:53] prayer requests this morning. How many
[4:55] thankful for that? Another opportunity
[4:57] for the Lord to show his power and his
[5:00] grace in our midst. We've got
[5:02] testimonies.
[5:04] Praise the Lord. It's a wonderful day to
[5:07] be alive. Amen.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Do you have a good perspective of that?
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your eyes fixed on Calvary.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thought.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, we want to take
[5:20] the needs before the Lord. But just
[5:21] before we do, why don't we sing
[5:24] Sheltered in the Arms of God, number
[5:26] 253.
[5:28] [Music]
[5:32] So let the storms raise high.
[5:39] Oh they don't bother me
[5:44] for I shall saint within the arms of
[5:51] God.
[5:55] He walks with me
[5:59] and all
[6:02] can harm me

[6:06] for I shall
[6:11] the arms of God.
[6:16] So let the souls raise high.
[6:22] Oh thank you Jesus.
[6:25] Hallelujah.
[6:27] We give you praise, Lord.
[6:30] Lord, you sheltered us in the cl that
[6:32] rock this morning.
[6:36] Oh,
[6:38] he walks with me
[6:43] and
[6:50] for I sh
[6:53] [Music]
[6:55] Oh, why don't you lift your hands? Let
[6:57] the wind of his Holy Spirit just flow
[6:59] through this place. Let the stor.
[7:05] Hallelujah.
[7:07] They don't worry me
[7:11] for I shall
[7:15] within the arms of God.
[7:21] He walks with me
[7:26] and
[7:27] earth
[7:29] [Music]
[7:33] for I shall
[7:38] the arms of God.
[7:43] So let the stones raise high.
[7:48] Dark clouds rise they don't overin
[7:54] [Music]

[8:10] and all
[8:11] [Music]
[8:17] for I

[8:27] Hallelujah.
[8:29] Oh, we give you praise this morning,
[8:31] Lord. from the depths of our heart.
[8:33] Lord, we give you thanks, Jesus. Lord,
[8:36] that we can look outside and see the
[8:38] natural sun. Lord, a testimony that you
[8:41] have given us on a day-to-day basis,
[8:43] Father, that your resurrection is alive
[8:46] and well. Father, we want to thank you
[8:49] this morning that we could all be
[8:50] standing here present, Lord, not in one
[8:53] another's presence, Lord, but in your
[8:55] presence, Father.
[8:57] Hallelujah. It thrills our souls, Lord
[9:00] Jesus, to see what you're doing amongst
[9:02] your body, Lord, around the world, as we
[9:05] have seen the testimonies our brother
[9:06] Tony has brought back to us, Lord. Lord,
[9:09] of what you're doing in Asia, Lord, what
[9:11] you're doing down in South America,
[9:13] Father. Lord, we want to look to all
[9:16] those places and see that the mighty
[9:18] hand of God is doing a great sweep in
[9:20] these last days.
[9:22] [Music]
[9:23] Lord, as our brother brought it to our
[9:25] attention to God,
[9:27] &gt;&gt; how much more do we want to do our be
[9:30] faithful in the house of God here in our
[9:32] own place of worship, Lord, in our own
[9:35] backyards, Lord,
[9:37] the word first had to go out of
[9:39] Jerusalem.
[9:42] Father, we want to give you praise this
[9:44] morning that you, Father, would be high
[9:45] and lifted up,
[9:49] Lord, as we will read these prayer
[9:50] requests out before you, Lord. No doubt
[9:54] a brother will come and stand behind
[9:55] this sacred desk and pray over them,
[9:58] Lord, that people will raise their
[9:59] voices, Lord, crying out to you once
[10:03] more that you would come on the scene
[10:05] for these great needs. But Lord, it's
[10:08] because we have a confidence that you
[10:10] are a the God of creation, a God that
[10:13] made this very body that we're standing
[10:15] in. You are more than able to raise it
[10:18] up.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; So Lord, may there be a great multitude
[10:21] of testimonies come back,
[10:24] &gt;&gt; maybe read out once again as a testimony
[10:27] for what you have done. We just commit
[10:30] this service to you now.
[10:34] Have your own way, Lord.
[10:36] is our desire.
[10:39] Hallelujah.
[10:42] Hallelujah.
[10:44] Amen.
[10:46] [Music]
[10:48] We've got a testimony from brother Randy
[10:51] and sister Lorie Snow and family
[10:56] like to give honor and praise to our God
[10:58] for all his mercy and goodness to us. A
[11:01] couple of weeks ago, Amanda had a tumor
[11:03] removed from her finger. The surgeon,
[11:05] who is the chief surgeon of the
[11:07] orthopedics at Children's Hospital, was
[11:09] certain that it was cancer. After
[11:12] calling Brother Ed for prayer, we
[11:13] decided to speak the word claiming that
[11:16] this was not cancer and that the doctors
[11:18] would be baffled when it turned out not
[11:21] to be. Friday, we received a call from
[11:24] the oncologist.
[11:27] After receiving the report from the
[11:29] pathologist, which had done several
[11:31] different tests, even additional tests
[11:33] not normally done, the word was given
[11:36] back that the tumor was in fact not
[11:38] cancer,
[11:40] &gt;&gt; but a benign skin tumor. Praise the
[11:42] Lord. We rejoice in the Lord for his
[11:45] coming on the scene to help us once
[11:46] again.
[11:49] Amen.
[11:52] Praise the Lord. They also have an
[11:54] unspoken request that they'd like us to
[11:57] remember in prayer this morning as we go
[11:59] to prayer.
[12:02] Amen. We've got several needs to let you
[12:04] know about this morning.
[12:07] [Music]
[12:09] I don't know why, but I can't call
[12:10] anybody to pray. It's very strange.
[12:15] I guess we're going to have to pray
[12:16] together this morning. We'll have 900 on
[12:20] that side praying and I'll stand up here
[12:21] and pray with you. Amen.
[12:28] We want to remember the Green family. As
[12:30] you know, Brother Albert Green went home
[12:32] to be with the Lord this past January.
[12:34] Today, his wife, Sister Elizabeth Green,
[12:37] suffered a stroke, and at this point,
[12:38] she is paralyzed on her left side and
[12:41] her speech is slurred.
[12:44] The doctors have given her some some new
[12:46] medication which is supposed to lessen
[12:49] the severity of the effects, but they're
[12:51] asking that the saints would pray for
[12:53] her in this time of need. That's sent in
[12:56] by brother Joe Green.
[12:58] We want to remember
[13:02] Sister Hazel Gerald's in Florida. This
[13:04] is from Sister Leverne Clemens. She is
[13:07] having a second surgery to unblock the
[13:09] artery on the other side of her neck.
[13:12] That'll be on March 24th.
[13:17] [Music]
[13:21] We want to remember Sister Cliff
[13:24] and Heather. I believe it's Karpon in
[13:27] Saskatoon. Sister Heather is 5 months
[13:31] pregnant and was told that the baby had
[13:33] spina spina bifida. And we're asking
[13:37] that the saints would pray for her this
[13:39] morning that all would be well.
[13:50] [Music]
[13:51] I can't pronounce this last name, but I
[13:55] believe it's from Gina Marie. I'm asking
[13:57] that the brothers and sisters pray for
[13:59] me and my family. Lived in Congo
[14:04] uh back in 1999. Asked that God would
[14:06] help them and help their family. join
[14:10] them in prayer.
[14:12] Brother Curtis Walman wants us to pray
[14:14] for sister Melissa as she is at home
[14:15] this morning with pneumonia.
[14:19] Ask that the Lord would grant her a
[14:21] healing touch.
[14:23] Amen. I believe that we can enter into
[14:25] the burdens of the needs that we have
[14:27] before us this morning. Lift them up
[14:29] before the throne of grace. Amen. If you
[14:32] have a need upon your own heart, why
[14:34] don't you lift it up before him as we go
[14:36] to prayer with every head bowed and
[14:40] every eye closed,
[14:42] our hearts are borne up before you this
[14:45] morning, Father. Lord, we stand in your
[14:48] august presence, Jesus. Lord, knowing
[14:51] that you are the great creator of
[14:54] heavens and earth and you said there
[14:57] shall be a light in the evening time.
[15:01] Father, we believe that we are standing
[15:03] at the very brink of the coming of the
[15:06] Lord.
[15:07] Father, when you would come and catch
[15:09] your waiting bride away, Lord, there is
[15:12] an action that goes with the waiting
[15:14] portion. Father, Lord, we believe that
[15:17] we are waiting this morning with a great
[15:19] anticipation upon our hearts, Father.
[15:22] Lord, for what you would do even this
[15:24] morning in the very sanctuary of your
[15:26] people, Lord, we've come to a safe
[15:29] place, Father. Lord, we know in the Old
[15:32] Testament that where one would have
[15:34] found a fault with another, Lord, there
[15:36] was a place where they could go and
[15:38] hide. Lord, they could go and bear up
[15:41] their petitions before the judge, the
[15:44] high priest. Lord, we come this morning,
[15:46] Lord, knowing that we have found that
[15:49] sanctuary, that haven of rest this
[15:51] morning. Father, we plead the blood of
[15:54] Jesus Christ this morning, Lord, for
[15:57] these needs that we have read out before
[15:59] you, Father. Surely they were penned
[16:02] down in faith, believing that there
[16:04] would be a body of people that would
[16:05] pray over them, Lord. That hands would
[16:08] be raised, that mouths would be opened,
[16:12] that hearts would be believing this
[16:14] morning, that you, the great God of
[16:16] glory, would look down through the blood
[16:19] of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary
[16:22] that is sufficient for us this morning.
[16:25] that you would have mercy and your grace
[16:28] would be extended once again to a
[16:31] believer in need. Oh God, Lord, we are
[16:35] asking for thine divine will and way in
[16:38] our presence, Lord. Lord, even this
[16:41] morning we think of our pastor, Lord.
[16:45] Lord, surely there is a great burden
[16:47] upon his heart, Lord, for the lost in
[16:50] the many years that he has labored over
[16:52] this pulpit. the many seats that have
[16:56] been filled in this sanctuary
[17:00] this morning. Lord, would you deliver
[17:02] the bound?
[17:04] Would you free, Lord, those that would
[17:06] be in prison this morning? Would you
[17:09] lift up the brokenhearted this morning,
[17:11] Father? Would you raise our eyes, oh
[17:14] God, above the realm of these three
[17:17] dimensions that we're in, Lord? And may
[17:19] we cast our eyes
[17:22] &gt;&gt; into that unseen dimension.
[17:26] We love you this morning, Father.
[17:30] Oh, there's a joy in our hearts, Lord,
[17:32] for what we know that you are doing even
[17:35] now, Lord. Lord, where you are breaking
[17:37] us out of this realm of these
[17:41] tempestuous times that we find ourselves
[17:44] locked in. Lord, Lord, our eyes are
[17:46] being lifted up. Our spirits are being
[17:48] lifted up into heavenly places in Christ
[17:51] Jesus.
[17:53] Oh, Father, do the unexpected this
[17:56] morning.
[17:57] Lord, each and every one of us, Father,
[18:00] have a great need of a closer walk with
[18:02] you.
[18:04] Truly, it's the desire of our hearts,
[18:06] Lord, to leave this world far behind us,
[18:11] to come into your courts, Lord, to never
[18:14] depart again.
[18:16] Lord, may we walk in the reality of that
[18:19] this morning. We give you praise, Lord,
[18:22] for the baptism that we had on Wednesday
[18:25] night, Father. Lord, for the baptisms
[18:28] that are surely coming today, Lord.
[18:32] Lord, we know that you are still moving,
[18:34] Father. Lord, there is still blood on
[18:36] the mercy seat for one more to come in,
[18:39] Father. Lord, we want to press into that
[18:42] mark of the high calling. We love you,
[18:45] Father. We truly want to give you the
[18:47] praise and the honor and the glory.
[18:51] Be mindful of each and every need this
[18:53] morning, Father.
[18:56] We thank you for being mindful of us,
[18:58] Lord.
[19:01] We commit this time to you now in the
[19:04] name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ
[19:06] we pray. Amen. And amen.
[19:11] Hallelujah.
[19:13] Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's truly wonderful to us, isn't
[19:17] he? Amen. You may have your seats.
[19:20] We want to welcome all of those that are
[19:23] on the internet hookup with us this
[19:25] morning and on a telephone hookup and
[19:28] those that may see the service in the
[19:30] coming days ahead. We pray that this
[19:33] would be a blessed time
[19:35] &gt;&gt; for you.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. As it's going to be a blessed time
[19:38] for us. But the Lord is the same
[19:40] yesterday,
[19:41] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the I am."
[19:45] &gt;&gt; So that means what's good for right now
[19:47] is good for tomorrow. See, you could be
[19:50] joining the service a week from today
[19:52] and it's just as applicable
[19:54] &gt;&gt; as it is right now.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a special this morning.
[20:00] Um, so if the group will come that's
[20:02] going to be singing for us, we'd
[20:04] certainly appreciate that. We do have
[20:06] one announcement to let you know about.
[20:08] The choir will not have a practice today
[20:11] between services, so you can go and
[20:13] enjoy your full lunch break. How many
[20:16] would love to just stay in the presence
[20:18] of the Lord,
[20:20] ask the Lord to take away our appetites
[20:22] and dismiss us from actually having to
[20:24] hang on to this coat of flesh that we
[20:26] have and maybe just spend a whole day in
[20:28] his presence. Wouldn't that be
[20:29] wonderful?
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we're speaking it, so
[20:32] it's going to have to come into reality.
[20:35] We may have to get disappointed and not
[20:37] enjoy it today, but I believe there will
[20:39] be a time
[20:40] &gt;&gt; when that's what we'll get to enjoy.
[20:43] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[21:10] [Music]
[21:15] His
[21:18] [Music]
[21:40] heart was broken.
[21:42] Mine was mended.
[21:48] He became sin. Now I am clean.
[21:57] The cross he carried
[21:59] bore my burden.
[22:05] The nails that held him set me free.
[22:10] His
[22:12] life for mine.
[22:16] His life for mine.
[22:20] [Music]
[22:21] How could it ever
[22:25] be
[22:28] that he would die?
[22:32] God's son would die
[22:37] [Music]
[22:38] to save
[22:40] a rich like me.
[22:45] What love divine. He gave his life
[22:50] for mine.
[22:52] [Music]
[22:55] His scars of suffering brought me
[22:59] healing.
[23:03] He spilled his blood to fill my soul.
[23:11] His crown of thorns made me royalty.
[23:18] His
[23:20] sorrow gave me joy and told
[23:25] his life for mine.
[23:29] His life for mine.
[23:35] How could it ever
[23:39] be
[23:41] that he would die?
[23:45] God's son would die
[23:50] to save
[23:52] a rich like
[23:57] what love divine. He gave his life
[24:02] for
[24:05] he was despised and rejected
[24:10] stripped off his garment and oppressed.
[24:14] I am love and accepted
[24:18] and I will
[24:24] his life for
[24:28] his life for
[24:32] [Music]
[24:34] how
[24:35] it
[24:37] be
[24:40] that he would
[24:44] God s
[24:47] [Music]
[24:49] to save
[24:51] our rich like
[24:59] what love divine he gave his life
[25:07] for
[25:16] [Music]
[25:26] Amen.
[25:28] What do we have?
[25:37] Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that special.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; He died for me. I don't know if we know
[25:44] that song.
[25:46] Why don't we sing? He play We Place You
[25:47] in the Highest Place. We invite Brother
[25:49] Ed to come this morning. Take his
[25:51] liberty. Amen. We have the whole day.

[28:13] Let's all stand this morning and raise
[28:15] it as an end of now.

[28:23] in the highest place.
[28:28] [Applause]
[28:30] You
[28:35] [Applause]

[29:04] Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't he marvelous?
[29:11] Hallelujah.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; How wonderful you are, Lord.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Worthy of all of our praise.
[29:26] [Music]
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Worthy. Worthy of all of our praise.
[29:33] [Music]
[29:35] Hallelujah.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[29:40] &gt;&gt; how privileged we are to come into his
[29:43] presence.
[29:45] [Music]
[29:46] &gt;&gt; He must have something special in store
[29:48] for you.
[29:50] We just open our hearts now.
[29:54] Say, "Here I am, Lord.
[29:57] Just before coming out, I thought, oh
[29:59] God, how great you are.
[30:02] I'm overwhelmed with your greatness
[30:05] and I'm overwhelmed with my
[30:07] insignificance.
[30:09] To think that God could send this little
[30:12] speck of dust called the earth out into
[30:14] the great great universe.
[30:17] And I try to capture in my mind
[30:21] this little piece of nothing that we're
[30:24] standing on. And then who are we?
[30:27] We're just a just a speck on the earth.
[30:32] And how the prophet would say we're
[30:34] walking and treading on the brittle
[30:36] threads of life. Oh God, how great thou
[30:40] art. And to think that he would accept
[30:43] praise from us today. He could have
[30:46] created beings that had never known any
[30:49] darkness,
[30:50] never known the depths of sin and
[30:53] unbelief and hard hearts and stiff necks
[30:57] and a wayward people. He could have
[30:59] created a people that would have just
[31:02] praised him forever. But then he would
[31:04] never been known as a savior and he just
[31:06] had such a such a desire within himself.
[31:11] I must be known as a savior, a redeemer.
[31:14] How great
[31:15] &gt;&gt; to pick up sinners like us.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how great he is.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; When we're overwhelmed with our
[31:23] insignificance and we're overwhelmed
[31:25] with our weakness and our frailties, we
[31:27] think how great thou art that you could
[31:31] I thought of that old song. We're not
[31:33] going to sing it, but that God should
[31:36] love a sinner such as I.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let my lips ever be ready to
[31:44] praise his name and magnify him. Mighty
[31:48] deliverer.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[31:53] We're real thankful.
[31:56] Uh thanking him for what he's doing each
[31:59] day.
[32:01] I know many of you in the church prayed
[32:03] for Sister Amanda Snow.
[32:08] And I don't know is uh Brother Randy,
[32:11] Sister Lori here.
[32:13] I see you back there.
[32:19] All right.
[32:21] I just thought it was just really
[32:23] marvelous. I don't have the email right
[32:26] here, but Sister Amanda
[32:29] had a growth on her hand.
[32:32] And many of you don't know, but Sister
[32:34] Amanda came through leukemia.
[32:37] and then and then uh
[32:40] been free from that and ended up with
[32:43] this growth on their hand going down to
[32:47] Seattle to the best specialist
[32:50] and they've examined it. They want to
[32:51] remove it
[32:54] and so they did remove it. When they
[32:57] removed it, the specialist said
[33:02] he was troubled, perplexed. He said, "We
[33:04] must examine this immediately. going to
[33:07] send it for a biopsy immediately. It I'm
[33:10] very suspicious, he said. Very
[33:12] suspicious.
[33:14] He said, "It's not leukemia
[33:17] and it's not Hodkins, but I'm very
[33:20] suspicious and so I want you back right
[33:23] away." and they sent the
[33:26] uh what they removed to the pathologist
[33:31] and we had prayed and sister Lori and
[33:34] brother Randy and we'd prayed together
[33:39] and they had said we're just going to
[33:40] believe that the doctors will be baffled
[33:42] and that stuck in my heart and so then I
[33:45] made that part of my prayer
[33:48] let them be baffled
[33:50] so they when they said well we don't
[33:52] know what it is but we're very
[33:54] suspicious
[33:55] and they called and they said we're the
[33:59] specialist called brother Randy Sister
[34:02] Lori and said that uh the pathologist
[34:07] has gotten back to her and said I
[34:09] haven't got time to uh time yet to write
[34:12] you the full pathology report but you
[34:16] free to call the Snow family and tell
[34:18] them that it's completely benign.
[34:21] There's nothing there. I say they were
[34:24] baffled and we are amazed
[34:28] &gt;&gt; at God's goodness and his greatness
[34:31] to us.
[34:34] We were saddened this last week and and
[34:37] also shocked to hear that our brother
[34:40] Wolf Ram Hornshade
[34:42] from uh Narramata lost his life.
[34:47] Uh,
[34:49] apparently it's in the newspaper also
[34:52] the province, but he was on his quad and
[34:54] we do not know what happened,
[34:57] but
[34:59] he something they said his quad turned
[35:01] over and uh, Brother Hornshade,
[35:06] he lost his life in that accident and a
[35:08] hiker found him. Apparently it happened
[35:11] on Wednesday
[35:13] and his daughter Claudia from who lives
[35:17] in Germany. She's the last remaining
[35:20] child. They had one other daughter who
[35:22] lost her life also when she was a young
[35:24] girl. And Claudia remains Claudia was
[35:28] here just last year when brother Tomok
[35:32] service for her mother and brother Wolf
[35:36] Ram's wife. And so she has just arrived,
[35:40] I believe, last night and now is is uh
[35:43] making her way to Narramata.
[35:45] And we will be
[35:47] making an announcement as soon as we
[35:50] have the information of where a service
[35:52] may be and what time it is. Um, I think
[35:57] that we as a congregation
[35:59] that was our sister or our daughter,
[36:01] whatever, she's we know nothing of her
[36:04] spiritual state and that's irrelevant
[36:07] right now. We pray that God will be with
[36:10] her and speak to her and I want to have
[36:13] that prayer for Sister Claudia,
[36:15] the group that sang he gave his life for
[36:19] mine. I really appreciated that
[36:22] &gt;&gt; and we're here and God gave his life for
[36:25] her as well
[36:27] &gt;&gt; and we're
[36:29] we're thankful for those of you that had
[36:32] an opportunity in the last few weeks.
[36:34] Brother Wolf Ram was able to be here and
[36:37] mingle with you and have visit with
[36:40] quite a number of people and now he has
[36:43] crossed over
[36:45] and uh so we want to pray for Claudia as
[36:48] well and give thanks for Amanda.
[36:52] We're going to be coming to the word
[36:54] right away. If you would bow with me, I
[36:57] would like to join with you in prayer.
[37:01] our almighty God and father
[37:05] who sent forth Jesus Christ as a
[37:08] redeemer for us. And oh, how we needed
[37:12] him. Oh, how I needed him, Lord. If no
[37:16] one else needed him, how I needed you.
[37:19] And I'm so thankful you remembered us,
[37:21] Lord, and remembered me in our need,
[37:23] Lord, and my need. Lord, I sense uh just
[37:28] a spirit of thankfulness within the
[37:31] people. A holy presence and a holy hush
[37:37] has has hovered over the people. And
[37:41] this presence, your presence seems now
[37:43] to be penetrating us. And we are here,
[37:47] oh God, in your presence, not knowing
[37:50] just exactly what you would do
[37:53] throughout this day. But we want to say
[37:56] we are here and we are prepared to hear
[37:59] your words. We have come as our brother
[38:02] Derek has led us in worship and truly
[38:05] are not only our lips Lord but in our
[38:09] hearts and souls. There is a rising tide
[38:13] of thanksgiving to the almighty God that
[38:17] you have taken us from where we were in
[38:21] such darkness and shadows and chains.
[38:25] And Lord, while I pray, there may still
[38:28] be someone here today, someone on the
[38:31] internet, in their room, or wherever
[38:33] they may be gathered.
[38:36] And there may be there, Lord, with
[38:38] confusion in a state of mind and
[38:41] turmoil, oh God. And someone here may
[38:45] have changed yet around them and bound.
[38:48] We want to announce to them, oh God,
[38:51] that in the name of Jesus Christ, you
[38:54] were you came into the world to not only
[38:57] redeem but to deliver. And we announce,
[39:00] oh God, that Satan is defeated.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And the serpent's head has been crushed.
[39:06] And the Son of Man has been revealed.
[39:10] And the word has been declared and made
[39:12] open. Lord, we thank you for these
[39:15] things. And now, Lord, we stand here in
[39:18] your presence at our post of duty.
[39:22] I want to thank you for what you're
[39:23] doing. And now, anoint us, oh God.
[39:27] Anoint the people to hear. Anoint me to
[39:29] speak and be with us throughout this day
[39:33] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:40] God bless you. You may take your Bibles
[39:42] if you would please. And I'll have you
[39:44] turn to John's Gospel the third chapter.
[39:48] And we're having baptismal
[39:50] right after the service.
[39:53] Right after the preaching, I should say,
[39:54] not after the service. Part of the
[39:56] service.
[39:58] I tell you, I'm rejoicing.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Over this baptismal we're having today.
[40:04] I'm so rejoicing, I'm going to do it
[40:05] myself.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; We often have some of the other brothers
[40:11] and do the baptism. Brother Tom does a
[40:15] lot of it.
[40:17] So, we want to get directly to the word.
[40:21] John in the third chapter, we'll start
[40:23] to read it. Verse 25.
[40:27] Then there arose a question between some
[40:30] of John's disciples and the Jews about
[40:33] purifying.
[40:35] And they came unto John, and said unto
[40:37] him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond
[40:40] Jordan, to whom thou beest witness,
[40:42] behold, the same baptizeth, and all men
[40:46] come to him.
[40:49] And John answered and said, "A man can
[40:53] receive nothing except it be given him
[40:55] from heaven.
[40:56] Ye yourselves bear witness
[40:59] that I said, I am not the Christ, but
[41:03] that I am sent before him.
[41:06] He that hath the bride is the
[41:07] bridegroom, but the friend of the
[41:10] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[41:12] him rejoicth greatly because of the
[41:15] bridegroom's voice. This my joy
[41:18] therefore is fulfilled.
[41:22] He must increase but I must decrease.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; And we'll cease reading there. God bless
[41:29] you as you have your seats. Thank you
[41:31] for standing.
[41:39] That is my
[41:42] title to the message.
[41:44] He must increase.
[41:49] You can think about that.
[41:52] He must increase.
[41:54] Now increase
[41:58] is a law of the earth.
[42:01] Increase is an essential part
[42:05] of even our human nature
[42:09] and man's nature.
[42:12] Increase is a law that's in the seed.
[42:17] For God spoke those words that the the
[42:20] life would be in the seed
[42:23] and the seeds were planted in Genesis.
[42:28] We can find all the seeds
[42:31] of everything that you see today. And I
[42:33] believe that we are in a harvest period.
[42:37] We're in a harvest period.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; And we're seeing a lot of things today.
[42:43] And if you look back, they're actually
[42:44] planted in in Genesis.
[42:48] In the creation, God commanded the earth
[42:51] to bring forth.
[42:54] And he said, "Let the earth bring forth
[42:57] grass and the herb yielding seed, and
[43:00] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[43:04] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[43:07] earth." And it was so. It's going to
[43:11] happen.
[43:13] He must increase.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; You might say, well, I feel weak and I
[43:19] feel a failure and I feel this. That's
[43:22] irrelevant.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; What what cannot fail is this word.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; It cannot fail. What God has spoken will
[43:33] happen,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; will take place.
[43:36] It will bring forth. And he said, "Let
[43:38] the earth bring forth." And the Hebrew
[43:41] here for this instance is let it sprout.
[43:46] Let it cause to shoot forth. Let it
[43:49] grow. Let it bring forth.
[43:52] And then when God spoke to Adam,
[43:56] he said, "And God blessed them."
[43:59] And this is Genesis 1:22. Eve has not
[44:02] come forth yet, but it says that God
[44:06] blessed them,
[44:08] saying, "Be fruitful and multiply
[44:13] and
[44:15] uh I'm sorry, uh John 1:22, he's
[44:19] speaking to the waters and fill the
[44:21] waters, fill the waters in the seas, and
[44:23] let fowl multiply in the earth." And
[44:26] that was so. and this time be fruitful
[44:30] to bear and to branch off.
[44:35] And I'll read the I'll read the
[44:37] scripture that I want to read now in in
[44:39] uh Genesis 1 and also 26.
[44:48] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[44:50] image, after our likeness, and let them
[44:51] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[44:53] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[44:55] the cattle, and over all the earth, and
[44:58] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[45:00] upon the earth." So God created man in
[45:03] his own image, and the image of God
[45:05] created he them. Male and female created
[45:07] he them. And God blessed them and said
[45:10] unto them, "Be fruitful,
[45:13] and multiply, and replenish the earth,
[45:16] and subdue it, and have dominion over
[45:18] the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
[45:20] of the air, and over every living thing
[45:22] that moveth upon the earth." And this
[45:25] multiply is now to become great,
[45:30] become many,
[45:32] become numerous,
[45:34] to make and enlarge and increase and
[45:38] increase greatly, increase exceedingly
[45:42] multiply.
[45:44] And we know that after the fall, then
[45:46] God addressed Eve.
[45:50] And he said unto the woman,
[45:53] I will greatly multiply
[45:56] thy sorrow and thy conception,
[45:59] and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth.
[46:02] Jesus said the time would come when they
[46:04] would even say, "Blessed are the paps
[46:06] that have not given suck, and the wombs
[46:08] that have not bear."
[46:11] that time would come.
[46:16] I present to you an article
[46:20] and this is from the United Nations I
[46:22] believe statistics.
[46:25] It has just taken 12 years
[46:29] for the world to add this most recent
[46:32] billion people.
[46:35] 12 years.
[46:37] This is the shortest time in world
[46:39] history for a billion people to be
[46:43] added.
[46:44] The United Nations estimated that the
[46:47] world reached the 6 billion mark on
[46:49] October the 12th, 1999.
[46:54] And it was a historic milestone
[46:57] in the growth of the world population.
[47:00] That was a milestone. I have a reason
[47:02] for it. The marking of a world at six
[47:06] billion just at the dawn of a new
[47:09] millennium is a convergence of events
[47:12] that is attracting widespread
[47:14] world attention.
[47:16] During this century, the world increased
[47:20] 1.65
[47:22] billion people in just this century.
[47:27] I can I can tell you there's been a vast
[47:29] multiplication.
[47:31] And I took I won't go into it now but I
[47:34] took the population from 1900 just in
[47:38] this last century and the population the
[47:41] increase and it was very very dramatic.
[47:44] December the 30th, 205, the US Census
[47:47] Bureau projected
[47:49] the January 1, 206 population of United
[47:53] States will be 297,821,120
[48:00] 175 and that is up 2,713,000
[48:07] and so on percent from New Year's Day
[48:10] 205. That's been the kind of increase.
[48:13] In January, the United States is
[48:15] expected to register one birth every 8
[48:17] seconds and one death every 12 seconds.
[48:22] And meanwhile, the net international
[48:24] migration is expected to add one person
[48:27] every 31 seconds. The result is an
[48:31] increase in the total population of one
[48:34] person every 14 seconds in the United
[48:38] States. So every 14 seconds from the
[48:41] time we start this service to the time
[48:43] we end this meeting there will be quite
[48:46] a net increase in the population of
[48:51] United States. And of course that
[48:53] doesn't say anything for the rest of the
[48:55] world.
[48:57] This is a time of increase.
[49:01] It is a time of harvest. And the Bible
[49:03] speaks frequently about the end times,
[49:08] the last days, and many different types
[49:11] of references to this time that we're
[49:14] in, and that things would increase.
[49:19] And I'm I want to think about that
[49:21] increase because I'm not just talking
[49:22] about population. Far be it today.
[49:26] With the increase of mankind,
[49:30] so does everything that man brings with
[49:33] him increases.
[49:38] Sin,
[49:40] sickness,
[49:42] disease, greed,
[49:45] hatred, war,
[49:47] fightings, violence,
[49:51] crime, lust,
[49:53] and on and on. And if man multiplies
[49:57] and populations multiply, it only stands
[50:01] to reason it all multiplies.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; And another thing of course we have
[50:08] today is we have instantaneous media.
[50:11] It happens across the continents and
[50:15] across the seas and we hear about it in
[50:17] seconds.
[50:20] So our so those that perhaps even are
[50:24] not involved, those that are believers,
[50:25] a believer who does not feel at home in
[50:28] this world is bombarded from every
[50:31] direction
[50:33] &gt;&gt; by word of mouth or by telephone and by
[50:35] radio or by media or by your computer
[50:38] and the internet and whatever more. It's
[50:40] just bombarded from every direction. And
[50:42] we can't say it doesn't have an effect
[50:44] because it does have an effect
[50:47] &gt;&gt; and we're living in a harvest time.
[50:49] There's no one else in the history of
[50:52] mankind from Adam and Eve who walked in
[50:56] the garden. No one has had to face what
[51:00] we are facing today. And it's a reality.
[51:04] It's a real world. That's where we live.
[51:07] And these are the conditions. And I felt
[51:09] I needed to say to the congregation,
[51:13] and I probably can't say it all now, but
[51:16] these things are going to increase
[51:20] even beyond today.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; These conditions are going to increase.
[51:29] Now,
[51:32] even in the perfection of Eden, as it
[51:34] was, the serpent, that cunning
[51:38] beast
[51:39] who was inspired and taken control of by
[51:42] Satan himself, who'd been cast from
[51:45] heaven to the earth after war there, and
[51:48] now he's in the earth. He has the
[51:50] audacity to say to Eve in that
[51:52] perfection,
[51:56] you've been given a commandment to
[51:58] multiply, but I can show you how
[52:02] I can tell you what to do with this
[52:04] seed.
[52:06] He said the serpent and the serpent
[52:08] seed, the serpent was twice as smart.
[52:10] Now there she is in that perfection. But
[52:13] he is he is going to instruct her how
[52:17] she can increase her knowledge.
[52:22] And he says the serpent was twice as
[52:24] smart.
[52:26] His seed has always been twice as smart.
[52:30] And today where is your great
[52:33] intellectuals? Your pastor that's gone
[52:36] down and got a lot of intellectual
[52:38] knowledge and he stands up. He's the
[52:40] pastor of the biggest churches there is
[52:42] in the country and so forth like that.
[52:45] Where does the seed of the serpent
[52:47] staying at? Where are they staying at?
[52:50] He said in the smart and intelligent
[52:52] places like that, smart, shrewd
[52:55] scholars. He says there's where he's at.
[52:58] There's where he lays. Not by power, not
[53:01] by might, but by my spirit, sayith the
[53:03] Lord. And in Satan's Eden, he goes on,
[53:07] "Whatever he said would take place, he
[53:10] said it would happen in these last days
[53:12] that he would do certain things and he
[53:15] done it. He has to he has to ask nobody
[53:20] whether it's time or not." He knows what
[53:23] the time is and what the plan is. God
[53:25] knows what the time is, what the plan
[53:27] is. He says, "Now Satan, this deceiver,
[53:30] as spoke of in Matthew 24:24,
[53:35] with so much deceit, and now we find
[53:39] that by his gospel program of knowledge
[53:43] and better education, whose gospel? The
[53:46] Satan's gospel program
[53:49] with more knowledge and better education
[53:52] and higher ethics and civilization and
[53:54] so forth has bewitched the people that
[53:58] wants to serve God. He's bewitched the
[54:01] people who wants to serve God into
[54:03] believing his lie.
[54:06] Eve did not want to do that, but he
[54:09] showed her how it was more wisdom in it.
[54:15] They had been told, "Multiply and bring
[54:19] forth."
[54:22] And he's going to show her where there's
[54:24] more wisdom. He says, "Listen closely
[54:26] now." She didn't know. She didn't know
[54:28] what he was going to tell her. She
[54:30] didn't know, but she wanted to know. She
[54:33] didn't understand, but she wanted to
[54:36] understand. And God told her not to try
[54:38] to understand. How can I understand any
[54:41] of these things? I cannot understand
[54:43] them. I believe them. I don't have to
[54:45] understand them. God is faith not
[54:47] understanding.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; He said we just believe what he said.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; I want to say one of the greatest
[54:56] travesties
[54:59] against mankind that Satan has
[55:01] perpetrated upon the earth
[55:05] is that he has taken this seed. You have
[55:09] to wait and sit quiet now. He's a
[55:11] listen. He has taken this seed to show
[55:16] the church, the woman that how she can
[55:21] and how he can give her more wisdom
[55:24] by handling this seed and how it can be
[55:28] done in a better way and has brought
[55:31] upon the earth. Well, brother Brandham
[55:34] talked about denominationalism for I
[55:37] mean the the church world.
[55:40] I trust that everyone on the internet
[55:42] understands
[55:44] religion is one of the greatest curses
[55:48] &gt;&gt; that has ever befell humanity.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Wars come out of religion.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Wars are fought regularly
[55:59] and they're religious wars
[56:03] &gt;&gt; and Satan has done it.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; And what is the whole religious system
[56:07] all based on? They would say they would
[56:10] all take the Bible in hand. But it is
[56:13] the same serpent from Eden that is taken
[56:16] now not the seed of the serpent but this
[56:19] seed to pervert it
[56:22] &gt;&gt; and cause the people to believe a lie
[56:25] &gt;&gt; and be damned by it.
[56:35] I would say that
[56:38] the religious world as a whole is
[56:41] responsible for terrible crimes against
[56:45] humanity.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; The religious wars are of the worst
[56:51] kind.
[56:53] And unto the woman he said, I will
[56:56] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[56:58] conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring
[57:00] forth children, and thy desire shall be
[57:03] to thy husband, and he shall rule over
[57:06] thee. He said, you will bring forth
[57:08] children. You will bear, bring forth,
[57:11] you will beg, you'll travail of
[57:14] childbirth. It speaks of that.
[57:18] Now the scripture text which I took
[57:21] just hold those things which we've said
[57:23] thus far.
[57:25] He must increase.
[57:28] And John says and I must decrease.
[57:32] He must increase. He must augment. He
[57:35] must become greater. He must he must
[57:38] grow in quantity and in number. Now the
[57:41] bride will be very very few. But in uh
[57:45] if we think of the uh entire scope of
[57:48] the population of the earth, it will be
[57:51] very very few. And you know, I just want
[57:55] to say something to you as believers
[57:58] and perhaps I'd like to speak on this
[58:00] one day. I I'm I feel
[58:04] drawn to do so and with the Lord to give
[58:07] me a release to do so. But you know as
[58:10] as believers
[58:14] uh we may go into a place like it was
[58:16] just down in Phoenix and you go to
[58:17] Tucson and wherever so on. You go
[58:20] overseas in Africa or wherever and say
[58:23] well these folks believe this and these
[58:24] believe that and so on and so forth.
[58:28] But you know, if you took the message
[58:31] and what the and what God actually made
[58:35] revealed and made open in the message,
[58:40] the Godhead has never been understood
[58:43] like the prophet declared it. And if you
[58:45] just said to believers everywhere, how
[58:48] do you see the Godhead? They say it's
[58:50] like the prophet of God brought it.
[58:53] the serpent seed, the baptism,
[58:57] the the the church not going through the
[59:00] tribulation, the rapture, and you take
[59:03] all these major doctrines and you could
[59:07] take and overlay that over I would say
[59:10] probably 99% of the believers and they
[59:13] would say that's what we believe
[59:16] and that's really what we need to say.
[59:19] And some say, well, how's he going to
[59:21] come? Or when's he going to come? Or,
[59:23] you know, how many angels can stand on
[59:25] the head of a pin? And uh, you know, is
[59:27] it in a cloud or is it on a white horse?
[59:29] Or is it this or is we all have our
[59:32] ideas and we all have thoughts about
[59:34] questions which he didn't declare. And
[59:37] then some want to take their own
[59:38] personal little thoughts and make a
[59:40] doctrine on it. And and uh and then the
[59:43] thing finally fritters out and dies. and
[59:45] and uh and and I can I can say it very
[59:48] very clearly many of those things are
[59:50] actually built around a man
[59:55] &gt;&gt; and eventually it passes off the scene
[59:58] because it isn't something that actually
[1:00:00] came as a revelation from the message
[1:00:03] itself. It was a personal idea, a
[1:00:05] personal thought and it was presented
[1:00:07] maybe in a very very powerful way and
[1:00:09] and there are men that got powerful
[1:00:11] ministries and whatever more. But when
[1:00:13] that is all gone and I want you to think
[1:00:16] about something prophet of God said when
[1:00:19] Moses went in behind the veil and got
[1:00:22] the word he said no other person. He
[1:00:25] said Moses and Moses alone to try to go
[1:00:28] back and get that. And what's he doing?
[1:00:31] getting the revelation and bringing it
[1:00:34] out to the people. He said, "And there
[1:00:36] was no one else could go. The prophet
[1:00:39] and the prophet alone was the one that
[1:00:40] could go and get it and bring it out and
[1:00:43] anyone else try to go back and say, I
[1:00:45] got something. I got something."
[1:00:48] The penalty was death. It just it thing
[1:00:50] died out. I'm sorry folks, but it has
[1:00:53] all kinds of things died out. Amen.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; I get sometimes email as I did this last
[1:00:59] week from over and says, "Oh, this
[1:01:01] certain doctrine is oh, it's just coming
[1:01:03] up over here." I said, "Just tell them
[1:01:05] we don't even hear it over here. That
[1:01:07] thing died 20 years ago." But they
[1:01:10] always try to find some new territory,
[1:01:11] you know, to get this going. And was it
[1:01:14] seven thunders? And I got to Africa,
[1:01:16] they said, "Is it we we got over here,
[1:01:18] we want to know, is it seven black
[1:01:20] thunders or is it seven white thunders?"
[1:01:22] Is isn't that something? And then all a
[1:01:26] lot of ministers got around and uh all
[1:01:28] our they were all black pastors in at
[1:01:31] Cape Town and asked me, you know, would
[1:01:33] would you come to a meeting? We want to,
[1:01:35] you know, ask you some questions and so
[1:01:36] on. And so we we sat down and those
[1:01:39] brothers, I love them. My goodness, we
[1:01:41] had so many meetings with them. And and
[1:01:44] they said, "We have a question." They
[1:01:45] said, "No."
[1:01:47] And they had just heard about some
[1:01:49] things. And so they said, "Brother
[1:01:52] Biscll," and they felt a little bit
[1:01:54] nervous, you know, they said, "Now
[1:01:57] about the seven thunders,
[1:02:00] like they were treading on some
[1:02:02] explosive ground."
[1:02:05] They said,
[1:02:07] "What what do you think about the seven
[1:02:09] thunders?" I said, "Well," I said,
[1:02:11] "Brother Brandham said what it was." He
[1:02:13] was asked that very question in the
[1:02:15] seals.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; They said, "What about the seven
[1:02:17] thunders?" And he said it is the that's
[1:02:20] what the seals were all about.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; It was the voices behind the seals. So I
[1:02:25] said next question.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Well, they thought this was going to be
[1:02:29] a discussion for the rest of the day. I
[1:02:32] was done. And when I just gave that
[1:02:34] answer, they were done. But they hadn't
[1:02:36] expected the meeting to end so quickly.
[1:02:39] You know, and people want to make, you
[1:02:40] know, this is something very special.
[1:02:42] And now we only have a very very few.
[1:02:44] just an elect. Out of the elect becomes
[1:02:46] they become the very elect. Who doesn't
[1:02:48] want to be very elect? I want to be very
[1:02:50] elect. We all want to be very elect. So
[1:02:52] suddenly we got now a little group
[1:02:53] within the group.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; But it's not it's not the doctrine of
[1:02:58] the message itself. You understand what
[1:03:00] I'm saying?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; That was just an option.
[1:03:11] He must increase. He must grow in
[1:03:15] quantity or number or supply or or
[1:03:18] multiply
[1:03:19] and to cause to grow or to cause to
[1:03:22] become greater. Now I want to go to a
[1:03:25] quote just out of the out of the uh
[1:03:30] Leodysian church age message.
[1:03:34] Brother Brandham said
[1:03:37] based on the seven visions which he had
[1:03:42] along with
[1:03:44] the rapid changes
[1:03:48] which have swept the world
[1:03:51] in the last day in the last 50 years. I
[1:03:53] predict I do not prophesy
[1:03:58] that these visions will have all come to
[1:04:01] pass by 1977.
[1:04:03] And though many feel that this is an
[1:04:06] irresponsible statement in view of the
[1:04:09] fact that Jesus said that no man knoweth
[1:04:11] the day nor the hour, I still maintain
[1:04:14] this prediction after 30 years because
[1:04:16] Jesus did not say no man could know
[1:04:19] could know the year or the month or week
[1:04:22] in which his coming was to be completed.
[1:04:26] So I repeat, I sincerely believe and
[1:04:29] maintain as a private student of the
[1:04:31] word along with divine inspiration that
[1:04:34] 1977
[1:04:36] ought to terminate the world systems and
[1:04:40] usher in the millennium.
[1:04:43] Now, now what he's talking about here is
[1:04:46] that God God's going to turn from the
[1:04:50] Gentiles and turn to the Jews. Now let's
[1:04:54] just take the flip side of the coin.
[1:04:55] Let's just go back for a moment. This is
[1:04:57] not the heart of my message at all, but
[1:05:01] I'm I I I gave this quote because he
[1:05:03] said along with the rapid changes. In
[1:05:06] other words, things are not only going
[1:05:09] to increase, but they're going to
[1:05:12] accelerate.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; So there's acceleration
[1:05:15] with the increase that is taking place.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; And so he said, now talking about 1977,
[1:05:22] the people in the world, they grab that
[1:05:24] right away. lay hold of that.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Well, 1977, nothing happened. I'll tell
[1:05:30] you what, there was prophecies that were
[1:05:32] fulfilled when uh the scripture speaks
[1:05:36] of when Jesus would come and Jesus took
[1:05:40] those prophecies out of Daniel, brought
[1:05:42] them forward. He said, "When you see the
[1:05:44] desolation
[1:05:46] uh that spoken of by Daniel a prophet,
[1:05:49] then uh don't go back and get your
[1:05:51] things and flee to the flee to the
[1:05:54] mountains." What was he talking? Do you
[1:05:56] think those people after after Jesus was
[1:06:00] was slain and raised and the disciples
[1:06:03] already were in the upper room and the
[1:06:06] Holy Spirit was poured out and all kinds
[1:06:08] of things were happening? That prophecy
[1:06:10] was done and finished.
[1:06:12] It was it is it was already spoken. And
[1:06:16] then in in 70 AD, here comes Titus and
[1:06:19] destroys Jerusalem. Do you think that do
[1:06:22] you think how many Jews do you think in
[1:06:24] Israel today or across the face of the
[1:06:26] earth that actually believe that was
[1:06:28] fulfilled? Not very many.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; They don't believe it was fulfilled, but
[1:06:32] it was absolutely com fulfilled. And he
[1:06:35] says, when you see that, when you see
[1:06:37] that happen, then you'll know these
[1:06:39] things have come to pass. and they did
[1:06:41] come to pass. But the Jews who it was
[1:06:44] actually spoken to do not regard that it
[1:06:47] has happened. And the world went on.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely were. And the key here, which
[1:06:54] many of you have heard me say it before,
[1:06:55] I'm going to say it again because there
[1:06:57] are many that are are probably new here
[1:06:58] and some that are listening.
[1:07:01] Brother Phantom says 1977 ought to he
[1:07:05] said I'm not prophesying but he says
[1:07:08] considering the rapid changes the
[1:07:10] acceleration that's taking place it
[1:07:13] ought to usher in and the word is usher
[1:07:18] in the millennium
[1:07:20] and an ushering in the millennium is
[1:07:23] ushering out the other age
[1:07:26] it's ushering out a gentile age ushering
[1:07:28] in the millennium them. I've had a lot
[1:07:31] of weddings. So, they'll say, "All
[1:07:34] right, uh, the bride is being ushered
[1:07:36] in. Where is she? Is she out in the
[1:07:38] parking lot just getting out of the car?
[1:07:41] Is she coming now with her attendance to
[1:07:44] the foyer of the church? Or is she in
[1:07:46] the foyer of the church? Where is she?
[1:07:48] Or is she at the door ready to come in?
[1:07:51] Where is it?" The ushering in is a
[1:07:53] process. And the prophet said it ought
[1:07:55] to usher in the millennium. And I would
[1:07:58] say with the messages which we've
[1:08:00] received and the and the word preached
[1:08:03] in its power, the bride is being ushered
[1:08:06] in
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; to the millennium.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; I believe that's happening.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I feel that's happening.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; I feel that it has been happening.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; If we're not being ushered into the
[1:08:21] millennium, friends, where are we being
[1:08:23] ushered into?
[1:08:27] Hallelujah.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Just one thing, the change of our
[1:08:31] bodies. And a lot of people, a lot of
[1:08:34] people believe in the change of the
[1:08:35] body, but they don't have the rest of
[1:08:38] the process. The rest of the process is
[1:08:41] that God would send a forerunner.
[1:08:44] Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:08:47] before the great and the terrible day of
[1:08:50] the Lord. The terrible day is his
[1:08:52] judgment day. Before the judgment day, a
[1:08:55] messenger will come. Restore the word
[1:08:57] back to the people. What for? To call a
[1:09:00] bride out. Come out from among her. Um
[1:09:03] come out from among them and be
[1:09:05] separate, said the Lord. And part of
[1:09:07] that calling part of that calling is a
[1:09:09] preparing of people for the change.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; People are expecting the change, but
[1:09:14] they're not they're not even they're not
[1:09:16] even willing to accept the preparation.
[1:09:20] How about the girl just say, "Well, you
[1:09:22] know, yeah, I'm uh I I've got the
[1:09:24] potentials to be a bride. Let me just
[1:09:26] walk in there." No, no. We want you to
[1:09:28] be ready. You need to get a dress. You
[1:09:30] need to get your hair fixed. We need to
[1:09:32] make some arrangements. We need to send
[1:09:34] out an invitation. We've got to get the
[1:09:36] people ready. You know, this is a big
[1:09:38] do.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; But a lot of them just want to go, "No,
[1:09:41] I just go in the way I am." you know,
[1:09:44] uh, you know, my preacher preaches
[1:09:45] something and I I I I believe it and we
[1:09:48] go to church for an hour and and we're
[1:09:50] all set. No, no, no, no, not at all.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Fact is, as as believers of this
[1:09:55] message, I think we need to hear a lot
[1:09:57] more word than we're even hearing now.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; The rapid changes
[1:10:05] in the last few days. Now, we're talking
[1:10:07] about the rapid changes.
[1:10:10] Don't get slack, friends. the rapid
[1:10:12] changes in the last few days of the life
[1:10:15] of Jesus Christ on earth. Brother
[1:10:17] Brandham says an inunement. Notice Jesus
[1:10:20] in the last hour or two of his life.
[1:10:24] Many many prophecies were fulfilled.
[1:10:26] Someone said to me, "Brother Brandham,
[1:10:29] this this has to happen and that has to
[1:10:31] happen." And I said, "It could happen in
[1:10:33] an hour."
[1:10:36] If you'll read the 22nd of Psalm and and
[1:10:40] then watch his dying hour of the cross,
[1:10:42] he said, "I forgot how many outstanding
[1:10:44] prophecies were fulfilled in the last
[1:10:47] two or three hours of his life. They
[1:10:49] pierced my hands and my feet. My God, my
[1:10:51] God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And so
[1:10:53] forth, David cried. Well, I I looked
[1:10:55] into it.
[1:10:57] There are 10 prophecies concerning the
[1:11:00] birth of Jesus. 10 prophecies of the Old
[1:11:03] Testament concerning the birth of Jesus
[1:11:06] that were fulfilled at the time of his
[1:11:08] birth. Nine prophecies concerning his
[1:11:12] nature.
[1:11:14] There are eight prophecies concerning
[1:11:17] his entire ministry
[1:11:19] from the Old Testament that were
[1:11:21] fulfilled in his entire ministry of
[1:11:23] three and a half years. There are 29
[1:11:27] prophecies that were fulfilled the day
[1:11:30] he died.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; What are we saying? There can be a few
[1:11:37] prophecies that are that have to do with
[1:11:39] us as a bride and as a believer as
[1:11:42] believers in this end time. There are
[1:11:44] some there's some prophecies concerning
[1:11:46] it. But the prophecies are things that
[1:11:48] people think need to be done could be
[1:11:50] done in just a few moments.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; In fact is between now and this
[1:11:58] evening's meeting it could all happen.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; We know nothing about it.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; We may not be aware of it happening. And
[1:12:06] there were those Jews and scholars of
[1:12:08] the word and men who had studied the
[1:12:11] Torah and men who that was their whole
[1:12:14] life from morning till night. And did
[1:12:16] they know it? Did they know it? They
[1:12:18] read the psalms. They sang the psalms.
[1:12:20] And the prophet said they were singing
[1:12:22] them in the temple when he was hanging
[1:12:24] on the cross.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; They were singing the prophecies and
[1:12:28] they were already being fulfilled one
[1:12:29] after the other just like a triphammer.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; And here they are waiting and they're
[1:12:35] still waiting.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later they're still waiting.
[1:12:38] And we can say, "I thought Elijah was
[1:12:41] supposed to come." Sorry, folks. That's
[1:12:43] already happened.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Already happened.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Elijah came. Elisha came. John the
[1:12:54] Baptist came. William Brandon came. It's
[1:12:56] the same identical spirit.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We didn't say he's going to forrun
[1:13:01] the second coming of Christ. The angel
[1:13:03] of the Lord said it.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; The voice spoke it. And those who were
[1:13:06] standing on the riverbank, they heard
[1:13:08] it.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; We don't have to declare it. We don't
[1:13:10] have to support it. Thus say the Lord.
[1:13:12] It has already happened.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And people waiting for Malachi 4, it's
[1:13:16] gone. Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It's passed off. It's gone into the
[1:13:20] eternities.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; So, well, it's going to happen and try
[1:13:26] to get, you know, and minutely dissect
[1:13:28] this and put this together in the 1977
[1:13:30] and all the rest of it. I tell you what,
[1:13:32] if a prophet with his record and
[1:13:35] speaking the truth and said, "I predict,
[1:13:38] I don't prophesy, I sooner go with his
[1:13:40] prediction than anybody else figuring
[1:13:41] out."
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then he said
[1:13:47] he said when there was a blackout on the
[1:13:49] west coast on the east coast rather and
[1:13:52] he said and there be more when was the
[1:13:54] next great one was the n July the
[1:13:56] seventh month the seventh day I believe
[1:13:59] it was of July at 1977
[1:14:02] the whole east coast blacked off
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; and his last message to New York was
[1:14:09] once more
[1:14:12] and the time magazine the time magazine
[1:14:14] Time
[1:14:16] magazine
[1:14:18] reports on the July
[1:14:21] and the front cover is the skyline just
[1:14:25] black because there's nothing there.
[1:14:28] There's not a light. The total skyline
[1:14:31] of New York City.
[1:14:33] And the that same prophet said there'll
[1:14:36] be insanity in the streets. And then
[1:14:39] they have a colored picture pasted in
[1:14:42] the middle of the hordes of people
[1:14:46] running like maniacs down the street and
[1:14:48] smashing the windows and and stealing
[1:14:51] all the stuff out of the stores and it's
[1:14:53] total chaos.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And the prophet and the people are in
[1:14:58] the meeting. He's preached to New York
[1:15:01] once more, Lord.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And when he left, he waved.
[1:15:07] It was a goodbye. That spirit of God
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; that was in him
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; knew that was it.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; What does the New York City know about
[1:15:19] that? Very little.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; But the believers of the message know a
[1:15:22] great deal about it.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; They catch a little glimpse here and
[1:15:25] catch a little glimpse there. And I say,
[1:15:28] "Thank God for the grace of God. Thank
[1:15:30] God for the vision that we do have. A
[1:15:33] lot of things maybe we don't know, but
[1:15:34] there's a lot, but we do know." Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And we know enough to be alert,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; to be on our toes, to be ready for we
[1:15:42] know not the hour. Hallelujah. That
[1:15:45] sweep come over and change the atoms of
[1:15:47] our bodies.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? I don't know
[1:15:51] and I don't care.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He said it and it will happen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Harvest time
[1:16:04] is a in gathering
[1:16:07] time and it's a separating time.
[1:16:12] Chaff from wheat.
[1:16:14] This is all an increase time
[1:16:18] and we have to expect those things.
[1:16:20] Harvest time is when everything that has
[1:16:24] been spoken of with the spoken word is
[1:16:27] in multiplied state.
[1:16:35] In other words,
[1:16:37] the words that were spoken have
[1:16:39] increased.
[1:16:40] And we could say that the word increased
[1:16:44] in its intensity
[1:16:47] in it in its speed, its acceleration.
[1:16:51] Say things are happening so fast today
[1:16:53] friends.
[1:16:55] I doubt if anybody would want to stand
[1:16:57] up here and say I can comprehend the
[1:16:59] speed of things that are happening and
[1:17:01] the technology. We are in the day of
[1:17:05] knowledge.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; It was Eve in the beginning.
[1:17:10] that first seed that that serpent
[1:17:14] offered to give her knowledge and what
[1:17:17] he gave her was carnal knowledge.
[1:17:20] And today we have knowledge.
[1:17:24] Look at the sex industry.
[1:17:27] Look at the sex industry.
[1:17:30] If you get down and it's too degraded to
[1:17:34] speak of over this pulpit,
[1:17:38] but being propagated, they just broke.
[1:17:42] My wife told me when they came back, she
[1:17:43] said, "They just broke some ring cuz I
[1:17:45] haven't heard it and I don't want to
[1:17:48] hear about it."
[1:17:50] But they this child pornography.
[1:17:55] I tell you what, the world is quickly
[1:17:58] getting ready for the burning
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and it deserves the burning.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We're sitting here protected, but these
[1:18:08] happen to be realities.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; This what taking place and my wife said
[1:18:14] this huge ring and people all over the
[1:18:17] world and a good part of it right in
[1:18:18] Canada, you know, our our fair cities
[1:18:21] and our church cities and our religious
[1:18:23] cities. kaibos
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; demonic.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And our young people, they're not immune
[1:18:33] or they're not ignorant of these things.
[1:18:35] They know these things happen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And even down to a child 18 months old.
[1:18:43] It's a good thing for that man that I'm
[1:18:46] not God
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; cuz he wouldn't have life
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; another second
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and he'd go off into some abyss of
[1:18:53] darkness
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; never to be found again.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; We haven't got we haven't got any
[1:18:59] patience for that kind of thing. But
[1:19:01] that's the world that that we're in. And
[1:19:03] things are intensifying and increasing.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; And yes, they find it behind the pulpit.
[1:19:10] They find it amongst the ministry and
[1:19:13] amongst the priesthood and all. And
[1:19:17] Satan knows no barriers. You're not
[1:19:18] afraid of those walls, not afraid of
[1:19:20] those doors, not afraid of anything, not
[1:19:23] afraid of your house.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; He'll invade anywhere.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the covering of the
[1:19:29] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:31] Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And that we can implement it and we can
[1:19:34] apply it and it's available to us and we
[1:19:37] should never never tire or become weary
[1:19:40] of saying thank God
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; for the word that we have received and
[1:19:44] for the protection that we have in this
[1:19:47] hour because these things are not going
[1:19:49] to diminish. You think the law is going
[1:19:51] to control them? Not a chance.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You think the police are going to
[1:19:55] control it or the government going to
[1:19:57] control it? Not a chance. and that
[1:20:00] serpent with his brazen uh uh spirit
[1:20:04] come in. If he'd come into the Eden and
[1:20:07] speak to the son of God and his wife and
[1:20:10] approach Eve, the very bride of the son
[1:20:13] of God, I tell you what, he knows no
[1:20:16] limits.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; The one that would say, "I will ascend
[1:20:20] to the throne of God." He knows no
[1:20:22] limits.
[1:20:25] And there's a people on the earth in the
[1:20:28] midst of this accelerated increase
[1:20:30] that's taking place. There's a people on
[1:20:33] the earth that's also been spoken by
[1:20:35] this messenger said that she will not be
[1:20:40] deceived.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And I don't just sit back and take that
[1:20:44] as some light statement. I say that
[1:20:46] there is there is a the effective there
[1:20:50] is a uh there is a quality there is a
[1:20:54] strength that I'm of I'm able as a
[1:20:56] believer and I have a right to to absorb
[1:21:00] that strength there's a washing of the
[1:21:03] water of the word and it is access I can
[1:21:06] access it
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; but if you just live a a lollipop life
[1:21:11] out there say I go to Cloverdale Bible I
[1:21:13] don't believe the man yeah send a
[1:21:15] prophet that won't protect you. But the
[1:21:18] word that was sent is effective and
[1:21:21] powerful and will save you from this
[1:21:24] untoward generation.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. You have to
[1:21:29] respect it. You have to apply it. You
[1:21:31] have to absorb it and let it permeate
[1:21:33] you. And it will do the work. The word
[1:21:36] will do the work. But you have to make
[1:21:38] yourself available.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And there are other things you can do
[1:21:41] and that is slam the door on the devil.
[1:21:44] The scripture says resist the devil.
[1:21:47] That is a permanent active word. Resist
[1:21:51] him. When now, five minutes from now, an
[1:21:54] hour from now, today, tomorrow, this
[1:21:57] week, next week, this year, next year,
[1:22:00] you resist him. You resist him. And God
[1:22:02] gives you the fortitude and the
[1:22:04] spiritual stamina.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; To resist him.
[1:22:12] But if you don't,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; he's got more ideas. He's a slicker.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; He knows your weak spot.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He knows how to creep in on you.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] and see the discrepancy.
[1:22:39] He said, "And we also know
[1:22:44] and we also know he interpreted in verse
[1:22:47] 36 to 43." He's referring to a scripture
[1:22:52] how that this seed matured.
[1:22:55] And while we're at it, let's just read
[1:22:57] it also. And he reads some scripture.
[1:22:59] And here's one of the scriptures.
[1:23:01] As therefore the tears are gathered and
[1:23:04] burned in the fire, so shall it be in
[1:23:09] the end of the world. The Son of Man
[1:23:14] shall send forth his angels, his
[1:23:17] messengers, and they shall gather out of
[1:23:20] his kingdom all things that offend, and
[1:23:23] them that which do iniquity,
[1:23:25] and shall cast them into a fire, a
[1:23:27] furnace of fire, and there shall be
[1:23:30] weeping and wailing and nashing of
[1:23:33] teeth. I just want to stop here. It's
[1:23:34] not part of my message as such, but I in
[1:23:37] my lifetime have heard people argue
[1:23:39] about whether God's going to send people
[1:23:41] into hell. And I've had people say,
[1:23:43] "God's not going to fry people and God's
[1:23:45] not going to send them into flames and
[1:23:47] God's not going to do this." And I've
[1:23:48] had others, you know, they say, "Well,
[1:23:49] hell is just uh uh hell is just uh you
[1:23:53] know, it's a place and they're going to
[1:23:55] it's not eternal." The prophet said it's
[1:23:56] not eternal. All I know is that's not
[1:23:59] all Jesus said. He said there will be
[1:24:02] weeping and wailing and nashing of
[1:24:06] teeth. He's not talking about a Sunday
[1:24:09] school picnic.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And then men get all down and start to,
[1:24:14] you know, get intricate with, you know,
[1:24:17] what hell is all about. All I can tell
[1:24:19] you, hell is not where you want to go.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; There is weeping out of the lips of
[1:24:26] Jesus. There is wailing. What is
[1:24:29] wailing? Wailing is when there's no
[1:24:31] words left.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; All the wailing can do is is is give
[1:24:37] vent and give voice and give a groaning
[1:24:41] unintelligible
[1:24:42] groaning for what an agony it's gone
[1:24:45] through that they've missed God. I can
[1:24:48] think of the weeping and wailing some of
[1:24:50] those people and probably most of them
[1:24:53] are going to remember. You know, I had
[1:24:55] an opportunity.
[1:24:57] God actually dealt with me. I heard a
[1:25:00] service. I was to a youth camp. I was
[1:25:04] someplace else. I had a mother or
[1:25:05] father. I had an uncle or a grandpa.
[1:25:08] Somebody told me and I did not take it.
[1:25:11] I sat in church and I didn't I didn't
[1:25:14] take it serious. And here I am. And
[1:25:17] there's weeping and wailing and nashing
[1:25:19] of teeth
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; cuz I had the opportunity. I say, God,
[1:25:25] drive it down in our hearts. Now, I'm
[1:25:27] preaching for all I can this morning.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; We're preaching to save souls
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; from that place.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. And there'll be people who sit back
[1:25:38] and say, "Well, I believe in
[1:25:39] predestination. I don't need that."
[1:25:42] Yeah. There's going to be people, I
[1:25:44] guarantee you, I guarantee you in the
[1:25:46] name of the Lord, there's going to be
[1:25:47] people who's going to be weeping and
[1:25:49] wailing and nashing of teeth. Who's
[1:25:52] going to said, "Well, you know, I what
[1:25:54] about predestination? And I thought
[1:25:56] about predestination.
[1:26:00] I said, "What happens about
[1:26:01] predestination?"
[1:26:03] All I know Jesus spent more time talking
[1:26:06] about hell than he talked about heaven.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; And he talked about hell. And if anybody
[1:26:11] knew anything about predestination,
[1:26:12] Jesus knew it better than anybody here
[1:26:14] or anybody under the sound of my voice
[1:26:16] or anybody who's ever come into the
[1:26:18] message, Jesus knew more about
[1:26:20] predestination.
[1:26:24] And we're supposed to live
[1:26:27] according to the mandate and the word
[1:26:30] that we hear
[1:26:33] now
[1:26:35] how I came upon these thoughts.
[1:26:39] Brother Bram talks about the seed of
[1:26:41] discrepancy and he says this
[1:26:46] Jesus give interpretation to the
[1:26:48] parable. says, "And then I believe that
[1:26:51] Jesus was speaking this parable in his
[1:26:53] day, but was meaning it to be at this
[1:26:57] end of the world or the end of the age,
[1:27:01] the end of the age."
[1:27:03] Here's Malachi 4 speaking now.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Which is this day?"
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hello, folks.
[1:27:12] You are living in the end of the age,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; the end time
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; when all the things that have been
[1:27:20] prophesied are coming upon the end. Is
[1:27:22] the clocks going to stop and everybody
[1:27:23] in the world and all the industry stop?
[1:27:25] No. It's going to carry right on.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; But the availability of mercy, the
[1:27:31] availability of the grace of God is not
[1:27:34] only going to diminish, it's going to be
[1:27:36] shut off.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; The tap is going to be shut off. God
[1:27:39] turned from the Jews. Do you think in
[1:27:42] the last two the two 2,000 years, do you
[1:27:45] think for a moment I would say the
[1:27:47] people that has probably done as a
[1:27:48] nation the most weeping and wailing and
[1:27:51] nashing of teeth has been the nation of
[1:27:54] Israel.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; They have suffered
[1:27:58] in in indescribable
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; things.
[1:28:03] Not only in one country, not only in the
[1:28:05] last war for 2,000 years they've
[1:28:07] suffered it. They've been scattered over
[1:28:09] the earth. They've been well, you know
[1:28:12] what has happened.
[1:28:17] And he said, "That's this day." And I
[1:28:20] believe that this little text tonight is
[1:28:23] very appropriate for the hour that we're
[1:28:25] living in because Jesus distinctly said
[1:28:29] here that the gathering would be at the
[1:28:32] end of this world. And that's when the
[1:28:34] end would be the gathering of the wheat
[1:28:37] and also the gathering of the tears for
[1:28:40] the burning. And you that are seated
[1:28:43] here, even if you're younger, you are
[1:28:46] actually living
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; when that gathering is taking place and
[1:28:51] has taken place.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And the great organizations have been
[1:28:54] gathered together, gathered for a
[1:28:57] burning.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Someone might say, "What is the
[1:29:01] burning?" I don't know and I don't care.
[1:29:03] I don't want to be in it.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; We don't have to get down and get, you
[1:29:06] know, finickity about what does this
[1:29:08] mean and what does that mean. It's very
[1:29:10] clear. It's something to be away from.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with it.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; The seed of discrepancy. And he goes on
[1:29:21] to say, he says the seed of discrepancy
[1:29:23] because that's something that multiplies
[1:29:25] in the end time.
[1:29:28] Jesus said that the two would be so
[1:29:31] close together till it would deceive the
[1:29:34] very elect if it was possible. And he
[1:29:37] goes on to say almost exactly the same.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; It's not as though something's going to
[1:29:46] be way out there and oh that is you know
[1:29:49] hey that's not even on the same planet
[1:29:51] with the believers
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; with his believers. That's not that's
[1:29:55] not what Jesus talking about. It's going
[1:29:57] to be so close
[1:30:01] almost exactly the same.
[1:30:05] And you might say this morning, "Oh,
[1:30:07] just a second, brother Ed. You're
[1:30:10] bringing that down to a very fine
[1:30:11] point." And so it is
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; in the harvest time.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I've seen all kinds of people who've
[1:30:20] professed this message.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; And here we are with a nice audience of
[1:30:25] people this morning, a few hundred
[1:30:26] people. I'm going to tell you and I I
[1:30:30] I'm not doubting is but I I said this to
[1:30:32] my wife and I believe it. If we had a
[1:30:36] severe persecution,
[1:30:39] a severe persecution come upon this
[1:30:41] church and some were thrown in prisons
[1:30:45] and some were beaten
[1:30:47] and and and uh and you were offered to
[1:30:50] deny,
[1:30:51] I can tell you the deacons wouldn't have
[1:30:54] any trouble seating people
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; by the next Sunday. Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, don't you have
[1:31:00] confidence in me?" I do.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; But I remember what happened in Malawi
[1:31:05] would have about 600 people and they
[1:31:07] threw they threw about 90 of them in
[1:31:10] prison.
[1:31:13] And brother, the pastor, brother Kandogi
[1:31:16] told me when they came back and got out
[1:31:18] of prison, there was just a handful of
[1:31:20] people left
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; because when they saw that kind of
[1:31:24] persecution, they fled. What am I saying
[1:31:26] this for? You You might be asking, "What
[1:31:27] are you saying this for?" You better
[1:31:29] know you're calling an election that
[1:31:31] it's sure.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And you're not about to be moved.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's all right
[1:31:40] for you, brother Bisco. You're up over
[1:31:42] the hump and you're there. You got your
[1:31:43] white hair and all the rest of it." I
[1:31:45] had I I was stronger probably at 18 than
[1:31:48] I am today. I was absolutely fanatic.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have a radio in my car.
[1:31:56] Come on, brother.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; I ordered a new car and I had a second
[1:31:59] new car and I refused to have a radio in
[1:32:01] either one of them.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; We never got a newspaper.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with the world.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That's what you're here for.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; The further we get from the world, the
[1:32:17] better we are.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And he's cunning. He'll come not not
[1:32:25] just under your door, the crack of the
[1:32:26] door. He'll come in. He'll do anything
[1:32:28] he can and he use every medium possible
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; to get in.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I say slam the door on him.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Resist him.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Shut him down.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You don't only have a right. It's not
[1:32:43] you. It's not you that has the power.
[1:32:46] The message that you're absorbing has
[1:32:48] the power.
[1:32:51] That's right.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I don't have a whole lot of time, but
[1:32:59] I'm I want you to turn to second Timothy
[1:33:02] the uh third chapter.
[1:33:15] This is a chapter that's well known
[1:33:19] to us. speaks about the last days.
[1:33:22] Perilous times will come. But while
[1:33:24] you're looking at it, I want to read.
[1:33:29] I want to read from the amplified.
[1:33:36] And you may have a little difficulty
[1:33:37] just following along, but listen this
[1:33:39] closely. But understand this,
[1:33:44] that in the last days there will set in
[1:33:47] perilous times of great stress and
[1:33:51] trouble, hard to deal with
[1:33:55] and hard to bear
[1:33:58] and perilous. The word that Paul has
[1:34:00] used writing to Timothy which he called
[1:34:03] his son the actual word in the Greek is
[1:34:06] they are fierce times
[1:34:09] and they're hard to do to take. They're
[1:34:11] hard to take
[1:34:14] to approach. You don't know how to
[1:34:15] approach it.
[1:34:18] They're hard to bear. They're
[1:34:19] troublesome. They're dangerous. They're
[1:34:21] harsh fierce and savage. And you can
[1:34:24] just look at me for a moment now. But
[1:34:26] the second part of this perilous comes
[1:34:29] from a it's it's a compound word and it
[1:34:32] comes from a second word which is these
[1:34:35] are perilous times. Just listen closely
[1:34:38] now. Hard to deal with sometimes that we
[1:34:42] have a difficult time approaching
[1:34:43] something. They're they're troublesome.
[1:34:46] They're dangerous. They're harsh and
[1:34:49] they're fierce and they're savage. But
[1:34:51] that is because
[1:34:53] the second part of that is
[1:34:56] because there is a loosening or a
[1:35:00] slackening.
[1:35:01] There's a relaxing
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; to let down from a higher place to a
[1:35:07] lower place.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that these days would be
[1:35:13] like the days of Noah.
[1:35:16] They prospered in Noah's day. They had
[1:35:18] he preached 120 years and only got a
[1:35:22] handful ate souls into the ark.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; What did those people thousands that
[1:35:28] heard Noah preach? The Bible says they
[1:35:31] were buying and selling and building and
[1:35:35] all. It's a time of economic. It's not
[1:35:37] our fault that things are the way they
[1:35:39] are. They are that way. We buy and we
[1:35:42] sell shell and we build and we move and
[1:35:46] we do all of these things which are a
[1:35:48] part of of life a part of life. But that
[1:35:51] is not that is not what guides us. That
[1:35:55] is not what is to control us.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because I can tell you
[1:36:01] with a with full assurance that
[1:36:04] prosperity
[1:36:05] tends towards relaxation
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; and adversity tends towards more
[1:36:13] strengthening and stamina and
[1:36:15] determination.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And so this is part of the last days.
[1:36:19] There's no preacher, and I certainly am
[1:36:21] not going to a preacher to stand up and
[1:36:24] browbeat the people because you're in a
[1:36:26] time of prosperity. You can't help it.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; But let it be known that that shall not
[1:36:33] relax you.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Whether you only have $1,000 or $100 or
[1:36:39] $10 or a million dollars, none of those
[1:36:42] figures should have any bearing on your
[1:36:45] spiritual walk with God.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; It has it's irrelevant.
[1:36:52] Whatever it is, it must not dictate to
[1:36:55] you what your spiritual level is.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; But if your business starts to tell you
[1:37:01] you can't go to church, you don't have
[1:37:04] time to read the message. You don't hear
[1:37:06] it. You haven't got time to absorb and
[1:37:09] sit back and hear the voice of God.
[1:37:12] That's the time to resist the enemy and
[1:37:15] say, "Now you're trying to get at me
[1:37:17] through the very thing God gave me as a
[1:37:19] gift to provide me with a living. Now
[1:37:21] you're trying to control it. You're
[1:37:23] trying to make me its servant. I want
[1:37:26] you to know that I'm the master here.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; And families are torn up and the husband
[1:37:34] can't be around. The father's gone. The
[1:37:37] mother's gone. She's doing whatever.
[1:37:39] She's doing her studies or she's going
[1:37:41] places. She's got her clubs and got all
[1:37:43] the rest of it. And the man is going and
[1:37:45] the kids don't have the direction
[1:37:47] they're supposed to have. Are you with
[1:37:49] me?
[1:37:50] That's part of this Satan's Eden.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; And I have a lot of scriptures which I
[1:38:01] don't have time to give you. The
[1:38:03] scripture says that God said, "I'll
[1:38:05] bless you."
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And you will prosper.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; But God never intended that the
[1:38:10] prosperity was going to call cause you
[1:38:12] to relax from the word.
[1:38:15] Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us of David
[1:38:21] and who could have been more prospered
[1:38:22] than David. God gave him an everlasting
[1:38:26] king, kingdom, and a throne. And he
[1:38:29] dwelt in his luxury,
[1:38:31] but he cried out to God, "You're you're
[1:38:34] my breath. You're my life. You're
[1:38:37] everything. This marble doesn't mean
[1:38:39] anything to me. All of the glory means
[1:38:43] the gold means nothing to me. My soul
[1:38:46] thirsteth after the living God.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; But as a king, he had time to write
[1:38:53] psalms and to sing and had time to
[1:38:57] worship and had time to leave the entire
[1:39:01] mankind a heritage
[1:39:04] in the Psalms. He had time for that.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; You have to help me.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:14] That's going to be one of the most
[1:39:15] difficult things. It's harder to bear
[1:39:18] prosperity than it is to bear adversity.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; It's harder because it is more difficult
[1:39:26] to keep your balance
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; and tell Satan, "Get in the corner.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Get out of my life. Get out of my
[1:39:33] business. Get out of my home. I'm going
[1:39:36] to run things."
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And when all of these things are gone
[1:39:41] and passed away, and they surely shall,
[1:39:43] Then where are we?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; We want to be rich in faith,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; rich in God, rich in the word, rich in
[1:39:51] our witness. We want to do everything we
[1:39:54] can to spread the gospel of the good
[1:39:57] news. We're not sitting in a little
[1:39:59] quiet corner relaxing, you know, and
[1:40:02] make a better living so I can have more
[1:40:04] relaxation, etc., etc. We're here to
[1:40:06] labor for the master from the dawn to
[1:40:10] setting sun.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] Okay, we'll go back. Let me read a
[1:40:20] little bit and then I'm going to close
[1:40:23] because we've got baptism right now.
[1:40:28] These are hard to deal with, hard to
[1:40:29] bear. Verse two, for people will be
[1:40:33] lovers of self and utterly
[1:40:35] self-centered,
[1:40:37] lovers of money and aroused by an
[1:40:41] inordinate, greedy desire for wealth,
[1:40:44] proud and arrogant and contemptuous
[1:40:47] boasters. They will be abusive,
[1:40:51] blasphemous scoffers, disobedient to
[1:40:54] parents, ungrateful, unholy, and
[1:40:57] profane.
[1:40:59] They will be without natural a without
[1:41:02] natural human affection callous and
[1:41:05] inhuman. I want to stop there. I have
[1:41:08] never in my life ever in my wildest
[1:41:13] dream never believed I would ever live
[1:41:16] and see an age or a day. It was wasn't
[1:41:18] even in my not my it wasn't in my
[1:41:21] ability to conceive that I would arrive
[1:41:24] at a day and have to live in a day when
[1:41:26] parents can actually forsake and forget
[1:41:31] their own flesh and blood.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; And turn from them like they didn't even
[1:41:36] know them.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I thought, my God. And I read that
[1:41:40] scripture. I've hung on to that through
[1:41:42] these years. without natural affection.
[1:41:46] The seeds were sown and now we have a
[1:41:48] harvest of it.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And parents can leave their kids and
[1:41:53] forget them and as though they never
[1:41:55] knew them. Brought bring them into the
[1:41:57] world, their own flesh and their own
[1:41:59] blood and their own bones and forget the
[1:42:02] child.
[1:42:05] I have three daughters
[1:42:09] and I've actually had to pray, God, help
[1:42:14] me
[1:42:15] not to love them too much.
[1:42:19] I love them so deeply.
[1:42:21] I've told God, "Heaven's not heaven
[1:42:24] without them."
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; And I have prayed,
[1:42:29] "If you have to save them and cast me
[1:42:32] away,
[1:42:34] But let them have heaven.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; It's just there.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; You're not having to try to muster that
[1:42:44] up.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And then how can that be? And then you
[1:42:47] have a world where it's increasing,
[1:42:50] increasing, increasing. People forget
[1:42:52] their children and couldn't care less
[1:42:54] about where they go or what happens to
[1:42:56] them. The seeds were sewn a long time
[1:42:59] ago. And listen, I have to tell you,
[1:43:01] it's going to increase.
[1:43:05] It's going to increase. It's going to
[1:43:06] get more and more.
[1:43:21] They will be without natural affection.
[1:43:24] Callous and inhuman. Relentless.
[1:43:28] Admitting of no truth. admitting of no
[1:43:30] truth or appeasement.
[1:43:33] They will be slanderers, false accusers,
[1:43:36] troublemakers,
[1:43:38] intemperant and loose in morals and
[1:43:41] conduct, uncontrolled and fierce, haters
[1:43:44] of good. They will be treacherous
[1:43:48] betrayers, rash and inflated with
[1:43:50] self-conceit.
[1:43:52] They will be lovers of sensual pleasures
[1:43:55] and vain amusements
[1:43:57] more than rather than lovers of God. For
[1:44:01] although they hold a form of piety,
[1:44:05] true religion, and now you can look up
[1:44:08] once again all of this that I just you
[1:44:11] think that is too terrible. That is just
[1:44:13] too vile. That is so wicked. That is so
[1:44:16] terrible. Those people you you may be
[1:44:18] thinking about the the gutter down on
[1:44:20] East Vancouver or wherever it may be in
[1:44:23] Seattle or these cities. No, it's not
[1:44:25] there. These people hold a piety of true
[1:44:30] religion
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; and can put on that kind of a front.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you that the the actors in
[1:44:39] Hollywood got nothing on these people.
[1:44:45] And although they hold a form of piety,
[1:44:47] true religion, they deny and reject and
[1:44:50] are strangers to the power of it. They
[1:44:54] conduct
[1:44:55] the their conduct belies the genuiness
[1:44:58] of the their profession
[1:45:00] because they profess true Christianity
[1:45:03] and avoid all such people. Here's the
[1:45:07] council of the word of God. turn away
[1:45:10] from them.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And you even within the ranks of the
[1:45:15] message, you hear some uh subtle little
[1:45:18] thing. I tell you, it's so subtle. It's
[1:45:20] not out where they just say, "Oh, they
[1:45:21] deny. I don't believe that. I don't
[1:45:23] believe that." But it comes in just so
[1:45:24] subtle
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; even amongst believers. comes in so
[1:45:29] subtle and maybe in just a in the way of
[1:45:32] a question, you know, and and and starts
[1:45:35] to destabilize your thought and you kind
[1:45:37] of begin to wonder, yeah, well, you
[1:45:39] know, maybe, you know, where am I? Where
[1:45:41] am I at? And so forth. I tell you what,
[1:45:44] you pick up on that spirit right away.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; You are informed. You're wise enough to
[1:45:48] know you pick up on that spirit and deny
[1:45:50] it
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; and call it what it is. You say, "Well,
[1:45:54] the the sister looks like such a fine
[1:45:56] sister.
[1:45:58] The brother looks like such a fine
[1:46:00] brother, but your heart of hearts is
[1:46:02] witnessing that is sewing a seed of
[1:46:04] discrepancy. It's sewing a seed of
[1:46:06] doubt. And that enemy wants to divert me
[1:46:09] away from the company of the saints from
[1:46:12] the very place where I get my strength
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and send me off into some uh confusion
[1:46:17] and some dilemma. Deny him there
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; right at that moment. Deny him. I call
[1:46:25] upon this congregation in the name of
[1:46:27] the Lord Jesus Christ to set your sights
[1:46:31] on the prize.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Take this whole world. Take all of its
[1:46:35] prosperity. Take everything. But give me
[1:46:38] not only Jesus Christ, but give me all
[1:46:41] that he's promised for this day.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; What would we be availed, friends? What
[1:46:46] are we availed if we attain all of these
[1:46:49] things and attain attention and fame and
[1:46:51] and and all of this things that this
[1:46:53] this age offers? And does it ever offer
[1:46:55] a lot? It offers a lot.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; It offers grand things.
[1:47:03] Is there any sin in the grand thing? No.
[1:47:06] But there's more caution that must come
[1:47:08] with the life and the day that we're in.
[1:47:12] I wouldn't have to preach this in
[1:47:14] certain places where I've been in
[1:47:16] Africa, in India, in other places. I
[1:47:20] wouldn't have to preach this because it
[1:47:22] wouldn't even apply to them.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; But it does apply to us.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; It's a time when we have to be extremely
[1:47:29] careful and cautious. Amen.
[1:47:40] For among them are those who worm their
[1:47:44] way into homes and captivate silly and
[1:47:49] weak nurtured and spiritually dwarfed
[1:47:52] women loaded down with the burden of
[1:47:55] their sins or unbelief and easily swayed
[1:47:58] and led away by various evil desires and
[1:48:01] seductive impulses.
[1:48:04] These weak women will listen to anybody
[1:48:07] who will teach them and they are
[1:48:09] forever. Let me stop there. I have found
[1:48:12] men
[1:48:14] in this day and in the so-called message
[1:48:18] so weak that their women almost have to
[1:48:21] teach them.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Now that really become quiet.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And I have counseledled with women even
[1:48:30] not so very long ago. said, "I need help
[1:48:35] because
[1:48:37] it seems that my husband gives me no
[1:48:39] spiritual leadership, no spiritual
[1:48:41] headship, and I and I I I'm getting out
[1:48:44] of my place.
[1:48:46] I have to try to counsel him." But the
[1:48:48] person that doesn't want counseling is
[1:48:50] the husband because he'd be intimidated.
[1:48:52] He doesn't want He doesn't want He
[1:48:54] doesn't want it to be known. Well, I'm
[1:48:55] let down. I've relaxed. I'm not really
[1:48:57] I'm not really being the example in the
[1:48:59] home.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You're quiet now.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; There ought to be at least 50 60% of the
[1:49:06] men that could say amen to that.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; What what what does this message teach?
[1:49:17] It's not onto the women just because
[1:49:18] they're they're weak women and all the
[1:49:20] rest of it, but there's a lack of
[1:49:21] leadership
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; and there needs to be leadership. Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; I'm into it. I might as well say it.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Then they come and say, "Well, the
[1:49:37] preacher is not preaching it." No,
[1:49:39] that's not it. It's not being applied.
[1:49:42] It's being preached, but it's not being
[1:49:44] there's no application when it gets
[1:49:46] home.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; They want the preacher. Bring up the
[1:49:50] kids.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Instruct us for our kids. You know, if
[1:49:54] we got a problem with our teenagers,
[1:49:56] it's a preacher's fault. No, it's not.
[1:49:59] There's no place here. Here, this is the
[1:50:01] word of God. I I don't have one
[1:50:03] scripture here. I don't have one place
[1:50:05] in the scripture where I have a mandate
[1:50:06] to bring up your children.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; You're the one that brought them into
[1:50:10] the world. And you're the one to
[1:50:12] instruct them. And you're the one to
[1:50:14] hear the word as it comes across the
[1:50:15] pulpit and take it home and apply it.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's a parent's job. Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; But in this day,
[1:50:25] we're in a we're in a harvest time
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; where parents are letting go of those
[1:50:31] responsibilities and we must not do it.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Help me. I'm trying to end.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Speak your word on God.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] We receive it.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; We receive it.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; We receive it.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Our ears, our heart. It's
[1:51:10] open.
[1:51:13] says, "And they are forever getting
[1:51:15] information
[1:51:17] but are never able to arrive at a
[1:51:19] recognition and a knowledge of the
[1:51:21] truth."
[1:51:23] I have found him. I'm talking about the
[1:51:24] message. I'm not talking about
[1:51:25] denominations now. We don't we we're
[1:51:28] past that. I have found within the
[1:51:30] message, people are continually getting
[1:51:32] more information, more information. It's
[1:51:34] not information the person needs. It
[1:51:36] needs to be a revelation within your own
[1:51:38] soul.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And a birth and you're done. Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going through a hard time.
[1:51:44] Praise God. We all go through hard
[1:51:46] times.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I'm having difficulty. I'm having
[1:51:49] temptation. The devil's on my case. He's
[1:51:51] on everybody's case.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; We're not here to whimper.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; We're here to stand up and be a soldier
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; and fight this good fight of faith. And
[1:52:02] God is calling on us as a whole
[1:52:04] congregation to be exactly that. Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; The word has given us exact details of
[1:52:10] how a wife and a woman should be, how
[1:52:12] young people should be, a young lady.
[1:52:14] We've got exactly
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; what we should be doing,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; how to live,
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; How to hold ourselves, maintain
[1:52:26] ourselves. You young ladies, don't
[1:52:29] become flooy and and uh uh and throw
[1:52:31] yourself out in in front of young men
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; with a tantalizing dress and so on and
[1:52:38] so forth. And then someone says, "Well,
[1:52:40] uh uh you know, the sister in your
[1:52:42] church or this person, they wear a
[1:52:45] sweater that's too tight or they wear a
[1:52:46] heel that's too high and so on so
[1:52:48] forth." They need to listen to the word
[1:52:50] of God. It's not for me to go up and say
[1:52:53] your your your sweater's too tight or
[1:52:55] your heels are too high. You know what
[1:52:57] the word of God says?
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Just do it.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And young man, the way that you're
[1:53:03] supposed to live,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; do it.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God is calling
[1:53:07] for you to do. And once it's spoken,
[1:53:10] there is no excuse.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] and homes in the way that they should be
[1:53:23] and it's amazing absolutely amazing to
[1:53:25] me people if you have a business I've
[1:53:28] said it before I'm going to say it again
[1:53:29] I'm going to close if you had a business
[1:53:32] and you're running into difficulty and
[1:53:34] you say no just where will I consult who
[1:53:37] shall I consult with well what do you
[1:53:39] know yeah here's a fellow and his
[1:53:42] business has failed three times times
[1:53:44] and he's gone bankrupt and they've gone
[1:53:46] into chapter 11. They've gone into
[1:53:48] chapter 7 and they've gone bankrupt and
[1:53:50] they've liquidated their stuff and
[1:53:51] started all up and then they liquidated
[1:53:52] again and all the rest of I I think I'll
[1:53:54] go and take counsel from him. You've
[1:53:57] lost your marbles, friend. Right.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And there's people just as silly, and I
[1:54:03] say silly with a reverent word, they
[1:54:06] will take counsel from somebody or
[1:54:08] they'll give ear and give allowance for
[1:54:10] somebody
[1:54:12] not married,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; don't have a wife,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; never had a child,
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; never preached a sermon.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; God has never honored them by giving
[1:54:24] them a a sheep.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; They have zero witness. And then they'll
[1:54:29] sit there and open up both ears and hear
[1:54:31] what they have to say. I'll say, "You're
[1:54:34] on dangerous ground before God. You're
[1:54:36] on dangerous ground."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have enough spiritual
[1:54:40] intelligence to say, "What has this
[1:54:42] fellow got to offer me? What has this
[1:54:43] woman got to offer me?" Zero. Zero.
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Is God the author of confusion? No.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, then I have I've wasted
[1:54:56] 40 years of my life more. Could have
[1:54:59] been having my feet up doing something
[1:55:00] easier. You think it's easy? People tell
[1:55:02] think going, you know, you go in a
[1:55:04] series of meetings. Oh, you only have
[1:55:05] three meetings in Phoenix. Yeah. And
[1:55:07] maybe 15 hours of counseling and praying
[1:55:10] for about 50 people individually, one
[1:55:12] after the other and instructing them.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; And when you're done, as I said to a few
[1:55:17] of you, I hardly knew my own name. And I
[1:55:19] mean that.
[1:55:21] I was so exhausted. Then you come home
[1:55:23] and you know you have a nice time in
[1:55:25] Phoenix. Yeah. Just just praying that
[1:55:29] God will give you enough strength for
[1:55:31] the next hour.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Not enough strength to even go to a
[1:55:35] restaurant and want to eat. Just take me
[1:55:37] to a room and roll me over into a bed.
[1:55:40] This is labor, friends.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; It's a labor.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; If anybody indicates, well, we're here
[1:55:47] for a job. God have mercy on your soul.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; That's the last thing in the world. It's
[1:55:54] not a job. It's a burden of your heart.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Could somebody pay you to be a mother?
[1:56:02] Pay you to be a father?
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Say that's a disgraceful statement.
[1:56:07] We're in it because we love
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; the people. And I tell you what,
[1:56:11] friends, I thank you. I thank you for
[1:56:14] the a gallant
[1:56:18] the gallant spirit that I have been
[1:56:22] privileged by God. And that's what I
[1:56:26] consider. I consider you as a
[1:56:28] congregation. I'm so privileged that we
[1:56:31] can walk together
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; and this is just a beginning
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; because he is going to increase.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; This word that we have received is going
[1:56:42] to increase. You do not have to infuse
[1:56:46] good seed with life. It has its own
[1:56:48] life.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; And it has that life because the author,
[1:56:52] the creator said, "Bring forth."
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And it's done.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; God said it. You don't have to worry.
[1:57:01] You absorb the seed. You hear the word.
[1:57:04] And I tell you what, fellas, whether
[1:57:05] you're 15 or whether you're 50 or
[1:57:07] whether you're 70 or whatever age or
[1:57:10] sisters or home or family or whatever
[1:57:12] more, the life is in the seed
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; and the power is in the seed to bring it
[1:57:17] forth. It already has it. You don't have
[1:57:20] to do it.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; It will do it.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; You have to make yourself available and
[1:57:25] then forget it.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Plant your seeds and forget it. If you
[1:57:31] go and dig it up and see how it's doing,
[1:57:33] you'll destroy it.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:57:40] I'm having a hard time quitting.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Satan also, he tries to get everybody to
[1:57:47] dig it up what you just heard. The seed
[1:57:49] just nicely gets buried and he says, you
[1:57:50] know, dig it out. Check it out and see.
[1:57:52] Maybe maybe you didn't see that right.
[1:57:53] Maybe you didn't hear right. you're
[1:57:54] always, you know, reviewing and re
[1:57:56] reassessing and going over it again and
[1:57:59] well, yeah, well, may maybe this, maybe
[1:58:01] that. No, bury it and forget it.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; And it's going to bring forth fruit.
[1:58:06] It's going to bring forth power. It's
[1:58:08] going to bring forth a washing. When you
[1:58:09] need a washing, it'll be there and wash
[1:58:11] you. When you need strength, it'll be
[1:58:13] there and give you strength. When you
[1:58:15] need a word, it'll be there and give you
[1:58:16] a word.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Let him increase.
[1:58:23] And the scripture doesn't put the onus
[1:58:25] on you to make him increase. God didn't
[1:58:28] say, "I sow the seed, but you make sure
[1:58:30] it grows and you make sure it comes to a
[1:58:32] harvest." God didn't say that. God said
[1:58:36] in his word, he must increase.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And he shall increase.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; You just believe it. You you put it in
[1:58:46] your heart and bury it and let it stay
[1:58:49] there and it'll bring forth fruit.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Let those that are going to be baptized
[1:59:01] go immediately and just be ready to be
[1:59:04] baptized. And brother Derek, you'll come
[1:59:06] and if you lead the people, I want to
[1:59:08] sing.
[1:59:10] I know in whom I've believed.
[1:59:14] Not so much for you that are sitting in
[1:59:16] the seats, but the two people we're
[1:59:18] going to baptize.
[1:59:22] We're going to baptize
[1:59:24] Lyall and Roger
[1:59:27] and Norin Keer's mother.
[1:59:43] And we're going to baptize
[1:59:46] Sister Diane Segman's husband, Claude,
[1:59:50] brother and sister Dodge's son-in-law.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah.
[2:00:00] Sister Sarah's father and Jason's
[2:00:04] father-in-law. We're going to baptize
[2:00:07] them. So, brother Derek
[2:00:10] and that's why I said because both of
[2:00:12] these have come very very slowly and
[2:00:16] patiently and you know a little step at
[2:00:18] a time. A little step at a time but
[2:00:20] sometime it took years brother Derek it
[2:00:23] took years.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it took so many years,
[2:00:28] you know, that every step they came to,
[2:00:31] they just want to make absolutely sure.
[2:00:34] And we'll say a little bit more when we
[2:00:36] get in the tank. Amen. God bless you.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, shall we?
[2:00:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:44] [Applause]
[2:00:49] I know not by God's wondrous grace to me
[2:00:57] he have made known
[2:01:01] nor by
[2:01:03] worthy Christ in love redeemed before

[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have
[2:09:22] your seats.
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:34] Well, I know that our sister Irene
[2:09:36] Kemper is not a stranger to
[2:09:39] most of us here
[2:09:41] and I'd like to say some words from my
[2:09:44] heart. I consider it a privilege
[2:09:48] to baptize her
[2:09:51] because I believe that God has permitted
[2:09:54] me to baptize
[2:09:56] most if not all of her children.
[2:10:00] And uh the one daughter I did not
[2:10:02] recognize uh was Colleen. I didn't uh we
[2:10:07] have brother Roger,
[2:10:10] brother Lyall,
[2:10:11] Sister Norin,
[2:10:13] and Sister Colleen.
[2:10:16] And I wouldn't doubt that today Mark is
[2:10:19] leaning over the banister. Yeah.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And uh having a sense of greater joy if
[2:10:26] that's possible and where he is.
[2:10:30] And I I noticed very early that
[2:10:33] Sister Keer
[2:10:35] uh and when I say Sister Keer, I want
[2:10:38] you to know that two Sundays ago, she
[2:10:41] came forward and we started a prayer and
[2:10:44] I said to God in my prayer right at the
[2:10:46] beginning, I said, "Father,
[2:10:50] I have called
[2:10:52] Sister Keer a sister for a long time
[2:10:56] because I believe that you are going to
[2:10:58] bring her
[2:11:00] and she has respected I've seen this
[2:11:02] respect in her
[2:11:05] in her heart for the changes that took
[2:11:07] place and they were dramatic changes and
[2:11:09] perhaps a mystery to her at the
[2:11:11] beginning but as she saw these changes
[2:11:14] take place in her children's lives she
[2:11:17] had a great respect and that caught my
[2:11:20] eye
[2:11:22] and God made the scriptures real to her
[2:11:24] and as he did she walked in Yes.
[2:11:30] And if I could relate, may I relate just
[2:11:33] what took place a few weeks ago
[2:11:35] regarding the scripture when you went to
[2:11:38] your church.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:11:42] Uh
[2:11:43] you were uh there was a in the night
[2:11:46] time a song was coming to you.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Oh. Uh well, my name was called.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; My name I heard my name was called. like
[2:11:54] it says Irene
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; in the night time and you actually heard
[2:11:57] your name called.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; I did. Yeah.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; She heard her name called in the night
[2:12:01] time
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; and I just looked up and and didn't see
[2:12:05] anybody or and then I just peacefully
[2:12:08] went back to well I didn't go back to
[2:12:09] sleep but I was just thinking of this
[2:12:12] song. I hear you're calling my name in
[2:12:14] the night.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Now for those who didn't catch it she
[2:12:17] heard this song. I
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; I just thought you know
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; I heard you calling my name. That's a
[2:12:22] song out of the on out of a song book.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; In her church had a Catholic church.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; And that morning when I went to church,
[2:12:29] there have to be Sunday. Yes.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; The Sunday morning I went to church and
[2:12:32] they sang that song. The same song that
[2:12:34] was thick enough.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; The choir sang the song that she heard
[2:12:38] right after she heard her name called
[2:12:41] and then she hears this song and it's
[2:12:44] about the song title of the song is
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; I hear you calling my name in the night.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; I hear you calling my name in the night.
[2:12:52] Now folks, God doesn't do things,
[2:12:55] doesn't he? Do things exact? And then
[2:12:58] she gets up and goes to church and the
[2:13:00] choir sings that song. I hear you
[2:13:02] calling my name in the night.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; And the priest got up and read this
[2:13:07] scripture.
[2:13:10] I will raise them up a prophet from
[2:13:12] among their brethren,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; like unto me,
[2:13:20] and will put my words in his mouth,
[2:13:23] and he shall speak unto them all that I
[2:13:26] shall command him.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass that whosoever
[2:13:30] will not hearken unto my words, which he
[2:13:33] shall speak in my name, I will require
[2:13:37] it of him. But the prophet which shall
[2:13:40] presume to speak a word in my name,
[2:13:43] which I have not commanded him to speak,
[2:13:46] or that shall speak in the name of other
[2:13:48] gods, even that prophet shall die. And
[2:13:51] if thou say in thine heart, how shall we
[2:13:54] know the word of the Lord, the word of
[2:13:56] the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet
[2:14:00] speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the
[2:14:03] thing follow not, nor come to pass, that
[2:14:06] is a thing which the Lord hath not
[2:14:09] spoken,
[2:14:10] but the prophet that hath spoken it
[2:14:13] presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid
[2:14:16] of him. And I said, uh, when the priest
[2:14:19] was finished reading that scripture,
[2:14:21] what did he do? She said, he didn't
[2:14:23] comment on it at all.
[2:14:26] just read that scripture and it went
[2:14:29] straight to her heart for God was
[2:14:31] certainly calling you in the night.
[2:14:36] Sister Keer became, I'd say, fully
[2:14:38] persuaded. And I want to say to you,
[2:14:41] Sister Irene, and being fully persuaded
[2:14:46] that what he had promised, he was also
[2:14:50] able to perform, and I have found you to
[2:14:53] have become fully persuaded.
[2:14:56] And Paul said,"For I am persuaded that
[2:14:58] neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
[2:15:02] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[2:15:04] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[2:15:06] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[2:15:09] be able to separate us from the love of
[2:15:12] God, which is in Christ Jesus."
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Do you want to say anything? I just want
[2:15:17] to just say to everybody for to to thank
[2:15:21] everybody for all the prayers for me and
[2:15:23] that I have the that God gave me the
[2:15:26] courage to do go through with this and I
[2:15:29] feel in my heart it is right.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Let's bow in prayer.
[2:15:36] Heavenly Father, at this very sacred and
[2:15:39] lovely moment,
[2:15:41] we stand in the water. Jesus, you once
[2:15:44] stood in the water with John. You were
[2:15:47] baptized.
[2:15:48] Multitudes came, both men and women.
[2:15:51] They heard the word. They were stirred
[2:15:54] as our sister Keer has been stirred.
[2:15:57] They no doubt looked perhaps some of the
[2:15:59] members of their family and saw such
[2:16:02] dramatic things happening and taking
[2:16:04] place. And the people following this
[2:16:06] young prophet of Nazareth called Jesus
[2:16:09] Christ. And as they followed him,
[2:16:13] he is the word and he increased and they
[2:16:15] increased. And now, Lord, I know that
[2:16:18] your Holy Spirit, as we've spoken
[2:16:21] together, will now come to the word
[2:16:24] which our sister Keer has believed, and
[2:16:27] it shall explode into depth of of such
[2:16:31] richness and such meaning. And Lord, I
[2:16:34] pray that her fellowship with you will
[2:16:37] always be sweet. That you'll be her
[2:16:40] comforter. You'll be her guide
[2:16:43] all through life, Lord. And in that
[2:16:46] great gathering time in the rapture,
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; we'll be united and joined together.
[2:16:52] Lord, I pray your blessing upon her
[2:16:54] life. And now, Father, she has followed
[2:16:57] you in repentance and now in baptism in
[2:17:01] the name of Jesus Christ. And you have
[2:17:04] promised and she shall receive the gift
[2:17:08] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Turn sideways this way if you will. Just
[2:17:15] turn this way. That's fine. Put your
[2:17:18] hand.
[2:17:22] That's fine. That's fine. You can hold
[2:17:25] up.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Father.
[2:17:33] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:17:36] just take our sister now.
[2:17:39] Take all fear away.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Let peace completely permeate her.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Irene Keer according to how God
[2:17:49] has spoken to you. I baptize you in true
[2:17:54] Christian baptism in the name of our
[2:17:56] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:04] [Applause]
[2:18:10] Hallelujah.
[2:18:12] Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] Hallelujah.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; God bless her prayed heart. Amen.
[2:18:30] Well, it's the first time I had my head
[2:18:32] in the water.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; That's the first time she said she had
[2:18:35] her head in the water.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; How you doing, Ken?
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; New life.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; The old man's been buried here.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a mass grave right
[2:18:53] here.
[2:19:07] Amen.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a chorus, Brother Derek.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, peace
[2:19:17] like a river.

[2:21:08] Brother and sister Dodd's their
[2:21:10] daughter, Sister Diane.
[2:21:12] Daughter Sarah. Brother Claude's
[2:21:15] daughter Sarah. How long has Sister
[2:21:17] Diane been waiting for this?
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Years.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Years.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Years.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Do you want to say how many?
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Poverty. What?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Since 75.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Since 1975.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; I know. They've been here 23 years. And
[2:21:34] I've been waiting for 23 years.
[2:21:37] That's why I had the scriptures.
[2:21:40] Brother Claude became persuaded. And
[2:21:43] when did God meet you? In the woods.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Uh 2004.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; 16 months ago.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; 16 months ago.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; 16 months ago.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; 16 months to
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; God met him in the woods.
[2:21:54] Saved him. Delivered him from
[2:21:55] cigarettes. Isn't that right?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:22:09] Brother Claude's a wee bit like brother
[2:22:11] Bud Southwick
[2:22:14] and he's a man of the wilderness and God
[2:22:17] met him in the wilderness.
[2:22:21] God loves his creation for the scripture
[2:22:24] says for thou has created all things and
[2:22:27] for thy pleasure were they created. It's
[2:22:29] no wonder that we enjoy them. Brother
[2:22:31] Claude
[2:22:33] and God made himself real to him by
[2:22:35] giving him a trophy deer.
[2:22:38] And God made himself real to Bud
[2:22:40] Southwick when he saw the vision of the
[2:22:43] caribou and the grizzly right in his own
[2:22:46] that was his own element.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; And I've always respected brother Claude
[2:22:51] and he's never heard me say these things
[2:22:53] but I've always respected you Claude.
[2:22:55] Thank you
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; for this reason.
[2:22:58] You've always been a man of principles.
[2:23:02] You've always been respectable of God
[2:23:04] and his message.
[2:23:07] He allowed your wife to come to church,
[2:23:10] your children.
[2:23:12] And he's been a hard worker.
[2:23:15] He works hard in a mill to provide for
[2:23:18] his family.
[2:23:21] And I've respect him for God. Honors
[2:23:23] that.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Mhm. Definitely. And one day, God called
[2:23:27] him and delivered him from every chain
[2:23:29] that Satan tried to hold him by. And I
[2:23:31] have a quote I want to read for you.
[2:23:34] Brother Brandham said, "I love the
[2:23:36] mountains.
[2:23:37] I love the sunsets.
[2:23:40] I just stake down and time a horse and
[2:23:43] take up top of the mountains and stay a
[2:23:45] couple of days just watching the sunrise
[2:23:47] and go down." Hearing the eagle scream,
[2:23:50] "It's good. I'd love to be there." But
[2:23:53] brother, my heart begins to thump and to
[2:23:56] beat when I think of
[2:23:59] unclean, unclean.
[2:24:03] The evil spirits tore him.
[2:24:06] And he's singing that song.
[2:24:09] He said, "All is well when Jesus comes
[2:24:11] to stay."
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; and that begins to thump in the
[2:24:16] prophet's heart. He says, "I begin to
[2:24:18] think of the sick and that call and
[2:24:22] there's something within me cries
[2:24:25] and I get down out of those mountains
[2:24:27] right quick down to the people and I
[2:24:30] want to identify myself as his servant
[2:24:32] among his people. Oh, how I love to
[2:24:36] identify myself with him." Then in
[2:24:38] regards to that, he comes back among us
[2:24:41] and identifies himself with us. And
[2:24:44] today,
[2:24:47] Brother Claude met God up in the
[2:24:48] mountains.
[2:24:50] But now he's here in the tank
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; and God is here to identify him with
[2:24:56] himself.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Claude, we're going to leave a
[2:24:59] skeleton of a man down in this water.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to be the old man.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; No, I don't want him.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; You don't want him? Is there anything
[2:25:07] you want to say that how God dealt with
[2:25:09] you and brought you here now? just
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; oh he started dealing with me and I just
[2:25:13] I didn't know what was going on and I
[2:25:15] mean it started the summer 2004 and it
[2:25:19] just kept getting worse and worse and
[2:25:20] worse and everything I do I just didn't
[2:25:22] enjoy it no more right
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; so we went hunting and everything and
[2:25:26] that night couldn't sleep I mean it just
[2:25:28] kept dealing with me all night long so
[2:25:30] when I got up that morning to leave camp
[2:25:33] I just said hey I said I don't
[2:25:35] understand this I said whatever you want
[2:25:37] to do if you give me the deer and
[2:25:40] everything. I will follow you no matter
[2:25:43] where.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; And and then he starts speaking you
[2:25:46] about baptism.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And about two months ago, I
[2:25:50] started feel like I should get baptized.
[2:25:53] So
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; it would come and go and just get
[2:25:56] stronger and stronger and stronger. So
[2:25:58] here I am.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; You became persuaded.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that lovely?
[2:26:08] Our gracious and loving heavenly father,
[2:26:11] we are standing here Lord with my
[2:26:13] brother Claude Sigman and how you have
[2:26:16] so tenderly and we think of the word and
[2:26:20] the attribute of your longsuffering
[2:26:22] year after year you'd speak to him and
[2:26:25] you deal with him and you'd hear prayers
[2:26:28] made Lord his wife prayed and his mother
[2:26:31] and father-in-law prayed and we prayed
[2:26:34] Lord that one day you'd make yourself
[2:26:36] known to him and We're standing here
[2:26:38] today, Lord, because you have said
[2:26:40] repent every one of you in the name of
[2:26:42] Jes and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:26:45] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[2:26:47] the Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that you
[2:26:50] will infuse him
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; with your spirit and cause him to be a
[2:26:55] mighty witness for you as he lives this
[2:26:58] new life in Jesus Christ. We thank you
[2:27:02] now. Amen. Put your hands together.
[2:27:05] Brother Claude, I now baptize you on the
[2:27:09] basis of your confession in Jesus Christ
[2:27:13] and what he has done for you. I baptize
[2:27:16] you in true Christian baptism in the
[2:27:18] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:36] Hallelujah.
[2:27:39] God bless you, brother. Bless you. Bless
[2:27:41] you. Amen.
[2:27:45] The glorious
[2:27:50] and
[2:27:51] his
[2:27:54] wonderful love. We'll give the glory to
[2:28:00] Jesus
[2:28:03] and tell his wonderful
[2:28:11] glory to Jesus.
[2:28:18] Oh, his wonderful love will give the
[2:28:23] glory to Jesus
[2:28:28] and tell his wonderful love.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's who we want to give the glory to.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; I think we know it all by heart.

[2:29:03] So, the brothers that are on shift work,
[2:29:05] if you want to make yourself available
[2:29:07] for that evening, that will be
[2:29:09] wonderful. Will you pray for me this
[2:29:11] evening?
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; We're in a lot of trouble.

[2:29:22] [Music]
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:29:27] that makes a preacher pretty nervous,
[2:29:29] folks.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; But the Lord has a mind, doesn't he?
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; We want to catch the mind of the Holy
[2:29:35] Spirit. I know that you're believers. I
[2:29:37] know you'll pull on the word of God
[2:29:38] where, you know, I mean, there's this is
[2:29:40] a big Bible. There's a lot of words in
[2:29:42] this Bible. And I believe the Holy
[2:29:44] Spirit has a mind and and I thought it
[2:29:46] was a tremendous word we heard this
[2:29:48] morning. So be praying for me this
[2:29:50] evening and we want to thank the Lord
[2:29:52] for these ones that he's added to the
[2:29:54] kingdom. Sister Camper, Brother Claude,
[2:29:57] God bless these warriors. May God use
[2:30:01] them for the kingdom. Let's pray.
[2:30:03] [Music]
[2:30:05] Lord, we are lovers of your word.
[2:30:09] We see in this age there are sign
[2:30:11] seekers.
[2:30:13] But I believe I'm with a people Lord
[2:30:15] that are word seekers.
[2:30:18] We desire the unveiling of God. We
[2:30:21] desire with a great desire within us to
[2:30:23] see the body of Christ to see that word
[2:30:27] become manifest within our lives. And
[2:30:31] so, Father, we're just asking now that
[2:30:33] as these precious souls have now come to
[2:30:36] the waters of baptism, would you baptize
[2:30:39] them with the Holy Ghost and fire? May
[2:30:42] Lord God, you consume their lives. And
[2:30:45] we are so thankful for their walk with
[2:30:48] God and how you've led our dear sister
[2:30:50] and our our dear brother Claude Sigman.
[2:30:52] We just pray that you will lead them
[2:30:55] faithfully in the days ahead. And Lord
[2:30:58] Jesus, we're praying for brother Dier.
[2:31:01] He'll be taking a service this evening.
[2:31:03] Maybe weary and body how Satan has
[2:31:05] attacked him this week. We pray that you
[2:31:07] will so inspire him. Use him mightily.
[2:31:11] May God the word of God come in power
[2:31:14] and demonstration. And may it be such a
[2:31:16] tremendous meeting in Seattle. And
[2:31:19] Father, remember us this evening.
[2:31:21] Father, we're just asking that you will
[2:31:23] take a little thought that you've laid
[2:31:24] upon my heart. I pray you'll inspire the
[2:31:27] speaker and the hearer. And Lord, we'll
[2:31:30] give you all the glory in Jesus name.
[2:31:34] Amen.
[2:31:35] We'll give the glory to Jesus
[2:31:42] and tell
[2:31:45] his wonderful
[2:31:48] love. We'll give you the glory to Jesus
[2:31:56] and tell of his wonderful
[2:31:59] love.
