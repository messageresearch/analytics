[13:49] [Music]
[13:51] Heavenly Father, we want to adore you
[13:53] this morning.
[13:55] Lord, you came many years ago.
[13:58] [Music]
[14:00] You changed the schedule for many of the
[14:02] believers and even angels and even the
[14:04] shepherds and
[14:06] changed the schedule for Mary and that
[14:09] day when the angel visited her. Lord,
[14:12] you've changed our lives. You've changed
[14:14] our schedules. You've changed our whole
[14:16] lives. And you've rearranged them. And
[14:19] you came on the scene. Angels have
[14:21] visited us, given us messages from
[14:24] above, of salvation, of forgiveness,
[14:29] of deliverance, of healing. We receive
[14:32] those angels, God. We We want to adore
[14:35] you for what you've spoken to us, not
[14:38] 2,000 years ago, but in our day, in our
[14:41] hour, we've heard messages from above.
[14:44] on the wings of your presence. You came
[14:48] into our lives in so many ways.
[14:52] For many it was a shock. For many was it
[14:55] was surprise. For all of us it was
[14:58] divine. This morning we want to worship
[15:00] you, Father. Not as a baby but as a man,
[15:05] as our husband, Christ the word. You've
[15:09] been so wonderful to us in our marriage
[15:12] life. You've taken care of us. You've
[15:14] touched us. We don't want to just speak
[15:17] of the blessings, but we want to speak
[15:19] of the life we have with you. So
[15:21] wonderful, so supernatural.
[15:24] Lord, we as Mary, as Elizabeth, as
[15:27] Zacharias,
[15:29] so many of the believers, we feel
[15:31] humble. We feel small. We feel
[15:33] inadequate. But Lord, it doesn't change
[15:35] the call. It doesn't change you speaking
[15:38] to us. We want to rise out of our our
[15:41] minds. We want to rise out of our own
[15:43] thoughts. We want to worship you, King
[15:45] of Kings. This one whose kingdom there
[15:49] shall never be an end. This one that has
[15:51] risen, Lord, out of eternities and has
[15:54] called us as men and women to stand by
[15:56] your side as your elected lady. We
[15:59] worship you this morning. We give our
[16:02] adoration. Our words, Lord, back to you
[16:05] must be words of of praise and words of
[16:08] of beautiful words of life. Wonderful
[16:12] words we've heard, God. We've come to
[16:14] adore you this morning. Ga, not gathered
[16:16] in a stable, not gathered in a little
[16:19] house, but gathered in your house. This
[16:21] is the house of praise. This is the
[16:24] pinnacle of our lives. Uh the pinnacle
[16:26] of our week, Lord. We look forward to
[16:28] this place of your presence that we can
[16:31] come and let off the pressure. We can
[16:33] come and adore your name. We can let all
[16:36] the the world do what they're doing. But
[16:38] Lord, your bride is has another
[16:40] attraction. There's an attraction in
[16:42] Bethlehem. Your word has been wonderful,
[16:45] Lord. And we're opening up our hearts to
[16:47] you, God. Letting our tradition, letting
[16:50] our own thoughts pass away, letting our
[16:53] own over the years, Satan would want to
[16:57] build up in all of our lives and in our
[16:59] families
[17:01] certain things that would be different
[17:03] than what you have had. But Lord, this
[17:05] is your family. We are your family. So
[17:09] you have the right to change our
[17:10] thoughts. Change our attitudes. Change
[17:13] the way we approach you. God, it's not
[17:16] too late. Father, you're building a
[17:18] perfect lady that a mature lady that's
[17:21] getting ready to leave this place. So
[17:24] Lord, we give you access to our hearts
[17:26] this morning. We give you access to our
[17:28] bodies, Lord. There's afflictions among
[17:30] us. There's bodies that have needs,
[17:33] Lord. Our brother Snow there in Phoenix,
[17:35] Lord, has suffered. over the years with
[17:37] this uh infirmity in his feet. Father,
[17:40] Lord, I pray that you would touch our
[17:42] brother Snow. Oh God, bring relief to
[17:44] this condition that he has. Oh, Father,
[17:48] may you touch our brother Snow, God.
[17:51] Other hands are lifted up all over the
[17:53] building. God, we're a needy people, but
[17:55] we believe we're in the right place.
[17:58] This is the right time. Missing limbs
[18:00] would be put back. touch our brother Bob
[18:02] Zacharuk, Lord, suffering from these
[18:04] shingles. Oh God, other needs that we're
[18:07] not aware about, some we hold in our
[18:09] hearts. Lord, I pray you'd go into the
[18:11] families, go into the sisters, the
[18:14] brothers, unspoken requests, loved ones
[18:17] that need a help. God, there's families
[18:19] and even individuals in this building
[18:21] that need divine intervention. God,
[18:24] shake away, Lord, anything in our lives
[18:27] that would be in laziness or anything
[18:29] that would be standing on the sidelines.
[18:31] We want to get into the action. Oh God,
[18:34] we want to be on the front row as it
[18:36] were. Even if we're in the balcony or
[18:38] out in the internet or in the nursery,
[18:40] let our hearts be magnetized to the
[18:43] spirit of Christ. You want to speak this
[18:45] morning. You want to move, oh God. You
[18:48] want to move supernaturally. Use our
[18:50] pastor, God. Use this whole day, God, to
[18:54] write upon the tables of our heart, word
[18:56] of God, ever true, changing our lives,
[19:00] changing one another. Oh God, I pray
[19:03] you'd be divine and special this
[19:05] morning. Speak to us in a mighty way.
[19:08] God, let there be spontaneous praise as
[19:11] you inspire us, oh God. Oh, even a few
[19:14] years ago when your prophet was here, it
[19:16] was in this time of the year that you
[19:19] inspired words to come that were so
[19:22] powerful, so true, God, of this season
[19:25] of the year. I pray you'd inspire us
[19:27] again and again. Let it be wave upon
[19:30] waves, oh God, of of divine inspiration,
[19:33] changing lives that are backsliding and
[19:36] bringing them back home. Lives that are
[19:38] filled with lethargy, just taking all
[19:40] those chains off of us. Even yet while
[19:42] we hear the word that people would be
[19:45] healed under your divine presence as the
[19:48] doctor is in this morning, the great
[19:50] physician is here. Oh God, the savior is
[19:53] here, the counselor is here, the mighty
[19:56] God is here. Father, we give you access
[19:59] to areas of our lives that we need help
[20:02] in our spiritual lives and physically,
[20:04] emotionally. You are everything to us.
[20:07] So just move in every way, God, and may
[20:10] divine things happen. Lord, we just feel
[20:13] a freedom this morning, a liberty to
[20:15] honor you in first place, King of Kings
[20:19] and Lord of Lords. We throw down our
[20:21] hearts, God. We bless your holy name.
[20:25] Thank you, Lord, for what you're going
[20:27] to do in Jesus name. Amen.

[23:24] uh or group of adults, you may not be
[23:26] singing. And we'll be contacting
[23:28] everyone. We're going to give priority
[23:30] to children and families. So, um it's
[23:35] always a family time and so if you're an
[23:37] adult and uh you're you're uh slated to
[23:40] sing, uh we may not be able to have room
[23:43] for you. We just got too many people.
[23:45] that happens when the church is the size
[23:47] that it is.
[23:50] Praise God.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Looking for a wonderful time over this
[23:54] holiday season and uh we want to be
[23:56] praying for the services we're going to
[23:58] be having. I know it's always a time
[23:59] when people can uh spend time with loved
[24:02] ones and it's a good uh have a good
[24:04] opportunity to witness to them. Um we
[24:07] have a special this morning from our
[24:08] sister Melissa Snow and Sister Melissa
[24:11] is going to be playing the harp.
[24:15] Uh now this is again, you know, it says,
[24:17] "Praise him on the harp."
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; And uh so you're going to be able to see
[24:22] scripture being fulfilled this morning
[24:24] by someone praising him on the harp,
[24:27] which we haven't had before here in the
[24:28] church. Now, you're going to have to be
[24:30] real quiet because I understand they're
[24:31] going to do this acoustically, which
[24:33] means they're not going to mic it. So
[24:35] you're going to have to be really quiet
[24:37] um and listen to it. Those of you who
[24:39] are hard of hearing, um just kind of
[24:42] close your eyes and meditate.
[24:47] Praise God. So, uh, as Sister Melissa
[24:50] comes and gets ready, let's, uh, sing
[24:52] together. I just want to please the
[24:54] Lord, be in his will in every way.
[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] I just want to please
[25:08] the Lord.
[25:12] in his will in every way.
[25:18] To be lost in his presence,
[25:23] found in his likeness.
[25:26] To hear him say, "Well done
[25:30] someday."
[25:32] Oh, I just want to please
[25:37] the Lord.
[25:41] Be in his will in every way.
[25:46] To be lost in his presence,
[25:51] found in his likeness.
[25:54] To hear say, "Well done
[25:58] someday.
[26:13] [Music]
[27:52] Amen.
[27:54] [Music]
[28:03] [Applause]
[28:11] [Music]
[29:59] We're going to sing that.
[30:04] We're going to sing that song and we
[30:06] don't have any instruments play. Let's
[30:07] just uh stand and sing it with a harp.
[30:13] Whenever you're ready, Sister Melissa,
[30:14] you can.
[30:20] You are my strength when I am weak. You
[30:25] are the treasure that I see. You are my
[30:30] all in all.
[30:33] [Music]
[30:36] Seeking you as a precious jewel. I want
[30:41] the Holy Ghost to rule. You are my all.
[30:51] Jesus,
[30:54] lamb of God,
[30:58] worthy
[31:00] is your name,
[31:05] Jesus,
[31:09] lamb of God,
[31:12] worthy
[31:14] is your name.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a second verse.
[31:20] Taking my sis,
[31:26] I bless your name. You are my all.
[31:35] When I fall down, you lift me up. When I
[31:39] am cry, you fill my cup. You are my all
[31:45] in all.
[31:49] Jesus,
[31:53] lamb of God,
[31:57] worthy
[31:58] is your name.
[32:04] Jesus,
[32:08] lamb of God,
[32:12] worthy
[32:13] is.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Sing the chorus once again.
[32:18] Oh Jesus,
[32:23] lamb of God,
[32:27] worthy
[32:29] is your name.
[32:34] Jesus,
[32:38] lamb of God.
[32:42] Worthy
[32:43] is your name.
[32:48] Jesus,
[32:52] lamb of God.
[32:56] Worthy
[32:58] is your name.
[33:03] Jesus
[33:07] lamb
[33:09] God.
[33:11] Worthy
[33:13] is your name.
[33:17] And we can say worthy is his name.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Melissa, thank you so much.
[33:23] God bless you.
[33:30] Some people can come into church and
[33:32] they just, you know, pick a little flute
[33:34] out of their pocket.
[33:37] The next person packs in a harp and that
[33:40] has to be done a day ahead of time. You
[33:42] you don't do that suddenly. But it's a
[33:44] sweet sound. I can imagine well imagine
[33:47] why David loved it and must have played
[33:51] it skillfully himself. But we're so
[33:54] thankful to the Lord for this day that
[33:56] we are living and are here today. Aren't
[33:59] you glad to be alive?
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Thankful to be free in the house of God.
[34:04] You can just worship him in spirit and
[34:07] in truth. And we want to worship him in
[34:09] spirit and truth.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we appreciate each one of you that
[34:14] are here and having the church full. All
[34:17] those of you that are visiting, many of
[34:19] our people are away, believe it or not.
[34:21] They're visiting elsewhere with family
[34:24] and so on. And we pray that they will be
[34:26] a real light and a testimony as well.
[34:29] It's a a real opportunity, I believe, to
[34:35] show the Christ that is in us.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; The true Christ. And I pray that you
[34:42] will be a blessing wherever you are
[34:44] amongst your friends and family,
[34:47] whatever more. I believe that we can be
[34:50] a very, very powerful light in this dark
[34:54] time that we're in.
[34:57] Amen. It was really uh
[35:01] nice to see our Steven Kemper come back
[35:04] &gt;&gt; and be with us and we we need to hear
[35:08] from him, but I'm sure that'll take
[35:10] probably a week. So, we'll have to try
[35:12] to get that condensed down, but he's had
[35:15] a very fruitful time. Said a time
[35:18] that'll never be forgotten. And uh I'm
[35:21] sure it'll be a blessing to all. So,
[35:23] we'll be able to hear something of of
[35:25] that as well. and what is taking place
[35:28] in Brazil. Well, I'd like to just maybe
[35:31] when we get ready to turn to the word
[35:33] now, we're going to turn to uh Micah the
[35:37] fifth chapter. But while you're turning,
[35:38] I'm going to also if we could sing,
[35:40] brother Rod, I'd like to sing we bless
[35:43] your name. And his name shall be called
[35:48] what? Jesus.
[35:51] His name shall be called Jesus. He'll be
[35:54] Emmanuel, but his name shall be called
[35:57] Jesus. For he shall save his people from
[36:00] their sins.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, sir.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; If that announcement hadn't been made,
[36:06] you wouldn't be here this morning.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God for that announcement.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:17] Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[36:20] shall save his people from their sins.
[36:24] That was his purpose.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And it's not an idol little piece of
[36:29] history. It's a reality today.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's sing it together.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.
[36:41] I bless your name.
[36:45] I give you.
[36:53] You are
[36:56] the truth.
[37:00] I bless your name.
[37:04] I bless your name.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; And together we bless your name.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[37:12] We bless your name.
[37:16] We give you
[37:21] praise.
[37:35] We bless your name
[37:39] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed.
[37:42] Father, we are here today to bless your
[37:44] name.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have a service.
[37:49] Not here to celebrate a season of the
[37:51] year. Not here to listen to a man or to
[37:57] hear just singing. But we are here that
[38:00] you might be praised. Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; You may be exalted.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; And Lord, when your announcement, when
[38:08] the announcement was made, there was
[38:10] singing as your prophet said, the first
[38:13] Noel was sang by angels. How they sung
[38:17] and praised the name of Jesus Christ and
[38:22] how heaven broke loose at the very at
[38:26] the very thought, the very beginning of
[38:28] redemption. And oh God, I pray that
[38:31] today you'll cause all of these things
[38:33] to be a reality to us. I pray that every
[38:36] heart will be loosed, Lord.
[38:39] And that true praise will be within our
[38:42] hearts to you. I pray that you will make
[38:45] known your word. Reveal yourself to us
[38:48] in this time, oh God. We're not here to
[38:51] study history. We're here to speak of a
[38:53] Christ that's living amongst his people,
[38:57] doing things, doing for he is the same
[39:00] yesterday, today, and forever. Pray
[39:02] you'll anoint me, oh Lord, the people.
[39:06] And may this be a time that'll be
[39:08] pleasing in your sight. That's all that
[39:10] we desire in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[39:16] We're reading uh just out of Micah 5 and
[39:18] 2 and then I'll read out of Matthew
[39:22] the 2 chapter.
[39:26] Micah 5 and2.
[39:30] But thou Bethlehem
[39:33] Ephraa,
[39:35] though thou be little among the
[39:38] thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
[39:40] shall he come forth unto me, that is to
[39:45] be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth,
[39:50] have been from old, from everlasting.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; You can keep your finger in in Mike if
[39:59] you would because you'll be turning back
[40:00] to it in just a moment. And then we will
[40:03] read from Matthew the 2 chapter
[40:09] and starting at the first verse.
[40:12] Just reading down to verse six.
[40:21] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[40:24] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[40:27] behold, there came wise men from the
[40:30] east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he
[40:33] that is born king of the Jews? For we
[40:36] have seen his star in the east, and are
[40:38] come to worship him." Then Herod the
[40:41] king, When Herod the king had heard
[40:44] these things, he was troubled, and all
[40:47] Jerusalem with him. And when he had
[40:49] gathered all the chief priests and
[40:51] scribes of the people together, he
[40:53] demanded of them where Christ should be
[40:55] born. And they said unto him, "In
[40:58] Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is
[41:01] written by the prophet, and thou
[41:04] Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not
[41:07] the least among the princes of Judah?
[41:11] For out of thee shall come a governor
[41:14] that shall rule my people Israel. May
[41:18] God bless his word to us. You have your
[41:21] saints.
[41:23] If you have kept your Bible open there
[41:26] to Micah,
[41:29] the the original Hebrew. I would like to
[41:33] just read from the original Hebrew
[41:37] because it is uh the Hebrew reads like
[41:40] Chinese does from left to right. I'm
[41:44] sorry, from right to left. And uh uh and
[41:48] then they have it also double phrased
[41:51] the wording on top of each other. That
[41:54] is in the actual uh not necessarily
[41:57] Hebrew language, but in the in the
[42:00] Hebrew that's being translated into
[42:03] English.
[42:05] And I'd like you just to follow these
[42:07] words. And thou Bethlehem
[42:10] Ephraa
[42:12] being least among the thousands of
[42:14] Judah,
[42:15] out of you, to me he shall come.
[42:20] Notice how beautiful that is. Out of
[42:22] you, to me he shall come forth to become
[42:30] to become one ruling in Israel.
[42:34] and his comingings forth.
[42:37] The English in the King James says his
[42:40] goings, but his comingings forth have
[42:43] been from of old, from the days of
[42:47] eternity.
[42:49] Therefore,
[42:52] therefore he will give them over until
[42:54] the time the one giving birth has given
[42:58] birth.
[42:59] That's different from, you know, just
[43:01] slightly different. The emphasis is
[43:03] different. Therefore, he will give them
[43:06] over until the time the one giving birth
[43:09] has given birth. Then the rest of his
[43:13] brothers shall return to the sons of
[43:16] Israel.
[43:18] And he shall stand and pasture us in the
[43:21] strength of Jehovah. Isn't that
[43:23] marvelous? And he shall stand and
[43:26] pasture us.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the in the strength of Jehovah,
[43:31] in the majesty of the name of Jehovah
[43:35] his God. I love that verse. And he shall
[43:39] stand and pasture us. I say, oh God,
[43:41] pasture us this morning.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Feed us in the strength of Jehovah, in
[43:48] the majesty of the name of Jehovah, his
[43:51] God.
[43:53] Amen. Bethlehem,
[43:56] house of bread, house of food. That is
[43:59] what the name means. And brother
[44:02] Brandham went into it in more depth.
[44:06] It took it Bethlehem,
[44:09] the house of God's bread. And it
[44:12] certainly was the house of God's bread.
[44:14] Now, Bethl, he spelled it as Bethl, but
[44:18] Bethlehem, house of bread, house of
[44:21] food. But it became of course the house
[44:24] of God's bread because Jesus Christ was
[44:27] born there. Though you are small,
[44:32] though it was insignificant,
[44:35] though it was unimportant in the eyes of
[44:38] the world, the scripture says, "Yet out
[44:41] of thee." There's a lot of that God
[44:45] takes that's very insignificant.
[44:50] Jeffersonville wasn't very important.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; It's on the lips of millions of people
[44:59] only because of one thing because a word
[45:01] proceeded from there. Otherwise, it
[45:04] would be unknown.
[45:07] What's Cloverdale?
[45:09] Who ever heard of Cloverdale?
[45:12] But it is on the minds of a lot of
[45:14] people and is heard by a lot of people.
[45:17] One of the things Brother Steven Keer
[45:20] just said to me and we only had a few
[45:22] moments but he said we we went into into
[45:26] the jungles of Brazil. He said we went
[45:28] where I thought we're to the end of the
[45:30] world said just to see some few
[45:34] believers there. He says, "You get
[45:36] around them and say, "Oh, when you get
[45:38] back, you know, greet brother Ed and
[45:40] greet the saints." And it just blew him
[45:42] away. How they didn't even know that
[45:44] these people could be connected with the
[45:46] rest of the world. But, you know, it's
[45:48] an amazing it's amazing connection that
[45:50] we have in the body of Christ. Just an
[45:54] amazing connection that we have. But God
[45:57] does things in uh uh he he does things
[46:00] in a way that is not you know
[46:04] glamorous
[46:06] in some great way. He does things in a
[46:09] very simple way. And so yet out of thee,
[46:15] and thou Bethlehem,
[46:19] though you're least among the princes of
[46:21] Judah,
[46:23] for out of thee shall come a a a
[46:27] governor that'll rule his people. Though
[46:29] thou be little among the thousands of
[46:32] Judah, yet out of thee. And because of
[46:36] that phrase, there's no way to stop it.
[46:39] God doesn't need a lot of words to say
[46:41] something yet out of thee. And that was
[46:44] it. It was going to happen.
[46:46] It doesn't take it doesn't take God a
[46:49] whole lot of uh explaining to do. He
[46:52] doesn't have to. Bethlehem,
[46:55] I want to make just a few statements now
[46:57] because they're going to be important
[46:58] throughout the service. Bethlehem
[47:01] was the ultimate converging
[47:05] of the natural lineage
[47:09] and the spiritual promise which God made
[47:12] regarding redemption, regarding
[47:14] salvation. It was the ultimate
[47:17] converging of those two because now we
[47:20] had according to the lineage Jesus
[47:24] Christ being born and it gives the
[47:26] lineage in Matthew and also in Luke and
[47:29] yet he was virgin born
[47:32] as far as the flesh is concerned there's
[47:35] no tie to the natural lineage but yet
[47:40] God attributed it to Abraham through
[47:45] David and a lot of other people in
[47:47] between,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; There had to be an unbroken lineage.
[47:52] Now, that to me has always been almost
[47:55] mysterious
[47:57] that it was so critical, and we'll touch
[48:00] on Judah after a little bit. And Tamar,
[48:04] how critical it was that Judah's line
[48:07] should continue because Jesus had to be
[48:11] born of the line of the tribe of Judah.
[48:13] It had to be an unbroken line. It could
[48:16] not be broken. And yet the flesh man, he
[48:20] was virgin born. Had nothing to do with
[48:23] that actual flesh seed going on down.
[48:26] But it had to go down because God was
[48:29] attributing his son to that lineage.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And it could not be broken.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; It was it was just as important as
[48:38] anything else. It had to be that way.
[48:41] And the and the the the second was the
[48:44] spiritual promise because God promised I
[48:48] think Abraham is the best example. God
[48:51] promised Abraham, you'll have a son.
[48:54] You're going to have a son. Even though
[48:55] he had Ishmael, that's not the son.
[48:57] You're going to have a son by promise.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; I'm giving it to you. And the one that
[49:04] comes as a product of my promise, that
[49:07] will be the son. And that son came by a
[49:10] natural seed. Isaac came by natural
[49:12] seed. But what was in God's mind was his
[49:16] son coming. And he was giving his his
[49:19] friend, his father in the faith, a son
[49:21] by a natural seed. When it was long past
[49:25] his ability to do so, long past the
[49:28] ability of his wife to conceive. When it
[49:30] was impossible, God gave it to prove it
[49:33] was by promise. that it was not by his
[49:36] own efforts. God has given us given you
[49:40] whatever you possess today spiritually.
[49:43] God has given it to you as a gift. Not
[49:46] because you did anything good, not
[49:48] because you're worthy of it. He did it
[49:50] because he loved you. And that's his
[49:52] promise. Because of his promise. And so
[49:56] in Bethlehem, we have the converging of
[49:59] this natural lineage
[50:04] which actually is only by promise. It's
[50:08] only by promise because God had to
[50:10] promise that lineage and attribute Jesus
[50:13] Christ to that lineage. I hope you can
[50:16] see that. But the second thing was that
[50:18] God had promised redemption.
[50:21] He had promised redemption. And so
[50:23] Christ is this unique person,
[50:27] God in the flesh.
[50:30] He was God,
[50:33] but he had a human body. He was born of
[50:36] a woman and he died on a cross. But God
[50:40] was in Christ,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; He was God, very God.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; And he was man, very man.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; He got tired. He got thirsty. He got
[50:51] hungry. He prosperspired when it was
[50:53] hot. He was man. He was tempted in all
[50:56] points like we are and yet without sin.
[51:00] It had to be that unique being in order
[51:03] to pay the price
[51:05] &gt;&gt; for our sin.
[51:08] Why little Bethlehem? In that message,
[51:10] the prophet said, "Now we see this
[51:12] little Bethlehem yet being unnoticed."
[51:15] I'm coming to a very important phrase
[51:18] here. a little place not noticed too
[51:22] much by the outside world
[51:25] and just uh a smallest of the cities.
[51:28] Nobody paid any attention to it. But yet
[51:32] God in his purpose that there's there's
[51:35] where all these things would happen. And
[51:39] he said, "And the spiritual," now the
[51:41] spiritual mind would pick that up
[51:43] because the prophet said,
[51:46] "Thou Bethlehem of Judea, out of thee
[51:50] art, art thou not the least among the
[51:54] princes, but out of thee shall come a
[51:56] governor that shall rule my people
[51:58] Israel?"
[52:00] And then he breaks in and says, "The
[52:02] prophet, the mind of the prophet found
[52:06] it." Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Now, that was in the mind of God.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; It had not been written anywhere.
[52:13] The prophet spoke it, but where was it
[52:15] before the prophet spoke it? Where was
[52:18] that? But thou Bethlehem of Judea, who
[52:22] selected that city? Where was it
[52:24] selected? In the mind of God, a little
[52:27] insignificant place. God knew before the
[52:31] foundation of the world there'd be a
[52:33] city, a little place unnoticed.
[52:36] insignificant, unimportant,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; had no great heritage, had nothing to
[52:42] boast about. It was just a a humble, we
[52:46] could say it was the symbol of humility.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; And that place, God chose that place.
[52:52] And so that's in the mind of God. And
[52:55] centuries go by and a prophet catches
[52:59] it.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll tell you what friends,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care how great a person might
[53:06] be, how educated they might be. Unless
[53:09] unless that pro unless God sends a
[53:12] prophet, you will not find those things
[53:14] in the mind of God that God has reserved
[53:16] in his mind. Only a prophet can pick
[53:19] them up.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; God will reveal nothing except he
[53:23] reveals it first to his servants of
[53:25] prophets. That's exactly the way it is.
[53:27] And people today, they get in their high
[53:30] society and high fluting ways and and
[53:32] all of their theology and educating and
[53:34] all these things think they're going to
[53:36] bypass that. You'll never bypass that.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; You'll never discover it. You can study
[53:41] till you're till you're skin and bones.
[53:45] You can study till you don't have any
[53:46] brain cells left. You'll never discover
[53:49] these things. And the mind of the
[53:51] prophet caught it.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Thank God he caught it. Hallelujah.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; But thou Bethlehem of Judea,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; though thou art the least
[54:03] &gt;&gt; of the cities, yet out of thee, yet out
[54:06] of thee, yet out of thee, shall rise,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; a governor that will rule his people,
[54:13] Israel.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Bethlehem, this symbol of humility.
[54:24] Now, it's it's startling really. It's
[54:27] troubling that what was once in the mind
[54:29] of God
[54:31] has been so glamorized today
[54:35] until what God thought is
[54:36] unrecognizable.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; We sing songs about it and all the rest
[54:42] of it, but the world takes what God
[54:46] finally uttered and what was in his
[54:48] mind. The prophet caught it, brought it
[54:50] down, wrote it in the book. Now the
[54:53] world gets a hold of it. The world
[54:56] polishes it up. And Bethlehem is not the
[54:59] insignificant place it once was.
[55:02] Bethlehem has been glamorized. And and
[55:04] you ought to see the structures that
[55:06] have been built and the church of the
[55:09] nativity and all of these gorgeous uh
[55:13] extravagance and places that have been
[55:16] built over where they feel Christ was
[55:19] born and and and he's not there.
[55:22] friends.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; It's not where he is.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Today we say the celebration of Christ's
[55:30] birth is one of parties,
[55:34] revalry,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; extravagance,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; uh, consumerism,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; all the advertising,
[55:44] &gt;&gt; and the prophet uses the word brother
[55:46] Brandham uses often, tinsel. Yeah,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; tinsel
[55:51] &gt;&gt; is a showy decoration according to the
[55:54] encyclopedia. A showy decoration
[55:58] that is basically valueless
[56:02] &gt;&gt; tinsel,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; something that's showy,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; something that catches the eyes,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; something that catches the attention of
[56:11] the people, but is valueless. And he
[56:15] takes it not from just the commercial
[56:17] world but the prophet spells spends his
[56:21] most of time on what the church and the
[56:24] organized church has done with not only
[56:27] Christmas but with religion
[56:30] &gt;&gt; has taken the truth of God's word. This
[56:33] also this whole word was in God's mind
[56:37] at one time and and the prophets caught
[56:40] it
[56:42] &gt;&gt; and spoke it. It was scribed and written
[56:46] down and for the for the generations to
[56:49] have and the Holy Spirit came and
[56:51] reveals it in its season.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; But the mind of God can't get it. He
[56:57] gets what is he he he gets what should
[57:00] be the present and puts it in the past.
[57:02] He gets what's happening and things are
[57:04] still in the future. He doesn't know
[57:06] it's being fulfilled. And they go to all
[57:08] their all their training and all their
[57:10] theology and all this. Thank God that
[57:12] we're not under some theological system.
[57:15] Thank God that the prophet caught what
[57:17] was happening today. Spiritual food in
[57:20] due season. The mighty God unveiled. Now
[57:23] we're in the third exodus at this time.
[57:26] Thank God we know those things.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be terrible to be remaining
[57:30] in darkness?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; The mind of God catches it. But the but
[57:34] the world oh all the great systems be be
[57:39] you know gathering together and the
[57:41] ecumenical things and the great unions
[57:43] that are taking place and it's so
[57:45] glamorized.
[57:47] The gospel today has been so glamorized.
[57:51] It's just unbelievable.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; So glamorized.
[57:56] It's a show. Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; TV evangelist show.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Just one show after another.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; We're not here today for a show,
[58:08] friends.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We're here to hear the truth.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; A showy decoration
[58:20] that is basically valless.
[58:23] All the tinsel
[58:25] of self-promotion.
[58:28] That's what tinsel is. All the tinsel of
[58:31] self-promotion.
[58:33] And we think of
[58:37] really the way it came.
[58:39] He spoke in uh why little Bethlehem. I
[58:43] said why was it Bethlehem? Is my text
[58:45] today. Why was it Bethlehem?
[58:49] He refers to in the days of Noah. He
[58:52] chose a farmer.
[58:55] In the days of Moses, he took a runaway
[58:58] slave.
[59:00] David out of the backside of the field
[59:04] of the wilderness of the being a
[59:07] shepherd out in the shepherd with the
[59:10] sheep in the sheepyard, a ruddy, scrawny
[59:14] looking little boy. But as soon and when
[59:17] Samuel was sent to Jesse's house and the
[59:21] the elder brother came would have made a
[59:23] fine king. He looked good. He was the
[59:26] one that Samuel thought surely this is
[59:29] him. No, it wasn't him. Goes through all
[59:32] the sons.
[59:34] They're all gone. Is this all you have?
[59:38] Oh, yeah. No, we have another one.
[59:42] Little one. He's out in the sheepyard.
[59:43] He's with the sheep. the unrecognized
[59:46] one.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; The one that didn't carry himself like a
[59:49] king,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; a little boy with a slingshot.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, "As soon as David fell into
[1:00:00] the eyes of Samuel," I like the way he
[1:00:02] said that. As soon as David fell into
[1:00:05] the eyes of Samuel, he said the anointed
[1:00:09] prophet, he poured the oil upon his head
[1:00:12] and run to meet and said, "This is the
[1:00:14] one that God has chose."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; It's not tinsel always of the world.
[1:00:21] It's God's choosing.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; By grace,
[1:00:28] he chose you. By grace he chose me.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Wasn't because we had any tinsel to
[1:00:38] offer, nothing fancy to present him, but
[1:00:43] just by grace. In fact is if we go back,
[1:00:48] no doubt you've said at some point in
[1:00:49] your life and experience, why did he
[1:00:52] choose me?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; There really wasn't anything there. And
[1:00:57] even to this day and even to this
[1:01:00] morning
[1:01:02] in prayer, I just said to the Lord, if
[1:01:05] it depended on if it depends on us as an
[1:01:09] individual, what do I have that you
[1:01:12] would even want? What do we have? I tell
[1:01:16] you then then it is as
[1:01:19] as Melissa played
[1:01:22] song Amazing Grace.
[1:01:25] How sweet is that sound
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch
[1:01:31] like me.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And when we go back see our wretched
[1:01:36] lost state, we wonder why God even
[1:01:40] stooped down to save us.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; It was his choosing,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; his election,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; his predestinated plan, and outside of
[1:01:50] that there is no possibility.
[1:01:52] Hallelujah. This whole thing's of God.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Man gets a hold of it and he makes it
[1:01:59] pretty, tries to, you know, make it
[1:02:03] fancy. And we have it everywhere.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; We have it absolutely everywhere. But he
[1:02:09] said God takes the simple things to
[1:02:12] identify himself through.
[1:02:16] And as brother Brandham refers and he
[1:02:17] was speaking that message in Phoenix
[1:02:20] speaking to the glamour of the church
[1:02:22] systems and how they had organized
[1:02:25] themselves around the source of the word
[1:02:28] and today in Israel there'll be great
[1:02:30] things happening around the church of
[1:02:32] the nativity and all those things and
[1:02:34] you can't even recognize
[1:02:37] what really the scriptures talked about.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; You go down to the shopping mall, you
[1:02:41] can't even recognize what it's all
[1:02:43] about. Right.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And a lot of the churches within this
[1:02:47] country and whatever more, you wouldn't
[1:02:49] even be able to recognize what the true
[1:02:51] story is all about because they don't
[1:02:53] even want to take it. In our nations,
[1:02:56] Christian nation, Christian
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and deny you the right to. They don't
[1:03:02] want to even say Christmas. And even
[1:03:03] Christmas isn't a correct word.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; This is a birth of Christ. And we know
[1:03:08] he wasn't born at this time.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Even science will tell you that. But I
[1:03:14] won't bother getting into that. But the
[1:03:16] nations of the world are bending to the
[1:03:20] will
[1:03:21] of Rome itself
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and their desires at this time.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Just a few days ago,
[1:03:30] the Palestinian leaders
[1:03:33] presented the pope, this present pope,
[1:03:37] with a passport from Bethlehem.
[1:03:40] And I'd like to just read how it took
[1:03:42] place.
[1:03:43] The Palestinian Authority turned to the
[1:03:46] Pope on Saturday to back a new Arab
[1:03:50] state with Jerusalem as its capital. And
[1:03:53] last week, the Palestinian Authority
[1:03:56] addressed the European unity,
[1:04:00] which ignores Jerusalem status as a
[1:04:04] unified Israeli city.
[1:04:08] And Muhammad Abbas, chairman of the
[1:04:11] Palestinian Authority,
[1:04:14] invited Pope Benedict to visit Jerusalem
[1:04:18] and Bethlehem after meeting with Italian
[1:04:21] officials on Friday. He asked them to
[1:04:24] host an international peace conference
[1:04:27] according to its Italian envoy,
[1:04:31] Nemer Hammad.
[1:04:34] And they said, and we quote, "You'll be
[1:04:37] very welcome." They said to the pope,
[1:04:39] "You'll be very welcome in Jerusalem and
[1:04:41] the holy places." Abus told the pope
[1:04:44] during a 20-minute private audience
[1:04:49] by specifically mentioning Jerusalem,
[1:04:51] which is under full Israeli control.
[1:04:54] Abbus was making a clear political
[1:04:57] statement.
[1:05:00] Abbus as part of a public relations
[1:05:03] effort to support its demand that
[1:05:05] Jerusalem be the capital of a new Arab
[1:05:10] state. He told the pope, "If we can't
[1:05:14] hold, notice this, if we can't hold
[1:05:17] democratic elections in Jerusalem,
[1:05:21] it will be difficult to do it in the
[1:05:23] other zones."
[1:05:25] So he's saying if you can't and all of
[1:05:27] these nations are supposed to be
[1:05:29] democratic. If we can't be democratic in
[1:05:32] Jerusalem they want to vote for
[1:05:34] democracy as to who rules the city.
[1:05:37] Notice how cunning that is. I don't know
[1:05:39] if you're catching that
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; but that is a very very cunning.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Actually many leaders have gotten in
[1:05:46] leaders who have taken nations down a
[1:05:48] wrong road but they got in by a vote.
[1:05:53] And you know what the prophet spoke
[1:05:54] about? The vote in America
[1:05:57] got to a woman's vote
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; and voted the wrong man.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And they go on to say
[1:06:07] the radio Palestinian Authority network
[1:06:11] reported that his holiness Pope Benedict
[1:06:15] received a Bethlehem passport. That's
[1:06:18] what I wanted to come to. received a
[1:06:20] Bethlehem
[1:06:22] passport
[1:06:24] from the president
[1:06:27] and it becomes he becomes the first new
[1:06:31] citizen of Bethlehem following the
[1:06:34] launch of open Bethlehem. A it was a
[1:06:39] launch of open Bethlehem and
[1:06:41] international campaign
[1:06:43] to save the city. And however, the
[1:06:46] Palestinian leader said that the
[1:06:48] document uh he said the document, he
[1:06:52] denied that the document was actually a
[1:06:53] passport, but the radio reported they
[1:06:56] gave the pope a passport. He'd be the
[1:07:00] first citizen
[1:07:02] of the new Bethlehem.
[1:07:05] I thought how
[1:07:08] perverted
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; it can really become
[1:07:13] when the first citizen of Bethlehem was
[1:07:17] none other than Jesus Christ, the real
[1:07:19] citizen of Bethlehem.
[1:07:21] Why little Bethlehem? He said, "We see
[1:07:24] these types in the Philistine council of
[1:07:28] churches now organizing garrisons
[1:07:31] everywhere around our Bethlehem." Our
[1:07:36] Bethlehem, friends, is not a place of
[1:07:39] city, a city of of stones and bricks and
[1:07:44] mortar. That's not or the Church of the
[1:07:47] Nativity or any other building. Our
[1:07:49] Bethlehem is where the bread of God
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; comes from.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He says around this Christmas they're
[1:08:00] garrisoned around everywhere. It's all
[1:08:02] decorated up with worldly tinsel because
[1:08:06] the world had garrisoned and Satan is
[1:08:10] behind it. Garrisoned himself around the
[1:08:14] around the very source of the word.
[1:08:16] Believe it or not, look, you see the
[1:08:19] prophet
[1:08:21] actually uh being invited
[1:08:25] and being given opportunity to speak and
[1:08:29] people wanting just exactly like it was
[1:08:31] in the time of Jesus, wanting to hear
[1:08:33] his words and wanting to see the
[1:08:35] marvelous works and wanting to see some
[1:08:37] sign and yet garrisoning themselves,
[1:08:41] being garrisoned around so that it could
[1:08:44] not break out. They didn't want they
[1:08:47] didn't want the the gospel of Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ says, "Where is he that's born
[1:08:53] king of the Jews? Where is he?" So I
[1:08:55] might go right away. There's someone
[1:08:57] there to try to stamp it out
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; immediately. They want to destroy it
[1:09:02] immediately because it's not a physical
[1:09:04] thing. It's a spiritual thing.
[1:09:11] And he says, "There it is today,
[1:09:13] Christmas again to keep us from the
[1:09:17] promise of the word, but it shall be
[1:09:20] fulfilled." And I want to say amen to
[1:09:23] that. It shall be fulfilled. Everything
[1:09:25] that's been spoken concerning our time
[1:09:28] shall be fulfilled. God's able of these
[1:09:32] stones to raise up children to Abraham.
[1:09:35] God's able to do whatever he needs to
[1:09:37] do. He says, "And always trying to keep
[1:09:40] the real true Bethlehem dwellers away
[1:09:44] from eternal life." And that's their
[1:09:47] purpose. That's their intent.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; There is all kinds of intent today. I
[1:09:52] mean, I'm not just going to I'm not
[1:09:54] speaking about the little
[1:09:55] commercialization of of of Christmas.
[1:09:59] That's very small compared to what's
[1:10:01] really happening. Spiritually speaking,
[1:10:04] there's every demon in hell that wants
[1:10:07] to keep you from the word of God.
[1:10:09] Working through every possible device
[1:10:11] that he has available to him. He will
[1:10:14] use every possible means to keep you
[1:10:17] from the truth of God's word.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Everything physically, emotionally, in
[1:10:22] every other way.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He'll try to distract and try to uh h
[1:10:27] have us distracted off to something
[1:10:28] else. And so likewise,
[1:10:31] Bethlehem was in the promise of the
[1:10:34] prophecy.
[1:10:36] Why did he take why did he take
[1:10:39] Bethlehem? It seemed like there would
[1:10:41] have been greater places and better
[1:10:43] places. And brother Brandham talks about
[1:10:46] the cities of refuge, Ramoth Gilead and
[1:10:50] other cities and Jerusalem, the great
[1:10:53] proud capital. He said, "Why weren't
[1:10:55] they chosen?
[1:10:58] Why didn't God choose something uh you
[1:11:00] know that was perhaps more sophisticated
[1:11:03] and more organized and more set up and
[1:11:06] people more qualified to even take and
[1:11:09] send this message out. When I was with
[1:11:11] brother Brandham he said you know he had
[1:11:13] just been to Oral Roberts uh and visited
[1:11:16] him in Tulsa and he and he was just
[1:11:18] amazed. He said the the organization
[1:11:22] that they have and the system that they
[1:11:24] have and the great hospital and the
[1:11:26] prayer tower and all these things and
[1:11:28] and he just said he said I don't know
[1:11:31] what I'd do if I had that kind of thing
[1:11:33] to try to support and keep going.
[1:11:36] He says you should see my office
[1:11:39] and sometime later I've been in that
[1:11:41] office. It's a little desk, little
[1:11:44] chair.
[1:11:46] It's like Bethlehem.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] Look what come out of it.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Look what come out of it.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; How many other messages I'm talking
[1:11:56] about? Not messages of of the message we
[1:11:59] have, but how many other sounds
[1:12:02] of voices is there today?
[1:12:06] And I go down the road and we may be
[1:12:09] listening to a tape and I just say, "How
[1:12:11] many how many ministers around the world
[1:12:15] have there been that are all gone now?
[1:12:17] They're gone. But how many are being
[1:12:19] listened to like this voice? How many
[1:12:22] are being listened to with such earnest,
[1:12:24] fervent minds and spirits? How many are
[1:12:27] so devoted and are receiving what we're
[1:12:31] receiving? I tell you what, friends.
[1:12:35] It's a great thing that God has done for
[1:12:37] us.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Great thing that God has done. Brother
[1:12:41] Bram says, "Why wasn't it Shiloh? Why
[1:12:43] wasn't it Gilgal? Why wasn't it, you
[1:12:45] know, one of these other great places,
[1:12:48] the great proud capital, but it had to
[1:12:50] be Bethlehem of Judah. Now, I just want
[1:12:53] to go back a wee bit, and I appreciate
[1:12:56] your patience this morning.
[1:12:59] Joshua, in dividing up the land, he gave
[1:13:02] a little spot to Judah.
[1:13:05] I've got to go back to lay all of this
[1:13:07] foundation. gave a little spot to Judah
[1:13:10] and it was just a little place he said
[1:13:12] that they give to the tribe of Judah.
[1:13:15] Now he says try to catch this. That's
[1:13:18] what I'm asking you to do today. Just
[1:13:20] try to catch this. When Israel crossed
[1:13:23] over into the land, the promised land,
[1:13:27] just as they crossed over into the
[1:13:28] promised land, there was a gentile woman
[1:13:33] that we know as Rahab the harlot. She's
[1:13:36] connected with it right away. a gentile
[1:13:39] is connected with it. And she asked for
[1:13:42] mercy and she received it.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; She received mercy. She received mercy
[1:13:48] as long as she stayed under the scarlet
[1:13:50] cord, the token.
[1:13:52] And that's the only way she could have
[1:13:55] mercy. It was a sign, a token that was
[1:13:58] given her. And you and I have that token
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; today. We have that sign, that token.
[1:14:06] And then this Rahab after she was she
[1:14:10] was spared, she got all her people in.
[1:14:13] Everything that was under the cord was
[1:14:16] saved. So I'd like to just make a
[1:14:18] statement now that the Gentile bride
[1:14:21] recognized the token and thus became
[1:14:24] inseparable from the act of redemption.
[1:14:28] She recognized the Gentile bride and I'm
[1:14:31] referring to this one now. recognized
[1:14:35] the token.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; She recognized the token. She listened
[1:14:40] and heard heeded the call of the
[1:14:42] messengers.
[1:14:44] She recognized the token. She did what
[1:14:47] she was supposed to do with the token.
[1:14:49] And because of that, she herself
[1:14:52] personally became inseparable in the
[1:14:55] plan of redemption. She became involved
[1:14:58] and part of their whole redemptive
[1:15:00] process.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Don't lose that.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; If you have received
[1:15:10] by a supernatural act of God where he
[1:15:13] opens up the mind of the understanding
[1:15:15] and you have a a revelation by the Holy
[1:15:18] Spirit of God of the what the token is,
[1:15:21] not some chemistry 2,000 years ago,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; but a bleeding word today. Why is it
[1:15:27] bleeding? Because it's crucified again.
[1:15:29] Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; It's in the same world that crucified
[1:15:32] our Lord Jesus Christ. The word has
[1:15:34] always been hated, rejected, and that's
[1:15:37] why it had to be little Jerusale
[1:15:40] Bethlehem.
[1:15:41] God chose the insignificant place for
[1:15:45] there for the word to come forth. And
[1:15:47] where the word came forth, the word is
[1:15:49] just the word in flesh just barely
[1:15:52] coming. And right away there's a
[1:15:54] slaughter of the innocents.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Right away he's having to flee.
[1:15:59] because it's always been rejected and
[1:16:02] hated. And when the prophet was speaking
[1:16:04] even in the why was it little Jerusalem
[1:16:07] or why was it little Bethlehem rather
[1:16:09] he's standing right there with such
[1:16:12] opposition
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; right in the midst of opposition and
[1:16:16] he's saying and our Bethlehem today and
[1:16:18] they're garrisoned around it and trying
[1:16:21] to keep us from the word but it will
[1:16:23] come it will be fulfilled and even
[1:16:26] though he was with all of that
[1:16:27] opposition and all of that theology and
[1:16:30] all of the great doctors of divinity and
[1:16:33] all the rest of it. He knew
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; that there'd be some gentile warriors
[1:16:37] that would rise up and cut through the
[1:16:39] enemy forces and bring the king a fresh
[1:16:42] drink of water.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; He knew it would happen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, friends, it
[1:16:49] brings great joy to the heart of our
[1:16:51] Lord Jesus. Not only to know that the
[1:16:53] price was paid and that he had faithful
[1:16:56] servants down through the generations
[1:16:58] and a faithful messenger at this time,
[1:17:01] but that a people would rise up
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; as a result of that and say, "We are
[1:17:06] part. We are part of those gentile
[1:17:09] warriors. We're part. We have heard that
[1:17:11] word
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; and we're committed to that word."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; This isn't some Sunday school picnic.
[1:17:20] This isn't some Christmas celebration.
[1:17:23] This is when real men and women have
[1:17:25] been called, I tell you, by a by a
[1:17:28] sovereign God.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And see also she became inseparable.
[1:17:37] She became inseparable from redemption.
[1:17:40] Rahab did. And she became inseparable
[1:17:44] from Bethlehem. Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; She's inseparable from Bethlehem because
[1:17:51] she became one named in Genesis in
[1:17:55] Matthew 1 and1. She became named in the
[1:17:59] first chapter of Matthew as one of the
[1:18:02] mothers of Israel
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; that brought forth a lineage.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to stay with me. I told
[1:18:08] you I was going to I want to really get
[1:18:09] into it this morning. And please stay
[1:18:11] with me.
[1:18:12] And the prophet goes into it because he
[1:18:15] says, "And she stayed under that token."
[1:18:18] He says, "And then we understand by
[1:18:20] history that she courted." A lot of
[1:18:23] this, you know, but I need to have it in
[1:18:24] the in the for today's background. She
[1:18:27] courted some general in Israel's army
[1:18:30] and she finally married this man and
[1:18:33] they settled up here near this little
[1:18:35] place and her son uh her husband was
[1:18:40] Solomon and was the he was the one who
[1:18:43] founded Bethlehem.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Now we've got a a a gentile woman that
[1:18:50] was a harlot. Nothing to boast about.
[1:18:53] She has nothing to offer, nothing could
[1:18:56] to contribute.
[1:18:58] She hasn't. What has this horlet got to
[1:19:00] contribute to the lineage of Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ? Zero.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; But by God's choosing,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; God chose her.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And and brought her in and merged her
[1:19:14] into the very lineage of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] I tell you, the bread from heaven
[1:19:20] couldn't come uh without a an incredible
[1:19:23] display of mercy and grace.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And you and I have to realize today
[1:19:31] we're seated here, if we are part of the
[1:19:33] real Bethlehem dwellers, we're seated
[1:19:35] here only because of mercy and grace has
[1:19:38] come to us.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; But she's an integral part
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; of the lineage of Jesus Christ, a harlot
[1:19:46] woman. And we are an integral part of
[1:19:50] the bread of God that has come in this
[1:19:52] hour. Not merely recipients of it, but
[1:19:54] givers of it.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; That's where we're going to be coming
[1:19:57] to.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We're not just receiving end. We're on
[1:20:01] the giving end.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; God has not called you just to be a
[1:20:05] receiver. Take it in. Take it in. Take
[1:20:07] it in. But we're givers of this
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; bread from heaven.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] And he founded says, "And we find out
[1:20:20] that Solomon founded this little city of
[1:20:23] Bethlehem." Look where it had its
[1:20:26] beginnings. No wonder it's
[1:20:28] insignificant.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Solomon happened to live there and
[1:20:32] married
[1:20:34] Rahab.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; The harlot.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And they founded this place
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and it was given by Joshua to Judah. is
[1:20:44] right on the border
[1:20:47] in within Judah. It says, "And and
[1:20:50] Solomon founded the little city of
[1:20:51] Bethlehem, and he begat he begat Boaz.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And Boaz was the one who married Ruth,
[1:21:00] another Gentile."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; This whole thing is inseparable
[1:21:06] from having a gentile bride. And I'm so
[1:21:09] thankful to God, my brothers, my
[1:21:11] sisters, that it's not just natural
[1:21:13] Israel that has us, but God gave access
[1:21:16] to us Gentiles and united us in. We're
[1:21:20] not an afterthought.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We're not an afterthought.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; We're not hitchhikers.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; We're not somebody who just somehow
[1:21:29] found some after some favor, some
[1:21:32] benefit of God. But God in his mind,
[1:21:35] he's even before the very beginning, he
[1:21:38] knew that the Messiah would be born in
[1:21:40] Bethlehem.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; And he and when he even began the
[1:21:46] founding of the city, the founding of
[1:21:49] the place, he said to Joshua, he
[1:21:51] instructed him and under that
[1:21:53] leadership, you'll give it to Judah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And he give that little spot to Judah.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And then and then what? And and then as
[1:22:01] they're coming into the land here, they
[1:22:04] run right into Rahab and the first thing
[1:22:07] to do is give her a token.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I hope you're catching it. And
[1:22:12] here she's given a token
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; and she obeys it
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; and she believes it.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; She has she has no evidence of of
[1:22:21] redemption yet. She has no evidence that
[1:22:24] there's any safety to it. She just
[1:22:26] believes the most foolish thing. It
[1:22:29] looks so foolish. You put this cord in
[1:22:33] the window, this red cord that's in your
[1:22:36] house. You put this in your window and
[1:22:38] somehow your house will be saved. When
[1:22:41] these walls fall down,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; you'll be preserved.
[1:22:47] And I can tell you today, not only the
[1:22:49] walls falling down, I think of the
[1:22:51] morality of this nation. I wonder how in
[1:22:53] the world you young people are going to
[1:22:55] survive. If it wasn't for the token, you
[1:22:58] wouldn't survive.
[1:23:00] There'd be no way to survive. How do you
[1:23:02] men and women survive with your
[1:23:04] families? How do you survive in this
[1:23:06] generation when everything's becoming
[1:23:08] fractured? Everything's becoming so so
[1:23:11] absolutely blown apart. How do you
[1:23:13] survive?
[1:23:15] Only because of the token you survive.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Say amen to God.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. by God's grace
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and his mercy to us. He gave the Gentile
[1:23:29] bride a token and she believed it.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And the token could only come in evening
[1:23:35] time and in this evening time God sends
[1:23:38] his token, his word, his promise, and
[1:23:42] finds a gentile that believes it.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe it? We don't know why
[1:23:49] we believe it. We just believe it
[1:23:51] because a messenger said so. Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; This messenger wasn't just a spy, but
[1:23:58] God in the end times sent a prophet
[1:24:00] messenger.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; And stands behind it.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And there's never been duplicated.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Never been duplicated. Not in the
[1:24:14] history of mankind. And the world will
[1:24:16] answer for it.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; What God sent in this day,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; the whole world will answer for it.
[1:24:22] Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Those religious leaders will answer for
[1:24:27] it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Bishop Stanley who handed the Bible to
[1:24:30] him will answer for it.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; All the Christian businessmen will
[1:24:34] answer for it.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And all those religious leaders that
[1:24:37] turn their people away from it will
[1:24:39] answer for it for turning their people
[1:24:41] away from the token.
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:24:49] And why you believe the token, the
[1:24:52] revealed word of this day,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; we don't know why. You can't give
[1:24:58] explanation.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in Ruth 2 and 4,
[1:25:03] "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem."
[1:25:09] Boaz
[1:25:10] the kinsman redeemer attribute
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; coming from Bethlehem.
[1:25:18] God way back in the book of Ruth saying
[1:25:23] clearly that my attribute of redemption,
[1:25:28] my kinsman redeemer will come out of
[1:25:31] Bethlehem
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; cuz he's showing it back there because
[1:25:34] Boaz was the perfect type. He He acted
[1:25:37] out the kinsman redeemer.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And he redeemed Ruth,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; another gentile, a Moabitete,
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; who has a very dubious history and
[1:25:50] background,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; having come from a nation that was
[1:25:54] birthed out of incest,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; an incestuous relationship,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; but God took her.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, my brother,
[1:26:04] my sister, when God takes a person,
[1:26:06] didn't matter if it's a harlot,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; didn't matter whether it's a moabitete,
[1:26:10] they become perfect in God's sight.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Perfect in God's sight.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And put their names in the lineage of
[1:26:22] Jesus Christ. Four out of the five
[1:26:25] women, only one of them was was the
[1:26:27] Virgin Mary, but the other four Tamar,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Rahab, Ruth and Ba Sheba, which it says
[1:26:35] clearly in Matthew 1, the wife of Urias,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; who had been wife of Urias. And out of
[1:26:43] her came Solomon. And God took those
[1:26:45] four women and and and sold them and
[1:26:48] united them and merged them right into
[1:26:50] the lineage of Jesus Christ, mothers of
[1:26:52] Israel.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; No one can ever understand the grace of
[1:26:58] God.
[1:27:01] And so the attribute of of of the
[1:27:04] kinsman redeemer
[1:27:06] came out of Bethlehem. Boaz came from
[1:27:09] Bethlehem and he spoke to the reapers.
[1:27:14] Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] And the prophet said, "And Naomi
[1:27:19] representing the Orthodox church
[1:27:23] was went on the on the uh went on the
[1:27:26] way on account of a famine and went into
[1:27:29] the land of Moab like the scattering of
[1:27:32] Israel." Israel was completely
[1:27:34] scattered.
[1:27:36] and Naomi went into the land of Moab.
[1:27:43] The gentile church
[1:27:46] says that is that the gentile church
[1:27:48] coming to God just under the barley
[1:27:51] season because she returned with Ruth in
[1:27:55] the barley season. And he said it shows
[1:27:57] a gentile church coming to God just at
[1:28:01] the barley season. Listen friends, this
[1:28:04] move of God, this thing that God has
[1:28:07] drawn you by, this strange move of the
[1:28:11] spirit. Listen, I'd like you to just
[1:28:13] look at your own individual lives for a
[1:28:15] moment. Here you are sitting in a seat
[1:28:17] in this congregation, but where did you
[1:28:19] come from?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Where did you come from?
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Where were you at one time? Where were
[1:28:24] you a few years ago? Where were you? And
[1:28:27] what did you believe? And what were you
[1:28:28] under? And what were you being held by?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what? You're being held
[1:28:34] by in darkness and in confusion and by
[1:28:37] sin and by habits and by demons of hell.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; And God loosed you.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Divinely loosed you.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at some of you here and
[1:28:49] knowing you came into this church, came
[1:28:51] into this message bound, horribly bound.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; A lot of people have been attracted to a
[1:28:59] lot of things,
[1:29:01] but God attracted you to a certain
[1:29:03] sound, a certain voice,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; a certain message.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And that begin to feed your soul.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And it goes on, it says,
[1:29:14] "And they came at the barley season."
[1:29:17] What a beautiful picture.
[1:29:20] And then she and Boaz being married and
[1:29:24] their famous son Oed was begotten there.
[1:29:30] And then his son Jesse his great son.
[1:29:35] Jesse came from Oed.
[1:29:39] And also he begat David his son the king
[1:29:42] David came out
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; all in Bethlehem
[1:29:49] started from nothing started from
[1:29:52] started from Joshua going in with armies
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; but he was anointed to place the tribes
[1:30:00] in a certain place and furthermore the
[1:30:02] prophet traces it further back and says
[1:30:05] that when those women the wives of the
[1:30:07] patriarchs when they were giving birth
[1:30:10] to the children and called out their
[1:30:12] name Ephraim
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; was actually God
[1:30:18] inspiring that mother and placed that
[1:30:21] child's children in the land
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; God
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; it's a car
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Dan
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; and here they were already being placed
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; and out come a child Judah
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; call him Judah and at that time even God
[1:30:37] at that I have the quote right here. God
[1:30:40] at that time giving that placing. It
[1:30:43] wasn't just wasn't just calling that
[1:30:45] child's name
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; because when when uh when the father was
[1:30:51] dying now Jacob and he called his sons
[1:30:54] and he began to tell those sons where
[1:30:56] they would be
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; and what they would do
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; in their future life.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And now here comes Joshua who's doing
[1:31:05] it. Same God. Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; That called them and placed them. Same
[1:31:10] God now placing them. And Joshua places
[1:31:13] Judah in a certain spot
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; where God knew in his mind there would
[1:31:18] come
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; there would come Solomon. There would
[1:31:22] come Oed, Boaz, and Oed and Jesse and
[1:31:25] David and they would be born there
[1:31:27] because God in his mind had selected
[1:31:29] that place that here will be the house
[1:31:33] of my bread.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. here will be the house of
[1:31:37] God's bread.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And David right here at this same little
[1:31:49] Bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of
[1:31:52] God to be the king of Israel.
[1:31:55] And all these spiritual things hid from
[1:31:58] the eyes of the world was happening here
[1:32:02] in this little city of Bethlehem. Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Christ was born. Now he goes on to say,
[1:32:10] "Christ was born in Bethlehem and became
[1:32:13] God's house of eternal life bread.
[1:32:19] He is the bread of life. He is our
[1:32:23] Bethlehem.
[1:32:25] Christ is our Bethlehem."
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Natural bread is called the staff of
[1:32:29] life. God Jesus is God's life staff. I
[1:32:34] love that
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus is God's life staff, a bread of
[1:32:39] life staff for eternal life. And then he
[1:32:43] goes on,
[1:32:46] and this was a blessing to me,
[1:32:50] all true believing sons of God are born
[1:32:54] in Bethlehem
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; with him. Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; If Christ had to become the bread of
[1:33:03] life to be born in Bethlehem, which is
[1:33:06] life's bread house, then everyone
[1:33:10] of true believers in Christ is born in
[1:33:14] Christ, they are born in God's
[1:33:17] Bethlehem.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; then not only was Jesus born in
[1:33:24] Bethlehem,
[1:33:25] he said, I was born in Bethlehem. And
[1:33:29] you were born in Bethlehem.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; How did you do it? Right here in
[1:33:35] Phoenix, he said, "Right here in
[1:33:36] Phoenix, Arizona."
[1:33:39] This morning in the Raada, you can be
[1:33:42] born again in God's Bethlehem
[1:33:45] house of eternal
[1:33:48] bread, life, eat it, and live forever.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] Now
[1:33:57] I hope I'm able to convey this
[1:34:04] without recognizing
[1:34:07] or I will say it's absolutely essential
[1:34:10] absolutely essential to recognize
[1:34:14] the vessel
[1:34:16] that God had chosen to use here. Brother
[1:34:20] Brandham is saying to these people right
[1:34:22] here in Phoenix, Arizona this morning.
[1:34:25] Here they were, you know, in whatever
[1:34:28] year it was right here
[1:34:32] today. And this wasn't just poetic
[1:34:34] license.
[1:34:36] You can be born in Bethlehem.
[1:34:40] And I thought when I heard that, I
[1:34:41] wondered how many were.
[1:34:44] And you know, I would say probably for
[1:34:46] the most part, most were not. Most
[1:34:51] rejected the opportunity to be born with
[1:34:55] Christ in Bethlehem.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that Christ was born,
[1:34:59] you know, maybe 1500 years ago, uh, 1800
[1:35:02] years ago, 1900 years ago, and here's
[1:35:04] the prophet standing there in in
[1:35:06] whatever year this was." Uh I just have
[1:35:09] it here.
[1:35:11] Uh in uh 1963. Yes. So 1900 maybe 63
[1:35:16] years ago. And they say, "Well, Christ
[1:35:18] was born back there. H how how are we
[1:35:20] going to be born?" Or is this just, you
[1:35:22] know, kind of spiritualizing it? Are we
[1:35:25] how are we going to be born there?
[1:35:28] It'll be impossible to be born there in
[1:35:32] Bethlehem. I'm going to say mouthful.
[1:35:35] If they didn't recognize the vessel
[1:35:39] that was speaking the word
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; because this is the two-part. This is
[1:35:44] the two-part. I want you to catch both
[1:35:46] part. One is the physical part. Jesus
[1:35:49] had to come and be a physical man. Jesus
[1:35:52] had to be born in a physical body just
[1:35:54] exactly like you and I. He had to have
[1:35:56] that physical part but within him was
[1:35:59] God.
[1:36:01] Now he was born a virgin born without
[1:36:03] sin
[1:36:04] but re through the redemption process he
[1:36:07] would bring his children every one of
[1:36:10] them born in sin
[1:36:12] everyone born in sin and that would be
[1:36:14] the human part and within that whole
[1:36:17] body he has apostles and prophets
[1:36:20] teachers evangelists and helps and all
[1:36:23] kinds of order and he has deacons and he
[1:36:26] has trustees and he has
[1:36:29] sons sons and daughter.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you, nothing can be closer to the
[1:36:34] heart of God than his sons and his
[1:36:36] daughters. And they're they're they're
[1:36:39] he gave them a body and they have a
[1:36:41] human. But in them
[1:36:43] in them
[1:36:45] is this same spirit that brought the
[1:36:48] whole the whole lineage, the whole
[1:36:52] genealogies up brought it's the same
[1:36:56] spirit that directed Joshua. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that directed him and
[1:37:01] says Judah will be here.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That same spirit moved all the way down.
[1:37:07] That same spirit was there when it led
[1:37:09] the led the spies and brought them right
[1:37:11] to Rahab's house. That was the same
[1:37:13] spirit. And then she was she was brought
[1:37:16] into the picture. That same spirit, that
[1:37:18] same God that preserved her and
[1:37:20] preserved her whole household. And then
[1:37:23] that same spirit that led the whole
[1:37:25] thing to Naomi. It led her coming back
[1:37:28] in a Yes, sure. There was a famine. She
[1:37:30] lost her husband, lost two sons. She's
[1:37:32] got two daughters in-laws and she's
[1:37:34] going back. It was that same spirit that
[1:37:36] was guiding her back to come at barley
[1:37:38] season. Had to come back at barley
[1:37:40] season. It's that same spirit that led
[1:37:43] Ruth into a field of Boaz and she's
[1:37:45] there gleaning, just trying to get
[1:37:47] enough to survive. that same spirit
[1:37:49] because then here come Boaz and took her
[1:37:52] and united her to himself
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and took her as his wife. That same
[1:37:57] spirit. You see the whole plan of God is
[1:38:01] moving on down through all of these
[1:38:03] natural human events.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, one is one is gleaning grain.
[1:38:10] They're working. You were working this
[1:38:12] last week. You were doing your things,
[1:38:13] doing your duties. They were doing
[1:38:15] theirs. But within it and behind the
[1:38:17] scenes was God himself, God Almighty.
[1:38:21] Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And they had to be brought up as young
[1:38:26] people and as children and they had to
[1:38:28] experience all of their things, but all
[1:38:30] the way down and down through the
[1:38:32] prophets and Israel's movements all
[1:38:34] around. But God God continually
[1:38:37] directing the affairs of the whole
[1:38:40] purpose, his whole purpose, his whole
[1:38:42] scheme. And then we come right down,
[1:38:44] take a quantum leap down to the end
[1:38:45] time. And God now in the end time sends
[1:38:49] a sends a messenger, a vessel,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; just a vessel. Like to be in the
[1:38:55] wilderness, he like to hunt. He dressed
[1:38:56] a certain way, spoke a certain way, had
[1:38:59] a certain accent, born in a certain
[1:39:01] place. All of these things. God is a
[1:39:03] that that's a human part.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; That's the human aspect. That's the
[1:39:08] physical part. But behind that, and this
[1:39:12] you need to see, behind that is Almighty
[1:39:15] God directing the affairs, directing the
[1:39:19] events. And he directed you even when
[1:39:22] you were lost and undone and knew
[1:39:24] nothing about it. And he brought you
[1:39:26] right under a certain sound into a
[1:39:28] certain atmosphere to hear a certain
[1:39:30] thing so that the light could strike
[1:39:33] that seed.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[1:39:39] Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to see that two two parts.
[1:39:45] Now just hold that. It's absolutely
[1:39:48] essential. Now I just say
[1:39:54] maybe people don't like to hear this and
[1:39:56] they certainly wouldn't like to have at
[1:39:58] that time but there was no way for those
[1:40:01] people
[1:40:03] in Phoenix or any other place. There is
[1:40:04] no way for them to receive
[1:40:08] a birth in Bethlehem
[1:40:11] and reject the very voice of the Holy
[1:40:14] Spirit through the messenger that was
[1:40:16] speaking.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And I know a lot thought, "Well, I can
[1:40:20] get it. I don't need him."
[1:40:22] Say, "I can get it anyway."
[1:40:25] That's not so.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; It's not so.
[1:40:30] the human vessel and I'll come into it.
[1:40:34] Now
[1:40:36] I'm coming more now to the
[1:40:40] the hub of the message and I won't be
[1:40:44] long. It'll be another 15 20 minutes.
[1:40:50] Now Jesus said
[1:40:53] that he was the bread
[1:40:56] that came down from heaven. And I
[1:40:59] thought a great deal about that.
[1:41:03] He was the bread that came down from
[1:41:04] heaven. The bread of God. He calls it
[1:41:07] the bread of God. Came down from heaven.
[1:41:10] How did it come down?
[1:41:14] How' the bread come down?
[1:41:17] Because he said, listen close.
[1:41:23] and the bread which I will give is my
[1:41:25] body.
[1:41:29] And that was the very thing they
[1:41:30] stumbled over and that's the very thing
[1:41:31] that brother Brandon refers to all the
[1:41:33] time because when he said that except he
[1:41:35] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[1:41:37] that's where they turned away
[1:41:39] because they couldn't grasp it. It's not
[1:41:41] something we can just take and think
[1:41:42] about and you know consider it if we
[1:41:45] wish to consider it. We need to consider
[1:41:46] it. What is it that we're actually
[1:41:48] eating? What is it that we actually how
[1:41:51] did this bread come down from heaven?
[1:41:56] It came down through the children of the
[1:41:59] promise that believed the word of the
[1:42:03] promise for their day. The bread came
[1:42:07] down from heaven because it's a twofold.
[1:42:12] It had to have the natural lineage.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; It had to have it. Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Even though Jesus was going to be born
[1:42:22] of a virgin, that virgin had to be
[1:42:24] connected to a certain specific lineage,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; a certain tie.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Going to get in a little deep water
[1:42:32] here, but I I hope it'll be all right.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; It had to have that natural. In other
[1:42:38] words, here we are in the physical. You
[1:42:40] know, we may think, "Oh, the physical
[1:42:42] doesn't matter about anything." So, just
[1:42:43] a second. It's the only body gave you.
[1:42:46] It's the only body that God gave you.
[1:42:48] And he caused you to be born, where you
[1:42:50] were born, and to whom you were born.
[1:42:52] And when God selects you by coming by
[1:42:54] the Holy Spirit, that's God's doing. We
[1:42:57] have nothing to say about that. And
[1:42:59] where you were born and how you were
[1:43:01] born, what family you were born, what
[1:43:02] color your eyes or your hair or the
[1:43:04] shape of you or color your skin or
[1:43:06] anything, that has nothing to do with
[1:43:09] nothing to do with with us. That's God's
[1:43:11] choosing.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; God chose these things.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And it had to be that way. You could not
[1:43:21] be someone else.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's a foolish
[1:43:25] statement." But we act that way a lot of
[1:43:27] times.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; We act that way as though it it didn't
[1:43:30] make any difference to God, whether it's
[1:43:31] me or somebody else. It does.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; It makes a very very big difference to
[1:43:36] God. And and in the sovereign God
[1:43:38] choosing, he chooses precisely that
[1:43:41] person. In other words, if I said to
[1:43:43] you, you could have been Rahab or
[1:43:44] somebody else. It could not have been.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; She probably wasn't the only harlot in
[1:43:49] the country, but it had to be her
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; and only her.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And she had a heart to believe it.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; So, there's a emerging even within the
[1:43:57] individual. Some of you that are
[1:43:59] standing here right today or sitting
[1:44:00] here today, you probably don't even know
[1:44:02] why you believed when you heard the
[1:44:04] message. Right?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; You probably don't can't give a good
[1:44:10] answer why you believed it. If you had
[1:44:12] to scientifically say why you believed
[1:44:14] it, I don't know. Because faith doesn't
[1:44:16] operate by reasoning. It just says, "I
[1:44:18] don't know, but I believed it."
[1:44:25] And so the bread came down from heaven
[1:44:29] through the children of the promise that
[1:44:32] believed the word of promise for their
[1:44:36] day. They had to believe what they
[1:44:37] believe for their day. And secondly, by
[1:44:40] believing they were instruments in the
[1:44:44] hand of God to bring forth Jesus Christ,
[1:44:48] the bread of eternal life. They played
[1:44:52] an integral part of bringing forth Jesus
[1:44:56] Christ. Even though after it was all
[1:44:58] over and Joseph is on the scene and he
[1:45:01] takes Mary to wife, she's found pregnant
[1:45:06] of the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; which has nothing to do with him or his
[1:45:10] seed.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But yet that lineage was so
[1:45:16] vital
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; that this Bible could not have been
[1:45:20] written without that lineage being what
[1:45:23] it was. If you went to Matthew the first
[1:45:26] chapter, second chapter and go to Luke,
[1:45:29] you cannot. This is the whole word of
[1:45:32] God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet says you got to see Christ
[1:45:34] in every verse.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; In every verse.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; In every verse.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; That lineage is an absolute absolute
[1:45:47] perfect will and plan of God. It
[1:45:49] couldn't be any other way. Amen.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; If you can see the strength of that that
[1:45:54] is that's a powerful truth and a
[1:45:57] powerful statement.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Even though at the end at the end of it
[1:46:01] God sovereignly and God in his own great
[1:46:04] wisdom which he has to undo the original
[1:46:08] sin and that could not be done by any
[1:46:10] man born in sin.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be done with anybody by that
[1:46:15] lineage. But God brought the lineage on.
[1:46:18] God gave life to the individuals. And so
[1:46:21] God had to make a way. He had to pay the
[1:46:24] sentence of his own sentence. He that
[1:46:26] eateth that will die in the day you eat
[1:46:28] there that will die. And that came all
[1:46:31] the way down. But God sees redemption.
[1:46:34] And he's showing the he's showing
[1:46:35] redemption. He's showing the token. He's
[1:46:37] showing the Exodus. He's bringing it all
[1:46:39] the way down. All the way down. And then
[1:46:41] at the end, it's like a gap, a break.
[1:46:43] And and because she's conceived, it's a
[1:46:46] virgin that conceives.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; And there's no natural seed there that
[1:46:49] bridges that. None at all. What bridges
[1:46:52] it is the word of God that says I
[1:46:55] attribute all that he is to this line of
[1:46:58] people.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I attribute everything that he is. He's
[1:47:03] bread. They're bread.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's my son. They're my
[1:47:08] sons.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Everything he was
[1:47:14] God bridged that gap
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; between the natural lineage and the and
[1:47:18] the and the sovereignty of the virgin
[1:47:20] birth.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Why had that be a little Bethlehem? It
[1:47:25] had to be an insignificant place because
[1:47:26] all the people of God have been in
[1:47:28] humility and insignificant. But God
[1:47:31] bridge that gap by his word.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I will do it
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; and no man can question him.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; You're getting it. Yes.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Now, that's just where I begin.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; That's where I would have liked to
[1:47:47] started preaching, but I had to lead up
[1:47:49] all this all this background so you can
[1:47:52] see where I'm going.
[1:47:55] And that is why
[1:47:59] we can say such a grace
[1:48:01] as it was. We could say Tamar by grace
[1:48:04] was a part and Rahab by grace was a
[1:48:07] part, an inseparable part. Ruth the
[1:48:11] Moabites was a part
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; and Basheba
[1:48:17] was a part of this whole line
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and no one can separate them from having
[1:48:25] a part in bringing forth the bread of
[1:48:27] life.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Now, if Jesus was simply listen close,
[1:48:32] hang on. If Jesus was simply to be born
[1:48:35] of a virgin, why didn't God just pick
[1:48:37] any virgin?
[1:48:39] select a wonderful virgin and have the
[1:48:43] Christ child born by this virgin, not
[1:48:46] connected to anything. She had to be
[1:48:49] connected
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; because God in his own in his own
[1:48:53] sovereign will was determined that all
[1:48:57] of those people back there, now when I
[1:49:00] refer to those back there, remember that
[1:49:02] we can just we can swing into the future
[1:49:04] just as easy. But if we see that because
[1:49:07] that's written in the scripture, then we
[1:49:09] can project that and see it and put
[1:49:11] ourselves in the scripture.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And Tammer had to be a part.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You cannot explain.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You can't explain. I I defy anybody to
[1:49:24] explain how how God could take take that
[1:49:29] woman. It says of Tamar
[1:49:33] was the wife of two sons of Judah
[1:49:37] and Onen.
[1:49:39] Genesis 38:6-30.
[1:49:42] Her importance in the scriptures depends
[1:49:44] on the great anxiety to keep up the
[1:49:47] lineage of Judah who was her
[1:49:49] father-in-law.
[1:49:51] It seems as if the family were on the
[1:49:54] point of extinction.
[1:49:56] And Onen was her first husband. He died.
[1:50:00] On and God smoked him and slew him and
[1:50:02] they had successfively perished
[1:50:05] suddenly.
[1:50:06] Judah's wife Baou
[1:50:09] died and their only remaining child
[1:50:12] Sheila whom Judah was unwilling to trust
[1:50:17] to the dangerous woman or the union with
[1:50:21] this woman. And as it appeared with
[1:50:24] Tamar, because the two sons had died
[1:50:26] already, lest he should meet with the
[1:50:29] same fate as his brothers, accordingly
[1:50:32] she resorted to the desperate act of
[1:50:35] entrapping Judah. She dressed as a
[1:50:38] harlot
[1:50:40] and the father himself.
[1:50:43] She entrapped Judah, the father himself
[1:50:45] into the union which he feared for his
[1:50:48] son.
[1:50:50] The fruits of this intercourse were the
[1:50:54] twins Pharaoh's and Zarah. And through
[1:50:58] Pharaoh's the sacred line was continued.
[1:51:02] The sacred excuse me, the sacred line
[1:51:06] was continued through this whole thing
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; through this act.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; it was. The sacred line was continued
[1:51:16] and placed her over in Matthew 1
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; declaring
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus clearly declaring I'm not ashamed
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; to call Tamar one of my mothers.
[1:51:35] And if he's not ashamed to call her one
[1:51:38] of his mothers, how would he be ashamed
[1:51:40] to call us his brethren,
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; his children?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is,
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, my brother, my sister, we
[1:51:49] haven't we haven't even got a we haven't
[1:51:51] even scratched the surface of the
[1:51:53] meaning of what grace is.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; We haven't even touched it.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; This glorious, amazing grace of God that
[1:52:02] he's shown to us.
[1:52:06] and brought them embraced them and
[1:52:08] brought them in and would say,
[1:52:11] "You're part of bringing this righteous
[1:52:16] loaf called Jesus Christ, the bread of
[1:52:19] God, to his place in Bethlehem."
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; You're part of it, Tamar. You're part of
[1:52:26] it, Rahab.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, they had a memory like you have a
[1:52:31] memory. That's right. They could think
[1:52:32] of everything that happened in their
[1:52:34] life like you can.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; They could think of every act of sin and
[1:52:38] unbelief and whatever more. They could
[1:52:40] think of that too. And the same devil
[1:52:43] that is here today was there back then
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; telling them what kind of life they
[1:52:48] lived.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; But because they believed
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; the promise.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And that's what I had to get across to
[1:52:53] you. Because they believed the promise
[1:52:55] that came to them. They didn't have all
[1:52:58] kinds of books and tapes and CDs and
[1:53:00] MP3s and all the rest of it. They didn't
[1:53:02] have they could download this and
[1:53:04] download that. They just had a little
[1:53:05] promise that maybe came through a a
[1:53:08] messenger, a spy or whatever more and
[1:53:10] said, "Give me a token." Rahab said,
[1:53:13] "You do this and do that and do the
[1:53:15] other thing and you'll be saved."
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And they hung on to that.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; That's what he said and that's what I
[1:53:22] believe.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; By faith are ye saved through grace. and
[1:53:27] that not of yourself. It is the gift of
[1:53:29] God. If you only have that scripture,
[1:53:31] you can make it.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; You don't need volumes and volumes and
[1:53:36] volumes. But look what God has given us.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Look at the volumes he has given us.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, I just feel like I like
[1:53:43] to start preaching at this time. It is
[1:53:45] so glorious.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; And to think that our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:49] would embrace them, those Gentile of the
[1:53:53] past.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If that be the case, he has
[1:53:57] embraced the gentile of the future. He's
[1:53:59] embraced the gentile of this time.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Born in Leodysia.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; We've been born in Leodysia.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; We've been born in Leodysia. And what
[1:54:09] are we going to do?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with that? God
[1:54:13] says, "I'll give you another birth.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; I'll send you another message. And by
[1:54:17] believing the message and the messenger,
[1:54:20] you'll be born again in Bethlehem."
[1:54:24] Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And you will become a house of my bread.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:54:39] God knew exactly where you're going to
[1:54:41] be born.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Now, just let me just digress a moment.
[1:54:44] Hang right on to that.
[1:54:47] Brother Brandon says, "I just spoke
[1:54:48] about a new name. didn't know I was
[1:54:50] going to be on this subject at all.
[1:54:52] Brother Brandham says the name Bethlehem
[1:54:54] and he goes and breaks it down. He says
[1:54:55] sometimes we're inclined to think that a
[1:54:57] name doesn't mean anything. Names mean
[1:54:58] something.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; And he goes and why names were changed
[1:55:01] etc etc. He says and then
[1:55:05] he says and this person that's in you
[1:55:07] listen closely now.
[1:55:09] This person that's in you
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; which is your birth.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:16] this person that's in you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about, you know, the
[1:55:20] John, Susie, Barry, and so on so forth
[1:55:22] that's sitting here. I want to talk now
[1:55:24] about this person that's in you.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; The one I've never seen
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; and the one that's in me that you've
[1:55:30] never seen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about that person where
[1:55:33] they were born.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "You are John Doe. You're born
[1:55:39] in a certain month and you're born under
[1:55:41] a certain star and you're born under a
[1:55:44] certain thing and that has something to
[1:55:46] do with you. It certainly does. Even
[1:55:49] though we're here just in the flesh,
[1:55:51] these carcasses, but when God saw you,
[1:55:54] God saw you issued out into the world
[1:55:56] from your mother's womb.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And God who made all the planets and put
[1:56:01] all the stars in place and everything,
[1:56:03] he had you born at a precise time. Amen.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; He had you born under precise sign
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; and a horoscopes and all of this kind of
[1:56:12] nonsense is just a devil's it's just a
[1:56:14] devil's substitute.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; But God who made everything. He made you
[1:56:20] a certain way. And some are quiet and
[1:56:22] some are boisterous and some are patient
[1:56:24] and some are impatient and and some are
[1:56:27] this and some are that way. And we are
[1:56:29] that way because we've been born under
[1:56:32] certain sign. But listen now. He says,
[1:56:35] "Why did Aaron have on his breastplate
[1:56:38] Aaron the high priest? Why did he have
[1:56:41] on his breastplate
[1:56:43] the birthstone?"
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Of each one of those patriarchs,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; on his breastplate,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; he said, "Look at those mothers when
[1:56:54] they gave the utterance when them
[1:56:57] mothers and the Hebrew women." He's gone
[1:56:59] from the breastplate of of of Aaron. And
[1:57:02] he goes back to the Hebrew mothers
[1:57:05] and in labor giving utterance to those
[1:57:08] children being born. It placed their
[1:57:10] name. It told their birth. It put them
[1:57:14] in their homeland and set them over in
[1:57:17] eternity.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:57:31] Now he says
[1:57:33] Jacob when he was dying and when he laid
[1:57:36] his hands upon the patriarchs and
[1:57:38] blessed them he was telling them exactly
[1:57:41] where they would be
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; and that's according to their name and
[1:57:46] exactly according to their birth and
[1:57:48] sure it has something to do with he said
[1:57:50] now that's your birth path
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; catch this please your birth path that's
[1:57:57] what you are a natural natural man or a
[1:58:01] natural woman. But when you're reborn
[1:58:03] again,
[1:58:05] that's not the outside conscience. The
[1:58:08] outside is what you see, taste, feel,
[1:58:11] smell, and hear. But the inside of that
[1:58:14] is what you really are. You're born a
[1:58:17] certain way. You've got certain traits.
[1:58:18] You've got certain idiosyncrasies.
[1:58:21] You've got it. You can't get rid of it.
[1:58:23] You have it. Sometimes it's a sticky
[1:58:25] part of us where it's something that we
[1:58:27] uh you know that is troublesome to us
[1:58:30] and that that's your grab bag. The human
[1:58:32] grab bag as I preach on. You have it.
[1:58:35] Everybody has it. Anybody who denies
[1:58:37] that God just isn't telling the truth.
[1:58:39] We all got a human grab bag. But I got
[1:58:42] I'm glad I got a spiritual
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; and it's not a grab bag.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; It's something spiritual. I got a
[1:58:48] spiritual birth. Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; You know, I I just say a little personal
[1:59:00] note when brother Vin on one of his
[1:59:02] trips when he was up here, you know, and
[1:59:04] I guess he's just observing and seeing,
[1:59:06] you know, we observe one another and I
[1:59:08] see how someone else does things and he
[1:59:11] was observing how I approach things and
[1:59:14] do things. And
[1:59:16] I'd never been I'd never been a
[1:59:17] stargazer. Never paid any attention to
[1:59:19] where I was born, when I was born, and
[1:59:20] all the rest of it. But he says, "When
[1:59:23] when were you born?"
[1:59:25] So, what's your birth date? I says, "I'm
[1:59:27] October." Oh, that explains it.
[1:59:32] You're you're a Libra. You weigh
[1:59:34] everything out. Oh, it's it's torturous.
[1:59:38] I weigh things out and dissect them and
[1:59:42] drop them down and pick them up again
[1:59:44] and chew it all over again and think
[1:59:46] about and somebody said, "Why don't you
[1:59:47] do something? Why don't you do
[1:59:48] something?" I'm still just chewing it
[1:59:49] over. I'm thinking it over. Weigh it out
[1:59:51] and weigh it out and weigh it out and
[1:59:53] weigh it out. How long do you have to
[1:59:54] weigh it out? Oh, sometimes a month,
[1:59:56] maybe six months, maybe a year. Got to
[1:59:58] think it out. Got to just weigh it out.
[2:00:00] Weigh it out. I can't help it.
[2:00:03] I have to I have to put all it on God.
[2:00:05] God saw that was born there and I guess
[2:00:08] he wanted that. And brother Brandham
[2:00:11] says he was slow and Moses was slow and
[2:00:13] so I'll join those ranks. I'm slow
[2:00:19] and you were born a certain time.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes, please?
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; He said, now that's your birth path.
[2:00:27] That's your natural natural. But when
[2:00:29] the wise men, listen to this, when the
[2:00:32] wise men saw the star that identified
[2:00:35] the place and the time that the Messiah
[2:00:37] was going to be on the earth, they also
[2:00:40] saw their birth path.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; When you identified
[2:00:50] that Christ was not 2,000 years ago, you
[2:00:53] identified Christ was here. Now Christ
[2:00:58] is here. The Messiah is on the earth.
[2:01:01] The Messiah is here. The Messiah is
[2:01:04] talking to He's speaking to me. This is
[2:01:06] not a historical thing. I have
[2:01:09] revelation. We're in that coming of
[2:01:10] Christ.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; The Messiah
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; has descended.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Now to some, it's just some information.
[2:01:20] I'm so I feel sorry for you.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for you. But when that
[2:01:24] grips you, it ignites you.
[2:01:29] And brother Benham says in uniting time
[2:01:32] and sign,
[2:01:34] he said, "Did you notice how vivid the
[2:01:37] sign for the wise men? They were
[2:01:39] Hebrews. They weren't actually Indian
[2:01:42] astronomers. They were Hebrews because
[2:01:44] they were up there in the country
[2:01:45] studying astronomy to finish their
[2:01:48] education. And when they looked towards
[2:01:50] Jerusalem, listen closely. And knowing
[2:01:54] that they saw those three stars from
[2:01:57] each one of their birth path, Ham, Sham,
[2:02:01] and Japheth,
[2:02:02] of which race they came from, each and
[2:02:06] they seen them stars in their birth
[2:02:10] path. That was a sign to them that when
[2:02:14] those stars were in line, the Messiah
[2:02:17] was on the earth. Now, it's a wonderful
[2:02:19] thing that they would see that and say,
[2:02:20] "The Messiah is on the earth." But a
[2:02:23] prophet comes and catches something that
[2:02:25] you would never catch normally. He says,
[2:02:26] "When they saw those stars,
[2:02:29] when they saw that light, they saw their
[2:02:34] birth path."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; My dear believer friends sitting here
[2:02:39] listening this morning, I want to say to
[2:02:41] you, when you saw
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; that divine light
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; that shone to you in this generation,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; you saw your birth path.
[2:02:52] You saw your race.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; You saw where you came from. And there's
[2:02:58] no other way to see where you came from.
[2:03:01] That's the only way you can see it.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you have the natural. Well, I
[2:03:06] came from this. I come from Kentucky or
[2:03:07] I come from uh Alaska or I came from
[2:03:10] Newfanland or wherever you came from. I
[2:03:12] come from Europe. I come from Russia.
[2:03:14] That has nothing to do with it. That's
[2:03:16] just this outside man. That's just this
[2:03:18] outside conscience. Amen.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; But I say today,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; in all truth, in real truth, by
[2:03:27] revelation, something that has a deeper
[2:03:29] reality to you than your natural birth,
[2:03:31] where did you come from?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, you know, I'll tell you
[2:03:36] where I come from. I saw a light."
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I heard a message.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; I heard a messenger.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And that was my messenger
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; sent from God. Yes, sir. That was my
[2:03:49] angel sent to me with a divine message.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; And when I saw the light,
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I saw where I came from.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; I saw my birth path.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; I saw my origin.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; We came from a divine place.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I came from above.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; You came from above.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus was talking. I have to I have to
[2:04:25] just finish this. Do I have your consent
[2:04:28] just for a few moments? I've been really
[2:04:31] really waiting on God for this for some
[2:04:33] time and I because I wouldn't want to
[2:04:36] take a whole service just on the next
[2:04:38] comments. When Jesus But this is really
[2:04:41] where it caps off. Jesus was speaking in
[2:04:44] John 6.
[2:04:47] He was speaking to the leaders of that
[2:04:49] day as he did also in this day. Speaking
[2:04:53] to him and they opened up. Oh, they
[2:04:55] said, you know, so often the leaders say
[2:04:57] the wrong thing. And they opened up the
[2:04:59] subject and they said, they said unto
[2:05:01] him, "What sign do you show us
[2:05:06] that we may see and believe you?
[2:05:09] What do you work? What work do thou?"
[2:05:13] They said, "Our fathers ate mana in the
[2:05:16] desert. As it is written, he gave them
[2:05:18] bread from heaven to eat."
[2:05:21] Now, they could have asked for anything
[2:05:23] else, but it was it had to be even God
[2:05:25] directed those rejecting leaders to open
[2:05:28] up the door.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; What sign do you show us?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate mana. They could have
[2:05:33] said, "What sign do you show us? Our
[2:05:35] fathers went through the Red Sea." Or,
[2:05:37] "Our fathers did this and our fathers
[2:05:39] did that." But what sign do you show us?
[2:05:41] Our fathers ate mana from heaven and and
[2:05:44] God gave them bread from heaven. And
[2:05:46] Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I
[2:05:48] say unto you, Moses gave you not the
[2:05:50] bread from heaven, but my father giveth
[2:05:52] you the true bread from heaven. For the
[2:05:55] bread of God,"
[2:05:58] and I put that underlined. For the bread
[2:06:01] of God is he which came down from heaven
[2:06:05] and giveth life unto the world. And he
[2:06:07] said in the 51st verse, I am the living
[2:06:09] bread which came down from heaven. If
[2:06:12] any man eat of this bread, he shall live
[2:06:14] forever. And the bread that I will give
[2:06:18] is my flesh which I will give for the
[2:06:21] life of the world. receiving the word
[2:06:26] that that God sends to us through the
[2:06:30] body through that body that house
[2:06:33] through which the eternal God is
[2:06:35] manifesting himself. Receiving the word
[2:06:38] through that body
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; was the only way a person could partake
[2:06:43] of the flesh.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; That was the partaking part.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Understand? From this, from the blood
[2:06:51] came the spirit, the life. But he kept
[2:06:54] saying, and brother Brandham kept making
[2:06:56] such a point of it, except to eat the
[2:06:58] flesh.
[2:07:00] And that's what stumbled them because it
[2:07:02] was the veil.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; The flesh that stumbled them.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; They couldn't accept. And it was exactly
[2:07:11] the same today. It was the veil, the
[2:07:14] prophet veil that they could not they
[2:07:17] couldn't eat it. They couldn't take it.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; And because they couldn't take that,
[2:07:21] they never got the life from the sea
[2:07:23] spirit part.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the life of it.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Now you see, I'm coming down home real
[2:07:32] fast.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; You folks will be with you work you work
[2:07:36] amongst unbelievers. You
[2:07:39] you'll be with friends. You'll be with
[2:07:40] maybe family over this Christmas season
[2:07:43] and they know you.
[2:07:46] You're their, you know, son, daughter,
[2:07:48] mother, father, whatever. You're their
[2:07:51] friend, whatever. We, we know you. We
[2:07:54] are entrapped
[2:07:56] in our natural understanding of one
[2:07:59] another's life.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; But if we could realize, sir,
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; this one here has been born in
[2:08:06] Bethlehem.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I was born in Bethlehem. You're born in
[2:08:10] Bethlehem. You're born in Bethlehem.
[2:08:12] You're born in Bethlehem. You sisters
[2:08:14] born in Bethlehem. We've all been born
[2:08:16] in the same place.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; You weren't born in Africa and me born
[2:08:20] in Canada. You're born in the United
[2:08:22] States. That's just this old shell.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; But on the other hand, anyone who wants
[2:08:28] to get any value of that new person that
[2:08:31] was born in Bethlehem, they cannot hear
[2:08:33] the one born in Bethlehem till they hear
[2:08:35] the one that was born wherever they were
[2:08:37] born.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Because this is a vessel.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's a vessel. You're the vessel that
[2:08:44] God chose before the foundation of the
[2:08:46] world to be born where you were born,
[2:08:48] under the sign you were born, to whom
[2:08:50] you were born, and he saw your footsteps
[2:08:52] through until you connect with that
[2:08:54] divine light and you'd be born in
[2:08:56] Bethlehem.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; And it is that merging of those two.
[2:09:02] It's that combination, that dual uh the
[2:09:05] the dual relationship, if I can say it
[2:09:07] that way. Are you following me? Do you
[2:09:09] understand? And because they could not
[2:09:11] take the flesh
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, they could not receive
[2:09:17] the spiritual part.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; There's no way for them to say, "Well, I
[2:09:22] reject what he says and I'll just go up
[2:09:25] to the upper room with these other
[2:09:27] people and I'll just get it anyway. I'll
[2:09:29] just go up anyway. I reject what Jesus
[2:09:32] Christ says." I tell you what, man has
[2:09:35] always tried to go around,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't work. And so Jesus said
[2:09:40] this, he broke his broke the bread. And
[2:09:43] when he broke the bread, he said, "This
[2:09:45] is this bread is my body which is given
[2:09:48] for you." And I've got to just go
[2:09:50] quickly so I can conclude here now. And
[2:09:53] I should be spending a lot more time on
[2:09:54] this. But then Apostle Paul comes, the
[2:09:57] first church age messenger to let you
[2:09:59] and I know that there's been a change
[2:10:00] here. There's been a transformation. He
[2:10:02] says, "Now you are the body of Christ.
[2:10:06] You are the body of Christ. You're the
[2:10:09] body that And listen, this body's been
[2:10:11] broken and bruised and beaten and and
[2:10:13] and everything else all down through the
[2:10:15] generations. And God breaks a piece off
[2:10:17] and says, "I'll send a piece here. I'll
[2:10:19] break a piece off. I'll send piece here.
[2:10:22] I'll break a piece off here." And the
[2:10:24] people who receive and hear that that
[2:10:26] servant of Christ, it can be the most
[2:10:29] insignificant. It can be a it can be a
[2:10:31] child. It can be a in school. It can be
[2:10:33] a housewife in the mall. It can be
[2:10:35] anyone but that that body of Christ.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Rejected
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; yet today.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Broken maybe in spirit,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; wounded by the struggles of life, turned
[2:10:50] out perhaps by the family and rejected
[2:10:53] by the by associates and whatever more
[2:10:56] and denied and spoken evil against. But
[2:10:59] they stand there and hold the testimony
[2:11:01] of Jesus Christ proudly and bravely like
[2:11:04] a gentile warrior. Hallelujah. I'm not
[2:11:08] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:10] For it is the power of God under
[2:11:12] salvation. I was born in some country
[2:11:15] but I was born again in Jerus in
[2:11:17] Bethlehem.
[2:11:19] Hallelujah.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And I carry the bread of God.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I haven't only partaken of it. But
[2:11:25] Apostle Paul says you're the body of
[2:11:27] Christ. He says another place, "Know you
[2:11:29] not that you are one loaf? You are one
[2:11:32] bread.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; You're the bread of God."
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; And where did you come from? You came
[2:11:39] down from heaven.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; This bread is not of the earth.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; This bread came from heaven.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; That which is in you. Came from heaven.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I hope you're seeing it.
[2:11:54] You ought to be You ought to be so
[2:11:56] thankful today. You ought to be on your
[2:11:58] feet. You ought to do something. Say,
[2:11:59] "Oh God,
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; you sent this down from heaven.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; This that is in me has come from heaven.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; What does this world matter? What is
[2:12:08] what does this life matter? It doesn't
[2:12:10] matter anything.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; We're just we're just pilgrims and
[2:12:13] strangers moving through here.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; What does this Christmas? It's nothing.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; It's just a bunch of tinsel,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; valless, shiny things. Amen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; We will not have that
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. Brother Bram talks about
[2:12:32] Christmas and little gift for the
[2:12:34] children. We got bags of candy here for
[2:12:35] them and which we've never done. That
[2:12:37] that that's irrelevant to me whether we
[2:12:39] do it, whether they did it or I don't
[2:12:41] look at every everything brother
[2:12:42] Brandham did just so that I can go and
[2:12:44] do exactly the same thing. He said you
[2:12:46] can't tell the little children they see
[2:12:48] the others receiving gifts and so on.
[2:12:49] You can't tell them these things and so
[2:12:51] on so forth. But you friends, to me,
[2:12:55] this Christmas season is what I'm
[2:12:56] preaching about this morning.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in some little thing,
[2:13:00] you know, can I or can't I or can you or
[2:13:03] can't you or whatever more. I think that
[2:13:05] we ought to just keep our lives un
[2:13:07] uninterrupted with the world,
[2:13:09] unassociated with the world. Let them go
[2:13:11] on in their rat race. Let them go on and
[2:13:14] spend themselves out. I'd urge you not
[2:13:16] to do it. Hallelujah. Stay out of that
[2:13:19] rat race. Stay calm before God.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy this time together. Enjoy
[2:13:25] this time in the in the spirit of God.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; To me. It was just staggering to think
[2:13:51] about these things.
[2:13:54] And as they were eating, Jesus took
[2:13:57] bread, said, "Take, eat. This is my
[2:14:00] body." And the last thing I want to say
[2:14:02] to you is,
[2:14:04] "Cast your bread
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; upon the waters,
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; and after many days, it'll return to
[2:14:12] you.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is your bread.
[2:14:17] Healing is the children's bread.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; But now the scripture tells us, "Cast
[2:14:21] your bread."
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Upon the waters,
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; and after many days, it will return to
[2:14:28] you again. You cast your good work.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; One person said to brother Brandham
[2:14:34] says, "Oh, yeah. Well, he just, you
[2:14:36] know, he just buttered them up. You
[2:14:38] know, they he he he just buttered them."
[2:14:41] He said, "Well,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; that was good." He says, "I, you know,
[2:14:44] you need bread that's buttered.
[2:14:47] He said, and he said, "You want to cast
[2:14:49] your bread upon the water? Say something
[2:14:51] nice about somebody else and that'll
[2:14:54] come back to you. You send it out bone
[2:14:56] dry and moldy, it'll probably come back
[2:14:57] to you mo bone dry and moldy. But you
[2:14:59] send it out butter, it'll probably come
[2:15:01] back to you buttered." Hallelujah.
[2:15:03] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I think God
[2:15:06] has has really buttered up his his
[2:15:09] children. Told them how he loved them.
[2:15:11] Told them what he's done for them.
[2:15:13] Aren't you thankful today? Oh, thank God
[2:15:17] from whom all blessings flow.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; just in the
[2:15:29] end of this service at this moment, I
[2:15:32] just want to give you thanks. We've been
[2:15:34] somewhat lengthy, but I I just felt I
[2:15:37] wanted to convey Lord what was the
[2:15:40] burden of your word upon my own heart
[2:15:42] and feel it had been delivered. And I
[2:15:45] pray that you'll help me Lord to have
[2:15:48] said the right thing and if anything was
[2:15:50] improper, incorrect or inappropriate,
[2:15:52] you take that from the minds of the
[2:15:54] people. ask you to bless them and bless
[2:15:57] all who are here and present and those
[2:15:59] that are present in other places and
[2:16:01] locations
[2:16:03] on the streaming. Oh God, bless them
[2:16:05] whether they be in Norway or Germany,
[2:16:07] Switzerland,
[2:16:09] Newfoundland, down the east coast or
[2:16:11] throughout the United States. Lord,
[2:16:13] wherever they are, pray that you'll
[2:16:15] bless them. Just bless them, dear
[2:16:16] precious saints of God, children of God,
[2:16:21] Bethlehem dwellers in Jesus Christ's
[2:16:24] name. Amen.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; There's a fountain open.
[2:16:34] And in this message, Brother Bram spoke
[2:16:36] of it. There's a fountain open in the
[2:16:38] house of David.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:44] We're all beneficiaries of it.
[2:16:47] It's not sealed up anymore. It's a
[2:16:49] fountain open for us. Maybe we could
[2:16:52] just stand and sing it.
[2:16:57] There's a fountain
[2:17:01] open in the house
[2:17:04] [Music]
[2:17:07] to
[2:17:11] be.
[2:17:14] And there are streams of grace that
[2:17:19] flowing down
[2:17:22] from Calary.
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:29] Let's sing it once again. Let's land.
[2:17:31] Why don't you come and help us? Would
[2:17:32] you
[2:17:36] in the house
[2:17:42] you
[2:17:44] would
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:50] stream
[2:17:53] that's flowing down
[2:17:56] from Calary
[2:18:00] now?
[2:18:02] and receive.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; For I will take you from the nations
[2:18:10] from the nations
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; and bring you to your own land.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; And I'll be sanctified
[2:18:19] in you
[2:18:22] before the eyes of men.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; A new heart will I give you. Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; And place my spirit within.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I'll sprinkle clean water on you
[2:18:41] and save you from your sin.
[2:18:46] There is a fountain
[2:18:50] open
[2:18:53] [Music]
[2:18:56] to you.
[2:19:00] Who will be
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:09] falling down
[2:19:11] from
[2:19:14] [Music]
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; and I will pour
[2:19:24] upon the house a mightious
[2:19:29] chosen ones. The spirit of grace and
[2:19:35] of supplication.
[2:19:41] And in that day,
[2:19:45] what a day that would be. A fountain
[2:19:50] shall be opened up and yes, you shall be
[2:19:54] holy.
[2:19:58] There is a mountain
[2:20:02] where you are
[2:20:08] to
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:14] believe.
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:34] Hallelujah.
[2:20:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:41] There are streams of grace.
[2:20:44] Streams of grace.
[2:20:46] I pray the streams of grace will
[2:20:49] flood over us.
[2:20:51] Great billowing waves.
[2:20:54] Oh, Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit of God,
[2:21:00] gracious Holy Spirit of God,
[2:21:04] we are here today
[2:21:07] and have life, the life that we have
[2:21:10] only because of your grace.
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:14] and we desire to approach you, oh God,
[2:21:16] to give you thanks.
[2:21:19] That our eyes have been opened and we
[2:21:22] see what we see.
[2:21:25] I pray, Father, that you will pour upon
[2:21:29] this congregation and all who are within
[2:21:31] the sound of my voice.
[2:21:34] Pour out upon them, oh God,
[2:21:38] all the benefits of these streams
[2:21:42] from the house of David.
[2:21:45] Lord, I thank you that one day in
[2:21:48] Bethlehem, the natural Bethlehem
[2:21:52] was born the Savior.
[2:21:54] And Lord, we do not know the day or the
[2:21:57] evening or what time it was, but you did
[2:22:00] send him. Christ Jesus was born and we
[2:22:04] want to glorify you for that and thank
[2:22:07] you for this great redemption. None of
[2:22:10] us could earn it. And as I spoke this
[2:22:12] morning, Lord, we see from looking
[2:22:15] through the scriptures and looking into
[2:22:17] our own lives that was only could come
[2:22:20] by grace, glorious, amazing grace. I ask
[2:22:24] you to bless this people, Father, as
[2:22:27] they depart from this place and some
[2:22:30] will be journeying and traveling. I ask
[2:22:33] that you'll give them safe journeys. I
[2:22:36] pray that they will have superimposed
[2:22:39] over their minds this great truth. I was
[2:22:43] born in Bethlehem and I was born with a
[2:22:46] host of the redeemed. I've been born
[2:22:49] again in Christ Jesus. Oh, what a
[2:22:52] glorious, glorious thing. Send them with
[2:22:55] gladness in their heart. This glorious
[2:22:58] gift that you have given to us, Lord, in
[2:23:01] this Jesus Christ revealed in our time.
[2:23:05] I pray you'll
[2:23:08] you please, Lord, just give special
[2:23:11] blessings upon all
[2:23:14] our young people, our families,
[2:23:18] all that are standing here, Lord.
[2:23:21] and let them know that you
[2:23:24] are very very aware of their individual
[2:23:28] need
[2:23:29] and where they are. I pray that you will
[2:23:34] draw near to them Lord because nothing
[2:23:36] can take the place of your presence
[2:23:38] presence yourself with them and abide
[2:23:40] with us. And may we return this evening
[2:23:43] Lord to hear what you've laid upon our
[2:23:46] brother Tom Ray's heart. Oh God, we're
[2:23:49] anxious to hear these things so we might
[2:23:51] be moved further in the direction of our
[2:23:54] heavenly home in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:23:57] Amen. Amen. God bless you Bethlehem
[2:24:02] dwellers,
[2:24:04] Gentile warriors,
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:08] not worthy by your natural birth, but
[2:24:11] made worthy by your spiritual birth. God
[2:24:14] with you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:24:16] name.
[2:24:18] Amen.
[2:24:20] [Music]
[2:24:32] Heat.
