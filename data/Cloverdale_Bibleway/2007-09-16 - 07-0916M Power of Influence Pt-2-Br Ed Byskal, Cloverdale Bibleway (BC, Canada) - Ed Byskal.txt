========================================
for sinner slave. Give him glory. Give him glory. Oh, give me [Music] away. [Music] I'm crazy. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Amen. [Music] Amen. We're here to praise the Lord this morning. Worship him. Amen. And uh I don't know what's happened this week or what you're looking forward to today. You might be like me and not sure how you're going to get through the next day or two because you got so much stuff going on. And uh it happens to us sometimes. But we want to take some time aside and worship God. And um I heard something this uh this week um someone was talking about grace and they said I thought it was one of the best analogies I ever heard. Said grace is described as the unmmerited favor of God which is kind of like saying that atomic bomb is something that blows things up. It's correct, but it's so much more deeper than that. Amen. And we're here this morning because of God's grace. When you think that God that created everything in the universe, amen, spoke worlds into existence and you start thinking about how vast the universe is, but he's interested in you this morning. Amen. That's grace. Let's stand this morning. We sing it together. Grace, grace, God's grace. number 476 on the screen. Oh, marvelous grace of our loving Lord. Grace that exceeds our sin and our king. Oh, yonder on Calories out there with the blood. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] atmosphere like the sea. [Music] Yeah. Heat. This is free.

Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Oh, [Music] heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I will bless the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's, brother John, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Amen. If you've got a need this morning, we've got a God here this morning who's able to answer that need. and meet it. If you're listening in on the internet or in the phone hookup, amen, God is as close to you there as he is here. Amen. Fills all time and space. He knows your need. Amen. Even before you ask. So if you've got a need this morning, just stretch out your hand to him. Amen. And I believe, man, if we agree together, God will come on the scene and meet that need. Brother John. Father, we're here to worship you this morning, God. Lord, we're here to get in the spirit of worship, Lord, as your children. Lord, we've gone through this week, Lord, of work and school and living in this leodyian life, but Lord, we've come into your house. And this is a house of praise. This is a house of prayer. This is a house of dedication. This is a house that we can get out of ourselves and come in a spirit of worship. Come into the spirit of the word. Come into the spirit of Christ. Come into this place where angels are here. Lord, I believe you want to do more for us than we are even than we even understand with our mortal minds more than what we could even grasp. Lord, I just feel your spirit of faith as wanting to pulsate by your word within souls of men and women to know that we are not just mortal flesh, but we are sons and daughters of God. Lord, let that faith rise up in a people. Let that manifestation, God, of who we are come to life. Be it may it be quickened this morning, God. And Lord, we don't know the needs of your people fully. Some might have gone through a battle, through a trial, and they're here to give you praise and here to give you thanksgiving. Some might be ready to go into a tremendous season, Lord, of of difficulty or a test that you have allowed. Some might be right in the middle, Lord, of a of a of a time of great decision or turmoil or sickness. But Lord, I pray that we would be as Job, Lord, in the midst of his trial, that you'd drop down inspiration and dropped down a revelation. I know my redeemer liveth. And we believe our healer is in the building. this morning. God, we believe the deliverer is here with arms stretched out open. Lord, we believe our husband is here. All that we have need of. Lord, I pray that as you've already given us your word and distributed power to the church, that our faith would be energized to believe for the impossible. What doctors say is impossible. What men of this world would say and women and even our mortal minds can't put it together. But your word is true and your word is our light and it's a light into our pathway and we're taking your word on the matter this morning. So may there be pulsations of faith throughout this service that brothers and sisters would be delivered while they yet hear the word that healing would visit this address this morning God. Oh father, we need you, Lord. And our hearts are lifted up. As our brother Rod said, just reach out your hand, Lord. Both my hands are lifted up, Lord. We desire you to come to this house, to these lives of ours, and consume these sacrifices. We're hungry. We're thirsty to see the supernatural upon us, upon our brothers, upon our sisters, upon the body, upon the family, God. And I pray that chains, Lord, that are even now maybe being tried to be clasped on to the souls of your children, that they would be loose this morning. that as our pastor comes and as our brother Rod leads us into worship and as we sing and hear songs that there would be a great unified faith that you are in control that you are more than able that you are present and that you are near to influence us. Oh God, take us away. Oh God, take us into that other dimension. Take us beyond this flesh. God, we believe all things are possible and we are waiting for you to manifest it within this dimension, God, to change these atoms and whatever you see fit until that time for us to go through. May you give us the character and the surrendering and the yieldedness to let you have your way. Lord, we believe that you know your mind concerning us. But when you speak it and make it known, our hearts are ready and we are willing to do whatever you say. Lord, let that not come from our lips, but from the lives that are totally surrendered, totally yielded and you would have preeminence today. Bless our pastor, Lord. Bless those that are hurting. Our brother Ron Spencer, brother Matthew Spencer. May you bring a healing and a miracle into that situation. Our brother uh Murphy Wong and Sister Tracy, Lord, those that are out on the field, those that are laboring in the vineyard, the Seattle service this afternoon, Lord, may you pulsate within your people around the world. This great supernatural work that you are climaxing within our lives, Father, be manifested today in Jesus name. and we give you thanks for what you're doing. Amen. Amen. [Music] And you can have your seats. Our brother John Briner has a special for us this morning. Brother John, if you'd come and get ready. Um, we got is a video clip ready? You can play it anytime. Well, we'll just maybe welcome and then uh just before brother John special, we'll play this little video clip I wanted to play this morning. Um, we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us in the church here. &gt;&gt; Come out of the state. The reason I say that the angel of the Lord's only gifted people should believe you. If they won't believe you, then you'll know the very secrets of their heart and they'll have to believe it. &gt;&gt; I broke my neck while I was bouncing my family. &gt;&gt; I started having seizures. I had flesh eating disease. &gt;&gt; The Lord totally touched me. Now I'm 100%. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus healed me and I have absolutely 100% use of all my body. &gt;&gt; Your faith has healed you, brother. Go home. Jesus Christ makes you well. [Music] Jesus Christ will bring it to you if you will only believe. The website's finished. It is up. It is public. And that trailer you just saw is on YouTube. Uh I put it up on Friday and by noon yesterday, 70 people had already looked at it and uh we just want to get the last one in. Amen. And uh so uh you know uh go ahead take a look at it. Um the uh the site has now changed. So when you go into it, you will now get a screen which gives you two choices. One is the introduction which gives you the website that you'd seen before which goes through about a half an hour presentation on the message. There's now a link that says main site. And if you go into that main site, you will see the results of what Jeremy has been working on for the past six months. And we want to thank everyone who has helped. And there's too many to mention now, but uh there's a few that have been a real help. You know who you are. And we just really appreciate God knows who you are. And uh so um take a look at it and uh you can start uh continue to give out the cards. I will say if you do need to give out cards, go ahead and get cards printed on your own. Some people like to sit back and wait for other people to do stuff for us. Well, what what we did is we got uh initially brother James and Jeremy James Rosac up in Edmonton. He went and got uh we got 10,000 cards printed up. They lasted uh about a month before we give it give them out to everybody. They took out they took uh I don't know how many uh 5,000 7,000 to the men's meeting in uh in back east in West Virginia and gave them all out. But there is a a website believethe.org. If you go on there, you can download uh and this is particularly for those listening in on the internet. You can download a file which you can take to a printer and they can print in color as many cards as you want and it's pretty cheap to get cards printed out. So, uh, if you do that, make sure whoever's printing them runs off one or two copies so you can see it. Make sure the colors are right. Um, which is the advice we got from brother James Rosac. But you can go out and get your own cards printed. If you're listening in on the internet, you can just go on to this website, believethe.org, or download uh the file. Um it's an EPS file and you can uh download it and get the uh get the uh cards printed up and give out as many as you want. Amen. We want to get the last one in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother John. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the sign this morning? Um the words to this song were um inspired to me during brother Tom's service last Sunday morning as he was preaching about the unconditional blood covenant. And as he I was nearing the end of this of his service and he was speaking about the blood I started thinking a little bit about the power of the blood in our own lives and the even as brother Ed has been speaking out the power of influence it holds over our actions and over our lives. And just as I sing this morning, just feel free to maybe uh enter in and remember back to the moment in the place when that when his blood first cleans your sins when he first revealed to you that unconditional covenant that he made. [Music] I remember the moment, Lord. I remember the place you lifted the veil from my heart. You showed me your face. [Music] and oh unforgiveness [Music] an expression of your love. So I won't forget your mercy. Lord I'll remember the blood cuz I remember the blood and I remember your grace when you reach through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was safe. And I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. You saved me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember. [Music] [Music] Lord, you gave me your covenant, a promise so true. It's your word unconditional. Oh, it binds me to you. And there is a token you've applied to my soul. So I will remember. Oh, wherever I go. Cuz I remember the blood. Lord, I remember your grace when you reach through the darkness. Oh Lord, I knew I was saved. [Music] And you gave me your love flowing down like a fountain. You save me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember the blood. Cuz Lord, your blood will never lose its power. [Music] No, never. [Music] Oh, no, never. For I know that your blood atones for my sin forever. And it will never it will never lose its power. Cuz I remember the blood, Lord. I remember your grace when you reached through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was saved. And I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. You save me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember the blood. For I remember the blood and I remember your grace when you reached through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was saved and I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. You gave me your mercy. You saved me my love. I remember the blood. [Music] John. Amen. Going to want to hear that one again. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning the word at this time. Uh we've got one announcement which I forgot to make. Um just a reminder that the wedding of Brother Kyle Kemper and Sister Sharon Gabriel will be held this Saturday, September 22nd at 10:30 a.m. sharp. Sister Sharon says, "This will be a first. It will happen on time." So, I'm going to hold her to that. It has never ever happened to date in the history of this church that a wedding has started on time. But Sharon said, Sister Sharon said, "This will be a first and it will happen on time." So, those who would like to attend the ceremony, uh, it's going to be here 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. We'll be praying but we'll have a use this as an opportunity to speak to souls. Amen. We're really happy for brother Kyle and sister Sharon. He knows my name. Let's sing it as brother Biscll is going to come. I have a maker. [Music] before my heart. Before even my life was He knows my [Music] heat. [Music] And I have [Music] he and he'll never leave me. No matter where I go my [Music] [Music] he [Music] Oh, I'm glad that he Oh [Music] my god. [Music] [Music] and he [Music] is. [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He hears us when we call. And I can tell you what God's prophet said. He comes every time he's invited. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If we really believe it, all we need to do is invite him. Invite him and he'll be here. We know that he is here. It's that it's us that has to get in tune. And that's why we're worshiping so we can be in tune. Amen. It's wonderful. Well, we announced one a wedding this coming Saturday. And we we'll be announcing another one just now. And that's our brother Toby Cailloui right here and sister Rebecca Cassanji uh somewhere in the audience. They would like to announce their wedding on October the 27th. That'll be a Saturday as well, October the 27th. and here at the church. It'll be at 1 100 1:00 p.m. Uh, and let's just be praying if you would for this young couple. We're praying that God will arrange that the visas, the necessary visas for relatives and parents will be in place and they will be able to arrive, excuse me, arrive and be here at that time. And I want our brother Toby's father, brother Caillou, who's a pastor in uh pastor's a really a handsome congregation of people. I say handsome because they're lovely people. And uh I know that when I was there about 3 4 years ago, there was 2,000 people at that time just packing the place to capacity. And uh and and and they have respect. The people have respect. The city has respect. city of a million people. For those of you that don't know, the television, two television crews were there. I had had no knowledge of it except I saw these people walking around. I thought they were church people and uh then they televised the whole service, had it on prime time that very night and played it for one month. for one month in that city of Amujaya and there were people so affected uh I think that it's just you know God honoring their respect for the word of God which I will be speaking on uh in a few moments. Uh next Sunday we were we are going to have an evening service and uh it's you want to be careful now for the time. The time will be at 4:00 because we want to have communion and uh footwashing. We don't want it to be rushed and yet we want the people to have time if they are traveling some distance and those that might be streaming that may be in the Okonogan or in Eastern Washington or wherever that they'll have time and those from Seattle quite often come up uh as many as can. We need a lots of time because we have a lot of people and we want to be able to accommodate everyone and we don't want to rush this wonderful service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I I actually I actually felt very very directed. I don't know what God wants to do, but I can tell you that there's healing at a communion time. There's washing at a communion time. And uh so may God give us a very very gracious time. Make sure that none of your believer family miss the service. And if Satan tries to put one over on you and say, "Well, you're not really worthy and you didn't have a very good week and you had a bad day and you did something da da da." Just get it out of the way &gt;&gt; and be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we need we need these very special times. I I also uh saw the little clip that Brother Rod just showed of Brother Jeremy's work and a very very long time ago we were up at uh Brother Jeremy and Sister Joanna's place. That's even some years ago. I could see then there was a in incredible desire within him to uh set something out that was be so factual that you can't get around it. And I think they've done an excellent job. And so for brother Jeremy and all the team that worked with them, I personally want to also thank you. I think that it's uh I I think that it's really spectacular and I believe that God will reward all who labored. And after all, we're we're just everybody's doing what their part. We're doing what we can. That's all we're required to do. If you're a mother working in the home, that's your call. You Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, mother. I wish they said I actually would have liked to have heard him say Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, father, but he said mother. So, so I have to say mother. God bless all the mothers. Amen. Brother Tom is ministering in Saskatchewan and they'll probably soon be completing finishing their services as they're an hour ahead. and uh he's replacing uh taking brother Ron Spencer's place and I don't know I didn't hear all the comments at the first the service but I would like this congregation I have assured sister Connie and and others that we would be praying as a congregation I don't mean just you know a one minute a few words I I'm I'm talking about prayer &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I'm talking about getting into prayer and just getting into the spirit of prayer and praying for our brother Ron Spencer. He needs our prayers. And so we want to be praying and believing for an answer. &gt;&gt; Our God is the God who gave us every cell in our body. &gt;&gt; Our God is the God who put all the chemistry there. &gt;&gt; And Jesus has already paid for it. And brother Brandham said many times, "God can't heal us. He's already done it. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. And so we just we we don't ask questions why things happen, why it's this way. It's up to us as to believe and be believers. Amen. That's that's what we're required to do. Pray also if you would please uh for the trustees from from week to week and from meeting to meeting. A great deal goes on and a great deal of time is required by uh others who are involved with the Lord's work and the trustees are putting in a lot of time right now with regards to a number of things with regards to camp with regards to missions and overseas work and uh we're laboring we're we're we're just laboring and we want to labor in the vineyard labor for the master from the dawn till setting sun because we don't know how much time we have. So, we just everyone wants to do our best and the trustees have a little certainly have a a good deal extra right now to consider while we're working through all the hoops and the details of of the camp. And uh we just want the we want the perfect will of God. Everything seems to be moving along in a positive direction, but we uh we have some work to do. We don't have a lot of time to do it in. And so we need divine wisdom. We need the gift of wisdom. And I believe God has given us that. I'll have you stand. We have sung and we have prayed. And I think I'd just like to uh sing. We're standing on holy ground. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] For we are standing in his presence on the earth. [Music] Our gracious and loving heavenly father, we believe that you have sent not only your presence, the holy spirit but angels of God uh around your inheritance around your children. We know that they are present. How how it was so emphasized by your messenger which was continually passing into that realm and in contact with that realm and seeking to make us as believers of the message to be aware. These five senses are only to contact this world. But there's another world. There's another realm. And we as believers have another sense. We we have a six sense and by faith we reach through the promise of God and we see oh God and feel the influence of the angels of God that have been sent and commissioned oh Lord and encamped. They're not visiting but they are encamped around your people. Not for some aimless reason but with a design with a purpose. Oh God, may we be energized this morning to receive from your word to lift your name up to have our desires fulfilled with the right purpose in mind that your name will be glorified. We don't need any self-aclaim. We don't need any credit to ourselves, Lord. Not at all. We want all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. And we would say with the songwriter, we'll give all the glory to Jesus and tell of his love. Bless the people now, Lord. Anoint them. Anoint me, I pray, oh God, as I speak, all those that are streaming, we are greeting them in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and praying that they too will be blessed together with us. Inspire us now, Lord, and open our eyes that we may see glorious things that you have for us. That we might be fed, &gt;&gt; might be healed, might be delivered, &gt;&gt; oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, let prison bars be broken. Let the prisoners come out, oh God. We pray father for brother Ron Spencer, his son Matthew and oh God special prayer for sister Connie bearing such a heavy load alone as she is without her husband and son in the house. I pray father you strengthen her and oh God create I pray new tissue where all is required. I pray in our brother Ron Lord be sustained by the power the virtue of the resurrected Jesus Christ. In thy name we pray and for your glory. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May open your Bibles if you would please to two places. I'm going to read Matthew 9 and 20. And before we read, I want to just make a few comments. I have been speaking the last time I spoke from Isaiah 6 where brother Brham reads in the year you king Uzziah died I saw the Lord high and lifted up and this is Isaiah's experience and that powerfully affected his life because brother Brandham said that King Uzziah had had a great influence on Isaiah. And King Uzziah was his hero. He said one place he said he was his buddy. He was his friend. And so all of these things go to go to tell us and he was conveying to us that King Uzziah influenced uh Isaiah and then he died and uh then Isaiah was influenced from above. Everybody's influenced. We all are influenced and we all influence somebody. A part of influence which I didn't bring last time and so I need to connect it now because we're coming from completely different direction. Part of influence is is uh to really be influenced requires respect. So I'm going to come from the direction of respect quite quite a uh most of the service this morning and respect we respect is a very relative word. uh we probably could interpret it quite differently from one person to another but respect is inseparably connected to a person being influenced by someone else. Respect of God's servants, we could say his prophets, his messengers, his apostles, his ministers. And we bring it down into the family between parents and children, between husband and wife. We bring it down into the church. Respect between for the bloodwashed. If we really believe what we say we believe. And I believe that Christ actually shed his blood and journeyed to the cross with his determined steps to buy you. &gt;&gt; That calls for something. That calls for me to treat you in a certain way and for us to treat one another in a certain way and to speak of one another in a certain way. Because in so doing, when we respect what God has ordained or what God has put in place, if we respect that, then we're not respecting that individual only. We're respecting God who ordained the whole thing before the foundation of the world. We are saying, "I'm in full agreement. My spirit gives witness, so I must have the same spirit that arranged all of this. I respect this person. &gt;&gt; And on the other hand, if we admire and respect and have awe for the world, someone of influence and someone of power and someone of, you know, who commands a great deal for one reason or another, they command a great deal of of honor in the world. And we begin. And they might be powerful people politically. They might be powerful people financially. They might be powerful people for whatever reason within a church or whatever more some religious organization. And we need to be aware that you know these that are called stars and sports stars and whatever more for you young people, we're not honoring the person. We're not respecting the person. That respect is flowing through to whoever designed this thing. &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned and as far as the message is concerned, it says Satan. This is Satan is the god of this present evil age. &gt;&gt; And he has set all these things in order. And we are we we are not to respect that. I I realize we are to respect the laws of the land and the people who are in place and the people in authority and pray for the king and those things. But uh and that is having to do with our natural life and so on. But I think you'll understand it a lot clear. I wanted to just excuse me. I don't often hold you standing while I start to mini sermon. But uh I wanted to get that in place before we read. I'm reading from Matthew 9 and 20. And behold, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment. For she said within herself, "If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, be of good comfort. Thy faith hath made thee whole." And the woman was made whole from that hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Luke 22 and we're going to look at verse 63 and 64. And the man that held Jesus, I hope you are with me. A woman just touched his garment. She said, "If I may but touch his garment, &gt;&gt; I will be whole." &gt;&gt; And now here's some men. They have the same person. the same man &gt;&gt; and they are they actually have him in their grip. They held him &gt;&gt; and and they held Jesus, mocked him and smoked him. And when they had blindfolded him, can you just picture? Can you just picture a couple of soldiers, some holding him and some putting a rag, brother Bren says, a rag around his face and they struck him on the face and asked him, saying, "Prophesy, who is it that smokeote thee?" Brother Brandham said, "And they felt no virtue &gt;&gt; and they had no virtue. They actually touched him and held him and wanted him to prophesy and smoke him and mocked him, but no virtue flowed from him." You may be seated. two events. One woman in a group of officers having an opportunity. Brother Brandham said about these events, he referred to them in in influence. He said, "Look at the soldiers. They put a rag over his face and set him out there in a courtyard and took a stick and struck him on the head with it and then passed it one to another and said, "If you be a prophet, prophesy now. Tell us which one hit you." And so no response at all. They could they couldn't feel no virtue. But the little woman with enough faith that could touch his garment, she got her desires. He see, he said, you see, we've got to be conscious of God's presence. &gt;&gt; And that really was the difference. One was not conscious of God's presence and the other was conscious of God's presence and it was the difference of receiving. In the message expectation, he said uh the woman touched his garment one time and she got healed, but another one hit him on the head and everything else and they couldn't feel any virtue. He said it's the way they approached him. So now in the one instance he's referring to them being conscious of his presence that's that's necessary for us. We're here in this service. We must be conscious of his presence because you have a messenger and you have the word of God also that is said he'll never leave you nor forsake you. You have a messenger who said he'll come when he's invited also saying that he is present. He is here. And I just took that it was over over about 1300 times brother Brandham declared he's here. &gt;&gt; That ought to register. We're not that, you know, we're not that thick. We we should say we should be able to say with everything that's in us and and say to our soul, he's present. Oh, we say, well, I might not feel it or I had a, you know, this took place this morning or I have these pressures or I have these burdens. That's just life. That has nothing to do to with keeping us from sensing his presence. His presence is is the answer for us. &gt;&gt; For every one of us, &gt;&gt; for all that are &gt;&gt; streaming wherever whatever room, whatever country, whatever conditions you may have, we have different economic conditions and every every uh every country's got uh uh different political system and all the rest of it. And we may worship differently from one place to another, but one thing for sure, his presence is the same in every place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's made an access for us to approach to him. And that should be the same in every place. He said, "And I'm I'm trying to feel." Now, Brother Brandham was saying in this service, I'm trying to feel the approach. Because he has a woman in front of him. He as a sister standing there or a woman standing there. He said, "I'm trying to feel the approach. You see what I mean? Cuz it's the way you regard it." He's talking to the woman. It's the way that you regard it, not me. But you have to respect what I'm talking about or uh uh or it's just or it just won't be. It's your approach to God. Now, he's telling her, "It's not his approach. It's her approach. &gt;&gt; It's your approach. It's not me who has studied. Not me who has waited on God. Not me who has prayed and and wept before God for this service, but now it's your approach. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It's your approach to his presence. And this is what's important. And if we can bring that together, I can tell you all manner of supernatural things happen. You'll have what you need before God. I want to bring you directly into that presence. I want to bring you directly into that expectation. At the very beginning of this service, you can say, "Oh, God." &gt;&gt; Pastor's up there speaking, "Oh, God." He's not saying these things for idle talk. We're not sitting here just to put in some time on a Sunday morning. We're here to meet and to touch with that eternal realm. That's why we're here. And we put everything else and every other thought aside. &gt;&gt; We mean business with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's your approach." The Pharisees one time sent officers, soldiers, to actually seize and arrest Jesus and uh to bring him to them. And so when they went there, they heard some words. And I'm just going to give you some short phrases of the words of Jesus that they heard. They heard him cry out. The Bible even said he cried out in the temple. Ye both know me and you know whence I am and I am not come of myself. But he that sent me is true whom you know not. He said, "But I know him and I am from him and he hath sent me." He said a little further, "Yet a little while and I am with you. And then I go to him that sent me and you shall seek for me. You shall not find me. And where I am thither you cannot come. If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. And he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. And the officers came back to the chief priests and said, "Never a man spake like this." &gt;&gt; Never a man spake like this. They said, "What's the matter with you? You deceived also?" They couldn't change their mind. Never a man spake like this. There's no record. Now, and now I'm in my third experience. Number one, the woman pressing through and getting a hold of his garment. Number one. Number two, men holding him, putting a rag around his face, and having him to prophesy. You're a prophet. They say, "You're a prophet. Prophesy. Here's a stick to his buddy." And he now you prophesy who struck you. He never said a word and no virtue came. And now some men, this is a third one, and they've been sent on their special mission. Arrest this man and bring him bound to us. And they go there and they listen to these words and finally hear him crying out, "He that is a thirst, let him come to me and drink. And he that believeth on me, he said, uh, out of his belly, he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. And they were smitten and they went back. They couldn't arrest him. They go back. They say, "Never man spake like this man." And their leaders thought they were deceived. But there's no record that this experience ever went beyond that. There's people today that hear the message and they say, "These are astounding things. I've never heard things like that in my life. I've never heard things like the serpent Satan. That makes absolute sense. This the first time I understood the godhead. I've never Yes, I can see clearly uh uh that the baptism must be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's clear in the scripture." And they hear and they say, "I've never heard anything like this. This is astounding. This is amazing. This is this is marvelous. But it's as far as it goes. &gt;&gt; Their experience doesn't go any further and that's as far as they're influenced. Now, there's an aspect of the message and I want to really nail this down. Not that you don't haven't heard it, not that you don't realize it, but it's something that I have to keep bringing myself up uh right in harmony with. And that is this message. The revealed word is none other than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ is present here. And the Bible tells us that down through history uh he showed himself in different forms. He appeared to Abraham as Melzdc. He appeared in an in a form of Elohim in a body of flesh and ate meat and butter and drank milk and spoke. Abraham at that time when he met him he fell to the earth to receive them three men but he said my Lord singular he appeared to Moses in a pillar of fire and he said who art thou Lord I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob but he was in a another form Nebuchadnezzar cast three men into a furnace and they went to see how they were. And I saw a form of a fourth man in the furnace. And he said, "The fourth man is in the form of the son of God." &gt;&gt; How he said that or what he knew, what he was looking at, I don't know. What did he look like? Yeah. &gt;&gt; John the Apostle in Revelations, our age, the Leodysian age, he sought Christ. He actually saw the person Christ outside of the door in a form and he's knocking on the door seeking to get admission inside. Brother Brandon makes many references. That picture hangs in many homes and it's considered, you know, such a beautiful picture and I don't know what people feel or what emotion they have when they see him knocking on the door and have beautiful roses and flowers, you know, an arbor or something going around the doorway and it's such a beautiful picture to brother Brandham said it's a tragic picture. He's on the outside. &gt;&gt; And that was actually taking place in this generation when a lot of you people were living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When most of us actually were living and and this person, whoever it was that John saw in whatever form he is in this day, was literally pushed out. Now, if you had have stood beside those soldiers and and perhaps you'd had some kind of mixed feeling, mixed emotion about seeing this rag put around his head and seeing men start to strike him. You might have been saying that's terrible. Uh he doesn't deserve that. You might have had all kinds of feelings, but that was the form that God took upon himself. And the Bible says he took upon himself the form of a servant. He took himself the form of a man, a flesh and and when he took the form of flesh, they were able to do that in that form to strike him and so on and had no virtue whatsoever. And a lot of onlookers and people who in the following days saw his crucifixion, the people, the public waged their heads and they got no virtue. &gt;&gt; They they saw that they saw an event in their time. I'm bringing you to this time when there's been an event in this time in your day when that same man &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ in your day has been forcefully pushed out. We want nothing to do with this man. He's been pushed out. Think about the people who pushed him out in this day. Push the word, the word, the word, the word. He came in word form. Word form. He he had a word shape. He was he was uh uh I can say so uniquely described in word form. And so the same people and the same spirit says we will not have this man rule over us. We're going to push him out. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to close the doors. And that is what they did. &gt;&gt; Now, I bring it here. Bring it to you this morning. How are you influenced by this man? What kind of influence? I thought of the world and the influence of men on our present society and this world that we have. The world has been greatly influenced and shaped by men that they consider as great men in the realm of science. I thought of uh Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton, Galileo, Stephven Hawking more currently in the realm of music, you know, you soon as you speak about music and the uh you think of Bach and Handel and Beethoven and Mozart and Schubert and Shopan. Then we have builders of faith such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses and Elijah and David and Solomon and John the Baptist and the apostles and the messengers. And brother Brandham said of John the Baptist, he said John was the greatest man on the earth at that time. And Jesus said there never was a man born of a woman as great as he at that time and he was a prophet. He said, "You believe that?" And remember, if the word of God will come to anything in the land, it'll be a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus with all the chaos and all the confusion, the man Jesus Christ in three and a half years affected the entire earth. Unquestionably, &gt;&gt; he set in motion something that was going to affect the entire earth. And people's even who are his enemies are affected by him. People who say he didn't exist are affected by him. People take up the issue and try to bring all kinds of falsehoods and about his resurre about his crucifixion, about his resurrection, h about his life and and the people who are around him. But he troubles them. He still stirs up the people. As they said in the scripture, he stirs up the people. He still stirs them up. &gt;&gt; He said when the Roman soldiers went back one time listening to him, he's referring to the scripture I read, never a man spake like this man. He said, we never heard man speak like this. He said it was not a man speaking. It was God. But that's what they didn't catch. They didn't come back to their leaders and say we heard God. &gt;&gt; They didn't pick that up. &gt;&gt; Said never a man spake like this man. That was absolutely the truth. But he said it wasn't a man speaking. It was God. He said man didn't speak like that. He said a man tells and speaks the scripture but Jesus made the scriptures live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can say we're following a certain message. &gt;&gt; And one thing I'm I'm identified. I'm I don't have to make the message work. I had a messenger that made the message work &gt;&gt; and I am identified with that. It doesn't say that all the apostles went and did exactly what Jesus did as they were following him. They were identified with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Holy Spirit came and they went on with the ministry of Jesus Christ which continues to today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said a man didn't live like this. The scripture says this here. Here it is. Man can say that the scripture says it. But that's about all man can do. So man can say the scripture says this and the scripture says that. But he's saying a man can say that that the scripture says it, but that's about all he can do. But Jesus said, "I and my father are one." &gt;&gt; My father dwells in me. He that seen me has seen the father. Nobody else could say that. But I want to say hallelujah. Because of the word, because of the message that we have received on the same authority, we can say today, I and my father are one. Because we've been told we came from the genes of our father. Is that the truth? Is that what the word says? We've come from the genes of our heavenly father. We've come here to manifest whatever he has spoken of this day. God didn't just speak about a messenger. He didn't just speak about a prophet messenger. He spoke about an elect lady that would be called out by that word and that there would be a people in this season that would believe that word and they would see him. They would have right and have access to everything that he sent for this time. &gt;&gt; And we do &gt;&gt; and it works and we see it on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; On a regular basis. I see Satan defeated. I see demons cast out. I see healing take place. I see miracles take place. Hallelujah. That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; And the scriptures live. So God, the Bible says, he took the form and being found in fashion of a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. And I am I'm really wanting to get near to you this morning with this message because I just wonder how influenced we are and how much we respect this man. Luke 17:30. I says a preacher can speak of a scripture. So I can say Luke 17:30 in that day the son of man will be revealed. But I'm going way beyond that. I'm saying how do we respect this man? Say what man? This one that has come in a form. He didn't come to you in a pillar of fire. He didn't come to you as he did to Job in a whirlwind. He has not walked into your home or come into your yard in a body of flesh. And you need the same revelation. You'd have to have a special a very very special thing happen that you'd be able to recognize and look at a man in a fleshly form and realize that God was veiled behind this skin. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this friend. That would take an incredible revelation. &gt;&gt; That to me would take a greater revelation than to believe he came in word form. And that was the trouble they had when God became flesh. And that's a trouble the Jews still have. How can God have a son? How can he have a son? And if and if this was the son, it's Christian Solomon said to me, "How could God see his son die? The one who even said, "Thou shalt not kill." How can he take and destroy his son or allow his death complete something irreconcilable to their thinking? He has actually you know as far as religion is concerned as far as church organizations are concerned you know we've got books brother but bram said this is God on written page that's God in print that tell you something What form was he in while he was outside knocking? What form? What what what do we say? Behold, I stand at the door knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and s with him and he with me indoors in a door in 1965. His ministry is just coming to a conclusion. He said, "But he but here he's outside outside are creeds and things that run him out of the church." The creeds, which is also word. But there was people believing those creeds say, "We believe them. We endorse them. We embrace them. &gt;&gt; We've given ourselves to them. We're identified with these creeds." If the creed says that you're baptized certain way, you're sprinkled a certain way or whatever you're supposed to do, that's what I am going to my body is going to do that. And my mouth is going to declare it because this is the creed. And in the meantime, the creed and the people in whom the creed was embodied was pushing him out, physically pushing him out. And John saw him being pushed out. John saw him finally on the outside and now we have now we have a time that has arrived in the history of mankind and a prophet is raised up said he's out outside he's outside now he's been pushed out and the messenger in whom the word came to the word comes to the prophet so now the prophet himself because he has a different word, a different message. He physically is being pushed out until he says all the doors are closed. &gt;&gt; Said to the people in Tucson, I've been here for x amount of time, haven't had any invitation. Why? Because that scripture was being fulfilled in him. &gt;&gt; And now we recognize this man, &gt;&gt; not the prophet messenger. We have to recognize him or you can never recognize who sent him. &gt;&gt; Jesus. That's why he kept saying to the man who were said never a man spake like this. He said uh I've been sent here. I'm going to the one that sent me. He that is with me. And they knew nothing about him. So he said he's been they run him out of the church but he's standing out there. Oh, I hope you can see what I'm saying. He's standing out there and here is his representative standing out there. He said he's standing out there still knocking. That's right. &gt;&gt; There was a messenger standing out there knocking, trying to gain entrance so that the people could hear glorious things. &gt;&gt; That we've heard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got pushed out. &gt;&gt; I'm glad they closed the doors on me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad they in essentially said don't come back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And while those doors were being closed sometimes with you with the church or the family or the religion or whatever more other doors was opening &gt;&gt; hallelujah and so I just so glad to be identified &gt;&gt; with the doors that God has opened. So we have felt that &gt;&gt; double pressure &gt;&gt; being pushed out. Said he's pushed out. He says, "And if and and he that will hear and open the door, I'll come into him and s with him and give him healing for his eyes." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And close and give him the riches of heaven. He that will hear me knock. &gt;&gt; My friends, this isn't some word. That's not a quote. This is an event. &gt;&gt; This is just as real as the woman touching his garment. &gt;&gt; It was happened to be that form that day. Now it's another form. Happens to be a word form. A word form. When you hear the message, it's actually the form of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's his form. &gt;&gt; That's the form he decided to have in our time. &gt;&gt; You might say, why? Well, I think probably why this is the day of books. This is the day of advancement. This is the day when men, you know, revel in the fact that they're intelligent and they've got, you know, they've got their libraries and they've got all manner of means of transmitting information. &gt;&gt; Text. &gt;&gt; So God says, "Well, okay. That's the way Satan's going to arrange it. My enemy is going to make it as a real intelligent society, a civilization, oh advanced, and they're probably going to have an image set way up. And the image won't be the form of man, it'll be the form of a brain. People are so consumed with what the brain, you know, how many cells it has and what you can do with the brain and and oh, we have things of, you know, learning and learning and pressing people to learn and higher education, higher education, &gt;&gt; right? I had when I was working and I was president of a company and we had to hire some people and there was a guy down there sweeping the floor getting ready to so they could make ready an area for a sales area. Sweeping the floor and uh one executive said uh you know what that fellow is? I said no. Oh, we we got him. He's, you know, he's been going to university. He's he's either got his doctorate or he's got something else and he has all kinds of, you know, letters behind his name and all the rest, but he was sweeping the floor for me. What What was the problem? Well, he was so highly educated, he couldn't hardly find work. And I and and on the other hand, he didn't know what he wanted to do. He was a professional student. If you're a professional student, you never find out what you're going to do. He didn't know what he wanted to do yet. I don't know. I say like brother Garald. Okay. Anyway, anyway, we go on. He said in the events made clear one of the last services there's not another age another church age that Jesus was on the outside not another age hello folks &gt;&gt; you are living in a time this is not some just poetic language this is an actual event there was and here's a prophet saying there was never another time in all history where he's actually put outside of the church and this is your day. So I I just if if that is true, I'm asking you what form is it? What form is he? &gt;&gt; And people could get a hold of that form sufficiently understand that form and say we don't want that in here. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if there's people that can grasp that and and and and they they see some sort of shape some and to them it's a doctrine to them it's just some words but it has sufficient shape said that's dangerous we don't want that in here there has to be another group &gt;&gt; that sees that form and to them they see clearly who that form form is &gt;&gt; it's not just a man walking in dust in I don't know whether he had sandals or bare feet coming to Abraham but what was it that came upon Abraham and said and fell down in the sand and said my Lord &gt;&gt; what was that whatever happened to Abraham you are Abraham's children and we must see the same one &gt;&gt; the same one coming to the children in the end time to res for the purpose of if it came in the purpose for Abraham to tell him Sarah's going to have a child. I'm here now to tell you that you're going to have a son &gt;&gt; and here we are waiting for the son for the son. And the prophet says the same thing that now it's to restore our faith back. where the children restore the faith back and tell us the son is on his way. In fact is that messenger was here to identify the time. This is the son. It's not me. It's him. &gt;&gt; I'm just a man, but it's him. &gt;&gt; No. Not many. And I don't know, sometimes I even question whether I should say certain things, but not many grasp it. And I said before coming into the platform this morning to the pulpit, I said, "Well, if there's one, I'm going to come to an account in the scripture." And Jesus refers back to this woman. She was the widow, a Shinomite. Uh, I'm sorry she wasn't a widow, but as a Shudomite woman in the time of Elisha when I have an opportunity, Lord willing, just a little bit later on. And Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom," now this is Jesus. "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. When the son of man is being revealed, what has it done to your eyes? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asks, "When the son of man," what was he saying? He was saying, "Now, you may say, well, this is so elementary to us." No, it's not elementary where I'm going, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When Luke 17:30 is happening, and he's saying it is happening. &gt;&gt; What's happening to your eyes? I'm saying it to this congregation. I'm saying it to all that. What happened to our eyes? Yes, we heard things and maybe intellectually we understood things. We saw them in the scripture. We had revelation as we understand it. But now, where is the presence of this one? What is it that you sense this morning from this one? Are you touching this one now? I'm not interested what happened 10 years ago. I'm interested what's happening now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm interested what's happening in this service. &gt;&gt; I'm wondering where our respect is and wondering, not that I don't see it. I'm just wondering at what level, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; our respect is. &gt;&gt; We can show respect by saying, "How do you do?" And we shake hands with one another. We show respect. We may embrace a brother, a sister to a sister. We may say show honor to one another sometimes we don't I really think it greatly very much in fact is I don't think I know it hinders us very much I've been in a lot of foreign countries in India I've had people fall down and we've raised him up right away quickly. Brother Lonnie Jenkins and I had it several times. I've had others take my hand. Come. I couldn't even get off the the service. Just just close maybe the last prayer and before you could before you could almost blink. I couldn't move because the pulpit w the whole platform was absolutely crowded stuff crowded with people and people wanting to take your hand and one man took my hand and laid the hand on his children teenagers lay my hand bless bless bless them my son bless my daughter and give them blessing and I did that was his faith that was his respect And I did. And up came a a child about 8 years old that fell out of a building onto concrete on his head and had never spoken a word since and said, you know, bring him, pray for him. I I haven't hardly many of you have never heard this. I prayed for him and I said, say Jesus. He said, Jesus. His his parents just went ecstatic. &gt;&gt; Say, was it the person? No. had nothing to do with me. Had to do with their approach. &gt;&gt; Had to do with their respect. Had to do entirely with them. What they were doing. And they it's not the person they were coming to. But in honoring that, they were honoring the God. Whatever gift it is, they were honoring the God who sent it. Says God has sent this to us here. I say God has sent this message. God has sent this messenger. God has intended that all the glory that he has and all the power &gt;&gt; that he's invested in that should flow through to those who can honor it and respect it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have brothers here from Congo and other parts of Africa. I here in this church I find a great difference between us North Americans and these that came say from Africa. They will as men who are not children are not even young people anymore. And you young people listen and they will call me and say I need to see you brother Biscll come into my office say I'm thinking of marriage and I'm coming now to you pastor to ask you if it will be all right if I have thoughts of marriage and do you have someone in mind. Well, yes, I would like to contact. I would like to speak now to my parents, but they've come to me first. Not that I want them to come first, but they have honored the office. And I know as I know my as well as I know my own name, that the God that they honored, it just flows. It bypasses me. It just flows to them. and they're the beneficiary &gt;&gt; for what they've done. &gt;&gt; So many times here in North America here, you know, it comes to the grapevine. Oh, you know, so and so is going with so and so. Oh, is that right? Okay. Yeah, so and so is going with where did you meet them? Oh, I met them on the internet. Good luck. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm not giving you computer text language. I'm giving you the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you the form of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the message. &gt;&gt; The message is a man. &gt;&gt; He's been put out by so many others but opened the door of others. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's many that are around it. There's many that look at it. There's many that sympathize with it. There's many that fellowship with it, but don't get the benefit of it. &gt;&gt; You may be glad when this one's over. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says very clearly that this is the day when the son of man, this day the son of man is being revealed. And I say we are still here. So he's he has not ceased being revealed. He is a man. &gt;&gt; He is in a form. Maybe you haven't caught the form, but he's in a word form. And you're hearing part of his form. You're seeing part of his form. If you hear a message, you'd say, "I see it." I say, "You've seen the man. You've seen a part of the man." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; One time you may look into his eyes. You hear the form. You see it in the form. You hear it in the word form and it's touching you and it's moving you and you see the glory of his face. the next time and maybe another message and you see the sternness and the sobriety and and the next time you see the compassion and the next time you hear words of of of warning and words of judgment not upon the people of his elect but upon it's it's a warning of judgment and you you'll realize this is a serious serious not faith not a belief not a church but this man I hope I'm making my point. This is a man, friends, &gt;&gt; the son of man, &gt;&gt; God in the form he decided to come to in your generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ask a couple of questions. How should we correctly respect the man Jesus Christ that's revealed amongst us? How should we respect him? Should we say, "Well, we're in church, but I've got a roast on, and I sure hope that this service doesn't go on too long. We've got this thing to do, and we've got that thing to do." I just want to say how important is that in relationship to this man. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that this man is what this is all about here, you belong someplace else. &gt;&gt; We're here because the son of man has been revealed. And every minister that gets behind this pulpit, I I believe that that is his sincere purpose. That's his whole will and desire, oh God, that you will make yourself known. Amen. &gt;&gt; Reveal something further. &gt;&gt; We say reveal something further. The message I say reveal something further of the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The person &gt;&gt; he still has feelings. He still can be put out. &gt;&gt; He still can be received. He still can be invited. He still can be spoken to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can be communed with. &gt;&gt; Hello, folks. When was the last time you actually communed with this man? When's the last time you had a conversation with him? This man. There was a man one day. I think he was uh I don't know. He was some little preacher that was not really noticed. I I think he was a preacher. I'm not too sure. He was a preacher. And God spoke to him in prayer and said, "I want you to go and spend this day and go to everybody and tell them I love them." And he spent that day. He said it was a remarkable day. It was incredible because of course now the force and the reality. It was something real and he could say it because it was a personal commission to him and he went out that day and just said those words. I've been sent to tell you Jesus loves you. And had a powerful effect. &gt;&gt; He can still be communed with. They can be spoken to. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when Jesus in his life on earth only ask one thing of the father only one thing. Father I will that they can be with me where I am. He said he asked for your fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing he asked for. with your fellowship. What does it what does that do to you? How does it make us feel? Makes me feel like crumbling. Makes me feel like falling down. Makes me feel like turning around in my chair and falling on my knees saying, "Oh, God. I want to come to an account. Maybe you'd like to turn in your Bible and this will be it's a fairly lengthy scripture, but I want to just take it some verses out of 2 Kings the 4th chapter. And please don't read ahead of me. in the fourth chapter at the 8th verse and we're going to read some scriptures and then I'll come back to them. And it fell 2 Kings 4:8. And it fell on a day that Elisha passed to Shunim where was a great woman and incidentally it's the only time it ever appears in the scripture. A great woman and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread. And she said unto her husband, "Behold, now I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passes by us continually. Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall, and let us set for him uh there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick. And it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither. If you just look now this way, please. We want to see the we want to see the picture. There's no place in all of the recorded story that we're going to read that she knew that he was Elisha. She didn't know that he had a double portion of the spirit of Elijah. She just perceived that this was a holy man. &gt;&gt; This was a holy man. &gt;&gt; And he's going by our place continually. And so the scripture says that she constrained him. &gt;&gt; She was a great woman. She was great because of her character. And she constrained him. And I was looking at that word constrained. It was that she was courageous and she prevailed upon him. She was resolute. &gt;&gt; She wasn't going to receive no for an answer. She was already resolved and resolute that this man must come in. and and and that she could her prayer was for no her her uh expression was for no personal gain. She didn't want him in to get anything. &gt;&gt; She didn't want him in because she had a certain desire for anything. She had no self-interest whatsoever. Her whole desire was to pour out a blessing upon this one who she perceived is a holy man of God. &gt;&gt; So many people come to the message this man. I need this. I want that. I need my family fixed. I need my marriage fixed. I need my kids. I need this. I need something financial. I need something. That's not the program. The program isn't what we need. What I want my desire. my me this that. That's not the program. And that's why many I'm announcing to you, you don't get it. &gt;&gt; That's not the program. The program is what can I do for him? What can I do for this word? What can I do for this message? How can I pour out my life for it? &gt;&gt; It's not what he can do for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; She saw him not once. She saw him go by. Everything's in order. She talks to her husband. She's a very courageous woman. She's resolute. She can put on the pressure. She says to this man with double the spirit of Elijah on him. She constrains him. She had it in her. I just want to I want to give him a rest. See this man go by he's a holy man and the Bible says he comes in. We'll continue to read verse 11. And it fell on a day that he came hither and he turned into the chamber and lay there. And he said to Gahhesa his servant called this Junomite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. And he said unto and he said unto him to his servant, see now to her, behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care. What is to be done for thee? Would you that we uh be spoken to for to the king or to the captain of the host? That's the senior officers of the army. And she answered, "I dwell among my own people." Now, I want you to look this way again. Elisha said, "Thou has been careful for us with all this care." And I took my Hebrew Bible and reading in the Greek linear Hebrew Bible says, "And you have been careful." And the Hebrew says, "And and you have trembled." And my eyes fastened on that because I'm already in the whole spirit of the service. I'm in what God is saying to me. And you have trembled. I was, how is that? And I I went and I I was studying that. And the scripture says very very clearly in the Hebrew that you have approached us trembling. you've approached us trembling with desire to serve. She came with such reverence. She just didn't say, "Oh, I see he's a man of God. I see, you know, this is a pastor. I see this as a prophet. I that that and that's probably why God left this as a record for us." She didn't say, "Oh, this great Elisha is going by." She wasn't influenced by that. She wasn't influenced by some high position that he held. She didn't know maybe that he knew the king. She didn't know that he knew the head of the army. For the prophets in those days were very well connected. She just sees he's a holy man. This is a holy man. &gt;&gt; Come. You must eat here. I see you go by and I won't receive. I I can't receive no for an answer. This is where you pass by continually and you must Hey, is that a big thing? God put that in his word. She wanted him to eat. And every time then he went by, he turned in there and he's laying on his bed, the bed that she had her husband make. Called the woman, gaze, I called a woman. She stood in the door. What can we do for you? Gazes ask her. Can we say something to the king on your behalf? How about the head of the army? Can we say something to the head of the authorities here for you? She said, I just live here among my people. Gesa said, she hasn't got a child. She has no child. And he said, "What then can be done?" Verse 14. And Gahesa answered, "Verily, she hath no child and her husband is old." And he said, "Call her." And when he called her, verse 15, "She stood in the door." And he said, "About this season according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son." And she said, "Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmmaid." That wasn't being disrespectful. Says, "And the woman conceived and bear a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life. And when the child was grown, it fell on a day that he went out with to his father to the reapers. And he said unto his father, "My head, my head." And he said to the lad, "Carry him to his mother." And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon and then died. and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out. Now I want you to look this way. Okay. I had to ask myself reading this account, how many of us would have done that? And I had to be honest, say probably very, very, very few if any. If it had been my son, I don't know if I I don't know if I'd have gone and laid him on the prophet's sleeping bag. And this woman, this mother, her boy, they say about 12 years old, died on her knees. I can see her pick him up. She's still that resolute woman. takes that dead form, lays it on the prophet's bed, goes out and closes the door. Didn't say that she wept and wailed and got into emotional hysteria, calling on God. She closed the door and called for her husband. And she said, and she went up, laid him on the bed of the man of God, and closed the door and went out. And she called unto her husband. I want you to notice very carefully and said, "Send me, I pray, the one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again." Look this way. There's no record that she even told her husband the boy died. &gt;&gt; It's not in the scripture. There's no record. She said to call her husband. Send me one of the young men. Send me one of the asses. I'm going to the man of God. And even her husband said, and he said, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." And she said, "It shall be well." He said, "This isn't the Lord's day. This isn't a holy day. This isn't some Sabbath or new moon. Why are you going to the man of God? &gt;&gt; She hasn't told him our son died. &gt;&gt; Now you know, you can see early in her actions and early in her words, there's the seeds of resurrection are right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that seed of resurrection, that seed of life is still in her. Why? Because of her respect &gt;&gt; for the man of quad. And God looks upon it and tells and says that record in his own mind. That record shall go down as a permanent record for all peoples of all time. This is what I honor. It'll be in the word of God clearly. &gt;&gt; That's my form. Amen. &gt;&gt; It shall be well. Verse 24. And then she saddled an ass and said to her servant, "Drive and go forward and slack not thy writing for me except that I bid thee." So she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, I tell you. She wasn't riding in a in a in in one of our modern automobiles, air conditioned. She's telling her young the young man that's driving, "You drive and go go hard and don't ease up for me. I'll tell you if I need you to slow down. Just keep going." And when the man of God saw her a far off, he said to Gahhesi his servant, behold yonder is that Chunomite, run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with thy child? And she answered, "It is well." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. woman hasn't even told her husband that the boy's dead and he's laying up on the prophet's bed and she's on her way to Mount Carmel. Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your son? It is well. And thus we have the song. I don't know if you even know it. You sing it all the time. It is well. It is well. That's why all is well. &gt;&gt; The brides heard the message. All is well. And when verse 27, and when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet. She caught him by the feet. You might say that was customary at that time. That doesn't say so. She's being driven by one thing and that is her honor and respect for the man of God. And she caught him by the feet. But Gahesa came to thrust her away. And the man of God said, "Let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her, and the Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me." Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my Lord? Did I not say, "Do not deceive me." And then he said to Cahesi, "G up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, salute him not. And if any salute thee, answer him not again, and lay my staff upon the face of the child." And the mother of the child said, "As the Lord God, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. and he arose and followed her. And Gahesi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was neither voice nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awake. And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. He went into He went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the Lord. And he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands. And he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm. And then he returned and walked to the in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon the child. And the child sneezed seven times. And the child opened his eyes. And he called Gahhesi and said, "Call this Shunomite." So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, "Take up thy son." That's what he told her to do. take up thy son. Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out. This is an incredible. You might say, why have I lingered and why have I detailed this in such a way? Simply because we're people of habit. We're creatures of habit. We live a life in a certain order, etc. There's no record that this woman had the custom of doing that. But she identified a man with with such respect that she laid hold on more than one occasion and held him, caught him, and held him by the feet. He takes his staff and says, "Ghesi, go and lay this on the child." She said, "As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not let you go. You must come." That persuaded him. It wasn't that. I believe all of that happened to give us a full a full scope, a full picture of what was in that woman. And I personally believe this generation, friends, I hope I can conclude. I want to conclude the service in the next few minutes. This generation is a very disrespectful generation. This generation does not teach respect. Not of authorities. People don't respect school. Children are not taught to respect the teachers. The public do not respect peace officers. Police which we have several here. We we are not raised in homes to actually respect parents. say children, young people, I'm going to just tell you quickly. I hope I have sufficient time. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave me a position and my father worked for me. He was my employee. He was probably the lowest man on that totem and I was the president. But I'll just tell you, when he and I got together in the business, in the office, he was my daddy. He was my father. And I came out of his loins. And I respected him. And I had all kinds of people come and say, "I wish I had that relationship." You're like a brother. You two are like brothers. We had a wonderful relationship. But I never even knew I was a man, married man with children coming up into their teens. He was my father and I respected him as my father. I respected what he said and he respected me as a son. I wasn't just some, you know, piece of dirt. He respected me and that influenced me. Respect is connected to influence. You can't be influenced by something you don't respect. So now I come to this man, this one we call the son of man, Jesus Christ revealed. How deep is the respect? How do we respond to it? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to go up these doors today with a change of heart and a change of of of of maybe your response and the way you treat this word. &gt;&gt; I've said it many times. I've said it at conventions, the tapes. That's not background music. &gt;&gt; That's not something just for someone to be carrying on some noise in the room. &gt;&gt; That's God's messenger. coming with thus saith the Lord and the presence of God. And he said, you know, I I I even said to the Lord this morning, I said, you're never one time, not one time were you ashamed, oh mighty God, to come and present yourself right there. No matter what the name of the title of the sermon was, every time that he that he called a people before him, you were there. You were there. You revealed the secret of their heart. You were there. in attendance and you know nothing about time. Same God that was theirs right here at this moment, the same time. If he could find in us the same respect, the same honor, &gt;&gt; the same coming and taking him by the feet as it were, the feet of the son of man, you'll find your life turn around. You'll find you won't even have to ask for blessings. They will come. &gt;&gt; The woman didn't say, "My son died. My son died. Come, oh prophet, my son died. No, rather, she said, "Everything's fine. All is well, &gt;&gt; but I'm here and I've got you by the feet." He knew something. He even said, "God has held it from me. I don't know what's happened." Gesa, take the stick, lay it upon the son because he saw that she was vexed. Said, "I won't let you go. You must come. I can tell you friends, that's the only way you're ever going to get anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you really really get something from God is our approach. Our respect. I'm going to be closing right away, especially for young people, not just young people. I see it. I flip through the newspaper. I don't get one to my door, but they bring a couple rags there. I see magazines on the airplane. I see it and I see the styles and the you know that become popular. I see things that become popular right away. I want to go into the other realm. I want to go into that realm of the spirit. And I say to myself, who inspired this? Who actually brought this on? I hear certain phrases and you know, we're we're a a a a joke laughter generation and not a not a whole lot of respect. Very very little. One thing I want to compliment you, the people here. I believe that there's a great wonderful respect amongst the people. But nevertheless, Brother Lance's last service was a was a quiet, very, very deep, thoughtful time for all of us. It was a serious service of how we speak and what comes out of our mouth. And I want to take that just a step further. Not only what you say, but you might not even say a word, but it's how you act and how you feel towards one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's something I want you to this isn't something you can just self-generate, but it's something you want to keep on your mind. Say God sent our pastor to speak about this today and then and you're not respecting a person, not respecting a person for what they've achieved or what they've accomplished or for how they look. You're you're respecting them saying God before the foundation of the world saw this individual &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus Christ to go to Calvary and have his heart stabbed and have the blood which was the purchased price to buy them and sent them at this time to sit in the same church with me and to be my brother and to be my sister to be my friend to be my my associate. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let me respect them. &gt;&gt; And in so doing, you're respecting the whole plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're respecting the whole the whole plan. So you're respect you're actually respecting God because he's the one who who did all this. He's the one who sent them. &gt;&gt; He's the one who gave the gift. He's the one who gave the talent. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not here by my own choosing. &gt;&gt; I would far sooner be someplace else. I'm not here by my own choosing. It's not me that wants to sit till late till midnight on a Saturday night and through the week. It's not it's not it's it's not you that necessarily want to be be here and grind through the through the border as you do for the and whatever more and move and pull up roots and be transferred and hey friends it's not because of you know just some person not because you just have some desire but there's a certain kind of respect am I making sense to you this morning and and I'm telling you that as you honor that you're honoring God and God's blessings come upon a person and you can't you can't even describe the blessings. Where are they coming from? I don't know. They just come. &gt;&gt; It comes upon your family. It comes upon your comes upon your home. It comes upon every aspect. And I'd say I'd say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before God, if you catch the key and the secret of what I'm saying to you this morning, your life will be at peace. Your life will be greatly rewarded and you'll be able to say whatever the circumstances, you'll be able to say, "All is well." &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; It's all well this morning. &gt;&gt; You can say, "All is well." &gt;&gt; Let's stand. We just bow reverently. Lord Jesus Christ. We're praying to the God that is not only with us but is in us. Lord Jesus, Father God, in your in your design, and I'm seeking just to grasp in my mind, in my soul, my inner being. You've called us here. That's why we're we're not just a a bunch of humans crawling over the face of the earth, but we have been sent here by design. We've sent been sent here according to a plan. And you have written the script for this plan. You have laid it out. If it was a if it was a flowchart, you laid out the flowchart how that we should come in a certain season and we would interact with others in the same season. We we would have a certain desire which would come from you and it would cause us to make certain choices and send us in a certain direction. We would meet a certain person and oh God and that would have an effect and our lives would have an influence. And now we find ourselves here this morning. And I am I'm declaring to these people, the same one that stood there with the prophet messenger this day. You stood at the platform. You revealed the secret of the heart and you're still a revealer of the secrets of the hearts. Lord, you know what the people were thinking when they came in this morning. You know what they've gone through in the last week. And you know better, oh God, than any of us ever know what's going to be in the next five minutes. What's going to be this day? what's going to be tomorrow. I pray, oh God, you'll find hearts that are so pliable, hearts that are so agreeable, hearts that are so alert, oh God, let us not be dull, made dull by our environment, in this generation, in this society, oh God, but let us be quickened, I pray, quickened, quickened by your spirit and quickened by your word. I pray Lord you'll help me, oh God. And let our words, oh father, be seasoned. May they be seasoned by the Holy Spirit. May we re appreciate, Father, what you have done in this day. And may we appreciate the bride of Jesus Christ. May we appreciate one another. I'm praying for young people that they might respect their parents and that parents will live honorable lives that spawn respect. Lord, may the ministry do the same. Our deacons and our trustees, may we always remember, Lord God, we are here as part of this form of this word form. for you've come in bride form also. Lord, I ask that it will be a very clear, very clear subject to the people, something they can take and partake of and digest. Ask that you will prepare us for the coming week, Lord, and the services and what is taking place, the meeting in Seattle today and the Lord's table communion next Sunday. Lord, I pray that you'll prepare us. Prepare us the name of Jesus Christ. And let your people be victorious over sin, over unbelief, over sickness, over death in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. All is well. All is well. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Once again, all sing it as your own testimony. [Music] We have heard the message of God. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] A perfect [Music] will for all. &gt;&gt; I feel that this is a very important time. I'm conscious of the time, but I don't want to be conscious of the time in relationship to his presence and what he's doing. Next Sunday, the communion is going to be at four o'clock, in case I didn't say. We're just going to have a short break between the services. So, those that have traveled up, traveled some distance, we'll be able to return home in good time, 4:00 next Sunday. [Music] I trust you'll take these words. This was really almost two services but I felt that I would go through it today. I want to sing uh it is well with my soul. You know I guess uh God allows us to have little experiences. I think this last week I possibly missed death by one second and it would have been certain death. I don't say that my family is not aware of it except my wife and one other person. But I turned to make a left turn and there was a young man walking across the intersection that never looked for traffic and I think maybe he had earphones in. I don't know. He was just going along very slowly and a huge uh gravel truck. I believe it was big semi with a pup trailer on behind and the light must have turned orange because he he booted it instead of instead of putting on the brakes and stopping. he decided to make it through the intersection and I was completely covering the entire lane and I just looked out my window and all I could see was grill of this huge truck and this boy is right in front of me about in his early 20s and I had two choices get three stay there and have that truck complete completely pulverize me with all this gravel and weight. Or run forward and strike this young man and knock him down or kill him or turn my wheel to the left and hit the traffic, which was just feet away cuz I was going nose tonose with the traffic that was parked there waiting to make the red light, the green waiting for the green light. And at that instant, the young man just saw the my car thrusting forward. And he took about three quick steps. And I gave my car the gas. It was going head-to-head with this car. And I just had enough space. I turned the wheel. And at that instant, this truck roared by, I would say, without exaggeration, between 40 and 50 mph. and it flashed and I it was improper, probably my fault, but I just drove off to the side of the road realizing [Music] that I could have been I could have been on the other side just that fast. I realize I don't want to go from week to week. I want to treasure every day. Want to treasure every moment. Want to treasure those that God has allowed us to walk together. I treasure this assembly. I treasure your love. I appreciate the dedicated consecrated lives that you live. And I speak this morning that you might know this one who's not a message as such. He's the son of man. The person. Lay hold of him. However you feel, talk to him. I'll feel rewarded if I know I can go out of this place and know that our Lord Jesus has been able now to commune with someone and have you speak to him differently and say this service would be more than sufficient for me, more than worthwhile for me. Lay hold of him. Other men were able. I want him to prophesy. lay hold of him not because you want something and say, "Oh Lord, do something for me. Oh God, I need this. I need that." Forget your needs. Say, "Lord, what do you need? What can I do for you? Here's a bed. Can I make something for you? Can I serve you?" Now you know. And I'm closing, but now you know. When I say if there's any blessing upon this congregation, if there's any blessing upon my own life, if there's any blessing that has come, it's become because of one one single purpose. And that is because I've always sought. And as a church, we've always sought to bless this word. We want to bless this channel. We want to bless this messenger's message. We want to see it get out to somebody else by living, by speaking, by doing every purpose, everything that we can do. Is this making sense to you? And I believe that when we do that, that showing respect to it. Amen. God blesses it. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you for your time. In peace life, [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] My soul is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. Oh sh [Music] [Music] my [Music] My soul is well [Applause] with My soul, my sin. Wonderful words. Shout it out for him. My heart. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Applause] Oh my soul, it is well. Hallelujah. With my soul. With my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. And Lord, haste the day. When my face shall be sign [Applause] My soul is well. What is well with my soul? With my soul. Well, it is well with my soul. Listen to these words now. But the Lord is for thee and for the coming the great Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] My soul is [Music] my soul. &gt;&gt; All the sisters to sing the chorus. [Music] My soul is [Applause] [Music] in my soul. &gt;&gt; Every son of God. It is [Music] my soul. with my soul. It is well with my soul. All together now just no music the voices. It is well [Music] with my soul. with my soul. It is well with my soul. Let us rejoice as we sing it again. It is well with my soul. My soul my soul. Hallelujah to our savior. Glory be to his name. Majesty and honor. Glory. I'm going to ask our brother Codle. Brother Codle, would you please come and pray a prayer upon the congregation, upon those that will be journeying to Seattle, upon the service down there, upon this people for this coming week? Did you receive something from God's word this morning? Can you take it? Can you act upon it? Will you come with a just an intensely sincere approach to God, real reverence. Let's have that for God's word. This is the son of man. That's why this church exists. That's what we're here for. Brother Codle, God bless you. Let's bow our hearts before the Lord.
