Her faith just reached up and that scripture was sitting there. Amen. Behold, a virgin shall conceive. Just a simple faith brought about the word of God. Amen.

I wonder if we could just open up our lives and open up our mouths and just worship him. Whatever's on our hearts, whatever's there, let's just express it to him. Oh father, there's many altars here this morning. There's many sacrifices, living sacrifices. Oh God, we want to die to ourselves at the start of this meeting. Lord, we want to let our own thoughts go. Lord, we want to let our own fleshly beings, Lord, just lay ourselves upon that place, that sacred place. This is your house. We're approaching the throne of your word, God. And your presence is here. You are here this morning to listen to the desires that we have. And Lord Jesus, may you come and consume every life, every need, every situation, every issue. Lord, our hands are lifted up. Oh Jesus, Lord, how we desire to see your glory and we invite your presence into this meeting right now. We invite your sacredness, Lord, to come by every heart, every need, every situation. We lift up our hands, Lord, as the least that we can do. Our hearts, Lord, the very least, our reasonable service, oh God, as to speak your name and to worship you, God. Father, we are not just here to receive, but we are here to give out and to worship. open up our mouths to let you know that we love you and we need you, God. We need you this morning, Lord Jesus. Come out of history. Come off of a book, Lord. Come out of just quotes, Lord Jesus. Be real to us today, God. We long for you. We thirst after you to see your glory and have that reality. God, we want to touch you this morning, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, Lord, let there be a death to us, oh God. Let there be a death to every life. &gt;&gt; Stir us again, God. Let your spirit move in our souls, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let nothing stand in the way, God. Forgive us of our sin. Forgive us of our iniquities, God. Anything that would stand in the way, let the blood be rich, oh God. There's a message being delivered. And there's blood all over it, God. There's life, there's truth, there's deliverance, there's salvation, there's healing, God. Lord, we just want you to be free to do whatever's on your heart, God. And we don't want to stand in the way. We don't want any flesh to stand in the way, Lord. May you do, Lord, more than we could even ask or think, God. And may you just move this whole day, this morning, this afternoon, and tonight, Lord. We are here as your people recognizing that you are doing something in your word and in our lives. And we want to submit to that totally. We want to give ourselves totally to what you're doing in every life, Lord. And if we need to pull for one another, if we need to pull for the one next to us, there's needs. There's lives, Lord. We are a needy people. So would you just move from heart to heart to life to life and let there be such a presence and your word be so rich to us God. We are looking to your word and to that voice. Minister today and pastor our souls and shepherd us Lord in places that only you can have your way today and be glorified. And let us be sensitive God. Let us as your people, God, be sensitive, Lord, knowing that there is a beat, the composer, Lord, that's put out the sheet music. There is a definite order to what you would have for us, God, in that spiritual realm where all things are possible. So be glorified today and show yourself, Lord, in areas and we'll give you glory and honor through our lives in Jesus name. Amen. according to your word, according to your promises.

You know, we don't need a camp meeting. &gt;&gt; We don't need a special speaker. &gt;&gt; We just need Christ to come down this morning. Amen. And if he could fill the temple with his glory in Solomon's day, then he can come this morning &gt;&gt; and fill our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as the preaching of the word goes forth, he can come down and touch your need from that cloud. Maybe just a lightning strike and clear out all whatever we'd have on our hearts. Consume the altar this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it once more. We are standing [Music] ground and I know that there are angels all around. Let us pray. Jesus. Now we are stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jeremy Wner has a special come this morning. You can have your seats. Number 257. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. And if you don't know it, the words are, "Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place." I can feel his mighty power and his grace. I can hear the brush of angels wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. [Music] Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his praise. I can hear the rush of angels wings. I see glory. Surely the rest of the Oh, surely [Music] the presence of the Lord is in this place. I feel his mighty power and his grace. I can hear the rush of angels. as he glor. [Music] I want to present the life of Christ. It's my aim today. For in his image I want to stand so blameless on that day. And though this world may criticize, it will never understand [Music] that I can't rest until I be a perfect man. What are you going to present to the Lord at the end of your journey? He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. What are you going to present to the Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position where you [Music] will be wondering why. Though the world may offer its pleasure and peace and luxurious life of ease, but it simply cannot continue on for man just like a breeze. A moment here and a moment gone. Like a flower, they fade away. [Music] But I just want to stay right on till that perfect day. [Music] Take rest my soul in no other arms. Save Jesus on today. For he has opened my eyes to see that judgement is on its way. And though 10,000 fall at my side, I will never be tossed aside. For in the shadow of that mighty rock is where I'll abide. [Music] What are you going to present to the Lord at the end of your journey? He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. [Music] What are you going to present to the Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position where you will be wondering why. [Music] Lord, take thy word, thy precious word, and anoint it to my soul. Perfect what is lacking in my faith, and make thy servant whole. Drive all fears and all doubts away. For I just want to hear you say, "Receive, receive thy crown, my beloved son. You have overcome. [Music] Well done." So, what are you going to present to the Lord at the end? end of your journey. [Music] He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. Oh, what are you going to present to the Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position. where you [Music] will be wondering why. Oh, don't be found in that position where you [Music] will be wondering why. [Applause] Amen. Well, we just want to greet everyone as the children are coming in visitors we have this morning. I want to make special welcome to brother Mario and sister Josephine Chua. I guess right here you can stand. Just want to welcome them all the way from the Philippines. Amen. God bless you and all the other visitors. See brother Andrew Coffee up there. But he's kind of a local in my books. So glad to have you here this morning. And all the visitors like to sing Ella Elohim as brother Ed comes. Amen. This be good to us. [Music] How we long to worship [Music] We long to worship him [Music] We worship you and [Music] I long to worship him. [Music] Let's [Music] all stand one more time as brother Ed comes. We also want to make mention of the young people's service this Friday, May the 11th at 7:30. And then also May 25th will be the last young people service before the summer. So there'll be two this month and then that'll be it. Amen. Sing it one more time. [Music] We worship you and [Music] we worship you. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you &gt;&gt; and you too. God bless you, brother Mario. Nice to see you, Sister Josephine and their children. My I sister Josephine is a registered nurse and applying I think for perhaps a position at St. Joseph's in Bellingham. Now we can all pray about that. And our brother Mario is a minister. Has ministered since 1990. Isn't that lovely? God bless him. And whatever door that God will open to him as well. Amen. Their children. You're welcome. Amen. God bless them. Brother Tom and Sister Joanne are in U. Brother Kelly Hilderbrand's church in Saskatoon, just north of Saskatoon. Brother brother Menof Freezen and their people were in the U Friday night meeting and many of them also in the Saturday night meeting and uh said they just had a glorious time. So many people and it was like like it's been here recently. They didn't want to leave the service. didn't want to leave worship. Didn't want to leave praying around the altar. Isn't that wonderful? Amen. We want more of that. &gt;&gt; We don't want just to hear words, but we want to see God amongst us doing things. Amen. Hallelujah. And we pray that he will do continue to do. Remember, he's a supernatural God &gt;&gt; and he can only do supernatural things. &gt;&gt; Are you needing something supernatural? Amen. We're standing in a good place. I had just written. We're standing on holy ground. I just finished written the line, writing the line. My pen was just leaving the paper. And I heard brother Jonathan and you as a congregation start to sing. We're standing on holy ground. I said, "That must be it. That's where we are today." Amen. We're in a good place. Don't you agree? Hallelujah. Amen. And so, uh, I mustn't forget to give you greetings from Brother Tom. He sent an email especially to have me greet you. Amen. Why don't we why don't we just sing that again? We're standing on holy ground. I can't get it out of my mind, so I might as well sing it. Hallelujah. We're having baptismal tonight also. That's special. Four or five young people being baptized. &gt;&gt; When they ask, then they're ready. And and sometime when you think they you see them come to the tank, just remember that's not something on the spur of the moment. The one one of the young people been asking for two years for baptism and then uh brother John has spent time with all of these people that are going to be baptized and we're thankful for that. One of the sisters that was going to be baptized been coming now for a number of weeks. Sister Leanne Dere has been bringing her Enga I believe her name is and uh I met we prayed with her here two three weeks ago. She's in the hospital and we uh she's unable to she was supposed to be baptized tonight at 83 years old. Uh and brother John was in visiting her. It's remarkable how God does things. Uh, brother Ba and sister Anne will be especially interested in this. They were visiting. Brother John was visiting this sister Eningga and then they needed to tend to her so he just stepped to another bed. There was a man laying there and it's brother Ed Bergman, brother Bergman's son. And he was a minister up in White Horse years ago and he's actually dying with cancer. He's been given a short time. You might want to go and visit him. He has leukemia and he has got a short time to live. And I thought it was so remarkable, you know, that someone from the congregation here goes to see uh a sister that's going to be baptized to be with her and pray with her and just steps over to another bed. And here's here's an oldtime friend of my own. And in fact, his his brother and sister-in-law stood up at our wedding when I and my wife were married. So that's just how long we've known them and was able to speak with him and pray with him. So, uh, God's ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts. And I'm so glad they aren't. They're so high above us. Let's step into that supernatural realm this morning. We're standing on holy ground. We are standing on [Applause] [Music] and I know there are angels all around. [Music] Jesus, now we praise you, Lord. We are standing in his presence on our gracious heavenly father, we think of the time that you chose to meet Moses. You attracted him to a burning bush which would not be consumed with the flame. And Lord, we have a flame burning within the bosom of our hearts and souls. And it will not be extinguished. And it does not consume, oh God, itself, in that it does not stop to burn. It's burning today. It was burning last week. It was burning last year. And it'll burn tomorrow. It'll burn until we are swept away in a rapture. Oh flame of God, burn up the dross and the emptiness. Burn up the world. Burn up anything that is not of you. Let this people be a holy people. Separated unto God, sanctified to this gospel. Thank you for your word. Thank you for your message and the messenger that you sent. And Lord, I pray that now as I stand at my post of duty, that you will enable, oh God, these lips and tongue to speak what you would have said. And let the hearts of the people be open. Oh God, I pray, Father, that every hard heart will be turned to a heart of flesh. I pray that you will inscribe with your finger your word and let let the Holy Spirit reveal, I pray, to us what you would have us to know. May this day be a blessed day in your presence in the name of Jesus Christ. And may that name be glorified. Amen. God bless you. While you're standing yet, if you'd like to take your Bibles and turn to First Peter, we're going to read a few scriptures in chapter 1, starting at verse 18. Once again, it's privilege to approach the scripture the service today. And for those of you that have been in the services, excuse me, in the recent weeks, uh, you'll be able to link them together. And I'm going to make some comments right after I've read read the scripture to help you link them together. It's uh, God is just really wanting to minister to us. So, I would ask for your undivided attention and just as little movement as possible. and God will be with us and all of those that are streaming the service today. Starting at verse 18 down to verse 23. For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was fore orained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God, seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of the incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; In Hebrews, just turn back to Hebrews in the 9th chapter, two verses, 11 and 12. Chapter nine, Hebrews verses 11 and 12. But Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood. He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats, keeping your thoughts on the scriptures we've just read. The services which we have just spoke and I'll uh draw your attention back to them. spoke a service on anointed for rapture. Another service immediately following the altar of your heart and then a another service following that sanctify the altar. I want to take you on a little journey today and it is the evolving or the unfolding of the word or what the what was in the mind of God, the thought of God and how it has unfolded down through time to the end time to the time that we're in. The anointing for example, it has gone from the first instance being mentioned in the scripture from don't think I'm repetitious now but just to establish it in your mind from Jacob anointing a stone all the way through until the scripture says but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you. That's a long distance. That's a quantum leap from a man a few thousand years ago pouring oil on a stone to now it coming and developing. But it's the same thought. &gt;&gt; It is an outpouring. And that's why they call it the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It's something from God being poured out and not onto but into a people. And it's God is transferring something of himself to those people that is needful for them in that age in that time. &gt;&gt; And so that is the thought of the anointing. Then we took the altar. The altar was uh the prophet even said there had to be an altar in heaven because there was a sacrifice on it. We'll be speaking about that. But in the in in in in uh w within the human realm there was altars of earth, altars of stone, altars of wood, altars that were altars of brass or they called brazen altar. Some thought it would be perhaps copper. That's irrelevant to us. But there was all different altars. And then we come to the end time and a prophet says the altar is your heart. We've gone a long ways from a pile of dirt and a stone to what's inside the inner man. That will, that resolve, that discernment that it's not up here, it's down here. And it's a place for God. And so when God thought of an altar, he was thinking of what you have, that capacity that you have, that's what God had in his mind. And then naturally when you speak of anointing and you speak of of an altar, then now you want to speak of sacrifice. So I spoke of on the sacrifice and to sanctify the altar in the sacrifices that were on the altar. And we've taken it all away from one that was in the heavens, which we'll speak yet extensively on it today, Lord willing, from a a sacrifice for he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. So there was a lamb sacrifice in heaven. And we bring it all the way down until we come to Calvary, which was the consummation. Everything that had been done was to reflect that sacrifice that would be there. He entered in once with his own blood. So it wasn't just at Calvary, but he rose and he entered in once with his own blood to to sanctify a people. And uh as the scripture which we read, not by the blood of bulls and goats, but he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption, eternal redemption for you. And and then in the last age, we come to the last church, the message to the last church age. And the messenger is receiving the message from Jesus Christ himself. And Jesus Christ is saying these things saith the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. Because at Calvary, it was not just a man dying. It was not just blood like you have blood, but it was blood that was newly created by God. He was the beginning of the new creation of God. God by through the words that he spoke through the prophets and those words lodged in the womb of Mary and that was the blood that was flowing in the veins of Jesus Christ was the royal royal seed blood. It was a newly created blood because he came as he came as a result of the spoken word of God and the life that was in him, the life stream, the life force that was in Christ brought the body of the his earth because he was of the earth also. His body was a part of the earth. And so the life that was in him now took this body of clay, this body of flesh, and and caused it to walk precisely according to every word that was written in the scripture. Taking the cursed earth and making it subject to the word of God, taking it to Calvary, spilt the blood, the life was dispersed and came back dawn into the believer. God anointing the believer, transferring into the believer his own life. We say God's life in the individual. &gt;&gt; And today I want to take redemption, the place of redemption. When you talk about the anointing, the altar, the sacrifice, all of that would be in vain if it didn't obtain redemption. Redemption. It's a releasing. It's a payment. It's a ransom. It's also a deliverance. It's the price that's been paid. Redemption. It's also to loose one that's bound. If you have any restraints or restrictions and bound in any way, shape or form, God intend that redemption free the individual. Everything in the scripture pointed to redemption. And that is why all the scripture says that all would would dwell upon the earth would worship the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. That's seen in heaven. The lamb slain before the foundation of the world. That scene speaks of redemption in regards to that scripture. Brother Brandham says, "Think of it. Before Jesus was ever born," is where a lot of people, some even in the message get mixed up on this. They ought to read this and just understand it very clearly. Before Jesus, Jesus the man, flesh man was ever born, but that which was in him was God. Before Jesus was ever born, 4,000 years before he came on the earth, and several thousand years before you came on the earth, before you came on the earth, Jesus Jesus before he was born, Jesus in the mind of God, in God's mind, died for the sins of the world. And the book of life was made. And your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world. It's not a new name written in heaven like the songwriter wrote and we don't sing it anymore because there's no new name written in heaven. The names were written there when God had the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and your name was written in the book of life, the lamb's book of life. And he said, "And you were there in his attributes. You don't remember it." No, because you're you're you're just a part of his life. You are a part of God when you become a son or daughter of God just as you were a part of your earthly father. So there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and prophet said further that if there's no altar of sacrifice and he was taking up a subject because there was a great Bible teacher a theologian by the name of Dr. Smith and this doctor had said that there is no altar of sacrifice. It was an altar of incense in heaven. And brother Brandham just took issue with it over for a moment. He was just saying to the people in case there was any of Dr. Smith's followers that were there, he said there's an altar. If there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven, where is the sacrifice for sin laying? The lamb, he said, then the lamb. He said there has to be a place. There has to be a place. I want this congregation, everyone that has confidence in what I'm saying. There has to be a place where the slaying lamb bloody is laying there and where the blood is can't be a geographical place. It's not a geographical place. It's not a theological place. It's not a doctrine. It's not just a way of of uh belief. It's not theology. But I want to propose to you and suggest to you today that the opening scene in heaven, a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and a book written and individual names are recorded before you ever came, before you were ever thought of. before your mother and father eons and eons ago, God wrote a book. I don't think it's a book like this. Science has brought this kind of a book, but God and and in God's mind and in his thoughts was a lamb was slain. I thought it was curious that when animals were created, there was such a thing as a lamb. And I thought it was really amazing that Adam, Adam who had the the he had the wisdom of God and he named all of the creatures according to their nature. He named them and when that lamb that young one came by he looked at that there's something said that's a lamb that'll be a lamb and he was expressing on earth the god of the earth for he was the made the god of the earth and his father which is god only god only one god only the god of creation and he has a son on earth now with expressing his thoughts and in god's mind was a lamb that had been slain and he knew he knew all things. I have to be careful so I don't get ahead of myself. And here's a lamb that comes now from the creation of the animals. And God's son says, "You're a lamb." And he names it and it would be a lamb. And there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. And there was an altar that was there. But now that scene points to the scene of the end. It has to point to a certain focal point, a certain spot. And I suggest that we're living at that place. Sometimes it's hard to comprehend. And so that scene in heaven spoke of this scene in the end. And yet it's vastly different. But the end scene, this end time scene interpreted that one. &gt;&gt; That one reflected to another time. But this one that we are living, we're living in an interpretation of what God had in his thoughts, &gt;&gt; in his mind. So the beginning scene in heaven pointed to the end time. And the scene of the end time reveals the opening scene. God spoke through Isaiah and he said this. You'll have to have your thinking caps on through the service. So just hang on. And if you and if you It's not deep. It's very simple, but there are some things to think about. God said through Isaiah declaring the end from the beginning. Not the beginning to the end, but declaring the end from the beginning. The beginning. God is declaring the end from the beginning. Exactly what I've just said. He's declaring the end seen from what happened in the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done. saying, "My counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; How God's plan unfolds and how it reveals itself in the message Christ is the mystery of God. Brother Brandham said, "Notice now down through the ages, he's been gradually, oh, I love this, gradually letting out this, letting this out, slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the types expressing himself." &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. Slowly, gradually. I'm glad it is gradually. We can hardly get it when it even is gradual. when we say altar, we think of the heart. Now, I I mentioned this last Sunday, but I want to just cause it to cause your thoughts to be aroused once again. When when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world, it's important that I say this. It might not seem relative, but it's important. I say it because it connects with the rest of the what's on my heart. There was a sacrifice, as I said last Sunday. I don't believe it was the same substance of the chemistry of the blood that flows in your veins today. I don't think that there was a chemistry of blood as we know blood on the altar in heaven. What form it was, I don't know. And there a lamb slain. Well, I don't think there was a physical lamb like we see running in the pasture. Someone may say, well, it was Jesus Christ. Well, no. Jesus Christ wasn't born. The man Jesus Christ wasn't born. But in God's mind and in his thoughts, and I believe that God projected those thoughts till it was a literal happening in his mind. And if I didn't believe that, I don't I I would have difficulty believing that he could actually have foreseen and foresaw us the way we are today, exactly as you are, dressed the way you are. And not only the way that we are sitting here, but what we have within us, what we're made up of. God knew all of that. He knew our needs back then, and he made a provision back then. And we're going down as a brother Brandon says is little humans creeping on the brittle threads of life and we have our various various needs. It's a ve very important that you're conscious. God didn't only know them but he's he's absolutely aware of everything this morning while I'm sitting here. &gt;&gt; But I would like to put it this way. I've got a number of statements. The altar and sacrificed lamb in heaven spoke of redemption. Redemption is something's got to be released. Something has to be brought back. God with the bloody skins to clothe Adam and Eve in Eden spoke of redemption. Incidentally, you that were here on the Monday night and heard the rabbi speak and he came to the the skins went through his uh dialogue about the skins. Soon as we stepped back in the study, I said, "If you saw some of the people smile, it was because that was my text last Sunday. I I I read the scripture of Adam with the skins." He said, "I'm sure that you approach it from a different direction. I said, "Yes, I certainly did." I said, "Those skins were bloody. &gt;&gt; They were bloody skins." And uh and just then someone walked in the office because I wanted to take it a little bit further. But those things make our our grand opportunities. So when God clothed Adam and Eve, he spoke of redemption. Abel, now watch watch it evolve, please. There's an altar in heaven and there's a slain lamb before the foundation of the world. What form? What substance? We don't know. But there it was. Now, a creation comes maybe hundreds of millions of years later, a creation comes and there's a fall. Well, that spoke of redemption because before the fall came, God knew the fall was going to come. &gt;&gt; And he allowed this conditions for the fall to happen. That's a God you and I can't understand. I'm glad we know what we do know. But you can't fully comprehend that. &gt;&gt; No one here can. But God, that's why there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world because it was a remedy before the disease came. is a remedy before death came. &gt;&gt; So it spoke of redemption. It spoke of redeeming back. So that very the very thought of redeeming back is declaring something's going to be lost. Something's going to be something's going to need redemption. And so now he comes and the scene is unfolded. Now it's God. See in heaven there's a lamb slain. Now we have God providing the bloody skins for a clothing. Speaking of redemption, then the next thing is we have Abel. Now a man, Adam didn't do it, but now Abel, a man, now he takes an animal. And the prophet says many times, Abel by revelation, by revelation. Revelation is more important to you, he said, than we have ever realized. Abel by revelation. How important that revelation was to him. What was it a revelation of? How did he even know which he had never seen? I don't believe there's any record. There's nothing to indicate in the scripture that he'd ever seen blood. How does he know that that substance exists? How does he know that that is what's required? But by revelation and the impulse of God's spirit by revelation. Revelation can cause a person to do some very drastic things. Revelation can cause a person to do things they don't understand. And I can guarantee you Abel didn't understand what he was doing fully. He didn't understand that he was making himself. He was he was offering a sacrifice that was absolutely essential. So now he takes but what he does points to redemption. And now it moves on from from what heaven to what God did to what now a man did, Abel did. Now the earth is filled with violence and God destroys it in the flood and eight souls walk out of the ark and Noah now it's first brother Brandham says that Abel had an altar. Cain had an altar but now we have the the scripture does not make reference to Cain or Abel's altar. It says that they brought these sacrifice or these offerings to God. But now we have a specific statement saying Noah built an altar. He built an altar. Now we have a reflection of something that was in heaven. Now is on earth. And he and and out of the few animals that he has, he offers sacrifices to God. And listen friends, it wasn't down just a something pointing towards redemption. But the Bible says that the sacrifice was a sweet smell in the nostrils of God. And because of that, God said, God was activated. God was moved by what Noah was doing. And God moved in such a way says, "I'll not destroy the earth again. I'm just going to take you for a great great leap and then come back. I'm going way to the end of the service." And because your heart's an altar and if you have the right thing on it, God is looking upon that sacrifice and he is accepting and having respect towards that sacrifice and is saying and has already declared and neither will you be destroyed. &gt;&gt; I'll not destroy you either &gt;&gt; because of what's on the altar is pleasing to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what Noah did and the altar he built and the sacrifices he made that pointed to redemption. And then it moves on. It evolves. It slowly gradually unfolds. Then comes Moses the first prophet and he in institutes altars many altars or many kinds of altars. many different places where the altars many different sacrifices but he institutes a priesthood that had never been Abel didn't have a priesthood. Noah didn't have a priesthood. There's no priesthood in heaven. But now that we see and now now we have a priesthood and there's a high priest and a priesthood associated with the altars and associated with the sacrifices. So it's evolving. It's getting larger. And then we find Abraham offering. Now Abraham, he makes an offer and now an altar, but now the thing is evolving and getting much larger. He's offering his son. &gt;&gt; Abel offered a a an animal. Noah built an altar and offered some animals. But now we have Abraham on Mount Horeb with his son on an altar and ready to slay him. And although God stopped him, God accounted that he had slayed his son and raised him from the dead because that was the faith. The faith and God was looking. Now watch, God was not looking merely at what was physically happening. God was looking at the faith of the man who was doing it. And because a Abraham was willing to offer his son, God in the New Testament says as though he raised him from the dead because Abraham was prepared to slay him knowing his by his faith because God had promised him this son, God would have to raise him up again. &gt;&gt; And God accounted that to him as righteousness because he believed God. So where was God looking? He was looking beyond Isaac laying on the altar to what was laying on the altar of Abraham's heart. &gt;&gt; Always beyond what was physically happening. You might you might kneel at an altar here. You might stand and worship. You may raise your hand. You may do some things or you may not do anything. But God is going to look at your heart. And then we have Elijah, a restoring prophet. And now before before fire comes down from heaven on on the altar that there is no altar, he has to this God is showing reflecting through this all the types and shadows that there's going to be a time when the spirit of Elijah which is a restoring spirit is going to have to repair altars, heal altars, restore them. And what does the scripture say? Behold, I send Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord. And he shall he shall turn, same word. He'll restore, he'll turn back the heart of the people, the heart, the heart, the altar have to be turned back. The altar have to be repaired. There'd be a day when the inner being of man would need a voice from God to restore it back, to turn it back to God. And &gt;&gt; I tell you, there isn't a man, woman, or child here that doesn't need that voice. It's a restoring voice. And then when God saw what was on the physical altar, but before he even saw that and before the fire came, Elijah had said to God, "Let it be known that I have done all of these things at your command." So it was Elijah's obedience to the word of God, which resulted in an altar being built and a sacrifice being made and fire coming down from heaven consuming the sacrifice. A lot of people get all caught up with the fire that came down from heaven. Just remember there was a lot that preceded that &gt;&gt; and that spirit of the spirit of Elijah had to rebuild the altar. And many times before you and I could offer anything to God, there are a lot of people offering wonderful uh sacrifices, physical things. They're paying their tithes. They're attending church. They're praying. They're saying the Lord's prayer. They're doing all of these things. But I tell you, the heart needs to be healed. The heart needs to be restored. The heart needs to be turned back to God. And then God looks upon that altar. The scripture was very specific. And all of these things pointed to redemption. And then Jesus, the son of God with the blood of the new creation, comes onto his altar. Brother Brandham talks about his altar being the cross in the message. Pardon. He said it wasn't very long until the lamb was nailed to his altar. &gt;&gt; The cross, the lamb was nailed to his and it wasn't we sang there. Some songwriters have written some beautiful songs. It wasn't the nails that held him there. &gt;&gt; It was his love, &gt;&gt; his obedience to his call. &gt;&gt; He said, "No man takes my life from me. I lay it down &gt;&gt; and I will take it back up again." And so now we have journeyed from heaven to Eden to Abel to a to Noah to Abraham to Moses to Elijah. And it keeps unveiling, unfolding, unfolding, getting larger and larger. And now we have the lamb &gt;&gt; on the cross &gt;&gt; nailed to his altar. And what was in him was a new creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God starting a whole new creation by the spoken word of God down through the prophets lodged into the womb of a virgin. And she brought forth Jesus Christ. But thousands of years before, maybe like eternities before, it was all in the mind of God. And there was the lamb. But that wasn't all. He entered in once with the blood, but he gave up the ghost. And then the scripture could say, "And you," if that event had not taken place at Calvary, the other scripture which I already read, "And you have an anointing that abides in you." that could never have been spoken if he had not dispensed with his life. And the spirit, the life that was in that bloodstream of Jesus Christ was released and brought down onto a people. Many people claim to have it today. But here's where we're going to really get to the crux of the matter. The price of redemption now had been paid. The price of redemption had been paid. And when the prophet now I want you to see, he's now been commissioned and he has spoken. Sir, is this the time? and he's been in a room and a visitation of angels and it left him numb. Imagine experience you've had some experiences folks where this experience even left a messenger left brother Bradam numb in the corner of the room and his wife knocking on the door gently knocking and and and and the visitation just by vision left him in that state. Now he's commissioned go west. He goes in a desert place and the visitation of the angels. He said they came from the eternities in a split. Caught him up into that. Oh, a lot of people. Joseph Smith saw an angel. These people saw angels. All kinds of people had angels. I'm talking about something that came out of this visitation. I'm talking about a word. I'm talking about something that makes a congregation such as you are today. If this thing doesn't have any real substance to it, then we forget it. Go home, enjoy life, and have a good time. But I declare today that there is something there's a life that's present with the believers of this message that you cannot find elsewhere. And if you could, I would be there. &gt;&gt; I want to be honest enough with you. If there was something someplace that exceeded this, I would I would seek to be there. I want to be where God is, where God's doing things. But I see a character. I see a presence of God. I feel that atmosphere. I can I can sense that amongst the people. And friends, it's my diet. &gt;&gt; It's my diet. I'll I'll borrow Brother Burkheart's words what he said to me from from Frankfurt, Germany, when I was trying to convince him to stay there. Just stay in Germany. You know, get behind the work and do what you can. And and he just said, "Ah, brother Ed, brother Bisll, this is my diet. I have to say to you this message is my diet. &gt;&gt; And when you get into it, you can't see anything else but that. &gt;&gt; He prophet said if I came speaking to you of a a Lutheran message, he said it wouldn't mean anything to you. If I came speaking the Wesleyan message, it wouldn't mean anything to you. This message means something to you. And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then there's nothing there. You know, the two pieces of paper aren't coming together. But it means something to you. Then they're coming together. Say it fits. That's my diet &gt;&gt; that energizes me. That gives me supernatural health. &gt;&gt; And now in the end time, he's had the visitation. Listen closely. And before now he comes back and he's commissioned. The lamb has to open the seals. But these mysteries cannot remain as mysteries. They must be unfolded, unveiled. And so the messenger comes back to do that. But before he does that, before he starts with the first seal, and this is really critical, many of you it's may perhaps be elementary, but to others it's not. And before the messenger, the mouthpiece begins to speak the opening of the seals and the revealing of the mysteries that God has held before the foundation of the world. He speaks to God in simplicity and then moves into the breach. He said now you want to read the breach. Says now the breach is between the church ages and the seals. He said the seals was is Christ himself because it's the revealing of Christ. And the church ages is exactly what it is. Church which is in the feminine gender is the time the era of the woman. The church for 2,000 years. The church ages. At the end of the church ages comes a a call of a messenger calling out a people. Come out from amongst her. &gt;&gt; Be ye separate, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now it called her out to do what? And if you read the breach, you'll keep running into this phrase because now comes the time. Calvary was the redeeming price. But now comes the time for redemption claims. &gt;&gt; It was spoke of redemption in heaven. The skins in Eden spoke of redemption. Abel spoke of redemption. Noah spoke of redemption. Abraham spoke of redemption. Moses spoke of redemption. Elijah spoke of redemption. And Christ on Calvary paid the price for redemption. But now in the end time comes the claiming time to claim what was purchased. Redemptions claims he said he comes forth to take his claims. Now comes forth to take his claims. He had done the kinsman work. You'll find in the breach, the message of breach, you'll have to have the book of Ruth ready because that's where it comes from. The book of Ruth. When Ruth was redeemed, actually Naomi was redeemed. Naomi, the Orthodox church, Orthodox Jewish church is redeemed in redeeming it. Got Ruth, the gentile bride. So now I want to talk about the fullness of redemption. The fullness of redemption, it can only be the fullness of redemption can only be when what God held in his mind now becomes something that materially happens. &gt;&gt; God God saw Christ the lamb redeeming mankind. It wasn't it wasn't sufficient that he just had it there. It had to be physical. There had to be a place called Mount Calvary. There had to be a cross, a wooden cross. There had to be a man, Jesus Christ, the new creation, nailed on his altar. That had to happen in order for what God had in his mind to be fulfilled. There it is. &gt;&gt; Jesus coming up out of the water. This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; On Mount Transfiguration, this is my beloved son. Hear ye him. It had to happen. It's not sufficient just in the mind and in the mind of God. There had to be a group of people such as we have here this morning. We're not the only people in the in the earth, of course, but there had to be a people such as such as you are here today. There had to be the individual person. When Christ came here, it wasn't sufficient only that Christ came. John had to be there. Peter had to be there. Andrew had to be there. Matthew had to be there. These men had to be there because they were part of the picture. &gt;&gt; And if you're not part of the picture, you go and have a great time. But if you know in your soul, you're part of the picture. Then you have to know that great eternal God, our father, which art in heaven, who loves fatherhood. And he had to have a son. But not only did he have to have a son, he had to have a family. &gt;&gt; Where's the house that you build me? Where's my household? Where's my children? Every single one of them. Is there a mother and father in the scripture? even ask can can a mother forget her child? Can can God forget his children? He can't forget them. So now comes the fullness. Now I want to take a sharp turn with a scripture that you know very well. Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. I want to use that word, and if it sounds like I'm overworking it, maybe I am, to overemphasize it. We don't know what the substance was in heaven. We don't know what form if there was any form. Then we come down into Eden and God slays animals but he takes the skins of it. And then Abel slays an animal. And now we have actual for the first time we actually have a physical physical blood of an animal that's that is shed. I want to say something. It wasn't the substance of the blood that came out of Abel's lamb. It was the substance of the revelation that was in his heart. That was the substance that God was looking at. Because that substance that was on that substance that came out of his lamb, that's going to be gone in a few days. But that substance, faith is a substance. And he had a revelation from God, but more than that, he had faith that that revelation had come from God. &gt;&gt; And that's why he offered it to God. So there was something on the altar of his heart that was far beyond the animal that was on the altar. &gt;&gt; God looked beyond that altar. And I want to say to you, I can take you all through the scriptures. It's been faith at every instance. faith. By faith, Noah built an ark to the saving of his household. But not only did he save his household, he was the instrument by which the earth was preserved. &gt;&gt; It was his faith. His faith was the substance. God looking beyond what he offered on the altar. &gt;&gt; What he offered on the altar, God was pleased. It was a sweet smelling sweet sweet smelling incense to God. But why was it a sweet smelling incense? Because God was looking upon his heart. What was on the altar was only expressing what was in his heart. In his being, he comes out into a new world and he offers to God a sacrifice. Faith was the substance able by revelation. He said it was revealed to him by God that it was not beauty. Neither was it fruits of the field or apples that drove them from the garden of Eden. Wasn't apples that drove them from the Garden of Eden. We know that. &gt;&gt; But it was blood. Who told him it was blood? Of all the things he could have offered, who told him it was blood? And so when blood appeared on the earth, it only testified that he had faith in his heart that what God had spoken to him in his inner being in his heart that he believed it &gt;&gt; and God saw the faith and the faith was the substance &gt;&gt; and the animal was only a consequence of his faith. By faith, &gt;&gt; Abel offered. By faith, by the substance that was in his being, he offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. &gt;&gt; By faith, he offered it. &gt;&gt; What are you here for today? by faith in the message and the word that you've believed your very presence here in this place. The fact you maybe raise your hands or lift up your voice or do whatever you do it is it is only an expression of a faith that is in your being and God looks at that faith to see if it's a bleeding &gt;&gt; sacrifice. A lot of people believe things and the things that they are doing they're going to church. They're driving a long ways. They're paying their tithes. They're doing all this activity. But God looks beyond that to see if there's a bleeding sacrifice. &gt;&gt; I do what I do because there's a certain word that came and that message that came had been vindicated by a supernatural God. And a vessel spoke, "Thus saith the Lord." And the prophet and the God of the prophet looks through all the activity of the people, religious activity on earth. And he looks through to see who has blood on the altar. &gt;&gt; And there can't be a whole bunch of bleeding words. &gt;&gt; As there was not a bunch of bleeding Jesus's, there was one. And there's one message. There's one voice. There's one word from God. And it's a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he looks through to that altar to see and that faith is the substance. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Only by revelation could he know to offer the correct substance. Only by a sovereign revelation from God can you know that this message is a message from God. &gt;&gt; Only a revelation can tell you that. And if you truly have that revelation, nothing can ever argue you out of it. Nothing can ever the most the most desolate situation, the most incredible hopeless situation in the bridge. Brother Brandham goes to Ruth, the book of Ruth. I read it again last night, although I know it so well. But the thing I was impressed with once again, how utterly hopeless this situation and and Naomi actually capsulizes the hopelessness of it when she finally says to her daughters-in-law, "Go back to your mother's house. I've heard that there's food and I'm going to return to my people. Go back, daughters. Go back. You've been wonderful young ladies. You've stood with me. We've had the death of my husband and both of your husbands and we've been together and you've been wonderful girls and now I say go back. Said, "No, we're not going to go back." And she says, "Why would you come with me? I'm an old woman." Now, she's making a statement. I'm an old woman. Are there any more sons in me? I don't have a husband. Is there any more sons? In other words, how are you going to be redeemed? The law of redemption says that the brother is supposed to take his wife and raise up seed. How is redemption going to come? There's no possibility of redemption. My husband's gone. I'm an old woman. There's no more sons in my womb. &gt;&gt; Go. And at that orpha went because redemption was so hopeless. You know, friends, we're down here at Le Oysia, but there's a very hopeless generation. &gt;&gt; And there's there's not a few of us that come to times and places in our lives along life's journey when things look utterly hopeless. But I want to say to this congregation and all that are streaming today, the fact that something in heaven said, "There's redemption and I will do redemption." And that very God personally stepped down in in Eden and said, "There's redemption." And he inspired Abel by revelation. There's redemption. &gt;&gt; And he inspired Noah into a new world and there's redemption. And Abraham slaying his son getting ready. It spoke of redemption. There is redemption all the way through. And finally, he hung on the cross, nailed to his altar, declaring to the world before and after, there's redemption. It's been paid for. And now after these hundreds and uh thousands of years comes the same restoring voice that rebuilt the altar back there. Introduce the mess and introduce Christ himself, the angel of the covenant coming in the end time because it's been prophesied he'll come in the end time and heal the hearts of the people. Why? Because the altar had to be rebuilt because they didn't even know what kind of sacrifice to offer. And then he offer the the healing takes place and a word proceeds. A bleeding word that will be the sacrifice for the rebuilt altar, &gt;&gt; the restored altar. A message, a bleeding message that God can look back down on. He looks through. He looks beyond your life and what you're doing. Looks beyond your faithfulness and your giving and your your integrity. He looks beyond all of the religious activity to see what's on the altar. &gt;&gt; And there better be blood there. &gt;&gt; And there's only one bleeding word. There's only one bleeding word. Is there any more sons? And Ruth just says, "Remember Ruth the widow." And Ruth says wonderful words. They like to say it at different times, but Ruth lays a hold of her mother-in-law. Don't entreat me. Don't ask me to leave you because I'm not leaving you. That was the belief. That was the faith. That was the substance. God looked straight through for that. Hadn't told her yet. Hadn't revealed it to her yet. But in God's mind says, "I got a field for you. I got a Boaz for you. I got some harvest. I got some barley for you. I got a restoration for you. You don't know it yet. I haven't revealed it to you. But I look through all of this hopelessness and I see redemption." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a redemption for her. &gt;&gt; She had a Boaz &gt;&gt; when she was still a widow. She had a redeemer. You had a redeemer when you were depths in the depths of sin and unbelief. When you were in your sin and in your hopeless condition, you had a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had a field for you. He had a feast for you. He had a message for you. all prepared for you before you were even aware of it or conscious of it. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Are Boaz? &gt;&gt; And there's nothing I want to say to this congregation today and I want you to take it personally. There is nothing that any man, woman or child here has experienced, is experiencing or ever will experience that is hopeless enough. it. I don't care how hopeless it may appear. &gt;&gt; It cannot be sufficiently hopeless because Christ God has prepared a redemption that is complete. &gt;&gt; And the message came to let us know that redemption claims have now come. He can't claim it till it's happened. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it happened at Calvary." God has required sacrifice all through the ages. I can say to Leodysia, where's your sacrifice beyond where this message will go? Where's your sacrifice? Show me please the bleeding word. Show me please the word that God himself who held skins one day. Show me where he has stood beside the belief, the doctrine, the faith and supernaturally vindicated it and confirmed it again and again again. What God is saying is believe. Believe only. Believe. Believe. Believe it's me. &gt;&gt; Believe it's not a man. Believe it's me. &gt;&gt; The scripture which we read, Christ being come and high priest of good things. Oh, how many times you listen to tapes, read the message books, how many times does the prophet ask, who did she touch? Who did he touch? Who did this one touch? Not me. I'm 30 feet from this person. Who did they touch? The high priest. They touched the high priest. And what did the angel say? If you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayers. So now it was what was in the people's heart first. What was on the altar first? If you can get the people to believe and once they believed the word that was coming then nothing could stand before the prayers. &gt;&gt; Not even cancer. Nothing can stand before the prayers. Are you people following what I'm saying? Faith is the substance. Faith, your faith. Say, "I believe it." And brother Bram says, "If you believe it, you will do it." You believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, just quickly, I don't want to take it be too lengthy this morning in the message broken sistns and I'm using quite a few quotes and I hope I know that you will appreciate that you that are visiting if you won't mind because I'm wanting to lay this out very clearly in the message broken sistns prophet said God only has one meeting place he said over there in the book of Exodus I have chosen the place to put my name and that's the only place that I'll meet the people. So now we can release our you know our imagination. People use their imagination. Oh you know my heart is the place. Okay fine like I was in a very many many years ago I was in a quite a gathering. I'd been invited and it was just in a house and everybody was you know just gathered and they had heard about the message. Some of them and a lot of them had not. And I thought, what am I going to speak to these people? And there was about 22 people there. So I said, now I don't know these people. Maybe this one over here is a Nazarene, and this one over here may be from the Salvation Army, and this one over here might be a Baptist, and this one over here may be a Pentecostal. This one over here may be a a Catholic. But if I said, "Do you love Jesus?" You'd all say, you all would say, "Yes, we love Jesus." And now I'm going to read the scripture that says that Jesus was the word and the word became flesh. Jesus is the word. And I'm quite certain that you all believe a different word. You all believe a different word. You all have a different doctrine. So would the real Jesus please stand up? Who who who has Jesus? This one's got a trinity. This one doesn't even believe in the communion. And this one over here believes something else. And this one doesn't baptize. And this one baptizes. And who has Jesus? Who has blood on the altar? &gt;&gt; Who has a bleeding word? &gt;&gt; And there isn't a whole array of them. &gt;&gt; And that's what people are have a hard time with. Say there's only one way. &gt;&gt; There's only one way. &gt;&gt; There's only one Jesus. There's only one voice. God's not going to confuse. I sense that that's difficult for some people that are even here, but that's the truth. There's only one place I've chosen to put my name and that he chose a place to put his name and where he puts his name. That's where he met Israel. He's got a place that he meets the church. He got a place where he met Israel. He got a place where he meets his church today. and he chose that name and that name is Jesus Christ. So now if a person says Jesus Christ, do they have that name? Someone say yes because it's in their language. So we express it and we have many many tongues that are here and we would say it in our in our native tongue. Does that mean we have him? It has to go beyond that. That's a physical thing that is taking place. But if that is taking place as a result of a pure, undiluted, unadulterated faith on the altar of the heart that has heard the voice of God and has been revealed to them. This is the word that you sent. This is your voice to me. And I cast all other things aside. I cast my own thoughts aside and I declare that is the revelation that has come from you. I believe it. God looks beyond your action. He looks beyond your voice, beyond the hearing of your voice. Because you may all say Jesus differently, but he looks down to see what is in the bosom, what is in the heart to see if there's a bleeding word there. In other words, he's saying, "What is it you've believed?" &gt;&gt; Here's all the various doctrines. Now friends, perhaps you can see, and you'll have to think this over. Perhaps you can see why that little messenger, why brother Brandham cut so hard and was so uh so fervent against denomination. Why I'm against denomination? Because denomination was instilling and putting different things upon the altar. &gt;&gt; They were putting things upon the altar and making people devoted with the doctrine from the church and putting things on the altar of their heart that God couldn't accept. No wonder he had to cut that thing down. &gt;&gt; He was doing them the greatest favor. &gt;&gt; But they said, "You're against my church. You're against my pastor. You're against my priest. You're against He wasn't against that. He was against the fact that God couldn't accept it." Said, "There's only one place." Oh, church, help me. You believe that? There's only one place. And if you can see my message of God is looking beyond &gt;&gt; the actions that you may do. He's looking beyond the confession of the word of your mouth to see first what's on your heart &gt;&gt; and then if what comes out of your mouth matches what's on your heart. &gt;&gt; God looks on the heart &gt;&gt; and sees a bleeding sacrifice. Said that's my bleeding word that is acceptable to me. You are redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's what redemption is all about. You're one I've come to redeem. And now I've come with redemption's claims. He says, "There's where he meets the true believer." The same place. It's not complicated. You don't have to explain this message I'm preaching this morning. All you have to do is believe. Believe with a sincere heart. Believe with a pure heart. And God that I'm talking about today, I need it myself because God's not looking on your heart for me. He's looking on my heart for me. Looking on your heart for you to see what's on your heart to see what is there. Ephesians, and I'm going to be closing in just another few minutes. Ephesians, Paul says, Ephesians 1:14, speaking of the spirit, which is the earnest of our inheritance. Let's let's let's turn to that. I I'd like you to read that with me. Ephesians chapter 1. We'll read verse 13 first. In whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth. In whom you also had faith. in whom you also trusted. After that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. In whom also after that you believed, you trusted. And after you believed, you were what? &gt;&gt; Sealed. Say it again. You were sealed. After you believed, so what was God looking at? He was looking at the substance &gt;&gt; of the faith. on your heart. And after you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest, the down payment of our inheritance until until the redemption of the purchased possession. &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet is coming now ready to open the seals. And he's saying that this is the time. This is what is happening. This is the time that that that Ruth is to be redeemed. This is the time. This is the time, friends, for the redemption to claims to come into place. &gt;&gt; Redemption claims have been happening. &gt;&gt; You know why you're here? Because the message came and the spirit of God came with that word and laid hold of you and claimed you for himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very coming of the message, not the healing ministry, the first pull, not the second pull, but the healing, the opening of the message, the third third pull caught the bride. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word caught the bride. &gt;&gt; And it was the &gt;&gt; kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; making his claim on you. That's what's been happening. &gt;&gt; We're here because we've been claimed. &gt;&gt; Redemption claims have all come into place. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in the in the breach, I'm going to just go very quickly here. He said, "What is the which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory in the breach?" He said, "That's what the Holy Spirit's been doing. He goes and he inspects Oh, I could stop here and preach a service. Brother Be talks about people seeing flying saucers and all of these things. He just stops and says, "Well, investigating angels." Does that sound strange? Men were busy every day. Every day they were busy building the Tower of Babel. We got to we got to reach something up into heaven because there's been a flood and we want to be sure and have a name. We want to be sure and establish ourselves. We got to have a name. And the Bible says, "And God came down to see what they were doing." You say, "God, I thought he knew everything." Oh, there's times when he just wants to come and see it himself personally. And God came down. God came down in the time of in the time of Abraham &gt;&gt; and he said and two messengers went to Lot to Sodom said I want to go down and see now what they've done &gt;&gt; and in the end time oh in the end time we were shooting splutnicks up in uh space shuttles up into the space and going several billion miles going all out there and examining the universe and I think God just is you little twerps You haven't even You haven't even got to the first word that came out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; You've gone there three billion miles. How do you like to go three billion light years? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The kind of God that we have. And in this age, he came down. &gt;&gt; Says to Moses, I've come down. Go thou therefore. Brother Brandon makes a big point out of that. Keep saying it. I've come down. You go. I've come down. You go. Who was I was going? Wasn't William Brandom out of Jeffersonville, Indiana. God was going. &gt;&gt; Look through those eyes to see where this cultured, educated, theological, science generation had gone. God came down. &gt;&gt; Let's see where they're at. And he inspected the church. It's sick. very sick. Looked at all the religions filled, the Bible says, with putrifying swords. &gt;&gt; He looked at the world. He looked at science going towards death. God inspected this age. &gt;&gt; He inspected this age. I don't believe there's a person here that has really come to a real revelation of the message. A real revelation. But what one of the first things that happened, you begin to feel such so exposed, so exposed. And things that seem so great to you just ethered away. And all of the righteousness that we once thought we had and all that we thought we knew just vanished &gt;&gt; in his presence. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; Do you know why you were being inspected? The inspector come not not with some critical eye but just coming and examining you. I look across this congregation and all kinds of experiences come back. People that I've talked to, I see them sitting in the congregation today and they had something to say. You know, I might get in trouble. Sister Bobby Graham, she she knows me well enough. that she can take it. She was reared in the Catholic, you know, the Catholic faith. She knew her catechism. She knew the Bible. Brother Joe had talked to me. He said, he said, "I, you know, she she really understands. She knows, you know, the Bible and religious things." So, I said, "I haven't really got a chance with her." So, anyway, make it short. She came to church. Brother Vin was preaching and he preached on the Vatican, the Catholic Church and the Popes and the whole works and just took it all up in little pieces and dropped it all to the ground. And I'll never forget and Sister Bobby walked out that door. She wasn't Sister Bobby yet, but she walked out the door, was leaning kind of against the wall, and I kind of come by and I said, "Well, Sister Bobby," she says, "Now I know you're Catholic bashing. You remember it?" I said, "No, no, Sister Bobby, not the people, the system." &gt;&gt; And she and and her face just lit up. She wouldn't know it because I was the one looking at her. And she just said, "Oh, I knew it was coming through." Wasn't very long she was in the tank. What is the what what what's God doing through his servants? What's God doing through the message? begins to inspect, &gt;&gt; examine and take down things we have such confidence in. And that is why friends, you may you may even, you know, uh uh it it may cause you to just wiggle a little bit when you hear how stern brother Bradom comes. But when you realize that he is causing a person to know what they have on the altar is not acceptable. Forgive me for just taking these few more moments. But when Cain, you can appreciate, I want you to appreciate the grace that came to you. When Cain found that his offering wasn't accepted, he was angry. See, when Esau found that he had his value and his agenda set wrong, he was angry. When Jesus came and one of the things that the Pharisees saw is that when he prayed, he had an answer. And they found a life that was accepted. And their life that they were expressing was not accepted. And when they found they weren't accepted, their sacrifice wasn't accepted, they did the same thing as their father. They became angry. Here come a messenger. Well, I hope you see what I see. Here come a messenger, little humble man with signs and the evidence that God was supporting and accepting that ministry. And when he said they say, "Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?" Every say true. and sometimes in the most difficult of people behind him and ministers and theologians and politicians and all the rest of it and some of them for they were for the gift against what he was preaching but he would just keep plowing on plowing on and to let them know there was God. He said who would know that you got cancer? He said now I wouldn't know. He said you probably came from a lot further away maybe. He said I come from Indiana and maybe you came from Florida. I don't know. We're totally two different people. we came from to how would I ever know anything about you? But if he would let me know and people were being disrespectful and he was they've been having a hard time. He says people have spirits. There are spirits and it it it's difficult and he was you know trying to correct the people gently in the midst of trying to let this woman find her place of deliverance. So then finally said well yes. He said actually he said you don't come from Florida you happen to come from New York and you have cancer. It's cancer of the breast. Says I believe it's the left breast. Is that true? I don't care who I don't care who would resist that. I don't care if a man had one twit of intelligence. He'd have to say that is a supernatural act. &gt;&gt; And if what comes out of his mouth is truth, truth, truth, truth, truth. When he comes to this, I would suggest it's truth, truth, truth, truth, truth. It says the angel said, "If you can get the people to believe, nothing will stand before your prayers, not even cancer." Why is he saying that? Cancer is a cell, a wild cell goes wild. And the very utterance of this message, this messenger, listen, some people, some people think, well, it was just what brother Brandham was saying. There were times he couldn't do anything because the person didn't believe. The substance is the faith. If you believe, believe that he was God's messenger. Believe that was God's voice. If you believed then you received it. &gt;&gt; Is that being clear? &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance. And so today, if I asked across the world, who's expecting Jesus Christ to return? There'd be multitudes and millions and untold untold countless millions of people would raise their hands and include themselves. And I would say how many expect to go? There'd be untold millions, tens of millions. But I think that you will agree with me when I say this that those that are going, that act of going is the final act of redemption. He paid for the claim. He has come now to make the claim. And the claim, the claim that he makes on the individual is not our works. They're all the things that we do. It's what you have received and believed in your heart. And God looks beyond what you do. And that is why that is why oh my I could carry on. I I just don't want to. But that is why you can make a mistake, a sincere mistake. And if you sin, you have an advocate with the father. If you fall, if you slip, if you do wrong right away, but God even looks beyond the wrong. You thought something wrong, you said something wrong, you did something wrong. And God looks beyond the wrong to see if there's something bleeding on the altar and can say, "There's a token on the altar. There's blood on the altar. Who isn't making mist? Who isn't doing wrong at some point in time? I'm glad I could say in the heart there's a faith in the word. I know I declare this message came from God. And God's looking to see what's on the heart. &gt;&gt; And faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. And so we have that kind of faith and it's anchored to the promise of this day that I've been repeating in all of the services. My final closing statements. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed &gt;&gt; in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And when you say that and a multitude of others say that and a million other people and 10 million and 100 million people say that, I can say God is going to listen beyond what is coming out of their mouth. He's going to look beyond the activity of their being. They're faithful to the church. They give of their offerings. They do. He's going to look beyond that to see what substance is on the altar. church. We've got to be a very, very, very thankful people today &gt;&gt; that by the grace of God, there's a bleeding sacrifice on the altar of our heart. Hallelujah. Let's pray. Father, something has been so moving within my own soul and being. I am just so grateful to you trying to grasp not only your greatness but your grace and how it has reached down to a people in this age, in this generation. And now, oh God, we see in this end time, we see the plan, the program as it has unfolded. And we say with everything that's in us, oh God, how glorious. And I could shout out across the world, how great thou art. How wonderful are your works. How wonderful is your word to us today, Lord. And I pray that you will bless, Father, this people. Bless those that hold your word dear and have it as it were in uh just uh graced oh God in their hearts with faith believing oh Lord and just cultivating that faith. I ask that you'll bless them Lord and whatever whatever is required here today in this service. If someone needs forgiveness, may they know that the act that they require forgiveness of, God will look beyond that to see what is on the altar. God, I pray that you will do this. I pray that you will look beyond, oh God, our frailties and look beyond all of those things and see the faith when we sing only believe. It's not just a chorus we've heard maybe hundreds of times, but we are expressing and declaring something that is in our heart. God, you said you look upon the heart. I'm so glad you do. So glad you look upon our heart. I pray that you will bless father us today and the remainder of the service and this evening as we come prepared. Oh God, we dedicate this day to you. We sanctify it to you. We set it apart. Oh God, we sanctify our hearts to you. We sanctify our whole being in the lovely name of Jesus. We thank you. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, we don't have the projector today and someone else needed it more than we did, I guess. But I can sing with all my being. I am redeemed. Would you like to stand and sing it with me? [Music] I am redeemed. [Music] whole life. If anybody asks you who I am, tell them I am redeemed. I am redeemed. with the &gt;&gt; my Jesus my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I think after the service this morning and you listened so so reverently and so nice, I want you to know I appreciate that. I think now you can understand and I question whether I would say this but I think you can understand now when I say before you were lost you were actually found before we were sick there was a remedy before you were born you were born Again, &gt;&gt; before we needed redemption, &gt;&gt; we were already redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like taking my coat off and starting to preach. Before you were born, you were born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, how could that be? I can point to the time I was born again. In the mind of God, you were redeemed. If you weren't born again, how did he write your name in the book? &gt;&gt; In the lamb's book of life. How could he write your name in the lamb's book of life? Before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw you down through all this dilemma. &gt;&gt; He saw Ruth through all of her trouble. And there's nothing too hopeless for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God's not got anything surprising him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would cause me to sing that course just a little bit differently. And not only I am redeemed, I was redeemed. I am redeemed. Oh, I am redeemed with a Jesus [Music] My whole life [Music] if anybody ask you just I am tell &gt;&gt; make it a personal declaration now I am redeemed [Music] My Jesus has saved my life. [Music] If anybody asks you, [Music] tell them I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to break out of your shell and turn around to somebody and shake a hand and tell them, "I'm redeemed." Well, what a what a combination that makes. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God bless you. I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So nice to have you. God bless you. God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; So nice to have you. Amen. Amen. Ernie, God bless you. [Music] Oh, I am redeemed by the Jesus. [Music] If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the presence of Jehovah. I believe that's where we are. &gt;&gt; That's where we are right now. in the presence of Jehovah. Let's just worship him for a few moments before we are dismissed. I'm going to ask our brother Dier if he would dismiss us in prayer in the [Music] God mighty [Music] trouble. Hearts are amazing in the praise. We're just going to we're just going to sing it once more. But before we do, I'd like you to just look inwardly in your own heart, your own soul. Say, "Oh God, this must be more than just expression. I want you to look beyond the expression, beyond the song, beyond the melody, beyond the words. Look down to where the incense is rising. Smelly incense. Oh God, Jehovah, I'm in your presence. Be pleased. Let me tell you something friends. When God is pleased with life, he just pours out upon you blessing after bless. We don't have to seek blessings. He just pours it out upon you in the presence. [Music] God might prince of peace [Music] in the presence. Father, we thank you today for allowing us once again to sit and stand in your presence, Lord, to hear the Holy Spirit anchor these things in in our hearts, in our souls to see you drive away the questions and the wonders. Bring about such a confidence in your eternal work that you have done in us. Lord, we want to return thanksgiving unto you today. For truly it has been good to sit at your feet today and hear you, Father, tenderly minister to us that you have taken care of it all. Father, you are the great kinsman redeemer, the great Boaz. Yet, oh God, this all planned, Father, already prepared that we can walk in it in this hour, be the very interpretation of your word, Father, the very thing that you held in the back part of your mind. This great secret of redemption, oh God, to see them unfold down to this very hour and see ourselves as part of the picture this morning. We just want to say thank you father. We want to bless your mighty name. We want to appreciate you oh God. We want to say we love you father because you love us first oh God to provide a sacrifice before we even oh God come to experience sin. You made a way dear God that we can find our way back home today. So we thank you dear Jesus for you are the way, the life and the truth and you have drawn us to yourself and we love you today. We just accept everything you have said today. We say yeah amen father to your word. We receive it with gladness and joy and we go father rejoicing in what you have done this morning once again by reminding us these great things that are so true. Oh God, we agree with what you have said and we thank you for your servant and your people this morning. Bless each one. Dismiss us with your benediction now and gather us again under your mighty wings. Oh God, and anoint your servant to just continue with us from this atmosphere. Father, we appreciate you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Dier. And we'd ask you to greet one another with a real godly spirit this evening at 5:00. Come early and come praying and be ready for the word as our brother Lance will minister and baptisms. Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
