[0:00] some Bright Day on the other side it'll
[0:02] be different I just can't you just can't
[0:05] afford people to miss that place don't
[0:07] do it whatever you do make don't be
[0:10] afraid there's no need of being scared
[0:12] there's nothing to be afraid of oh when
[0:14] I thought to come back it made me sad
[0:18] well I have to go back again well I have
[0:21] to go back to what I was afraid of being
[0:24] see then when we come to the resurrected
[0:27] body then we will eat and drink they
[0:30] didn't eat and drink they had no need of
[0:32] eating and drinking they wasn't going
[0:34] nowhere and they wasn't tired it was
[0:37] just there's no word that I could use it
[0:40] was perfect that wouldn't make it it's
[0:42] beyond what I call perfect they just AR
[0:45] that was it at that place and it was
[0:48] wonderful so oh listen friends I I think
[0:52] I'm in my right mind and I I I know it
[0:55] sounds strange but I've never been able
[0:58] and never tried to explain to people
[1:01] these things many things it's it's
[1:05] beyond explaining and you'd only confuse
[1:08] the people's mind but if I could and
[1:12] felt to do so it would be alarming but
[1:16] notice this I say this don't be afraid
[1:19] death is just a scarecrow trying to keep
[1:22] you away from something my It's So
[1:25] Glorious it's beyond anything that you
[1:27] could think of no wonder the Bible said
[1:30] Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not Heard
[1:33] neither has it entered the hearts of men
[1:35] what God has for them in store that love
[1:38] or just to look aast the curtain of time
[1:40] then I've tried harder never before in
[1:43] life to try to win people to Christ
[1:45] since then you can't afford to miss it
[1:48] don't do it be sure that you're right
[1:52] with God and other things will be all
[1:54] right
